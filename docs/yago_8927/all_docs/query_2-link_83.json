Although Proxima Cen b orbits within its star's habitable zone, multiple plausible evolutionary paths could have generated different environments that may or may not be habitable. Here, we use 1-D coupled climate-photochemical models to generate self-consistent atmospheres for several evolutionary scenarios, including high-O2, high-CO2, and more Earth-like atmospheres, with both oxic and anoxic compositions. We show that these modeled environments can be habitable or uninhabitable at Proxima Cen b's position in the habitable zone. We use radiative transfer models to generate synthetic spectra and thermal phase curves for these simulated environments, and use instrument models to explore our ability to discriminate between possible planetary states. These results are applicable not only to Proxima Cen b but to other terrestrial planets orbiting M dwarfs. Thermal phase curves may provide the first constraint on the existence of an atmosphere. We find that James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations longward of 10 μm could characterize atmospheric heat transport and molecular composition. Detection of ocean glint is unlikely with JWST but may be within the reach of larger-aperture telescopes. Direct imaging spectra may detect O4 absorption, which is diagnostic of massive water loss and O2 retention, rather than a photosynthetic biosphere. Similarly, strong CO2 and CO bands at wavelengths shortward of 2.5 μm would indicate a CO2-dominated atmosphere. If the planet is habitable and volatile-rich, direct imaging will be the best means of detecting habitability. Earth-like planets with microbial biospheres may be identified by the presence of CH4—which has a longer atmospheric lifetime under Proxima Centauri's incident UV—and either photosynthetically produced O2 or a hydrocarbon haze layer.

Introduction\n\nThe discovery of a possibly terrestrial-mass planet sitting squarely in the habitable zone of the Solar System's nearest neighbor (Anglada-Escudé et al., 2016) is a remarkable opportunity to further our understanding of the evolution of terrestrial planets and the distribution of life in the Universe. If confirmed, Proxima Cen b is the closest potentially habitable planet and one of the most accessible examples orbiting a late-type M dwarf host. M dwarfs comprise 70% of all stars, and habitable planets orbiting M dwarfs may be the most common environment for life in the Universe. However, although Proxima Cen b has several promising attributes, including its possibly small size (minimum mass of 1.3 M⊕) and its position in the conservative habitable zone (Kopparapu et al., 2013) with an effective instellation (i.e., stellar irradiation) 65% that of Earth's (Anglada-Escudé et al., 2016), its habitability is not guaranteed. A determination of the degree to which this planet is habitable, or any other insights into the fate of terrestrial planets orbiting M dwarfs, awaits follow-up information on its orbit, the planet's phase- and time-dependent photometry, and on spectra of the atmosphere and surface. Conversely, Proxima Cen b will ultimately provide an excellent observational laboratory for our current understanding of terrestrial planet evolution, which will in turn inform our knowledge of the prevalence of habitability and life in our galaxy.\n\nIn advance of these data, we can synthesize what has been learned over the past several decades on star-planet and planetary environmental interactions for terrestrial planets to make a broad, preliminary assessment of plausible evolutionary processes and current environmental states for Proxima Cen b. This assessment will also be highly relevant to other terrestrial planets found in M dwarf habitable zones, such as the recently discovered TRAPPIST-1 planets (Gillon et al., 2016, 2017) and LHS1140 b (Dittmann et al., 2017). In our companion paper (Barnes et al., 2018), we explored likely evolutionary paths for Proxima Cen b, as it coevolved with the Galaxy, companion stars and planets, and its host star. In this paper, we model several of these possible planetary environmental outcomes with coupled climate-photochemical models that are self-consistently forced by the spectrum of Proxima Cen. We then use radiative transfer and instrument simulation models to generate synthetic phase-dependent light curves, and transmission and direct imaging spectra, which are relevant to missions such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST1; e.g., Cowan et al., 2015), ground-based extremely large telescopes (ELTs; e.g., Kasper et al., 2008), the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST2; Spergel et al., 2015), the Habitable Exoplanet Imaging Mission (HabEx3; e.g., Mennesson et al., 2016), and the Large UltraViolet Optical Infrared Surveyor telescope (LUVOIR4; e.g., Kouveliotou et al., 2014; Dalcanton et al., 2015). These spectra can be used to predict possible attributes and necessary measurements to identify discriminants for habitable and uninhabitable environments, and to explore the potential detectability of environmental signs of habitability and life.\n\nWe consider scenarios for atmospheric composition driven by stellar, orbital, and planetary evolution, and use our models to explore the photochemical and climatic outcomes, and observable attributes. Our first scenario is an oxygen-dominated atmosphere, generated by the loss of oceans of water during Proxima Cen's pre-main sequence phase (Luger and Barnes, 2015). In this scenario, the planet can be either desiccated or have retained some of its initial water inventory. In the second class of scenario, the atmosphere is CO2-dominated and progressively desiccated, and is formed when the majority of O2 from ocean loss is either lost to space or sequestered in the planetary crust or interior (Schaefer et al., 2016), while CO2 is outgassed from the mantle. In this case, O2/CO2-dominated atmospheres could form and potentially evolve to more CO2-rich Venus-like states as the O2 is lost or sequestered. Ultimately, with extreme desiccation, CO2-dominated atmospheres could photolyze to stable CO2/CO/O2 atmospheres (Gao et al., 2015). In the final set of scenarios explored here, the planet is potentially habitable, having evolved as a “Habitable Evaporated Core” (Luger et al., 2015), where an early hydrogen envelope protected a terrestrial or volatile-rich core from water loss. Alternatively, a terrestrial planet initially orbiting farther from the star could have moved to the current orbit of Proxima Cen b via orbital instabilities, possibly triggered by a close passage of Proxima Cen to α Cen A and B (Barnes et al., 2018). Two cases are presented for this habitable scenario: an oxidizing, modern Earth-like atmosphere, and a more reducing Archean (3.8–2.5 billion years ago) early Earth-like atmosphere.\n\nIn Section 2, we review the possible evolutionary scenarios for Proxima Centauri b and briefly discuss observable parameters for identification of habitability and biosignatures for terrestrial planets. In Section 3, we describe the radiative transfer, instrument, climate, and photochemical models, along with their model inputs. In Section 4, we present our results. In Section 5, we discuss the implications of our modeling, including an assessment of the scenarios that might lead to habitability for Proxima Cen b. We also identify future observations that will help discriminate between the proposed evolutionary paths, and potentially identify signs of habitability and life. These results are summarized in our conclusions in Section 6.\n\n2. Review of Habitability and Detectability\n\nIn this section, we briefly review the factors that can affect terrestrial planet habitability and the plausible evolutionary paths for Proxima Cen b as explored in our companion paper by Barnes et al. (2018). We describe how characteristics of the planet and planetary system could affect Proxima Cen b's current climate. To motivate the detectability simulation results and discussion that follow, we will also briefly review relevant knowledge on observations to identify signs of habitability and life for terrestrial planets.\n\n2.1. Evolutionary processes and the possible habitability of Proxima Cen b\n\nAlthough Proxima Cen b is possibly small enough to be terrestrial and sits in the habitable zone of its parent star, many factors other than planetary mass and star-planet distance affect a planet's volatile inventory, atmosphere, and surface environment. These factors, in conjunction with the evolution of the star and planet, can maintain or destroy habitability. Classically, exoplanet habitability is defined as the ability to maintain liquid water on the surface of a rocky, terrestrial planet, and the habitable zone is that range of distances from the star over which an Earth-like planet can maintain surface liquid water (Kasting et al., 1993). However, if Proxima Cen b formed in situ, then planet formation models suggest that it may be water-poor (Lissauer et al., 2007; Raymond et al., 2007); but if it migrated in from further out in the system, then it may have been more volatile-rich at formation (Luger et al., 2015). Proxima Cen b's close-in orbit (a = 0.0485 AU; Anglada-Escudé et al., 2016) also leaves it particularly vulnerable to the effects of stellar evolution and longer-term radiative and gravitational interaction between star and planet. These interactions could drive volatile and atmospheric loss processes and orbital changes that could preclude habitability for this planet. These processes are examined in more detail in our companion paper, and an overview of the scope of plausible scenarios is given here to motivate the climate and spectral modeling work that follows.\n\nPerhaps the greatest threat to Proxima Cen b's habitability is the luminosity evolution of its M dwarf host (Luger and Barnes, 2015; Barnes et al., 2018; Ribas et al., 2016). Lower-mass M dwarfs can experience extended pre-main sequence phases of up to a billion years, in which they are more luminous than they will ultimately be when they settle on to the main sequence (Baraffe et al., 1998, 2015). During this superluminous pre-main sequence phase, any terrestrial planet that forms in what will become the main sequence habitable zone is subjected to extremely high levels of radiation, which can vaporize and photolyze oceans and strip lighter elements from the atmosphere (Luger and Barnes, 2015). Simulations performed in our companion paper indicate that, had Proxima Cen b formed at its current location, then its host star would have taken as long as 169 ± 13 million years after formation to dim sufficiently to allow the planet to enter the habitable zone for the first time (Barnes et al., 2018). Consequently, if Proxima Cen b is a terrestrial planet, it may have been in a runaway greenhouse state for the first 169 million years. The vaporized ocean would have been photolyzed by UV from the host star, with subsequent loss of H to space; and between ∼3 and 10 terrestrial ocean equivalents of water could have been lost, depending on the efficiency of oxygen sinks, photochemical shielding, and the planet's initial water endowment (Barnes et al., 2018).\n\nSince loss of one Earth ocean equivalent of water can potentially produce up to 240 bar of atmospheric oxygen (Kasting, 1997), the remaining atmosphere may be strongly oxygen-dominated (Luger and Barnes, 2015) but may transition to being more CO2-dominated with time as the free oxygen reacts with the surface. The final amount of oxygen will depend on the initial water inventory, the stellar XUV flux, atmospheric losses through hydrodynamic escape and other top-of-atmosphere processes (Collinson et al., 2016; Airapetian et al., 2017; Dong et al., 2017), and the efficiency of planetary sequestration processes (e.g., Schaefer et al., 2016). However, if the atmosphere is retained and oxygen loss and sequestration is efficient—and CO2 outgassing proceeds via terrestrial geological activity—then the atmosphere may transition from O2-dominated, through O2/CO2-dominated, to a more Venus-like, CO2-dominated atmosphere, if large quantities of outgassed CO2 are present (Chassefière, 1996a, 1996b). Note that Barnes et al. (2018) found that the mantle temperature of Proxima Cen b could be maintained at high values due to either tidal heating or increased radiogenic heating, so a high outgassing rate may be likely. If the planet also outgasses SO2, photochemical processes can result in the formation of a planetwide sulfate cloud and haze deck. If the atmosphere is desiccated, with H2O abundances of the order of tens of parts per million, HDO may be enhanced as an indicator of early water loss, as is also the case for Venus (de Bergh et al., 1991). Should such a CO2-dominated planet become significantly more desiccated than Venus—with atmospheric hydrogen inventories <1 ppm—then photochemical processes can split CO2 while the lack of hydrogen-bearing species inhibits its recombination, resulting in a stable equilibrium mixture of CO2, CO, O2, and O3 (Gao et al., 2015).\n\nHowever, Proxima Cen b may be more likely to be habitable if it formed at its current position with a dense hydrogen envelope, or formed in a region of the protoplanetary disk rich in ices—and then migrated inward. For these scenarios, rather than stripping water from the planet, the superluminous pre-main sequence phase of the star may have removed enough of the primordial hydrogen (Owen and Mohanty, 2016) to reveal a habitable evaporated core—a potentially volatile-rich planet without the dense hydrogen envelope that may otherwise preclude habitability (Luger et al., 2015). Our calculations suggest that, if Proxima Cen b started with 0.1–1% of its planetary mass in hydrogen, it could have survived the pre-main sequence phase and remained habitable (Barnes et al., 2018). The extreme UV radiation from Proxima Cen would have caused H2 loss—protecting the water vapor beneath—for the ∼170 million years required for the star to dim and the planet to enter the habitable zone. At this point, the planet would have been safe from further H2O loss if atmospheric water vapor were cold trapped in the troposphere by a sufficient inventory of noncondensable gases, such as N2 (Wordsworth and Pierrehumbert, 2014). Even if sufficient N2 were not initially available, the buildup of O2 (also a noncondensable gas) from the loss of H2O could potentially reestablish the cold trap and inhibit subsequent water loss (Wordsworth and Pierrehumbert, 2014). Another potential path to habitability of Proxima Cen b is a later, large-scale dynamical instability of its planetary system possibly caused by Proxima Centauri passing close to α Cen A and B (Barnes et al., 2018). If the planet formed beyond the habitable zone, orbital disruption could have allowed it to arrive in its current orbit after the pre-main sequence phase. In this scenario, the planet would not need an initial thick hydrogen envelope to protect it from desiccation and could start off as a terrestrial body.\n\nOver the 3.5- to 6-billion-year age of the system (Bazot et al., 2007), Proxima Cen's activity levels may have also affected the planet's habitability. Despite its relatively long rotation period (83.5 days, Benedict et al., 1998), which often correlates with lower activity levels, Proxima Cen is a moderately active star with many strong flares per year (Davenport, 2016), and the stellar magnetic field which drives stellar activity is ∼600 times stronger than that of our sun (Reiners and Basri, 2008). Earlier modeling suggested that Earth-mass planets in the habitable zones of M dwarf stars would suffer continuous exposure to strong stellar winds originating from coronal mass ejection events with a subsequent rapid loss of planetary atmosphere (Lammer et al., 2008). This loss could be exacerbated by the shutdown of magnetic dynamo production due to tidal heating of the planet (Driscoll and Barnes, 2015) or higher initial radiogenic abundances than Earth (Barnes et al., 2018). Ribas et al. (2016) also argue that ion pickup processes could remove up to 100 bar of N2, which would enhance stratospheric water vapor concentrations and potentially lead to the loss of up to 21 Earth ocean equivalents of hydrogen over the age of the system. Airapetian et al. (2017) pointed out that ion loss processes from the early active star could remove oxygen and nitrogen from planets orbiting active M dwarf stars, although this rate is subject to the strength of the planet's magnetic field, and replenishment rates from outgassing and volatile delivery. Garraffo et al. (2016) used magentohydrodynamic models of the stellar wind pressure and conclude that Proxima Cen b's magnetospheric standoff distance undergoes significant stellar wind–induced changes on daily timescales, that are important to consider when calculating atmospheric loss processes. Dong et al. (2017) also modeled atmospheric loss from a CO2-dominated 1 bar atmosphere for Proxima Cen b and concluded that such a planet may undergo significant atmospheric erosion over billion-year timescales in both the magnetized and unmagnetized cases but that the ionospheric profiles of heavier ions such as O2+ and CO2+ are mostly unaffected by the stellar wind conditions above 200 km. Garcia-Sage et al. (2017) explored enhancement of polar wind losses for a magnetized planet and showed that a 1 bar Earth-like atmosphere could be lost within 365 million years at Proxima Cen b's position, although the current calculated loss rate of H2+ and O2+ did not exceed Earth's current replenishment rate via outgassing and volatile delivery (Holland, 2002), so that maintenance of the atmosphere might be possible. Garcia-Sage et al. (2017) concluded that the habitability of Proxima Cen b requires a different atmospheric history to that of Earth, and indeed none of the above studies considered lifetimes for atmospheres significantly more massive than the current Earth's.\n\nOther processes that may inhibit atmospheric loss also need to be considered, such as cooling to space from upper-atmosphere CO2 (Tian, 2009) or shielding via formation of ozone from high-O2 atmospheres. In all cases for atmospheric loss, the resultant atmosphere is dependent on a number of factors including the initial atmospheric inventory, and atmospheric replenishment processes, such as cometary volatile delivery and volcanic outgassing, over the planet's lifetime. In the case of Earth, 80–95% of our volatiles outgassed within the first 50–500 million years (Turner, 1989), but an ocean of water may have remained in the mantle (Albarède, 2009; Sleep et al., 2012), which is being more slowly outgassed. If a similar process works for terrestrial planets orbiting M dwarfs, then these planets would be susceptible to significant loss of water and atmosphere early on, but may, over billions of years, accumulate a surface ocean and atmosphere from volcanic outgassing, after the M dwarf has settled into its more benign main sequence phase.\n\nHowever, if enough atmosphere is lost via interaction with the star, then the entire atmosphere could potentially be removed by condensation on the cold nightside. This is more likely if the planet is synchronously rotating, and atmospheric transport processes are weak or inefficient (Joshi et al., 1997; Wordsworth, 2015). However, Turbet et al. (2016) used 3-D climate models to show that, if Proxima Cen b retained an ocean, this form of atmospheric collapse into nightside or polar ice is highly unlikely, even if the planet is synchronously rotating. In the worst possible case on a dry, synchronously rotating planet, 4 bar of CO2 would be required to avoid atmospheric collapse and only 0.1 bar of CO2 for the asynchronously rotating case. Significantly less CO2 (as low as a few hundred parts per million) is required if a plausible background gas such as N2 were present (Turbet et al., 2016).\n\nIf, however, the atmosphere survived and is currently Earth-like, protons released via repeated flaring events would destroy any incipient ozone layer, resulting in high surface UV fluxes during flare activity (Segura et al., 2010; M. Tilley, private communication). For even the strongest flares exhibited by Proxima Cen b, which are comparable to the great AD Leo flare (Hawley and Pettersen, 1991; Hawley et al., 2003), previous calculations suggest that UV damage to life can be avoided on an ocean-bearing world at water depths of 9 m or more, while still allowing photosynthesis (Kiang et al., 2007). The resultant flux of photosynthetically active radiation would still be several orders of magnitude above the lower limit for useful light levels set by red algae, but the productivity of such a biosphere would be significantly lower than on Earth, with an estimated 4% of Earth's productivity for a star with AD Leo–type flares (Kiang et al., 2007).\n\nProxima Cen b's close-in orbit also makes the planet more vulnerable to gravitational tidal interaction with the star (Jackson et al., 2008), which falls off rapidly with semimajor axis, as a−7.5. Over time, the star could have circularized Proxima Cen b's orbit, trapped it into synchronous rotation, reduced the semimajor axis, and set the obliquity to zero (Barnes et al., 2008, 2009; Heller et al., 2011). However, if Proxima Cen b's orbit has even a small eccentricity, possibly due to a companion planet or a recent perturbation due to a stellar encounter, then the gravitational interaction with the star can induce “tidal heating” due to friction as the body of the planet is flexed due to differential gravitational fields at different points in its orbit (Barnes et al., 2009). Sufficiently high levels of tidal heating could result in surface heat fluxes on the planet that could evaporate oceans of water on the planetary surface (Barnes et al., 2013). Our initial simulations suggest that by 3 billion years ago, for a starting eccentricity close to 0.1, the orbit should have evolved to be currently close to circular (unless it is being perturbed by another planet), in which case the planet is experiencing very little internal heating from tidal forces (Barnes et al., 2018). However, these forces would have been much more significant in the past, exceeding that of the volcanically active Io for the first billion years of the planet's existence (Barnes et al., 2018). However, these heat fluxes fall far short of those required to trigger a runaway greenhouse (Barnes et al., 2013). Instead, the heat deposited into the mantle of the planet may have reduced circulation in the planet's interior and shut down the generation of a protective magnetic field (Driscoll and Barnes, 2015), which could have left the atmosphere more vulnerable to erosion.\n\nAdditional considerations for factors that could affect the habitability of Proxima Cen b include the fact that the orbit of Proxima Cen, in relation to α Cen A and B, is very poorly constrained (cf. Wertheimer and Laughlin, 2006; Matvienko and Orlov, 2014). If this orbit takes Proxima Cen closer to its two companions, then the orbit of Proxima Cen b could have been significantly perturbed, resulting in large changes in eccentricity. The existing RV data allows for eccentricity values up to 0.35 for Proxima Cen b's orbit (Anglada-Escudé et al., 2016), which could be the result of the above mechanism or an unseen companion planet (Barnes et al., 2018). Tidally locked exoplanets with eccentric orbits have a much higher probability of being captured into orbital resonance than synchronous rotation (e.g., Rodríguez et al., 2012; Ribas et al., 2016), with eccentricities as low as 0.07 making resonances extremely likely (Ribas et al., 2016; their ). In our solar system, Mercury, which is tidally locked with e = 0.21, is in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance. An eccentric orbit would have made Proxima Centauri b vulnerable to climatic swings (Williams and Kasting, 1997; Williams and Pollard, 2002; Dressing et al., 2010), catastrophic tidal heating (Barnes et al., 2013), and the shutdown of the magnetic field (Driscoll and Barnes, 2015), which could have made atmospheric escape more likely. This disruption of Proxima Cen b's orbit could have occurred at any time in the past and is difficult to predict from the current position of the three stars. On the other hand, as discussed above, orbital instabilities caused by close passage to α Cen A and B may protect extreme water loss during its star's pre-main sequence phase if these instabilities transferred the planet into its current orbit from a more distant one after the pre-main sequence phase ended. Perturbations from stellar encounters could also enhance habitability via impacts, which may generate atmospheric blowoff of a dense H2 envelope, or deliver volatiles to the planet after formation or after the pre-main sequence phase.\n\nIn summary, based on our current knowledge of M dwarf–planet interactions, there are several plausible scenarios for the environmental state of Proxima Cen b: an abiotic O2-rich atmosphere, a CO2-rich atmosphere, and a habitable terrestrial environment. Note that early total loss of an atmosphere—without generation or retention of a secondary atmosphere from outgassing—may also be a possible outcome, but we do not consider it for our atmospheric modeling activities. In the abiotic O2-rich scenarios, Proxima Cen b formed at or close to its current position and suffered catastrophic water loss during the star's superluminous pre-main sequence phase. The resulting steam atmosphere was photolyzed, and H was lost to space. O2, and possibly remnant water, was left behind, so there could be two cases from this scenario: O2-rich without water and O2-rich with water (Luger and Barnes, 2015). Similarly, if massive water loss occurs, and O2 is lost either via hydrodynamic escape or sequestration in the planet's crust or mantle, or via a magma ocean, then CO2 may be the dominant gas that persists in the atmosphere. In this case, the atmosphere may consist of remnant O2 and outgassed CO2, CO2-rich and largely desiccated (Venus-like), or a CO2-dominated, highly desiccated planet (H < 1ppm) which produces a stable CO/CO2/O2 atmosphere (Gao et al., 2015). Finally, in the habitable terrestrial environment scenario, Proxima Cen b was a terrestrial body that migrated to its current orbit after the pre-main sequence phase through instability processes, or formed with a protective H2 layer of no more than 1% of the solid mass of the object, either because a terrestrial planet formed in situ with that envelope or because a more volatile and H2-rich planet migrated inward from beyond the snowline. That H2 envelope could have been sufficiently thick to protect the volatile-rich planet underneath during the superluminous pre-main sequence phase but not thick enough to remain and compromise the planet's habitability (Owen and Mohanty, 2016). For these cases, the resultant planet could have had a strongly oxidizing atmosphere, or one that was more reducing, depending on where in the planetary system it formed and how it evolved. Much of the analysis of these scenarios presented here is applicable not just to Proxima Cen b but to potentially habitable worlds orbiting other M dwarfs like those recently found in the TRAPPIST-1 (Gillon et al., 2017) and LHS 1140 (Dittmann et al., 2017) systems.\n\n2.2. Impact of planetary characteristics and star-planet interactions on climate\n\nA planet in the habitable zone can be impacted by the host star's incident spectrum, activity levels, and orbital and tidal interactions. Each of these agents, when interacting with the planet's environment, can strongly impact the current environmental state of the planet, including its atmospheric composition, climate, and potential habitability. For example, the planet's current climate and potentially enhanced ability to maintain surface liquid water are strongly impacted by the interaction of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the M dwarf star with the planet's atmospheric and surface composition (Shields et al., 2013), any clouds or hazes (Arney et al., 2016, 2017), and the planet's orbital parameters and obliquity (Barnes et al., 2013; Armstrong et al., 2014). In particular, the UV spectrum of the star is critically important for understanding the planet's photochemistry—and therefore the atmospheric composition and climate (Segura et al., 2005; Rugheimer et al., 2015). It is also the key to interpretation of any spectra obtained from the planet. The stellar UV also affects whether or not a UV-absorbing haze will form in a reducing atmosphere (Arney et al., 2017) or an ozone layer in an oxidizing atmosphere (Segura et al., 2005; Domagal-Goldman et al., 2014). The presence and strength of these UV shields will affect the resultant surface UV flux, which could in turn strongly impact habitability. Sufficiently high UV flux could potentially sterilize the land surfaces, although life may still be adequately shielded in an ocean as previously mentioned (Kiang et al., 2007). Stellar flaring activity can also greatly increase stellar UV flux and eject protons, which collide with the planet's atmosphere and drive NOx chemistry in the stratosphere, potentially damaging or destroying an ozone layer (Segura et al., 2010; M. Tilley, private communication), though the extent to which O3 is destroyed would be dependent on the activity level (Grenfell et al., 2012). Additionally, HOx chemistry driven by stellar cosmic rays may efficiently destroy methane and, in combination with NOx chemistry, generate potentially detectable quantities of HNO3 (Tabataba-Vakili et al., 2016). Consequently, to assess the current environmental state of the planet, and to interpret any spectra obtained of this object, one of the first steps in planet characterization will be to observe and monitor the UV characteristics and activity of the host star.\n\nDue to the gravitational tidal interactions described above, a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone around an M dwarf star should be tidally locked, and if it has a circular orbit, may be synchronously rotating, with one side of the planet constantly facing the star. This was originally hypothesized to preclude planetary habitability, as the planet's atmosphere would eventually freeze out on the eternal nightside of the planet (Kasting et al., 1993); however, subsequent modeling showed that the presence of a planetary atmosphere of sufficient density would protect against atmospheric collapse onto the dark side (Joshi et al., 1997; Goldblatt, 2016). Leconte et al. (2015) discussed how thermal tides in the planetary atmosphere may cause asynchronous rotation of tidally locked planets. However, Proxima Cen b is currently observationally constrained to have an eccentricity <0.35 (Anglada-Escudé et al., 2016), which does not yet discriminate between a circular orbit with a likely synchronous rotational state and an eccentric orbit with a likely asynchronous rotational state. While models of Proxima Cen b's interaction with its star suggest that the planet is still more likely to be synchronously rotating under most assumptions for orbital position and atmospheric mass, existence in an asynchronous 3:2 spin-orbit resonance (similar to Mercury's) is also possible (Ribas et al., 2016; Turbet et al., 2016), and this possibility is increased if Proxima Cen b has companions in its planetary system (Barnes et al., 2018).\n\n2.3. Identifying planetary habitability\n\nGiven the diversity of plausible evolutionary scenarios discussed above, and the star-planet interactions that may sculpt the current environment of the planet, one of the biggest questions posed for Proxima Cen b is, “How do we determine whether or not this planet is habitable?” Habitability can be assessed most straightforwardly by detecting liquid water on the planetary surface. This could be done by using photometric measurements of the distant planet at visible or near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths to search for signs of enhanced reflectivity near crescent phase due to the presence of ocean “glint” (Williams and Gaidos, 2008; Robinson et al., 2010, 2014). Glint is specular reflectance at glancing angles from a smooth surface (Cox and Munk, 1954), which on a terrestrial planet is most likely to come from a liquid—since rock, snow, and snow-covered ice tend to have nonspecular scattering properties.\n\nRobinson et al. (2010) used a sophisticated 3-D spectral model of Earth (Robinson et al., 2011), validated against the EPOXI mission (Livengood et al., 2011) and Earthshine (Pallé et al., 2003) observations of the disk-averaged Earth, to show that Earth deviates strongly from Lambertian (i.e., isotropic) scattering behavior at phases crescent-ward of quadrature. While a similar deviation from Lambertian behavior can occur due to forward scattering from clouds, Robinson et al. (2010) were able to show that an Earth-like planet with realistic (∼50% coverage) forward-scattering water clouds and a specularly reflecting ocean is up to a factor of two brighter than an Earth-like planet with forward-scattering clouds and a Lambertian ocean near crescent phase. This increase in relative brightness due to ocean glint is most apparent between phase angles of 90 and 130 degrees, and is most readily observable at wavelengths between 0.8 and 0.9 μm where Earth's atmosphere is relatively transparent (Robinson et al., 2010, 2014). Consequently, glint from Earth's ocean is potentially detectable as a deviation in the observed reflectivity of the planet near crescent phase, even in the presence of forward-scattering clouds. A potential false positive for ocean glint may occur if the observer is preferentially sounding ice- and/or cloud-covered portions of the planet near crescent phases (Cowan et al., 2015), although this effect may be distinguishable with spectroscopic measurements. Glint may also polarize incident starlight, which could potentially induce a signal in the planet's polarimetric light curve. Williams and Gaidos (2008) used idealized models to show that cloud-free ocean planets with nonpolarizing atmospheres may exhibit a strong (30–70%) polarization signal over an orbit. However, Rayleigh scattering and clouds are also a source of polarization, possibly overwhelming the signal due to a surface ocean (Zugger et al., 2010, 2011) and making it difficult to use polarization to identify water under an atmosphere.\n\nNote that glint is far less ambiguous for surface water detection than the presence of water vapor in the planetary atmosphere, as a planet may maintain a steam atmosphere without being habitable. “Anti-ocean” signatures may also be present in the form of highly soluble gases, for example, SO2, that would dissolve in an ocean and would not accumulate in the atmosphere unless there was no ocean (or the ocean was already saturated with that gas). Conversely, false negatives for the detection of water can occur, especially in transmission observations, if the water is cold-trapped in the troposphere of a habitable planet, resulting in an appropriately drier stratosphere. Water that is kept near the surface is most valuable for habitability and less susceptible to loss processes. In this case, clouds and refraction in transmission (Bétrémieux and Kaltenegger, 2013, 2014; Misra and Meadows, 2014; Misra et al., 2014b) limit our ability to probe into the relatively water-rich troposphere, where water is more likely to be detected. Drier stratospheres are less likely to affect direct imaging observations, however, except in the presence of high-altitude, planetwide clouds. Even in the presence of broken cloud cover, or some planetwide hazes, direct imaging observations can still sample the lower atmosphere and surface to detect water vapor (Arney et al., 2016).\n\nAnother means to assess habitability is to constrain the surface temperature and pressure to determine whether surface liquid water is feasible. This is best assessed with spectra of the planet in the visible and NIR and/or photometry or spectra in the mid-infrared (MIR). While a Rayleigh scattering slope from atmospheric molecules has been proposed as a means of determining atmospheric pressure for a terrestrial planet (Arnold et al., 2002; Woolf et al., 2002; Benneke and Seager, 2012) this method—like all methods for atmospheric pressure assessment—is not robust in the presence of cloud or haze cover, either complete or partial. At best it will return the pressure at the top of the clouds in the former and an average of the cloud top altitudes and surface in the latter. This is graphically demonstrated in our solar system by Venus, which has a 93 bar surface pressure but exhibits extremely weak Rayleigh scattering, because the line of sight into the atmosphere is truncated by sulfuric acid haze at an altitude of 70 km and a pressure near 30 mbar. In direct imaging, which looks at planetary reflectivity, attempts to measure Rayleigh scattering are additionally vulnerable to the spectral properties of the underlying aerosols and surfaces. On Mars, strong absorption by surface iron oxide absorbs Rayleigh scattering in the blue. Similarly, for a CO2- and CH4-rich early-Earth-like atmosphere, the formation of a hydrocarbon haze results in strong absorption in the UV and blue, strongly altering the Rayleigh signature (Arney et al., 2016, 2017).\n\nA potentially more promising means for determining atmospheric pressure comes from measurements of collisional absorption from molecules such as N2 (Schwieterman et al., 2015b) and O2 (Tinetti et al., 2006; Pallé et al., 2009; Misra et al., 2014a), which are both seen in Earth's disk-averaged spectrum. Unlike Rayleigh scattering, which is degenerate in terms of characterizing the mix of gases that are producing the scattering, observations of collisional absorption can provide a direct measurement of the atmosphere's bulk constituents. However, this method is also subject to path length truncation due to clouds and so will return a composite pressure depending on the available path lengths to clouds and the surface. In the case of O2, observations of the O2 molecule can be compared to the strength of the absorption band produced by the O2-O2 collisional pair (also referred to as O4)—which is sensitive to density squared—to quantify the partial pressure of oxygen in the atmosphere (Misra et al., 2014a). The presence of strong O4 bands in the visible (0.35–0.65 μm) is diagnostic of massive O2 atmospheres (Schwieterman et al., 2016).\n\nIn addition to searching for oceans and determining surface temperature and pressure, habitability could be assessed by undertaking a spectroscopic survey of greenhouse gases and other planetary characteristics that affect climate. In particular, retrieving abundances for greenhouse gases such as CO2, CH4, H2O, SO2, O3, and N2O; obtaining pressure estimates using observations of O4 and N4 (the N2-N2 collisional pair); and searching for and characterizing hazes and clouds will provide important constraints on planetary climate. These observations could then be used as input to coupled climate and photochemistry models (e.g., Segura et al., 2005) to understand the composition of the atmosphere, and the surface temperature and pressure.\n\nIt is important to note that, for terrestrial planets with CO2 (distinct from Titan, whose atmosphere is extremely reducing), methane and organic hazes could also be a sign of either habitability or life (Arney et al., 2016). Methane in a planet's atmosphere can produce organic haze if the CH4/CO2 ratio exceeds 0.1, and these hazes dramatically impact their planet's spectrum. Higher carbon dioxide levels make haze formation more difficult, so larger fluxes of methane are needed to produce haze in the atmospheres of planets with larger CO2 inventories compared to very reducing atmospheres like Titan. Hazes in Earth-like atmospheres containing CO2 can therefore be a sign of a high methane production rate. Methane can be sourced from either biological or abiotic processes, but even abiotic methane is a potential habitability marker, as its dominant source on an Earth-like planet is serpentinization—which are liquid water/rock reactions (Kelley et al., 2005). Serpentinization requires freshly exposed seafloor minerals to react, and while a limited area could be obtained from cracking, new seafloor crust would likely be needed for the maintenance of robust serpentinization on long timescales. Consequently, atmospheric methane concentrations requiring large surface fluxes on a terrestrial planet may indicate both liquid water and plate tectonics, two hallmarks of habitability. More intriguingly, existing measurements and models suggest that the presence of an organic haze on an Earthlike exoplanet with >1% CO2 in the atmosphere may require more vigorous methane production rates than occur on Earth from abiotic processes alone (Kharecha et al., 2005; Etiope and Sherwood Lollar, 2013; Guzmán-Marmolejo et al., 2013), so organic haze in an Earth-like atmosphere could also be suggestive of life if the CO2 abundance can also be constrained (Arney et al., 2016).\n\n2.4. Biosignature considerations for planets orbiting M dwarfs\n\nExoplanet biosignatures are biological modifications of a planet's global environment that are potentially observable over interstellar distances. On Earth, biosignatures can be classified into three major groups: atmospheric gases that are produced by life, such as Earth's abundant photosynthetically generated O2 (Hitchcock and Lovelock, 1967); surface reflectivity signatures like the enhanced “red edge” reflectivity at wavelengths longward of 0.7 μm from vegetation (Gates et al.,1965) or nonphotosynthetic pigments from other organisms (Schwieterman et al., 2015a); and time-dependent phenomena, such as seasonal changes in surface coverage or atmospheric gases (Meadows, 2008).\n\nFor planets orbiting M dwarfs, the UV spectrum and stellar activity of the star can work via photochemistry to either enhance or destroy the detectability of potential atmospheric biosignatures. Segura et al. (2005) showed that, for Earth-like surface fluxes of the biogenic gases CH4 and N2O, extremely large abundances of these gases can build up in a terrestrial planet atmosphere. In particular, the lifetime and abundance of atmospheric methane is increased from 10–12 years and 1.6 ppm for an Earth-like atmosphere orbiting a Sun-like star to over 200 years and over 300 ppm for a planet orbiting the M3.5V star AD Leo. This is due in large part to the slope of the M dwarf's UV spectrum, which has smaller relative amounts of NUV radiation, and its subsequent relative inefficiency at photolyzing ozone to produce reactive O(1D) that generates the OH from water vapor that ultimately destroys CH4 (Segura et al., 2005). On a related note, Segura et al. showed that for the same atmospheric O2 abundance, ozone column density could be larger or smaller than Earth's by roughly a factor of 2, again depending on the UV spectrum of the star. However, these calculations were performed for quiescent versions of M dwarf spectra. Segura et al. (2010) explored the effect on a planetary atmosphere of large flares, looking at both UV and proton flux on the thickness of an Earth-like planet's ozone layer. For the single flare that they studied, they found that the UV flux had negligible effect on the thickness of the ozone layer, dropping it by of order 1%. However, if the planet intercepted the proton beam from the coronal mass ejection, and did not have a protective magnetic field, the effect on the ozone was devastating, as proton-driven NOx chemistry from this single flare resulted in a 94% depletion of the ozone layer over a 2-year period (Segura et al., 2010). Consequently, both the stellar spectrum and activity levels need to be well-characterized as an adjunct to interpreting potential biosignatures from planets orbiting M dwarfs.\n\nOther important considerations when interpreting biosignatures of M dwarf planets are the likely detectability of the biosignature gas in question, as well as the likelihood that the planetary environment could produce the biosignature gas without life being present, and thereby exhibit a false positive for the biosignature. Oxygen is a particularly good gas for this discussion, as it has been well studied as a potential biosignature (see Meadows, 2017, for a comprehensive review). Oxygen is produced by photosynthetic organisms on Earth and is particularly attractive as a biosignature gas because it is present in high abundance, is evenly mixed throughout the atmosphere—and so can potentially be detected in the stratosphere by transmission observations—and has strong absorption bands at UV and NIR wavelengths where the first generation of exoplanet telescopes will observe. More exotic potential biosignatures, including organic sulfur compounds (e.g., Domagal-Goldman et al., 2011) are likely to be at lower abundances and be more sensitive to photolysis, so that they are confined closer to the planetary surface. These molecules also tend to absorb predominantly in the MIR, which may be challenging to access for terrestrial planets with upcoming telescopes. However, to offset its advantages as a biosignature, oxygen is now known to have false-positive production mechanisms—abiotic processes that can also produce O2 in a planetary environment—and the majority of those mechanisms currently known are thought to be more likely to occur for planets orbiting M dwarfs (Domagal-Goldman and Meadows, 2010; Domagal-Goldman et al., 2014; Tian et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2015, Harman et al., 2015; Luger and Barnes, 2015). For these mechanisms, carbon dioxide and water vapor serve as key sources of abiotic oxygen, and the spectrum of the host star and the resultant photochemistry play a significant role, leaving telltale signs in the planetary atmosphere that can be sought to discriminate between biological and abiotic sources for oxygen (Meadows, 2017). In particular, two of the possible atmospheres for Proxima Cen b discussed above—including the massive O2 atmospheres generated from water loss (Luger and Barnes, 2015) and the CO2-rich, desiccated atmospheres that may contain large, stable O2 fractions (Gao et al., 2015)—are both potential false positives for biologically produced oxygen. However, both may be discriminated by searching for either O4 absorption or both CO and CO2 absorption in the planetary spectrum (Schwieterman et al., 2016). These studies show the importance of obtaining contextual information about the planetary environment and provide a guide to increasing our confidence in biosignature detection by searching for additional gases and planetary characteristics.\n\n3. Models\n\nWe use a suite of planetary climate and photochemistry models to simulate the current environmental state for the evolutionary scenarios described in Sections 1 and 2. We then use a radiative transfer model to predict the potentially observable photometric and spectral parameters that would help discriminate between these environmental states. These models and the stellar and surface albedo inputs are described in the sections below. shows a summary of all models used in this study.\n\nTable 1.\n\nModel nameTypeModel subcomponents/dependenciesUseReferencesLBLABCAbsorption coefficients for SMARTn/aGenerate SMART inputs from linelistsMeadows and Crisp, 1996SMART1-D radiative transferLBLABCReflected light spectraMeadows and Crisp, 1996; Crisp, 1997VPL ClimateClimate modelLBLABC, SMART radiative transfer coreClimate simulationsThis paper; Ty Robinson and David Crisp, private communicationAtmos1-D photochemical-climate modelPhotochemical model, climate model componentsClimate and/or photochemical simulationsArney et al.,2016SMART-T1-D radiative transfer–transitsLBLABC, SMART radiative transfer core paired with ScaTrans moduleTransit spectraRobinson, 2017SMART Phase CurvesPhase curve modelLBLABC, SMART radiative transfer corePhase curvesThis paperCoronagraph noise modelInstrument simulatorn/aAdd realistic noise for simulated observations to spectraRobinson et al.,2016\n\n3.1. SMART—direct imaging synthetic spectra\n\nThe SMART (Spectral Mapping Atmospheric Radiative Transfer) code is a 1-D line-by-line, multistream, fully multiple scattering radiative transfer model (described in detail in Meadows and Crisp, 1996, and Crisp, 1997) that computes accurate synthetic planetary spectra. SMART combines a multilevel, multistream discrete ordinate algorithm (Stamnes et al., 1988) with a new class of high-resolution spectral mapping techniques to increase computational speed. SMART is used in this study to generate synthetic planetary spectra for both direct imaging and, through the SMART-T modification, for transmission spectroscopy. It also serves as the radiative transfer engine for phase curve generation and for the VPL Climate model. We have validated SMART against observations of Solar System planets, including Mars, Earth, and Venus (Tinetti et al., 2005; Robinson et al., 2011; Arney et al., 2014). SMART requires a number of user inputs, which are described in detail in Section 3.7, such as a pressure/altitude-temperature grid, gas mixing ratios, molecular absorption coefficients, collision-induced absorption data, UV-visible absorption cross sections, a stellar spectrum, and wavelength-dependent surface albedo data. The absorption coefficients for SMART are generated with a separate program called LBLABC (see Section 3.7.4, below) from input line lists (i.e., HITRAN 2012, Rothman et al., 2013; HITEMP 2010, Rothman et al., 2010; and Ames, Huang et al., 2014). SMART can also incorporate the radiative impact of aerosols such as hazes and clouds, by specifying the altitude-dependent optical depths as well as the particle asymmetry parameter and the extinction, scattering, and absorption efficiencies (Qext, Qscat, and Qabs). SMART can generate spectra at any arbitrary spectral resolution, and its results are valid from the UV to the far-infrared.\n\n3.2. SMART-T—transit transmission spectra\n\nAlthough Proxima Cen b may not transit (Kipping et al., 2017), the simulations provided here for its plausible environments are potentially relevant to habitable zone planets orbiting late-type M dwarfs that do transit, including the recently discovered TRAPPIST-1 system (Gillon et al., 2016, 2017), where TRAPPIST-1e occupies a similar position in its habitable zone to Proxima Centauri b. Consequently, we simulate transmission as well as direct imaging observations for Proxima Centauri b. To generate the transit transmission spectra, we use the SMART-T model, which updates our original refraction transmission model (Misra and Meadows, 2014; Misra et al., 2014b) by pairing SMART with the full-physics transmission code ScaTrans (Robinson, 2017), which includes the effects of both refraction and transmission. Our new version of SMART-T uses the normal-incidence optical depths of SMART to calculate transmission for a grid of limb-traversing atmospheric paths, which are then integrated over the planetary disk to produce a transit spectrum. The model takes into account the effects of refraction by using the path integration method of van der Werf (2008). Starlight refracted out of the beam of an observer sets a limit on the tangent altitudes at which the atmosphere can be probed (Sidis and Sari, 2010; García Muñoz et al., 2012; Misra and Meadows, 2014; Misra et al., 2014b). SMART-T requires the same inputs as the standard SMART code but additionally requires the radius of the host star, the offset of the planet center from the middle of the star (i.e., the impact parameter), and the altitude-dependent refractivity of the atmosphere. For all transmission spectra presented here, an impact parameter of 0 is assumed, implying the planet is centered on the host stellar disk. We did not use the multiple-scattering capabilities of SMART-T for the spectra presented here, as an initial investigation into the geometry of the problem and the scattering properties of our included aerosols showed that a multiple-scattering calculation was unwarranted.\n\n3.3. SMART phase curves\n\nWe use the SMART Phase Curve model (developed by T. Robinson and D. Crisp) to calculate the multiband, orbital phase-variability of a planet in reflected and emitted light. This model uses n-point Gaussian quadrature to generate a phase-dependent, disk-integrated spectrum of the planet. Wavelength-dependent radiances at a grid of solar and observer zenith and azimuth angles at Gaussian quadrature are computed by SMART, where the zenith angles form the abscissa for a Gaussian integral computed over the surface of a sphere. The corresponding weights for the integration are determined based on the longitudes of the planetary disk that are visible and illuminated as seen by the observer. We apply this disk integration over a grid of observed planetary phase angles to simulate high-resolution, phase-dependent spectra, which are convolved with JWST/MIRI broadband photometric filters to determine the detectability of the planet's phase variability against the bright stellar background in the MIR.\n\nOur focus is on the phase dependence of the planet due to the vertically resolved atmospheric structure atop a reflecting and emitting surface, and not on the spatially resolved features accessible with a General Circulation Model (GCM). Therefore, the distinguishing observables from one plausible planetary state to another are limited to bulk surface and atmospheric characteristics, such as deviations from Lambertian scattering due to the presence of forward-scattering aerosols or the presence of ocean glint (Robinson et al., 2010, 2014), modulations in the peak amplitude of phase curves as a function of wavelength due to molecular features (Selsis et al., 2011; Stevenson et al., 2014), and thermal phase curve amplitudes due to a day-night temperature contrast. We are not using a GCM in this study, and we have not made self-consistent predictions for the day-night temperature contrast. To simulate phase curves with a thermal emission contribution from the nightside of the planet, we use our self-consistent globally averaged surface temperature, assuming no day-night temperature contrast and extremely efficient heat redistribution (e.g., Venus). We also simulate cases where we assume no thermal contribution from the nightside of the planet to simulate the maximum day-night temperature contrast, and severely inefficient heat redistribution more appropriate for an airless body (Maurin et al., 2012). In this way, we assess the extreme end-member cases for the phase curve amplitude. We also simulate an intermediate case where the nightside surface temperature and temperature-pressure profile is 20 K lower than the dayside to emphasize a plausible phase curve amplitude.\n\n3.4. Instrument simulators and noise model\n\nWe use a general coronagraph instrument noise model to simulate directly imaged reflectivity spectra for the atmospheric states considered in this work. We refer the reader to Robinson et al. (2016) for a thorough description of the model. In brief, the coronagraph instrument noise model computes wavelength-dependent photon count rates on the detector due to the planet, zodiacal and exozodiacal light, dark current, read noise, speckles, and thermal emission from the mirror. The model also considers the CCD quantum efficiency of assumed detectors, the dependence of dark current on the NIR detector due to detector temperature, and a factor of √2 increase in the shot noise due to the spacecraft roll maneuver required for background subtraction (see Brown, 2005). With the coronagraph noise model, we simulate observations using three future telescope concepts: a space-based 16 m LUVOIR, a space-based 6.5 m HabEx, and a ground-based 30 m telescope assumed to be located in the Atacama Desert, Chile.\n\nTo model ground-based observations, we modified the coronagraph noise model to account for transmission through and downwelling emission from Earth's atmosphere. The wavelength-dependent transmissivity of the Earth atmosphere is calculated with the SMART model (see ) and is used to model the effect of telluric absorption such that incident exoplanetary photons are attenuated at high-opacity wavelengths. The sky brightness noise term makes use of the ESO SkyCalc Sky Model Calculator5, which is based on the Cerro Paranal Advanced Sky Model (Noll et al., 2012). Sky brightness includes contributions from molecular emission from the lower atmosphere, emission lines from the upper atmosphere, airglow, and scattered starlight, but neglects scattered moonlight, which is dependent on time of observation, and zodiacal light, which is already included in the nominal coronagraph model (Robinson et al., 2016). The downwelling thermal emission from the sky begins to dominate at wavelengths beyond 2.5 microns. For a 30 m telescope, the continuum sky brightness is only ∼2% of the planetary brightness in the PSF core (Hanuschik, 2003). We approximate a sub-optimal Strehl ratio by lowering the planetary flux inside the PSF core by an additional 50% to account for the effects of atmospheric turbulence. We assume a cold planetary surface temperature (269 K) and an observing zenith angle of 30°, which corresponds to the altitude of Proxima Centauri crossing the meridian at La Silla Observatory, Chile. The telescope, instrument, and astrophysical parameters used to simulate coronagraph observations are identical to those given in Robinson et al. (2016; astrophysical in their , telescope and instrument in their ), except for telescope diameter, detector temperature, raw contrast, and telescope plus instrument throughput, which are presented here in .\n\nTable 2.\n\nParameter descriptionHabExLUVOIR30 mTelescope diameter6.5 m16 m30 mMirror/System temperature270 K270 K270 KContrast10−1010−1010−10Telescope + Instrument Throughput20%20%20%\n\nTable 3.\n\nWavelength Range [Å]Platform/InstrumentObservation ID/References1200–1215,1216–1691HST/STISao5eo01010[20,30], o5eo02010[20,40]1215–1216HST/STIS Ly α reconstructionMUSCLESb1691–4569HST/STISMUSCLESb4569–8499HST/FOD/RDaY2WY0705T, Y2WY0305Tλ > 8499PHOENIX 2.0 ModelHusser et al. (2013)\n\n3.5. VPL Climate model\n\nOur new 1-D radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) climate model (Ty Robinson and David Crisp, private communication) incorporates our physically comprehensive, validated radiative transfer model, SMART, which is coupled with a variety of convection and time-stepping methods to determine the equilibrium pressure-temperature structure of an atmosphere. Since our radiative fluxes are computed by using SMART's multistream solver, we avoid inaccuracies that can impact models that use δ 2-stream approximations (Kitzmann et al., 2013). Note that VPL Climate, at present, does not include integration with atmospheric chemistry tools. Therefore, we present results from this model only for cases for which our other 1-D climate model, Atmos (see Section 3.6), lacks key capabilities, such as for high-pressure atmospheres.\n\nNet radiative fluxes in VPL Climate are computed by using a first-order linearized flux-adding approach (Robinson and Crisp, private communication). Full line-by-line, multistream, multiscattering solar and thermal radiative fluxes are computed by SMART, as well as a set of Jacobians that describe the response of the radiative fluxes to changes in key elements in the atmospheric state vector (e.g., layer and surface temperatures). These Jacobians consist of derivatives of the layer-by-layer, wavelength-dependent stellar and thermal source terms, as well as derivatives of layer reflectivity, transmissivity, and absorptivity. This information is used in a linear flux-adding approach to determine the upwelling and downwelling solar and thermal flux profiles at each timestep. If during timestepping the evolved atmospheric state (e.g., the temperature in any given layer) is outside the linear range of the Jacobians, additional iterations of computing Jacobians can be required. The tolerance for the perturbation for computing Jacobians is set by the user, which can be large when starting from an isothermal atmosphere (e.g., 50%) or small when near convergence (e.g., <1%). Since VPL Climate uses SMART to compute fluxes at extremely high spectral resolution, spectral quantities in our flux-adding approach are degraded to a lower resolution (typically 10 cm−1) by convolution with a slit function, which still provides thousands of wavelength intervals.\n\nOur VPL Climate model can implement convection in a number of ways; here, we use mixing length theory (e.g., Gierasch and Goody, 1968), which uses fundamental physical properties for each layer of the atmosphere and requires few assumptions. The required assumptions include surface wind speed U0 and mixing length zmix(z), which we calculate for each layer using the asymptotic mixing length calculation from Blackadar (1962):\n\nwhere R is the specific gas constant (ideal gas constant/molecular weight of gas), z is altitude, T(z) is temperature, g(z) is the acceleration due to gravity, κ is von Kármán's constant, and fz is the mixing length proportionality constant, which must be specified. Convective heat transport is computed at every layer from eddy diffusion rates in convectively unstable layers. Convective stability is determined by using the Schwarzchild criterion:\n\nwhere g(z) is the acceleration of gravity, cP(T(z)) is the specific heat of the atmospheric layer, and Γad is the dry adiabatic lapse rate. For moist cases (comparing to the results of Turbet et al., 2016), we use the moist adiabatic lapse rate for the troposphere, to simulate the effect of condensation and rainfall:\n\nwhere Hv is the latent heat of vaporization of water (2.5 × 106 J K−1), r(z) is the layer-dependent mixing ratio of water, and Rw is the specific gas constant of water vapor (461.5 J kg−1 K−1). The specific heat for common molecules is used from laboratory data6 (water vapor, CO2, N2O, CO, CH4, O2, N2, NO, SO2, NO2, NH3, HCl, N2, C2H2, C2H6, H2S, C2H4, CH3OH, and H2). Specific heat for molecules for which data is not available is computed by using an ideal gas law approximation and assuming cP is temperature-independent:\n\nwhere f is the number of degrees of freedom (i.e., 3 for atoms, 5 for diatomic molecules, and 6 for polyatomic molecules). The eddy diffusivity from Gierasch and Goody is\n\nwhere S(z) is the difference from Schwarzchild's criterion. Convective heat flux for each layer is calculated as\n\nCondensation and evaporation are taken into account by adjusting layer mixing ratios of condensable constituents and calculating the heating rate. We assume sufficient condensation nuclei for rapid and efficient condensation in supersaturated layers. Layers are assumed to be supersaturated when the partial pressure of a condensable is above its saturation vapor pressure. The required inputs for this optional feature are the saturation vapor temperature, pressure, and corresponding enthalpy of formation.\n\nThe timescales at which we resolve our mixing length model are small, consistent with the time it takes for an air parcel to rise one layer. Since radiative flux calculations are more computationally expensive, we employ a timestep splitting approach where many convective timesteps are resolved within each radiative timestep. Here, we use adaptive methods to calculate the maximum radiative and convective timesteps to more rapidly iterate the temperature-pressure profile to equilibrium. The limit for the radiative timestep is simply an allowed change in temperature for any given layer per timestep (e.g., 0.1 K), while mixing length theory provides for a maximum stable convective timestep in a single layer:\n\nWe take the smallest of these from all layers as the maximum convective timestep in the convective region.\n\nThe model atmosphere constructed for VPL Climate simulations generally consists of 64 plane-parallel layers in hydrostatic equilibrium, spanning from the surface pressure to 10−7 bar. Half the layers starting at the surface are spaced linearly and comprise 90% of the atmospheric pressure. Coarser, log-spaced layers span the upper atmosphere. Fluxes are computed for the entire stellar spectral energy distribution, divided into ∼8600 intervals, and thermal flux from the planet is computed for the wavelength range ∼1–200 μm, divided into ∼1000 intervals, all spaced at 10 cm−1. Gas absorption is computed in all intervals for which cross sections, collision-induced absorption, or line data are available from HITRAN.\n\nValidations of VPL Climate for Earth, Mars, and Venus have been conducted by Robinson and Crisp (private communication). In particular, our capability to produce Venus-like high-CO2 atmospheres is validated by the excellent match to the Venus International Reference Atmosphere by Robinson and Crisp (private communication), with a surface temperature of 732 K, compared to Venus' observed global average surface temperature of 733 K. These validations provide confidence that this model can be applied to a variety of planetary climates, including those we discuss for Proxima b. As a further validation, in Section 4.1 we also provide a cross comparison between the VPL Climate model and the LMDz model used by Turbet et al. (2016) for a subset of similar Proxima Cen b calculations.\n\n3.6. Atmos: a coupled climate-photochemical model\n\nWe use a 1-D photochemical-climate model, Atmos, to simulate photochemistry and climate of terrestrial planet environments. Atmos generates atmospheres that are both chemically and climatically self-consistent with the atmospheric composition, temperature profile, and incident stellar spectrum. To use Atmos, the photochemical model (which can include particle microphysics) is run first to generate an initial atmospheric state based on user-specified boundary conditions (i.e., gas mixing ratios or fluxes and deposition velocities, the stellar spectrum, the total atmospheric pressure, the initial temperature-pressure profile). The model is described in detail in Arney et al. (2016), and it is publicly available at https://github.com/VirtualPlanetaryLaboratory/atmos. Templates for atmospheres modeled in this paper (including their complete reaction rate lists and species lists) can be found in this repository. The modern Earth photochemical template (which we also use as the basis for our high-O2 simulations and template, although with different atmospheric boundary conditions) has 233 chemical reactions and includes 50 chemical species, 9 of which are short-lived (meaning atmospheric transport between layers is not considered). Our Archean Earth template includes 392 chemical reactions and 76 chemical species, 11 of which are short-lived. In both base templates, N2 and CO2 are assumed to have isoprofiles. Both templates include chemistry for sulfur aerosol formation, and the Archean template includes hydrocarbon haze formation chemistry.\n\nOnce the photochemical model reaches a converged state, the photochemical model feeds its outputs into the Atmos climate model. These outputs include the altitude-dependent abundances of H2O photochemically produced in, or transported to, the stratosphere (tropospheric H2O is calculated by the climate model), CO2, O3, CH4, O2, N2, and C2H6. The climate model uses the photochemical model's final state as its initial condition, and the models iterate in this manner until global convergence is reached. These coupling and convergence criteria are described in more detail in the work of Arney et al. (2016).\n\nThe photochemical portion of Atmos is based on the 1-D photochemical code originally developed by Kasting et al. (1979). The version we use here has been significantly modernized as described in the work of Zahnle et al. (2006) and can simulate a wide range of planetary redox states ranging from extremely anoxic (pO2 = 10−16) to 100 bar of O2 (Schwieterman et al., 2016). An organic haze formation scheme is in place for reducing, methane-rich atmospheres as described in the works of Pavlov et al. (2001), Zerkle et al. (2012), and Arney et al. (2016). For the simulations presented here, the model atmosphere is divided into 200 plane-parallel layers up to 100 km in altitude with a layer spacing of 0.5 km. Hydrostatic equilibrium is assumed. A vertical transport scheme includes molecular and eddy diffusion. Boundary conditions can be set for each species at the top and bottom of the atmosphere, including gaseous mixing ratios and/or fluxes in or out of the atmosphere. Radiative transfer in the photochemical model is done via a δ 2-stream method (Toon et al., 1989). The primary equations solved by the model are the continuity and flux equations, which are, in order,\n\nand\n\nwhere z is altitude (cm), t is model time (s), ni is the number density (cm−3) of species i, Pi is chemical production rate (in molecules cm−3 s−1), li is the chemical loss frequency (s−1), Φi is the flux of species i (cm2 s−1), fi is the mixing ratio of the species i (ni/n), K is the eddy diffusion coefficient (cm2 s−1), n is the total density, Di is the diffusion coefficient between the background atmospheres and species i, and αTi is the thermal diffusion coefficient between species i and the background atmosphere. Hi is the scale height of species i (note H = kT/mig). These equations are integrated by a variable timestep reverse Euler method appropriate for stiff systems. This method relaxes to the steady state solution when timesteps are large.\n\nThe climate portion of Atmos is based on the 1-D climate model originally developed by Kasting and Pollack (1983), Kasting et al. (1984a, 1984b), and Kasting and Ackerman (1986), but the version we use here has been significantly modernized and was recently used to simulate habitable zones around different stellar spectral types (Kopparapu et al., 2013). The model uses correlated-k coefficients to compute absorption by the spectrally active gases in the model, which include O2, O3, CO2, H2O, CH4, and C2H6. The effects of pressure broadening (e.g., by N2) are included in the model. The KSPECTRUM7 program was originally used to calculate the correlated-k coefficients using the HITRAN 2008 line lists (Rothman et al., 2009) and updated in the work of Kopparapu et al. (2013) with the HITEMP 2010 line lists (Rothman et al., 2010). As in the photochemical model, this climate model uses a δ 2-stream multiple scattering algorithm (Toon et al., 1989). The shortwave (absorbed stellar radiation) wavelength grid spans from λ = 0.2 to 4.5 μm in 38 spectral intervals; to compute outgoing longwave IR radiation, there is a separate set of correlated-k coefficients in 55 spectral intervals for each gas included in our scheme for wavenumbers 0–15,000 cm−1 (λ > 0.67 μm). The density structure of the atmosphere is calculated assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. The tropospheric temperature profile is calculated by following a wet adiabatic lapse rate to the altitude at which the stratospheric temperature is reached (Kasting, 1988), except in desiccated cases, for which a dry adiabat is assumed. The water vapor distribution with altitude is determined by a Manabe and Wetherald (1967) profile with a surface relative humidity of 80% (Kasting and Ackerman, 1986). Gases in the upper atmosphere can have a heating or cooling effect on the temperature profile depending on the relative abundance of gases in the upper atmosphere and the extent of shortwave heating.\n\nNote that we have been unable to run this climate model to a converged state using the same top-of-atmosphere pressure that the photochemical model has. The photochemical model grid extends to 100 km in altitude, but for 1 bar atmospheres, we are typically unable to run this climate model with pressures above 80 km in altitude at the top of the pressure grid due to model instabilities. Therefore, when this climate model passes its temperature and water profiles to the photochemical model, they are fixed at their values at the top of the climate grid, and they become isoprofiles above the top of this grid. Previous tests (Arney et al., 2016) suggest that this treatment does not strongly impact the resultant photochemistry.\n\nOrganic haze particles, which are relevant to some of our simulations, form initially in the model with radii of 0.001 μm. In each layer, the particles are treated as monomodal distributions with the particle size determined by comparing the coagulation lifetime to the particle removal lifetime from the layer by sedimentation and diffusion processes. Particle growth in a layer occurs when the particle growth timescale is shorter than the timescale for particle removal.\n\nOur model's organic haze particles are treated as fractal (rather than spherical) in shape in both the photochemical and climate portions of the Atmos model (Arney et al., 2016). Fractal particles are agglomerates of spherical particles, and studies of organic hazes in the laboratory (e.g., Trainer et al., 2006) and from observations of Titan (e.g., Rannou et al., 1997) suggest that fractal particles are more realistic for organic hazes compared to spherical particles. In particular, we treat our fractal particles as agglomerates of 0.05 μm spherical “monomers.” This size of monomer was chosen because it is similar to the size of the monomers of Titan's haze particles (Rannou et al., 1997; Tomasko et al., 2008), and it was the size used in the first study to simulate fractal hazes in an Earth-like atmosphere (Wolf and Toon, 2010), which our haze input files are based on. Haze scattering and absorption properties are calculated with Mie scattering for our sub-monomer particles (r < 0.05 μm), and the fractal mean-field approximation (Botet et al., 1997) for fractal particles (r > 0.05 μm). Our fractal haze scheme is based on that of Wolf and Toon (2010), and the fractal dimension of our particles varies from 1.5 to 2.4, with larger fractal particles having a larger fractal dimension to account for folding as the particles coagulate. Note that a fractal dimension of 1 describes a linear chain of monomers, and a fractal dimension of 3 describes a perfectly spherical particle. Titan's haze particles have a fractal dimension of about 2 (Rannou et al., 1997). The model includes a grid of optical property files for 51 particle sizes, and particle properties with radii in between grid sizes are defined by interpolating between the nearest grid size properties. A detailed description of our model's haze formation scheme can be found in the work of Arney et al. (2016).\n\n3.7. Model inputs\n\nTo simulate planetary environments and observable properties, our models require information on the planetary and stellar characteristics, including stellar parameters and spectrum, planetary physical and orbital parameters, as well as environmental information such as the surface albedo, aerosol and atmospheric molecular absorption properties.\n\n3.7.1. Planetary and stellar parameters\n\nWe use the best-fit minimum mass of 1.3 M⊕ from the work of Anglada-Escudé et al. (2016) and adopt the silicate planet scaling law from the work of Sotin et al. (2007) to obtain a planetary radius of 1.074 R⊕ (6850 km). Note that this assumes an edge-on, or nearly edge-on, inclination for the system, which is currently unknown. We adopt the best-fit semimajor axis for Proxima Centauri b of 0.0485 AU. We also assume the stellar radius is 0.141 R⊙ (Boyajian et al., 2012). While the same stellar fluxes are used across our suite of models, the solar zenith angles (SZAs) used in each model were selected to best represent globally averaged behavior resulting from each. The standard SZAs used for Atmos modeling are SZA = 50° in the photochemical model (e.g., Kharecha et al., 2005; Zahnle et al., 2006, Segura et al., 2007) and SZA = 60° in the climate model (e.g., Kopparapu et al., 2013; Arney et al., 2017), and we use these values in our coupled approach here.\n\n3.7.2. The stellar energy distribution of Proxima Centauri\n\nTo self-consistently model the photochemistry, climate, and the expected reflectance and transmission spectra from Proxima Centauri b, an EUV to MIR input spectrum is required. Since Proxima Centauri is the nearest star to our Sun, many spectra have been recorded over the years, though no single source provided a calibrated, normalized spectrum for all necessary wavelengths at the time of this work. To facilitate our simulations, we compiled a self-consistent, panchromatic stellar spectrum representative of Proxima Centauri ( ) combining publicly available data downloaded from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST)8 and MUSCLES9, with PHOENIX spectral library v2.0 models10 at wavelengths where calibrated observations are not yet publicly available (Husser et al., 2013).\n\nFor UV wavelengths, we combined calibrated HST Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) observations and additional observations processed and compiled by the MUSCLES Treasury Survey. The STIS contribution (λ = 1200–1691 Å) was calculated as the median point at each wavelength of six available calibrated observations (HST Proposal ID: 8040). We used a reconstructed Lyman-α line and calibrated observations for λ = 1691–4569 Å, which were processed and compiled by the MUSCLES Treasury Survey and available on MAST, including details on their calibration methods (v2.1, see also France et al., 2016, and Youngblood et al., 2016). For the visible spectrum (λ = 4569–8499 Å), we used observations from the HST Faint Object Spectrograph (FOD/RD) (HST Proposal ID: 6059). The IR spectrum (λ > 8499 Å) was computed by a linear interpolation of PHOENIX spectral library v2.0 models (Husser et al., 2013) with Teff = {3000 K, 3100 K} and [Fe/H] = {0.0, 0.5}. The PHOENIX spectrum terminates at 5.5 μm; to extend the spectrum deeper into the MIR for climate modeling and thermal phase curve analysis, we fit a blackbody from the tail of the PHOENIX spectrum to 30 μm. There is little stellar atmospheric absorption in this range and it is well-fit with a blackbody (Roellig et al., 2004; Mainzer et al., 2007). The combined spectrum was normalized to match Proxima Centauri's bolometric luminosity of L/L⊙ = 0.00155 (Boyajian et al., 2012). provides a summary of the sources for our combined spectrum. An important limitation to note for this spectrum is that it is a static representation of the star in its quiescent state and does not account for flare activity (i.e., Davenport, 2016). We have made our compiled spectrum publicly available in the Virtual Planetary Laboratory Spectral Database11.\n\n3.7.3. Input line lists\n\nOur models use a variety of sources to compute gas absorption from line lists, collision-induced absorption coefficients, and UV-visible cross sections. The line lists are primarily from HITRAN 2012 (Rothman et al., 2013) for all species except for high-temperature applications for CO2 and H2O, for which we use Ames (Huang et al., 2014) and HITEMP 2010 (Rothman et al., 2010), respectively. Collision-induced absorption is used for CO2-CO2, O2-O2, and N2-N2. The CO2-CO2 absorption data, which are included in high-CO2 models and cover a range of temperatures up to 700 K, are sourced from Moore (1971), Kasting et al. (1984a), Gruszka and Borysow (1997), Baranov et al. (2004), Wordsworth et al. (2010), and Lee et al. (2016). N2-N2 collision-induced absorption coefficients are calculated based on the empirical model from Lafferty et al. (1996) as described in Schwieterman et al. (2015b). The O2-O2 absorption coefficients are taken from C. Hermans12 (Hermans et al., 1999) for the 0.333–0.666 μm range and from Greenblatt et al. (1990) and Maté et al. (1999) for the O2-O2 absorption at 1.06 μm and 1.27 μm, respectively. UV-visible cross section data is sourced from primary references available from the MPI-Mainz UV/VIS Spectral Atlas of Gaseous Molecules of Atmospheric Interest13.\n\n3.7.4. LBLABC\n\nA companion to SMART, the Line-By-Line Absorption Coefficients (LBLABC) code generates pressure- and temperature-dependent, line-by-line absorption coefficients using input line lists as described above (e.g., HITRAN) for given gas mixing ratio profiles (Meadows and Crisp, 1996). LBLABC fully resolves the narrow line cores and wings as far as 1000 cm−1 from the line center and is designed and validated for a wide range of pressures (10−5 to 100 bar) and temperatures (130–750 K). Unless otherwise specified, a maximum line profile width of 1000 cm−1 is used.\n\n3.7.5. Surface spectral albedo inputs\n\nFor Lambertian scattering planetary surfaces, we chose surface spectral albedos to be consistent with the likely surface conditions for the type of atmosphere modeled: basalt, desert, ice, seawater, martian global average, or a composite surface albedo spectrum. The pairing of surface and atmosphere for our experimental scenarios is given in in Section 4.2. For modern Earth-like cases, a weighted composite spectrum was used that consists of 65.6% seawater, 13.6% grassland/brush, 4% conifer forest, 5.5% soil/desert (kaolinite), and 11.3% snow/ice, based on a diurnally averaged equatorial Earth view during spring equinox (composite 1; Robinson et al., 2011). For early Earth-like cases, we used a similar composite spectrum with land vegetation removed: 65.6% seawater, 23.1% soil/desert, and 11.3% snow/ice (composite 2). The globally averaged Mars spectrum was compiled by Crisp (1990), who used available observations and laboratory measurements of Mars analog surface materials. The forest spectrum was taken from the ASTER spectral library (Baldridge et al., 2009), while all other surface spectra were taken from the USGS spectral library (Clark et al., 2007). In the subset of cases that included glint, we used the Cox and Munk (1954) glint model as described by Robinson et al.

Aerosol inputs\n\nAerosols such as hazes and clouds are incorporated into SMART by providing input containing the altitude-dependent opacities as well as the phase function or particle asymmetry parameter (g) and the extinction, scattering, and absorption efficiencies (Qext, Qscat, and Qabs). For spherical particles, a full Mie phase function is used; otherwise we use a Henyey-Greenstein phase function (Henyey and Greenstein, 1941). We simulate aerosols in several of our planetary atmospheres: these include organic hazes, sulfuric acid clouds and haze, and water vapor clouds. summarizes the aerosol types used in simulated atmospheres.\n\nTable 4.\n\nAerosol typeOptical constantsParticle shapeParticle size (μm)ReferencesH2SO4Palmer and Williams, 1975Spherical0.49–3.85Crisp, 1986Organic hazeKhare et al.,1984Fractal0.001–0.5Botet et al.,1997Stratocumulus cloudHale and Querry, 1973Spherical4.07Wiscombe, 1980; Crisp, 1986Cirrus cloudHeymsfield et al.,2002Columns, plates, rosettes100aBaum et al.,2005\n\nWhere we simulate organic hazes, particles of radii >0.05 μm are treated as fractal aggregates of 0.05 μm monomers using the fractal mean-field approximation (Botet et al., 1997), and we use the hydrocarbon refractive indices measured by Khare et al. (1984). The particle sizes, number densities, and vertical distributions for organic hazes used as inputs to the SMART model are derived from our Atmos simulations. Atmos calculates a monomodal size distribution of particles in each layer. The particle size is determined by comparing the particle coagulation lifetime to the timescale for removal from the layer by sedimentation and diffusion processes. Growth occurs when the timescale for coagulation is shorter than the timescale for particle removal. To decrease model run-time for SMART, we bin the many dozens of particle sizes generated by Atmos into 19 particle size bins. Spherical mode particles have radii of 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, and 0.05 μm. Fractal modes particles have radii of 0.06–2 μm: this includes four modes between 0.06 and 0.1 μm, 10 equally spaced modes between 0.1 and 1 μm, and 2 μm.\n\nWe also simulate sulfuric acid clouds and hazes in our Venus-like spectral models. Our nominal venusian cloud profiles and particle size populations are based on an empirical Venus cloud model from Crisp (1986). Sulfuric acid refractive indices are derived from Palmer and Williams (1975). The sulfuric acid cloud particle populations are modeled with log-normal size distributions, and the optical efficiencies are calculated by using the code “Miescat” adapted from the code by Wiscombe (1980). shows the properties of the Venus cloud particle populations used here. Four particle size populations (called “Modes” in ) are assumed.\n\nTable 5.\n\nModeEffective radius (μm)Variance10.490.221.41.050.1621.40.20732.850.262\n\nWater vapor (stratocumulus) clouds are modeled by using refractive indices from Hale and Querry (1973). Stratocumulus clouds are modeled with a two-parameter gamma distribution with a = 5.3, b = 1.1, and a mean particle radius of 4.07 μm. Cirrus cloud properties are modeled by using data from B. Baum's Cirrus Optical Property Library (Baum et al., 2005)14. The optical properties of the cirrus clouds originate from a 45-bin size distribution of three types of ice particle shapes including a weighting of 50% solid columns, 35% plates, and 15% 3-D bullet rosettes. The distribution of cloud particle sizes ranges from 2 to 9500 μm, but the cross-section weighted effective diameter of the distribution used is 100 μm. Patchy clouds on a disk-integrated spectrum are included in the 1-D SMART model by using a weighted average of 50% clear-sky, 25% cirrus cloud, and 25% stratocumulus cloud.\n\n4. Results\n\nTo explore possible current environmental states for Proxima Cen b, we present self-consistent atmospheres with constituent vertical mixing ratios and temperature-pressure profiles for the planetary states discussed in Section 2. Most of the simulations presented here are photochemically and climatically self-consistent unless otherwise noted. Following generation of these atmospheres, we simulate phase curves and direct imaging and transmission spectra for these cases. We then outline observational considerations and discuss detectability of spectral features that may be able to discriminate evolutionary histories, current habitability, and biosignatures.\n\n4.1. Comparison with existing 3-D GCM simulations\n\nOur 1-D climate models are computationally efficient and radiatively rigorous but can only approximate the 3-D feedbacks and heat transport processes that can be modeled in detail with 3-D GCMs. Additionally, although we have validated our models on planets in our solar system, the likely evolution of Proxima Centauri b may result in current conditions that differ from those of Earth and Venus. To provide further validation for our model, we compare our results with existing 3-D studies for both Earth-like and non-Earth-like atmospheres. A summary of these comparisons is given in .\n\nTable 6.\n\nComparison result (K)AtmosphereOur modelOur result (K)Asynchronous (3:2)Synchronous (1:1)1 bar CO2 (snow)VPL Climate264266a247a4 bar CO2VPL Climate306305a289a6 bar CO2VPL Climate320324a309a1 bar N2, 376 ppm CO2VPL Climate238238a220a1 bar N2, 376 ppm CO2, waterVPL Climate249 (moist adiabat)\n\n257 (fixed H2O)253a252a2% CO2, 0.02% CH4, waterAtmos282287b6% CO2, waterAtmos285.3287.9c\n\nWe compare our new VPL Climate model with the recent work by Turbet et al. (2016), who used a 3-D GCM in a similar study examining the climate of Proxima Centauri b. Although our study's companion paper and the companion paper of Turbet et al. (2016) argue for synchronous rotation as a likely scenario for Proxima Centauri b (Barnes et al., 2018; Ribas et al., 2016), they also note that if Proxima Centauri b has an eccentricity >0.06 or has a companion planet perturbing its orbit, the planet would likely be in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance. Turbet et al. (2016) demonstrated this resonance results in a longitudinally uniform atmosphere. Since 1-D models implicitly assume a rapidly rotating planet, to calculate a globally averaged surface temperature, the most appropriate comparison for our 1-D models is with the 3:2 spin-orbit results of the 3-D models, although we have also provided their 3-D modeling results for synchronous rotation for comparison, when these were available. First, we assume a rapidly rotating Proxima Cen b and compare our results with the asynchronous 3:2 spin-orbit resonance results from Turbet et al. (2016). The atmospheres selected for comparison include pure CO2 atmospheres and N2-dominated atmospheres with trace CO2. The pure CO2 cases are for 1, 4, and 6 bar atmospheres. The N2 cases consist of 1 bar N2 with 376 ppm CO2, either without or with water. For the latter case, we begin with the water mixing profile provided by M. Turbet (personal communication) to enable a close comparison. We use a surface albedo of 0.20 from 0–5μm (CO2 cases) or the idealized wavelength-dependent snow/ice albedo taken from Turbet et al. (2016, their , lower panel) (N2 cases), and a solar zenith angle of 60 degrees, which approximates the diurnal average in our 1-D model.\n\nOur VPL Climate model appears to be in reasonable agreement with the LMDz model used by Turbet et al. (2016) for the test cases chosen, with at most a discrepancy of 5 K between the surface temperatures derived by the models for similar inputs. However, thin atmospheres depend very strongly on the surface albedo and water vapor profile assumptions. For the pure CO2 cases, our results agree well with the 3:2 spin-orbit resonance cases of Turbet et al. (2016). We find global average surface temperatures of 264, 306, and 320 K, compared with 266, 305, and 325 K from Turbet et al. (2016) for 1, 4, and 6 bar of CO2, respectively. For CO2 cases, these temperatures agree between the models to within 5 K. For the dry 1 bar N2, 376 ppm CO2 atmosphere, we agree with Turbet et al. (2016) that this CO2 amount is insufficient to maintain a globally averaged surface temperature above freezing (we found this initially with an albedo of 0.20 as well, representative of a warm surface). Before comparing the Earth-like (N2) cases, it is important to point out that surface albedo has a drastic impact on surface temperatures. For example, Godolt et al. (2016) used an updated version of the 1-D Atmos climate model under Earth-like assumptions, and depending on the surface albedo and humidity profile, they produced a range of climates including glaciation and moist greenhouse, spanning 196.4–354.2 K. With VPL Climate, we have also found a strong dependence on surface albedo and water profile. When we use the same albedo assumptions as Turbet et al. for the dry N2 case with 376 ppm CO2 we obtain a surface temperature of 238 K, the same as Turbet et al. (see their ; private communication, M. Turbet). For the 1 bar N2 case with 376 ppm CO2 and H2O, we calculate a globally averaged surface temperature of 249 K using a fully saturated moist adiabat and 257 K using the globally averaged water mixing ratios from Turbet et al., which compares to 253 K from Turbet et al. (private communication, M. Turbet). Consequently, our surface temperatures are all within ∼5 K of Turbet et al.'s results for the 3:2 spin-orbit cases, and we can reasonably reproduce the global average temperatures of the LMDz GCM for the nonsynchronously rotating planets.\n\nWe also show for comparison the globally averaged surface temperatures for the synchronously rotating results of Turbet et al. (2016; M. Turbet, private communication). Our 1-D globally averaged results for dry planets are systematically warmer than the 3-D synchronously rotating cases by 11–18 K. However, our comparison with the wet, Earth-like planet shows only a 3 K difference between the 1-D model and the synchronously rotating case, although, again, for these 1 bar atmospheres, the surface temperature is strongly dependent on water vapor profiles and surface albedos. These results show that the 1-D models are a reasonable match for the 3-D asynchronous result and typically sit between the synchronous and asynchronous 3-D results, which are systematically cooler. Comparable results for exoplanets with 1-D and 3-D models for relatively rapid rotators have been previously shown (Yang et al., 2014) and also for synchronously rotating planets (Godolt et al., 2016), although the latter results are strongly dependent on the assumed surface albedo and water vapor profile. It is also important to note that many 3-D GCM results do not use ocean heat transport, which can be very efficient at reducing day-night temperature differences and potentially deglaciating the nightside of tidally locked planets (Hu and Yang, 2014). Three-dimensional models with ocean heat transport may produce results closer to 1-D results.\n\nWe have also previously compared our 1-D Atmos climate model to the temperatures produced by the LMDz GCM and the CAM GCM for Archean Earth-like planets in the work of Arney et al. (2016). For a planet with 2% CO2, 0.02% CH4, and a surface albedo of 0.33, the LMDz model produces a global average temperature of 287 K (Charnay et al., 2013), which is 5 K warmer than our model's 282 K for this type of planet. For a planet with 6% CO2, no CH4, and an average albedo of 0.317, the CAM model produces a global average temperature of 287.9 K (Wolf and Toon 2013), and our model produces an average temperature of 285.3 K, a difference of 2.6 K. These comparable cases suggest that our 1-D Atmos climate model can produce similar temperatures to GCM models, at least for nonsynchronously rotating planets.\n\n"
