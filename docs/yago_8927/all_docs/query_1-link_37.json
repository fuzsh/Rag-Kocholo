        "text": "Carlos Meroño Atanes, known artistically as Carlos Atanes (Barcelona, November 8, 1971), is a Spanish film director, writer and playwright. He is a member of The Film-Makers & # 39; Cooperative, founded by Jonas Mekas and Andy Warhol, among others.\n\nBiography\n\nIn 1987, at the age of fifteen, he began to shoot short video films as an amateur. In 1988 he enrolled in Image and Sound, and upon finishing his studies he directed El Meravellòs Món de l'Ocell Cúcù (1991), in 35 mm, considered one of the best Catalan short films of the 90s.[citation required] Shortly afterwards he made adaptations of texts by Joan Brossa, Botho Strauss and Franz Kafka's famous story The Metamorphosis (1993), and embarks on the project of shooting his first feature film, Triptych, in 16 mm. He manages to shoot the film, but the results do not satisfy him and he decides not to edit it. From then on, for a few years, he dedicated himself to experimental video, more or less bizarre short films and the documentary genre.\n\nIn 2003, filming began on Perdurabo, a feature film about the life of the controversial English occultist Aleister Crowley. He manages to finish the first part of the film, 40 minutes long, but stops production until further notice to concentrate on FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (2004), a futuristic fantasy of Orwellian inspiration that after its international presentation at the Buenos Aires fantasy film festival Rojo Sangre has toured festivals all over the world, and aroused as many adhesions as antipathies. Produced outside of any type of institutional aid, and financed with the pocket money of a handful of enthusiasts, FAQ is one of the very few Spanish science fiction feature films, and probably the only one that belongs to the dystopia genre.[citation required] FAQ won the Best Film award in October 2005 at the Panorama of Independent Filmmakers in Athens, and was nominated for the Silver Méliès Award for European Fantastic Film at Fantasporto 2006.\n\nIn 2007 he premiered PROXIMA, his second science fiction feature film at Fantasporto and at the London Science Fiction Festival (Sci-Fi-London). PROXIMA, a space epic starring, among others, the mentalist Anthony Blake, is a more ambitious film than FAQ. The Tel Aviv fantastic film festival nominated it for the Icon award and in 2008 the Spanish Association of Fantasy, Science Fiction and Horror nominated it for the Ignotus award for the best fantasy genre film of 2007. In August 2016 the magazine Nature announced the discovery of Proxima Centauri b, a planet in the orbit of the star Proxima Centauri with characteristics very similar to the one that appears in the film, a moment that Atanes took advantage of to create, for the first time, a petition on Change.org.\n\nIn 2007 he brought together his three most bizarre and underground short films in the CODEX ATANICUS, an anthology that received a good reception from American independent critics. In 2008 he created, together with the filmmakers Albert Pons, Víctor Conde and El Chico Morera, the collective project Pulque 51, consisting of the filming of four short films with the aim of launching the actress Arantxa Peña as the new Spanish scream queen. Atanes directs the short film titled, precisely, Scream Queen, starring among others Arantxa Peña herself, the journalist and writer José Manuel Serrano Cueto (who plays himself) and the actor Antonio Albella, former -component of the legendary glam group Loco Mía.\n\nLater he films Maximum Shame, a fetishistic, musical, science fiction feature film, with which he recovers the transgressive and bizarre spirit of CODEX, to which he had already returned approach with Scream Queen. Maximum Shame, a dystopian and fetishistic nightmare, fantastic and musical, about the end of the world, pain and pleasure, ecstasy and power, is nominated for Best Film at the BUT Film Festival Breda (Netherlands), in 2010.\n\nIn 2012 he shot his feature film Gallino, the Chicken System. And in 2017 he filmed his first film adaptation of a theatrical text of his, in this case Romance Bizarro, which he released directly through his YouTube channel starting April 3, 2018.\n\nAs a writer he has published essays, plays, film scripts and narratives. In December 2018, the Dilatando Mentes publishing house published its essay Magic of Chaos for Skeptics, written with the aim of making known the magic of chaos in the Spanish-speaking world. In October 2019, the book was named a Finalist for the VI Guillermo de Baskerville Awards in the Non-Fiction category, in addition to being a Candidate for the 2019 Ignotus Prize for Best Essay Book.\n\nTheatre\n\nIn April 2011 he premiered his work The Cobra in the Wicker Basket at the Sala AZarte in Madrid, directed by himself and performed by Ana Mayo and Jorge Cabrera. And in December of the same year, also in Madrid, he premieres at the Arenal Theater his second play, The Man with the Cream Gun, a tragicomedy about the theft of ideas, this time under the direction of Juan José Afonso and performed by Joaquín Hinojosa, Francesc Tormos, María Kaltembacher and Josu Ormaetxe. This work obtained nine nominations corresponding to the 16th edition (2013) of the Max Awards. In March 2014 the play La predatora, under the direction of Ariadna Ferrer, was performed in Reus in the Quarts de Teatre-Hivern 2014 festival, where he was awarded the Pere Mata award for Best Setting and Costumes. In 2015 the play A Forgotten Genius (A Moment in the Life of Charles Howard Hinton), under the direction of Carlos Atanes, was awarded by the Tarde de Teatro website with the 2014/2015 Review Award in the category of Best Supporting Actress, for María Kaltembacher. Between November 2016 and January 2017, in Ciudad From Mexico, the play Necrofilia fina, under the direction of Rosendo Gázpel, was performed at the Microteatro México, where it was awarded two Micro Estrella Awards (Best Actor, for Cristian Magaloni, and Best Costume Design). In 2019 Afonso returns to direct a text by Atanes, Antimateria, with a preview in October at the Teatro El Sauzal in the town of El Sauzal and official premiere at the Teatro Guimerá in Santa Cruz from Tenerife. One year later, in October 2020, Antimateria hits the stages of Guayaquil, Ecuador, performed by Lucho Mueckay and José Andrés Caballero, under the direction of Alejandro Fajardo. In 2023 the work The tap of 5,000,000 euros, under the direction of María Ángeles Quinteros, ex aequo along with other works, was part of the Estrella de Mar Award Nomination for Best Integral Production from Mar del Plata, representing the Chauvín-Creation Center in Mar del Plata (Argentina).\n\nPlays released as author\n\nYearWork2021King of Mars - (dramatic reading led by Juan José Afonso) 2021Báthory - (dramatic reading by Marta Timón) 2019Antimatter - (Dir.
