        "text": "Template:Infobox adult biographyTemplate:Use dmy dates Rocco Siffredi (born Rocco Antonio Tano, 4 May 1964, in Ortona, Abruzzo)[1][2] is the stage name of an Italian pornographic actor, director and producer of pornographic movies who is known for his rough sex scenes. As of October 2011, he has starred in more than 450 pornographic films.[3]\n\nRocco took his stage name from the character \"Roch Siffredi\" played by Alain Delon in the French gangster film Borsalino (1970).[4] He is also known as the \"Italian Stallion\".\n\nPornography career\n\nSiffredi met porn actor and romantic movies Gabriel Pontello (like Simon) in a French sex club in 1984 in Simon'house who lives in Berck. The actor introduced Siffredi to producer Marc Dorcel and director Bicounet Michel Ricaud, who cast him in his first pornographic role, Attention fillettes… (Attention little girls…) in 1987, in which he performed anal sex. Siffredi then stepped away from porn and worked as a fashion model, but returned to the business after two years with the help of porn actress Teresa Orlowski.[5] Siffredi went on to perform in both plot-based and gonzo-style pornography, with styles of sex ranging from ordinary to extreme. However, it was Siffredi's performances involving rough sex, anal sex and analingus, and his psychological intensity and athleticism, that earned him recognition and ultimately a cult following. Through collaboration with John Stagliano's Evil Angel studio, and then his own Budapest-based Rocco Siffredi Produzioni as both a performer and director, \"Rocco\" became one of the most powerful and recognizable personalities in pornography. \"Rocco has far more power in this industry than any actress,\" John Stagliano commented in 2001.[6]\n\nSiffredi's rough sex performances include spitting, slapping, spanking, deep throat, irrumatio, urolagnia, hair pulling, choking and general roughhousing. Despite these sexual practices becoming more common in pornography in the 2000s, Siffredi's on-screen behavior is distinct from most present-day depictions of dominant men in sadomasochistic or erotic humiliation scenes. He often places himself in submissive poses, such as smothering his face with an actress's feet or buttocks, or accepting physical retorts such as slaps across the face. He is also known for pouring verbal praise on his co-stars during scenes, and indeed Template:Citation needed span. Siffredi on rare occasion portrays the submissive fully, in films like Rocco More than Ever in London 2, Animal Trainer 11, and Marquis de Sade, appearing in drag in the latter. Actress Bobbi Starr noted of Siffredi, \"[A]ny girl in the industry who has been with him… will tell you that they have done things with him that they [would] never do with anyone else.\"[7] Speaking of his female partners, Siffredi says, \"I want to see emotion… fear… excitement… the eyes going up from being surprised.\"[8]\n\nSiffredi's Template:Citation needed span may be alongside Sidony Lamour (Lavour) in 1995's Sandy Insatiable, which depicts him forcing the actress's head into a flush toilet during anal sex. In 2009's Rocco Ravishes L.A., Siffredi recounts the production of the scene as both spontaneous and consensual, before re-enacting it with an insistent Bobbi Starr. Siffredi is known for several long-term professional partnerships: his series of torrid performances with Kelly Stafford, his world travels and video productions with John Stagliano, and his mentoring of and on-screen performance alongside Nacho Vidal. He is known for including members of the \"Rocco Siffredi Fun Club\" (his fan club) and anonymous local European men in his films, and for staging productions and seeking female talent in varied locales including Budapest, Prague, Brazil and Canada. Although different in tone than his famous gonzo films, Siffredi is also known for his performance in 1995's Tarzan X: Shame of Jane (originally known as Jungle Heat) alongside his wife Rosa Caracciolo.\n\nIn June 2004, Siffredi declared that he would retire from performing in porn for the sake of his children, and instead focus on direction and production. \"My children are growing up,\" he said, \"and I can no longer just say 'Dad is going to work to make money for the family.' They want to know more.\"[9] Regarding Siffredi's long career, Axel Braun commented, \"The problem is that he's been trying for years to find an 'heir to the throne,' but it's no easy task. He thought he found him in Nacho Vidal, but then Nacho went his own way.\"[10] Siffredi, while continuing to direct, was largely absent as an on-screen performer for nearly 5 years. However sexual frustration, and disappointment as a director with his male talent and the state of the porn industry overall, led Siffredi to return as a performer in 2009.[8]\n\nIn mainstream media\n\nSiffredi is one of a few porn actors to enjoy crossover appeal and success with respect to other segments of the adult-film industry, as well as some in mainstream media. As a primary example, although his acting has been restricted exclusively to heterosexual pornography, his looks have resulted in his attracting a large gay audience. In December 1990, Siffredi was selected to pose as the nude centerfold in the adult mainstream magazine Playgirl. Accompanying him on the cover was the caption, \"At last! A centerfold to die for!\"\n\nIn 1999, he appeared in the controversial Catherine Breillat film Romance. His performance in this role was followed by a part specifically written for him by the same director in her 2003 film Anatomie de L'enfer (Anatomy of Hell), in which he plays a gay man who becomes sexually involved with a woman. Both films feature unsimulated sexual scenes involving Siffredi, although it is disputed whether he actually has intercourse with co-star Caroline Ducey in Romance. (She says no, Siffredi says yes.)[11]\n\nSiffredi is also visible in non-pornographic roles on Italian television, including:\n\nTelevision commercials for Amica Chips, a snack food, which have spawned considerable controversy and have at one point been taken off the air.\n\nWith his wife, Rosa Caracciolo, in a television commercial for 48248, an SMS service.\n\nAs the unwitting participant in an episode of Scherzi a Parte, a program similar to Candid Camera.\n\nElio e Le Storie Tese's leader Stefano Belisari (also known as Elio) dedicated in 1997 to Siffredi a song and a video Rocco e Le Storie Tese. Rocco himself directed the video also appearing in it.\n\nPersonal life\n\nSiffredi is married to Rosa Caracciolo (born Rózsa Tassi) an Hungarian model, whom he met in 1993 in Cannes, and performed with 2 years later in Tarzan X: Shame of Jane. Together they have two sons Lorenzo and Leonardo.[12] Upon his decision to return to on-screen pornographic performance in 2009, Siffredi recounted, \"I spoke with my wife and she said it’s my problem only, it doesn't belong to her and the boys. And she said, 'You decided to stop, we never asked you. So if you want to go back, just go back.\"[8]\n\nAwards\n\nSiffredi has won nearly 40 AVN awards (list) since 1991's Buttman's Ultimate Workout including:\n\nBest Group Sex Scene – Video (Buttman's Ultimate Workout)\n\nBest Director – Foreign Release (Who Fucked Rocco?)\n\nBest Continuing Video Series (Rocco: Animal Trainer)\n\nBest Director – Video (Ass Collector)\n\nMale Performer of the Year in 1993 and 1996\n\nMale Foreign Performer of the Year in 2003, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2013\n\nBest Anal Sex Scene – Film (The Fashionistas)\n\nBest Pro-Am Release (Rocco's Initiations 9)\n\nBest Foreign Feature (Rocco: Animal Trainer 3)\n\nAVN Hall of Fame award\n\nHe has also won:\n\n2011 XBIZ Award – Gonzo Release of the Year – Non-Feature (Tori, Tarra and Bobbi Love Rocco) [13]\n\n2011 XBIZ Award – Foreign Male Performer of the Year [13]\n\n2014 XBIZ Award – European Non-Feature Release of the Year (Cayenne Loves Rocco)[14]\n\nHe was recentlyTemplate:When voted #10 in AVN's list of the Top 50 Porn Stars of All Time. He has received numerous other awards, including the prestigious Hot D'Or Platinum Award and induction into the XRCO Hall of Fame.\n\nReferences in popular culture\n\nSiffredi is referenced in the Hold Steady song \"Most People Are DJs\" from 2004's Almost Killed Me.\n\nThe Polish punk rock band Anti Dread wrote the song \"Roko na Sterydach\" (\"Rocco on Steroids\") about Siffredi.\n\nHe is also referred by famous Italian rock band Elio e Le Storie Tese (a Milan rock band whose music is inspired to the style of Frank Zappa).
