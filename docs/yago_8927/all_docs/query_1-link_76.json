        "text": "Siddhartha is not a treatise on Buddhism. It is a work of fiction. The omniscient narrator is also a creation of the author. But what the individual reader may infer from the story could be identical with or at least similar to the author's own interpretation of the state of enlightenment that is the ultimate spiritual achievement that one can attain in Buddhism. Characters as well as their ideas and motives are the products of a creative writer's imagination. The novel presents Siddhartha's final state of transcendent peace as the same as that achieved by any successful disciple of the Buddha. But we know that Siddhartha says he does not accept the teachings of the Buddha while not denying that he is the Perfect One. Having praised the Buddha for proving the unity of the world through his doctrine of cause and effect, Siddhartha tells him that he thinks that \" nobody finds salvation through teachings \". Knowledge can be taught, but not wisdom, says Siddhartha. I venture to propose here my personal thesis that, in the final analysis, what Hesse depicts as a realized goal in this story of Siddhartha the Brahmin's son is not a pure Buddhist ideal, but an amalgam of Buddhist, Hindu, and Christian ideals (which, at a deep level, seem to be conceived as identical with each other). Though he owed much to the influences of Hindu and Buddhist philosophies, Hesse stated: \" Christianity, one not preached, but lived, was the strongest of the powers that shaped and moulded me \". His must have been a thoroughly 'Indianized' or 'Buddhisticized' Christianity. In a conversation with Miguel Serrano, Hesse said about belief in God: \"You should let yourself be carried away, like the clouds in the sky. You shouldn't resist. God exists in your destiny just as much as he does in these mountains and in that lake. It is very difficult to understand this, because man is moving further and further away from Nature, and also from himself.\" Although, apparently, Hesse is here talking about his Christian religious belief, his words also evoke Hindu pantheistic ideas. This imputation of an element of mysticism to Buddhism, I feel, is due to Hesse's own religious heterogeneity, which he seems to subordinate to his own interpretation of the theistic religious ideology that was his patrimony.\n\nVolume VII of Ars Artium offers fifteen critical articles on different areas of English Studies and Culture. In the first article, Dr. Motasim O. Al-Mwajeh and Dr. Shadi S. Neimneh critically examine the construction and destruction of both the 'Self' and the 'Other' in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. They use Edward Said's theory of \"Orientalism\" and Michel Foucault's concept of power and knowledge in this study. Dr. V. Pala Prasada Rao and Mr. G. Nageswara Rao, in their article \"Historicity of Creative Literature\", analyse the need of historical sacredness of facts and argue that history should not be appropriated by any means as the subversion of the same under some influence can be poisonous and cause hatred in some sections of society. They begin the article with important lines of Miguel de Cervantes, \"History is a sacred kind of writing, because truth is essential to it, and where truth is, there God himself is, so far as truth is concerned\", and use Shashi Tharoor's Riot (2001), Bapsi Sidhwa's Cracking India (1988), Bhisham Sahni's Tamas (1974), and also Jawaharlal Nehru's Discovery of India (1946) in their study. There are three critical articles on Feminism. Dr. Shadi S. Neimneh, Prof. Marwan M. Obeidat and Dr. Motasim O. Al-Mwajeh in their joint article examine the language of the body in J. M. Coetzee's novel, In the Heart of the Country (1977), in a psychoanalytic feminist approach using the theories of Julia Kristeva, Jacques Lacan, and Sigmund Freud. Dr. Mohan Lal Mahto analyses Ruth Prawer Jhabvala's Get Ready for Battle (1962) from feminist perspective and Mr. Vinay Kumar Dubey examines patriarchy and woman's search for self in the major novels of Shashi Deshpande. Prof. Zafar Khan, in his article on Children’s Literature, evaluates the evolution of Children's Literature in Africa since the colonial period to modern times. Dr. Evelyn Nwachukwu Urama examines discrimination against women in African society and the changing roles of the Igbo women as presented in the selected works of Akachi Adimora-Ezeigbo and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the African women novelists. In his article on Indian Fiction in English, Dr. Rabindra Das examines discrimination and exploitation in the first trilogy of Mulk Raj Anand, namely Untouchable (1935), Coolie (1936) and Two Leaves and a Bud (1937). There is an article on Film Studies by Dr. Sumati in which she studies the movie Dear Zindagi (2016) on the principles of positive psychology and tries to establish the fact that such a movie could be the best suited medium and a practical guide to appeal one's emotions and identify one's strengths and weaknesses in order to bring harmony and balance in life. Mr. Abhisek Ghosal's article examines different dimensions of parenting in internal diasporic situations as presented in Shilpa Raj's memoir, The Elephant Chaser's Daughter (2017). He vividly explores acculturation-related problems that affect parenting and necessitate the parents to negotiate with them for the cause of success. Mr. Aiman Reyaz and Dr. Priyanka Tripathi's study is an exploration of realism and anti-realism in Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis. There is a critical article on Translation Studies by Ms. Bastabika Das. In her article, she studies the influence of Cold War (after the Second World War) on the translated works of some Nobel Laureates in Odia and their impact on the people of Odisha as this eastern Indian state was undergoing major changes: socially, culturally and politically around the same time. There is an article on Indian English Poetry by Dr. Pawan Kumar Jha in which he presents the discourse of love and beauty in the selected poems of Sri Aurobindo. We have an article on ecocriticism by Dr. G. Anish S. Georshia in which she examines Indigenous writings of Australia and Canada and brings to light the symbiosis of nature and culture as portrayed in Indigenous writings along with Indigenous spirituality and ecocritical characteristics. The article by Prof. Rekha Pande and Ms. Neeharika Joshi is a comprehensive study of representation of women in Garhwal miniature painting, an offshoot of Pahari painting. The authors provide historical accounts of paintings as well as different schools of paintings including Mewar, Bundi, Kotah, Marwar, Jaipur and Kishangarh. They also explore the murals of the caves of Ajanta and Ellora reminding us of Indian philosophy of the sensuous and the sublime, an important part of Indian aesthetics. There are three book reviews. Bhaskaranand Jha Bhaskar's collection of poems, Soothing Serenades: Straight from the Heart (2018), has been reviewed by Dr. Tribhuwan Kumar; Binod Mishra's collection of poems, Multiple Waves (2017), has been reviewed by Dr. S. Somasundari Latha; and Zafar Khan's Thirty-one Steps to Fluent Spoken English: Conversational English for the Speakers of Other Languages (2016), has been reviewed by Dr. Shahid Mushtaq. As poetry is an important part of Ars Artium, there are moving poems by a number of poets from different countries: Prof. Charles Fishman (USA), Prof. Zafar Khan (USA), Prof. Neal Whitman (USA), Dr. Bishakha Sarma (India), Ms. Kaneez Fatima Syeda (Pakistan), Prof. Hadaa Sendoo (Mongolia), and Ms. Nibedita Sen (India).\n\nPerformativity is at times a crucial component of serial murder. A specific positioning of the body and accompanying scenarios, settings, props or costumes all serve to boast, to leave a mark and to communicate the murderer’s twisted message to the onlookers. Such theatricality of serial crime made it one of the favourite themes for popular culture. The latest example is “Hannibal” (2013- ), a television series created by Bryan Fuller for NBC. It is loosely based on the novels by Thomas Harris and the accompanying films. The characteristic feature of the series is the grotesqueness of the murders: female bodies pierced by antlers; a throat cut open to shove a violin bridge through; a human totem on the beach made of old and new pieces of victims – the list is long and appalling. In this book chapter the extremely bizarre nature of the presented crimes and their function are discussed. The performativity theory is used to look at how the murders, with their outlandish and extreme brutality, become metonymy for creating one’s identity. The serial killers in the show attempt to establish their own unique identity through their signature bizarre crimes; yet, these crimes are constantly repeated with a twist by Hannibal, who in this way both steals the other killers' identity and establishes his own. The series seems to illustrate the nature of identity as performative, unstable and changeable, especially in the light of the clash between sanity and insanity, which is one of the leitmotifs of the series. The main character of the show, Will Graham, is a forensic consultant whose greatest talent, through observation, is to momentarily \"become\" the murderer in order to understand the perpetrator's hidden agendas. This gift – again, stealing the murderer’s identity – leads him to the brink of madness, where he doubts who he is and what he is capable of. Paradoxically, Hannibal, the psychopath who eats his victims, is Will’s psychologist, whom Will believes to be the epitome of sanity. Thus, the shocking aspects of the show illustrate the core questions posed by it: what is identity, if it can be blurred by madness, be stolen, imposed or pretended?"
