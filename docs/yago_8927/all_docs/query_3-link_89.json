        "text": "Saint of the Day – 6 October – Saint Faith of Agen (Died 3-4th Century) Virgin Martyr, Confessor. Born at Agen, Aquitaine, (modern France) and died by being cooked on a brazier, then beheaded. Also known as – Fides, Foi, Foy, Fe, Faith of Conques. Patronages – eye diseases and blindness, Pilgrims, prisoners. soldiers. Our little Faith today must not be was confused with the three legendary sisters known as Faith, Hope and Charity., Virgin Martyrs of the 2nd Century whose feast day is 1 August.\n\nThe Roman Martyrologgy states: “ At Agen, in France, the birthday of St Faith, Virgin and Martyr whose example encouraged the blessed Caprasius so much, that he happily terminated his combat by Martyrdom.“\n\nFaith was a beautiful 12-year-old girl living in Agen, Aquitaine, France, during the reign of Diocletian and Maximian. Her parents, wealthy pagans, left her rearing to a nurse, who happened to be Christian. Growing up in a beautiful, mosaic-encrusted villa, Faith had everything the world could offer and her future looked bright, except for one thing – she had accepted her nurse’s Christian faith.\n\nTo understand why this was a problem, we must understand Emperor Diocletian. He had announced, on assuming office, his intention to revive morality within the realm, since immorality was sapping Roman virtue and, therefore, the Empire’s viability and strength. He also believed that a revival of the traditional Roman gods was key, because an empire united in its religious praxis would be stronger. This was not a problem for most pagans in most places because gods were gods, even if their names varied by region. This was obviously not the case for Christians, however.\n\nDiocletian launched a persecution designed to force everyone to the same cult. Dacian, Prefect of the Province in which Faith lived, came to Agen to observe his subjects’ loyalty—that is, to see if they were being good pagans and, if not, to kill them.\n\nWhile many Christians were terrified but Faith voluntarily surrendered to the authorities. Imagine how frightened she must have been. She likely prayed for strength and for the words to convert her persecutors. Dacian probably had some nervousness too. After all, putting a twelve-year-old girl on trial would be a touchy situation, especially for a capital crime. Who wants to execute a child? Better to get her to apostatise but how? During the trial Faith gave a brave, remarkable defense of Christianity. Fine, Dacian told her, keep your beliefs. Just sacrifice to the goddess Diana in the town’s temple.\n\nFaith refused and Dacian lost patience with the girl. He ordered her bound to a brazen bed and roasted. Pitch was thrown on the fire to make its flames flare and burn her legs. This happened in public, so that the crowds could witness the fate awaiting Christians.\n\nThe problem for Dacian was that little Faith refused to cooperate. She cried, yes but she did not scream or beg for mercy. After a miraculous rainstorm extinguished the flames, Dacian had her beheaded. Seeing all this, the mob was moved, not to contempt for Christianity but to pity for Faith. Their only contempt was for Dacian, the child executioner. They wondered what god of theirs could give a mere maiden such strength. Realising the answer was “None,” many converted on the spot. In turn, most of these received martyrdom days later.\n\nAfter her death St Faith developed a reputation as something of a practical joker. If someone was stingy with a donation left for her Shrine’s upkeep, small misfortunes might befall them. For instance, a dying woman promised S. Faith she would will her most precious ring to the Abbey. Afterward her husband—possibly for its sentimental value, or maybe the thing had cost him a good deal of money—thought better of his wife’s last pledge. He instead used the ring as his second wife’s wedding band. Shortly the ring finger of the new wife swelled so much that it became unbearably painful. The couple beat a hasty path to the Shrine. There, when the lady blew her nose, the ring flew off her hand with such force that it left a crack in the flooring.\n\nOn another occasion, Faith’s prayers restored sight to a man named Guibert, whose eyes had been torn from their sockets. Wanting to keep the recipient of so great a miracle close, the Monks who cared for St Faith’s Shrine gave him the job of selling candles. It seems Guibert was a good businessman and soon became quite rich. But as so often happens, when success came, devotion to Our Lord went. St Faith reproached Guibert for his ingratitude. She had prayed Jesus would restore his sight, and this is how Guibert repaid her? So Guibert lost sight in one eye. This happened repeatedly: He would mend his ways, gain his eyes, grow successful again, fall into sin, lose the eye, and so on.\n\nThe Monks would parade Faith’s relics around the Monastery grounds. With the greatest pomp, they processed while holding candles and they sang all day. By evening they were exhausted and famished. Once when many people had prayed, the intercession of St Faith wrought many miracles. With each miracle the Monks would sing a Te Deum. At the end of the day, the Monks sat down under a tree to have a picnic but each time they were about to sink their teeth into their meager food, someone would cry, “A miracle!” and the Monks would have to get up and sing again.\n\nThirty-eight churches in England alone are named after St Faith. There are many more in northern Spain and southern France and her fame spread to the Americas via the conquistadors. Indeed, at least four Cities in the United States are named after her, including Santa Fe, New Mexico. And in Brazil alone 22 Cities bear her name.\n\nExcept for what she said in court, St. Faith never preached. She never wrote an epistle. Her preaching and writing were her actions. The bravery and resolve of this young maiden astounded the crowds. Perceiving something special about the God she worshiped, they converted. And she was just a child. God makes up for what we lack.\n\nHoly Spirit, through Your ineffable gifts, draw us to constant conversion. Renew our hearts. Let our actions preach eloquent sermons that draw people to Christ, far better than our poor words could do. Help us to love You, Holy Father, to do everything for You, and to remain firm in that love, no matter the hardships we encounter, so that, with St Faith, we may wear an eternal crown in Heaven. (Partially excerpted from “Saint Who?: – 39 Holy Unknowns” by Brian O’Neel).\n\nIn the fifth century, Dulcitius, Bishop of Agen, ordered the construction of a Basilica dedicated to her, later restored in the 8th century and enlarged in the 15th but sadly demolished in 1892 for urban development – horrible\n\nContrary to all custom, however, the centre of the cult of Faith was not the Basilica but the Church of Conques-enRouergue, where in the 9th Century. some of her relics had been transported, see the Reliquary below. Here there was also a Monastery, which, due to being on the road frequented by pilgrims Compostella, became in turn, famous and a pilgrimage destination in its own right. The cult of Faith thus spread throughout Europe and then also in America, where numerous cities and churches were dedicated to her. Among the most important are the Conches Abbey in Normandy and the Church of Sélestat, in Alsace.\n\nLa Madonna della Riconciliazione e della Pace / Our Lady of Reconciliation and Peace, Balestrino Italy (1949) – 4 October\n\nCaterina Richero was born on 7 October 1940 in Bergalla, the highest hamlet of Balestrino, of a humble peasant family.\n\nShe was the first of four siblings and her life passed in the serenity of childhood until the age of nine. On 4 October 1949, something radically changed her life. Something that will lead Catherine to humbly sacrifice her life with a continuous and silent witness of faith. A life devoted to prayer and devotion to that female figure who appeared to her 138 times until 5 November 1986 and who, on 5 June 1950 when asked: ” Who are you?” replied: ” I am the Immaculate Conception.”\n\nCatarina’s life, from that distant day in 1949 was by no means easy. She had to face the ridicule and mistrust of many and above all, she had to stick to what was given to her by the Bishop. She was also forbidden to go to Mount Croce but the Madonna began to appear in Catarina’s home.\n\nIn all those years, Our Lady asked her to pray constantly for the conversion of sinners and to do many penances for all, without faith. On 5 October 1971 she said: “ On Mount Croce you will find light and strength and I, in this place, will obtain many graces for you.”\n\nNow on Monte Croce there is a splendid Chapel with a Statue of Christ awaiting pilgrims at the top of a staircase. Inside, intent on arranging the flowers on the Altar or absorbed in prayers, Catarina … who with her silent presence tells everyone much more than thousands of articles and books could say.\n\nThe Statue venerated in the Chapel of the Sanctuary was crowned on 7 October 1992 by Msgr. Mario Oliveri.\n\nIn her own words, Caterina: http://www.santuariomontecroce.it/index.php/it/testimonianza\n\nAnd the complete history here:\n\nhttp://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/96698\n\nSt Francis of Assisi OFM (c 1181–1226) (Memorial)\n\nSt Francis!:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.wordpress.com/2017/10/04/saint-of-the-day-4-october-st-francis-of-assisi-o-f-m-1181-1226/\n\nAND:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.com/2018/10/04/saint-of-the-day-4-october-st-francis-of-assisi-ofm-1181-2-1226-the-brother-of-jesus/\n\nAND:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.com/2020/10/04/saint-of-the-day-4-october-st-francis-of-assisi-ofm-c-1181-1226/\n\nSt Adauctus of Ephesus\n\nBl Alfonso Tabela\n\nSt Ammon the Great (c 286-c 348) Hermit, Layman\n\nSt Aurea\n\nSt Berenice\n\nSt Caius of Corinth\n\nSt Callisthene of Ephesus\n\nSt Crispus of Corinth\n\nSt Damaris of Athens\n\nSt Diogenes of Milan\n\nSt Domnina\n\nSt Hierotheus\n\nBl Julian Majali\n\nSt Lucius of Alexandria\n\nSt Peter of Damascus\n\nSt Petronius (Died c 450) Bishop of Bologna\n\nAbout St Petronius:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.com/2019/10/04/saint-of-the-day-4-october-saint-petronius-died-c-450/\n\nSt Prosdoce\n\nSt Quintius of Tours\n\n—\n\nMartyrs of Alexandria – 2+ saints: A group of Christians, men and women, young and old, murdered together for their faith.

In the following century, a panel painting in the Convent’s cloister gained a reputation for miracles, resulting in the building of a separate Chapel to give due veneration to Our Lady and to accommodate the pilgrims.\n\nAnother vow was paid after the plague of 1632, which spared Rennes the serious devastation which the surrounding regions suffered. In thanks,giving to the Madonna, the City gave Our Lady of Good News a solid silver model of the town and, from 1634, observed a votive celebration every year on 8 September, the Feast of Mary’s Birth. Another miracle occurred during the great fire of 23 December 1720, when, as their wooden houses burned, the people of Rennes saw Our Lady of Good News look down in compassion from the sky.\n\nDuring the French Revolution, the silver model, was melted down. The Chapel was destroyed and the Convent used to store fodder. A gardener saved the holy image, which he gave to the neighbouring Church of St Aubin. In 1849, a cholera epidemic inspired a new vow. A new silver-plated model city was commissioned from Napoleon III’s goldsmith and the September votive feast reinstated. When St Aubin’s became too small for all the pilgrims, a new Church was built, dedicated in 1904 to St Aubin and Notre-Dame de Bonne Nouvelle.\n\nThe painting was canonically crowned in 1908. In recent years the votive feast has been held on the first Sunday in October rather than 8 September.\n\nSt Adalgott of Chur\n\nBl Agostina of the Assumption\n\nSt Candidus the Martyr\n\nSt Cyprian of Toulon\n\nBl Damian de Portu\n\nSt Dionysius the Aeropagite\n\nBl Dominic Spadafora\n\nSt Ewald the Black\n\nSt Ewald the Fair\n\nSt Froilan\n\nSt Gerard of Brogne (c 895 – 959) Priest, Abbot of Brogne, Reformer.\n\nSt Gerard’s Story:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.com/2018/10/03/saint-of-the-day-3-october-st-gerard-of-brogne-c-895-959/\n\nSt Hesychius\n\nBl Juan Tapia\n\nBl Maddalena the Greater\n\nSt Maximian of Bagaia\n\nSt Menna\n\nBlessed Szilárd István Bogdánffy (1911-1953) Bishop, Martyr\n\nHis Life:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.com/2019/10/03/saint-of-the-day-3-october-blessed-szilard-istvan-bogdanffy-1911-1953/\n\nSt Theodore Guerin SP (1798 – 1856) Religious, Foundress of the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods and numberous schools, Educator.\n\nAbout St Theodore here:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.wordpress.com/2017/10/03/saint-of-the-day-3-october-st-theodore-guerin-sp-1798-1856/\n\nBl Utto of Metten\n\nSt Virila OSB (Died c 950) Abbot\n\nSt Widradus\n\n—\n\nMartyrs of Alexandria – 9 saints: A number of Christian martyrs remembered together.

The region was colonized by Portuguese Catholics but was invaded by Dutch Calvinists who soon took over the whole territory. They immediately made a policy of the persecution of Catholics. On Sunday 16 July 1645 at Cunhau, Brazil, 69 people were gathered in the Chapel of Our Lady of the Candles for Mass celebrated by Father Andre de Soveral. At the moment of the elevation a group of Dutch soldiers attack the Chapel, murdering many of the faithful including Father Andre; the parishioners died professing their faith and asking pardon for their sins. On 3 October 1645, 200 armed Indians and a band of Flemish troops, led by a fanatical Calvinist convert, hacked to death an unknown number of people of Rio Grande including:\n\n• Blessed Ambrosio Francisco Ferro\n\n• Blessed André de Soveral\n\n• Blessed Antônio Baracho\n\n• Blessed Antônio Vilela\n\n• Blessed Antônio Vilela Cid\n\n• Blessed Diogo Pereira\n\n• Blessed Domingos Carvalho\n\n• Blessed Estêvão Machado de Miranda\n\n• Blessed Francisco de Bastos\n\n• Blessed Francisco Mendes Pereira\n\n• Blessed João da Silveira\n\n• Blessed João Lostau Navarro\n\n• Blessed João Martins\n\n• Blessed José do Porto\n\n• Blessed Manuel Rodrigues de Moura\n\n• Blessed Mateus Moreira\n\n• Blessed Simão Correia\n\n• Blessed Vicente de Souza Pereira\n\nand other lay people whose names have not come down to us.\n\nThe Holy Guardian Angels (Memorial)\n\nBlessed Angels here:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.wordpress.com/2017/10/02/saint-of-the-day-the-holy-guardian-angels-2-october/\n\nAND – St Bernard on the Guardian Angels:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.com/2019/10/02/memorial-of-the-holy-guardian-angels-2-octobe-sermon-on-the-holy-guardian-angels-by-st-bernard/\n\nMatka Boża Różańcowa / Our Lady of the Rosary, Krakow, Poland (1600s) – First Sunday of October, 2 October:\n\nIn the Dominican Basilica of the Trinity in Cracow is a large Chapel dedicated to the Mother of God of the Rosary. The icon on its main Altar, crowned on 2 October 1921, is a copy of the ancient Salus Populi Romani (Health of the Roman People) image in the Basilica of St Mary Major of the Snows in Rome — the icon Pope Gregory the Great carried in procession to end the plague of 597. During the Battle of Lepanto (7 October 571), when ships of a coalition of Christian countries routed the Turkish navy off Greece, Pope Pius V prayed the Rosary with a large group of faithful before the Roman icon. The old image thus became associated with the newer devotion of the Rosary and with saving Europe from Ottoman rule.\n\nChurches throughout Catholic Europe were dedicated to Our Lady of the Rosary and copies of the Salus Populi Romani proliferated. Cardinal Maciejowski brought such a copy from Rome to Cracow in 1600. The image played a part in the “Polish Lepanto” in 1621, when at Khotyn, Ukraine (then Chocim, Poland) an allied force of Poles, Lithuanians and Ukrainians faced a Turkish army twice its size. On 3 October, the Bishop of Krakow led an hours-long Rosary procession with the holy icon. The entire population joined in. When the Turks gave up their attack and signed a treaty, Our Lady of the Rosary gained another victory. Her feast is celebrated in Krakow on the first Sunday of October.\n\nThe Swedish deluge contributed to the destruction of the original image of the Mother of God. T he cult, however, was so strong that a copy of the previous painting was quickly funded. The present one comes from the 50s and 60s of the 17th century. Numerous votive offerings made on the occasion of receiving favours have also survived from that time. The oldest exhibited in the Church are dated to 1703, the older ones are in the Archdiocese Museum. The love for the Blessed Mother is also evidenced by the silver dress donated in the 1770s by the Działyński family,and the sceptre of Our Lady of the “Pious Gregory of Pierzchno” foundation at the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nSt Alfonso del Rio\n\nSt Andrea Ximenez\n\nBlessed Antoine Chevrier TOSF (1825-1879) Third Order Franciscan, Priest, Founder of the Sisters of Prado and the Institute of the Priests of Prado.\n\nAbout Blessed Antoince:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.com/2018/10/02/saint-of-the-day-2-october-blessed-antoine-chevrier-t-o-s-f-1825-1879/\n\nSt Beregisius\n\nSt Eleutherius of Nicomedia\n\nBl Georges-Edme René\n\nSt Gerinus\n\nSt Leodegar of Autun OSB (c 625-679) Bishop and Martyr, Monk, Abbot, Reformer.\n\nHis Life and Death:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.com/2020/10/02/saint-of-the-day-2-october-saint-leodegar-of-autun-c-625-679-martyr/\n\nSt Leudomer\n\nSt Maria Antonina Kratochwil\n\nSt Modesto of Sardinia\n\nSt Saturius of Soria\n\nSt Theophilus of Bulgaria\n\nSt Thomas de Cantilupe of Hereford (c 1218-1282) Bishop\n\nSt Ursicinus II\n\n—\n\nMartyred in Antioch, Syria: Martyred in one of the early persecutions, date unknown.\n\nSt Cyril of Antioch\n\nSt Primus of Antioch\n\nSt Secundarius of Antioch\n\nMartyred in Nagasaki, Japan: A husband, wife and two sons, who were all martyred together in the persecutions in Japan.

The Sanctuary was born in the places of the apparitions of 1399, the only one in history where both the Madonna and her Divine Son, Jesus Christ, the Saviour aooeared with His Mother and the second Marian Apparition of 1711.\n\nFor over six centuries the Sanctuary of the Madonna di Valverde has been a destination of pilgrimages from all over the north of Italy and is, above al,l in the heart of the community of Rezzato – Virle, which every year, on the Feast of St Anna on 26 July, recalls, with a solemn historical procession, the miracle of the apparitions.\n\nIn 1399, more than six hundred years ago, during the ploughing work in a field near Valverde, the oxen pulling the plough stopped and bent their knees. A man in a red robe and a blue mantle (Christ) appeared to the worker who guided them and ordered him to throw the three loaves that he kept in his saddlebag into the nearby pond. The peasant got ready to obey the order but was held back by the Apparition of the Madonna who advised him to return to beg the Lord, to revoke the order just given. If the three loaves had touched the waters of the lake, three scourges would have been unleashed (famine, plague and war) with which Christ intended to punish men for their impiety. Jesus, by the insistence of tHis Holy Mother, consented to the peasant’s plea and agreed that only one of the loaves need be thrown into the water and, therefore, only the scourge of the epidemic would spread throughout the area.

On that occasion, Pietro Garino found the small pictures, which are still preserved in the Church, depicting the Madonna of Loreto and San Carlo Borromeo, leaning against the facade of the Chapel. They were in bad shape. Pietro took them with him to have them restored and promised himself to bring them back to the Chapel the following year, keeping them in the meantime at his home in Forno.\n\nTwice the pictures eluded his custody – the first time he found them right up there, at the mouth of the Vallone di Sea, where he had gone to collect leaves for the litter intended for livestock. On that occasion he had an apparition – the Virgin appeared to him between two women and promised him to stop the plague that claimed victims among the population of the plain. Brought home by Pietro, the paintings again disappeared from his home and were found in the same place as the apparition – it was a precise indication of the Virgin’s desire to see a Chapel built in that place.\n\nA Chapel was built at the spot of the apparition, of which the remains have recently been found. The current building dates back to the second half of the 1700s; it is the work of Luigi Baretta; internally it has elements of considerable artistic and historical interest. The marvelous Altar by Prinotto, a masterpiece of eighteenth-century cabinet-making; the baroque reliquary, in which the pictures are kept; hundreds of ex-votos, including some of considerable value.\n\nHistorically, a Madonna with black features did not appear but the Sanctuary is known as such, as the faces of the Madonna and the Child she holds in her arms are ebony. The current Statue is the work of Raimondo Santifaller, from Ortisei and replaces the original one from the 18th century, stolen in 1977.\n\nTo access the Sanctuary it is necessary to climb the 440 steps that must be taken to reach the small square where the Sanctuary stands and which, pilgrims climb on their knees and in prayer.\n\nThe Sanctuary is open from July to September and Our Lady is celebrated annually on the Feast of the Assumption (16 August), the Nativity of Mary (8 September) and the Apparition of the Virgin Mary (30 September).\n\nThe video below shows this beautiful Sanctuary very clearly.\n\nSt Jerome (Memorial) (347-419) Father and Doctor\n\nSt Jerome, here:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.com/2018/09/30/saint-of-the-day-30-september-st-jerome-347-419-father-and-doctor-of-the-church-2/\n\nAND:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/saint-of-the-day-30-september-st-jerome-347-419-father-and-doctor-of-the-church/\n\nSt Amato of Nusco (c 1003-1093) Bishop, Confessor, Monk, Apostle of the poor.\n\nBiography:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.com/2020/09/30/saint-of-the-day-30-september-saint-amato-of-nusco-c-1003-1093/\n\nSt Antoninus of Piacenza\n\nSt Castus of Piacenza\n\nSt Colman of Clontibret\n\nSt Desiderius of Piacenza\n\nSt Enghenedl of Anglesey\n\nSt Eusebia of Marseilles\n\nBl Frederick Albert\n\nSt Gregory the Illuminator (c 257 – c 331) “Apostle to Armenia” and “Father of Armenia”- Bishop, First Patriarch of the Armenian Church, Missionary, Wonder-worker.\n\nBiography:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.com/2019/09/30/saint-of-the-day-30-september-saint-gregory-the-illuminator-c-257-c-331/\n\nSt Honorius of Canterbury (Died 653) Archbishop of Canterbury\n\nSt Ismidone of Die\n\nBl Jean-Nicolas Cordier\n\nSt Laurus\n\nSt Leopardus the Slave\n\nBl Ludwik Gietyngier\n\nSt Midan of Anglesey\n\nSt Simon of Crépy\n\nSt Ursus the Theban\n\nSt Victor the Theban\n\n—\n\nMartyrs of Valsery Abbey: An unknown number of Premonstratensian monks at the Abbey of Notre-Dame de Valsery, Picardie, France who were martyred by Calvinists.

The Sanctuary is located on the Camino de Santiago hence it’s popularity dating from the 9th Century when pilgrims stopped to rest in the hostel provided. They were known as “the Novenarios” as, during their rest, they prayed the St Michael Novena before his Feast Day on 29 September.\n\nIn honour of the Virgen del Fresno two festivals are held, one on 8 September and the other 28 of the same month preceded by a Novena that has traditionally started at four in the afternoon.\n\nThe current image dates from 1975, since the original was lost in the looting it suffered in 1936.

On that day, two shepherds – Miron Makaruk and Aleksander Stelmaszuk – looking for the lost cattle in the bushes, noticed a stone image of the Mother of God hanging on a wild pear tree, which gave an extraordinary glow. Wanting to take the painting off, one of the bravest young men climbed the tree but each time fell to the ground. The local inhabitants, seeing what was happening, began to pray fervently. Soon, Zabłocki’s elders from nearby Bordziłówka arrived and only he, as an unusually prayerful man, took the painting off the tree. Droplets of “sweat” appeared on the image and this phenomenon continued for a long time. Then the painting was taken to the manor in Bukowice. This extraordinary find deeply touched the religious and secular authorities of the time. Soon a wooden Church was erected on the site of the appearance of the Image. On 26 September 1695, a Parish was established in Lesna. From the very beginning, the Image attracted crowds of believers who experienced many favours thanks to the Blessed Mother, especially cures of illnesses. The Bishop of Lutsk, Franciszek Prażmowski, issued a decree in 1700, in which he stated that the appearance of the Image should be considered miraculous.\n\nIn the Lesnian Image, Mary is presented, embracing the Child Jesus with her right arm. The Child Jesus is holding the book with his right hand and his left hand is raised up in a gesture of teaching. Mary, standing in half-figure, is facing the viewer. In her left hand she holds an open book, on which, with outstretched wings, a dove – a symbol of the Holy Spirit – is supported. The figure of the Mother of God is covered with a coat.\n\nThe image of the Mother of God is a relief carved in field stone. The dimensions of the Image are: width 29.3 cm, height 31.4 cm, thickness 4.6 cm, weighs 9.5 kg.\n\nOn the site of the appearance of the Image of the Mother of God in 1718. a small Church was built. It exists to this day and is called the “Chapel of the Appearance of the Miraculous Image.” In 1727, the Parish of Leśna and the care of the Miraculous Image were taken over by the Pauline Fathers from Jasna Góra. They began the construction of a magnificent Church, which was erected in the years 1731 – 1758. It was consecrated under the invocation of the “Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul” on 8 September 1758. Huge crowds of the faithful of the Latin and Uniate rite were drawn to the Leśnia Sanctuary.\n\nThe situation changed with the partitions of Poland, when Leśna found itself under the Russian partition. After the fall of the January Uprising, the Lesnian Sanctuary found itself in a desperate situation. As part of the repression for helping the insurgents, on the night of 27-28 October 1864 , the Pauline Fathers were deported from Leśna. It was then, that the Bishop of Janów, Beniamin Szymanski, ordered to secretly take out the Miraculous Image and put a copy in its place. It was done in 1865. Soon the tsarist government abolished the Podlasie Diocese. The exiled Bishop took the Miraculous Picture with him to Łomża. He put it in the Church of the Benedictine Sisters. In 1875, the Church in Leśnia was taken over for the purposes of the Orthodox Church. Then the pilgrimages stopped. In 1889, an Orthodox nunnery was established in Lesna. It was to become the centre of Russification of Poles. In 1905 Tsar Nicholas II came to Lesna, whose relative was the superior of the nuns of Leśna. After the outbreak of World War I, the sisters left Leśna and took with them a copy of the painting of the Mother of God, still being firmly convinced that it was the original painting.\n\nOn 16 August 1915, the temple in Leśnia returned to Catholic worship. On 25 May 1919 . The Pauline Fathers returned to Lesna and immediately began renovation works in the Sanctuary. First of all, the search for the Miraculous Picture began, which was not found until 5 May 1926 in Łomża. It happened thanks to Fr. Aleksander Łaziński. After the canonical trial conducted by Bishop H. Przeździecki, the Miraculous Image returned\n\nin a triumphant parade from Siedlce to Leśna on 25 September 1927. It was a great celebration for the entire Podlasie Diocese and over 25,000 people attended this event. In the interwar period, the Pauline Fathers decorated the Sanctuary. They looked after the pilgrims who were again in large numbers at the feet of their Lesnian Mother.\n\nIn 1939, the difficult time of the Nazi occupation began. In the fall of 1940, the Germans occupied the Monastery and expelled the Pauline Fathers.\n\nAfter the war, in 1951, under the direction of the Prior – Father Jerzy Tomziński, the Church received a Pulpit and an Organ.\n\nOn 18 August 1963 , the Primate of Poland, Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński, together with the Bishop of Podlasie, Ignacy Świrski, crowned the Miraculous Image with papal crowns. From 11 to 12 June 1970, Cardinal Karol Wojtyła stayed in Leśna. On 25 September 1977, the 50th anniversary of the return of the Miraculous Image was solemnly celebrated. In 1983, the solemn celebrations of 300 years of the appearance of the Miraculous Image took place and in 1984 the Church in Leśnia was elevated to the rank of a Minor Basilica. In 1992, a break-in was made to the temple in Leśnia and attempts were made to steal the golden crowns from the Miraculous Image. In 1995, the 300th anniversary of the establishment of the Parish in Leśna Podlaska was celebrated. This time the ceremony was presided over by the Primate of Poland, Cardinal Józef Glemp. In 1996, works on frescoes and paintings in the Basilica began and they were completed in 2002. On 26 September 2019, the Leśnia Sanctuary celebrated the 100th anniversary of the return of the Pauline Order to Leśna Podlaska. – https://lesnapodlaska.paulini.pl/historia-sanktuarium/\n\nSt Cosmas (Optional Memorial)\n\nSt Damian (Optional Memorial)\n\n(Died c 286 ) Martyrs.

After several events, he set out to go to Rome and was killed for the Christian faith in a place called Acqua Mala, near Pesaro.\n\nRegarding the place of his Martyrdom, while some believe that it took place not very far from the City, the tradition which speaks of borders, gives value to a tradition, according to which, Terence suffered Martyrdom near our Abbey of St Tomaso in Foglia, located precisely on the territorial border between Pesaro and Urbino. This tradition is corroborated by the existence in those places, of a perennial pool of sulphurous water, which not only gushes, even in the greatest droughts but, which although repeatedly diverted or destroyed, has always returned to rise again.\n\nIt is called “the Water of St Terence,” considering that the Patron Saint was Martyred there and his body was then thrown into the nearby whirlpool of the water – mala; which now no longer exists because the valley was filled in, in subsequent agricultural works.\n\nHis body may have been buried by Bishop Florentius of Pesaro outside the City, close to Caprile, which ancient documents call the Valle di St Terenzio. Another tradition states that his body was buried by a local woman named Theodosia. His relics were then translated to the basilica of San Decenzio (now the Chiesa del Cimitero centrale) before being translated, in the sixth century, to the new Cathedral at Pesaro by Bishop Felix of Pesaro.\n\nThe relics, placed initially in a crypt, were transferred by Giovanni Benedetti in 1447 to a large Altar in which the relics were placed in a wooden urn, on which the aforementioned painter Bellinzoni depicted Terence. The urn is now found at the Museo Civico, in Palazzo Toschi-Mosca, and the relics themselves were translated to a new urn in a new Cathedral Chapel inaugurated in 1909\n\nAs a soldier Saint, Terence is considered to have appeared twice in times of crisis, the second vision occurring on 9 June 1793, in the times of the Cisalpine Republic, when Pesaro was besieged by French troops: a horseman appeared on the walls of the City, accompanied by a woman (Our Lady) dispensing munitions. The vision terrified the French so much, that they abandoned their siege. In gratitude, Terence was officially proclaimed Patron of the City on 20 March 1802.\n\nTerence’s most famous figuration in art is his minor appearance—as a young soldier Saint—in a predella panel of Giovanni Bellini’s “Pesaro Altarpiece, The Coronation of the Virgin” (ca. 1475–80). In it, Terence, as the City’s Patron, holds a model representing the Nuova Rocca, or Fortezza Costanzo, the Citadel of Pesaro newly rebuilt by Costanzo Sforza. The Altarpiece is below – St Terence is bottom right of the bottom panel – see amplified image above.\n\nNuestra Señora de las Mercedes / Our Lady of Mercy/Ransom, Barcelona, Spain (1218) – 1 August, 24 September:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.com/2021/08/01/feast-saint-peter-in-chains-the-portiuncula-indulgence-nuestra-senora-de-las-mercedes-our-lady-of-mercy-barcelona-spain-1218-and-memorials-of-the-saints-1-august/\n\nOur Lady of Walsingham / Virgin of the Sea (1061) – 24 September:\n\nThe story of the Walsingham Shrine begins in Saxon times. In 1061, the Lady of the Manor, Richeldis de Faverches, was taken in spirit to Nazareth, shown the House where the Annunciation took place and asked by Our Lady, to build a replica in Norfolk. She was promised that ‘Whoever seeks my help there will not go away empty-handed.‘ The simple wooden house that she built soon became the focus of special devotion to Our Lady. The ‘Holy House’ was later encased in stone to protect it from the elements.\n\nIn 1153, the Augustinian Canons founded a Priory to care for the spiritual needs of the pilgrims. Their magnificent Priory Church was added in the fifteenth century. Only the ruin of the Priory Arch remains and archaeology has placed the site of the ‘Holy House’ in its shadow.\n\nWalsingham became one of the foremost Shrines of medieval Christendom. Among the pilgrims to the ‘Holy House’ were many royal visitors. Henry III in 1226, Edward I (eleven times), Edward II in 1315, Edward III in 1361, Richard II in 1383, Edward IV in 1469, Henry VI in 1487 (and many other times) and Henry VIII in 1511, in thanksgiving for the birth of his son, Prince Henry.\n\nIn 1340, the Slipper Chapel was built at Houghton St Giles, a mile outside Walsingham. This was the final ‘Station’ Chapel on the way to Walsingham. It was here, that pilgrims would remove their shoes to walk the final ‘Holy Mile’ to the Shrine barefoot.\n\nErasmus, the Dutch scholar, visited Walsingham in 1513 and was impressed by the splendour of the Shrine. He wrote:\n\n‘When you look inside, you would say, it is the abode of saints, so brilliantly does it shine with gems, gold and silver … Our Lady stands in the dark at the right side of the Altar … a little image, remarkable neither for its size, material or workmanship.’\n\nThis was soon to come to an end. Henry VIII ordered the dissolution of the monasteries and in 1538 the Priory was closed, the ‘Holy House’ burned to the ground and the Statue of Our Lady taken to London to be destroyed.\n\nIn 1896 Miss Charlotte Boyd bought the Slipper Chapel, which had seen centuries of secular use. She devoted herself to its restoration. The Statue of the Mother and Child was carved at Oberammergau and based on the design of the original statue – a design found on the medieval seal of Walsingham Priory, an imprint of which is in the British Museum.\n\nThe first Mass since the Reformation was offered in the Slipper Chapel on 15 August 1934 and a few days later Cardinal Francis Bourne led a pilgrimage of 10,000 people to the Chapel and declared it to be the Catholic National Shrine of Our Lady.\n\nMadonna de Val Camonica, Berzo Inferiore (BS), Italy (1616) – 24 September:\n\nSt Anathalon of Milan\n\nSt Andochius of Autun\n\nSt Anthony Gonzalez\n\nBlessed Anton Martin Slomsek (1800-1862) Bishop, Writer, Poet, Educator, Reformer, Preacher, Founder of schools, a newspaper, Advocate of literacy and the Slovenian culture and language.\n\nBiographical details here:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.wordpress.com/2017/09/24/saint-of-the-day-24-september-blessed-anton-martin-slomshek-1800-1862/\n\nAND:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.com/2018/09/24/saint-of-the-day-24-september-blessed-anton-martin-slomsek-1800-1862/\n\nSt Chuniald\n\nBl Colomba Matylda Gabriel\n\nSt Coprio\n\nSt Erinhard\n\nSt Felix of Autun\n\nSt Gerard Sagredo OSB (980-1046) Bishop and Martyr, “The Apostle of Hungary,” Venetian nobleman, Benedictine monk, Prior of San Giorgio, Missionary to Hungary, Adviser to King Saint Stephen, Tutor to Prince Saint Emeric, Hermit, Bishop of Csanád, Writer, Reformerr\n\nBiography:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.com/2020/09/24/saint-of-the-day-24-september-saint-gerard-sagredo-osb-980-1046-bishop-and-martyr-the-apostle-of-hungary/\n\nSt Geremarus\n\nSt Gislar\n\nSt Isarnus of Toulouse\n\nSt Lupus of Lyons\n\nSt Pacificus of Severino OFM (1653-1721) Priest, Franciscan Friar, Mystic, Miracle-worker, Missionary, Superior of the Friary of San Severino and joyful sufferer for Christ.\n\nAbout St Pacificus:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.com/2019/09/24/saint-of-the-day-24-september-saint-pacificus-of-severino-ofm-1653-1721/\n\nSt Paphnutius of Egypt\n\nBl Robert Hardesty\n\nSt Rusticus of Clermont\n\nSt. Rupert of Salzburg\n\nSt Terence of Persaro (c 210-c 247) Martyr Layman\n\nSt Thyrsus of Autun\n\nSt Ysarn of Saint Victor\n\nBl William Spenser\n\n—\n\nMartyrs of Chalcedon – (49 saints): Forty-nine Christian choir singers of the church in Chalcedon in Asia Minor who were martyred together in their persecutions of Diocletian in 304.\n\nMartyred in the Spanish Civil War:\n\n• Blessed Antonio Pancorbo López\n\n• Blessed Esteban García y García\n\n• Blessed José María Ferrándiz Hernández\n\n• Blessed Juan Francisco Joya Corralero\n\n• Blessed Luis de Erdoiza Zamalloa\n\n• Blessed Manuel Gómez Contioso\n\n• Blessed Melchor Rodríguez Villastrigo\n\n• Blessed Pascual Ferrer Botella\n\n• Blessed Rafael Rodríguez Mesa\n\n• Blessed Santiago Arriaga Arrien\n\nNuestra Senora de Valvanera / Our Lady of Valvanera, La Rioja, Spain (9th Century) – 23 September:\n\nThis image is a replica of the original which appears to have dated from the ninth century and is preserved in the Royal Abbey Shrine of Our Lady of Valvanera, or Valvanere, in Rioja, jealously guarded by Benedictine Monks. The oldest documents preserved, dates from the thirteenth century and tells how, according to tradition, the original image was found by a thief who later converted and became a hermit.\n\nThere was a thief named Nuno Onez, who was a hardened criminal and a “man of licentious life and dedicated to looting.” One day, however, upon hearing the prayer of a man who was to be his next victim, he was touched by Divine grace and repented of his many crimes, turning to the Blessed Virgin Mary to help him change his life. One day while he was praying, an Angel appeared to him to tell him to go to Valvanera and search for an oak that stood out from the rest, with a fountain that gushed at its feet and surrounded by swarms of bees. There, in the branches of a strong and noble oak, in the presence of a fountain of pure and clear water, the trunk of which was overflowing with the sweetness of honey, he found an image of the Mother of God, the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\nNuno went to the place with a Priest on the following Sunday and found the image, just as the Angel had said. The Statue had probably been hidden there when the Moslems invaded the Iberian Peninsula in the 8th century. In that place, in the last third of the ninth century, he began to build a place of worship that became known as the Chapel of Santo Cristo. Soon there was a small group of hermits who met to pray around this image, men who eventually adopted a regular life inspired by the Rule of Saint Benedict. Thus, this small Shrine is believed to have given rise to the Monastery of Valvanera, where the Virgin is currently venerated.\n\nValvanera Monastery is surrounded by a forest near the Town of Anguiano in the valley of the Sierra Demand La Rioja. Its name derives from the Latin “Vallis Venaria,” which literally means: “Valley water veins.” The first Abbot was a man named Don Sancho in the year 990.\n\nOur Lady apparently has a preference for oak trees, since this is one of several Statues found in or on an oak tree. On that very spot today is seen the magnificent Church which Alphonsus IV, King of Castile, built in honour of the Mother of God in 1073 and which houses the image.\n\nShe, the valiant woman of Scripture, desired her children, her clients and her devotees to share in a spiritual manner, in the strength and the power of this mighty tree, which is certainly a symbol of her.\n\nSt Padre Pio/ Pius of Pietrelcina OFM Cap (1887-1968) (Memorial) Priest, Franciscan Capuchin Friar, Stigmatist, Mystic, Confessor.\n\nBiography here:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.wordpress.com/2017/09/23/saint-of-the-day-23-september-st-pio-of-pietrelcina-o-f-m-cap/\n\nSt Alfonso Burgos\n\nSt Adamnan of Iona/Eunan of Iona (c 628-704) Monk, Abbot\n\nBl Antonio of Tlaxcala\n\nBl Bernardina Maria Jablonska\n\nSt Cissa of Northumbria\n\nSt Constantius of Ancona\n\nBl Cristobal of Tlaxcala\n\nBl Emilie Tavernier Gamelin\n\nBl Francisco de Paula Victor\n\nBl Guy of Durnes\n\nBl Helen Duglioli\n\nBl Juan of Tlaxcala\n\nSt Pope Linus (c 10 – c 76) Successor to St Peter.

Since the time of the Crusades, it has been home to a rural Shrine frequented by mariners both Christian and Muslim in the 1500s and 1600s, who kept an oil lamp burning constantly before the crude stone Statue of the Madonna and Child.\n\nBut the island was not inhabited until 22 September 1843, when two steamships of Italian colonists arrived under Governor Bernardo Maria Sanvisente. In Madonna Valley, they found the Chapel dilapidated and the mutilated Statue of the Virgin on the ground. Sanvisente ordered the Chapel and Statue to be restored and a Mass sung every year on 22 September in honour of the Madonna of Porto Salvo and the settlement of the island. During World War II, bombs destroyed the Church, but the Madonna was unhurt and no-one killed.\n\nIn 1967, the Virgin and Child were crowned but in 1979 the precious crowns were stolen. The faithful soon raised money for new ones and the Madonna of Porto Salvo was recrowned on 21 September 1980.\n\nShe is the Patron of fishermen and her celebration now lasts two weeks. On the first Sunday of September, the Statue processes from its Shrine to the main Church in town, where it is honoured with special services until the big day of the 22nd, when it processes solemnly through the City streets. Of course, the festa is the occasion for general entertainment, games and food as well. On the 23rd, a final procession returns the Madonna to the Sanctuary outside town.\n\nWhilst exploring the story of this veneration of Our Lady, I discovered that on 22 September 2020 the “Key to the Island” was stolen. Below is the report in the local newspaper. Don Carmelo La Magra reassured all the islanders: “Whoever took it, repented, gave it back to me.” Great symbolic value – it is the key to the island in the hands of the Blessed Virgin:\n\n“The key of Our Lady has been returned. Whoever took it, repented, gave it back to me anonymously. We thank the Virgin Mary because this story ended well and we pray for each other.” It is with this message that Fr Carmelo La Magra, Priest of Lampedusa, reassured all the islanders last night.\n\nFor hours, the alarm had been circulating on social media: “The golden key of the Madonna of Porto Salvo has been stolen“. A key that has a single, important meaning – the key of Lampedusa in the hands of the Blessed Virgin. A theft carried out, according to what was reported yesterday, on her feast day, 22 September. A party that, however, this year, due to the Coronavirus emergency, did not take place. The carabinieri, last night, did not find anything. Neither to those of the company command of Agrigento, nor to those of the Lampedusa station. No complaint had been formalised, nor had there been any interventions in this regard. But the military, having received informal news, immediately took an interest in the “case.”\n\nA case that was resolved, fortunately, quickly and spontaneously. Because that key (which, according to what transpires, is not gold at all) was returned, as guaranteed by the Parish Priest of Lampedusa.\n\nSt Augustinus Yu Chin-Kil\n\nSt Basilia\n\nSt Digna of Rome\n\nSt Emerita of Rome\n\nSt Emmeramus\n\nSt Florentius the Venerable\n\nSt Gunthildis of Suffersheim (Died c 1057) Laywoman\n\nSt Ignatius of Santhia OFM Cap (1686-1770) Priest and Friar of the Capuchin Franciscans, renowned Spiritual Director, servant of the Confessional, apostle of charity Known as the “Father of Sinners and the Lost”\n\nBiography:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.com/2019/09/22/saint-of-the-day-22-september-saint-ignatius-of-santhia-ofm-cap-1686-1770/\n\nSt Irais\n\nSt Jonas\n\nBl Joseph Marchandon\n\nSt Lauto of Coutances\n\nSt Lindru of Partois\n\nSt Maurice & Co\n\nBl Otto of Freising\n\nSt Sadalberga\n\nSt Sanctinus of Meaux\n\nSt Silvanus of Levroux\n\nSt Thomas of Villanueva/Villanova OSA (1488-1555) Archbishop, Religious Priest of the Order of St Augustine, Confessor, Writer, Preacher, Teacher, Apostle of Charity, Mystic, Miracle-Worker often called “the Almsgiver” and “the Father of the Poor“, Reformer.\n\nAbout St Thomas here:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.com/2017/09/22/saint-of-the-day-22-september-st-thomas-of-villanova-o-s-a/\n\nMartyrs of the Theban Legion: Martyrs (c 287)\n\nA Roman imperial legion of 6,600 soldiers, all of whom were Christians; they had been recruited from the area around Thebes in Upper Egypt, were led by Saint Maurice and served under Emperor Maximian Herculeus. Around the year 287, Maximian led the army across the Alps to Agaunum, an area in modern Switzerland, in order to suppress a revolt by the Bagandre in Gaul. In connection with battle, the army offered public sacrifices to the Roman gods; the Theban Legion refused to participate.

Reaching Este in the evening, the man had stopped to sleep in the boat under the Borini bridge. Around midnight he was awakened by a female voice who called him three times. The man saw two beautiful ladies who enjoined him to follow them.\n\nStrangely finding the drawbridge of the City lowered, they walked towards the countryside where, in the locality of Tresto, one of the two ladies sat on the bank of a ditch and told the other to fetch her a bunch of grapes. Then she asked Giovanni if ​​he knew her. To his negative answer she said that she was Mary, the Mother of God. She then enjoined him not to amend his life and to do his best to have a Church built on that place according to the plan and the measures she illustrated to him.\n\nBut Giovanni objected saying that because of his poverty and ignorance, he would not be believed. Then Mary gave him a knife, instructing him to stick it into the ground and then to remove it. Giovanni obeyed and when he removed the blade from the ground, blood gushed. After having blessed him, the Madonna disappeared with her companion. T he next day Giovanni, afraid of not being believed, did not carry out the commands he had received but only confided in three friends. Losing his peace of mind, he eventually went with some people to the site of the apparition, where he tried to stick the knife into the ground, pulling it back wet with blood. Others wanted to try: the incredulous could not move the blade from the ground, while the others withdrew it bloody.\n\nThe miraculous event, renewed several times, convinced everyone to work together to erect the required Church. At the halfway point, due to the exceptional drought that had hit the area, there was no water. Everyone then invoked the help of Mary, who caused a spring appear next to the construction site. This spring since then, over the centuries, has been a source of miraculous cures just like the one at Lourdes. The custody of the Church, built in 9 months, was entrusted by the Paduan clergy to a Congregation of Mendicants of whom Giovanni wore the habit in a lay state.\n\nThe Sanctuary of Tresto became and remains a site of devotion and pilgrimage with the powerful and healing waters of the miraculous Spring, bringing many sick seeking cures. The Sanctuary preserves several works of art among which the painting on wood depicting the Virgin and Child shown above, stands out, a masterpiece attributed to Jacopo da Montagnana who created it between 1475 and 1480.\n\nSt Alexander of the Via Claudia\n\nBl Diego Hompanera París\n\nSt Eusebius of Phoenicia\n\nSt Francisco Pastor Garrido\n\nSt François Jaccard\n\nSt Gerulph\n\nSt Herminio García Pampliega\n\nSt Iphigenia\n\nSt Isaac of Cyprus\n\nBl Jacinto Martínez Ayuela\n\nSt Jacques Honoré Chastán\n\nSt Johannes Ri\n\nSt Jonah the Prophet\n\nBl José María Azurmendi Mugarza\n\nBl Josep Vila Barri\n\nSt Landelino of Ettenheim\n\nBl Manuel Torró García\n\nBlessed Mark Scalabrini of Modena OP (c 1420-1498)\n\nSt Maura of Troyes\n\nSt Meletius of Cyprus\n\nBl Nicolás de Mier Francisco\n\nSt Pamphilus of Rome\n\nSt Pierre Philibert Maubant\n\nSt Tôma Tran Van Thien\n\nBl Vicente Galbis Gironés\n\nBl Vicente Pelufo Orts\n\n—\n\nMartyrs of Gaza – 3 saints: Three brothers, Eusebius, Nestulus and Zeno, who were seized, dragged through the street, beaten and murdered by a pagan mob celebrating the renunciation of Christianity by Julian the Apostate.

The faithful keep the memory of this stone Statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which was located just inside the entrance of the Church and placed over a sculpted clam. In those days there would be a lamp burning before it on feast days and almost every day, the faithful offered small candles which they lit and rested on a circular iron candlestick that was placed before the Statue. It was well known that several people who prayed before this Statue were cured of various diseases but the devotion and respect of the people toward this image, grew more than ever at the time of the Bishop Conrad because of the miracle that occurred in the following manner:\n\nA woman named Helwide was in the Cathedral Saint-Etienne de Toul praying to the Blessed Virgin for consolation and the repose of the souls of her husband and daughter who had recently died. It was about midnight, when the Canons were praying Matins, that the Blessed Virgin Mary suddenly appeared to her.\n\nThe Virgin Mary ordered Helwide to go immediately to find a man named Rimbert, who was the guardian of “The Door to the Chair.” The Door to the Chair gave access to the Castrum, a little entrance to the City near Tanner Street. Helwide was urged to go quickly, for an enemy proposed to enter the City by the door to set their homes on fire and fill the streets with blood.\n\nRegaining her senses after the vision, Helwide got up feeling very puzzled. She was hesitant about what she should do, though as Rimbert’s home was not far distant and was on her way home anyway, she decided she would indeed go there.\n\nNo sooner had Helwide stepped out of the Church, than she met the night-watch on patrol. She told them the tale of her vision and they responded by mocking her and making derogatory jokes. Despite this, two of them still decided to follow and actually see what would happen if Helwide could find the porter she sought.\n\nThe pair arrived with Helwide at the house and simply thrust the door open. Rimbert sat on his bunk, seeming startled, yet as if expecting the visit. Helwide briefly stated the purpose of her visit and Rimbert exclaimed, “I had precisely the same vision and the same warning! I do not know if it occurred in my sleep or in the state of wakefulness but I have been told that the Statue will move her foot in testimony of the truth!”\n\nAt these words, all those present were seized with a great desire to see such a prodigy. With a rush they ran to the Cathedral and removed the candles and all that stood before the image. To their disappointment they found that the Virgin’s feet remained mostly hidden beneath the folds of the clothing of the Statue as before.\n\nIn the interim, several scholars and some laymen who were called to see the wonder, arrived on the scene. Seeing that nothing was apparently going to happen, they began cursing all the rest as senseless interpreters of dreams. As they stood not far from the Statue, many of them fell silent as they saw the Statue suddenly move as an entire foot of the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared from beneath the folds of her garment.\n\nTerrified, but convinced, this time they all agreed to announce the peril which they now knew actually threatened them. Quickly rendering their thanks to Mary, they agreed to defend the City and call for reinforcements. They arrived just in time to take up their positions to defend the entrance to the City with the assistance of the Episcopal palace guards.\n\nA tremendous struggle occurred when the invaders broke down the door and entered the courtyard, but the defenders were committed to the fight and held their own. When reinforcements arrived, the invaders fell to the last man.\n\nTo perpetuate the memory and recognize the protection granted to them by the Blessed Virgin Mary, the people of Toul had a shoe of pure silver made to cover the foot on the Blessed Virgin’s Statue. From that time on the Statue was known as Our Lady with the Silver Foot. They also hung on the wall of the cathedral a picture which represented the heavenly vision and Mary was declared Patroness of the City.\n\nThe image of Our Lady with the Silver Foot was venerated in the City and the surrounding areas and in case of the threat of any public calamity, the Blessed Virgin was invoked and ,henceforth, the Statue would be carried in procession throughout the streets of the City. The Governors themselves considered it an honour to take the Statue upon their own shoulders. Pilgrimages were made to Our Lady of the Silver Foot; prayers answered, graces bestowed and miracles wrought.\n\nThe original Statue of Our Lady with the Silver Foot was destroyed during the ravages of the French Revolution and was replaced later by a modern statue that was stolen in the 1980’s. The Gothic Cathedral was repaired after being damaged during the French Revolution but still awaits repair after the damage caused when it was struck during an aerial bombardment in the Second World War. There was once also a Monastery at Toul,but no trace of it remains.\n\nVigil of St Matthew, Apostle and Evangelist\n\nSt Agapitus of Rome\n\nSt Candida of Carthage\n\nSt Dionysius of Phrygia\n\nSt Dorimedonte of Synnada\n\nSt Eusebia of Marseilles\n\nSt Eustachius, Wife and Sons – Martyrs (Died c 188) St Eustachius is one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers – Patronages – against fire, difficult situations, fire prevention, firefighters, hunters, hunting, huntsmen, Madrid, torture victims, trappers.\n\nThe Biography of this family of Martyrs:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.com/2018/09/20/saint-of-the-day-20-september-st-eustachius-wife-and-sons-martyrs-died-c-188/\n\nSt Evilasius of Cyzicum\n\nSt Fausta of Cyzicum\n\nBl Francisco Martín Fernández de Posadas\n\nSt Glycerius of Milan\n\nSt John Charles Cornay\n\nBl John Eustace\n\nSaint Jose Maria de Yermo y Parres (1851–1904) Priest, Founder of the Servants of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and of the Poor.\n\nHis Life:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.com/2019/09/20/saint-of-the-day-20-september-saint-jose-maria-de-yermo-y-parres-1851-1904/\n\nSt Lawrence Mary Joseph Imbert\n\nSt Paul Chong Hasang\n\nSt Priscus\n\nSt Susanna of Eleutheropolis (Died 362) Virgin Martyr\n\nBl Thomas Johnson\n\n—\n\nMartyrs of Korea: St Andrew Kim Taegon, St Paul Chong Hasang & Companions – 103 saints and beati.

Born as Pedro de Arbués in 1442 at Épila in the region of Saragossa, Spain and died on 17 September 1485 in the Cathedral of Saragossa by being attacked and murdered.\n\nThe Roman Martyrology states of him today: “St Pedro of Arbues, first Inquisitor of the faith in the Kingdom of Aragon, who received the Palm of Martyrdom by being barbarously massacred by apostate Jews, for defending courageously, the Catholic faith, according to the duties of his office. He was Canonised by Pope Pius IX in 1867.“\n\nPeter was born to the nobleman Antonio de Arbués and Sancia Ruiz. He studied philosophy perhaps in Huesca but later travelled to Bologna on a scholarship to the Spanish College of Saint Clement which was part of the University of Bologna. n 1473, he obtained his Doctorate in both Canon and Civil Law and he served as a Professor of Moral Philosophical studies or ethics.\n\nUpon his return to Spain he was Ordained and became a member of the Cathedral Chapter of the Canons Regular at La Seo where, in 1474 he made his religious profession.\n\nAbout that time Ferdinand and Isabella had obtained from Sixtus IV a Bull, to establish in their Kingdom, a tribunal for searching out heretics and especially Jews, who after having received Baptism had relapsed openly or secretly into Judaism – these were known as Marranos. In 1483, the famous Thomas Torquemada,, was appointed Grand Inquisitor over Castile and, being acquainted with the learning and virtue of Peter Arbues, in 1484, named him Inquisitor Provincial in the Kingdom of Aragon.\n\nPeter performed the duties with zeal and justice. Although the enemies of the Inquisition accuse him of cruelty, it is certain that not a single sentence of death can be traced to him. The Marranos, however, whom he had punished hated and resolved to do away with him. One night while kneeling in prayer before the Altar of Our Lady in the metropolitan Cathedral where he used to recite the Office with his brother Canons, attacked him and hired assassins inflicted several wounds from which he died on 17 September 1485. He was just 44 years old.\n\nHis remains were entombed in a special Chapel dedicated to him in the Cathedral.\n\nHe was Beatified on 20 April 1664, by Pope Alexander VII and Canonised on 29 June 1867 by Pope Pius IX who said in the document formalising the Canonisation (Maiorem caritatem): “The divine wisdom has arranged, that in these sad days, when Jews help the enemies of the Church with their books and money, this decree of sanctity has been brought to fulfillment.“\n\nIn explanation, it should be noted, that the most powerful families among the converted Jews seem to have been involved in funding the murder.\n\nSaint of the Day – 16 September – Saint Euphemia (c 290-c 305) Virgen Martyr. Her name means “the well-spoken [of].” Patronages – Alba Adriatica, Italy, Rovinj, Croatia. Also known as – Euphemia of Chalcedon.\n\nThe Roman Martyrology states of her today: “At Chalcedon, the birthday of St Euphemia, Virgin and Martyr, under the Emperor Diocletian and the Proconsul Priscus. For faith in Our Lord, she was subjected to tortues, imprisonment, blows, the torment of the wheel, fire, the crushing weight of stones, the teeth of beasts, scourging with rods, the cutting of sharp saws, burning pans, all of which she survived. But when she was again exposed to the beasts in the amphitheatre, praying to Our Lord to receive her spirit, one of the animals, having inflicted a bite on her sacred body, whilst the rest licked her feet, she yielded her unspotted soul to God.”\n\nSt. Euphemia lived on the cusp of the 3rd and 4th centuries. According to tradition, she was the daughter of a senator named Philophronos and his wife Theodosia in Chalcedon, located across the Bosporus from the City of Byzantium (modern-day Istanbul). From her youth she consecrated her virginity to God.\n\nThe governor of Chalcedon, Priscus, had published a decree that all of the inhabitants of the City take part in sacrifices to the deity Ares. Euphemia was discovered, with forty-nine other Christians, hiding in a house and worshipping God, in defiance of the governor’s orders. Because of their refusal to sacrifice, they were tortured for a number of days,and then, all but Euphemia, were sent to the Emperor for trial. Euphemia, the youngest among them, was separated from her companions and subjected to particularly harsh torments, including the wheel, in hopes of breaking her spirit. She was placed in the arena, where lions were sent out to kill her,but they instead licked her wounds. She eventually died of wounds from a wild bear in the arena.\n\nThe Council of Chalcedon, the Fourth Ecumenical Council, took place in the City of Chalcedon in the year 451. It repudiated the Eutychian doctrine of monophysitism and set forth the Chalcedonian Definition, which describes the “full humanity and full divinity” of Jesus Christ, the Second Person of the Holy Trinity.\n\nPresent at the Council were 630 representatives from all the local Christian Churches. The meetings were quite contentious and no decisive consensus could be reached.\n\nAccording to the Synaxarion of Constantinople, a collection of hagiographies,, both parties wrote a confession of their faith and placed them on the breast of Saint Euphemia within her tomb. After three days the tomb was opened and the scroll with the confession of the true faith, was seen in the right hand of St Euphemia, while the scroll of the Monophysites lay at her feet.\n\nWhen the persecution of Diocletian ended, the Christians laid Saint Euphemia’s relics in a golden sarcophagus, placed within a Church that was dedicated to her. Her relics attracted crowds of pilgrims for centuries.\n\nAround the year 620, in the wake of the conquest of Chalcedon by the Persians in the year 617, Saint Euphemia’s relics were transferred to a new Church in Constantinople. There, during the persecutions of the Iconoclasts, her reliquary was said to have been thrown into the sea, from which it was recovered by the ship-owning brothers, Sergios and Sergonos, who belonged to the Church and who gave it to the local Bishop who hid them in a secret crypt. The relics were afterwards taken to the Island of Lemnos and in 796 they were returned to Constantinople. The majority of her relics are still in the Patriarchal Church of St. George, in Istanbul and others are in Rovini, Croatia.\n\nExaltation of the Holy Cross (Feast) This feast was observed in Rome before the end of the seventh century. It commemorates the recovery of the Holy Cross, which had been placed on Mount Calvary by St Helena.\n\nAbout this great Feast:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.wordpress.com/2017/09/14/feast-of-the-exaltation-of-the-holy-crosstriumph-of-the-holy-cross-14-september/\n\nAND by St Augustine:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.com/2020/09/14/feast-of-the-exaltation-of-the-holy-cross-14-september-let-me-not-boast-except-in-the-cross-of-our-lord-jesus-christ/\n\nNossa Senhora de Nazaré / Our Lady of Nazareth, Portugal (1182) -14 September:\n\nThe chronicles of old Portugal report this episode that took place in the year 1182, on the day of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross. Dom Fuas Roupinho, a Knight and vassal of King Afonso Henriques, was out hunting on a foggy day. He was pursuing a deer when it came to an unexpected precipice and fell to its death into the sea below.\n\nThe horse, which was in close pursuit, reared on the very edge of the cliff and it seemed certain that Dom Fuas would follow the deer to his death. Knowing that a little distance to his left was a cave with the Statue of the Virgin of Nazareth, Dom Fuas immediately invoked her protection. He was saved and in thanksgiving he built a small “Chapel of memory” (Ermida da Memória) over the cave in her honour.\n\nAccording to a document found with it, the little Statue of the Virgin had been venerated in Nazareth in the times of early Christianity. When the iconoclast heresy started in Constantinople and the heretics were destroying all the Statues, a Monk called Ciriaco took it to a Monastery in Spain in the proximity of Merida.\n\nIn 714, when the Saracens invaded the Iberian Peninsula, King Rodrigo fled with Friar Germano to the Atlantic coast, bearing the Statue with them. They hid the Statue in a small cave off the coast of the site that was later to become Nazaré, where it remained until it was found by a shepherd in 1179.\n\nAfter Our Lady miraculously saved the life of Dom Fuas, the devotion to Our Lady of Nazareth spread throughout the country and was the source of countless graces for the people. In 1377 King Fernando ordered a large Church to be built near the little Chapel, and the Statue is venerated there now.\n\nSt Aelia Flaccilla\n\nSt Albert of Jerusalem (1149-1215) also known as St Albert of Vercelli – Bishop, Canon Lawyer, Diplomat and Peacemaker and is regarded as a Co-Founder of the Carmelite Order.\n\nBiography:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.com/2018/09/14/saint-of-the-day-14-september-st-albert-of-jerusalem-1149-1214/\n\nSt Caerealis\n\nBl Claude Laplace\n\nSt Cormac of Cashel\n\nSt Crescentian of Carthage\n\nSt Crescentius of Rome\n\nSt Generalis of Carthage\n\nSt Giulia Crostarosa\n\nSt Jean Gabriel Taurin du Fresse\n\nSt Maternus of Cologne (Died c 325) Bishop\n\nSt Peter of Tarentaise O.Cist (1102-1174) Cistercian Monk, Archbishop of Tarentaise from 1141 until his death, Abbot, Apostle of Charity, Miracle-worker.\n\nThere are two men named Saint Peter of Tarentaise who lived one century apart. The man we honour today is the younger Peter, born in France in the early part of the 12th century. The other man with the same name became Pope Innocent the Fifth.\n\nHis Life:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.com/2019/09/14/saint-of-the-day-14-september-saint-peter-of-tarentaise-o-cist-1102-1174/\n\nBl Pedro Bruch Cotacáns\n\nSt Rosula of Carthage\n\nSt Sallustia\n\nSt Victor of Carthage\n\nVictory of the King of France (Philip the Fair), imploring the help of Our Lady of Chartres (1304) – 17 August:\n\nIt was on this day in the year 1304 that “Philip the Fair” gained a signal victory over the Flemish after recommending himself to Our Lady of Chartres.\n\nThe eldest son of King Philip and Isabella of Aragon, he was nicknamed Philip the Fair while yet a Prince for his handsome features. He became King of France at only 17 years of age and married Joan of Navarre in 1284, which enlarged his Kingdom.\n\nIn the year 1302, Philip sent an inadequate army into Flanders to suppress the Flemish, who were making incursions into his realm at will. His army was soundly defeated at the Battle of the Golden Spurs. Philip responded by winning a naval victory over the Flemish at Zierichzee and then met the Flemish army at the Battle of Mons-en-Pevele, also known as Mons-en-Puelle, on 17 August 1304.\n\nThe battle was furious, lasting all day in extreme heat. Eventually the majority of the French army fled the field, leaving Philip alone with only ten Knights fighting desperately to save themselves and their King. Philip’s horse collapsed, having been killed under him and his life was in great danger of being lost. At that moment, while facing death and certain defeat in battle, Philip turned to the Queen of Heaven, Our Lady of Chartres, begging her assistance to save the day and his life.\n\nSuddenly the French Knights, who had been fleeing the field, turned and saw the King’s Royal Standard still stood, and that he, himself, fought like a Knight of great renown amidst a sea of raging enemies. Racing to the scene with their swords and lances, they turned the Flemish and drove them from the field in what became a resounding victory for the King of France. The Battle of the Golden Spurs was well compensated.\n\nIn gratitude for this victory and favour of Our Lady of Chartres, King Philip went at once to do homage to the Virgin Mary at her Cathedral. He took off his own armour and gave it to the Cathedral at the Altar. He also gave to it, in perpetuity, the land and lordship of Barrus, founded a daily Mass forever and left to this Church ,all of the other accoutrements which he had worn on that day of victory. This feast is kept in the Church of Notre Dame, at Paris, on the following day, the 18th and the office is double. This armour is formerly exhibited in the Church ,on the Anniversary of the battle.\n\nSt Amor of Amorbach\n\nSt Anastasius of Terni\n\nSt Beatrice da Silva Meneses OIC (1424-1492) Virgin, Nun, Founder\n\nSt Benedicta of Lorraine\n\nSt Carloman\n\nSt Cecilia of Lorraine\n\nSt Clare of the Cross of Montefalco (c 1269-1308) Augustinian Nun and Abbess, before becoming a nun, St Clare was a member of the Third Order of St Francis (Secular), Mystic, Penitent, Spiritual adviser,\n\nHer Life:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.com/2019/08/17/saint-of-the-day-17-august-saint-clare-of-the-cross-of-montefalco-c-1269-1308/\n\nSt Donatus of Ripacandida\n\nSt Drithelm\n\nSt Elias the Younger\n\nBl Enric Canadell Quintana\n\nBl Eugenio Sanz-Orozco Mortera\n\nSt Pope Eusebius\n\nSt Eusebius of Sicily\n\nSt Hyacinth OP (1185-1257) ) “Apostle of Poland” and “Apostle of the North” also known as “the Polish St Dominic”– Religious Priest of the Order of Preachers, Confessor, Doctor of Law and Divinity, Missionary, Preacher, Miracle Worker, Mystic.\n\nBiography:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.wordpress.com/2017/08/17/saint-of-the-day-17-august-st-hyacinth-o-p-apostle-of-poland-and-apostle-of-the-north/\n\nSt Jacobo Kyushei Gorobioye Tomonaga\n\nSt James the Deacon\n\nSt Jeanne of the Cross Delanoue (1666-1736) Virgin, Sister and Foundress of the Congregation of St Anne de la Providence\n\nAbout St Jeanne:\n\nhttps://anastpaul.com/2018/08/17/saint-of-the-day-17-august-st-jeanne-delanoue-1666-1736/\n\nSt Jeroen of Noordwijk\n\nSt Juliana of Ptolemais\n\nSt Leopoldina Naudet\n\nSt Mamas\n\nBl Marie-Élisabeth Turgeon\n\nSt Michaël Kurobyoie\n\nSt Myron of Cyzicus\n\nSt Nicolò Politi (1117-1167) Basilian Monk and Hermit.
