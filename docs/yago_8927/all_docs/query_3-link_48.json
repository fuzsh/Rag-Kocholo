First of all, I think Wikipedia (English for example) posts things that are stupid en:XHCTMX-TDT for example, and other articles are being deleted. I want to hear opinions for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol%C3%A1s_Atanes, massimiliano foschi, etc... Starting by Nicolás Atanes, I see the article has been deleted MANY times. I don't know him personally, nor I haven't met with him, but he has as relevance as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kikas_(Angolan_footballer), https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Bickelhaupt, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ryan_(Australian_politician) (as random selected). I think Wikipedia in all languages should tolerate more articles like this, not promotional, I mean, to post about encyclopedic people. Atanes is author on Diario16 https://diario16.com/author/nicolas-atanes-santos/, is relevant in Spain: https://www.elmundo.es/madrid/2020/07/29/5f205975fc6c83cb478b4644.html https://www.diariodenavarra.es/noticias/navarra/2021/07/28/el-virus-extendio-navarra-495529-300.html https://www.rtve.es/play/audios/las-mananas-de-rne-con-inigo-alfonso/matematicas-coronavirus-salud-espana/5731358/ https://www.eitb.eus/es/television/programas/navarra-directo/videos/detalle/7004935/video-nicolas-pie-guerra-impulsar-aprendizaje-matematicas/ has been nominated for a local prize https://www.navarratelevision.es/noticia/Z01842D7D-B1D5-1977-50E0EE09CE98E0A5/La-juventud-un-valor-primordial-para-Navarra-Television organized several initiatives https://cadenaser.com/emisora/2021/07/27/radio_pamplona/1627390029_693321.html https://www.cope.es/actualidad/noticias/juegos-matematicos-ocuparan-las-calles-ciudades-espanolas-julio-20210723_1417895 and created a social movement https://www.abc.es/ciencia/abci-virus-matematico-extiende-desde-pamplona-no-deja-crecer-202107292028_noticia.html.

Grüße vom Sänger ♫(Reden)\n\nThis section was archived on a request by: — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nIs it possible that someone from the Wikimedia Foundation makes a presentation about the structure of the Wikimedia Foundation during a session for interested Wikimedians. There are discussions about the increase in costs and income of the Wikimedia Foundation and it is not easy to understand what for departments exist at the Wikimedia Foundation and what the Employees are doing. There was a massive increase regarding the number of employed people in the last years and so a presentation could help. At Wikimedia Germany there was such a presentation about the structure of their organisation through a community forum and this was helpful for me. I also wish a regular update of the Tuning Session documents after the end of a quarter. They were helpful for me to understand what the teams are doing.--Hogü-456 (talk)\n\nThe Community Wishlist Survey 2022 is now open!\n\nThis survey is the process where communities decide what the Community Tech team should work on over the next year. We encourage everyone to submit proposals until the deadline on 23 January, or comment on other proposals to help make them better. The communities will vote on the proposals between 28 January and 11 February.\n\nThe Community Tech team is focused on tools for experienced Wikimedia editors. You can write proposals in any language, and we will translate them for you. Thank you, and we look forward to seeing your proposals! SGrabarczuk (WMF) (talk)\n\nHow many proposals can a user make at the maximum? Haoreima (talk)\n\n@Haoreima: 5 each ref. — xaosflux Talk\n\nHello\n\nWe, the team working on the Community Wishlist Survey, would like to invite you to an online meeting with us. It will take place on 19 January (Wednesday), 18:00 UTC on Zoom, and will last an hour. This external system is not subject to the WMF Privacy Policy. Click here to join.\n\nAgenda\n\nBring drafts of your proposals and talk to to a member of the Community Tech Team about your questions on how to improve the proposal\n\nFormat\n\nThe meeting will not be recorded or streamed. Notes without attribution will be taken and published on Meta-Wiki. The presentation (all points in the agenda except for the questions and answers) will be given in English.\n\nWe can answer questions asked in English, French, Polish, Spanish, and German. If you would like to ask questions in advance, add them on the Community Wishlist Survey talk page or send to sgrabarczuk@wikimedia.org.\n\nNatalia Rodriguez (the Community Tech manager) will be hosting this meeting.\n\nInvitation link\n\nJoin online\n\nMeeting ID: 85804347114\n\nDial by your location\n\nWe hope to see you! SGrabarczuk (WMF) (talk)\n\nLike, over the past few months I’ve had to deal with long, hostile ANI threads, one of which got so heated I was blocked for 24 hours; a bunch of crap about anti-LGBT+ sentiment from non-English users which makes me feel unwelcome and depressed as an LGBT+ person; and some driveby jerk on my Commons talkpage basically telling me my art sucked and was useless to the project (in the politest possible way). I already have depression and anxiety and contributing to the project is extremely important to me. Editing is frequently stressful, especially to marginalized communities and people with mental health issues. I don’t really know where else to go to talk about this, but I feel like there should be somewhere to discuss this to figure out solutions to it. Dronebogus (talk)\n\nI'll try to be careful on this. I get the feeling you are looking for an on wiki place to discuss this. I think that such a on wiki place might be a good idea in theory, but I do not know how to fit it into the current wiki culture. Wiki tends to be very much an open/transparent place, perhaps more accurately \"a place of record\", sometimes to a fault. Combined with its asynchronous communication style it might not lend itself well to such discussions as they cannot easily be private/confidential and thus people can never truly feel free to discuss. However, the Trust and Safety team has collected these resources which might help you. Note that these are a little bit more focused on certain extreme situations which you might feel do not fit your situation. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nYeah, that’s a bit beyond this kind of situation, but thanks anyway. Dronebogus (talk)\n\nAlso here is some person to person (amateur) advice. I'm not trained in this, so please don't put too much value in my comments. Consider consulting a mental health professional instead.\n\nFirst, I think that if editing brings you stress, in my experience it is good to timebox your engagement and to plan some sort of activity for after editing (at 21:00 PM I'm going to stop editing and clean the kitchen/go jogging). Second, be careful of taking on the entire world. Stepping into Wikimedia, but also the Internet in general exposes us to so many people, cultures, interests and problems, it can cause us to feel as if the whole world is burning and it is all personal, while in reality things generally get better compared to say 10 years ago and ppl don't even really know you.\n\nI suspect that contributing is an outlet for you, but it is probably coloured by your anxiety and depression just as much. I'm not comfortable with giving advise on those interactions, and again I come back to consulting a professional. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nThat’s good advice. I did it for the aforementioned situations and it helped.

This approach incorporates community feedback from 2021. Instead of leading with proposals, the Call is framed around key questions from the Board of Trustees. The key questions came from the feedback about the 2021 Board of Trustees election. The intention is to inspire collective conversation and collaborative proposal development about these key questions.\n\nJoin the conversation.\n\nBest,\n\nMovement Strategy and Governance--SOyeyele (WMF) (talk)\n\nPlease note an additional question has now been added. There are also several proposals from participants to review and discuss. --SOyeyele (WMF) (talk)\n\nYou can find this message translated into additional languages on Meta-wiki.\n\nHi All,\n\nThank you to everyone who participated in the Call for Feedback: Board of Trustees elections so far. The Movement Strategy and Governance team suggested another question was still under discussion. As of today, we announce the last key question:\n\nHow should affiliates participate in elections?\n\nAffiliates are an important part of the Wikimedia movement. Two seats of the Board of Trustees due to be filled this year were filled in 2019 through the Affiliate-selected Board seats process. A change in the Bylaws removed the distinction between community and affiliate seats. This leaves the important question: How should affiliates be involved in the selection of new seats?\n\nThe question is broad in the sense that the answers may refer not just to the two seats mentioned, but also to other, Community- and Affiliate-selected seats. The Board is hoping to find an approach that will both engage the affiliates and give them actual agency, and also optimize the outcomes in terms of selecting people with top skills, experience, diversity, and wide community’s support.\n\nThe Board of Trustees is seeking feedback about this question especially, although not solely, from the affiliate community. Everyone is invited to share proposals and join the conversation in the Call for Feedback channels. In addition to collecting online feedback, the Movement Strategy and Governance team will organize several video calls with affiliate members to collect feedback. These calls will be at different times and include Trustees.\n\nDue to the late addition of this third question, the Call will be extended until 16 February.\n\nJoin the conversation.\n\nBest, Movement Strategy and Governance.--SOyeyele (WMF) (talk)\n\nHello. I wanted to give you an update about the Desktop Improvements project, which the Wikimedia Foundation Web team has been working on for the past few years.\n\nThe goals of the project are to make the interface more welcoming and comfortable for readers and useful for advanced users. The project consists of a series of feature improvements which make it easier to read and learn, navigate within the page, search, switch between languages, use article tabs and the user menu, and more.\n\nThe improvements are already visible by default for readers and editors on 24 wikis, including Wikipedias in French, Portuguese, and Persian.\n\nThe changes apply to the Vector skin only. Monobook or Timeless users are not affected.\n\nUser menu - focused on making the navigation more intuitive by visually highlighting the structure of user links and their purpose.\n\nSticky header - focused on allowing access to important functionality (logging in/out, history, talk pages, etc.) without requiring people to scroll to the top of the page.\n\nFor a full list of the features the project includes, please visit our project page. We also invite you to our Updates page.\n\nIt is possible to opt-in individually in the appearance tab within the preferences by unchecking the \"Use Legacy Vector\" box. (It has to be empty.) Also, it is possible to opt-in on all wikis using the global preferences.\n\nIf you think this would be good as a default for all readers and editors of this wiki, feel free to start a conversation with the community and contact me.\n\nOn wikis where the changes are visible by default for all, logged-in users can always opt-out to the Legacy Vector. There is an easily accessible link in the sidebar of the new Vector.\n\nIf you would like to follow the progress of our project, you can subscribe to our newsletter.\n\nYou can read the pages of the project, check our FAQ, write on the project talk page, and join an online meeting with us (27 January (Thursday), 15:00 UTC).\n\nHow to join our online meeting\n\nJoin online\n\nMeeting ID: 89205402895\n\nDial by your location\n\nThank you!!\n\nOn behalf of the Wikimedia Foundation Web team, SGrabarczuk (WMF) (talk)\n\nTwo people (2) started an intervention on all wikipedias globally, under the name Climate change portal/climate denial review . Is permissible to begin that large scale projects without consensus of the community? Who has authority to judge about right and wrong in wikipedias articles other than the community? ΔώραΣτρουμπούκη from Greek wikipedia (talk)\n\n@ΔώραΣτρουμπούκη: The review project has no particular authority over anything, it's just a bunch of volunteers who decided to look over articles in various languages, and put up a page on Meta to help keep their activity organized. The local community maintains authority over the articles to the same extent as before. An informal volunteer effort does not require advance consensus, I think. --Yair rand (talk)\n\n@ΔώραΣτρουμπούκη: Seems within scope, fitting in within \"global community site for the Wikimedia Foundation's projects and related projects, from coordination and documentation to planning and analysis\" and Meta:Inclusion policy. There has never been the need to create a consensus to create a page. If you think that the page is out of scope then please use Meta:Deletion requests. If you think that the page's scope needs altering then please use Talk:Climate change portal/climate denial review. — billinghurst sDrewth\n\nThank you for your answer ΔώραΣτρουμπούκη (talk)\n\nI was about to ask to the local community for consent about the creation of an autowikiborser local policy. I think that the use of the software should be reserved only for enabled users even without the bot flag. Is it possible to remove the possibility of using the autowikibrowser for all non-authorized users? How? If so, who would grant and revoke the permissions?--Gat lombard (talk)\n\n@Gat lombard: we already require AWB registration here on the meta-wiki; we don't really need a \"policy\" for it. Users that need access can request it at Meta:Requests for help from a sysop or bureaucrat. — xaosflux Talk\n\n@Gat lombard: Hi. If you want to restrict who can use AWB on your community you'll need to create two pages in JSON format, one for the configuration, and the second one would be a check page of users allowed to use the tool. Please let me know if you need some help. I can set those up for you if you'd like. Best regards, —MarcoAurelio (talk)\n\n@MarcoAurelio: Thanks, then I'll call you in two weeks when the new policy is approved--Gat lombard (talk)\n\n@MarcoAurelio: The rule is approved, could you implement it on the Lombard wiktionary? --Gat lombard (talk)\n\n@Gat lombard: is this for lmowikt? wikt:lmo:Project:AutoWikiBrowser/CheckPageJSON and wikt:lmo:Project:AutoWikiBrowser/Config are the two pages that need to be created in JSON model. — xaosflux Talk\n\n@Xaosflux: Yes --Gat lombard (talk)\n\nCiao @Gat lombard: I've moved the pages created by @Xaosflux to their final destinations. It should all be done. I'd personally protect them at least to autoconfirmed level so no-one can simply add himself to the page directly and defeat the purpose of the checkpage, but it's up to lmo.wiktionary. Please let me know if we can be of any further assistance. —MarcoAurelio (talk)\n\nThanks @MarcoAurelio: I would limit it to administrators only, as the purpose of this page is to block from possible abuse and the need of the autowikibrowser is limited just to very few users--Gat lombard (talk)\n\nXaosflux I removed your account from those authorized to Autowikibrowser but I left your bot instead according to local policy. In any case, if you want to request it immediately for your account, you can request it. If you are a global administrator you can re-add yourself. Thanks for your work --Gat lombard (talk)\n\nI created shells at wikt:lmo:Utent:Xaosflux/sandbox/Config.json and wikt:lmo:Utent:Xaosflux/sandbox/CheckPageJSON.json that you can just move to the new pages (don't include the .json part of the name on the new page). (I'm not autoconfirmed on that project yet). At first you may want to just watch the pages, and not protect them - that is what some smaller projects do - if you protect them you will need to have your privledged users do any future updates. Feel free to remove my name from the list of course, I just put it in as a palceholder! — xaosflux Talk\n\nThere no Serbo-Croatian language ! Only Croatian laguage.\n\nObjection for https: //hr2. wiki/wiki/Serbo-Croatian\n\nThere is no Serbo-Croatian language.!!!! Only Croatian language.\n\n(a) That site has malware warnings, so I broke the links above, (b) it is not a WMF hosted site, so there is nothing we can do about it here. — xaosflux Talk\n\nHello, everyone.\n\nI'm writing with information about the Ombuds Commission (OC), the small group of volunteers who investigate complaints about violations of the privacy policy, and in particular concerning the use of CheckUser and Oversight tools, on any Wikimedia project for the Board of Trustees.

I propose the creation of a project similar to Climate change portal/climate denial review to work on systematically removing this inappropriate and bigoted content. Dronebogus (talk)\n\nI think there are different point of views to the topic and after my understanding it is allowed that people say what they mean as long as it is not unfriedly and it hurts other people. After my understanding a encyclopedia article should offer a neutral persceptive and tell what different sources write about the topic. If a user has a infobox with a message about the own view to LGBT+ on the user page this is from my point of view not a problem. Maybe you can try to start such a project by talking to other members of the LGBT+ User Group. I am interested in understanding better what reasons are there that lead to anti-LGBT+ rhetoric.--Hogü-456 (talk)\n\n@Hogü-456: Someone stating they view LGBT+ people as in some way “less than” heterosexual cisgender people is inherently unfriendly and hurtful, but in any case I’m more concerned about non-English articles potentially featuring inaccurate or biased negative coverage of LGBT+M particularly in regions with strong anti-LGBT sentiment like Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Dronebogus (talk)\n\nhow a person may live their private life is their choice & of no concern to me. when i come to work i am focused on the job that's all that matters. at the end of the day i go home, shut the door or watch a movie on T.V. for more information on the business of human secrets & privacy see: electronic privacy information center EPIC. in the end we are all partners working for the same company. i have found that gossip is a waste of time which is unrelated to work. Davidche123 (talk)\n\nOppose. Everyone is allowed to their own views as long as it doesn't affect the edits. Żyrafał (talk)\n\nY Such a coordinating initiative I think could be helpful in dealing with this problem.The fact that homophobia is a problem and is unacceptable in any project is due to Universal_Code_of_Conduct#3.1_–_Harassment . Everyone is allowed to have their own views, beliefs etc. but they must not express them in a way that constitutes harassment, using insults, stereotypes or attacks based on personal characteristic \"like intelligence, appearance, ethnicity, race, religion (or lack thereof), culture, caste, sexual orientation, gender, sex, disability, age, nationality, political affiliation, or other characteristics.\" Grudzio240 (talk)\n\nOppose The climate denial case is about whether or not there is a global warming. This case can be proved scientifically with a high degree of certainity. However, the legal system is not a science like physics and we cannot prove gay marriages should be equal to hetero ones. This is a philosophical issue. And it may turn out that there is no right answer.\n\nNot always is there a right or wrong world view. It may just be different than others'. The world view of a user should be their private matter. And they should be able to write on any topic they want or on no topic at all (equality - otherwise it's going to be like censorship). Where is the borderline between accepted and unaccepted behavior? Is \"I'm against selling alcohol to minors\" okay? Or \"I'm against advertising drugs\"? Wikimedia community is a global one. This means that users may come from a completely different places where there are different traditions and world views common. And it's impossible to guarantee that our opinions will not clash. They will but we don't have to remember about it when talking to others.\n\nLet's take the marriage: in the Western culture these are pairs of two people and adding anyone more is usually considered cheating (at least traditionally). On the other hand, there are cultures like Arabic where it's perfectly okay to have two or more wifes. Everyone of us have certain opinions. They do not have to be universally nice. I can be against my girlfriend sleeping with one more 'best friend' but that doesn't mean I won't talk to a person who is willing to live in such a complex relation.\n\nThis particular user states he is against gay marriage. This doesn't mean he believes LGBT+ people are worse than others (maybe he does so, but that's not written there). Marriage is an construct of a civil law and not a treat of Wikimedia user. Moreover, this case is very boolean: you can be for or against LGBT marriages (not diving into reasons here, but there are certainly for both options). If you are forbidden to say \"i'm against\" but you may say \"i'm for\" (hey, inclusivity), that's censorship.\n\nSuppose I wrote \"Eating meat should be forbidden\". I do not disapprove of people who eat meat but I do say that they should not do so. Is this considered to be vegetarian terrorism and against inclusivity of meat-eaters?\n\nWe should not hurt people by saying something but also we cannot hurt people by preventing them to be themselves.
