        "text": "Under construction\n\n(sources: mainly Wikipedia)\n\nIn this section of our filmography you will find various works arranged in alphabetical order, which can promote holistic & multidimensional awareness, expanded and shamanic states of consciousness, parallel universes, Gnostic themes, spiritual guidance, shadow-work, and other insights related to astroshamanism. This does not necessarily mean that all listed works are of good quality or are endorsed by this website.\n\nThese works provide a large variety of direct or indirect messages, which include the following: “the objective physical world we believe to live in is a bogus, illusive, simulated or separated reality”; “time, death and the conflict between polarities, or good and evil, are deceptive and virtual features of this separated reality, and do not truly exist”; “everything and everyone is part of the same whole”; “our true nature is multidimensional”; “you are the creator of your reality”, “we simultaneously exist in infinite universes”; “you are whole only when you embrace your shadow”.\n\nThe term multidimensional (from Latin multus – many, and dimensio, from dimetri – to measure out) describes the presence of several dimensions or aspects of reality. In ordinary language the term dimension usually refers to the measurements that define the shape and size of a physical object.\n\nFor the main page of our filmography containing the general index of themes please click here.\n\nMovies or TV series in blu are particularly recommended.\n\nList of movies and TV series with Multidimensional & Holistic Awareness elements:\n\nThe Adventures of Baron Munchausen, 1988, adventure fantasy film co-written and directed by Terry Gilliam, based on the tall tales about the 18th-century German nobleman Baron Munchausen (2.4Np) and his wartime exploits against the Ottoman Empire. **\n\nA for Andromeda, 1961, British television science fiction drama serial first made and broadcast by the BBC, written by cosmologist Fred Hoyle (4.8), with John Elliot, starring Julie Christie (1.8.4, PlutoInstr.), about a group of scientists who detect a radio signal from another galaxy that contains instructions for the design of an advanced computer.
