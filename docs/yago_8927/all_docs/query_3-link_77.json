        "text": "Discussion\n\nIn this study, most health workers felt that they and their families were at increased risk of infection and increased stress at work. Some health workers feel a certain degree of pressure on the epidemic and 8% of health workers have the idea of quitting. However, health workers are trying to overcome this difficulty, since the 2019-nCoV outbreak, countless health workers have voluntarily signed up to the front line of the fight against the epidemic to treat infected patients at the risk of being infected themselves. As of 8 March 2020, 42 600 health workers in China have gone to Hubei and Wuhan to provide medical assistance, including 19 000 intensive care health workers [‘http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/s3574/202003/a54a40ae28764f3581f36cc31204433c.shtml’, 08 March 2020]. This reflects the great cohesion and unity of the Chinese medical team. A total of 76.0% of health workers believe that they can recover effectively if they are infected. This shows that medical staff have a more correct and objective understanding of 2019-nCoV, and are not afraid of the disease. Secondly, our study found that only 46.8% of health workers thought they were protected effectively. It is reported that more than 2000 medical workers have been infected while caring for 2019-nCoV infected patients [‘http://www.nhc.gov.cn/wjw/mtbd/202003/3a5385c25255461cae9467060bfef27b.shtml’, 12 March 2020]. This reflects that the healthcare facilities still need to strengthen the supply of medical protection resources, ensure an adequate supply of masks, goggles and protective clothing, and increase protection training for medical workers at the same time.\n\nThe IES score represents the severity of the subjects' response to stressful events. The higher the IES score, the stronger the individual response to the event [Reference Hosey12, Reference Hyland, Brewin and Maercker13]. In this study, the average score of IES was 15.26 (s.d. = 11.23), and the median was 13.5 (IQR 7.0, 21.0), which was at a mild level. This score is less than the 34.8 (s.d. = 19.7) score of Chong et al. [Reference Chong7] on the IES survey of Chinese medical workers during the SARS outbreak in 2003. The result was also significantly lower than Lee's score of 24.32 for medical workers during the MERS epidemic [Reference Lee9]. However, the IES score increased with age. Health workers ⩾56 years old had the highest IES score of 29.0 (IQR 16.5, 32.5), which was in the middle level. This may be related to the post-traumatic stress disorder caused by health workers ⩾56 years old when they experienced SARS in 2003 [Reference Jiang14–Reference Chan and Huak18]. This suggests that the hospital can provide psychological counselling and support to health workers whose age is ⩾56 years old. For the health workers who have been quarantined are in the clinical front line of direct contact with infected patients, although their IES scores are relatively high, they are still at a mild level. Policy makers should pay more attention to the quarantined medical workers [Reference Liu19]. The high arousal score reflects the degree of emotional response and anxiety level of the subjects corresponding to stressful events. In this study, the average score of high arousal dimension was 5.15 (s.d. = 4.71), and the median score was 4.0 (IQR 2.0, 7.0). The results of this study show that the overall impact of the 2019-nCoV outbreak on health workers is at a mild level. The review of the literature above shows that the IES scores of health workers in this study are lower than those in SARS and MERS outbreaks. This reflects that Chinese health workers have good psychological coping ability in the face of public health emergencies. The reasons may include two points. First, it has been 17 years since the outbreak of SARS in 2003. In these 17 years, China's medical level and ability to deal with public health emergencies have been greatly improved. Secondly, 2019-nCoV and SARS both belong to coronavirus, and the outbreak time, source of infection, infectivity and CT images are similar to SARS to a certain extent [Reference Chen, Liu and Guo20–Reference Wan23]. Only 6% of the subjects in this study experienced the SARS epidemic in 2003. However, during the 2019-nCoV outbreak, a considerable number of medical team leaders and decision-makers experienced the SARS epidemic in 2003, which has reliable reference value for scientific, effective and rapid control of the 2019-nCoV epidemic. However, the above explanations are only the authors' personal point of view, and the specific reasons still need more in-depth study in the future.\n\nThrough regression analysis, our study observed that compared with the unquarantined health workers, the quarantined health workers had higher scores of avoidance dimension, high arousal and IES. First, quarantined medical workers are required to be quarantined for 14 days. During the quarantine period, they are unable to go out or communicate face-to-face with people. They can only be alone and emotionally lonely. Next, quarantined health workers will continue to get information about the epidemic from the Internet, television and other channels, but they are unable to help patients directly. In the face of the high level of psychological stress of the quarantined health workers, managers should pay attention to this part of the population and carry out online psychological counselling and counselling. However, for the health workers who are in contact with diagnosed or suspected patients with 2019-nCoV, their high arousal score and total IES score have not increased significantly, which may be related to the fact that this part of the population devotes all their energies to the treatment of patients and obtains a certain degree of professional satisfaction at work.\n\nIn this study, psychological measurements were carried out on medical workers during the outbreak of 2019-nCoV. Therefore, it can reflect the immediate psychological state of medical workers more truly and objectively. Secondly, this study discusses the influencing factors of the psychological state of medical workers, which can provide targeted psychological intervention to specific groups of people. However, this study also has some limitations. Firstly, due to the busy work of the medical workers who fight directly in the clinical front line, there are fewer subjects who can be directly contacted with diagnosed patients in this study. Secondly, this study uses electronic questionnaire to collect data, all the contents are self-report of the subjects and this is a convenient sample, there may be a certain degree of deviation. Thirdly, the psychological state of health workers in this study is only the current temporary state. If the subjects had a certain degree of anxiety, depression or job burnout, it may have a certain impact on the results of this study. Finally, this study is a cross-sectional study, the long-term mental state has not been followed up."
