        "text": "Fusion will be one of the greatest breakthroughs of this century. As a source of clean, abundant and safe energy, fusion will complement renewables, providing reliable base-load electricity and heat. Proxima Fusion is working to deliver fusion power plants via optimized stellarators, devices that form magnetic cages for high-energy matter.\n\nProxima is the first-ever spin-out company from the Max Planck Society Institute for Plasma Physics, which built and operates the most advanced stellarator on the planet, W7-X. Research over the past decade has now set the stage for Proxima to leverage modern optimization tools and design capabilities to reach economically viable fusion energy. With W7-X reaching high-performance in continuous operation, uniquely among fusion concepts, Proxima Fusion is catalyzing the creation of a new fusion ecosystem in Germany.\n\nConnecting partners from industry and academia, the Proxima Fusion founding team, coming together from the Max Planck Society, MIT and Google, is now entering the race for fusion energy to turn stellarators into economically viable fusion power plants.\n\nThis website is the gateway to investment pooling for Proxima Fusion (invitation-only by the founders).\n\nThis document is non-binding preliminary information that provides an initial impression of the financing options offered.
