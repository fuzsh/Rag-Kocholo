A man goes into a parallel dimension, a limbo between reality and fantasy where the normal rules of time and space have ceased to apply.[1] His wife goes to rescue him.[2] Both will be trapped in a strange and cruel world where a ruthless Queen organizes reality as a mad game of chess, a post-apocalyptic dystopia of domination and subjugation where characters can’t eat, speak or move about freely and are periodically viciously attacked.[3]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nMaximum Shame is the third feature movie by Carlos Atanes. It can be framed as the previous ones—FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions and Proxima—within the fantasy genre. Produced completely independently, like all its author's films, it was supposedly inspired by pornographic 70's films. Thereby recovering the underground, transgressive and weird style that characterized Atanes' early work.[4] Shooting, in English, was developed in Spain over just six days, but one scene was made in the UK with British scream queen Eleanor James.[5] The film was a failure upon release.\n\nCast and roles include\n\n[edit]\n\nAna Mayo\n\nMarina Gatell\n\nIgnasi Vidal\n\nPaco Moreno\n\nAriadna Ferrer\n\nDavid Castro\n\nEleanor James\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nBUT Film Festival 2010: nominated for BEST FEATURE MOVIE, Breda, Netherlands.[6]\n\nNominated for WEIRDEST PICTURE of 2011 (Weirdcademy Awards)[7]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]"
