        "text": "Given the poster, I'm expecting a lot of people came to this film expecting something disturbing, something gross and beyond the pale, kink.com for the horror crowd. In reality, it's actually a whimsical, joyful unrestrained descent into, well, I'm not quite sure. Musical fetish theatre?\n\nThe film is a take on the classic Alice in Wonderland tale, borrowing names and trappings, and perhaps even the tone, but not the plot. The plot is so simple you could fit the whole thing into a single sentence but complicated enough to annoy anyone attempting to make sense of it. It's all shot remarkably cheaply and looks exceedingly rough throughout, but it's not without its charm, and the director certainly has an eye…\n\ndo you know how bad a fetish movie has to be for me to not like it? 0 sex vibes, absent of anything even remotely enjoyable because it does not understand what a fetish is or why someone would enjoy it, le internet medley but a fetish musical. 1 star for having a few gross and disturbing moments that were kinda entertaining from a horror angle. Watching Beau Travail and then this was a terrible choice\n\nThe script: \"fuck it, we ball.\"\n\nRare I randomly stumble upon anything this original and fascinating on Tubi. Usually I'll put something on their as background noise, but it was becoming clear I couldn't look away. Judging by the horrid ratings, this might be my biggest ask yet to listen to me.\n\nHas my favourite method of dialogue were it's so emotionally passionate, but can barely be passed as english. It's own, metaphorical language that experiments with the english language itself, not really caring if it works or not.\n\nPoint of it, at least to my understanding, is the absence of sexual excitement through the kink underground from a more conservative view. The erotic wonderland is a shitty warehouse they…\n\nEternal Scavenger Hunt Film 240: An Unusual Musical\n\nHonestly, I put this on in the background while I was looking for something else to watch, and then I just sort of... watched the whole thing. I can't help but like it, because it's so weird and the actors are SO dedicated to their roles. I am in no way recommending this movie to anyone; on top of being a fetish sci fi musical, it's also incredibly pretentious and they keep talking about chess, which does nothing for me and, I would assume, for many other people. But I personally, me, myself, I like this, and I enjoyed it, and, yes, I might watch it again because in case you haven't noticed i'm weird i'm a weirdo i don't fit in, and i don't want to fit in have you ever seen me without this stupid hat on that's weird etc etc\n\nIt Came From...whatever the fuck this was unearthed from#267\n\nI.. *tries to think of something to say, opens mouth but stops*\n\nAfter seeing this turn out to be a musical, a fetish movie where one of the scenes is a woman orgasming while getting her feet clean, and seeing the Oracle eating spaghetti and moaning. I've brought Maximum Shame to my family for coming across this, seeing this and want to forget about it for the rest of my miserable life."
