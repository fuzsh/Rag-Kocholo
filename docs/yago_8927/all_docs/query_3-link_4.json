        "text": "I feel like the startup scene is kinda losing its mojo, and not only because of higher interest rates I mean - startups have always been the rockstars of the business world, these gigs get all the spotlight thanks to GAFA's success stories (And Zuckerberg who’s trying hard to look cool) Funny thing is, you've got all these small businesses calling themselves \"startups\" just to sound cool. They're out here trying to lure in young job seekers with nothing but a ping pong table in the office and some free snacks. Here in Hong Kong - the world's most expensive city. If you join a startup, expect a lack of work-life balance. However, we do have some great local success stories like Gogovan, Welab, or Klook. But let's get real for a sec - trying to bootstrap an online business here is freaking hard without an incubator like Cyberport backing you up with cash and network And I feel like it's getting harder to find a powerful business idea because the online space is just saturated with giant companies and copycats. I mean, a real startup is supposed to have this massive growth potential because it's solving a big, global need. Think socializing (Meta), buying stuff online (Amazon), getting around (Uber), searching online (Google), and finding a date (Tinder). But most of those big needs are already locked down by trillion-dollar companies who will buy you out fast. So finding a sizeable audience to grow exponentially has become hard. Some startups are trying to niche down (like all these Tinder copycats) but fail to generate enough cash because they can't reach enough people. (Even Tinder or Bumble are suffering now) Then there's this whole solopreneur thing that blew up during the pandemic. We fast-forwarded like 10 years in tech, and now one motivated person can set up an online business and rake in cash with a correct budget and without full-time employees. Most of the tools and platforms you need? They're free. Setting up a website? Child's play these days. After that, it's all about finding your groove - the right tools and the perfect sales funnel to start generating cash It's not a walk in the park and might take a few years, but the good news is that it's definitely possible without burning yourself out. That's the rise of the solopreneur - could be a helper selling Taobao clothes on Carrousel to get extra HKD or this guy writing a newsletter for his website design business Peace PS: Next newsletter guest is an amazing woman who created an online business to help you store your clothes, the interview will be out Thursday: https://lnkd.in/gBMcMPXg #hongkong #startup #wix\n\nActually, only about 30% of my clients come to me for a new website. Most of them already have a platform, but they face one of these 3 issues: Problem 1: The website is a total mess and can't be easily modified because of too much coding, a dead interface, being hacked, or the web designer disappearing somewhere in Thailand (usually on a beach in Phuket) Problem 2: Monthly maintenance isn't being done by anyone, and the management team doesn't want to waste time on this (even the trainee doesn't care) Problem 3: The website's design has become old because no changes have been made since Titanic was released (The Craigslist or Wikipedia vibe from the 90s). And worse is many companies don't freaking care about their website because it's not part of their sales strategy. They find clients mostly with referrals (Hong Kong is a small market) and just use a website to show their vibe and services. (The CEO: \"Everybody has a website, we need that too!\") That's where I come in. I offer 3 solutions while being way more affordable than local agencies (who usually don't care about these time-consuming and cheap projects): Solution 1: I rebuild the website on Wix Studio in about three weeks and provide training to the team so they can manage everything (around 18,000 HKD for building the website). Solution 2: I take over monthly maintenance and make any modifications within 24 hours (Around 1,500 HKD, just drop a voice message on WhatsApp with instructions). Solution 3: I update the website's design to make it modern and fresh (Photoshop/Illustrator/Canvas are the MVPs). Look, I suspect WordPress was the go-to place for the first 20 years of this century, that’s why so many websites are a mess now Peace PS: I built my own website portfolio on Wix Studio, to give you an idea: https://www.baohk.com/ #hongkong #website #wix\n\nSo I’ve been ranting a lot about X because the app became a shit hole for fake news and conspiracists. But fear not, old Twitter can be brought back to life, I found a simple way But first, long story short: In 2023, I turned to Threads, Meta’s Twitter, after Musk’s ugly takeover Problem is, the content there is more about light topics than the serious stuff I want to read about in 300 characters: tech, breaking news, geopolitics, entrepreneur advice…Whatever sparks my brain Instead, Thread is filled with dating advises and meaningless stuff posted by the Insta crowd because interesting creators never left X for the Meta's copycat So I also didn’t give up on X and spent some time cleaning up my account, you know, trying to bring back that old Twitter vibe, my findings: - X has made the \"For You\" tab the default when you open the app. This tab is filled with trending content based on what you like. Problem is, this content is usually controversial and often boosted by bots and people with stupid extreme beliefs. You can't remove this default function in the settings - The best content is in the other tab, \"Following,\" where you have the people you've followed. So it's all about following interesting people and throwing away any conspiracist, Musk’s aficionado or flat earth believer. - Best is to find 5-10 top notch creators and follow the people they talk with. So before you ask, those are my TOP 5 X folks, if you're into tech, entrepreneurship, and content creation: @Peter Level: A digital nomad who created online businesses like Nomadlist and share all his revenus online, I love this guy @Trung Phan: The ultimate X shitposter - his tweets are interesting and funny, and he's always on top of the latest meme or trend. My model. @Alex Lieberman: the co-founder of Morning Brew, this mega successful newsletter. Alex drops a lot of tips to build your own newsletter @Naval: Twitter’s MVP, if you haven’t read his book the Almanach — based on his tweets — just get it, it’s a true business lesson @Nikita Bier: the founder of Gas, a social networking app with 10 million downloads that was acquired by Discord. You can book a 15min video call with him for 2500 USD (That’s the cheapest) Plus bonus: SpaceX for live rocket launches, Tom Grundy for HK news, Watcher Guru for crypto news, and Codie Sanchez for business lessons So remember, select the right tab when you open X and follow the right people. Unfollow the garbage content, and you'll get your old Twitter back. I'm still following Elon Musk - he's slowly becoming an ass, but his tweets still make headlines and some are funny (Shoutout to his fight with Nicolás Maduro 2 weeks ago) Peace Ps: Spoiler alert -- My next interview guest is in the picture below (Hint: That's a woman) #twitter #hongkong #entrepreneur\n\nYou know what I love about Hong Kong? People are always cooking up new schemes and side hustles to earn some extra bucks. You've got the Daigou bringing luxury stuff from China 'cause it's cheaper than HK (But seems like that trend is fading out), and helpers doing part-time cleaning gigs on Sundays. But get this - there's this new grassroots gig in town. I call it the SmartPlay hack. So, last November, the government rolled out this new system for booking sports facilities - the SmartPlay system. You've got an app, you book on it, show up, scan your HKID, and boom - you're in. Simple. But some clever folks saw an opportunity. Coaches started using middlemen to book on the app for them, others people just book and resell facilities, like scalpers. It's like a whole new hustle was born overnight due to the new Smartplay system It's crazy for tennis especially. I heard about it from a helper who got offered 100 HKD commission per tennis court booking. But here's the kicker - 3 helpers got busted last month for this. (I’ll drop the article in the comments if you wanna check it out.) Getting a tennis court is like winning the lottery. You gotta be on your app 7 days before at 7 am sharp, and even then it's tough — Usually you end up in a 11.000 people online queue, But these tennis coaches, charging up to 900 HKD an hour, they're willing to pay others to book for them. Why now? Well, before, the staff would check if your face matched the HKID. But the SmartPlay device doesn't do that. So now you can book under your name and just lend your HKID to let your clients check in. Bit messy and risky (Especially for your HKID), but seems like the money's worth the risk for some folks. Funny thing is, since last month, the SmartPlay devices at Victoria Park and CWB sports grounds were turned off and staff is doing the check-ins First thing they do now is to check if your face matches your HKID. I'm guessing it might be related to all this drama... Peace PS: Next newsletter will be dropped tomorrow afternoon, some good content coming to your mailbox! https://lnkd.in/gBMcMPXg #hongkong #entepreneur #uselessinformation\n\nPilots have this thing called the 1 in 60 rule in aviation. One degree off course? After 60 miles, you're a whole mile away from where you wanted to be. Same with websites. You might think, \"They're all the same: Wix, Wordpress, Shopify...I just need to show my stuff and sell.\" But that tiny choice can send you way off target before you know it. This often happens when folks choose WordPress instead of a user-friendly platform like Wix, especially when all they need is a simple site to inform leads about their products or services (No e-commerce) A huge pain in the neck: - Parts of the site might be coded, leaving you clueless on how to make changes - Your web guy might ghost you or take forever to update a simple picture - Bugs start piling up (like a broken contact form - a real pain for lead gen) - Your site gets knocked offline by a security breach (even a basic DDoS attack can do it) - Plugins go kaput because nobody updated them - Your dev cheaped out on hosting, leaving your site vulnerable to infections Worst part? One of these slip-ups is enough to totally wreck your mood and freeze your online presence Before you know it, your website's turning into this massive energy suck, constantly bugging you and stressing you out Look, if you're stuck on which platform to pick for your gig, just shoot me a DM. Let me know what your business is about and I'll point you in the right direction - No strings attached it's free (I must do 3 good deeds per week) Peace #hongkong #website #wix PS: Spotted on Xiaohongshu, an original potato salad\n\nThis Asia's 50 Best Bars 2024 edition got me thinking - it's amazing how marketing can take something as ordinary as a bar and turn it into a fancy hotspot I mean a cocktail is a simple mix of alcohol with different ingredients but most of them are sold freaking pricy, how come? Well simple answer, it’s financially impossible to sell a cocktail for cheap when you’ve a massive rent to pay and staff wages And let's face it, most of these bars are located in Hong Kong’s pricey areas, like Central and Sheung Wan, where rents are sky-high So the only way to reach the end is to create a massive branding around your bar, here is my marketing playbook: - Use the rarest ingredient to bring the price up (The Regent Hong Kong hotel is selling a Sazerac cocktail made with a 1969’s cognac for an eye-watering US$230) - Transform the cocktail creation into a visual performance: Imagine bartenders with intricate tattoos theatrically tossing and twirling cocktail shakers, à la Tom Cruise in \"Cocktail\" - Design your bar with a refined Prohibition-era aesthetic. Incorporate rich, dark wood paneling and low lighting to evoke a sense of luxury and mystery And don’t forget to add the infamous 10% service charges on top! So in this context, the Top 50 Best Bars is a great idea, a massive PR campaign more than a true guide in itself to promote the speakeasy bars around And I've got to hand it to them - the local F&B scene needs all the love it can get these days… PS: My favourite beer spot in Hong Kong remain the rooftop bar Cadillac in Causeway Bay, they have a crazy great Happy Hour, I dropped a pic of the drink menu in the comment section #hongkong #business #getdrunkforcheap\n\nMy third Reels interview is now live, featuring Byron who runs an accounting firm here in Hong Kong I see too many entrepreneurs having a basic sales funnel - they just send people from social media to their website. But that's not enough to generate a decent business in 2024 You need at least one extra checkpoint with social media in your sales funnel, like a newsletter, podcast, Youtube channel or free webinar... That's why I've added the Reels to the beginning of my sales funnel: Some among the Insta crowd are going to subscribe to my newsletter and think about me when they need a new website later on And the newsletter format is great because you can capture email addresses and keep leads engaged Think of your content creation as a planet: You want leads to gravitate around it for as long as possible until they're ready to buy your stuff Here's how my leads funnel works now: Step 1: People see my Linkedln content, Instagram reels, thread posts, and follow me Step 2: They subscribe to my free newsletter Better Read Paul Step 3: They check out the website of BAO Inc. Step 4: They fill my Typeform in a minute and get an automated quotation The results are encouraging for the Reels, but not perfect... It's still more effective for me to spend 30 minutes on a Linkedin post and I need a video assistant (= extra cost) Plus subscribers coming from Instagram are low, only about 10 subs per month But I think the results will be exponential if I do 10-15 extra video interviews and cover my Insta grid Peace #hongkong #entrepreneur #china\n\nIf I had a HK dollar for every time someone asked me about the 'best' platform to build a website, I'd be living in a penthouse sipping Coronas by the pool. So if you're scratching your head trying to figure out which platform to choose, let me recap: Wordpress: That's for mega websites that require coding and customisation, like media sites with a freemium model, different memberships, and a payment system (Think TechCrunch or Times magazine’s platforms). Those are expensive to build and maintain. A premium plan will set you back around 63 HKD per month to host and modify your website (Plus a big budget to build it with a developer, you’ll depend on them for regular maintenance). You can also create a simple website but the design/user interface don’t match Wix or Shopify. (Wordpress is a nightmare..) Shopify: This is better suited for any small or medium company who wanna deploy something quick without a crazy design. You're planning do some drop shipping between some Chinese factories and international clients, Shopify is perfect for that. If you are in an industry that care about brand image and sell online (fashion, luxury..) better skip and go with Wix. The basic package on Shopify costs around 200 HKD per month, plus a commission on sales. Most of the time, you can do the maintenance yourself (But if you’ve thousands of references to update, better ask your intern) Wix Studio: The perfect solution for local businesses who want a website with a strong brand image to explain their services. You just need to be good with Photoshop and Illustrator for the design part. Same if you need an e-commerce function. For instance you’re selling pastries and cakes to HK people (Like the website I made for Les délices de Patience) or luxury packaging to local companies like Purawise Packaging (Another website I made) A basic package costs around 120 HKD per month, while a Wix e-commerce site will set you back around 160 HKD per month (Plus commission) So let’s recap, if you need to build a simple brand image platform: - You better go with Wix Studio if your budget is limited, since coding isn’t mandatory, the project can be deployed in 2 months maximum and you can do your own maintenance to save on cost If you need an e-commerce website: - Brand image isn’t a priority for you (No need for crazy design/animation/pictures) and you target an international audience with a lot of references, better use Shopify - If you want a great design and brand image is important (luxury industry, fashion, jewellery..), you better go with an e-commerce website built on WIX Just forget about Wordpress and Webflow, you are going to destroy your budget and you’ll be dependant for maintenance (If your developer doesn’t disappear). Building a website isn’t rocket science, you just need clear information PS: If you need help with your website, you just answer these 3 questions to receive a quote: https://lnkd.in/ecaSs4BC #hongkong #website"
