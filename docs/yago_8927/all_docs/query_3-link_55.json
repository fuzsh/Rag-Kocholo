Patients who do not benefit may go on to receive high-dose AZT and valganciclovir as well.\n\nTreatment of unicentric and multicentric Castleman disease and the role of radiotherapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nChronowski, G M; Ha, C S; Wilder, R B; Cabanillas, F; Manning, J; Cox, J D\n\n2001-08-01\n\nAlthough surgery is considered standard therapy for unicentric Castleman disease, favorable responses to radiotherapy also have been documented. The authors undertook this study to analyze the clinical factors, treatment approaches, and outcomes of patients with unicentric or multicentric Castleman disease, and to report the outcomes of patients with unicentric Castleman disease treated with radiotherapy. The authors reviewed the medical records of 22 patients who had received a histologic diagnosis of Castleman disease at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1988 and 1999. One patient with a concurrent histopathologic diagnosis of nonsecretory multiple myeloma was excluded from the study. In all patients, the diagnosis of Castleman disease was based on the results of lymph node biopsies. Disease was categorized as being either unicentric or multicentric and further subdivided into hyaline vascular, plasma cell, or mixed variant histologic types. Clinical variables and outcomes were analyzed according to treatment, which consisted of surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy. Records from 21 patients were analyzed: 12 had unicentric disease, and 9 had multicentric disease. The mean follow-up time for the entire series was 51 months (median, 40 months). Four patients with unicentric disease were treated with radiotherapy alone: 2 remain alive and symptom free, 2 died of causes unrelated to Castleman disease and had no evidence of disease at last follow-up. Eight patients with unicentric disease were treated with complete or partial surgical resection, and all are alive and asymptomatic. All nine patients with multicentric disease were treated with combination chemotherapy: five are alive with no evidence of disease, and four are alive with progressive disease. Surgery results in excellent rates of cure in patients with unicentric Castleman disease; radiotherapy can also achieve clinical response and cure in selected patients.

A physical exam showed tachypnea, generalized cutaneous hyperpigmentation and skin hardening of extremities, muscle weakness, hypoesthesia and hyporeflexia. Laboratory showed hyperprolactinemia, low testosterone, hypothyroidism and Addison's disease. Electrophoresis of proteins showed polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Somatosensory evoked potentials reported peripheral neuropathy and severe axonal polyneuropathy by electromyography. Chest X-rays showed bilateral reticular infiltrates and mediastinal widening. An echocardiogram displayed moderate pulmonary hypertension. Skin biopsy had no evidence of scleroderma. CT reported axillar, mediastinal and retroperitoneal nodes. The mediastinal lesion biopsy reported hyaline vascular Castleman's disease, multicentric variety.

The fundamental pathogenetic mechanism involves dysregulated cytokine activity, which causes systemic inflammatory symptoms as well as lymphadenopathy. The histological changes in lymph nodes resemble in part the findings originally described in the unicentric forms Castleman disease, both hyaline vascular and plasma cell variants. In MCD caused by Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus/human herpesvirus-8 (KSHV/HHV8), the cytokine over activity is caused by viral products, which can also lead to atypical lymphoproliferations and potential progression to lymphoma. In cases negative for KSHV/HHV8, so-called idiopathic MCD, the hypercytokinemia can result from various mechanisms, which ultimately lead to different constellations of clinical presentations and varied pathology in lymphoid tissues. In this article, we review the evolving concepts and definitions of the various conditions under the eponym of Castleman disease, and summarize current knowledge regarding the histopathology and pathogenesis of lesions within the MCD spectrum.

Tocilizumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks. In each case, tocilizumab alleviated symptoms, including generalized fatigue, pyrexia, and alleviated biochemical abnormalities, including anemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, and increased C-reactive protein (CRP). Side effects included hypercholesterolemia, acute pyelonephritis, mild inflammation of the parotid glands, and upper respiratory system inflammation. Other severe side effects were not observed. These results indicate that tocilizumab is effective for the treatment of MCD. This is the first report on tocilizumab efficacy for Castleman's disease after approval for use for Castleman's disease.\n\nEBV+ HHV-8+ Multicentric Castleman Disease With Plasmablastic Aggregates in an HIV+ Man: An Evolving Clinicopathologic Entity.\n\nPubMed\n\nShivane, Aditya; Pearce, Amy; Khatib, Nadia; Smith, Mark E F\n\n2018-06-01\n\nWe report a case of EBV+ and HHV-8+ multicentric Castleman disease with plasmablastic aggregates in an HIV-positive individual. A 41-year-old man presented in early 2015 with fevers, sweats, weight loss, intractable itching, and on subsequent testing was found to be HIV positive. Investigations showed cervical lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. He was treated for HIV and his symptoms resolved. His symptoms recurred in January 2016, and a provisional diagnosis of multicentric Castleman disease was entertained. The HHV-8 (human herpesvirus-8) and EBV (Epstein-Barr virus) viral load was elevated. A left supraclavicular lymph node core biopsy was performed, which showed features of multicentric Castleman disease with plasmablastic aggregates that are EBV (EBER) and HHV-8 positive. He responded well to rituximab treatment and remains well with no symptoms at recent follow-up.\n\nCastleman's Disease with Paraneoplastic Pemphigus\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDinesha; Padyana, Mahesha; Nayak, Kashinath; Nirupama, M; Pai, D Shivanand\n\n2014-01-01\n\nCastleman's disease is a rare autoimmune disorder with varied clinical presentations. Castleman's commonly involves mediastinum and hence it is thoracic in most of the reported cases. Paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) and myasthenia gravis can be associated with multicentric Castleman's disease. Its association with HIV, Kaposi sarcoma, and lymphoma is also well known. We report a rare combination of unicentric, extrathoracic Castleman's disease with PNP and myasthenia gravis.

It has three histological characteristics: a recognizable architecture, germinal center abnormalities, and plasmacytosis. Inherited epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is also a rare disorder caused by a genetic defect. We report a 43-year-old patient with dystrophic EB, non-Hallopeau-Siemens recessive type or dominant type, displaying clinicopathologic features of MCD. In addition, his serum interleukin-6, which is thought to be responsible for the clinical symptoms in MCD, was elevated.\n\n[PET-CT documented remission of multicentric Castleman disease after treatment with rituximab: case report and review].\n\nPubMed\n\nAdam, ZdenÄk; Szturz, Petr; KoukalovÃ¡, Renata; ÅehÃ¡k, ZdenÄk; Pour, LudÄk; KrejÄÃ­, Marta; Å mardovÃ¡, Lenka; Eid, Michal; VolfovÃ¡, PavlÃ­na; ÄermÃ¡kovÃ¡, ZdeÅka; KÅen, LeoÅ¡; Sokol, Filip; Hanke, Ivo; MichalkovÃ¡, Eva; KrÃ¡l, ZdenÄk; Mayer, JiÅÃ­\n\n2015-03-01\n\nWe describe a case of multicentric Castleman disease with generalized lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, accompanied by typical B symptoms - loss of 15 kg, fever of non-infectious origin, night sweats, symptoms of anemia. Histological examination of the nodes with the highest accumulation of fluorodeoxyglucose, taken from mediastinum by thoracoscopy, revealed plasmocellular type of Castleman disease. Tests for HIV and human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) were negative. Three recurrences of herpes zoster indicating an alteration of immunity preceded the dia-gnosis of disease. Treatment was initiated with combination of thalidomide, dexamethasone, and cyclophosphamide. The response after 2 months therapy was not clear and patient doesn't tolerated the therapy well. Therefore, this treatment was terminated and R-CHOP (Mabthera - rituximab, cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisone) was selected as a second-line therapy. Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly were reduced during the 2 cycles of treatment, however, serious infectious complications accompanied the therapy. Therefore, only use of Mabthera monotherapy 375 mg /m2 was administered in 28-day intervals. This treatment has shown efficacy and tolerability. PET-CT scan has demonstrated disappearance of lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, in addition, normalized accumulation of fluorodeoxyglucose. Monotherapy with Mabthera has proved to be effective and well tolerated drug in this case. Currently, there are more effective therapeutic alternatives in multicentric Castleman disease: treatment with monotherapy of rituximab or in combination therapy with immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide or lenalidomide, treatment with anti-IL-6 (siltuximab) or against its receptor (tocilizumab). In the case of ineffectiveness of one treatment option must be tested other alternative. In this case the therapy based on thalidomide wasn't successful, whereas the treatment with Mabthera has achieved disappearance of disease symptoms.\n\nCastleman's Disease: From Basic Mechanisms to Molecular Therapeutics\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEl-Osta, Hazem E.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nCastleman's disease is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder in which there has been recent progress in elucidating underlying mechanisms with potential therapeutic implications. Unicentric Castleman's disease is an indolent condition that is often treated with local approaches. In contrast, patients with multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) have a less favorable prognosis and require systemic treatment. Cytotoxic chemotherapy, with its attendant risk for toxicity, has been widely used to treat MCD, with variable efficacy. The discovery of putative etiologic factors and targets in MCD, particularly human herpes virus 8, CD20, and interleukin (IL)-6, has been translated into the use of rituximab and antiâIL-6-based therapy, as well as antiviral agents. In this article, we review the current state of the art of our understanding of Castleman's disease and its treatment and we provide insight into future treatment strategies based on disease biology. PMID:21441298\n\n[Two HHV8-related illnesses in a HIV-negative patient: Kaposi's sarcoma and multicentric Castleman's disease. Response to treatment with Rituximab and CHOP].\n\nPubMed\n\nPastor, M A; Vasco, B; Mosquera, J M; DebÃ©n, G; Bautista, P; Requena, L\n\n2006-01-01\n\nHuman herpes virus 8 (HHV8) was discovered in 1994 in the biopsy of a Kaposi's sarcoma in a patient with AIDS. Since then it has been identified in all variants of Kaposi's sarcoma and in another two rare disorders: multicentric Castleman's disease and primary body-cavity based lymphomas. The case discusses a 68 year old, HIV-negative male patient, presenting Kaposi's sarcoma for one year and being monitored by dermatology, who presented for weakness, anorexia and fever. On examination, he was found to have adenitis of the lymph nodes in his neck, underarm and groin. A biopsy on one of the swellings led to findings characteristic of multicentric plasma cell variant Castleman's disease. Blood tests for HHV8 and HIV were carried out, resulting positive and negative respectively (IgG anti-HHV8 positive, title 1/640, indirect immunofluorescence). PCR amplification showed HHV8 in peripheral blood. Patient received 8 cycles of CHOP and rituximab, leading to complete disappearance of the adenitis and general symptoms, with no worsening of his Kaposi's sarcoma. Patient remained in complete remission for 10 months after treatment. This paper discusses the case of a HIV-, HHV8+ patient, diagnosed with classic Kaposi's sarcoma, who developed multicentric plasma cell variant Castleman's disease. The coincidence of two or more HHV8-related illnesses in a HIV-negative patient has rarely been described in medical literature. Treatment with rituximab combined with CHOP chemotherapy was effective in this case, and no worsening of the patient's KS was observed.\n\nTaking Control of Castleman Disease: Leveraging Precision Medicine Technologies to Accelerate Rare Disease Research.\n\nPubMed\n\nNewman, Samantha Kass; Jayanthan, Raj K; Mitchell, Grant W; Carreras Tartak, Jossie A; Croglio, Michael P; Suarez, Alexander; Liu, Amy Y; Razzo, Beatrice M; Oyeniran, Enny; Ruth, Jason R; Fajgenbaum, David C\n\n2015-12-01\n\nCastleman disease (CD) is a rare and heterogeneous disorder characterized by lymphadenopathy that may occur in a single lymph node (unicentric) or multiple lymph nodes (multicentric), the latter typically occurring secondary to excessive proinflammatory hypercytokinemia. While a cohort of multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) cases are caused by Human Herpes Virus-8 (HHV-8), the etiology of HHV-8 negative, idiopathic MCD (iMCD), remains unknown. Breakthroughs in \"omics\" technologies that have facilitated the development of precision medicine hold promise for elucidating disease pathogenesis and identifying novel therapies for iMCD. However, in order to leverage precision medicine approaches in rare diseases like CD, stakeholders need to overcome several challenges. To address these challenges, the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network (CDCN) was founded in 2012. In the past 3 years, the CDCN has worked to transform the understanding of the pathogenesis of CD, funded and initiated genomics and proteomics research, and united international experts in a collaborative effort to accelerate progress for CD patients. The CDCN's collaborative structure leverages the tools of precision medicine and serves as a model for both scientific discovery and advancing patient care.\n\nMulticentric Castleman's disease in human immunodeficiency virus infection: two case reports.\n\nPubMed\n\nCaroline Ribeiro Sales, Amanda; RomÃ£o de Souza Junior, Valter; Iglis de Oliveira, Marta; Azevedo Braga Albuquerque, Claudia; de Barros Campelo JÃºnior, EvÃ´nio; SÃ©rgio Ramos de AraÃºjo, Paulo\n\n2018-05-05\n\nCastleman's Disease is a rare B-cell lymphoproliferative disease. It is mostly benign and is characterized by non-neoplastic lymph node hypertrophy, associated with infection by human herpesvirus-8 in people with the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Although the unicentric or localized form presents as benign, the multifocal form can manifest severe systemic symptoms. We report two unusual cases of men presenting cervical enlarged lymph nodes that were believed to be infectious. The first case is a 41-year-old feoderm man who presented to the Department of Infectious Diseases of the Hospital das ClÃ­nicas in May 2015, with irregular fever history (38-39Â Â°C), dyspnea, weight loss (8Â kg/1Â year), and asthenia with increased cervical lymph nodes of 1-year duration. His immunohistochemical diagnosis presented Castleman's disease in plasmacytic/diffuse form. In the second case, a 35-year-old feoderm man presented at the same hospital with multiple cervical enlarged lymph nodes and histopathological evidence of Castleman's disease associated with human herpesvirus-8. Considering the importance of differential diagnosis of lymphoid disorders, Castleman's disease is a challenging diagnosis in people living with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and can be easily misdiagnosed when lymphoid disorders are present in the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome population due to nonspecific symptoms and signs.\n\nUpdate and new approaches in the treatment of Castleman disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChan, Kah-Lok; Lade, Stephen; Prince, H Miles; Harrison, Simon J\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFirst described 60 years ago, Castleman disease comprises a rare and heterogeneous cluster of disorders, characterized by lymphadenopathy with unique histological features and associated with cytokine-driven constitutional symptoms and biochemical disturbances. Although unicentric Castleman disease is curable with complete surgical excision, its multicentric counterpart is a considerable therapeutic challenge. The recent development of biological agents, particularly monoclonal antibodies to interleukin-6 and its receptor, allow for more targeted disease-specific intervention that promises improved response rates and more durable disease control; however, further work is required to fill knowledge gaps in terms of underlying pathophysiology and to facilitate alternative treatment options for refractory cases.

There are two clinical types: unicentric and multicentric with three histological variants, hyaline-vascular, plasma celular and mixed. The most common sites of this are mediastinum, adbomen and neck. Magnetic resonance imaging is well suited to depict the characteristics of the masses and their relationship to adjacent structures. The knowledge of this disease and its inclusiÃ³n in the differential diagnosis from other neck masses will contribute to the therapeutic approach. A 21 years old female patient with a left neck mass characterized by magnetic resonance as solid, heterogeneous, vascularized lesiÃ³n, pre dominantly isointensa on T1-weighted images an high signal on T2-weighted images and fat sat that demonstrate moderate enhancement after contraste material administration located in posterior space of the neck with extensiÃ³n at thoracic outlet displacing structures of carotid, anterior cervical and viceral spaces. She underwent complete surgical resectiÃ³n of the mass with histopathological diagnosis of hyaline-vascular type of CastlemanÂ´s disease. Magnetic resonance is well suited to depict characteristic and the extent of mass in the neck contributing to narrow the differential diagnosis. Imaging findings, especially of magnetic resonance are very important to choose the treatment of CastlemanÂ´s disease.\n\nCastleman Disease Collaborative Network Biobank\n\nClinicalTrials.gov\n\n2017-07-12\n\nCastleman Disease; Castleman's Disease; Giant Lymph Node Hyperplasia; Angiofollicular Lymph Hyperplasia; Angiofollicular Lymph Node Hyperplasia; Angiofollicular Lymphoid Hyperplasia; GLNH; Hyperplasia; Giant Lymph Node\n\nInternational Registry for Patients With Castleman Disease\n\nClinicalTrials.gov\n\n2017-07-12\n\nCastleman Disease; Castleman's Disease; Giant Lymph Node Hyperplasia; Angiofollicular Lymph Hyperplasia; Angiofollicular Lymph Node Hyperplasia; Angiofollicular Lymphoid Hyperplasia; GLNH; Hyperplasia, Giant Lymph Node; Lymph Node Hyperplasia, Giant\n\nCastleman's disease of the spleen.\n\nPubMed\n\nMantas, Dimitrios; Damaskos, Christos; Dailiani, Panagiota; Samarkos, Michael; Korkolopoulou, Penelope\n\n2017-06-01\n\nCastleman's disease (CD), also known as giant or angiofolicular lymphoid hyperplasia or lymphoid hamartoma, is a group of atypical lymphoproliferative disorders that share common lymph node histological features and may be localized either to a single lymph node (unicentric) or occur systemically (multicentric). Herein, we present a rare case of a of 75-year-old female patient who was referred to our department and after a thorough work-up, underwent splenectomy with synchronous resection of an accessory spleen, splenic artery lymph nodes, and splenic hilar lymph nodes due to splenic involvement in a multicentric CD. The pathology of the specimens led to the conclusion that it was a case of polycentric HHV-8-positive CD, affecting the spleen, the accessory spleen, and the lymph nodes. Incidence of this rare condition is believed to be approximately 0.001-0.05%. CD has been linked to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8), and is associated with malignancies. The pathogenesis mechanism is considered to be a dysregulation and hypersecretion of cytokines, either idiopathic or secondary to a viral infection, with the latter considered the most frequent. Solid organ involvement is very rare as is splenic involvement.\n\nKSHV-associated multicentric Castleman disease: A tangle of different entities requiring multitarget treatment strategies.\n\nPubMed\n\nCarbone, Antonino; De Paoli, Paolo; Gloghini, Annunziata; Vaccher, Emanuela\n\n2015-07-15\n\nMulticentric Castleman Disease (MCD) is a lymphoproliferative disorder presenting with heterogeneous pathological and clinical features. It comprises disease entities with a complex aetiology and overlapping pathogenesis. MCD can be found in association with HIV infection, plasma-cell dyscrasias, Kaposi sarcoma (KS), B-cell lymphomas including primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and its solid variant, and Hodgkin lymphoma. In KSHV-associated MCD cases, a common association is KS and a specific variant of lymphoma referred to as \"plasmablastic lymphoma,\" also called \"large B-cell lymphoma arising in KSHV-associated MCD\" lacking EBV infection. MCD is often referred to as human interleukin-6 (hIL-6) syndrome, since an overproduction of IL-6 occurs in MCD-associated diseases as well as in MCD itself. hIL-6 and a viral IL-6 (vIL-6) homolog encoded by KSHV can independently or together lead to flares of KSHV-associated MCD. Recently, a new clinical entity was proposed to describe a severe systemic infection/reactivation of KSHV: KSHV inflammatory syndrome (KICS). KICS may contribute in inducing the inflammatory symptoms seen in some patients with severe KS or PEL. The precise relationship of KICS to KSHV-associated MCD is unclear and it is possible that KICS may be prodromal symptoms to frank KSHV-associated MCD. Options for treatment of KSHV-associated MCD and related diseases include monoclonal antibodies, chemotherapy, immune modulators, virus-activated cytotoxic therapy and antiviral therapies. A comprehensive understanding of the intricacies of the HIV-KSHV coinfection will probably lead to additional advances in therapy and managements for these disorders.

Newly developed lymphadenopathy in a patient with these disorders should prompt pathological evaluation. Castleman's disease is a lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by enlarged hyperplastic lymph nodes with regressed follicles surrounded by expanded mantle zones of small lymphocytes, and interfollicular vascular proliferation in the hyaline-vascular type. Similar to sarcoidosis and Crohns disease, its etiology is incompletely understood, although immune dysregulation, genetic factors and infectious and environmental factors are thought to play a role in all three diseases. Interleukin-6 is a possible pathological common factor between these three disease processed. Unicentric, hyaline-vascular type Castleman's disease can be treated successfully with complete surgical resection. We report a patient with long history of sarcoidosis and Crohns disease with newly developed lymphadenopathy which was found to be due to Castleman's disease.\n\nIntrathoracic tumor of the chest wall: A case of Castleman's disease mimicking myositis of the lower extremities.\n\nPubMed\n\nTampakis, Athanasios; Tampaki, Ekaterini Christina; Daikeler, Thomas; Lardinois, Didier\n\n2017-11-01\n\nCastleman's disease refers to a group of uncommon lymphoproliferative disorders which exhibit common lymph-node histological features. A 72-year-old male patient presented with signs of lower limb myositis. Detailed work-up focused initially on evaluating hematological malignancies, the presence of a solid tumor, autoimmune diseases and degenerative disorders of the peripheral nerves. Finally, a PET-CT scan was performed to exclude paraneoplastic manifestations of a primary tumor, revealing Â however a tumor of the thoracic wall. The definite histological diagnosis confirmed the presence of unicentric Castleman's disease of the chest wall. The manifestations of the present case suggest that a systemic inflammation might occur in the unicentric form of the disease possibly due to cytokine hypersecretion. The unicentric manifestation of theÂ disease should be well distinguished from the multicentric appearance. Unicentric disease is a surgical condition and warrants a follow-up based on the systemic inflammation that might occur.\n\nCarotid body tumor imitator: An interesting case of Castleman's disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nShakir, Hakeem J; Diletti, Sara M; Hart, Alexandra M; Meyers, Joshua E; Dumont, Travis M; Siddiqui, Adnan H\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThere are very few reports in the literature of Castleman's disease affecting the carotid artery and a single previous report of a case of Castleman's disease of the neck originally mistaken as a carotid body tumor. We describe a rare case of Castleman's disease, manifesting with classic radiographic hallmarks of a carotid body tumor. The postoperative pathologic examination identified the resected mass as Castleman's lymphadenopathy. The management of this particular case is discussed, and the findings are highlighted. We present a unique case of a tumor initially and incorrectly diagnosed as a carotid body tumor. However, after comprehensive treatment with endovascular and surgical modalities and subsequent pathologic examination, the diagnosis of this rare entity was made.\n\nRituximab plus liposomal doxorubicin in HIV-infected patients with KSHV-associated multicentric Castleman disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPolizzotto, Mark N.; Aleman, Karen; Wyvill, Kathleen M.; Marshall, Vickie; Whitby, Denise; Wang, Victoria; Pittaluga, Stefania; OâMahony, Deirdre; Steinberg, Seth M.; Little, Richard F.; Yarchoan, Robert\n\n2014-01-01\n\nKaposi sarcoma (KS) herpesvirusâassociated multicentric Castleman disease (KSHV-MCD) is a lymphoproliferative disorder, most commonly seen in HIV-infected patients, that has a high mortality if untreated. Concurrent KS is common. Although rituximab has reported activity in KSHV-MCD, its use is often associated with KS progression. Within a natural history study of KSHV-MCD, we prospectively evaluated rituximab 375 mg/m2 combined with liposomal doxorubicin 20 mg/m2 (R-Dox) every 3 weeks in 17 patients. Patients received a median of 4 cycles (range 3-9). All received antiretroviral therapy, 11 received consolidation interferon-Î±, and 6 received consolidation high-dose zidovudine with valganciclovir. Using NCI KSHV-MCD response criteria, major clinical and biochemical responses were attained in 94% and 88% of patients, respectively. With a median 58 monthsâ potential follow-up, 3-year event-free survival was 69% and 3-year overall survival was 81%. During R-Dox therapy, cutaneous KS developed in 1 patient, whereas 5 of 6 patients with it had clinical improvement. R-Dox was associated with significant improvement in anemia and hypoalbuminemia. KSHV viral load, KSHV viral interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, human interleukin-6, and serum immunoglobulin free light chains decreased with therapy. R-Dox is effective in symptomatic KSHV-MCD and may be useful in patients with concurrent KS. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00092222.

We conducted a retrospective chart review for patients with biopsy-proven Castleman disease evaluated between January 2003 and December 2014. Patients with associated peripheral neuropathy were identified and divided into 2 groups: those with Castleman disease without POEMS syndrome (CD-PN) and those with Castleman disease with POEMS syndrome (CD-POEMS). We used a cohort of patients with POEMS as controls. Clinical, electrodiagnostic, and laboratory characteristics were collected and compared among patient subgroups. There were 7 patients with CD-PN, 20 with CD-POEMS, and 122 with POEMS. Patients with CD-PN had the mildest neuropathy characterized by predominant sensory symptoms with no pain and mild distal sensory deficits (median Neuropathy Impairment Score of 7 points). Although both patients with CD-POEMS and patients with POEMS had a severe sensory and motor neuropathy, patients with CD-POEMS were less affected (median Neuropathy Impairment Score of 33 and 66 points, respectively). The degree of severity was also reflected on electrodiagnostic testing in which patients with CD-PN demonstrated a mild degree of axonal loss, followed by patients with CD-POEMS and then those with POEMS. Demyelinating features, defined by European Federation of Neurologic Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society criteria, were present in 43% of the CD-PN, 78% of the CD-POEMS, and 86% of the POEMS group. There is a spectrum of demyelinating peripheral neuropathies associated with Castleman disease. CD-PN is sensory predominant and is the mildest phenotype, whereas CD-POEMS is a more severe sensory and motor neuropathy. Compared to the POEMS cohort, those with CD-POEMS neuropathy have a similar but less severe phenotype. Whether these patients respond differently to treatment deserves further study.

It is associated with a number of malignancies, including Kaposi sarcoma, non-Hodgkin's and Hodgkins lymphoma, and POEMS syndrome. This report describes the case of a 38Â year old gentleman, presenting with painless hematuria. Initial investigations, including flexible cystoscopy were unremarkable. However, subsequent imaging including CT Urogram and MR pelvis revealed multiple prevesical lesions.

Three histological types have been reported, along with several clinical forms according to clinical presentation, histological substrate and associated diseases. Interleukin-6, its receptor polymorphisms, the human immunodeficiency virus and the human herpes virus 8 are involved in the etiopathogenesis of Castleman's disease. The study of this disease has shed light on a syndrome whose incidence is unknown. Despite recent significant advances in our understanding of this disease and the increasing therapeutic experience with rituximab, tocilizumab and siltuximab, there are still difficult questions concerning its aetiology, prognosis and optimal treatment.

While the disease may involve all parts of the body, the mediastinum appears to be the most common part of involvement. In this study, we present two cases of Castleman disease with different localizations that mimicked malignancy. A 62-year-old female patient presented with jaundice. Laboratory analysis indicated aspartate aminotransferase: 250 U/L, total bilirubin: 4 mg/dl, and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9: 900 U/ml. Computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed a mass originating from the pancreas head which resulted in a biliary tract obstruction. A positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) showed that the only site of involvement was the pancreas head. A decision was made to perform pancreaticoduodenectomy. During intra-abdominal exploration, lymphadenopathies were identified in the surroundings of the retropancreatic portal vein and the hepatic artery. Histopathological investigation of the dissected lymph nodes demonstrated findings consistent with granulomatous plasma-cell-rich Castleman disease. A 55-year-old female patient presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Computerized tomography of the abdomen showed an abdominal mass of 7 cm, originating from the mesenterium, with high-contrast uptake in the mesenterium in the lower abdominal quadrant. The mesenteric mass was resected along with segmentary small intestine resection. Histopathological investigation of the mass showed a giant granulomatous structure that consisted of plasma cellsÂ consistent with Castleman disease. Castleman disease should be kept in mind during differential diagnosis of locally advanced lymph nodes observed during preoperative investigations and intraoperative exploration.\n\nSonographic findings of localized Castleman disease of the abdomen and pelvis.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhou, Wei; Zhan, Weiwei; Zhou, Jianqiao; Zhu, Ying; Yao, Jiejie\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to sonographically evaluate the diagnosis of localized Castleman disease in the abdomen and pelvis. This was a retrospective analysis of 18 cases of Castleman disease localized in the abdomen and pelvis. The following features of the lesions were assessed on sonography (US): location, size, margin, echogenicity, echotexture, intralesional cystic necrosis, intralesional calcification, posterior acoustic enhancement, and blood supply. Of the 18 tumors, 16 were located in the abdomen and 2 were located in the pelvis close to iliac vessels. The most frequent appearance of localized Castleman disease in the abdomen and pelvis on US was of a single, well-defined, hypoechoic solid mass with no intralesional cystic necrosis. The internal echotexture was homogeneous in 4 cases and heterogeneous in 14 cases, with thin hyperechoic septa (nâ=â14) or calcifications (nâ=â3). Posterior acoustic enhancement was seen in 17 of the 18 cases (94%). Ninety-four percent of the lesions (17/18) had marked vascularity on color Doppler US. Localized Castleman disease in the abdomen and pelvis usually appears on US as a heterogeneously hypoechoic lesion containing thin septa, and more commonly than not, demonstrates posterior acoustic enhancement and marked vascularity.

The clinical profiles of 19 patients with neck giant lymph node hyperplasia were analyzed retrospectively. There were 8 males and 11 females with a median age of 40 years old (range: 7 - 74). The tumor locations were neck (n = 12), neck & mediastinal cavity (n = 2), axillary fossa (n = 2), retroperitoneal area (n = 2) and abdominal cavity (n = 1). Eighteen of them underwent surgical resection of tumor or lymph nodes. All were diagnosed as CD by pathological examinations. There were 16 localized CD (LCD) including hyaline vascular type (HV type, n = 11), mixed type (mix type, n = 4) and plasma cell type-Hodgkin's disease (n = 1). Among 3 multicentric CD (MCD), there were 2 case of plasma cell type (PC type) and 1 case of mixed type (mix type). Long-term survival was achieved in 19 cases among which 1 case of plasma cell type MCD survived for 5 years and underwent a second operation and postoperative chemotherapy of CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine & prednisone) regimen for 3 cycles due to recurrence in 2 years and 1 case of plasma cell type LCD-Hodgkin's disease survived for 15 months and underwent a second operation and postoperative chemotherapy of ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine & dacarbazine)regimen for 6 cycles due to recurrence in 6 months. One case of plasma cell type MCD in abdominal cavity on chemotherapy of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine & prednisone) regimen for 6 cycles was discharged after a successful management of intestinal obstruction. The major clinical symptom of CD is a gradually enlarging painless mass. Surgical resection of tumor remains the first-line treatment for localized CD and the prognosis is excellent. Multicentric and plasma cell type CDs are prone to recurrence and transformation to lymphoma. And their first-line therapeutic should encompass multi-modality regimens of surgery and adjuvant\n\nImmunophenotypic analysis of the Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV; HHV-8)-infected B cells in HIV+ multicentric Castleman disease (MCD).\n\nPubMed\n\nChadburn, A; Hyjek, E M; Tam, W; Liu, Y; Rengifo, T; Cesarman, E; Knowles, D M\n\n2008-11-01\n\nKaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) is aetiologically related to Kaposi sarcoma, classical and extracavitary primary effusion lymphoma (PEL; EC-PEL) and multicentric Castleman disease (MCD), entities preferentially occurring in HIV-infected individuals. Characterization of HIV-associated PELs/EC-PELs suggests that the KSHV-infected malignant cells originate from a pre-terminal stage of B-cell differentiation. However, only limited phenotypic studies have been performed on HIV+ MCD, including for PR domain containing 1 with zinc finger domain/B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (PRDM1/BLIMP1), a key regulator of terminal B-cell differentiation. The aim was to characterize KSHV-infected cells in 17 cases of HIV+ MCD. Double immunohistochemistry and immunohistochemistry-in situ hybridization were used to characterize the KSHV-infected cells in MCD; the results were compared with the phenotypic profiles of 39 PELs/EC-PELs and seven PEL cell lines. Whereas the immunophenotype of KSHV-infected cells in MCD and malignant KSHV+ PEL cells was similar (PAX5, Bcl-6-; PRDM1/BLIMP1, IRF4/MUM1+; Ki67+), the MCD KSHV-infected cells differed, as they expressed OCT2, cytoplasmic lambda immunoglobulin; variably expressed CD27; lacked CD138; and were Epstein-Barr virus negative. Although both PEL and MCD originate from KSHV-infected pre-terminally differentiated B cells, these findings, with previously reported genetic studies, indicate HIV+ MCD may arise from extrafollicular B cells, whereas PELs may originate from cells that have traversed the germinal centre.\n\nCastleman disease presenting as obstructive jaundice.\n\nPubMed\n\nAl-Salamah, Saleh M; Khan, Iftikhar A; Khalid, Kamran; Al-Shakweer, Wafaa A\n\n2005-01-01\n\nA 48-year-old Saudi male was admitted with features of obstructive jaundice. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed stricture in distal common bile duct CBD. Computed tomography scan revealed lymphadenopathy along CBD and in porta hepatis. Cholangiocarcinoma, lymphoma or metastatic deposits were suspected but no definite preoperative diagnosis could be established. Laparotomy disclosed lymph node enlargement in porta hepatis and along the CBD and lesser curvature of the stomach. Triple bypass procedure was performed to relieve the obstruction. Pathological examination of the lymph nodes showed Castleman disease of hyaline vascular type.\n\nCastleman's disease imitating adrenal mass in the retroperitoneal area.\n\nPubMed\n\nKoÃ§, GÃ¶khan; Turk, Hakan; Un, SÄ±tkÄ±; Isoglu, Cemal Selcuk; Zorlu, Ferruh\n\n2015-01-01\n\nCastleman's disease (CD) is a non-clonal lymph node hyperplasia, mostly seen in the mediastinum.

Siltuximab, an anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated durable tumor and symptomatic responses in a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled study of MCD. This preplanned safety analysis was conducted to evaluate the long-term safety of siltuximab treatment among 19 patients with MCD who had stable disease or better and were enrolled in a phase-1 study and subsequent ongoing, open-label, phase-2 extension study. Dosing was 11 mg/kg administered intravenously every 3 weeks, per protocol, or every 6 weeks at the investigator's discretion. Safety monitoring focused on potential risks associated with the anti-IL-6 mechanism of action. Investigator-assessed disease control status was also documented. Median treatment duration for the 19 patients was 5.1 (range 3.4, 7.2) years, with 14 (74%) patients treated for >4 years. Grade-â¥ 3 adverse events (AEs) reported in >1 patient included hypertension (n = 3) and nausea, cellulitis, and fatigue (n = 2 each). Grade-â¥ 3 AEs at least possibly attributed to siltuximab were leukopenia, lymphopenia, and a serious AE of polycythemia (n = 1 each). Hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol) were reported in 8 and 9 patients, respectively. No disease relapses were observed, and 8 of 19 patients were able to switch to an every-6-week dosing schedule. All MCD patients in this extension study have received siltuximab for a prolonged duration (up to 7 years) without evidence of cumulative toxicity or treatment discontinuations and with few serious infections. All patients are alive, demonstrate sustained disease control, and continue to receive siltuximab.\n\nClinical spectrum of Castleman diseaseâassociated neuropathy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNaddaf, Elie; Dispenzieri, Angela; Mandrekar, Jay\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjective: To define the peripheral neuropathy phenotypes associated with Castleman disease. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review for patients with biopsy-proven Castleman disease evaluated between January 2003 and December 2014. Patients with associated peripheral neuropathy were identified and divided into 2 groups: those with Castleman disease without POEMS syndrome (CD-PN) and those with Castleman disease with POEMS syndrome (CD-POEMS). We used a cohort of patients with POEMS as controls. Clinical, electrodiagnostic, and laboratory characteristics were collected and compared among patient subgroups. Results: There were 7 patients with CD-PN, 20 with CD-POEMS, and 122 with POEMS. Patients with CD-PN had the mildest neuropathy characterized by predominant sensory symptoms with no pain and mild distal sensory deficits (median Neuropathy Impairment Score of 7 points). Although both patients with CD-POEMS and patients with POEMS had a severe sensory and motor neuropathy, patients with CD-POEMS were less affected (median Neuropathy Impairment Score of 33 and 66 points, respectively). The degree of severity was also reflected on electrodiagnostic testing in which patients with CD-PN demonstrated a mild degree of axonal loss, followed by patients with CD-POEMS and then those with POEMS. Demyelinating features, defined by European Federation of Neurologic Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society criteria, were present in 43% of the CD-PN, 78% of the CD-POEMS, and 86% of the POEMS group. Conclusion: There is a spectrum of demyelinating peripheral neuropathies associated with Castleman disease. CD-PN is sensory predominant and is the mildest phenotype, whereas CD-POEMS is a more severe sensory and motor neuropathy. Compared to the POEMS cohort, those with CD-POEMS neuropathy have a similar but less severe phenotype. Whether these patients respond differently to treatment deserves further study.

To assess the clinical features, outcomes, and prognostic factors of this disease, we retrospectively analyzed 185 HIV-negative CD patients from four medical centers in southern China. The median age was 37Â years. One hundred and twenty-one patients (65.4%) were classified as unicentric CD (UCD) and 64 patients (34.6%) were classified as multicentric CD (MCD). The histology subtype was hyaline-vascular for 132 patients (71.4%), plasma cell for 50 patients (27%), and mixed type for 3 patients (1.6%). The 5-year overall survival (OS) of 185 CD cases was 80.3%. All UCD patients underwent surgical excision, whereas the treatment strategies of MCD patients were heterogeneous. The outcome for UCD patients was better than MCD patients, with 5-year OS rates of 93.6% and 51.2%, respectively. In further analysis of the MCD subgroup, a multivariate analysis using a Cox regression model revealed that age, splenomegaly and pretreatment serum albumin level were independent prognostic factors for OS. This multicenter study comprising the largest sample size to date suggested that MCD is a distinct entity from UCD with a significantly worse outcome. Older age (â¥40Â years), splenomegaly, and hypoalbuminemia were risk factors for poorer MCD prognosis. Â© 2017 The Authors.

In this study, we report 3 patients with this combination. They had immunologic features similar to patients with classic anti-GBM disease. Sera from the 3 patients recognized the noncollagenous (NC) domain of the Î±3 chain of type IV collagen (Î±3(IV)NC1) and its 2 major epitopes, EA and EB. All 4 immunogloblin G (IgG) subclasses against Î±3(IV)NC1 were detectable, with predominance of IgG1. In one patient with lymph node biopsy specimens available, sporadic plasma cells producing Î±3(IV)NC1-IgG were found, suggesting a causal relationship between the 2 diseases. One patient, who achieved remission with antibody clearance and normalization of serum creatinine and interleukin 6 concentrations after plasma exchange and 3 cycles of chemotherapy, experienced recurrence of anti-GBM antibodies and an increase in interleukin 6 concentration after chemotherapy discontinuation because of adverse effects, but both returned to normal after another cycle of chemotherapy. This clinical course and the pathologic findings support the hypothesis that the Castleman disease-associated tumor cells are the source of the anti-GBM autoantibodies.

It has subsequently been recognized that KSHVâMCD is a distinct entity from other forms of MCD. Like MCD that is unrelated to KSHV, the clinical presentation of KSHVâMCD is dominated by systemic inflammatory symptoms including fevers, cachexia, and laboratory abnormalities including cytopenias, hypoalbuminemia, hyponatremia, and elevated C-reactive protein. Pathologically KSHVâMCD is characterized by polyclonal, IgM-lambda restricted plasmacytoid cells in the intrafollicular areas of affected lymph nodes. A portion of these cells are infected with KSHV and a sizable subset of these cells express KSHV lytic genes including a viral homolog of interleukin-6 (vIL-6). Patients with KSHVâMCD generally have elevated KSHV viral loads in their peripheral blood. Production of vIL-6 and induction of human (h) IL-6 both contribute to symptoms, perhaps in combination with overproduction of IL-10 and other cytokines. Until recently, the prognosis of patients with KSHVâMCD was poor. Recent therapeutic advances targeting KSHV-infected B cells with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab and utilizing KSHV enzymes to target KSHV-infected cells have substantially improved patient outcomes. Recently another KSHV-associated condition, the KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome (KICS) has been described. Its clinical manifestations resemble those of KSHVâMCD but lymphadenopathy is not prominent and the pathologic nodal changes of KSHVâMCD are absent. Patients with KICS exhibit elevated KSHV viral loads and elevation of vIL-6, homolog of human interleukin-6 and IL-10 comparable to those seen in KSHVâMCD; the cellular origin of these is a matter of investigation.

Depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder (MDD) have been associated with changes in cytokines and their signaling. The current study examined the effect of IL-6 monoclonal antibody administration on depressive symptoms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD). The data were obtained from two phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials designed to test the efficacy of sirukumab in RA (N=176) or of siltuximab in MCD (N=65), and were analyzed post hoc to investigate the effects of these IL-6 antibodies on depressive symptoms. The SF-36 questionnaire items on depressed-mood and anhedonia were combined as the measure for depressive symptoms. The study participants were grouped by the presence/absence of prevalent depressed mood and anhedonia (PDMA, meaning either depressed mood or anhedonia was present at least 'most of the time' and the other at least 'some of the time' for four weeks) at baseline; 26.1% of the RA sample and 15.4% of the MCD sample met criteria for PDMA at baseline. Compared with placebo, sirukumab and siltuximab produced significantly greater improvements on depressive symptoms. To account for an effect on mood due to changes in RA or MCD, the analysis was (1) adjusted for symptom severities using DAS28-CRP for RA and MCDOS for MCD alone or together with bodily pain and physical functioning, and (2) performed within RA and MCD non-responders. Improvement in depressive symptoms remained significant in the treated group for both drugs. The significance over placebo was also observed in the siltuximab study. The improvement in depressive symptoms by sirukumab correlated positively with the baseline soluble IL-6 receptor levels. The data together suggest that the IL-6 antibodies improve depressive symptoms in patients with RA and MCD. Further studies are needed to elucidate to what extents the IL-6 antibodies\n\nCastleman's disease presenting as a pleural tumor: a case report with CT findings.\n\nPubMed\n\nDoo, Kyung Won; Kim, Bomi\n\n2018-02-01\n\nCastleman's disease (CD) is an uncommon benign lymphoproliferative disorder which most commonly involves the mediastinum but rarely affects the pleura.

Jeffrey; Li, Yong; Fajgenbaum, David C.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nCastleman disease (CD) comprises 3 poorly understood lymphoproliferative variants sharing several common histopathological features. Unicentric CD (UCD) is localized to a single region of lymph nodes. Multicentric CD (MCD) manifests with systemic inflammatory symptoms and organ dysfunction due to cytokine dysregulation and involves multiple lymph node regions. Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) causes MCD (HHV-8âassociated MCD) in immunocompromised individuals, such as HIV-infected patients. However, >50% of MCD cases are HIV and HHV-8 negative (defined as idiopathic [iMCD]). The clinical and biological behavior of CD remains poorly elucidated. Here, we analyzed the clinicopathologic features of 74 patients (43 with UCD and 31 with iMCD) and therapeutic response of 96 patients (43 with UCD and 53 with iMCD) with HIV-/HHV-8ânegative CD compared with 51 HIV-/HHV-8âpositive patients. Systemic inflammatory symptoms and elevated inflammatory factors were more common in iMCD patients than UCD patients. Abnormal bone marrow features were more frequent in iMCD (77.0%) than UCD (45%); the most frequent was plasmacytosis, which was seen in 3% to 30.4% of marrow cells. In the lymph nodes, higher numbers of CD3+ lymphocytes (median, 58.88 Â± 20.57) and lower frequency of CD19+/CD5+ (median, 5.88 Â± 6.52) were observed in iMCD patients compared with UCD patients (median CD3+ cells, 43.19 Â± 17.37; median CD19+/CD5+ cells, 17.37 Â± 15.80). Complete surgical resection is a better option for patients with UCD. Siltuximab had a greater proportion of complete responses and longer progression-free survival (PFS) for iMCD than rituximab.

Castleman's disease (CD) was diagnosed by axillary lymph node biopsy. Five months later, painful purpura (multiple palpable 5Â mm lesions) developed on his legs, gradually spreading to the upper limbs, thighs, and trunk, accompanied by arthralgia of the wrists, ankles, and knees. Skin biopsy revealed leukocytoclastic vasculitis with IgA deposits in dermal vessels. Accordingly, IgA vasculitis (Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura) was diagnosed. Tocilizumab (an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody) was administered intravenously at 8Â mg/kg and treatment was repeated at monthly intervals. His purpura and clinical findings specific to CD improved rapidly. CD is well known to cause various skin lesions. The findings in this case indicate that overproduction of IL-6 contributes to IgA vasculitis (Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura) as well as to the pathogenesis of CD.\n\n[Analysis of the diagnosis and treatment of Castleman disease originating in the head and neck].\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, L; Wang, L F; Sang, J Z; Chen, L\n\n2018-06-05\n\nObjective: To improve diagnosis and treatment of Castleman' s disease (CD) originating in the head and neck. Method: Of 15 cases of Castleman' s disease originating in the head and neck, 8 cases occurred in the right side of the neck, 6 cases in the left side, and 1 case in both sides. Eleven cases were focal type CD (UCD), and 4 cases were multi-center type CD (MCD). All patients underwent imaging examination and neck nephrectomy. Four patients with MCD received drug treatment after surgery. Result: During follow-up from 12 to 69 months, one patient suffered a slight facial paralysis due to a close relationship between mass and the parotid gland. One patient had obvious postoperative scar growth and occasional itching; another patient suffered mild pain in shoulder;4 cases of multi-center patients survived with tumor; 2 cases lost follow-up at 57 months, 65 months after follow-up, respectively. There were no recurrence in these two cases during the follow-up period; the remaining 6 cases had no exceptions. Conclusion: The clinical manifestations of CD patients are different. Pathological examination is an important basis for diagnosis. After a definite diagnosis, related examinations need to be completed. The LCD patients generally had a good prognosis, and the MCD patients often had a poor prognosis. For patients with parapharyngeal masses complicated by thyroid tumors, surgery can be performed at the same time.î.

We report a 49-year-old patient who presented with a hypersensitivity reaction following an infusion of rituximab (375mg/m(2)) in the context of a Castleman's syndrome. After a clinical flare (splenomegaly, adenopathies) despite treatment with tocilizumab, anakinra and valganciclovir, the reintroduction of rituximab was decided, according to the rapid desensitization protocol. Four full dose desensitizations were successfully performed allowing immediate clinical improvement (apyrexia, loss of sweating and lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly partial regression) and biological (negativation of HHV8Â viral load, and disappearance of neutropenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia). Rapid desensitization is a promising method for the pursuit of rituximab therapy after a hypersensitivity reaction and should be considered in patients with no acceptable therapeutic alternative.

Clinical and paraclinical assessments performed at admission confirmed the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade. Surgical intervention was performed and 400 mL of clear effusion were drained. Post-operative evolution was marked by recurrence of symptoms, requiring after 3 weeks a new drainage of 600 mL of clear effusion, and biopsy of the pericardium was performed. Pathological exam described serous pericarditis with chronic inflammatory infiltrate, xanthogranulomatous reaction intricated in the pericardium and mesothelial hyperplasia. The patient was subsequently transferred to the Department of Internal Medicine for further investigations. Physical examination showed a patient with altered general status, pallor, vesicular murmur absent in both bases, presenting cutaneous hyperpigmentation at the level of the right hemi-abdomen and hip with posterior extension, and a peripheral indurated erythematous plaque. The patient presented nodular masses of 3 cm in the right latero-cervical and bilateral axillary regions, non-adherent to the superficial structures, as well as adenopathic blocks in both inguinal regions. CT scan of the thorax and abdomen showed moderate bilateral pleuresia, minimal pericardial effusion (15 mm) and multiple adenopathies on both sides of the diaphragm.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of 48 intrathoracic CD patients with definite pathological diagnosis who were hospitalized between 1992 and 2012 in a Chinese tertiary referral hospital. The study included 16 cases with unicentric CD (UCD) and 32 cases with multicentric CD (MCD). UCD were younger than MCD (30.5y vs 41.6ys, Pâ<â0.05). MCD were more symptomatic (50% vs 96.9%, Pâ<â0.001) and sicker than UCD, including more fever, hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly and hypoalbuminemia. All of UCD showed solitary mass in various sites and two of them were complicated by small pleural effusion. In the MCD group, their chest CT showed obvious lymphadenopathy in the hilum and/or mediastinum (100%), diffuse parenchymal lung shadows (43.75%), pleural effusion (40.6%), mass in the mediastinum (6.25%) or hilum (3.12%) and bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) (3.12%). Besides LIP-like images, multiple nodules of different size and sites, patchy, ground-glass opacities and consolidation were showed in their chest CT. Surgery were arranged for all UCD for diagnosis and treatment and all were alive. In MCD group, superficial lymph nodes biopsies (21 cases), surgery biopsy (9 cases) and CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy (2 cases) were performed. Hyaline vascular (HV) variant were more common in the UCD group (75% vs 37.5%, Pâ<â0.05). In MCD group, 28 cases were prescribed with chemotherapy, one refused to receive therapy and the rest three were arranged for regular follow-up. Among MCD, 18 cases was improved, 7 cases was stable, 4 cases lost follow-up and 3 cases died. Intrathoracic MCD was more common than UCD in our hospital. MCD was older, more symptomic and sicker than UCD. HV variant were more common in UCD.

Strikingly similar anterior mediastinal fat swellings with soft tissue density were observed in the patients on chest computed tomography. In TAFRO syndrome, bilateral pleural effusion and slight lymph node swelling are common in the thoracic region; however, anterior mediastinal lesions have not been previously observed. Although the mechanisms of anterior mediastinal lesions have not been defined, these lesions seem to have a close relationship with TAFRO syndrome. Copyright Â© 2016 The Japanese Respiratory Society.

Toker cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of clear cell papulosis, cutaneous hamartoma with pagetoid cells, and rare cases of primary extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) but not in secondary EMPD with underlying adenocarcinoma. The pathogenesis of primary EMPD is not well defined. We report a case of multicentric primary EMPD with evidence of Toker cell proliferation and nonaggressive biologic behavior in a 63-year-old white man. A detailed description of the morphologic and biologic features of Toker cells and their possible carcinogenetic links also are discussed. Based on the observation and follow-up of our patient, we hypothesize that multicentric primary EMPD starts with Toker cell hyperplasia and can potentially evolve to carcinoma in the genital region.\n\nTribute to A.

Patients with MCD present with systemic symptoms and multiple lymphadenopathy. Lymph node biopsy is necessary for the diagnosis of various histological MCD patterns including hyaline vascular, plasma cell, and mixed types. Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) infection was identified as an important etiology of MCD among immunocompromised patients such as those positive for human immunodeficiency virus. Although HHV8-negative MCD was reported in immunocompetent patients, the underlying etiology remains unknown. Several experts speculate that MCD in immunocompetent patients might be due to proinflammatory hypercytokinemia because of infection by a virus other than HHV8, inflammation, or neoplastic disease. In 2010, a distinct variant of HHV8-negative MCD reported in Japan was characterized by thrombocytopenia, anasarca, myelofibrosis, renal dysfunction, and organomegaly (TAFRO). Recent case reports and a systematic review suggest that TAFRO syndrome might have a unique pathogenesis among HHV8-negative MCD variants. This review introduces TAFRO syndrome as a subtype of HHV8-negative MCD and offers an overview of the current perspectives on this syndrome.\n\nMulticentric squamous cell carcinona in a paca (Agouti paca) resembling Bowen's disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nLuppi, Marcela M; Malta, Marcelo C C; Costa, Maria E L T; Motta, Rafael O C; Santos, Renato L\n\n2008-06-01\n\nAn 8-yr-old female paca (Agouti paca) was admitted at the Veterinary Hospital of the Belo Horizonte Zoo (Brazil) with an ulcerated cutaneous nodule of approximately 1.5 cm in diameter in the left ear.

All cutaneous nodules were histologically similar with features of squamous cell carcinoma. Considering the predominant in situ nature of the lesion as well as its multicentric localization, the disease reported here closely resembles Bowen's disease, which has been described in humans and which has been identified as a rare neoplastic disease of cats, with one single report in a dog.

Thrombocytopenia and severe anasarca accompanied by relatively low serum immunoglobulin levels are characteristic clinical findings of TAFRO syndrome that are not present in iMCD-not otherwise specified (iMCD-NOS). Lymph node biopsy is recommended to exclude other diseases and to diagnose TAFRO syndrome, which reveals characteristic histopathological findings similar to hyaline vascular-type CD. TAFRO syndrome follows a more aggressive course, compared with iMCD-NOS, and there is no standard treatment. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, studies investigating this have been predominantly single-centre. As clinical trials are likely to be multisite, further studies are required to determine whether associations with cognition of similar strengths can be detected in a multicentre setting. One hundred and nine patients (mean age =68 years) with symptomatic lacunar infarction and confluent white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on MRI was recruited across six sites as part of the PRESERVE DTI substudy. After handling missing data, 3T-MRI scanning was available from five sites on five scanner models (Siemens and Philips), alongside neuropsychological and quality of life (QoL) assessments. FA median and MD peak height were extracted from DTI histogram analysis. Multiple linear regressions were performed, including normalized brain volume, WMH lesion load, and nÂ° lacunes as covariates, to investigate the association of FA and MD with cognition and QoL. DTI metrics from all white matter were significantly associated with global cognition (standardized Î² =0.268), mental flexibility (Î² =0.306), verbal fluency (Î² =0.376), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (Î² =0.273). The magnitudes of these associations were comparable with those previously reported from single-centre studies found in a systematic literature review. In this multicentre study, we confirmed associations between DTI parameters and cognition, which were similar in strength to those found in previous single-centre studies. The present study supports the use of DTI metrics as biomarkers of disease progression in multicentre studies.

The objective of this study is to clarify the differences in characteristics and identify a clinically useful approach to differentiate these two diseases. Methods Forty-five consecutive patients with untreated active IgG4-RD and 33 patients with MCD were included in this study, who visited our institution from January 2000 to August 2016. The clinical and laboratory findings for the patients of the two diseases were compared. Various combinations of the distinctive findings were evaluated to identify the most efficient differentiating features between IgG4-RD and MCD. Results The levels of serum IgG4 were not different between the two diseases. Orbits, lacrimal glands, salivary glands or pancreas were involved in 88.9% of IgG4-RD cases and only in 3.0% of MCD cases. All MCD cases involved lymph nodes. Atopic history was characteristic for IgG4-RD. The levels of C reactive protein (CRP) with a cut-off of 0.80 mg/dL and IgA with a cut-off of 330 mg/dL were the most distinctive. The combination of âOrbits, lacrimal glands, salivary glands or pancreas involvement, atopic history, or non-involvement of lymph nodeâ and âCRP â¤ 0.8 mg/dL or IgA â¤ 330 mg/dLâ yielded the probability of 97.8% in IgG4-RD, while that of 3.0 % in patients with MCD. Conclusions Our study revealed distinct features between IgG4-RD and MCD. Differentiating between the diseases based on those distinct features, including distribution of organ involvement, atopic history, levels of IgA and CRP, was a useful approach.

However, the feasibility of multicentre standardisation remains unknown. To determine the feasibility of multicentre standardisation of chest MRI in infants and preschool children with CF. A standardised chest 1.5â¯T MRI protocol was implemented across four specialised CF centres. Following training and initiation visits, 42 infants and preschool children (mean age 3.2â¯Â±â¯1.5â¯years, range 0-6â¯years) with clinically stable CF underwent MRI and chest X-ray (CXR). Image quality and lung abnormalities were assessed using a standardised questionnaire and an established CF MRI and CXR score. MRI was successfully performed with diagnostic quality in all patients (100%). Incomplete lung coverage was observed in 6% and artefacts also in 6% of sequence acquisitions, but these were compensated by remaining sequences in all patients. The range of the MRI score in CF patients was similar across centres with a mean global MRI score of 13.3â¯Â±â¯5.8. Cross-validation of the MRI against the CXR score revealed a moderate correlation (râ¯=â¯0.43-0.50, pâ¯<â¯0.01). Our results demonstrate that multicentre standardisation of chest MRI is feasible and support its use as radiation-free outcome measure of lung disease in infants and preschool children with CF.

Unlike other human herpesviruses (herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, HHV-6, and HHV-7), it is not widespread in the general population and has many unique proteins. HHV-8 is strongly associated with all subtypes of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), multicentric Castleman's disease, and a rare form of B-cell lymphoma, primary effusion lymphoma. In addition, HHV-8 DNA sequences have been found in association with other diseases, but the role of the virus in these diseases is largely unconfirmed and remains controversial. The seroprevalence of HHV-8, based on detection of latent and lytic proteins, is 2 to 5% in healthy donors except in certain geographic areas where the virus is endemic, 80 to 95% in classic KS patients, and 40 to 50% in HIV-1 patients without KS. This virus can be transmitted both sexually and through body fluids (e.g., saliva and blood). HHV-8 is a transforming virus, as evidenced by its presence in human malignancies, by the in vitro transforming properties of several of its viral genes, and by its ability to transform some primary cells in culture. It is not, however, sufficient for transformation, and other cofactors such as immunosuppressive cytokines are involved in the development of HHV-8-associated malignancies. In this article, we review the biology, molecular virology, epidemiology, transmission, detection methods, pathogenesis, and antiviral therapy of this newly discovered human herpesvirus.

Clinical features and association with human papillomavirus and herpes simplex virus.\n\nPubMed\n\nBornstein, J; Kaufman, R H; Adam, E; Adler-Storthz, K\n\n1988-10-15\n\nSixteen of 46 patients (35%) with Grade 3 vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN 3) were found to have an additional site of lower genital tract squamous cell neoplasia, primarily in the cervix. The frequency of multicentricity decreased significantly with age. In addition, patients with multicentric disease (involving the vagina and/or cervix in addition to the vulva) had a significantly higher frequency of multifocal disease involving the vulva (involving more than one location on the vulva) and of recurrence than patients without multicentric disease. Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA was detected by in situ hybridization in 81% of the women with multicentric squamous cell neoplasia. No significant difference was noticed between patients with multicentric and unicentric squamous cell neoplasia in the detection rate of papillomavirus antigen, HPV DNA, the various HPV types, herpes simplex virus Type 2 (HSV2)-related antigen, type-specific antibodies to HSV, and dual HPV and HSV2 infections. These findings suggest that HPV and HSV2, although strongly associated with VIN 3, do not influence the development pattern of squamous cell neoplasia, and that all patients with VIN 3, especially if they are younger than 50 years of age, should be evaluated periodically for additional centers of lower genital tract squamous cell neoplasia.\n\nValue of serum IgG4 in the diagnosis of IgG4-related disease and in differentiation from rheumatic diseases and other diseases.\n\nPubMed\n\nYamamoto, Motohisa; Tabeya, Tetsuya; Naishiro, Yasuyoshi; Yajima, Hidetaka; Ishigami, Keisuke; Shimizu, Yui; Obara, Mikiko; Suzuki, Chisako; Yamashita, Kentaro; Yamamoto, Hiroyuki; Hayashi, Toshiaki; Sasaki, Shigeru; Sugaya, Toshiaki; Ishida, Tadao; Takano, Ken-Ichi; Himi, Tetsuo; Suzuki, Yasuo; Nishimoto, Norihiro; Honda, Saho; Takahashi, Hiroki; Imai, Kohzoh; Shinomura, Yasuhisa\n\n2012-06-01\n\nIgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a novel disease entity that includes Mikulicz's disease, autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), and many other conditions. It is characterized by elevated serum IgG4 levels and abundant IgG4-bearing plasmacyte infiltration of involved organs. We postulated that high levels of serum IgG4 would comprise a useful diagnostic tool, but little information is available about IgG4 in conditions other than IgG4-RD, including rheumatic diseases. Several reports have described cutoff values for serum IgG4 when diagnosing IgG4-RD, but these studies mostly used 135 mg/dL in AIP to differentiate from pancreatic cancer instead of rheumatic and other common diseases. There is no evidence for a cutoff serum IgG4 level of 135 mg/dL for rheumatic diseases and common diseases that are often complicated with rheumatic diseases. The aim of this work was to re-evaluate the usual cutoff serum IgG4 value in AIP (135 mg/dL) that is used to diagnose whole IgG4-RD in the setting of a rheumatic clinic by measuring serum IgG4 levels in IgG4-RD and various disorders. We therefore constructed ROC curves of serum IgG4 levels in 418 patients who attended Sapporo Medical University Hospital due to IgG4-RD and various rheumatic and common disorders. The optimal cut-off value of serum IgG4 for a diagnosis of IgG4-RD was 144 mg/dL, and the sensitivity and specificity were 95.10 and 90.76%, respectively. Levels of serum IgG4 were elevated in IgG4-RD, Churg-Strauss syndrome, multicentric Castleman's disease, eosinophilic disorders, and in some patients with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, chronic hepatitis, and liver cirrhosis. The usual cut-off value of 135 mg/dL in AIP is useful for diagnosing whole IgG4-RD, but high levels of serum IgG4 are sometimes observed in not only IgG4-RD but also other rheumatic and common diseases.\n\nThoracic Diseases Associated with HIV Infection in the Era of Antiretroviral Therapy: Clinical and Imaging Findings\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPrabhu, Somnath J.; Crothers, Kristina; Stern, Eric J.; Godwin, J. David; Pipavath, Sudhakar N.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic has entered its 4th decade. Since the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 1996, the number of AIDS-related deaths has plateaued worldwide. Today, owing to the effectiveness of ART, the HIV-infected population is aging and HIV infection has become a chronic illness. Non-AIDS comorbidities are increasing, and the spectrum of HIV-related thoracic diseases is evolving. In developed countries, bacterial pneumonia has become more common than Pneumocystis pneumonia. Its imaging appearance depends on the responsible organism, most commonly Streptococcus pneumoniae. Mycobacterium tuberculosis continues to be a major threat. Its imaging patterns vary depending on CD4 count. Primary lung cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma are two important nonâAIDS-defining malignancies that are increasingly encountered at chest imaging. Human herpesvirus 8, also known as Kaposi sarcomaâassociated herpesvirus (KSHV), is strongly linked to HIV-related diseases, including Kaposi sarcoma, multicentric Castleman disease, KSHV inflammatory cytokine syndrome, and primary effusion lymphoma. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is a direct complication of ART whose manifestations vary with the underlying disease. Given the high rate of smoking among HIV-infected patients, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is another important cause of morbidity and mortality. A high degree of suspicion is required for the early diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, given their nonspecific manifestations. Finally, multilocular thymic cyst manifests as a cystic anterior mediastinal mass. Recognition of the clinical and radiologic manifestations of these less traditional HIV-related diseases can expedite diagnosis and treatment in the ART era.

In contrast to that in multicentric Castleman disease, interleukin-6 targeting strategies seem ineffective in some TAFRO syndrome cases; however, the optimal treatment remains unclear. Here, we report 2 cases of TAFRO syndrome, where 1 with cardiomyopathy, successfully treated with tacrolimus. This is the first case report of successful treatment with tacrolimus in TAFRO syndrome. Both patients (cases 1 and 2) developed fever, anasarca, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction, and mild hepatosplenomegaly. In both patients, lymph node pathology revealed mixed type Castleman disease-like features, and bone marrow showed reticulin myelofibrosis. TAFRO syndrome was diagnosed based on the patients' laboratory, clinical, and pathologic findings. In case 2, we observed a rare complication of cardiomyopathy with no evidence of takotsubo cardiomyopathy or viral myocarditis. In case 1, tocilizumab combined with glucocorticoids was ineffective and caused septic shock; additionally, cyclosporine A was discontinued because of hepatotoxicity. However, tacrolimus was effective in resolving TAFRO syndrome without any adverse events. In case 2, tacrolimus completely reversed TAFRO syndrome and was also effective in cardiomyopathy. This report suggests that tacrolimus is potentially effective and safe as an initial treatment and a glucocorticoid-sparing agent. Our literature review shows that calcineurin inhibitors, including tacrolimus, may be effective in TAFRO syndrome. Since previous studies indicate a role of Th1 inflammation in TAFRO syndrome pathogenesis, tacrolimus may, therefore, be effective in treating TAFRO syndrome.\n\nMulticentric myelolipoma in a dog.\n\nPubMed\n\nKamiie, Junichi; Fueki, Keisuke; Amagai, Harumi; Ichikawa, Youichiro; Shirota, Kinji\n\n2009-03-01\n\nWe report herein a case of multicentric myelolipoma in an 11-year-old beagle dog that presented with vomiting. Laparotomy demonstrated the presence of a large mass adherent to the greater omentum and multiple small white maculae in the spleen. Cytological and histological examinations revealed that the mass and maculae comprised mature adipocytes and hematopoietic elements including granulocytic, erythrocytic and megakaryocytic series in several phases of maturation and macrophages containing hemosiderin deposits, resembling bone marrow. Multicentric myelolipoma was diagnosed. This is first report of multicentric myelolipoma in a dog.\n\nESPGHAN 2012 Guidelines for Coeliac Disease Diagnosis: Validation Through a Retrospective Spanish Multicentric Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nDonat, Ester; Ramos, Jose M; SÃ¡nchez-Valverde, FÃ©lix; Moreno, Ana; Martinez, Maria-Jose; Leis, Rosaura; PeÃ±a-Quintana, Luis; Castillejo, Gemma; FernÃ¡ndez, Sonia; Garcia, ZuriÃ±e; Ortigosa, Luis; Balmaseda, Elena; MarugÃ¡n, JosÃ©-Manuel; Eizaguirre, Francisco-Javier; Lorenzo, Helena; Barrio, Josefa; Ribes-Koninckx, Carmen\n\n2016-02-01\n\nA large retrospective multicentre study was conducted in Spain to evaluate the efficiency of the new European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) criteria for the diagnosis of coeliac disease (CD). The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Hospital Universitari i PolitÃ¨cnic La Fe (Valencia, Spain). The present study included 2177 children (ages 0.6-15.9 years) with small bowel biopsy (SBB) performed for diagnostic purposes (from 2000 to 2009) and with a minimum 2-year follow-up after biopsy. CD was diagnosed in 2126 patients (97.5%) and excluded in 51 (2.5%). Tissue transglutaminase antibodies (TG2A), anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA), and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) were reported in 751 patients, 640 symptomatic and 111 asymptomatic. TG2A levels >10 times the upper limit of normal, plus positive EMA and HLA DQ2 and/or DQ8 haplotypes, were found in 336 symptomatic patients, all of them with final diagnosis of CD. In 65 of 69 asymptomatic patients, 65 had confirmed CD and 4 did not have CD. According to the 2012 ESPGHAN guidelines, SBB may have been omitted in 52% of the symptomatic patients with CD with serologic and HLA available data. Gluten challenge was performed in 158 children, 75 of them <2 years at first biopsy. Only 1 patient in whom according to the new proposed diagnostic criteria gluten challenge would not have been mandatory did not relapse. Our results support the new ESPGHAN 2012 guidelines for diagnosis of CD can be safely used without the risk of overdiagnosis. A prospective multicentre study is needed to confirm our results.\n\nManaging multicentre clinical trials with open source.\n\nPubMed\n\nRaptis, Dimitri Aristotle; Mettler, Tobias; Fischer, Michael Alexander; Patak, Michael; Lesurtel, Mickael; Eshmuminov, Dilmurodjon; de Rougemont, Olivier; Graf, Rolf; Clavien, Pierre-Alain; Breitenstein, Stefan\n\n2014-03-01\n\nMulticentre clinical trials are challenged by high administrative burden, data management pitfalls and costs. This leads to a reduced enthusiasm and commitment of the physicians involved and thus to a reluctance in conducting multicentre clinical trials. The purpose of this study was to develop a web-based open source platform to support a multi-centre clinical trial. We developed on Drupal, an open source software distributed under the terms of the General Public License, a web-based, multi-centre clinical trial management system with the des"
