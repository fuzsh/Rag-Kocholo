Countless films have been produced that have either directly adapted material and texts to the screen, or have more elusively appropriated them. Adaptations still make up a large percentage of films created in Hollywood, the independent sector, and as part of global cinema. There is a certain sense of familiarity to spectators of these works, whether they are drawn from Shakespeare, Jane Austen, or Stephen King. Adaptation studies has become an increasingly rich field of research and inquiry over the past 40 years but has gained a bit more credibility more recently. George Bluestone’s Novels into Film (1957) was the first of its kind, and since its publication, there have been varied studies of the process, theory, and practice of adaptation. Adaptation studies straddles both film and literary studies, making it unique to a wide range of scholars. While a great many of the books on adaptation are beneficial to understanding it as a filmic conversion of previous texts, there have been no studies, or rarely, any mentions of avant-garde films that are based on previous sources. Hence, this book seeks to fill the gap and offer an introduction to avant-garde film adaptation. Avant-garde and experimental film is a vibrant and significant part of film history, culture, and society. Avant-garde films historically have ideological and political overtones, are formally innovative, are distinctively individualistic, and approach subjects both familiar and odd with a verve and spirit often absent from the mainstream. Avant-garde filmmakers also have adapted a variety of texts to the screen, and this book serves as an introduction to the practice of adaptation in the world of avant-garde cinema. Much like any Hollywood adaptation, an avant-garde adaptation chooses and selects material that provides interesting stories. But avantgarde films also bear the emblem of creativity, personal vision, formal innovation, and experimentation, sometimes rendering the source material unrecognizable, transfigured, or extraneous. Generally speaking, most\n\n9781441163523_int_Finals_txt_print.indd 1\n\n8/12/2011 4:09:17 PM\n\n2\n\nAdaptation and the Avant-Garde\n\nmainstream adaptations do not try to exploit the source material like avant-garde adaptations. In avant-garde adaptation, more risks are taken in terms of narration, spatial and temporal location, form and style, and visual and aural representation, and in most cases, fidelity is not an issue. Avant-garde and experimental film offers a wide resource for understanding the cinematic medium as an aesthetic process and product, much more so, I believe, than mainstream film. The intimacy, creativity, and subjectivity of avant-garde filmmakers and the formal processes at work provide ways into understanding vision, spectatorship, narrativity, and formal production in ways that are different from and beyond more conventional films and filmmaking. This is not to denigrate largerbudgeted films or filmmakers who choose to adapt books or other texts with fidelity (or box office receipts) in mind; rather, it seems that avantgarde films have been relegated to the margins for so long that any mention of them as cultural artifacts usually means they are shunned and misunderstood by too many, while embraced and promoted only by cinephiles, museums, or scholars. Hollywood will always “win out” over the avant-garde, but one of the aims of this study is to suggest how avantgarde films and avant-garde adaptations, in particular, are far more nuanced works of cinematic art versus popular cultural artifacts. While the most successful kinds of adaptation, and by successful I mean those that are produced by studio financing, like the Harry Potter franchise or the Lord of the Rings trilogy, will always garner popular favor, avant-garde adaptations exist in a kind of nether region where production, distribution, and exhibition are tenuous and financing is haphazard. But there is something entirely unique about a film adaptation that is liberated from both the text(s) it adapts and the dictates of the studios. The structure of the book is threefold: Part I offers an overview of adaptation theory and criticism; a working definition of avant-garde as it applies to film; a defense of avant-garde adaptation; a suggestion for a particular type of adaptation associated with avant-garde film, exploitation; and a section addressing appropriation as an adaptive practice. Part II is a brief chronological narrative of avant-garde adaptation. In part, this section is simply meant to provide an overview of the filmmaking climate during each decade of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, highlighting tendencies of both mainstream and alternative film practice. It is not exhaustive. I mention at least one (and sometimes more) avant-garde adaptation per decade since the beginnings of cinematic practice to showcase certain films, filmmakers, and adaptations that were working with previous source materials yet adapting them in unusual or\n\n9781441163523_int_Finals_txt_print.indd 2\n\n8/12/2011 4:09:17 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nidiosyncratic ways. Part III offers case studies, in-depth examinations of different avant-garde adaptations. I analyze the films in terms of their styles, themes, and forms and provide commentary on their methods of adaptation. I examine adaptations based on familiar texts (Alice in Wonderland, The Tempest), and less familiar ones (Wisconsin Death Trip, Street of Crocodiles) and their subsequent film adaptations, in order to show the wide range of avant-garde adaptation practice in cinema. Overall, this study is an introduction to the theory and practice of avantgarde adaptation. My goal is to provide a starting point for considering avant-garde adaptations as viable texts worthy of examining in film studies, literary studies, cultural studies, and adaptation studies. Studying avant-garde film opens up many doors; knowing the history of avantgarde film, its influential directors, and certain adaptations provides ways of rethinking film culture and adaptations in general. One of the arguments I make is for a more pronounced kind of adaptation that is willing to take risks and eschew standards, which avant-garde and experimental film does uniformly and unabashedly. There have been a handful of intelligent studies of avant-garde cinema. The works of P. Adams Sitney and Scott MacDonald, in particular, have shaped the discourse within the field. There have also been some very good studies of adaptation theory and practice. These scholars, including Thomas Leitch, Linda Hutcheon, Brian McFarlane, and James Welsh, have provided insight into this area of film/literary studies and have provided certain templates for analyzing the processes involved in transferring a source text to the screen. My goal with this book is to bring the two fields together in dialogue, in the hope of generating interest in avantgarde filmmaking by way of adaptation studies. Avant-garde adaptation has been a rather neglected area of film studies, so my wish is that this book provides some general understanding of the practice and theory of avant-garde filmmaking through a discussion of several avant-garde film adaptations. Not every film I describe may be traditionally considered an adaptation, nor will every filmmaker I mention be categorized as avantgarde by other scholars. Still, the methods they choose to adapt previous texts points to a specific tendency that makes the adaptation avant-garde, hence, I describe it as such. There really is not true methodology for adaptation. I believe that taking liberties, even extreme measures, when adapting a previous source yields a new text that can achieve a high level of artistic achievement. I hope to shed some light on this with the films I describe, and an unorthodox, idiosyncratic approach to adaptation, which occurs in avant-garde film, seems most appropriate.\n\n9781441163523_int_Finals_txt_print.indd 3\n\n8/12/2011 4:09:17 PM\n\n9781441163523_int_Finals_txt_print.indd 4\n\n8/12/2011 4:09:17 PM\n\nChapter 1\n\nDefining the Avant-Garde Film\n\nAvant-garde films are not always easy to define in an all-inclusive manner, but they are typically recognized by cineastes and even average spectators because of their very nature of being “different.” Experimental and avant-garde films do not necessarily comprise a large, coherent genre of their own (even though the avant-garde can be called a genre), because they are so diverse; rather, they tend to rework genres in new ways, playing with tropes and subverting or undermining traits, characteristics, or expectations. Additionally, avant-garde films disrupt narrative continuity by often presenting a nonlinear plot. Characterization may or may not be important to the particular film, but almost all avant-garde films have to do with perception, or how one sees things, and so they establish new parameters for defining and emphasizing the representation of vision and subjectivity. Avant-garde films also explore the possibilities of film language, seeking to break from traditional methods of using miseen-scène, cinematography, editing, or sound. In this way, avant-garde film tends to challenge, destabilize, or distort prevailing discourses on cinema, cinema theory, and cinema history. Tracing the history of the avant-garde film, for example, leads one on both tangential and radically alternative paths that sometimes cross with the mainstream but more often than not create their own culturally and socially significant avenues of exploration, as oppositions to the norm/mainstream. Still, as Dudley Andrew asserts, “In laboring to thwart the normal ‘way of the cinema,’ the radically avant-garde film draws attention to the strength and ubiquity of that ‘way.’ ”1 In other words, typical audiences find themselves seeking normalcy when confronted with the avant-garde. Defining an avant-garde film is not impossible, but some of the characteristics mentioned imply that there is a clear-cut way to label, classify, or catalog them depending on their specific attributes or characteristics. For instance, there are film poems, “trance” films, structural films, and abstract or graphic films. Most of these descriptions come from P. Adams Sitney’s\n\n9781441163523_ch01_Finals_txt_print.indd 7\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:53 PM\n\n8\n\nAdaptation and the Avant-Garde\n\nmonumental and irreplaceable Visionary Film, but Sitney, too, is weary of the label avant-garde. In the preface to the first edition of the book, he writes, “‘Avant-garde’ in itself is unfortunate [as a label.] On the one hand it implies a privileged relationship to a norm which I do not wish to affirm, and on the other hand it has been used to describe thousands of films which fall outside the scope of this book . . .”2 This is still very true today. However, it seems that using avant-garde as a descriptive category of filmmaking can be advantageous because it suggests an alternative form of communicating meaning, as opposed to the more customary form found in multiplexes. Rightfully so, though, there are far too many avant-garde films produced to ever fully be accounted for, and many are bad. Also, Sitney’s categories of avant-garde film allow for like-minded filmmakers to be aligned into one group, for example, “visionary.” Another well-known critic and scholar of avant-garde film, Fred Camper, delineates six “qualities” to “naming and defining avant-garde or experimental film.” Camper suggests not all six need to be present in any one given film. They include, and I paraphrase: (1) a film made by one person or occasionally a small group of like-minded people using his or her or their own money; (2) the films avoid assembly-line production, like most mainstream films; (3) they typically do not offer linear stories; (4) they focus very clearly on film form, the “materials of cinema”; (5) they are in opposition to mass media and mainstream culture; and (6) they offer various messages, not a clear “univalent” (or singular) one. Camper concludes by saying, “I don’t propose any mechanical method whereby meeting, say, five of the six automatically qualifies a film, but rather suggest that considering these characteristics might be useful in thinking about this body of work”3 Camper’s six qualities (and he also calls them a “six-part test”) offer many ways to discuss or “test” the inherent traits of avant-garde film. All things considered, discovering a quick, easy, all-encompassing definition for avant-garde films is nonexistent. But they are recognizable, as are avant-garde adaptations. Nearly all avant-garde films offer ways to comprehend reality in unconventional yet meaningful ways. The avant-garde is artistically ambitious; filmmakers working in this realm pay little attention to convention and instead maintain a rigorous devotion to their own aesthetic, political, or critical vision. Avant-garde denotes a historical moment of specific activities and practices not necessarily associated with any particular artistic style or strategy. The avant-garde advances new techniques, forms of expression, and subject matter, existing outside the “culture industry” and showcasing a heightened awareness of the trappings of commercial art. The avant-garde, which encompasses most artistic forms (painting,\n\n9781441163523_ch01_Finals_txt_print.indd 8\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:53 PM\n\nDefining the Avant-Garde Film\n\n9\n\nmusic, and literature, for instance) or at least is aware of other artistic forms, either challenges the understandings of contemporary art or uses the other arts in the filmmaking process, seeking equivalents in signs, codes, or language. The avant-garde is a “personalized, noncommercial, non-narrative, and reductive use of the medium that, in most cases, is related to other art forms, such as painting, music, or poetry.”4 This relationship immediately sets the avant-garde apart from the mainstream, simply because the avant-garde filmmaker is far more interested in attaining a highly individual vision akin to a poet, painter, or composer, working in opposition to classical narrative cinema and “privileging the personal over the pecuniary.”5 The avant-garde has routinely been defined as either a collective group of like-minded filmmakers or as lone artists working in remote corners of the film industry (but shunning the industry). Sometimes, avant-garde directors bring more attention to social problems that hamper human endeavor, but their rationale for making films is not typically overtly political. The avant-garde also has been described as a forward-looking practice and art—one that clearly see the future of the medium. The avant-garde started as a more politically minded creative output, seeking to disrupt the bourgeois idea of art. Matei Calinescu, in his still useful book, Five Faces of Modernity, does a fine job tracing the history of the avant-garde, from its origins as a politically oppositional term in the early nineteenth century to its use in the twentieth century as a kind of artistic practice. The avant-garde artist, for example, is similar to the romantic poet, a characteristic that expert avant-garde critic P. Adams Sitney has also outlined, or, as Calinescu says, “The idea that poets are endowed with visionary powers, that they are indeed ‘mirrors of futurity,’ and as such in advance of their time, was shared by many progressive-minded romantics,” which in turn describes the type of art the avant-gardist creates—advanced or ahead of its time.6 The origin of the term avant-garde is martial. It describes the “advanced guard” that led the troops into battle—they were “in the lead” or “in front of” the rest, hence, the connotative use of avant-garde to imply a futuristic movement and thus perhaps its application to politics. Not every avant-garde filmmaker is interested in politics or ideology, however, and most are not. However, because the term derives from the military, there are specific connotations that cross to the practice of film. As Calinescu points out, The obvious military implications of the concept point quite aptly toward some attitudes and trends for which the avant-garde is directly\n\n9781441163523_ch01_Finals_txt_print.indd 9\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:53 PM\n\n10\n\nAdaptation and the Avant-Garde\n\nindebted to the broader consciousness of modernity—a sharp sense of militancy, praise for nonconformism, courageous precursory exploration, and, on a more general plane, confidence in the final victory of time and immanence over traditions that try to appear as eternal, immutable, and transcendentally determined.7 All of these categories of defiance can describe avant-garde filmmakers, even though Calinescu is talking more broadly about the artistic avant-garde and its relationship to modernity, a term that implies progress, creativity, and inevitable advancement. Avant-garde film and having an avant-garde attitude, especially in terms of other art forms, are not necessarily the same thing. However, many filmmakers adopt an avant-garde attitude or, more appropriately, an avant-garde aesthetic or approach when making decisions. As Andras Balint Kovacs points out, “The important difference between what is commonly called the avantgarde/experimental movements in film and the avant-garde of fine arts is that the former is not a typically political movement.”8 Furthermore, “Avant-garde/experimental/underground cinema is a specific cinematic practice that may or may not include a political component. It differs from classical cinema as well as from modernist art cinema precisely by virtue of its practice.”9 The distinction between politically motivated art and artistically driven film is important because it allows us to examine the film itself on its own terms, without seeking a specific ideological agenda to determine its meaning(s) or value as a film or film adaptation. Artists who stand at the forefront of new ideas, ones that are innovative or experimental, help distinguish the avant-garde filmmaker. The avant-garde film makes cognizant use of the materials of cinema, normally sidestepping linear stories in favor of either abstract or nonlinear stories—if a story is even part of its narrative structure. Many times, the avant-garde filmmaker works as more than just the director: He or she is also the scriptwriter, perhaps the editor or cinematographer, or the producer. The films are often deliberately ambiguous, which in turn suggests they offer connotative, associative meanings for individual spectators. Kovacs also suggests, As a cinematic practice, avant-garde/underground/experimental filmmaking is always aimed at private, self-expressive use of the cinema. It is the laboratory of the audio-visual medium, a formal experiment more or less inspired by modern painting and literature, distributed in a noncommercial circuit, for a restricted audience. That is what always\n\n9781441163523_ch01_Finals_txt_print.indd 10\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:53 PM\n\nDefining the Avant-Garde Film\n\n11\n\naligns the avant-garde with the arts and literature. It rejects cinema as a commercial institution but affirms it as a personal form of artistic expression whereby all kinds of artistic trends and movements can find their way to the cinema.10 The cinema has the capacity to be an amalgam of all the arts, an argument articulated in the silent era by many practitioners such as Eisenstein, and therefore it can best represent the importance of the individual in creating a new form of representation and “artistic expression,” as Kovacs suggests. Whether or not avant-garde film is “inspired by modern painting and literature” is true—it remains an argument—it can be said that certain avant-garde films interact with modernist forms of art, hence Kovacs’s assertion. This is important to consider when taking into account adaptations, since, as I will outline later, the better kinds of adaptations always acknowledge their interactions and conflicts with the source text or a variety of sources. The avant-garde filmmaker makes films for self-expressive use, and he or she almost always explicitly makes use of film form to showcase themes or has such a unique yet recognizable vision that his or her style becomes a focal point for discussion. These both aid in identifying and distinguishing certain adaptations made by avant-garde filmmakers. Avant-garde films often juxtapose realist and antirealist aesthetics or forms, challenge the spectator’s subjectivity, address issues concerning the unconscious, and openly concentrate on film form. Editing, cinematography, and sound combine in unique ways to create particular visions of the filmmaker, with the deliberate overturning of genre or the subversion of generic tropes, the employment of dissociative images and narrative constructs, or the thwarting of spectator omniscience. Because of these characteristics, avant-garde film adaptations arguably are more creative than mainstream productions. Avant-garde films can disrupt narrative time and space, creating temporal and spatial disorientation for spectators through a variety of means, such as “shifts from diegetic continuity to discontinuity, fast editing, disruptions of conventional transitional shots, disorienting shots through unmatched shots or a simultaneous representation of a multiplicity of perspectives.”11 Avant-garde films have to do with perception, and the way filmmakers decide to construct the film both in style and form plays a large role in how the spectator reacts to the film. Andrew has noted, “Avant-garde filmmakers over the years have disrupted the codes of perception by altering the usual focus, framing, and even the speed and direction of visual recording.”12 The terms that\n\n9781441163523_ch01_Finals_txt_print.indd 11\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:53 PM\n\n12\n\nAdaptation and the Avant-Garde\n\ncharacterize descriptions of the avant-garde, such as disrupted or discontinuous, imply a deliberate attempt to challenge or thwart the more normal codes of mainstream cinema. These types of films offer alternatives to the cinematic status quo. Classical narrative cinema features narrative comprehension and closure, realist styles, linear plots, clear identification of character motivation, and continuity editing. Avant-garde films may often bear some of these traits, but mostly they can be thought of as being created in direct opposition to and confrontation with these characteristics that dominate mainstream narrative film; “[i]t has always been the domain of experimental cinema to seek to disrupt [the] artificially enforced order” of mainstream cinema.13 Many avant-garde filmmakers view the mainstream as uninteresting or uninventive. Spectators alike see too many clichés and unimaginative elements in conventional cinema. The same can be applied to adaptations: why are there not enough film adaptations that embrace alternativeness? Why can there not be film adaptations that want to create difference? The purpose of my study is to answer these questions by examining the alternative film adaptations of avant-garde directors, which means exploring traditional discussions of adaptations differently—the same way one would discuss avant-garde films as being antithetical to mainstream productions. If “the function of the avant-garde, as the vanguard of autonomous bourgeois art, is to ensure that all cultural products that penetrate the realm of the bourgeoisie are rendered superfluous,” then film adaptations that welcome interpretive creativity serve a similar purpose: to render those forms of mainstream art to the wayside, in order to showcase the significance of avant-garde film and avant-garde art.14 According to Calinescu, “What the artists of the new avant-garde were interested in doing . . . was to overthrow all the binding formal traditions of art and to enjoy the exhilarating freedom of creativity.”15 This “new” avant-garde, which refers to the artists of the twentieth century, “believed that to revolutionize art was the same as to revolutionize life.”16 Avant-garde film breathes “new life” into the cinematic medium itself, and avant-garde adaptations revolutionize the way we can imagine how to transfer previous sources to the screen. Avant-garde film has been described as being wholly personal (the American avant-garde of the 1940s–60s), detailing abstract ideas or forms (the German avant-garde of the 1920s–30s), or addressing the formal characteristics of the medium (the French avant-garde of the 1920s–30s). All of these areas constitute specific historical occurrences of the avantgarde and are important in defining a coherent way of speaking about avant-garde film. Avant-garde film can be highly subjective by focusing\n\n9781441163523_ch01_Finals_txt_print.indd 12\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:53 PM\n\nDefining the Avant-Garde Film\n\n13\n\non the interior life of the director or of a character, and it can highlight its formal features, drawing our attention to its artifice by employing a scratched or painted filmstrip, using trick photography, or using techniques that are self-reflexive. This structuralist–materialist approach is considered more European, while the more “personal” cinema is associated with the American pioneers of the 1940s or the underground artists of the 1960s. In all its forms, the avant-garde forces us to notice the capabilities of the film medium. Within the realm of the avant-garde, anything is possible. The goal of many avant-garde films is to expand one’s vision. One of the fundamental questions that the avant-garde gives rise to is, What is it that you see when you are looking at something? Different ways of viewing reality or the presentation of the interior life dictates how one should approach an avant-garde film. The same applies to an adaptation: The spectator must be willing to suspend disbelief and any fidelity to the original and instead receive the new form of representation that the avant-garde adaptation offers. In describing the experimental cinema of the 1960s, which included underground and avant-garde film, Wheeler Winston Dixon suggests, “What was sought above all other considerations was a new way of apprehending the visual world,” and that “what was at stake was nothing less than the care of the soul.”17 Perhaps this is a grandiose statement, but the point is that these artists wanted to present new ways of comprehending the “visual world,” which suggests that they wanted to change or alter the way people already see or have been seeing the world. Additionally, it might be said these artists felt the need—a compulsion—to change the way people think about vision and perception. The avant-garde does not only challenge conventional aesthetic tastes, but it forces us to reexamine the fundamental precepts of perceiving reality as well. We also get the privilege of reconsidering our ideas and perceptions about what cinema can do. Avant-garde films can be lyrical or abstract, but they always serve as vehicles for the filmmaker’s vision. An avant-garde adaptation is a filmmaker’s unique interpretation of the original source material, whether literary, cultural, historical, or another artistic form. Avant-garde directors are truly visionary and iconoclastic, and they want to make films— and therefore adaptations—in a more personal manner. Their films are often described as “shocks” for the audience or deliberate “jabs” at passive spectators. In this sense, these directors are often deemed reactionary or confrontational—both positive words in the world of the avantgarde—and therefore seek to destroy through active creation. Calinescu cites Bakunin’s anarchist maxim, “To destroy is to create” as “actually\n\n9781441163523_ch01_Finals_txt_print.indd 13\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:53 PM\n\n14\n\nAdaptation and the Avant-Garde\n\napplicable to most of the activities of the twentieth century avant-garde.”18 Further, he states, “The avant-gardist, far from being interested in novelty as such, or in novelty in general, actually tries to discover or invent new forms, aspects, or possibilities of crisis.”19 This stress on crisis is relevant to avant-garde adaptations because they tend to force spectators and critics into crises of comparison, interpretation, and reevaluation. This is indeed a predicament or dilemma and not a regular problem to be solved. In this way, avant-garde films are points of departure for further discourse, instead of being films that are easily deciphered. Rather, these films are continuously explored and probed for meaning, which, in the case of adaptations, allows us to recognize that any given adapted text can yield multiple interpretations and ways of seeing. Avant-garde adaptations can mix the popular with the experimental, a point of contention for purists because many mainstream films have moments of “strangeness” in them, such as rapid montage, superimpositions, and abstract plot structures. But the avant-garde film does not use these techniques as gimmicks; rather, they are part of the aesthetic makeup of the typical avant-garde film and a unique weapon in the arsenal of the filmmaker. Working outside the institutional mode of filmmaking practices, the avant-gardist resists the economic or political pressures of the mainstream. Because these filmmakers are forward thinking and forward looking, the focus is on the work itself and not the “present rules” of filmmaking, and the artist works solely for him- or herself. Artworks that are part of the industrial or cultural world lose their vitality. According to Kovacs, “The avant-garde attacks artistic institutions on the premise that institutionalization confines art to its pure aesthetic dimension and isolates it from its social functions,” which suggests that the avant-garde work of art, such as a film, may have larger functions within the historical, social, and cultural milieu, rather than serving as a barometer for economic success.20 Avant-garde art forms spawn philosophical declarations and proclamations; in this regard, they serve purposes beyond that of their particular era. Avant-garde films can likewise attain long lives that carry historical and cultural significance in ways that continually provoke. Avant-garde adaptations also have the same influence; because they take unusual approaches to the practice of adaptation, they not only make us think but instruct us on the process itself.\n\n9781441163523_ch01_Finals_txt_print.indd 14\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:53 PM\n\nChapter 2\n\nAdaptation Theory and Practice\n\nIntroduction Most histories of the cinema account for adaptations of literary texts because they have been a practice since the origins of film. Still, the history of adaptation theory and practice and, particularly, the often contentious relationship between film and literature is rife with ambivalence and tenuous associations, conflicts and confrontations that belie a convinced degree of uncertainty. (Adaptation studies is predominately the study of novels to films, though there is a generous amount of scholarship on plays, such as those by William Shakespeare, and stories, such as those by Ernest Hemingway.) There is no overarching methodology to adaptations, and the multiple ways they are discussed can prove as limiting as they are revealing What I would like to do in this section is examine some of the discussions on adaptation theory and practice, not offering resolutions but making suggestions toward a greater perspective on avant-garde adaptations. As the cinema has become the most recognizable form of cultural and commercial consumption of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the idea of film as an inferior art to serious literature has become less arguable, if only because the majority of people from around the world can view and relate to a film, whereas they may not be able to read and relate to James Joyce’s Ulysses, for example. The cultural hierarchy that has generally placed literature over film has come under question, and I would suggest that in the area of avant-garde film, the question becomes moot. Avant-garde adaptations are as striking, original, confrontational, and artistic as the source material, often superseding it in terms of theme and style. Avant-garde films provoke the spectator, often to the point of acknowledging the film as the more original text—if a comparison needs to be drawn.\n\n9781441163523_ch02_Finals_txt_print.indd 15\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:57 PM\n\n16\n\nAdaptation and the Avant-Garde\n\nAs such, comparisons between novel and film dominate studies of adaptation histories and theoretical inquiries, but such analyses often prove limiting when considering avant-garde films. Avant-garde films have the capacity to retell stories with such imagistic force and visually stimulating actualization of human or abstract identity and meaning that one realizes literature merely describes. Still, this study is not aimed at comparing the original with the source but at delineating the finished adaptation, the film, with the multitude of cultural products that inspire it, which might include a novel but can also include other sources. Delineating the original from its source will provide a basis for interpreting avant-garde film adaptations as meaningful works of art in themselves. In other words, I do not wish to enter the debates over which is better, the source text or the film, but rather shed light on a unique area of film, literary, and cultural studies that will enable us to consider the way visionary directors choose to adapt material for their avant-garde films. If anything, what is discovered through comparison is the fact that avant-garde adaptations are far more intellectually and aesthetically challenging than their more mainstream counterparts, that is, perhaps, other adaptations of the same source. Even if the practice of adaptation has been around since the origins of cinema, many critics have rightly pointed out that there has been little serious discussion of adaptation theory until more recently. For example, James Naremore, in his introduction to Film Adaptation says, “The very subject of adaptation has constituted one of the most jejune areas of scholarly writing in the cinema.”1 Likewise, Thomas Leitch, in Film Adaptation and Its Discontents, spends time lamenting the “rupture” between film studies and literature based on a “privileging” of the novel over film.2 One reason for the speculative and inconclusive discourse on adaptation may be that the two artistic mediums, film and literature, while sharing similar features, are nonetheless separate mediums of expression and should be treated as such. Both literature and film can be discussed in terms of narration, style, character, tone, point of view, setting, and plot. Still, it is by these very nuances that film adaptation should and can be approached and breached in interesting ways, which means one should also consider connotations, imagery, metaphors, and symbols that either are present in the source material or are interpreted by the adapter and so are completely adequate for transferring or adding to the finished film. The discussions on film adaptations of literature too often focus on issues of fidelity and the comparison between novelistic and cinematic technique. This method results in prioritizing the fictional original over the resulting film. Thus, the purpose of comparison\n\n9781441163523_ch02_Finals_txt_print.indd 16\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:57 PM\n\nAdaptation Theory and Practice\n\n17\n\nbecomes the measurement of the success of the film. Typically, when contemporary film directors discuss their film adaptations of popular books, they generally say they want to remain faithful to the books so as not to alienate the audience. Avant-garde film adaptations do not follow this plan. But fidelity is only useful if the adapter seeks a faithful adaptation, which more often than not proves limiting; as Brian McFarlane has said, “Fidelity is obviously very desirable in marriage; but with film adaptations I suspect playing around is more effective.”3 Robert Stam has also argued against fidelity, suggesting, The shift from a single-track verbal medium such as the novel to a multitrack medium like film, which can play not only with words (written and spoken) but also with music, sound effects, and moving photographic images, explains the unlikelihood, and I would suggest even the undesirability, of literal fidelity.4 Searching for textual fidelity in the adapted film may be fun and part of the viewing process for some, but it limits the far-ranging aspects of adaptation that can and do occur. Fidelity critics often address issues concerning exactly what is transformed from one expressive medium to another by looking for equivalents for film language in verbal language. While this process yields some interesting and fruitful results, strictly confirming fidelity overlooks both intertextuality and critical interpretations by the filmmaker/adapter, which can enhance or at least expand the reading of the source text, whether it is a novel, biography, opera, or whatever that inspires the artist-as-adapter. As Leitch says, “Fidelity makes sense as a criterion of value only when we can be certain that the model is more valuable than the copy,” which is not the way one should practice adaptation studies.5 In short, adhering to fidelity criticism simply leaves one asking more questions rather then receiving satisfying results. This study of avant-garde adaptations will focus on the various forms that adaptations have taken or can take, specifically, that films based on prior material simply means the “material” itself can be derived from a variety of sources. Not all adaptations are based on literature. This goes without saying, but many adaptation studies focus on the interrelations between literature and film, while overlooking history or historical moments that have been adapted, biographical content that has been adapted, appropriations, or the intertextual, metatextual, or hypertextual levels that intersect during the adaptation process. I believe the better way of examining avant-garde adaptations is to consider them as exploitations, which\n\n9781441163523_ch02_Finals_txt_print.indd 17\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:57 PM\n\n18\n\nAdaptation and the Avant-Garde\n\nmeans certain films need to be examined in terms of how and what they (ab)use and render from the source text. Creating a new text (the film) from an original source text relies on certain distinct and interpretive choices that are made in the adaptation process. Studying adaptation as a form of exploitation provides various avenues to explore avant-garde film, since exploitative “translations” are forms of “repositionings” themselves. Translations convert, transform, render, and explain, and they also recast the language of medium into another. A translation of something written, a verbal text, to something visual, a film, “can be said to be an imitation, creative transposition, or an appropriation. All these words are synonyms for translation.”6 Avant-garde films exploit the prior text, which means they do not have to be the same as the original and therefore “transpose” ideas from the source or adapted text. Most would agree that translations are inherently created as points of comparison, but I would suggest the avant-garde adaptation does not have to rely on the kinds of comparisons that dictate whether or not the film is a “success” or not (in terms of faithfulness or economic return), mainly because these types of adaptations rely on other means, specifically, the exploitation of the adapted text. Because of this, the finished adaptation should be considered its own entity, one that might owe the source text a debt of gratitude, but one that essentially stands on its own.\n\nDefining Adaptation Much has been written about the theory and practice of film adaptation, especially as more film historians and theorists have devoted critical attention to it as a unique area of textual studies. Adaptation should itself be considered a discipline or at least a disciplinary act; adaptation is, inherently, the study of transcription, which is a form of translation, in the sense that one thing is being transformed into another. Certain methodologies of adaptation offer ways to discuss the process of transformation in either broad, generalized forms or in more approachable specific ways. Adaptations can “borrow” or “transfer,” as some of the typical descriptions go, but, more appropriately, they exploit ideas, image clusters, and sound patterns. Further, the best kind of film adaptation that translates the source text to the screen does so exploitatively in order to render an entirely new text that does not have to rely on issues of fidelity. An exploitative adaptation destroys and rebuilds, nullifies and re-creates networks of discursive patterns because new meanings and patterns of\n\n9781441163523_ch02_Finals_txt_print.indd 18\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:57 PM\n\nAdaptation Theory and Practice\n\n19\n\ndiscourse are formed through translation. Avant-garde films are precisely the kinds of texts that perform exploitative adaptations: they take advantage of, abuse, and re-create in order to present and represent the original material in ways that startle, confound, and satisfy spectators in startling ways. The avant-garde adaptation is the kind of film that stands on its own as an inspired form of adaptation, one that eschews fidelity to the original source(s) in order to make a more associative kind of interpretation. Linda Hutcheon’s useful book, A Theory of Adaptation, offers some interesting ways of thinking about adaptation. She advocates focusing on different “modes of engagement,” specifically “narrating, performing, and interacting,” as the best way of understanding the processes involved in transcribing one text to another, wherein telling (narrating), showing (performing), and engaging with the film (interacting) create the specific modes.7 Adaptations are, according to Hutcheon, “[a]n acknowledged transposition of a recognizable other work or works; a creative and interpretive act of appropriation/salvaging; [and] an extended intertextual engagement with the adapted work.”8 These three points aid in examining and critiquing an adapted film, and I believe her second point about creating and interpreting best suits the similar idea I have on avant-garde films and the exploitation of the original, adapted text. Avant-garde filmmakers are highly subjective in their representations of reality or any other phenomena or imagined time/space. The film adaptation created by the avant-garde filmmaker is always the representation of his/her subjective understanding of the literary (or other) source. Obviously any filmmaker makes choices during the adaptation process, but the avantgarde filmmaker interprets more than faithfully reproduces. While some may seek some correspondence between the source(s) and the adaptation, most think of the source(s) as material ready to be reshaped. There is not an inherent need to accurately transfer or translate the adapted text to the screen in a completely faithful manner, as is the case with most mainstream productions. Choices regarding mise-en-scène, for example, mean interpreting the original’s setting, its metaphors, or its visual description in an individual way. Thomas Leitch describes certain (non-avant-garde) directors as being antithetical to literary analysis; he suggests they “were important precisely because their defiantly antiliterary brand of cinema resisted assimilation into traditional canons of aesthetic value,” which I would carry over to almost every avant-garde filmmaker.9 Avant-garde filmmakers tend to be discussed in terms of poetics, but rarely are they embraced by literary schools of thought\n\n9781441163523_ch02_Finals_txt_print.indd 19\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:57 PM\n\n20\n\nAdaptation and the Avant-Garde\n\nfor their unique style and form; they tend to be on the outside looking in. Avant-garde filmmakers are bold, which offers “in some sense, a radical reworking of the precursor text, a kind of commentary on its great antecedent, a new work”10 As Hutcheon notes, “Visually-oriented filmmakers . . . can move from [a] single-track language to a multitrack medium and thereby not only make meaning possible on many levels but appeal to other physical senses as well.”11 Avant-garde films are synaesthetic experiences that engage spectators on a kinesthetic, visceral, and cognitive level, or, as Leitch suggests, all films “invoke not only visual codes but auditory codes, narrative codes, fictional codes, and a rhetoric of figuration.”12 Every reading of a source text, particularly a literary text, is a highly individual act that involves personal interpretation and imagination, so a finished adapted film also offers multiple, individual interpretations by the same individual readers. In this regard, there can never be a “true” adaptation; the material will always be exploited by the filmmaker/adapter and the spectator. Dudley Andrew distinguishes three relational modes between film and text: “borrowing, intersecting, and transformation,”13 wherein borrowing keeps the “material idea or form” of the original text, intersecting preserves the “uniqueness of the original to such an extent it is left unassimilated in the adaptation,” and transformation strictly relies on fidelity.14 Of these, intersecting still holds promise in terms of defining a certain type of adaptation. Andrew clarifies this mode, claiming, “Such works fear or refuse to adapt—instead they present the otherness and distinctiveness of the original text, initiating a dialectical interplay between the aesthetic forms of one period with the cinematic forms of another period.”15 Avant-garde filmmakers are either overtly or more subtly interested in reactionary relationships with the mainstream—the dialectical interplay that offers a competing or contentious means of expressing a film based on another text. (Of course, many avant-garde and experimental filmmakers also do not actively engage with the mainstream and instead operate completely in their own sphere.) What this also suggests is that a compromise is rarely reached; there is an ongoing dialogue between the film and the adapted text. The adapted source text is therefore something to be constantly interpreted, argued with, rewritten, and reproduced. As Peter Brooker suggests, “An adaptation may remove itself from its source text, edit or amplify a part of it, or transpose the whole, in a spirit of deference, homage, critique, opportunism, or indifference.”16 Avant-garde filmmakers remain authentic first to their visions, second to adapted texts.\n\n9781441163523_ch02_Finals_txt_print.indd 20\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:57 PM\n\nAdaptation Theory and Practice\n\n21\n\nAlmost all of the critical theory on adaptation addresses novels as the adapted texts. While the discourse on this subject is worthwhile for establishing what is useful for avant-garde adaptations, it is not exhaustive. George Bluestone’s foundational text, Novels into Film (1957), relies on “implicit metaphor of translation, which governs all investigations of how codes move across sign systems.”17 Bluestone’s book is effective at outlining ways of considering the relationship between literature and film, particularly when discussing perception, a key idea of avant-garde filmmakers, who rely on their own ways of seeing to portray worlds on film. Bluestone suggested that “the film, by arranging external signs for our visual perception, or by presenting us with dialogue, can lead us to infer thought.”18 In other words, the perceptual process of watching a film creates specific ways of seeing for the spectator, so that when considering an adaptation, an individual creates his/her own interpretation of the film without being overly concerned with the adapted text or at least being more concerned with individual visual perception based on interpretation or inference. Still, Bluestone’s approach—which has influenced many adaptation readings—focuses primarily on textual fidelity, or the search for the formal capabilities of both film and literature. Such a method overlooks far too many ways to investigate the relationship between sources and the film, including parody, pastiche, imitation, allusion—all specific intertextual instances that suggest how films exploit the adapted text. Intertextuality holds strong promise for considering adaptations, because the original text is only one facet of the film’s intertextuality. Using intertextuality to study adaptations, and particularly avant-garde adaptations, highlights the relations between the filmic text and source text without presupposing the hierarchal nature of literature over film, while delineating a more nuanced exchange between them, which ultimately adds to our understanding of both source and adaptation. While I do believe this method serves the purpose of examining the film and its adapted text, with avant-garde films, as previously mentioned, they become texts that are arguably more original, more unique, and more distinguished than the source. Often, these films bear little resemblance to the original, which both highlights the individuality of the adaptation but also may lead some back to the original inspiration for the film, a point of comparison perhaps but not one based on fidelity or commercial or critical success but rather on seeking out the means by which the adaptation has exploited the original source to such an extent that it warrants reevaluation and reexamination. If film, as Alexandre Astruc famously said, is “quite simply becoming a means of expression . . .\n\n9781441163523_ch02_Finals_txt_print.indd 21\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:58 PM\n\n22\n\nAdaptation and the Avant-Garde\n\ngradually becoming a language,” then naturally one may discuss adaptations in terms of their intertextuality.19 Leitch argues that intertextual studies will lead to greater literacy, that is, to a better understanding and knowledge of the contexts that give rise to adaptations and their subsequent contextual interpretations. This will allow adaptation studies to “dethrone English departments’ traditional emphasis on literature . . . [replacing] it with literacy, the study of the ways texts have been, might be, and should be read and rewritten.”20 The important concept here is that texts are rewritten during the adaptation process, which echoes the idea that the filmmaker interprets the original source in order to find something to translate to the screen. According to David Kranz, “Film adaptations can criticize aspects of [original] sources, debate their themes, and translate them into different cultures and times in ways which alter their meanings and effects, among other relational properties.”21 Avant-garde filmmakers actively seek difference and utilize the capacities of film itself to strengthen this difference. According to Robert Stam, The intertextuality of cinema is multitrack. The image track ‘inherits’ the history of painting and the visual arts, while the sound track ‘inherits’ the entire history of music, dialogue, and sound experimentation. Adaptation, in this sense, consists of amplifying the source text through these multiple intertexts.22 Because film can represent anything—reality, unreality, illusion, subjectivity—through its multiple tracks, it inherently is able to exploit anything, whether a novel, story, opera, picture, or historical moment. The cinema can transpose or translate anything to the screen in any variety imaginable, and in the world of the avant-garde, it is commonplace to seek alternatives. Hutcheon writes of adaptations as palimpsests, because in some fashion, “[p]alimpsests make for permanent change.”23 Additionally, she says, “As a creative and interpretive transposition of a recognizable other work or works, adaptation is a kind of extended palimpsest and, at the same time, often a transcoding into a different set of conventions.”24 The conventions of film include mise-en-scène, cinematography, sound, editing, and narrative. The multitrack nature of film and the ability of the camera to move and showcase temporal or spatial dimensions or dislocations expands our perceptions, perhaps more so than a novel. Perception, or ways of seeing, is fundamentally essential to avant-garde filmmakers. In film, a multitrack medium, “[e]verything can convey\n\n9781441163523_ch02_Finals_txt_print.indd 22\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:58 PM\n\nAdaptation Theory and Practice\n\n23\n\npoint-of-view: camera angle, focal length, music, mise-en-scène, performance, or costume.”25 This trait is important because it helps us see that film can ultimately separate itself from the confines of literary analysis. In other words, the tropes of cinema and the multiple styles filmmakers can take signify a new system of investigating the adaptation. Brian McFarlane discusses the vital significance and difference between the novel’s techniques and the cinema’s, writing, The camera—what it chooses to attend to and from what angle and distance according to what kinds of focus, whether it is still or moving, how it frames what is presented to its lens, or what information it chooses to withhold—is, in collaboration with the editor who decides on the suturing of shots to act out the director’s intention, as capable of complexity and subtlety, of ensuring emotional and intellectual engagement, as the writer is on the page in the exercise of a quite other sign system.26 Avant-garde filmmakers implicitly know how to convey emotional and intellectual responses by using the camera in profoundly unique ways. While McFarlane and Hutcheon rightfully place emphasis on the multitrack capabilities of the cinema, Leitch suggests we notice the differences between literature and film based on “performance.” He suggests, “Instead of saying that literary texts are verbal and movies aren’t, it would be more accurate to say that movies depend on prescribed, unalterable visual and verbal performances in a way literary texts don’t.”27 In essence, to establish a fair analysis of the film would mean to disregard the adapted text, to the extent that it does not “interfere” with the film, and focus on what is going on in front of the viewer on the screen, to simply pay attention to the details of the “performance” of film. Realizing the intertextual nature of the finished film helps distinguish the film text from the adapted text. The source text is not completely ignored; rather, it remains a touchstone but not one to use as a basis of comparison. Divorcing the film and adapted text from each other is impossible, as Hutcheon notes, because “when we call a work an adaptation, we openly announce its overt relationship to another work or works.”28 Adaptation always implies a change and not an alignment, and the finished film will always make us rethink the original or at least recognize the original in a new light—and this is a good thing. As Brooker says, “If there is one primary source text and the adaptation remains in significant textual contact with it, then it will not only present a changed version of its source but transform our understanding and valuation of that primary source too.”29\n\n9781441163523_ch02_Finals_txt_print.indd 23\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:58 PM\n\n24\n\nAdaptation and the Avant-Garde\n\nLiterary or other texts are not stable products and change through their own cultural, historical, and sociological permutations. Film adaptations “can outline the changing role of the literary text by examining the ways in which [they] embody the diverse interpretive possibilities that contribute to the text’s continuing vitality in various cultures and contexts.”30 This may go without saying, but it is important to consider with avant-garde films, which, by their very nature, ask us to reconsider the source text as a point of departure rather than a constant or unwavering entity. The avant-garde adaptation of a literary or other text is grounded in a particular moment in the filmmaker’s life. Understanding the visual and aural codes of a particular avant-garde film requires knowing something about the filmmaker’s style, whereas, I would suggest, it does not require a firm knowledge of the source text. In other words, having a solid perceptual knowledge and an innate conceptual knowledge will aid the spectator of the avant-garde film, inasmuch as being familiar with the codes of a literary text and the corresponding codes of film language. Again, the true nature of revealing a “successful” avantgarde adaptation depends on interpretation, both by the filmmaker and the spectator. As early as 1916, Hugo Munsterberg wrote that “the photoplay shows us a significant conflict of human actions in moving pictures which, freed from the physical forms of space, time, and causality, are adjusted to the free play of our mental experiences.”31 Films trigger internal responses—intellectual and emotional—based on the free play of our imaginations and memories. The perception of the film, the perceptual knowledge one receives through viewing, creates sensory impressions that affect individual responses and interpretations to films. Hutcheon comments that “each mode of engagement also involves what we might call a different ‘mental act’ for its audience,” meaning, the showing, telling, or interacting with stories requires a certain degree of individual interpretation and meaning-formation.”32 She continues, Telling requires of its audience conceptual work; showing calls on its perceptual decoding abilities. In the first, we imagine and visualize a world from black marks on white pages we read; in the second, our imaginations are preempted as we perceive and then give meaning to a world of images, sounds, and words seen and heard on the screen.33 In short, adaptation requires of its creator a large amount of imaginative and creative processes that enable spectators to interpret meaning based on a wide array of cinematic codes that demand equal attention. These\n\n9781441163523_ch02_Finals_txt_print.indd 24\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:58 PM\n\nAdaptation Theory and Practice\n\n25\n\ncodes can be cinema specific or extracinematic and so ask us to recognize the contexts and intertexts at play in the act of adaptation and reception. There may be multiple possible combinations of the codes, signs, structures, and events that are in the source text, which may be then exploited in the film. Avant-garde adaptations do this in a variety of ways. The translation of source material into a second medium, film, requires imagination on the part of the adapter. Like a literary translation, the transposition of any text to another demands insightful and ingenious decisions. The adapter-filmmaker relates stories in individual ways using methods that are best suited to the type of film he or she wants to make. These methods include the concretization of ideas, the actualization of symbols or metaphors, the amplification of nuances from various sources, and the criticism of the various texts that inspire the adapter’s interests. To translate literally means to change or transform something. Adaptations, however, are changes from one medium to another, so, according to Hutcheon, they become “re-meditations, that is, specifically translations in the form of intersemiotic transpositions from one sign system (e.g. words) to another (e.g. images).”34 This definition echoes Roman Jakobson’s idea of translation, “which is an interpretation of verbal signs by means of nonverbal sign systems,” and it plays on the popularity of semiotics as a means of discussing adaptations.35 While this is beneficial, it also suggests somewhat of a reliance on literary tropes for understanding the film.. Still, using ideas that discuss sign systems ultimately yields ways of addressing how the film differs from the original source. Hutcheon again says this kind of translation acts specifically “as transmutation or transcoding, that is, as necessarily a recording into a new set of conventions as well as signs.”36 This again may lead back to the notion of medium specificity, that film generates a system of signs and codes that are unique to it and therefore can be discussed in highly detailed ways. As Leitch suggests, “Interpreting and integrating these [filmic] codes into a single signifying system of a given film surely requires as much conceptual initiative and agility as interpreting the verbal (and narrative and fictional and figurative) signifying systems of a given novel.”37 Leitch is specifically discussing the translation of novels to film, which does not account for the hybridity of adaptations and the fact that films are often based on various written works, visual ephemera, and metatextual sources, but his comment is still useful. In other words, the fact that films can adapt aural, visual, and narrative codes from many sources to create one final text demonstrates its flexibility in terms of the transcoding of verbal signs into visual ones. We must\n\n9781441163523_ch02_Finals_txt_print.indd 25\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:58 PM\n\n26\n\nAdaptation and the Avant-Garde\n\ntake into account the language of film first before deciding whether or not certain codes were translated from the original source(s). Film is a language with its own properties, and, as Astruc wrote, film language is a “form in which and by which an artist can express his thoughts, however abstract they may be, or translate his obsessions exactly as he does in the contemporary essay or novel.”38 The focus on the filmmaker’s obsessions or thoughts reiterates the compulsion of avant-garde filmmakers to rely solely on the creative impulses that spring from within. Why should there be so much speculation about the theoretical and practical implications of adaptation? There is no common ground on which to discuss them, but the field of adaptation studies is rife with guesswork. Adaptations as translations, transmutations, or transitionings all become sites of inference and interpretation, a field where mental acumen is as important as technical competence. The avant-garde filmmaker seeks alternative ways of making films and rarely believes in adhering to mainstream formulas or narrative constructs. As a language, film has the capacity to express any kind of thought, and an adaptation can express any kind of variation on the original. This transference from one language medium to another means that ultimately the adaptation becomes something new. The avant-garde filmmaker rightly chooses creative ways to make films of previous material. Films create meaning based on techniques that provoke, invoke, and evoke connotative or more straightforward significance or importance for individual spectators. Understanding why certain avant-garde films do these things is central to understanding the meanings in the film itself, rather than the meanings associated with or transferred from the original. Leitch writes, “The primary lesson of film adaptation [is] that texts remain alive only to the extent that they can be rewritten and that to experience a text in all its power requires each reader to rewrite it.”39 Film adaptations are rewrites of original texts, constructed by both filmmaker and viewer alike. Because of this, there can be numerous ways the film constructs meaning, from the filmmaker’s vision and choices to the viewer’s own sensibilities. Adaptations stress—or should stress—differences versus similarities. As Naremore suggests, adaptations focus on “individual styles rather than formal systems,” which highlights the fact that adaptations are new, different texts.40 Even the famous theorist Andre Bazin wrote that “[f]aithfulness to a form, literary or otherwise, is illusory: what matters is the equivalence in meaning of the forms.”41 While this typically does not always occur in avant-garde adaptations, mainly because the avant-garde filmmaker is interested in many things besides equivalence, Bazin’s comment\n\n9781441163523_ch02_Finals_txt_print.indd 26\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:58 PM\n\nAdaptation Theory and Practice\n\n27\n\nnevertheless stresses the importance of meaning, which I think has to do with interpretation. Film adaptations engage in a continuing discursive relationship with their source texts, so much so that “adaptation is less a resuscitation of an originary word than an ongoing dialogical process.”42 The constant dialogue that exists between film and adapted text allows us to see that adaptations are ongoing processes. The appeal of adaptations lies in their ability to engage the spectator in multiple texts, which in turns allows us to see how intertextuality informs the production and reception of adaptations. If approached this way, then relying on fidelity criticism becomes only a minor facet of interpretation. Cinematic language is a rich synaesthetic experience. It is open to many kinds of references, metaphors, allusions, and symbols, as well as verbal and pictorial practices. The cinema can represent almost anything real or unreal, present ideological positions, juxtapose competing theses, encompass various aesthetic movements, and engage with cultural and societal manifestations. The cinema can translate whole entities into its technological and cultural apparatus. Adaptations serve the cinema better than any other artistic medium because it can represent and represent stories from tradition, fiction, or memory. Walter Benjamin discussed the “auratic” quality of art forms and, in particular, the means by which some forms either lose or maintain their aura once projected, displayed, and consumed by culture. Hutcheon relies on Benjamin in one of her definitions of adaptation, specifically determining that films as adaptations do not lose their auratic qualities, which is true: Because each adaptation must also stand on its own, separate from the palimpsetic pleasures of doubled experience, it does not lose its Benjaminian aura. It is not a copy in any mode of reproduction, mechanical or otherwise. It is repetition without replication, bringing together the comfort and ritual and recognition with the delight of surprise and novelty. As adaptation, it involves both memory and change, persistence and variation.43 As an act of translation, an adaptation maintains its uniqueness while inherently keeping its ties to the adapted text; there is no complete separation. Benjamin’s 1936 essay, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” argues that film has the ability to challenge the traditional forms of art, like literature, that seemingly make them “untouchable” as unmalleable categories. In the essay, Benjamin claims “that the ‘auratic’ reading and viewing formations of those classical arts\n\n9781441163523_ch02_Finals_txt_print.indd 27\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:58 PM\n\n28\n\nAdaptation and the Avant-Garde\n\nmust give way before the cinema’s radical reworkings, transformations, and adaptations.”44 Benjamin suggests that translation, or adaptation, does not attempt to recapture what is embedded in the original but to free it in a new form, the film. Therefore, the original text must be freed from its original language in order to be appreciated and to take on a new life in its new language of the cinema. As Hutcheon surmises, Benjamin argues that “translation is not a rendering of some fixed nontextual meaning to be copied or paraphrased or reproduced; rather, it is an engagement with the original text that makes us see that text in different ways.”45 Translators—the adapters—can liberate the source text from its own limitations and restrictions, which produces a wealth of material that can be translated to the screen in the adaptation, which, in turn, creates its own auratic quality. Duncan Reekie suggests that imitative copies of original works of art—the mechanical reproduction—create a hierarchy of auratic valorization, that each subsequent adaptation or alteration of an original diminishes the auratic quality of the source.46 This may be true in some instances, especially in painting or sculpture, but film is unique because it exists in the public and private realms. The cinematic apparatus creates aura through its very process of duplication and reduplication. Avant-garde filmmakers who, existing primarily in the private sector of art, create adaptations ultimately make films that have their own auratic identity and worth, their own value and cultural and social credence. The arguments that persist over the aura of art as posited by Benjamin will always remain contentious, but it is important to consider how adaptations can indeed create their own aura, tied to but also free from the original text’s aura, however large or slight it may be.\n\nHistorical Trajectories A fascination with moving images in early cinema history drew on the pictorial arts, so much so that by the end of the nineteenth century, the many cinematic devices that were created stemmed from the power of the image over the power of the written word. The increased interest in and fascination with realism as both a practice and, later, artistic (mainly literary) theory led early film directors to literary texts as sources of inspiration. The primitive nature of early filmmaking, particularly the centrally framed stationary camera, lended a “staged play” quality to movies that appealed to audiences for their melodrama as much as their familiarity. Filmmakers borrowed scenes, concepts, and stories from literature\n\n9781441163523_ch02_Finals_txt_print.indd 28\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:58 PM\n\nAdaptation Theory and Practice\n\n29\n\nto create a form of old-fashioned style of adaptation, one that presents rather than represents. (Tom Gunning has called this era of filmmaking the “cinema of attractions,” where spectacle [showing] trumps narrative [telling].) Another reason early filmmakers looked to literary sources was to establish film as a more respectable art than the novelty it was originally perceived as being. The practice of using prior literary texts as sources for films also gained film a new, more sophisticated audience, one with more cultural credence and class status than the immigrant workers who flocked to the movies. One argument about traditional adaptations, those that stem from recognized literary masterpieces, concerns the issue of characterization and the capacity of readers versus movie spectators to identify with the protagonist (or antagonist). Readers can certainly identify and sympathize with characters in fictional books, but real people captured moving (and later emitting sound) spoke to a more heightened sense of verisimilitude that provided spectators with an enhanced degree of identification and sympathy. This idea is debatable and is really of greater concern to historical debates rather than spectators of the avant-garde, where characters often become abstractions instead of flesh-and-blood people. Still, in early cinema, the addition of movement to printed words—in the form of intertitles—gave audiences a reason to believe the fictional portrayal of well-known stories from literature. Issues of character empathy have also dominated adaptation studies in more recent years, as cognitive theory shifted critical analyses away from psychoanalytic interpretations to ones based on the psychology of the spectator. Adaptations take many permutations, and avant-garde films that are inspired by particular sources tend to be more personal and reflective of individual styles. Certainly there are those films (and directors) that can be analyzed as having recurring stylistic techniques or themes, but the world of avant-garde film assumes no direct relation to fidelity, taking an interpretive approach instead. The rise of auteurism in film studies has only enhanced the role of the avant-garde; in no other film genre, if the avant-garde can be called one, is there more representations of the auteur. In the present environment of media conglomerates that own studios, the interest lies in financial gain. Avant-garde filmmakers exist in a world where there is mainly concern for integrity and vision. Adaptations take on a new life independent of, or interdependent with, the original source. Visualizing something that has existed before as a cultural artifact means interpreting that particular source in ways suitable to the visualization of the filmmaker. In other words, adaptations\n\n9781441163523_ch02_Finals_txt_print.indd 29\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:59 PM\n\nAdaptation and the Avant-Garde\n\n30\n\nserve as synergetic texts that both adhere to some ideas present from the original but also outwardly acknowledge the differences that simultaneously operate in the world of the adaptation. Standard adaptations often stress the sameness factor—the film is overly and deliberately similar to the original. Again, this is why the concept of exploitation serves as an effective means of discussing the adaptation as a new text. Most adaptations privilege parts of the original over others; for instance, some might only translate the essence, tone, or mood of the original while ignoring the plot or characters entirely. Exploitative adaptations also appropriate other elements, a key feature that I will discuss further when addressing particular avant-garde films that are appropriations. We should remember that film has two separate narratives: One that is verbal, and one that is visual. Many avant-garde films do not have speech at all, but any utterance can be considered a verbal exchange, whereas visual narration occurs when the film displays the world around us in new and unique way, offering a way of seeing the words or prior images the film is adapting. There are many terms that can be applied to adaptation, words that have an assortment of connotative meanings, but ones that also are important in understanding the process of adaptation in general. A few of the terms are: z z z z z z z z z z\n\nRecycling Remaking Retelling Reproduction Rewriting Mutation Metamorphosis Transfiguration Transposition Borrowing\n\nThe list could certainly be extended. The terms included relate to issues of fidelity but, more appropriately, shun notions of loyalty, faithfulness, and devotion to the original, which is a good thing. According to Stam, “If ‘fidelity’ is an inadequate trope, what tropes might be more appropriate?” He continues, Adaptation has available a rich constellation of terms and tropes—translation, actualization, reading, critique, dialogization, cannibalization,\n\n9781441163523_ch02_Finals_txt_print.indd 30\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:59 PM\n\nAdaptation Theory and Practice\n\n31\n\ntransmutation, transfiguration, incarnation, transmogrification, transcoding, performance, signifying, rewriting, detournement—all of which shed light on a different dimension of adaptation.47 Many critics and scholars of adaptation have used these ideas in numerous systems used for analyzing and interpreting adaptations. Studies of adaptations are therefore laden with complications over the use of the best methodological approach, but I would suggest that, instead of prioritizing the methods, we should whichever ones are best suited for certain and specific adaptations. Exploitative adaptations are ones that utilize all of the methods of adaptation, so that it becomes relevant to address all models, both theoretical and practical, when discussing avant-garde films. We should remember, too, that adaptations are forms of critique—of the original source, of the sociocultural milieu in which it was created, and of other adaptations themselves. Texts that are translated from one medium to another are refunctioned as works that both enable and inhibit specific correct ways of discussing them. In other words, adaptations elude one particular way of describing them; they are far too complicated. A film adaptation creates a new story; it is not the same as the original, nor should it be considered as such. The film takes on a new life and the characteristics of the source text—everything from plot and characterization to setting—has the potential to drastically change. Narratives and characters become independent of the original text, though each is based on the original source. Film scholars have often considered the study of adaptation as a kind of hybrid approach thatsometimes results in a literary analysis instead of a film analysis. One of the reasons I think addressing adaptations as exploitations and translations can be beneficial is simply because it opens new avenues of exploration—of considering the process of adaptation rather than the finished product (though the film itself should be discussed on its own terms as a film). An exploitative adaptation considers adaptations as a kind of ongoing discourse that broaches both the original and adapted text as entities that should be thought of as independent. Translations offer a means of analyzing adaptations that differ from previous studies because they focus less on fidelity and more on how adaptation should be defined and discussed as a critical inquiry separate from literary studies. According to Linda Hutcheon, “An adaptation is a derivation that is not derivative—a work that is second without being secondary.”48 I tend to agree with this assertion that, while adaptations are secondary re-formations of texts, they are not lacking in\n\n9781441163523_ch02_Finals_txt_print.indd 31\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:59 PM\n\n32\n\nAdaptation and the Avant-Garde\n\noriginality. Instead, they are intrinsically new texts wherein the spectator forms meaning based on the immediate experience of watching the film. Some prior knowledge of the adapted text may be helpful, but it is not necessary to enjoy the film as its own new thing. Spectators can “fill in gaps” during and after the viewing process. According to Brooker, “Translation becomes a ‘hybridizing instance’ marked by disparity, gaps, and indeterminacy rather than equivalence.”49 An adaptation therefore opens up many channels of reference and transformation, seeking not to argue equivalence but rather to uncover the difference between the film and the many texts that give it meaning and substance. Given the fact that there have been many recent fruitful contributions to adaptation studies, it may seem tedious to offer another study. I want to sort through some of these methods before elaborating on the idea of an adaptation as translation, which is a kind of exploitation. Translation indicates change; it is the rendering of one thing into another, a transformation or conversion in form and appearance, but one that has to rely on its source while distancing itself from it. Translations also indicate that there is a change in spectatorship, from reading to viewing, if it is a novel-to-film adaptation, for instance. Adaptations also appropriate the meaning of the source text, which implies a certain degree of violence rendered on the original. This “theft” is precisely what causes panic in purists: If the film is vastly different from the novel, then the novel has seemingly been corrupted. Appropriation raises questions of individual agency, but the end result is what matters: What exactly has been chosen from the original to satisfy the needs of the spectator or, more adequately, the director in the new one? To a certain extent, adaptations are based on the denial and acceptance, even to excess, of certain narrative elements or strategies over others. As Brian McFarlane suggests, “Adapting literary texts to film is a creative undertaking, but the task requires a kind of selective interpretation, along with the ability to recreate and sustain an established mood.”50 The film adaptation becomes a site where choices have to be made—even creative choices on the part of the adapter—to present the same material in a new way, to a different audience, much the same way a translator makes choices when translating a text from one specific textual culture and audience to another. Considering adaptations as exploitations and translations will enable one to gain a much greater knowledge of the translated product, the film, and the reasons the translator—the film director—has made certain decisions and choices in the translation process. To be an adapter means exploiting the source material; it necessitates a creative change.\n\n9781441163523_ch02_Finals_txt_print.indd 32\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:59 PM\n\nAdaptation Theory and Practice\n\n33\n\nFilm adaptations have the ability to connect with larger areas of discourse, including sociological, cultural, economic, and historical ones, which in turn allows spectators to differentiate among various adaptation processes by placing them in a broader context. Attempting to understand how adaptations interact with sociocultural contexts allows us to see how and why directors make certain choices in the adaptation process. For example, a more mainstream adaptation, such as a comic book adaptation, may be intended primarily for financial gain, thereby basing the adaptation on the elements that are going to please the audience enough to secure greater profits. Doing so may mean altering the original or omitting crucial characters. Still, the end result is based on the discretion of the creator of the film. Avant-garde adaptations actively pursue alternative forms and narrative strategies in order to render a successful adaptation. This idea is contrary to the typical discussions of adaptation theory, which either aim for fidelity to the original or attempt to maintain the core attributes of the original. Deliberately sidestepping issues of fidelity, the avant-garde adapter wants to create an entirely new text based more on mood and interpretation. The exploitation of the original source material, whether novel, poem, document, or video, signifies the avant-garde director as a major progenitor of alternative adaptation methods. The exploitative adaptation emphasizes the adapter’s individual vision and discernment of the source material; it is a more personal reading of the source text that further serves as an inspiration rather than an outline for copying. The exploitation of the source text demonstrates an acute awareness of the endless possibilities that adaptations can become; it stresses the need for varying approaches. To exploit something or someone suggests an exposure, a revealing way of using and abusing the source material to produce new perspectives and meanings. Essentially, when considering avant-garde adaptations, one must keep an open mind to the endless possibilities that emerge from the process and the products of the adaptation process.\n\n9781441163523_ch02_Finals_txt_print.indd 33\n\n8/12/2011 4:07:59 PM\n\nChapter 3\n\nAppropriation\n\nThe “theft” of previously available artistic works, cultural artifacts, historical data, or biographical information, whether in performance or as a published piece, has been a common practice of creative endeavor, whether in filmmaking, writing, or visual art, for centuries. Appropriation generally has had a negative connotation since the term means to “steal or misuse”; however, in the arts, appropriation refers to the practice of borrowing or adopting, which, when considered in adaptation studies, is not a detriment at all but rather a way of viewing the original work in a new way, and one that also allows us to see the original as a foundational text on which to build and interpret. Most avant-garde filmmakers are individualistic in their approach to adaptations, and appropriation is no different, even though the filmmaker is taking things that are already existent but using them in new ways in a particular kind of adaptive process. There are films that incorporate images, words, or sounds that suggest a relationship with the appropriated source. Rose Hobart (1936), Joseph Cornell’s avant-garde film of the actress Rose Hobart from the film East of Borneo (1931), uses appropriation to completely alter narrative causality, time, and space. Kenneth Anger’s Scorpio Rising, one of the most important avant-garde films of the 1960s, appropriates images of biker culture, Jesus, and pop songs to tell its narrative. Filmmakers who engage in appropriation do so for the purpose of reevaluating the source text(s) from which they borrow, while at the same time creating an exclusively new form of art, the film. Anger’s film, for example, is completely subversive; through using images of Christ as a parallel narrative to the biker leader’s journey, we see how established patterns of acceptance become reimagined through the film. Appropriation is an act of examination, of sifting through the range of source texts available to the filmmaker (or writer, as many discussions of appropriation focus on literature) in order to uncover how one uses them in creating something new. To appropriate, then, is to engage in intertextuality, the\n\n9781441163523_ch03_Finals_txt_print.indd 34\n\n8/12/2011 4:08:02 PM\n\nAppropriation\n\n35\n\nprocess of examining the ways in which texts interact and the ways in which spectators respond to the multiple threads of texts that can inform the film adaptation. Avant-garde films are antithetical to tradition, so if they do participate in the act of appropriation, they may typically do so in an abusive fashion. What this means is that the film might serve as a critique of the original adapted source text(s). According to Julie Sanders, “[A]ppropriation carries out the same substantial engagement as adaptation but frequently adopts a posture of critique, even assault.”1 By contrast, an outright adaptation may have a more prolonged engagement with the source text. Many Shakespeare adaptations function in this way, however, there are those Shakespeare adaptations that also serve as critiques, such as Peter Greenaway’s Prospero’s Books (which I will discuss more fully in Chapter 14) or Tom Stoppard’s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, in which appropriation becomes more functional. Appropriation may borrow, reconstitute, mimic, echo, allude, imitate, continue, rewrite, or refashion elements or characteristics of the original, including styles, plots, themes, motifs, subject matter, or generic tropes, but do so in a way that allows us to see both the originality of the new work (here, a film) and to point us back to the source for reexamination. According to James Young, appropriations may become authentic artworks themselves, even if they look to other texts for material, which is true when regarding avant-garde films. He states: Works that are an expression of an artist’s individual genius are characterized by personal authenticity. Personal authenticity is an aesthetic merit. All things being equal, a work of art that is an original expression of an artist’s genius is more valuable than a derivative one. The original artwork opens up new perspectives. It excites the imagination in new ways.2 While defining genius is problematic, Young’s point is important because in regard to avant-garde films, the opening of “new perspectives,” coupled with exciting the imagination, occurs in almost every instance of avantgarde filmmaking—indeed, it is often its purpose to engage, enlighten, and inspire the spectator, whether it is an adaptation or not. Avant-garde appropriations and adaptations are of equal significance as the original text; they are not necessarily only a derivation. In other words, avantgarde appropriations and adaptations showcase “genius” and “personal authenticity” as much as an original work. Young also makes the point\n\n9781441163523_ch03_Finals_txt_print.indd 35\n\n8/12/2011 4:08:02 PM\n\n36\n\nAdaptation and the Avant-Garde\n\nthat “[a]rtists who appropriate content, styles, or motifs do not need to worry that their works will necessarily be inauthentic or otherwise aesthetically flawed.”3 More precise, avant-garde adaptations do not become lesser kinds of art; they do, as I have suggested, often become even better or more pronounced forms of art that enable creative expression and perception in spectators. Appropriations sometimes invite comparison-and-contrast evaluations, but avant-garde films that rewrite texts by exploiting them—with either exploitative appropriation or adaptation— become texts beyond imitative products. As Sanders suggests, “The ‘rewrite’ invariably transcends mere imitation . . . [by] adding, supplementing, [and] improving. The aim is not replication as such, but rather complication, expansion rather then contraction.”4 What avant-garde films do is allow us to see how source texts are amendable to expansion or supplementation, which makes the films better than their source texts in terms of representation. Appropriations become new forms of representation through their collective assemblage of style, theme, mood, or form. Relationships between intertexts and their referents also constantly remind us of the process of revision, and avant-garde adaptations participate in revisions or reworkings of texts in ways that force us to reexamine original works. Postmodernism has scrutinized past historical events, aesthetic or otherwise, to remind us of the processes of reinvention or intervention involved in discussing any and all art forms. Postmodern theory also touches on the notions of real and fake, or the “hyperreal,” all ideas that become elusive when attempting to fortify a large, grand narrative theory. Adaptations or appropriations deal with the relationship between what is real (the source text) and what is the imitation (the not-real adaptation), and while most critics argue over the true aesthetic quality of the reproduction (the adaptation), what actually needs to be considered or scrutinized is how much the successor text supersedes or supplants the source text based on its own authenticity. Films that appropriate from other art forms, such as literature, film, historical events, or biographical data, all serve as unique case studies for investigating meaning. Appropriations are a type of adaptation, and many avant-garde films utilize appropriation in order to present their subjects, and in the process become alternative ways of rethinking either precursor texts or historical or biographical events. According to Sanders, No appropriation can be achieved without impacting upon and altering in some way the text which inspired the adaptation. So influential,\n\n9781441163523_ch03_Finals_txt_print.indd 36\n\n8/12/2011 4:08:02 PM\n\nAppropriation\n\n37\n\nindeed, have some appropriations become that in many instances they now define our first experiences or encounters with their precursor work of art.5 Adaptations are often concerned with providing commentary on source texts. Appropriations of styles or themes from previous works also serve as critical perspectives. The avant-garde adaptation that uses appropriated material becomes a form of art that offers radically new perceptions of the original, even as it divorces itself from the original to become something as original as the precursor text(s) that inspire it. As mentioned, avant-garde films challenge the ways we see things by altering styles or forms of the apparatus itself, to reimagining themes that may pervade our everyday lives (love, hate, life, death). In this way, avant-garde films continuously make us reshape subjectivity or question any kind of subjective presentation of material. The same occurs in adaptation and appropriation: The source text is reviewed through the new critical lens of the avant-garde. In today’s society, it is arguable that almost any cultural artifact or manifestation is somehow influenced through appropriation or forms of appropriation like pastiche, allusion, or quotation. The presumed or acknowledged intertextuality of literature or film encourages an ever-evolving construction of meaning, and avant-garde film participates in the process of changing meaning inasmuch as it supports expanding meaning. Appropriations often point to ways of criticizing the original source(s) for the adaptation. According to Sanders, “Intrinsic to appropriations rather than the movements of proximation or cross-generic interpretation . . . central to adaptation, here we have a wholesale rethinking of the terms of the original.”6 As I will discuss in my analysis of Hans-Jürgen Syberberg’s Hitler, A Film from Germany (1977), the immensity of ideas present in the film not only encourages us but forces us to rethink the original (Hitler and the Hitler legacy) through bricolage, collage, and Brechtian distanciation, devices Syberberg uses to confound and enthrall the spectator. Syberberg’s use of many materials—film clips, newsreels, radio voiceovers, tableaux—creates a tapestry of intermingling texts. “Encouraged interplay between appropriations and their sources,” suggests Sanders, “begins to emerge, then, as a fundamental, even vital, aspect of the reading or spectating experiences, one productive of new meanings, applications, and resonance.”7 In this sense, appropriations enrich and elevate texts, here a film, rather than “stealing” their essence from them.\n\n9781441163523_ch03_Finals_txt_print.indd 37\n\n8/12/2011 4:08:03 PM\n\n38\n\nAdaptation and the Avant-Garde\n\nA large percentage of adaptations and appropriations occur within a preordained canon of literature, and the subsequent adaptation is also often assimilated into the same hierarchy. The discourse surrounding adaptations of canonical works thus become discussions of similarity. Avant-garde adaptations and appropriations set themselves apart because they focus on differences, allowing a more fruitful discourse on the significance of intertextuality or the multitude of connotations that accompany adaptations or appropriations, terms and ideas that are both enriching and sometimes admittedly ambiguous, for instance, possession, haunted, homage, grafting, supplement,and continuation. While it can be productive to discuss how avant-garde adaptations are similar to their sources, whether they participate in outright or subtle forms of adaptation or appropriation, most of these unique kinds of transpositioning allow us to see how ideas that emerge from the source text inform subjective, interpretive, and creative adaptations or adaptations that appropriate from a single (or variety of) source(s). Avant-garde adaptations often signal a direct relationship to their source text(s), a specific version of the source, but nevertheless constitute an ongoing contentious affiliation and association while also becoming something new. The transference or translation of generic codes, temporal and spatial schemes, and historical or cultural boundaries in the avant-garde adaptation or appropriation signifies a shift to a more nuanced way of considering the process of appropriating materials in order to create the new adapted text. The use of appropriation in avant-garde films generally points to a distancing from the original or informing source, so much so that the resulting adaptation becomes an entirely separate product. Setting texts against one another, the avant-garde appropriation signifies a shift toward outright speculation on the part of the filmmaker and spectator: The viewing experience becomes one of questioning just as it is one of enjoyment. According to Sanders, “The spectator or reader must be able to participate in the play of similarity and difference perceived between the original, source, or inspiration to appreciate fully the reshaping or rewriting undertaken by the original.”8 The original document that transforms itself through appropriation becomes the fuller original adapted text, and the spectator relationship with the text, like the reader relationship, evolves. Avant-garde films force us to reconsider notions of perception and subjectivity, ideas that can either invigorate spectators or cause them to turn away from the film. In an adaptation, at least the potential familiarity of the source assists one when viewing; perhaps the reliability of awareness helps spectators not used to viewing avant-garde\n\n9781441163523_ch03_Finals_txt_print.indd 38\n\n8/12/2011 4:08:03 PM\n\nAppropriation\n\n39\n\nfilm. Avant-garde films that use appropriated material either force spectators into a contentious relationship with the source text(s), making us reconsider the very source(s) themselves, or they cause spectators to disassociate themselves from the new revitalization of the world of the avant-garde adaptation. As Johanna Burton comments, “Appropriation might be seen as a mode of revealing language, representation and even social space to be so shape-shifting as to subsist simultaneously as both weapon and target.” Appropriation can, she continues, “reveal critically the ways that subjectivity is crafted, consumed and controlled.”9 The avant-garde film is indeed contentious, even reactionary by nature; it breaks rules, which suggests that transgression provokes disavowal in the discomfited or threatened viewer. Many theoreticians and cultural critics, from T. S. Eliot to Gèrard Genette, have commented on the inevitability of appropriation, that meanings are formed by the interrelations among or between texts and that authors—for they primarily discuss novels—are subject to (in) direct influence. Appropriations act as filtrations of cultural commodities, whether they are literary, filmic, musical, or visual, or, as often the case, biographical or historical, and thus they exploit (take, borrow, or use) these items in new and exciting ways for the avant-garde adaptation. Appropriations actively assimilate, construct, and utilize—they do not function as mere imitations but rather as ongoing processes of critical and aesthetic commentary. Appropriation has significantly played a part in the historical trajectory of the avant-garde (and other arts or genres). As David Evans suggests, “The readymade, collage and montage are presented as the three innovations of the historic avant-gardes that cumulatively register this fundamental transition, without which any notion of contemporary appropriation art is unimaginable.”10 Citing the fact that appropriation is really an inevitable daily occurrence might lead one to consider how the appropriated material is used. What function might it serve? In an avant-garde adaptation, the appropriation of previous existing artistic or social or cultural materials, whether historical or biographical, fiction or nonfiction, helps identify them as special occurrences of regeneration. What constitutes the intermingling of texts is the process of appropriation as adaptation, which allows us to appreciate how the avant-garde filmmaker uses them to unusual or new effect.\n\n9781441163523_ch03_Finals_txt_print.indd 39\n\n8/12/2011 4:08:03 PM\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Exploitative Adaptation\n\nAlmost any text, whether literary or cultural artifact, can be rewritten or appropriated through public consumption or by an individual artist. Adaptations can change dramatically from original sources to their finished, or secondary, status, and the process involved in this alteration can take many directions, which makes understanding the processes at work of great significance.
