        "text": "\"Attached to anything else, the tagline “The Last Science Fiction Movie” might sound hubristic. But it’s absolutely appropriate to PROXIMA, an apocalyptic love letter to sci-fi and its fans. Atanes puts his obsession with the genre front and center, and the film is dotted with casual references to Blade Runner, Star Wars, and Jean-Luc Picard. Perhaps the most telling such reference is “Felix Cadecq,” the name of the Kilgore Trout-like author (Solàs) whose revelations set Tony’s adventure in motion —and a Spanish homonym for “Philip K. Dick,” whose pet themes form the backbone of PROXIMA‘s mind-bending world. But Atanes, as liberally as he may borow from the sci-fi canon, never settles for pure pastiche...\" —Read the whole review at 366 Weird Movies\n\nFetisch Film Festival will take place in from October 25 to October 29 in Kiel (Germany).\n\nAs the name suggest it's a festival focused on fetish and erotic film. The program is online at last, and you can check it on the official website. It brings a lot of very interesting movies and \"Maximum Shame\" will be among them, as unique guest from Spain.\n\nBut I am also particularly excited because our film will share screen with the latest movie from David Cronenberg, \"A Dangerous Method\" -played by Keira Knightley, Michael Fassbender, Viggo Mortensen, Vincent Cassel and Andre Hennicke-. Let me tell you that Cronenberg is one of my favourite filmmakers, I venerate his whole filmography and I think he's one of the greatest film directors alive. So it's a real honor and an immense pleasure for me to have been selected at the same festival.\n\nCarlos Atanes website: www.carlosatanes.com\n\nI talked about the scene of spears some months ago, when Helena Colomé sent a photo to my Hall of Fame. I am showing this piece because it's just a bit of archeology never seen before. Don't take too many pains trying to understand this. I shooted it in 1995 for my filmed-but-never-edited 16 mm feature film Triptico.\n\nThe girls are Arantxa Peña (in black) and Helena Colomé (in yellow), the two actresses who have done more films with me. Arantxa and Helena were not in the cast of Triptico, but I invited them to come a day and shooting an improvised sequence. We had long screens, some sticks and four anonymous spectators who jumped on stage. I don't know what the girls are exactly doing. I don't know what the men with sticks are doing. But you can reach your own concluisons. If you wish tell me what do you think of it on my Facebook page.\n\nAnother day I will talk about how much I like women with ponytails, tight dresses and ankle boots.\n\nCarlos Atanes website: www.carlosatanes.com"
