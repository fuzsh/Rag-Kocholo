        "text": "2.1. Materials\n\nTo carry out this work, two differentiated gypsum materials were used for their fineness of grinding: fine white gypsum (YF) for applications in buildings, and plaster (E35) with smaller size particles. The raw material used to obtain the gypsum materials is aljez, a sedimentary rock of chemical precipitation constituted by calcium sulfate with two water molecules (CaSO4∙2H2O) called gypsum dihydrate (DH). The basis for firing gypsum dihydrate for use as a construction material is carried out with the following basic reaction scheme:\n\nCaSO4·2H2O→CaSO4·12H2O(α,β)+32H2O\n\n(1)\n\nCaSO4·12H2O→CaSO4+12H2O\n\n(2)\n\nIn such a way that the dihydrate gypsum is dehydrated according to an endothermic process at temperatures between 105–110 °C to obtain mainly calcium sulfate with 0.5 molecules of water (CaSO4∙0.5H2O) called gypsum hemihydrate (HH), in its two forms α (more compact and with greater resistance) or β (more soluble and less stable), and which is the majority component of commercial gypsum for building applications. In the implementation of commercial gypsum, mixing with water leads to the rehydration of the HH, giving DH again in the setting process.\n\nFor its part, the hemihydrate undergoes endothermic dehydration to obtain anhydrous calcium sulfate (CaSO4) called soluble anhydrite or anhydrite III at a temperature below 200 °C [31,32]. The phase transformation of soluble anhydrite to insoluble anhydrite (or anhydrite II), exothermic, and that does not entail associated weight loss, occurs at a temperature, around 200 °C, in the case of hemihydrate and between 300–400 °C for the hemihydrate [32]. The exact temperature at which these dehydration reactions occur depends on experimental conditions, and the separation of events that occur at similar temperatures improves when the rate of heating is low and controlled [33].\n\nThe analysis of the raw materials of plaster E35 and fine gypsum YF, supplied by the company Saint Gobain PLACO IBERICA S.A. (Madrid, Spain), was carried out on the powder samples. First, the X-ray diffraction test was carried out using Siemens Krystalloflex D5000 equipment (Madrid, Spain) with a Cu-Kα graphite monochromator. In this way, a diffractogram has been obtained in a range between 5° ≤ 2θ ≤ 100° every 0.04° and one second of passage as can be seen in .\n\nIn , it is observed that both the fine gypsum and the plaster used in this work show four main peaks at angles of 14.7°, 25.7°, 29.7°, and 31.9° corresponding to the hemihydrate gypsum [32]. The presence of anhydrite can be seen in the fine gypsum sample with diffraction peaks located at angles of 25.4° and 31.4°.\n\nBesides, a thermogravimetric analysis of both raw materials was also carried out using TA Instruments SDT Q600 equipment (Madrid, Spain). Heating was carried out from room temperature to 400 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min and air atmosphere (100 mL/min), analyzing an approximate mass of 40 mg in each test. The results obtained for the two gypsum materials used are shown in and . They show the evolution of the mass of the samples versus temperature (green line), the first derivative of the mass versus temperature (blue line), and the energy per unit mass versus temperature (brown line) that monitors associated thermal events. The figures show the percentage of mass (%) lost concerning the initial mass and the mass (mg) lost in each event, as well as the temperature at which the maximum speed in the loss of mass occurs.\n\nFrom the analysis of and , it was possible to observe that both the E35 plaster and the YF fine gypsum showed a first loss of mass (corresponding to 0.44% for plaster and 1% for gypsum) due to the surface humidity below 75 °C. Next, the second loss of mass was observed that took place between 75 and 175 °C as a consequence of the dehydration of the hemihydrate that gives rise to soluble anhydrite with a maximum of 131 °C for plaster and 125 °C for gypsum and associated mass losses of 5.8% and 4.2%, respectively; this event is endothermic as can be seen in the curve corresponding to heat flow. The exothermic phase transformation from soluble anhydrite to insoluble anhydrite did not lead to associated weight loss and was observed in plaster at 344 °C and less clearly in gypsum at 357 °C. These temperatures indicate that in both cases the sample contains β-hemihydrate.\n\nThe amount of hemihydrate (HH) present in the raw material samples on both a dry and wet basis is presented in . For the calculation, the initial mass of the sample subjected to thermal analysis, the loss in mass of the second thermal event between approximately 75 and 175 °C, and the stoichiometry of the reaction Equation (2) have been taken into account.\n\nTable 1\n\nSample %H2O % HH Wet Base% HH Dry BaseE350.493.8594.27YF1.067.0067.66\n\nAs can be seen in , the purity of the E35 plaster sample was much higher with a hemihydrate content close to 94%, which was reduced to 67% in the fine gypsum sample (wet base). This was due, on the one hand, to the presence of anhydrite in fine gypsum as shown in the X-ray diffractogram and, on the other hand, to the additive content of fine gypsum raw materials which decomposes at high temperatures (not shown in the thermogravimetric analysis).\n\nOn the other hand, shows the dosages used for the preparation of the RILEM (The International Union of Laboratories and Experts in Construction Materials, Systems, and Structures) standardized 4 cm × 4 cm × 16 cm test specimens. It should be noted that high water/conglomerate ratios were chosen to show the effect that the variation in the content of mixing water and humidity has on the setting process of the samples.\n\nTable 2\n\nDenominationWater (g)Gypsum (g)DenominationWater (g)Plaster (g)YF-0.66001000E35-0.77001000YF-0.88001000E35-0.99001000\n\nThe preparation of all the batches was carried out with the same technique and equipment following the recommendations of the UNE-EN 13279-1: 2009 [34] standard, always under the same environmental conditions (65% relative humidity and 22 °C ambient temperature) and without performing an energetic kneading that could break the internal microstructure of the gypsum composite materials.\n\n2.2. Design and Development of Low-Cost Measurement Equipment\n\n2.2.1. Arduino Resistive Sensor\n\nThe low-cost Arduino sensor used in this work consists of the following electronic components: Arduino UNO board with ATmega328P microprocessor with 14 digital inputs/outputs and 6 analog inputs, with the possibility of a USB connection to the computer, 8 GB MicroSD memory module to store the information without saturating the internal memory of the Arduino controller, and a humidity sensor, the Arduino Grove-Moisture Sensor HL-69 model (RS component, Madrid, Spain). shows the sensor connection diagram.\n\nIt is worth highlighting the versatility that Arduino has to connect the physical world with the digital world, the possibility of automating the samplings, and the large existing free software community that allows quick access to the information flows about the sensors used [35]. On the other hand, the resistive sensor HL-69 has been used previously in other research works to determine the moisture content of different types of soils [36], basing its operation on the electrical conductivity of the medium in which it is introduced according to the Equation (3):\n\nI=σ·E·S\n\n(3)\n\nwhere I is the current intensity, E is the intensity of the electric field generated by the potential difference between the sensor tips, S is the section, and σ is the conductivity of the mixture that decreases as the mixing water is lost in the test specimens.\n\nIn , an explanatory flow diagram of the program developed for monitoring the moisture content inside the gypsum and plaster specimens during the setting process is shown.\n\nAs can be seen in , the Arduino programming code is divided into three blocks. The first consists of the initialization of variables and constants that will be used in it as well as the recognition of all the devices that intervene in the process and the verification of the sending of information from the sensor to the MicroSD card or the computer’s database. Second, is the automation of the sampling through a previously predetermined data capture period, which for the case of this work was considered five minutes during the seven days established by the UNE-EN 13279-2 standard for gypsum and plaster. The third and last was the creation of a single plain text file per test with the data: number of samples being carried out, percentage of humidity, and time at which the capture was carried out.\n\nFinally, it is necessary to highlight that the total cost of the designed Arduino humidity sensor was approximately 35 euros, this being a competitive price compared to other commercial humidity sensors on the market, such as hygrometers or inductive sensors, which have higher prices [37]. Also, the device used had the advantage of being able to carry out measurements in the variation of the moisture content of the samples from when the gypsum material was poured into the mold once it was kneaded; this presents great industrial advantages since data were obtained from the beginning of the setting of the paste and without the need to unmold the specimens to perform the measurements [28].\n\n2.2.2. Capacitive Sensor\n\nCapacitive sensors that base their operation on the action of an electric field have been used successfully in industry to measure physical parameters. Some authors have used this type of device to measure humidity in construction elements such as wood or cement mortars [23]. This type of sensor has the advantage of being easy to use and economically viable. In this work, a capacitive sensor linked to a self-oscillating circuit, like the one shown in , was developed. Using this system, it was possible to measure small variations in the loss of mixing water contained in the gypsum and plaster specimens as they hardened.\n\nIn this way, the implemented sensor consists of a flat-parallel plate capacitor with a surface area of 4×16cm2 corresponding to the side of the test specimens and which is part of a self-oscillating RLC (resistance–coil–capacitor) circuit. Copper plates that are conventionally used in the elaboration of printed circuits have been used, with a conductive copper face and the outer face insulated with bakelite to avoid measurement errors that could falsify the experiment. The operation of the measuring equipment was based on finding the resonance frequency of the circuit, that is, the one in which the current intensity that circulates was maximum and the pulsation was zero (XL−Xc=0). This resonant frequency was found by viewing the Lissajous figure corresponding to the composition of two signals that are in phase on the oscilloscope. In this way, according to the determination of said resonance frequency measured with the help of an oscilloscope, it is possible to know the variation in the moisture content of the materials tested employing Equation (4):\n\nLω=1Cω⟹f=12πLC[Hz]withC=ϵ·Ad[F]\n\n(4)\n\nwhere f is the resonance frequency in Hz, C is the capacitor capacity in F, L is the inductance of the sensor in H, Є is the permittivity of the dielectric (in this work of the wet specimen), A is the surface of the condenser plates m2, and d is the distance between the plates of 0.04 m corresponding to the thickness of the standard specimens.\n\nHowever, sometimes it is necessary to take into account factors that can influence the capacitance measurement. This is the case of edge effects that appear when the distance between plates is excessive; for this reason, it is recommended to use the corrected equation to calculate the capacitance:\n\nC=ε·l·ad·[1+lπ[ln(π·ad+1)+1+ln2]]\n\n(5)\n\nwhere l and a are the length and width, respectively, in m of the capacitor plates. Besides, it is advisable to always maintain the same ambient humidity in laboratory conditions to avoid the appearance of parasitic resistances that could harm the measurement. The importance of using shielded cables to avoid capacitive interference in the measuring equipment, and the need to ensure good contact between the copper plate and the gypsum or plaster material, should also be highlighted, thus avoiding the effect of air as a dielectric that could get in the way of taking measurements.\n\nTherefore, it is through the variation in the electrical permittivity of the material caused during the setting that the measurements related to the humidity of the sample are obtained. It is a very useful method that allows knowing the variation in the percentage of humidity in the specimens just before carrying out the mechanical tests, to subsequently establish relationships that allow the two variables to be related. In addition to being an alternative method to the traditional gravimetric tests, the system has a low cost, is easy to use, and its measurement is not only on the surface as are most commercial hygrometers [38].\n\n3.1. Arduino Sensor Monitoring\n\na shows the measurement equipment implemented in Arduino and responsible for monitoring the variation in the mixing water content of the test specimens, expressed in terms of percentage of humidity. The sampling time was five minutes for seven days, the time specified by the UNE-EN 13279-2 standard as the time necessary to allow the gypsum composite materials to set before testing their mechanical resistance. The sensors were duly calibrated by setting the value of 100% in the measure corresponding to the pouring of the material in the mold and replaced in the measure of the different specimens so as not to distort the results. In addition, and in order to avoid measurement errors, two sensors per specimen were used to counteract the validity of the results, and the mean value of both measurements is reflected in this work.\n\nIn parallel, the results obtained for each of the samples tested are shown in b. From the analysis of the figure, it can be seen how the variation in the content of mixing water collected by the sensor in the first three days is very scarce, being from that moment on where there is a sharp decrease in the percentage of water in the test specimens. On the seventh day collected by the UNE-EN 13279-2 standard as the age to carry out the mechanical tests, it can be seen how all the samples have reached zero or values close to it; this indicates variations in humidity not measurable by the sensor and the end of hardening of the studied samples. It can also be observed that the higher the mixing water content in the samples, the longer it takes to reach zero, and the specimens made with fine gypsum material took longer to lower their moisture content than the test specimens made with plaster.\n\nIn this way, the Arduino system presented was very useful to carry out simple and fast monitoring of the setting process and variation in the mixing water content of the test specimens made with gypsum materials. This monitoring finds an immediate application in industrial companies destined to the elaboration of precast since it allows to check if the hardening process of the samples is developing normally.\n\nIn addition to this monitoring, a thermogravimetric analysis was carried out with the help of the same equipment and techniques for powder samples at YF-0.8 and E35-0.7 dosages for test specimens aged 1, 4, and 7 days. As an example, , , and show the results of the thermogravimetric analysis of samples E35-0.7 at 1 and 7 days of age, and of samples YF-0.8 at 1 and 7 days of age, respectively. In the thermal analysis of all the specimens, three mass losses were observed, all corresponding to endothermic events. The first would correspond to the loss of free water, which occurred at a temperature below 100 °C, and which in the younger specimens, both plaster and gypsum, presents a maximum in the derivative of the mass at approximately 58 °C. This first loss of water is of much lower magnitude in the seven-day-old specimens and did not present a maximum in the curve derived from the mass.\n\nIn the temperature interval between 75 and 175 °C, the second mass loss occurs with a maximum in the derivative of the mass around 122–125 °C. This second loss presents a peak with a maximum in the derivative of the mass between 137 and 141 °C which constitutes the third mass loss of the sample. The second loss of mass was due to the dehydration of the dihydrate gypsum formed in the reaction of the hemihydrate with the mixing water; the third loss was due both to the dehydration of the hemihydrate formed in the second mass loss and to the dehydration of the original hemihydrate remaining in the test tube and from the original raw material which gives rise to soluble anhydrite. The exothermic phase change from soluble to insoluble anhydrite can be seen in all the test specimens with a maximum temperature of 351–355 °C.\n\nshows the mass loss, as a percentage concerning the original mass, of each of these three events, for the specimens of different ages as well as the total mass loss.\n\nTable 3\n\nSample *Mass LossCompositionTotal Δm (%)Δm H20 (%)Δm DH (%)Δm HH (%) %DH %HH E35-0.7-131.213.812.34.778.29.8E35-0.7-420.40.314.45.291.96.7E35-0.7-720.40.314.55.192.45.1YF-0.8-130.016.010.33.465.30.4YF-0.8-418.10.512.34.278.62.3YF-0.8-717.70.512.63.980.30.0\n\nIt was observed that the percentage of free water in the plaster specimen decreased from 13.8% in the youngest specimen to a value of 0.3% in the oldest specimen; in the gypsum specimen, these values decreased from 16% to 0.5%. This decrease was due both to the evaporation of the mixing water during drying and to the progressive hydration of the hemihydrate to form dihydrate.\n\nAccordingly, the loss of mass associated with the dehydration of the hemihydrate present in the specimen (second loss in the thermogram) increased in plaster samples from 12.3% to 14.5% with the increasing age of the specimen, while in the gypsum samples, the values evolved from 10.3% to 12.6% at the age of seven days. These values reflect the hydration of the hemihydrate that constitutes the raw materials to produce an increasing amount of dihydrate with the age of the specimen as the setting process occurs.\n\nThe amount of dihydrate (DH) and hemihydrate (HH) present in the test specimens were calculated from the second and third mass loss, taking into account the initial mass of each sample, the stoichiometry of reactions (1) and (2), and discounting the mass of hemihydrate formed in reaction (1) in calculating the amount of hemihydrate. The results are presented in the last two columns of .\n\nIn the plaster specimens, the dihydrate represents 78.2% of the youngest specimen and 92.4% in the oldest specimen. These values were, respectively, 65.3% and 80.3% for the fine gypsum specimens. The amount of hemihydrate in the plaster specimens decreased from 9.8% to 5.1% as the set progressed; these values were 0.4% and 0%, respectively, for the fine gypsum specimens.\n\nThese results show the evolution in the composition of the specimens throughout the setting process, with the progressive formation of dihydrate, responsible for the mechanical resistance of the gypsum compound as well as the progressive decrease in the free water of the sample (humidity) throughout the process [39]. Also, the results indicate that the plaster specimens present a higher amount of dihydrate than the plaster samples, according to the composition of the raw materials indicated in , and that it accounts for the higher mechanical strengths for these specimens.\n\n3.2. Tests Using the Capacitive Sensor\n\nshows the non-intrusive capacitive sensor developed for taking moisture measurements in the gypsum materials used in this investigation. This sensor allows us to know the variation in the moisture content in the test specimens over time and its determination at the exact moment of the mechanical tests.\n\nTo do this, first, and as shown in , a sensor calibration has been carried out to determine its behavior and relate the obtained capacitance values with the moisture content of the test piece. Thus, the initial measurement of capacitance collected with the sensor after removing the specimens was taken as a value of 100% in humidity and as a value of 0% the measurement of the specimen dried in an oven at a temperature of 50 ± 2 °C for 48 h. Said capacitances have been related to the determination of the humidity obtained by gravimetric methods according to the following Equation (5):\n\nM=Wnd−W0W0·100[%]\n\n(6)\n\nwhere Wnd is the humidity on day n studied and W_0 is the weight of the test piece in an anhydrous state dried in an oven.\n\nAs can be seen in , the capacitance values oscillate around 150 and 350 pF for the gypsum materials tested. You can see how there is a strong positive correlation when fitting the values using second-degree polynomial equations. At high humidity values, there are differences between the capacitance values among all the tested samples, observing higher capacitance values for the samples with the highest water/conglomerate ratio of each typology. For humidity values lower than approximately 50%, a single curve was obtained regardless of the material treated. Furthermore, it can be seen that the higher the water/conglomerate ratio, the higher the capacitance values are obtained regardless of the material treated.\n\nand show the results derived from the flexural and compression rupture tests at different ages concerning the moisture content of the specimen, carried out daily from day one after removal from the mold until reaching seven days. The techniques and recommendations of the UNE-EN 13279-2 [40] standard have been followed and a hydraulic press of the Autotest-200/10-SW model have been used to carry out the mechanical tests. Furthermore, all laboratory tests have been carried out under the same conditions of relative humidity and temperature (50 ± 5% and 22 ± 2 °C).\n\nAs can be seen after the analysis of and , the evolution of the mechanical strengths of the gypsum material test specimens tested develops, as there is a variation in the moisture content measured with the help of the capacitive sensor developed. It can be seen how the maximum levels of resistance are reached at the age of seven days set by the reference regulations and corresponding to the minimum levels of humidity determined with the equipment implemented. In turn, there is a significant change in the evolution of resistance in the transition between the fourth and fifth days, this period being in which the variations in water content of the test specimens have been more pronounced. Finally, and following other previous studies [41], the plaster material specimens have shown better performance in terms of mechanical resistance than their homologs made with gypsum, presenting higher resistance values than those that contained less amount of mixing water in origin.\n\nIn addition to the tests carried out, the analysis by X-ray diffraction was carried out on the test pieces YF-0.8 and E35-0.7. The results obtained are shown in .\n\nX-ray diffraction analysis for the specimens hardened at the age of seven days ( ) shows diffraction peaks located at angles of 11.6°, 20.7°, 29.1°, 23.4°, and 31.1° corresponding to dihydrate (DH), and did not show peaks corresponding to hemihydrate (HH). The diffractograms are practically coincident between the YF-0.8 and E35-0.7 specimens with the only exception that the diffraction peaks were more intense for the specimen made with plaster material.\n\nFinally, in , the confidence intervals for humidity, capacitance, flexural strength, and compressive strength were calculated for each day of measurements. These intervals were calculated to contain at least 75% of the data because the hypothesis of normality cannot be verified.\n\nTable 4\n\nIntervals for Humidity Expressed as a Percentage Day YF-0.6 YF-0.8 E35-0.7 E35-0.9 1(90.10, 100)(96.05, 100)(96.07, 100)(93.27, 100)2(88.56, 92.49)(91.58, 96.04)(94.1, 96.5)(80.1, 98.3)3(86.57, 88.97)(86.21, 93.65)(92.02, 95.98)(72.86, 89.14)4(79.00, 88.40)(65.83, 77.03)(85.53, 92.41)(64.08, 75.32)5(53.44, 68.16)(34.15, 56.31)(56.24, 82.16)(43.79, 71.27)6(28.23, 37.51)(14.36, 28.24)(7.67, 62.47)(6.19, 48.15)7(0, 16.56)(0, 6.42)(0, 21.9)(0, 15.75)Ranges for capacitance expressed in pFDayYF-0.6YF-0.8E35-0.7E35-0.91(242.29, 248.73)(274.69, 289.65)(266.52, 286.80)(320.25, 338.33)2(231.96, 239.04)(269.63, 278.75)(269.47, 280.11)(276.26, 322.5)3(227.68, 234.44)(252.94, 276.82)(267.02, 274.70)(242.49, 303.69)4(223.35, 236.15)(219.29, 230.89)(260.09, 261.85)(228.20, 259.56)5(186.64, 219.92)(180.48, 208.68)(198.34, 249.46)(187.22, 236.38)6(164.48, 189.72)(150.41, 173.54)(144.03, 221.31)(130.75, 199.75)7(145.97, 161.01)(145.57, 156.21)(145.64, 166.64)(127.74, 165.10)Intervals for flexural strength expressed in MPaDayYF-0.6YF-0.8E35-0.7E35-0.91(1.26, 1.58)(0.75, 0.95)(2.32, 2.55)(1.56, 1.72)2(1.67, 1.83)(0.91, 0.99)(2.42, 2.50)(1.49, 1.61)3(1.68, 1.80)(0.96, 1.28)(2.35, 2.51)(1.41, 1.77)4(1.70,1.94)(1.03, 1.23)(2.32, 2.56)(1.55, 1.67)5(2.20, 2.48)(1.21, 1.37)(3.08, 3.24)(1.85, 2.05)6(2.38, 2.58)(1.40, 1.56)(3.26, 3.58)(1.99, 2.11)7(2.54, 2.66)(1.61, 1.73)(3.43.3.59)(2.04, 2.20)Intervals for compressive strength expressed in MPaDayYF-0.6YF-0.8E35-0.7E35-0.91(1.94, 2.10)(0.91, 1.27) (4.41, 4.77)(2.12, 2.35)2(2.04, 2.44)(1.05, 1.65)(4.30, 4.78)(1.95, 2.35)3(2.56, 3.12)(1.21, 1.57)(4.63, 4.49)(2.09, 2.41)4(2.80, 3.14)(1.58, 1.98)(4.69, 5.13)(2.25, 2.77)5(5.69, 6.01)(2.17, 2.45)(5.94, 6.28)(3.02,3.22)6(5.92, 6.32)(2.64, 2.88)(6.28, 6.56)(3.21, 3.70)7(6.36, 6.36)(3.00, 3.20)(7.14,7.54)(3.49, 3.77)"
