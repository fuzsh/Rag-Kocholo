        "text": "Sunday, May 01, 1994 Page: 10B QUICK WORDS: IN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY,\n\nRE-ELECT STATE SEN. MUSTO\n\nEditor’s note: Today The Times Leader begins its series of editorial\n\nendorsements for the May 10 primary. This morning’s endorsement is for the\n\nDemocratic nomination for state senator in the 14th District. (The Republican\n\ncandidate, John Ford of Hazleton, is running unopposed.)\n\nMonday’s Times Leader will carry the endorsement for the Republican nominee\n\nfor governor. The Democratic gubernatorial endorsement will run on Tuesday.\n\nIn making these endorsements, The Times Leader’s editorial board is not\n\ntelling you what to think about the candidates. We’re telling you what we\n\nthink of them. And in doing so, we invite your response: We’ll publish as many\n\nelection-related letters as we can between now and Election Day.\n\n* * *\n\nHe’s the Wyoming Valley’s Tip O’Neill, a politician from the old school, an\n\nunapologetic glad-hander and baby-kisser who’s also plenty careful about keep\n\ning his constituents happy.\n\nHe’s good at it, too.\n\nAfter all, today State Sen. Ray Musto gets The Times Leader’s support to\n\nhang with the many other groups’ endorsements that he’s won for his wall.\n\nWhere were you in 1971, the year Charles Manson got convicted and “The\n\nFrench Connection” won Best Picture of the Year? Raphael J. Musto went to\n\nHarrisburg in 1971. He has been there or in Washington just about ever since.\n\nThat 23-years-and-still-counting political career is both Musto’s biggest\n\nliability and greatest asset. Ray Musto probably has stayed in politics too\n\nlong. Lengthy careers such as his are one reason voters approved term limits\n\nin 14 out of 14 states in 1992.\n\nAmericans are rightly suspicious of investing too much power in one person\n\nfor too many years, even when that person is Franklin Roosevelt.\n\nVoters also worry about “endless campaigns.” Most voters clearly suspect\n\npoliticians spend their hours trying to get reelected when they should be\n\nweighing the public’s best long-term interests .\n\nIn fact, if a candidate had surfaced this year who offered a dynamic\n\nalternative to Ray Musto, we might be suggesting that voters give their\n\nsupport to him or her.\n\nBut that didn’t happen.\n\nAnd so we come to Musto’s experience also being his greatest asset.\n\nWith Ray Musto, 14th District voters know what they will get. They’ll get a\n\nsenator who takes constituent complaints very, very seriously. Not many voters\n\nhang up disappointed after a call to Sen. Musto’s office.\n\nThey’ll get an outspoken supporter of libraries, fraternal groups,\n\nvolunteer fire companies and other cornerstones of Wyoming Valley life. Say\n\nwhat you will against WAMs, or Walking Around Money — and we have said plenty\n\nagainst them. The fact remains that Ray Musto uses this perfectly legal\n\ntechnique effectively. He has funneled state grants to many local projects\n\nthat needed and deserved the support.\n\n(True, a statue on Wilkes-Barre’s Public Square stretches anyone’s\n\ndefinition of charity. But Musto can be forgiven the Christopher Columbus\n\nstatue, especially since he has pledged not to pay for such a project again.)\n\nAnd voters know that, with Musto, they’ll be getting a senior state senator\n\nwith a background remarkably untouched by scandal.\n\nBoth of Musto’s opponents, Neil O’Donnell and Frank Trinisewski, deserve\n\ncongratulations for running honorable and very strong campaigns. This senate\n\nrace has been one of the best and most informative in years. The voters have\n\nbeen well served.\n\nHowever, neither candidate impresses enough to overcome Musto’s advantages\n\nof incumbency. Neil O’Donnell claims to be an outsider who’d bring an\n\noutsider’s voice to Harrisburg. But he’s from an insider family; the O’Donnell\n\nname carries almost as much weight in these parts as the name Musto.\n\nMore telling, he has enjoyed an insider’s career, and ran an old-fashioned,\n\ninsider’s political campaign. Neil O’Donnell has a fine future ahead. But\n\nwe’re not so sure he’d bring some new or dramatically reformist vision to the\n\nstate capital.\n\nAs for Frank Trinisewski — well, the three-term county commissioner and\n\ntwo-term Wilkes-Barre City Council member has clocked as much government time\n\nas Ray Musto has. But absent strong evidence that he’d make a better senator,\n\nwe see no reason to change warhorses in the middle of this stream.\n\nIt’s easy to scorn career pols such as Ray Musto in the abstract. In\n\nperson, though, Musto charms. He’s as blunt and as forceful as an old\n\ncoal-powered locomotive, and inspires some of the same affection, too. After\n\nall, coal-powered locomotives are antiques.\n\nIn any event, this classic style has served the anthracite region well. We\n\nsuggest Democratic voters would do well by giving Ray Musto their support on\n\nMay 10."
