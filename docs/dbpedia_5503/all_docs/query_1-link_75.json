In order to reach out to past awardees (and all future awardees) for their views on their work, we have developed a one-page, on-line “Self-Assessment Form (SAF).” As an initial effort, we are contacting Faculty Fellowship awardees from 1999 – 2014 and Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship awardees from 2006 – 2010 to ask for feedback using the SAF. In addition, we will use this form to communicate with all future awardees 18 months after their final report date.\n\nNotice of Final Report\n\nBeginning January 1, 2015 the guidelines for all of our grant and fellowships will include a new reporting requirement, specifically, a brief, one-page form titled “Notice of Final Report” (NFR). The submission of a Final Report to the Foundation will generate an email directing the Principal Investigator to a unique on-line NFR form. The completed form will give us the ability to quickly add information about the PI and the PI’s project to the Foundation’s web-based Archive.\n\n© 2024 The John Randolph Haynes and Dora Haynes Foundation.
