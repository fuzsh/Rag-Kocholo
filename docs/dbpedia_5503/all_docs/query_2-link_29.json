        "text": "As one drives west on Interstate 80 into central Pennsylvania, one cannot help but see one of the Pennsylvania Wilds (a.k.a. PA Wilds) roadside signs. Do not be confused. The PA Wilds has nothing to do with conservation and everything to do with making things cheery for chambers of commerce and the bidness community in general. Unlike New ork’s 6-million-acre Adirondack Park, of which more than half is now owned by the New York public, only scraps and pieces of the PA Wilds region is actually public land. The building of roads, sprawl housing and the like continues unabated. Appended to this blog posting is a cheery-sounding blurb from the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources regarding “PA Wilds.” Don’t be fooled. Real conservation means preserving the landscape as public land. Sportsmen and women and straight-on conservationists in this state would clamor and fight for an Adirondack-like land protection program involving public — non-game and hunter/fisher alike — dollars. Then we could have a real PA Wilds region, not just a slogan that chambers of commerce and tourist agencies could plaster across the top of maps and brochures.\n\nGrants available for business signs in PA Wilds\n\nA popular mini-grant program that helps businesses in the Pennsylvania Wilds region pay for new business signage has re-opened and is accepting applications through April 15.\n\nThe PA Wilds Business Signage Grants are designed to encourage businesses in the Pennsylvania Wilds to improve their prospects – and the look and feel of their communities—by utilizing thePennsylvania Wilds Design Guide in the creation and construction of new signage.\n\nThe Design Guide is a voluntary planning document that highlights how communities in the region can protect or enhance their rural character as they grow—whether that growth is due to tourism, drilling or other industries. It promotes such things as using natural materials or themes the region is known for—wood, stone, water, wildlife—in construction, design or landscaping.\n\n“The region’s rural and historic character and strong sense of place is part of what makes the Pennsylvania Wilds attractive to visitors and residents, so it is important for us to be good stewards of these characteristics as we grow,” said PA Wilds Planning Team Chair Matt Quesenberry, of Elk County. “Part of our job as the Planning Team is to give our communities tools to accomplish this. That’s what we’re trying to do with the Design Guide and our related grant programs.”\n\nThe Business Signage Grants are made possible by funding from DCNR with administrative support from the Lumber Heritage Region. Up to $1,500 is available for each grant; a dollar-for-dollar match is required. The process is competitive."
