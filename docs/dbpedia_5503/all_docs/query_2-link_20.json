John Yudichak (D-Luzerne) Thursday was again named Minority Chair of the Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committee by Senate Democratic Leadership; the only returning Environmental Committee Chair in either the Senate or House.\n\nSen. Yudichak was first elected to the Senate in 2010 after spending 13 years in the House. He followed long-time Senate Environmental Committee Chair Sen. Ray Musto (D-Luzerne).\n\nSen. Yudichak has provided leadership on enactment of the Growing Greener II Program which invests in reclaiming abandoned mine lands and restoring streams and promoted investments in renewable energy and creating green jobs.\n\nHe also supported a severance tax on Marcellus Shale natural gas drilling and a temporary moratorium on further leasing of state forest lands for Marcellus drilling.\n\nAs a member of the House, he was prime sponsor of the Waste Tire Act to provide funding for the removal of waste tire piles."
