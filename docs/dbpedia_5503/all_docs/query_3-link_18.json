Jonathan was my g-grandmother's father, her name was Sophronia, but at that time she was living in Waushara Co.with an unknown family named Snyder.\n\nGr Gr Grandfather Jonathan Mudget (t) lived in Lemonweir in 1870 with William Mudgett and Jonathan's sister Abigail who was listed as idiotic in the 1870 census. His sister was in the Northern State Hospital for the Insane (Winnebago State Hospital, now) in 1880, no mention of Jonathan in that census. I wonder if he died in that area during those 10 years. He was 50 years old. Any info would sure be appreciated. His daughter (my Gr Grandmother Sophronia) was in Plainfield, Waushara, Wisconsin living with the Henry Snyder family.
