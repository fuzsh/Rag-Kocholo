        "meta_description": "UR in Control &quot;Tommy Musto Mixes&quot; by Ezel &amp; Rona Ray, released 14 June 2024\n\n1. UR in Control (Zero Hour Interpreation)\n2. UR in Control (Zero Hour Interpretation Instrumental)\n3. UR in Control (Zero Hour Dub Mix)\n4. UR in Control (Zero Hour Radio Edit)\n\nOne of the most legendary figures in dance music history joins us for this new batch of remixes taken from Ezel &amp; Rona Ray&#39;s soulful LP &#39;Take Me Home&#39; We&#39;re speaking of famed American DJ/Producer Tommy Musto who brings his 2024 flair with his exquisite re-interpretation of &#39;UR in Control&#39;\r\n\r\nKnown for countless hits in the early 80s and through the 90s, Tommy has always been an instrumental force in the game, and one of the most reputable remixers, having done it for global stars like Michael Jackson and Celine Dion, but also somebody who has coined so many classic jams thru a host of numerous collaborations and aliases. His push and drive saw some of the greatest catalogs of music come to life as is the case of his run with Sub-Urban Rec and his well-regarded Northcott Productions that provided a spotlight for so many up-and-coming acts and independent labels that are now well-established and with legacy of their own.\r\n\r\nFor &#39;Ur in Control&#39; Tommy dived into some tasty Latin house percussion that drives sumptuous and lush keyboard and synth bass work gracefully lacing itself around the uplifting message and delivery that Rona provides with her vocals.\r\n\r\nThe B side finds a more reflective dub version, this is the type of dub mix that continues to find a new ceiling for what was achieved in the original, assuring a dancer&#39;s delight.\r\n\r\nA beautiful song with a powerful message gets further elevated with this special remix by a beloved figure coining yet again another modern classic.",
