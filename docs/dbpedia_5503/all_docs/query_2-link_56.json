        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) is highly successful at protecting the brain from entry of potentially detrimental substances. Unfortunately, greater than 99% of potential therapies are also greatly restricted from entering the brain [1,2]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop alternative delivery strategies for getting therapies around the BBB non-invasively. Intranasal (IN) delivery is a promising alternative to systemic administration that uses the direct anatomic pathway between the olfactory/trigeminal neuroepithelium of the nasal mucosa and the brain. Since only small amounts of a drug are delivered to the brain using this route, the mechanism of delivery needs to be better understood and new methods need to be developed to overcome the obstacles facing nose-to-brain delivery of promising therapeutics. The key to overcoming these challenges and furthering the field of IN delivery is to develop informative, non-invasive methodologies to better understand the nose-to-brain delivery pathway. One important tool at our disposal is through the use of in vivo imaging. In fact, imaging has great potential to facilitate the translation of promising IN therapies from animals to humans and improved imaging techniques continue to emerge. Prior to discussing the imaging aspect, we will introduce the concept of IN delivery, explore the latest information regarding the most likely path from nose-to-brain and discuss various types of therapies that would benefit from IN imaging assessment. In particular, we lay the groundwork for the importance of developing theranostic agents for both therapy and diagnosis in one platform.\n\nThe nasal cavity is well-suited for therapy delivery since the nasal mucosa has a high relative permeability, thin endothelial membrane and reasonable surface area for absorption of not only small molecules but also macromolecules such as proteins and peptides, nucleotides, viruses and even stem cells [3-5]. In particular, nose-to-brain therapy delivery has garnered high interest given the high failure rate of drugs that are unable to bypass the BBB [6]. Examples of difficult-to-treat central nervous system (CNS) diseases include brain malignancies, neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, seizures and psychiatric diseases, among others [7]. Understanding the mechanism of delivery and fate of drugs that can bypass the BBB is imperative to treating these debilitating and costly diseases [8].\n\nIN delivery offers several advantages over other routes of administration: It is relatively non-invasive, it avoids first-pass metabolism and its side effects can be minimized since other healthy organs are not exposed to the therapeutic compound [4]. Because of its non-invasive nature, there is a reduced risk of infection or disease transmission. Additionally, nasal spray formulations are easy to administer and can be performed at home by the patient. As with any route of delivery, however, there are challenges that must be overcome when using the nasal cavity for therapy delivery. Similar to the BBB, the nasal mucosal barrier poses IN delivery challenges, such as a physical boundaries provided by tight junctions, cellular membranes and enzymes in the mucosal milieu. In addition, certain environmental substances, including pathogens and allergens, can irritate the nasal mucosa and full delivery of a drug may be impaired when a patient has an active upper respiratory infection. Mucociliary clearance can also hinder the delivery of intranasally administered therapeutics. Thus, only a small percentage of the administered drug may arrive at the target site following IN delivery; so, a compound requiring relatively high concentrations for therapeutic efficacy may not be an ideal candidate for this route.\n\nAside from its purported role as a promising route of drug delivery, the nasal cavity normally serves important roles in respiration and smell while also providing a protective barrier against environmental insults [9]. The nasal anatomy in animals can differ widely relative to humans. For instance, the ratio of surface area to luminal volume in the nasal cavity of a rat is very different from that in humans (i.e., rat is 3350 mm2/cm3 and human is 820 mm2/cm3) [10]. The relatively larger dedication of olfactory mucosa to smell in rodents allows a particularly strong model for IN delivery, but a lower contribution of olfactory mucosa to smell in humans poses a challenge when interpreting drug efficacy results from rodent data. The anterior vestibule, the respiratory region and the olfactory region serve as three different anatomically distinct areas in the nasal cavity and only the respiratory and olfactory regions are thought to contribute to drug delivery ( and ) [9,10].\n\nThe respiratory epithelium is the largest of the three areas, is located more anteriorly within the nasal cavity, and produces the majority of the mucus, which is an additional barrier that intranasally delivered drugs must overcome for CNS delivery [11]. Drugs that overcome mucociliary clearance and make their way across the respiratory epithelium, such as naloxone and zolmitriptan, may be absorbed into the small blood vessels within the lamina propria, where they would avoid first-pass metabolism encountered with orally delivered agents, but would then still need to cross through the BBB from the systemic circulation [12]. The lamina propria of the respiratory epithelium also contains a high surface area of branches of the trigeminal neuron which, along with a multitude of small blood vessels, that provides a significant perineuronal and perivascular pathway for therapeutics to enter the brain [4,13-15]. For instance, Lochhead et al. used ex vivo fluorescence imaging (FLI) to show that bulk flow within the perivascular space of cerebral blood vessels contributes to the rapid central distribution of small-molecule, fluorescently labeled dextran tracers after IN administration in anesthetized adult rats [15]. Labeled macromolecules, such as interferon gamma [16], insulin-like growth factor [14], and most recently insulin [17], also demonstrated rapid uptake into the brain and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) spaces along the trigeminal route following IN administration.\n\nThe olfactory epithelium is the most posteriorly located epithelium of the nasal cavity ( and ), and is structurally different from the respiratory epithelium since it contains bipolar primary receptor neurons necessary for our sense of smell [18,19]. The olfactory epithelium overlies the cribriform plate and biopsy studies of humans indicate that the olfactory region may cover more of the nasal cavity than previously thought, extending to involve the middle turbinate ( and ) [9,20]. Like the respiratory epithelium, the olfactory neuroepithelium sits atop a highly cellular lamina propria that contains the axon fascicles as well as Bowmanâ€™s glands, blood vessels, and connective tissue ( ) [11]. However, the olfactory epithelium also contains the olfactory receptor neurons and olfactory ensheathing cells, which can serve as a means of direct intra-neuronal transport into the olfactory bulb of the brain. This direct transport is made possible if the cilia aid in cellular uptake of the therapy or provide an additional highway to the brain CSF spaces. The cilia also provide a similar highway along extensive perivascular and perineuronal spaces found with the trigeminal system within the lamina propria. The classically cited example of direct neuronal transport is wheat-germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, which was visible in neuronal axons and the olfactory bulb following IN delivery in mouse, rat and squirrel monkey [21]. However, intraneuronal transport is slow with studies indicating brain entry via the olfactory nerve taking 1.5-6 hours and even longer via the trigeminal nerve, taking from 17-56 hours [3]. Since several studies have confirmed rapid nose-to-brain delivery within minutes, the intra-neuronal pathway is probably not the primary route.\n\nIntranasal imaging\n\nIn humans, IN imaging studies have thus far been limited mostly to MRI, positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), with MRI being the most extensively utilized modality. Gamma scintigraphy, to our knowledge, has been used clinically in the context of IN imaging in one instance. Preclinical studies that utilize imaging offer a great deal of information about the fate of the delivered therapeutic and/or disease progression, which would enable the efficacy of novel IN therapies and their potential for clinical translation. So far, preclinical imaging studies have not only utilized MRI, PET and SPECT but also gamma scintigraphy as well as bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and fluorescence imaging (FLI). Ultrasound imaging, however, has not yet been used for IN imaging by virtue of the difficulties associated with transmitting and receiving acoustic waves across osseous structures using diagnostic ultrasound transducers in the clinical megahertz ranges. Nevertheless, ultrasound waves can be focused using specialized therapeutic focused transducers in order to enhance transmission and enable therapeutic benefits for IN drug delivery; this emerging approach, which is known as focused ultrasound-mediated drug delivery, will be briefly discussed later in this Review. A few CT studies have been used in humans and animals, mostly to study nasal anatomy and nasal flow dynamics. Combined PET and MR has perhaps the highest future potential for the assessment of the nose-to-brain route of drug delivery since they can combine both the high quantitation and sensitivity of molecular imaging with the high tissue contrast and spatial resolution of MRI. However, very few studies have been performed to date using this dual-modality approach which enables understanding of in vivo biological processes at a fundamental level. In subsequent paragraphs, we review each imaging modality and its contribution to understanding IN delivery from both a preclinical and clinical perspective."
