        "text": "Sunday, January 26, 1997 Page:\n\nMusto gunning for Brace in race; Pizzella runs Super Bowl ads\n\nRay Musto just never forgetsWhile he says he’s “not going to get into that\n\ncounty controller fight,” Musto doesn’t hesitate to tell anybody who’ll listen\n\nthat the one guy he’ll do what he can to knock out of the box is Bill Brace.\n\nMusto has been carrying a grudge in his craw against Brace going back to\n\nwhen Brace backed Mike Conahan, when Conahan and Joe Musto battled for the\n\ncounty judgeship that Conahan won.\n\nMusto’s also still ticked that Brace was for Neil O’Donnell against him in\n\nthat state Senate nominating primary a few years ago that also included Frank\n\nTrinisewski.\n\nMusto beat O’Donnell and Trinisewski, of course, and went on to win another\n\nstate Senate term, which he’s serving in now.\n\nBrace, who is Wilkes-Barre City Clerk, is in the field of Democratic\n\ncandidates for county controller in the May 20 primary. The others are Frank\n\nPizzella of Plains and, supposedly, Tom Pisano of Exeter.\n\nMusto doesn’t have much to say about Pizzella and Pisano, but mention Brace\n\nand he boils over.\n\n“Brace has a lot of nerve asking for the Democratic Executive Committee’s\n\nendorsement,” Musto says.\n\n“When I was the Executive Committee’s endorsed candidate for the state\n\nSenate in the primary of 1994,” Musto says, “Brace went out and tried to knock\n\nmy head off.”\n\nBrace, Musto practically rages, “has never done anything for the Democratic\n\nParty in all the years he’s been a Democrat, if that’s what he really is, and\n\nhe’s selfish and has never been a team player.”\n\nMusto says Brace “will have trouble in the city” and from him as well.\n\n“I’m against Brace and he’s going to find that out on election day,” Musto\n\nsays.\n\nBrace supposedly went to county Democratic Chairman Jimmy Bach and asked\n\nhim for the Democratic endorsement for controller, something Brace denies, but\n\nBach turned him down. Bach says there aren’t going to be any endorsements\n\nuntil some time in May. Musto didn’t like it one bit that Brace supposedly\n\nwent to Bach for the endorsement.\n\nWhen he was told that Musto was out to chop him up, Brace said, “I know\n\nhe’s mad at me because I backed Mike Conahan in the city in that judgeship\n\nprimary election, but I can’t worry about that because I have a campaign to\n\nrun.”\n\nBrace says he was for Conahan because they have been personal friends going\n\nback years and years, and as far as supporting O’Donnell, Brace says “Neil is\n\na friend of mine, too.”\n\nAll of that, Brace says, is in the past. “Past elections are past,” he\n\nsays. “And, besides, I have nothing personal against Sen. Musto; in fact, I\n\nrespect him and I think he’s doing a good job in Harrisburg.”\n\nBrace says his campaign is doing very well.\n\n“I have fund-raisers scheduled for all around the county; I’ll have $100 a\n\nticket get-together on Jan. 31, that’s this coming Friday, at the Ramada and\n\nthen I’ll have others in Hazleton and Pittston and elsewhere,” he says.\n\nMoneybags Pizzella\n\nFrank Pizzella is telling everybody that he has bought up tons of\n\nadvertising — television, radio, buses, billboards and so on — in his\n\ncampaign to grab the Democratic nomination for county controller.\n\nIn fact, they were saying Pizzella has two ads on Fox 38’s broadcast of the\n\nSuper Bowl today.\n\nTo advertise like that, you really need serious money.\n\nPizzella, a Plains Township commissioner, claims he’s “loaded with cash”\n\nand won’t hesitate to turn it loose to win in the May 20 primary.\n\nMoney is the mother’s milk of politics, so they say.\n\nYencha not being turned\n\nIf you saw that ad in both newspapers on January 20 congratulating Greg\n\nSkrepenak, Rocket Ismail and Bucky Greeley for helping the Carolina Panthers\n\nto a winning season, you might be wondering why Republican John Yencha’s name\n\nwas included in it along with the names of Democrats Alice Corba, Sally\n\nJervis, Mike Rushton.\n\nThe way the ad was presented anybody reading it naturally would conclude\n\nthat here are the four incumbent Wilkes-Barre School Board candidates in this\n\nyear’s elections running as a “team.”\n\nBut that’s really not the case.\n\nAccording to Yencha, he got a brief look at the original copy of the ad,\n\nwhich was signed “Paid for by Committee to Reelect Corba, Jervis, Rushton,\n\nYencha,” and didn’t object to it being printed in the newspapers. To him, it\n\nseemed like a nice tribute toward those three star football players.\n\nAnd even though it looked very much like he was part of a\n\nCorba-Jervis-Rushton “team,” that’s not the way it is.\n\n“I’m still on my own,” Yencha says.\n\nEven though Yencha keeps saying that, Rushton still thinks he can turn him\n\nto Democrat so they’ll have an all-Democratic team for the School Board\n\nelections.\n\nGood luck, Mike. Just don’t hold your breath on that one.\n\nBurns picks campaign chief\n\nDemocratic prothonotary candidate Jim Burns has picked Bob Savakinus of\n\nHudson, an active member of the Young Democrats, as his campaign director.\n\nBurns, saying he “senses change in the air,” is challenging incumbent\n\nDemocratic prothonotary Gene Duffy for the Democratic nomination on May 20.\n\nThis is Burns’s third crack at a county row office nomination. He\n\npreviously ran for county controller against the late Joe Tirpak, and for\n\nrecorder of deeds against the incumbent Frank Castellino. Burns lost both\n\ntimes.\n\nJoey “I” aims at Toole\n\nIt looks like Michael Lombardo, son of Dr. Joseph Lombardo, is going to\n\nchallenge incumbent Pittston Mayor Tom Walsh for the Democratic nomination for\n\nmayor in the May 20 primary.\n\nWord out of Pittston is that Joey Infantino is putting together a ticket to\n\ntry to take out Walsh and incumbent Democratic Councilmen John Argo and Jim\n\nKolmansberger.\n\nLombardo would head the Infantino slate, which also would include\n\nInfantino’s son Charlie. The second council candidate on this slate hasn’t\n\nbeen chosen just yet.\n\nInfantino — they call him Joey “I” — would like to call the shots at City\n\nHall so he can get rid of his arch enemy, City Clerk Wil Toole.\n\nKnowing he’ll be out if Walsh and the incumbent councilmen lose, Toole has\n\nbeen shopping for a county job, which he’s not likely to ever get because\n\nInfantino is close with Tom Makowski and is sure to keep Toole blocked out as\n\nlong as he can.\n\nToole is said to have tried to smooth things over with Joey “I”, but never\n\ngot to first base.\n\nBy the way, Mayor Tom Walsh is a wonderful guy.\n\nThe way it was\n\nJust to set things straight for the guys on the Wilkes-Barre City Council.\n\nMike McGinley did not — repeat: did not — “run to the newspaper” with the\n\nstory about him and you other guys on the council that was in this space last\n\nSunday.\n\nThe sources for that story, and the story about Tommy McGroarty and\n\nMcGinley as well, weren’t McGinley or anybody in the McGinley family.\n\nBoth of those stories came out of connections other than the McGinleys.\n\nJust wanted to clear that up.\n\nColumnist Bill Griffith’s notes on county and city politics appear on\n\nSunday."
