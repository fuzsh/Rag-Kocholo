        "text": "Indictment lands blow to Musto's legacy mi By Michael R. Sisak Staff Writer Three decades ago, as Raphael J. Musto took the oath of office to fill the congressional seat vacated in disgrace by longtime U.S. Rep. Daniel J .\n\nFlood, he pledged to serve with the \"pride and integrity\" that had been missing from the final, bribe-pocked years of Flood's career Tuesday, as Musto neared the denouement of his own legislative journey from the Pennsylvania House of Representatives to Washington to a 28-year career in the state Senate in Harrisburg a federal grand jury returned him to the company of Flood with allegations he pocketed bribes, solicited favors and lied to investigators. Musto, federal prosecutors said, traded the pride and integrity of his first day in Congress, and the duty of his public service, for tens of thousands of dollars in cash and free renovations from a construction contractor, and took additional kickbacks from a local government official. Musto is accused of selling his \"oath of office to the highest bidders,\" Special Agent George C. Venizelos of the FBI said, striking \"a blow both to the heart of good government and to the security and integrity of our communities.\" A blow, too, to a legacy built over a career spanning four decades and three offices, and to a family whose name has been synonymous with public risburg and running the family grocery store in Pittston Township. Musto, described in an early campaign mailer as accomplished butcher, would tend to the store's meat counter while his father was on legislative duty He would take grocery orders over the phone, deliver the same orders and chat with customers about the events of the day At the same time, according to the campaign mailer, Musto served as chief dispatcher, driver and firefighter for the township fire department, whose headquarters were located next to the store .\n\nThe township fire department, the mailer says, did not have a telephone so residents \"got in the habit\" of calling the store and reporting fires to Musto, \"who would drop everything, run next door to the fire house, sound the alarm, and then jump into the fire truck and drive it to the scene.\" Musto's service, in the grocery store, the fire department and the U.S. Army eventually translated into a career in Congress and the state Senate and served as a template of service for his siblings and a niece. A brother, Gerard, was a longtime superintendent of the Pittston Area School District. Another brother, Joseph J. Musto, has twice been named to serve as an interim judge in Luzerne County Court and was nominated earlier this year to serve as county court administrator His niece, Jackie Musto Carroll, is district attor with Daniel J .\n\nFlood in THE CITIZENS' VOICE ARCHIVES this November 1980 file ney of Luzerne County \"The word 'family' has always had very special meaning for Ray Musto,\" the long-ago campaign mailer says. \"From the days he spent filling his father's shoes at home, to the present, Ray Musto's life has been greatly entwined with his family\" Musto's stint in Congress, begun in the wake of corruption, ended with an exoneration in the Abscam investigation, an FBI sting operation which led to charges against a U.S. senator, six congressmen, a New Jersey state senator and members of the Philadelphia City Council in the late 1970s and 1980s. FBI agents posing as Middle Eastern businessmen invited Musto to a Philadelphia hotel and offered a bribe in exchange for political favors. Musto refused and walked out .\n\nDecades later, federal prosecutors said, Musto's will-power waned and the promises of pride and integrity that accompanied his Congressional oath of office faded. \"Public corruption is, quite simply betrayal of the public's trust,\" Venizelos said. \"When public officials are alleged to have violated the trust placed in them by the citizens that they serve for their own personal benefit or enrichment, it erodes public confidence, undermines the strength of our democracy and threatens the very integrity of our government.\" msisak citizensvoice.com, 570-821-2061 Point. A township supervisor says he and others were questioned by the FBI about meetings with Musto and Mericle on the project. U.S .\n\nAttorney Peter J.

Musto first entered public office in 1971, filling the unexpired state House of Representatives term of his late father, state Rep. James Musto.

Federal prosecutors have not named Mericle's construction company as the \"Company that allegedly rewarded Musto for his influence over state development funds with renovation bargains and holiday gifts .\n\nBut in April, FBI agents armed with a subpoena did inspect records of Mericle's renovations to a Musto-owned building a renovation project that closely matches the work 4 112410 Mericle's name again with corruption case Musto recovered quickly, winning election to the state Senate in 1982 and remaining in office, a fixture of Northeastern Pennsylvania politics and leadership, ever since. Musto said the investigation that culminated in his indictment Tuesday had no influence on his decision to retire from the state Senate, maintaining his stance that he had no knowledge of the probe in January, when he announced he would not seek re-election to an eighth-term. \"Senator Musto has served surfaces in performed by \"Company Mericle has been in legal limbo since 2009, when he pleaded guilty to failing to report a felony in connection with $2.15 million in payments his company made to former Luzerne County judges Michael T.

Mericle's sentencing has been put off indefinitely because he is expected to be a faithfully and honestly for over 40 years as an elected public official,\" Musto's attorney Jack Riley said Tuesday in a statement casting doubt on the veracity of the grand jury's charges. \"He has never wavered from his dedication to the people he has served while in office.\" Musto, the eldest of eight children, learned the values of hard work and public service from his father and family serving as the de facto head of the household while his father was serving in Har connection key prosecution witness at Ciavarella's trial next year and the value of his testimony could affect his eventual sentence.

Mericle was most likely to come up in business-like discussions of job creation, real estate and philanthropy Now it's just as likely to come up in reports of plea agreements, grand-jury subpoenas and pay-to-play political corruption.
