        "text": "PITTSTON, Pa. (AP) - A Pennsylvania lawmaker says he doesn't know what federal agents were looking for during a two-hour search of his home.\n\nState Sen. Ray Musto says he was not told the purpose of the search and denied any wrongdoing following the search of his home in Pittston, near Wilkes-Barre.\n\nThe 81-year-old Democrat says he told the agents to do whatever they needed to do. Musto theorized that his name may have come up as part of an ongoing public corruption probe in Luzerne and Lackawanna counties.\n\nAgents removed at least three bags of items from Musto's home on Thursday afternoon. An FBI spokesman declined to comment on the reason for the search.\n\nMusto has served 27 years in the state Senate. He announced in January that he would not seek re-election."
