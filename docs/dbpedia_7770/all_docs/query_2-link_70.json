His goal was to help consumers better understand the quality of care at the health care providers they choose and what questions to ask before treatment.\n\nLearn more about Indiana’s Medical Error Reporting program »\n\nView the 2013 Medical Error Report and IHA's response.\n\nTypes of Reportable Adverse Events\n\nToday, Indiana hospitals are required to report on the National Quality Forum’s consensus list of 28 serious adverse events.\n\nSurgical Events\n\nSurgery performed on a wrong body part\n\nSurgery performed on the wrong patient\n\nThe wrong surgical procedure performed on a patient\n\nForeign objects left in a patient after surgery or other invasive procedure\n\nDeath during or immediately after surgery of a normal, healthy patient (ASA Class I)\n\nProduct or Device Events\n\nThese include patient death or serious disability associated with:\n\nThe use of contaminated drugs, devices or biologics provided by the facility\n\nThe use or function of a device in patient care in which the device is used or functions other than as intended\n\nAn intravascular air embolism that occurs while being cared for in a facility\n\nPatient Protection Events\n\nAn infant discharged to the wrong person\n\nPatient death or serious disability associated with patient elopement (i.e. disappearance)\n\nPatient suicide or attempted suicide resulting in serious disability while being cared for in a health care facility\n\nCare Management Events\n\nThese include patient death or serious disability:\n\nAssociated with a medication error\n\nAssociated with a hemolytic reaction due to incompatible blood or blood products\n\nAssociated with hypoglycemia, the onset of which occurs in the facility\n\nAssociated with hyperbilirubinemia in newborn infants\n\nAs well as the following:\n\nDue to joint movement therapy\n\nMaternal death or serious disability associated with labor or delivery in a low-risk pregnancy while being cared for in the hospital\n\nStage 3 or 4 pressure ulcers acquired after admission to a facility\n\nArtificial insemination with the wrong donor sperm or wrong egg\n\nEnvironmental Events\n\nThese include patient death or serious disability associated with:\n\nAn electric shock while being cared for in a facility\n\nA burn incurred while being cared for in a facility\n\nThe use of restraints or bedrails while being cared for in a facility\n\nA fall while being cared for in a facility\n\nAny incident in which a line designated for oxygen or other gas to be delivered to a patient contains the wrong gas or is contaminated by toxic substances\n\nCriminal Events\n\nThese include any instance of care ordered by or provided by someone impersonating a physician, nurse, pharmacist or other licensed health care professional, including:\n\nAbduction of a patient of any age\n\nSexual assault on a patient within or on the grounds of a facility\n\nDeath or significant injury of a patient or staff member resulting from a physical assault that occurs within or on the grounds of a facility\n\nWhen to Report\n\nOnce a hospital’s quality assessment and improvement program determines a serious adverse event has taken place, it must be reported to the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) within 15 days. The data elements being reported are name of the hospital, type of event and quarter of the year in which it occurred. These data are filed electronically with the ISDH. Data is made publically available annually.\n\nAdverse Events vs. Errors\n\nMost of the 28 reportable events are preventable medical errors that result in death, serious disability or significant injury. Others events, such as abduction or sexual assault, simply shouldn't happen, regardless of whether they result in death or serious disability."
