State-by-state information\n\nFederal\n\nThe president’s constitutional authority to pardon is unlimited and considered unreviewable in the courts. The president has relied historically upon advice from the Department of Justice. Under justice clemency rules, a person becomes eligible to apply for a pardon five years after imposition of sentence or release from confinement; there is no public hearing and no limit on time for decision. A pardon relieves legal disabilities and signifies rehabilitation, but it does not expunge or seal the record. Presidential pardons have been sparing since 1980 and the process irregular under the incumbent president. (Sentence commutations, the other main form of executive clemency, have also been infrequent under most recent presidents.)\n\nRead more\n\nAlabama\n\nAn independent board appointed by the governor exercises pardon power independent of the governor, except in capital cases. The board must make an annual report to governor. A person is eligible to apply upon completion of sentence or after three years of permanent parole. The application form is simple (“intended to facilitate application by individuals who lack formal education”) and is filed with the local probation office. A public hearing is required, with notice to officials and victim, with reasons given if denied. There is a separate paper procedure for restoration of civil rights, also available to people with federal and out-of-state convictions. The effect is as specified in grant, but a pardoned conviction is not sealed and serves as a predicate. Pardons are frequent and the process regular and governed by statute; process takes about one year. More than 500 full pardons are granted each year, 80% of those who apply, plus many more rights restorations.\n\nRead more\n\nAlaska\n\nThe pardon power is vested in the governor, who is advised by an informal executive clemency advisory committee. Applications are submitted to the parole board whose staff determines eligibility by unstated criteria. If a person is deemed eligible, the parole board investigates, consults with DA and sentencing court, and prepares a confidential recommendation to the governor. There is no provision for a hearing. Pardon sets aside the conviction but does not expunge it; conviction may not serve as a predicate or be the basis of denial of a license, though underlying conduct may be considered. There have been no pardon grants in Alaska since 2006, when the pardon program was suspended by the legislature until January 2018. Despite the establishment of a rigorous administrative review process at that time, there have been no grants since then.\n\nRead more\n\nArizona\n\nBy statute, the governor’s authority to act depends upon receiving an affirmative recommendation from the board of executive clemency, which must conduct a public hearing and publish its recommendations to the governor with its reasons. The governor must report pardons, with reasons, to the legislature. Pardon relieves the legal consequences of conviction, but it does not expunge the record, and a pardoned conviction may be used as a predicate. Since the 1980s, Arizona governors have granted only a handful of pardons a term. As pardons have become increasingly rare the Board has heard fewer pardon cases.\n\nRead more\n\nArkansas\n\nThe governor has the constitutional power to pardon but is required by statute to consult the parole board for a non-binding recommendation before making a grant. The board and governor must each give 30 days’ public notice of intention to recommend or grant, stating their reasons, and the governor is constitutionally required to report to the legislature on all grants. Pardon relieves legal disabilities (except the right to hold office which is restored only by expungement) and is grounds for automatic sealing in all but cases involving serious violence; a pardoned conviction may not serve as predicate or to enhance a subsequent sentence. Firearms rights must be expressly restored in the pardon document, and they may also be separately restored by the governor. Pardons are frequent and the process regular and governed by statute: pardons are issued on a regular monthly basis throughout the year, about 100 each year and about 25% of those who apply.\n\nRead more\n\nCalifornia\n\nThe governor’s constitutional power to pardon first felony offenders is unlimited, and he is authorized but not required to consult with the parole board. In cases where an applicant has more than one felony conviction, the constitution provides that a pardon may not issue except upon the affirmative recommendation of four supreme court justices, and in such cases he is by statute required to consult with the parole board. A judicial certificate of rehabilitation is ordinarily the first step in the pardon process, and the parole board must make a recommendation to the governor within one year of receiving a certificate. Pardon restores civil rights and removes occupational bars but does not expunge record and may be used as predicate. A pardon must specifically restore firearms rights. Under the most recent governors, a regular pardoning practice has been reestablished after a decade of neglect, but no data is available on the grant rate (measured by number of certificates received).\n\nRead more\n\nColorado\n\nThe governor’s constitutional power is subject to regulation in the manner of applying, and the governor must report all grants to the legislature each year, with reasons for each. Before acting favorably on an application, the governor must seek the views of the district attorney, sentencing judge, and prosecuting attorney. The department of corrections is informally responsible for administering the pardon power, and the governor is advised by a non-statutory 7-member board of appointees, including corrections and law enforcement officials. Applications are generally not accepted until 10 years after completion of sentence, and there is no hearing. Pardon restores civil and firearms rights, signals rehabilitation and good character, but does not authorize sealing. Until the final 18 months of Gov. Hickenlooper’s term (17-18), the pardon power had not been functioning in Colorado in a meaningful fashion for many years, and the current governor has reconstituted the pardon board.\n\nRead more\n\nConnecticut\n\nPardons are issued pursuant to a formal process by an independent board appointed by governor.
