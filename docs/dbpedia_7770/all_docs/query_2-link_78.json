        "text": "Diehard libertarian Ron Paul won the annual \"straw poll\" contest at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, DC last week, just as he did in 2010. But the real winner may have been Mitch Daniels.\n\nThe two-term Indiana governor, who's preparing to announce his candidacy for the presidency in 2012, gave a lengthy, well-received speech to the Reagan banquet in which he called the federal deficit the \"new red menace\", referring, of course, to red ink, but cleverly evoking the right's Communist threat of old. For a man whose studied oratory is often considered too dry and subdued to fire up a crowd, that's about as pep rally-friendly as Daniels ever gets. And it probably won't be enough, even though he's widely regarded as the kind of GOP candidate that could actually beat President Obama, assuming the economy's still foundering two years from now.\n\nWhy the optimism? His sterling fiscal record as governor, for one. It's made him something of a legend among conservatives, and has big money backers waiting to support him. When he was first sworn into office in January 2005, Indiana faced a $600m deficit and a subpar credit rating. But over the next three years, he reduced the state's rate of spending growth from 5.9% to 2.8%, shaving $450m off the deficit. And by 2009, the state sported $1.3bn in cash reserves, giving it one of the highest credit ratings in the nation.\n\nAmazingly, Daniels over this same period also managed to enact the largest tax cut in Indiana history, slashing property taxes alone by one third. And he did all this while working with a Democrat-controlled lower house, earning him the bipartisan kudos that's been in short supply with Republicans nationally. It's small wonder that Daniels cruised to re-election by a whopping 18 points in 2008, the same year that Obama narrowly took the state, and the presidency, and the Democrats swept to power.\n\nDaniels sports another important feather in his cap: he's already enacted free market-friendly, patient-centered healthcare reform. His Healthy Indiana Programme (HIP) helps state residents who can't qualify for Medicaid enroll in individual health-savings accounts, and the state contributes up to $1,100 per enrollee to these accounts on a sliding, income-dependent scale. The dollars are controlled, and owned, by the individual to spend on health services as he or she sees fit, with almost no interference from government or insurance-company bureaucrats.\n\nTo date, some 50,000 Hoosiers are enrolled in the plan, and only current federal regulations, which Daniels opposes, have prevented tens of thousands more from enjoying its benefits of the plan. It's not at all clear how well HIP would work at the federal level, but it's an alternative model, and that's enormously compelling to Republicans at a time when American voters are leaning toward scaling back, if not repealing, Obamacare. And it makes Daniels an attractive alternative to former Republican Governor Mitt Romney, whose decision to implement an \"Obamacare\"-style healthcare programme while serving as Massachusetts' chief executive has already damaged his presidential prospects, perhaps fatally.\n\nDaniels also does surprisingly well with minorities, which is important to GOP moderates who recognise that long-term voter demographics currently favour the Democrats. In his re-election bid in 2008, Daniels won 20% of the black vote, more than double what Republicans typically take at the national level. And his 37% share of the Latino vote exceeded the 30% for McCain, and 20-25% that most Republicans garnered before the arrival of George W Bush. But Daniels, unlike Newt Gingrich and other GOP contenders, has yet to articulate a comprehensive policy position on the hot-button immigration issue. He says he support Arizona's law for Arizona, but isn't sure it's needed in Indiana. He'll have to say a lot more than that if he expects to maintain the support of the far right, while still convincing Latinos that he's prepared to do more than simply ratchet up enforcement.\n\nUndoubtedly Daniels' no-nonsense, results-oriented pragmatism and successful track record as governor could make him highly appealing to those independents who are still disenchanted with Obama. But social conservatives, who already adore Sarah Palin and Mike Huckabee, are deeply suspicious of Daniel's recent – and eminently common-sensical – statements urging Republicans to declare a \"truce\" on culture war issues and focus on the economy. A truce wasn't much in evidence last week when the major social conservative groups boycotted CPAC because of the presence of GOProud, a Republican gay advocacy group. Huckabee and Palin skipped the event, and other GOP hopefuls, including Senator Rick Santorum, as well as radio host Rush Limbaugh, have already blasted Daniels for his remarks.\n\nRight now, Daniels has a shot at grabbing the national spotlight, and with the right business support, might eventually overtake Romney. But it will take more than a fawning introduction by conservative columnist George Will to convince Republicans that Daniels is a \"thinking man's Marlon Brando\" – or that they even want one. Will was referring to the fact that Daniels drives a Harley Davidson, and projects an iconoclastic image. But despite his sterling record, the short (5'7\"), thin, soft-spoken Daniels doesn't have the charismatic or forceful personality that normally transforms a politician with gravitas and smarts into a full-fledged statesman, the kind his Democratic opponent in 2012 already has.\n\nOn a bad day, Daniels looks and sounds less like Reagan, or Brando, or even Bill Clinton, than another diminutive wonk: Democrat Michael Dukakis, who won his party's nomination but whose campaign never really left the starting blocks. Daniels made a great debut last week, arriving at the starting line with his engine revving. But if he expects to stay in the running, amid an unusually crowded GOP field, he'd better get into gear – and soon."
