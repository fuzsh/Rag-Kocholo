        "text": "Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels was in Evansville Wednesday, the end of the three-day trip to cities and town in the southwestern part of the Hoosier State.\n\nThis morning, Daniels met with reporters, answering question for more than 30 minutes, about a variety of issues, including President Bush's Supreme Court nomination and the what's next for Daylight Saving Time in Indiana.\n\nDaylight Saving Time was turned into a political hot potato for the first-term governor. In April, the Indiana General Assembly made history when, after decades of saying no, finally said yes to statewide observance of the time policy.\n\nThe vote passed when Vincennes state representative Troy Woodruff (R), literally at the eleventh hour, voted in favor of the measure. However, Dave Crooks (D-Washington), had placed language in the bill that required the governor to ask the U.S. Department of Transportation to hold hearing time zones in Indiana.\n\nCrooks, who was removed from the conference committee working out language on the House version of the bill, wants to see all of Indiana observing Central Time. This week, DOT sent Daniels a letter, saying officials from each county who want to change time zones in their areas, would have to notify the federal agency, which would then decide if a hearing should be held. \"It's going to be a bottom-up process,\" Daniels said. \"Now is the time for people to speak up and indicate if people would like to move from one time zone to another.\"\n\nWhen asked if Indiana could end up a crazy quilt of time zones with adjacent counties on different times, Daniels said DOT has requirements for areas in each time zone. \"That clearly will not happen,\" Daniels said. \"One of the dictates of the statute that they operate under is that they don't leave islands for the kind of … patchwork arrangement that would otherwise occur. The Central Time zone may well expand from west to east … but it will be in a logical pattern.\"\n\nWhen asked if kicking the controversial question of time zones back to the county level was a way for Daniels to dodge a political football, the governor said, \"I just think it would be absolutely the wrong thing for anybody to sit in Indianapolis or anywhere else and try to dictate this answer. The issue that I addressed as a candidate and then as governor, was the one that was costing us jobs and income. And that was not the location of the time zone line but the half and half system that Indiana, and only Indiana, operated.\"\n\nDaniels said the number one priority was to grow jobs in the state. \"Exactly where the time zone line ought to be I think is the quintessential question which ought to start at the local level and let people everywhere speak to it themselves\"\n\nDaniels was asked if he wanted to keep the decision at a local level, why did he contact the federal government. \"I was just trying to help them understand the geography of Indiana, I was just trying to speed the process along. I like the idea, frankly, of them soliciting lots of information before the set that schedule,\" Daniels said.\n\nDaniels was asked about the progress of the I-69 extension that would provide a direct link between Evansville and Indianapolis. \"We're out to advance the schedule any way we can,\" Daniels said. A group from the Indiana Department of Transportation and DOT are in Texas, according to Daniels, are in Texas, looking at private funding options that state has used. \"The old way to build a road will be the slow way to build I-69,\" Daniels said.\n\nDaniels, a Republican who worked for the George W. Bush administration, made several points at the beginning of the press conference, including his support for President Bush's nomination for Supreme Court Justice of John Roberts, Jr. Roberts is a Washington D.C. Circuit Court judge, appointed in 2003, a Hoosier native and \"someone I know.\" \"This is just a home run appointment,\" Daniels said. \"I cannot conceive of a reason other than blind partisanship that anyone would oppose this nomination.\""
