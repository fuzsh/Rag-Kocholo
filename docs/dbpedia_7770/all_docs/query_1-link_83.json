        "text": "The former Indiana governor is a favourite among social conservatives and boasts considerable experience in Washington.\n\nMr Pence was raised Roman Catholic along with his five siblings in Columbus, Indiana, and says he was inspired by liberal icons John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nHe is known for his staunch opposition to abortion, signing a bill to ban abortion in Indiana on the basis of disability, gender or race of the foetus.\n\nHe has said he would favour overturning a 1973 Supreme Court judgement, often referred to as the Roe v Wade case, which bars the US government from prohibiting abortions.\n\nWomen's rights advocates have mounted online campaigns against his views, including asking people to call his office to tell them about their periods or to make donations to family-planning organisations in Mr Pence's name.\n\nHe served as the chair of the House Republican Conference, the third highest-ranking Republican leadership position.\n\nHe also chaired the Republican Study Group, a coalition of conservative House Republicans, which could give him a boost with some evangelicals of the party that have questioned Mr Trump's ideological purity, the BBC's Anthony Zurcher says.\n\nWho is Mike Pence?\n\nThe president initially nominated the retired Marine General to oversee Homeland Security before promoting him to chief of staff, replacing Reince Priebus.\n\nMr Kelly was a key influence on the decision to fire the director of communications, Anthony Scaramucci, after just 10 days in office.\n\nThe former four-star general, whose military career spans four decades, quit as head of the military's Southern Command, which oversees military activities in Latin America and the Caribbean, to join the Trump administration.\n\nMr Kelly is the highest-ranking military officer to lose a child in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nHis son Robert, a first lieutenant in the Marines, was killed in combat when he stepped on a landmine in Afghanistan in 2010.\n\nThe seasoned commander had previously clashed with the Obama administration on illegal immigration at the US-Mexican border.\n\nIn December Mr Trump said Mr Kelly would leave his post by the end of the year. It followed reports that the relationship between the two had deteriorated.\n\nKnown for his walrus moustache, Mr Bolton has served in the administrations of Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush and George W Bush.\n\nThe second Bush appointed him as US envoy to the UN, during which time diplomats privately criticised Mr Bolton's style as abrasive.\n\nA strident neo-conservative, Mr Bolton helped build the case that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be wrong.\n\nMr Bolton does not appear to have moderated his views since his last spell in government. He stands by the invasion of Iraq and has called for the US to attack Iran and North Korea.\n\nBush-era war hawk makes comeback\n\nThe Republican strategist and veteran pollster serves as the highest-ranking woman in the White House after having earlier been considered for the role of press secretary.\n\n\"She is a tireless and tenacious advocate of my agenda and has amazing insights on how to effectively communicate our message,\" Mr Trump said.\n\nThe mother of four was promoted as Mr Trump's third campaign manager in August 2016 as part of another staff shake-up after the Republican convention.\n\nShe has been praised as the \"Trump whisperer\" and became the first woman to run a successful US presidential campaign.\n\nMr Cohen was more than a lawyer, he was a self-professed fixer. And his loyalty was unflinching - he once said he would take a bullet for Mr Trump.\n\nThe two were introduced by Donald Trump Jr in 2006 and Mr Cohen soon became part of the family.\n\nBut that close personal and professional relationship began disintegrating the moment Stormy Daniels became news.\n\nEver since the porn actress claimed she had an affair with Mr Trump - and that Mr Cohen paid her off - their friendship has been under strain.\n\nAfter his offices were raided by the FBI, he said his family was his top priority. In return, Mr Trump and his aides have been disparaging of Mr Cohen.\n\nThis soured further when audio was released by Mr Cohen's lawyer of a conversation in 2016 of candidate Trump and Mr Cohen discussing the payment.\n\nNow the news that Mr Cohen had struck a deal with the FBI - as they investigate possible fraud and campaign finance violations - could put even greater distance between them.\n\nShe has stood by her husband despite reports of his infidelities, alleged sexual assaults, and campaign revelations that he boasted about groping women.\n\nIn July 2016 she made headlines after making a speech at the Republican National Convention, which she was accused of having plagiarised from one made by Michelle Obama in 2008.\n\nIn an October interview with CNN, she was asked what she would change about her husband. She replied: \"His tweeting\".\n\nShe stayed in New York with their son Barron until he finished his school term, before formally moving into the White House in June 2017.\n\nPerhaps the best-known of Donald Trump's children, the only daughter of his marriage to Ivana, his first wife.\n\nA model in her early years, she was a vice-president at The Trump Organization, before stepping down when her father became president. She also launched her eponymous fashion line and was also a judge on her father's reality TV show The Apprentice.\n\nHer brother Donald Junior says Ivanka is the favourite child and is referred to as \"Daddy's little girl\".\n\nShe was given a level of authority in the family business that none of his wives ever had and is said to have handled some of the company's biggest deals.\n\nSince Mr Trump became president, she has regularly been seen at his side. She, rather than the first lady, travelled with him to an air base in early February 2017 to mark the return of the body of a soldier killed in a raid in Yemen.\n\nShe joined her father's administration as an unpaid aide with the title Adviser to the President, and has her own office in the West Wing of the White House.\n\nAfter her father became president, Ivanka said she had resigned from her signature apparel and accessories brand.\n\nShe converted to Judaism after marrying Jared Kushner in 2009.\n\nAmerica's other First Lady?\n\nMr Trump's media-shy son-in-law is the son of a prominent New York property developer and is married to Ivanka Trump.\n\nMr Kushner arrived at the White House with the broadest of briefs and has come out on top of several rounds of infighting in the West Wing.\n\nBut he increasingly faces a battle for relevance - stripped of his top-level security clearance and locked in a power struggle.\n\nIt emerged that Mr Kushner had attempted to arrange a communications backchannel with Russia during the presidential transition. But Mr Kushner denies any suggestion of collusion with the Kremlin.\n\nHe is a wealthy property developer and publisher. He owns 666 Fifth Avenue, a skyscraper a few blocks down from Trump Tower, and in 2006, aged just 25, he bought the once-venerable New York Observer newspaper.\n\nMr Kushner was born and raised in comfort in Livingston, New Jersey, alongside two sisters and a brother. His grandparents escaped Poland during the war, arriving in the US in 1949, and his father Charles made his fortune as a New Jersey property mogul.\n\nTrump's right-hand man\n\nDonald Trump's eldest son from his first marriage to Ivana is now executive vice-president of The Trump Organization, but had played a significant role during Mr Trump's campaign.\n\nIn July 2017, it emerged that Mr Trump Jr - along with Jared Kushner and former campaign manager Paul Manafort - had met with a Russian lawyer with links to the Kremlin during Mr Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nHe initially explained that the meeting was held to discuss Russian adoptions, which were suspended after the US announced sanctions on Russia in 2012.\n\nBut emails showed that he decided to attend the meeting after being offered damaging information about Hillary Clinton.\n\nHe and President Trump have since described the meeting as \"opposition research\" that any politician would engage in.\n\nThe former hardline Republican Congressman became US spymaster as head of the CIA. Now he has been nominated to take over as America's top diplomat following Mr Trump's abrupt firing of Rex Tillerson.\n\nThe three-term Tea Party Republican from Wichita, Kansas, was a vehement critic of the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran and has defended the National Security Agency's bulk data collection programme.\n\nHe also opposes closing Guantanamo Bay and, after visiting the prison in 2013, he remarked that some inmates who had declared a hunger strike looked like they had put on weight.\n\nIn January, he told the BBC that Russia would target the US mid-term elections.\n\nTrump's new loyalist top diplomat\n\nNot all of Mr Trump's supporters welcomed the idea of handing the levers of national tax policy to a consummate Wall Street insider.\n\nDuring his time running the OneWest bank, his business oversaw thousands of home foreclosures in the aftermath of the subprime mortgage crisis.\n\nMr Mnuchin amassed a fortune during his 17 years at Goldman Sachs before founding the movie production company behind such box office hits as the X-Men franchise and American Sniper.\n\nFive things about Steve Mnuchin\n\nThe treasury secretary found himself under investigation after he took a government-subsidised trip to Fort Knox with his Scottish wife Louis Linton, amid claims they were sightseeing.\n\nUS treasury secretary's wife rues missteps\n\nFrom 2010-13 he led US Central Command, which covers an area from the Horn of Africa into Central Asia and includes all US military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nHe is known for his blunt comments. In 2005 he was criticised after saying - in reference to Afghan men who \"slap women around... because they didn't wear a veil\" - that \"it's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them\".\n\nBut he is also described as a popular leader, well-liked by those he commanded, and an avid reader of literature on warfare. His nicknames were warrior monk and mad dog.\n\nAs Gen Mattis retired in 2013, the law that bans military officers from serving as defence chief for seven years after leaving active duty was waived.\n\n'Warrior Monk' to head Pentagon\n\nBorn in Taiwan, she became the first Asian-American woman to hold a position in a presidential cabinet when she led the Labor Department under President Bush from 2001-09.\n\nMs Chao, who is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, served as deputy secretary of transportation and director of the Peace Corps in former President George HW Bush's administration.\n\nShe came to the US with her family at the age of eight and settled in New York, where her father became a shipping magnate.\n\nMr Sessions had been one of Mr Trump's closest allies throughout the campaign, and his loyalty was rewarded when he became the nation's top prosecutor.\n\nBut the former senator from Alabama has appeared isolated after the president said he never would have appointed him if he had known that Mr Sessions would later recuse himself from the Russian investigation.\n\nMr Sessions later said the president's attacks were \"kinda hurtful\".\n\nAllegations of racism have dogged him throughout his career, and were raised during his confirmation hearing in the Senate.\n\nHe lost out on a federal judgeship back in 1986 when former colleagues said he had used the N-word.\n\nBut during the hearing, he acknowledged \"the horrendous impact that relentless and systemic discrimination and the denial of voting rights has had on our African-American brothers and sisters\".\n\nMs Haspel has been chosen by Mr Trump to take over from Mike Pompeo as he steps up to become secretary of state.\n\nIf confirmed, she will become the first female director of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nA career intelligence officer with more than 30 years' experience, she was appointed CIA deputy director last year.\n\nControversially, she ran a prison in Thailand where suspected al-Qaeda members were tortured by waterboarding in 2002.\n\nTrump's pick as new CIA director\n\nThe former Texas governor heads an agency he proposed to eliminate during his failed 2012 presidential campaign.\n\nThe former Dancing with the Stars contestant was a vocal critic of Mr Trump, calling him a \"barking carnival act\" and a \"cancer on conservatism\" before he dropped out of his second unsuccessful bid for the White House in 2015.\n\nAs governor of Texas, Mr Perry called for lighter regulation on the oil industry and referred to the science around climate change as \"unsettled\".\n\nAfter being picked by Mr Trump, he stepped down from the board of directors at Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota.\n\nMrs DeVos is an advocate of Republican-favoured charter schools, which are publicly funded and set up by teachers, parents, or community groups outside the state school system.\n\nShe also previously supported the Common Core education standards that Mr Trump and many conservatives have pilloried.\n\nMr Trump called her \"a brilliant and passionate education advocate\" but she was criticised after appearing to struggle at times during her nomination hearing.\n\nWhy is Betsy DeVos so unpopular?\n\nThe former Florida International University law dean has worked for the National Labor Relations Board, the Justice Department's civil rights division, and the US Attorney for the Southern District of Florida.\n\nBefore joining the Trump administration, he was chairman of the US Century Bank, the largest domestically owned Hispanic community bank in Florida.\n\nDuring his time serving as US Attorney in Florida, he cut a secret deal with billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein, who had been accused of sexual misconduct with underage girls.\n\nThe deal was criticised by lawyers representing the alleged victims, saying that the punishment was too lenient.\n\nMr Zinke has bucked his party on the issue of privatisation or transfer of public lands to states, which he believes should remain under federal control.\n\nEnvironmental advocacy groups condemned the pick, accusing him of being in hock to corporate polluters.\n\nMr Zinke's time in office has been overshadowed by a series of alleged ethics violations.\n\nPresident Trump announced on 15 December 2018 that he would leave his post at the end of the month.\n\nWho is Ryan Zinke?\n\nAndrew Wheeler- Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) boss\n\nThe former energy lobbyist was appointed chief of the EPA after Scott Pruitt resigned amid a string of scandals regarding his spending habits and allegations of ethical misconduct.\n\nMr Wheeler, who served as the No 2 official at the EPA, was confirmed as Mr Pruitt's deputy in April.\n\nThe 53-year-old Ohio native worked for nine years as lobbyist for the coal industry, representing companies that often had business before the EPA.\n\nHe worked as a special assistant for the EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics during the 1990s before becoming an aide at the Senate's Environment Committee.\n\nHe also was a staffer for Republican Senator Jim Inhofe, who served as a chairman for the Senate environmental panel and has dismissed global warming as a hoax.\n\nIn announcing Mr Pruitt's resignation, the president tweeted he has \"no doubt that Andy will continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda. We have made tremendous progress and the future of the EPA is very bright!\"\n\nMr Navarro is a top economic advisor to the president and director of the White House's Trade and Manufacturing Policy office.\n\nA staunch anti-China and pro-tariff economist, Mr Navarro was sidelined and demoted by Chief of Staff John Kelly and other free trade economists on the National Economic Council last autumn.\n\nHowever, the former Trump campaign advisor - an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine - still wields influence in the White House, as seen by the tariffs placed on steel and aluminium."
