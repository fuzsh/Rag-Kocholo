        "text": "WASHINGTON — The Concord Coalition on Thursday will honor Mitch Daniels and Evan Bayh III — two former Indiana governors who have both wrestled with difficult fiscal decisions — with the 2015 Paul E. Tsongas Economic Patriot Award.\n\nWASHINGTON — The Concord Coalition on Thursday will honor Mitch Daniels and Evan Bayh III — two former Indiana governors who have both wrestled with difficult fiscal decisions — with the 2015 Paul E. Tsongas Economic Patriot Award.\n\nBayh served as Indiana’s 46th governor from 1989 to 1997, presiding over eight consecutive balanced budgets. After his second gubernatorial term, Bayh, a Democrat, served two terms in the U.S. Senate and now practices law.\n\nDaniels, a Republican, served as director of the Office of Management and Budget after holding a variety of other positions in the public and private sectors. He was elected Indiana’s 49th governor in 2004, and soon turned a large budget deficit into a surplus. After his second term, he became president of Purdue University in 2013.\n\n“Throughout their distinguished careers, Mitch Daniels and Evan Bayh have each demonstrated not only a thorough understanding of the importance of fiscal responsibility but the courage to champion it even in the face of heavy resistance, sometimes from within their own parties,” says Robert L. Bixby, Concord’s executive director. “Both have also shown the ability to work towards constructive, bipartisan solutions that could strengthen the nation and protect future generations from excessive government debt.”\n\nThe award ceremony will be held this Thursday night at the Phoenix Park Hotel in Washington.\n\nThe honorees will also participate in a panel discussion on the nation’s fiscal and economic challenges. Other panel members will be Concord Coalition co-chairs and former U.S. House members Michael Castle and John Tanner; Bixby; and Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nThe Patriot Award is named for the late Paul E. Tsongas, one of Concord’s founding co-chairmen. It honors those who have demonstrated a commitment to fiscal responsibility and the protection of younger generations from irresponsible fiscal policies. Over the years the award has been given to individuals of varied backgrounds and political affiliations.\n\nMedia coverage of the program, which will begin at approximately 8:15 p.m., is welcome.\n\nWHAT: 2015 Economic Patriot Award Presentation and Panel Discussion\n\nWHEN: Thursday, June 25. Program begins at 8:15 p.m.\n\nWHERE: The Phoenix Park Hotel; 520 N. Capitol Street, NW; Washington\n\nMedia Contact: Steve Winn, (703) 254-7828, [email protected]\n\n###\n\nThe Concord Coalition is a nonpartisan, grassroots organization dedicated to fiscal responsibility. Since 1992, Concord has worked to educate the public about the causes and consequences of the federal deficit and debt, and to develop realistic solutions for sustainable budgets.
