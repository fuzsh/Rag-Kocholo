        "text": "WASHINGTON, DC—The American Council of Trustees and Alumni (ACTA) announced that Purdue University President Mitchell E. Daniels, Jr. was honored with its most prestigious award, recognizing his extraordinary leadership in promoting academic freedom, academic excellence, and cost-effective, efficient administration.\n\nOn October 12, 2018, ACTA presented President Daniels with the 2018 Philip Merrill Award for Outstanding Contributions to Liberal Arts Education. The selection of President Daniels, recommended by a committee of distinguished educators and civic leaders from around the country, specifically recognizes his instrumental role in\n\npromoting uncompromising freedom of expression on campus;\n\nmaintaining rigorous academic standards;\n\ncreating the Purdue Polytechnic High School—an innovative STEM preparatory charter school in Indianapolis;\n\nand managing a tuition freeze for all undergraduates at Purdue University for seven consecutive years, from the 2012-13 academic year through at least 2019-20.\n\nDaniels is the 12th president of Purdue University and the former governor of Indiana. In recognition of his leadership in both offices, he was named among the World’s 50 Greatest Leaders by Fortune magazine in 2015.\n\nAs a result of President Daniels’s vision and guidance, tuition at Purdue has been held in check at a time when elsewhere, national higher education costs and student debt loads have escalated out of control. Through at least 2020, students at Purdue will pay less in tuition and fees than in 2012, and five graduating classes will have earned their Purdue degrees without ever experiencing a tuition increase.\n\nPresident Daniels was also highly influential in building a culture of freedom of expression at Purdue, making it the first public university to adopt the Chicago Principles, forging a lasting partnership on this issue between students and University leaders, and becoming the first public university to earn the top rating for the protection of free speech from the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE).\n\nACTA President Michael Poliakoff observed, “Mitch Daniels has demonstrated how, with strong leadership and vision, a great university can reach new heights of excellence in teaching and learning, safeguard freedom of expression, expand opportunities for disadvantaged students, and still succeed in keeping college affordable. He inspires colleges and universities to see that both excellence and affordability can be within reach.”\n\nThe Merrill Award was presented to President Daniels on October 12 at an evening gala following ACTA’s annual ATHENA Roundtable conference at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington, DC. The award reflects and honors the legacy of the late Philip Merrill, a distinguished public servant, publisher, businessman, and philanthropist who served as a trustee of numerous universities and cultural institutions. Throughout his career, Mr. Merrill was a passionate proponent of academic excellence and an articulate spokesman for the importance of liberal education in a free society.\n\nPaying tribute at the Gala to President Daniels were his good friends Erskine Bowles, the former President of the University of North Carolina, along with former Florida Governor Governor Jeb Bush; author and political scientist Charles Murray; and former ACLU President Nadine Strossen.\n\nPrevious Merrill Award recipients are:\n\n2017—Robert Zimmer, president of the University of Chicago\n\n2016—Niall Ferguson, senior fellow, Hoover Institution at Stanford University, & Ayaan Hirsi Ali, human rights advocate and former member of the Dutch Parliament\n\n2015—Hank Brown, former U.S. senator and president emeritus of the University of Colorado and University of Northern Colorado\n\n2014—Louise Mirrer, president and CEO of the New-York Historical Society\n\n2013—Gary W.
