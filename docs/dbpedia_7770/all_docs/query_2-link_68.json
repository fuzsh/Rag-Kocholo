        "text": "In the summer of 2004, my wife and I moved from Massachusetts back to our home state of Indiana. When I reported to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to secure a new driver’s license, however, it was apparent Hoosier hospitality had not found its way to the state agency. I only achieved street legality after six weeks and seven infuriating trips to various government offices.\n\nFast forward several years, and it’s time to register a new car. I’ve heard the BMV has improved its operations, and I’m able to make an appointment over the Internet, but I’m skeptical. I arrive at the hour of my choosing, my eight year old daughter in tow. We check in, wait three minutes for the clerk, and within another six minutes, we are out the door. Truth be told, three or four of those minutes were spent thanking the very pleasant clerk for the vastly improved service. You can see the receipt of our quick visit nearby.\n\nSix minutes versus six weeks. This mundane comparison is but a tiny reflection of the far more momentous policy agenda and management effectiveness of Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels.\n\nWhen most states were gleefully building unsustainable liabilities in the pre-crash party years, Daniels was scrutinizing every line item of state government. Despite Indiana’s many challenges as a Midwestern manufacturing state, he turned a large inherited budget deficit into a surplus – and then sustained the surplus through the crash. The state achieved its first AAA credit rating, all while delivering a net tax cut.\n\nWhen the crash hit and other states retrenched important infrastructure projects, Indiana plowed ahead. Daniels had the foresight to lease the Indiana Toll Road for $4 billion and thus fund a generation’s worth of new roads and bridges. Indiana in 2011 will build a record number of “lane miles” – with 15% fewer Department of Transportation workers.\n\nThe quantum leap in BMV service has been achieved with 20% fewer agency employees. Overall, Indiana has the country’s fewest state employees per capita and employs the same number of government workers it did in 1975. But there was no slash-and-burn. Just 5% of the workforce reductions were involuntary layoffs. Most of the efficiencies were achieved through a strategic hiring committee that asked some tough questions (and lots of easy ones, too) about whether positions on existing organizational charts were really necessary.\n\nReductions in many agencies enabled large expansions in others, like Family and Social Services, which added hundreds of workers to stem a crisis in the foster care and child protection system. By decertifying public employee unions on his first day in office in 2005, Daniels gained the flexibility not just to pare back, reorganize, and merely move Xerox machines without union permission – but also to pay the best state employees more.\n\nJust yesterday, Daniels won support for the nation’s most far-reaching education reforms: widespread school choice, local control, merit pay and an end to seniority.\n\nThe list goes on: public pension plans that are modest and healthy; a 2006 telecom reform that boosted the state’s broadband and wireless infrastructure (a recent Akamai report showed Indiana with the sixth highest broadband speeds); and health savings accounts (HSAs) for state workers, which have been popular (70% choose this option) and saved large sums.\n\nIndiana’s success comes despite many economic and climatic obstacles. It’s long been a key link in the supply chain of the troubled auto industry. And the state’s four robust seasons (snow, sleet, gray, heat) mean Indiana can’t compete with Texas or North Carolina in the sunshine department. Yet the 2010 census showed Indiana’s population grew faster in the previous decade than any state in the Northeast quadrant – “from Iowa to Maine,” as Daniels likes to say.\n\nDaniels’ bold policy agenda and his “measure everything” management genius have bolstered Indiana in tough times. But his other qualities are perhaps what the nation most needs. Read any of Daniels’ columns for The Wall Street Journal or his commencement speeches at Butler and Rose-Hulman Universities, and you will find a texture of thought rarely matched by public officials. There is a mingling of aggressive honesty and good willed restraint, pungent humor and empathy, economic literacy and cultural context.\n\nMany think they know how to spur economic growth or fix the budget. But at a time of supreme ideological polarity but so little room for further economic error, the question is, how do we get there?\n\nDaniels has been thinking strategically – about the what and the how. He suggested we might set aside the most divisive social issues for a time in order to build a coalition large enough to affirm a new generational path on the economy and entitlements. Not the way ObamaCare was rammed through, with the barest margin and questionable parliamentary maneuvers.\n\nThis coalition of economic liberty and social tolerance probably represents 70% of the nation. To my socially conservative friends, I would say this of Daniels’ proposed “truce.” We can take our children to church where we please. We can teach them what’s important. We can’t resist the government’s taxes or regulations. Nor can we provide for our children if the government creates a Depression. The U.S. is big and diverse. We should handle more things at the state – or family – level. By deemphasizing the national all-or-nothing social rows that inflame both sides to maximum angst, we could actually succeed in a decentralized revival that would reflect America’s natural conservatism better than the existing binary stand-off.\n\nIndiana may have the nation’s most efficient state government, but our state is unlikely to succeed if America does not. We’re willing to share, and we hope this unusually smart and energetic man of action might consider service in a larger arena."
