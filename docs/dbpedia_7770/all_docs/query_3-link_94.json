        "meta_description": "INDIANAPOLIS &#8212; Gov. Mitch Daniels will take over his post as president of Purdue University in less than a month, having served eight years as Indiana&#8217;s governor.Before he headed to West Lafayette, Daniels spoke to reporters around the coffee table in his office about a range of issues and projects covering his eight years as governor. He talked about efforts to give students more choices about where they go to school, to create jobs across the state and to improve the state&#8217;s transportation system. But he acknowledged frustration as well that he had not succeeded both in improving Hoosiers&#8217; personal incomes relative to the nation and convincing them to be healthier. He said both are like trying to turn around an oil tanker.&#8220;We have tried, this business of personal health habits and so forth,&#8221; Daniels said. &#8220;Now, it wasn&#8217;t a surprise, but that doesn&#8217;t make it any less discouraging.&#8221;But Daniels said he was proud of the near-term effects of legislation he helped pass, including a right to work law, a bill meant to curb dropouts and one intended to help students finish college faster and for less money. The latter &#8212; the so-called credit creep bill &#8212; has led state universities to reduce the number of credits students need to graduate.&#8220;That&#8217;s going to mean a lot of kids finishing a semester sooner, which means less expense,&#8221; he said.Here&#8217;s what else Daniels said during a wide-ranging interview about what he&#8217;s learned from eight years at the head of the state, which of his policy changes he thinks will endure and what he added to his &#8220;oops&#8221; list.<h4>Question:</h4> Governor, when you think back over eight years, is there anything you wish you could go back and tell first-term, first-year Gov. Daniels that would have made things better or easier? <h4>Answer:</h4> In the first year? First year was a pretty good year.We ran with a very explicit, very detailed agenda and we went and did most of it. The ethics reforms, the economic development restructuring at least began then, obviously addressing the fiscal problems of the state and many more. Daylight savings time. And on and on.Now, I made the proposal, the sort of debt reduction proposal, about an income tax surcharge, which clearly didn&#8217;t happen. But, you know, I don&#8217;t regret having suggested it.We knew the state had big fiscal problems. We didn&#8217;t know how deep they were until after the election. We began to get a better sense. We were upside down on the budget. What I didn&#8217;t realize was how much money they owed the schools and the universities and so forth. And I was in a hurry.So, that didn&#8217;t work out, but I don&#8217;t think it did any lasting damage.If you look at that list of 70 odd things (we ran on) from 2005, there aren&#8217;t very many in the &#8220;did not succeed&#8221; column.One of them is an appointed superintendent of public instruction. What&#8217;s highly ironic is that it&#8217;s the only position in common between the Republican and Democratic platforms of 2005. Far as I know, they didn&#8217;t overlap on anything else, but both of them said, as a matter of good government, we should appoint the superintendent. And, then, ironically, that&#8217;s one of the only things we couldn&#8217;t get done that year.<h4>Q:</h4> Mike Pence always says that he wants to take the state from good to great. Now, obviously to do that he has to work on what you&#8217;ve left him. Is there anything left for him to take from good to great?<h4>A:</h4> Sure there is. There always will be, but I think that we always operated around here on the notion of continuous improvement and when a department, if a department reached a certain target we set for them, we tried to raise it the next year.I think my only comment would be that when he&#8217;s done with the job, I hope he&#8217;s encouraging somebody to, you know, emphasize the areas where we still need improvement.<h4>Q:</h4> Seems to me like it takes a decade for the first real assessment of governorship. That puts us in the 2020 range. The education reforms that you got through in 2011 and the administrative stuff you had done a couple years prior, how long do you think it&#8217;s going to be until we have a realistic measurement of what the impact is? <h4>A:</h4> Your time frame&#8217;s probably about right. I never give up that some things can have a near-term effect. For instance, the dropout bill that we passed in &#8217;06 or &#8217;07 has made a very immediate impact. We had a 10 percent improvement in graduation rates.So, there&#8217;s one. Some things you can do don&#8217;t have to take 10 years.I&#8217;ll give you another one: The credit creep bill we passed this year. At Purdue University, I&#8217;m proud to say on their behalf, two-thirds of the degree programs brought their programs down to 120 hours (needed to graduate).Now it might have been two or three hours or it might have been more, but that&#8217;s going to mean a lot of kids finishing a semester sooner, which means less expense. And that didn&#8217;t take 10 years. I hope we&#8217;re going to see a similar pattern at seven schools.I think the social promotion bill that says that students have got to be able to read before leaving third grade, and assuming it&#8217;s not somehow undone, has a chance to have a measurable short-term impact.But, those are exceptions, I guess. I agree with you that, in education, in particular.I mean, look, we just got the full-day kindergarten, finally. Big deal to me. People talked about it for decades and so we finally got that done, and I think that will make a big difference for kids. But it will be years before that child who got full-day kindergarten, before the full beneficial effects are visible.And on a lot of the reforms we just did, the first question is will they stick or will they be, somehow, subverted. If they stick, then they&#8217;ve got to be well implemented. And, so, those are big ifs.<h4>Q:</h4> Should Indiana have a death penalty? And talk about the times that matter has been on your desk. <h4>A:</h4> I&#8217;ve said before that, even though I haven&#8217;t held office, you have general sense of things you deal with, but two exceptions, big exceptions, things you don&#8217;t think about, are soldiers&#8217; funerals and death sentences. Anybody that says they don&#8217;t feel some ambivalence about that subject, I don&#8217;t understand.I think it&#8217;s, if you don&#8217;t feel conflicted about it, on one side or the other, maybe you should think a little harder. Where I came to rest on that one, sometime ago was that it was not for me or any one person to make that judgment. It needs to express the moral sentiments of the state through the democratic process and, for now, at least in this moment, or the last I&#8217;ve seen, a very large majority of our fellow citizens believe that, at least occasionally, in the most heinous of cases, that that penalty can be appropriate. So, I didn&#8217;t think it was for me to substitute any view I had for that.As a practical manner, this subject is diminishing. I&#8217;m not sure when the last time any Indiana court or judge or judge and jury imposed the death penalty on somebody. If it&#8217;s happened in the last few years, I&#8217;ve missed it.Future governors will have few, maybe none of these to deal with.<h4>Q:</h4> Give us an overview of the health of individual Hoosiers. We&#8217;ve had the smoking ban, we&#8217;ve had the federal health care law that&#8217;s coming, the Healthy Indiana program, childhood obesity. Give us an overview from what you&#8217;re seeing from the unique perch that you&#8217;ve had. <h4>A:</h4> This probably belongs on the list of answers to areas where we just didn&#8217;t get enough done.We have tried, this business of personal health habits and so forth. Now, it wasn&#8217;t a surprise, but that doesn&#8217;t make it any less discouraging.I&#8217;ve reminisced many times. We started what&#8217;s the now INShape Indiana program and with great fanfare, we had celebrities and athletes, because a lot of people were interested in this. We had a great thing over at NIFS (National Institute for Fitness and Sport), where I worked out for the last eight years, and I told everybody that day, you know, of all the changes we try to bring, and all the initiatives that we launch, this will be the least controversial and the hardest.In other words, I don&#8217;t know anybody who doesn&#8217;t think, in general, that this was a good thing to work on, but you&#8217;re just really up against it, when you try and move large, large, numbers of people to change the habits of a lifetime.The recent data we&#8217;ve seen is pretty discouraging. Some of it didn&#8217;t ring quite true. The last data we saw had smoking rates really have changed in Indiana. They had 26 percent. I haven&#8217;t seen that in three years. I think that&#8217;s way behind. The last data public we had was close to 20. Still above the national average, but definitely down.Anyway, I don&#8217;t dispute the fact that we&#8217;re just not as healthy a state as we should be or need to be. But, you know, we&#8217;ve done everything we know how to, we can think of, let me put it that way. Someone smarter is going to have to work on this.<h4>Q:</h4> Has right to work hurt the unions in any way? <h4>A:</h4> Not that I&#8217;m aware of. Not in any way.Obviously it doesn&#8217;t hurt the right to unionize, the right to collectively bargain, totally unaffected. We pointed out, when the bill was being discussed, there are a number of right-to-work states with higher rates of unionization than Indiana had without such a bill. So, I mean, no, I&#8217;m not aware that it has. That&#8217;s not its intention.<h4>Q:</h4> Why is it that Hoosiers underestimate or sort of downplay and are more humble than other states, like a New York? <h4>A:</h4> All I know is that our state, I always used to say, is like an under-performing business. We&#8217;ve got assets.In &#8217;04, I would sometimes say, &#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing we&#8217;re not publicly traded.&#8221; By the way, this is interesting because I used to use Michigan as the example. You wouldn&#8217;t today. This was just eight years ago. But I would say, &#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing because, you know, Michigan would make a hostile tender offer and they&#8217;d buy us and consolidate the headquarters to Lansing.&#8221;And I said, &#8220;What do I mean? We&#8217;ve got great assets, like balance sheet, and a lousy income statement. We&#8217;ve got great assets. We&#8217;ve got location, low costs, great universities, but we&#8217;re not performing.&#8221;<h4>Q:</h4> What have you added this year to your &#8220;oops&#8221; list?<h4>A:</h4> Was the question disappointments or mistakes? Because they&#8217;re both here.Something I should have mentioned more often, we really worked on the recidivism rate at DOC (Department of Corrections) and it&#8217;s only come down about a point.So there&#8217;s one. There&#8217;s a lot of things going on, a lot of moving parts there. But there&#8217;s one that, from the very beginning, we&#8217;ve worked and worked. We&#8217;ve had more education programs and we have more work-release programs and we&#8217;ve got more substance abuse programs, but it&#8217;s just been really stubborn.You know, I&#8217;m giving this commencement for IU which will be interesting. They invited me before life changed and I thought, &#8220;Great, I&#8217;m off the hook,&#8221; then I got a call from (IU President Michael) McRobbie and he says, &#8220;No, come on ahead.&#8221;Shoot. Now I got to write another speech. But, toward the end of it, and I&#8217;ve said this elsewhere. I&#8217;ve never found &#8220;oops&#8221; a hard word to say. And I said, if you never need it, then either you&#8217;re not trying anything and you never made any mistakes, or, you know, you&#8217;re just not being honest with yourself.",
