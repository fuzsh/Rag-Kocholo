        "text": "Background\n\nTweet\n\nAs the 49th governor of Indiana, Mitch Daniels has backed a statewide voucher system, merit pay for teachers and the expansion of charter schools since taking office in 2005. His Commission on Local Government Reform issued the Kernan-Shepard report, which advocated the streamlining of local government, including school consolidation.\n\nThe Republican governor has worked closely with former state schools chiefÂ Tony Bennett to implement the educational priorities of the executive office.\n\nNow heâs headed to Purdue University, where he took the helm after being term-limited out of office in January 2013. Speculation that Daniels might be the frontrunner to succeed France CÃ³rdova as president of the university began in spring 2012, though the governor remained tight-lipped.\n\nItâs an interesting career move for Daniels, who has said Indiana students need more career and technical training. Heâs advocated for alternatives to four-year universities and appeared in commercials for the online Western Governors University. (Daniels attended Princeton and Georgetown universities.) Heâs also asked the legislature to cut the number of hours it takes to earn some degrees."
