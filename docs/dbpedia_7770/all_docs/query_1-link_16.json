        "text": "After eight years in office, former Gov. Mitch Daniels says he’s leaving Indiana’s environment better than he found it: with the cleanest air and water in the modern era “by every measure” and thousands of acres of new conservation lands.\n\nFor others, however, the two-term governor’s legacy when it comes to environmental issues is seen as more of a mixed bag.\n\nWhile Daniels’ conservation efforts have earned high praise from environmental groups within the state, other moves — in particular the development of a new coal-fired power plant within the state — tarnish the governor’s record in some activists’ eyes.\n\n“I think that his record is certainly mixed,” said Steve Francis, state chairman of the Hoosier Chapter of the Sierra Club. “I would say it borders on mediocre from our issues.”\n\nBut Daniels said the numbers show — “without leaving room for doubt” — that Indiana is better off today than when he first took office in 2005. He said that “for the first time in the history of the Clean Air Act,” every county in Indiana met federal air quality standards during his tenure.\n\nDaniels also notes that when he took office, 108 Indiana communities were dealing with “combined sewer overflows,” a situation where combined storm and sanitary sewer systems resulted in untreated sewage being dumped into rivers and streams after a hard rain.\n\nToday, 106 of those communities have programs in place to prevent such overflows and a third of those communities have rebuilt their entire sewer systems to combat the problem, he said.\n\nDaniels also credits the elimination of a backlog of applications for air, water and land use permits — as many as 300 in each category — for “enormous reductions in emissions and effluence” because delays had allowed some applicants to continue under older, less-stringent standards. Turnaround time was reduced to a few weeks, he said.\n\nFrancis, however, takes a dimmer view of the quicker turnaround time for permits. The Sierra Club representative charges that Daniels’ administration has been “more concerned about getting permits approved . even when they have done so in violation of federal law and on several occasions had to revise those permits.”\n\nFrancis was also sharply critical of the former governor’s support of the construction of a new coal-fired power plant in Edwardsport, at a time when he believes the state should be pursuing cleaner sources of energy to help combat climate change. The Edwardsport plant may use a novel process of coal “gasification,” he said, but it is still expected to vent roughly 4 million tons of carbon dioxide into Indiana’s atmosphere every year.\n\nThe state is “not moving off of coal rapidly enough to play our part in Indiana of preventing climate change,” Francis said, noting that the Edwardsport plant is one of the few new coal plants being built in the nation.\n\nFrancis was also disappointed by the governor’s failure to “advocate for and implement a renewable energy standard for the state of Indiana.” Such a standard, already implemented in other states, would mandate that utilities produce a certain percentage of their power from renewable sources.\n\nDaniels, meanwhile, defends the Edwardsport plant as “the cleanest coal plant ever built, it’s essentially pollution free.” He also believes a mandatory renewable energy standard would lead to much higher energy costs that many Hoosiers can’t afford, and would ultimately cost residents much-needed jobs.\n\nOpponents to the construction of I-69 — a project Daniels funded with proceeds from leasing the Indiana Toll Road — have also consistently raised concerns, and sometimes lawsuits, about the interstate’s effect on the local ecosystem. In particular, groups have said the construction could hurt the endangered Indiana bat, as well as destroying wetlands and karst features.\n\nStill, Daniels has led Indiana to three “landscape-scale” conservation programs during his tenure, Indiana Wildlife Federation executive director Barbara Simpson said: the Health Rivers INitiative, the Bicentennial Nature Trust and the acquisition of the 8,000-acre Goose Pond Fish & Wildlife Area near Linton. That leadership earned him the federation’s Theodore Roosevelt Award in 2012, she said.\n\nIn 2010, the former governor launched the Healthy Rivers Initiative with the aim of securing permanent conservation protection for nearly 70,000 acres along Sugar Creek, the Wabash River and the Muscatatuck River. As of this month, the state had acquired more than 10,000 acres of that land.\n\n“When the Wabash River corridor is completed in two or three years, a person who wants to will be able to put a canoe in Sugar Creek and spend the next 100-plus miles canoeing, fishing, bird-watching and never leave a protected wetlands,” Daniels said.\n\nDaniels’ Bicentennial Nature Trust, announced last year, is intended to celebrate the state’s 200th anniversary in four years with “a surge in additional environmental protection,” Daniels said. Already the state has committed $20 million to fund projects throughout the state, such as purchasing additional wetlands or forests.\n\nBut it is the sheer scale of the acquisition of Goose Pond, however, that ranks it among Daniels’ most significant conservation efforts, Simpson said, calling the purchase of 8,000 acres an opportunity the state may never see again. Having such a large preserve will have a positive impact on migratory birds and other wildlife who have seen their homes reduced to smaller, scattered preserves, known as “habitat fragmentation.”\n\n“When you can have land programs for wildlife habitats on a scale that large, 8,000 acres, when you have a vision of 70,000 acres .. It’s the scale that really makes a difference,” she said.\n\n“Clearly the governor understands the importance of these large-scale projects to protect habitats,” she added. “We’d like to see even more of that, but the things he could do as governor he certainly did.”\n\nConservation Day at the Statehouse\n\nThe Nature Conservancy will sponsor Conservation Day at the Statehouse on Wednesday. The event gives the public a chance to interact with state legislators and voice their opinions and concerns about environmental issues.
