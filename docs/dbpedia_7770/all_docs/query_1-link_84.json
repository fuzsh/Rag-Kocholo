        "text": "Commanders links\n\nArticles\n\nThe Athletic (paywall)\n\nCommanders rookie QB Sam Hartman among roster hopefuls ready for an opportunity\n\nCollege football fans know Hartman from his starry days with Wake Forest and Notre Dame. The Charlotte, N.C., native played youth football with Ty and William Gibbs, grandsons of the three-time Super Bowl champion head coach. The iconic Joe Gibbs attended Tuesday’s sweltering practice along with Washington Hall of Fame cornerback Darrell Green.\n\nAll four of the Commanders’ quarterbacks are expected to play on Saturday. Depending on needs elsewhere and the passers’ performances, only two may make the Week 1 active roster. Regardless of when he enters the game, Hartman’s push for a spot begins now.\n\n“I’m just excited about the opportunity, whatever it is,” Hartman said. “(I’m) ready to compete and have some fun.”\n\nThat’s offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury’s vibe, even if the former Arizona Cardinals head coach isn’t ready to unveil his whole plan of attack. “You pick your spots … preseason, we’re not going to show much,” he said.\n\n“Sam’s been great. A great personality (and) competitor,” Kingsbury said. “Everywhere he’s been, he’s been a winner. I think anytime you put him in those game situations, he lights up. … I expect him to go in and execute at a high level, run around and make plays like he always has.”\n\nThe differentiator for second-year wide receiver Brycen Tremayne is obvious. At 6-foot-4, Tremayne’s size stands out in a receiver room loaded with smaller targets. As many as three wide receiver jobs are available, with Crowder, Dyami Brown, Mitchell Tinsley and Tremayne the top contenders.\n\nTremayne isn’t necessarily a moveable piece, but his consistent ability to snag downfield passes in practice while offering a physical blocking option thrust him into competition for a job with a new staff. The Stanford alum sees his preseason challenge as “just keep doing it.”\n\nCommanders Wire\n\nCommanders sign offensive tackle Alex Taylor\n\nOn Wednesday, the Commanders added some help at offensive tackle, signing Alex Taylor.\n\nThe 6-foot-8, 301-pound Taylor went undrafted in the 2020 NFL draft out of South Carolina State. He began his career at Appalachian State but transferred after one season to play basketball. He played two seasons of basketball but returned to football and became an All-MEAC selection in each of his final two seasons.\n\nThe 27-year-old Taylor initially signed with the Cleveland Browns as an undrafted free agent. He was waived in September but re-signed to the practice squad in October. The Browns activated him to the 53-man roster for each of their final three games.\n\nCleveland waived Taylor in August 2021. He signed with the Chicago Bears practice and was released a few weeks later.\n\nHe again signed with the Browns, moving between the practice squad and the main roster before Cleveland released him again in September 2022. Taylor signed with the Dallas Cowboys practice squad that November and spent the offseason with them. After the Cowboys waived him in August 2023, he re-signed with their practice squad. Dallas released him from the practice squad in October. Taylor has appeared in four NFL games.\n\nTaylor spent the spring with the Birmingham Stallions of the United Football League.\n\nSports Illustrated\n\nWashington Commanders Add Offensive Tackle to Roster On Eve of Jets Joint Practice\n\nFor the second time this week the Washington Commanders have addressed their offensive line depth.\n\nFor the second time this week the Washington Commanders have addressed their offensive line depth.\n\nTaylor is the second former Cowboys offensive lineman to join the Commanders along with center Tyler Biadasz.\n\nWith injuries starting to mount on the offensive line its no surprise Washington decided to address the group at this stage of the preseason.\n\nOffensive tackle Alex Akingbulu suffered what appears to be a season-ending injury on Friday, fellow tackle Andrew Wylie has missed portions of several practices this training camp, rookie left tackle Brandon Coleman was present but not participating fully on Monday, and guard Sam Cosmi has missed the last two practices for undisclosed reasons.\n\nCommanders Wire\n\nEagles claim former Commanders TE Armani Rogers off waivers\n\nRogers, 26, signed with the Commanders as an undrafted free agent in 2022. A former college quarterback at UNLV and Ohio, Rogers began the transition to tight end after his college career. He showed promise throughout training camp and in the preseason, earning a spot on the 53-man roster.\n\nHe appeared in 11 games during his rookie season. Unfortunately, an injury ended his 2022 season after 11 games and three starts. He caught five passes for 64 yards and carried the ball twice for 26 yards.\n\nRogers was slated for a more significant role in 2023 but tore his Achilles during OTAs and missed the entire season. He was healthy this summer, but Washington’s tight end situation looked much different. The Commanders signed veteran Zach Ertz and drafted Ben Sinnott in the second round.\n\nPodcasts & videos\n\nCommand Center: Gibbs, Green, Unofficial Depth Chart and Taking on the NY Jets | Podcast | Washington Commanders\n\nLocked on Commanders - Washington Commanders Training Camp: Jayden Daniels QB1 on Depth Chart | Team Analyst Logan Paulsen\n\nNFC East links\n\nESPN\n\nNFL training camp 2024 live updates: Latest on roster battles\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles\n\nOne thing that has stood out this summer is the production of tight ends Dallas Goedert and Grant Calcaterra. That trend continued Wednesday, with Jalen Hurts throwing touchdowns to both targets. New offensive coordinator Kellen Moore runs what is considered a TE-friendly system, featuring a quick game that can lead to more opportunities for the tight ends on short-to-intermediate throws. Hurts has a number of playmakers he needs to distribute the ball to, but the tight ends appear optimistic that they’ll get their fair share. — Tim McManus\n\n(Last update: Aug. 7)\n\nESPN\n\nInside the disconnect between Eagles coach Nick Siriani and QB Jalen Hurts\n\nAddressing the media on the final day of minicamp in early June, Hurts was asked about Sirianni:\n\nWhat have you noticed about Nick being open-minded to change up the offense like he has? What does that say about him?\n\nHurts, who learned how to de-thorn even the most pointed queries during his time at Alabama under Nick Saban, offered a response that could be seen as a match to kindling.\n\n“Um,” he said, followed by a pause and a short closed-mouth laugh. “I mean, that’s a great question. I don’t know that I know the answer to it.”\n\nThat was enough to kick up six weeks of speculation during the run-up to training camp: Is the Hurts-Sirianni relationship in a bad place? If so, what does it mean for the 2024 season?\n\nAlthough both have a thirst for competition and greatness, Hurts is considered more reserved, sometimes internalizing conflict — while Sirianni’s style is to be direct with conflict, according to a team source. That dynamic presents challenges when the two interact, team sources say.\n\n“There was never a moment last year where they were operating in a healthy relationship,” one source with direct knowledge of the situation said.\n\nSirianni and Hurts declined interview requests from ESPN for this story via a team spokesperson.\n\nFollowing Philly’s Super Bowl run at the end of the 2023 season, offensive coordinator Shane Steichen left to coach the Indianapolis Colts. He was replaced by quarterbacks coach Brian Johnson, whose relationship with Hurts dates back more than two decades. Hurts’ father, Averion, was a coach at Robert E. Lee High School in Baytown, Texas, in the early 2000s when Johnson played there.\n\nOn the surface, it seemed Johnson’s promotion would be seamless. But it quickly became apparent Johnson and Hurts were on a different page than Sirianni, who wanted to keep his scheme largely the same under the premise of “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” Hurts, now a bona fide franchise quarterback, was looking for greater authority over the offense, according to two sources close to him. He and Johnson wanted the system to evolve and become more layered, team sources said.\n\n“When Brian got [promoted], I think he thought, ‘I could do the thing that I’ve wanted to do,’” a team source said. “That didn’t fly as much with Nick.”\n\nWhile head coach-quarterback meetings are not uncommon and something Sirianni had done before, the source believed, in this case they muddled the staff’s ability to convey one consistent message to the quarterback.\n\nThe Hurts-Sirianni dynamic does not work as well when it’s one-to-one, a team source said, requiring a third party to be prominently involved for the offense to run at a high level.\n\nJohnson got stuck in what team sources describe as an awkward spot trying to please a multitude of people in the building with conflicting viewpoints, most notably Hurts and Sirianni. The result was a watered-down version of Johnson, who was regarded around the league as a head coach in waiting. “He lost his identity,” a close observer said.\n\nWith the playoffs approaching and the hunt for improvement unending, Hurts made an unusual move. He called former Giants defensive coordinator Wink Martindale, who had parted ways with New York following Week 18.\n\n“I’ve been doing this for 40 years,” said Martindale, now the defensive coordinator at the University of Michigan, “and it’s the first time I’ve had an opposing quarterback call me up.”\n\nThey discussed weaknesses in Philadelphia’s protection and how New York tried to game-plan him.\n\nA major question following last season’s tailspin...is how the team will react when adversity hits, and how Sirianni will navigate it. Some close observers of the coaching landscape already have Philadelphia circled as an opening barring a strong showing by the team in 2024. Sirianni and Roseman have a good relationship and work closely together, but there’s little question as to which is on stronger footing when it comes to job security.\n\nNFL league links\n\nArticles\n\nESPN\n\n2024 NFL training camp: Position battles on each depth chart\n\nNew York Jets\n\nNo. 2 receiving option\n\nGarrett Wilson is the clear-cut WR1. After him, there are questions galore. Right now, Allen Lazard is starting on the opposite side, but he’s viewed as a placeholder until Mike Williams is activated from the physically unable to perform (PUP) list. Lazard, who received a four-year, $44 million contract in 2023, is off to a promising start in camp after a 23-catch season. He also has Aaron Rodgers’ stamp of approval (they were teammates in Green Bay), which never hurts. But let’s be realistic: He’s not on the same level as Williams. The question with Williams is, can he be the same player he was before ACL surgery last fall? Rodgers needs a viable No. 2 option to balance the field. — Rich Cimini\n\nBaltimore Ravens\n\nRight guard\n\nThe Ravens are replacing three starters on the offensive line, but it looks like Andrew Vorhees is the heavy favorite to win the left guard job and the hope is second-round pick Roger Rosengarten will take the spot at right tackle. The biggest battle remains at right guard, where Daniel Faalele, Malaesala Aumavae-Laulu and Ben Cleveland are contenders.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers\n\nQuarterback\n\nThough Russell Wilson entered training camp in “pole position” and it appeared the starting job would be his job to lose, Wilson’s conditioning test calf injury makes things interesting for the Steelers. With Wilson slowly ramping up, Justin Fields has taken nearly all of the first-team reps, and his best practice came in the team’s first padded practice Tuesday where he completed every pass attempt. Not only did he connect with George Pickens on a one-handed touchdown grab, but he also showed off his wheels in a couple of designed runs. Wilson is still likely in the lead for the job, but if Fields can make routine — and splash — plays consistently, this might be more of a competition than it initially appeared. — Brooke Pryor\n\nHouston Texans\n\nDefensive tackle\n\nFolorunso Fatukasi, Tim Settle Jr., Kurt Hinish, Khalil Davis and Mario Edwards Jr. are battling for starting time at defensive tackle.\n\nKansas City Chiefs\n\nLeft tackle\n\nWanya Morris returned to practice on Sunday after leaving early from the Chiefs’ previous session, but his presence didn’t alter the dynamics of his battle with rookie Kingsley Suamataia to be the starting left tackle. Suamataia, as he has for most of training camp, got all of the starters’ reps while Morris was working with the second team. Morris had also spent some time working at guard during previous practices.\n\nDallas Cowboys\n\nCenter\n\nThe pads have only just come on for the Cowboys at training camp, but it seems pretty clear that this is Brock Hoffman’s job to lose. He took all of the snaps with the first team in the spring and continues to do so in training camp. Zack Martin said Hoffman is a “natural leader,” which is a must at the center spot, despite his lack of experience. Third-round pick Cooper Beebe will get a chance to show what he can do in the preseason games but he is still getting accustomed to a new spot so much so that he works on his snaps in 7-on-7 work. — Todd Archer\n\nNew York Giants\n\nTight end\n\nWith Darren Waller retired, the Giants are looking to fill the void primarily with some combination of Daniel Bellinger, Lawrence Cager and rookie Theo Johnson. Bellinger is likely to be the starter, but who will fill pass catcher: Cager or Johnson? Cager started camp strong and coach Brian Daboll pegged him as one of the standouts of the spring, but he is now dealing with a hamstring injury. Johnson returned after starting camp on PUP with a hip problem. It’s anyone’s job to win this summer. — Jordan Raanan\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles\n\nCornerback\n\nThe starting spot opposite Darius Slay Jr. is up for grabs. Former Colt Isaiah Rodgers and up-and-comer Kelee Ringo have split time with the first team during training camp, each making strong cases for why they should get the nod. Rookie first-round pick Quinyon Mitchell, meanwhile, is seeing more and more snaps at the starting nickel post. He’s been sticky in coverage and appears to be handling the transition from the MAC to the pros well.\n\nMitchell is competing with veteran Avonte Maddox for the slot job. Overall, a defensive backfield that finished second-to-last in passing yards and passing touchdowns allowed in 2023 looks deeper and speedier than a year ago. — Tim McManus\n\nWashington Commanders\n\nLeft tackle\n\nWashington has rotated veteran Cornelius Lucas and rookie Brandon Coleman with the starting offensive line at left tackle. It’s the one spot along the line most up for grabs. Both also have worked at right side as well. Washington drafted Coleman in the third round — he played both tackle and guard at TCU. Lucas has started 47 games during his first 10 seasons, serving primarily as a swing tackle. Coleman has impressed early with his footwork and balance. If Coleman wins the job, Washington might have solved a premium position for a few years. The Commanders would then have two expensive positions — with quarterback Jayden Daniels — filled by players on rookie deals. — John Keim\n\nGreen Bay Packers\n\nKicker\n\nThere were actually three kickers in camp until rookie James Turner was cut last Tuesday, leaving veteran Greg Joseph to battle incumbent Anders Carlson. The Packers wanted competition after Carlson, a sixth-round pick last year, struggled at the end of his rookie season (including a missed 41-yard field goal late in the NFC divisional playoff loss to the 49ers). It’s been a close competition, but Joseph has a slight advantage through 10 practices based solely on the numbers.\n\nKicking from similar distances throughout camp, Joseph has made 36 of 40 field goals, while Carlson was 33-of-40. In perhaps the most important test so far, though, Carlson was 8-of-9 in Saturday’s practice in front of more than 60,000 at Lambeau Field, while Joseph missed twice. Carlson’s only miss was from 57 yards. Joseph missed from 54 and 57. When asked whether the competition would extend throughout the preseason, coach Matt LaFleur said, “I would anticipate that, but things change.” — Rob Demovsky\n\nDiscussion topics\n\nAthlon Sports\n\nDeion Sanders chaotic culture turns into locker room violence in Colorado\n\nMany programs pride themselves on nurturing talent, but that’s not Prime’s approach, and it’s becoming apparent. He desires “ready-made” players who can deliver immediate results. It’s not about gradually building up; it’s about achieving success right now.\n\nThis approach has its flaws, and the foundation of Coach Prime’s Camelot is starting to show cracks. What was portrayed to the public as an outstanding program is missing the mark. Sanders seizes the spotlight in front of cameras but then vanishes until the next media opportunity. Outside of these appearances, it’s all about promoting his products and services. The real question for those skeptical of the hype is why there’s constant turnover within the program?\n\nSome players aren’t suited for “Prime Time,” or at least that’s what the CU staff wants everyone to believe. But conversations with those who’ve left Boulder reveals the true nature of the culture within the Buffaloes program. A few former players have spoken anonymously to Athlon, fearing retaliation, if they went on the record.\n\n“It’s like a real-life Grand Theft Auto video game,” one former player said. “There are many distractions with fights, guns, and money floating around. The environment is unlike any I’ve come from before.”\n\nAnother former player went deeper into the violent incidents within CU’s football program, recounting three separate alleged occurrences over the past year, each unfathomable in any normal locker room. This insight sheds light on what happened with former five-star talent Cormani McClain and why his experience in Boulder was negative.\n\n“Cormani was taking a lot of heat from everyone,” said the former player. “At the same time Coach Prime was saying he was in the doghouse and needed to improve, Cormani was getting bullied by Shilo (Sanders). After the Oregon State game, Shilo slapped him several times, which left Cormani screaming ‘I’m going to kill you’ repeatedly. After that, you could tell he wasn’t mentally there. It’s hard when the coaches you trust are calling you derogatory names on the practice field.”\n\nThis violence often seemed to come from personal vendettas, but not always. Jordan Seaton, another five-star recruit, was allegedly bullied into “proving his manhood” and picked to fight former CU lineman Savion Washington. In April, the two were said to have exchanged blows, leaving both bloody. Witnesses described it as “two bears scrapping for food.”\n\nWhile bullying was also a common theme, there was another alleged incident involving a gambling debt between backup QB Colton Allen and wide receiver Kaleb Mathis. Days after the Seaton-Washington melee, the son of Kevin Mathis, who’s CU’s defensive back coach, was asked to pay Allen over a gambling debt in excess of $10,000, according to a former CU player. When Mathis refused, he allegedly proceeded to punch Allen repeatedly in the locker room, with players and coaches witnessing the assault.\n\nAthlonSports reporter offers more details on Colorado football locker room drama, calls out CU’s gun culture\n\nCorder said that gun culture was “rampant” in Colorado’s locker room.\n\n“It’s rampant there,” Corder said of the gun allegations behind the scenes at CU. “There’s a video that’s circulating that I found after the piece, where they’re asking, I believe it’s Bucky, is going around asking who’s the most strapped on the team. And people are giving their opinions. It’s not just one person. It’s multiple people.”"
