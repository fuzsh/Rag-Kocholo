        "text": "Phoenix Brophy Prep 2027 receiver Donovan McNabb Jr., is making his mark as a pass catcher. While his father Donovan McNabb spent his 13-year NFL career behind center, leading the Philadelphia Eagles to a Super Bowl spot, the younger McNabb intends to catch passes for his football career.\n\nHe picked up his first offer earlier this summer, from Northern Arizona.\n\nAnd now, as he's set to begin his sophomore campaign, he's hoping to add more offers to the fray.\n\n\"It was a big relief to get the offer from NAU and I was very excited,\" said McNabb. \"It proved to me that all the work I've done will pay off. We went up there for a team 7v7, and before we started playing our games, I talked to the staff up there.\n\n\"We were talking about the games and they said they would be seeing how I would perform. It was my first time connecting with them and then they offered me as a receiver.\"\n\nMore schools have been keeping tabs."
