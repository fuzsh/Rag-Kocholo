        "text": "Joseph E. Kernan, the 48th governor of Indiana and the last Democrat to serve in the position, died Wednesday after a battle with Alzheimer's disease.\n\nKernan, 74, served as Indiana lieutenant governor under Frank O'Bannon from 1997 to 2003. After O'Bannon's death by stroke in September 2003, Kernan filled O'Bannon's term as governor until 2005, losing a bid for reelection to Republican Mitch Daniels.\n\nAs governor, he's perhaps most known for pushing to fund all-day kindergarten eight years before it became reality in Indiana and for appointing Kathy Davis as the first woman to serve as the state's lieutenant governor. He also led South Bend for a dozen years as mayor and was a Vietnam war veteran.\n\nAfter serving as governor, Kernan was appointed by Daniels to co-chair a statewide commission on local government reform, along with former Indiana Supreme Court Chief Justice Randall Shepard of Evansville.\n\nGov. Eric Holcomb directed flags to be flown at half staff through sunset Aug. 5 to honor Kernan.\n\n\"Through his decades of servant leadership and sacrifice,\" Holcomb said, \"Joe Kernan modeled all the best of what it means to be a Hoosier and his legacy will continue to live on in each of us whom he inspired.\"\n\nEvansville Mayor Lloyd Winnecke and his predecessor in office, Jonathan Weinzapfel, joined those making tributes to the former governor.\n\n\"Today, we remember a model public servant, Joe Kernan,\" Winnecke said in a prepared statement. \"I appreciated former Governor Kernan’s leadership — along with Supreme Court Justice Randall T. Shepard — on reforming and restructuring local government in Indiana. We ask Evansville residents to keep the Kernan family in their thoughts and prayers.\"\n\nWeinzapfel said in a Facebook post: \"Joe Kernan was a war hero, an exemplary public servant and a friend. He cared deeply about people and made a huge difference for South Bend, the State of Indiana and the nation. Keeping (Kernan's wife) Maggie, his family and many friends in our thoughts and prayers today.\"\n\nShepard said he has fond memories of working with Kernan on local government reforms, many of which were adopted.\n\n\"Our experiences together confirmed what everybody could see in daily life, which is that he was fully committed to spending his energy and ingenuity in improving cities like South Bend and the greater state of Indiana,\" Shepard told the Courier & Press. \"He was as good an example of a fine public servant as you could hope to imagine. Just a genuinely nice person to stand with and talk to.\"\n\nLt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch of Evansville said in a tweet: \"(I'm) joining Hoosiers all across our state in mourning the loss of our former governor, Joe Kernan. He was a model servant leader who devoted his life to the service of his country, state and local community. Praying for his entire family and remembering all he did to inspire us.\"\n\nKernan spoke at the University of Southern Indiana's 2003 commencement. His remarks touched on the importance of kindness.\n\n\"Of all the challenges we face I believe that bigotry is the greatest barrier to our living a life where we recognize that we are all God's children — equally — every day,\" Kernan told the USI graduates. \"Intolerance is one of the simplest, and most destructive, of human feelings. And the more certain and self-righteous we become in knowing that our way is the right way, and the only way, and that those who are different must be wrong, the more destructive it becomes.\"\n\nPence, Buttigieg join praise of Kernan\n\nVice President Mike Pence, Indiana's former Republican governor, said he and his wife Karen Pence were deeply saddened by Kernan's death.\n\n\"As lieutenant governor and then governor of Indiana,\" Pence said, \"Joe Kernan was a steady hand of leadership at a difficult time for our state. Even though our politics differed, Joe Kernan was always kind, always willing to work together for Hoosiers, and Joe Kernan was my friend.\"\n\nFormer South Bend mayor and one-time presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg posted on Twitter there will not be another like Kernan.\n\n\"South Bend will always be proud of his heroism in uniform and his leadership as our mayor and governor,\" Buttigieg wrote. \"And his friends will always remember his exuberant joy, his compassion for the vulnerable, his ready smile, and his inimitable laugh.\"\n\nKernan known for personal touch in South Bend\n\nKernan’s adult life began as a United States Navy lieutenant. He and his co-pilot were shot down while on a reconnaissance mission over North Vietnam in 1972. He spent 11 months as a POW in Hanoi, including at the infamous \"Hanoi Hilton\" prison.\n\nAfter the war, Kernan married his longtime girlfriend, the former Maggie McCullough. He had a bachelor's degree from Notre Dame and went to work at Procter & Gamble in Cincinnati in late 1974 as a manufacturing supervisor.\n\nBut the Kernans wanted to return to South Bend, so he took a job as a sales representative at Schwarz Paper Co. in the city. In 1980, South Bend Mayor Roger Parent asked him to serve as the city controller in his administration.\n\nKernan, who had majored in government, found he liked working for the city.\n\nIn 1987, he was elected to his first of three consecutive terms as mayor of South Bend. During his tenure as South Bend mayor from 1988 to 1997, he kept his phone number listed and residents often called him at home. He left office as the longest-serving mayor in South Bend's history, though his successor, Steve Luecke, surpassed him.\n\n“One of the brightest people I know and very serious about getting things done,” said Lou Pierce, owner of Mishawaka-based The Big Idea Company, who for 40 years has consulted Kernan on strategies. “I never met anyone like that.”\n\nPierce said he once asked Kernan what was the best job he ever had. His response: \"mayor.\"\n\n“As governor, you don’t get to see up close how your decisions affect people,” Kernan explained. “As mayor, you see it every day.”\n\nWhile mayor, Kernan was known for his personal touch. A longtime friend, Denise Sullivan, recalled a day when Kernan drove by a home on a busy street with the front yard adorned in colorful impatiens. Kernan stopped and wrote on a card that he left in the front door: “Thanks for making South Bend so beautiful.\"\n\n“Who does that?” Sullivan, who worked as an assistant in the mayor’s office, recently told Notre Dame Magazine. “He just took that little moment to say thank you for somebody planting flowers in their yard.”\n\nIn his time leading the city, Kernan oversaw several key development projects and helped establish the Center for the Homeless after a fire destroyed an apartment building in 1998. The city's collaboration with Notre Dame on the project drew praise because the university had not been much involved in city issues.\n\nKernan’s response to the fire “was his most defining moment as mayor,” said Lou Nanni, who was hired as director of the Center for the Homeless two year after it opened. “The mark of a community is what it does for the least among us. It speaks to the soul of a community.”\n\nTo mixed reviews, Kernan also put together a taxpayer-heavy financial deal to lure the College Football Hall of Fame from Cincinnati to downtown South Bend. It operated in South Bend for 17 years before moving to Atlanta in 2014.\n\nKernan elected as lieutenant governor\n\nIn 1996, O’Bannon asked Kernan to join him as the candidate for lieutenant governor. The two had gotten to know each other on a trip through Europe in 1990 following the fall of the Berlin Wall. At the time, O'Bannon was Evan Bayh's lieutenant governor and Kernan was mayor of South Bend.\n\n\"Joe carried with him a box from a family in South Bend,\" Judy O'Bannon recalled Wednesday, \" which contained a new pair of shoes, to give to their relative in need who lived in the former communist Poland. He carried that box in his luggage across several countries, including the Soviet Union, until we got to Poland and could hand deliver the shoes to the relative.\"\n\nO’Bannon and Kernan were elected in November 1996 and won again in 2000.\n\nAs O'Bannon neared the end of his second term, Kernan insisted he had no interest in running for governor. Democrats had held the office for 16 years, making Kernan's decision the talk of the town.\n\nHis viewpoint changed when O'Bannon died of a stroke in September 2003. Kernan was sworn in as the state’s 48th governor and made history immediately by appointing Kathy Davis as Indiana’s first female lieutenant governor. It set a precedent. Only women have been elected to that position since, though Holcomb was appointed briefly in 2016 before becoming governor.\n\n\"Joe Kernan was a partner in governing and leading Indiana with Frank,\" Judy O'Bannon said, \"and most importantly the best of friend to both of us and to his beloved South Bend and Hoosier state.\"\n\nIn November 2003, Kernan announced he would run for governor. While he was the incumbent, Kernan faced an uphill battle. Republican Mitch Daniels was travelling Indiana in a campaign RV with President George W. Bush's blessing as \"My Man Mitch,\" pointing out economic hardships and job losses in the state.\n\nKernan made up ground late in the campaign criticizing Daniels' plans to privatize, sell or lease state assets. Kernan also began a high profile push to convince the state legislature to add full-day kindergarten for all public schools. The Republican-led Indiana Senate, citing cost concerns, declined to pass the bill.\n\nDaniels won with 53% to Kernan's 46%. Eight years later, Daniels convinced the General Assembly to fund full-day kindergarten, bringing to a close part of Kernan's legacy.\n\n\"Joe Kernan was at different times my ally, opponent, and advisor, but always a friend to me, and as far as I could tell to everyone he met,\" Daniels said. \"In wartime and in peace, he embodied patriotism and the goodwill toward all we associate with the term 'Hoosier.'\"\n\nDaniels commissions the Kernan-Shepard report\n\nWhile Kernan lost the 2004 election to Daniels, the two later became political allies.\n\nIn 2007, Daniels asked Kernan and Indiana Supreme Court Chief Justice Randall T. Shepard to chair a bipartisan commission to examine local government reform.\n\nDaniels told IndyStar he and Kernan had both campaigned on updating Indiana's antiquated government structure. Daniels said he knew reforming government would take a bipartisan approach and so asked Kernan for help.\n\n\"I couldn't think of a more well-respected figure,\" Daniels said Wednesday, \"and he agreed willingly.\"\n\nThe two delivered the Kernan-Shepard report, which called for 27 changes, perhaps most prominently the elimination of township government, shifting its responsibilities to the county level.\n\nWhile Daniels supported the plan, the legislature never did eliminate township government. Over time, the majority of township assessors were eliminated, and county assessors began managing all property assessments.\n\nDaniels said his administration did implement many of the changes, including anti-nepotism rules and consolidating library districts.\n\nShepard told the Courier & Press he's proud of what the Kernan-Shepard report accomplished.\n\n\"Over the long haul, the transfer of the role in township assessor duties to county assessors will have a good impact in not only the fairness of taxation on the local level but also a favorable impact on the Indiana economy,\" Shepard said.\n\nDr. Woody Myers, the Democratic nominee for governor, said Kernan was a true statesman.\n\n\"History will forever remember his dedication to Indiana and his selfless service to Hoosiers,\" Myers said.\n\nKernan retires from politics\n\nAside from his stint on the local government commission, Kernan largely retired from politics.\n\nHe went back to South Bend after leaving office and taught as an adjunct professor at Notre Dame, which had given him an honorary doctorate degree while he was lieutenant governor.\n\nJohn I. Jenkins, president of the University of Notre Dame, said Kernan was always a personal supporter and friend to the university.\n\n“Joe Kernan’s many and noteworthy contributions to Notre Dame, our community, the state and our nation cannot be overstated,” Jenkins said. “In addition to his government service, he was a beloved civic leader who never shied away from challenges.\"\n\nIn 2005, Kernan, who had played catcher and utility infielder as a student at Notre Dame, convinced 50 members of the community to purchase the minor league South Bend Silver Hawks baseball team. The team, now known as the South Bend Cubs, was close to leaving the city.\n\n\"We're safe at home,\" said a visibly giddy Kernan at the announcement of the sale. \"Baseball is here to stay in South Bend.\"\n\nIn 2011, Andrew Berlin of Chicago-based Berlin Packaging took over ownership of the baseball club.\n\nKernan also became involved in several community and political causes.\n\nIn 2009, he donned red high-heel shoes for the YWCA’s Men’s March to End Violence Against Women. The fundraiser, dubbed “Walk a Mile in Her Shoes,” saw Kernan lead a group of men in high heels across town to Coveleski Stadium, where they made their way around the bases.\n\n“I’m like 5-11 now,” he quipped at the finish. “It feels pretty good.”\n\nIn 2017, South Bend renamed Viewing Park — on Northside Boulevard between Howard Park and the Farmer's Market — as Gov. Joe Kernan Park. It was a spot where South Bend residents often saw Kernan, an avid kayaker, out on the St. Joseph River.\n\nNo public services\n\nKernan is survived by his wife Maggie and seven siblings who live in the state of Maine and the Washington, DC area.\n\nDue to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there will be no public services.\n\nArrangements are being made by Welsheimer’s Funeral Home in South Bend. Kernan has expressed a preference for Welsheimer’s because the funeral home sponsored his Little League team in 1958 when he was 12 years old.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made to the Veterans Fund at the University of Notre Dame.
