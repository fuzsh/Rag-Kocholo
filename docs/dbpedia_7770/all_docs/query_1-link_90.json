        "text": "June 29, 1956: Creation of the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways is authorized by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956.\n\nNovember 1971: Indiana's original 157-mile stretch of Interstate 69 is completed, running from the north side of Indianapolis northeast past Fort Wayne and on to the Michigan state line. Flint, Mich., is the interstate's north end in the 1970s, but later segments extend it to the Canadian border by 1992.\n\nFebruary 1990: Donahue and Associates publishes congressionally mandated study assessing the economic feasibility of three prospective highway corridors linking Indianapolis and Evansville. Consultants conclude that none of the routes meet the minimum threshold for going forward with the project.\n\nNov. 10, 1992: Representatives from seven states meet in Memphis, Tennessee, to promote effort to stretch I-69 from Michigan to Texas, including the Indianapolis-to-Evansville leg. The group is called the “Interstate 69 Mid-Continent Highway Coalition.”\n\nDec. 9, 1993: The Evansville-to-Indianapolis section of Interstate 69 is added to the National Transportation System, the blueprint that lawmakers at the time, including local Congressman Frank McCloskey, said would be used to make “future investment decisions” for the nation’s roads.\n\nAug. 26, 1995: A feasibility study finds that the Interstate 69 project linking Indianapolis to Houston via Evansville “would create enough long-term economic benefits to more than offset the cost.”\n\nOct. 31, 1995: Federal Highway Administration delays release of draft enivronmental impact statement for I-69, requiring “stronger economic arguments for the road.”\n\nJan. 13, 1997: Frank O’Bannon sworn in as Indiana governor, succeeding fellow Democrat Evan Bayh.\n\nApril 24, 1997: Officials from INDOT, Federal Highway Administration and EPA meet to “jump start” environmental impact statement, with eye on beginning construction in July 1999.\n\nSept. 21, 1997: Indiana officials announce the awarding of seven engineering contracts for design work on the Evansville-to-Bloomington section of Interstate 69.\n\nApril 29, 1997: The I-69 project gets national attention when NBC News airs a report on the Evansville-to-Bloomington section of the highway during a segment called “The Fleecing of America.” Opponents of the “new terrain” route say the Evansville-to-Terre Haute-to-Indianapolis option is cheaper and more efficient.\n\nNov. 18, 1998: State officials announce a delay of I-69 work of 18 to 24 months as INDOT starts work on a new plan for Federal Highway Administration officials that will include not only the segment between Bloomington and Indianapolis, but also the possibility of routing the highway through Terre Haute.\n\nMay 18, 1999: INDOT officials concede that decision on whether I-69 extension should be built — and where — is still two years away.\n\nJuly 10, 1999: 22 Indiana mayors present a petition to Gov. Frank O’Bannon asking for the new-terrain route to be selected and for construction to begin. Signers include Evansville’s Frank McDonald II, Bloomington’s John Fernandez and mayors from Loogootee, Petersburg, Oakland City, Linton, Washington, Princeton, Boonville and Mount Vernon, among others.\n\nNov. 24, 1999: Bernardin Lochmueller and Associates awarded $7.7 million contract to spend two years preparing environmental impact study on proposed highway, including the U.S. 41/Interstate 70 alternative. Construction start eyed for 2005.\n\nDec. 1, 2000: INDOT officials release 14 possible routes for I-69 in southwestern Indiana.\n\nDec. 4, 2002: U.S. Department of the Interior officially backs the U.S. 41/Interstate 70 route as “the most environmentally preferable” route for Interstate 69.\n\nJan. 9, 2003: Indiana Gov. Frank O’Bannon chooses a direct route for Interstate 69 between Evansville and Indianapolis would reduce travel time to Indianapolis by 26 minutes and would cost $1.7 billion to build.\n\nSept. 13, 2003: Indiana Gov. Frank O’Bannon dies. Lt. Gov. Joe Kernan, former mayor of South Bend, will finish O’Bannon’s term in office through 2004.\n\nSept. 26, 2003: During campaign tour of Indiana, Republican Mitch Daniels says he “to be the governor who builds this road and puts an end to the study and the political football.”\n\nNov. 26, 2003: Daniels officially advocates for direct route for I-69 in southwestern Indiana, and that the road should be a “priority” for the state.\n\nDec. 18, 2003: I-69 environmental impact statement unveiled in Evansville by INDOT commissioner J. Bryan Nicol. Estimated cost of interstate set at $1.78 billion, includes $77 million to add forest acreage.\n\nFeb. 11, 2004: Highway chiefs from Indiana and Kentucky announce that I-69 will use Interstate 164 as a loop around the city of Evansville and a path into Kentucky.\n\nJan. 10, 2005: Mitch Daniels is sworn in as Indiana governor.\n\nSept. 26, 2005: Daniels says construction of I-69 could begin by 2008 and finish by 2018, if state lawmakers would agree to build the highways as a toll road and possibly leasing it to a private company to run.\n\nDec. 13, 2005: INDOT Commissioner Tom Sharp says Indianapolis-to-Evansville highway won’t be built unless lawmakers allow it to be a toll road.\n\nJan. 23, 2006: A private company offers Indiana $3.85 billion to operate the Indiana Toll Road, providing enough money for all transportation projects in the next 10 years, including starting on the Interstate 69 extension to Evansville. Daniels said he still wants I-69 to be a toll road, however.\n\nMarch 13, 2006: Indiana House and Senate negotiators reach a deal on Daniels’ proposed highway plan, allowing the 75-year lease of the Indiana Toll Road and keeping open the possibility that I-69 in Southwestern Indiana could be a toll road.\n\nOct. 2, 2006: Environmental groups and several business owners file federal lawsuit to block design and planning of the Evansville-to-Indianapolis leg of I-69, claiming INDOT “ignored harmful environmental impacts.”\n\nNov. 9, 2006: Daniels changes course, says there will be no tolls on Interstate 69 in Southwestern Indiana. He proposed a series of tollways in Indianapolis suburbs to help pay for the highway, a plan that eventually met defeat in the Indiana Legislature.\n\nApril 29, 2007: Indiana lawmakers approve a state budget that included $119 million for the Evansville-to-Crane Interstate 69 construction.\n\nDec. 11, 2007: Judge rules in favor of INDOT in I-69 lawsuit filed by environmental groups.\n\nJuly 16, 2008: Groundbreaking for Section 1 (13 miles from Evansville to Oakland City).\n\nSept. 29, 2009: First 2 miles of the new Interstate 69 opens between Interstate 64 and Ind. 68.\n\nApril 30, 2010: Route for Section 2 (29 miles from Oakland City to Washington) approved by federal government; work on section began later that year.\n\nJuly 21, 2010: Groundbreaking on Section 3 (25 miles from U.S. 50 to U.S. 231).\n\nMarch 9, 2012: The Bloomington/Metropolitan Planning Organization votes 7-6 in favor of adding the final segment of I-69 Section 4 to the group's long-range transportation plan. The decision allowed federal funding to be used to complete Section 4 to Ind. 37.\n\nApril 17, 2012: Groundbreaking on Section 4 (27 new-terrain miles from Crane to Bloomington).\n\nNov. 19, 2012: Sections 1-3 fully opened between Evansville and Crane.\n\nNovember 2014: INDOT crews replace Interstate 164 signs with I-69 signs, assimilating the 20-mile spur.\n\nApril 29, 2015: Groundbreaking on Section 5 (21 miles following Ind. 37's path from Bloomington to Martinsville).\n\nDec. 9, 2015: Interstate 69’s Section 4 (Crane to Bloomington) opens to the public."
