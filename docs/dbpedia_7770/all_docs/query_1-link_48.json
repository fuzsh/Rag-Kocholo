        "text": "1896 – 1911\n\nOn March 3, 1896, the South Carolina General Assembly enacted legislation establishing the Colored Normal, Industrial, Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina. Thomas E. Miller, a former Congressman from South Carolina, became the first president (1896-1911). During Dr. Miller’s tenure, and that of his initial faculty of thirteen South Carolinians, the College plant consisted of 135 acres, eight small buildings, a minimal dairy herd, and a few other farm animals. Because of the meager facilities, academic instruction was given primarily on logs hewn from the campus forest—logs that were later made into lumber for the first dormitory and classroom buildings\n\n1911 – 1932\n\nUpon President Miller’s retirement, Dr. Robert Shaw Wilkinson, a Charlestonian and Professor of Physics at the College, succeeded to the presidency. His twenty-one year administration witnessed an increase in faculty and student enrollment, an established income from both federal and state sources, an expansion in the building program, a cooperative working relationship with Clemson University and Claflin College, the initiation of a State Teacher Summer School, and the celebration of the College’s twenty-fifth birthday.\n\n1932 – 1949\n\nThe death of President Wilkinson on March 13, 1932 catapulted Dr. Miller F. Whittaker to Acting President, subsequently to President in May 1932. Among the milestones under the aegis of President Whittaker (1932-1949), a former Director of the Mechanical Department at the College, were these: the establishment of a Law School, the establishment of a South Carolina State College Extension School with units in fifteen South Carolina communities, the establishment of a Reserve Officers’ Training Corps Infantry Unit, and in 1933, the achievement of the college’s appearance on the approved list of colleges by the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. The first formal observance of Founders’ Day was held in March 1938.\n\n1950 – 1967\n\nFrom 1950 to 1967, Dr. Benner C. Turner, former Dean of the Law School, effected these developments in the College: a rapid growth of both the undergraduate and graduate enrollments, an increase in the number of faculty and staff, an increase in the number of doctoral faculty, the reorganization of the administrative and structural areas, major improvements in the physical plant to include the renovation of buildings and construction of many new buildings such as a new academic building, dormitories for both men and women, and a cafeteria. New walkways, drives, roads and attractive landscaping added to the beauty of the campus and the comfort of its inhabitants.\n\n1968 – 1986\n\nOn June 23, 1968, Dr. M. Maceo Nance, Jr., former Vice President for Business and Finance, succeeded to the presidency of the College after a one-year tenure as Acting President. Dr. Nance continued to build upon the foundation laid by his predecessors. The Nance administration embarked upon a meaningful role to be performed by the College in the local community and, by extension, in the world community via the creation of a wholesome, relevant public image, the acquisition of new sources of income, the ensuring of sound curricula, sincere students, dedicated teachers and alumni, and a burgeoning physical expansion.\n\nMost outstanding among the large number of additions to the physical plant under the administration of President Nance were the following: Smith-Hammond-Middleton Memorial Center, a Health and Physical Education Building (1968); addition to Hodge Hall Science Building (1968); addition to Kirkland W. Green Student Center (1970); Ko W. G. Donma Administration Building (1970); housing for married students, Queens’ Village, Phase 1, 12 Apartments (1971); 20 Apartments (1975); Sojourner Truth Hall, Women’s Residence Hall (1972); Martin Luther King, Jr. Auditorium (1974); M. Maceo Nance, Jr. Classroom Building (1974); John H. Mitchell Hall, Men’s Residence Hall (1975); I. P. Stanback Museum & Planetarium (1979); the Crawford-Zimmerman Service Complex (1983); and the School of Business Algernon S. Belcher Complex (1986).\n\n1986 - 1992\n\nOn July 1, 1986, upon the retirement of President Nance, Dr. Albert E. Smith became the sixth President of South Carolina State College. During President Smith’s tenure, the College established working relationships with several major corporations including Westinghouse, Hughes Aircraft, AT&T and Xerox. The School of Freshman Studies was created, and an Honors Program was established. Fundraising efforts brought nearly $3 million to the College. Ground was broken in late 1991 for a new women’s residence hall. President Smith was instrumental in efforts to gain university status for the College.\n\nOn January 13, 1992, the Board of Trustees named Dr. Carl A. Carpenter, Interim President of South Carolina State College.
