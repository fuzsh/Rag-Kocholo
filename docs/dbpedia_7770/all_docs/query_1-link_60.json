        "text": "Snaps in 2023: 560\n\nDespite playing behind one of the greatest tight end prospects of our lifetime, Oscar Delp has had a solid career at Georgia (24 catches for 284 yards and three touchdowns in 2023). But the question now is whether Delp is ready to take over for the production of Brock Bowers in Athens? I would wager yes. Skilled as a blocker and receiver, Delp has the size and skills to be an impactful player on a loaded Bulldog offense.\n\nSnaps in 2023: 204\n\nAvery Johnson had a huge debut as a freshman despite only starting two games in 2023. Johnson was a weapon rushing the football (two games over 70 yards rushing) and is poised to have a big year in Manhattan as a full-time starter. He struggled with his accuracy for much of the season, settling in at a completion percentage of 56. If he can take his passing game to the next level, watch out.\n\nSnaps in 2023: 569\n\nGreen shined as a freshman at Oklahoma playing both tackle and guard. At Missouri this season, Green is expected to start at guard, his more natural position. Green is a high end prospect with a bright future. Expect a big season from him on a Tigers team that could surprise in the SEC. Missouri did a nice job in the portal retooling its offensive line.\n\nSnaps in 2023: 811\n\nKadyn Proctor\n\nProctor made his way back to Alabama after skipping spring football at Iowa. As a true freshman for the Crimson Tide, Proctor started every game and got better as the year progressed. I'm not sold that Proctor is a blind side protector in the future, but at 6-foot-7, 370-pounds, he is a giant human. Proctor has the skills to be a really good offensive lineman if he can button up his technique. Alabama needs him to be at his best this season while they break in a new right tackle.\n\nSnaps in 2023: 506\n\nA freshman All-American in 2023, Khalil Barnes is primed to have a huge season for Clemson after forcing three fumbles and tallying three interceptions in seven starts. As his reps increased, Barnes finished the season strong and proved to be a force on the back end in both phases of the game. The 6-foot, 195-pound safety has a high ceiling and the room for improvement that I think we will see this season.\n\nSnaps in 2023: 340\n\nTrey Amos gets his opportunity to shine on the big stage this season after getting 340 snaps last year in Tuscaloosa while backing up Kool-Aid McKinstry. Amos made the most of his opportunities which included a few key plays coming off the bench in the SEC Championship game. At 6-foot-1, 190-pounds, Amos has a lot of traits that will translate at the next level and he's played a lot of football, first at Louisiana and then last season at Alabama (he has over 1,600 career snaps). Expect a big year in Oxford for Amos and the Rebels in 2024.\n\nSnaps in 2023: 504\n\nNash Hutmacher is of the most underrated defensive tackles in the country. He plays with incredible balance and leverage, and his wrestling background is evident when you watch his film. Hutmacher is poised for a big season as a disruptive presence in the middle of the blackshirt defense. Expect his draft value to rise this season.\n\nSnaps in 2023: 532\n\nAntwaun Powell-Ryland is a twitchy and relentless edge rusher who tallied 9.5 sacks and added 14.5 TFLs for a much improved Hokie defensive front in 2023. APR is a natural pass rusher with wide variety of pass rushing moves at his disposal. He has an excellent get-off, speed around the edge, and can run the hoop to cause chaos. Expect a dominant season for Powell-Ryland and a Hokie defense that will to surprise people this season in the ACC.\n\nSnaps in 2023: 387\n\nMoose Muhammad III quickly fell out of favor with Jimbo Fisher in College Station, but expect the former four-star to have a breakout season under new Texas A&M offensive coordinator Collin Klein. Muhammad is a big bodied, strong receiver who has the ability to make contested catches in traffic and the speed to be a deep threat. Klein will make it a priority to utilize Muhammed's vast skill-set.\n\nSnaps in 2023: 232\n\nLuke Hasz started off his freshman campaign on fire (16 passes for 253 yards and three touchdowns over five games) until he suffered a shoulder injury that ended his season in week five. In 2024, expect Hasz to pick up where he left off. He can be a big-time weapon for the Hogs and a consistent chain-mover who will now play like a veteran.\n\nSnaps in 2023: 276\n\nChris Tyree is a dynamic player who did most of his damage in the middle of the field last season. Tyree averaged about 25 catches a year at Notre Dame, but I expect him to get two times that many opportunities as Virginia's No. 1 pass-catching threat. In Charlottesville, Tyree will have the chance to flash his ability to also stretch the field as a deep threat.\n\nSnaps in 2023: 425\n\nMitchell Evans had his 2023 season cut short after eight games with an ACL but is expected to make a full recovery. Evans has soft hands and has the ability to make defenders miss and can be a big-time weapon in the short to intermediate areas. Evans needs to polish up his blocking to become an elite tight end.\n\nSnaps in 2023: 554\n\nCameron Horsley has already been a force in the ACC (41 total tackles, three TFLs, three PBUs in 2023), but on the national level I'm not sure people know too much about him. At 6-foot-4, 306-pounds, Horsley is great against the run, stout at the point, and counters well with his hands to shed blocks. He is an excellent athlete as well. If Horsley can take his pass rush to the next level in 2024 then watch out.\n\nSnaps: 238\n\nDarius Taylor was one of the best backs in the country last year but missed six games due to injury. He racked up 800 yards and five touchdowns and had four games where he rushed for over 100 yards. Taylor is not a burner, but is instead a rather patient and methodical back who will body-blow you and wait for his opportunity for an explosive run. Taylor's style fits a Minnesota team that values physicality and moving the ball on the ground.\n\nSnaps: 476\n\nGavin Bartholomew is not a stranger to the field but has caught some buzz of late as a player to watch. I can see why. He is a natural receiver that attacks the ball and is a fluid runner with excellent game speed. Bartholomew caught only 19 balls last year but as clear mismatch, he deserves twice many targets in 2024. Bartholomew's blocking can improve but I would not be surprised to see him as a second or third round NFL draft pick next year.\n\nSnaps in 2023: 302\n\nBenjamin Brahmer made his presence felt in a big way as a freshman in 2023 (28 receptions for 352 yards and two touchdowns). He still has a ton of potential to unlock. At 6-foot-7, 240-pounds, Brahmer is good route runner who moves well with the ball in his hands. He has an excellent catch radius, attacks the ball, and has soft hands. Brahmer will be a household name soon.\n\nSnaps in 2023: 395\n\nJay Toia has a quick first step, is violent at the point, and yet is still very elusive in congested areas. On tape, you can clearly see why Toia was a coveted player when he hit the portal (he returned to Westwood). He has the ability to be a game-wrecker inside but his pass rush moves still need some fine-tuning. That is the one thing holding Toia back from being elite.\n\nSnaps in 2023: 554\n\nSavion Williams is a jumbo receiver with a ton of talent but only caught 41 passes last season. Williams is a way under-the-radar player who was vastly underused compared to his ability. I think Williams is a Day 1 NFL Draft talent. He has the speed, great length and is not scared to make contested catches in the middle of the field. With more opportunities, expect a dominant season for Williams at TCU in 2024.\n\nSnaps in 2023: 155\n\nGarrett Nussmeier finally gets his time to shine after being behind Heisman Trophy winner Jayden Daniels. Nussmeier shined in his only start of his career when he threw for almost 400 yards and three touchdowns in the 35-31 ReliaQuest Bowl win over Wisconsin.\n\nNussmeier isn't a stranger to action (over 400 career snaps) and will bring a veteran presence under center for the Tigers in 2024. He has played in 18 career games at LSU. Nussmeier has excellent mechanics and a big arm that can touch all the critical spots on the field. He is a better athlete than given credit for but will look to throw the ball first. I would not be surprised to see Nussmeier be big-time mover in the draft after this season.\n\nSnaps in 2023: 437\n\nPercy Lewis got his first real action of his college career last season when he started eight games for Mississippi State. With a giant 6-foot-7, 355-pound frame and the great length and feet, Lewis is a huge addition for an Auburn offense line that has lacked elite talent the last few seasons. His technique is raw but if he can put it all together, watch out.\n\nTexas' new No. 2 running back after the unfortunate season-ending injury to CJ Baxter, I think Tre Wisner is going to go from totally off the radar to a crucial part of a skill group that will help Texas make another College Football Playoff run. Wisner was a dogged special teams player as a true freshman and has a ton of toughness in his 6-foot, 200-pound frame. He saw carries in late-season blowouts and shined vs. Texas Tech, ripping off 60 yards and a score on seven carries, flashing elite speed and great vision. The former three-star recruit isn't the most coveted running back the Longhorns have ever signed, certainly, but I'd say he's set for a national surprise."
