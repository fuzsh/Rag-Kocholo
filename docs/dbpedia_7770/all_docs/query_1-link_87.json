        "text": "With the midterm election in the rearview mirror, Indiana politicians are turning their gaze to 2024, when Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb will be term-limited out of office.\n\nBoth the governor and one of Indiana's U.S. Senate seats will be on the ballot that year, which means there's plenty of options for officials seeking a higher office, or just a new one. Multiple candidates had signaled they would announce whether or not they'd run after the midterm.\n\nFor Republicans, the governor's office provides an opportunity to serve in a reliably red state, with a Republican-friendly legislative body. If a Republican can get past the primary, they have a good shot at wining the general election, based on recent election results, and accomplishing most of their agenda.\n\nIndiana politics:State senator joins Democrats in allowing vote on gay marriage bill\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats likely will have less interest among qualified candidates. No Democrat has been elected to the office since 2000, and in recent years getting elected as a statewide Democrat has proven challenging.\n\nIn order to get on the ballot, primary candidates need 500 signatures from Hoosiers in each congressional district.\n\nHere are some of the major political players who could run for Indiana governor in 2024, based on conversations with Republican and Democratic insiders. The most likely are at the top of the list. Other less likely names have been thrown around as well, such as former U.S. Sen. Joe Donnelly, U.S. Rep. Jim Banks and Republican Party Chairman Kyle Hupfer.\n\nEric Doden\n\nFormer president of the Indiana Economic Development Corp. Eric Doden announced he was running as a Republican back in the middle of 2021. He's remained the only candidate to officially enter the race so far, though that could soon change. Doden, a Fort Wayne businessman, said he has raised more than $5 million so far, and has already released a digital ad that costed five figures. He also has contributed personal money to his campaign, but he doesn't have as much name recognition as some of the other options on the list.\n\nDoden currently serves as president of Pago USA, a company that restores buildings in downtown areas, and is a founding partner of both Domo Development LLC, a development company, and Domo Ventures LLC, a private equity firm.\n\nJennifer McCormick\n\nJennifer McCormick, the former Indiana superintendent of public instruction, hasn't been coy about the fact that she is considering running as a Democrat to be governor in 2024. The last time she ran for office in 2016, it was as a Republican, but she has since participated in numerous Democratic party events and endorsed Democratic candidates.\n\nRecently she's been active on Twitter, quote tweeting tweets with \"2.0.2.4.\" She has formed an exploratory committee, and told IndyStar she hasn't made a firm decision but it \"very, very interested.\"\n\n\"I feel pretty confident that I will run,\" she said. \"It's just a matter of timing.\"\n\nSuzanne Crouch\n\nMultiple Republican insiders say Republican Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch is running for governor. She's held a lengthy list of public offices, including as a former state representative and state auditor, which means she has the connections to ensure she's a formidable fundraiser. As of the end of June, she had $2.6 million in her campaign finance account. That would be important should she run against someone who can self-fund.\n\n\"I'm seriously considering that opportunity to run for governor,\" she told IndyStar last week, \"and will have an official announcement later this month or beginning of next month.\"\n\nMike Braun\n\nRepublican U.S. Sen. Mike Braun has long been rumored to be eying a gubernatorial campaign. He helped statewide candidates campaign for their own elections this cycle, a telling sign. Braun previously said he wouldn't make an announcement on whether or not he'd run for reelection to the U.S. Senate until after the midterms, so such an announcement about his political future could be coming in a matter of weeks.\n\nBraun also supported the losing Sen. Rick Scott against Sen. Mitch McConnell for minority leader, which could be a signal he's a short timer.\n\n\"I'm going to make the decision based upon where I think I can have the most impact,\" Braun told reporters in January, \"and I'll make that decision sometime post midterm.\"\n\nBraun, who was first elected against Democrat Sen. Joe Donnelly in 2018, will spend the next two years in a Democratic-controlled Senate which may sway his final decision some. His exit would also open up his U.S. Senate seat for potentially its own crowded field of candidates. A spokesman for his campaign told IndyStar he had no updates on if he had decided to run for governor.\n\nThomas McDermott\n\nFresh off a decisive defeat in the U.S. Senate race against Sen. Todd Young, Democratic Hammond Mayor Thomas McDermott said he is considering a gubernatorial run in 2024. He sees the position as a natural fit for his talents and experience as a longtime mayor. He also thinks it would be easier to fundraise enough to be competitive in a state office race, more so than it was in a federal race.\n\n\"I'll be honest with you, ever since I first got involved in elected office, I've always aspired to be the governor,\" McDermott told IndyStar last week. \"That doesn't mean I'm doing it, but it's something that's always interested me.\"\n\nLocal city races are in 2023 though, so he'll have to decide quickly whether or not he wants to instead run for reelection.\n\nTrey Hollingsworth\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Trey Hollingsworth, who was first elected to serve Indiana's 9th Congressional District in 2016, declined to seek reelection this year, leaving the question of what he would do next up in the air.\n\n\"I want to be the change I want to see in this world, so, as I contemplate how I can work for you in new and better ways in the future, I won’t run for reelection this year,\" Hollingsworth said in an op-ed in January of this year when he announced his decision. \"You deserve a member of Congress totally and completely focused on the 9th District, and, though I have remained committed to that promise these three terms, now I will fight for you and us in different ways.\"\n\nHe was able to heavily finance his congressional run in 2016 with the help of his father, which means he likely would have the financial means to do so again for another position. He also, of course, could choose to seek Braun's Senate seat. Hollingsworth did not respond to questions through a spokesperson about whether or not he will run, but insiders say he hasn't done much recently to prepare for a campaign.\n\nJim Merritt\n\nFormer Indianapolis state Sen. Jim Merritt, a Republican, has long been interested in running for governor, though he acknowledged to IndyStar that going up against those who are self-funded or have already raised copious amounts of money would be challenging.\n\n\"The governor thing has always been in my wheelhouse because of my 30 years (in the Statehouse),\" Merritt said. \"So yes, I'm giving it a lot of consideration. I'm making phone calls now.\"\n\nMerritt unsuccessfully challenged Indianapolis Democratic Mayor Joe Hogsett in 2019, decisively losing by more than 44 percentage points.\n\nChristina Hale\n\nFormer Democratic Indianapolis state Rep. Christina Hale, who is the associate administrator for the Office of Communications and Public Liaison in the U.S. Small Business Administration, is another potential Democratic candidate for governor. She was competitive in Indiana's 5th Congressional District when she ran in 2020 before redistricting made it a safe Republican district. She lost by just over 4 percentage points, the closest a Democrat has come to winning in that district in recent years.\n\nShe also was John Gregg's running mate in the 2016 gubernatorial race. Hale didn't rule out the idea of a gubernatorial run.\n\n\"Democrats in Indiana are having important conversations about future elections and our party,\" she said in a statement to IndyStar. \"I've really enjoyed hearing from a number of people around the state asking about my plans and ideas as well as sharing some of their own, too.\"\n\nTodd Rokita\n\nRepublican Attorney General Todd Rokita has long been considered a contender for the 2024 gubernatorial bid, or the U.S. Senate should Braun decide not to seek reelection. He's remained involved politically by endorsing other candidates up and down the ballot, and remains outspoken on a range of hot-topic social and national issues.\n\nBut should he decide to run for governor, he'd likely face some candidates who either can self-fund, such as Braun, or who already have shown they can fundraise, such as Crouch. Republican insiders think it's likely that he just runs for reelection and waits for a better opportunity to run for a different office. He already experienced a Senate loss to a self-funder in 2018 in the Republican primary when Braun took the nomination.\n\nA person familiar with his thinking said he should make a decision on what position he's running for within the next few months.\n\nMitch Daniels\n\nThere are plenty of people who want former Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels to run after he announced in June that he will be stepping down from his post as president of Purdue University, but much of that is likely wishful thinking from those who are loyal to Daniels.\n\nTwo former Mitch Daniels aides created a Political Action Committee in August calling \"Frugal Hoosiers for Mitch 2024,\" encouraging him to run for governor in 2024. So far, he hasn't said whether or not he will run. He already served as governor from 2005-2013, where he made a host of notable government reforms as the first Republican in the office since the 1980s.\n\nDaniels told Fox59 in September that he hadn't given much thought to whether he'd run for governor again, after he leaves Purdue at the close of the year.\n\n“I believe in springing through the tape. We’ve got four months of work to do,\" he said. \"So there will be time to think about tomorrow when tomorrow comes.”"
