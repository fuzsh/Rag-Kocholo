        "text": "THE\n\nDANIELS\n\nDECADE\n\nWhen Mitch Daniels answered the call to become Purdue Universityâs 12th president in 2012, he embraced the institutionâs history with optimism for its untapped potential. âI will come to this assignment filled with appreciation for the Purdue we know and excitement for the still greater Purdue that can be,â he said. âHelping this great institution achieve even higher levels of research and intellectual excellence by recruiting the finest minds and students anywhere in the worldâand delivering to those students an exceptional, affordable educationâis the highest calling to which anyone who loves this state as I do could aspire.â\n\nHere, we take a look back at the levels of excellence Purdue has reached during Danielsâs presidency.\n\nSTUDENTS\n\nPurdue has increased access to higher education and set a new standard through teaching methods and campus experiences proven to prepare students for successful careers and fulfilling lives.\n\nAFFORDABLE, ACCESSIBLE EDUCATION\n\nUpon arriving at Purdue in January 2013 following two terms as Indianaâs governor, Daniels made affordability and accessibility an administrative priority. Under his leadership, the university froze tuition 11 consecutive years, saving students and their families over $1 billion.\n\nThe cost to attend Purdue today is less than it was a decade ago, and a majority of students now graduate debt free.\n\nNew university initiativesâincluding Purdue Global, Purdue Polytechnic High Schools, and Degree in 3âhave increased access to a Purdue education for students of diverse backgrounds. Private gifts for scholarships, fellowships, and programming have also made an impact.\n\nIn 2012â13, Purdue raised $32 million for student support. In 2021â22, it raised $150 million.\n\nENROLLMENT AND FACULTY GROWTH\n\nDiscussing student enrollment in 2015, Daniels said, âWe shouldnât seek to be known by how many we turn down but by how many we turn out.â Guided by this vision, Purdue has experienced record enrollments over the past eight academic years.\n\nAn all-time high 50,884 students began fall classes in 2022, including a record 37,949 undergraduates.\n\nTo accommodate these gains, Purdue has expanded its faculty annually, welcoming a record 213 new faculty in the fall of 2022. Faculty retention has also increased during Danielsâs presidency. The four-year retention rate for new professors hired in 2012 was 79.1%; for those joining Purdue in 2017, the four-year retention rate was 95.3%.\n\nCAMPUS\n\nEVOLUTION\n\nIn the last decade, Purdue has focused investments on teaching, research, and collaborative spaces; prioritized strategic renovations; enhanced open space connectivity and campus circulation; and strengthened the campus identity and gateways.\n\nNew Facilities and Enhancements\n\nAs enrollment continued to grow, the West Lafayette campus underwent several high-profile building projects with 11 new or expanded facilities during Danielsâs presidency.\n\nRecent construction includes the Gateway Complex: Dudley and Lambertus Halls; Chaney-Hale Hall of Science; the Agricultural and Biological Engineering Building; the David and Bonnie Brunner Purdue Veterinary Medical Hospital Complex; and Hagle Hall, a new home for Purdue Bands & Orchestras.\n\nItem 1 of 5\n\nDaniels championed the growth of the Discovery Park District at Purdue, a $1 billion mixed-use development embedded into the fabric of campus. The districtâs growth helped West Lafayette receive the No. 1 ranking in SmartAssetâs list of the best places for career opportunities.\n\nRead more about Discovery Park in this issueâs\n\nâLive. Work. Play.â story\n\nBeyond facilities, a $1 million renovation of Third Street created a safer pedestrian-friendly corridor between the campusâs student residences and north academic areas.\n\nStudents, faculty, and staff can now use Third Streetâs bicycle paths and walkways, which are adorned with colorful surface designs representing iconic campus symbols.\n\nA DECADE OF\n\nHIGH-IMPACT INITIATIVES\n\nKey initiatives introduced over the past 10 years raised the universityâs profile. Several reinforced Danielsâs focus on affordability and accessibility.\n\nPURDUE GLOBAL\n\nIn 2018, the university unveiled its online public university geared toward working adults: Purdue Global. Made possible through the acquisition of Kaplan University, the enterprise tailors education to the needs of adults who have work or life experience beyond the classroom.\n\nWith 175 programs of study, Purdue Global gives students flexibility to complete classes on their schedules. Of the 32,500 students currently enrolled, 58% are over the age of 30.\n\nA New Era for IUPUI\n\nPurdue and Indiana University took initial steps in 2022 to transform IUPUIâa joint venture in Indianapolis between the two entitiesâinto separate academic organizations with their own governance. This new arrangement will expand research activity and enhance funding opportunities for research partnerships, including the creation of a joint biosciences engineering institute.\n\nPurdue Polytechnic High Schools\n\nDaniels announced plans for a network of tuition-free Purdue Polytechnic High Schools (PPHS) in 2016. This joint venture between the university and Indianapolis Public Schools serves low-income students and students of color, preparing them for future success through STEM-focused project-based learning. The schools also provide a pipeline of qualified undergraduates to Purdue.\n\nThe initial PPHS location opened in 2017 and celebrated its first graduating class in 2021. Two Indianapolis locations and a third site in South Bend currently serve more than 1,000 students; a fourth location is in development.\n\nPurdue Moves and Next Moves\n\nThe university advanced the ambitious Purdue Moves agenda in 2013. Designed to place Purdue among the worldâs top research and teaching institutions, the strategic plan complemented Danielsâs commitment to âdeliver higher education at the highest proven value.â\n\nPurdue Moves included five pillars: Affordability and Accessibility; World-Changing Research; STEM Leadership; Transformative Education; and Online Education.\n\nLaunched in 2021, Purdueâs Next Moves initiatives are helping to strengthen the universityâs competitive advantage through five new pillars: Plant Sciences 2.0; National Security and Technology; Purdue Applied Research Institute (PARI); Transformative Education 2.0; and Equity Task Force.\n\nDegree in 3\n\nAs part of Purdue Moves: Transformative Education, Degree in 3 allows students to complete an undergraduate degree in three years. Those pursuing this option can then enter the workforce or graduate school a year earlier than they would through a traditional plan of study. Degree in 3 also provides a potential tuition savings of $19,000 or more.\n\nPurdue offers three-year degrees for more than 50 majors across its 11 colleges, including all majors within the College of Liberal Arts.\n\nâIf the Purdue of 10 or 20 years from now still enjoys its current vitality, momentum, and reputation, it will be because, in traditional Boilermaker fashion, it has continued the commitment to innovation and change.â\n\nMitch Daniels\n\nPurdue Moves and Next Moves\n\nThe university advanced the ambitious Purdue Moves agenda in 2013.

One organization now drives and coordinates all alumni-related activities.\n\nThe first Purdue Day of Giving, a 24-hour online event, took place in 2014 and raised $7.5 million from 6,500 donations. The most recent Purdue Day of Giving in 2022 set new records for total dollars raised ($68.2 million) and total number of gifts (26,726).\n\n150th Anniversary\n\nPurdue celebrated 150 years of giant leaps during a yearlong sesquicentennial celebration launched during Homecoming in 2018.\n\nThe anniversaryâs Ideas Festival connected world-renowned speakers and Purdue experts in conversations about critical problems and opportunities facing the world. More than 45,000 people attended over 60 related events with an additional 475,000 watching online. Guest speakers included Gene Kranz, Apollo 11 flight director; Condoleezza Rice, former U.S. secretary of state; and Beth Ford, president and CEO of Land OâLakes.\n\nFestivities concluded during Homecoming in 2019 with an astronaut reunion attended by 13 alumni who have traveled to outer space.\n\nProtect Purdue\n\nIn 2020, Purdue became one of the first universities to commit to reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic. The universityâs leadership felt it was important to have as many students safely on campus as possible to deliver the full Purdue educational experience. The Protect Purdue Plan outlined protocols to ensure the campus communityâs health and safety, including testing, vaccinations, and contact tracing.\n\nâWith over 88% of both students and the overall campus community vaccinated against COVID-19, we were one of the safest places anywhere,â Daniels said. By successfully navigating the challenges presented by the highly transmissible virus, Purdue returned to pre-pandemic operations in the fall of 2021.\n\nâWe have to give our young people the confidence to experience and cope with crisis because nothing in this world will ever be presented to them perfectly without fault or challenge.â\n\nMitch Daniels\n\nItem 1 of 4\n\nBusiness School\n\nIn 2022, Purdue announced its next big move: a transformation of the School of Management into a new School of Business that will prepare students to lead in a technology-driven world. Grounded in the hallmarks of a Purdue education, including STEM disciplines and business analytics, the School of Business will be uniquely positioned to bring discoveries to the marketplace, scale up innovations, and effect societal change.\n\nThe first phase of enhancements, set for the fall of 2023, include enrollment growth, targeted faculty expansion, and curricular and experiential additions.\n\nMitch Daniels Boulevard\n\nTo honor Danielsâs decade of leadership, the city of West Lafayette and Purdue University trustees agreed to rename a portion of State Street as Mitch Daniels Boulevard. The naming was announced publicly on December 2 as the university community began MitchFestâa series of celebratory and stimulating public events in recognition of Daniels.\n\nMitch Daniels Boulevard will run from Grant Street west through Purdueâs West Lafayette campus, culminating at U.S. 231. Signage will be installed in the spring 2023 semester.\n\nâTenâs a nice round number. I always say better a year too soon than a day too late.â\n\nâMitch Daniels\n\nDanielsâs tenure leading Purdue comes to a close on December 31, 2022. During the Presidentâs Council Annual Dinner in September, he expressed gratitude for the past decade as well as optimism for the universityâs next chapter under President-elect Mung Chiang.\n\nAddressing those in attendance, Daniels said, âThank you for 10 unforgettable years. And trust me on this, the next 10 will be better still. Boiler Up.â\n\nâEach time I am around Purdue alumni, I am struck by the same inspiring reaction. Their stories of great accomplishments, great careers, and great lives led almost never began with privileged origins. Overwhelmingly, Boilermakers have come from the small towns, the inner cities, the farmsâplaces where any head start they got more likely stemmed from the values they absorbed than from any great material advantage. It must always be so. My successors in this job must experience the same joy I derive from meeting such alums. Thatâs what tuition freezes, Purdue inner-city high schools, and rigorous, cutting-edge pedagogy are all about.â\n\nâMitch Daniels"
