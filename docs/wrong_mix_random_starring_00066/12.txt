Old is gold and who better than our B-town ladies to prove this! Our Bollywood queens love to travel back in time and that’s precisely what their fashion statements revolved around in a few movies.

While we very well remember and adore Deepika Padukone’s onscreen retro look in Om Shanti Om, there are a lot of other divas who have done the same in the past and a few others who are following suit even today.

The latest actress to sport the retro look onscreen is Vidya Balan. The Kahaani star is all set to make her Marathi debut with Ekk Albela. However, Vidya will only be seen in a cameo appearance and the lady recently revealed her look in the film.

Clad in a red and white sari, Vidya looks elegant and stylish in the poster. The actress looks ravishing in her retro avatar, with red bindi, red lips and a classy bun.

While Vidya Balan is the latest to join the bandwagon of women who rocked the retro look, we bring to you a glimpse of other B-town ladies who have been there and done that earlier!
