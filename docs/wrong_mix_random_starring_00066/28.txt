The buzz from all over the world, right here!

JAPAN’S LOVE AFFAIR WITH BOLLYWOOD

It all started with Rajinikanth’s Robot, but recently, more and more movies are increasingly being dubbed into Japanese, on public demand. Some of the most popular ones include Ek Tha Tiger, Om Shanti Om, Don 2, 3 Idiots, and Jab Tak Hai Jaan.

Turns out, the Japanese had a certain stereotype of Hindi cinema in mind, which is changing with the newer movies.

One of Japan’s oldest production studios, Nikkatsu Corporation, has tied up with India’s Yash Raj Films to release over 30 prints of these movies across nine major cities in Japan. We’ve also heard there was loud hooting and cheering during the screening of Ek Tha Tiger.

KATE MOSS FOR GIVENCHY EYEWEAR

You’d think models would come with an expiry date, but Kate Moss only climbs higher as she gets older. Her latest gig is with fashion house Givenchy for their eyewear line. Looks like we are going to see a lot of Ms Moss this Spring/Summer — she’s also starring in the Versace and Stuart Weitzman campaigns.

KIM KARDASHIAN’S VAMPIRE FACIAL

We knew Kimmy K had lost her marbles, but had no idea she was this far along. Turns out the secret to her gorgeous looking skin (apart from her glam squad and about 5 kilos of make-up), is due to her weekly ‘Vampire face-lift’. The entire process involves taking out one’s blood, and then injecting it into the face! The treatment costs $1,200, and her bloody facial was showcased on the latest episode of Kourtney & Kim Take Miami. If you’re still not grossed out by the idea, you can watch the episode to see exactly how the procedure takes place.

HUG YOUR BAG

If you’re still carrying your bag over your shoulder, or nestling it in the crook of your arm, you are clearly not with the program. Fashionistas this season are giving their bags some major loving by “hugging” them close to their bodies. Whether it is a sling, or a tote that you carry your world in, it must be hugged at all times. One of the first to be spotted doing this trend was Mrs Beckham, and Kate Moss followed suit by posing the same way in her Givenchy ad. What do you think of this trend — kookie or cool?
