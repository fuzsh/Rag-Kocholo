With this new industry status, Indian filmmakers would no longer need to seek money from the government or resort to black money laundering via the criminal underworld, but could instead have their productions backed by global sponsors and multinational corporations such as Coca-Cola and Nokia. Within this climate of economic restructuring, Bollywood also opened itself up to several aesthetic makeovers. In 1998 it adopted the frenetic editing Not for distribution or resale.

A year later, in 1999, the release of Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s film Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam marked the beginnings of a new, visually ‘excessive’ style of filmmaking. This novel aestheticism was achieved not only through Bhansali’s designer mise-en-scène and extravagant cinematography, but also through the careful casting of Miss World contest winner Aishwarya Rai – a rising star who would exhibit a kind of hyper-femininity and visual perfection previously unknown to the cinema.1 Rai was soon branded as ‘the new face of film’ by Time magazine,2 and her unique star quality was soon matched by that of male star Hrithik Roshan in 2000. Roshan’s hyper-masculine physique and almost superhumanly fluid dancing abilities in his first feature Kaho Naa . . . Pyaar Hai made him an astonishing overnight success, with the Indian press describing the Indian public’s feverishly fanatical response to his cinematic debut as ‘Hrithik mania’. In this same year, India also witnessed the revival of its biggest film star Amitabh Bachchan, who (previously representative as a working-class hero and socialist political figure, both in and outside of his films) now returned with a new, internationalised affluent image – an iconic white goatee beard and designer suit – as a pop star and television show host.3 Bachchan also used this time to relaunch his film career by starring as a cynical headmaster in Bollywood’s Dead Poets Society-inspired Mohabbatein, and was subsequently voted the biggest star of the millennium in a BBC poll. Since that time, Bachchan has worked on over seventy films and has often appeared in middle-class patriarchal or darker anti-heroic (sometimes even villainous) lead roles. The year 2000 also saw the release of M. F. Hussain’s Gaja Gamini, a film with avant-garde qualities which was one of the first commercially released art films with a major Bollywood cast (including superstars Madhuri Dixit and Shah Rukh Khan) to display an explicitly postmodern aesthetic style: an abstraction of realism through the fusion of historical events and mythology, a blending of canvas art, theatre and cinema aesthetics, temporal and spatial suspension (with the collapsing together of different historical eras), the intersection of multiple story worlds, and the subordination of narrative coherence and meaning in favour of image saturation. This film aimed to communicate a pseudo-feminist politics by questioning modes of representation of women throughout history and playfully drawing attention to Dixit’s female star persona – most famously by reconstructing her image in the form of Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa.4 A year later, 2001 saw Bollywood’s industry status finally take effect and saw its global circulation realised. Santosh Sivan’s Asoka was marketed across the UK and screened at London’s Empire Leicester Square. Karan Johar’s big-budget family melodrama Kabhi Kushi Kabhie Gham followed soon after, proving to be the industry’s highest international grosser, with many non-Indian European audiences flocking to see the film. This film, coupled Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\nintro du c tio n: the bollywood e c lipse 3 with Farhan Akhtar’s smart and stylish tale of urban youth Dil Chahta Hai, marked the beginning of a new generation of young directors in Bollywood who promised to challenge old-fashioned attitudes and promote a newer, more modernised India. Meanwhile in Hollywood, Baz Luhrmann also helped draw attention to Bollywood with his homage to the cinema in his Oscar-nominated Moulin Rouge. Further global awareness was received in 2002 with Hollywood’s first fully-fledged Bollywood-themed film The Guru, and a similar tribute in the West End in the form of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical Bombay Dreams. While the West showed its critical appreciation of Indian culture largely through East–West hybridised productions such as BAFTA, and Golden Globe nominated Bend It Like Beckham and Golden Lion winner Monsoon Wedding, Bollywood orchestrated its own international publicity by exhibiting Bhansali’s even more visually operatic follow-up film Devdas at the Cannes Film Festival. This hype was further exceeded in the same year by the Oscar nomination of the colonial-period sports film Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India and the promotion of Bollywood fashion by Vanity Fair and major department stores in London and New York. Meanwhile, in India, Sanjay Gupta inaugurated a new era of cross-cultural remakes in Bollywood with his Hindi adaptation of Quentin Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs. A year later, Bollywood produced another indirect Hollywood remake in the form of Koi . . . Mil Gaya – a formally unacknowledged reinterpretation of Steven Spielberg’s E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial. While the West continued to play with mixing Hollywood and Bollywood conventions in Bride and Prejudice, 2004 brought about further hybridity and creativity in Hindi filmmaking. Farah Khan’s Main Hoon Na wowed audiences with its Matrix-inspired special effects action choreography, while Hum Tum, one of the biggest hits of the year, experimented with inserting animation sequences into its live-action diegesis. In 2005, Bollywood released its first full-length feature animation Hanuman, again something novel that was received well by Indian audiences. One more landmark film came in the form of yet another Bhansali production, Black – a film which lacked the so-called ‘essential’ song and dance elements required for a film to be commercially successful in India. Black presented a remarkably unglamorous role to its lead actress Rani Mukherjee (one of the industry’s top stars), who took on a deaf, blind and mute character, earning her several awards and the film critical acclaim. Most importantly, the film’s commercial success in India signalled the changing and diversifying tastes of the Indian viewing public. At the same time, India demonstrated the power and influence Bollywood stars had over their audiences when the Times of India group launched ‘India Poised’ – a government-supported initiative which combined politics with entertainment media in order to reinvigorate the country’s future leadership. Following the model of Western panel shows such as Pop Idol, the Not for distribution or resale.

Most significantly, despite the serious politics behind this campaign, the judges’ panel on the programme comprised Bollywood industry professionals such as lyricist Javed Akhtar and movie star Akshay Kumar. The India Poised publicity campaign also included adverts starring Bollywood megastars such as Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan, which were displayed on TV channels6 and before film screenings in Cineplex theatres across the country. In 2006, Bollywood production companies realised the potential for mass profit through film franchises and launched their first blockbuster movie sequels, Krrish and Dhoom 2. This year also marked a first in the industry for self-adaptation,7 producing two big-budget remakes of landmark Hindi films from previous eras: Don and Umrao Jaan. Interestingly, these new sequels and remakes challenged assumptions regarding Bollywood’s supposed moral high ground, instead casting their lead stars in negative roles: Hrithik Roshan as a master-thief in Dhoom 2, Shah Rukh Khan as a ruthless Mafia boss in Don: The Chase Begins, and Amitabh Bachchan as a torturing psychopath in Aag (a 2008 remake of the legendary seventies ‘curry Western’ Sholay). Bollywood’s trend for recycling continued to increase in the following years. In 2007 – the same year that the word ‘Bollywood’ entered the Oxford English Dictionary, veteran Indian actor Anupam Kher appeared in Ang Lee’s Chinese espionage thriller Lust, Caution, and Indian film actress Shilpa Shetty won the public’s vote on Big Brother in the UK – the industry’s previous record for highestgrossing film was broken by Om Shanti Om, a postmodern remake of 1980s Indian film Karz. Other films in the top ten of highest grossers that year included formally unacknowledged versions of Hollywood’s Three Men and a Baby and Hitch. The next year, 2008, followed in similar vein with two more hit sequels (Golmaal Returns and Sarkar Raj) and Ghajini, which, despite being a Bollywood remake of a South Indian film adaptation of Christopher Nolan’s Memento, then became the most successful Indian film of all time. This was also the year American rap star Snoop Dog fashioned a turban and produced the theme song for the Bollywood hit film Singh Is Kinng. In 2009, Warner Bros Pictures released its first Hindi film – martial arts comedy Chandni Chowk to China – while Bollywood was drawn into the Hollywood awards limelight once more with Shah Rukh Khan presenting at the Golden Globes and, more indirectly, through Danny Boyle’s award-winning Slumdog Millionaire. Despite its grittier aesthetics, Boyle’s film paid homage to the Bollywood style with an end-credit dance sequence, and by employing for its soundtrack Bollywood composer A. R. Rahman (who subsequently won an Oscar for his collaboration). The film also launched the international career of Not for distribution or resale.

Thus, 2009 marked a significant increase in global casting, with Australian pop star Kylie Minogue appearing in a song sequence with Akshay Kumar in Bollywood underwater action film Blue and Sylvester Stallone evoking his action-star persona in Kambakkht Ishq, a romantic comedy set in LA (also featuring Hollywood actress Denise Richards). Aishwarya Rai added another film to her list of international productions by starring in Hollywood’s Pink Panther 2, while transnational productions came in the form of the attempted revival by Jennifer Lynch (daughter of surrealist director David Lynch) of the Indian snake film genre in Hisss and Indian company UTV Motion Pictures’ financing of the Hollywood film ExTerminators. The above shifts in Bollywood’s film production all take place after its economic liberalisation, and many of them point towards a new, consumercentred, cross-cultural, self-reflexive, visually spectacular and nostalgic style of filmmaking in India. Bollywood’s increased impulse to repeat and recycle, to excessively express and visualise, to commercialise and self-commodify, to appropriate other cultural works and to de-differentiate binaries or blur distinctions through such processes also suggests that the cinema has, in its restructuring, acquired strikingly postmodern qualities.\n\nN e w B o ll y w o o d Some scholars have already gone further in demonstrating recent changes within the Hindi film industry by hailing an entirely new form of cinema, which is sometimes described as ‘New Bollywood’.8 Sangita Gopal (2011) distinguishes this new cinema by pointing to the increased capitalisation, regulation and restructuring of the Hindi film industry and its altered distribution and exhibition processes, the commercialisation and branding of Bollywood and its immersion in a global economy, and the rise of the urban middle classes and ‘transnational’ audiences. In terms of film content, she observes ‘radically novel styles of filmmaking’ making a greater use of ‘highend technology’ (including steadicams), a merging of popular and parallel cinema, a digression from the song-sequence formula (in the form of multiplex or Hatke films9), genre diversity (particularly Hollywood-style horror and comedy), a ‘triumphant’ use of Hinglish, an obsession with remakes, and most significantly, the cinema’s shifting focus towards the subjectivity of the ‘conjugated couple’ (Gopal, 2011). As regards the difference between New Bollywood and earlier cinematic periods, Gopal distinguishes classical Hindi cinema’s ‘self-imposed homogeneity enforced by the all-embracing format of the social film and the masala’ (3). She acknowledges that many of the above Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n6 b o l l y w o o d and po s tm o de rnism filmmaking processes have been present in earlier forms of the cinema (particularly films from the 1970s), but asserts that this filmmaking style has since ‘solidified’ (14) from 1991 onwards, and ‘only begins to emerge as a distinctive product in the post-liberalization era’ (3). As she stresses, ‘New is necessary in order to emphasise that post-liberalization Mumbai film, while owing much to changes in the previous two decades, is nonetheless a radically new art form that must be analysed on its own terms’ (14). However, the innovative style Gopal refers to often corresponds to a type of cinema (Hatke) that is seen as somewhat alternative to the commercial blockbusters that this book will investigate as part of ‘New Bollywood’. Although it aims equally to demonstrate a significant shift in Bollywood cinema aesthetics in recent years, my study of popular Indian cinema does not intend to create an explicit binary of ‘New’ and ‘Old’ Bollywood. Rather, it exposes a postmodern dialogue between the Hindi cinema of the present and that of the past, which has ultimately allowed the cinema to reinvent itself. The ‘New’ in this case resides in the postmodern sense of the word; Bollywood’s ‘postmodern turn’ implies a shift that reworks or revisits previous aesthetic trends in order to produce an aesthetic that is altogether different. As with all postmodern works, we are not talking about a clear-cut break from the ‘classical’ in the traditional sense. Rather, we are discussing a transformation and change that takes place through a special kind of continuity – a reworking of the past.10 ‘New Bollywood’ here refers to contemporary films which exhibit a strong postmodern aesthetic style which was not as present in the 1990s (when popular Indian cinema officially became ‘Bollywood’). After 2000, this aesthetic style came to dominate the cinema and has been used as a means of internally commenting on and critiquing the industry in its current form.\n\nD e f i ni ng t h e ‘ c o n t e m p o r a r y ’ A certain widespread disregard for post-1990s popular Indian films has been evident, from popular film journalism (an October 2007 issue of Total Film magazine offers an introductory timeline of Bollywood cinema, stopping at 1996), reference compendiums and introductory film guides (such as the BFI 100 Bollywood Films [2005], which reveals a bias towards earlier periods of the cinema’s history), to established film societies and organisations such as the British Film Institute (in 2007 its web archive provided a canonical list of the ‘greatest Indian films of all time’, which included only one post-millennium release).11 In this book I will reveal how film institutions, scholars and educators concerned with Indian cinema have (until very recently) habitually refrained from moving their focus beyond issues surrounding national identity or diaspora politics, and therefore films released after the mid-1990s. Such Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\nintro du c tio n: the bollywood e c lipse 7 accounts would have us believe that popular Indian cinema is anything but ‘contemporary’. As I demonstrate in the following chapter, there seems to be a shared sense among many film scholars that newer Bollywood films display a certain ‘lack’ of critical appeal and are in some way of lesser value than their canonised predecessors. I challenge this assumption, and instead suggest that the problem lies in the fact that these newer films often do not fit existing models and established theories, and are thus often left unacknowledged in the hope that we may never assume their significance. Indian cinema has ultimately been a platform for exploring cultural tradition in India. The ‘contemporary’, it seems, then, poses a threat to our precious established definitions of popular ‘traditional’ Indian cinema. We must be wary of the limitations inherent in purely offering definitions of a cinema that no longer dominates, and of the dangers posed by this elision of contemporary filmmaking processes. Let us consider, for example, the inadequacy of conceptualising contemporary Hollywood cinema without acknowledging any of the developments that have taken place after 1996. Could one justifiably describe popular American cinema without considering the impact of CGI after The Matrix (1999), the Internet and its influence on film marketing strategies, recent shifts in the global economy, the emergence of DVD and digital filmmaking, or the aftermath of 9/11? Likewise, in television, could we claim to understand the medium today if we overlooked its shift from analogue to digital broadcasting formats? Like its Western counterpart, popular Indian cinema has changed dramatically in the last fifteen years. The pleasures on offer in 1990s Indian cinema no longer suffice – they no longer wholly embrace the needs of today’s Bollywood audience. A lead character’s charm alone is no longer enough to push a movie to the box-office top spot. The leading actor must now be more marketable as a superstar and be able to do his own stunts. He must be measured and approved, exhibiting an actual talent in acting and dancing. He must sponsor a decent haircut, display the muscles of a superhero, and be the face of an internationally renowned consumer brand. He must offer everything a Hollywood A-list actor does – and more. The much talked-about rebranding of Bollywood megastar Shah Rukh Khan demonstrates this shift perfectly. Khan is famously known for having initially gained popularity in the 1990s despite his scruffy hair, dark skin and ordinary stature. He originally won audiences over because of his mischievous smile and ‘cheeky yet charming’ character (see Chopra, 2007). However, the actor himself has recently discussed his need to reinvent his image (through hair extensions, chest waxing, intensive body building and skin-lightening12) in order to meet the demands of current younger Bollywood audiences – including his own son. In a television interview with director Farah Khan on the Indian celebrity talk show Koffee with Karan (hosted by Bollywood director and producer Karan Johar), the three discuss Shah Rukh Khan’s radical makeover for the then-upcoming film Not for distribution or resale.

Farah Khan declares the film to have launched an entirely new look for Khan, which she describes as an ‘item boy’ image.13 In Bollywood film, an ‘item number’ usually refers to the objectification of a seductive female performer (the ‘item girl’) in a singular, highly-sexualised song sequence which is inserted in a film independently of its narrative context, but this has been extended across gender in recent years, with actors Abhishek Bachchan, Hrithik Roshan and Shah Rukh Khan occupying similar roles in films (see Bachchan in Rakht [2004] and Roshan in Krazzy 4 [2008]). Such shifts on the level of star image and on-screen sexuality are prime examples of how films have changed in terms of their aesthetics in the post-millennial era – signalling a New Bollywood cinema with a more contemporary visual style. Like ‘New Bollywood’, ‘contemporary Bollywood’ here also refers to a cinema beyond the aforementioned period of first-generation NRI movies, specifically films released post-millennium. I shift between the terms ‘New’ and ‘contemporary’ – the former helping to emphasise the cinema as aesthetically distinct and innovative, and the latter accentuating the post-millennial Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\nintro du c tio n: the bollywood e c lipse 9 era. While hesitant to confine my research to a fixed historical period, I have found that the most significant factors solidifying change within the industry emerge from 2001 on. The year 2001 in particular beckoned a change with regard to the ‘polish’ of Bollywood cinema in terms of its actor-stars as well as its general production. The release of Farhan Akhtar’s Dil Chahta Hai that year is almost unanimously seen as a landmark moment in this sense, and thus is a key text which I explore in more depth (see Chapter 7).\n\nT h e P o s tm od e r n Despite ‘postmodernism’ being a highly debated and perplexing descriptive term, the phenomenon has already brought much to cinema and its academic study in the West. As a mode of film practice, it allows texts to inscribe and subvert prevailing conventions and question ideology, subjectivity and historical knowledge, allowing us to ‘reconsider the operations by which we both create and give meaning to our culture through representation’ (Hutcheon, 1989: 117). In doing so, it draws our attention to certain films’ consciously mimetic and anti-original qualities and to how contemporary films now seek to ‘rework’ rather than invent stories. Postmodern films facilitate an act of looking from both sides of the screen (Degli-Eposti, 1998: 5) and will (mis)represent identity in a way that exposes it as something to be understood as decentred and complex rather than whole and fixed. Postmodernism also increases the tension between, and closeness of, the political and the aesthetic, paradoxically creating texts that are at once culturally resistant and yet seem politically barren (Connor, 1989: 180). Postmodernism has helped us to understand and create shifts in knowledge and thinking, economic and social ordering, and aesthetic debates in the contemporary Western climate. It has offered us a means to investigate how capitalism and globalisation have impacted upon our society, pushing our artistic cultural practice towards profit-driven eclecticism and a saturation of media images and signs. The concept has also proved useful in helping to reveal how even the most commercial and trivial art forms can have the potential to interrogate: to be oppositional, contestatory, aesthetically diverse and ideologically ambivalent (Hill, 1998: 101–2). We are able to appreciate how popular cinema can use irony as a means of questioning truth, reality and artificiality, how it can manipulate images for commercial ends while problematising image-creation itself (Harvey, 1990: 323). Postmodernism has thus provided us with new reading strategies and different systems of interpreting films (Degli-Eposti, 1988: 16). With this in mind, this book attempts to apply the concept to Bollywood cinema in order to enrich our understanding of its contemporary filmmaking processes and shed light on a range of issues and questions concerning popular Indian film.

Within this, I consider the issue of non-Indian audiences’ lack of interest in – even rejection of – popular Hindi film texts, suggesting that Hindi cinema may have a more unusually unique film language and logic of pleasure compared to other, more accessible Asian cinemas. This study also argues that contemporary Indian popular cinema should not be dismissed as crass, mindless entertainment, or considered unworthy of intellectual engagement. Rather, it suggests that there is a credible, academically engaging cinema to be found beyond high art, political and diasporic Indian cinema, and that current popular Indian cinema can be found to be equally fascinating and revealing in a postmodern sense. In addition, far from declaring it a straightforward continuation of previous eras of filmmaking, I demonstrate how post-millennial Bollywood has mutated away from certain modes of representation, so much so that it can be described as representing a kind of renaissance period for the cinema. Among the cinema’s many formal aesthetic changes, the ‘noughties’ decade saw the emergence of a new genre of contemporary Hindi cinema in the form of the remake. In studying this recent phenomenon, I reveal how Bollywood uses postmodern methods of appropriation in order to reinvigorate itself and attempt to break free of its formulaic trappings. This postmodern reading will help us to rethink and expand our current definitions of Bollywood, as well as understand how postmodern techniques can enable a seemingly monolithic and nationalistic cinema to become more fragmented and experimental.\n\nP o s tm o d e r n i s m a n d i t s s c e p t i c s As with most scholarship on postmodernism, this study will naturally prompt certain reservations and scepticism from those who argue that the ‘postmodern’ is a much too contested, incoherent and problematic concept to work with, let alone apply to non-Western cinema. It is therefore important to assert here that the purpose of this book is not to affirm postmodernism as an unproblematic, self-evident and self-fulfilling category, but instead to raise further questions about its historical and geographical emergence, whilst examining its usefulness as a hermeneutic tool for studying non-Western popular art forms. Indeed, the entire ‘postmodern conundrum’ is far from solved here, but as with other seminal works on this subject, the very goal here is to stimulate a new discussion about the value of postmodern theory in film studies and to foster new methods of analysing contemporary Indian cinema. This book introduces the concept of a postmodern Bollywood cinema, and this concept deserves (like other new theories and methodologies) to be tested, refined and Not for distribution or resale.

Nevertheless, rather than taking the term for granted and overlooking its polysemy, or discussing it too abstractly, I make definitions of key postmodern concepts clear by firstly breaking them down into a series of identifiable aesthetic conventions and then exploring them further through detailed case studies offering close textual analysis of a select range of contemporary Bollywood texts. Undeniably, postmodernism has traditionally been viewed as a specifically Western phenomenon. Key postmodern theorists have spoken of it as ‘the West’s “modern neurosis” ’ (Lyotard, 1992: 79–80), as a ‘global, yet American postmodern culture . . . a whole new wave of American military and economic domination throughout the world (Jameson, 1991: 57), and have explicitly argued that ‘postmodernism cannot simply be used as a synonym for the contemporary . . . [and] does not really describe an international cultural phenomenon, for it is primarily European and American’ (Hutcheon, 1988: 4). However, some scholars have since reviewed and withdrawn this opinion (in her 2002 revised edition of The Politics of the Postmodern, Hutcheon changes her perspective on postmodernism’s global reach and addresses the concept’s subsequent internationalisation14) whilst others have explored the idea of alternative modernities that may be more culturally specific (see Chapter 4). What is more, Ajay Gehlawat (2010) has reminded us that despite the dangers posed by the application of a Eurocentric hermeneutics, ‘indigenous frames of reference can also be a trap’ (xvii). Admittedly, it is still somewhat a challenging task to find explicit examples of (let alone discourses on) postmodern cultural art in India – even after considering the well-publicised novels of British Indian literary author Salman Rushdie (see Das, 2007), the work of artists such as Annu Palakunnathu Matthew (whose portfolio entitled ‘Bollywood Satirized’ in a 2001 exhibition mocked commercial films for reinforcing Indian traditional socio-cultural prejudices by manipulating and subverting images from existing film posters15), or the post-1990s Adhunantika movement in Bengali literature, with its poetry and short stories sharing many characteristics with the postmodern including plurality, de-territorialisation, eclecticism, multi-linearity, pastiche, irony and de-centredness.16 The renowned Indian art critic and curator Geeta Kapur has perhaps been most influential in demonstrating that both modern and postmodern art exist in contemporary India. In her book When Was Modernism (2000), Kapur traces both modernism and the postmodern in contemporary Indian art, periodising it from the 1930s onwards. Among India’s postmodern pioneers, she notes artists such as K. G. Subramanyan, Bhupen Khakhar and Gulam Mohammed Sheikh, whose work exhibits a self-conscious eclecticism, parodic force (particularly towards high modernism), intertextuality, pop art aesthetics, excess of signs, and a ‘pictorial vocabulary’ (313–14), often engaging Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n12 b o l l y w o o d and po s tm o d e rni sm in ‘instrumental pastiche’ and a play with simulacra, and ultimately exploiting cultural codes (319). From the 1980s onwards, such artists are seen to ‘disrupt’ and ‘provide a relief’ from Indian modernism (319), although Kapur explicitly cites cinema as the place from which postmodernism can most effectively emerge (320).17 Thus Kapur asserts that ‘before the west periodizes the postmodern entirely in its own terms and in that process also characterises it, we have to introduce from the vantage-point of the periphery the transgressions of uncategorized practice’ (297). A small handful of scholars, in particular Vijay Mishra (2008), Gehlawat (2010) and Rajinder Dudrah (2012), have recently begun to register and tackle the concept of a ‘Postmodern Bollywood’ cinema. Gehlawat, who has advocated a study of Bollywood through applying what Arjun Appadurai has termed a ‘postmodern praxis’ (Appadurai [1996], cited in Gehlawat: 118), acknowledges that a postmodern reading assumes intent on the part of the filmmaker, and arguably requires a certain level of sophistication, literacy and self-consciousness on the part of the viewer, which could be seen as problematic when considering the lesser-privileged and under-educated members of the Indian film audience. However, Gehlawat challenges prevailing scholarly emphasis on passive spectatorship by emphasising the difference between intentionality and consciousness, highlighting Indian cinema’s fundamentally ‘transgressive disruptive semiotics’ (57) which provide a distancing effect, and arguing that Bollywood in fact serves as a ‘teaching machine’ for subaltern audiences (79). My own study of New Bollywood, which reveals a dramatic increase in remaking (as homage) and referencing of other canonical film texts, suggests that the cinema explicitly offers a unique kind of pleasure through cinephilia and that audiences are already able to pick up on these playful references. The rise of multiplex cinemas (targeting urban middle classes) and a greater investment in diasporic and broader global audiences also further complicate the argument that the Bollywood audience is too illiterate and passive to pick up on complex postmodern references. Another issue that could be raised against this application of the postmodern concerns how we account for the appearance of seemingly postmodern processes, such as self-consciousness, in earlier periods of Hindi cinema. This matter is addressed in several ways: (1) by distinguishing the idiosyncrasies of New Bollywood’s pastiche/parody/self-reflexivity from other forms of textual referencing; (2) by my identifying a ‘postmodern politics’ (Hutcheon, 1988, 1989) within recent films; and (3) by exploring the difference between cultural mimicry, which is intrinsic to Indian cinematic tradition, and postmodern blank pastiche or parody in recent Bollywood cinema. However, the very fact that I draw connections between postmodern devices and traditional Indian artistic traditions (for example, Chapter 7 looks at hyperrealism and figural aesthetics in ancient Indian miniature paintings) demonstrates my intention to Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\nintro du c tio n: the bollywood e c lipse 13 question also whether postmodernism is purely a contemporary phenomenon, or whether other versions of it have existed in the past. Further distinctions are made with regard to New Bollywood’s innovative remaking processes. After considering how repetition has historically functioned as a fundamental process in Indian artistic culture (through a brief historical account of remaking in classical Hindi cinema), I go on to explain how remaking in New Bollywood operates differently. Here, remaking is used to convey postmodern concerns such as the prevalence of stylistic excess over discourse (figural aestheticism), self-referential critique, identity fragmentation, and a questioning or crisis of representation.\n\nT h e P o s tm od e r n T e r r a i n In his attempt to critique various theorisations of the postmodern, Norman K. Denzin (1991) has distinguished how key theorists such as Fredric Jameson (1991), Jean-François Lyotard (1992) and Jean Baudrillard (1983) share a common nostalgic desire for an aesthetics of the past (Denzin: 48). Postmodernism’s relationship to the past is multifaceted, but can generally be divided into two perspectives, the first consisting of the postmodern text having an inferior relationship to that of the past/history, with negative, unproductive and often destructive consequences, and the second a perspective that diversely suggests how new postmodern art has the potential for a critical revaluation of the past, resulting in a ‘freeing up’ of the text and its meaning. Jameson, Baudrillard and Terry Eagleton (1986) can be seen to fall into the first category. Jameson in particular, in his essay ‘Postmodernism or the logic of late capitalism’, warns of the destructive postmodern text, which achieves nothing but a plagiarised copy of an original work of art, stripped of authenticity and aura, which he describes as resulting in a ‘waning of affect’ (1984: 69). Jameson situates himself as a Marxist, using the concept of postmodernism to tie in with and account for the damage caused by the capitalisation of art. The postmodern text, with its ‘depthlessness’ (60), its ‘blank parodying’ (65) of authentic works, and its commercially driven existence, becomes an ideal target as a flagship for capitalism. Eagleton likewise echoes Jameson’s argument, complaining of postmodernism as a ‘sick joke’ (1986: 131), an empty pastiche which ‘mimes the formal resolution of art and life . . . while remorselessly emptying it of its political content’ (132). This pessimism is further added to by Baudrillard, who introduces the notion of the postmodern simulacra – a textual reproduction of an authentic work which aims to subvert and pervert notions of reality, truth and hence history. For Baudrillard, the modern image as simulation ‘does no more than resemble itself and escape in its own logic’ (195) and thus becomes a ‘death sentence’ Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n14 b o l l y w o o d and po s tm o d e rni sm for all possible reference and meaning (196). Baudrillard’s preoccupations lie predominantly with the abduction, mutilation and ‘terrorism’ of the real (196) by the postmodern text. Reality, once it has been swallowed up by the postmodern simulacra, has become unreachable and replaced by empty recycled images of hypersimulation and hyperrealism (197). For all three theorists, the mass production and recycling of previous works of art has led to current aesthetics being intellectually frowned upon and enjoyed at a purely sensationalist level – resulting in an increased ‘painful nostalgia’ (Friedberg, 1994: 188) or hopeless mourning for the past. In the case of cinema, mainstream American filmmakers have for a long time, if not always, been guilty of mass profit-based production and the parodying or remaking of previous films. Therefore, in the light of the consequences of these postmodern traits indicated by Jameson and Baudrillard, it would appear that mainstream cinema is doomed: A whole generation of films is appearing which . . . lack only an imaginary and that particular hallucination which makes cinema what it is [. . .] cinema increasingly approaches . . . in its banality, in its veracity, in its starkness, in its tedium . . . in its pretension to be the real, the immediate, the unsignified, which is the maddest of enterprises. (Baudrillard: 195) The constant memory and loss of authenticity of the past are perhaps unavoidable. However, not all postmodern critics have declared this cultural phase a catastrophe. While similarly attempting to uncover the relationship between the postmodern and the past, Jean-François Lyotard has also credited the postmodern movement with helping to liberate texts by questioning the importance and prioritisation of textual meaning (an effort he no longer sees as essential in the pursuit of aesthetic appreciation). Lyotard commends the postmodern for its abstraction of truth and realism, which has resulted in a breaking down of grand narratives such as history, religion, science, and existing art institutions which presume to dictate what is and is not to be classified as a work of art. Postmodernism embraces the popular text, with all its banalities, trivialities and commercialism, merging it with and presenting it alongside established works of ‘high art’. This celebratory destabilisation of such totalising social institutions is also, according to Lyotard, accompanied by another liberating postmodern trait – the loss of meaning. To reject the need for a work to mean something is to again defy and break down the rules by which established art institutions operate: ‘Such rules and categories are what the work or text is investigating. The artist and writer therefore work without rules . . . in order to establish the rules of what will have been made’ (Lyotard: 15). The notion of freedom of interpretation and the breaking of boundaries Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\nintro du c tio n: the bollywood e c lipse 15 is further explored by Scott Lash (1988). Lash stresses how postmodern texts fundamentally break down the rules and boundaries of difference (for example, between good and bad art, or high and low culture), resulting in an elimination of difference altogether. This process of ‘de-differentiation’ (312) can also be seen to free the text and its reader. The indulgence in pure sensation and spectacle renders both textual meaning and interpretation unnecessary. The instability of the boundaries and conventions constructing art and realism are exposed (329), allowing several conflicting styles to coexist within a single text. However, although these theorisations work well in developing an appreciation of the postmodern text, they still do not account for how we are to resolve the problem of that which has been lost from past forms of classical and modernist art. Perhaps the most useful attempt at resolving the conflict between the nostalgic past and present postmodernist age is that of Linda Hutcheon. Rather than perceiving the two as separate, Hutcheon argues that this ‘mere’ nostalgic return and constant referencing of the past is not simply postmodernism scraping together the remains of what went before, but rather a ‘critical reworking’ of the past (1988: 4). This method of critiquing previous works is unique to postmodernism as a result of its ability to simultaneously conform to and resist the past and its conventions: . . . the increasing uniformization of mass culture is one of the totalising forces that postmodernism exists to challenge. Challenge, but not deny . . . Postmodernism . . . refuses to posit any . . . master narrative . . . It argues that such systems are indeed attractive, perhaps even necessary; but this does not make them any less illusory. (Hutcheon, 1988: 13) Hutcheon’s theorisation is valuable not only as an attack on those who outwardly reject postmodernism, but also because it exposes an intellectual link between or progression from the past (history, modernism) to the current state of art. As my own study reveals, New Bollywood texts could be seen to be guilty of both – a seemingly full-scale immersion in Jamesonian postmodern blank pastiche, which in fact at times reveals itself as a playful postmodern critiquing of the past.\n\nA S tr u c t u re o f t h e b o o k My investigation begins with a review of Indian film criticism (Chapter 2), Bollywood’s circulation at film festivals, and pedagogical practices (Chapter 3). I ascertain how previous published work on Indian cinema and certain teaching trends have shaped our current understanding of (and critical Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n16 b o l l y w o o d and po s tm o d e rni sm a­ ttitudes towards) popular Indian films. Inspired by the postmodern notion of history as narrative (which chooses to perceive historical discourse as subjective storytelling rather than something conveying [actual] universal truth or fact), I demonstrate how India’s cinematic history has been articulated through particular intellectual discourses cultivated within the discipline of Indian film studies. As I reveal, these discourses tend to focus upon a particular set of themes in order to fulfil specific social and political agendas, thus often neglecting to analyse certain aspects of the text’s formal aesthetics. Chapter 2 observes the censuring and disregard for Bollywood in traditional approaches to Indian cinema by reviewing a variety of literary sources. These include historical biographies, textbooks and introductory guidebooks by renowned Indian cinema scholars, and press interviews with industry professionals. Chapter 3 goes on to look at film festival brochures, and pedagogical accounts by those who have taught the subject to a Western audience, as well as incorporating more empirically-based data taken from university syllabuses on Bollywood, formal conversations with film scholars at academic conferences, and my own personal observations of non-Indian undergraduate students’ experiences of intellectually engaging with Indian film texts. Using this information, I argue that many of the academic approaches towards, and much critical journalistic writing on, Bollywood have worked against Bollywood’s interests in securing international appeal. Although valuable and informative, this literature has often failed to adequately address significant aesthetic shifts within the industry over the last decade, instead producing outmoded or woolly definitions of contemporary Bollywood which have hindered its global inauguration in terms both of commercial success and academic interest. In order to motion a change in Indian film scholarship, Chapter 3 also draws attention to more recent published work on contemporary Bollywood, which has begun to address the significance of and offer innovative approaches to analysing this distinctive era of cinema. Since Chapters 2 and 3 demonstrate a widespread devaluation and marginalisation of Bollywood, my subsequent postmodern reading aptly serves as a means of responding to and countering such attitudes by redefining the cinema in its contemporary form. Chapters 4 and 5 demonstrate how the Indian film industry has taken a postmodern turn after the millennium as a response to Bollywood’s increased global exchanges and commercialisation. After a review in Chapter 4 of existing academic attempts to place the concept in a global or international context, Chapter 5 observes how the postmodern, as an aesthetic style and fluid cultural practice, manifests in contemporary Bollywood film texts. To aid my investigation, I draw upon the various concepts and traits identified by postmodern theorists such as Fredric Jameson, Jean Baudrillard, Jean-François Lyotard and Hayden White, as well as postmodern film theorists such as Linda Hutcheon, Peter and Will Brooker, and Not for distribution or resale.

As the field of postmodern Bollywood cinema studies is relatively uncharted, I feel it is important to employ a variety of tools and strategies throughout my research in order to demonstrate the cinema’s versatility (hopefully assisting its flexible application in future film studies courses) and to aim for experimentation and exploration rather than an absolute concretisation of the concept. Thus, my methodology here shifts between formalist film theory, semiotics, (post)structuralism, broad cultural politics, and some Marxist poetics. In Chapter 5, my analysis of postmodern Bollywood cinema crucially includes a close reading of three key films which I consider to be prime examples of this new form of filmmaking. The first of these, Om Shanti Om, directed by Farah Khan (perhaps Bollywood’s female equivalent of pasticheauteur Quentin Tarantino), provides a complex self-critique by employing a variety of postmodern devices including pastiche and nostalgic recycling, which inhabit everything from its narrative and plot to its visual aesthetics and formal structure. Through these strategies, the film is able simultaneously to celebrate, exploit and dismantle its own cinematic conventions and modes of representation. A second example of postmodern Bollywood is offered through Koi . . . Mil Gaya – the film that initiated and signalled the Bombay film industry’s yielding to the previously unfamiliar territory of science-fiction. This film usefully demonstrates how Bollywood uses postmodern methods to play and experiment with a long-established theme of post-independence Hindi cinema: the tension between modernity (progress, the future) and tradition (regression, the past). Whereas previously Bombay film narratives would conclude with the rejection of the former and a return to the latter, as I reveal, Koi . . . Mil Gaya in fact facilitates the blurring of these two binaries in order to ultimately render them both as suspect. The film also reveals how a comparative study of a Bollywood remake of a Hollywood original (in this case, E.T: The Extra Terrestrial) can help us to better understand both the interconnectedness and the distinctive differences in film language between these two dominant cinemas. My final case study uses Abhay as an example of avant-garde techniques emerging within mainstream Indian cinema. Through its constant interchange between conventional cinematic realism and absurd comic book representation, the film demonstrates how some popular Indian films deconstruct (Western) notions of realism by innovatively dissolving the divide between non-fiction and fantasy. In doing so, the film contests the negative elitist criticism Bollywood has received, instead revealing a cinema that cannot be underestimated and easily categorised, instead sitting comfortably between the posts of mainstream popular entertainment and radical art. Chapters 6 and 7 continue to provide further examples of postmodern aesthetics in contemporary Bollywood cinema, this time looking more specifically at a particular kind of filmmaking that has emerged prolifically over Not for distribution or resale.

On the basis of research that considered 144 Indian film remakes (almost one hundred of which were produced after 2000), I discuss how remaking has become a platform for innovation and creative translation in Bollywood, offering a unique form of cinephilic pleasure for its audiences. Drawing upon various theoretical work on textual adaptation – including issues of textual fidelity that continue to plague the Bollywood remake’s critical reception – I look at how the diverse methods of remaking that Bollywood employs (intertextuality, cross-cultural borrowing, aesthetic as well as narrative appropriation, pastiche and parody) allow it to experiment with and innovate in its filmmaking practices. For example, in Chapter 6, I explore how certain film stars are used as intertexts through ‘celebrity’ or ‘genetic’ intertextuality, while Chapter 7 looks at how Bollywood uses figural excess to rework and distinguish itself aesthetically from previous canonical Indian film texts. I also explore how Bollywood cinema hybridises with Hollywood modes of filmmaking in order to de-authenticate and dismantle both American and its own cinematic codes and conventions. After looking initially at how repetition has always been a fundamental characteristic of Indian artistic culture, I go on to explain how remaking became a central or signature feature of Bollywood cinema in the first decade of the twenty-first century, embodying postmodern concerns such as the prevalence of stylistic excess over discourse, self-referential critique, identity fragmentation, and a questioning or crisis of representation. The film texts I explore include remakes or ‘re-imaginings’ of films as diverse as Hollywood’s critically acclaimed The Godfather and the testosterone-driven Fight Club, the Indian socio-realist drama Devdas, the independent American cult movie Reservoir Dogs, the special effects sci-fi film The Matrix, New Hollywood’s taboo-breaking classic Bonnie and Clyde, and South Korea’s international award-winning Oldboy. My analysis of postmodern remaking in Bollywood further explains how the cinema has changed and evolved since the 1990s, and I argue that such films can help enrich our understanding of Bollywood’s current film language and aesthetics, revealing an Indian cinema that is at both its most innovative and its most self-destructive. Finally, in Chapter 8, I provide a redefinition of contemporary Bollywood cinema, propose the value of postmodernism as a new alternative method for studying, teaching and articulating Bollywood in the West (particularly offering us a means by which to better engage with the visual aesthetics of popular Indian films), and, lastly, push towards a more global view of the postmodern, which can help us to expand and update our understanding of the concept as well as emphasise its potential for international application and cultural impact.

I believe that newer Bollywood texts contain culturally, aesthetically and politically subversive qualities which endeavour to overpower previous aesthetic modes and conventions, revealing a postmodern shift that has enabled a darkening of these films’ internal agendas. This study of post-millennial Bollywood cinema concentrates on films produced between 2000 and 2009, although more recent film releases and developments are also considered, particularly in the final chapter. It is also important to note that this study will not explore any of the numerous other regional cinemas within India. While choosing to focus on a particular Indian film industry, I have considered that there may be other varieties of Indian cinema containing similar tropes to those discussed in this book. Therefore I do not at this stage wish to sign off my approach as being exclusively applicable or restricted to the remit of Bombay cinema, nor to assert that this is automatically reflective of every kind of contemporary popular Indian film. But I do envisage that my approach may be useful and adaptable when analysing other kinds of commercial Indian cinema, such as Tamil Nadu-based films.18 The aim of this book is ultimately to explain what postmodernism means in the context of Bollywood cinema, to demonstrate how to apply the concept when analysing Bollywood films, and, lastly, to understand what postmodernism tells us about the change and function of Bollywood film language after the twenty-first century. This postmodern approach to Bollywood film helps us consider what an (originally) Western theoretical framework can actively do to raise our appreciation and alter our understanding of contemporary popular Indian cinema, and what the Indian cinema in turn can do for our ­understanding of postmodernism as a global concept.19\n\nN ot e s 1.

At this stage, the need for Indian film scholars to go back to the beginning of its historical emergence seems logical and essential, so that we may chronologically go about constructing Indian cinema’s history and explain how it has evolved into its contemporary form. Mihir Bose’s book Bollywood: A History (2007), for example, offers a detailed study of the development of cinema in India over 110 years, from its first introduction in Bombay in 1896 (courtesy of France’s Lumiere brothers), all the way to rising film star producer Amir Khan’s critically acclaimed commercial blockbuster Rang De Basanti (2006). Interestingly, despite such an extensive and complex history of filmmaking (and a comparatively short period of academic research), it seems that we have already reached a stage at which many writers, commentators and educators feel they can offer a condensed version of this history, emphasising the Hindi film industry’s most significant aesthetic and thematic shifts, which can be represented as shown in Figure 2.1 overleaf. Such a history of the development of the Bombay film industry, though useful for its categorisation and emphasis on the dominant trends throughout the decades, clearly contains certain gaps. By focusing our attention on the socalled ‘milestones’ in the history of Indian cinema in such a way, we also come to see how entire decades (presumably considered less innovative and critically significant) appear to be pushed aside.1 But while they may leave holes in Indian cinema’s history, these gaps do tell us a very interesting story about Not for distribution or resale.

The decades that tend to be skimmed over in Indian cinema timelines are the ones that have produced less politically oriented and more populist films. For example, with only a few minor passing references to the rise of star comedian Mehmood, legendary screen hero Dev Anand or romance movies such as Guide, Jewel Thief, An Evening in Paris and Waqt, the 1960s decade of Bombay cinema has generally been seen as non-distinctive in itself, instead overlapping with the 1950s golden era of social satires. Similarly, the 1980s decade is often either seen as marked by the fizzling out of the 1970s Angry Man era, or simply skipped over entirely, an omission justified through the supposed dip in film production due to the rising popularity of Hindu religious television serials in India at the time. Eighties Bombay cinema also has the misfortune of being littered with low-brow ‘masala’ entertainment films,2 which again are given less critical attention. As a child growing up in the 1980s, I remember this as a time when Indian film watching distinctively moved into the home owing to the rise of Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\nt r a d i t i o nal m o de s o f s tud yi n g in dian c in ema 23 home VCRs and VHS piracy, and a time when Amitabh Bachchan (flagship star of the 1970s Angry Man films) still had many people crowding in the film rental section of both India’s and the UK’s Indian-owned grocery stores. I remember the excitement surrounding Bachchan’s new look (a notable departure from the 1970s Angry Man) as gloomy anti-hero Shahenshah (1988) or his double role and horse-riding super-heroics in Toofan (1989).3 The same decade saw the emergence of new actors such as college-boy romancer Amir Khan and the on-screen sex symbol and seductress Rekha – both of whom are regarded as icons of the cinema today. I would argue that the 1960s and 1980s are decades from which we can best study Indian cinema’s most popular form of filmmaking – the masala movie – as the genre has prevailed at these points more than over any other ten-year period. Both the 1960s and the 1980s should be considered important phases in Indian cinema’s development. They are equally valuable for a study of evolving aesthetics and styles in popular Indian film, even if their films may not always explicitly reveal the national sentiments or socio-political psyche of their audiences at that time. More recently, we can see a similar gap emerging in relation to our understanding of popular Indian cinema in the 2000s. There is a tendency either to view noughties films as a continuance of 1990s NRI4 films, or simply to focus on a select few texts which posit a political stance or offer up social commentary. Indian films from the 1960s, 1980s and 2000s thus share a lack of direct socio-political engagement and mark an increase in so-called ‘run-of-the-mill’ populist entertainment. From looking at such a historical narrative of the Bollywood cinema industry, we can begin see how socio-politics and cultural tradition ultimately determine the significance of and scholarly focus on certain periods over others. The above gaps in Indian cinema’s narrative history are apparent in some well-known ‘guidebook’ essays produced by leading scholars in the field of Indian film criticism. For example, in The Oxford Guide to Film Studies (1998) Ashish Rajadhyaksha offers a condensed history, both of Indian cinema – ending with the late 1980s and largely following the structure I described above – and Indian film scholarship (1960s to mid-1990s). He suggests here that Indian films are largely discussed in relation to the following themes and contexts: film policy, government-controlled film production, censorship, New Wave Indian cinema, 1970s ‘national emergency’ (Angry Man films), Indian modernism, postcolonial theory (nationalism and identity), politics, economics, the India–Pakistan partition (terrorism), and subaltern studies (citizenship, nationalist historiographies). Choosing not to include or address the analysis of textual film form in his account, Rajadhyaksha presents the above research trends as the ‘nationalist critical tradition’ of Indian film criticism. He explains how orthodox periodisations of Indian cinema serve as ‘cinematic equivalents of the ‘biography of the nation state’ (Rajadhyaksha, Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n24 b o l l y w o o d and po s tm o d e rni sm 1998: 536), and that India’s film history is ‘largely written from the stand point of state policy on Indian cinema after 1947’, with a critical-theoretical focus on ‘realist cinema’, ‘respectability’ and ‘political usefulness’ (535). Later, in another essay, he affirms that ‘film theory has repeatedly demonstrated the crucial role that nationalist-political constructions play in determining narrative and spectatorial practices’ (2003: 33). Many film academics will try to declare that Bollywood films are too culturally specific (requiring a lot of prior cultural knowledge) and suggest these films are perhaps more suitable for sociology-, anthropology-, politicaleconomy- or postcolonialism-based courses. Therefore it is hardly surprising that the majority of prominent Indian cinema scholars tend to have come from a social science rather than a film studies background. These commentators on Indian cinema present themselves (often assertively) as culturologists, historians or cultural philosophers, rather than as film theorists or film analysts. Heidi Pauwels, who has more recently tried to break from the above patterns and traditions of Indian film research and criticism, notes how in such accounts the film text itself is rarely looked on as a work of art. Pauwels comments: Ironically, although many of these studies argue for and see themselves as part of a rehabilitation of popular movies as a serious object of study, little sustained attention has been paid to detailed analysis of the films themselves. Sometimes scholars seem mainly interested in the way films may be invoked to address larger debates over theory within specific academic disciplines . . . (Pauwels, 2007: 2) Social scientists have stated their objective of ‘rescuing’ Indian cinema scholarship from being limited by over-exhaustive formal analysis and textual parameters. As Rajadhyaksha and Kim Soyoung remark in their essay ‘Imagining the cinema anew’: ‘restricting the investigation to inside the movie theatre and the textual practices we find there is hardly sufficient’, and they favour instead looking at the history, spectatorship and distribution of films (Rajadhyaksha and Soyoung, 2003: 7). Furthermore, in her guidebook on Bollywood, Tejaswini Ganti is quick to assert that her work is ‘written from the point of view of an anthropologist rather than a film critic’ and therefore ‘does not undertake qualitative judgements’ or much textual analysis of the texts themselves (Ganti, 2004: 4). However, when one actually looks for this supposed excess of formalist study, it is nowhere to be found. On the contrary, there appears to be a fundamental dearth of critical attention paid to Bollywood film form, particularly covering the cinema of the 2000s. One of the few published monographs wholly focusing on popular Hindi film form and style is Rachel Dwyer and Diva Patel’s Cinema India: The Visual Culture Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\nt r a d i t i o nal m o de s o f s tud yi n g in dian c in ema 25 of Hindi Film (2002). But this book’s chapters on mise-en-scène and visual style are sketchy at best, offering generalised introductory accounts and lacking any in-depth textual analysis. Dwyer and Patel fail to offer any detail or elaborations on Bollywood visual film language (for example, aspects such as tone, pace, cinematography, ornamental framing, image composition, camera work), and they do not account for any of the more recent contemporary aesthetic shifts in Bollywood film style. This social-science- and history-based scholarship on Indian cinema has indeed helped to draw our attention to and raised our appreciation of a highly populist form of mainstream Indian cinema. But in exploring the cinema within the prism of political, historical and sociological frameworks, the film text itself (in terms of its formal aesthetic and stylistic values) can become peripheral or of secondary importance – simply an accessory to help serve socio-political thoughts and functions. Indian cinema’s history is therefore rather exclusively seen as driven or shaped not so much by its aesthetics or technological changes as by, primarily, cultural, political and social factors. This vernacular, although by no means unimportant, can become a great obstacle when we try also to consider and engage with the cinema as an art form in its own right.\n\nT rad i t i o na l a p p r o a c h e s t o I n dia n fil m: na t i o na l i s m , d i a sp o r a , p o s tc ol on ia l ism a n d cul t u ra l i d e n t i t y As was revealed earlier in Rajadhyaksha’s account of Indian film criticism, nationalism prevails as the most common and popular theme in Indian film studies. The idea of popular Bombay cinema as India’s ‘national cinema’ is often justified through its history of governmental control and financing, its entanglement in state policies, its trans-regional appeal and thematic versatility, its ethnic neutrality,5 and its unique application of mixed Indo languages.6 But despite Bollywood’s mass popularity, a large majority of the total film output in India still comes from the South, and claiming Bollywood as the nation’s official film producer leads to many other productive regional cinemas being ignored. There are also problems with the fact that industry and state do not necessarily work to support each other’s interests (for an interesting discussion of the lack of co-operation between the industry and state, see Ganti, 2008). In recent years, the rise of globalisation and the film industry’s economic liberalisation have also put this label under some strain. Notions of ‘national cinema’ are now being broken down and replaced by newer labels such as ‘transnational’, ‘Asian’ and ‘global’ cinema. In fact, determining the national cinema of India has never quite been so straightforward. Previously, Bengali Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n26 b o l l y w o o d and po s tm o d e rni sm director Satyajit Ray’s socio-realist films frequently stood as fitting flagship examples of national Indian cinema, yet his specific regional focus and lack of appeal for mass Indian audiences suggested otherwise. Popular Indian films rarely directly address the nation, and the fact that American cinema is continually adopted as Bollywood’s ‘blueprint’ also makes the study of both preand postcolonial Indian cinema problematic (Vitali, 2006). The nationalist focus of Indian film scholarship has naturally led to certain film texts being studied on film courses and written about more than others. For example, Mother India (1957), as national allegory, is perhaps the most written-about Indian film and regularly tops the lists of core texts of most Indian film studies courses. Another popular pair of topics which have been increasingly drawn upon in recent years and are tied up with issues of nation are terrorism and border-crossing – both relating to India’s ongoing conflict concerning the Indo-Pak partition. But focusing solely on the national-ness or political function of Hindi films is not only problematic for the mass of commercially successful films produced by Bollywood that do not engage with these issues, but also reductive for the way it can assume the homogenisation and fixing down of Indian identity. On the contrary, the Bollywood cinema of recent years aims not for a straightforward binding of Indian identity and nation, but rather for a fragmentation, confusion or disassembling of identity. Another popular area of study, branching off from national cinema, is diasporic representation and film viewing. Since the mid-1990s, contemporary Indian cinema has been described chiefly in relation to how it engages with Indian diasporic communities around the world and particularly the UK and USA. Nineties Bollywood saw the emergence of a new so-called ‘brat-pack’ generation of young filmmakers, including Aditya Chopra and Karan Johar. Johar is perhaps the most illustrious of the group, having been responsible for producing, if not directing, some of the most famous films in the NRI film canon: Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge [aka DDLJ] (assistant director), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai [aka K2H2] (director), and Kabhi Kushi Kabhie Gham [aka K3G] (director).7 The early films of these filmmakers usually portray NRIs as either corrupted by their Western cultural lifestyle (in the film Pardes [1997] the heroine’s US-residing Indian groom is depicted as an amoral, alcoholic, misogynistic rapist) or, in a moment of self-realisation and self-reformation, yearning to return to their true cultural origins (in DDLJ characters repeatedly express a desire for the preservation of their culture and Indian identity – most directly seen in the film’s opening sequence, where the heroine’s father expresses a wish to leave a cold and grey London and go back to the luscious fields of an unspoilt colourful Punjab). Such depictions are largely based on stereotypes and caricatures, forcing the identity of the non-resident Indian into homogenised representations. As Sanjay Srivastava (1998) has pointed out, these films create ‘a Westernised Indian-ness, a ‘real’ identity which is Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\nt r a d i t i o nal m o de s o f s tud yi n g in dian c in ema 27 fabricated and contradictory to actual identity’ (Srivastava: 196). Nevertheless, film sociologists have demonstrated how these texts correspond to and serve NRI spectators’ supposed own desire to reattach themselves to an imaginary India – the ‘Desi’ homeland: . . . there has been a re-mapping of the ‘Indian’ subject . . . located not just within the confines of India but also outside the nation-state where countries of actual residence appear to matter little next to the diasporic character’s ‘essential’ identity premised upon origins. (Kaur, 2005: 310) Pleasure in film viewing for NRI audiences is equated to the text’s open patriotism and securing of Indian cultural identity, although some empirical work on audiences suggests that this is not the case and that the pleasure received from such films is based more on aesthetic grounds: the originality of the script, the performance and star power of the actors, and the look of the film in terms of its musical picturisations8 and fashionable costumes (ibid.). Furthermore, as Kaur tries to prove through her interviews with diasporic viewers, these misrepresentations can at times backfire and actually be rejected by the NRI audience as inaccurate and somewhat cringeworthy. Although NRI characters are not unfamiliar to Indian cinema (having regularly served as negative stereotypes even before the nineties), the release of DDLJ is often seen as the milestone that signalled a shift of agenda in the Indian film industry. DDLJ is regarded as a flagship example for the Bollywood NRI film. The film has famously broken records for being the longest consecutively running Hindi movie (by January 2013 it had sustained 900 weeks in a Mumbai theatre9), and is a core text used on Indian cinema courses to explore notions of national identity in Hindi cinema. The film broke international records for Bollywood, and was one of the first films to set the majority of its story on location abroad, in Switzerland (although in reality this was achieved much earlier, such as in the 1960s with films like An Evening in Paris). DDLJ was seen to signal a switch in Bollywood’s targeted audience, from local Indians to global NRIs. It perhaps marked the beginning of Bollywood’s international profile, although the first Bollywood film to reach the top ten UK box-office charts was Dil Se (1998). The NRI-centred plots of films like DDLJ transformed the style and form of Hindi films, providing more opportunities for foreign location shoots (outdoor song sequences), an increased use of English, a greater engagement with modernity and displays of extreme wealth, and raising issues surrounding family separation and detachment. Studies of diasporic cinema have considered splitting it into two different stages: firstly, the 1990s patriotic Bollywood nostalgia film, and secondly, the rise of films from NRI diasporic filmmakers such as Mira Nair, Gurinder Chadha, Deepa Mehta and Srinivas Krishna (Desai, 2004). However, the fact Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n28 b o l l y w o o d and po s tm o d e rni sm that the Bollywood NRI genre has evolved in recent years requires us to now consider adding a third kind of cinema to this category. The films of directors such as Karan Johar are held to be prime examples of the first stage of the Bollywood NRI genre, yet it is interesting how Johar’s later films such as Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (aka KANK, 2006), Kal Ho Naa Ho (aka KHNH, 2003) and My Name is Khan (aka MNIK, 2010) do not quite fit this model and complicate the supposed NRI pursuit of soulful Indian-ness. For example, we can read K3G as a highly ironic critique of Indian values (see Hogan, 2008: 160–93), while Johar’s subsequent three films can be seen to embrace a fragmented Indian identity that does not wish to return to its roots. Characters in KHNH now celebrate the split or diffusion of Indian and Western identity and are happy to remain in New York, and in the case of KANK there is no mention of India at all. On a more general level, there seems to be a more Western-friendly outlook and positive view of Western cultural consumption in these films. Even in MNIK, which describes how terrorism has disrupted the lives of the US-residing diaspora, there is a strong desire for assimilation and the focus shifts towards the need to act out one’s rights as a diasporic US citizen. Discussions surrounding NRI representation in Hindi films can tend to lead us to the assumption that these films work on the level of patriotism and cultural preservation, but I think there is also room here for self-critique, as I will reveal later when I discuss the fragmentation of Indian identity (of both NRI and resident Indians) in recent Bollywood films. Some scholars are more cynical and warn of how far this diaspora argument can be taken. For example, Kaur states that many commercial Hindi NRI films often fail on the level of misrepresentation, and therefore it is too glib and cursory to say that Bollywood enables a religion-like nostalgia for people of the Indian diaspora . . . It is also specious to presume that Indian popular films provide a ‘shared culture’ that links everyone who is ethnically Indian as a general rule. (Kaur, 2005: 313–14) The diaspora approach, for all its revelations about Bollywood’s internationalisation, has been complicated, if not superseded, by new agendas and modes of representation. Contemporary Bollywood mediates and celebrates more significantly the experience of the (post)modern Indian and his or her fragmentation. Instead of simply aspiring towards caricaturing and capitalising on the diasporic experience, newer Bollywood films are now invested in the questioning and blurring of identity, rendering the previous separation of ‘foreigner’ and ‘desi’ problematic. Owing to the somewhat exhaustive output of diaspora-related work on post-1990s Hindi cinema, I have chosen to shift the focus away from the NRI. Instead, I draw attention to aspects of the film text that operate outside issues of migration, for not everything in Bollywood Not for distribution or resale.

I aim to bring attention back to Bollywood’s textuality and, in doing so, also consider its effect on other emerging targeted audiences within modern developing India and the nonIndian global market. Postcolonial theory has also provided a fairly solid backbone to much Indian film scholarship. Postcolonial approaches to Indian cinema have helped to trace and explain the industry’s shifts during India’s pre-colonial, colonial and post-independence eras. As my own study engages with postmodern approaches, it overlaps with and shares similar interests to postcolonialism (such as the desire to rewrite or reconstruct past histories and the use of textual hybridity), but it also seeks to offer something beyond the postcolonial perspective. The application of postcolonial criticism can present problems for the study of contemporary Bollywood cinema, particularly when it calls for a righteous return to cultural autonomy and tradition instead of addressing the more complex emerging modes of resistance to cultural authenticity accounted for in my own research. Postcolonial issues are further addressed in Chapters 4 and 5 in relation to postmodernism and postmodern Bollywood. Cultural studies approaches have also been prevalent in Indian film studies and have also tended to help tie Bollywood films to issues of national identity. However, in contrast to the nationalism-focused discussions mentioned above, cultural studies of Bollywood films differ by placing a greater emphasis on and investing more in religious thematics as opposed to state politics by drawing attention to mythology, ritual customs, and particular culturally-driven signifying and belief systems (Dissanayake, 1988: 1). The cultural studies approach is important in helping explain how Indians construct, maintain, and respond to certain meaning systems that operate through the medium of film. However, by introducing postmodernism into the equation, I take this a step further and examine how Indians also deconstruct their own cinematic culture and meaning systems, as well as those of others (such as the West and Hollywood). My own investigation reveals an increased playfulness, inversion, subversion and questioning of such systems. For example, the tension between tradition and modernity is often considered a central theme in contemporary Asian cinema within cultural studies. But rather than seeing these two themes as polarised within Indian films (where modernity often represents the threat), my postmodern reading reveals how the lines between them have become erased or blurred. This is best seen in Bollywood’s recent blending of traditional mythological and science-fiction codes to convey an ambiguous, if not pessimistic, outlook on traditional Indian values (as explored in Chapter 5 through my reading of Koi . . . Mil Gaya). Some cultural sociologists have even equated Bollywood’s recent internationalisation with Hollywood hegemony, viewing the cinema’s global move as a threat to its cultural authenticity (see Dissanayake, 1988). Bollywood’s more Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n30 b o l l y w o o d and po s tm o d e rni sm recent globalised texts often fail to feature in cultural studies readings, perhaps because they do not present themselves as straightforward cultural political tools or ‘indigenous instruments of communication’ (ibid.: 3). They are too explicitly and self-consciously steeped in their desire to make money as commercial hybridised products, and as Wimal Dissanayake has confirmed, Indian films are deemed valuable only as windows to Asian culture and not for their artistic merit, unlike the ‘good artistic films’ of Satyajit Ray or Yasujirō Ozu (ibid.: 7). I would argue that as Bollywood has become increasingly conscious of its capacity for cultural hybridity, it has used this to its advantage. Through my own analysis, I determine how the recent cross-cultural ‘inauthentic’ influences in Bollywood films do not simply set out to sabotage Indian cinematic culture, but instead also enrich and affirm it. These postmodern-esque film texts, particularly in the form of remakes, allow Bollywood to shift between Hollywood universality and cultural specificity, maintaining a unique film language as original plagiarisms.\n\nP o p u la r d e f i n i t i o n s : g u i d e s to B o l l yw o o d c i n e m a The publication of several introductory guidebooks on Bollywood since 2000 has paved the way for many further and higher education courses on popular Indian cinema in the West. These first-hand resources prove ideal for new audiences and novices seeking to grasp the (once daunting) general mechanics and peculiarities of the Bombay film industry. But some of these comprehensive guides have misled readers towards restrictive (if not outmoded and derogatory) definitions of the cinema they seek to understand. Wimal Dissanayake and K. Moti Gokulsing’s Indian Popular Cinema: A Narrative of Cultural Change (1998) is one such text, which, in its opening chapter, promotes its use as an introductory reading of Indian cinema for future Western media and film studies courses. Unfortunately, the book pays poor attention to styles and techniques in popular films beyond their musical dimensions and a handful of outmoded genres, here labelled as the mythological, the devotional, the social drama, and the erotic or romantic drama. The authors fail to unpick the ‘emotional excess’, ‘flashy’ (32) and ‘obtrusive’ editing (92) and ‘melodrama’ of popular films, or explain the possible intentions behind and desired effect of their ‘lack of realism’, ‘extravagant use of colour’ and ‘self-conscious use of sound’ (32). Instead, the authors’ focus on style and form is reserved for artistic films outside the remit of popular Indian filmmaking, which are explored in more detail and celebrated for their sequential editing, balanced framing, centred shots and image continuity. In separating the two, Dissanayake and Gokulsing suggest that art cinema’s purpose is to innovate and provoke, while Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\nt r a d i t i o nal m o de s o f s tud yi n g in dian c in ema 31 the popular cinema’s is to conform. As pure escapism, Bollywood is not associated with any kind of aesthetic politics. Themes such as selfhood, tradition versus modernity, alienation, and the impact of Westernisation are deemed to only find expression in the artistic cinema of Ray et al. (32). While the work of art film auteurs such as Ray (who is described by the authors as India’s greatest filmmaker) is discussed, the directors of Bollywood are presented as more homogeneous and therefore not distinctive enough in their technique to deserve individual attention – with the exception of Mani Ratnam, whose broad directorial work is only explored through a narrow selection of his most controversial and politically edgy films. Thus, despite their book’s title and opening promise to present and promote popular Indian cinema, Dissanayake and Gokulsing’s reading is driven by a partiality for ‘serious’ cinema. In their conclusion, the authors assert that popular cinema is best understood in relation to artistic cinema (136), which does nothing to assist the West’s already fuzzy definitions of Bollywood. The authors’ discussion of new popular Indian cinema, while hinting at its frenetic MTV and hybridised Hollywood visual style, also has a rather negative outlook. Contemporary Bollywood is pessimistically described as the ‘cardboard age’ – an error which is later corrected in the 2004 revision of the book. The second edition (Dissanayake and Gokulsing, 2004) includes an additional chapter noting the ‘broad concerns and technical attributes . . . [and] the narrative grammar of Hindi mainstream cinema [which] has metamorphosed significantly’ over the last decade (142). Here the authors note and begin to appreciate contemporary Bollywood cinema’s inherent contradictions and polysemic nature, its complex blending of Hollywood-style gloss and indigenous narrative ethos, its sexual openness, its potential for creative innovation via a fresh breed of directors,10 and its conflict between serving Western or modern material needs and negotiating cultural identity (143–4). Tejaswini Ganti’s Bollywood: A Guidebook to Popular Hindi Cinema provides a little more emphasis on recent changes in Bollywood, although her account still paints a fairly grey picture of contemporary popular Indian cinema. Discussing contemporary Bollywood through its corporatisation since the year 2000, Ganti (2004: 88) presents the cinema as the antithesis of the industry’s nostalgically mourned-for 1950s golden era, which is conversely seen as embodying creativity, originality, talent, quality and sincerity (28). She typifies newer Bollywood films through their ‘matter-of-factness’, their ‘essentially conservative outlook . . . regardless of their cosmopolitan and MTV inspired style’ (41), and their continuation of nationalist trends (emphasising their thematic focus on terrorism and Pro-Hindu politics). But Ganti does highlight important changes in the cinema’s stylistic presentation: fluid camera movements and rapid editing are mixed with more traditional frontal encounter or frontal aesthetics11 to create a unique hybrid style (144). Not for distribution or resale. For personal use only.\n\n32 b o l l y w o o d and po s tm o d e rni sm However, ultimately the author’s aesthetic account falls short owing to the socio-anthropological perspective she chooses to apply to her analysis. For example, her explanation for Bollywood cinema’s distinctively rich saturation of colours sees this not as a matter of aesthetic choice, but rather as a practical requirement to overcome the poor projection conditions at screenings in Indian villages (143). As other film researchers have discovered, colour plays an important part in the coding of Hindi films, guiding viewer pleasure and shaping the aesthetic agenda of the films (see Patrick Colm Hogan’s cognitive study of colour in Hindi films [2008: 194–249]). It can even serve as a filmmaker’s stylistic trademark, as in the case of Sanjay Leela Bhansali (see my analysis of Bhansali’s Devdas in Chapter 7).\n\n‘ B o l l y wo o d ’ : t h e d o ub l e -e dg ed wor d Bollywood, n. Brit./blwd/US/bliwd/[Humorous blend of the name of Bombay (see BOMBAY n.) and HOLLYWOOD n.] The Indian film industry, based in Bombay; Bombay regarded as the base of this industry. (The Oxford English Dictionary Online [dictionary.oed.com]) Indian cinema guidebooks will often begin with a proclamation that the Western world has finally ‘discovered’ popular Indian cinema through its global marketing under the guise of ‘Bollywood’ (Ganti, 2004: 2). But these commentaries reveal an ambiguous relationship with the term, which has been both exploited and sneered at by industry professionals and film scholars alike. The word ‘Bollywood’ can still be a taboo term which many writers on Indian cinema (such as Dissanayake and Gokulsing) have, with good intentions, tried wholeheartedly to reject or shake off in haste. Until more recently, much of the published work on Bollywood cinema has capitalised on the word by using it in book titles and on cover faces, while the authors of these texts have, within the opening pages, felt the need to offer justifications for its use through lengthy footnotes (see Pauwels, 2007: 43) or to frequently replace it with substitutes such as ‘Bombay’, ‘Hindi’ or ‘popular Indian’ cinema (see Ganti, 2004). But these alternative terms can be equally problematic: ‘popular Indian cinema’ is too vague and nation-centric, failing to emphasise the industry’s global, transnational and diasporic ventures; ‘hi-fi’ or ‘popular Hindi film’ misleadingly associates all films with Hindi-centred dialogue, ignoring the fact that many of the films (especially their song sequences) include Urdu and Islamic metaphors and English dialogue; and ‘Bombay film’ is problematic again owing to the industry’s numerous transnational and trans-regional productions. Of course, ‘Bollywood’ also brings its own complications by conversely trying to be all-encompassing. As Madhava Prasad (2003) notes, the phrase becomes an Not for distribution or resale.

(Prasad, 2003: 1) Quietly avoiding use of the term in his Encyclopaedia of Indian cinema (coauthored with Paul Willemen, 1999), Ashish Rajadhyaksha later outwardly rejects it in his article ‘The “Bollywoodization” of the Indian Cinema’ (2003), suggesting that the word has little to do with the actual film industry and instead signals a rather separate cultural phenomenon created by surrounding ancillary paraphernalia (theatre shows, art exhibitions, fashion culture). Rajadhyaksha argues that ‘Bollywood’ in fact signals the demise of the Bombay film industry, where marketing and product placement reduce cinema to ‘only to a memory, a part of the nostalgia industry’ (38). It therefore seems that the phrase ‘Bollywood’, despite all its commercial appeal and lure, has become a subject of shame and denial within film academia, and I believe that this ambivalence has in turn served to suppress our understanding of the cinema that the term alludes to. While the word may indeed stand for a cultural trend, fad or fashion, I believe it also serves as an artistic term: a marker of a particular kind of visual aesthetic phenomenon that is representative of a contemporised Indian film style. Rajadhyaksha’s call to ‘drive a wedge’ (31) between Bollywood and the Indian cinema is, I think, in i"
