DHIRANANDA\n\n1. Swami Dhirananda arrives unannounced in NYC in March 1929, and confronts Swami Yogananda about their partnership in Yogoda. This confrontation leads to the separation of Swami Dhirananda from that partnership with Swami Yogananda. After some three to four weeks of negotiations, \"That on or about the 11th day of April, 1929, defendant (Swami Yogananda), for a valuable consideration, made and executed and delivered to plaintiff (Swami Dhirananda) his Promissory Note in words and figures as follows, to wit: $8,000.00, New York City, N. Y. April 11, 1929.\n\nIn installments as herein stated, FOR VALUE RECEIVED, I promise to pay to SWAMI GIRI-DHIRANANDA, also known as BASU KUMAR BAGCHI, or order, the sum of Eight thousand dollars ($8000.00) on or before January 1, 1936. Payable at the Citizens National Trust & Savings Bank of Los Angeles, No. 457 South Spring Street, Los Angeles, California, in installments of One hundred dollars ($100.00) on the first day of each and every month beginning May 1, 1929 and so continuing each month until the entire principal sum is paid.\n\nShould any monthly installment of principal remain unpaid for a period of five (5) months, then, at the option of the holder of this note, the entire principal sum remaining unpaid shall become immediately due and payable.\n\nSwami Yogananda\n\nMunkunda Lal Ghosh\"\n\nThis Promissory Note was in payment of Swami Dhirananda's services as teacher, lecturer and writer for Yogoda religious seminary from 1922 to April 1929.\n\n2. Swami Dhirananda returns and leaves Mt. Washington Educational Center in Los Angeles. He remains in Los Angeles, continuing his service as a sannyasin and founds his Raja Yoga Society. Swami Dhirananda continues to publish his writings, teach and give weekly Sermons over the radio. He is invited to speak at clubs, schools and universities, and churches. Swami Dhirananda receives one installment amount of $100.00 on August 1, 1929. This is the only installment Swami Yogananda ever pays. Swami Yogananda reneges on the Promissory Note. (The \"Promissory Note\" was signed twice....the first signature was signed by his monastic name, Swami Yogananda, and the second signature was that of his Hindu given name, Mukunda Lal Gosh.\n\nhe executed and signed.)\n\n3. Swami Dhirananda files Complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California in and for the County of Los Angeles in or about December 1929. The original filing of his Complaint was lost or destroyed by the Court. (This is so stated in the 1935 Court lawsuit files.) At this point Swami Dhirananda does not proceed with the lawsuit. The lawsuit remains on hold.\n\n4. Swami Dhirananda decides in 1932 to return to college for a Ph.D. degree. He steps down from being a swami in December 1932 and enters the University of Iowa. Swami Dhirananda receives his Ph.D. degree in June 1935, and enters the field of brain wave research. He refiles Complaint on the Promissory Note on May 3, 1935. The Court permits Swami Dhirananda's (Dr. Basu Kumar Bagchi's) copies of the original Complaint files to be used.\n\n5. In the trial of the lawsuit of Swami Dhirananda vs. Swami Yogananda, Swami Yogananda accused Swami Dhirananda \"of taking secretly, against Swami Yogananda's will, and without Swami Yogananda's consent the sum Twenty Thousand Sixty-Six Dollars and sixty-one cents ($20,066.61) in the City of Los Angeles, County of Los Angeles, State of California beginning on the 14th day of April, 1923 in the years 1924, 1925, 1926, 1927, 1928, and up to and including the 24th day of April 1929.\"\n\nWith the lost of these financial records, Swami Yogananda was demanding that it was Swami Dhirananda that owed him monies in the amount of this $20,066.61.\n\nThis box containing the said lost checks and cancelled checks or otherwise, books, confidential records, papers and files were discovered by a janitor at Mt. Washington in an old rubbish heap in the basement of Mt. Washington in Los Angeles, on the 8th of May 1935. Swami Dhirananda had no knowledge of this box being hidden in the basement of Mt. Washington. And in this regard Swami Dhirananda alleged that Swami Yogananda was sent a monthly financial statement of the receipts and disbursements of said seminary. Swami Dhirananda had no means of knowledge or knowledge of Swami Yogananda's financial condition or any checks other than the checks he (Swami Dhirananda) had drawn on Swami Yogananda's bank account and received knowledge thereof beginning on or about the first day of January 1925 and up to and including on or about the 11th day of April 1929.\n\nSwami Giri-Dhirananda did not receive any salary or any other financial considerations or monies except his room and board from on or about the first day of January 1925, to on or about the 11th day of April 1929. (Swami Giri-Dhirananda's, Philosophic Insight was published by himself in 1925 and paid for my his own devotees. Swami Giri-Dhirananda was not the disciple of Swami Yogananda.)\n\nAll of the financial records of Swami Giri-Dhirananda were in the care of Judge James MacLachlin, who was also a past U.S. Congressional Senator from the Los Angeles area. Judge MacLachlin oversaw the running of Mt. Washington Educational Center in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Contents of the aforesaid mentioned box was examined and all money charges made by Swami Yogananda against Swami Giri-Dhirananda were proven false and untrue.\n\nA Decree of Judgment in this 1935 lawsuit of Swami Giri-Dhirananda vs. Swami Yogananda was handed down on the 22nd of Octpber 1935 in favor of the Compliant, Swami Giri-Dhirananda for the collection of the Promissory Note of $8,000.00.\n\nSwami Yogananda did give Notice of Intention to Move for a New Trial, but the Court denied the Motion on the 26th of November 1935.\n\nSwami Yogananda made no effort to pay the Promissory Note after the Judgment was entered. By that time the Decree of Judgment was entered in the Court case, he was in India.\n\nThere was a Writ of Execution for the Garnishment of Funds against Swami Yogananda's account at 1.) Security -First National Bank of Los Angeles dated the 5th of December 1935. There were no funds of Swami Yogananda in this bank, and 2.) Citizens National Trust & Savings Bank of Los Angeles dated the 30th of November 1935. This bank answered to the Writ of Execution for the Garnishment of Funds with $22.86 in Swami Yogananda's account.\n\nAs far as real property, Swami Yogananda was not an American citizen and was in the United States on a British visa; therefore he could not hold title to the Mt. Washington seminary property even in 1925. There was always a stand-in person who held title to that property and this was one of the reasons, if not the main reason for Judge James MacLachlin to oversee the Mt. Washington seminary. After Swami Dhirananda separated from Swami Yogananda, Judge James MacLachlin resigned from his post to oversee the Mt. Washington property. With the coming monies from James Lynn of Kansas City, Mo. in 1931, the Mt. Washington seminary property was put into the Non-profit religious organization holdings of Self Realization Fellowship, which was Chartered in the State of California on March 29, 1935. Therefore, there could not be a lien against the Mt. Washington property as it was not Swami Yogananda's Yogoda Society anymore. The real property had changed hands. The Promissory Note of $8,000.00 was against Swami Yogananda.\n\nSwami Yogananda arrived in Bombay (Mumbai) around the last part of August, 1935.\n\nand did not return to the United States until October 1936. Swami Dhirananda was now Dr. Basu Kumar Bagchi, upon graduating from the University of Iowa with a Ph.D. At the time that Swami Yogananda came back into the country in NYC, Dr. Bagchi held an assistant researcher's position with Harvard University for one of the University's Research Projects. Satisfaction of Judgment was finally made on the 30th of October 1936. The sum of $4200.00 was paid to clear the debt of Swami Yogananda's Promissory Note of $8,000.00. Swami Dhirananda, now Dr. Bagchi, received no monies after the lawyer fees were paid. Thus, ended the beginning years of Kriya in America.\n\nAnswers to Tru Enuf's 12/25/05 Posting\n\n1. I have only read excerpts from Satyananda's bio. Give me time, I will read the entire book. Let me point out that the idea or as you so aptly put it....\"the grand theme of religion\"...... being bringing science and religion together...... was not a new idea at all in 1916. It was Annie Besant of The Theosophical Society that took up residence in India in 1895 and wrote an article called, Hinduism, A Scientific Religion and then around 1886 F. Max Muller editing his Sacred Books of the East used the term, \"science of religion\". And before these writers was an amazing medical doctor in England named, John Elliotson that wrote many articles between 1832 and 1848 about Mesmerism. He was a surgeon and through all of his investigations and practices he came to the conclusion that there was a place (a space) in the brain of man that did not feel pain. He worked with a hypnotist and a priest to put his patients into this \"painless place/space\" in the brain before performing surgery on his patients.The hypnotist and the priest, of course, remained in the room with the patient during the surgery. Their service was not for the faint of heart. The only other avenue to relieve pain in surgery in those years was to let the patient drink whiskey until they passed out.So it was that Dr. Elliotson was finally going to release his findings about this painless place/space in the brain with a book he had written that was to be published in India. It was in the same year, just within months of his book's release, that Chloroform was discovered. So his book never sold, and his discovery and research of this \"place/space\" in the brain was mothballed in medical history. HOWEVER, remarkably there is a medical Doctor (surgeon) in Belgium today (2005) that is performing surgery on his patients in the same way that Dr. Elliotson did. Of course, the patients voluntarily elect to this procedure before their surgery. I understand he performs surgery through mesmerism or through applying anesthesia. It is simply up to the patient as to which \"painless\" method they prefer. It is a fact that there are people who are dying of the direst ravages of disease, who experience no pain whatsoever. So where is this place/space in the brain and how do we get to it. Mahatma Gandhi knew.\n\nAt the turn of the Nineteen Century in 1905 Einstein announced his discovery of E=MC2. With Einstein's theory of relativity, he proved up that All of Life is composed of Life-Light Energy Waves. It was by no chance of Destiny that \"The Science of Religion\" was\n\na natural and intriguing topic of conversation on that long returning boat trip from Japan between young yogi Yoganandaji and that amiable couple. The idea of \" the science of religion\" was adroitly brought to Yoganandaji's attention. This idea had been germinating here and there in the minds of Man for some 84 years. The time was ripe for the West to receive the Kriya Teachings of Swami Yogananda's and Swami Dhirananda's coming into America in 1920-22. It was time for the next step of a greater focus with a given Pathway to peek the interest in \"The Science of Religion\" .Now some 85 years later,we are at square one again in 2005 as we turn into the New Millineum with Darwin vs. Intelligent Design.. Interestingly, Swami Dhirananda wrote an intriguing article called, \"The Religion of Science\", which will soon be published.\n\n2. It was Swami Dhirananda's mother, who \"dug down into her apron strings\" to pay for her irresistible, insistent son's implorings to formally publish his first book called, The Science of Religion for his boyhood friend, Swami Yogananda.to carry with him and speak from on his journey as a Delegate from India to the International Congress of Religious Liberals in Boston in1920. Swami Dhirananda's name is on the Title Page of this book as Publisher. The book was published in July, 1920. Dhiranandaji also wrote, Psychological Chart in 1921, and again his mom paid the publishing bill. Dhiranandaji's name is on the front soft cover of the book as Publisher, 1921, but Dhiranandaji put Yoganandaji's name on the book as author, and sent it to him to have and use in Boston also.\n\n3. There is a saying in the marketplace that \" you cannot sell from an empty sack\"! Now there must be something to sell and also be a place to sell from. So you have the \"driving force\" of the Teachings (the writer) and the \"driving force\" of the Temple (the leader). You must have the Teachings and the Temple to make a religio/philosophical work go.But remember these young men were just in their twenties to take on this heroic task of spreading Kriyayoga in America. Yoganandaji was all of 27 years old when he came as a leader into America in 1920; Dhiranandaji was all of 27 years old when he came as the writer/Teacher into America in 1922. Yoganandaji's birth date is January 5, 1893; Dhiranandaji's birth date is January 7, 1895. There is exactly two days, two years difference between these young men. Think about this and try to understand them in the light of each one's God-given talent and life's mission. These young men were close friends and in those days \"your word was your bond\". Their were verbal \"gentleman's agreements\" between the two concerning their talent and life's mission. Yogoda Sat-Sanga was not a non-profit organization. The \"Promissory Note\" in and of itself was the written document for proof of the debt. There is a biography in progress on Swami Dhirananda/akaDr. Basu Kumar Bagchi's life that will offer more particulars.\n\n4. When it comes to the publishing and who paid for Philosophic Insight, if you have a First or Second Edition of this book, please turn to the Copyright page and at the bottom of this page you will read, \"From the Press of Gem Publishing Company, Los Angeles\" The original order of Philosophic Insight books was for 500 copies, made on September 10, 1925. Swami Dhirananda placed this order to Gem Publishing Company for production of his book under his authorship. The original quotation amount for the production of this book was $295.00, of which Swami Dhirananda made a Deposit of $140.00 on September 14, 1925. The final production costs for publishing this book, including binding costs, an extra 24 pages, and alteration costs came to a grand total of $469.20, with the balance due upon completion of the order. As I said before Swami Dhirananda's devotees donated monies to him to pay for the publication of his book. It would appear that since these two swamis, Yoganandaji and Dhiranandaji, were working together in the spread of Kriyayoga , Yogoda Sat-Sanga was a natural distribution center for the books. The books revenues helped pay the bills at the Yogoda seminary..\n\nLAWSUIT BETWEEN SRI NERODE AND YOGANANDA\n\nsrflongago\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe suit was brought in 1940 for a separation of assets of the self-realization fellowship between Yogananda and Nerode, who thought he was a partner of Yogananda. Remember that that fellowship was not a non-profit religious organization before its charter in the middle 1930's, so this was possible at least for what had been acquired before then.\n\nThe grounds were Yoganada's unfitness to run such an organization due to his relations with young women, so that the purpose of the organization could not be achieved, and if it was a partnership, the assets should be divided. The newspaper reports are on this website. The remaining documentation is in the Los Angeles court records, of which I have a copy. Not everything is there, the last page says Faye Wright took back SRF exhibits (about the time she became President).\n\nIn any case, Yogananda avoided service of the summons to appear according to the sheriff, who testified to this so that the suit could go on anyway. Rose, the famous expensive criminal attorney that Yogananda hired, came on the first day and presented a document Nerode had signed very early saying he would never ask for anything from Yogananda or his organization. This was probably because of previous experience of Yogananda, who did not have such an agreement with Nerode's predecessor, Dhirananda.\n\nThe judge then dismissed the case. When asked by Srimata Nerode about the document (predating her marriage), Sri Nerode told her that he trusted Yogananda at that earlier time and signed whatever was put in front of him without reading it. If he knew or posibly remembered that document, there would have been no court case and no headlines. But such is life!\n\nNerode's family had, since the early seventeenth century, been administrators to Muslim rulers working in the Arabic language. They moved near Calcutta en masse when the English took over. It took a generation to learn English and become British India administrators.\n\nSince the sixteenth century they maintained an Ashram for visiting itinerant Yogis from all over India, and had very well-known Yogis in the family. Sri Nerode's childhood was spent in the company of these Yogis. None of this still exists, having been destroyed by the partition of India, leaving the family as refugees.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Calcutta with a special certificate in Sanskrit (he said he studied Sanskrit formally for 22 years before becoming a serious interpreter of the ancient writings), Nerode became a wandering Yogi for a few years throughout India, Burma, and South China, visiting the many religious figures of the time. In 1919-20 he came to the US for graduate study in Sanskrit at Harvard, but did not think much of their famous Sanskrit scholar. He then went to Berkeley and had the same experience. He might have known that the University of Calcutta had better people, but he did not.\n\nHe encountered Yogananda in Boston and then in San Fransisco. Despite his family's deep suspicion that Yogananda was not sound based on their contacts in India, and despite their urging him not to join with Yogananda, he did, and established the Detroit Yogoda Center. His first book of poetry, \"Wings of Bliss\" was published there in 1928. He did a lot of travelling then and later, establishing many Yogoda (later Self Realization Fellowship) centers in various cities, training the local leaders, and returning like a circuit rider.\n\nAfter Dhirananda left the job of director of Mt Washington center due to Yogananda's relations with women, Yogananda asked Nerode to become director. He was very active in that regard till about August 1932, when Yogananda gave him the original \"HOUSECAR\", a little house mounted on a truck chassis, which Nerode, wife, and child travelled in for a number of years. During this period, there were several simultaneous vice presidents of SRF, Nerode, Panditij, and the self-professed renegade Coptic esoteric priest Hamid Bey. They all were told they were partners. Bey left to form his own organization, which still exists, the Coptic Fellowship of America. Panditji was deeply suspicious and left. So Nerode believed himself to be the only remaining \"partner\".\n\nNerode contributed articles to most issues of East West Magazine. Yogananda, Nerode, Hamid Bey all toured and often gave lectures together for which the press clippings survive. Yogananda and Nerode even published joint poems in East-West. They were best friends at that time.\n\nThe attraction to Nerode and the other lecturers of Yogoda and SRF as it was initially set up is that it was supposed to a society of equals and to be compatible with all religions and to teach all and any paths to self-realization, especially those associated with Sri Yukteswar, the mentor of Yogananda.\n\nThe several teachers, including those above, used their own Yoga and/or esoteric backgrounds for their teaching, while selling the Yogananda literature at their lectures and remitting proceeds to Mt Washington SRF even had a Polish faith healer among the lecturers, Roman Ostoja, who had no Yoga background whatsoever. I have Ostoja's books (rare) , as well as Hamid Bey's own lessons, which are easily available.\n\nPassing over the unpleasant period of Nerode coming to the same conclusions that Dhirananda had in 1938-40, after 1940 Nerode was a travelling Yoga lecturer on his own, till 1950. He settled in Chicago and taught Yoga their till his death in 1983. Srimata continued teaching till about 1995. There are many midwestern Yoga teachers whom he trained who are still active in the midwest. A couple of his books can be purchased from Amrita Foundation.\n\ndivine gypsy\n\nRegistered User\n\n(7/27/06 5:57 pm)\n\nReply Re: The paternity suit against Yogananda This should be part of the Walrus record.

She only asked for proof. I've researched it and it looks like the whole thing started out as an extortion plot that then spun out of control when it got published in New Times.\n\nHere's the first letter Michael Flynn sent to New Times demanding a retraction after they published a cover story called \"The Devotee's Son\" about Ben Erskine on July 5th, 2001. It brings up some interesting points.\n\n________________________________________\n\nTo: Mr. Michael Lacey\n\nExecutive Editor\n\nRon Russell, Author\n\nLos Angeles New Times\n\n1950 Sawtelle Blvd. Suite 200\n\nLos Angeles, CA 90025\n\nRe: Los Angeles New Times Article dated July 5, 2001, \"The Devotee's Son\"\n\nDear Mr. Lacey and Mr. Russell:\n\nThis firm represents Self Realization Fellowship, (hereinafter \"SRF\" , monks and nuns within SRF, and one of its attorneys, Michael Flynn. On July 5, 2001, Los Angeles New Times, (hereinafter \"New Times\" , published a false and defamatory article concerning SRF founder, Paramahansa Yogananda, (deceased since 1952), SRF, monks and nuns within the organization, and Mr. Flynn, entitled, \"The Devotee's Son.\" This article is not only false, replete with overt lies and twisted half-truths, it represents an unconscionably malicious portrayal of one of the most revered men in the modern era. Writing forty-nine years after the death of Yogananda, the article's author, Ron Russell, knowingly \"attacks\" the reputation, dignity, and lifelong integrity of Yogananda, who is not alive to defend himself, and whose life, in truth, singularly represents the essence of all that is good, virtuous and loving in a human being. In contrast to the reality of Yogananda's life, the article is the shameful fabrication of an unethical journalist, and the deceitful product of New Times, a publication of which approximately 20% is dedicated to explicit pictorial ads for the porn industry.\n\nAs hereinafter demonstrated, Mr. Russell and New Times rushed the article to publication knowing that they could have easily and independently corroborated the subject blood test which definitively excludes the alleged paternity of Yogananda. Independent corroboration by New Times could have been achieved within a time frame of thirty-six hours, and months before the article was published at the simple cost of having the blood donor send an independent blood specimen, supervised by New Times, in a $36.00 Fed-Ex package. Although Mr. Russell had been working on the article for months prior to publication, and had been dealing with the Erskine family and their lawyer, Mr. Shane Reed, for at least four weeks prior to publication, at substantial cost to the New Times, (the phone bills alone exceeded the cost of a Fed-Ex package), Mr. Russell did not contact Mr. Flynn until June 22, 2001, just twelve days prior to publication. At that time, Mr. Russell specifically knew how to contact the donor through his own sources, namely Mr. Reed and J. Donald Walters (a.k.a. Kriyananda). Between June 22, 2001, when Mr. Russell spoke to Mr. Flynn, and Mr. Flynn offered to meet with Mr. Russell and his lawyer and his publisher in order to confirm the DNA results and corroborate the blood specimen, and July 5, 2001 when the article was published, Mr. Russell and New Times chose not to conduct this simple corroboration. Both Mr. Russell and his editors then knew that they would have had no story if the blood specimen was confirmed. Mr. Russell's agenda of deceit and \"attack\" in order to bootstrap his reputation as a writer, at the price of the reputation of a great man, would have been forever defeated because of the modern science of DNA. The plain truth of a DNA test would have left Mr. Russell and New Times with a big expense bill and no salacious material to attract their porn industry advertisers.\n\nThe article has not only been distributed throughout the Los Angeles area, the home of SRF, it has been published online worldwide. The article has caused irreparable damage to SRF, its monastics, its members and to Michael Flynn. Of even greater importance, the article damages the reputation and work of Yogananda, a man who dedicated his life to the upliftment of all mankind in a humane effort to ease human suffering. Mr. Russell's angry article only adds to the burden of such suffering.\n\nPursuant to California Civil Code Â§ 48a, this is a demand for a retraction/correction of the article. This demand includes a retraction of the primary theme of the article as set forth below. It also includes, but is not limited to, the false and defamatory statements which are recited in Attachment 1 to this letter and are incorporated herein.\n\nNew Times and Mr. Russell are undoubtedly aware, and probably relied upon the fact, that the laws involving libel preclude an action for libel by a decedent or his estate. Thus, you have fabricated a malicious and cowardly attack upon Paramahansa Yogananda, deceased since 1952. But the statements in the article attributable to Mr. Russell, and the statements Mr. Russell attributes to his sources, together with the innuendo manufactured by the article's false and defamatory themes of and concerning SRF, its monastics, and Michael Flynn constitute actionable defamation and libel under California and federal law. Neither Mr. Flynn nor the involved SRF monastics are public figures subject to the proof requirements for actual malice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and assuming either SRF, the organization, or the subject of the article invoke actual malice standards in part, as you know, malice can be proven in a libel case by evidence of the publisher's failure to do a proper investigation, by the publisher's reliance on sources known to be unreliable, by reliance on sources known to be biased against the plaintiff, by reliance on persons who are not in a position to possess personal knowledge, and by reliance on persons who have demonstrated anger and hostility to the plaintiff, among other factors. St Amant v. Thompson, 390 U.S. 727, 731-733 (196 ; Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, 388 U.S. 130 (1967); Reader's Digest Association, Inc. v. Sup. Ct., 37 Cal.3d 244; Fisher v. Larson, 138 Cal.App. 3d 627 (1982); Pep v. Newsweek, Inc. 553 F.Supp. 1000 (S.D.N.Y. 1983). Here, you have made serious accusations against Mr. Flynn and SRF, and no one from New Times even bothered to contact essential witnesses to verify the false statements in the article, particularly the most obvious and significant witness, Biswanath Ghosh, Yogananda's nephew, whose blood definitively defeats the primary theme of your entire article. This purposeful avoidance of the truth constitutes actual malice. See Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc. v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657, 682, 691-692 (1989); Vandenburg v. Newsweek, Inc., 441 F.2d 378, 380 (5th Cir), cert denied, 404 U.S. 864 (1971). Moreover, your inflammatory story line, and cover page entitled \"The Devotee's Son,\" bolsters an inference of actual malice. Id.; see also Duffy v. Leading Edge Products, Inc. 44 F.3d 308, 315 n. 10 (5th Cir. 1995); Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 680 F. 2d 527, 539 (7th Cir. 1982), cert denied, 459 U.S. 1226 (1983).\n\nThe primary and dominant theme of the article is that Paramahansa Yogananda engaged in an adulterous affair with a married woman resulting in the birth of an out of wedlock \"love child,\" Benjamin Erskine; and that SRF, its monastics and Mr. Flynn have engaged in a six-year coverup, even conspiring to falsify DNA test results. This theme is a total fabrication, manufactured and woven together by Mr. Russell from unreliable and/or biased sources, and motivated by Mr. Russell's long standing, malicious, repeated, and scandalous efforts to intentionally damage SRF and its defenders, including Mr. Flynn. Fortunately, Mr. Russell's malicious fabrication is easily defeated by the simple corroboration of Biswanath Ghosh's blood. The article's obvious purpose is to cause a reasonable person reading the article to believe and accept its false and defamatory theme. SRF and Mr. Flynn will adduce overwhelming evidence that a reasonable person is led to believe that Yogananda is an adulterer, and that SRF and Mr. Flynn have deceitfully manipulated this reported truth. Moreover, the alleged out of wedlock birth of Erskine in 1933 in the state of California constituted the specific violation of several criminal statutes. Thus, the theme of the article implies that SRF and Mr. Flynn have engaged in criminal conduct in colluding to conceal Yogananda's alleged crimes. As noted in the article, Mr. Flynn is an attorney representing SRF. Thus, the article's primary theme, its innuendo, coupled with the omission of key facts available to the author, all suggest, imply and state that Mr. Flynn engaged in illegal, unethical and criminal acts in his profession as an attorney, including the alteration of evidence. This, of course is libel per se.\n\nMr. Russell knew or should have known with even a minimum amount of investigation that the theme of the article was totally false. Mr. Flynn not only told Erskine that Yogananda could not possibly be Erskine's father, he also sent a letter to Mr. Russell offering to meet with him, his publisher and lawyer. A copy of this letter is attached hereto as Attachment 2. In writing and in a phone conversation, Mr. Flynn offered to produce specific documentation irrefutably proving the falsity of the theme of the article. Mr. Flynn even gave Mr. Russell his hotel number in Paris in order to set up a meeting. Mr. Flynn expressly informed Mr. Russell that SRF had offered Mr. Reed the option of flying Biswanath Ghosh, the nephew of Yogananda and blood donor, from India to the United States in order to verify the test results, and that Mr. Reed had never responded or challenged the results. Mr. Flynn made the same offer to Mr. Russell. Mr. Russell never responded. While Mr. Flynn was in Europe on business, without contacting any of the relatives who donated blood, without agreeing to independently verify the test results by the simple procedure of procuring new blood samples from Biswanath Ghosh, and by publishing the falsehood that Mr. Flynn \"deflected the matter by saying he had represented celebrities . . . ,\" Mr. Russell maliciously manufactured the falsehood that Mr. Flynn and SRF had conspired to alter the test results and thereby conceal the \"truth\" of Yogananda's paternity. Fundamental ethics of journalism required Mr. Russell to contact the definitive source for the article, Mr. Biswanath Ghosh. Although Mr. Russell knew this fundamental ethical requirement, he pushed the story to publication intentionally and maliciously disregarding the truth in order to defame SRF and make money for New Times by increasing its free circulation and thereby attract more advertisers, particularly those in the porn industry. The editors of New Times are able to measure their profits based on the tabloid sensationalism of its articles, particularly articles that pander to the taste of a prurient reader likely to respond to the ads of its porn customers. If Mr. Russell and the editors of New Times had conducted even a cursory investigation designed to ferret out truth rather than fatten profits, they would have discovered at least the following.\n\nMr. Russell knew or should have known that his primary sources, members of the Erskine family, at least two of whom have been convicted of various felonies, have engaged in specific acts of extortion seeking to obtain money from SRF by threat of exposure of the false claim of Yogananda's alleged paternity. Indeed, Mr. Russell quotes one of Erskine's adult children in his article, who has been charged with at least nine separate felonies, has been a habitual heroin addict on probation, and who has served time in prison, as one of his sources. This individual traveled to Los Angeles, went to SRF headquarters on Mt. Washington, and expressly attempted to extort money from Mr. Flynn and SRF under threat of \"going to the press.\" Acting solely out of compassion for this person, the SRF leadership chose not to file criminal charges. Yet Mr. Russell, using this unfortunate person as his unwitting dupe and primary source, paints a picture of her in his article as an innocent child of an innocent victim, her father, Ben Erskine, both of whom Mr. Russell suggests were ignored and abused - the daughter by an SRF monastic, \"Mukti Mata,\" ( who is perhaps one of the kindest, gentlest human beings on earth), and the father by SRF's attorney, Mr. Flynn.\n\nHowever, Mr. Russell did not even have to undertake the most cursory investigation of the Erskine family in order to conclude that SRF was the target of an overt extortion attempt. Before contacting the Erskines, Russell had long utilized Ananda and Kriyananda, both of whom are well publicized antagonists of SRF, as his primary sources. In his article, Russell unwittingly admits (perhaps because of his blinding bias) to have seen or been informed of a letter sent by Shane Reed, Erskine's lawyer, a copy of which is attached as Attachment 3 hereto, in which Mr. Reed seeks a \"financial settlement\" from SRF under threat of initiating \"a paternity suit and undertake responsibility and control over such matters as the interment dispute.\" In his article and in past articles, Mr. Russell viciously attacks SRF in connection with the \"interment dispute\" using, inter alia, Ananda and Kriyananda as his primary sources. Mr. Russell knew that these sources were highly suspect both because of their bias and because of Kriyananda's character and veracity deficiencies. Ananda and Kriyananda (who have been adjudged liable for tortious conduct involving sexual molestation of numerous women and for fraud) have long held demonstrably biased and antagonistic positions to SRF, including the \"interment dispute.\" The actual collusion between Mr. Russell, a biased writer, the Erskine family, using their daughter, a convicted heroin addict seeking money for a frivolous paternity claim against SRF, a non-profit corporation physically and legally incapable of paternity, and Kriyananda, an adjudicated fraud, presents compelling proof of actual malice and reliance on discredited sources.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Russell omits from the article that Mr. Flynn informed Mr. Reed, within days of receiving the attached letter, that the letter constituted criminal extortion because SRF, as a religious organization, obviously could not be anyone's \"father\" or legally responsible to a 68 year old adult, Erskine, for \"paternity\"(citing the recent Erin Brockovich extortion convictions); and that the threat of undertaking \"control\" over the \"interment dispute\" in order to obtain money constituted extortion. Mr. Russell omits from the article that Mr. Reed stated in response that he was \"withdrawing\" the letter and asked Mr. Flynn not to report the matter to the District Attorney. Mr. Russell fails to state in the article: that Mr. Reed acknowledged that the Erskines were \"poor\"; could not afford any costs for DNA testing; could not afford any civil litigation; had no actual legal claims against SRF because Erskine was an adult and Yogananda was deceased; that \"others outside the family\"were interested in the \"interment dispute\"; that the Erskine family had no real interest in the \"interment dispute\"; that the family wanted money, that he didn't know what others wanted, and that the family had no proof of the alleged paternity. When informed by Mr. Flynn that evidence established that Yogananda could not have been the father because he was in Kansas City during the period of conception, that individuals still alive who knew Yogananda would consider the claim ludicrous, and that SRF would never submit to extortion, Mr. Reed agreed that although no legal claim existed, in order to resolve the historical record and to achieve peace of mind for the Erskine family, and at SRF's express request, Ben Erskine would provide a blood sample for DNA testing. Mr. Flynn gratuitously offered to have SRF pay for independent DNA testing using blood samples taken from the children of Yogananda's deceased siblings. Mr. Reed was informed of and expressly agreed to all of the protocols and procedures used to accomplish the blood extraction, including specific agreement to use an SRF monastic of the highest integrity to go to India and convince Biswanath Ghosh and other children of siblings to provide blood in the presence of a certified pathologist with specifically identifiable, sealed vials of blood samples which were then Fed-Exed directly to a lab mutually agreed upon by both Mr. Reed and SRF.\n\nAttached hereto as Attachment 4 are the following documents all of which were sent to Mr. Reed: the \"family tree\" of Yogananda, identifying the blood donors; certifications of identity, addresses, and voluntary blood withdrawal from the three blood donor-relatives; declarations and certifications of the Medical Doctor-pathologist attesting to the withdrawal procedures; the Fed-Ex waybill and tracking no. sending the sealed blood vials to the lab; the packaging certification and invoice of the sealed blood vials; and the cover letter of the SRF monastic. Mr. Reed provided all of the foregoing to Mr. Russell prior to publication, including the letter of the monastic; and Mr. Russell has distorted or overtly misrepresented the propriety of the protocols and procedures involving the blood withdrawal and transfer. Mr. Russell on his own has simply fabricated an \"attack\" on Mr. Flynn, on the involved monastic, and on the blood-donor protocols, in order to manufacture a story against Yogananda. His conduct represents the epitome of journalistic deceit designed to make a name for himself at the expense of destroying the reputation of a great and revered man not able to confront him with the truth. Punitive damages equal to the magnitude of such perfidy will be sought in order to dissuade Mr. Russell and similar muckrackers from engaging in such future conduct.\n\nAfter the testing conclusively excluded Yogananda, (see the test results from \"Genetic Technologies attached hereto as Attachment 5), Mr. Flynn even offered to bring Biswanath Ghosh to the U.S., but Mr. Reed declined. Mr. Reed had confirmed through his own sources including Ananda, who was in litigation with SRF, that the blood procurement process was legitimate. To this day, Mr. Reed has never challenged the results, nor has any other member of the Erskine family. Mr. Russell has manufactured a claim on behalf of the Erskines and manufactured a false and defamatory story. Had Mr. Russell consulted with an attorney prior to publication, he would have learned that no legal claim for paternity exists against SRF or Yogananda. Had Mr. Russell simply arranged for the corroboration of Biswanath Ghosh's blood sample he would have had no story. Thus, we deem that Mr. Russell's effort to advance such a claim on behalf of the Erskines, having knowledge of the extortionate conduct of the Erskines, makes him a party to the extortion. Included in the defamation and libel action will be claims for Mr. Russell's collusion with the Erskine family seeking to extort money from SRF under threat of publishing the false and defamatory paternity allegations.\n\nPlease be advised that suit will be brought on these matters on August 3, 2001 seeking compensatory and punitive damages. It is recommended that Mr. Russell and the Los Angeles New Times publish a full front page retraction and apology with the signature of Mr. Russell attesting to the falsehood of the story and subject to language to be approved by Mr. Flynn and SRF. Such an apology and retraction will serve to minimize the damages already incurred in this matter. Please be further advised that SRF and Mr. Flynn intend to bring Biswanath Ghosh, Yogananda's nephew, to Los Angeles for a videotaped deposition and blood extraction to take place on September 10, 2001.\n\nWe are herewith providing you with advance notice of the subject deposition because Mr. Ghosh must travel from India and it is imperative that SRF provide the results of this deposition and corroboration of Mr. Ghosh's blood sample to its members throughout the world in order to mitigate further damages caused by the article. Notice of said deposition shall be served with the complaint.\n\nPlease be further advised not to destroy, alter or corrupt any of the evidence in this matter, including the notes and any audio tapes made by Mr. Russell, particularly tapes made in violation of Cal. Penal Code Â§ 632.\n\nFinally, Mr. Russell and the New Times have acquired a reputation as having an \"attack\" style of journalism, publishing anything false, scandalous and defamatory in order to increase its advertising revenues. This particular style of journalism, lacking balance, fairness and truth, has been rejected by legitimate journalists and it has resulted in numerous, large jury verdicts against publications such as New Times. We note that Mr. Russell and the New Times have previously published two false and defamatory \"attack\" articles against SRF. We also note that Ananda and Kriyananda, two of Mr. Russell's sources, have advertised in the New Times on the page facing the page on which Mr. Russell's article appears. Please be advised that SRF intends to use the previous articles authored by Mr. Russell, his improper reliance on Kriyananda and Ananda as sources and the \"attack\" style of New Times for purposes of establishing punitive damages in this matter. Pursuant to Cal. Civil Code Â§ 48a, SRF and Michael Flynn hereby demand a retraction, apology and admission of improper reliance on Ananda and Kriyananda, subject to language to be approved by SRF and Mr. Flynn.\n\nThis letter does not attempt to be a complete or exhaustive statement of Mr. Flynn's, SRF's, or its monastics', rights or claims against you or the author of the article, nor do any of the statements contained herein constitute a waiver or relinquishment of any of their rights or remedies, whether legal or equitable, all of which are expressly reserved.\n\nVery Truly Yours,\n\nFLYNN, SHERIDAN & STILLMAN\n\nBy:\n\nMichael J.

It too brings up some interesting points.\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nJuly 13, 2001\n\nMr. Shane A. Reed, Esquire\n\nP.O. Box 452\n\nJacksonville, OR 97530\n\nDear Mr. Reed:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter dated July 12, 2001. It is unclear whether it was written to protect yourself from liabilty, which you have now admitted, or at the behest of New Times, or of Mr. Russell, with whom you have now admitted your complicity. It is clear that it was not written to protect the Erskines. It is also clear that you have chosen to distort, if not misrepresent, our several conversations, particularly those following your now infamous \"media feeding frenzy\" letter. You will recall in that letter that you were seeking a \"financial settlement\" from SRF in order to avoid a \"media feeding frenzy\" over a \"paternity' claim against SRF , or was it for a claim against a man who has been dead for 49 years!\n\nWith your now admitted collusion with the New Times, you have fulfilled what you and your clients, including Melissa Simpson, (while on probation), both threatened in order to extort money from a non-profit church. You have spawned a \"media feeding frenzy\"; and you have further exacerbated it with your recent letter attempting to justify \"overwhelming legal claims\" that have not only been been statutorily barred, by your own admission, for at least 49 years, but have no basis in fact or law. According to your most recently concocted theories, apparently advanced to justify your statements to Mr. Russell before the article was published, the illegitimate relatives of Jesus, Moses, and Buddha have copyright and commercial likeness claims against the respective churches using their images or writings!\n\nAfter your scheme to squeeze some money from SRF failed in February when we had our \"DA conversation\", and after the DNA results conclusively excluded Yogananda, (remember our conversation where you thanked me for following blood retrieval procedures from the relatives which you said demonstrated \"honesty and \"integrity\" , you then went to Mr. Russell with your \"overwhelming legal claims\", creating the \"feeding frenzy\" you sought, rather than protecting the Erskines by having your \"overwhelming claims\" tested in Court. If you had, at least filed a frivolous suit, which even a non-lawyer knows would have been thrown out in 30 days, your clients' would have had some glimpse of protection from an extortion charge. But, as we both know , a frivolous filing would have have exposed YOU to liability as a lawyer. It doesn't surprise me that you chose to protect yourself rather than your clients while trying to squeeze money out of a church. Do you have a contingent fee agreement for 40% of the extorted proceeds? When your extortion letter was \"withdrawn\" (thereby withdrawing your \"overwhelming legal claims\" ) you requested me at the same time not to contact the DA. You and your clients both knew at that time that you would never get a nickel from SRF regardless of the DNA results. Do you now recall me informing you that there was \"no possibility\" that Yogananda was the father before the DNA test? You then turned to an unethical journalist in order to feed the \"frenzy\" you threatened. As you know, this is a violation of the canons of ethics. Apparently you and Mr. Russell have a lot in common.\n\nNow that you have admitted in writing that your client has, according to you, known about a potential claim all of his adult life, (ie \"during his upbringing\" according to your letter), including the period when Yogananda was alive (you should read the case law before you do someone else's bidding), you have essentially admitted that your \"overwhelming legal claims\" are barred by various statutes of limitations and laches. Thus, you have also admitted in writing an irrevocable conflict of interest between your client and yourself relating to your collusion with the New Times. Additionally, you have admitted to the fact of the SRF offer to bring over Biswanath Ghosh, and you have admitted to cooperating with Mr. Russell before accepting that offer and confirming the blood sample of Mr. Ghosh. You have also implicitly admitted that you informed Mr. Russell of the offer before either one of you confirmed the blood sample, instead opting for a \"media feeding frenzy\". In light of these admissions, I feel compelled to advise you to obtain counsel before writing any more letters, particularly in response to this letter, which, together with all of your previous correspondence will be offered as evidence. If you have professional liabilty insurance, please notify your carrier and have their lawyer contact me. If you choose to represent yourself, please advise immediately.\n\nAs I expected, you have sought to defend yourself and the defamatory story manufactured by you and Mr. Russell with an absurd position rather than admit the simple truth. I'm sure the jury in this matter will wisely consider the actions of an attorney on the defendant's side of the table, particularly one who gave the story to the media, disclosed client confidences, and who has exposed his clients to liability without first filing a case. Did you not file a case first because of the ethical obligations not to file frivolous cases? Now that you have solidified our case against you as an unreliable source, who chose to violate the ethical constraints imposed in our profession, as well as our case against New Times and Mr. Russell, and against your clients, the Erskines, please consider this latter to be a demand for a retraction pursuant to Cal. Civil Code § 48a.\n\nPursuant to said statute, this letter hereby incorporates my letter, and all attachments thereto, dated July 12, 2001, demanding a retraction from Mr. Russell and New Times. This letter specifically incorporates all references to yourself and to all members of the Erskine family cited in my foregoing July 12, 2001 letter and attachments; and this letter expressly demands a retraction for statements and innuendo attributable to you or any member of the Erskine family in what is referred to as the \"Russell article\" which suggest, state or imply, by innuendo, or otherwise, the following: (1) That Yogananda is the father of Ben Erskine. (2) That either you, or any member of the Erskine family, has ever held a \"good faith\" legal position (as defined under California and federal law governing the filing of pleadings) justifying the filing of a lawsuit for \"paternity\". (3) That either you or any member of the Erskine family possess any admissible evidence that Yogananda is the father of Erskine. This letter expressly demands that you retract the hearsay statements attributable to others in your July 12, 2001 letter, (ie, \"his family's repeated statements\" that Yogananda was the father) which you cite as \"proof\" of paternity, and which you have now \"published\". For purposes of section 48a, we deem your July 12, 2001 letter to be an admission and confirmation that you \"published\" all of the \"defamatory statements\" therein relating to SRF and Yogananda's paternity, as well as those attributable to myself, to Mr. Russell before the article was \"published\" , which he then \"republished\". (4) That either you or any member of the Erskine family have held a \"good faith\" belief as defined above that any member of the Erskine family possesses \"overwhelming legal claims\".\n\nAs you know, when I spoke to you after receipt of your \"extortion letter\", I told you that the only reason I had not gone straight to the DA was out of compassion for the Erskines, particularly given Melissa Simpson's criminal record, (remember that conversation?). You then agreed to \"withdraw\" the letter and the admittedly specious paternity claims referenced therein, in consideration of SRF not pursuing a claim for extortion, and in consideration of having Ben Erskine provide a blood sample. As you well know, the blood sample from Mr. Erskine was specifically demanded by SRF. Please consider this letter formal notice of your breach of that agreement. I note that you didn't address the issue of your \"withdrawing\" your \"media feeding frenzy\" letter in your July 12 letter. I will consider your silence on that point to be an admission. As you know, I left a message in your office on friday giving you a final opportunity to\"withdraw\" your letter of July 12, 2001 by noon on Friday, July 13, 2001. Subject to the provisions of Cal. Civil Code § 48a allowing you and/or New Times to publish a retraction in order to mitigate damages, that offer is withdrawn.\n\nPlease advise forthwith whether you will be represented by counsel in this matter, and also whether you will continue to represent the Erskine family. Since you will be a party and a witness in this matter with interests that obviously conflict with those of your client, I hereby advise you of your ethical obligations. In the event that the Erskine family or yourself seek a continuance of the trial of this matter on grounds of substitution or withdrawal of counsel, after the case has been filed on August 3, 2001, please be on notice that such a motion will be contested based, in part, on the notice given herein.\n\nFinally, this letter does not attempt to be a complete or exhaustive statement of Mr. Flynn's, SRF's, or its monastics' rights or claims against you, New Times, or the author of the article, nor do any of the statements contained herein constitute a waiver or relinquishment of any of their rights, or remedies, whether legal or equitable, all of which are expressly reserved.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFLYNN, SHERIDAN and TABB\n\nBy:_____________________\n\nMichael J.

Civil Code § 48a; ORS § 30.165; Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 41.336; MCLS §600.2911; and the general laws of Massachusetts and New York\n\nDear Publisher:\n\nPursuant to Cal. Civil Code § 48a, ORS § 30.165; Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 41.336; MCLS § 600.2911; and the general laws of Massachusetts, and New York, this letter shall constitute a demand for a retraction as specified in the attached letter, dated July 12, 2001 and attachments; the attached letter to Vanu Bagchi, dated July 19, 2001; the attached letter to Anil Nerode, dated July 19, 2001 and the attachment to said letter; and the attached letter to Shane Reed, Esq. dated July 16, 2001 and attachments. All of said letters and attachments are hereby expressly incorporated into this letter demanding a retraction pursuant to the statutes and general laws cited above.\n\nThis letter, together with all of the attachments, and more specifically, the underlined attachment to the Nerode letter, are being served on you in order to supplement the previous demands for a retraction of the Russell article. As noted in the Nerode letter, Mr. Nerode had previously posted a web-site containing malicious, false and defamatory statements of and concerning Self Realization Fellowship, its monastics and Paramahansa Yogananda. Notwithstanding the false and/or equivocal assertions in the Russell article that Mr. Nerode removed his web-site \"not because of pressure from attorney Michael Flynn\", there is written confirmation by Mr. Nerode that he removed the web-site specifically in response to a demand under California law by Mr. Flynn that the web-site be removed within 48 hours. Mr. Nerode, by his own written admission, was served with a demand for removal of the site on March 15, 2000 by means of a letter dated March 10, 2000. Mr. Nerode admits in writing on March 15, 2000 that he removed the web-site that same day, March 15, 2000, because of the letter from Michael Flynn. Additionally, in correspondence dated March 15 and 16, 2000, Mr. Nerode also made the following admissions regarding removal of the web-site: that he only had \"one half of the story\" from his mother; that she was elderly subject to failing memory; that he only had \"half the documents\", that his comments were \"only ... a draft not designed for external readers\"; that he knew there was another side to the story that he didn't have, that he has a \"high opinion of the way the fellowship has conducted its business\"; that the statements on the site were only \"collective memories\" of \"an elderly person\"; that in the future edits of his web-site he will be more objective when he gets all of the documents and the other half of the story; and that Mr. Nerode never professed any personal knowledge about Yogananda's personal life stating that he was \"simply relating facts and rumors as I heard them as a child.\"\n\nIn correspondence dated April 19, 2000 Mr. Flynn informed Mr. Nerode of the following:\n\n\"I have prepared a list of some of the documents in the possession of SRF which strongly refute the statements contained in your web-site, which statements are addressed in my March 10, 2000 letter. These documents are either in the handwriting of, or signed by your father and your mother. For example, in numerous letters and documents both your parents, express guilt and remorse for committing various \"wrongs\", \"sins\", \"breaches of faith\", \"infidelity\", \"affairs\", \"writing filthy letters\", \"cheating\", \"contemplating suicide\", having \"abortions\", etc. Etc. At the same time, both your parents write to Paramahansa Yogananda with highly laudatory expressions of loyalty, fidelity, love and admiration, including said expressions from your mother in a series of letters in 1936-37 that Yogananda is the epitome of a \"God-realized master\" exemplifying \"renunciation\", \"purity and bliss\". There are hundreds of such expressions contained in 12 years of correspondence, which refute the contents of your web-site.\"\n\nPlease be advised that on April 27, 2000, approximately eight days after receiving the foregoing letter from Mr. Flynn, and after being advised to prevent third persons from distributing the contents of his web-site, by faxed letter Mr. Nerode stated as follows:\n\n\"I will cooperate with you to use every legal means to force any party circulating this copyright draft material in any form. No one had permission to copy or distribute. In contacting third parties, I authorize you to represent me as well as SRF in eliminating this unauthorized distribution.\"\n\nThe republication by New Times of the Nerode web-site material, together with direct statements made to Mr. Russell, as set forth in the Nerode letter and its attachment, both of which are attached hereto and made a part hereof, constitutes actual malice. Pursuant to the foregoing statutes, SRF, its members and monastics and Michael Flynn hereby demand a retraction of the republished material as well as a retraction of the direct statements of Mr. Nerode. Pursuant to the authority vested in the undersigned by Mr. Nerode, as explicated above, I hereby demand on behalf of Mr. Nerode and on behalf of SRF, as directed by Mr. Nerode, that you cease and desist from all \"unauthorized distribution\" of the Russell article. In the language of Mr. Nerode, I am authorized to engage \"in eliminating this unauthorized distribution\".\n\nSincerely,\n\nFLYNN SHERIDAN & STILLMAN\n\nBy:____________________________\n\nMichael J.

It brings up some interesting points.\n\n________________________________________\n\nTo: Mr. Michael Lacey\n\nExecutive Editor\n\nRon Russell, Author\n\nLos Angeles New Times\n\n1950 Sawtelle Blvd. Suite 200\n\nLos Angeles, CA 90025\n\nRe: Los Angeles New Times Article dated July 5, 2001, \"The Devotee's Son\"\n\nDear Mr. Lacey and Mr. Russell:\n\nThis firm represents Self Realization Fellowship, (hereinafter \"SRF\" , monks and nuns within SRF, and one of its attorneys, Michael Flynn. On July 5, 2001, Los Angeles New Times, (hereinafter \"New Times\" , published a false and defamatory article concerning SRF founder, Paramahansa Yogananda, (deceased since 1952), SRF, monks and nuns within the organization, and Mr. Flynn, entitled, \"The Devotee's Son.\" This article is not only false, replete with overt lies and twisted half-truths, it represents an unconscionably malicious portrayal of one of the most revered men in the modern era. Writing forty-nine years after the death of Yogananda, the article's author, Ron Russell, knowingly \"attacks\" the reputation, dignity, and lifelong integrity of Yogananda, who is not alive to defend himself, and whose life, in truth, singularly represents the essence of all that is good, virtuous and loving in a human being. In contrast to the reality of Yogananda's life, the article is the shameful fabrication of an unethical journalist, and the deceitful product of New Times, a publication of which approximately 20% is dedicated to explicit pictorial ads for the porn industry.\n\nAs hereinafter demonstrated, Mr. Russell and New Times rushed the article to publication knowing that they could have easily and independently corroborated the subject blood test which definitively excludes the alleged paternity of Yogananda. Independent corroboration by New Times could have been achieved within a time frame of thirty-six hours, and months before the article was published at the simple cost of having the blood donor send an independent blood specimen, supervised by New Times, in a $36.00 Fed-Ex package. Although Mr. Russell had been working on the article for months prior to publication, and had been dealing with the Erskine family and their lawyer, Mr. Shane Reed, for at least four weeks prior to publication, at substantial cost to the New Times, (the phone bills alone exceeded the cost of a Fed-Ex package), Mr. Russell did not contact Mr. Flynn until June 22, 2001, just twelve days prior to publication. At that time, Mr. Russell specifically knew how to contact the donor through his own sources, namely Mr. Reed and J. Donald Walters (a.k.a. Kriyananda). Between June 22, 2001, when Mr. Russell spoke to Mr. Flynn, and Mr. Flynn offered to meet with Mr. Russell and his lawyer and his publisher in order to confirm the DNA results and corroborate the blood specimen, and July 5, 2001 when the article was published, Mr. Russell and New Times chose not to conduct this simple corroboration. Both Mr. Russell and his editors then knew that they would have had no story if the blood specimen was confirmed. Mr. Russell's agenda of deceit and \"attack\" in order to bootstrap his reputation as a writer, at the price of the reputation of a great man, would have been forever defeated because of the modern science of DNA. The plain truth of a DNA test would have left Mr. Russell and New Times with a big expense bill and no salacious material to attract their porn industry advertisers.\n\nThe article has not only been distributed throughout the Los Angeles area, the home of SRF, it has been published online worldwide. The article has caused irreparable damage to SRF, its monastics, its members and to Michael Flynn. Of even greater importance, the article damages the reputation and work of Yogananda, a man who dedicated his life to the upliftment of all mankind in a humane effort to ease human suffering. Mr. Russell's angry article only adds to the burden of such suffering.\n\nPursuant to California Civil Code Â§ 48a, this is a demand for a retraction/correction of the article. This demand includes a retraction of the primary theme of the article as set forth below. It also includes, but is not limited to, the false and defamatory statements which are recited in Attachment 1 to this letter and are incorporated herein.\n\nNew Times and Mr. Russell are undoubtedly aware, and probably relied upon the fact, that the laws involving libel preclude an action for libel by a decedent or his estate. Thus, you have fabricated a malicious and cowardly attack upon Paramahansa Yogananda, deceased since 1952. But the statements in the article attributable to Mr. Russell, and the statements Mr. Russell attributes to his sources, together with the innuendo manufactured by the article's false and defamatory themes of and concerning SRF, its monastics, and Michael Flynn constitute actionable defamation and libel under California and federal law. Neither Mr. Flynn nor the involved SRF monastics are public figures subject to the proof requirements for actual malice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and assuming either SRF, the organization, or the subject of the article invoke actual malice standards in part, as you know, malice can be proven in a libel case by evidence of the publisher's failure to do a proper investigation, by the publisher's reliance on sources known to be unreliable, by reliance on sources known to be biased against the plaintiff, by reliance on persons who are not in a position to possess personal knowledge, and by reliance on persons who have demonstrated anger and hostility to the plaintiff, among other factors. St Amant v. Thompson, 390 U.S. 727, 731-733 (196 ; Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, 388 U.S. 130 (1967); Reader's Digest Association, Inc. v. Sup. Ct., 37 Cal.3d 244; Fisher v. Larson, 138 Cal.App. 3d 627 (1982); Pep v. Newsweek, Inc. 553 F.Supp. 1000 (S.D.N.Y. 1983). Here, you have made serious accusations against Mr. Flynn and SRF, and no one from New Times even bothered to contact essential witnesses to verify the false statements in the article, particularly the most obvious and significant witness, Biswanath Ghosh, Yogananda's nephew, whose blood definitively defeats the primary theme of your entire article. This purposeful avoidance of the truth constitutes actual malice. See Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc. v. Connaughton, 491 U.S. 657, 682, 691-692 (1989); Vandenburg v. Newsweek, Inc., 441 F.2d 378, 380 (5th Cir), cert denied, 404 U.S. 864 (1971). Moreover, your inflammatory story line, and cover page entitled \"The Devotee's Son,\" bolsters an inference of actual malice. Id.; see also Duffy v. Leading Edge Products, Inc. 44 F.3d 308, 315 n. 10 (5th Cir. 1995); Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 680 F. 2d 527, 539 (7th Cir. 1982), cert denied, 459 U.S. 1226 (1983).\n\nThe primary and dominant theme of the article is that Paramahansa Yogananda engaged in an adulterous affair with a married woman resulting in the birth of an out of wedlock \"love child,\" Benjamin Erskine; and that SRF, its monastics and Mr. Flynn have engaged in a six-year coverup, even conspiring to falsify DNA test results. This theme is a total fabrication, manufactured and woven together by Mr. Russell from unreliable and/or biased sources, and motivated by Mr. Russell's long standing, malicious, repeated, and scandalous efforts to intentionally damage SRF and its defenders, including Mr. Flynn. Fortunately, Mr. Russell's malicious fabrication is easily defeated by the simple corroboration of Biswanath Ghosh's blood. The article's obvious purpose is to cause a reasonable person reading the article to believe and accept its false and defamatory theme. SRF and Mr. Flynn will adduce overwhelming evidence that a reasonable person is led to believe that Yogananda is an adulterer, and that SRF and Mr. Flynn have deceitfully manipulated this reported truth. Moreover, the alleged out of wedlock birth of Erskine in 1933 in the state of California constituted the specific violation of several criminal statutes. Thus, the theme of the article implies that SRF and Mr. Flynn have engaged in criminal conduct in colluding to conceal Yogananda's alleged crimes. As noted in the article, Mr. Flynn is an attorney representing SRF. Thus, the article's primary theme, its innuendo, coupled with the omission of key facts available to the author, all suggest, imply and state that Mr. Flynn engaged in illegal, unethical and criminal acts in his profession as an attorney, including the alteration of evidence. This, of course is libel per se.\n\nMr. Russell knew or should have known with even a minimum amount of investigation that the theme of the article was totally false. Mr. Flynn not only told Erskine that Yogananda could not possibly be Erskine's father, he also sent a letter to Mr. Russell offering to meet with him, his publisher and lawyer. A copy of this letter is attached hereto as Attachment 2. In writing and in a phone conversation, Mr. Flynn offered to produce specific documentation irrefutably proving the falsity of the theme of the article. Mr. Flynn even gave Mr. Russell his hotel number in Paris in order to set up a meeting. Mr. Flynn expressly informed Mr. Russell that SRF had offered Mr. Reed the option of flying Biswanath Ghosh, the nephew of Yogananda and blood donor, from India to the United States in order to verify the test results, and that Mr. Reed had never responded or challenged the results. Mr. Flynn made the same offer to Mr. Russell. Mr. Russell never responded. While Mr. Flynn was in Europe on business, without contacting any of the relatives who donated blood, without agreeing to independently verify the test results by the simple procedure of procuring new blood samples from Biswanath Ghosh, and by publishing the falsehood that Mr. Flynn \"deflected the matter by saying he had represented celebrities . . . ,\" Mr. Russell maliciously manufactured the falsehood that Mr. Flynn and SRF had conspired to alter the test results and thereby conceal the \"truth\" of Yogananda's paternity. Fundamental ethics of journalism required Mr. Russell to contact the definitive source for the article, Mr. Biswanath Ghosh. Although Mr. Russell knew this fundamental ethical requirement, he pushed the story to publication intentionally and maliciously disregarding the truth in order to defame SRF and make money for New Times by increasing its free circulation and thereby attract more advertisers, particularly those in the porn industry. The editors of New Times are able to measure their profits based on the tabloid sensationalism of its articles, particularly articles that pander to the taste of a prurient reader likely to respond to the ads of its porn customers. If Mr. Russell and the editors of New Times had conducted even a cursory investigation designed to ferret out truth rather than fatten profits, they would have discovered at least the following.\n\nMr. Russell knew or should have known that his primary sources, members of the Erskine family, at least two of whom have been convicted of various felonies, have engaged in specific acts of extortion seeking to obtain money from SRF by threat of exposure of the false claim of Yogananda's alleged paternity. Indeed, Mr. Russell quotes one of Erskine's adult children in his article, who has been charged with at least nine separate felonies, has been a habitual heroin addict on probation, and who has served time in prison, as one of his sources. This individual traveled to Los Angeles, went to SRF headquarters on Mt. Washington, and expressly attempted to extort money from Mr. Flynn and SRF under threat of \"going to the press.\" Acting solely out of compassion for this person, the SRF leadership chose not to file criminal charges. Yet Mr. Russell, using this unfortunate person as his unwitting dupe and primary source, paints a picture of her in his article as an innocent child of an innocent victim, her father, Ben Erskine, both of whom Mr. Russell suggests were ignored and abused - the daughter by an SRF monastic, \"Mukti Mata,\" ( who is perhaps one of the kindest, gentlest human beings on earth), and the father by SRF's attorney, Mr. Flynn.\n\nHowever, Mr. Russell did not even have to undertake the most cursory investigation of the Erskine family in order to conclude that SRF was the target of an overt extortion attempt. Before contacting the Erskines, Russell had long utilized Ananda and Kriyananda, both of whom are well publicized antagonists of SRF, as his primary sources. In his article, Russell unwittingly admits (perhaps because of his blinding bias) to have seen or been informed of a letter sent by Shane Reed, Erskine's lawyer, a copy of which is attached as Attachment 3 hereto, in which Mr. Reed seeks a \"financial settlement\" from SRF under threat of initiating \"a paternity suit and undertake responsibility and control over such matters as the interment dispute.\" In his article and in past articles, Mr. Russell viciously attacks SRF in connection with the \"interment dispute\" using, inter alia, Ananda and Kriyananda as his primary sources. Mr. Russell knew that these sources were highly suspect both because of their bias and because of Kriyananda's character and veracity deficiencies. Ananda and Kriyananda (who have been adjudged liable for tortious conduct involving sexual molestation of numerous women and for fraud) have long held demonstrably biased and antagonistic positions to SRF, including the \"interment dispute.\" The actual collusion between Mr. Russell, a biased writer, the Erskine family, using their daughter, a convicted heroin addict seeking money for a frivolous paternity claim against SRF, a non-profit corporation physically and legally incapable of paternity, and Kriyananda, an adjudicated fraud, presents compelling proof of actual malice and reliance on discredited sources.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Russell omits from the article that Mr. Flynn informed Mr. Reed, within days of receiving the attached letter, that the letter constituted criminal extortion because SRF, as a religious organization, obviously could not be anyone's \"father\" or legally responsible to a 68 year old adult, Erskine, for \"paternity\"(citing the recent Erin Brockovich extortion convictions); and that the threat of undertaking \"control\" over the \"interment dispute\" in order to obtain money constituted extortion. Mr. Russell omits from the article that Mr. Reed stated in response that he was \"withdrawing\" the letter and asked Mr. Flynn not to report the matter to the District Attorney. Mr. Russell fails to state in the article: that Mr. Reed acknowledged that the Erskines were \"poor\"; could not afford any costs for DNA testing; could not afford any civil litigation; had no actual legal claims against SRF because Erskine was an adult and Yogananda was deceased; that \"others outside the family\"were interested in the \"interment dispute\"; that the Erskine family had no real interest in the \"interment dispute\"; that the family wanted money, that he didn't know what others wanted, and that the family had no proof of the alleged paternity. When informed by Mr. Flynn that evidence established that Yogananda could not have been the father because he was in Kansas City during the period of conception, that individuals still alive who knew Yogananda would consider the claim ludicrous, and that SRF would never submit to extortion, Mr. Reed agreed that although no legal claim existed, in order to resolve the historical record and to achieve peace of mind for the Erskine family, and at SRF's express request, Ben Erskine would provide a blood sample for DNA testing. Mr. Flynn gratuitously offered to have SRF pay for independent DNA testing using blood samples taken from the children of Yogananda's deceased siblings. Mr. Reed was informed of and expressly agreed to all of the protocols and procedures used to accomplish the blood extraction, including specific agreement to use an SRF monastic of the highest integrity to go to India and convince Biswanath Ghosh and other children of siblings to provide blood in the presence of a certified pathologist with specifically identifiable, sealed vials of blood samples which were then Fed-Exed directly to a lab mutually agreed upon by both Mr. Reed and SRF.\n\nAttached hereto as Attachment 4 are the following documents all of which were sent to Mr. Reed: the \"family tree\" of Yogananda, identifying the blood donors; certifications of identity, addresses, and voluntary blood withdrawal from the three blood donor-relatives; declarations and certifications of the Medical Doctor-pathologist attesting to the withdrawal procedures; the Fed-Ex waybill and tracking no. sending the sealed blood vials to the lab; the packaging certification and invoice of the sealed blood vials; and the cover letter of the SRF monastic. Mr. Reed provided all of the foregoing to Mr. Russell prior to publication, including the letter of the monastic; and Mr. Russell has distorted or overtly misrepresented the propriety of the protocols and procedures involving the blood withdrawal and transfer. Mr. Russell on his own has simply fabricated an \"attack\" on Mr. Flynn, on the involved monastic, and on the blood-donor protocols, in order to manufacture a story against Yogananda. His conduct represents the epitome of journalistic deceit designed to make a name for himself at the expense of destroying the reputation of a great and revered man not able to confront him with the truth. Punitive damages equal to the magnitude of such perfidy will be sought in order to dissuade Mr. Russell and similar muckrackers from engaging in such future conduct.\n\nAfter the testing conclusively excluded Yogananda, (see the test results from \"Genetic Technologies attached hereto as Attachment 5), Mr. Flynn even offered to bring Biswanath Ghosh to the U.S., but Mr. Reed declined. Mr. Reed had confirmed through his own sources including Ananda, who was in litigation with SRF, that the blood procurement process was legitimate. To this day, Mr. Reed has never challenged the results, nor has any other member of the Erskine family. Mr. Russell has manufactured a claim on behalf of the Erskines and manufactured a false and defamatory story. Had Mr. Russell consulted with an attorney prior to publication, he would have learned that no legal claim for paternity exists against SRF or Yogananda. Had Mr. Russell simply arranged for the corroboration of Biswanath Ghosh's blood sample he would have had no story. Thus, we deem that Mr. Russell's effort to advance such a claim on behalf of the Erskines, having knowledge of the extortionate conduct of the Erskines, makes him a party to the extortion. Included in the defamation and libel action will be claims for Mr. Russell's collusion with the Erskine family seeking to extort money from SRF under threat of publishing the false and defamatory paternity allegations.\n\nPlease be advised that suit will be brought on these matters on August 3, 2001 seeking compensatory and punitive damages. It is recommended that Mr. Russell and the Los Angeles New Times publish a full front page retraction and apology with the signature of Mr. Russell attesting to the falsehood of the story and subject to language to be approved by Mr. Flynn and SRF. Such an apology and retraction will serve to minimize the damages already incurred in this matter. Please be further advised that SRF and Mr. Flynn intend to bring Biswanath Ghosh, Yogananda's nephew, to Los Angeles for a videotaped deposition and blood extraction to take place on September 10, 2001.\n\nWe are herewith providing you with advance notice of the subject deposition because Mr. Ghosh must travel from India and it is imperative that SRF provide the results of this deposition and corroboration of Mr. Ghosh's blood sample to its members throughout the world in order to mitigate further damages caused by the article. Notice of said deposition shall be served with the complaint.\n\nPlease be further advised not to destroy, alter or corrupt any of the evidence in this matter, including the notes and any audio tapes made by Mr. Russell, particularly tapes made in violation of Cal. Penal Code Â§ 632.\n\nFinally, Mr. Russell and the New Times have acquired a reputation as having an \"attack\" style of journalism, publishing anything false, scandalous and defamatory in order to increase its advertising revenues. This particular style of journalism, lacking balance, fairness and truth, has been rejected by legitimate journalists and it has resulted in numerous, large jury verdicts against publications such as New Times. We note that Mr. Russell and the New Times have previously published two false and defamatory \"attack\" articles against SRF. We also note that Ananda and Kriyananda, two of Mr. Russell's sources, have advertised in the New Times on the page facing the page on which Mr. Russell's article appears. Please be advised that SRF intends to use the previous articles authored by Mr. Russell, his improper reliance on Kriyananda and Ananda as sources and the \"attack\" style of New Times for purposes of establishing punitive damages in this matter. Pursuant to Cal. Civil Code Â§ 48a, SRF and Michael Flynn hereby demand a retraction, apology and admission of improper reliance on Ananda and Kriyananda, subject to language to be approved by SRF and Mr. Flynn.\n\nThis letter does not attempt to be a complete or exhaustive statement of Mr. Flynn's, SRF's, or its monastics', rights or claims against you or the author of the article, nor do any of the statements contained herein constitute a waiver or relinquishment of any of their rights or remedies, whether legal or equitable, all of which are expressly reserved.\n\nVery Truly Yours,\n\nFLYNN, SHERIDAN & STILLMAN\n\nBy:\n\nMichael J.

It too brings up some interesting points.\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nJuly 13, 2001\n\nMr. Shane A. Reed, Esquire\n\nP.O. Box 452\n\nJacksonville, OR 97530\n\nDear Mr. Reed:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter dated July 12, 2001. It is unclear whether it was written to protect yourself from liabilty, which you have now admitted, or at the behest of New Times, or of Mr. Russell, with whom you have now admitted your complicity. It is clear that it was not written to protect the Erskines. It is also clear that you have chosen to distort, if not misrepresent, our several conversations, particularly those following your now infamous \"media feeding frenzy\" letter. You will recall in that letter that you were seeking a \"financial settlement\" from SRF in order to avoid a \"media feeding frenzy\" over a \"paternity' claim against SRF , or was it for a claim against a man who has been dead for 49 years!\n\nWith your now admitted collusion with the New Times, you have fulfilled what you and your clients, including Melissa Simpson, (while on probation), both threatened in order to extort money from a non-profit church. You have spawned a \"media feeding frenzy\"; and you have further exacerbated it with your recent letter attempting to justify \"overwhelming legal claims\" that have not only been been statutorily barred, by your own admission, for at least 49 years, but have no basis in fact or law. According to your most recently concocted theories, apparently advanced to justify your statements to Mr. Russell before the article was published, the illegitimate relatives of Jesus, Moses, and Buddha have copyright and commercial likeness claims against the respective churches using their images or writings!\n\nAfter your scheme to squeeze some money from SRF failed in February when we had our \"DA conversation\", and after the DNA results conclusively excluded Yogananda, (remember our conversation where you thanked me for following blood retrieval procedures from the relatives which you said demonstrated \"honesty and \"integrity\" , you then went to Mr. Russell with your \"overwhelming legal claims\", creating the \"feeding frenzy\" you sought, rather than protecting the Erskines by having your \"overwhelming claims\" tested in Court. If you had, at least filed a frivolous suit, which even a non-lawyer knows would have been thrown out in 30 days, your clients' would have had some glimpse of protection from an extortion charge. But, as we both know , a frivolous filing would have have exposed YOU to liability as a lawyer. It doesn't surprise me that you chose to protect yourself rather than your clients while trying to squeeze money out of a church. Do you have a contingent fee agreement for 40% of the extorted proceeds? When your extortion letter was \"withdrawn\" (thereby withdrawing your \"overwhelming legal claims\" ) you requested me at the same time not to contact the DA. You and your clients both knew at that time that you would never get a nickel from SRF regardless of the DNA results. Do you now recall me informing you that there was \"no possibility\" that Yogananda was the father before the DNA test? You then turned to an unethical journalist in order to feed the \"frenzy\" you threatened. As you know, this is a violation of the canons of ethics. Apparently you and Mr. Russell have a lot in common.\n\nNow that you have admitted in writing that your client has, according to you, known about a potential claim all of his adult life, (ie \"during his upbringing\" according to your letter), including the period when Yogananda was alive (you should read the case law before you do someone else's bidding), you have essentially admitted that your \"overwhelming legal claims\" are barred by various statutes of limitations and laches. Thus, you have also admitted in writing an irrevocable conflict of interest between your client and yourself relating to your collusion with the New Times. Additionally, you have admitted to the fact of the SRF offer to bring over Biswanath Ghosh, and you have admitted to cooperating with Mr. Russell before accepting that offer and confirming the blood sample of Mr. Ghosh. You have also implicitly admitted that you informed Mr. Russell of the offer before either one of you confirmed the blood sample, instead opting for a \"media feeding frenzy\". In light of these admissions, I feel compelled to advise you to obtain counsel before writing any more letters, particularly in response to this letter, which, together with all of your previous correspondence will be offered as evidence. If you have professional liabilty insurance, please notify your carrier and have their lawyer contact me. If you choose to represent yourself, please advise immediately.\n\nAs I expected, you have sought to defend yourself and the defamatory story manufactured by you and Mr. Russell with an absurd position rather than admit the simple truth. I'm sure the jury in this matter will wisely consider the actions of an attorney on the defendant's side of the table, particularly one who gave the story to the media, disclosed client confidences, and who has exposed his clients to liability without first filing a case. Did you not file a case first because of the ethical obligations not to file frivolous cases? Now that you have solidified our case against you as an unreliable source, who chose to violate the ethical constraints imposed in our profession, as well as our case against New Times and Mr. Russell, and against your clients, the Erskines, please consider this latter to be a demand for a retraction pursuant to Cal. Civil Code § 48a.\n\nPursuant to said statute, this letter hereby incorporates my letter, and all attachments thereto, dated July 12, 2001, demanding a retraction from Mr. Russell and New Times. This letter specifically incorporates all references to yourself and to all members of the Erskine family cited in my foregoing July 12, 2001 letter and attachments; and this letter expressly demands a retraction for statements and innuendo attributable to you or any member of the Erskine family in what is referred to as the \"Russell article\" which suggest, state or imply, by innuendo, or otherwise, the following: (1) That Yogananda is the father of Ben Erskine. (2) That either you, or any member of the Erskine family, has ever held a \"good faith\" legal position (as defined under California and federal law governing the filing of pleadings) justifying the filing of a lawsuit for \"paternity\". (3) That either you or any member of the Erskine family possess any admissible evidence that Yogananda is the father of Erskine. This letter expressly demands that you retract the hearsay statements attributable to others in your July 12, 2001 letter, (ie, \"his family's repeated statements\" that Yogananda was the father) which you cite as \"proof\" of paternity, and which you have now \"published\". For purposes of section 48a, we deem your July 12, 2001 letter to be an admission and confirmation that you \"published\" all of the \"defamatory statements\" therein relating to SRF and Yogananda's paternity, as well as those attributable to myself, to Mr. Russell before the article was \"published\" , which he then \"republished\". (4) That either you or any member of the Erskine family have held a \"good faith\" belief as defined above that any member of the Erskine family possesses \"overwhelming legal claims\".\n\nAs you know, when I spoke to you after receipt of your \"extortion letter\", I told you that the only reason I had not gone straight to the DA was out of compassion for the Erskines, particularly given Melissa Simpson's criminal record, (remember that conversation?). You then agreed to \"withdraw\" the letter and the admittedly specious paternity claims referenced therein, in consideration of SRF not pursuing a claim for extortion, and in consideration of having Ben Erskine provide a blood sample. As you well know, the blood sample from Mr. Erskine was specifically demanded by SRF. Please consider this letter formal notice of your breach of that agreement. I note that you didn't address the issue of your \"withdrawing\" your \"media feeding frenzy\" letter in your July 12 letter. I will consider your silence on that point to be an admission. As you know, I left a message in your office on friday giving you a final opportunity to\"withdraw\" your letter of July 12, 2001 by noon on Friday, July 13, 2001. Subject to the provisions of Cal. Civil Code § 48a allowing you and/or New Times to publish a retraction in order to mitigate damages, that offer is withdrawn.\n\nPlease advise forthwith whether you will be represented by counsel in this matter, and also whether you will continue to represent the Erskine family. Since you will be a party and a witness in this matter with interests that obviously conflict with those of your client, I hereby advise you of your ethical obligations. In the event that the Erskine family or yourself seek a continuance of the trial of this matter on grounds of substitution or withdrawal of counsel, after the case has been filed on August 3, 2001, please be on notice that such a motion will be contested based, in part, on the notice given herein.\n\nFinally, this letter does not attempt to be a complete or exhaustive statement of Mr. Flynn's, SRF's, or its monastics' rights or claims against you, New Times, or the author of the article, nor do any of the statements contained herein constitute a waiver or relinquishment of any of their rights, or remedies, whether legal or equitable, all of which are expressly reserved.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFLYNN, SHERIDAN and TABB\n\nBy:_____________________\n\nMichael J.

Civil Code § 48a; ORS § 30.165; Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 41.336; MCLS §600.2911; and the general laws of Massachusetts and New York\n\nDear Publisher:\n\nPursuant to Cal. Civil Code § 48a, ORS § 30.165; Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 41.336; MCLS § 600.2911; and the general laws of Massachusetts, and New York, this letter shall constitute a demand for a retraction as specified in the attached letter, dated July 12, 2001 and attachments; the attached letter to Vanu Bagchi, dated July 19, 2001; the attached letter to Anil Nerode, dated July 19, 2001 and the attachment to said letter; and the attached letter to Shane Reed, Esq. dated July 16, 2001 and attachments. All of said letters and attachments are hereby expressly incorporated into this letter demanding a retraction pursuant to the statutes and general laws cited above.\n\nThis letter, together with all of the attachments, and more specifically, the underlined attachment to the Nerode letter, are being served on you in order to supplement the previous demands for a retraction of the Russell article. As noted in the Nerode letter, Mr. Nerode had previously posted a web-site containing malicious, false and defamatory statements of and concerning Self Realization Fellowship, its monastics and Paramahansa Yogananda. Notwithstanding the false and/or equivocal assertions in the Russell article that Mr. Nerode removed his web-site \"not because of pressure from attorney Michael Flynn\", there is written confirmation by Mr. Nerode that he removed the web-site specifically in response to a demand under California law by Mr. Flynn that the web-site be removed within 48 hours. Mr. Nerode, by his own written admission, was served with a demand for removal of the site on March 15, 2000 by means of a letter dated March 10, 2000. Mr. Nerode admits in writing on March 15, 2000 that he removed the web-site that same day, March 15, 2000, because of the letter from Michael Flynn. Additionally, in correspondence dated March 15 and 16, 2000, Mr. Nerode also made the following admissions regarding removal of the web-site: that he only had \"one half of the story\" from his mother; that she was elderly subject to failing memory; that he only had \"half the documents\", that his comments were \"only ... a draft not designed for external readers\"; that he knew there was another side to the story that he didn't have, that he has a \"high opinion of the way the fellowship has conducted its business\"; that the statements on the site were only \"collective memories\" of \"an elderly person\"; that in the future edits of his web-site he will be more objective when he gets all of the documents and the other half of the story; and that Mr. Nerode never professed any personal knowledge about Yogananda's personal life stating that he was \"simply relating facts and rumors as I heard them as a child.\"\n\nIn correspondence dated April 19, 2000 Mr. Flynn informed Mr. Nerode of the following:\n\n\"I have prepared a list of some of the documents in the possession of SRF which strongly refute the statements contained in your web-site, which statements are addressed in my March 10, 2000 letter. These documents are either in the handwriting of, or signed by your father and your mother. For example, in numerous letters and documents both your parents, express guilt and remorse for committing various \"wrongs\", \"sins\", \"breaches of faith\", \"infidelity\", \"affairs\", \"writing filthy letters\", \"cheating\", \"contemplating suicide\", having \"abortions\", etc. Etc. At the same time, both your parents write to Paramahansa Yogananda with highly laudatory expressions of loyalty, fidelity, love and admiration, including said expressions from your mother in a series of letters in 1936-37 that Yogananda is the epitome of a \"God-realized master\" exemplifying \"renunciation\", \"purity and bliss\". There are hundreds of such expressions contained in 12 years of correspondence, which refute the contents of your web-site.\"\n\nPlease be advised that on April 27, 2000, approximately eight days after receiving the foregoing letter from Mr. Flynn, and after being advised to prevent third persons from distributing the contents of his web-site, by faxed letter Mr. Nerode stated as follows:\n\n\"I will cooperate with you to use every legal means to force any party circulating this copyright draft material in any form. No one had permission to copy or distribute. In contacting third parties, I authorize you to represent me as well as SRF in eliminating this unauthorized distribution.\"\n\nThe republication by New Times of the Nerode web-site material, together with direct statements made to Mr. Russell, as set forth in the Nerode letter and its attachment, both of which are attached hereto and made a part hereof, constitutes actual malice. Pursuant to the foregoing statutes, SRF, its members and monastics and Michael Flynn hereby demand a retraction of the republished material as well as a retraction of the direct statements of Mr. Nerode. Pursuant to the authority vested in the undersigned by Mr. Nerode, as explicated above, I hereby demand on behalf of Mr. Nerode and on behalf of SRF, as directed by Mr. Nerode, that you cease and desist from all \"unauthorized distribution\" of the Russell article. In the language of Mr. Nerode, I am authorized to engage \"in eliminating this unauthorized distribution\".\n\nSincerely,\n\nFLYNN SHERIDAN & STILLMAN\n\nBy:____________________________\n\nMichael J.
