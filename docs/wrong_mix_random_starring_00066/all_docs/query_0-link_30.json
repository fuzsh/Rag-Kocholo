The Chivas brand's home is Strathisla Distillery at Keith, Moray in Speyside, Scotland. Colin Scott is the Master Blender. Chivas Regal is the flagship Scotch whisky brand of Chivas Brothers.

The new generation of Scotch drinkers is particularly attracted to single malts and deluxe/super premium blends – products 12 years or older. Over the last 10 years, the compound average growth rate for Super Premium Scotch has topped 13%. 2.Ethnicity– Consumption among ethnic groups is rising dramatically – particularly among Hispanic and Asian consumers. Hispanics segment is growing faster than the General Market. 3.Younger Consumer Profile – The traditional Scotch drinker tends to be male, professional and Caucasian in the 50+ age group. The new generation is likely to discover scotch in their mid to late twenties. * Whisky Magazine’s theory is that as today’s white spirits drinkers rejected Whisky because it was their father’s drink, so their children will turn back.
