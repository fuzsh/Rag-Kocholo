Treatment with Adjunctive Aripiprazole Results in Significant Improvement Compared with Continued Antidepressant Monotherapy in Patients with Mild, Moderate, and Severe Major Depressive Disorder\n\nJ Craig. Nelson*, Thomas D. Stewart, Ainslie Hatch, Kimberly Largay, Elizabeth E. Bellochio, Sabrina V. Marler, Ross A. Baker, John Sheehan, Robert M. Berman\n\nUniversity of California, San Francisco, California\n\nBackground: The severity of a patient's depressive symptoms may inform treatment decisions. However, current treatment guidelines are based on trial data that group patients of varying degrees of severity together. To better understand the appropriate patient for adjunctive aripiprazole in major depressive disorder (MDD), this post-hoc analysis pooled data from 3 similar, randomized trials,1,2 and stratified patients based on published severity cut-offs on the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).3\n\nMethods: These trials enrolled patients with an inadequate response to 1-3 trials of antidepressant therapy (ADT). Each study had an 8-week prospective ADT phase (Phase B), followed by a 6-week randomized phase (Phase C) of adjunctive aripiprazole versus continued antidepressant monotherapy + placebo for patients with an inadequate response during the prospective phase. Inadequate response to ADT monotherapy was defined as <50% reduction in the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) total score, HAM-D-17 total score ⩾14, and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) score ⩾3. For this post-hoc analysis, patients were stratified at the beginning of Phase C by MADRS total score into 3 groups: mild (MADRS total score ⩽24), moderate (MADRS total score=25-30), and severe (MADRS total score ⩾31). During Phase C, aripiprazole was flexibly dosed with a target of 10 mg/day. Patients were initiated at 5 mg/day (could decrease to 2 mg/day for tolerability) and increased to 10 mg/day (could decrease to 5 mg/day for tolerability) at the end of Week 1; the maximum dose was 20 mg/day. Change in MADRS total score for adjunctive aripiprazole and adjunctive placebo was assessed at the end of 6 weeks using last observation carried forward (LOCF).\n\nResults: Baseline demographics across the three groups appeared similar. At the beginning of Phase C, in the aripiprazole group, 224 (41%), 206 (38%), and 110 (20%) patients were considered mild, moderate, or severe, respectively; in the placebo group, it was 191 (36%), 179 (34%), and 155 (30%) patients, respectively. At the end of 6 weeks, mean changes in MADRS total score between aripiprazole and placebo were significantly different in all three severity groups: mild −7.9 aripiprazole vs. −5.4 placebo (P=0.0005); moderate −9.5 aripiprazole vs. −6.3 placebo (P=0.0001); severe −11.9 aripiprazole vs. −7.4 placebo (P=0.0001). Statistically significantly differences between aripiprazole and placebo first appeared at Week 1 (mild or severe) or Week 2 (moderate). In all three groups, the endpoint effect size of aripiprazole treatment was moderate (0.334-0.483). Similarly, mean percent improvement in MADRS total score between aripiprazole and placebo were significantly different in all three severity groups: mild -38% aripiprazole vs. -26% placebo (P=0.0008); moderate -35% aripiprazole vs. -23% placebo (P=0.0001); severe -35% aripiprazole vs.=22% placebo (P=0.0002). Adjunctive aripiprazole was well tolerated across the severity groups, with no trends in the proportion of patients reporting an adverse event (AE) based on severity; the most common AEs in the aripiprazole-treated groups were akathisia and restlessness.\n\nConclusions: In this pooled analysis, adjunctive aripiprazole resulted in significantly greater symptom improvement than placebo regardless of baseline severity. Change scores appeared greatest in the severe group but this may reflect the truncated range in the mild group. The greater response with adjunctive aripiprazole demonstrates the utility of this strategy to manage depression in a wide spectrum of patients.\n\nReferences 1. Thase ME, et al.

Genomic Predictors of Response to Antidepressant Treatment in Geriatric Depression Using Genome-wide Expression Analyses: A Pilot Study\n\nHelen Lavretsky*, Ascia Eskin, Stanley Nelson, Steve Cole\n\nUCLA, Los Angeles, California\n\nBackground: Depression and antidepressant response are associated with leukocyte gene transcriptional alterations. The present pilot study examined immune cell gene expression with antidepressant treatment in geriatric depression.\n\nMethods: Genome-wide transcriptional profiles were collected from peripheral blood leukocytes sampled at baseline and 16-week follow-up from 37 older adults with major depression who were randomized to methylphenidate+citalopram; citalopram+ placebo; or methylphenidate+placebo. Methylphenidate dose ranged between 10-40 mg per day, and citalopram dose was 20-40 mg per day. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling was carried out in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples obtained at baseline and post-intervention. Promoter-based bioinformatics analyses tested the hypothesis that observed transcriptional alterations were structured by transcription factors implicated in dopaminergic, serotonergic, and neuroplastic pathways.\n\nResults: 25 responder and 12 non-responders gene expression profiles were analyzedIn the analyses of covariance controlling for treatment group, 2 gene transcripts showed systematic up-regulation in non-responders at baseline. Up-regulated genes at baseline in non-responders compared to non-responders included 1) CA1 carbonic anhydrase gene on chromosome 8 involved in reversible hydration of CO2 and respiratory function (fold change 2.54; P=0.03); 2) SNCA -alpha-synuclein gene implicated in Parkinson's disease that binds to dopamine transporter (fold change 2.1; P=0.03). Additionally, promoter-based bioinformatic analysis of genes found to be upregulated by 1.2-fold indicated a reduction in CREB activity in responders versus non-responders over time in the entire sample and in the subgroup taking methylphenidate and placebo (both p<.0001, or Bonferroni-corrected p<.05).\n\nConclusions: The present results suggest a unique transcriptional signature in responders and non-responders to antidepressant treatment in the dopaminergic and metabolic pathways important for neurolplasticity and brain aging. Response to treatment in the overall sample and to methylphenidate was associated with a reduction in CREB activity in responders versus non-responders. Our results are novel in identifying potential biomarkers of response/nonresponse to an antidepressant treatment in geriatric depression, but will need to be replicated in larger samples with the use of additional specific biomarkers of the identified pathways.\n\nKeywords: Genomic, microarrays, predicotrs of treatment response, antidperessant, gelriatric depression\n\nDisclosure: H.

The Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor, Rivastigmine, but not Huperzine A, Improves Verbal Learning/Episodic Memory and Working Memory in Cocaine-dependent Volunteers\n\nJames Joseph. Mahoney*, Ari Kalechstein, Thomas Newton, Ryan Bennett, Nicholas Arnoudse, Richard De La Garza\n\nBaylor College of Medicine, Pearland, Texas\n\nBackground: Long-term, high-dose cocaine use is a risk factor for the onset of neurocognitive impairment in humans. In a recent meta-analytic review of 15 studies that included 586 matched controls and 481 abstinent cocaine users, effect sizes of moderate or greater magnitude for attention, episodic memory, and working memory were reported (Jovanovski, 2005). These neurocognitive impairments have important implications with respect to day-to-day functioning; for example, the presence of cocaine-associated neurocognitive impairment is associated with poor treatment retention/increased treatment dropout. Not surprising, cocaine-associated neurocognitive impairment has been identified as an important target of treatment, and medications such as modafinil have demonstrated an indication vis-à-vis improvement on measures of working memory. Thus, given that cocaine—associated neurocognitive impairment is potentially amenable to treatment, this study sought to determine whether the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors rivastigmine or huperzine A could improve neurocognitive performance in cocaine-dependent individuals.\n\nMethods: Seventy two cocaine-dependent individuals who were not seeking treatment at the time of enrollment in the study were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n=15), rivastigmine 3 mg (n=14), rivastigmine 6 mg (n=14), huperzine A 0.4 mg (n=15), or huperzine A 0.8 mg (n=14). Urinanalysis was used to confirm abstinence from cocaine on the day of admission and during the next 7 days. The baseline neurocognitive assessment, which included measures of attention/information processing (as measured by the Continuous Performance Task), verbal learning episodic memory (as measured by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test), and working memory (as measured by the Dual N-Back Task), was conducted immediately after the washout phase and prior to the administration of study medication (Day 0). The follow-up assessment was conducted on Day 8 after participants had received rivastigmine, huperzine A, or placebo for seven days (Day 2-8).\n\nResults: Enrolled participants were primarily African-American, ∼41 years old, had ∼12 years of education, used cocaine for ∼16 years and ∼17 out of the last 30 days, and used ∼2 grams of cocaine per day via the smoked route of administration. Rivastigmine administration (6 mg) significantly improved performance on two measures of working memory span (mean n-back span, maximum n-back span) and improved performance on a verbal learning and memory task (HVLT total recall). Those participants randomized to 6 mg rivastigmine had significantly higher mean n-back span (1.91±.12; Mean±SEM) when compared to those randomized to placebo (1.55±0.12; p<0.02). In addition, those participants randomized to 6 mg rivastigmine had significantly higher max n-back span (2.64±0.19) when compared to those randomized to placebo (2.07±.18; p<0.03). Furthermore, those participants randomized to 6 mg rivastigmine had significantly higher scaled total verbal learning HVLT scores (42.14±2.45) when compared to those randomized to placebo (31.73±2.37; p<0.001). There were no differences between rivastigmine and placebo groups on measures of sustained attention/information processing and huperzine A did not modulate performance on measures of information processing speed, verbal learning/ episodic memory, or working memory.\n\nConclusions: This study provides additional data showing that cocaine-associated neurocognitive impairment, in a sample of long-term, high-dose cocaine users, can be remediated. Additionally, while this confirms that working memory impairments are amenable to treatment, this is to our knowledge, the first study to show that cocaine-associated memory impairment can be treated. These effects are likely relevant in the treatment of cocaine dependence, in which the remediation of impaired verbal learning, episodic, and working memory may be associated with improved treatment outcomes.\n\nKeywords: cocaine; acetylcholinesterase inhibitor; neurocognition; verbal learning; working memory\n\nDisclosure: J.

Treatment of Depression with Botulinum Toxin A: A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo Controlled Trial\n\nEric Finzi*, Norman Rosenthal\n\nChevy Chase Cosmetic Center, Chevy Chase, Maryland\n\nBackground: In spite of advances in our understanding and treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), many patients fail to achieve remission. Recently, it has been proposed that inhibition of frowning could be used as a treatment for MDD (Finzi et al., 2006). Preliminary studies have suggested that botulinum toxin treatment of frown muscles may help depression (Finzi et al., 2006, Wollmer et al., 2012). The corrugator (frown) muscle plays an essential role in the facial expressions of anger and sadness. Charles Darwin first suggested that muscle contractions involved in the formation of facial expressions contribute to emotional states and mood; William James elaborated on this concept, which has been confirmed experimentally, and is now known as the facial feedback hypothesis. Darwin also recognized that severely depressed individuals show corrugator muscle overactivity, which may result in the “omega sign.” Botulinum toxin (BT) reversibly inhibits muscle contraction. When injected into the glabellar region, BT reversibly inhibits frowning for about three months. We have conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of BT injection into the glabellar region as a treatment for MDD.\n\nMethods: The study was IRB approved, and informed consent was given by all subjects. Male or female outpatients aged 18 to 65 years, with MDD, as diagnosed by the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis I DSM-IV Disorders (SCID), were eligible. Subjects were required to have a Montgomery-Asberg (MADRS) score ⩾ 26 and a Clinical Global Impression – Severity (CGI) score ⩾ 4 at screening Eligible subjects were randomly assigned at screening to receive either onabotulinumtoxinA(OBA) (Botox Cosmetic, Allergan) or placebo(PLB) (0.9%NaCl) injections in the glabellar region(Finzi et al., 2006). Women received 29 U of OBA and men, 40 U. All patients were assessed at randomization and after 3 and 6 weeks with the MADRS, Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI) and CGI. The primary outcome measure was response to treatment, as defined as a ⩾ 50% decrease in MADRS score. Remission was defined as a MADRS score of 10 or lower along with a ⩾50% decrease in score. Secondary outcomes were response to treatment in scores on BDI and CGI. Subjects at rest and maximal frowns were assessed photographically at the beginning and end of the study.\n\nResults: 121 subjects were screened, of whom 84 subjects were randomized: 41 to OBA and 43 to placebo. Eight patients were excluded (4 patients in the OBA group for withdrawal of consent, and two in each group for protocol violations). One OBA subject was lost to follow-up after injection. 33 subjects in the OBA group and 41 in the placebo group completed all three visits. The two groups did not differ significantly on any of the demographic or clinical baseline variables. 91% of the OBA and 80% of the PLB subjects suffered from recurrent depression. The average number of antidepressants tried during subject lifetimes, were 2.2 for OBA, and 1.8 for PLB, and the mean duration of the current depressive episode was 27.9 months. As for the primary end point, MADRS scores at the six week visit versus baseline, there was a significant improvement in the OBA group compared to the PLB group; there was a 47.0% reduction in MADRS scores for OBA subjects, versus a 20.6% reduction for PLB (student's t test, p<0.0004). The OBA group showed a significant clinical improvement in depression, compared to the PLB group, over time, as measured by MADRS score, (ANOVA, f=9.7, p<0.0028, two-tailed); BDI-II score, (ANOVA, f=5.7, p<0.019, two-tailed.); and CGI score (ANOVA, f=15.3, p<0.0002, two-tailed.). The response rate for MADRS was 51.5% vs. 14.6%; p<0.0009 Fisher's exact test. The remission rate, as judged by MADRS, was significantly higher in the OBA group, 27.3%, than in the PLB group, 7.3%, p<0.027, Fisher's exact test. A decrease in the maximal ability to frown at 6 weeks (among all subjects) was correlated with MADRS response; p<0.01; Spearman coefficient. In the OBA group, there was a trend towards greater response (⩾50% decrease in MADRS score) with increasing baseline frown (N.S., p<0.07).\n\nConclusions: This is the first randomized, double-blind and placebo -controlled clinical trial to show that a single treatment of the glabellar region with OBA induces a strong and sustained alleviation of symptoms in a broadly defined group of people with MDD. The results are consistent with those of our earlier pilot study (Finzi et al.) and the prior smaller controlled study of BT in patients with refractory depression. Our study is also the first to show that subjects treated with OBA went into remission at a significantly higher rate than placebo subjects. The mechanism of action of OBA in helping depression is unknown, but our results support the facial feedback hypothesis and suggest that it can be utilized therapeutically. The results also support the concept of emotional proprioception (Finzi, 2013) whereby the brain continuously monitors the relative valence of salient facial expressions, which may be an important influence on mood.\n\nKeywords: botulinum toxin depression clinical trial\n\nDisclosure: E.

Adjunctive Aripiprazole More Than Doubles the Rate of Early and Sustained Response across Multiple Measures in Patients with MDD Who Have an Inadequate Response to Antidepressant Monotherapy\n\nDaniel E. Casey*, Kimberly Laubmeier, Eudicone James, Ronald N. Marcus, Ross A. Baker, John Sheehan, Robert M. Berman\n\nOregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon\n\nBackground: Medications with rapid antidepressant effects address an unmet need in major depressive disorder (MDD), as it can take several weeks to determine if a given antidepressant will be effective for an individual patient. However, a rapid, transient effect alone does not address patients’ longer-term needs. Therefore, we evaluated the early and sustained antidepressant effects of adjunctive aripiprazole in MDD. Early and sustained response (ESusR) is a particularly rigorous measure of efficacy because patients must respond early and at all subsequent time points. This post-hoc analysis investigated ESusR using both measures of symptoms (Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS]), total clinical progress from baseline (Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale [CGI-I]) and a measure of clinical state versus other patients with depression (CGI-Severity scale [CGI-S]).\n\nMethods: This pooled analysis of 3 similar studies,1,2 enrolled patients with an inadequate response to 1-3 trials of antidepressant therapy (ADT). Each study had an 8-week prospective ADT phase (Phase B), then a 6-week randomized phase of adjunctive aripiprazole vs. adjunctive placebo (Phase C). In this analysis, ESusR was defined as a patient who had a response by one of 3 measures during Phase C (⩾50% improvement in MADRS total score; CGI-I or CGI-S scores of 1-2) at Week 2 and sustained that response at all subsequent visits (Weeks 3, 4, 5, and 6). In addition, because the literature presents inconsistent cut-offs for response on the CGI-S, we determined the most appropriate definition in this population.\n\nResults: Among Week 2 MADRS Responders, the median and mode CGI-S scores at Week 2 were 2 (borderline mentally ill) for both adjunctive aripiprazole (n=88) and adjunctive placebo (n=42), while the median and mode CGI-S scores among Week 2 adjunctive aripiprazole (n=299) and adjunctive placebo Non-responders (n=345) were 4 (moderately ill). However, among Week 2 Responders and Non-Responders the distribution of CGI-S scores significantly differed between the aripiprazole and placebo treatment arms (p<0.0001) and appeared to favor aripiprazole. The rates of ESusR by MADRS in the adjunctive aripiprazole and adjunctive placebo groups were 11.6% (45/387) and 5.4% (21/387), respectively (P=0.002; relative risk [RR]=2.2, 95% CI: 1.3, 3.5). Rates of ESusR by CGI-I in the adjunctive aripiprazole and placebo groups were 30.9% (120/389) and 15.3% (59/386), respectively (P<0.0001; RR=2.0, 95% CI: 1.5, 2.7). Rates of ESusR by CGI-S in the adjunctive aripiprazole and placebo groups were 13.6% (53/390) and 5.1% (20/389), respectively (P<0.0001; RR=2.6, 95% CI: 1.6, 4.3). Overall, 31.3% (121/386) of patients receiving aripiprazole responded by at least one measure of EsusR compared with 15.6% (60/384) of patients receiving placebo.\n\nConclusions: In this MDD population who failed previous ADT, a CGI-S cut-off of 2 constituted the most appropriate definition of response on this scale. The distribution of CGI-S scores among Week 2 responders appeared to favor aripiprazole. ESusR was demonstrated with adjunctive aripiprazole at a rate more than double compared with ADT monotherapy using a symptom scale and 2 global response measures. As expected, the response cut-off of MADRS improvement ⩾50% was similar to a CGI-S score of 1-2. Both definitions appeared to be a more rigorous response definition than CGI-I 1-2. The magnitude of treatment effect across the three measures was similar. These similar results across three scales suggest aripiprazole reliably and robustly increases the proportion of patients who achieve ESusR.\n\nReferences: 1.

A Randomized Controlled Crossover Trial of Ketamine in Obsessive-compulsive Disorder\n\nCarolyn I. Rodriguez*, Lawrence S. Kegeles, Amanda Levinson, Sue Marcus, Helen Blair. Simpson\n\nColumbia University, Bronx, New York\n\nBackground: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a leading cause of illness-related disability (1). First-line OCD pharmacological treatments lead to limited symptom relief and typically have a lag time of 6-10 weeks before clinically meaningful improvement (2). Identifying more effective pharmacological treatments with faster onset of action would be a major advance. Medications thought to modulate the glutamate system are a promising new class of pharmacological agents for the treatment of OCD (3-8). Ketamine, a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, modulates glutamate and has been shown to have rapid anti-depressant effects in multiple studies (9-15). A recent case study of a unmedicated individual with OCD without comorbid depression who was given ketamine (0.5 mg/kg IV over 40 minutes) showed rapid anti-obsessional effects that persisted from 1 to 7 days post-infusion, long after the drug had cleared (16). A subsequent open trial of ketamine in ten individuals showed modest but significant improvement in OCD symptoms over days 1 to 3 following ketamine infusion compared to baseline; the majority of individuals with OCD in this study were taking multiple medications and had moderate to severe current comorbid depression (17). We investigated the effects of ketamine on individuals with OCD who were not currently on medications and did not have moderate to severe comorbid depression.\n\nMethods: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, unmedicated adults (N=10) with OCD received two intravenous infusions: one of saline and one of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) over 40 minutes. These infusions were spaced at least 1 week apart; the order of each pair of infusions was randomized. To be eligible, participants were required to have at least moderate to severe OCD (Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale [YBOCS] score >16) with no or mild depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HDRS-17]<25), and endorse near-constant intrusive obsessions (>8 hours per day) (18, 19). To assess rapid changes in obsessions, the OCD visual analogue scale (OCD-VAS) was used at baseline, at 26, 90, 110, and 230 minutes and daily for 7 days post-infusion (16). To assess both obsessive and compulsive symptoms, the YBOCS scale, designed to be used to assess OCD symptoms at 1 week intervals, was used at baseline and 7 days post-infusion. To monitor depressive symptoms, the HDRS-17 was used at baseline and 1 and 3 days post-infusion. Response rate of obsessions was defined as a minimum of 35% improvement in obsessions (as measured by the OCD-VAS), and response rate for OCD symptoms was defined as a minimum of 35% reduction in OCD symptoms (as measured by the YBOCS).\n\nResults: All ten participants completed the study. At baseline, participants had moderate to severe OCD symptoms (mean YBOCS 27.1+/−3.4 SD, range: 22-34). On average, there was a significant rapid decrease in obsessions (as measured by OCD-VAS) which decayed over time and then reached a plateau. Responder rate (n=10) of obsessions (as measured by OCD-VAS) at post-infusion time points were as follows: 90% at 3 hours, 80% at 1 day, 60% at 2 days, 50% at 3 days, and 50% until day 7. Responder rate (n=10) for OCD symptoms (as measured by YBOCS) was 50% at day 7. Responder rate for OCD symptoms among the subset of patients (n=5) who got the ketamine infusion first (and thus the effects of ketamine could be evaluated at both day 7 and day 14), was 40% at day 14. At baseline, participants had minimal depressive symptoms (mean HDRS 4.2+/−5.6, range: 0-16). The average depressive symptoms of the 10 patients did decrease somewhat after the ketamine infusion (4.2+/−5.6 to 1.8+/−1.9, F(2,17)=3.38, p=0.058).\n\nConclusions: These data suggest that ketamine can rapidly relieve symptoms of OCD, and this effect can persist for at least one week in 50% of OCD patients with constant intrusive thoughts. A subset of individuals had relief for up to two weeks. Future research is needed to better understand the mechanism of ketamine's rapid anti-obsessional effect and persistant reduction in OCD symptoms, long after the drug has cleared. These insights will help inform the development of new treatment strategies for individuals suffering with OCD.\n\nKeywords: Ketamine; Glutamate, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Clinical Trial, Pharmacological Therapy\n\nDisclosure: C.

Safety and Tolerability of Atomoxetine Hydrochloride in a Placebo-controlled Randomized Withdrawal Study in Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder\n\nHimanshu P. Upadhyaya*, Angelo Camporeale, J. Antoni Ramos-Quiroga, David Williams, Yoko Tanaka, Jeannine Lane, Robert R. Conley, Rodrigo Escobar, Paula Trzepacz, Albert J. Allen\n\nEli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, Indiana\n\nBackground: Safety and tolerability of atomoxetine (ATX) were studied in the first double-blind (DB), placebo (PBO)-controlled, randomized withdrawal trial of ATX in adults with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Responders, who completed 24 wks of ATX treatment (TX), were randomized to an additional 25 wks of ATX or PBO.\n\nMethods: The study was conducted at 152 outpatient sites in 18 countries. Patients (N=2017; 60% from Europe), 18-50 yrs of age, with ADHD were enrolled into the study and received up to 12 wks of open-label (OL) ATX (40-100 mg/day). Responders were maintained on an ATX dose of 80 or 100 mg/day for an additional 12 wks of DB maintenance. Those who met response maintenance criteria were randomized to ATX (N=266) or PBO (N=258) for a 25-wk randomized withdrawal phase. Safety measures included discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), TX-emergent AEs (TEAEs), supine blood pressure (BP) and pulse, body mass index (BMI) and weight, electrocardiogram (ECG), the Columbia Suicide-Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale–14 items (HAMA), and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 items (HAMD-17). For categorical variables, TX differences were compared with Fisher's exact test. For continuous variables, within-TX least-squares mean (LSMean) changes from baseline (BL) to endpoint (EP) were analyzed with a Wilcoxon signed-ranked test and between-TX LSMean changes from BL to EP were analyzed with analysis of covariance or analysis of variance.\n\nResults: During the first 24 wks of ATX TX, no deaths occurred. Discontinuations due to AE with a frequency of ⩾1% were nausea (2.4%) and fatigue (1.1%). TEAEs with a frequency of ⩾5% were nausea (27.4%), headache (17.3%), dry mouth (17.0%), decreased appetite (14.6%), fatigue (13.0%), hyperhidrosis (9.0%), insomnia (8.8%), dizziness (8.5%), nasopharyngitis (6.8%), and somnolence (5.6%). Twenty-nine (1.4%) patients experienced 35 SAEs; 10 were judged by the investigator as related to study drug (alcohol abuse and 2 events of restlessness in 1 patient; haemorrhage and headache in 1 patient; 2 events of bradykinesia in 1 patient; suicidal ideation, palpitations, and auditory hallucination in 1 patient each). Changes from BL to EP in systolic BP (1.3 mmHg), diastolic BP (1.6 mmHg), pulse (5.4 bpm), BMI (−0.3 kg/mE2) and weight (−0.8 kg) were significant (p<.001). For ECG parameters, changes from BL to EP in heart rate (HR; 8.7 bpm), PR (−4.2 ms), QRS (0.4 ms), Fridericia's QT correction (QTcF; −0.1 ms) and, Bazett's QT correction (QTcB; 8.2 ms) were significant (p<.05). No patient had a QTcF or QTcB >500 ms, and no patient showed an increase from BL in QTcF and QTcB >60 ms. Suicide-related events as assessed by the C-SSRS were experienced by 2.8% of patients. Changes from BL to EP on HAMA (−0.8) and HAMD-17 (−0.3) total scores were significant (p<.001), but not clinically relevant. During the 25-wk, DB randomized withdrawal phase, 1 death of unconfirmed myocardial infarction occurred in a male patient on 100 mg ATX; the investigator was unable to assess the relatedness between this event and blinded study drug, OL ATX TX, or protocol procedures. The incidence of SAEs was similar between ATX and PBO (2.6% vs. 1.6%; p=.545). Frequencies of discontinuations due to AEs were similar between ATX and PBO overall (3.4% vs 1.9%; p=.418) and for each individual AE. The overall percentage of patients experiencing ⩾1 TEAE(s) was significantly higher for ATX than PBO (47.0% vs 37.6%; p=.034), but there were no significant differences between ATX and PBO for any individual TEAE. There were significant, but relatively small differences between ATX and PBO in diastolic BP (−0.1 vs −2.3 mmHg; p<.001), pulse (−1.4 vs −5.3 bpm; p<.001), BMI (−0.1 vs 0.4 kg/mE2; p<.001) and weight (−0.2 vs 1.1 kg; p<.001). Changes from BL in QTcF (0.8 vs 2.3 ms) were not significantly different between ATX and PBO; however, there were significant differences (p<.01) between ATX and PBO for changes in HR (−2.6 vs −9.1 bpm), PR (0.2 vs 4.1 ms), and QTcB (−1.6 vs −5.9 ms). No patient had a QTcF and QTcB >500 ms, and no patient showed an increase from BL in QTcF and QTcB >60 ms. The relative frequencies of suicide-related events assessed by the C-SSRS were not significantly different between ATX and PBO (2.3% vs 1.2%). Changes from BL to EP in the HAMA (−0.3 vs 0.1) and HAMD-17 (0.0 vs 0.4) total scores were not significantly different between ATX and PBO.\n\nConclusions: This study demonstrated that ATX exhibited an acceptable safety profile in adults with ADHD during the first 24 wks of TX, and during an additional 25 wks of DB TX in the largest clinical trial of ADHD in adults to date.\n\nKeywords: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, adult, European, atomoxetine\n\nDisclosure: H.

Efficacy and Safety of Cariprazine in Acute Exacerbation of Schizophrenia: A Phase III, International, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial\n\nStephen R. Zukin*, John Kane, Andrew J. Cutler, Yao Wang, Oksana Mokliatchouk, Krisztián Nagy, István Laszlovszky, Suresh Durgam\n\nForest Research Institute, Jersey City, New Jersey\n\nBackground: Cariprazine is a potent dopamine D3-preferring D3/D2 receptor partial agonist antipsychotic in development for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar mania. With almost 10-fold greater selectivity for the dopamine D3 receptor over the D2 receptor, cariprazine has a unique pharmacological profile among antipsychotics. Along with high dopamine D2 receptor affinity, high affinity at the dopamine D3 receptor may result in clinical advantages such as beneficial effects on negative symptoms and improvements in cognitive functioning. Cariprazine has previously demonstrated efficacy in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia in a phase II study. This phase III study (NCT01104779) evaluated the efficacy and safety of cariprazine 3-6 and 6-9 mg/d in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia.\n\nMethods: An international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled fixed/flexible-dose study compared cariprazine 3-6 mg/d and cariprazine 6-9 mg/d with placebo. Patients with DSM-IV-TR-defined schizophrenia with a current psychotic episode <2 weeks’ duration, and a Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score ⩾80 and ⩽120 were randomized (1:1:1) to receive placebo, cariprazine 3-6 mg/d, or cariprazine 6-9 mg/d. Patients received 6 weeks of double-blind treatment followed by 2 weeks of safety follow-up. Hospitalization was required for the screening period and at least the first 4 weeks of double-blind treatment. The primary efficacy parameter was the change from baseline to Week 6 in PANSS total score analyzed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) approach on the modified Intent-to-Treat population (ITT), defined as patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 postbaseline PANSS assessment. Sensitivity analyses using pattern-mixture model (PMM) and additional analysis using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with last observation carried forward (LOCF) approaches were performed. A matched parallel gatekeeping procedure was applied to control overall type 1 error rates for multiple comparisons. The secondary efficacy parameter was the change from baseline to Week 6 in Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) score analyzed similarly to the primary analyses. Additional efficacy measures included, in part, the PANSS positive and negative subscales, Negative Symptom Assessment (NSA-16), and Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I). Safety was evaluated by AEs, clinical laboratory values, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), extrapyramidal symptom (EPS), and akathisia scales.\n\nResults: Of the 446 patients that were randomized and received treatment (Safety Population: placebo [n=147], cariprazine 3-6 mg/d [n=151], or cariprazine 6-9 mg/d [n=148]), 60.5% completed the study. The most common reasons for discontinuation were withdrawal of consent (16.4%), insufficient therapeutic response (11.4%), and AEs (9.0%). The overall mean daily cariprazine dose (±SD) was 4.22±0.93 mg/d for the 3-6 mg/d group and 6.55±1.43 mg/d for the 6-9 mg/d group. At Week 6, least squares mean difference (LSMD) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) in PANSS total score for cariprazine versus placebo was -6.8 (95% CI=-11.3, -2.4; adjusted P=.0029) for the 3-6 mg/d group and -9.9 (95% CI=-14.5, -5.3; adjusted P<.0001) for the 6-9 mg/d group. Significant improvement for cariprazine over placebo in PANSS total score was observed starting at Week 1 for the 6-9 mg/d group and at Week 2 for the 3-6 mg/d group. CGI-S scores were also significantly improved at Week 6 in both cariprazine groups compared with placebo (3-6 mg/d, LSMD=-0.3 [-0.6, -0.1]; adjusted P=.0115; cariprazine 6-9 mg/d, LSMD=-0.5 [-0.8, -0.3] adjusted P=.0002). On PANSS positive scores, both cariprazine groups showed significant improvement relative to placebo (3-6 mg/d, LSMD=-2.0 [-3.5, -0.6]; P=.0074; 6-9 mg/d, LSMD=-3.4 [-4.9, -1.8]; P<.0001). Cariprazine 6-9 mg/d demonstrated significant improvements over placebo on negative symptoms as measured by change in the PANSS negative (LSMD=-1.7 [-2.9, -0.4]; P=.0095) and NSA-16 total (LSMD=-3.4 [-6.0, -0.9]; P=.0089) scores. Both cariprazine groups also demonstrated significant improvement versus placebo on CGI-I scores. Discontinuations due to AEs were similar across groups. The most common AEs leading to discontinuation (⩾2%) were worsening of schizophrenia and psychotic disorder. Common (⩾5% and twice the rate of placebo) treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) that occurred in both cariprazine groups were akathisia, EPS, and tremor. Common TEAEs in the cariprazine 3-6 mg/d group were constipation and diarrhea; common TEAEs in the cariprazine 6-9 mg/day group were restlessness, dyspepsia, vomiting, and increased weight. Mean changes in cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, and weight were small and similar between groups. Prolactin levels decreased in all treatment groups.\n\nConclusions: Cariprazine 3-6 mg/d and 6-9 mg/d demonstrated significant improvement relative to placebo on change from baseline to Week 6 on primary (PANSS total score) and secondary (CGI-S) parameters. Cariprazine was generally well tolerated, although the incidence of EPS and akathisia was greater for cariprazine compared with placebo.\n\nKeywords: cariprazine, schizophrenia, clinical trial\n\nDisclosure: S.

Rasagiline in the Treatment of the Persistent Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia\n\nRobert W. Buchanan*, Elaine Weiner, Deanna L. Kelly, Robert P. McMahon, James M. Gold, David Gorelick\n\nUniversity of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland\n\nBackground: There are no known effective pharmacological treatments for negative symptoms of schizophrenia. However, previous studies with selegiline, a MAO-B inhibitor, suggest that this class of agents may be of benefit for this indication. The current study assessed whether the selective MAO-B inhibitor, rasagiline, was effective for persistent negative symptoms. In light of its mechanism of action, we also examined whether rasagiline would improve performance on cognitive measures, whose performance reflected prefrontal or striatal dopamine activity.\n\nMethods: Sixty people with DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder entered a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. Participants were randomized to either: rasagiline 3 mg/day (n=31) or placebo (n=29). Participants were clinically stable and required to meet a priori criteria for persistent negative symptoms. The Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) total score was used to assess negative symptoms. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale positive symptom item total score was used to assess positive symptom change. The Calgary Depression Scale total score was used to assess depressive symptom change. The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS); N-Back test; a probabilistic learning task; and delayed discounting task were used to assess cognition.\n\nResults: Participants randomized to rasagiline had a non-significantly greater reduction in SANS total score than those randomized to placebo (F=2.70; df=41.2; p=0.11). The estimated magnitude of the group treatment differences increased over time. At week 12, the group difference in SANS total score: 3.42±1.59, was significant (t=2.15; df=37.3; p=0.04). The group difference at week 12 was largely driven by a reduction in the SANS Avolition score in the participants randomized to rasagiline (t=3.06; df=49.0; p=0.004). There were no significant group differences on any of the other symptom measures. There were no significant group differences on the RBANS total score, or on any of the N-back, probabilistic learning, or delayed discounting tasks.\n\nConclusions: The results of the current study support the utility of MAO-B inhibitors for the treatment of negative symptoms, with an apparent selective benefit for avolition. The use of other non-pharmacological interventions may be required to enhance the therapeutic benefit of such agents. The results do not suggest that rasagiline is of any benefit for the cognitive impairments observed in people with schizophrenia. (clinicaltrials.gov, trial number: NCT00492336).

Effects of Suvorexant, an Orexin Receptor Antagonist, on Next Day Driving Performance in Healthy Volunteers\n\nAnnemiek Vermeeren*, Eric Vuurman, Anita Van Oers, Cees Van Leeuwen, Stefan Jongen, An Bautmans, Xiaodong Li, Tara Siringhaus, Ingeborg Heirman, Tine Laethem, Matthew Troyer, David Michelson, Hong Sun\n\nMaastricht University, Maastricht, Netherlands\n\nBackground: Suvorexant is a potent orexin receptor antagonist that is being developed for treatment of insomnia. In a previous study in elderly subjects (⩾ 65 years old), suvorexant (15 and 30 mg) did not produce clinically meaningful impairment of next-day driving performance as assessed by Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP) in an on-road driving test. There was also no significant next-day impairment on postural balance and verbal memory in elderly subjects. The present study was designed to assess the residual effects of suvorexant on next-day highway driving performance in adults younger than 65 years, after single and repeated doses of 20 and 40 mg (similar exposures to 15 and 30 mg in the elderly subjects).\n\nMethods: This was a double-blind, placebo- and active drug-controlled, 4-period, crossover study in 28 healthy subjects (15 women, 13 men), aged between 23 and 64 years (mean age 45.6 years). Each dose of suvorexant (20 and 40 mg) and placebo was administered for 8 consecutive nights (from Days 1 to 8). Zopiclone 7.5 mg was included as an active control, administered on Day 1 and on Day 8 only. Residual effects were assessed in the mornings of Day 2 and Day 9 of each treatment period, using a one-hour standardized highway driving test at 9 hours postdose, and memory and postural balance tests at 11 hours postdose. The primary dependent variable was SDLP in the driving test, a measure of “weaving”. A mean increase in SDLP of 2.4 cm corresponds to effects previously found for alcohol at blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) of 0.5 g/L, the legal limit for BAC while driving in many countries.\n\nResults: Mean increases in SDLP following suvorexant 20 and 40 mg were 1.01 and 1.66 cm on Day 2, and 0.48 and 1.31 on Day 9, respectively. As the 90% CIs of these mean changes in SDLP were all below the pre-specified clinical bound of 2.4 cm, these changes are not considered clinically meaningful. Symmetry analysis of individual changes in SDLP from placebo on Day 2 revealed a statistically greater number of subjects whose SDLP increased more than 2.4 cm (indicating impairment) than those whose SDLP decreased more than 2.4 cm (indicating improvement) following both suvorexant doses. On Day 9 this difference was still significant for the higher dose, but no longer for the lower dose of suvorexant. Four subjects requested that a total of 5 driving tests stop prematurely due to self-reported somnolence: 3 subjects following 40 mg suvorexant on Day 2 and 2 subjects following 20 mg suvorexant, one each on Day 2 and Day 9. There was a statistically significant decrease in number of words recalled following the first dose of 40 mg suvorexant, and a significant increase in body sway area on the morning following the first dose of 20 or 40 mg suvorexant.\n\nConclusions: As assessed by mean change in SDLP, there was no clinically meaningful residual effect of suvorexant (20 or 40 mg) on driving in healthy subjects less than 65 years old. These results suggest a lack of important effects on next-day driving performance for most subjects. In secondary analyses, some individual subjects had increased SDLP and/or prematurely stopped driving tests due to somnolence, suggesting there may be a small group of individuals more likely to experience next-day effects.

Effects of the Mu-Opioid Receptor Antagonist GSK1521498 on Brain Responses to Food Cues, Hedonic and Consummatory Eating Behaviour and Bodyweight: A Proof of Mechanism Study in Binge Eating Obese Subjects\n\nPradeep Nathan*, Hisham Ziauddeen, Samuel R. Chamberlain, Victoria Cambridge, Mark Bush, Wenli Tao, Annelize Koch, Chris Dodds, Kay Maltby, Andrew Skeggs, Lucy Cheke, Sadaf Farooqi, Stephen O’Rahilly, Paul Fletcher, Edward Bullmore\n\nGlaxo Smith Kline, Cambridge, United Kingdom\n\nBackground: The mu opioid receptor system is implicated in the hedonic and motivational processing of food, and in binge-eating, a behaviour strongly linked to obesity. GSK1521498 is a novel mu opioid antagonist being investigated as a candidate treatment for behavioural and substance addictions. It is centrally active and has 14-20 fold greater selectivity for mu versus kappa and delta opioid receptors. In rodents, GSK1521498 suppressed the intake of standard and palatable chow, caused weight loss in diet induced obese rats. It also suppressed food seeking and binge-eating showing superior efficacy to naltrexone. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of four-weeks of treatment with the mu-opioid receptor antagonist GSK1521498 on eating behaviour in binge-eating obese subjects.\n\nMethods: Adults with body mass index ⩾30 kg/m2 and binge-eating scale scores ⩾ 19 received one-week single-blind placebo run-in, and were then randomized to 28 days with either 2 mg/day GSK1521498, 5 mg/day GSK1521498, or placebo (N=21 per arm) in a double blind parallel group design. The outcome measures were body weight, fat mass, hedonic and consummatory eating behaviour during inpatient food challenges, safety, and pharmacokinetics. In addition, using fMRI and behavioural measures the effects of GSK1521498 on brain responses to food images and, separately, on motivation to expend energy in order to view comparable images were determined.\n\nResults: The primary analysis was the comparison of change scores in the higher dose treatment group versus placebo, using analysis of covariance, at each relevant time point. GSK1521498 (2 mg and 5 mg) was not different from placebo in its effects on weight, fat mass, and binge-eating scores. However, compared with placebo, GSK1521498 5 mg/day caused a significant reduction in hedonic responses to sweetened dairy products, and reduced calorific intake, particularly of high fat foods during ad libitum buffet meals. GSK1521498 5 mg/day also caused a significant reduction in pallidum/putamen responses to high calorie food pictures and a reduction in motivation to view high calorie food images. There were no significant effects of GSK1521498 2 mg/day on eating behaviour or brain responses to food pictures indicating dose-dependency of pharmacodynamics. GSK1521498 was generally well tolerated and no previously unidentified safety signals were identified.\n\nConclusions: These findings suggest that hedonic and motivation towards high calorie food and their consumption in obese people with binge-eating is sensitive to altered mu opioid function. The attenuation in putamen/pallidal response suggests a direct impact of the drug on the rewarding properties of food stimuli. The findings provide evidence for a link between the opioid system, brain reward pathways and food-related behaviour in binge-eating obese individuals. The potential for these findings to translate into clinically significant effects in the context of binge-eating and weight regain prevention requires further investigation.\n\nKeywords: Mu Opioid receptors, Functional Imaging, Obesity, Eating, Clinical Trial\n\nDisclosure: P.

Mindfulness Training Improves Resilience: Reductions in Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) Response to Laboratory Stress\n\nElizabeth Hoge*, T.H. Eric Bui, Christina Metcalf, Mark H. Pollack, Naomi M. Simon\n\nMassachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts\n\nBackground: Mindfulness-Based interventions have greatly increased in popularity, and are being used with patients with anxiety disorders. However, randomized controlled trials are needed to validate preliminary findings and provide additional biological confirmatory evidence of effects on stress and anxiety. We conducted an RCT of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), a standardized and manualized mindfulness meditation training, in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). To test the effects of the training on anxiety and distress during subsequent stress, we measured stress hormones and ratings of anxiety and distress during a laboratory behavioral stress challenge. We hypothesized that the individuals who participated in the mindfulness meditation group would become more “resilient” to a laboratory stress task than those assigned to the control intervention.\n\nMethods: Participants with Generalized Anxiety Disorder were randomized to either 8 weeks of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) training or an active control class (“Stress Management Education,” (SME)), both of which were conducted in a group format. The SME class incorporated elements of group treatment including attention from instructor, group support, and information about stress, but did not include any meditation training. Subjects underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), which includes a public speaking task and arithmetic testing, before and after their intervention, and rated state anxiety and distress. Blood samples were collected throughout the procedure (+5. +10, +15. +20, +28, +40, +45, +50, +55, +80 minutes) to measure hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis biomarkers of psychological stress (cortisol and ACTH). Subjects taking SSRI's and benzodiazepines were excluded due to the known interference of medications with TSST response. Area under the Curve (AUC) calculations were made to assess the overall stress response to the TSST, and the changes in AUC from before and after treatment were compared. Anxiety during the stress task was assessed with the state portion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and distress with the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS). Before the TSST, participants completed the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire to assess potential changes in psychological constructs potentially involved in mindfulness mediation training.\n\nResults: Twenty-two subjects completed the SME class (50% women, mean(SD) age=39(11), 91% white) and 35 completed the MBSR class (43% women, mean(SD) age=41(15), 77% white) and completed pre-treatment and post-treatment TSSTs. Participants in the MBSR group had a significantly greater drop in their ACTH AUC compared to those in the SME class, for whom there was actually an increase in the ACTH AUC after the intervention (rank sum test, z=−2.2, p=0.027). Plasma cortisol AUCs also dropped more in the MBSR group compared to SME, but this difference did not reach significance; however, is worth noting that that ACTH and cortisol were highly correlated (r=.34, p=.009). The MBSR group also had a greater drop in the STAI state anxiety score over treatment (mean (SD), 53.8 (12.5) to 40.4 (12.2) compared to the SME group (52.2 (10.9) to 45.2 (10.2), comparison of change scores, t=−2.13, p=0.0365), and also a greater decrease in the SUDS distress rating (MBSR group mean(SD): 53.2 (24.6) to 28.7 (22.3); SME: 50.5 (23.6) to 39.4 (24), comparison of change scores, t=−2.29, p=0.025). Tying these findings together, the ACTH AUC levels were associated with the STAI scores after controlling for age and gender, both of which can affect hormone levels independently. Lastly, the change in ACTH AUC correlated with the mindfulness variable, “Act with Awareness,” in the MBSR group (r=.41, p=.02) but not SME (r=.04, p=.8).\n\nConclusions: This RCT of MBSR in GAD found that mindfulness meditation training was associated with an attenuated stress response to a laboratory stress challenge, as measured by plasma stress hormones, raising the possibility that mindfulness may imbue some resilience to stressful psychological challenges. This is further supported by a reduction in patients’ self-report ratings of distress and anxiety after the TSST, that were significantly more improved in the MBSR than the SME group, suggesting that the meditation training may have helped participants cope better with subsequent stress. This is important because improved coping appears to be associated with better mental health outcomes: other work demonstrated that worse coping during the TSST was associated with greater depression symptoms in the subsequent year (Aschbacher 2012). Improvements in stress hormones were also associated with the mindfulness variable, “Act with Awareness,” which suggests a potential psychological mechanism of this mental training. “Act with Awareness” indicates paying attention to one's current activities and avoiding absent-mindedness and dissociation. Conclusions are limited due to small sample size. In addition, the self-report measures did not universally correlate with the hormonal measurements (e.g. the SUDS). Nonetheless, the findings suggest that mindfulness meditation training may be a helpful strategy to decrease distress and anxiety and improve resilience in patients with GAD.\n\nKeywords: Mindfulness, Adrenocorticotropic Hormone, Generalized Anxiety Disorder\n\nDisclosure: E.

A Phase III, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Flexible-Dose Study of Levomilnacipran SR in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder\n\nAngelo Sambunaris*, Anjana Bose, Carl Gommoll, Changzheng Chen, William M. Greenberg, Stephen R. Zukin, David V. Sheehan\n\nAtlanta Institute of Medicine & Research, Atlanta, Georgia\n\nBackground: Mood dysfunction and functional impairment are disabling features of major depressive disorder (MDD). Levomilnacipran SR (1S, 2R-milnacipran) is a potent and selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) in late-stage clinical development for MDD. Levomilnacipran SR has 2-fold greater potency for norepinephrine relative to serotonin reuptake inhibition and over 10-fold higher selectivity for norepinephrine reuptake inhibition compared with duloxetine or venlafaxine; the sustained release formulation allows once-daily dosing. This Phase III study (NCT01034462) evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of flexibly dosed levomilnacipran SR versus placebo in MDD.\n\nMethods: A multicenter, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, flexible-dose study compared levomilnacipran SR 40-120 mg/day with placebo. Outpatients from US study centers were 18-80 years of age and met the DSM-IV-TR criteria for MDD with an ongoing depressive episode ⩾4 weeks’ duration, score ⩾30 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Clinician Rated (MADRS-CR) and ⩾26 on the MADRS-Self Rated (MADRS-SR). The study consisted of a 1-week single-blind, placebo run-in period followed by an 8-week double-blind treatment period and a 2-week double-blind down-taper period. Patients were randomized by computer-generated schedule; coded medication labels concealed assignment to levomilnacipran SR or placebo. Levomilnacipran SR patients received 20 mg/day for Days 1 and 2, and 40 mg/day beginning on Day 3; dose could be increased from 40 to 80 mg/day (Week 1 or 2), and from 40 to 80 mg/day or 80 to 120 mg/day (Week 4) based on patient response and tolerability. No dosage increase was allowed after Week 4. Primary efficacy endpoint was MADRS-CR total score change from baseline to Week 8; primary analysis was a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) using the modified Intent-to-Treat Population (ITT); the modified ITT population was defined as all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least 1 postbaseline assessment of MADRS-CR total score. Sensitivity analyses using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) and pattern-mixture model (PMM) approaches were also conducted. The secondary efficacy parameter was the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) total score change from baseline to Week 8. Additional efficacy measures included the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD17), Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) and -Improvement (CGI-I), Motivation and Energy Inventory-Short Form (MEI-SF), and cognitive tests. Safety was evaluated by adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and physical findings.\n\nResults: Of 442 patients who were randomized and received treatment (Safety Population: placebo=217; levomilnacipran SR=217), 79% of placebo and 75% of levomilnacipran SR patients completed the study. Demographic characteristics were similar between treatment groups. Approximately 44% of patients were up-titrated to receive 120 mg/day as the final dose. The least squares mean difference (LSMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for MADRS-CR total score change from baseline to Week 8 was statistically significant for levomilnacipran SR versus placebo (-3.10 [-5.26, -0.94]; P=.0051; MMRM). On the MADRS-CR, a statistically significant difference between levomilnacipran SR and placebo was seen at Week 4 and onward. Analyses using LOCF (LSMD [95% CI]=-2.55 [-4.56, -0.55]; P=.0127) and PMM approaches supported the primary results. SDS improvement was significant for levomilnacipran SR versus placebo as early as the first assessment (Week 4); LSMD for SDS change at Week 8 was -2.63 (-4.19, -1.07) (P=.0010). Significant changes at Week 8 in favor of levomilnacipran SR compared with placebo was also seen on additional efficacy measures including HAMD17 total score (-2.15 [-3.60, -0.70]; P=.0038), CGI-S score (-0.35 [-0.61, -0.09]; P=.0083), and MEI-SF total score (5.05 [0.28, 9.82]; P=.0382). AEs led to the discontinuation of 3% of placebo- and 8% of levomilnacipran SR-treated patients; 62% of placebo and 82% of levomilnacipran SR patients had double-blind treatment-emergent AEs. TEAEs that occurred in ⩾10% in either treatment group were nausea, headache, dizziness, dry mouth, and constipation. Serious AEs were reported in 3 placebo patients (noncardiac chest pain in 1 patient; head injury/liver injury/road traffic accident in 1 patient; asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 1 patient) and 2 levomilnacipran SR patients (intentional overdose/suicide attempt in 1 patient; back pain/road traffic accident/scratches in 1 patient) during double-blind treatment; suicidal ideation and noncardiac chest pain/hypertension were reported in 1 levomilnacipran SR patient each during down-taper.\n\nConclusions: After 8 weeks of treatment, there were statistically significant reductions on the MADRS-CR and SDS in favor of levomilnacipran SR over placebo demonstrating improvement in MDD symptoms and patient functioning. Significant differences seen at Week 4 on both the MADRS-CR and SDS were maintained over the remaining weeks of treatment. Levomilnacipran SR was generally well tolerated.\n\nKeywords: levomilnacipran, major depressive disorder, depression, SNRI, serotonin, norepinephrine\n\nDisclosure: A.

Devanand*, Susan Schultz, Jacobo Mintzer, David Sultzer, Gregory Pelton, Howard Andrews, Danilo de la Pena, Sanjay Gupta, Corbett Schimming, Sylvia Colon, Bruce Levin\n\nCollege of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, New York\n\nBackground: In patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who respond to treatment with antipsychotic medication for psychosis or agitation/aggression, the risk of recurrent symptoms after discontinuation is not established.\n\nMethods: AD patients with psychosis or agitation/aggression received 16 weeks of open treatment with risperidone. Responders were then randomized, double-blind, to one of three arms: (1) continuation risperidone for 32 weeks, (2) risperidone for 16 weeks followed by placebo for 16 weeks, (3) placebo for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was time to relapse of psychosis/agitation.\n\nResults: 180 patients received open-label risperidone (mean 0.97 mg daily). Psychosis and agitation improved with mild increase in extrapyramidal signs; 112 patients met criteria for response to treatment, and 110 responders were randomized. In the first 16 weeks after randomization, discontinuation to placebo (Arm 3) showed greater relapse than continuation risperidone (Arms 1 and 2) with hazard ratio 1.94, 95% CI 1.09-3.45, p=0.022. On placebo, 60% (24/40) relapsed compared to 32.9% (23/70) on risperidone (P=0.004). During the next 16 weeks, relapse was greater with discontinuation to placebo (Arm 2) compared to continuation risperidone (Arm 1): hazard ratio 4.88, 95% CI 1.08-21.98, p=0.023. On placebo, 48.1% (13/27) relapsed compared to 15.4% (2/13) on risperidone (P=0.017). Post-randomization, adverse events and deaths did not differ significantly although comparisons were based on small numbers of patients, especially during the final 16 weeks.\n\nConclusions: In AD patients with psychosis or agitation who maintained response to risperidone for 4 to 8 months, risperidone discontinuation was associated with increased risk of relapse. These findings suggest that existing Federal regulations requiring early discontinuation of antipsychotics in nursing homes need reconsideration.\n\nKeywords: Alzheimer, psychosis, agitation, antipsychotic, discontinuation\n\nDisclosure: D.

Predictors of Middle-of-the-Night Dosing in Primary Insomnia Subjects (Sleep Maintenance Type) Participating in a 4-Week Outpatient Clinical Trial of 3.5 mg Sublingual Zolpidem Tartrate versus Placebo\n\nThomas Roth*, Wallace Mendelson, Nikhilesh Singh, Frank J. Steinberg, Margaret Moline\n\nSleep Center Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, Michigan\n\nBackground: Frequent middle-of-the-night (MOTN) awakenings with difficulty retuning to sleep is a common insomnia phenotype. However, given the absence until recently of any drugs approved for this indication, there has been little systematic research on the pattern and predictors of MOTN awakenings or their treatment. A 4-week, double-blind, outpatient clinical trial in insomnia characterized by MOTN awakenings provides data to evaluate various factors potentially associated with MOTN medication use, including sex, age, and night of the week.\n\nMethods: The study evaluated the efficacy of sublingual zolpidem tartrate (ZST) 3.5 mg tablets vs. placebo (PBO) in female and male patients ages 18–64, inclusive, with a diagnosis of DSM-IV-TR primary insomnia and a history of MOTN awakenings. (While all subjects randomized to active treatment received 3.5 mg ZST, the FDA-approved dose of ZST (Intermezzo) for adult women is 1.75 mg.) Subjects were required to report (1) ⩾ 3-month history of prolonged MOTN awakenings characterized by ⩾ 3 awakenings/week as proposed in DSM V; (2) an average total sleep time ⩽ 6.5 hours; (3) usual time in bed of 7 – 9 hours; and (4) usual bedtime 2100 - 2400, not varying by ⩾ 2 hours on 5/7 days. After meeting preliminary inclusion/exclusion criteria, subjects participated in a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in screening period (baseline) prior to the 4 week treatment period. Subjects called an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) after a MOTN awakening ⩾ 10 min to confirm they had 4 hours remaining in bed and to receive instructions to dose (placebo only). Subjects also called the IVRS every morning, whether or not study medication was taken, to answer questions about the previous night's sleep. At the end of screening, 295 subjects were randomized to 4 weeks of double-blind treatment based on IVRS records of ⩾ 2 MOTN awakenings >30 min and ⩾ 1 MOTN awakening > 60 min during each of the 2 weeks. Subjects continued to use the IVRS system throughout the double-blind period to record the time of awakening, to receive permission to dose, and in the morning, to complete post-sleep questions including level of morning sleepiness/alertness. To assess the effects of treatment and time (study week) on average number of doses a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) ANCOVA with treatment and treatment*week as fixed effects, baseline total number of doses as covariate and compound symmetry covariance structure was used. For assessment of sex, p-values were obtained from an MMRM ANCOVA with treatment, treatment*week, sex, treatment*week*sex as fixed effects, baseline total number of doses as a covariate, and compound symmetry covariance structure. The distribution of number of dosing nights was analyzed by Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel tests, adjusting for week or for week and sex, depending on the analysis.\n\nResults: The efficacy and safety results have been published and are summarized here. ZST significantly (p<.0001) decreased self-reported latency to sleep onset across all 4 weeks (LS means are: ZST baseline 68.1 min; ZST DB treatment 38.2 min; PBO baseline 69.4 min; PBO DB treatment 56.4 min). Sleep quality and morning sleepiness/alertness also significantly improved with ZST. ZST was well tolerated; adverse events were generally mild and occurred at the same rate (19.3%) as placebo. There were no treatment-related SAEs. Across the 4-week double-blind period, 5142 awakenings (96% of calls to the IVRS system) were eligible for dosing. Across groups, there was a significant decrease in the mean number of doses taken over treatment week (p<0.001), from 4.9/wk in both groups during Week 1 to 4.0/wk for ZST and 4.1/wk for PBO during Week 4. There was no treatment effect on the frequency of dosing. Across both groups, there was a statistically significant difference between the female and male subjects in mean number of doses taken (p<0.02), with a greater decline seen in females (ZST: 4.9/Wk 1; 3.8/Wk 4; PBO: 4.7/Wk 1; 3.9/Wk 4) than in males (ZST: 4.8/Wk 1; 4.4/Wk 4; PBO: 5.1/Wk 1; 4.6/Wk 4). When subjects who took ⩾ 6 doses/wk were excluded from the analyses, this sex difference remained the same. There was no statistically significant influence of age or age*sex interaction on total number of dosing nights, across the treatment period, based on an ANCOVA model with age or age*sex as effects. Across the 4 weeks, the majority of subjects took between 5 – 7 doses/wk in both groups (ZST: 50.6%; PBO: 59.0%). The number of subjects taking ⩽ 3 doses/wk was 18.0% in the ZST group and 13.2% in the PBO group. This result is important, as subjects needed to have at least 3 MOTN awakenings per week to qualify for the study. However, there were no significant differences in the overall distribution between treatment groups. Interestingly, the rate of taking medication was essentially the same on all 7 nights of the week in both treatment groups.\n\nConclusions: These analyses are the first description of dosing for MOTN awakenings in this patient population. The results show that the use of MOTN prn medication did not increase over time; in fact, the frequency significantly decreased. The frequency of use also differs by gender but not by age or day of the week. More research is required to determine additional aspects of MOTN hypnotic use such as daytime factors and sleep on the previous night.\n\nKeywords: insomnia, zolpidem, prn hypnotics, middle-of-the-night, self-administration\n\nDisclosure: T.

Partial Adherence to Antipsychotic Treatment and Return of Positive Symptoms in First-episode Schizophrenia Patients\n\nJuan A. Gallego*, Delbert G. Robinson, Majnu John, Perihan E. Guveneck-Cokol, Jessica L. Greenberg, John Kane\n\nThe Zucker Hillside Hospital, Glen Oaks, New York\n\nBackground: Antipsychotic maintenance treatment is critical to prevent the re-emergence of psychotic symptoms after the successful treatment of a first episode of schizophrenia. What level of adherence (and therefore actual dose ingested) is required to prevent the return of symptoms? We tested the hypothesis that patients who are partially adherent compared to those who were fully adherent to maintenance antipsychotic treatment would have greater levels of positive symptoms and also shorter time to first recurrence of positive symptoms.\n\nMethods: The sample consisted of 47 first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum disorder patients who fulfilled stringent response criteria (a rating of mild or less on the positive symptom items on the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia Change version with psychosis and disorganization items [SADS C + PD] for two consecutive visits) within 16 weeks of starting randomized, controlled treatment with flexible-dosed olanzapine or risperidone. Subjects were assessed weekly, then biweekly and finally monthly for 3 years. For this analysis, follow-up data were censored at the time that subjects left their randomly assigned treatment for any reason. Adherence was determined based on data obtained from patients, family members and clinicians treating subjects. We defined the adherence reference dose as the antipsychotic dose at the time subjects first achieved response criteria. A mean adherence level was determined for each subject based on all weekly adherence ratings; this was converted to a percentage of the adherence reference dose. Based on mean adherence levels, subjects were classified as being fully adherent (>80% adherence reference dose), partially adherent (20-80%) or non-adherent (<20%). Survival analysis compared time to re-emergence of positive symptoms (i.e. a rating of moderate or greater on one or more SADS C + PD psychosis items) between groups. Mixed model analyses were conducted to determine the longitudinal effect of partial adherence on repeated measures of positive symptoms, using a composite score of seven positive symptoms items (severity of hallucinations, severity of delusions, impaired understandability, derailment, illogical thinking, bizarre behavior and grandiosity) from the SADS C +PD scale.\n\nResults: The subjects were young (mean age of 22.7 years (SD=4.4)) and mostly male (n=32, 68%). Twenty (42.6%) patients had responded to olanzapine and 27 (57.4%) to risperidone. Mean dose at the time of response was 7.9 mg (SD: 3.7) with olanzapine and) and 2.9 mg (SD: 1.2) with risperidone. Analysis by adherence groups showed that 15 patients were in the 20-80% category and 32 patients were in the >80% category. No subjects were in the <20% category. Overall, 25 (53.2%) patients experienced a re-emergence of positive symptoms while on their original assigned antipsychotic. Fifteen of 31 (48.4%) fully adherent subjects and 10 of 16 (62.5%) partially adherent subjects experienced a recurrence of positive symptoms. Time to recurrence of positive symptoms did not differ between fully adherent and partially adherent groups (log rank test, x2=0.44, p=0.5). However, the mixed model analysis revealed a significant (P=0.0046) increase in positive symptom scores over time in those subjects who were partially adherent to treatment, contrary to the effect observed in fully adherent subjects, in whom positive symptom scores decreased or did not change over time.\n\nConclusions: We found that first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorder patients who were partially adherent to their maintenance antipsychotic medication had greater levels of positive symptoms over time compared to patients who are fully adherent to their maintenance medication. This is consistent with a prior study (Subotnik et al., 2011) that also examined the effect of partial adherence in a first episode schizophrenia sample. Our study design employed a low dose strategy for initial treatment. Our data suggest that further dose reduction during maintenance treatment is not advisable.\n\nKeywords: first-episode, schizophrenia, adherence, response, positive symptoms\n\nDisclosure: J.

ALKS 5461, a Novel Opioid Receptor Modulator, Reduces the Subjective Effects of Cocaine and was Safe and Well Tolerated during Concurrent Cocaine Administration\n\nRyan Turncliff*, Bernard Silverman, Yangchun Du, Bradley Vince, Edward Sellers, Nancy Chen, Megan Shram, Mark Todtenkopf, Elliot W. Ehrich\n\nAlkermes, Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts\n\nBackground: There are no currently approved therapies for the treatment of cocaine abuse/dependence. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in cocaine-positive urine samples in patients receiving buprenorphine (BUP), a partial opioid agonist, in combination with naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, compared to controls. It is hypothesized that pharmacologic activity at μ and/or κ opioid receptors may be beneficial in the treatment of cocaine abuse. However, co-formulation of BUP and naltrexone is impractical due to pharmacokinetic, and physiochemical limitations. ALKS 5461 is a combination therapy of ALKS 33, a novel opioid receptor antagonist, and BUP co-formulated for sublingual (SL) administration. In a previous clinical study, a 1:1 dose ratio of ALKS 33:BUP blocked μ-opioid agonism of BUP as demonstrated by pupilometry and subjective responses. The purpose of the current DDI study was to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of ALKS 5461 and ALKS 33 during concurrent cocaine administration. Pharmacodynamic (PD) measures of subjective response to cocaine were also collected.\n\nMethods: A single-center, randomized, double-blind, PBO-controlled, multiple dose, parallel group study was conducted in 33 opioid-experienced non-treatment seeking cocaine users over a 14 Day (D) in-patient period. Subjects that tolerated baseline cocaine infusions (20 mg, D1; 40 mg D2) were randomized to ALKS 33 (8 mg), ALKS 5461 (8 mg ALKS 33 + 8 mg BUP, co-formulated), or PBO. Study drug was administered sublingually on D3-12 (AM); concurrent cocaine infusions (2 min) occurred at steady state of study drug on D11 (20 mg) and D12 (40 mg). Safety assessments included cardiovascular changes (HR, BP) and adverse event (AE) reporting. PK samples were collected on D1, D2, D11, and D12 for cocaine assay and D3-12 for study drug assay by validated LC/MS/MS methods. PD endpoints following cocaine infusion included BSCS, VAS measures. Statistical comparisons were made across study days and treatment groups.\n\nResults: The mean age of all subjects was 38.1 years (range: 22-49); 73% were male; age, sex and race were generally balanced across treatment groups. 24 subjects completed all study assessments (ALKS 5461, n=9; ALKS 33, n=6; PBO, n=9). There were no differences in HR or BP changes following cocaine infusion across treatment groups. Study drug related AEs were reported in 90%, 77%, and 10% of subjects in the ALKS 5461, ALKS 33 and PBO groups, respectively. Most common AEs included vomiting, nausea, and sedation, were moderate in severity and were generally equal across ALKS 5461 and ALKS 33 groups. BUP did not affect ALKS 33 PK and cocaine PK was not affected by study drug. ALKS 5461 reduced VAS measures of High, Drug Liking, Desire for Cocaine, and Overstimulation during cocaine infusion (40 mg) on D12; BSCS score for intensity of cocaine craving was significantly lower for ALKS 5461 vs. PBO (p<0.05) on D12.\n\nConclusions: Consistent with previous study results, administration of ALKS 5461 and ALKS 33 resulted in an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. SL administration of ALKS 5461 resulted in a reliable PK profile for both ALKS 33 and BUP. PD endpoints were suggestive of a treatment effect for ALKS 5461>ALKS 33>PBO. These results warrant further investigation of ALKS 5461 and ALKS 33 in a clinical study of cocaine abstinence and/or reduction.\n\nKeywords: Buprenorphine, Cocaine, pharmacokinetics, treatment, opioid\n\nDisclosure: R.

Morrissey, Nader Oskooilar, Mellissa M. Henry, Daniel E. Grosz, My-Linh Tong, Don F. De Francisco\n\nPharmacology Research Institute, Los Alamitos, California\n\nBackground: The ever-increasing incidence and prevalence of failed clinical trials within the CNS arena is well-documented and, at times, believed to be unstoppable – as evidenced by the number of pharmaceutical companies reducing their commitment to, and in some cases altogether exiting from, the neuroscience area(1). As numerous retrospective analyses have led to increasingly complex designs for current and immediately forthcoming studies, we reviewed more than 100 scientific publications, including several now in press, pertaining to the reported causes and potential remedies to the failed trials phenomenon.\n\nMethods: When reviewing the pertinent publications, we categorized the cited factors leading toward failed trials as being primarily Study Design-Oriented, Clinician-Oriented, or Patient-Oriented – recognizing that all three categories are contextually integrated. Our primary objective was to analyze the reported findings looking for repeatedly identified and/or validated predictors of success in combating this problem. In tandem, our secondary objective was to investigate the possibility that a key (potentially) over-looked variable further contributing to the failed studies epidemic could be identified and/or further investigated and evaluated.\n\nResults: (1) The degree to which Study Design issues have been reported as contributing toward the problem of failed CNS clinical trials was rarely cited; however, recently published reports of the degree to which enrichment designs may reduce placebo response, and thereby decrease the probability of a failed trial, have been gaining attention(2). (2) The most frequently cited contributing factors within the literature pertained to Clinician-Oriented variables – almost exclusively focusing on primary efficacy raters: poor inter-rater reliability, interview quality and rater bias. However, the resultant solutions, including but not limited to – scrutinized rater selection, centralized rater involvement, enhanced rater training and monitoring, more standardized assessment practices and even calls for ‘improved rating scales,’ have not resulted in a decreasing percentage of failed trials – hence the exit strategy by some companies. (3) The Patient-Oriented variables have not been frequently cited as contributing factors, except within the context of rater-related concerns allegedly allowing inappropriate subjects into a trial and/or increasingly restrictive inclusionary and exclusionary criteria seemingly prohibiting otherwise good (e.g., appropriate) candidates from entry into a trial. However, one pervasive and operationally over-looked variable is that of the “imposter subject,” a.k.a. “professional patient.” One paper (now in press) indicated that four percent of the initially screened subjects were simultaneously participating in other CNS studies; some “off-the-record,” e.g., unpublished reports from study sponsors have indicated significantly higher percentages.\n\nConclusions: The recent and ongoing emphasis on rater-related concerns and, to a much lesser degree, study design refinements can all too easily be rendered totally ineffective by the inclusion of skillfully dishonest, fraudulent research subjects. We will present data from three websites empowering and enabling these imposter/professional patients. In tandem, we will present data from three websites as to how to combat the inclusion of research subjects who are intent on fraudulently participating. Estimating the number of clinical studies categorized as “failed” and/or the number of promising CNS compounds discontinued from development, as a result of Type-II error, vis-à-vis research subject fraud, is too speculative. Nonetheless, as an industry, we can no longer turn a blind-eye or deaf-ear to this known problem; indeed, we will share additional information indicating that the final key factor contributing to the failed studies phenomenon may be looking us right in the eye.
