No stinking business please'\n\nArohi doesn't want to stay in Shimla anymore so BM taking her to Bombay with her so that she may also get a chance to pursue her career here' Arjun doesn't know about it and he doesn't anymore go to P&M office or stays in the mansion' He stays in their old house' he only lives to fulfill Arohi's dream and make her happy in any way' He is shattered and a wreck' The pain he had given her in the heat of the moment, haunts him now'\n\nArohi doesn't talk about Arjun at all' but Arjun is all she thinks about' Arohi knows that Arjun knows about her accident and the the truth' She knows he still loves her but then so much has transpired between them that now it would be really very very difficult or even close to impossible for them to cover the distance between them'Her wounds are fresh'. Yet she can't help but wonder that why didn't he ever try to meet her even once?? But then dejectedly laughing on herself brushes it away as she remembers he had said that whether she lives or dies it won't affect her'\n\nThe land deal issue is out in open and P&M is accused for fraud' since the studio was to be made on Arjun's name he is the main accused' Savita has warned him about it and he knows the proceedings are on but he doesn't care' DK has hired the best lawyer for him but Arjun doesn't co-operate at all' On Savita's insistence Arjun had agreed to co-operate with the proceedings of the case' Savita has denied him to meet Arohi but regularly updates him on her recovery' She knows he's repenting but she can't help it' She doesn't want to hurt Arohi'\n\nSalil and poorvi are just back from their honeymoon and Salil finds out everything that's happened in Arjun's life and regarding Arohi from Aman and Nikhil'\n\nIt's the final court hearing day and today itself Arohi is leaving Shimla' Arjun doesn't know this and Savita didn't tell him because she knows if Arjun comes to know about it he would definitely miss his hearing' DK has begged Arjun to be there on time but Arjun gave in only because he had promised Savita'\n\nHe is in his car driving to the court when Salil calls him up and apologizes for not being there when he needed him the most' Arjun apologizes too for not supporting him in his decision of marrying Poorvi' Arjun enquires about Poorvi too' Salil tells him that Poorvi has gone to Sukh Niwas since Arohi is leaving for Mumbai today' Arjun all shocked (one more car stunt here) applies the brakes immediately' He further enquires about when is she leaving and Salil informs him that her train is in an hour's time or so' Arjun immediately starts towards the railway station' Last evening's snowfall has blocked many ways and traffic is slow too' but he manages to reach the station in time' he wonders why Savita didn't tell him that they are leaving for Mumbai' He frantically tries to look out for Arohi' All the while her smiling face and their moments together flashes in front of his eyes' DK calls him to know when is he reaching the court but Arjun refuses to come' DK warns him of the consequences and pleads with him to come' As he is talking to DK he spots Savita and Arohi standing in one corner' He cuts DK's call and move towards them' Other side DK tries reaching him again but to no avail' Since Arjun misses the hearing court announces its decision against Arjun' Arjun is to be arrested and jailed! (Maybe Anjana would be a better help here' I don't understand law much' so please excuse me here)\n\nOn the other side at the station' Arjun moves towards Arohi' Savita spots him and tells Arohi to be here and that she'll be back in a while' Savita questions Arjun but he ignores all' Silent tears flowing down his eyes he begs his mom to let him meet Arohi once' Reluctantly Savita gives in and moves away'\n\nArohi here is lost in Arjun's thoughts' thinking that after this moment we'll never meet probably' she is remembering all their fights, Arjun holding her hand, he kissing her forehead, she resting her head on his chest, she irritating him, he insulting her, he being a gentleman in rain, he teasing her' and a sad smile comes on her lips' A tear drops from her eyes when she realizes that leaving Shimla is also like cutting the last chord between them'She shuts her eyes' oblivious to her surroundings she is just about to loose her balance as a kid who was trying to run away from his mother's grip runs into her' But before she could fall a strong pair of arm holds her and prevent her fall' Arjun remembers their first meeting where she had held on to him to prevent a fall' time stands still for Arjun once again'\n\nArohi scared as a child still clutching on to the stranger's arm balances herself'\n\nArohi: Thank you' aapne mujhe girne se bacha liya'\n\nArjun doesn't speak a word' just keep looking at her angelic face'He thinks it's the same face that he had fallen in love with not so long ago' it's the same face he can see whenever he shuts his eyes' it still has the same innocence' its still so serene' so calm' yet it has lost its glow' He looks at her eyes and remembers when he had said that hers are the most beautiful eyes and he never can see tears in her eyes' he then remembers when he had wiped out her tears only to cause more pain' he remembers the tears that just couldn't stop after he announced his engagement to Nutts when he had insulted her' these eyes are still so pure' He remembers when she had confessed her deepest feelings to her how much her eyes had shone that day' The eyes that had once shone with love so deep just for him doesn't shine anymore' its lifeless!!! Unable to contain his pain he shuts his eyes still holding her' Arohi is feeling weird and secured at the same time' Something inside her wants to be like this forever' but something wanted to run away'. She wonders who's the person and is just about to ask him to leave her when she feels the drop of tear falling on her hand'\n\nArohi: Aap ro rahe hai??\n\nSavita who had seen Arohi about to fall and Arjun trying to balance her come quickly at Arohi' side to enquire whether she's fine'. And when Arohi asks him whether he's crying' Savita rescues him by replying'\n\nSavita: Arohi beta yeh station hai apno se door jaane ka gham toh sabhi ko hota hai na' (Arjun doesn't say a word yet just looks at his mother with gratitude' Arjun looks at Savita pleading her for a little more time' seeing no choice she says) Arohi main pani leke aati hoon' and asks Arjun to take care of her in the meanwhile'.\n\nWhile Savita is away Arjun turns to Arohi' he desperately want to tell her that its him' that he's back' he wants to hold her tight' doesn't want to let her go' but'\n\nArohi: lagta hai aapka koi apna aapse door jaa raha hai'\n\nArjun: (tears run down his face) hmm'\n\n(He smiles a little at her' when he remembers the moment when he had held her close against her wishes when he wanted to shoo Unty away ' He also observes her concern even for a stranger' he remembers the time when she had helped him to get home after he had got drunk and couldn't even stand')\n\nArohi: Kitni Azeeb baat hain na wahan aapka koi apna door ja raha hai' aur yahan main kisi apne se humesha ke liye door ja rahi hoon' dekha jaye toh door toh woh kab ka ja chukka hai' lekin kehte hain apno ko ro kar nahin hass kar goodbye kehna chahiye'\n\nArohi doesn't know why she is saying all this to this guy' and on the other hand Arjun remembers the moment when Arohi had got him to smile' He can feel everything slipping away from his hands'\n\nArohi: Aap itne chup kyun hai?\n\nArjun opens his mouth to speak something but thinking better of it closes it again'\n\nArohi: Main bachpan se Shimla main hi rahi hoon'yehi meri duniya thi lekin aaj waqt aur haalat aise nahin ki main yahan reh sakoon'isiliye main apna sab kuch peeche chod ke ja rahi hoon' aap udaas hai kyunki aapka koi apna ja raha hai' lekin uske wapis aane ki umeed toh hogi'\n\nArjun remembers the cliff scene where Arohi had said that she won't turn her back on her love' she'll give it a chance and he had turned his back to her and walked away' Though Arjun tries to hold back yet a stifled cry escapes' which makes Arohi restless\n\nArohi: Dekhiye main yeh toh nahin jaanti ke aapko kya dard hai lekin itna zaroor kahoongi ki dard hi hai jo apko jeene ke ehsaas dilata hai'\n\nJust then the railway announcement is made and Savita comes back'\n\nSavita: Chalo beta Arohi' train ka time ho gaya hai'\n\nHelplessly both Savita and Arjun look at each other' With tears in her eyes Savita pats Arjun's head' to which Arjun understandingly nods'\n\nArohi: Ji Badi Ma (Arjun helps them till their compartment' Arohi is about to go in but thinks something and turns back' reaching out for the stranger guy' Arohi is in the train while Arjun is on the platform' she moves her hand around her neck and unties her OM pendant) Haath badaiye' Yeh pendant mujhe meri Maa ne diya tha' kaha tha ki umeed kabhi nahin chodni chahiye' Mere har achche bure waqt main yeh mere saath tha magar ab shayad mujhe iski koi zaroorat nahin' she holds his hand and put the pendant in his hand and he holds her hand tightly yet so softly for the last time' here the realization dawns upon her' Not ready to let go she expectantly says Arjun' as a tear rolls down her face' Her eyes once again expressed her undying and selfless love for him' Arjun intently looks at her trying to capture the smallest detail of her face to treasure it for the rest of his life' He wanted time to stop'.all their moments together are running in Arohi's mind' when she feels Badi Maa nudging her to get in' and Arjun leaves her hand and turns to go' The train starts' and he clasps the OM tight and turns to get her glimpse but couldn't see her anymore' There still at the doorside with Savita beside her' Arohi crying, speaks aloud \"Ek baar rukne ko keh ke to dekhte Arjun\"\n\nOn the other end Arjun is arrested!!!\n\nArjun-Natasha Engagement\n\n(REF: May 5th 2009-after Arohi is humiliated by Arjun)\n\n-Manisha\n\nAs she steps into the lift.. she remembers Arjun's words \"lift ka color badal jana chahiye\" all the sweet memories comes back to her... the way he said ILU.. the way he held her hand n took her away... she closes her eyes.. tears flowing down.. she reaches the floor.. she wipes of tears.. goes to her cabin n calls up interior decorators.. she tries to concentrate on her work.. but she cudnt all the happy memories keep coming back.. she all hurt n sad.. whenever she sees Arjun.. tears just spring up in her eyes.. but she wipes them out.. she doesnt want Arjun 2 c them... she moves her face away from Arjun every time he confronts her.. not because she does not want 2 face him but becoz she does not want him 2 see her puffy n red eyes.. Arjun cud sense something amiss every time Arohi avoids Arjun's gaze but tries to think it otherwise.. he reminds himself all he want is to never let Aro back in his life n the engagement wud b the end of it.. he is quite sure of it n he does not want any stone left unturned to make that final blow at Aro..\n\nOn the day of engagement, he calls Aro.. he makes her incharge to serve the guests.. this way he made sure she wud always get the pinch.. at the moment of ring ceremony, with a sly smile he calls Aro on stage telling guests that she is his most imp friend n the ceremony wudnt mean anything without her.. she tries to avoid him but he makes her come on the stage.. Aro closes her eyes touches her Om n goes up.. she tries to keep her gaze down, but he makes her look at him.. and when he looks at her, he is all shocked.. suddenly something starts pinching him.. his eyes become all wet n a tear rolls down his face.. aah.. is this same Aro.. her eyes all puffed up n red, face pale, lips all dry n parched.. oh my god.. wat has he done 2 her.. his hands tremble n the ring slips from his fingers n rolls down the floor.. Aro quickly turns away, steps down, n goes behind one of the curtains as she cudnt stop tears rolling down her face.. nuts glances at arjun all perplexed n gives a fleeting look at rushing Aro.. DK quickly goes by his son's side quickly wipes out his tear n tells him to control himself n reminds him this wud b the end of all his miseries n pain.. 2 just go ahead.. Arjun is not sure of it though.. he feels something is tearing him apart.. something deep inside has again started piercing him constantly.. his mind is all blank.. he cant think of anything n just follows his Dads orders.. he takes the ring n goes on with the ceremony disheartened giving a last glance where Aro is hidden.. Aro hears the applause.. something stirred up deep inside her.. she cannot bear the sound of applause.. her hands searches for support.. she wanted 2 scream out loud, but it just remained trapped inside her.. she shuts her eyes tightly, holds on to her Om.. she cudnt control.. tears starts flowing down constantly.. nothing cud lessen the grief that she felt right now... she hears applause subsiding...she lets those final tears roll down... composes herself.. wipes down her tears.. tries to smile n comes out.. she starts asking n serving the happy guests.. she reaches where Arjun n Nutts r standing.. recieving greetings n gifts.. suddenly a sharp pain shoots up n there is a sudden surge of tears.. she controls hard.. keeps those tears away... slowly moves up to them.. n asks nutts.. \"aap kya lengi, madam\" Arjun again feels that constant piercing pain, which hadnt left him a bit, but this time its even more painful... Nutts orders something n with a faint smile Aro asks the waiter 2 serve her.. Aro slowly turns towards Arjun.. She looks in to his eyes n asks \"aap kya lenge, Sir\"... those words, her almost tearful eyes, n her look gives him such a stab.. wrinkles creep up on his forehead, his eyes become turbulent, he searches her eyes for something solacing but all he cud see is deep unrelenting pain.. he just cant bear it n turns away his face n nods No slightly... Aro feels something.. senses a faint hope.. wants to step forward.. but then sees nutts moving towards him.. n she quickly pushes away that thought.. all sad once again, she turns n goes away.. Arjun turns around n watches her go n suddenly he feels he has lost everything... suddenly there is a vacuum inside him... vast emptiness surrounds him... everything seems worthless.. even his own breath.. he closes his eyes n all he cud see is Aro smiling..\n\nNanha Munha Arjun cried\n\n-Sonia\n\nArjun crying in his room and daddy dear enter😭!\n\nDD: Arjun beta tum ro kyun rahe ho??\n\nArjun: Dad apne dekha Arohi ko😭'\n\nDD: Arjun roz office main main usse dekhta hoon.. toh😕??\n\nArjun: (Ghoorofying his dad😳) Aap Arohi ko roz office main dekhte hain😲??

Sonia\n\nEver Since, I heard you'\n\nI felt you through your words\n\nour melody struck the chords\n\nI knew there was something\n\nthat binds me to you\n\nEver Since, I saw you'\n\nI knew you were different\n\nPure blissful eyes so innocent\n\nI knew I could do nothing more\n\nTo keep my thoughts from you\n\nEver Since, I touched you'\n\nFor once I felt so alive\n\nThat now I desired to live\n\nA beautiful life of dreams\n\nSo that I could grow old with you\n\nEver since, I doubted you'\n\nI lost my faith completely\n\nI grieved my broken heart silently\n\nI was blinded by wrong\n\nSo I didn't give a chance to you\n\nEver Since, I parted from you'\n\nMy heart felt sore and was bleeding\n\nFor you, it was pleading\n\nBut I thought I was betrayed in love\n\nAnd I wanted to avenge you\n\nEver Since, I have hurt you'\n\nI knew nothing would ever pain me more\n\nI could see you silently implore\n\nFor a reason that I never offered\n\nBefore my shutting my doors to you\n\nEver Since, I knew the truth'\n\nI have cursed myself day and night\n\nNow that I know that you were right\n\nI wish I could wipe out all the bitterness\n\nAnd bring happiness to you\n\nEver Since, you left me'\n\nMy heart don't bleed anymore\n\nI can feel pain no more\n\nFor it was gone numb\n\nAnd I know I don't deserve you\n\nEver Since, I lost you'\n\nI knew there's no meaning left to life\n\nBut I will live to feel the grief so rife\n\nSo what if I can't start afresh\n\nI'll still live my life for you\n\nEk apple ki kahani...\n\n-Aruna(wishfor)\n\nAnd the apple says..\n\nHer
