        "text": "Have you ever been curious as to what goes on in the life of a pilot? We see them walk up in uniform, black designated carry on in tow, primped and ready to steer the flying vessel that gets you from A to B. For years I personally wanted to find out about the life of a pilot, garnering a stockpile of questions to ask about the logistics of flying, domestically and abroad, but never really thought I would end up dating one. Now all my curiosities have been satiated.\n\nFortunately I have been able to travel the world over for many years, and now, with the good fortune of having my beloved at the helm of a jet liner. To experience the life of a pilot is something I admire. Yet, to say it’s an easy life to be a pilot or being apart of a flight crew is something we shouldn’t look blindly to. When duty calls, they need to absolutely ready and steadfast when making sure the plane gets to a destination. With that being said, allow me to share our trip to London.\n\nTom and I had just arrived back from spending a week in Budapest, which we quickly learned, is an absolutely fantastic city with rich cultural history. It became arbitrary [on my end at least] to have chosen Budapest not knowing how deep the past tyrannical blood runs through the veins of such a city. A strategic battleground for the Soviet and the Nazis, Budapest acquired a moment in history where their livelihood was nearly relinquished, all because of two egomaniacs and their push for imperialism. Budapest, a must do.\n\nWe just touched down back in Michigan and we knew there would be a chance he would have to fly that week in the event a pilot couldn’t make it in time. On call duties - suitcase packed ready to take flight when the call comes in. As we spent a few days in Michigan, he mentioned that if there was room on the plane I could come in tow. So naturally being the avid traveler and adventurer that I am, I too, packed a carry on, ready, and willing.\n\nTom was on call for a day, and so far it didn’t look like he was going to be summoned. We kept an eye on the schedule tracking the flights departing out of Chicago throughout the day. The last flight was scheduled for 10:20pm en route to London and at about 2:00pm we were thinking he might be in the clear. We met up with a friend of ours in downtown Kalamazoo for dinner at 6:00pm at a really neat restaurant where I had a glass of wine and Tom, did not. Though he was on the tail end of his call time, he wasn’t going to chance it. That’s why I love that man. After dinner, we went to another rooftop bar where we watched the sunset in the distance in what looked like pastel water colored mural bleeding in the sky.\n\nWe left downtown Kalamazoo on our way back to the house at 9:00pm assuming he wasn’t going to get called. His window was until 10:00pm so the percentage of him being called was at ten percent. Well, we walked in the door at 9:15pm and sure enough American Airlines rang his phone requesting his presence to man the plane from Chicago to London Heathrow. We checked every flight that day for room in case I was to tag along and luckily we did check this flight earlier that day for options. He kissed me and said he had to go, and I asked, “Aren’t I going?” At first his reply was he didn’t want me to feel obligated to go, and asked if I was sure I wanted to go. We all know the answer was yes. The two of us got into the car and off we drove to Chicago.\n\nIt takes approximately two and a half hours drive [with no traffic] to reach O’Hare, central time. It allotted us time to get there safely since we were on eastern standard time, not having to push the departure time further out for the already perturbed passengers (Little do they know all that goes into pulling an on call pilot from another state readily available within a short time frame). I put him in the passenger seat enabling him to input information and look over logistics while I focused on the road. Tom put me on the list, but was unable to check me in since we were already inside the two-hour mark for boarding. Ok, how can we go about this situation? Call the co-pilot who is already in the cockpit programming the computers and ask him if he could go to the ticketing agent to work some magic. Better yet, how about the supervisor being present. Luckily the supervisor was indeed present and magic happened. The boarding pass generated for me to pass through security when we arrived, easy right? Not quite.\n\nTom and I finally arrived at the time the plane was set to depart. Scurrying from the parking structure into the terminal, the place was desolate with no security gate open. There were a handful of humans around consisting of random flight attendants, terminal workers, and cleaners. We asked where we could go to pass through security and were instructed to proceed to the farthest point of the terminal for the only security clearance. As we walked up, it was only for those with lanyards to be granted access and I was a civilian. Tom obviously dressed in uniform (looking handsome I may add) easily passed through, but I was declined.\n\nNow Tom is not the type to pull the captain card out when flying (unless it’s obligation), or even as a civilian. It is only when it is absolutely necessary will he puff up his chest and utilize his position. In this case, after traveling so far, it was deemed appropriate. We told the agent I was a passenger on the plane, he was the captain of the plane, and the plane won’t leave unless I’m on it. The agent called his higher up and explained the situation to which he allowed me through but I was to be pat down before being fully admitted to clear, and by a woman. I told Tom to go ahead to the plane and I’d catch up. If it didn’t work out or it was taking too long, to just leave me behind and I would drive back to Michigan. Fortunately, there was a female TSA agent that came to pat me down and not too long after, I ran like a puppy learning how to run through an empty terminal.\n\nThe plane was situated at the farthest point of the terminal, of course in the longest concourse, towards the very end. I could see Tom up ahead in the distance, walking at a comfortable pace while I’m the only person in the terminal clinking my boots running behind. (If you could imagine, I was trying not to laugh at the same time being a pure witness of the scene). There she was, the Dreamliner parked waiting for captain Tom Huitema to take over. With no other planes around, passengers boarded, crew ready, and at this very moment, we were only twenty minutes passed the scheduled departure time.\n\nTom had just boarded the plane as I ran up to the ticketing counter. A handful of staff members were closing down, printing out the final count and the supervisor, a tall Sikh Indian named Raj whipped out the master key to the door of the jet bridge and in I went. As I sped walked down the jet bridge, I was greeted by the smiling flight attendants saying, “Are you the Uber driver?” Alas, as patient as they were it was time to get the show on the road. “Yes, yes I’m the Uber driver,” I said with a smile on my face as they directed me to my seat.\n\nWhen I finally sat down, the guy sitting next to me said, “You’re late.” I could tell the passengers were slightly annoyed and I understand why, no one wants to wait on a plane, no one wants a delay. As I began to get comfortable, I turned to him, slightly loud enough for others to hear [knowing they are wanting] some sort of explanation, I replied back, “Yeah I just drove your captain here from Michigan, sorry.” His demeanor quickly evolved and his condescending remark morphed into a curious and grateful expression. In a nonchalant manner, I filled him and the passengers behind me in as to why we were delayed. Their frustration turned into appreciation and said I deserved a first class seat. I replied with, “I’m just happy to be on the plane and there was a seat available.” No later than ten minutes, Tom came on the intercom introducing him self, giving a brief explanation of the delay, and reassuring the passengers we’d be in London within minutes of the scheduled arrival time. By 11:00pm we left Chicago O’Hare.\n\nFrom Chicago O’Hare it’s a quick fly over to London, approximately six hours and forty-five minutes. In the years I have traveled, it is quite difficult for me to sleep sitting up. The flight attendants took great care of me, and when I did manage to dose off, Tom came up to say hi. He was on his break and informed me on where to go after we deplane at LHR. If you’re an avid traveler, you’re aware most flight crews have a different procedure than civilians. He told me where they were staying in the city and later on one of the flight attendants came to me with the hotel name and underground stop. Upon arrival, I quickly saw Tom as I left the plane, gave him a hug and kiss, breezed through customs, and headed to the underground.\n\nLondon.\n\nAs I began my journey on the underground, sitting in the carriage observing humanity interacting with their phones, I reminisced of my time well spent in the city. The musty smell of the stale seats, the notorious ‘Mind the gap,’ the breeze of the tube shooting through the tunnels like the old bank monetary transactions, and the constant labyrinths giving way for our agendas to reconvene into the abyss of bodies above the underworld.\n\nWhen I was nineteen years old, I began traveling to London frequently and it became my second home. Every time I landed at Heathrow airport, there was a routine and a familiar feeling. Staying with family in west London to the point where I practically lived there. I had stuff there at home and my go to would be, “See you next week.” I spent more time there than I did back in California and as much I loved London, I simply grew out of it.\n\nIt has been a several years since I’ve explored the city and as I sat in the tube, I realized there were so many places I never went to explore. Por exempla, the area I was en route to meet my main squeeze was Kensington Gardens. How could I miss Kensington? The answer being I was a west London girl and as we all know, when you live in a city, you don’t really explore it because you’re not in the tourist mentality. Furthermore, everything was in the central part of the city and I would go into the city for fun and do all the normal living activities where I was based, East Acton.\n\nWhen I finally arrived at the designated underground, I walked out into a quant yet bustling area of Kensington. With my suitcase in tow, I entered the hotel lobby and there he was sitting waiting for me. He too had just arrived from the airport, chirpy, yet exhausted. I wanted to hit the ground running, but the body was telling me otherwise. The decision was made to go up and take a nap prior to cruising around town. I couldn’t sleep. We figured one hour would be enough, but my bug eyes closed for a maximum of thirty minutes and I was ready. He puts up with me.\n\nMaking our way down from the room, we stopped by a pub attached to the hotel where it seemed to be the crossroads for yanks and the sorts to congregate having a pint mingling amongst one another. Tom and I took a quick lap around and continued on into the streets in the direction of Hyde Park. We both have busy lives despite taking mini holidays with each other so it was nice to spend extra time with him for another quick adventure. We strolled through a few posh nooks in and around the area on our way to Hyde Park. With it being September and in transition from summer to autumn, the weather was favorable with a moderate temperature. We held hands walking through the collected enthusiasts enjoying their free time shy of dusky skies, enjoying a Sunday fun day.\n\nWalking across the park with no particular direction, we began to feel rather exhausted. The short two-mile walk put us through such a grueling and rigorous exercise, and we felt it was imperative to rest somewhere in company with quenching our thirst. We began our desperate search to find a place that would be a safe haven to relic in such necessities of life. Just moments before we were to collapse on the road, wondering where the next drink would come from, an intriguing mirage of dark wood, a few chairs, tables set up outside, a corner entry, and a sign that said, “PUB” allured us from our long journey. Bequeathed upon us was a gift from the heavens above, and without question, we entered the doorway to a satiating array of beverages and captivating smells that tickled our nose hairs. The pub even offered up grape juice, to which I knew, we have been blessed.\n\nTom and I hung out at the pub having an early drink of beer and wine. He felt it would be rather insulting if he didn’t have fish n’ chips while in England, and being the appreciative man that he is, a kind fixing bestowed upon our table. Add a few spices in conjunction with tasty condiments, and the plate didn’t last long enough to garner an Instagram appearance. We felt complete for the time being and off we went back on our pilgrimage across Hyde Park once again taking in the sights and sounds of humanity enjoying their early evening amusement. It was nice to feel the day turn into night as we observed the sunset melting away into the dark blue skies.\n\nWhen we arrived back at the hotel, our window to wander about was slowly dwindling. I was gifted a bottle of wine from the lovely flight attendants, and of course we didn’t want it to go to waste. He had to be in bed in a few hours to collect an appropriate amount of time to sleep and be fresh for the return back to Chicago in the morning. We had a glass of wine while prepping in the room for our evening meal at an Indian restaurant. Tom had visited this restaurant before on a previous trip and initially, he had that restaurant mind, but we ended up walking down the road to another Indian restaurant. It was within the same distance in the opposite direction, which was absolutely tasty. I love Indian food. We made the most of the afternoon and the weather contributed to such an afternoon of strolling through Kensington for a mini getaway. It was time to cash in our Sunday fun day adventure and crawl into bed.\n\nThe tentative plan was to fly back on his flight to Chicago in the late morning, but the load wasn’t looking too promising. My other option was to take the last flight out at 5:00pm in the evening with nearly one third of the plane vacant, meaning I was guaranteed on with a damn good chance I would have a whole row to myself. I opted for the latter. We got dressed, packed our belongings, and made our way to the lobby where he was being picked up with the rest of the flight crew while I decided I was going into the city to walk around.\n\nNow picture this, here’s a six foot five blonde hair blue eyed [handsome] captain going down to meet his flight crew who were all in uniform. Along with this captain, is his girlfriend next to him who is five foot five in a tank top and shorts, having a little pep in her step, carrying a small backpack standing around with a group of airline hostesses and the pilots. Just picture it, because we found it to be rather amusing. I gave him a kiss and said adios as I scampered to the underground with Covent Gardens in mind, my old stomping grounds. As I arose from the tube, the recollection of memories nudged my heart.\n\nIt has been fourteen years since I’ve experienced the cobble stone streets of this trendy hamlet. With no particular plan in mind other than to meander the streets, maybe have a coffee at a café, I found an H&M to which was perfect as I recognized the ticklish sensation from the slightly chill breeze. Usually, as one does when shopping H&M, I came out on top with a yellow sweater and a paperboy hat that I couldn’t pass up. Dressed with a bit more pizazz to enhance my ensemble, my journey carried me to Leicester Square, Piccadilly Circus, down to Buckingham Palace, and across St. James Park. Here I was again, older, and seeing it with the same eyes but carrying a different perspective, I checked my Google map and it showed a few underground locations to make my way back towards Kensington. I reflected on the distance I’ve come to manage already, and I figured, “What the hell?” and carried on for another hour walking.\n\nBy this time it was noontime and I felt a bit hungry to some degree but not enough to stop anywhere. I simply wanted to keep walking and see how far I could go within the time frame. I couldn’t use my phone cause I don’t have international (unless on Wi-Fi of course) services, but I paid attention to the direction I was going and as long as I found an underground entrance, it would be no sweat. Nonetheless, I did not want to cut it close heading back and checking into the flight in the event of any hiccups. After another hour of walking, I played it safe and found an entrance to head back to Kensington Gardens to collect my suitcase at the hotel and make my way to Heathrow. Security at Heathrow is quite lengthy and it was in my best interest to be there a couple hours before hand.\n\nThere I was, hanging out in Admirals club, finally eating some food, and doing a bit of reading. When it was time to head to the gate to get my seat, I walked up the agent and said, “Heard there’s room in the back, how’s it looking?” Not only to my delight, but rather, many others, the flight was half full. I would go out on a limb in saying it looked like half the plane had a whole row to themselves. Tom had several hours to wait as our plane was bringing up the rear. Chicago traffic is rather horrendous and daunting anyway, so he didn’t mind. When I landed, it was easy breezy through Global Entry and my chauffeur came in a moments notice. We bypassed the traffic as I flew in around 8:30pm and off we went, driving into the night back to Michigan. Twenty Four hours later.\n\n​'New York concrete jungle where dreams are made of’ - Alicia Keys.\n\n​\n\nIt has been approximately nine years since I visited NYC, and this time I managed to stay for five days. People love New York with its scurrying lifestyle, hip and trendy bars, joints, neighborhoods, and active movement. It is active and I would say as I walked around the city, I felt like an ant moving throughout a steroid injected ant farm people watching while minding my own business. David Bowie once said, ‘You can have a normal life in New York.’ You can, but it depends on your definition of a normal life.\n\nSo, why New York to yoga hop? Well, I flew out there to visit a girlfriend of mine whom I met in Jamaica a few years back at the eco-retreat I teach at from time to time (Go Natual (www.gonaturaljamaica.com/). We keep in touch regularly through Facebook, and face time. She met up with me while I was in Thailand a couple years back and offered the invitation several times to visit her in New York. After two years, I finally made the effort.\n\nStaying true to my name ‘Traveling Yoginista', I was keen to check out a few yoga studios that I have heard of to get a feel of the environment and get a practice in. The glory of travel is to experience yoga on my own terms, and there are times I don’t go to any yoga studios, and practice alone. Then there are times I just soak it all in at different locations. Tasting the different environments altogether. Though I coined the name ‘Traveling Yoginista’, it doesn’t make me any different then of those who travel and teach as well. I have said many times over, we are all Traveling Yoginistas.\n\nI started writing this blog on the last day of my trip to NYC and I’m currently on a dive trip on Roatan Island, off the coast of Honduras. It’s a nice quiet night here with a settling breeze coming from the east. I met up with my boyfriend in Miami en route to the island, and booked a week stay at Tobri Divers, managed and operated by a lovely couple that I met in Thailand in 2013. But, let’s get back to the yoga in NYC.\n\nI flew to New York on a Saturday morning from San Diego arriving in the afternoon to visit my girlfriend, Irina. I took an Uber pool from JFK and met two other passengers who happen to be from San Diego as well. We talked about growing up and traveling abroad, agreeing how many people in San Diego (and I’m sure in many other parts of the country and the world), people don’t leave the comfort of their surroundings. After an hour or so picking up and dropping off in Brooklyn, I finally made it to the financial district to Irina's place.\n\nIt was wonderful to catch up and the first thing we did was walk over to a Russian bathhouse about a ten-minute walk from her place. Interesting place it was as you walk down a few steps into a mediocre lobby to check in and grab a key. I have to say though, for the price you pay, it’s a gem. Nothing bourgeoisie about it; and that’s precisely what made the place quite awesome and worth every dollar. It had a bar slash café slash restaurant slash plastic outdoor (apparently indoor too) chairs slash you can order whatever you wish in your bathing suit seating area that was not segregated from male to female. Russian plaques and signs were hanging all over the walls, TVs, a concoction of foreign languages being spoken, primarily, you guessed it, Russian.\n\nApart from the slash after slash after slash all in one dining area, you also had your set of different sweat rooms from Russian to Turkish to traditional sauna as well as a selection of steam rooms, topped off with the ice drop to psych out the body; there was also a full size pool and a Jacuzzi, all underneath a building. To top off the bathhouse experience, a VIP room with dark lighting and sultry 90’s era booths for your ultimate night out. Surprisingly there were quite a bit of people there and it was a fun time. Irina said it’s not as busy as it usually is and I’m sure glad it wasn’t because the amount of humans that were utilizing the fun zone was enough for me.\n\n​ We started out by ordering food at the bar, then went to the Jacuzzi for 30 minutes followed by eating our meal in bikinis and towels in the café, grabbing a glass of red wine, moving onto the saunas, and a steamer for a night cap. Overall, I have to give this place a 5 star rating not because of the fancy décor, but purely by the come all be all invitation of enjoying yourself offerings. I definitely would like to go back, that’s not a bad way to spend your Saturday night.\n\nThe following day, Irina took me to a place called Y7 in Soho which was the first yoga studio experience. She mentioned it was her favorite place to practice because they play hiphop music during the practice. I play some hiphop songs when I teach, but not full on. We jumped in a Via cab and took the 10 minute jaunt over to the studio and unfortunately it was full at 10 am. The girl at the front desk said for us to wait just in case a few people don’t show up and we could get a spot. In the knick of time and at the last minute, Irina and I were able to get a place in the dark room to begin our practice.\n\nThe class we took had 3 flows. We started with a build up of holding the postures, followed by another round of adding breath to movement. Once we picked up the flow, we were given 5-7 minutes to practice the flow on our own. That’s when the hardcore hiphop came on, and loud to add. Each flow was slightly different then the previous and due to it being so dark, everyone was in their own element and on their own pace. If you like hiphop, this is your place.\n\nY7 Yoga Studio – Soho\n\n430 Broome St. New York\n\nStudio – Loft like. Walk up a flight of stairs into a small lobby. Décor is minimal but airy and fresh with hiphop beats in the back round. The front desk is nestled in the middle of the space, and it can get crowded quite quickly due to the small space.\n\nBathroom/Shower – Only one shower and two bathrooms\n\nSpace – Lobby all white. Small but spacious and clean.\n\nRoom - Dark, candle lit with a huge “A tribe called Sweat” logo painted in the center. Probably holds 30 people mat to mat. Heated, hip hop music varies.\n\nClass – Vinyasa Flow 60 minutes.\n\nAfter finishing our class at Y7, Irina and I went back to her place to freshen up before heading out on the town. First we had lunch along side the river before heading over to One World Observatory to see the views on the only clear day I was in town. We went to Central Park (per the usual tourist and normal city folk do to), sat on the grass having ourselves some Ice Tea Lattes, walked around for a little bit before heading back to her place. The day ended with a lovely dinner for two Irina put together followed by some Hulu before calling it an evening. A little over 24 hours into my trip so far and it was just swimmingly perfect.\n\nUntil my next blog of another yoga studio experience.\n\nOne Love.\n\nDecember 2015\n\nThis blog is dedicated for those who suffer from Hypothyroidism and Hyperthyroidism. What is it? How does yoga help? I'm currently in Jamaica teaching yoga at retreat on the most eastern side of the island. Just recently we had a guest, who suffered from hypothyroidism. She was of Indian descent, early 40's, vibrant personality, well traveled (alone for that matter), and came to spend 9 days at the retreat. The first few days we did Yin yoga with a few other guests but as everyone left, she was the only at the retreat, so essentially she had personal care and private yoga sessions. She had gained weight in the waist area and wanted to get back into the swing of things increasing her metabolism, as well as getting back into her regular yoga practice. So, I had asked her if she would be my case study in regards to thyroidism and she was inclined.\n\nOk so what is Hypo/Hyper? What is the difference between the two let alone knowing what the thyroid gland is and it's functionality? The thyroid is a butterfly shaped gland that sits low in the throat, in front of the windpipe and just below the Adam's apple. The thyroid is apart of the endocrine system, a series of glands that produce hormones that regulate metabolism, growth and development, tissues, sexual energy, reproduction, sleep cycle, and moods. Each gland produces X amount of hormones that send and deliver messages to produce particular hormones for a function and/or multiple functions. In this blog, we are solely focusing on the thyroid, it's operational system of what is produced, how it's effecting the body and learning ways through yoga, to counter act when the thyroid fails to do it's work properly. I'm not going to really tap into the parathyroid function as it's not entirely conducive to the topic though relative. Keep in mind, I'm writing this blog for anyone and everyone to understand in the most generic terms who may be suffering from Thyroidism, and what are some of the ways to work with it, essentially to get the motor running smoothly again.\n\nThe main hormones that are secreted are the Triiodothyronine - T3 hormone and Thyroxine - T4. The thyroid first extracts iodine from food intake, combines it with a non essential amino acid called Tyrosine to synthesize the protein and thus, producing these two particular hormones. T3 and T4 then travels throughout the blood stream to regulate the metabolism.\n\nHypothyroidism - Slow Metabolism - Lack of T3/T4\n\nFatigue/Lethargy\n\nWeight Gain\n\nIrritable\n\nDepression\n\nAbnormal Menstruation\n\nLow Libido\n\nMuscle Aches\n\nCold Intolerance\n\nNo Fun. :-(\n\nHyperthyroidism - Fast Metabolism - Increased T3/T4\n\nMood Swings\n\nTrouble Sleeping\n\nDry Skin\n\nWeight Loss\n\nAbnormal Menstruation\n\nIrregular heart beat\n\nHand tremors\n\nHeart Palpitations\n\nAgain...... No fun. :-(\n\nHere's where the hypothalamus comes into play. Though the pituitary gland monitors the thyroid, it's the hypothalamus who sends messages to the pituitary to regulate the thyroid if it's under active or over active. The hypothalamus will release the Thyroid Stimulating Hormone to the pituitary which will then activate the thyroid to manufacture more or less of the T3 and T4 if it's inconsistent. It's like when air traffic control informs pilots in an airplane they are cleared for the approach. The pilots then configure the airplane for landing. Although the thyroid is working regardless, the hypothalamus is the one to signal. Somewhat the easiest analogy I could come up with, hopefully you get the idea.\n\nHow does yoga help? Yoga is a science, and your body is a study. Here are some postures that have been known in the yoga world to stimulate the thyroid and combat any dis-ease in the body in regards particularly to thyroidism. Keep in mind, with the extensive research I have done, along with the case study, I have not seen any proven 100% guarantee or money back solidifying evidence that these postures, along with pranayama has completely cured thyroidism. I cannot stress enough, each person is case by case and it's up to the practitioner to take the initiative of doing their due diligence in combating this ailment by monitoring their progressions and of course, effort. It requires dedication to see results. With personal practice of mine, I have noticed with certain postures, such as the shoulder stand, it has decreased the excess skin around my waist with toning and provided me with fresh blood to the head, which felt invigorating.\n\nHowever, I have had some students who do not feel comfortable in shoulder stand, and have rather felt it does not help, and also I have read some controversy of it leading to a stroke. I'm not here to debate either or sell you on my conviction, it's up to you to rectify what you think works in your position should you ever battle thyroidism, this is just case study, practice, research, discussing, and alternative avenues to taking (or along with) western medication. I believe, combined with some western medicine and daily routine of yoga, along with breathing and eating right,a person would be able to alleviate such dis-ease as thyroidism. I say dis-ease because it is construed with symptoms, and signs of various ailments or matters of the body relating to pathology. So if you see symptoms in ailments, your body is un - easing, it's not comfortable.\n\nOk so here are some poses that have been regularly assigned to such a topic, and of course you can add other postures that are beneficial to you as a sequence. Here's the thing to look for, you will read some poses are for both hypo and hyper. Some 'experts' may say I'm completely wrong, while others will agree. You will also read some poses are only for hypo and/or only for hyper. I'm listing all and making well rounded. Decipher for yourself my friends.

Shameful word yet with so many convictions and interpretations. As it's been said many times over, it's all in the head, which is true. We have so many thoughts going through our mind, some 60,000 a day. Are you tired yet? And one painful experience many endure is depression.\n\nDefinition of Depression:\n\n*A mood disorder in which individual experience extreme unhappiness, lack of energy, and several related symptoms\n\n* Psycho pathogenic feeling of sadness; a decrease in vital functions\n\n* It is also described as a feeling of down heartedness or psycho physiological withdrawal in the event of a perceived threat.\n\nHere are the common causes of Depression:\n\n* Unhappy relationships\n\n* Redundancy\n\n* Resentment\n\n* Parenthood\n\n* Retirement\n\n* Loosing a loved on\n\n* Divorce\n\n* Failure at work\n\n* Illness\n\n* Children leaving home\n\n* Lethargy\n\n* Unaccomplished\n\n“Yoga is also something that can be very powerful in the treatment of depression,” - Dr. Turner.\n\nRelate to one? Two? Any? All of the above? I have. I can relate. I turned to yoga because I was going through a rut in my last relationship which turned out to be such a blessing now in my life, and I'll explain later. However, from personal experience, there are days where, what I call an 'emotional storm' passes through and I just become down. I know for certain it's simply my thought process, questioning myself, and analyzing patterns that I am sensitive to. I turned to yoga and it has been my therapy on many levels but people also turn onto different avenues to steer away the state of depression. What I have learned in yoga therapy, as we had discussions and experiences, preventative measures us humans can put in place to help subside these elements of depression for a more conscious and constructive way of life.\n\nPrior to signing up for my first certification a few years ago, I was emotional. I was lost, confused of my relationship and where I was going. My relationship which I thought was my savior was actually alienating me. One day, I walked into a workshop titled, 'Yoga for Emotions\" led by a woman who went through depression herself and there were a few moments during this workshop where I just wanted to cry. I felt connected to this type of yoga, it was therapy for me mentally, which has led me to where I am today writing this blog. I'm not a professional expert readers and I'm being frank. I don't have scientific proof of having studied years upon years of the bio-mechanics and in the medical field. But what I can say, on my own behalf, in order to be balanced you have to be able to go inward and identify what it is that draws depression to you.\n\nTake myself for example. Some days I'm easy peasy, very chill, and have an outlook like Lao Tzu, to believe in the way and what was meant to be will be. The drive I use to have when I was younger, that ego driven expression has taken a back seat. If there was something I wanted to make happen, I'd make it happen and no one would stop me. Does that not make me a go getter? Maybe to some body elses eyes. Yet, now in my 30s I feel, with the help of yoga, I have learned to witness what it is going on in my head and take the time to witness and observe versus react. I have also noticed with yoga on a mental aspect in observing others, the bouts of depression can hinder physical conditioning.\n\nWhat is the first thing some people like to do when they are depressed? Eat and eat a lot, OR, hit the gym and hit it hard. With depression comes alter of ego, depletion of hormones that are suppose to help us feel invigorating. Some of us can go zero to 60 mph in 1.5 seconds to default the depression by going into the gym, pretending to be happy, brushing it under the rug, drinking, or blaming others. Look, lets face it, we have to deal with our dramas regardless and there are so many ways to do so.\n\nNow as for yoga and depression, how can the yoga help prevent? Well first off, you have to be consciously aware of the 'disease' (dis - un ease - comfort) by what you do to your body, your mind set, surroundings including but not limited to who you surround yourself with. Secondly, how is your breathing pattern? I know we've barely touched on that aspect, but breathing is important. Controlled breathing is a wonderful aspect of knowing your state of mind. When you are depressed, do you smoke? Inhale the good shit, exhale the bullshit? Having been an ex-smoker myself, whenever I felt stressed out or depressed, I would smoke cigarettes for that oral fixation of physically feeling as if I'm letting go of what no longer serves. Then I was a habitual stoner, finding every reason to smoke week especially when I was depressed, to not think of the situation. I have since stopped smoking cigarettes from years ago, and I no longer smoke weed.\n\nHaving gone through yoga therapy certifications and learning the benefits of yoga, back bends are extremely beneficial for defeating depression. Invigorating movement of the spine, heart openers, chest openers, vulnerability turned powerful with the help of poses to deflect those triggers of depression. However that isn't the only key player, it's also identifying what it is that is possibly making you depressed, observing thoughts. Yoga means to yolk and combine so you have to be open to unifying these counterparts in order to alter the state of mind to release the right hormones, the feel good and rewarding hormones, like dopamine for one.\n\nFurthermore, yoga is beneficial for depression AND anxiety applying both back bends and forward bends. Depending on what you read, research, education, asking Mr. Google, etc you'll see several different case studies and suggestions about what postures are reflective benefits for depression. I had a case study back in Chiang Mai that I will use as a great example. There was a student who suffers from both anxiety and depression as well as admitting being a melomaniac, otherwise known as bipolar. People who suffer from anxiety, forward bends are recommended for introversion and calmness. Back bends are known for a counter productive use of depression. However, with this particular study it was an opposite effect so keep in mind it is a case by case basis and it's important to realize this per a persons emotional stability. I'm only merely suggesting what I learned, personal experience and it's up to you in your yogic journey of what will work entirely for your sake as well as guide others.\n\nAlong with the back bends, breathing is also very important. Techniques such as Ujjayi - The Victorious breathe and Kapalabhati - The Fire breathe or Skull Shining breathe. The Ujjayi breathe is a highly common technique used in the physical practice of yoga, controlled diaphragramatic breathing with a slight contraction in the back of the throat. Kapalabhati is learned technique that may take longer to pick up on, though it does look seemingly easy. The control rather is what makes it a 'technique' and the awareness it provides you with. Below I have demonstrated alternate nostril breathing known as Anuloma Viloma or Nadi Shodhana. It's closing the right nostril first breathing through the left nostril, close, and exhale through the right. Inhale through the right, close, exhale through the left, then inhale through left, close both nostrils and exhale through right. Universal breathing technique.\n\nHere is a list of postures you can practice to help in depression, and of course other magnificent benefits to menstruation, blood pressure, anxiety, etc. This blog is primarily in regards to depression, and I encourage you to apply these poses and breathing techniques on the daily. Please don't settle in the conviction that it only applies to one disease. That's the beauty of yoga, it's universal. Knowingly, each person is case by case, practice to your liking. Alternatively, you can also provide yourself with props for modified versions. I've highlighted the physiological aspects of the pose in aiding towards depression. Again, modify per your practice and bodily capability. I will touch base on anxiety next, and of course you will see many and multiple similarities as well capabilities for that disease as well applying postures. Any questions, please feel free to email me.\n\nOne Love and Bless Up\n\nDesiree\n\nBhujangasana - Cobra Pose\n\nStretches muscles in the shoulders, chest and abdominals\n\nDecreases stiffness of the lower back\n\nStrengthens the arms and shoulders\n\nIncreases flexibility\n\nImproves menstrual irregularities\n\nElevates mood\n\nFirms and tones the buttocks\n\nInvigorates the heart\n\nStimulates organs in the abdomen, like the kidneys\n\nRelieves stress and fatigue\n\nOpens the chest and helps to clear the passages of the heart and lungs\n\nImproves circulation of blood and oxygen, especially throughout the spinal and pelvic regions\n\nImproves digestion\n\nStrengthens the spine\n\nSoothes sciatica\n\nHelps to ease symptoms of asthma\n\nUstrasana - Camel Pose\n\nHelps to increase chest size and lungs capacity.\n\nBrings flexibility in chest, abdomen and neck.\n\nStimulates abdomen organs.\n\nImprove the function of the respiratory system.\n\nBeneficial for Asthma patient.\n\nActivate whole respiratory organs and nerves.\n\nCures problems related to Neck, Shoulders and back.\n\nCures Vata, Pitta and kapha dosha.\n\nStrengthens the back muscles.\n\nStimulate thyroid gland.\n\nReleases back pain.\n\nIncreases blood circulation to brain.\n\nHelps to improve Posture.\n\nReduce the fats on the stomach.\n\nImprove digestion.\n\n​ Setu Bandhasana - Bridge Pose\n\nStretches the chest, neck, spine, and hips\n\nStrengthens the back, buttocks, and hamstrings\n\nImproves circulation of blood\n\nHelps alleviate stress and mild depression\n\nCalms the brain and central nervous system\n\nStimulates the lungs, thyroid glands, and abdominal organs\n\nImproves digestion\n\nHelps relieve symptoms of menopause\n\nReduces backache and headache\n\nReduces fatigue, anxiety, and insomnia\n\nRejuvenates tired legs\n\nRelieves symptoms of asthma and high blood pressure\n\nTherapeutic for hypertension, osteoporosis, and sinusitis\n\nDhanurasana - Bow Pose\n\nEffective in weight loss.\n\nImproves digestion and appetite.\n\nHelps to cure dyspepsia (obesity), rheumatism and gastrointestinal problems.\n\nCures constipation.
