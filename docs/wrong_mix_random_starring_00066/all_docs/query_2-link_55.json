Make Bacchanal!\n\n. . .\n\n“Lord Shorty”, born Garfield Blackman in Lengua Village, Princess Town, Trinidad, is credited as one of the innovative calypsonians who modernized the music, picking up the tempo and adding more propulsive rhythms and instrumental arrangements – giving us Soca. During the same period (the mid-1970s) he also experimented with fusing Calypso and Indian music in Om Shanti Om. Though the song lyrics above (Endless Vibrations) may seem dated to us now – with their Hippy-&-Black-American-‘speak’ mixed in with the Trini – the overall sound of this song was fresh and inventive in its day.\n\nA musical blast from the past on this Monday–J’ouvert–of Carnival 2016!\n\nAnother innovator from the 1970s: The Mighty Shadow\n\nClassic Kaiso: “Bass Man” by The Mighty Shadow\n\n. . . . .\n\nKaiso – Calypso – Soca: Pepper It T&T-Style !\n\n.\n\nThrough great extemporaneous performers, singers, composers and arrangers, Calypso music has been evolving for more than a century. The Roaring Lion, Lord Invader, Lord Pretender, Lord Kitchener, Calypso Rose, Lord/Ras Shorty, David Rudder – the list could go on and on; so many have been innovators or have deepened the tradition. Political, social and sexual commentary, as well as a healthy joie-de-vivre for fête-ing, have all characterized Calypso. The music has branched out into Chutney Soca via Indian pioneers such as Drupatee Ramgoonai; has voyaged through temporary influences from Ragga and Dancehall; has even fallen prey to the ghastly Auto-Tune audio processor so rampant in popular music. Still, Calypso at its best – and it still can be at its best – can’t be beat. (Except maybe by Pan !)\n\n.\n\nJulian Whiterose’s “Iron Duke in the Land” – the first-ever Kaiso (Calypso) recording, from 1912:\n\n.\n\nLord Executor’s “I don’t know how de young men livin’” (1937):\n\nhttp://youtu.be/cD7N5qsPnuQ\n\n.\n\nLord Executor\n\n“I don’t know how de young men livin’” (1937)\n\n.\n\nI don’t know how de young men livin’, dey never have a shillin’,\n\nI don’t know how de young men livin’, dey never have a shillin’ –\n\nTommy, open de door, give me de bottle and lemme go,\n\nTommy, open de door, give me meh bottle and lemme go.\n\n.\n\nIn de day he walk ’bout, only comin’ with his sweet mouth.\n\nCalling for his minou, callin’ pound-plantain and callaloo – Ah,\n\nTommy, open de door, give me de bottle and lemme go,\n\nTommy, open de door, give me meh bottle and lemme go.\n\n.\n\nIn de night he come an’ peep, only longing for a place to sleep,\n\nAnd to cast his weary head as a lump of lead on de cosy bed – Ah,\n\nTommy, open de door, give me de bottle and lemme go,\n\nTommy, open de door, give me meh bottle and lemme go.\n\n.\n\nYou can see dat villain next day, half crazy and toutoulbey.\n\nHis watchikong, goodness knows, and half of his feet expose – Ah,\n\nTommy, open de door, give me de bottle and lemme go,\n\nTommy, open de door, give me meh bottle and lemme go.\n\n.\n\nWho can measure de human mind when it is uncultured and unrefined?\n\nAn impulse of society – and not to be mentioned in history!\n\nTommy, open de door, give me de bottle and lemme go,\n\nTommy, open de door, give me meh bottle and lemme go!\n\n.\n\n“Your calypso name is given to you by your peers, based on your style. In the old days they tried to emulate British royalty. There was Lord Kitchener, Lord Nelson, Duke. When I started singing, the bands were still using acoustic instruments and the singers would stand flat footed, making a point or accusing someone in the crowd with the pointing of a finger, but mostly they stood motionless. When I sing, I get excited and move around, much like James Brown – and that was new to them. The older singers said “Why don’t you just sing instead of hopping around like a little Sparrow.” It was said as a joke, but the name stuck.” (The Mighty Sparrow, interviewed)\n\nThe Mighty Sparrow’s “Jean and Dinah” (Yankees Gone) (1956):\n\n.\n\nCalypso Rose’s “Palet” (Popsicle) from the 1970s:\n\n.\n\nLord Shorty’s “Endless Vibrations”(1974):\n\nhttp://youtu.be/FPnsxU3vNRk\n\n.\n\nBlack Stalin (Leroy Calliste, born 1941, San Fernando, Trinidad)\n\n“Caribbean Unity” (1979)\n\n.\n\nYou try with a federation\n\nDe whole ting get in confusion\n\nCaricom and then Carifta\n\nBut some how ah smellin disaster\n\nMister West Indian politician\n\nI mean yuh went to big institution\n\nAnd how come you cyah unite 7 million?\n\nWhen ah West Indian unity I know is very easy\n\nIf you only rap to yuh people and tell dem like me – dem is:\n\n.\n\nOne race (de Caribbean man)\n\nFrom de same place (de Caribbean man)\n\nDat make de same trip (de Caribbean man)\n\nOn de same ship (de Caribbean man)\n\nSo we must push one common intention\n\nIs for a better life in de region\n\nFor we woman, and we children\n\nDat must be de ambition of de Caribbean man\n\nDe Caribbean man, de Caribbean man…\n\n.\n\nYou say dat de federation\n\nWas imported quite from England\n\nAnd you goin and form ah Carifta\n\nWith ah true West Indian flavour\n\nBut when Carifta started runnin\n\nMorning, noon and night all ah hearin\n\nIs just money-speech dem prime minister givin\n\nWell I say no set ah money could form ah unity\n\nFirst of all your people need their identity, like:\n\n.\n\nOne race (de Caribbean man)\n\nFrom de same place (de Caribbean man)\n\nDat make de same trip (de Caribbean man)\n\nOn de same ship (de Caribbean man)\n\nSo we must push one common intention\n\nIs for a better life in de region\n\nFor we woman, and we children\n\nDat must be de ambition of de Caribbean man\n\nDe Caribbean man, de Caribbean man…\n\n.\n\nCaricom is wastin time\n\nDe whole Caribbean gone blind\n\nIf we doh know from where we comin\n\nThen we cyah plan where we goin\n\nDats why some want to be communist\n\nBut then some want to be socialist\n\nAnd one set ah religion to add to de foolishness!\n\nLook, ah man who doh know his history\n\nHe have brought no unity\n\nHow could ah man who doh know his roots form his own ideology? – like:\n\n.\n\nOne race (de Caribbean man)\n\nFrom de same place (de Caribbean man)\n\nDat make de same trip (de Caribbean man)\n\nOn de same ship (de Caribbean man)\n\nSo we must push one common intention\n\nIs for a better life in de region\n\nFor we woman, and we children.\n\nDat must be de ambition of de Caribbean man\n\nDe Caribbean man, de Caribbean man…\n\n.\n\nDe Federation done dead and Carifta goin tuh bed\n\nBut de cult of de Rastafarian spreadin through de Caribbean\n\nIt have Rastas now in Grenada, it have Rastas now in St. Lucia,\n\nBut tuh run Carifta, yes you gettin pressure\n\nIf the Rastafari movement spreadin and Carifta dyin slow\n\nThen there’s somethin that Rasta done that dem politician doh know – that we:\n\n.\n\nOne race (de Caribbean man)\n\nFrom de same place (de Caribbean man)\n\nDat make de same trip (de Caribbean man)\n\nOn de same ship (de Caribbean man)\n\nSo we must push one common intention\n\nIs for a better life in de region\n\nFor we woman, and we children\n\nDat must be de ambition of de Caribbean man\n\nDe Caribbean man, de Caribbean man!\n\n.\n\nCaricom:\n\nThe Caribbean Community (CARICOM) is an organization of more than a dozen nations and dependencies, established during the 1970s.

Often, he has worn dark clothing with a broad-brimmed hat and regal cape; and he has the most curious movements – including a minimalist approach – when it comes to his deportment while performing. Winning first and second places in the contest for Road March 1974 – with his songs “Bassman” and “Ah Come Out To Play” – released as a 7-inch 45rpm single vinyl record the same year – Shadow was the ‘new’ calypsonian to break the stranglehold on Road March Title held for eleven years by “biggies” Kitchener and Sparrow. While Shadow came very close to winning Calypso Monarch for 1974 – certainly he was the crowd favourite – the judges didn’t agree. He would be denied the crown several seasons over before deciding to just ignore that competition – well, for 17 years, at any rate. In 1993 he re-entered for Calypso Monarch and, though he was not to win, he would comment afterwards: “I never get no crown, but they can’t touch my music. The Shadow music sweet too bad.” However, in 2000, he did finally win the Monarch title – something he’d been deserving of for many years.\n\nAs regards his musical contribution to the Calypso genre, Shadow told the Trinidad newspaper, TnT Mirror, in 1989, that his claim to fame was in “moving the bottom of the music, and introducing changes in the bass lines…My music is characterized by a lot of energy, because of my emphasis on the foot drums and bass…” Among The Mighty Shadow‘s famous songs are: Obeah (1982), Ah Come Out Tuh Party (1983), If I Wine I Wine (1985), The Garden Want Water (1988), and Mr. Brown (1996).\n\nZP_A 12 year old boy and member of the Tamana Pioneers steel orchestra practises his bass drums_ Arima, Trinidad_ January 2013\n\n. . .\n\nWinston Anthony Bailey a.k.a.

They have won the “Panorama”/Pan Alive competition more than two dozen times over the years. Currently under the leadership of Earl La Pierre, Jr., Afropan has mentored many young pannists and its player-membership includes a large number of female musicians.\n\n.\n\nToday – Simcoe Day Holiday Monday – is the “last lap lime” for Toronto Caribbean Carnival 2013 – more commonly known as Caribana – after two weeks of special events that included a Junior Carnival, King and Queen Competition, Calypso Monarch Finals, The Grand Parade or “Jump Up” – plus Pan Alive.\n\nPan Alive brings together, through the Ontario Steelpan Association, a dozen or more homegrown steel-pan orchestras from Toronto and elsewhere in Ontario. These perform original compositions or arrangements before pan aficionados and a table of judges. The 2013 winners were Pan Fantasy, under the leadership of Wendy Jones (with arranger Al “Allos” Foster), playing SuperBlue’s “Fantastic Friday”.\n\nOther competing orchestras at Pan Alive 2013 were: Afropan, Pan Masters, Golden Harps, Panatics, Salah Steelpan Academy, Silhouettes, Hamilton Youth Steel Orchestra, New Dimension, Canadian Caribbean Association of Halton, St.Jamestown Youth Centre, JK Vibrations and Metrotones.\n\n.\n\nOur Guest Editor – Trinidadian poet, Andre Bagoo – here takes a look at poetry inspired by the steel-pan in the following selection he has put together for Zócalo Poets.\n\n. . .\n\nSTEEL-PAN is everywhere in the Caribbean, so much so that some people cannot help but define us by it. We’ve produced Nobel laureates in the arts, economics and sciences; great athletes; contributed so much all over the planet – yet ask the average foreigner about the Caribbean and chances are the first thing they will talk about is steel-pan. But the region has a complex relationship with pan. For us, pan music is not just fun. It is a ritual: an invocation of the pulse of history within our veins; a defiant assertion of individuality against larger global forces; an example of how one man’s trash can become treasure – a sublime subversion of power, economics and art. Trinidad and Tobago, inventor of the pan, prides itself in being the race that created what is said to be the only acoustic instrument invented in the 20th century. Yet, Trinidadian poets, and Caribbean poets generally, have a sophisticated relationship with the instrument. Its hard, silver and lyrical contours are not mere tourist ornament, but loaded symbol. Often, as in my poem ‘Carnival’ (http://www.bostonreview.net/bagoo-carnival), instead of being a symbol of pleasure, the pan becomes a hollow, opposite thing – creating an irony because of our pleasurable expectations.\n\n.\n\nRoger Robinson’s ‘Texaco Oil Storage Tanks’ is ostensibly a poem about the materials used to make pans: oil barrels. But he finds the forces of history, power and economics inside them. While the oil storage tanks are large structures, the poem arguably evokes the images of smaller steel pans. Derek Walcott strikingly uses the image of the pan as a kind of psychogeographic tool in the opening of ‘Laventille’, whose first lines invite us to imagine that hill-top region as the arch of a pan. It’s also a device pregnant with meaning since Laventille is regarded as the birthplace of the instrument. In Kamau Brathwaithe’s great poem ‘Calypso’, pan makes an overt appearance but is, in fact, really all over the poem: its rhythm, its materials, its colour. I’ve included David Blackman’s poem ‘Bassman’ because of how far it veers from our romantic associations with that figure. And Lelawattee Manoo-Rahming’s ‘Steelpan in Miami’ is the final, fitting irony: pan exported, becoming a kind of prison of nostalgia, only made possible by migration away from the Caribbean basin.\n\n– Andre Bagoo\n\n. . .\n\nRoger Robinson: “Texaco Oil Storage Tanks”\n\n(Trinidad, Pointe-à-Pierre, 1978)\n\n.\n\nYou silver gods, with viscous black innards,\n\nskin of iron plates and bones of steel rivets,\n\n.\n\nyour Cyclopean eye is a bright red star.\n\nAt each entrance stands an armed, khakied guard;\n\n.\n\nthey check our passes, though we’ve known them for years,\n\nfor though we work here, we don’t belong.\n\n.\n\nA new shift begins, our brown workboots trudge\n\nand the unemployed beg and plead out front\n\n.\n\nin full view, with burning sun on their shame,\n\nbut it’s not worse than their child’s hunger pains.\n\n.\n\nOur fingernails are full of tar and dust:\n\nyou came for the oil, and left with our blood.\n\n. . .\n\nDerek Walcott: From “Laventille”\n\n[for V.S.

What began as a simple parade of a few hundred on McCaul Street evolved into a massive day-long Jump-Up attracting a million-plus people, where the line between spectator and participant was often invisible – crowds following Charlie’s Roots, Catelli All-Stars or Toronto’s own AfroPan steel orchestra all along the parade route – holding up ‘streetcars’(trams) and causing traffic snarls on the Saturday of the Simcoe Day long weekend. Brass bands on flatbed trucks playing whichever year’s Road March or Calypso/Soca Top Ten, interspersed with costumed revellers “playing mas”, commenced at Queen’s Park, headed south down University Avenue, under the York Street railway bridge and dispersed at Queen’s Quay and the ferry dock on Lake Ontario – the party then continuing with a picnic and live music on Olympic Island.\n\nCaribana was Toronto’s single biggest cultural event throughout much of the 1980s and up until the mid-1990s when The Jump-Up finally had some real summer competition: The Gay Pride Parade, The Beaches Jazz Festival, and Taste of the Danforth.\n\nBut it was Trinis who brought FUN to this city’s streets FIRST.\n\nToday, Saturday August 4th, the 2012 Jump-Up is winding its way along Lakeshore Boulevard under sunshine and 30 degree Celsius heat – perfect weather for “playing mas”!\n\n*\n\nMas is short for masquerade, and we feature Trinidad Calypsonian David Rudder’s 1998 Soca lyrics for High Mas (a pun on playing mas and holy mass) to honour the nation which brought a lusty public party spirit to the streets of Toronto away back when…\n\nDavid Rudder\n\nHigh Mas\n\n( Give praise, give praise, Children, yeah!\n\nGive praise, give praise, Children! )\n\nOur Father who has given us this art\n\nSo that we can all feel like we are a part\n\nOf this earthly heaven – (Amen)\n\nForgive us this day our daily weakness\n\nAs we seek to cast our mortal burdens on your city – (Amen)\n\nOh merciful Father, in this Bacchanal season\n\nWhere men lose their reason\n\nBut most of us just want to wine and have a good time\n\nCuz we looking for a lime,\n\nBecause we feeling fine, Lord, – (Amen)\n\nAnd as we jump up and down in this crazy town\n\nSend us some music for some healing – (Amen)\n\n*\n\nEverybody hand raise\n\nEverybody give praise\n\nEverybody hand raise\n\nAnd if you know what ah mean – put up your finger\n\nAnd if you know what ah mean – put up your hand\n\nAnd if you know what ah mean – put up your finger\n\nAnd if you know what ah mean then scream:\n\nO O O O O, give Jah his praises\n\nO O O O O, let Jah be praised\n\nO O O O O, the Father in his mercy\n\nHe sends a little music to make the vibration raise\n\nSo Carnival Day everybody come and celebrate\n\nEverybody come and celebrate\n\nSee the ragamuffin congregate, yeah\n\nEverybody come and celebrate\n\nAnd everybody say:\n\nEh eh eh eh eh eh, ah love meh country\n\nEh eh eh eh eh eh, ah feeling irie\n\nEh eh eh eh eh eh, ah love meh country\n\nEh eh eh eh eh eh, ah feeling irie\n\n*\n\nOur Father who has given us this art\n\nSo that we can all feel a part\n\nOf your heaven – (Amen)\n\nForgive us this day our daily weakness\n\nAs we seek to cast our mortal burdens on your city – (Amen)\n\nOn this lovely day when we come out to play and\n\nWe come out to sway and we breakin a-way\n\nSome will say what they have to say\n\nBut only you know the pain we are feeling – (Amen)\n\nAs it was in the beginning of J’ouvert\n\nGoodbye to Carnival Tuesday ending – (Amen)\n\n*\n\nEverybody hand raise\n\nEverybody give praise\n\nEverybody hand raise\n\nAnd if you know what ah mean – put up your finger\n\nAnd if you know what ah mean – put up your hand\n\nAnd if you know what ah mean – put up your finger\n\nAnd if you know what ah mean then scream:\n\nO O O O O give Jah his praises\n\nO O O O O let Jah be praised\n\nO, the Father in his mercy\n\nHe sends a little Soca to make the vibration raise\n\nSo Carnival Day everybody come and celebrate\n\nEverybody come and celebrate\n\nSee the ragamuffin congregate, yeah\n\nEverybody come and celebrate\n\nAnd everybody say:\n\nEh eh eh eh eh eh ah love meh country\n\nEh eh eh eh eh eh ah feeling irie\n\nEh eh eh eh eh eh ah love meh country\n\nEh eh eh eh eh eh ah feeling irie…..\n\n* * *\n\nTrinidadian glossary:\n\nMas – Masquerade;
