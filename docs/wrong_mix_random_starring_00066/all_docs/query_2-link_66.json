        "text": "https://sdk.canva.com/v1/embed.jsMommy Dear by chandra ganju\n\nDeepak Ganju\n\nIt was exactly one year ago that, we lost our Angel\n\nआशियाँ मेरा जला और मैं देखता रहा\n\nतेरी याद के सिवा मेरे पास क्या रहा\n\nChandra Ganju\n\nOctober 23rd, is indelibly imprinted on my mind and heart. I have survived this whole year being with you and your memories. Never felt for a moment that you are not with me, but onset of October month makes me feel empty, lifeless and with a dreadful feeling of losing something dearest to me. Closer this date comes; fear of losing something dear to me starts making me restless. I have been getting nightmares of going to hospital, waiting in lobby, meeting doctors, discussing what is next and living in false hope, consoling you and myself that everything would be fine.\n\nResurgence of sadness and grief has frozen me. My body and limbs feel like broken. All reasoning, logic and spiritual teachings seems to me empty and frivolous. Almost 19 months with you through all your ups and down of health, have left me numb and clueless.\n\nThat dreadful morning that took away my entire existence brings your serene face in front of me again and again. I am unable to understand, why you had to go so soon. I am lost with a big question mark? All I know is that a part of me died right there with you on that hospital bed. There is not a moment when I am not talking to you and choking to cry, but I make sure I wipe my tears before your spy Aariyana catches me crying.\n\nIt is construed that “Time heals all wounds” “Everything happens for a purpose” “You are at better place now”. I do not find any solace in these sayings, I don’t see any purpose in your going at this age, neither do I see any healing, nor do I see or understand better place you are at. Days have come and gone, and yet I feel like nothing has changed. I have simply learned to pretend smile while I am dying inside.\n\nI feel you everywhere. I feel you in dew drops, I feel you at dawn time, I feel you in flutter of butterfly in our backyard. I feel you in stillness of lake water every morning, I feel you in gloomy weather, when dark clouds are ready to shower rain, I feel you in ripples of water waves which merges soon after it is formed and never reaches the shore, I feel you in tear drops rolling down from my eyes. I feel you in lullaby I sing at night time for Aariyana. I feel you in Aariyana’s giggles, I feel you in her tight hugs when she sits in my lap.\n\nIt is unimaginable that you have gone for that long. Whether I like it or not, the unwanted first year has passed. One whole year without the person who gave me motherhood.\n\nDivya Tanna\n\nEverything felt by you, expressed by you is echoing in my mind.\n\nWe do call her and it comes back to us after reflecting from somewhere.\n\nWe talk to her and our heart feels she responds.\n\nYes, Our Aariyana always tells you, Chandra ji, “Don’t cry, nani ” and you work hard to hide tears only to flow as fall later on.\n\nWe all pray that she gets happiest and healthiest abode though we are having a vacuum..\n\nEverything beautiful, precious natural, remind us of Neha . But we have her loveliest signature as her little angel ,Aariyana and Neha ‘s warm memories reflected in her photos and our hearts.\n\nBe at your best wherever you are..\n\nOur love and blessings to you\n\nMahrook Kerravala\n\nJust cannot forget 23 Oct….I.was alone here in India and since many did not know abt nehas illness i was bombarded with all queer and inquisitive questions…never have i felt so miserable , and lonely…But somehow i mustered the courage to bear it all.I knew she was sedated.but still wanted to talk to her.I kept requesting God to give my additional years to her.But fate had a different story to tell.When bhaskar called at night ,i was devastated,even did not know how to react….but till today i never felt she was not with us..I dont think time has healed any one of us..but my dikri Neha will always remain in my heart.No one can take her place.Wherever she is she must be at peace.Om shanti.\n\nBhaskar Tanna\n\nDear Neha was jewel in our crown as I said at funeral. She was quite capable of being Dharohar of the family for future. Her void would never be filled. She has given us Nanhi Neha in form of her sweet and loving beti Aariyana. Neha was with us for a short time but left behind wealth of nice memories. I know only worry you had was about bringing up Aari and be assured wherever you are that all of us in US and India will our best to fulfill that. Love you Neha\n\nDivya Tanna\n\nRahen to bichhad gayi hain lekin woh path par पाव के निशा अभी भी मौजूद है। God needed her up into his abode. She expressed the need to raise her child. God promised to grant super power to the loved ones surrounding the little angel so as to help her grow up in the spirit desired by the departing atman. Many many thoughts whirling in the mind. But one paramount question : why o why ??!\n\nGita Shaykher\n\nOh god! Is this really one year has passed but pain is still there,it hurts very much , I don’t think it will ever go , she left us with a hole and emptiness in our hearts. Her words I still remember she told me ” Gita mami Abhi maya uper nahi Jana chati “. We will miss you my sundri till my last breath. I love you.\n\nSunanda Vashisht\n\n“Tell me good stories, tell me happy stories. I don’t want to hear any depressing stuff”- This is what you told me when I spoke to you last. That Thursday as I negotiated through traffic to get to the airport to catch the only flight available that day, I reminded myself that I would tell you only happy stories when I see you. But when I reached, I only saw your smiling and serene face. You never talked to me again. For next 3 days we prayed and prayed. I could never tell you any happy stories.\n\nPuki, there haven’t been any happy stories since. It has been a year. But there will be lot to catch up when we meet. Goodbyes are not for sisters and soulmates.\n\nLove you Puka… Will tell you lots of happy stories when we meet. Promise.\n\nAnita Desai\n\nI still can’t believe it’s been a year and a day doesn’t go by without thinking of Neha and missing her…whether it’s wanting to txt her, looking back at photos, finding old cards or gifts she had given as I moved this past wk, thinking of what she would say about this or that, wanting to share a story or imagining the what ifs. Part of me sometimes feels it’s just a dream and I’ll see her next time I’m in Florida but then the reality hits and my heart breaks for you, aunty, KT and Aari and the loss you must feel daily. As today creeped up I too felt restless and tried to occupy my mind but tonight it is just consumed with her memories and I can’t stop reminiscing. I keep hearing her voice or remembering her asking me the last time I saw her in Miami if I thought she would be ok. I rem her trying to help me print my boarding pass on her printer in her room and her whispering her thoughts and me trying to reassure her she will be ok and I would see her again soon as I hugged her. I only wish I could get those moments back and could have said more to accept the inevitable which we all hoped and prayed for wouldn’t happen so I could say the goodbyes/thoughts I didn’t want to say at the time. My thoughts and love are with you and the whole family today and I know no words can bring you comfort at this time but I hope her memories, the love you shared and her darling Aari can help you get through today and the days to come. Rest in peace Neha….you are forever in my heart and memories.\n\nParijat Tanna Tadkad\n\nRember that time we went on that boat ride and we saw all the expensive homes in South Beach and we declared which one would be our future home? We also hung out on the swings and enjoyed the Miami heat while Aari played in the sand. We ate a delicious lunch and wore shades, living that Real Housewives life. We said our husbands would need to make more money for us and then declared that we would be independent women who didn’t need their husbands to take care of them financially. Oh, the weather was perfect, we declared it the best weather and light for pictures. We sat there and watched Aari and smiled. It was a perfect day.\n\nI have been sitting here wanting that perfect day again and getting sad and then I remembered that I had that when I took Aari to Starbucks and we shared a cookie and blew bubbles in our drinks. We talked about sharing and we tried to find different shapes and colors. We saw the bag with Mickey Mouse and the green Starbucks logo and the circle table. We made silly animal noises and made funny faces. We tried to whisper but our giggles were loud. It was perfect.\n\nI imagined you right there, smiling – that one where you scrunch up your nose and pucker your lips a little (it’s my favorite smile of yours and I wish I had a picture of it). I imagined you kissing Aari to the point of annoying her. I imagined you telling me to not give her so many sweets and spoiling her. It was a perfect wish.\n\nWhat I wish for is incomprehensible that there aren’t words to describe it. All I have is I love you and I miss you.\n\nPinky Kanjani\n\nOn the beaches of miami with deep regrets wish we could have met u.\n\nYou always asked when will we come to visit u we came too late. Didn’t know we had such little time with u.\n\nRemembering the beautiful soul !\n\nEmily Rodriguez\n\nIt’s been so hard to put into words how much I’ve missed you. Its been a rollercoaster of emotions. I hold onto the many memories we’ve shared, the laughters, the giggles, the looks followed by even more laughter. I’ve missed your squeezing hugs, the way you pinched my cheeks, and held my hand. But just when my smile of great memories turn into tears of sorrow I hear you again…first the giggles followed by a belly full of laughter, the often bear hugs and eyes full of sparkle and spirit blinking back at me. You left us a gift, the gift of sunshine. When i see her, I see you. The memories I share with her, I feel as though I’m sharing with you. Where she is, i imagine you there also. Like when that huge bug flew on us this weekend and we held up the entire ride, I felt you were right there screaming along side us. Knowing that somewhere your laughing at what happened, brings a smile back on my face.\n\nSonal Patel\n\nNeha, you will always be my dear friend and sister. You were such a strong inspiring person who never showed any weakness. You always held on to hope and no matter what made the best of every situation. You were fighting so hard to overcome cancer, it was not something you could have controlled. Throughout this process you have continued to show us how important friendships were to you and how important it is to cherish life. We appreciate you for being a part of our lives and being such an amazing friend. I am so grateful for all the memories you have left us with. You are the definition of true beauty. Your legacy will continue to live on forever within your beautiful daughter. You have impacted so many lives including mine. Today a million hearts are broken but yet there is a beautiful angel watching over us now. You always said you might be far in distance but you will always remain very close to my heart. You will forever be close to my heart. I love you ❤️ No more suffering and no more pain just Rest In Peace my dear friend/sister.\n\nDeepak Ganju\n\nTime is a great healer but not in a situation, when one loose his or her own child. The intensity of pain keeps growing with each passing day. It feels that each day, month and year that goes by, she is getting farther away from us and we want to keep those memories and moments as fresh as we can. Her reflection in Aariyana keeps us going. She used to often tell us “Don’t worry Papa, I have kept her for you”\n\nIt was exactly 2 years ago that we lost our angel Neha Ganju Tanna whom we lovingly called Pucky. I remember that fateful early morning as we all stayed overnight besides her bed knowing that her journey was coming to an end that day. I remembered the song: आ चल के तुझे मैं लेके चलूँ एक ऐसे गगन के तले, जहाँ ग़म भी ना हो, आँसू भी ना हो, बस प्यार ही प्यार पले.\n\nChandramukhi Ganju\n\nOnset of the month of October brings back the memories of pain and despair. I relate to the morning cool breeze, calm and serene sunrise, with the same helplessness that I felt 2 years ago. Hoping against hope that my daughter might be a miracle story and will not slip from life.\n\nThe anniversary of my broken heart and shattered dreams is today, October 23rd to be exact. They say time is a great healer, but who wants to get healed? Certain pains are not meant to be healed. Time heals nothing but teaches us how to live with it.\n\nI do not want to let go memory of you ever. Now that your memories are my companion and there is not a fraction of time, when I do not feel you or think about you. I always feel you within me.\n\nThey say after certain age mother daughters are like friends. This was in our case too. You always patiently listened to my concerns; you always took care of me and my feelings and never hurt me. I miss you grabbing me and saying “Mere sensitive Ma aap dukhi mut huva karoo, Saab theekh ho jaayaga.” (My sensitive mother don’t get sad, everything will be alright). I feel you still are taking care of me in the form of Aariyana, who fills your gap so sweetly and lovingly. She takes care of me and wipes my tears with her beautiful cute smile and warm hugs like you used to give. Aariyana is a tiny dot which keeps all of us connected. She is a kinetic energy. She is a breath of fresh air in the midst of sadness. Thank you for such a priceless gift."
