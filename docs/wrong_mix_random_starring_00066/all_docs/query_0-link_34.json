        "text": "Crete - Derek Ireland and the British/European school of Ashtanga\n\nJust heard my place on Manju's TT course in Crete is confirmed, thank god for that, had already booked the flight and hotel.\n\nM. asked me why Crete ( she noticed that I'd mentioned there was a much cheaper option of the (now only slightly) shorter course with Manju at Stillpoint yoga in London, oops.\n\nWell how about this...\n\nit's Crete, spiritual home of British (and perhaps European ) Ashtanga.\n\nAnd if we have a 'spiritual home' of British Ashtanga then we need a patron saint, well that would have to be Derek Ireland, although I suspect we'd hear Derek's big basso laugh that the obituary below refers to at being called a saint.\n\nI had planned on packing a few fresh pairs of Nike pro shorts for the trip but I see from the video that other attire is, it seems, de rigueur for Ashtanga in Crete and am now off to tanga.com to pick up a suitcase full, did you say turquoise Maya?\n\nRemember I was reviewing Petri Räisänen's book the other week, seems Petri's first certified teacher was Derek Ireland\n\n\"In his yogic path Petri has studied with many respected Astanga Yoga teachers such as Derek Ireland (his first certified teacher)\".\n\nDoes it make sense I wonder to talk about different Schools of Ashtanga ? The California or US School of Ashtanga, the Hawaii school, The British School, Russian school....are there slight differences in character I wonder that reflect the different influences of the senior teachers who pass on the practice. Interesting thought....( or not).\n\nAnyway, here's a post from 2011 on Derek Ireland.\n\nIn the video, look out for the most stunning Utthita hasta padangushtasana you'll probably ever see (2:12).\n\nDerek Ireland\n\nI've heard tales about Derek Ireland since I first started Ashtanga, I think he was mentioned as an influence and teacher in the first couple of Ashtanga books I worked with. I've seen pictures of him, one quite iconic of him standing on a cliff somewhere with this long hair of his blowing in the wind. I bought the John Scott DVD, too advanced for me at the time, probably still is, he was Derek's student and often mentions him. I never got to see any video's of his practice until Dom linked to this one on FB.\n\nIt's a beautiful, powerful, practice ( check out the Utthita Eka Padasana, strewth) and yet there's something sad about the video, has that old home movie feel about it, he passed away in 1998.\n\nI think the video below was uploaded by his kids.\n\nIndependent.co.uk\n\nObituary\n\nPeter Guttridge\n\nMonday, 28 September 1998\n\nIN 1988, Derek Ireland, the charismatic yoga practitioner who was largely responsible with Radha Warrell for introducing to Europe the \"aerobic\" yoga called astanga vinyasa, accidentally blew himself up with camping gas canisters on a Greek island. He was severely burnt on his legs and arms so a Greek doctor peeled the skin off. \"He peeled my hand which really hurt because of all the nerve endings. My lateral ligament was sticking out like an onion ring,\" Ireland recalled later.\n\nHe was flown to London for skin grafts. On arrival the doctors wrapped the burns in netting and plastic bags and bandages then left him for a few days before starting on the grafts. Whilst waiting, Ireland did head and shoulder stands. \"It was the Olympics so I turned the television upside- down and watched it for an hour at a time.\" Seven days later the doctors took the bandages off. The skin had healed. \"No scars, nothing. But I felt tiny because I'd no prana left from healing this thing.\"\n\n\"Prana\" in yoga is the breath of life - the life force - and it was the power of the breathing exercises (\"pranayama\") that first drew Derek Ireland, a former Brighton and Hove football apprentice, to yoga.\n\n\"I'm not into meditation,\" he said. \"I don't believe in chakras or kundalini. I'm not a guru worshipper - I know they've grown wise but they're still only human and all they know is some southern Indian village. I got into astanga vinyasa yoga for the combination of breathing and movement.\"\n\nIreland was a walking testimonial to the health and fitness properties of the form. Tall, deeply tanned and muscular, he radiated vitality and energy. To see him demonstrate the yoga, accompanied by throbbing pop music, was an eye-popping experience. He combined grace and fluidity of movement with strength and remarkable gymnastic ability.\n\nHe clearly believed if you've got it flaunt it. He did the demonstrations in designer knickers and his own yoga practise six days a week wearing only a thong. On his daily run he generally wore nothing but trainers, the thong and a personal stereo.\n\nHe got away with such shameless exhibitionism by dint of his genial charm and a willingness to laugh at himself. A warm, caring man, he had a quick sense of humour and a ready laugh - a wonderful, deep, basso laugh that filled the \"sweat box\" at the Practice Place in Crete or the \"yoga shack\" on the beach in Goa where he was an inspiring, hands-on teacher to hundreds of students over the years.\n\n\"I like to work hands on - I look on my teaching as bodywork therapy,\" he said. One of his students had over 50 broken bones but was on the second series (the yoga has six levels or series, each one increasing in difficulty). It didn't matter to Derek how good you were, all that mattered was that you were willing to try.\n\nDerek Ireland was born and raised in Brighton. A \"ferociously competitive\" athlete at school, he was apprenticed to Brighton and Hove Albion football team when a severe knee injury playing rugby ended his hopes of a professional sports career.\n\nWhen punk came along he spent five years promoting the Sex Pistols, the Clash and the Stranglers along the south coast and took fully to the rock and roll lifestyle. He started conventional yoga with his girlfriend Radha Warrell after \"living off my memories of my sporting triumphs for ten years\". Thereafter he did yoga almost every day.\n\nIn 1978 the couple moved to Los Angeles where Ireland was supposed to take a band on the road. \"It was to be Foreigner, then the Tubes, then Ozzy Osbourne. In the end I didn't take anyone - I think because they thought I was wilder than the bands.\"\n\nTwo years later the couple went on a one-month teacher training course to a Shivananda yoga retreat in the Bahamas. They stayed six years to run the place. During that time a visiting Shivananda swami from New York introduced them to astanga vinyasa, a vigorous form of yoga that had been rediscovered in the Thirties by Patthabhi Jois in Mysore, who claimed it was the original yoga from which all other hatha yogas had developed.\n\nIn 1986 Derek Ireland moved to New York to teach it - in the absence of premises he ran big open-air classes in Central Park until the park authorities moved him on. The following year he and Radha spent six months with Jois in Mysore, then began to teach the form as he had passed it on to them all over the world.\n\nIn 1991 they opened the Practice Place, a centre devoted to astanga vinyasa, in a secluded bay in southern Crete. The Practice Place quickly established itself as one of the most important yoga centres in the world. Many of the numerous classes now available in Britain are run by Derek and Radha's former students. More and more people have taken up the yoga, including such celebrities as Ralph Fiennes, Daniel Day-Lewis, Sting, Woody Harrelson, Winona Ryder and Demi Moore.\n\nIreland's ebullient manner and deliberately non-spiritual approach to yoga caused raised eyebrows in the yoga community over the years. \"I usually do my practice to music - in England I do it to MTV,\" he said a couple of years ago. \"I used to do it with weights on my wrists: that upset a few purists. I also had a weighted jacket but I got rid of that after I did a handstand and nearly killed myself - it slipped down and hit me on the back of the head.\"\n\nIreland had lots of injuries, which made his control of his body even more remarkable. He fell out of a tricky posture and severed a nerve once, losing control of his left arm for four years. In consequence, teaching ta'i chi he kept hitting himself in the eye.\n\nIn winter he ran courses in a \"yoga shack\" on a beach in Goa. He attracted students simply by doing his practice on the beach for passersby to watch. The practice would take two hours and within five minutes he would be surrounded by Indians who weren't familiar with this style of yoga. \"Some would plonk babies on me for photographs. I tried to stay focused - I only got uptight if they actually walked on me!\"\n\nDerek Ireland had started a new phase of his life with Kristina Karitinou and their child Lumiere when testicular cancer was diagnosed and treated. They had another child, Liam, 18 months ago. Cancer recurred. Ireland continued to teach in Crete and Goa in the periods between his treatments with the same care as before. His warmth and ebullience never left him until the breath of life, the prana, did.\n\nDerek Ireland, yoga practitioner and teacher: born Brighton, East Sussex 16 April 1949; married 1998 Kristina Karitinou (two sons); died Brighton 24 September 1998\n\n-----------------\n\nand here's a follow up post I put up last year on the one above\n\nDerek Ireland Ashtanga Led Primary CD and Pranayama CD\n\nI was teaching Vinyasa Krama for much of last week which was fun, an interesting experience but my practice hasn't exactly felt my own all week. I would run through the practice I planned to teach in my morning practice and then half demonstrate/instruct, half practice along with the 'student' in the evening.\n\nI don't know, teaching.... I'd like to do some more, almost feel a responsibility to do so now, to pass on what was shared with me but at the expense of my own practice? I'm accustomed to practicing twice a day, it's a luxury I know...the more students the less time there would be to practice. Ashtanga is a little different perhaps, a fixed sequence, but Vinyasa Krama takes a little planning. But then when I first started teaching, whether as a TA at Uni or as a Schoolteacher or TEFL in Japan, I would spend ages planning lessons/classes, by the end though I'd come up with something on a quick trip to the bathroom or on the way class (just sketch the outlines and allow space for improvising in class, riff off each other). I guess I spent a long time designing teacher training programs when I was a trainer but that was different, even then the courses became pretty much routine after teaching them a few times.\n\nIt's a concern though.\n\nOf course if the time ever came when I had enough students to give up work and teach full time (hate the idea, depending on yoga for my livelihood worries me more than a little) one would assume there would be more time to practice again. I'm not convinced, it's no doubt hard to say no to anyone asking for lessons and before you know it your teaching constantly with no time for your own practice or if you do, you fit one in it's with upcoming lessons in mind.\n\nI'd like more time to practice not less, more time for longer pranayama, for longer sits, for more study...\n\nAnyway, I was given Derek Ireland's Primary CD, much better than an apple, thank you. Was looking forward to getting home and practicing with it on Saturday after work. As it happen I ended up with a flat and had to push my bike home, practice was the last thing I was in the mood for.\n\nOn FB I asked mentally \"Derek, to be gentle\" .....wrong teacher, wrong CD, Derek is old school, a fast full on practice.\n\nThat said Derek Ireland's practice runs to 1:42 which seems slow, compare it with Sharath's Primary in an hour. That's partly because there are a couple of extra postures in there, a parivtta parsva konasana variation where the arm goes under the leg and binds and then Hanumanasana and Samakonasana are squeezed in after the Prasarita series.\n\nThere's a nice focus on dandasna which gets echoed throughout and a pause before each jump through to 'set' yourself up. Time too for an extra breath or so to bind the tricky postures if you want it. It's not exactly a beginners led though, you'd need to know the practice and be practicing for a little while but it makes for a nice led and with a slightly different focus than anyone else. All the led DVD's are useful every now and again if your practicing at home, everyone has a different take on the practice. I'm still getting a lot out of Richard Freeman's but this was a refreshing change.\n\nI'd expected to suffer a bit, Vinyasa Krama is a slower practice but perhaps it's two weeks of green smoothies but I found the practice comfortable, felt strong and fit but then Vinyasa krama is deceptively demanding.\n\nWhile I'm mentioning Derek Ireland, I picked up his pranayama CD a while back, this is the Ashtanga approach to pranayama, or perhaps the Ashtanga Pranayama Routine (coming to a shala near you perhaps once Gregor's pranayama book come out in a couple of months) little different than how I was taught by Ramaswami but interesting and highly recommended (here's an outline, pretty much as I remember it on the CD). It goes through Ujaii, nadi shodana (alternating nostrils), sitali... each exercise separated off by a few deep breaths and inhalations, a nice , pre practice routine (pranayama seems to come before asana practice in ashtanag as opposed to after in vinyasa Krama).\n\nI like Derek Ireland, wasn't sure when I first saw the video below with the thong and flowing locks (that WMG seem to have blocked) but his personality comes through on his cd's, he doesn't take himself too seriously, there's a warmth and generosity and even a gentleness from the big man.\n\nHere's a little look at one of his classes\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nLight Centre Moorgate Now Open in London.\n\nNOW OPEN!!!\n\nMy (our) friend Susan will be teaching here TONIGHT and Thursday, 18:45!\n\nGo to Information tab for FREE introductory class voucher!!\n\nhttp://www.lightcentremoorgate.co.uk/\n\nfrom the website...\n\nLight Centre Moorgate Now Open\n\nFREE YOGA, PILATES OR FITNESS CLASS\n\nJust click here to get your free class voucher and then come and try out our fabulous new Moorgate centre.\n\nThe Light Centre is London’s leading health and wellbeing centre.

How Long?\n\nIf you caught the fb updates yesterday you might want to jump straight to the 'So what was it like' section. The Notes at the end are just a little background on Full vinyasa, Longs slow inhalations and exhalations and taking ten breaths an asana, some quotes, nice video of Pattabhi Jois etc.\n\nMy Facebook status updates from yesterday\n\nIn Manju's training manual he writes dasha diirgha rechaka puuraka, ten long slow inhalations and exhalations in every posture inc. the down dogs in all ten sury's. Elsewhere he talks of full vinyasa as being how his father practiced, but that things changed because 'nobody has the time anymore'. Today is my day off and I have the time, curious to see how long such a practice would actually take. Any off the top of your head bets? I work at 8 second inhalation / 8 second exhalation ( little less in the deep binds). My top of my head guess, 3 hours forty-five minutes\n\n22 hours ago\n\n-----------------------\n\nMine was a good guess 3 hours 40 minutes, once is enough, certainly don't fancy six days a week of that. Barry, I seem to remember reading that pranayama should be twice as long as the asana and meditation twice as long as pranayama : (\n\n18 hours ago\n\n-------------\n\nIt did feel long. Post to come but Sury's took 40 min, got to paschimottanasana after 90 minutes, up to Setu was three hours and then finishing another forty minutes. All the way there was the terror of ten slow breaths in utta hasta, padangustasana, 5x10 in navasana, bhujapindasana, 3x10 in Urdhva Dhanurasana, uttana padasana and of course utpluthi right there at the end. Full moon tomorrow??????\n\n-------\n\nCurious thing Mohit was that I didn't sweat much at all, usually after a 90 minute Primary my towel is drenched, was still pretty dry here after almost four hours of practice. It was too long some postures extreme for the long holds but overall it was a very calm, steady and composed practice. Whole body is still tingling somewhat, four hours of deep full breathing, it's an interesting sensation.\n\n--------------\n\neco towels still pretty dry after almost four hours of full vinyasa\n\ndrenched after 90 minutes regular primary\n\nSo what was it like.\n\nI explored standard full vinyasa for a month or so back in 2009, liked it actually, something about starting each asana with a clean slate, forgetting all about the previous asana or the one to come. But it does take time, anything between two and three hours. An interesting experiment though that I think all Ashatngi's should try at least once (it's part of our 'tradition'). John Scott's DVD and Lino Miele's first one have a led full vinyasa, both can be found on Youtube I believe.\n\nBut there are two other aspects of this I've been curious about. The long slow inhalations and exhalations for example that I've been exploring for something like six months now. Pattabhi Jois talked of 10 second inhalation, ten second exhalation (see video in Notes section below), I manage about 8 seconds for each comfortably but that comes down to around five perhaps in tight binds like Mari D.\n\nThis is problematic though, breathe that slowly and a full series can take forever (leaving hardly any time for pranayama and meditation). For sometime I would cut the series in two, even into three. Recently I've been working with Manju's DVD, I go through the vinyasa in and out of the postures at regular breathing, but in the asana itself, where Manju stays silent rather than giving the breath count in English, I do three breaths with long slow full inhalations and exhalations. That kind of works but how long I wondered would a full series take with every inhalation and exhalation long, slow and full.\n\nI've also wondered about the ten breaths in each asana. I remember hearing that that was how it was back in the old days of the old shala, then it became eight and then five. I remember going through the Sweeney book trying to work out how long ten breaths in every posture would take.\n\nReading Manju's training manual brought that back to mind\n\n\"Dasha diirgha rechaka puuraka\"\n\nTen long slow inhalations and exhalations in every asana, and elsewhere he talks of how it was always full vinyasa. How long would that take? A long time obviously, not realistic for the householder clearly, but how long? How long EXACTLY?\n\nDay off yesterday and I thought why not, I have the time.\n\nFirst Sury took three minutes. As well as ten long slow inhalations and exhalations in every asana Manju has the same in each downward dog of each Surya, A and B.\n\nThe Sury's alone took 40 minutes. Quite nice actually, but I was keen to move on to standing....I would regret that.\n\nTen breaths in every standing posture is hard but they do that and more in Iyengar right, how hard can it be? Harder than you think, isn't standing supposed to be the easy bit. I do remember how the second side of all the konasana's felt really good, a counter to the long stay on the previous side.\n\nPrasarita padangusthasana B and C are particularly challenging, but deep really deep.\n\nBy now I'm thinking ahead to the terrors of ten breaths in the Utthita hasta's, managed them but they hurt, by the last couple of Utthita Eka Padasana my leg was only a foot or two off the floor on the second side. Admittedly these postures aren't my strongest, I'm sure there are many who could hold ten breaths here and keep their leg nice and straight but not me, not presently.\n\nPhew I thought, down hill until navasana\n\nThen I almost fainted coming up from both sides of Ardha Baddha padmotanasana and had to rest for a moment against the wall that was a little weird, no idea why I had that reaction.\n\nI finished standing with 90 minutes on the clock, that's pretty much a regular practice right there and I hadn't even settled into paschimottanasana. Did think about calling it a day but thought Seated would be OK and besides I've explored all those long stays in the Rishi series, (25 breaths in each), ten should be easy.\n\nAll the criticisms of Primary series regarding too many forward bends are well founded, at ten breaths an asana that's a lot of forward bending. The full vinyasa helped in that you were getting two upward facing dogs each time,I milked those for all they were worth.\n\nSecond side of Janu C is a problem for me with my dodgy knee ( old old ops) but OK, Mrarichi's were fine too, again, I've done a lot of long stays in these recently, navasana was looming ever larger.\n\nPerhaps it's like childbirth or kidney stones, you forget how painful it was, I know navasana was horrible but I've kind of blanked it out.\n\nPerhaps that's because I remember the pain of Bhuja pidasana more clearly. Manju has an A and B although he doesn't call it that. In A there are ten breaths looking up and then B with another ten breaths with the chin on the mat. Tough\n\nThought I was safe after that, down hill but more terrors to come, Setu was the only one where I cheated, no way I'm going to try ten breaths in Setu bandhasana, especially after three hours of practice, I did the regular five.\n\nUrdhva Dhanurasana took me by surprise, three of those in Manju's book and the ten breaths really took their toll on the arms, wasn't expecting it.\n\nFinishing was relatively straight forward, we're used to longer stays in most of these but the chakrasona's we're becoming tiresome on the full vinyasa in these.Uttana padasana was the last kick in the teeth, had forgotten that one would be challenging.\n\nFell asleep briefly in Savasana.\n\nREFLECTIONS.\n\nI'm glad I stuck with it, good research but I never want to do it again, certainly not six days a week of that, can you imagine. Perhaps you'd get used to it. Did Pattabhi Jois actually practice like that, day in day out? Did Krishnamacharya? It seems that back in Krishnamacharya's time in Mysore they would have classes of an hour, there seems little suggestion that a full primary series was done but rather a changing collection of asana that resembled Primary series perhaps in that there was probably some standing, some seated and finishing postures and that there was the same common sense progression that we find in Pattabhi Jois' presentation of Primary, just not all the postures.\n\nAshtanga is a compromise, either you compromise the breath, it's length, it's number and the longer stays or the number of asana.\n\nThere are too many forward bends in Primary for those long stays, there just are, I was craving my two upward dogs of full vinyasa and any hint of a backbend.\n\nLong stays in certain postures is just nuts, utta hasta padangustasana, navasana, bhujapindasana, Urdhva Dhanurasana, uttana padasana, bit much, certainly in this context. Yogi's aren't supposed to strain or over do it. However do the more regular five breath in those and the whole practise would have been a lot more pleasant.\n\nAnd I liked the full vinyasa and the slower breath and the long stays of ten breaths, It was calm, meditative, chilled....steady. I still can't believe how little I was sweating, even had to spray my legs a little in garbha pindasana.\n\nManju says of his own current practice\n\nDK: How has your personal practice changed over time and do you do your own thing, or do you adhere to a specific sequence?\n\nManju: I do beginning, intermediate, a little bit of advanced, and afterwards, I do a half hour of chanting and meditation.\n\nPerhaps that's ultimately the best balance, some Primary some Intermediate backbends and a few more advanced extensions of the earlier postures as they become appropriate. I'm assuming Manju also includes some sury's, standing and finishing postures.\n\nSounds a little like the 'mythical' Ashtanga Rishi Series perhaps, 10 asana or so with long stays\n\nFor me currently I'm happy to pretty much stick with Manju's approach on his DVD and Teaching manual as I lead up to his workshop. I'll go at a regular pace throughout my practice, inhalations and exhalations as long as I dare but take a just little longer in each asana, occasionally I'll stay for the full ten breaths and after each group of asana throw in an extra full vinyasa. Compromise. Perhaps a full vinyasa practice once a week but with three, long slow full breaths instead of ten.\n\nOne more thing on compromise\n\nIt seems OK to compromise the number of breaths in asana, there are a lot of forward bends for example in primary do we need to take the same long stays in each, the cumulative effect is perhaps enough and besides not all asana require the same length of stay to be effective.\n\nIt seems Ok too to compromise on the number of asana we practice. Both pattabhi Jois and Krishnamacharya say the same, we do what we can, some key asana to include always but otherwise as many as we have time for.\n\nSame goes for full vinyasa, perhaps there's a middle ground between asana between each and every side and between groups of asana.\n\nThe one I find it difficult to justify compromise on is the breath. Seems to me the breath should always be long and slow and full. Inhale as fully, as deeply as possible and as long and slow as reasonable, same for the exhalation.\n\nThe morning after\n\nI decided to take a moon day today, why not I haven't taken them for six years, I'm owed a couple. Seemed to make sense to let the body rest a little.\n\nI expected my back to ache but it's just a little stiff, everything else does though. Actually that's not true, I don't ache so much as kind of tingle, every cell feels alive, is that the asana or the breath or a bit of both.\n\nNOTES\n\nFULL VINYASA\n\nHere's an interview with Pattabhi Jois in France 1991 on the question of Full Vinyasa\n\nQuestion: When is it good to do full vinyasa? That is come back to Samasthiti after each asana. Is it correct?\n\nAnswer: Yes correct. Take one asana, finish it. After full vinyasa you do, standing position you come. Again next. Your strength how is you use (depending on your strength you should do half or full vinyasa). Without strength chat (sixth vinyasa) stop (If you are not strong stop at the sixth vinyasa eg do half vinyasa). Increasing your strength, you full vinyasa you take. Now there is no time (too many students).\n\nThat is why I am telling. One asana, for example paschimottanasana (has) 16 vinyasas, Purvottanasana - 15, Ardha baddha padma paschimottanasana, tiriang mukeka pada paschimottanasana, janu sirsasana A, B, C, marichyasana A, B, all 22 vinyasas. Full vinyasa .\n\nYou doing full vinyasa all - that is the best. Secondary you with sixth vinyasa all the asanas is coming. That you changing, this time (when) your strength is more, you changing that time. Sixth, seventh (vinyasa) paschimottanasana you do. After 8 – 9 then jump again. “sat” (six) position you go. I every day I teaching now. Same method you do. Both is no problem\n\nMethod is good no problem. Work is there. He is going work. (for a working man half vinyasa method is good) Your yoga practice, you take one hour. One hour or two hours your expanding your time. That time all the asanas taken one day full vinyasa you do at least five hours also you want you can understand (if you take full vinyasa, you need 5 hours to complete practice). One primary asanas doing, 5 hours also you want. That is why. You (are a) working (man). You not spending all the time on the yoga practice.\n\nYou can understand. Full time you take, full vinyasa you doing. Only for (completing) primary asanas takes 5 hours. 5 hours primary postures (with) full vinyasa. 50 asanas is there completely primary postures. That 50 asanas you doing taken 5 hours, with full vinyasa. You working. Another place is working. Yes you take money, you eating food, all you want. That only for your spending (free) time only for yoga, very rare (little time), very difficult also yourself. That is why you short cut you take. That is one or two hours. Two hours spent your yoga practice. That is good. That is also is good. Yes OK. That I tell you.\n\nSri K Pattabhi Jois Public Talks on Ashtanga Yoga - France 1991\n\nIn Yoga Makaranda Krishnamacharya presents each asana in it's full vinyasa form, starting and ending each asana from standing samasthithi.\n\nPattabhi Jois does the same in his book Yoga Mala.\n\nFull vinyasa seems then to have been the original form of the practice (whatever that means).\n\nAnd his from Manju Jois in an interview.\n\n\"... and slowly it changed because of lack of time\". It's true, Full Vinyasa takes a while. If we have to get off to work in the morning a 90 minute practice is one thing a two and a half to three hour practice something else altogether. But WHAT DOES FULL VINYASA FEEL LIKE?\n\nI found an old post of mine from back in Oct 2009, I mention there that Full Vinyasa primary was taking me a little over two hours, Full Vinyasa Intermediate series, 100 Minutes.\n\nLONG SLOW INHALATION AND EXHALATION\n\nIn Manju Jois' Ashtanga training manual, on every posture he writes\n\n\"Dasha diirgha rechaka puuraka\".\n\nIn his led video with his students repeating the sanksrit count and names of the postures, he also has them chant the drishit and the above, \"Dasha diirgha rechaka puuraka\".\n\ndasha = ten ( we'll get to this in a moment )\n\nrechaka = exhalation\n\npuuraka = inhalation\n\nbut what about diirgha\n\nhere's Manju talking about it in an interview with Richard Clark for Ashtanga Yoga Life\n\n\"RICHARD:You say that each asana should become a meditation, that the breathing should be long, slow...well, that places this next comment amongst the absurd and ridiculous, but I’d like to ask you what you make of it. Lately, I’ve heard statements to the effect that Ashtanga yoga seems to favour and even emphasise hyperventilation. Hyperventilation is something I’ve never instructed a student to perform whilst practising asana, nor have I heard such an instruction come from reliable Ashtanga teachers here or in India. Can we lay this one to rest?\n\nMANJU: The breathing we use is called ‘dirgha rechaka puraka’, meaning it is long, deep, slow exhales and inhales. It should be dirgha...long, and like music. The sound is very important. You have to do the ujjayi pranayama. You have to take the breath all the way in and let it go all the way out. It’s like blowing into clogged up pipes to remove obstructions. In this way, even diseases can be brought out. That’s why dirgha rechaka puraka is so important\".\n\nso\n\ndiirga = long, deep, slow exhales and inhales\n\nThe breath should be long, thin, slow, like the pouring of oil according to Krishnamacharya in Yoga Makaranda (1934)\n\nThroughout Yoga Mala, Pattabhi Jois is writing, 'do Puuraka slowly', 'do Recheka slowly'.\n\nIn another interview in France he talks of long inhalations and exhalations of 10, even 15 seconds each as the ideal.\n\n16.18 - do all the a sans but DEEP breathing ( arm gesture - hands up above head and down quickly , that is no good)\n\n16.30 - you start with breathing , 10 second inhale, 10 second exhale,\n\n16.40 - ten seconds....or fifteen seconds\n\n16.50 - breath length the same, 10 sec inhale, 10 sec exhale OR 15 second inhale 15 second exhale, that is called vinyasa\n\nTEN BREATHS IN EACH ASANA\n\nAs mentioned above throughout Manju Jois' Ashtanga training manual he mentions\n\n\"Dasha diirgha rechaka puuraka\".\n\ndasha = ten\n\nSo ten breaths in every asana. We've heard of this before how in the old days in the old shala they would stay for ten breaths, later eight, now five.\n\nManju still presents it as ten but only gives time on his video for five or for me, three long slow ones.\n\nInterestingly Manju has dasha, ten breaths, throughout, even in the shoulderstands and headstands which are usually, what fifteen , twenty five breaths. Manju keeps it the same through standing, the primary series prpper and finishing.\n\n↧\n\nSomething for the weekend - Pranayama inc.

A note on counting pranayama\n\nObviously one should approach pranayama with the same common sense as with our regular practice\n\n--------------------\n\nBeen a full on week for me this week with Tuesday's three hour forty minute Full vinyasa ( long slow inhalations and exhalations throughout and 10 breaths in each posture) experiment. Took Wednesday off practice ( a pseudo moon day ) but practice was nice on Thursday and Friday, though felt sprightly after Tuesday's marathon. I said in the Full Vinyasa post that I never wanted to try something like that again, after two days I was craving to do it once more, although perhaps without the long holds in some of the more challenging postures mentioned.\n\nSince coming back to by the book (Manju's) Ashtanga I've started taking Saturday off like a good Ashtanga. Last week I did nothing but from this week I thought I'd make Saturday's extended Pranayama day.\n\nI tend to practice short pranayama sessions either side of my morning practice (currently primary series in prep for Manju's course in August).\n\nPre weekday Primary I practice Kapalabhati followed by a short ( six rounds) practice of\n\nUJJAYI ANULOMA:\n\nInhalation (PURAKA) through both nostrils in UJJAYI, Exhalation (RECHAKA) through Left Nostril, without ujjayi, Inhalation through both nostrils in Ujjayi, and Exhalation through the Right Nostril, without Ujjayi. These two breaths making one Cycle of Ujjayi Anuloma.\n\nAfter Primary I include a short alternating nostril version of bhastrika followed by a short (six rounds) Nadi Shodana practice.\n\nNADI SHODHANA: This is a Pranayama where no ujjayi should ever be used. Inhale by the Left Nostril, Exhale by the Right Nostril, Inhale by the Right Nostril, Exhale by the Left Nostril.\n\nIt is to be noted that a Pranayama can have KUMBHAKA: either after Inhalation (called ANTAH KUMBHAKA) or after Exhalation (called BAHYA KUMBHAKA).\n\nYou can get an idea of this approach to Pranayama from this Video of Krishnamacharya's Life saving practice, the pranayama comes at the beginning and end of the video.\n\nIn the evenings I tend to do a short Vinyasa Krama Bow and Meditative sequence that is very similar, covering much of the same ground, as 2nd series Ashtanga up to kapo.\n\nthis is followed by my main pranayama practice, kapalabhati followed by around twenty to thirty minutes of nadi Shaodana with mantra.\n\nThen Pratyahara and Japa mantra meditation.\n\nStarting this morning, I plan on doing a short, basic (key postures), Vinyasa Krama practice followed by 80 rounds of Nadi Shodana that Ramaswami recommended on his 2010 TT course.\n\nHopefully in the next couple of weeks I'll be exploring David Garrigues Ashtanga pranayama DVD's and book and sharing that experience here.\n\nUntil that arrives here are my Pranayama notes from the pranayama Page/tab that sits permanently at the top of the blog.\n\nIncluded below.\n\ni. How I was taught pranayama by Ramaswami, inc. some short 'tutorials' that I made ages ago and need to redo.\n\nii . Followed by notes on mantra pranayama\n\niii. Ashtanga pranayama\n\niv. Article and notes on pranayma by Krishnamacharya's son T.K.SRIBHASHYAM,\n\nv. Review of a pranayama app posted a couple of years ago.\n\nvi. A note on counting pranayama\n\nPranayama\n\ni. Along the lines of how I was taught by Srivatsa Ramaswami\n\n(Ashtanga pranayama half way down page)\n\nI've just posted a bunch of Pranayama videos on Youtube for the sister blog , Vinyasa Krama Sequences and subroutines and thought I'd make the most of them and make this Pranayama week here too. They basically outline stages in developing a practice, I've broken them down so you can start wherever you feel most comfortable.\n\nThe videos aren't great, the sound quality is poor, sorry, but if you crank up the volume I think you can get an idea of what's going on. Also, my chanting is quite awful, sounds a lot better in my head which is where it tends to stay. Mostly I give instruction and a count for the first round and then just do it for the next couple. I'd hoped the recording would pick up the sound of my breathing but it doesn't really catch it. In the later videos I try recording a voice over but that's a nightmare to sync. They are what they and if anyone is curious or had wanted to start building a practice they might be something to be going on with. I'll go into a little more detail on each video over the next couple of days but if your tempted to dive in right away here's a suggestion.\n\nStart off with some Kapalibhati HERE and then move on through the main Pranayama videos. Try Pranayama 1 and 2 and see how comfortable that is, you might want to keep the exhale at an eight count rather than ten, that's fine. If your comfortable there give Nadi Shodana a try, videos 5 & 6, they have the same ratio. At this point you might want to try learning the Pranayama mantra (see the chant page at the top of the blog, it printed out as well as some MP3's of Ramaswami teaching it ) and chanting along, it has the same ratio as the first ujaii video. After a couple of days, sessions or weeks start increasing the ratios with videos 3 & 4 and/or 6 & 7. When your ready you might like to try and increase the retention of the breath long enough to chant the full mantra 15-20 seconds depending how fast you go. I tend to start off fast and then settle down to a slower chant half way through my practice.\n\nIf your linking here from the Youtube videos and aren't an Ashtangi then I should probably say something about bandhas. You could give them a miss at first and just go through the videos missing that part out altogether although some would argue it's not pranayama without them. Start with what feels comfortable, a nod in their direction perhaps. So three bandhas here, very very simply put Mula bahanda (rectal lock, just lightly clench and lift the rectal muscles for now, it gets more subtle as you go on), Uddiyana is where you see me draw in my belly and lift. Mine is a little extreme here, it's how I tend to practice but also makes clear what's going on for the video. To start with you might like to imagine a thread that draws your belly button back towards your spine, it's a start. The third lock is Jhalandara, throat lock, just bring your chin down towards your chest, ideally the space between your clavicle\n\nThe first four videos are straight forward Ujaii breathing (constrict the throat to make yourself sound a little like Darth Vader) building up the ratios. The first one is 1;1;1, five seconds inhale, five holding the breath and five exhaling. The second one has the same ratio but includes the bandhas so 1;1;1;1. The next one doubles the exhale 1;1;2;1 and the fourth doubles the holding of the inhale so 1;2;2;1 thats 5 second inhale/ 10 seconds hold /10 seconds exhale/ 5 seconds for the bandhas.\n\nThe next group, five, six and seven are basically doing the same thing, building up the ratios, but employ Nadi Shodana, alternating the nostrils.\n\nPranayama 8 is one of my favourites. It's Ujaii Pranayama but with mantra. While inhaling you chant in your head the first part of the Pranayama mantra then chant the second part while holding the breath and chant the final part as you exhale. I've made it 1;1;1;1; but you can slow down the speed of your chanting to change the ratio.\n\nPranayama 9 is my standard, everyday, Pranayama practice. The ratio is 1;4;2;1 and I chant the full pranayama mantra while retaining the breath after the inhale.\n\nThe final video is Viloma Ujaii with mantra and at the same ratio 1;4;2;1. This alternates the nostrils as in nadi Shaodana but also includes ujaii breathing. It's tricky but quite something once you get the hang of it.\n\nI should also mention the Kapalibhati I put up a couple of weeks ago as I always do that before starting my Pranayama, kind of the link between my asana practice and the Pranayama.\n\nVIDEO TUTORIALS\n\n123. yogic postures for `breathing exercises p247\n\nThe following Pranayamas are taken from Ramaswami's other book 'Yoga for the three stages of life'.\n\n126.

In fact according to Brahmananda who\n\nwrote an important commentary of Hathayogapradeepika, Hatha yoga is\n\nindeed Pranayama. Patanjali in his Yoga Sutras succinctly gives the\n\nparameters of pranayama along with the benefits. Hathayoga pradeepika\n\nand several other hatha yohga texts talk about a variety of pranayamas\n\nwith different ratios in considerable detail and as I said enough\n\nliterature is available on pranayama. However since it is also the\n\nanga prior to the antaranga or meditation, parts of yoga pranayama has\n\nbeen used to prepare oneself for meditation. If in pranayama you can\n\nintroduce some noble thoughts for meditation like an uplifting mantra,\n\nbhava thought or an image such pranayamas are called sagarbha\n\npranayama or pranayama pregnant with lofty ideas. Sri Krishnamacharya\n\nin his “Nathamini's Yoga Rahasya” says that sagarbha pranayama is\n\nseveral times more beneficial; more than the mechanical pranayama done\n\ngenerally by hatha yogis.\n\nSagarbha pranayama done with pranayama mantra from the vedas, which\n\nalso includes the potent gayatri as a part of it, has been in vogue\n\nsince the vedic times. Sri Krishnamacharya in his yoga work\n\n“Nathamuni's Yoga Rahasya” gives a number of instructions for doing\n\npranayama towards the end of the first chapter. He commends the use of\n\nPranava and the pranayama mantra with gayatri while doing pranayama\n\npractice. Usually pranava (OM), the most potent mantra and the mother\n\nof all mantras, as a stand alone mantra is used by renunciates like\n\nconsummate yogis and advaitins. And the gayatri impregnated vedic\n\npranayama mantra is used by householders and others in all pranayama.\n\nIn fact Manu in his famous Manusmriti says that the pranayama mantra\n\nwhich consists of prnava, the seven vyahritis, the gayatri and the\n\nhead or siras portion should be recited while holding the breath in\n\nKumbhaka three times to be called as pranayama. Sri Krishnamacharya\n\nalso emphasizes the need to meditate on the meaning of the mantras\n\nlike the suggestion of Patanjali in YS.\n\nMost people who do ritualistic pranayama in India use the pranayama\n\nmantra referred to earlier. Manusmiti says as follows\n\n“sa vyahritim sa pranavaam\n\ngayatriim sirasa saha\n\ntrifpateth ayataf pranah\n\npranayamassa uchyate”\n\nHere is the translation“Pranayama is that in which the seven vyahritis\n\n(bhuh bhuvaha...) each preceded by pranava (OM) then the gayatri, then\n\nthe siris are (silently) recited.”\n\nIt should be chanted (silently) while holding the breath (kumbhaka).\n\nWhen it is done three times it is called panayama. The pranayama\n\nmantra is 64 syllables and takes about 20 seconds to chant, more or\n\nless. The verse quoted above says three times and some interpret it as\n\nchanting the mantra three times while holding the breath, but\n\ngenerally it is chanted once and three such pranayamas will make one\n\nbundle of pranayama. If you try to do the chant thrice in one go it\n\nwould taken a minute and holding the breath for one minute could be a\n\nreal challenge to most and so most people stick to the earlier\n\noption.\n\nWhat about the duration for inhalation and exhalation? Sri\n\nKrishnamacharya says in Yoga Rahasya that it should be vishamavritti\n\nindicating that the time duration for inhalation exhalation and breath\n\nholding would vary. So many go by the 1:4:2 ratio.\n\nOne may inhale for 5 seconds then chant the mantra during internal\n\nholding for 20 seconds and then exhale for 10 seconds. The breath\n\nholding after exhalation is considered a hathayoga practice and many\n\northodox people who do pranayama as part of the Puja or Japa ritual\n\ndispense with bahya kumbhaka and the bandhas. The quickie pranayama is\n\nthree times but it is recommended that on should do 10 times the\n\nsamantra pranayama. (Contrast this with the hathayoga approach of\n\ngoing up to 80 times mantraless pranayama).\n\nSince children sometimes as young as 5 were initiated into vedic\n\nstudies, it becomes obligatory for them to do sandhya and hence mantra\n\npranayama and silent gayatri chant. But then because they are young\n\nthey may not be taught to do calibrated pranayama. Usually in course\n\nof time they would learn to do long inhalation and exhalation say in\n\nnadishodhana. Later they will be taught the whole vishamavritti\n\npranayama as explained earlier.\n\nSo the mantra is chanted silently in pranayama. But most people just\n\nchant the mantra without the pranayama--they may merely touch the nose\n\nbut not do the pranayama. So we have one set of people who do\n\npranayama without mantras as most hatha yogis do and another group\n\nespecially in India who chant the mantra faithfully but do not do the\n\nprnayama at all and thus both lose out. It even led the much revered\n\nprevious Sankaracharya of Kanchi to remark that if only Indians would\n\nhold the breath (kumbhaka) rather than just touch/hold the nose they\n\nwould all become great yogis and spiritual persons.\n\nMy Guru also said that when doing any mantra in japa, in pranayama or\n\nmeditation, one should think of the meaning or import of the mantra.\n\nThat makes it lot more powerful and meaningful. What does this mantra\n\nsignify, many times we get initiated into a mantra routine without\n\nknowing what it means. All yogis know that Patanjali insists on\n\ncontemplating on the meaning of pranava when doing pranava japa to get\n\nthe grace of Iswara.\n\n“Om Bhuh, om bhuvah, om suvah, om mahah, om janah, om tapah, om\n\nsatyam; then the gayatri and then the siras which runs like this, ”om\n\napah jyoti rasah amrtam brahma bhurbhuvassuvarom” is the pranayama\n\nmantra. This mantra appears in Mahanarayana Upanishad, the last\n\nchapter of Yajur veda. This upanishad also contains several beautiful\n\nmantras used on a daily basis like the offering to the five pranas\n\n(before taking food), meditating within the heart etc. I got the whole\n\nchapter (about 45 minutes of continuous chanting) recorded some 25\n\nyears back by “Sangeetha” and I believe it is available in some stores\n\nin Chennai, India. You may learn the pranayama mantra—visit my website\n\nwww.vinyasakrama.com/chants and click on the “Learn Pranayama Mantra\n\nchant” tab.\n\nSo what is the meaning of this wonderful pranayama mantra? Again there\n\nare different interpretations. The conventional meaning for the seven\n\nvyahritis is seven different worlds starting with the world we live in\n\nto six other higher worlds. But the word loka is interpreted in a more\n\nesoteric sense by a few scholars. They say that the words loka and\n\nlook are derived from the same root . And the seven lokas are the\n\nseven perceptions of the ultimate reality which is Brahman the pure\n\nnon changing consciousness.\n\nSo this approach which gels with the advaita philosophy would be as\n\nfollows: According to the Upanishads, Brahman in its pristine state is\n\nalone and there was no time or space (aksha and avakasha) in\n\ncontention. The Brahman once thought that it should become many\n\n(bahusyam praja yeyeti). Then in the next stage It deeply contemplated\n\nas to how it should create the universe and make many microcosmic\n\nindividual consciousness. This state was known as the stage of tapas\n\nof the Brahman (sa tapo tapyata). Then after deep contemplation and\n\nplanning It created the entire Universe (idam sarvam asrujata). After\n\nthis creation the Brahman entered and permeated the entire Universe\n\n(tat eva anupravisat) and every being as the individual Self.\n\nThe seven vyahrutis are considered as representing the seven states of\n\nthe same consciousness four at the microcosmic level and three at the\n\ncosmic level. So when doing pranayama during breath holding\n\ninternally, one would say 'om bhuh', contemplate on the consciousness,\n\nrepresented by pranava or 'om during the waking state. Then as the\n\nsecond vyahriti 'om bhuvah ' is recited, one would think of the same\n\nconsciousness being aware of the individual dream state.\n\n'om suvah” would refer to the same consciousness witnessing the deep\n\nsleep stage. Om mahah, the fourth vyahriti is the consciousness beyond\n\nthe three earlier mentioned known amongst the vedantins as the fourth\n\nstate of the mind (turiya) or the yogi's kaivalya state. The same\n\nconsciousness now is identified with the Brahmana that created the\n\nUniverse (Om Janah). Then the next mantra, the sixth “Om tapah” would\n\nrepresent the Brahman as one deeply contemplating and finally the\n\npristine state of consciousness “Om satyam” the one and only Brahaman.\n\nWith this the abhyasi is able to identify and meditate upon the same\n\none Brahaman as seen in different states. The theory that there is\n\nonly one consciousness that exists both at the cosmic and at the\n\nmicrocosmic level is the bedrock of the advaita (No two\n\nconciousnesses) viewpoint. So an advaitin while doing pranayama is\n\nable to reinforce the advaitic conviction.\n\nThen the second part of the pranayama mantra is the gayatri mantra. It\n\nagain refers to the ultimate reality as the inner light. Just as the\n\nsun with its lustrous orb lights the entire world, the Brahman/Self\n\nlights the entire chitta or the internal world of the meditator, so\n\nthat the chitta vrittis are experienced or 'seen' in the mind's eye .\n\nThe last portion known as the siras or the head, is an encomium to the\n\nultimate Brahman. It refers to It as OM., pure consciousness, the\n\nuniversal light, the essence of the entire Universe, immortal\n\n(unchanging), the source of the universe, and is known to the\n\nindividual as the inner Self during the three states of waking, dream\n\nand deep sleep.\n\nThis meaning of the pranayama mantra is vividly brought to the mind as\n\nthe pranayama mantra is recited silently during antah kumbhaka. Then\n\nit is known as samantraka or sagarbha pranayama. According to Manu\n\nthis samantra pranayama is the greatest Tapas/meditation.\n\nIt is said that those who are well versed in the chakras are able to\n\nidentify the seven vyahritis with the seven chakras in the body using\n\nthe respective bijakshara or seed mantras. Some make an effort to\n\nvisualize the cosmic Brahman in the seven chakras in the microcosm\n\nitself.\n\nThere are other types of mantras used. For instance saivaites tend to\n\nchant the siva mantras as they hold the breath as mentioned in the\n\nTamil Saiva classic “Tirumandiram”. The mantra “sivasiva” of four\n\nsyllables is chanted 16 times during one breath hold corresponding to\n\n64 syllables as in the pranayama mantra referred to earlier.\n\nHere is a pranayama for renunciates:\n\nWhile doing puraka or inhalation the thought would be that the entire\n\nuniverse is ultimately drawn into the Brahman. Then while in\n\nantahkumbhaka the contemplation would be that the outside Universe and\n\nI are no different from the Brahman. Then while exhaling the ego “I'\n\nwith the entire Universe is discarded as nothing but an illusion, not\n\nreal, not significant. And in bahya kumbhaka one would contemplate\n\nthat pure Brahman alone is real, It alone exists.\n\nThose who believe in the reality of world and the trinity (Brahma,\n\nVishnu and Siva), would use pranayama to reinforce their faith.\n\nInhaling through the left nostril one should think of the four faced\n\nBrahma the creator aspect of the trinity and of blood red hue (rajas\n\nguna) while chanting Om 16 times. Then closing both the nostrils and\n\nholding the breath in kumbhaka one should think of the white colored\n\n(satva guna) Hari, the protector/sustainer chanting pranava 64 times.\n\nThen while exhaling through the right nostril one should meditate on\n\nSiva of dark color (tamo guna) chanting pranava 32 times. Then one\n\nshould start inhaling through the right nostril for 16 matras chanting\n\npranava 16 times and continue the pranayama for a predetermined number\n\nof times with both mantra and bhava.\n\nDifferent smritis and very old yoga texts refer to a variety of\n\npranayamas with and without mantras. Almost all the puranas have a\n\nsection on yoga which describe different asanas and pranayamas. (I\n\nthink with all this evidence one may say with some conviction that\n\nYoga is more than 100 years old). For more information on pranayama\n\nyou may consider referring to my book “Yoga for the Three Stages of\n\nLife” pages 189 to 211.\n\nSri Krsishnamacharya's Yoga teachings were unique and very rich. In\n\nVinyasakrama asana practice, breath synchronization with slow\n\nmovements is an essential element. One would start the movement with\n\nthe beginning of inhalation or exhalation and complete the movement\n\nwith the completion of that breathing phase. The time taken in actual\n\npractice may be between 5 to 10 or 12 seconds depending on one's\n\ncapacity and control. If it goes below 5 seconds one would stop the\n\npractice and rest to regain the vinyasa krama acceptable breath. My\n\nGuru, Sri T Krishnamacharya would say 'breathe with hissing sound' (a\n\nla cobra, refer to ananta samapatti in YS) or 'with a mild rubbing\n\nsensation in the throat'.\n\nIn this way, with long deep inhalation and exhalation, the intercostal\n\nmuscles are stretched and toned up and by the time pranayama is\n\nstarted the accessory muscles of breathing are well exercised so that\n\none has a well oiled breathing apparatus for a very productive\n\npranayama practice. And while doing pranayam introduction of mantras\n\nand bhavas helps to bring the mind to a focus which will be of\n\nconsiderable help when one starts the meditation process. Thus Sri\n\nKrishnamacharya following the tradition of yoga described in old yoga\n\ntexts like the yoga sutras, the puranas, smritis and other ancient\n\ntexts helped to understand and achieve the best of an outstanding\n\nancient system called Yoga.\n\nYou may access the earlier Newsletter by visiting my website\n\nwww,vinyasakrama.com and clicking on the Newsletter tab.

P R A N A Y A M A - An Absolute necessity in YOGA\n\n- A dedicated homage to my father and teacher,\n\nSri T. KRISHNAMACHARYA.\n\n... by T.K.SRIBHASHYAM, Nice, FRANCE\n\nhttp://www.yogakshemam.net/English/homepage.html\n\nWhatever be the reason for teaching Yoga, it is a certainty that the pupil, slowly but definitely, quests for the ULTIMATE REALITY. Even if multitudes of methods, school, ideas and individuation have drifted Yoga from its real value, yet, it is because of the incessant search of pupils that Yoga continues to have an important place in the inner reflections of people all around the world.\n\nThis drift from the real nature of Yoga might have many reasons. Amongst them the lack of importance given to PRANAYMA in one's practice cannot be ignored.\n\nVery often false reasons are invoked to keep PRANAYAMA away from one's teaching or practice. Still, there is not one teacher nor one school that does not talk of PRANA.\n\nIt is true that the Yogic way for the quest of inner Self and the Search for God Realisation through Pranayama is not a simple subject. This should not be an excuse for not introducing it in the practice sessions of pupils whether they practice regularly or not.\n\nIn fact, Pranayama maintains and keeps our spiritual life alive, just as our breath that keeps our biological one alive. For the same reason very often Pranayama is confounded with our physiological breath. Indeed, the relation between the two seems so juxtaposed that we get mixed up. It is just like a tool and the basic raw material out of which the tool is made up of. The tool is so much and so often used that we seldom think of the importance of the basic metal that give birth to the tool. Still, we know that the quality and the value of the basic material are the determining factors for the utility, value and life of the tool. Same way, in the eyes of the Yogic Masters, our physiological breath is but a tool.\n\nThe Great Masters of India used this relation to the utmost and derived great benefit in their spiritual quest. They did not use the physiological breathing merely to increase the vital reserves, but valued it more in a metaphysical sense. Since the physical breath is but a product of the basic material, this product should help us `know' that basic material!\n\nThat is to say, by `going beyond' the product, in which the basic material is present, one should be able to find it in its `natural form'. This, the VEDAS and the UPANISHADS call PRANA, and that which helps go beyond is AAYAMA. So much so, the means by which the physical breath is used to `go beyond' are termed\n\nPRANAYAMA.\n\nPRANAYAMA is part and parcel of any Yogic approach worth its name. Moreover, it is not out of place to take note that no Hindu ritual starts without a Pranayama. This does not mean that Yoga is a religious act, but since it has its root in Hinduism, we cannot but consider it as our reference.\n\nComing to the practical aspects, Yogic Science has given clear cut rules for the introduction of Pranayama in any Practice Session. Later studies have given light on their physiological actions on the human body as a whole.\n\nHere we shall content ourselves with some fundamental principles:\n\n1. Those that act mainly on the Physiological functions,\n\nas for eg. UJJAYI ANULOMA and SHITHALI.\n\n2. Those that act mainly on the Nervous System,\n\nas for eg. UJJAYI VILOMA, UJJAYI PRATHILOMA and\n\nNADI SHODHANA,\n\n3. Those that work on the mental plane,\n\nas for eg. NADI SHODHANA with Bahya Kumbhaka and\n\nSURYA BHEDHANA,\n\n4. Those that maintain the Spiritual Quest,\n\nlike the SAMA VRITHI in NADI SHODHANA, and SURYA BHEDANA\n\nboth of them as SAGARBHA PRANAYAMA\n\nLet us briefly recapitulate the technique of the above Pranayama, remembering that the Pranayama are done in a sitting posture (VAJRA ASANA or PADMA ASANA), and that the back should be straight, without any cushion or pillow under the hips.\n\nUJJAYI ANULOMA: Inhalation (PURAKA) through both nostrils in UJJAYI, Exhalation (RECHAKA) through Left Nostril, without ujjayi, Inhalation through both nostrils in Ujjayi, and Exhalation through the Right Nostril, without Ujjayi. These two breaths making one Cycle of Ujjayi Anuloma.\n\nSHITHALI: Slightly open the mouth, bring out the tongue, fold it lengthwise, to make it resemble a tube, Inhale (aspire) through the mouth. At the end of the Inhalation, draw back the tongue, close the mouth, and Exhale through Ujjayi, by both the nostrils.\n\nUJJAYI VILOMA: Inhale through the Left Nostril, without using Ujjayi, Exhale through Ujjayi, with both the nostrils open. Inhale, again through the Right Nostril, without using Ujjayi, and Exhale through Ujjayi, with both the nostrils open. This forms one Cycle.\n\nUJJAYI PRATHILOMA: Inhale through Ujjayi, Exhale by the Left Nostril, Inhale by Left Nostril, Exhale by Ujjayi, Inhale by Ujjayi, Exhale by Right Nostril, Inhale by Right Nostril, and Exhale by Ujjayi. These 4 breaths make one cycles, and to be of any value, a minimum of 4 cycles or 16 breaths is needed.\n\nNADI SHODHANA: This is a Pranayama where no ujjayi should ever be used. Inhale by the Left Nostril, Exhale by the Right Nostril, Inhale by the Right Nostril, Exhale by the Left Nostril.\n\nIt is to be noted that a Pranayama can have KUMBHAKA: either after Inhalation (called ANTAH KUMBHAKA) or after Exhalation (called BAHYA KUMBHAKA)\n\nSAMA VRITHI: Sama Vrithi is a Pranayama imperatively practiced in NADI SHODHANA. In this Pranayama, while following the technique of Nadi Shodhana, the time allotted to Puraka, Antah Kumbhaka, Rechaka and Bahya Kumbhaka should be the same. For eg. Puraka = Antah Kumbhaka = Rechaka = Bahya Kumbhaka = 5\".\n\nSURYA BHEDHANA: Once again, this Pranayama should be done only in Nadi Shodhana. Here, the Puraka, Antah Kumbhaka and Rechaka would have a proportional time measure. The Antah Kumbhaka should be 4 times the measure of Puraka, while that of Rechaka should be of twice the measure of Puraka. To cite an example: Puraka = say 8\", the Antah Kumbhaka = 32\" while the Rechaka = 16\".\n\nIt goes without saying that a Practice session has to have a Pranayama at the beginning and one at the end, and a minimum of 12 breaths in each.\n\n1. UJJAYI ANULOMA or SHITHALI are the Pranayama that is to be introduced at the start of any Practice Session. Ujjayi Anuloma is more congenial in Autumn and Winter, whereas Shithali is better suited to Spring and Summer. Ujjayi Anuloma removes weariness coming from excess of mental or physical work, sentimental or emotional shock, fatigue coming from improper digestion in the small intestines leading to unwholesome assimilation. It also stabilises the mental state. Moreover, it has the possibility of providing and maintaining continuity in the mental states obtained in different Sessions.\n\nSHITHALI is more a Pranayama that establishes the digestion, maintaining an `acide-base balance'. It soothes the sense perception, has a tendency to remove the weariness of the sense organs.\n\nIf ANTAH KUMBHAKA is more complementary to Ujjayi Anuloma, Shithali goes generally well with Bahya Kumbhaka. In Ujjayi Anuloma, the duration of Kumbhaka should not exceed half the time of Puraka, while in Shithali, either Antah Kumbhaka or Bahya Kumbhaka should not exceed 5\".\n\nThe specificity of the 2 Pranayama is that they can be given at the beginning and or at the end of a Session.\n\n2 UJJAYI VILOMA is a Pranayama, acting more on the nervous system, even though the practitioner finds relief in his mental state. It soothes the nervous irritations, or excitements coming mainly from emotional, affective or sentimental overcharge in one's life. Its action is very fast, so much so, it should be practised for a short duration say, for a continuous period of 15 days, followed by Ujjayi Anuloma which stabilises the results obtained through Ujjayi Viloma. As the technical word Viloma indicates, the `movement' of the mind in this Pranayama is transcendental but `intensified', it is not advisable to practice Ujjayi Viloma at the end of a session, if the practitioner is to have a social life immediately after his practice. Care should be taken in not introducing Ujjayi Viloma in case of mental depression, or in depressive tendencies. Ujjayi Anuloma is the Pranayama for all sorts of mental depressions.\n\nUJJAYI PRATHILOMA acts both on the nervous systems and on the thought processes So much so, it removes all nervous excitement, bringing back to normalcy the nervous impulses, removes the interferences of superficial thought processes thereby providing a clear mental space. We can say, that Ujjayi Prathiloma suits to those who live under such extreme emotional stress that they are unable to forget it, neither are they able to do anything else. Once again this Pranayama is to be practised for 2 weeks, replaced by Ujjayi Anuloma. It is to be remembered that Ujjayi Prathiloma should be practised for a minimum of 16 breaths. It works very well in the beginning of a session. If practiced late in the evening, it induces sleep. If this Pranayama is introduced, care should be taken to see that Ujjayi Anuloma finds its place in the end of the session. This Pranayama is very suitable to get oneself free from the after affect of emotional shocks.\n\nWhile Bahya Kumbhaka is more suitable to Viloma, no Kumbhaka is advisable in Prathiloma.\n\nAs for NADI SHODHANA, it is always a Pranayama of the end of the session. For convenient practice of Nadi Shodhana, one should have had some practice of Ujjayi Anuloma, Sarvanga Asana, and if possible Shirsha Asana. The action of this Pranayama, without Kumbhaka, is not so much on the biological changes in the body. Its action is more on the clarity of sense perception, removal of sense confusions, attentiveness of the mind. It should not be practiced when there is nervous irritability, emotional shock, or fear of spiritual sentiments, particularly in those who do not believe in the value of a Divine Support, or where there is excess of fatigue. Suitable Pranayama should be practiced at first to improve one's condition before working on Nadi Shodhana. It is always conceivable to have done either Badha Kona Asana or Maha Mudra or Paschimathana Asana as the last Asana before doing Nadi Shodhana.\n\n3. NADI SHODHANA with Bahya Kumbhaka influences more the mental plane. When we talk of mental plane, we talk of the emotions (ANUBHAAVA) and sentiments (STHAAYI BHAVA), having their physical or physiological response. A disturbed mind, is the mind whose natural functions are overtaken by emotions or sentiments. As long as these persist, mind will not be clarified, and without a clear mind (MANASSHUDHI) it is not possible to have an insight.\n\nNadi Shodhana with Bahya Kumbhaka breaks the link between the emotions, sentiments and their physiological response. So its action is more on the interrelation between the physical mode of emotions, and the emotional or sentimental impulse. It goes without saying that this Pranayama comes in the end of a session, that the duration of Bahya Kumbhaka should not exceed on fourth the time of Puraka, that the conditions mentioned for Nadi Shodhana (without Kumbhaka) apply here as well.\n\nSURYA BHEDHANA in view of the important Kumbhaka it has, can be practised only when one has the physical and mental capacity and capability to assume the Kumbhaka. Here we come to some of the important Pranayama of Yoga. The technique clearly shows that this Pranayama outwits the physiological basis of the respiratory system. Yet, when well practised, does not alter the O¨-CO¨ relations, and thus does not create any adverse reaction in the chemical imbalance in the body. Moreover this Pranayama has the possibility of maintaining the Alpha Waves at will. If the great Yoga Masters relayed on Surya Bhedhana, it should have been because they found that it works at the root of our emotions. A regular practice of this Pranayama provides a proper control of the emotional activities of the mind. This needs ample preparation and constant practice of Mudras like the Viparitha Karani, Maha Mudra, Ashvini Mudra and Asanas like Badha Kona Asana, Ardha Matsyendra Asana etc. That is to say, those that have the centre of action at the root of our emotional response -- the Naval (NAABHI). To obtain good results, this Pranayama is to be practiced sitting, facing East.\n\n4. For any spiritual quest, one has to purify the mind, in a way as to free it from sentiments, that are against those of the Creator or God. At the same time, the Home of the Soul, the Heart (HRUDAYA) should be cleared of all emotions, except those that are Divine. This can be done only if the outward tendencies of the sense perceptions revert towards Inward Insight (ATMA AVALOKANA). Since the Mind follows the senses, the sentiments follow the mind, the emotions follow the sentiments, PRANA follows the emotions, and the Soul (ATMA) follows Prana, we have to work in such a way as to reverse these outward tendencies. That is to say, as long as the sense perceptions do not look Inward, it would not be possible to bring back the Prana, the Mind and Soul into the Heart. This is the essential role of the Pranayama of the 4th Category.\n\nAll the Pranayama under this heading belong to principle of Nadi Shodhana. They are always to be practised at the end of a session. Further, they are to be followed by Nadi Shodhana with Concentration on HRUDAYA. The practice session containing Pranayama of this category should contain Asanas like Matsya Asana, Bhujanga Asana, Dhanura Asana, Sarvanga Asana, Shirsha asana, Ardha Matsyendra Asana, Badha Kona Asana, Paschimathana Asana. Moreover, the number of breaths used in all the Asanas and Mudras put together should be inferior to the number of breaths of all the Pranayama finding their place in the same Session. All the Pranayama of this series should be done facing East.\n\nAccording to Hindu Tradition, the Pranayama under this category should be SAGARBHA (= Conceivable). That is to say, during the practice of these Pranayama, the image in the Mental Space should be that of God, or a Divine Object of Contemplation, and there should be silent muttering of God's name (or a Mantra). Non believers in God, or those not having conviction in such an entity should adopt appropriate means. They can use a non-physical object like an unique Star, a Horizon Point or the Dark Hallow of the Early Morning Rising Sun. In any case, the object in the mind should be beyond the Time-Space Reality.\n\nThe SAMAVRITHI, to be effective should have a minimum of duration of 8 sec. at each phase (or 32 secs for one breath), and it is always practised in Nadi Shodhana. This Pranayama works at the base of our Verbal Expressions. This, in the Manifested State (VYAKTHA) is located in the Perineum (MULA), while at the Unmanifested state (AVYAKTHA) it is situated in NAABHI, considered as the Link between the Creator and Man. From the Manifested Sound Expression, the Shabda (the sound) assumes `colour' through the emotions, which find their root at Naabhi. (It is to be noted that the SHIRSHA or the fontanelle becomes the link between Man and the Creator, in his transcendental path). So much so, Naabhi has a dual role: That of linking the creator with man, and that of `shading' the manifested sound through emotions. This manifest sound, is what is at the basis of expression--spoken or otherwise, and when used through words, becomes language or as the Indian Psychology calls ALAMKARA (= Aesthetic Language). All our reactions -- sentimental or emotional -- raise from the interactions or the disequilibrium amongst these various localisations. As long as a perfect balance is not acquired between these, man is subject to emotional disturbances and they will not provide him Peace of Mind (CHITHA SHANTI). SAMAVRITHI PRANAYAMA acts in this direction. Its main centre of action is at Naabhi, and its aim is to delay the emotional activities, a delay sufficient for the mind not to follow the emotions. The actions of this Pranayama is not felt immediately, but in our daily life.\n\nIt is imperative to have had long practice of the Pranayama of the 3rd Category, before putting into practice those indicated in this last category. Moreover, this Pranayama is efficacious only if the mind is in concentration with some Vital Points like Naasagra, Kanta, Hrudaya, Kurma Nadi, Naabhi. The Points to be chosen depends on the psychological constitution and emotional set up of the student. This Pranayama has a good complementary if Ujjayi Anuloma 16 breaths is introduced at the beginning of a session. Similarly, Samavrithi is not to be practiced when one is under an emotional stress or in a depressive mood. Also, it is advisable not to practice this Pranayama when one is not used to Concentrate on Vital Points. The above mentioned actions of this Pranayama reside mainly on the Concentration Points introduced (SAGARBHA PRANAYAMA). If practiced as a respiratory exercise, it has every chance of bringing to surface emotions with their physiological response. The importance of this Pranayama in Yoga is to be measured from the fact that it is one the very few Pranayama with Kumbhaka as long as Rechaka that the Yogic Literature describe.\n\nWe now come to the Pranayama that has already been reviewed under the 3rd Category (SURYA BHEDHANA). Technically speaking, this Pranayama is the same as the one we studied before. But in this category the aim is to render Prana its natural and original function of being in close association with ATMA, and to show ATMA the path of the Supreme soul (PARAMATHMA) or the Creator. (It is here that we understand the meaning of Prana Aayama: extending Prana towards the Creator). In this Surya Bhedhana, concentration is an essential factor. The concentration during Puraka (Inhalation) is used in such a way as to centralise all the mental faculties including the sensorial ones in HRUDAYA, to stabilise them in HRUDAYA during Antah Kumbhaka, so that cleared of all influences with regard to the external world, the mind reflects itself, during Rechaka, its Original Nature of revealing the qualities of Atma.\n\nThis Pranayama is also called ABHYANTARA VRITHI (or the Inner Movement), because the Sense and the Mental activities instead of going outward, turn inwards. In this Pranayama, the Concentration Points applied are: Naasagra, Bhrumadhya, Lalaata, Kanta, Kurma Nadi and Hrudaya.\n\nYet another Pranayama, which should be practised facing East. The effect of this Pranayama, is increased if followed by a Prayer. It would not be a repetition, if it is said that a Practice Session having this Pranayama should have only the Asanas and Mudra as is indicated under Sama Vrithi. Moreover, the only occasion when Nadi Shodhana, can be introduced as a Pranayama at the beginning of the session, is when Surya Bhedhana as mentioned here finds its place in the end of the session, and the Asanas and Mudra are those that are mentioned under Sama Vrithi.\n\nHere are but some indications for the application of Pranayama, and it is beyond doubt that if properly used, under the keen observation and guidance of a Teacher, any student of Yoga will find the real value and benefit that Yoga Stands for.\n\n---------------------\n\nv. REVIEW OF A PRANAYAMA APP\n\nPranayama? There's an App for that.\n\nSo yes, an app for Pranayama. It's not ideal, it would be nice to have more control and be able to set your own ratios and/or time for each section. I want a 1:4:2:1 ratio of 5/20/10/5 seconds but it's a little awkward working out how to do that. I pretty much managed it, eventually, with the Advanced setting set at level 3.\n\nI like using it because I kept losing count and forgetting where I was, especially with Viloma Ujaii. Best of all though is sticking it on at work while repairing, great when your doing something you don't have to think about to much like striping down an old sax.\n\nA 20 second retention gives me enough time to silently chant the Pranayama mantra.\n\nHere's a little demo of how I'm using it. This is the first app. demo I've done so excuse the thumb in all the wrong places. I think it's going for 2.99 GBP\n\nHere's a link to the developers site and more professional demo's\n\nI've settled into a routine now of finishing my practice with Kapalabhati (bellows like breathing) I do 108 of those, split into three, 36 in Padmasana (lotus) then 36 in Utpluthi (Lift up) and another 36 with my arms raised up bent back, hands crossed on my shoulders. I then do ten minutes of Nadi Sodana. I follow that with meditation, ten to twenty minutes depending on how I am for time. In the evening I do the same amount of pranayama, some more chanting and a longer sit.\n\nNadi Sodana Pranayama\n\nInhale : 5 seconds. Left nostril\n\nretain : 20 seconds. Chant Pranayama mantra in my head\n\nexhale : 10 seconds. Right nostril\n\nretain : 5 seconds. Engage Locks\n\nrepeat\n\nThis is the Pranayama mantra I use.\n\nAnd here's a link to Srivatsa Ramaswami teaching the Pranayama Mantra\n\nAs well as teaching some other Chants, including the Yoga Sutra's here http://vinyasakrama.com/Chants\n\n--------------------\n\nvi. A note on counting 'rounds' of pranayama\n\nThis can get confusing. How DO we count a round of pranayama?\n\nI used to think that there where many kinds of pranayama, suryabheda, nadi shodana, Ujjayi, Viloma Ujjayi shodana... but this is problematic, suryabheda involves one inhalation and exhalation, nadi shodana includes inhalation and exhalation through both nostrils so involves two breaths and viloma ujjayi shodana, both nostrils and the throat so three breaths. If we count each cycle as a 1 pranayama nadi shaodana is going to take twice as long as suryabheda and viloma ujjayi shodana, three times as long.\n\nHowever, my understanding now is that one pranayama equals one breath. This is often counted as one inhalation followed by kumbhaka (breath retention). obviously you would then inhale and perhaps include another kumbhaka after the inhalation before Inhaling again for the second pranayama.\n\nTherefore...\n\na cycle of suryabheda counts as 1 pranayama\n\na cycle of anuloma or pratiloma Ujjayi counts as 1 pranayama\n\na cycle of nadi shodana counts as 2 pranayamas\n\na cycle of Viloma Ujjayi shodana counts as 3 pranayamas\n\nSo to get to 80 pranayamas I can choose to include cycles of\n\n10 x Suryabheda = 10 pranayamas\n\n10 x Chandrabheda = 10 pranayamas\n\n10 x Anuloma ujjayi = 10 pranayamas\n\n10 x pratiloma ujjayi = 10 pranayamas\n\n10 x Nadi shodana = 20 pranayamas\n\n5 x Viloma Ujjayi Shodana = 15 pranayamas\n\n5 x sitali = 5 pranayamas\n\n----------------------\n\n80 pranayama\n\nor perhaps another combination of the above or some of the other pranayama techniques.\n\nPersonally, given the time I like to stick to ten of each as it takes me a couple or cycles before I settle into the rhythm. Also, although I'm currently exploring some of the different techniques and exploring longer inhalations or kumbhakas etc I probably prefer more time on each approach.\n\nMy ideal, after this period of experimentation, would probably be\n\n10 x Suryabheda = 10 pranayamas\n\n20 x nadi shodana = 40 pranayamas\n\n10 x viloma ujjayi shodana = 30 pranayamas\n\n10 x sitali (in warmer weather) = 10 pranayamas\n\n....which actually comes to 90 pranayamas if we include the the sitali but what the heck.\n\nHow long each cycle takes depends on your ratio. In suryabheda at the beginning I'm doing\n\na shorter kumbhaka using the gayatri mantra (10 seconds) but building up to longer inhalations and exhalations (fifteen seconds each) and a short kumbhala after inhalations.\n\nIn nadi shodana I'm doing my regular\n\n5 second inhalation/20 second kumbhaka (with the pranayama mantra) /10 second exhalation/five second kumbhaka, for the first ten cycles.\n\nfor the second 10 cycles I'm doing Krishnamacharya's One minute breath\n\n15 second inhalation/20 second Kumbhka (with pranayama mantra)/ 15 second exhalation/ 10 second kumbhaka\n\nIn Viloma ujjayi shodana or sitali I'm exploring the longer kumbhaka after exhalation, chanting the pranayama twice (40 seconds).\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nMatthew Sweeney Vinyasa Unlocked DVD\n\nNow this is interesting, a couple of videos from Matthew Sweeney appeared on YouTube this morning. First one looks particularly interesting....\n\nand yet....\n\nAnd yet I wonder who it's aimed at.\n\nExcellent Mathew has those beginner versions of Sun Salutations, the stepping back, stepping forward, leading up to finally jumping forward but then he continues on up to floating back and floating up again to standing even via handstands. Same goes for jump back and jump through, beginner variations moving on up to advanced fancy Ashtanga.\n\nIt's a DVD for buying early in your practice perhaps and keeping hold of as you progress.\n\nI was wondering though if it was for me.\n\nI'm long passed those beginner variations and in a sense I'm passed all the fancy stuff too in that I'm no longer interested in a floaty stylised practice. These days I prefer to keep it simple, stripped back/down, my jump through of choice these days is Sharath's delicate little hop.\n\nBut then again perhaps it's not about being fancy, showy, there's a subtlety there in those floats up and back, a shifting of body weight, control rather than effort, craft. Perhaps it's time to revisit some of these, not for the showiness (whose to see anyway in my home practice) but for the subtlety, the delicacy and as my thoughts turn once again towards full vinyasa, for the conservation of energy.\n\nSo perhaps it is for me after all, very curious to know what else is on the DVD, not much on the website but it does say it's comprehensive.\n\nUpcoming DVDs due in 2013\n\nVinyasa Unlocked (a comprehensive technique DVD)\n\nThe video reminds me of Mathhew's 2nd book Vinyasa Krama (not to be confused with Ramaswami's Vinyasa krama). Most of the book is taken up with the five alternative sequences, the Moon sequence for example below, but there is a wonderful section at the beginning where Matthew goes through the development of Jumping back and through, backbends etc.\n\nHere's what he has to say about it on his Website Yoga Temple\n\nVINYASA KRAMA: Five Unique Sequences\n\n2nd Edition\n\nExperience the ancient method of Yoga retold in these five flowing Vinyasa Series.\n\nThey are called the Moon Sequence, the Lion Sequence, the Bound Sequence, the Flying Sequence and the Fifth Sequence. Each series emphasises different aspects of the body and mind to create an overall Yoga program for any level of ability. They progress through basic, intermediate and advanced asana. The first two series are a great introduction to Yoga for the beginner and the later series offer inspiring possibilities for the experienced practitioner. Alternatives are provided for each of the sequences with practical and safe guidance for adapting to many individual difficulties and injuries. Each of the sequences is linked to specific breathing and meditation techniques which are accessible and safe for all levels. In addition this book provides a comprehensive visual asana library displaying over 850 individual postures. Vinyasa Krama is an extensive one of a kind resource for teachers and students of any Yoga tradition.\n\nThis updated 2nd Edition of the book is now printed in an easy to use A4 portrait style, similar to As It Is. Most of the book has been updated, including some of the written text, the Mula Bandha section and some details on Pranayama. Each of the sequences has been refined and adjusted, in particular the sequencing and postures for Chandra Krama and Simha Krama have been changed and some small corrections to each of the other series. Vinyasa Krama is now greatly improved.\n\nIf you have a previous copy I do recommend purchasing the 2ndversion, unfortunately I cannot offer a discount through the website. Any student attending one of my workshops with a signed copy of the first edition (A3) can get a discount for the new version.\n\nI reviewed the book briefly here a few years back (2008) , unfortunately I bought the huge A3 version, bit unwieldily, much better in the current A4 version I think .\n\nThere's also an excellent Asana dictionary at the back.\n\nA video also appeared on Matthew's Moon Sequence this morning\n\nMuch more on his website about this one\n\nCHANDRA KRAMA: THE MOON SEQUENCE[DVD]\n\nThis DVD is the first of a series of flowing Asana practices designed by Matthew Sweeney. Chandra Krama is intended as a support to your regular weekly Yoga practice, whether it is Ashtanga Yoga, Hatha Yoga or some other style or tradition.\n\nThe Moon Sequence is a gentle flowing Vinyasa form accessible for all levels. Although this sequence was originally intended for practice on the Full Moon, the New Moon and during the menstrual cycle, it is appropriate at any time for women and men.\n\nThis sequence emphasizes the hips, groin, lower spine and abdomen, which will feel awake and alive after moving through the postures. It takes pressure off the neck, shoulders and wrists and is useful as a regular alternative to the intensity of traditional Ashtanga Yoga. Whether old or young, this sequence is great for any age.\n\nI have to admit, despite having had Matthew's Vinyasa Krama book for, what, five years, I don't think I've ever tried any of the alternative five sequences he presents. As fixed sequences, Ashtanga Primary, Intermediate, Advanced A and B always seemed plenty. I bought Matthew's Vinyasa Book back then for all the Ashtanga info at the beginning and especially the jump back and back bending progressions.\n\nPerhaps because I never got on with the size (A3) of the first edition, I'd be tempted to practice along with the DVD or go to one of his Moon Sequence workshops just to see what it's like, how it feels, some I hear swear by it.\n\nI wonder if the video has instruction, if it's led with a voice over calling the postures etc., tricky to practice with otherwise, oh and can you turn the ruddy music off, can't be dealing with noise while I practice.\n\nUPDATE\n\nSome more details on the moon sequence DVD in comments to this post\n\nShira Fisher\n\n\"I'll have to check my Moon Sequence video to see if you can turn of the music (just checked it and couldn't turn off the music). There is instruction through the asana practice and I have to say the music and Matthew's voice don't turn me off in fact they are incredibly relaxing and don't take away from the practice at all like some of my videos that I have had to disregard because of the intolerable voice and music. The music is much more subtle than the video you posted above less instrumentation and chanting influenced. I also like that the video opens and closes with the ashtanga salutations. My practice is strictly Ashtanga Primary and the moon sequence. I am opening up more with all the hip opening of the moon sequence, back bends etc it really is complimentary to the Ashtanga practice in my bodies view of things. I recommend the moon sequence as it really feels like a natural fit to my Ashtanga practice\".\n\nThanks for filling in the gaps, I'm tempted to try it.\n\nHeard from somebody else that the music is \"very much not in the background\" and that \"you can't turn it off\" and that while they like the Moon sequence the music puts them off using the DVD.\n\nAshtangi's, we don't tend to like music when we practice.....or would you disagree?\n\n------------\n\nI should mention Matthew's first book while I'm at it.\n\nAshtanga Yoga As It Is\n\n3rd Edition\n\nThis is An Ashtanga blogger's essential text, mine is falling apart,\n\nWriting a post and need to check the spelling of a posture, Matthew's your man, quick and easy to find. It also has another section with all the vinyasas, the count etc. I've been taking this back and forth to the shala and the Mac for years, I need two copies. One propped up in the shala, perfect size to double check the sequence if your revisiting 2nd or Advanced after a period of time or learning them at home (perish the thought) and another copy beside the mac. Essential text.\n\nAnd lastly seeing as this as turned from a quick share of the two videos into a Matthew Sweeney post, mention again of Matthew's recent Article on Love Yoga Anatomy\n\nThe Evolution of Ashtanga Yoga 50 comments\n\nand the follow up\n\nAshtanga Yoga 70 years or 2000? 19 comments ( inc. a couple from me)\n\nand my own post on this\n\nDid Krishnamacharya teach Ashtanga Primary Series? Matthew Sweeney and the Origin of Ashtanga, Yoga Korunta and Vinyasa?\n\nand one more, a guest post by Marie HALLAGER Andersen\n\nGuest post - Ashtanga Yoga: practice with discipline but practice smart, a response to Matthew Sweeney's recent article\n\n↧\n\nKino, splits from Ashtanga. Trivikramasana, Supta trivikramasana, Hanumanasana, Sama konasana, Paschimottanasana\n\n\"37 Trivikramasana (Figure 4.85)\n\nThis has 7 vinyasas. From the 1st to the 5th vinyasas and then the 7th vinyasa, practise following those for utthita hasta padangushtasana. Practise the 2nd and 7th vinyasas as shown in the picture (study it carefully) and remain in these positions. The 2nd vinyasa is the right-side trivikramasana sthiti. The 6th vinyasa as shown is the left-side trivikramasana sthiti. The picture shown here only demonstrates the left-side trivikramasana. It is important that equal recaka and puraka kumbhaka must be carefully observed while practising this asana. Keep the gaze fixed on the midbrow. Both legs must be held straight and must not lean or bend to any side.\n\nBenefit: Not only will it maintain the body in an equal balanced sthiti, it will rapidly awaken kundalini. \" from Krishnamacharya's Yoga Makaranda\n\n------------------------\n\nHave to admit I was all Kino'd out for a while there.\n\nSo many videos, felt like a new one released everyday, too much.\n\nAll good stuff of course, Kino has the BEST practice tips, hopefully these will have found their way into her upcoming book, The power of Ashtanga yoga.\n\nWish she'd been making and releasing all these videos back when I first started, as it was I had to pretty much work it out for myself. You Home Ashtangi's just coming to the practice, don't realise how spoiled you are : )\n\nOne thing I never could work out for myself though was the splits, ....actually that's not true, I managed Hanumanasana eventually and even Samakonasana, although I haven't tried either for a year or so, both long gone.\n\nTrivikramasana and supta trivikramasana were the two postures from 3rd, or Advanced A, that I never felt I really nailed, they were lame attempts and perhaps the only postures left in Ashtanga that I thought would always be beyond me, just didn't believe I was built for them.\n\nHow often have we said that but here's Kino making you think that perhaps one spoke to soon. As ever she makes the impossible sound possible, even probable with the appropriate amount of practice and dedication.\n\nSo here are all Kino's recent split videos in one place. If you only have time to watch one I recommend the second on Supta Trivikramasanathat's the one that blew me away and reminded me why Kino still rocks.\n\nIf your still relatively new to the practice then don't even think about trying this (love you hamstrings, be good to them, the slightest pull will make practice uncomfortable for months and I won't even think about trying these again until after Manju's workshop in August.) but instead note that in all of these I think she stresses the importance of a good forward bend. Paschimottanasana that first asana in Primary series (apart from danadasana) that we so often take for granted ( know I used to ) still perhaps the greatest asana in all the Ashtanga series....with perhaps the exception of Samasthith.\n\nKino's Paschimottanasana video is at the end and I've also included Darby's because it's even better.\n\nAnd Tomorrow...\n\nTomorrow is my Day off,\n\nResearch day!\n\nLast week was this post\n\nResearch: Full Vinyasa Primary, 10 long slow full inhalations and exhalations in every asana. How Long?\n\nLast week was just too much at 3 hours 40 minutes. Trying to decide how to approach it tomorrow.\n\nA full Vinyasa with the long slow inhalations and exhalations?\n\nor\n\na regular primary but with 10 breaths in every posture?\n\n↧\n\nManju's Saxophone, a Buescher Super 400 Alto PLUS Taittiriya Upanishad SIKSHA VALLI and"
