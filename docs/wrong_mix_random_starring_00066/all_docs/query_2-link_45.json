Benediction is my personal favourite. Danielle Deadwyler in Till gave the single best performance. Robe of Gems was formally incredible. All the Beauty and the Bloodshed left me in a terrible state, which was exacerbated by the vulnerability that comes with being in a crowded British press screening. Went into Three Minutes not knowing what to expect and came out shattered. Next Sohee ticked my boxes in terms of slow-burning social critique and personal relatability.\n\nThe Quiet Girl is emotion-driven film-making which is something I try to prioritise in these lists. Our Bodies Are Your Battlefields was an underseen documentary about trans rights activism in Argentina that I loved. My other priority for these lists is to uplift films that other critics neglected.\n\nSome films that were seriously considered for this list were Funny Pages, Ali & Ava, Jeong-sun, 1976, Our Lady of the Chinese Shop and The Banshees of Inisherin.\n\nDiscoveries\n\nFinding Christa (Camille Billops, James Hatch)\n\nMaangamizi: The Ancient One (Martin Mhando, Ron Mulvihill)\n\nDessert for Constance (Sarah Maldoror)\n\nSchmoedipus (Barry Davis)\n\nSex, Lies, Religion (Annette Kennedy)\n\nOutlaw Poverty, Not Prostitution (Carol Leigh)\n\nIs This Fate?

First three films were seen at Cinema Rediscovered in July. Thank you to everyone who brought those films (and more) to Bristol. In particular, thanks to those who worked on the bell hooks: Reel to Real and the Women’s Stories from the Global South (& To Whom They Belong) strands. Two films (Sex, Lies, Religion and Is This Fate?) were seen thanks to the team at Another Screen, so thank you to them for their work. The Joycean Society was seen as part of the Takeover program on e-flux. Thank you to Julian Ross for his work on that. Tri was seen because of Fedor Tot’s emphatic recommendation. Thank you to him and Ehsan Khoshbakht for screening it at Close-Up this summer. Green Snake was watched with fellow CYZ editors past and present with Paul Farrell. Thank you to Paul, the ultimate Tsui Hark fan, for finally getting us to watch Maggie Cheung defeat an incel by making him spunk his pants. Schmoedipus and Outlaw Poverty, Not Prosititution were seen because of my own personal curiosity.

One new film per spot on the list, but each is twinned with a discovery that felt just as invigorating. This is a picture of my year, less complete than full. Godard gets a spot; so does Pyun. I plan to spend at least a bit of the holidays catching up on the Holy Spirit of that 2022 Memoriam Trinity, Jean-Marie Straub. I cheated even by my own rules – there’s several triple-bills on here, which puts me 4 spots over on my discoveries list – but let that not seem like the work of a glutton struggling to fit the best of the best in. Perhaps the one great lesson I learned in 2022 was the treasure of time. After leaving Cinema Year Zero as an editor, for the simple reason that I did not have the time to spare for a project that deserved it, I have attempted to give back to the universe in some sense.\n\nThese are 24 films to which I wholeheartedly gave my attention, and want none of it back. I’m paring down, curating more, deciding what really interests me, where I want to keep digging. How fitting that the only director to appear twice, in both the new and old categories, is that great shaman of time and attention, James Benning.\n\nNadira Begum\n\n2022\n\n1. One Fine Morning\n\n2.

It’s his funniest and most relaxed movie, but in it he finds a dramatic redemption, an acceptance of the changing of the body (which has resonated with just about every trans person I know). In doing this, the ardently atheistic filmmaker can only look to the transcendent, ending on a visual quote from The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928)\n\nIn Front of your Face / The Novelist’s Film (Hong Sang-soo)\n\nA diptych about finding beauty in the face of death. In Front of Your Face shows how it can only be found in impermanence, because that’s what all things in life are; any hint of eternity is only a delusion. After it’s been found, The Novelist’s Film is about creating a life that can sustain it, spending time only with people you care about and doing things you find inspiring. Hoping to keep a hold of it, of beauty, for as long as you can. As long as you have left.\n\nCordillera of Dreams (Patricio Guzmán)\n\nThe final film in Patricio Guzmán’s trilogy connecting the geography and political history of Chile wanders into the abstraction of poetry without ever allowing it to get in the way of precise analysis. When Guzmán asks what the Cordillera would say after all the horrors it’s watched over, it answers: on a path made from the mountains’ stone we see the carved names of the people murdered on it. Rather than mythologising history, which the film is explicitly fighting against, poetry shows it more clearly; it gives life to what might become cold and abstract facts.\n\nSection 1 (Jon Bois)\n\nJon Bois continues with the theme of randomness in his most suspenseful film where the best outcome of this American Football game is a totally boring loss, so that everyone will leave the stadium before a plane crashes into it. Bois shows us how all the chaos of the world can align perfectly, it’s all the more moving because it happened for no good reason; it was a secular miracle.\n\nWe’re All Going to the World’s Fair (Jane Schoenbrun)\n\nThe Internet might seem like a free space to express yourself in whatever way you want, but its quiet structures inform that expression; the medium gives the message shape. Jane Schoenbrun’s debut feature quite bracingly shows how artificial and silly the results of this can be, but never doubts that the feelings underneath are genuine and true. The ambiguity of the internet might seem an apt conduit for teenage (or transgender) feelings not yet understood, but it only serves to obscure them more, in a kind of self-absorption that only alienates people from themselves.\n\nNo Bears (Jafar Panahi)\n\nA film made on the edges, literally on the border of a country that’s about to collapse in on itself, it’s Jafar Panahi’s darkest movie. Instead of finding complexity within a simple premise, No Bears is dense, complicated and sometimes hard to follow; it feels like a lot of detail is lost watching it as a foreigner. If its focus seems scattershot, it comes together in an incredibly powerful final act with echoes of Sansho the Bailiff (1954), feeling similarly huge and bleak, uncomfortably foreshadowing what was about to come in Panahi’s country and personal life.\n\nBenediction (Terence Davies)\n\nQuite similar to Terence Davies’ previous film, A Quiet Passion (2018), but is richer because the two parts—one of hyper-articulate wit and one facing the bleakness of death—aren’t neatly segmented. It slips back and forth through memory, managing to have morbid and sexy scenes work right next to each other, even if the joy in Siegfried Sassoon’s life, and by proxy Davies’, slowly fades to basically nothing.\n\nThree Thousand Years of Longing (George Miller)\n\nThe biggest surprise of the year, George Miller’s passion project and inevitable box office failure looked lame and cornball. And maybe it is, but its core feels so true that it imbues the rest with its light, that the obsession with stories and art, whether you’re an artist, an academic or an audience member, speak to a deep loneliness and melancholy. A desire to escape into another world—into a fanatical world with Djinn or into your own head with something intellectually engaging—or maybe it’s just to get away from your life for a little while, it doesn’t really matter where to.\n\nThe Tsugua Diaries (Maureen Fazendeiro & Miguel Gomes)\n\nMaureen Fazendeiro and Miguel Gomes’ first film together is a celebration of collaboration and all the little highs and lows of living together. From squabbles about who drank whose milk to the building of a butterfly house, or rather, the opposite, as the days are shown in reverse order. Much like with Hong Sang-soo, the narrative then comes from the structure rather than the action, from the gaps in context slowly filled in. The way this allows the film to loop around on itself is quite beautiful: as it shows the film within the film and the butterfly house being unmade, it shows itself being made; it invites us into that creation.\n\nSaint Omer (Alice Diop)\n\nMovies that like to think of themselves as emphatic often only look for it in places comfortable and familiar, flattening everyone together as having a lot more in common than we think. But in Saint Omer, Alice Diop looks at people who have done things beyond comprehension and doesn’t try to judge nor explain them. Any explanation can only seem half-formed because all people can only be partly understood. To make a finer point of that, to imagine someone as totally alien from you, is therefore a choice, something the film directly challenges. If it’s striking to meet the eyes of the woman in the trial at the film’s centre it’s not because you’re looking into a void, but because you aren’t.\n\nDiscoveries\n\nElection Campaign 1932 (1933, Ella Bergmann-Michel)\n\nThe Harvey Girls (1946, George Sidney)\n\nThe Big Snooze (1946, Robert Clampett)\n\nAag (1948, Raj Kapoor)\n\nMonkey Business (1952, Howard Hawks)\n\nAlphaville (1965, Jean-Luc Godard)\n\nTrafic (1971, Jacques Tati)\n\nGreen Snake (1993, Tsui Hark)\n\nYokohama Kaidashi Kikou (1998, Takashi Annō)\n\nThe Gleaners & I (2000, Agnes Varda)\n\nEllisha Izumi\n\n2022\n\nResolving ‘Your Biggest Fan’ (Stef Aranas)\n\nDo Revenge (Jennifer Kaytin Robinson)\n\nDecision to Leave (Park Chan-wook)\n\nBergman Island (Mia Hansen-Løve)\n\nTÁR (Todd Field)\n\nAfter Yang (Kogonada)\n\nDeep Water (Adrian Lyne)\n\nGood Luck to You, Leo Grande (Sophie Hyde)\n\nNot Okay (Quinn Shephard)\n\nFunny Pages (Owen Kline)\n\nSadly, there are no clear favourite features for me in 2022 so I decided to give the number 1\n\nspot to a short that I love that got me excited about the future of filmmaking: Resolving\n\n‘Your Biggest Fan’ a brilliant meta-doc by a trans filmmaker trying to finish her graduate film\n\nduring a COVID lockdown. Similarly, Funny Pages snuck in at number 10 despite its third act\n\nproblems as its visceral comedy promises an exciting future from writer/director Owen\n\nKline.\n\nSeveral films on this list also impressed me with deft scripts that I kept returning to long\n\nafter watching: the exploration of diaspora through sci-fi metaphor in After Yang, of\n\nsexuality in Good Luck to You, Leo Grande, and a thorough examination of privilege in the\n\nunderrated Not Okay.\n\nHonourable mentions go to Sharp Stick (Lena Dunham), Bones and All (Luca Guadagnino),\n\nand Austin Butler for a great performance in a mixed bag film (Elvis), which had dazzling\n\nhighs in sea of lows. Filmmakers I’m eager to see more from include Jane Schoenbrun\n\n(We’re All Going to the World’s Fair) and Monia Chokri (Babysitter).\n\nbest discoveries of 2022\n\n1.

Legitimately breathtaking and visceral\n\naction sequences; the jingoistic relationship to the military; and the prevailing, but tenuous\n\ngrasp of the status quo on the rest of world. Not a nostalgic sequel to a decades-old\n\noriginal film, but a moving, sobering comment on what’s become of cinema – and one of its\n\nmost famous, full-throated exponents – since the 80s.\n\n9 – Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\n\nAnother sequel, but this one much more contemporary. And capital-c Contemporary might\n\nbe the best way to describe Glass Onion, a film that wears its layers – and its own love with\n\nand fascination for them – on its impeccably tailored sleeve. The man-child billionaire who\n\ninvites old friends to his private island is exactly the type of person who would buy Twitter\n\nand run it into the ground. But the terminally online politics of this film – something it shares\n\nwith its predecessor, even if they’re less blunt here – aren’t the appeal: its the joy of a great\n\ncast peeling back the layers of a classic mystery. A puzzle box to relish in solving.\n\n8 – All the Beauty and the Bloodshed\n\nNan Goldin tells the story of her life and work with the help of Laura Poitras. Goldin refuses\n\nto look away, which means that the film makes us look on, unblinking, with her. A\n\ntestament on the power of art and activism; the need for political engagement and\n\nchallenging institutions; and the small tragedies and triumphs that build up to a life worth\n\nliving, fighting for, and saving.\n\n7 – Crimes of the Future\n\nDavid Cronenberg at his most explicitly romantic. Not a body-horror, or even a horror at all,\n\nbut instead a delightfully perverse love story about what our bodies – and the stories we tell\n\nwith them, the art that they help us to make – might be heading next. While it might be a\n\nsimplification to add that David Cronenberg said trans rights, he dd, and that still feels like\n\nit matters.\n\n6 – The Banshees of Inisherin\n\nNo man is an island in this tragicomedy, no matter how much one of them might want to\n\nbe. What begins as a platonic breakup becomes a kind of philosophical showdown on\n\nwhat makes life worthwhile. Career best work from both leading men, and a final sequence\n\nthat’s unshakeable. These banshees might not be screaming, but their words will burrow\n\ninto you all the same.\n\n5 – Aftersun\n\nThe film I’ve spent the most time thinking about since I initially saw it this year, and every\n\ntime I sit with it, I come away thinking that it was even better. Magical and wondrous in a\n\nway that only cinema can be; it cuts deep in a way that doesn’t even become clear until\n\nlong after the end, when all those old wounds open up again.\n\n4 – White Noise\n\nThe scariest film of the year, wringing out every possible drop of horror from a laundry list\n\nof contemporary anxieties that range from the mundane to the existential, what’s most\n\nsurprising about White Noise is just how effortlessly it fits into Baumbach’s filmography. At\n\nits heart – and it has a big one – is a marriage; two people who are almost desperately in\n\nlove with each other, and all of the power, fear, and joy that comes with it.\n\n3 – Nope\n\nCinema of the spectacle as a funhouse mirror; daring you to look away. Possibly Peele’s\n\nbest work yet; full of mystery and nuance. Steven Yeun gives one of the most underrated,\n\nheartbreaking performances of the year and does more in a single scene – talking about an\n\nSNL sketch in a kitschy room of career merchandise – than most actors do with entire\n\nmovies.\n\n2 – Decision to Leave\n\nTotal cinema: all aspects of the medium working at full force to create something that’s\n\ndazzling in a way that feels almost impossible. Breathtaking in its visual storytelling, and\n\nobsessive in its details as a way to fit the shapeshifting story at the centre of it.\n\n1 – You Won’t Be Alone\n\nThe mute, body-swapping witch at the centre of You Won’t Be Along is constantly asking\n\nthemself about what kind of place the world is: if its frightening, rotten, broken, beautiful. It\n\nbecomes all of these things and more in the most singular cinematic achievement of the\n\nyear. There’s nothing else like it.\n\nDiscoveries\n\nAll Male Mashup / V.O.\n\nImmediately cheating by putting two films in my ten slot – a pair of archival excavations by\n\nartist and writer William E. Jones that explore the narrative beats of adult cinema. From\n\npulsing, fragmented cruising narratives; to the contrast between erotic image and\n\nintellectual dialogue, Jones understands what gets cinema hot under the collar.\n\nCure\n\nBleak, relentless, and hypnotic. Makes other philosophically driven crime thrillers look\n\npedestrian and dreary, through both its construction of an increasingly barren Tokyo, to the\n\nease with which it pries open doors to the darkest, most morbidly inviting corridors. Gets\n\nunder the skin and doesn’t leave.\n\nDemons\n\nAn experimental horror of light and darkness, both visually and thematically. From its first\n\nmoments the images are arresting, and the stop-start structure is a dark, absurdist delight.\n\nDoesn’t so much hurtle towards the inevitability of tragedy as walk towards it in a daze,\n\nalways looking for something to illuminate an unforgiving world until the last moment.\n\nDiabolique\n\nThe best “shouting at the screen in surprise” movie that I saw this year – never goes where\n\nyou expect, and never stops moving. There are a few puzzle boxes and mysteries across\n\nthese lists, and this is the one that’s most likely to grab you and not let go.\n\nE.T.\n\nThe last time I did a CYZ discovery list, I had Interstellar on it, and this feels like it occupies\n\nthat same space: something that’s surprising for me not to have seen. Spielberg is the\n\ngreat cinematic humanist; offering the audience the ability to see the world anew every\n\ntime.\n\nHara-Kiri\n\nDeconstructing the samurai – as a historical figure and cinematic one – and daring to call\n\nevery tradition that came before it hollow and meaningless. There are moments of brutal\n\nviolence, and visual serenity here. They’re not running against each other, but existing in a\n\nstrange harmony.\n\nThe Living Dead Girl\n\nThere are two tragedies in life: the first is not getting what you want. The second is getting\n\nit. Jean Rollin knocks on the door of cinematic perfection with a story of love lost that\n\nbecomes something monstrous when it’s found once again.\n\nThe Public Enemy\n\nQueerness finds a lonely, violent avatar in James Cagney’s Tom Powers, a man who is\n\nconstantly raging against the world around him, even as he tries to ascend the ladder of it\n\nwith blood on his hands. For all of the heavy-handed moralising that bookends the film,\n\nand the societal problem of a “public enemy,” Wellamn’s film offers something much more\n\nthan a morality play: a character study of a man whose ghost still walks among us.\n\nSymptoms\n\nAll of the queer films on this list are weird and violent. The most obviously unbalanced\n\nwoman in the history of gothic cinema invites a “friend” to her secluded manor. But the\n\nRollin-esque set-up is anything but: Symptoms is slow to reveal its hand, and creates\n\nsomething legitimately unsettling in the emptiness of this grand house, and the women that\n\nwander around it.\n\nTo Be Or Not To Be\n\nIt’s tempting to talk about the politics of the film: the limits of art-as-activism. But in the end,\n\nwhen I think about To Be Or Not To Be, I think about the fact that it has one of the best\n\npunchlines in a film that I’ve ever heard.\n\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre\n\n“I know what gold does to men’s souls.” A tale of distrust and disintegration; of desperate,\n\ncowardly men reaching out for the the thing they want the most, at any cost. Bogart is\n\nfascinating for his cowardice more than anything else; a fool looking for fool’s gold which,\n\nin the end, is all gold.\n\nS Paul\n\n(Editor’s Note: Paul declined to continue, citing Gorfinkel’s Against Lists and a desire to abolish the Gregorian calendar)\n\nPaddy Mulholland\n\n2022\n\nBenediction (Terence Davies)\n\nBlonde (Andrew Dominik)\n\nCrimes of the Future (David Cronenberg)\n\nEO (Jerzy Skolimowski)\n\nMad God (Phil Tippett)\n\nNelly & Nadine (Magnus Gertten)\n\nPacifiction (Albert Serra)\n\nRimini (Ulrich Seidl)\n\nRobe of Gems (Natalia Lopez)\n\nWhat Do We See When We Look at the Sky?

Coming up with a short list of great experimental shorts is never a problem. Darkness, Darkness… was a very special treat which I am well aware most people have not yet had a chance to see. I include it in the hopes that it will generate some interest. Ideally even push some to book the film for screenings. With only one existing print that must be projected by the filmmaker herself, it’s not a simple prospect. But in time I don’t doubt it will get out there a bit more.\n\nThe Dream and the Radio is the kind of ‘first film’ that makes all the festival digging feel worthwhile —finally, further proof of young people out there somewhere in the world who really want to try to do things differently, unafraid of failure, willing to challenge viewers, to challenge themselves, to challenge the general state of festival filmmaking and still make it through the cracks. It is rare, and Renaud Després-Larose & Ana Tapia Rousiouk are absolutely a duo to keep an eye on.\n\nWith Vortex, Noé surprised me again. After Climax (2018) (which I appreciated but did not enjoy), I was taken aback by the compassion for his characters here. It’s not exactly pioneering on a formal level, but it is fascinating. Noé’s formal schtick often threatens to fall into ‘why bother who cares’ territory, but here it works far better than expected (as was the case in Enter the Void (2009)). If nothing else one must admire his unceasing dedication to the bit. Of course he couldn’t help himself with that last shot, and the dialogue and plot more than once slips into overly silly territory, yet overall its a level-headed entry that truly tickled the fear-of-death nerve like no other.\n\nHole in the Head is another promising new work by a lesser-known filmmaker. As per his website, Dean Kavanagh has made 70 short films and 6 features. The theatrical unrolling of his new picture in his native Ireland is a touching success story. The film itself—complete with a handy blog about its making—concerns the mining of a mysterious personal history via various moving image formats. There are tedious moments, but the whole of the film is a satisfying and exploratory bizarro aesthetic adventure which thrills beyond the surface obsessions of, say, a Peter Strickland picture.\n\nCrimes of the Future sees Cronenberg senior up to his usual. What is new here is the way it blends the best of his late style narratives (A History of Violence, Eastern Promises) into his fascination with gore. A logical endpoint. The body reigns supreme in his filmography and here it is once again the locus of control and reckless abandon. Not a return to but a furthering of form.\n\nSimilarly, The United States of America sees Benning continuing to hold static shots for extended periods with little to no action. It is a strategy which has allowed him to continue releasing work at a steady clip. Apparently he has already made two new features since this one premiered in February. Here we stare at nature. We stare at the ruins of the American dream. We hear ghosts of the past through recorded speeches and echoes of distant music. We meditate on the injustices the nation was built upon (as is always his wont).\n\nTár was a pleasant surprise. Nobody’s Hero was a clever absurdist satire. I don’t have much else to say about either except to recommend them.\n\n5 new shorts:\n\nAshes by Name is Man (Rosinska)\n\nTigre del Carbon (aZuLosa)\n\nLungta (Cuesta)\n\nNotes on Connection III (Franco)\n\nAll The Best (Proctor)\n\nTigre del Carbon and Notes on Connection III were two of the many excellent films in the ‘Persistent Visions’ program of MoMI’s First Look festival in March.\n\nLungta is the newest work by Alexandra Cuesta, whose Notes, Imprints (On Love): Part I (2020) left an impression for its subtle and sensitive imagery. Lungta however, is composed of ghostly images, nothing concrete, everything based around the fact of its inability to be perceived concretely.\n\nAshes by Name is Man is the latest work by Ewelina Rosinska, which will play IFFR in January, and which displays a technical proficiency which has furthered since her last (already quite good) film, Erde im Mund (2020). While both films were shot illustriously on 16mm and edited digitally, her next is slated to be an all-analog endeavor. If Ashes… is anything to go by, her next will be a masterwork of montage.\n\nAll the Best is the first film (a single roll) shot on my Bolex, which was surprise-gifted to me by six of my closest friends in October, and it is incredible the degree to which having my own personal camera has altered my working methodology.\n\n17 discoveries:\n\nEniaios (I-III and XII-XIV) (1947-1991, Markopoulos)\n\nBouquets 11-20 (2009, Lowder)\n\n17 Reasons Why (1987, Dorsky)\n\nStare (1991, Kels)\n\nWomen I Love (1979, Hammer)\n\nMeditations on Revolution Part V: Foreign City (2003, Fenz)\n\nWorking Class (1976, Wong)\n\nFog Line (1970, Gottheim)\n\nUntitled 77-A (1977, Han)\n\nLa Region Centrale (1971, Snow)\n\nHand Held Day (1975, Beydler)\n\nHeat Shimmer (1978, the Cantrills)\n\nFishs Eddy (1978, Shatavsky)\n\nWhat the Water Said (Nos. 1-6) (1998 & 2007, Gatten)\n\nThe Leaden Echo and the Golden Echo (1955, Tait)\n\nBelly (1998, Williams)\n\nSotiros (2000, Beavers)\n\nEach of these viewings taught me to see again, which is the reason I continue to watch films.\n\nFedor Tot\n\n2022\n\nNo Bears (Jafar Panahi)\n\nPetrov’s Flu (Kiril Serebrenikov)\n\nYou Won’t Be Alone (Goran Stolevski)\n\nVortex (Gaspar Noe)\n\nThis Much I Know To Be True (Andrew Dominik)\n\nJackass Forever (Jeff Tremaine)\n\nSaint Omer (Alice Diop)\n\nAll the Beauty and the Bloodshed (Laura Poitras)\n\nMurina (Antoneta Alamat Kusijanović)\n\nDark Glasses (Dario Argento)\n\nDiscoveries\n\nThe Long Goodbye (Robert Altman, USA, 1973)\n\nAll that Money Can Buy (William Dieterle, USA, 1941)\n\nHard to Be a God (Aleksei German, Russia, 2013)\n\nThe Swordsman of All Swordsmen (Joseph Kuo, Taiwan, 1969)\n\nExecution in Autumn (Lee Hsing, Taiwan, 1972)\n\nGanja and Hess (Bill Gunn, USA 1973)\n\nCoach to Vienna (Karel Kachyňa, Czechoslovakia, 1966)\n\nThe Enemy (Živojin Pavlović, Yugoslavia, 1965)\n\nBoxer from Shantung( Chang Cheh/Pao Hsueh-Li, Hong Kong, 1972)\n\nThe Lady from Constantinople (Judit Elek, Hungary, 1969)\n\nBest Discoveries of Il Cinema Ritrovato\n\nCanoa: A Shameful Memory (Felipe Cazals, Mexico, 1976)\n\nA Fire (Ebrahim Golestan, Iran, 1961)\n\nZaseda/The Ambush (Živojin Pavlović, Yugoslavia, 1969)\n\nThe Raid (Huge Fregonese, USA, 1954)\n\nCheshmeh (Arby Ovanessian, Iran, 1972)\n\nThe Ninth Circle (France Štiglic, Yugoslavia, 1960)\n\nBlack Tuesday (Huge Fregonese, USA, 1954)\n\nThe Long Farewell (Kira Muratova, USSR, 1971)\n\nTony Arzenta/No Way Out (Duccio Tessari, Italy, 1973)\n\nDon’t Look Back, My Son (Branko Bauer, Yugoslavia, 1956)\n\nAlistair Ryder\n\n2022\n\nAftersun\n\nThe Eternal Daughter\n\nAll The Beauty And The Bloodshed\n\nRRR\n\nThe Banshees of Inisherin\n\nTurning Red\n\nBones and All\n\nFunny Pages\n\nNope\n\nMrs Harris Goes to Paris\n\nDiscoveries\n\nJulia (Erick Zonca, 2008)\n\nMalcolm X (Spike Lee, 1992)\n\nTerms of Endearment (James L.
