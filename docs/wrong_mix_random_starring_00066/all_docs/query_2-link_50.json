        "meta_description": "2 reviews and 3 photos of NOVI TOWN CENTER 8 - CLOSED \"For those who are looking to branch out of the typical summer blockbuster fare and experience something different, head to the Novi Town Center 8 and see a Bollywood film! Bollywood films are over-the-top, genre hopping, colorful slices of eye candy that make most Hollywood movies seem like art films. Be prepared for some serious cheese and several choreographed musical breakout numbers. I absolutely love Bollywood, and not just for the \"ironic factor\" that seems to attract some folks to check them out. Far from mocking Bollywood movies, I find them to be the ultimate in cinematic escapism, as long as you're willing to suspend your disbelief and just go with it. The Novi Town Center 8 is one of the only theaters in the area that play Bollywood films, and it is always showing at least two Hindi or Tamil language features. To complete the authenticity of the experience, you can even get samosas at the concession stand. Your best bet is \"Bollywood Bargain Wednesdays\" where all Bollywood films are only $5. Seeing that most of these movies are 2.5 hours long or even longer, it's really a fantastic way to beat the summer heat and experience something new at the same time. My one caution: virtually all Bollywood movies manage to encompass every genre imaginable within the confines of the film. There is always over-the-top comic relief, even in a film that's billed as a thriller or a romance. While fine in small doses, I would not recommend going to any films that look like \"comedy\" is the main genre. The humor is loud and usually sophomoric and doesn't translate all that well, so a whole film of it will exhaust you. I would hate for such a film to be your first Bollywood experience and turn you off entirely!\"",
