So much so that we were totally conflicted whilst putting this issue together - on what to keep, and what to trim out. Close on the heels of the pure cinematic indulgence of the Abu Dhabi Film festival is the art and music smorgasbord that is​​Abu Dhabi​Art​, the Yasalam music scene and the world-class musicals. Then there are all the delightful bursts of creativity around the country’s museums and educational institutions. Within our pages you’ll find cool stories on everything from music to photography; design to film production; all the way to social causes and lifestyle must dos. As this goes to press, the Tempo team prepares to help host a November 6 social mixer for international and locally based designers. The event, which will be at MoxieZone in twofour54 Rotana Complex, is part​of​the exciting 20th International Symposium on Electronic Art brought to the UAE by Zayed University. We’re hoping it will be an evening where artists share their passion for design and revel in the magic of art and creativity.

I am in a bit of a dilemma. My high school teacher recently sent me a friend request on Facebook. This is the same teacher that once flunked me. Should I ignore her or try to develop a more mature (and cathartic) relationship with her and accept her request? Should I try to connect with her even if I don’t like her? Not if you don’t like her- it’s your choice. No one is obliged to accept anybody on FB. I blocked half of my work colleagues just cause I didn’t want them nosing into my private life outside office. – Susanna Teachers assign failing grades to students who don’t do their work. Unless the teacher came out of nowhere with some sort of assessment that no one in the class had seen before, the responsibility for the ‘flunking’ rests on the students. If you want to be friends with your former teacher, great. If you still feel bad about your own behavior or the teacher’s behavior, it could be resolved by a FB connection. – Michele Depends on your relationship with the teacher. It can either be awkward and creepy, or it can be a new friendship based on respect and understanding. -Deena This happened to me…but it didn’t work. For some reason I saw him still as my teacher, and I felt a need to always ‘behave’ and ‘censor’ my comments. After a while I quietly ‘unfriended’ him. I hope he hasn’t noticed. -Arcat POST YOUR QUESTIONS IN OUR FB GROUP: TEMPO UAE The month before National Day, let the practices begin! (33%) Tech season! New gadgets out just in time for the holidays! (27%) It’s Diwali! Where are my rockets? (22%) Guns ‘n’ Roses, November Rain! That Slash solo was out of this world! (18%) Librarians are critical to the development of the knowledge based economy; librarians are essential players. As big data abounds and pervasive information overload persists; an information specialist is necessary to empower individuals with the tools and special skills required to navigate through vast data to meet their specific needs. Ultimately, they help to develop, create and innovate ideas into viable solutions. UNESCO’s development target emphasizes the importance of ensuring people have the skills and abilities needed for critical reception, assessment and use of information and media in their professional and personal lives. According to UNESCO, “empowerment of people through information and media literacy is an important prerequisite for fostering equitable access to information and knowledge, and building inclusive knowledge societies.” Most people assume librarians don’t have to do much all day except read books. Not so - our duties represent a multitude of activities, which include development, information and instructional technology, teaching, research support, data analysis, planning and much, much more. Most people assume librarians don’t require any qualifications. Not so - the terminal degree for the profession is a Master of Library and Information Science. PhD opportunities are also available in this discipline. Most librarians have a wide range of undergraduate degrees in many different disciplines. Therefore these individuals with a rich and diverse educational background and discipline bring their expertise to the field. The American University of the Emirates in Dubai offers one of the only Master of Library and Information Science Degree for those interested in pursuing further studies in Library and Information Science in the UAE. The University College of London has recently opened a branch in Doha exclusively offering Master Degrees in Museum Studies, Cultural Heritage, Conservation and Archaeology. Most people assume librarians are all in the same field however there are many different areas of specialization including school librarianship, academic/university librarianship, museums, law, government, special or corporate librarianship as well as public librarianship. Even more specialized fields include archivists, information literacy specialists, geographic information systems specialists, instructional technologists and more. You can learn more about librarianship at the upcoming Sharjah International Book Fair. The American Library Association has teamed up with the organizers of the festival to present a three-day Librarian’s Professional Development series. The event will take place during the Sharjah International Book Fair, November 11th – 13th. Meet and greet the president of the American Library Association, which is one of the oldest and largest library associations in the world. Over 40 international speakers will share their expertise and insight on trends in the profession; you would be able to experience a wide variety of programmes as well as network with regional library professionals.\n\n7. www. tempoplanet.com 7 Aviation History Month National Novel Writing Month Historic Bridge Awareness Banana Pudding Lovers Month SOCIAL MEDIA: November is the month of Aviation History, Novel Writing, and Historical Bridges and finally…..Banana Pudding!QUIRKY FINDS! From 1903, when the Wright Brothers finally got the first airplane in history off the ground (pictured), to 2014, beautiful Boeing 787 Dreamliners with luxurious interiors. Aren’t inventions awesome?! We’ve come a looooooong way!! Could you write a “novel” on what you know about women? This unique novel comes with over a hundred blank pages…take that as a statement of what men really know about women or write your own pages! What would you say? Bridging the gap between past and present. Which is scarier? Historic Bridge Awareness month brings to mind the Hussaini rope bridge in Pakistan. Not exactly the safest bridge in the world and only the most courageous dare to cross it. The Millau Viaduct, which is the world’s tallest bridge is located in southern France and is close to 2,500 meters in length. Which would you cross? And finally, for Banana Pudding Lovers Month, satisfy that sweet tooth with some banana pudding, an American Southern favourite! This delicious sweet treat comes packed with bananas, vanilla wafers (biscuits), cream and other tasty ingredients. Magnolia Bakery in Galleria Mall does it the best!

It’s no doubt that social media, and technology in general, have had the greatest impact on our times. We are so dependent on social media and technology that we forget little of this existed just 10 years ago. Imagine if all of it were to stop right now… Imagine the trouble we’ll have finishing the simplest of tasks. We rely on social media in our everyday activities - in fact I’m sure as you read this, you’re going to pull out your phone a couple times. That’s the problem - or at least that’s the question… This question of the impact of social media in our lives has been up for discussion for the past few years. With technology enhancing each day, and social network sites becoming a common source of information for people all over the world, you can’t help but ask the question: have social media and technology brought people closer or driven them further apart? Right off the bat, we can all agree that social media and technology have made it easier for people to connect with family, friends, workers, and even with people from other parts of the globe. They’re able to share pictures, videos, links and other pieces of information. We have to agree that technology has brought people closer. Take for example my family who lives in Toronto, Canada who my grandparents haven’t met, but Skype changed that completely. It’s not the full experience, but it’s a big deal when you think about it. Now we know everything good has its fair share of bad too, and you’re probably wondering how social media has drifted people apart when it’s done so much to bring them closer in a virtual world. Through this virtual world people are always connected, but its never like the real thing. You see, technology has also changed the way we interact - when we meet! I go to gatherings of family or friends, and there’s less quality socializing because everyone’s busy communicating on their phones. That means that social networks have, in many ways, made us anti-social! Think about the miscommunication that happens in the virtual world. I’m sure everyone knows at least one person who no longer speaks to another person because of an argument that might have taken place through a social network site like Facebook, Twitter, etc. It makes you wonder if this would still happen if social media was limited in scope, or didn’t exist at all. We know that social media technology won’t be leaving us anytime soon and that it is integral to our lives. But moving forward, we need to figure out not only how to utilize it to best effect, but also how to mitigate the problems that it can cause.

Twitter-ing, Facebook-ing, Google+-ing, LinkedIn-ing, Stumbleupon-ing, any-other-bluudy-netwurking-yeez-can-find- ing, …and prob’ly most vital of all of these, Blogging… in all of that chattering, communicating, networking, yer ‘Author’s Brand’ develops… yer SOSYAL NETWURK presence is key to yer ‘Author’s Brand’ recognition on the Web… (yer unique distinctive personality, or whatever version yeez choose to display of it as such)… so, as a quill-scraper, are yeez an Author?… are yeez a Voice?… are yeez a Brand?… yes!… yes!… and yes!… yeez are the composite of all of that to the outside readers and writers’ universe… the fantasy sci-fi is possible… beam me up Scottie!… see yeez later… LUV YEEZ!… David Moore is an Australian Digital Poet/ Filmmaker/ ponderer and is the senior lecturer in video production at Abu Dhabi Women’s College. I recently read that we ALL live 80 milliseconds in the PAST… that by the time we recognize the NOW, it has already become living memory. This actually explained a lot to me, how we sometimes feel disconnected from reality, when we open our mouths and utter something, instantly regretting or rejoicing in our ignorance or joyousness or both. This concept, the ephemeral, intangible quality of time continued to lodge in my mind, not unlike the transporting moment from the movie American Beauty, in which Ricky Fitt’s video’s a swirling plastic shopping bag, whilst underscored by the beautiful dialogue “… it helps me remember... I need to remember... Sometimes there’s so much beauty in the world, I feel like I can’t take it, and my heart is just going to cave in.” It was also about this time my first-born left home, something all parents go through, but nothing prepares you for… the impact of which is rarely discussed. I grieved for almost a year… starting six months before he even left. I would no longer wake to see him everyday, hear his voice, argue with him, my son was now relegated to misbegotten Skype calls with lamenting parents, to being a visitor in his own home when visiting to Australia. A quote from a movie at the Doha Tribeca Film Festival several years ago kept echoing through my mind. A young Chinese woman grieves to a friend that she had done the sums, and from the time your children leave home to their subsequent visits, if you add it all up… you’re lucky if they spend a collective year with their parents in the next 30 years. Sadly this rings true for all of us, and what do we have left, but our memories… For my son’s impending 21st birthday, an event which distance and schedule prevented spending together, I devised something that I hoped would be special. 88 Milliseconds was a book that I wrote to celebrate our expat lives together in Abu Dhabi and the specialness of my son. In writing and editing nearly a thousand pictures… I came up with 100 pages of photographs and short stories to celebrate life, art, culture, travel and our time together. I presented it to my son who, with the demure attitude of 21-year-old, thanked me, thumbed through a few pages and put it away. That’s ok… because I didn’t write it for now, I wrote it for later, because one day I know he will find it, read it… and treasure it, because, whether we like to admit it or not, we all become nostalgic. I only printed two copies (one for him, one for me), with the wonder of the digital age printing technology. It was surprisingly cheap and of excellent quality (my other hat is running a graphic design company for 10 years). What did surprise me was the reaction to the people I showed my copy to… I started to receive encouragement to reprint for it other people, possibly even to sell, but this book was special, I wanted to keep 88 milliseconds for him… for us (if you’re wondering why 88 and not the current title, it was 80 milliseconds for the past, and 2 milliseconds extra for each member of our immediate family. 88 seemed like a nice round number, not unlike me). I started to treat the project as a new book, took out some of the more personal stories that were just for him and replaced them with stories of equal joyousness and humour, but also involving friends as well as family. With the help of Susan-Sojourna (Sojo) Collier, a highly experienced writer in Applied Communications at Higher Colleges of Technology’s Abu Dhabi Women’s College, Sojo began to curate the pictures and stories to generate an exhibition to support the book launch. 80 milliseconds is the past... it is the time it takes you to blink, the time to touch your toes (for some of us anyway) the time it takes for your children to leave home.... it is a celebration of time, art, family, travel and the (not to distant) past. Copies of the book may be purchased online at Blurb.com or the direct link http://blur. by/1CV0pWX for $34.63 plus delivery.

It has developed its own protocols and aesthetics over time, enhanced by choice of location and accessories.

THE CHALLENGE: PATTERNSPhotographer: ViktoriaVinnikava\n\n16. www. tempoplanet.com16 the epicureanBy Lana Nasser Instagram: @l4n4n I’m buzzing from an intense post workout high. I still have the shakes and nothing can quite quench my thirst as a fruit and veggie liquid heaven. One of my favourites would have to be the Morning Glory from Nectar at Bodytree Studio – blueberries, bananas, orange, organic acai powder and organic goji berries. The best part for me is pushing my body to reach crazy mental goals, sweating out all the toxins and then rewarding it with a freshly made juice full of nutrients and antioxidants, kick-starting its repair cycle into hyper-drive. That’s my reason for loving juice, what’s yours? Juice bars have become a trend, a style cooler than fashion; a status symbol. Nowadays it’s hipper to look after your body from the inside out. So how did this obsession come about? Juice has been sloshing around waiting for it’s grand entrance since the thirties. It paired perfectly with the crusades for fitness, the popularization of Gerson therapy, which was a treatment of juice, supplements and coffee enemas for cancer patients and the work of Norman Walker, a pioneer in the raw food movement and vegetarianism. As a young man he couldn’t accept the idea of ill health or a sick body and was able to cure himself by grinding carrots for juice. He believed in juicing your way to vibrant health and disease prevention: parsley for maintaining adrenal and thyroid glands, turnip for soft bones and teeth and green peppers for quality nails and hair. Today his famed Norwalk cold press juice machine is touted as an innovation as it delivers smoother, less pulpy nectars that allow the body to better absorb the benefits of juice. Unfortunately his concept had a very small cult following and the ideas never caught on; Walker passed away in 1985 at age 99 but some say at 118. Juice picked up again in the nineties when it was closely tied to the super-foods and veganism. If you wanted a disconnection THE JUICE ON JUICE from mass-produced sustenance then juice was your answer. Juice was natural and allowed you a kind of float-on-a-cloud feeling through life, a little nutsy and hungry but full of energy, epiphanies and goodness. At that time there was another health culture taking hold, better known as the pamper-yourself culture with expensive hot stone massages. So when the pampering world collided with the all the natural high of the hippie juice world, the juice craze was born with lots of excitement to go with it. Companies like iZo Cleanse in California and Blue Print in New York by Zoe Sakoutis and Erica Huss pioneered juice’s revolution. Each tackles juice through a different process but the general message is the same: to promote health and strength and now is your chance to ride the bandwagon to rebirth. This vibe has burst on the scene in Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the last two years; especially as health and fitness awareness campaigns and events gain momentum and popularity. The hardest decision would have to be choosing which of the juice bars is the one for you. According to Mira Naaman, owner of Nectar, “you choose the juice that best suits your lifestyle!” There are the juice bars in Abu Dhabi that offer freshly blended elixirs, which you can also custom design with the energy boosting extras such as organic wheatgrass, organic aloe vera, organic flaxseeds or organic chia seeds or even preorder your juice so it’s ready right after your workout. While others offer pre-bottled cold pressed juices, which are smoother because of the pressing process the fruits and vegetables go through. You can’t create your own, but the juices have an increased shelf life and allow you to experience the benefits as close to eating the actual fruit. Then you have the stores in Dubai that specialize in various detoxifying juice cleanse programs, depending on how much detoxifying you’d like to do on your body and for how long. Customers can choose to detox anywhere from 5 to 20 days and results are best achieved the longer they remain on the programme. “I feel like I have so much more energy and my skin looks amazing!” was what one of my friends had told me after she completed the program. Some people take it one step further and just replace some of their meals with juice. Personally I enjoy my food and texture way too much to give it up for any number of days. Trying out kale with my juice is about the only juice adventure I’m willing to go on. Actually, the only time I prefer to get juiced is after a tough crossfit class, freshly blended with all my favorite accessories!\n\n17. www. tempoplanet.com 17 Let me start by admitting it took me longer than usual to write this column, especially since the topic, “mental strength,” has eluded me. Besides, I’ve only been able to get at its core and lock it down for brief periods of time. Why? Mental strength is like muscle strength; no one has unlimited supply. However, if we put mind into muscle and engage “resiliency” – the common denominator when seeking wisdom from a yogi, CEO and journalist – we are likely to soldier on despite challenges and setbacks. So, what do a yogi, CEO and journalist have in common? Each adjusts to discomfort, market fluctuations, and looming deadlines, respectively. They have the ability to adjust, recover and succeed in the face of adversity – that’s resiliency and it’s applicable to physical and mental strength. You can’t approach fitness or sport without the right mindset and ultimately, realistic expectations,but what happens when you plateau in weight loss or lose a competition? What will foster continued daily physical activity and delayed gratification while healing a bruised ego? Mental strength, of course, and that also entails flexibility, like having alternatives to your goal. Mark Twight, a demanding and highly effective celebrity trainer, credited for mind- body transformations from Spartan-actors in “300” and its sequel and more recently, “Man of Steel” Henry Cavill, says “the mind is primary…the actual physical effort and transformative process originates in the mind.” So, focus on what you can control, like strength of character. His training sessions begin with an interview and based on his ENGAGE YOUR CORE KNOW YOUR FISH! clients’ responses, he adjusts training and diet to adapt to everything else. “Training doesn’t exist alone, and it’s not the most important thing. It’s an integrated part,” says Twight. If you’ve ever set sights on a goal, you are essentially uncovering what you’re capable of – what is already there – like leaning out to show off your hard-earned six-pack. However, it is natural to feel apprehensive when embarking on a new endeavor. My client tells me she must unearth confidence deep within herself every time she kits up for kite-surfing. Yet, she gains courage and insight each and every time she surfaces. Just think, “While this is tough, I’m tougher.” Don’t risk giving in or giving up because living below your ideal or standards leads to frustration and worse, self-destruction. Instead, risk vulnerability by enlisting others for accountability and inspiration. Focus on impressing yourself and always count your blessings. Mix the ingredients together and cover both sides of each fillet, place in an oblong dish, cover and refrigerate for 1 hour. Remove fish from the fridge to come to room temperature. In the meantime, empty one tin of coconut milk in a large pan - allow to simmer. Gently place the fillets and the juices in to the pan. Don’t allow the sauce to boil or the fillets will fall apart. Simmer for 5 minutes – turning once (ensure cooked). Remove the fillets on to a warm plate and cover. Boil the sauce to reduce the liquid (approx. 5 minutes), lightly drizzle the sauce over the fish and serve immediately. The remaining sauce can be served on the side. The fish would work well with steamed brown rice or brown noodles, served with green vegetables. lean and cleanBy Melissa Lowry @fitandfaithfulforever By Donna Howarth @cleaneatuae I hold my hands up, I made a mistake this month – I purchased Hamour! What is the matter with that, I hear you ask? Whilst researching Hamour recipes and how I could cook this lovely chunky fish, my web browser revealed an article, which stated; “Hamour is currently being fished at seven times the sustainable rate and is the most overfished species in the UAE!” I was racked with guilt and scolded myself for not being aware of the UAE’s fish crisis, how could I be so ignorant? I was also reminded of UK’s Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s “Big Fish Fight” Channel4 Series and “The Fish Fight Campaign” of which I watched and signed the online petition! I was compelled to write this article as my reaction was, if I did not know then, I am sure there will be others – especially with our society being so transient. I was eager to learn if the UAE was taking any action to protect their fish reserves and I was relieved to discover that there is a charity called ‘Choose Wisely’ (supported by WWF) - that is based in Abu Dhabi - to address such issues. I invite you all to visit www. choosewisely.ae to learn more about what is being done to protect the UAE’s reserves. The website includes a handy consumer guide to assist when choosing your fish and a recipe book in English and Arabic – both can be downloaded. For this month’s clean recipe I have decided to use Yellow Tail Scad as this is on the ‘green’ scale of the consumer guide. I purchased my fish from one of the large supermarkets… the cost was Dh 20.50 per kilo – which I thought was very reasonable and affordable by the majority of families. Yellow Tail is a ‘medium’ tasting fish and when poached, the meat comes away quite easily from the bones. The fish can be baked, fried, barbecued and grilled, therefore, making it quite a versatile fish. Thai Style Yellow Tail Scad poached in Coconut Milk. (Serves 4) - Fillets from 2 large fish - Juice of 1 lime - 1tsp each - fresh ginger, garlic & lemon grass - 4 spring onions – green parts only, chopped - 1 heaped tablespoon of chopped fresh parsley - 3 tablespoons of nut oil - Season with black pepper and sea salt\n\n20. www. tempoplanet.com20 time capsule LIFE MUSIC FOOD TRAVELABOUT ME Your most valued possession?

Krousiano: Well, my real name is Kevin Krouse. Most call me Kevkrouse but you can call me Krousiano. I’m 22, from Detroit, Michigan. I’m an artist-songwriter. Tempo: How does a rapper from Detroit deal with challenges here? Krousiano: The biggest challenge I’ve come across so far is trying to connect with the right people for studio time, professional photos, and videos, as well as building local fan base. Tempo: We heard you trained with R-Kelly – how did that happen? Krousiano: It was heaven, I learned a lot. That man is a pure genius. I’ve had a chance to be one on one with somebody who’s been in this industry before I was born…and is still relevant today. His teachings have made me be a better writer. He taught me that it’s important to make your audience see and feel what your writing as if it were a picture I was painting; to adopt a strong work ethic; discipline in making music; and professionally representing myself. Tempo: Any funny moments with R-Kelly? Krousiano: Some were surreal. For example Kelly’s studio, ‘the Blue Room’ has many of his platinum plaques mounted. It’s hypnotic…same as meeting other celebrities whether it was basketball or in the club. I remember Kelly saying, “Don’t be all- star struck”. But my most favourite moment was going to Club Excalibur in downtown Chicago. Idris Elba (actor) and Dj Pharris were there. R-Kelly and I stepped off the tour bus with his entourage from the cameras straight to the VIP room as if we were in a movie scene. He treated me like family; I can say he is one of the most influential male figures in my life. Tempo: What sets you apart from other rappers? Krousiano: I feel like this… Where I’m from its all about who has the most money, sells the most drugs, and who got the most street credibility. I feel that since this is the main focus of many rappers in my city and across America that I can create and bring forth my own message… one that Ambition is nothing without hard work and for singer-songwriter, Kevin Krouse aka Krousiano, the sky is the limit to his dream of being the next big thing in the R&B/Hip-Hop scene. Tempo gave the mike to Krousiano and let him drop the beat…\n\n23. www. tempoplanet.com 23 want to make your dreams come true there’s no time to sleep. Me personally, I’m up like a vampire ALL NIGHT chasing my dreams! Tempo: What’s your ‘tempo’? Krousiano: Speed! My music and my work ethic has a fast tempo. I’m at a 170+ bpm (beat per minute) when it comes to working. Every day I write… record, write… record, and write… record. It is hectic and very hard work, but for me it’s a way of life. Back home my partner, Chase Dinero is the same way. We both work ridiculously hard and act as if doing music is as important as breathing. So when I hear the word tempo, I relate it to what we call “the grind of life” because coming from a fast paced city I too must have a steady fast and upbeat tempo…a strong rhythm that flows to the beat of my heart! promotes hope and inspiration to all people. What I feel sets me apart from them in my story, my lyrics. I simply want to bring real hip-hop back. As an upcoming artist, it’s about creating uplifting lyrics and a new sound that everybody can relate to. Tempo: Would you let us in on your upcoming music video? Krousiano: It’s called ‘Meditation / F.T.P.’ and it’s short for Fight the Power. It’s about clearing my mind and getting away from stress and drama and finding inner peace. It’s also to raise awareness about how unarmed black youth in America are being treated by law enforcement. Tempo: What’s your take on the UAE’s music scene? Krousiano: There is potential! But it hasn’t yet been brought out. I come from Detroit, the Home of Motown Music, so it’s in my blood to bring out music wherever I go. The UAE is becoming more modernized by the day and I want to be the pioneer to help music develop. I asked a group of young men in the local mall if they listen to Hip-Hop. They told me no and I felt that Hip-Hop has a negative image in the UAE. So, I want to bring that “change” in thinking… to promote a positive Hip-Hop image not only in the UAE and beyond. I’m also interested in linking up with local talent in the UAE. I believe crossing Arabic and American music will help build a new platform for anyone who has a dream of becoming an entertainer in the Hip-Hop industry. Tempo: Any advice for aspiring rappers? Krousiano: Yes! Always pursue your dreams regardless of your situation or reality. Make it your job, your study. You need to live, eat, sleep what you desire to do in life to be great. When I say sleep I don’t mean it in a literal since. If you\n\n24. Under the Patronage of H.E.

Mind Your Hashtags is an art exhibition by THE (The Henosis Events) team held at The Space Abu Dhabi. “Abu Dhabi is the buzzing centre of contemporary art in the Middle East not just because Guggenheim and Louvre museums are opening here but also because of the wealth of artists who reside in the capital,” says Ashvin, one of the artist-curators for Mind Your Hashtags. “These artists have a unique view about the world around them, and they feel the need to express it. That has always been our focus. And the result was spectacular. The word Hashtags in the title does not take itself too seriously… it is used tongue-in- cheek to present the new-age vices through which our daily ‘social’ lives are ‘tagged’ and ‘hash tagged’. The open call challenge asked artists’ expression of the mindboggling realities of the 21st century… and their personal interpretations of the details around them. The 50 new artworks showing at this event are by 17 artists from 9 countries: Eman Hakim (Egypt), Saif Mhaisen (Palestine), Desislava Dare (Bulgaria), Mark Barretto (Philippines), Ram Nath (UK), IS (Palestine) Suhair Fakhoury (Jordan), Laurette Kovary (USA), Ashvin (India), B’lu (India), Sofia Chatzisaranti (Greece), Sara Amer (Philippines), Haafiza Sayed (India), Sumanta Dahda (India), Michael Turda (Philippines), Romy Ravindran (India) and Nissa Riyas (India). “We believe that it is a social responsibility to encourage artists to keep producing the thought-provoking environment they are able to create for the community.

Fatima Abdulla Farah Abdulrahman and I applied what we have been learning, and used that to design of two banknotes. Later we designed two more banknotes to complete a series. We also got the help from a third team member, Shaima Al Amari, who also got the chance to attend the whole workshop and understand the rules of bank note security. During the process, we received lots of encouragement and feedback from our teachers, families and fellow students. Experiencing the field of banknote designing made us think about extending our knowledge and experience into applying it in real jobs. Winning the banknote design contest, we were thrilled to visit KBA-NotaSys in Switzerland and meet experienced designers and learn the printing process of banknotes.”\n\n29. www. tempoplanet.com 29 AGAINST ALL ODDS: MAMOON SULTANBy Vera Rosales We all have our aspirations in life, from wanting to become a grade school teacher to managing a successful startup company - maybe even becoming a famous celebrity. However for visually impaired Mamoon Sultan, being able to lead a normal life and find a way to contribute to society, in his own way, is his goal in life. Diagnosed with cataract at the age of six, Mamoon Sultan was born in Yemen and moved with his family at a young age to the UAE. Doctors kept telling his parents that it would be an easy procedure to treat the cataract however luck was not on Mamoon’s side when lost sight in his left eye. The son of a production controller and a housewife, Mamoon’s education was planned only until the ninth grade. After seeing him doing very well, his teachers and friends urged him to continue his schooling. His mother coached him at home, helping him with his reading and writing and Mamoon was able to complete high school. But he hit a roadblock that lasted for eleven years: there were not many colleges that provided support for the visually impaired. “During this time, people told me that I couldn’t do anything because of my blindness – even my father told me that he did not expect much from me. This made me feel envious of my brothers whom my father was always watchful of. This made me want to prove myself to them”. Mamoon stayed at home until an institute for the visually impaired called“Tamkeen” was established in Dubai. The institution developed and equipped the blind through courses that helped them attain jobs in various organizations. After his completion of Tamkeen’s specialized programme, Mamoon started his job hunt by sending CVs to different companies. Then Standard Chartered Bank showed interest in him. After interviewing him the bank hired him in their Abu Dhabi branch. Mamoon says the bank appreciated his performance as customer service representative turned floor manager. “They told me how much the branch’s image improved because of me. I even received a letter of thanks from management commending me for a job well done”. One day his manager introduced him to the head of Higher Colleges of Technology and invited him to continue his education at New York Institute of Technology – Abu Dhabi on a full scholarship. A few weeks later he found himself in the college studying Business Administration. Mamoon struggled at first. “To be honest with you I was feeling a bit strange, I did not know anyone, and nobody knew me. I started by taking one to two courses in the first three semesters because no one could help me and as a visually impaired person I need more time to finish my work. A normal person could read a simple page in five minutes, but for me it would take at least twenty to read and understand”. But with generous help from friends he calls the “The Three Musketeers,” Mamoon was able to complete his Bachelor’s Degree. Mamoon loves living in Abu Dhabi. “The streets here are very simple to remember. And if I need to catch a taxi, I would just use my phone. If you go to any companies and tell them about your disability, the staff is accommodating and gives you priority. Sadly, I can’t use the bus system.” Whenever Mamoon receives praise from his peers he points out that anybody can do what he did, the only difference is that he can’t see as well as everybody else. “We must always believe in ourselves and be open to learning. It’s a matter of showing interest and doing the hard work. Many people are given opportunities but fail to seize them; it is because they do not have the interest.’ Still employed at Standard Chartered Bank Mamoon is planning on pursuing his MBA at New York Institute of Technology - Abu Dhabi. His favourite subjects are marketing, management and business. Despite his father’s reservations, he plays football and swims.

Paul D: You were born in Chicago, Illinois. What was life like growing up there? Dennis: Growing up in Chicago made me a survivor. The negative media Chicago receives is sometimes the truth and sometimes not. If you can make it out of Chicago, you can make it anywhere. My view on life is to take advantage of it and find a plan to ensure you are successful. Paul D: How has growing up there shaped your perspective? Dennis: Many friends and family members’ lives were cut short in Chicago due to violence. These unfortunate incidents taught me to cherish life. My parents had four sons which include me, Shaun, Darius, and Johnathan. All of my parents’ children have been shot or killed except for me, and I am the oldest at thirty-five years old. Shaun was murdered by gun violence in 1996, Darius is paralyzed from the waist down due to gun violence in 1999, and my younger brother, Johnathan, was shot in the back and hip in 2010. These tragedies pushed me to have a better life. My main goal was to get out of Chicago to find a better way. The great aspect about Chicago is the togetherness of the city. We come together when times get tough. Paul D: Your story is an impressive one of survival and triumph. I joined your kickball league last year and playing on my team, The Desert Kickers, has been one of my best experiences in the UAE thus far. Explain the art of kickball for those that have never heard of it. Dennis: Kickball is by far the easiest sport to learn and play. It is played similarly to baseball and softball. Instead of using a bat, players use their feet to kick the ball and run to the various bases. The ball is a 10-12 inch sized, red, rubber ball that is rolled to the kicker. Once the ball is kicked, the kicker can be hit with the ball to be called out or have the ball thrown to the base. Paul D: Kickball was popular for many in the USA during childhood. Why are adults so excited about this sport? Dennis: I think it’s because adults want to be kids again. Everyone wants to have fun, and everyone wants to get fit. It’s popular because people of all shapes and sizes can play. We not only play kickball but party, travel, and socialize as a family. Paul D: When did you first notice it taking off with adults in the US? Dennis: I noticed it when I was approached by a group of women who were playing it recreationally. I also have a refereeing company so they contacted me and asked me if I can provide officials for their respective leagues. I helped improve the league by adding elements of organization with which the ladies were not aware. After that, leagues started popping up in Atlanta everywhere and word spread that I organized them and provided officials. That’s how it took off in the adult world. Paul D: Your sports company that oversees your kickball events is called 3C Sports. Can you explain the inspiration of that name? Dennis: 3C is named after my three daughters who last names are Crump like mine. While trying to find a name for my company, I wanted to find a meaning that would remind me to stay motivated and give my all to the company. The best thing to do was name it after the people for whom I would die. The name means something. Paul D: How can people find out more about your activities in the UAE? Dennis: They can e-mail me at 3ckickball@mail.com. Paul D: Well, I have to say I got a kick out of this interview. Can you back away to the other side of the restaurant, so I can ball up the check and kick it to you? It is the best of times; it is the worst of times. It has insidiously entered our home and taken over our lives. It used to be the teenagers’ prerogative, but its glamour disappeared when their moms got on board… keeping tab on their movements! The ‘clever’ ones have two accounts. A safe FB for family, and a ‘cool’ one for their friends. Who wants their moms to patronize their wall anyway? Or an old, unfashionable aunt saying something outrageous? This week we heard of the oldest woman on FB: the 114-year-old woman had to lie to join Facebook. Due to its age limitations, a newly tech-savvy Minnesotan had to lie about her age to join the social network. In another case a 70 year old mama told her husband, ‘O hon, did you post that hippo picture? Do it quick.” After ten minutes, her hubby happily announces there are ‘two likes’. They both sip coffee, munching on their doughnut in glee. Rewriting a Steve Jobs Quote On a FB wall, you come across the ‘crazy ones, misfits, rebels, and troublemakers’. Some who see things differently – who are not fond of rules. You can share their quotes, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but you can’t ignore them. Part of the human race surges forward with a brilliant quote - while one half sees them as the crazy ones, the other half sees genius. The highly motivated ones think that they can change the world; and sometimes they actually do. Jump in the Fray; its Good for Your Mind When you don’t have a mind boggling, debatable, insightful, ecstatic update- deserving thought in your mind, consider it bad. Thinking positive and powerful thoughts can keep Alzheimer’s and boredom away. It can start you giggling inwards, with a sense of joy and achievement. The mind benefits when on full alert. Watching television news these days does awful things to your brain. You Can Update While Waiting for Oven to Beep Visiting somebody else’s wall is like dropping in to someone’s home. Often times we are caught up within our own (home’s) walls: sprucing it, making it look intelligent, worldly wise, funny, holy, spiritual, linguistically superior, and as ethical as the moment seizes us. And after we ‘post’, we sit back and wait for our guests to enter and ‘like’ our decor and little appetizers. There’s also the desire to keep up with the Joneses! Even coveting your neighbor’s good (updates) and wishing you had got there first. There’s a race to show one’s intelligence quotient, one’s travel diary, one’s charitable vein, one’s luscious curves… the list is endless. The truth is nobody wants to own a colourless home… or a blank Facebook page. This is a good revolution. So write on my wall, please! articulate cafe\n\n31. www. tempoplanet.com 31 Parenting: Not such a bubble after all Worldwide Friendships By Nisma Hamid/@nismahamid By Heather Long Vandevoorde, Ph.D./@hvdvoorde Over coffee, my girlfriends and I often discuss how fortunate we are to be parents in this relatively safe UAE society with the low crime rate. The risk of kidnapping and theft is far lower than in our home countries. Our kids can, by and large, speak to strangers without reservation. “Stranger danger” is a foreign concept. But, inevitably that is when the conversation turns to the downside of the way we live: traveling. We all feel the same, the moment we leave the UAE; we become different parents, telling our kids not to talk to strangers and holding them firmly by the hand at all times. I’ve said, time after time, to my friends how concerned I am about my kids when they have to leave the bubble of safety in the UAE for the “real world.” How will they survive coming from such a secure setting and being released into the cold, harsh, real world? It was just this line of conversation I was rattling off with Patricia, the woman I consider my mentor, during her recent visit to Abu Dhabi from the USA. “My kids live in such a bubble. Their exposure to crime, drugs, alcohol and other teenage problems faced by kids in Europe and North America is so minimal that I fear what will happen when they go off to university there,” I sighed. “I don’t know how to prepare them.” To my surprise, she was not at all sympathetic to my cause. In fact, what she said threw me completely off-track. “Heather,” she said, “your kids are so much better prepared than most kids their age around the world. They have a wealth and depth of experience that cannot compare.” Specifically, she went on to describe that my kids: • Can speak easily, without hesitation, to non-native English speakers. During her visit, Patricia saw my girls interact with people with every level of English. They never skipped a beat or failed to get their point across, regardless of whom they were speaking with. They have developed patience and perseverance. They are good communicators. • Interact easily with people from different cultures. Along the same lines as the previous point, we see every type of native dress in the UAE. “I’ll admit, even I was a little overwhelmed by the fully-covered local ladies here. It’s really different for me to see,” Patricia said. What she noticed was that my girls will talk to anyone with ease. They are not prejudiced or intimidated by any style of dress or makeup. • Are independent and not always at Mommy’s side. While I had only seen the negative side of this for their future, she pointed out that my girls are self-confident travelers, leaders who are comfortable in a variety of situations. Patricia cited an example from when we were in an unfamiliar souk and were momentarily uncertain of how to return to the car. They didn’t freak out, they asked for help and made a resourceful plan. • Have strong negotiation skills. When shopping at the Gold Souk, Patricia found a bracelet she wanted to buy. The girls were instantly at my husband’s side, confidently helping him negotiate a price. “Most of the kids their age in the USA would never even think a price was negotiable, let alone care about helping to reduce it,” she said. “Negotiation is a skill that will directly translate to their success professionally.” Patricia’s comments opened my eyes. I have always been proud of the fact that my daughters are not shy and don’t lack self- confidence. But she showed me that this is a direct reflection of the life they have had and the environment they operate in. She pointed out that my kids have every chance of making intelligent choices when released into the “real world” for university because of the internal filters we have helped them build by the experiences they are having daily right now. “Kids can develop danger-awareness easily,” she said. “But how to be resourceful and get out of tricky situations is a bigger challenge. Your kids have a real leg up in that department.” I was grateful for the relief she stirred in me. My responses will be very different the next time the conversation arises with my girlfriends. parental guide Living in the UAE comes with so many benefits; if it didn’t, we wouldn’t be here, would we? But life here isn’t perfect; some of the few downfalls of living here are the friendships you make. How can friendships be bad? Because everyone leaves! The UAE is a ‘transit’ country. People come and go, on to their new lives or back to their old ones. I can’t relate to most of these people because I’ve been in the UAE since I was three. I have rarely met another expat who’s been in the country for a big a percentage of their lives as me. I now find myself trying to distance myself from intimate friendships. I try to stray between cliques, where my friends are all ages, religions, and nationalities. I do this because I do not want to be hurt when reality strikes and someone I care about has to leave the country. I want to avoid the pain that happened when some of my closest friends left. My neighbor was in my grade 3 through 7, and was also my best friend. In the summer of the sixth grade she told me she was moving to Canada. I was absolutely shattered. Who was I going to spend my time with? Since I wasn’t ‘popular’, was I going to be alone? Those questions haunted me, filling me with dread and selfishness. We began our long-distance relationship with late phone calls and Facebook messages. Soon contact became less and farther apart until, eventually, they stopped altogether. I still like to say that she was an extremely important part of my life. Another friend I met in 5th grade also met with the same fate. We were really close - we bonded well because we saw ourselves as outcasts, shunned by our peers. She was shy and not a lot of people heard her speak, but she did not feel insecure around me. Just when we were at the height of our friendship, she left to Sweden. I’m still in touch with her: we Skype, snapchat, and call each other often. She’s now a big shot model in Sweden, Tokyo, and LA. If she could go from an introvert to a confident model, I too can achieve my goals and follow my dreams. I am so thankful for the friendship we share, but I also resent the distance that has come between us. Ever since she left, I’ve come out of my shell and have begun to socialize with different people, with many groups of friends. I still don’t have a best friend for fear of the day one of us moves or graduates. When I graduate I know all my friends will no longer be with me, proving that avoiding the pain of separation is pointless. On the bright side, who knows, maybe I’ll end up reuniting with the friends that have left before.\n\n33. www. tempoplanet.com 33 Swaydat Khassaf By Salma Saif Mohamed Rashed Harmash Al Mansoori Flying Beds and Invisibility Suits By Anthony Freeman and Paul Freeman THE OTHER EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD By Amal Naseem ZAYED UNIVERSITY’S AL KHARAREEF STORYTELLING CLUB was created to enrich the legacy of the Emirati storytelling tradition and contribute to the revival of this important cultural heritage within the United Arab Emirates. Last year, the Club in partnership with the Abu Dhabi Music & Arts Foundation launched an Emirati cultural literacy project titled the Story Mile, a collection of 48 original fables and folktales, written by students from the Academic Bridge Program, illustrated by the College of Arts and Creative Enterprise majors and translated by ZOWD volunteers into the language of its characters, Emirati dialect. The Story Mile tales, which are the first of a three volume series, were recently published as a book in English and titled “Tales from the Emirates” in Arabic. The stories not only share the storytelling tradition of the Emirates, but have also introduced other key aspects of Emirati culture and are creating new footprints in the sands of the cultural landscape of the UAE. FLASH FICTION IS A STYLE OF FICTIONAL LITERATURE CHARACTERIZED BY BREVITY; WITH THE STANDARD BEING A STORY OF UNDER 1000 WORDS. A family lived on a farm that people said was haunted. One of the rooms, guarded by a jinni, stored dates filled with woven baskets called Swaydat Khassaf. One day, Ahmed heard a sound from the hallway and ran away. Then, the same thing happened to his sister Hamda. The next day, they told their father Zayed, but he just laughed. The twins didn’t stop until their father checked. “Look, there is nothing here!” he said. Suddenly, they heard a sound. Zayed went to see. “Go and wait for me,” he said. He stretched out his hand and opened the room. He saw nothing but Swaydat Khassaf. As he stepped inside, the door suddenly closed! Zayed tried to open it, but couldn’t. In the dusky room, he saw a small light in one corner. He yelled for help, but no one heard. Night came and Zayed was still locked in, so he decided to see what the light was. There were two yellow eyes and a black shadow. A jinni was standing behind him. “Zayed, I’m not the kind of jinni you think,” it said. “How do you know my name?” shouted Zayed. The jinni laughed, “I am a jinni. How do you expect me not to know?” Zayed fell to the ground, crying, “Why? Why? Why?” The jinni felt bad, so he opened the door. Zayed jumped up but felt so dizzy he nearly fell over. Luckily, the jinni caught him. “I’ll let you go, but you must not tell anyone about me,” it whispered. Zayed promised and the jinni set him free. Outside, Hamda, Ahmed and their mother were waiting. When they saw Zayed, they ran towards him, but the jinni made a noise. Sara got a knife and pulled Zayed towards the cottage. Once inside, they asked what had happened. Zayed only said there were rats in the storage room. All of a sudden Zayed woke up! He realized that it was just a dream. Zayed told this tale to his twins for the rest of their childhoods so that they would never go into dark places alone. I was digging in the garden while mum was at work when I found a dirty old lamp. As I rubbed off the dirt, a genie appeared. “I’ll grant you three wishes,” said the genie. “I wish I had a flying bed,” I said, because I wanted to take a ride to far away places. The next moment my bedroom windows swung open. My bed flew out of the room and disappeared. The genie laughed. “What’s your next wish?” “I wish I had an invisibility suit,” I replied. With an invisibility suit I could trip up the school bullies in the corridors or push them off their bikes. The genie laughed again. “Your wish is granted. But if you can’t see your invisibility suit, you’ll never find it. What’s your final wish?” Angry with the genie, I said, “I wish you were back in the lamp.” The genie was furious, but he disappeared back into the lamp, so I went and threw it in the sea. When I got back home, I found that my bed had returned; and when I opened the fridge to get a cold drink, I found an invisibility suit inside. “School bullies, watch out!” I said. What’s the difference? I ask as an 18-year- old blessed to have been born into a loving, well to do family - living in one of the richest countries in the world. I ask as an 18 year old who has been given all that she’s ever asked for…and not asked for. I am ever thankful to the one and only for being so merciful and gracious. But now I ask, what’s the difference between me and that other 18-year-old girl… the one who is exactly like me, yet miles away from me? Whilst I enjoy reading my favourite books sipping my green tea in my backyard, she is walking the streets begging for food. Why? Whilst I tease my younger sister and my brother, she is being sold to criminals by her own brother. Why? Whilst I shop with my mother, she shrieks out for her dead mother. Why? Whilst I have a heart to heart conversation with my father, she is getting a beating from her father for being born a girl. Why? What is the difference? What have I done that she hasn’t? What is in me that isn’t in her? Why do I get to enjoy all these worldly pleasures while she suffers each and every second of her life? Her heart is pure as gold, her tears speak a thousand words, her eyes hide a million dreadful stories. She sees herself as defective; a damaged piece being torn alive. All she prays for is to go back to her Master. Her poor body is tired. She feels hollow inside. She needs love and compassion to fill her. She needs God. She loves Him despite the trials and hardships He has put her through. She knows she will be blessed in the afterlife. She cherishes life despite being tired of it. Now I understand the difference between her and me. I believe that I shall be answerable for both her life and mine, because I have the power to help her. I can change the helpless state that she seems destined to live. She is no different from me; we’ve sprouted from the same roots and bloomed in different directions. She is a sister, a consciousness, and a duty.\n\n34.

On the third Thursday of every month, trustee members of the Coral Gables Chamber of Commerce attend an upscale luncheon at the historic Biltmore Hotel and listen to a business leader outline a new company project or summarize recent achievements. Every so often, there’s a change of pace as we say in baseball, a slower ball than expected, and at the trustee luncheons that can mean something less serious and more fun than a business presentation. Once a year, the Coral Gables Chamber promotes the Miami Heat, one of the dominant teams in the NBA since 2010. Recently, however, the Heat have begun spiraling downward. First, they lost the NBA final series to the San Antonio Spurs, and, worse, they lost superstar LeBron James to the Cleveland Cavaliers, the team he had left in 2010 to move south. Many American business men and women are enthusiastic sports fans, and professional sports teams benefit from sponsorship by local and national companies. The Heat have been the joy of Miami and the Chamber since 2010. The football Dolphins were local favourites when they won the Super Bowl in 1972 and 1973. The baseball Marlins were cheered when they won the championship World Series in 1997 and 2003. Then came the drought in national championships for Miami-based professional sports teams that lasted until the Heat began serious winning four years ago. That phase is now over, and we’ll see how long it takes for the Heat without LeBron to become dominant again. Regardless, the Coral Gables Chamber supports the Heat and holds an annual luncheon for the team before the season begins. Several players attend and participate in a panel, talk about their plans and hopes for 2014-15, and answer questions. The best part, however, was before the luncheon began. As we approached the ballroom entrance, a line formed. Why? Because inside, on a small platform, stood three of the Heat’s players: colourful and multi-tattooed forward Chris “Birdman” Anderson and rival point guards Norris Cole and Mario Chalmers. As each guest climbed on the platform, Ada Stevens, the official photographer, snapped a picture. No time to see how it came out, no chance to redo anything, one shot, that’s it. I had given my camera to the guy on line behind me who took a picture as I was turning away. Ada’s was much better. The players and I are standing at the same level. On the left is the short guy, Mario Chalmers. In the middle is Birdman who is taller than anyone you’ll ever meet outside of a basketball court, and on the right, Norris Cole, the other short guy. I’m 5 feet 6 inches or 1.68 meters and wearing low heels. No one in professional basketball is short. As we ate lunch, the players talked about how the team will manage without LeBron and how they handled injuries. They said there would be changes in offense and defense and agreed that several players – themselves included - would have to raise their game. Former Heat center and star Alonzo Mourning who is now Vice President of Player Programs for the Heat joined Anderson, Chalmers, and Cole in being optimistic about the team’s future. The fifth guest on the panel, Dr. Harlan Selesnick, never played but is crucial for stars and journeymen alike. He has been team doctor for the Heat since 1988, dealing with the injuries that afflict players during the long NBA season. Dr. Alma Kadragic Follow Alma on Twitter: @almakad Theresa F.
