        "text": "It’s time to fight about fights. Illustration: Kyle Hilton\n\nThere’s no one element necessary for a great movie fight — but there are many elements that can make a movie fight great. It could be a performer’s physical mastery: Consider Donnie Yen punching a foe into the ground in Ip Man, his furious, rapid-fire blows evoking the pitter-patter of rain. Perhaps it’s the sheer relentlessness on display, as with John Wick procedurally mowing down wave after wave of bad guys in his ceaseless pursuit of revenge and redemption. Or a moment may simply look cool as hell. Remember Patrick Swayze ripping out a guy’s throat in Road House? Of course you do. Such brawls elicit a primal pleasure, as if the rhythmic crunching of bones emits a frequency that tickles an ancient part of the brain. A good movie fight is a feast for the eyes, but a great one feeds the soul.\n\nBehind every such symphony of onscreen savagery is a village of craftspeople responsible for bringing its brutality to life: the stunt performers and choreographers who design action, the cinematographers and editors who frame it, the Foley artists and sound specialists who add gales of body-on-body thunder — all united by a vivid understanding of the body as instrument, elegant and destructive. The first fights committed to screen, long before stunts were professionalized and sound caught up with image, were enchanting for the suggestion of what you couldn’t hear: the boom of a boxing glove hitting a shoulder (or a cat), the yowl after a blow, the chuckle after a Buster Keaton–esque whiff. As action cinema evolved beyond the silent era, swashbuckling epics and westerns introduced a heightened reality through clanging swords and gunfire. By the time They Live’s six-minute opus arrived in 1988, the exaggerated punches, kicks, and reactions of early Hollywood were barely detectable in the sweaty naturalism that governs the modern fight aesthetic.\n\nThe Action Edition\n\nThe Action Edition\n\nRead All the Stories\n\nTo celebrate that ever-changing history of onscreen violence, we engaged in our own sort of tussle: trying to identify the 100 movie fights that have had the greatest impact on the genre of action cinema. Beginning with a scene from the 1890s that depicts an unconventional boxing match, the list we assembled illustrates the evolution of the fight scene over time. Entries were selected based on how they shaped filmmaking techniques, realized a new trope, marked a step forward in the professionalization of stuntwork, and/or simply served as a grand achievement in using physical violence as a creative and narrative tool. Some of the fights may not be the originating source of a given breakthrough but have instead become regarded as the most noteworthy embodiment of it.\n\nWe focused on brawls, duels, assaults, and other similarly sized physical altercations as our area of study. (That approach meant opting against a more expansive definition that would include, say, verbal arguments. Sorry, Marriage Story heads.) A “fight” is distinct from a “battle,” insofar as the former occurs between individuals or small groups (humans or otherwise) and the latter involves armies — though specific fights within a battle were eligible. Traditional shoot-outs were ineligible since they lack the intimate proximity of a real fight; put simply, opponents needed to be able to sweat on one another. But firearms do show up, particularly as new styles of close-quarters combat such as gun fu and gun kata emerged. You will find some vehicular violence here, but a car or motorcycle chase alone doesn’t qualify without an element of jousting. Several entries involve animation or CGI, since those modes of filmmaking have always had that capacity to influence, and be influenced by, live action. And crucially, influential fight scenes aren’t limited to conventional action movies — if you haven’t already Ctrl+F’d, yes, Anchorman and Bridget Jones’s Diary made the cut.\n\nTo keep things manageable, we only considered fights occurring in films that were officially distributed in the U.S. at some point. While that gives the list a decidedly Hollywood lean, we made a distinct effort to reflect the many global contributions to fight scenes over the decades — taking into account how American cinema has adopted and appropriated combat styles from around the world. You’ll find an unsurprising gender disparity across these entries, a function of the historically male-dominated nature of this particular corner of cinema. Still, the latter end of the list provides a glimmer of hope that progress is being made.\n\nIn the interest of including the widest array of films, we permitted only one fight per franchise, which is why you won’t see movies such as The Matrix or series such as The Raid taking up multiple slots. However, many key individuals (Bruce Lee, fight choreographer William Hobbs) recur, reminders of a glorious time when stars outshined IP. The list slows down around the late 2010s owing to the nature of basic historiography: It’s hard to know how influential a work is going to be without time passing. There are just two selections from the 2020s, the inclusion of which should be viewed as a bet on their long-term significance. You may well disagree with some of the list’s selections and omissions; it seems unavoidable, in fact. But if that’s the case, we have good news: We’re on the internet. What better place for a fight? —Nicholas Quah\n\n1.\n\nCat vs. Cat, The Boxing Cat (1894)\n\nThe early days of the moving picture gave us so many of our basic cinematic genres and subgenres that it can be hard to tease out the specific threads of influence; everything, after all, flowed from these initial experiments and demonstrations. In 1894, Henry Welton’s touring cat circus visited Thomas Edison’s Black Maria studios in New Jersey, where two of his cats, Sullivan and Corbett, were filmed “fighting” by director William K.L. Dickson and cameraman William Heise while Welton held them up on their hind legs. They were wearing little boxing gloves in a little ring, the whole thing.\n\nSome have called this 22-second film the original cat video, which, sure. But it’s also generally regarded as the first time an animal fought another animal in a movie, whether it be in an action or humor context. These early films weren’t watched on theatrical movie screens but rather using Kinetoscopes — peep-show machines that an individual customer would pay to look through. Nevertheless, they were quite popular; Welton’s cat circus reportedly saw a rise in admissions after the movie’s cinematic debut. And while there’s arguably a bit of cruelty involved here (at least one of the cats looks like it wants to walk away), it was nothing compared to the other insane stuff they did to animals in the early days of cinema. —Bilge Ebiri\n\n2.\n\nMike Leonard vs. Jack Cushing, The Leonard-Cushing Fight (1894)\n\nFilmmakers were using Kinetoscopes to capture men fighting men, too. But this six-round exhibition fight between Mike Leonard and Jack Cushing isn’t listed here because it’s a mere documentary record of a thing that would have happened anyway. It was an event created in order to be filmed (also at Black Maria studios) and viewed through a Kinetographic peephole, the boxing ring built in front of a black wall to better background the fighters’ pale skin and make them visually legible on film. Five months later, it was followed by Corbett and Courtney Before the Kinetograph (also known as Edison Kinetoscopic Record of Boxers and The Corbett-Courtney Fight), another fight that people had to pay to view by the round (or reel), rather than experience in person. Both were commercial successes, setting the stage for the Corbett-Fitzsimmons fight three years later.\n\nCorbett fought Bob Fitzsimmons on St. Patrick’s Day in Carson City, Nevada, this time in a more documentary-like scenario, although the filmmaker ordered the ring built two feet smaller than regulation to get a better composition and was caught by boxing officials and ordered to rebuild it correctly. The fight ran for 71 to 100 minutes, depending on who exhibited it. It was the first athletic event shot in “widescreen” format (a more rectangular ratio of 1:65 to 1) and is believed by some film scholars to constitute the first feature-length motion picture, the first pay-per-view sporting event (it was shown at full length in theaters in 12 cities), and the first sporting event to earn more money after the event than from tickets to the fight itself. The Corbett-Fitzsimmons fight led British Film Institute scholar Luke McKernan to declare in his book Cinema: The Beginnings and the Future that “it was boxing that created the cinema.” But it would never have been committed to film had Leonard and Cushing not slugged it out first. —Matt Zoller Seitz\n\n3.\n\nBuster Keaton vs. Jeff, College (1927)\n\nBuster Keaton was a pioneer as a stunt performer in addition to being a pioneer in everything else, but he wasn’t typically a fighter onscreen. The climactic scene in College was a notable exception with its stellar display of physical comedy helping to create a template for a certain kind of anything-goes scrum. Keaton played the bookish Ronald, who spends the film trying to win back ex-girlfriend Mary (Anne Cornwall) by attempting to prove himself at various collegiate athletic pursuits, failing spectacularly each time. Naturally, after Mary is taken hostage by Ronald’s detestable rival Jeff, the physical prowess that had eluded him all movie emerges in his time of need.\n\nRonald’s fight with Jeff comes at the end of a bravura sequence in which he sprints across campus, hurdles over hedges, and uses a pole that was propping up a clothesline to vault through the window. Then, rather than battle Jeff with his fists, he uses items from around the room as projectiles, hurling them at his cowering foe until the guy flees — at which point Ronald tosses a lamp at his back, javelin style. Keaton’s deadpan, combined with the extreme silliness of the fracas, made the scene a deeply satisfying reversal of everything audiences were accustomed to seeing. That approach to fighting, in which combatants throw any objects they can get their hands on (books! Pans! Chairs!) would become much more common — though rarely as funny. —Alison Willmore\n\n4.\n\nCharlie Chaplin vs. Prizefighter, City Lights (1931)\n\nA quick truth about human nature: When someone gets bonked on the head, and that someone isn’t us, it is, more often than not, funny. Few entertainers understood the high art of injury quite like Charlie Chaplin, whose lovable Tramp character could sometimes be surprisingly vicious. In City Lights, a set of wild circumstances has him colluding with a boxer to fake a fight: They agree to keep the blows soft and afterward they’ll split the purse. But when his partner in crime splits, he ends up in the ring with a real boxer. What follows is a highly choreographed tableau of cowardice transforming into bravery then collapsing into what can only be considered modern dance.\n\nThe sequence was revolutionary for taking something familiar and structured — a boxing match, once again — and isolating its component parts (the referee, the corners, the bell) to ensure each was exploited for maximum comedy, even if that involved breaking with reality. (One gag, in which Chaplin leaps from the canvas, defying gravity on a visible wire, plays like proto-wuxia.) Viewed as a whole, there’s a straightforwardness to the scene that belies its complexity; in actuality, it took four days of rehearsal and six days of shooting to get the choreography of it all just right. It’s little surprise that the film, with its mix of humor and athleticism, was listed by Jackie Chan as one of his ten favorite movies of all time. —Jordan Hoffman\n\n5.\n\nKing Kong vs. T. rex, King Kong (1933)\n\nMany films and filmmakers have claimed to push the boundaries of special effects, but few have taken a greater actual leap than the original King Kong. Released in 1933 by RKO Radio Pictures, directors Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack’s picture is a searing critique of consumerism, exploitation, and human depravity with unsettling racial subtext; it also contains an all-time classic creature fight. When fictional filmmaker Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong) ventures to the mythical Skull Island with actress Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) and a film crew, he hopes to capture the Eighth Wonder of the World: Kong. But on this prehistoric atoll, it’s Ann who becomes the focus of attention — the island’s native inhabitants kidnap her as a gift for the towering primate. Kong soon learns that keeping Ann safe in a jungle full of giant predators is no small feat, particularly when it’s a Tyrannosaurus rex that’s keen to snack on her. And so, while Ann watches from the branches of a tree, the King of the Beasts and the King of the Dinosaurs throw down.\n\nIt took seven weeks to shoot the scene: The intricate special effects relied on the stop-motion expertise of legendary animator Willis H. O’Brien to move the two 18-inch wired puppets in combat, a moment enlivened by the magic of rear-screen projection to place Wray in the fracas. Framed by trees and hanging vines, the creatures’ movements are viciously animalistic and lifelike as Kong swings haymakers, jumps on the carnivore’s back, and then cracks the T. rex’s jaw open; the proceedings are heightened by a devastating soundscape composed of the T. rex’s jaguarlike screech, Kong’s lionesque roar, and Wray’s iconic scream as the fight builds toward a final, gruesome bone crunch. King Kong’s influence on stop-motion — and fight cinema in general — has been felt since the second that T. rex’s limp body hit the ground. —Robert Daniels\n\n6.\n\nPopeye vs. Sinbad and His Goons, Popeye the Sailor Meets Sinbad the Sailor (1936)\n\nThese days, 16 minutes of animation might not sound like much material, but back in 1936, it was a hand-drawn ocean voyage — two reels of footage, three times longer than any other Popeye cartoon that had come before. That run time gave director Dave Fleischer, who with his brother Max would go on to release the influential Fleischer Superman cartoons, plenty of room to showcase the animated richness and idiosyncratic charm that would become the duo’s calling card. The bulk of the short’s action is a gauntlet: After Popeye’s girlfriend, Olive Oyl, is kidnapped from their boat, the sailor swims ashore and squares up against a pair of lions, a giant vulture, a two-headed giant, and then, ultimately, the evil pirate Sinbad.\n\nPopeye makes short work of all of them using a series of noodly “twister punches,” fortitude, and, naturally, a well-timed can of spinach. At one point, the vulture carries him off to a volcano and Popeye returns in a tornado (a riff on the already-popular “Big Ball of Violence” trope) serving up the bird, cooked, on a heaping platter. The fight was remarkable not just for its scale but also for the innovations that helped enhance it: This was the first Popeye special created in color, and the island setting of the brawl was created with a unique set of 3-D backgrounds: miniature sets arranged along a 12-foot circular turntable, rigged to be rotated incrementally and photographed one by one. The animation historian Jerry Beck, in his book The 50 Greatest Cartoons, called it “the best Popeye ever,” and Ray Harryhausen — of Jason and the Argonauts fame — later said that it influenced his own take, The 7th Voyage of Sinbad. —Eric Vilas-Boas\n\n7.\n\nErrol Flynn vs. Basil Rathbone, The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)\n\nThough he inhabited the role just once, the standard Errol Flynn set as Robin Hood nearly a century ago has yet to be surpassed. (Granted, fans of Disney’s fox may quibble with this claim.) Anchoring that legacy is the climactic duel to the death that Flynn’s Sir Robin of Locksley has against the nefarious Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone). While it’s neither the best, nor the first, sword fight captured on film (the latter distinction is difficult to pinpoint, though images of men fencing date back to Eadwearad Muybridge’s sequential photography in the late 1800s), the two-minute clash is nevertheless the one to which all subsequent swordplay has been compared.\n\nStarting on a staircase (you’ll find a number of those on this list), Robin and Guy descend into the bowels of the castle, their rapiers and wits hard at work. The fighting was largely performed by the actors themselves, two movie stars doing their own stunts long before that was something we celebrated; when doubles were used, directors Michael Curtiz and William Keighley employed clever tricks to hide them, most notably when the fighters’ shadows are projected onto a pillar. The combatants’ repartee deliciously cuts into the action, with Rathbone in particular chewing his dialogue to perfection as a candelabra pins Robin in a precarious position. As the fight crescendos, the two embrace before Robin delivers the killing blow—and the intimacy in that moment is arguably the most significant facet of the scene’s legacy. What is fighting if not one of the most intimate experiences two people can have? —Brandon Streussnig\n\n8.\n\nCowboys vs. Bar, Dodge City (1939)\n\nThe barroom brawl was a staple of the western genre for years, and the central fight scene in Michael Curtiz’s Dodge City is an astonishing example, one that was never quite topped. (Even the famous saloon fight in Shane, which maybe does more with actual character development, takes a back seat to it.) Armed with a studio budget, Curtiz let the scene gather force as an entire saloon got demolished and an army of stuntmen bounced around. (The star of the film, Errol Flynn, wasn’t actually present.) Roulette wheels and poker tables go flying. Men are lassoed and dragged. The entire bar is ripped out of the wall, while enough chairs to seat the population of Arkansas are cracked over people’s heads. One dude collapses through several stories’ worth of stairs. It’s a minor miracle that nobody died in the making of the scene, which was so expansive and delightfully destructive that snippets were reused in many subsequent westerns, particularly on TV.\n\nBut there’s also this: The skirmish is set in motion after two groups of cowboys have a testy confrontation over music. On one side are the ostensible good guys, a group of roving herdsmen who had fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War. (Dodge City, like many other westerns, embraced the trope of heroic, wandering, defeated southern soldiers.) The other faction is a bunch of former Union soldiers, allied with the film’s gangsterlike villain, Jeff Surrett (Bruce Cabot). The former Confederates object to the singing of the Yankee anthem “Marching Through Georgia” (written in the 1860s to commemorate General William T. Sherman’s taking of Georgia), and they respond by singing “Dixie.” The groups trade tunes before finally trading fists. Just three years later, Curtiz would direct Casablanca, which has an immortal scene featuring two groups in a bar facing off with opposing songs: The French refugees in Morocco joyfully sing “La Marseillaise” while their German occupiers bellow out “Die Wacht am Rhein.” (The bar remained intact in that instance.) —B.E.\n\n9.\n\nDora Standpipe and the Dover Boys vs. Dan Backslide, The Dover Boys at Pimento University (1942)\n\nThis Merrie Melodies short from animation maverick Chuck Jones tells the story of the Dover Boys, a trio of college gentlemen who must rescue Dora Standpipe, a presumed damsel in distress, from her kidnapper, the villainous Dan Backslide. The protagonists were a parody of the Rover Boys, characters from a popular series of books aimed at young readers in the early 20th century. In Jones’s spin, the Dover bros arrive to find that Dora has already defeated Backslide — then they inadvertently knock each other out while trying to get their own licks in on the villain.\n\nBeyond the tongue-very-much-in-cheek humor, the cartoon remains highly regarded for its early application of limited animation — a technique that uses fewer frames per second than what is known as full animation (how most hand-drawn Disney films were made), which makes character movement appear less smooth. That decision was an aesthetic choice by Jones and one that would become increasingly popular in the decades that followed. Of particular note was the use of smear frames to simulate motion, such as in the scene where one of the Dovers punches Backslide and causes his head to rattle from side to side. At the time of the short’s release during World War II, the spoof of the Rover Boys resonated with audiences; now, more than 80 years later, its slapstick humor and remarkable artistry have proved timeless in their appeal. —Carlos Aguilar\n\n10.\n\nWong Fei-Hung vs. Tai Nan Nung, The True Story of Wong Fei-hung (1948)\n\nAn entire mode of action choreography was born here in a fight between Wong Fei-Hung (Kwan Tak-hing) — a wise teacher and champion of the oppressed (and a character based on a real historical figure) — and the villain Tai Nan Nung (Tang Tak-wah), who has beaten up the manager of a ginseng shop and taken his wife hostage. The clash wasn’t the first martial-arts fight recorded on film (the movie was conceived as an alternative to the soaring fantasy acrobatics of wuxia, a genre built around superhuman martial-arts feats), but it is thought to have introduced a style of fighting that was more realistic.\n\nBy modern standards, the scrap was stripped down, unassuming: men with long sticks and swords parrying and thrusting and leaping in wide shots that showcased their athleticism and eliminated any possibility of visual trickery. The sound was faithful to the depicted combat — there were no exaggerated “whoosh” sound effects of the type that would later become common — and the build-up saw Wong attempting diplomacy before resorting to violence. “Hold my stick and wait at the door for me,” he tells Ah-Chut, his right-hand man, before going inside and conversing with his adversary, the sort of sneering, preening bad guy who has powered eight decades of martial-arts movies. —M.Z.S.\n\n11.\n\nGuy Haines vs. Bruno Antony vs. an Out-of-Control Carousel, Strangers on a Train (1951)\n\nOf course Alfred Hitchock can turn an amusement-park carousel into a harrowing death trap. The climactic scene of Strangers on a Train, based on Patricia Highsmith’s debut novel, features tennis star Guy Haines (Farley Granger) facing off against devious psychopath Bruno Antony (Robert Walker), who has already murdered Guy’s wife and plans to incriminate him by planting evidence at the scene. Before Bruno is able to do so, Guy chases him onto a carousel that begins to spin out of control after a cop carelessly shoots the operator. As the two duke it out amid plaster horses and screaming children, a distraught mother realizes her young boy is caught in the middle of the fracas and a brave carnival worker crawls underneath the machine to reach the fail-safe.\n\nThe face-off sequence didn’t actually originate with Highsmith but was instead the climax of Edmund Crispin’s novel The Moving Toyshop, from which Alfred Hitchcock cribbed it. Nevertheless, the on-screen sequence is all Hitchcock, who successfully keeps those various balls in the air while rendering the scene delirious and surreal. The fight itself between Guy and Bruno on top of a spinning platform is plenty thrilling, culminating in a unrepentant Bruno trying to kick Guy off the carousel — but add in the child and the real-life carousel operator who actually crawled underneath the spinning ride and you have a fight scene for the ages. Many directors owe debts to Hitchcock for an assortment of reasons, but any scene that juggles multiple layers of suspense can be traced back to Strangers — especially if a rickety machine is involved. —Vikram Murthi\n\n12.\n\nDetective Sergeant Brown vs. the Assassin Kemp, The Narrow Margin (1952)\n\nWhile golden-age noirs were generally more concerned with shootings than up-close-and-personal violence, director Richard Fleischer opted for a stunning burst of claustrophobic nastiness in his 1952 RKO B-movie The Narrow Margin. The film takes place almost entirely on a train that’s transporting a mob boss’s widow from Chicago to Los Angeles to testify in front of a grand jury. Detective Sergeant Walter Brown (Charles McGraw) is assigned to protect her from people who want her dead, an assignment that costs him his partner in the opening sequence — and the situation grows increasingly tense from there as the gangsters onboard close in.\n\nWalter knows that fellow passenger Joseph Kemp (David Clarke) is a would-be assassin and, at an opportune moment, shoves him into the men’s room for a scene that’s shockingly physical after all the cat-and-mouse intrigue leading up to it. The two men grapple on the ground, slamming heads against walls, wrapping hands around throats, and wrestling over a gun. In a particularly inspired touch, Walter, knocked over, aims a kick at Joseph that goes right at the lens, as though the camera itself were a participant in the skirmish. The tightness of the space adds to the sense of sweaty desperation, leaving nowhere to retreat — at one point, a porter opens the door, surveys the mayhem, and wisely exits. A decade later, Sean Connery and Robert Shaw would slug it out in a cramped compartment on the Orient Express in the James Bond film From Russia With Love, a scene that owes a lot to The Narrow Margin — as do so many of the other tight-quarters mêlées that followed. —A.W.\n\n13.\n\nThe Duke vs. Squire, The Quiet Man (1952)\n\nJohn Wayne just knew how to throw a punch. Paired with his tall frame, that talent — which imbued his fights with a sense of realism — had always been a way for Wayne to burnish his rugged persona. In that sense, the Duke leveled up in director John Ford’s The Quiet Man, a film set in a sleepy Irish village that was an unlikely site for an eight-minute mêlée. Wayne played retired Pittsburgh boxer Sean Thornton, who comes to the verdant countryside town of Innisfree intent on purchasing his family’s former farm before Squire (Victor McLaglen) lays claim to the property. His plans are complicated when he falls for Squire’s sister Mary (Maureen O’Hara) — and despite Sean’s vow to never fight again, his rivalry with Squire eventually escalates into an elaborately staged confrontation.\n\nIn films prior to The Quiet Man, Wayne’s fistfights were generally grave affairs. The fight against Squire, by contrast, has a lively, comedic feel that’s reinforced by a musical score featuring bubbly fiddles. After Sean and Squire’s scrap begins on a knoll, they brawl their way through haylofts and a creek before crashing into the town’s bar. Each wild swing by Wayne and McLaglen is played for escalating laughs as their fight gains onlookers, from a priest leaving someone’s deathbed to gossiping women. There’s even a guy managing the betting line. That lighthearted tone carried over into future Wayne films such as The Undefeated, Big Jake, Donovan’s Reef, and another pairing with Maureen O’Hara, McLintock!, and the roving nature of the fight set the stage for the sorts of large-scale, multilocation mêlées that are common in action movies today. —R.D.\n\n14.\n\nRichard Widmark vs. Richard Kiley, Pickup on South Street (1953)\n\nThump-thump-thump-thump-thump. That’s the sound the chin of Communist agent Joey (Richard Kiley) makes when serial pickpocket Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) drags him by the feet down a set of stairs. Director Samuel Fuller films Pickup’s climactic subway brawl with docu-like realism, following Skip as he fights the unarmed Joey all the way from inside a bathroom out into the station and eventually down onto the tracks. Fuller mixes close-ups with long and overhead shots to capture a constrained environment taken over by a fight between a foreign spy and a professional thief trying to avenge his dead friend and battered paramour.\n\nWhile plenty of films before and after Pickup feature fights on trains, Fuller’s pulp instincts and budget-conscious approach kept the intimate, intense action within the station, largely in full view of a terrified crowd. That’s why Skip’s vicious glee in dragging Joey down those stairs, and the cartoonish manner in which his head bounces off every single step, has achieved iconic status. Fuller didn’t invent the gag, but his execution is a big reason it endures in everything from Merrie Melodies to John Wick. —V.M.\n\n15.\n\nKyūzō vs. Challengers, Seven Samurai (1954)\n\nAkira Kurosawa’s samurai classic is a sort of cinematic primordial soup: The 70-year-old film has been so influential for so long that its narrative devices have basically become forms of storytelling law. You can parse out several elemental tropes from the 207-minute epic, from the climactic battle’s siege structure to the motley crew of protagonists, to, certainly, the duel between Kyūzō (Seiji Miyaguchi) and a boastful challenger, which codified a dynamic that has become all but ubiquitous in action contexts.\n\nAfter first clashing in front of a village crowd with bamboo sticks, the haughty adversary demands a rematch with real blades. “Don’t throw your life away,” Kyūzō responds. The guy insists, so the two square up again. A visual contrast forms: Kyūzō keeps his body lowered, hand on hilt. His opponent adopts a higher stance, katana overhead. They rush at each other, both delivering a single strike. There’s a brief pause for tension … and then the challenger falls to the ground in slow motion, dead. If you watch enough anime, you can probably hear the sound effect in your head: schwing! But here, the action plays out silently. The scene subtly establishes Kyūzō’s tremendous skill as a swordsman through a form of subtraction. He doesn’t need bluster or brute strength, just the right position and fluid motion. Versions of this sequence have been restaged, updated, and modified over the decades while never straying far from the fundamental stylishiness of the concept. —N.Q.\n\n16.\n\nChariot vs. Chariot, Ben-Hur (1959)\n\nThe full title of the book on which this 1959 classic is based is Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ, and accordingly, director William Wyler’s religious epic is a showcase of beefy men and death-defying stunts in the sand. Ben-Hur’s climactic chariot race is the final beatdown between the righteous and unjustly framed Judah (Charlton Heston) and his former friend, the quisling Messala (Stephen Boyd). Wyler handed the reins to his second-unit chiefs and stunt coordinators, Andrew Marton and Yakima Canutt, who were able to devote months exclusively to the sequence.\n\nThe result is a 15-minute heart-stopper during which the men are tossed around like rag dolls and whip one another at high speeds while a bloodthirsty crowd roars as other contestants get trampled. (Canutt’s son Joe, also in the family trade, found himself flying through the air during one take, landing with a minor injury; part of that mishap was incorporated into a surviving shot.) The Circus Maximus set was the largest ever built for a Hollywood production at the time, and Heston and Boyd trained intensively for the race. Heston was even fitted with special contact lenses to shield his eyes from kicked-up sand. The sequence quickly became legendary: The tactic of a villain affixing blades to his wheels during a race reappeared 19 years later in Grease, and The Phantom Menace’s pod race owes so much to Wyler’s film that George Lucas later appeared as an interview subject in a documentary about Ben-Hur’s influence. —J.H.\n\n17.\n\nSharks vs. Jets, West Side Story (1961)\n\nWhile most movie fights are choreographed, the climactic West Side Story knife battle that leads to the stabbing deaths of Riff (Russ Tamblyn) and Bernardo (George Chikiris), the respective leaders of the Jets and the Sharks, is choreographed. The style of Jerome Robbins — who directed the stage version of West Side Story and co-directed the film, a credit he retained even though his meticulous, dictatorial style got him fired midway through production — infuses this face-off with a theatricality that reminds us that, while this may be a movie musical, we’re also watching an adaptation of Shakespeare. Bodies heave in and out of the mêlée with a blend of chaos and elegance. As fists and switchblades fly, the combatants take turns invading each other’s dance spaces, leaping and jabbing with grace and athleticism. When Bernardo plunges a knife into Riff’s torso and Riff’s best friend, Tony (Richard Beymer), reflexively does the same to Bernardo, the impact of their deaths is immediate precisely because of all that movement. Suddenly, two young bodies in constant motion just stop.\n\nIt’s near impossible to estimate the impact of that fight, traces of which can be seen in everything from the music videos for Michael Jackson’s “Beat It” and “Bad,” to the horrifying stabbing that occurs when two dancers fight in Black Swan, to even the beach-off between rival Kens in Barbie. In truth, any scene that prioritizes beauty as much as brawling owes a debt to Riff and Bernardo. —Jen Chaney\n\n18.\n\nKing Kong vs. Godzilla, King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962)\n\nKing Kong and Godzilla weren’t the first monsters to have a crossover fight—Frankenstein’s monster had clashed with the Wolf Man back in 1943 — but the Eighth Wonder of the World and the King of the Monsters’ bout was a bigger deal and not just because the two kaiju towered over Atami Castle as they traded blows in the shadow of Mt. Fuji. Godzilla, making his third film appearance and first in color, had never looked better. He’d already drifted from his roots as a walking metaphor for nuclear horror and become a heavyweight lining up fights. King Kong, meanwhile, had a goofy smirk and vacant, glossy eyes, underscoring the shortcomings of using suitmation — a technique involving actors in large costumes — to animate the creatures rather than the more expensive and labor-intensive stop-motion that first brought the epic gorilla to life nearly 30 years prior.\n\nTheir appearances hardly mattered when the cameras were rolling: The actors inside the monsters’ suits threw themselves against one another with gusto, and Kong, the underdog, got an inexplicable lightning power-up as a handicap against Godzilla’s atomic breath. When the dust settled, the match was essentially a tie: The pair grappled and fell into the ocean together. Only Kong emerged, walking away in either victory or retreat. Despite persistent rumors that there were two different endings in the Japanese and U.S. releases, there’s only one — and the way it was handled foreshadowed the careful storytelling considerations that arise when you’re putting two big names with big expectations against each other. Just as the MCU’s continued existence relies on its characters rarely getting too hurt, the many future Godzilla movies with “vs.” in the title were dependent on the titan living to fight another day. —James Grebey\n\n19.\n\nSanjuro vs. Muroto, Sanjuro (1962)\n\nThe popularity of over-the-top, cartoonish blood splatter in contemporary fights is the legacy of a single faulty special effect. Sanjuro was a sequel of sorts to Kurosawa’s 1961 hit Yojimobo, and it again followed the exploits of the titular ronin played by Toshiro Mifune. Near the end of the film, Sanjuro faces off against a villain named Muroto (Tatsuya Nakadai), whom he’s been humiliating throughout the story. Having been disgraced by Sanjuro, Muroto demands a duel. Sanjuro tries to refuse, but Muroto will not relent. The two men stare into one another’s eyes, silent and still, for 30 seconds before each goes for their swords. The fight plays more like a quick-draw shootout than a sword fight; before Muroto can bring his blade down, Sanjuro has already split open his foe’s belly.\n\nAnd then: the blood geyser.\n\nKurosawa hadn’t intended for an insane explosion of blood to spout from Muroto’s torso, especially not at the end of what had been a largely bloodless drunken-master-style farce in which a rascally, irascible ronin helps a litter of samurai puppies get their act together. Then part of the blood-pack apparatus that Nakadai wore under his costume broke, expressing the entire supply of chocolate syrup and sparkling water to spray out of Nakadai’s abdomen in one burst. Kurosawa loved the outcome, so he kept it in the movie — even if it was a bit at odds with the somber rumination on the morality of violence that followed. Films less concerned with such messages would go on to employ the effect with aplomb. —Jordan Crucchiola\n\n20.\n\nJason and the Argonauts vs. Skeleton Swordsmen, Jason and the Argonauts (1963)\n\nWhen stop-motion pioneer Ray Harryhausen got a long-overdue honorary Oscar in 1992, Tom Hanks quipped that Jason and the Argonauts, not Casablanca or Citizen Kane, was “the greatest film ever made.” Harryhausen, who got his start under Willis H. O’Brien before eventually surpassing the King Kong animator, is the clear reason why the monster-filled take on the classic Greek myth is so beloved. And yet you’ve got to give credit to the actors who played Jason and his fellow sailors — they were the ones who needed to convincingly battle absolutely nothing, trusting that Harryhausen would reward their careful choreography by adding a horde of skeleton warriors to the action after the fact.\n\nThe technique wasn’t new for Harryhausen, who had already brought a single saber-wielding skeleton to life in The 7th Voyage of Sinbad five years prior. But the scale was: This time around it was seven skeletal swordsmen who were summoned to take vengeance on the men who had stolen King Aeëtes’ prized golden fleece. Jason and two of his Argonauts clamber over rocks and recoil as their blades bounce off the skeleton’s shields, the undead enemies moving with a clattering menace. In reality, the actors were just shadow fighting; Harryhausen then spent four and a half months animating 35 points of articulation across seven skeletons and matching them to the live-action footage. Nowadays, it’s hard to name an actor who hasn’t spent time covered in ping-pong balls, filming scenes that will be entirely created in CGI. Jason’s skeleton duel helped usher in that era.\n\nThe end of the scene, incidentally, used a far less labor-intensive approach: to shoot the sequence where the reanimated soldiers follow Jason, who dove off a cliff, and fall to their doom, the crew just chucked seven plaster skeletons over the edge. —J.G.\n\n21.\n\nPaul Newman vs. Wolfgang Kieling, Torn Curtain (1966)\n\nAlfred Hitchcock had been pushing the boundaries of permissible brutality in commercial cinema throughout the 1960s, first with Psycho and then The Birds — but the farmhouse confrontation in Torn Curtain was exceptionally violent even by those standards. Its participants were the rocket scientist and double agent Michael Armstrong (Paul Newman) battling his chaperone behind the Iron Curtain, East German security officer Hermann Gromek (Wolfgang Kieling), with the farmer’s wife (Carolyn Conwell) offering Armstrong an assist. In real time, with no music to render the violence abstract, we watched two attempts at strangulation, a butcher knife stabbed into a man’s collarbone and broken off, and shins cracked with the blade of a shovel. The coup de grâce is an asphyxiation by gas oven.\n\nIt was the most horrifyingly realistic fight in a Hollywood film up to that point, and you can feel its echoes in the struggles of later films — including the brawl between John McClane and Karl in Die Hard, the beatdown of Billy Batts in GoodFellas, and the opening fight in the restroom in Casino Royale — where the takeaway is that it’s much harder to kill a person than the movies generally make it seem. It occupied a queasy middle space between the thriller and the snuff film and gave rise to the kind of audience-punishing ultraviolence showcased in later auteur films by Stanley Kubrick, Brian De Palma, Martin Scorsese, and Quentin Tarantino. —M.Z.S.\n\n22.\n\nIchi vs. Akazuka, Zatoichi Challenged (1967)\n\nThe 17th installment in the Zatoichi series of films, which follows the adventures of a blind swordsman in late Edo Japan, isn’t generally discussed among the best entries in the franchise — but it does have a significant, and significantly beautiful, climactic duel. The protagonist, Ichi, played by Shintaro Katsu, gets enlisted by a dying woman to reunite her child with his artist father, Shokichi (Takao Ito). Throughout the film, Ichi has repeated run-ins with a mysterious samurai named Akazuka (Jushiro Konoe), who’s eventually revealed to be a government agent tasked with wiping out corruption. Akazuka doesn’t care that Shokichi was an unwilling participant in the criminal operation Akazuka has been tasked with eliminating —and so at the end of the movie, Ichi finds himself having to defend Shokichi from the rival samurai.\n\nAs they battle, the fighters’ approaches reflect their ideological divide. Akazuka’s technique is by the book, while Ichi, using his signature reverse sword grip, swings wildly, eventually impaling his opponent. What makes the fight so memorable is that it takes place in the falling snow — a striking aesthetic choice but one that’s key to the resolution of the battle. When circumstances during the fight leave Ichi without his sword, Akazuka’s honor prevents him from killing his unarmed foe. Instead, the wounded Akazuka declares Ichi the winner and walks away. At that point, the legendary director Kenji Misumi has the camera pan down to show the trail of blood in the snow — enough to suggest the wound Akazuka received is a mortal one. The implied off-screen demise serves as a counterpoint to the fight in Seven Samurai, in which death comes for someone before he seems to realize it. Zatoichi Challenged was remade in the U.S. in 1989 as Blind Fury with Rutger Hauer, but the chilly poetry of the final duel echoes through the finale of 1973’s Lady Snowblood as well as the Kill Bill: Volume 1 scene it inspired. —A.W.\n\n23.\n\nLee Marvin vs. Nightclub Goons, Point Blank (1967)\n\n“I’ll make this flick with you only on one condition,” star Lee Marvin told director John Boorman. He then took the original Point Blank script he’d been given and tossed it out a window. (Years later, after Mel Gibson produced and starred in Payback, a more literal adaptation of Donald E. Westlake’s Richard Stark novel The Hunter, Boorman playfully speculated that a young Gibson must have been passing by outside and caught the script.) Marvin and Boorman stayed true to their goal of throwing out the pulpy clichés of yet another hard-boiled thriller, producing instead a terse and hyperaestheticized existential action drama about Walker (Marvin), a crook who’s been cuckolded and betrayed by his partner, rampaging through Los Angeles killing his way to the top of the organization that betrayed him.\n\nBut that’s just the (very thin) plot. The real movie unfolds in the visuals, with Point Blank’s color-coded scenes, striking compositions, and canted angles contributing to an atmosphere of pop dread. There is no Miami Vice without Point Blank. There is no To Live and Die in L.A. without Point Blank. There is no Kill Bill without Point Blank. There is no John Wick without Point Blank. And the many, many films that feature a killer nightclub fight — the Collaterals and Terminators and Dark Knights — probably don’t happen without Point Blank’s nightclub fight, during which Walker visits the Movie House, a bar owned by the man who betrayed him, and is set upon by a couple of goons, all while Stu Gardner and his band sing a funky track called “Mighty Good Times” onstage.\n\nThe fight is certainly a dirty one with hair-pulling, face-clawing, and an all-time classic nut-punch; Marvin was one of the screen’s great fighters, and he’d already thrown down memorably in movies like Donovan’s Reef and The Dirty Dozen and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. What makes this scene so unforgettable is the intoxicating, swirling imagery: the images being projected on the screens around Walker, the pop-jazz score filled with yelps and screams (which stand in for the cries of our hero’s victims), the shining bikini-clad dancers, even the rhythmic editing, which turns the fight itself into something of a dance. —B.E.\n\n24.\n\nButch’s Foot vs. Harvey’s Nuts, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)\n\nIf Point Blank’s crotch shot was part of an ensemble, the one unleashed by Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman, still violent) was the star. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was influential not just for its sexy lead actors, hippie irreverence, and lyrical montage scored to Burt Bacharach’s “Raindrops Keep Fallin’ on My Head” but also for the scene where Butch thwarted a challenge to his authority as leader of the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang by booting his adversary, the much larger Harvey Logan (Ted Cassidy, a.k.a. Lurch on the original The Addams Family), right in the ’nads.\n\nThe text of William Goldman’s screenplay asks the reader to imagine “the most aesthetically exquisite kick in the balls in the history of the modern American cinema,” and that’s what director George Roy Hill delivered, right down to the puff of dust as Butch’s foot connects. The sheer surprise of it guaranteed laughs and led to a normalization of groin punishment in mainstream cinema that accelerated through the 1970s and ’80s; it hit what seemed like a slapstick zenith in the Home Alone series, only to be outdone by the masochistic stunt performers of Jackass. While that alone would have secured the Butch Cassidy nut-kick’s place in history, it enjoys a secondary legacy as an early example of a move that ends a fight as soon as it starts: A line can be traced directly from Newman’s foot to Harrison Ford’s pistol as his Indiana Jones wearily shoots a scimitar-wielding foe in Raiders of the Lost Ark. —M.Z.S.\n\n25.\n\nYang Hui-zhen vs. Mun Ta, A Touch of Zen (1971)\n\nKing Hu’s ethereal wuxia films, drawn from Chinese literature and pulsing with the mysteries of the natural world, were made before wirework acrobatics became a key feature of Hong Kong action cinema. In his chef d’oeuvre, A Touch of Zen, Hu stages a transcendent sword fight in a foggy bamboo forest — this iconic face-off between fugitive noblewoman Yang Hui-zhen (Hsu Feng) and her swordsmen and the bodyguards of the evil eunuch Mun Ta would be paid homage by a number of contemporary martial-arts movies like Ang Lee’s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Thanks to choreographer Han Yingjie, a former Beijing opera actor, A Touch of Zen’s ancient warriors look more like wondrous floating ballerinas than gritty scrappers with the actors gracefully leaping through the foliage using hidden mini-trampolines. Hu employed long tracking shots and dynamic jump cuts to create a dramatic, almost spiritual sense of rhythm, while the pitter-patter of racing feet, the bright clang of weapons, and the swish of bodies rushing through the foliage imparts a musical effect not unlike the pleasures of ASMR. The fight, contrary to expectation, draws its power from its sustained tension as much as its sudden attacks — think of the exquisite serenity of Hou Hsiao-Hsien’s The Assassin or the anticlimax of Kill Bill: Volume II. These movies absorbed the lessons offered by Zen’s heavenly fighters: There is magic in stillness. — Beatrice Loayza\n\n26.\n\nSuper Fly vs. the Crooked Cop, Super Fly (1972)\n\nThe blaxploitation era began before 1972’s Super Fly, but the term wasn’t really used before Super Fly, which outraged and delighted millions with its story about a drug dealer (and, notably, drug user) looking to make one big score before bowing out of the life. The genre made history by presenting Black characters who could be the protagonists of their own stories without being relegated to comic-relief, victim, or sidekick parts. Plus they got to win in the end. And one of the elements that makes Gordon Parks Jr.’s bracingly amoral thriller special is that we don’t really know if Youngblood Priest (Ron O’Neal) will make it. O’Neal’s melancholy performance suggests a doomed man. The fact that the cops — who are also the drug suppliers — seem to be closing in on him over the course of the film would suggest that he’s in for a tragic comeuppance.\n\nBut what’s this? In the very final scene, Priest is confronted by Deputy Commissioner Reardon (Sig Shore), who also happens to be the local drug supplier, and his men. And he then proceeds to kung fu–kick the henchmen’s asses in an extended slow-motion sequence that gains in grace what it lacks in budget. (It also echoes the film’s earlier, very memorable bathtub-lovemaking scene.) Priest tells the commissioner that he’s taken out a mob contract on him and that the man and his whole family will be killed if anything happens to him. (“Nothing — nothing — better happen to one hair on my gorgeous head. Can you dig it?”) Then he walks away, gets in a car, and drives off. The end! Super Fly gets away! Even in the revolutionary, table-turning world of blaxploitation, this was something new. —B.E.\n\n27.\n\nPam Grier vs. the Girls, Coffy (1973)\n\nIn action cinema, there is Before Pam Grier and After Pam Grier. And although Coffy was not Grier’s debut — it wasn’t even her first film with noted B-movie maestro Jack Hill — it was the picture that cemented her star status and persona. In Hill’s 1973 hit, Grier plays the titular ER nurse–slash–angel of vengeance looking to take revenge on the dealers and crooks and pimps who destroyed her younger sister’s life. To do so, she goes undercover with local pimp King George, pretending to be an aspiring Jamaican sex worker. She’s so alluring that the other girls in King George’s employ immediately hate her. After the other prostitutes humiliate Coffy during a party, she returns the favor by dumping a bowl of salad on one of them and then initiating a massive mêlée among the girls, all while the men in the room watch in astonishment and delight.\n\nWomen beating the crap out of each other was not novel in movies by this point; catfights had become popular in the world of porn and exploitation flicks over the previous several decades, and there was even one in the Bond flick From Russia With Love. But this particular catfight is not only spectacular, it’s also a genuine action scene that points the way toward the future, as the film basically stops to treat us to some thundering wrestling moves and dresses flying open to reveal bare breasts everywhere. It has the trappings of titillation, but like much of Coffy, it turns the tables on the viewer: This stuff looks like it hurts. Especially with the final, bloody coup de grâce: As her nemesis reaches for Coffy’s head, the girl discovers, much to her screaming chagrin, that our hero hid razor blades in her hair. —B.E.\n\n28.\n\nBruce Lee vs. O’Hara, Enter the Dragon (1973)\n\nLots of modern action movies are ultimately defeated by their stars’ egos. When the Rock contractually can’t lose a fight, there’s not much at stake — sooner or later, he just shrugs off his enemy’s feeble blows. So why is it that, despite easily defeating every goon he trades blows with, watching Bruce Lee fight in Enter the Dragon is so transfixing?\n\nLee plays a Hong Kong martial artist (also named Lee) whom British Intelligence has recruited to go undercover to help take down Han (Kien Shih), a secretive crime lord who is hosting a tournament on his island lair. Lee accepts, partially because Han’s right-hand man, O’Hara (Robert Wall), is responsible for his sister’s death. So when Lee and O’Hara face off in the competition, you’d be forgiven for expecting a close match. Instead, O’Hara doesn’t land a single blow on Lee, who deftly dodges and counters with punch after punch, kick after kick. When an embarrassed O’Hara breaks a bottle in an underhanded attempt to kill his opponent, Lee effortlessly disarms his hateful foe, knocking him on his back. Then, in a moment that’s as cathartic as it is ugly, he leaps onto O’Hara for a killing blow. We don’t see O’Hara’s body break, but we hear pained horror in Lee’s furious scream. It’s not an issue, dramatically, that O’Hara never stood a chance; the real fight was always with the dragon inside Lee.\n\nTragically, Lee, the martial-arts prodigy who created his own fighting style and helped kung fu movies break through in the West, died unexpectedly six days before Enter the Dragon’s premiere. A subgenre of “Bruceploitation” movies attempted to fill the void he left behind with knockoff Hong Kong action flicks that tried to mimic his unique talents and appeal. Nothing could match Lee, of course, and that’s still the case today. —J.G.\n\n29.\n\nHarvey Keitel’s Crew vs. George Memmoli’s Crew, Mean Streets (1973)\n\n“What’s a mook?” The pool-hall fight scene in Martin Scorsese’s third feature, Mean Streets, is the lodestar of his entire cinematic language. First, you got your Noo Yawk tough guys being inadvertently funny as they puff out their chests during an ill-fated mob collection. Second, you got your shocking, almost unmotivated explosion of violence. Sure, these guys don’t like each other, but what really is it that sets them off? Not knowing what the word mook means? Finally, the kiss of genius is the revolutionary use of pop music that doesn’t quite fit and therefore fits perfectly. In this case, it’s because the girls in the back of the bar — or as Robert De Niro’s Johnny Boy calls them, “the skanks” — put the Marvelettes’ version of “Please Mr. Postman” on the jukebox. (Later Scorsese needle-drops won’t bother with in-world rationales.)\n\nWild acts of violence set to a peppy tune had no precedent in movies and is now so commonplace we hardly chuckle when a whiff of a picture like Argylle offers the gag up several times. Scorsese’s decision to go handheld during the mayhem, still something of a rarity in narrative films, adds even more electricity. With Harvey Keitel and George Memmoli’s crews going at each other, as De Niro climbs atop a pool table with quick cuts to show the madness in his eyes, it all seems unrehearsed, but that’s part of the magic. The best are the additional guys sprinkled throughout the joint, holding onto their cues, not takin’ no sides in any of dis. —J.H.\n\n30.\n\nKing Arthur vs. the Black Knight, Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975)\n\n“’Tis but a scratch!” For 50 years, nerds have had a rallying cry for every time they injure themselves, thanks to the preposterous (and surprisingly profitable) string of loosely connected, mostly medieval sketches that make up Monty Python and the Holy Grail. In this memorable sequence, King Arthur (Graham Chapman) witnesses the Black Knight (John Cleese) “fight with the strength of many men” at a pas d’armes, then invites him to “join me in my court at Camelot.” (Yes, yes, I’ve got most of the dialogue in this nerd Rosetta Stone committed to memory.) The Black Knight not only refuses the invitation but prevents him from crossing his bridge: “None shall pass!” It leads to a battle in which high chivalry (“Good sir Knight”) turns to name-calling (“You’re a loony”) as we realize that the Black Knight isn’t exactly holding the sharpest sword.\n\nWith a thud, Arthur lops off an arm as some cheapo red paint squirts through a not-very-state-of-the-art tube. The sequence devolves into absurdity as the Black Knight denies reality, unwilling to accept that he keeps losing his limbs. By the end of the bit, he’s just a torso on the ground, still threatening Arthur with his doom. (“What are you gonna do, bleed on me?” Chapman zings back.) The never-say-die-but-clearly-defeated Black Knight has become shorthand for clueless politicians or anyone out of touch. And the copious amounts of gore met with nonchalance has a long-standing comedy legacy — heck, it’s a full third of Rick & Morty’s gags. But the bit actually has its roots in history. John Cleese has said the idea came from a professor’s lecture about a Greek wrestler who technically never lost his match because he died before the challenger could win. “I always thought this was a very dodgy conclusion, but it stuck in my mind for years,” he mused. —J.H.\n\n31.\n\nJai and Veeru vs. the Bandits, Sholay (1975)\n\nConsidered a “curry western,” i.e., a Hindi take on the western genre, Sholay borrows from masters of the form. It invokes Sergio Leone’s penchant for gore, Anthony Mann’s morality mechanics, and the character building of Akira Kurosawa’s Yojimbo and Seven Samurai. Its release marked the first time screenwriters were ever listed on a movie poster; Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar became rock stars overnight, partly thanks to the zingy one-liners peppered throughout the fight scenes, an approach that eventually became industry standard. And though its co-lead Amitabh Bachchan was known pre-Sholay for his fighting chops, the film — and the way Bachchan used his lanky body to swiftly slice through space — cemented his legend as one of the deftest action heroes of all time.\n\nThe opening fight scene is tightly structured, lasting under nine minutes. Inspector Baldev Singh (Sanjeev Kumar) is transporting two handcuffed thieves to a police station when their train gets attacked by bandits on horseback. The thieves, Jai (Bachchan) and Veeru (Dharmendra), offer to help, so Singh frees them and they spring into action. The ensuing battle sees Jai running across the top of a moving train, sniping bandits, then fighting them hand-to-hand when they make it onto the caboose. Bachchan and Dharmendra complement each other perfectly: Jai’s fighting style is calm, collected, nimble, while Veeru is more of a whizbang-smash type, dealing savage punches and strangling bad guys.\n\nThe violence of Sholay, loudly and proudly announced in this first fight scene, indicated a shift in Hindi cinema. While films of the 1950s and ’60s considered violence an unnecessary tool, Sholay — released amid the political crises of the 1970s, when rampant corruption, poverty, and unemployment awakened a generation to the notion that their government was never set up to support everyone — embraced feudal tribalism and retributive justice. The Hindi film industry soon saw a rise in films about violence and gangsters, and Bachchan would go on to star in many films that rejected gentility. —Nandini Balial\n\n32.\n\nApollo vs. Rocky, Rocky (1976)\n\nSix years before a little-known Hollywood day player named Sylvester Stallone became a bona fide action star in Rambo, he made the sports movie to end all sports movies: Rocky. Inspired by the story of retired pugilist Chuck Wepner, Stallone wrote the script as a star vehicle for himself about an underworld enforcer and boxing chump from Philadelphia given a once-in-a-lifetime chance to fight the heavyweight champion of the world, Apollo Creed (the late, great Carl Weathers). As the haughty showman Creed puts it, the opportunity is a metaphor for the American Dream: Work hard and someday your desires will be recognized too.\n\nThe film’s uplifting Creed-vs.-Rocky showdown relies on sturdy, well-tested visual principles: Take how the giant poster of Apollo looms deep in the compositions of the scene, projecting the immense odds Rocky faces. Americana iconography like the flag, the blue and starry boxing mat, and the ringside women costumed as silver Statues of Liberty further heighten the symbolism. For the first half of the scene, director John G. Avildsen withholds any music — allowing the ambience of the announcers, the crowd, and the punches to build — until halfway through, a foreboding bell speeds us into the final, decisive round. Avildsen shoots mostly from outside the ring, from the vantage point of a spectator, relying on the ropes to frame the action. The charm of Rocky is how superfluous the final round is: Rocky simply surviving is a win, and his love Adrian (Talia Shire) jumping into his arms is his title belt.\n\nRocky immediately inspired other working-class underdog films, from Flashdance and Footloose all the way to King Richard. And its visual storytelling, like the iconic training montage, along with its interest in social themes like poverty, alcoholism, and mental health, provided a template for inspirational sports movies to become progressively grittier and more heartbreaking, as seen with The Fighter and Warrior. —R.D.\n\n33.\n\nBruce Lee vs. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Game of Death (1978)\n\nFirst, the suit. Bruce Lee’s yellow-black jumpsuit is one of the more recognizable symbols associated with his legend, which Quentin Tarantino would memorialize even further via homage as Beatrix Kiddo’s battle fit of choice in Kill Bill: Volume I. You’ve definitely seen it before, and it never fails to look incredible.\n\nBut that legacy runs parallel to the most memorable fight in Lee’s last film, released posthumously, where he faces off with NBA legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. At the time well on his way to crossover stardom, Abdul-Jabbar wasn’t the first professional athlete to rumble in an action flick, but there’s an unimpeachable cool to his appearance that continues to loom over the rich tradition of stunt cameos. The signature idea of the matchup revolves around the stark height disparity, with the seven-foot-two Abdul-Jabbar towering over the five-foot-eight Lee, but what’s interesting here is how Abdul-Jabbar only marginally uses his size. This is not Boban Marjanović fully palming Keanu Reeves’s head in John Wick 3. Rather, Abdul-Jabbar, who as a UCLA student had trained with Lee, squares off against his martial-arts teacher as a stylistic equal. He moves with alacrity, throwing quick punches and even deploying a succession of high kicks against Lee.\n\nThe fight is technical and long, and it ends with Lee getting the upper hand after an exhausting struggle when he traps his adversary in a headlock. It’s an iconic fade-out for Abdul-Jabbar, whose demise is visually communicated by his hand letting go of velvet bedsheets after violently clinging on for life. You’ve likely seen iterations of that choke-out hundreds of times, and the next time you see Daniel Craig headlock that baddie in Casino Royale, think of those sweet velvet sheets. —N.Q.\n\n34.\n\nJames Bond vs. Jaws, Moonraker (1979)\n\nMoonraker might not be the greatest James Bond film, but it does have what was one of the most dazzling stunt sequences ever achieved up to that time, a scene that inspired many, many imitators. Right at the start, Roger Moore’s Bond is pushed out of a small airplane by Richard Kiel’s Jaws, one of the chief baddies in the previous film, The Spy Who Loved Me. Plummeting through the air, Bond propels himself over to the pilot of the plane, who’s already jumped out with a parachute, and wrestles the chute from the man. But then, the behemoth Jaws appears again, this time zooming through the air, determined to kill 007 once and for all. The two struggle in the sky until Bond emerges victorious and Jaws lands onto a circus tent and becomes animated collateral for the picture’s opening Shirley Bassey–scored credit sequence.\n\nIn the years to come, we’d get similar scenes in Point Break, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, and assorted Fast and Furious movies, but up until Moonraker, nobody had ever seen a fight quite like this one. Indeed, when executive producer Michael Wilson suggested the idea to his father-in-law and longtime Bond producer Albert R. Broccoli, he was told it was impossible. But Wilson sought out aerial stunt coordinator Don Caltvedt and cameraman Rande DeLuca to see how it might be achieved.\n\nIt took some doing. They had to modify existing equipment because the lightweight helmet cams required to film something like this would not shoot 35-mm. or take the Panavision lenses required for a Bond movie. The filmmakers also had to create thin parachutes that could be hidden under clothing to make it look like Bond was plummeting through the air without a chute. And then they had to practice actual fight choreography in the skies so that what was onscreen wouldn’t look soft or fake. What’s most impressive (and inspiring) about the scene is that very little of it is done with special effects. Yes, there are a couple of janky close-ups of Kiel and Moore (which really do stick out), but for much of the scene, we’re looking into the faces of stunt doubles Jake Lombard (playing Bond) and Ron Luginbill (playing Jaws) — which tells us that we are watching actual humans doing all this. —B.E.\n\n35.\n\nLupin III vs. Cagliostro, The Castle of Cagliostro (1979)\n\nIf the name Hayao Miyazaki only means “Ghibli tears” and weird little guys to you, surprise: He’s a gifted action director, too. Animators at American schools like CalArts and even staff at studios like Disney and DreamWorks study the action and editing of his movies for good reason: They’re precisely timed to capture the weight, movement, and forms of his characters. Try freeze-framing on one of his action scenes, and you’ll likely find a still that conveys motion all on its own. And the action in Miyazaki’s films always serves the story, as Genndy Tartakovsky, the director of animated action titles like Samurai Jack and Primal, points out. “There’s that scene in Princess Mononoke where you follow the arrow …” and the arrow chops off a samurai’s arms, pinning them to a tree before the shot quickly cuts away. “He doesn’t linger on it,” Tartakovsky says.\n\nYou can see Miyazaki’s knack for action as far back as his first feature, The Castle of Cagliostro. Its climax pits gentleman thief Arsène Lupin III against the dastardly Count Lazare de Cagliostro, with their rivalry culminating in a sweeping duel — the Count with a rapier, Lupin with a giant wrench — inside of the titular castle’s clock tower. The scene is a master class of animation timing: In addition to striking, parrying, and dodging each other’s swings, the two combatants also dangle, spin, run backward then forward, and avoid getting crushed or falling to their deaths. Miyazaki pays diligent attention to how the physics work (and the castle itself remains a feat of animated architecture), but chooses to ignore them in favor of action comedy — it’s like Buster Keaton crossed with Tex Avery.\n\nTartakovsky says both The Castle of Cagliostro and Miyazaki’s work on the Lupin III television series influenced his own acclaimed action animation, and notes the clarity of Miyazaki’s storyboarding. The clock-tower scene also helped shape Disney’s The Great Mouse Detective, which ended with a similar showdown (assisted by computerized animation techniques). That film in turn served as a forerunner to Disney’s ambitiously action-packed ’90s films like The Lion King, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and Hercules. Rumor has it that Steven Spielberg once called The Castle of Cagliostro “one of the greatest adventure movies of all time.” While that quote has never been verified (despite being put on the Cagliostro DVD cover), one of the filmmaker’s own swashbuckling adventures also ends with a duel and a clock tower crumbling on the villain. —E.V.B.\n\n36.\n\nThe Warriors vs. the Baseball Furies, The Warriors (1979)\n\nSome scenes are influential simply because they look really cool. Among the various gangs in Walter Hill’s The Warriors, the Baseball Furies are easy standouts: Their painted faces and matching pinstripe uniforms make them seem eerie and familiar, like if the Yankees decided to quit pro ball in order to properly raise hell on the streets. (The Furies also make a perennially great Halloween costume that will appeal to cult-film fans everywhere.) But when the Furies chase the Warriors into Riverside Park, it’s time for them to take their licks. Swan (Michael Beck), Ajax (James Remar), Snow (Brian Tyler), and Cowboy (Tom McKitterick) might be outnumbered by the baseball hooligans, but the pure-of-heart Warriors prove that fists and mettle can overcome any crack of the bat.\n\nHill shoots the fight scene(s) between the Warriors and the Furies like an ungainly dance, a realistic maneuver considering the participants are all young, self-taught fighters with excess bravado and aggression. Swan utilizes a nifty two-handed punch to knock out the first Fury, but mostly the Warriors evade their swing, wait to get the drop on them, and then use their own bats against them. (At one point, Swan and a Fury use their bats like swords, with knocks of wood standing in for clashes of metal.) It’s a relatively simple scene elevated by the real-life location and Barry de Vorzon heavy-synth score, but in one fell swoop, Hill subverted the West Side Story playbook and rewrote it for a grittier age. —V.M.\n\n37.\n\nLuke vs. Darth Vader, The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\n\nOther lightsaber duels in the Star Wars films are more acrobatic (sometimes absurdly so; see Yoda versus Count Dooku in Attack of the Clones), but none is as dramatically powerful as the confrontation between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader in The Empire Strikes Back. Their face-off fuses the time-honored swashbuckling combo of fighting and repartee with science-fiction elements, including energy swords, telekinesis, a labyrinth of steam-shrouded metal corridors, and a carbon-freezing pit that had previously trapped Luke’s pal Han Solo. Screenwriters Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan masterfully set up the climatic moment where Vader lops off Luke’s hand, urges him to switch sides so that they can “end this destructive conflict” between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance, and drops the often-imitated, never equaled bombshell, “I am your father.”\n\nIt’s the buildup that makes the line hit so hard. Though fragmented by crosscutting to other scenes of action, it’s the most elegant and impactful of all lightsaber battles. Creator-producer George Lucas, director Irvin Kershner, and their collaborators aren’t going pedal-to-the-metal. They let Vader dominate while giving Luke several table-turning moments of improvisation and alternate loud and soft stretches (there’s even a jump scare with Vader lunging at Luke from somewhere out of frame). The revelation itself has been parodied in everything from Spaceballs to Rugrats. And the overall structure of the scene — a long, gradually escalating confrontation that climaxes with a mind-blowing new piece of information — has been mimicked in films as varied as Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, The Matrix, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. —M.Z.S.\n\n38.\n\nJake vs. Sugar Ray, Raging Bull (1980)\n\n“You never got me down, Ray,” Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro) says menacingly at the end of his fifth and final bout with Sugar Ray Robinson (Johnny Barnes). Though Jake initially throws a few good punches, the majority of the fight is one-sided with Jake acting like a masochistic punching bag. Before his walloping, however, Ray pauses for a brief second only for Jake to shake his head like it weighs 1,000 pounds and beg Ray for more punishment. They square off against each other — Jake goading him on, Ray holding back to catch his breath — as the roar of the crowd softens in the mix; for a brief moment, the two stare at each other with mutual understanding if not subtle respect. But then Ray takes a step forward, the crowd noise comes back with full force, and Jake takes the kind of beating he’ll be fielding again and again for the rest of his life.\n\nBoxing pictures were a staple of classical Hollywood cinema, mirroring the rise of the sport itself in the 20th century. While there have been notable boxing films after Raging Bull (Ali, The Fighter, Creed), and with all respect to Sylvester Stallone and Apollo vs. Rocky, the final battle between Jake and Sugar Ray possibly reflects the apotheosis of the genre. Director Martin Scorsese shoots the fight like a murder; he even takes explicit cues from the shower scene in Psycho. (His longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker similarly emphasizes the violent aftermath of each punch instead of the hit itself.) Crucially, every shot outside the ring carries the horror of spectatorship, indicting the audience within and outside the film, made literal by blood splashing on the judges. Cinematographer Michael Chapman’s use of slow motion reaches its peak when he frames Ray’s devastating overhand punch like it’s a judgment from God. Only Jake doesn’t see it that way. All he can say, with his battered face and twisted smile, is that he didn’t go down. The blood on the ropes, however, tells a different story. —V.M.\n\n39.\n\nDarryl vs. Cameron, Scanners (1981)\n\nWith Scanners, his movie about psychics being recruited by or going to war against a private military company, David Cronenberg demonstrated that a fight could be intensely physical even when the opponents aren’t in direct contact. Darryl Revok (Michael Ironside) exploding the head of a corporate “scanner” (a psychic, played by Louis Del Grande) may be the movie’s most indelible image, but that’s less an altercation than an act of terror. The showdown between Darryl and Cameron Vale (Stephen Lack) at the end of the movie, though? That’s an honest-to-God duel to the death between two siblings who were mutated by experimental drugs as children, and it’s rendered in such visceral detail that it’s more disturbing than any direct carnage. For Scanners, the psychic is the physical to the point where the conflict kicks off with Cameron whacking Darryl on the head with a statuette before the real battle begins. Veins bulge and bleed along Lack’s arms and then do the same on the side of Ironside’s head as his face contorts with effort. Fluids erupt, boiling, from beneath their skin. Flesh warps and splits. And in the final stages of the fight, Cameron bursts into flames, his eyeballs exploding, while Darryl’s go entirely white. The movie’s influence is everywhere, but no more directly than in Stranger Things, in which Eleven’s powers have a far less gruesome, but still bloody, bodily effect. —A.W.\n\n40.\n\nGordon Liu vs. Wang Lung-wei, Martial Club (1981)\n\nYou can’t overstate the importance of the Shaw Brothers — Runje, Runme, Runde, and, later, Run Run — in developing East and Southeast Asian film culture, let alone kung fu flicks. Their influence largely arose from the sheer tonnage of product they pumped into those regions beginning in the 1920s, and though they were already facing heavy competition in the ’70s from rival Golden Harvest, the production company that was instrumental in exporting Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan beyond Asia, you can still see the Shaw Brothers’ fingerprints all over the kung fu genre.\n\nMartial Club isn’t necessarily thought to be the best of the Shaw Brothers’ works, but it is among the most representative of what their productions typically look like. Directed by Lau Kar-leung, a staple talent of the studio, there’s barely a plot supporting the movie’s premise, which sees rival martial-arts schools converging on a small town to boogie down. But it’s not like you need much of a story anyway to showcase an array of incredible fights, including this standout alleyway battle between Gordon Liu, Lau’s half-brother and frequent collaborator who reprises the role of the totemic Wong Fei-hung, and Wang Lung-wei, who in this film bucks against his usual casting as a villain. The duel’s conceit lies in the alley being barely three feet wide. That constraint forces both men to fluidly move between quick strikes and effective positioning. The tight space even offers them a sense of verticality, as they’re able to wedge themselves upward to gain a height advantage. And, of course, because we’re talking about guys whose punches are like cannonballs, they end up blasting a ton of holes through walls (hilariously revealed to be made out of softer material, if you squint hard enough). It’s a funny, furious, and ferociously technical affair. In other words, it’s trademark Shaw Brothers stuff. —N.Q.\n\n41.\n\nKing Arthur vs. Mordred, Excalibur (1981)\n\nThe final confrontation between King Arthur (Nigel Terry) and his evil illegitimate son Mordred (Robert Addie) in John Boorman’s Excalibur — the best cinematic adaptation of the Arthurian myth — breaks all the rules of what makes a great action sequence. Usually, fight scenes are about clarity with clean compositions graduating into sharp cuts as bodies move in combat. Boorman sets his great battle between two armies in a fog-ridden forest, where the combatants are barely visible, even in their polished suits of armor. Arthur and Mordred’s forces are in this death trap because Mordred, the result of an incestuous affair between Arthur and his shape-shifting sister Morgana Le Fay, wants his father’s crown. Arthur, meanwhile, knows he must murder Mordred if he is to free his kingdom of the plague that Mordred’s birth unleashed.\n\nThe forest scene is a chaotic mesh of blurred bodies, broken limbs, and gnarly screams, marked by the clanking of swords and the strains of “O Fortuna.” These vicious silhouettes in the fog are not balletic; they are rugged and forceful. When Arthur and Mordred, the latter bedecked in gold armor, do meet at the center of the carnage, it is short: “Come father, let us embrace at last,” says Mordred. He plunges a spear into Arthur, and Arthur’s sword pierces Mordred in return. It’s a mutual death whose tragic, self-sacrificing quality was retooled in Zack Snyder’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, in which Superman stabs and kills a monster genetically engineered from his own DNA and dies from the wound the monster inflicts on him in return. —R.D.\n\n42.\n\nDeckard vs. Pris’s Thighs, Blade Runner (1982)\n\nBefore Blade Runner, Harrison Ford usually won his fights. In Star Wars, Han Solo shot first; in Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones proved that all the fancy sword-swinging in the world can’t stop a bullet. In Ridley Scott’s 1982 sci-fi classic, though, Ford’s Deckard gets his ass kicked all over Los Angeles by the Nexus-6 replicants he’s tasked with hunting down. The film’s finale, in which the exhausted Deckard is terrorized and then saved by Rutger Hauer’s replicant leader Roy Batty, is the film’s most moving fight with Batty’s savagery and humanity in perfect equilibrium. But it’s Deckard’s earlier showdown with Daryl Hannah’s Pris in genetic designer J.F. Sebastian’s apartment that had the greater impact on action specifically. The fight is only a minute or so long, but extremes amplify the scene’s brutality. Wide shots of Pris leaping, cartwheeling, and twisting around the room like an Olympian gymnast show off the alienness of her physicality, while tight frames on her and Deckard’s faces as she crushes his head between her thighs communicate her femininity as a means of attack. There’s no score here, so all we hear are Pris’s bansheelike screams, the slap of her and Deckard’s limbs hitting each other, and then the booming, inorganic sound of his gunshot ripping through her.\n\nThere’s an irony to how Ford’s previous characters rely on guns to get the better of their opponents — those moments are meant to convey Ford’s cool-guy qualities. But in Blade Runner, Deckard shooting to kill the replicants is treated with a little bit of shame, a sign of his inability to hold his own against the “more human than human.” Pris’s seizurelike death scene is an agonizing, drawn-out affair, but her unnerving athleticism and disarming sexuality have birthed cinematic daughters like the horny-for-death Xenia Onatopp in GoldenEye and slinky badass Mystique in the first X-Men films; she helped make the thigh-crush the staple finishing move it is now for female action stars. —Roxana Hadadi\n\n43.\n\nJackie Chan vs. Benny ‘the Jet’ Urquidez, Wheels on Meals (1984)\n\nJackie Chan, breathing heavily, bruised and bloodied, at the end of his rope. It’s an image we’ve seen countless times now, though it had never been captured on film before 1984’s Meals on Wheels, a slapstick riot directed by Sammo Hung that eventually descends into a violent, bone-crunching affair. By then, Chan was already an established superstar in Hong Kong. But his meeting with kickboxer Benny “the Jet” Urquidez feels like a turning point in Chan’s ascent from domestic fame to international megastardom.\n\nDuring the film’s climactic raid on the villains’ castle, Chan and his two “brothers,” played by Hung and Yuen Biao, split off to each take on a henchman. Sammo and Yuen hold their own in their fights, but there’s something immediately striking about Urquidez. His kicks land like freight trains, and his punches seem to flash faster than light. It’s the first time you ever catch yourself whispering, “I don’t think Jackie can win this one.” They fly around the dining room, flipping atop furniture. In one spellbinding moment, Jackie ducks a kick so powerful and quick it blows out the candles on the table. What makes this fight truly remarkable, though, is watching Jackie turn from goofball to coldblooded badass with each strike to the nose. Urquidez hits him once, and Chan mocks him. He hits him again, and Chan’s rattled but keeps his sense of humor. It’s only when his face is on the precipice of being smashed in that our hero finally realizes the danger here: He’s met his match, and it’s time to stop having a laugh. Jackie on the brink became the star’s bread and butter, and it’s here, in one of the best fights of his career, that we see pain unlock a man possessed. He’d perfect this routine in Drunken Master II, but never forget it was the Jet who first wiped that megawatt smile off his face. —B.S.\n\n44.\n\nNick vs. Nigel, Top Secret! (1984)\n\nWatch enough action movies and you start to recognize the rhythms of a fight. Sure, a cowboy brawl in a dusty saloon can be a hoot and a holler, but it can also be mere cliché. Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and David Zucker (collectively known as ZAZ, the comedy team behind Airplane) leaned into this familiarity for the climax of Top Secret!, a movie filled with gags so sublimely stupid that they loop back around to pure brilliance.\n\nBy the main characters’ own admission, the plot of Top Secret! “sounds like some bad movie.” A young Val Kilmer plays Nick Rivers, an Elvis stand-in who travels to East Germany on an espionage mission seemingly borrowed from a cheesy WWII flick. When attempting to best the resistance leader turned traitor Nigel and save his gal, Nick falls from a moving car into a river, taking Nigel with him. Their fight continues underwater, where their slowed aquatic punches instantly give way to outright absurdity. Nigel inexplicably grabs a stool and breaks it over Nick. Nick retaliates by throwing Nigel against a fully stocked bar that’s appeared out of nowhere, and a bubbly bartender pops up to break a bottle over Nigel’s head. A chandelier falls from the ceiling (?), a quartet of cowboys playing poker hit the aquatic deck, and Nick ends the fight by punching Nigel through a window and making a heroic exit through swinging saloon doors. The whole fight — which was actually filmed underwater, each shot lasting 10 to 15 seconds while the actors held their breath — makes an utter mockery of western tropes. Lots of films since have done the same, but perhaps none more joyously than this one. —J.G.\n\n45.\n\nDaniel vs. Johnny, The Karate Kid (1984)\n\nTeen movies in the 1980s often included a scene in which an unpopular outcast triumphs over popular normies. But few had as much lasting impact as the All Valley Karate Championship–deciding fight between skinny outsider Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) and obnoxious bully Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka). When John Kreese (Martin Kove), Johnny’s brutish sensei whose mantra is “No mercy,” advises Johnny to “sweep the leg,” it seems inevitable that an already injured Daniel is about to go down. But Daniel-san, only capable of putting weight on one foot at this point, is determined to win, something he miraculously does after successfully deploying the crane-kick maneuver his much more peaceful sensei, Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita), taught him.\n\nDirector John G. Avildsen, who previously directed the first Rocky, also on this list, understood exactly how to calibrate the emotional journey of a scrappy Northeast underdog training for a big match. Pat E. Johnson, The Karate Kid’s fight coordinator, was not only a gifted martial artist himself; he had previously appeared in the influential Enter the Dragon alongside Bruce Lee, whose own skill with a high kick no doubt influenced Daniel LaRusso’s. (Fun fact: Johnson also referees the final fight between Daniel and Johnny.) This sequence captures the kind of contradictory moralizing that was typical of the era — be peaceful, unless and until you need to kick a preppy jerk in the head. But it sincerely makes us cheer for Daniel and every tormented kid who’s ever dreamed of fighting back. That’s why it resonated then and still resonates so much that there have been multiple Karate Kid sequels, a remake, and a TV reboot called Cobra Kai, starring Macchio and Zabka as adult versions of the same characters, not to mention numerous homages to the move in other media (Teen Titans Go!, Kung Fu Panda, the Street Fighter video-game franchise). None would be the same if Daniel hadn’t mustered the strength to deliver one swift crane kick to Johnny’s skull. —Chaney\n\n46.\n\nGordon Liu vs. the Coffin Crew, The Eight Diagram Pole Fighter (1984)\n\nConsider the staff, a common instrument in Chinese martial arts: You can use it to strike an assailant, control crowds with wide sweeps, and even get yourself out of trouble by vaulting your body into higher areas. In The Eight Diagram Pole Fighter, another Shaw Brothers entry, studio mainstay Gordon Liu plays a warrior who breaks from monastic pacifism to rescue his sister and avenge his family, most of which was killed early in the movie owing to the machinations of an evil general. Because he once sought refuge in a Buddhist monastery, his means for revenge is the titular pole wedded with a holistic combat philosophy. What he does with it echoes throughout action cinema, whether it’s Jackie Chan with the bamboo stick in Drunken Master II or even Darth Maul’s space-clearing with the double-sided lightsaber.\n\nProminent for its emphasis on weapons, The Eight Diagram Pole Fighter is a prototypical revenge flick that adheres to the usual arc of the subgenre: betrayal, training, climax. And boy, what a fun climax it offers. The sequence starts out with an outnumbered Liu tasked with both protecting his sister (Kara Hui), who spends a good chunk of the battle tied to his back, and fending off waves of assailants. True to the Shaw Brothers, the fight bounces between chaos, choreography, and comedy. (There’s also a shocking amount of dental violence.) Liu gets to illustrate the full potential of the pole against enemies armed with all sorts of weapons: swords, spears, even a kind of staff that can curl around limbs. That last tool leads to a splendid moment when several assailants use them to tie up Liu, who constantly repositions his body to shield his sister from blows. Here, we get to see a classic shift in fight rhythm: As Liu is held in place, all seems lost … until his fellow monks charge into the building, turning the asymmetric fight into a brawl. Nothing is cooler than warrior monks. —N.Q.\n\n47.\n\nMichelle Yeoh and Cynthia Rothrock vs. Henchmen, Yes, Madam (1985)\n\nA tale of two legends began in Yes, Madam. The Corey Yuen–directed cult classic was the first film to feature Michelle Yeoh in a starring role and launched American home-video action legend Cynthia Rothrock. Yeoh plays the titular Madam, a fearsome cop named Inspector Ng who is beating the brakes off bad guys left and right, showcasing the elegance and unfuckwithability that has come to define the Oscar winner’s career in martial-arts films. Along the way, she teams up with Scotland Yard cop Carrie Morris (Rothrock), and the two of them dispatch henchmen and show off the kind of combat excellence that action fans dream of.\n\nThe movie culminates in a battle of epic proportions with Yeoh and Rothrock on one side and countless adversaries on the other. Our stars weave up and down and in and out of a multilevel room replete with stairs and banisters and handrails and furniture for jumping on (and throwing villains off) and over and through. Yes, Madam is the movie that let the world know Yeoh was as much a movie star as she was an incredible screen-fighting athlete. She makes combat choreography look like she’s dancing through water. And Rothrock’s got the goods, too — the American multi-degree black belt should have had a career in the States like Jean-Claude Van Damme’s. She had to take her skills all the way to the Pacific Rim’s eastern edge to find respect for her talents. But her A-force team-up with Yeoh in this movie gave her the spotlight she deserved. —Jordan C.\n\n48.\n\nRipley vs. the Alien Queen, Aliens (1986)\n\nIn her first encounter with a terrifying Xenomorph aboard a commercial space vessel in Ridley Scott’s Alien, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) frequently opts for the second option between “fight or flight.” That tends to be how it goes in horror movies. James Cameron’s sequel Aliens, though, is a near-perfect action movie, meaning that Ripley gets to fight like hell, outlasting all the seasoned Space Marines who accompany her back to the monster-infested moon LV-426. Eventually, she’s the only one left standing to protect a young girl from not just an average H.R. Giger grunt but the Alien Queen herself.\n\nIn Predator, which came out the year after Aliens, Arnold Schwarzenegger beats his unstoppable ’80s alien monster by going primal. With all due respect to Weaver, Ripley is not an Austrian slab of muscle, so she employs some tech to even the odds. The image of Ripley in a yellow-and-black-striped Power Loader suit is now iconic. But a sometimes-forgotten key element of her mech suit is that it’s not a weapon of war. It’s an industrial tool that she repurposes to throw herself at this towering extraterrestrial matriarch. Even with hydraulics and tons of metal giving her punches the force they need to knock back the queen, Ripley is extremely exposed, narrowly avoiding razor claws and that creepy little second mouth. Weaver was pretty exposed in real life, too, strapped into a massive and complex prop suit controlled by a hidden puppeteer. Cameron decided against using animatronics for the fight because it would have been too dangerous, though you can’t tell that the Alien Queen is anything but the meanest mother in space when watching the scene. Because of Aliens, the Xenomorphs would shift from horror spooks to formidable combatants, eventually facing off with Predators in crossover movies and even Batman in some comic books. Ripley, meanwhile, established herself as the new gold standard for what a badass female action protagonist could be. It’s a thrill to watch her transform from victim to protector while keeping her humanity. And her cry of “Get away from her, you bitch” might just be Aliens’s most savage blow. —J.G.\n\n49.\n\nInigo Montoya vs. Westley, The Princess Bride (1987)\n\nNo matter how many times you’ve seen The Princess Bride — which, let’s be honest, is probably a lot of times — it still possesses the capacity to surprise, particularly in this scene where Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) and Westley (Cary Elwes), then known to Inigo solely as a mysterious man in black, clash swords despite the fact that they really have no beef with each other. “You are wonderful!” says Inigo as his blade clangs and clangs against Westley’s. “Thank you,” Westley responds in a chipper tone. “I’ve worked hard to become so.”\n\nThis is not a typical fight scene, yet it’s steeped in tradition. The aesthetics and rhythms of the sequence, directed by Rob Reiner, evoke the classic back-and-forth sword-clanging of classic swashbuckler fare like The Adventures of Robin Hood, mentioned earlier on this list, while the dialogue and twists in the action— “I am not left-handed”; “I am not left-handed either” — are sprinkled with enough irreverence to match any moment from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. But the gentleness that underscores the whole thing — Westley ends the fight by telling Inigo, “Please understand I hold you in the highest respect” — felt like something new, and it was. The Princess Bride invented a subgenre of on screen combat: the family-fantasy movie fight. It’s something you’ve seen since in films like Ella Enchanted, Pirates of the Caribbean, Shrek, or Tangled, and it contains the same elements as this bit of Princess Bride swordplay. It’s funny if not cartoonish. It moves the plot forward with tension and without putting any of the major characters in serious peril. Its appeal crosses generations; parents and children can enjoy family-fantasy movie fights together with no fear that things will get grisly. The Princess Bride checks all those boxes better than any film before or since, which is why, nearly four decades later, we still hold it in the highest regard. —Jen C.\n\n50.\n\nAsh vs. Ash’s Hand, Evil Dead II (1987)\n\nConceptually, horror and action smoothly overlap: The existence of a monster necessitates an attempt to vanquish it, and the resulting efforts often involve memorable fights. (See the fights in Scanners and Aliens.) With The Evil Dead franchise, director and writer Sam Raimi gambled on the idea that horror, action, and a third genre — comedy — could coexist, and he hit big with his first sequel, a marvel of practical effects, prosthetics, and stop-motion animation. In the preceding film, Bruce Campbell’s Ash and his friends unwittingly summon a demon that possesses everything it can and murders most of what it comes in contact with in an outright bloody gorefest. Evil Dead II lightens things up a little. When Ash is bitten by an undead victim of a demonic possession and his hand is possessed in turn, he swiftly cuts it off, only for his appendage to becomes both his foe and the film’s greatest running bit — a consistent way for Raimi to inject farce into a film stacked with genuine nightmares.\n\nThe first fight between Ash and his hand is a wonderfully grotesque bit of slapstick and sight gags, from Ash trapping his hand under a bucket weighed down with a stack of books (the topmost of which is A Farewell to Arms) to the hand tapping its fingers in a gesture of sarcastic irritation when Ash struggles with reloading the rifle he’s using to shoot his former limb. “It’s not really a fair match — Ash still has one hand, and he eventually replaces the other with a chainsaw — but there’s so much life to his evil hand’s hoarse screams, cackling laugh, and dexterous scuttling. As it effectively hides from and taunts Ash, the hand doesn’t just test your sympathies (it was once part of a he!) but persuades you of its ability to indefinitely survive and wreak havoc. The hand does have one advantage: It can anticipate Ash’s movements, a kind of phantom-limb logic that is applied to future horror-comedies like Idle Hands, Annihilation, and Us. How the scene incorporates corporal mirroring into the humor and grotesquerie already on display with that reanimated appendage make it a genre triple threat that, nearly 40 years later, still strikes the right balance of action, comedy, and horror. Not too gory or too broad and enlivened by production-design details like the fluttering pages of the books the hand tossed off itself and the elasticity of Campbell’s shocked, irritated, and vengeful reactions, this Evil Dead II fight skitteringly blazed a trail. —R.H.\n\n51.\n\nJean-Claude Van Damme vs. Bolo Yeung, Bloodsport (1988)\n\nKnown as “the Muscle From Brussels,” Jean-Claude Van Damme had worked as a bouncer, stuntman, and extra before American producers caught wind of the young martial artist’s rugged good looks and combat skills. In Bloodsport, Van Damme’s breakout movie, the star flaunts all the qualities that would become his claims to fame: his sculpted derrière, spinning jump-kicks, a special way with the ladies. At the time, JCVD was a breath of fresh air in a landscape of self-serious macho action heroes like Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Van Damme had no qualms about coming off as sensitive and sexy; even his signature stunt — the spread-eagle splits — was less intimidating than it was enticingly erotic.\n\nBloodsport, based on the true(ish) stories U.S. Army Captain Frank Dux told about himself, arrived to middling reviews. Yet some critics couldn’t help but admire the film’s displays of athleticism: “Through the jungle of cliché and reservoir of bad acting in Bloodsport are some pretty exciting matches,” wrote the L.A. Times’ Leonard Klady. In the final match of the film, in which Van Damme plays Dux competing in a lawless martial-arts tournament, he’s up against the merciless Chong Li, the reigning champ. Chong cheats to get the upper hand: When he’s on the verge of being knocked out, he whips around and throws salt into JCVD’s eyes, blinding him for the remainder of the fight. In operatic slow motion, we see Van Damme, waving his hands around in panic, his eyes shot through with fear. Then, because of course, his blindfold training kicks in. Having found his qi, Van Damme launches a leggy offensive of quadruple roundhouse kicks that get some serious air. The blind showdown wasn’t a total novelty at the time (Jackie Chan in Master With Cracked Fingers predates it by almost a decade, and Jet Li would do it again in Legend 2 a few years later), yet Van Damme injects the performance with a rare quality for action stars — an unguarded spirit amid a scene that requires so much staged movement. Bloodsport’s matches are indeed great, and the movie would upgrade to cult status eventually, but its lasting impact would be unleashing Van Damme’s helicopter legs into the mainstream. —B.L.\n\n52.\n\nTetsuo vs. Kaneda, Akira (1988)\n\nThe final showdown between Tetsuo and Kaneda might not be the first fight that comes to mind when you think of Akira (it’s probably the bike race, a masterful clinic of light, color, and skull-bashing violence), but the clash between a cyberpunk and his best friend on the verge of ascending to godhood is by far the most emotionally resonant confrontation of Katsuhiro Otomo’s film.\n\nIt plays out in two parts — first when Kaneda unloads on Tetsuo with a handheld laser cannon until he runs out of ammo, and second when Kaneda returns on his iconic red bike to finish the job. By this point, Tetsuo is the film’s tragic villain, having survived an accident that left him with enough psychic energy to telekinetically level buildings, and he’s already killed hundreds of people. The military has waged an orbital attack against Tetsuo, and the ground around him and Kaneda is exploding. But at the end of the day, they’re still just pissy teens. When Kaneda’s gun runs dry and Tetsuo gains the upper hand, he’s not ruthless enough to kill Kaneda; he just wants to get another taunt in.\n\nIn the second act of their fight, Kaneda wields a freshly charged laser against Tetsuo’s deteriorating body, his form expanded into a pus-ridden, kaiju-size blob of horror. This is when the fight morphs into an attempted rescue with Kaneda trying to save his friend despite their differences. Cue a series of flashbacks that for the first time illustrate their relationship — images that run alongside the destruction of Tokyo. The slide may be Akira’s most imitated image, but it wouldn’t persist so powerfully if the film didn’t stick its emotional landing. This final fight manages to localize nuclear conflict as a spat between boys who are themselves products of postwar conflict. Plenty of live-action and anime directors alike, from the Stranger Things guys to Hype Williams, have cited the film as an influence, but the way it links mass destruction to masculinity reverberates most obviously in titles as varied as Attack on Titan and Oppenheimer. —E.V.B.\n\n53.\n\nRowdy Roddy Piper vs. Keith Davi"
