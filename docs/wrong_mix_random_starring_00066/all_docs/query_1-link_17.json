        "text": "Your level of success depends on this ONE important thing (Every person on LinkedIn needs to see this) The level of success you achieve depends on how much you fail. MORE failure equals MORE success, As long as you're learning from each failure. In our society, failure is seen as a bad thing. We celebrate wins but rarely acknowledge the losses. We see others' successes without seeing the failures they went through. But the truth is, in order to succeed in life, you need to: 1) Keep pushing past the failures 2) Embrace them, and 3) Learn from them. 'Theory' and 'Doing' will only get you so far. It's learning from failure that will step up your success. Do you agree? Share with someone who needs to see this today! Credit: Rob Dance"
