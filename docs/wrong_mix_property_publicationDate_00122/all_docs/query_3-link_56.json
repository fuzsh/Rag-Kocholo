        "text": "Alfred Bester was first published in the S.F. pulps in 1939, moved into the comics industry, principally with DC (he created the \"Green Lantern Oath\"), and went on to radio, television and magazines. Through much of his life, he retained a part-time career in science fiction. He is widely considered part of the S.F. pantheon, with The Stars My Destination, published in 1956, being one of the works to confirm that position.\n\nWhen the future of the future changes so rapidly it may seem surprising that this book is still in print. In fact, it has recently been republished in Britain with an introduction in which Neil Gaiman claims it as the perfect cyberpunk novel. It also fulfils H.G. Wells recommendation that the science fiction author one particular advance in science and chronicle what follows. In this novel, Bester accepts that faster than light spaceships are impossible and posits a future where individuals can \"jaunt\" i.e. teleport the self through the power of the mind. The discovery of this possibility as teachable to all, at a greater or lesser level, transforms the society of Earth. With a maximum jaunt in the region of 1000 miles, however, exploration and colonisation of the Solar System occurs in the \"old fashioned way\". Naturally enough, in the old fashioned way, war breaks out between the outer and inner planets.\n\nSo far, The Stars My Destination sits amidst the mainstream of fifties science fiction. John W. Campbell, the influential editor of Astounding (now Analog), felt that accentuated mental and psychic powers would mark the future of humanity; almost every science fiction reader believed that we would occupy the solar system in the near centuries; many in North America felt it inevitable that the history of Earth and her colonies would reflect that of Britain and her American colonies. What makes the book exceptional is the central character, Gully Foyle, \"a man of physical strength and intellectual potential stunted by lack of ambition\".\n\nThe story would not be possible without jaunting and interplanetary conflict but, while these are essential to the structure of the tale, character is the subject. Gully Foyle is a dull creature when the novel begins, who has reacted to life rather than taking part. When the Vorga leaves him to die he begins a transformation, powered by fear, anger and thirst for revenge. He studies the manuals and saves himself, developing into a convincing thug in his first attempts to destroy the Vorga. From this, via despair and continuing desire for revenge, he becomes a master criminal and, perhaps, the saviour of the human race. His actions are counterpointed by Central Intelligence and a radioactive private investigator. Foyle's associates become enemies and his victims become assistants. He is shaped and tempered by blows and adversity.\n\nThe book is full of ideas but Bester keeps tight control over them. He displays the broad canvas in the prelude and proceeds to fill it with telling detail - there is no point in putting fences around a spaceport, for example, when anyone can jaunt five miles. The elements of plot are exposed carefully, drawing the reader on as Foyle's fantasy of revenge grows so hugely that the possibility of planetary destruction is well within the bounds. The final revelations telescope the sense of the novel yet again.\n\nThere are a few pointers to the age of the book. The language is more formal than most writing today. Sex is implicit and implied rather than explicitly described. Nevertheless, Gully Foyle, unlike so many heroes of S.F.'s first decades, has not dated. He is archetype and individual and he has a tale which demands to be read.\n\nPurchase this book at Amazon.\n\nRelated Links"
