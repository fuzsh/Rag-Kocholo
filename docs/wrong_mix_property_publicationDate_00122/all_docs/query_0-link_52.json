        "text": "By the end of his career, the end of his life, Alfred Bester (1913-1987) had fallen very far, into poverty, degradation, loss of talent, alcoholism. By any ordinary person’s standards he fell to tremendous depths but for Bester the fall was beyond calamitous because he had so far to fall from. Because Bester was a Grand Master. In the Fifties he reshaped SF, reached heights no-one else touched, exploding out of the page. Imperfect, yes, prejudiced, yes, but possessed of a drive that was his alone. Though his genius was confined to, dependant upon that decade, and the first very few years of the next, his influence has travelled far further than just his own times. Without Alfie Bester we would never have had William Gibson, cyberspace and cyberpunk, and everything that has flowed from that.\n\nBester is known for his two great Fifties novels, The Demolished Man and Tiger! Tiger!, the latter better known as The Stars My Destination. Deservedly too. He also wrote a string of short stories and novellas that deserved the highest regards. Two of them were Bester-novels-in-miniature. There’s an odd connection between them, a case of duplicity. One has two very different but widely-known titles, ‘The Starcomber’ and/or ‘5,271,009’. There is one line difference between the two, a last line appearing in only one version of the story.\n\nThe other has a single name but exists in two forms. Both of them are called ‘The Pi Man’. They couldn’t be more alike whilst being very different.\n\n‘The Pi Man’ first appeared in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in 1959. It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Short Story in 1960 but lost out to Daniel Keyes’ classic ‘Flowers for Algernon’. It was reprinted in The Dark Side of the Earth in 1964, the first collection of Bester’s short fiction. At some point Bester revised it, in which form it appeared in Star Light, Star Bright, in 1976, the second of a two-volume collection of Bester’s short stories. The first version was later reprinted in Virtual Unrealities, a 1997 compilation introduced by Robert Silverberg.\n\nI first came across the story in an old second-hand copy of The Dark Side of the Earth, sometime in the late Seventies/early Eighties, having been inspired to an enthusiasm for Bester after reading his comeback novel Extro from the Library. I was surprised to discover an alternate version in Star Light, Star Bright and have always preferred the original, not merely because I read it first but because it is the original and that is very clear from reading it. It reads and feels sharper and more focussed, the work of a writer realising an idea and not that of a man retreading old ground, polishing a completed thing.\n\nThe re-write removed outdated references to Beatniks and their scene, shuffled the typographical tricks Bester used to try and escape the printed plane, expanded on some minor scenes but otherwise followed the plot of the original faithfully, re-using at a guess at least 50% of the original language. It also changed the names of the principal characters, from Abraham Storm, the narrator, to Peter Marko and Lizzie Chalmers, the girl who falls in love with him, to Jemmy Thomas, who also shifts from being a freckled redhead to a pale-skinned blonde. Otherwise, the most significant change in the two versions is that whereas Storm’s narration conceals his real issue until late in the story, Marko drops elucidatory hints from quite early on, make the revelation less of a surprise when it comes.\n\nWhat is the story? Abraham Storm narrates it, to a mixture of us, Lizzie Chalmers and the FBI, in a fast-paced, disjointed manner of languages and styles and rhythms, painting a bewildering picture that both portrays his life in a ‘typical’ day and overlays it with multiple references to other incidents of which we learn only the merest glimmering but that suggest that Storm may be far more sinister than the eccentric/weirdo he obviously is.\n\nLike the overwhelming majority of Bester’s fiction in the Fifties, and even later, ‘The Pi Man’ is about compulsion: what an individual is driven to be. In The Demolished Man, Ben Reich was driven by subconscious Oedipal instincts. In The Stars My Destination, Gully Foyle was driven by blind, unthinking revenge. Abraham Storm and Peter Marko are driven by inexplicable, uncontrollable urges to do mad, often violent, unleashed things, explosions of pure Id that have no pattern, rhyme or reason. Pardon me, that should be discernible pattern. Storm/Marko are driven by Patterns.\n\nStorm is an arbitrageur, and a very rich one at that. He makes his money buying and selling money across the world markets, the classic buy low sell higher approach. The margins are slim but the amounts are larger so the profits multiply. He’s very good at responding to the patterns of markets. He also doesn’t have any friends. He can’t allow himself friends, or lovers. We see him out of the blue attack and viciously beat an elderly clerk he’s never seen before, foul behaviour, unforgivable behaviour, undertaken against his own will, afterwards compensated if it can be by the anonymous gift of $1,000, cash. He intimates but without specifying that he has done far worse, to a man who was his friend, to a woman he let himself love.\n\nIt’s a picture, a confusing, inexplicable picture, dashed across the page with hurtling energy. And then it happens. ‘It’ is a profit of $57,075.94. A nicely symmetrical, balanced figure, except for the 94c. He has 20c in his pocket. He calls his secretary, who we will soon learn is Lizzie Chalmers, borrows 74c off her and throws it out the window. When he turns back she is smiling, looking at him in undisguised delight. He fires her on the spot, gives her a year’s severance. She’s crying, hurt, uncomprehending. He told her not to like him when he hired her but she didn’t believe him. She says she hates him, he says good, now I can go to bed with you, she runs away.\n\nWe still don’t know what it’s about but we’re beginning to get an impression of the paradox.\n\nStorm wants a woman, needs a woman, but it has to be someone who hates him. He goes to a Beatnik Club, sneers at the male Beats, sizes up the females in their ‘uniform’, clutching a brown paper bag of their toiletries under their arm, looking for a bed for the night, resigned to sharing it. He chooses one, they scratch and spit at each other, he thinks she’s a dyke, no chance of her falling in love with him. He takes her home for the night but when he gets there he finds Lizzie Chalmers, who’s blagged her way in. She’s fallen in love with him, ten years her senior. He’s her man. If he’s going to have anyone tonight it’s going to be her. But Storm mustn’t, he can’t. For her sake.\n\nHe wants to, though, so he tries to explain to her why he can’t. Before he can do so, lights start going out and on again, a building at a time, along the street. He knows what it means, even before his building is the last to lose its power. They’ve found him. Who they are, and it could be a multitude of options, he has to get away, off Manhattan, to a private plane. Lizzie insists on coming with him, swearing back at him, ignoring the punch he aims at her. In the end, she distracts him and they’re caught: thank God it’s the FBI. They want to know why he’s broadcasting, non-stop, an all-spectrum broadcast of radio and TV signals, white noise, jumbled patterns. They can’t crack the code. Who is he? Why is he doing this? What is he hiding? The answer is… nothing. It means nothing. It is purely random. White noise and dead air. An oasis of peace.\n\nSo Storm finally explains, to the FBI, to the reader and, by proxy, to Lizzie Chalmers. All of life is patterns. The alternation of day and night, the four seasons, the movements of partners in a dance. All humans feel these and obey them instinctively. They create balances, they compensate, like a mother kissing her child when it is crying. That’s what Abraham Storm is, he’s a Compensator. He responds to patterns, is forced to compensate for them, good for bad, bad for good, violence for love.\n\nBut Storm responds to much more than the mere I/2 or 2/4. Or even the asymmetric time signatures like 5/7. Think wilder, think impossible. From all over the globe, and maybe further afield. He has to adjust, to compensate. Hence his life. Is this true? Is it real? Some critics have pointed out that there are no differences between Storm’s theory and simple insane delusions. We don’t know. Either way, there’s nothing the FBI can get him for, no-one can get him, something keeps him forever in motion. He doesn’t get to have it end.\n\nStorm collapses. He wakes to find himself back in his apartment, with Lizzie undressing him. She knows. She’s even seen his most horrific of compensations, something we don’t get even a merest hint save that it was the woman he let himself love, and we imagine or try to imagine what extreme he was driven to. She’s alive, she lives in Europe, the checks go out every month. He knows no more than that, he doesn’t want to know. How much can the heart endure? he pleads, and at that moment, despite the enormity of what he’s done, you feel sympathy for him. However undeserving.\n\nLizzie knows. In the revised version where she’s Jemmy Thomas, Bester makes it more explicit that she too is under a compulsion, that Storm/Marko is her compulsion, love at first sight. She knows what he can do, she has fair warning, she’s determined to stick to him, determined that her love, their love, will prevail. Love Conquers All. He warns her that it might not. The odds are what you might say, not good.\n\nVery well then, if love is too small, let it be so. And she undresses in the dark and climbs into bed with him and they hold each other and whatever comes next, and when and how and if is not for us to know. What you imagine is according to your temperament: my hopes are not high.\n\nThe Peter Marko revision is in many ways more sophisticated than the original. A certain sexual crudity in typography is smoothed out, a nursery rhyme based joke is deleted by renaming a supporting character. The time-specific Beatnik stuff is replaced by something generic: the story could be taking place at any time now, which may be commercially sensible but blurs the events. Bester was very much a writer of the Fifties and he and the specifics first together perfectly. Other changes, well, as I said before they are retreads, they lack the energy Bester brought to the story in the first place, irrespective of the more rounded picture they might form. Like the excision of the Beats, they render the story more generic in tone.\n\nI can understand changing the names, to give Bester a sense of newness, enabling the story to be different because it’s not happening to the same two people, but I have to take a pass on his altering Lizzie’s physical characteristics, even if it springs from the same notion. Lizzie is distinct, sharp in definition, Jemmy is literally blander and more invisible. She takes on less individuality because there is less of her that is visible to the eye.\n\nThe only other change in the revised version worth mentioning is that, as I said before, Bester starts offering hints and clues from a much earlier stage, often enough to give the virgin reader a good chance of working out the central enigma of Peter Marko. I strongly believe the story was better when the explanation was held back: everything fits, but only once you’re given the key.\n\nAlfred Bester wrote two of SF’s most highly acclaimed novels. Many credit him with creating modern SF. Some of his short stories are Alfie Bester novels in miniature. This has been one of them."
