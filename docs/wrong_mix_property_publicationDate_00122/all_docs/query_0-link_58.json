        "text": "Computer security is not merely a technical field. Knowing about people, and about societies, guides the application of the technical material. During this class we’ll often refer to an eclectic collection of books that teach lessons we can apply to computer security. These are some referred to in past classes, plus a few other favorites.\n\nThis list was compiled by Tom Walcott, a former TA for ECS 153, with a few additions by Matt Bishop. Any other suggestions welcome!\n\nNon-Fiction Books\n\nSaul Alinsky, Reveille for Radicals, Vintage Books\n\nThe classic analysis of organization for social improvement. Many of the techniques Alinsky discusses can be adapted to attacking systems—or defending them.\n\nSaul Alinsky, Rules for Radicals, Vintage Books\n\nHow the Have-Nots can organize to change society. Like Alinsky’s other book, the rules are applicable to computer security.\n\nJames Bamford, The Puzzle Palace, Viking Press\n\nA book on the history of the NSA.\n\nJames Burton, The Pentagon Wars, United States Naval Institute\n\nA study of how a group of reformers tried to test and improve some weaponry, and what happened. A wonderful and eye-opening description of bureaucratic in-fighting.\n\nDorothy Denning, Information Warfare and Security, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company\n\nGood background on issues we will discuss in class, nice presentation. Mentions some Matt Bishop guy.\n\nJean Guisnel, Cyberwars: Espionage on the Internet, Plenum Press\n\nAn interesting non-US perspective written by a Frenchman.\n\nJeffrey Hunker, Creeping Failure, McClelland & Stewart\n\nDiscusses the security of the Internet infrastructure and software in general.\n\nDavid Kahn, The Codebreakers, Macmillan and Co.\n\nThe definitive history of cryptography. Excellent perspectives, and discussions of how cryptography works in a non-mathematical way.\n\nSteven Levy, Crypto, Penguin\n\nAn interesting book chronicling the interaction between the government and non-government cryptographers since the twentieth century.\n\nNiccolò Machiavelli, The Prince, Penguin Books\n\nIts study of rulers applies not only to princes, but also to organizations and environments in general.\n\nNicholas Rankin, Churchill’s Wizards, Faber and Faber\n\nDeception played a key role in World War II, and the British were masters of it.\n\nBruce Schneier, Secrets & Lies, John Wiley and Sons\n\nSchneier examines the digital world that permeates our lives, and how security plays into it.\n\nSun Tzu, The Art of War, Delta\n\nA classic text on warfare; many of its principles can be translated into cyberwarfare.\n\nFiction Books\n\nAlfred Bester, The Demolished Man, Vintage Books\n\nThe struggle between the killer Ben Reich, the 24th century’s richest man, and Lincoln Powell, the police prefect with ESP, is like a cat-and-mouse game between an attacker and computer security folks. This classic science fiction book won the first Hugo for Best Novel. Bester was named a Grand Master of science fiction.\n\nJohn Brunner, The Shockwave Rider, Ballantine Books\n\nA science fiction novel about a future in which data about everyone is stored in a ubiquitous information network. Many of the terms used with malicious logic, such as worm, were first used here.\n\nEric Frank Russell, Wasp, Tor Books\n\nA science fiction novel in which a lone agent is dropped on an enemy planet. His job: cause chaos. He does.\n\nJohn Scalzi, Redshirts, Tor Books\n\nAn amusing riff on Star Trek, conflating reality with a TV show’s world.\n\nNeal Stephenson, Cryptonomicon, Avon Books\n\nGood discussion of World War II cryptography, and real world/wartime issues involving security of communications, etc. Great mathematical perspective.\n\nNeal Stephenson, Snow Crash, Spectra Books\n\nOkay, this one’s more marginally computer security related, but it has a virtual reality interface figuring prominently into the plot, and deals with issues of networking through metaphor.\n\nVernor Vinge, Fire Upon the Deep, Tor Books\n\nSuperb science fiction book with computer security applications.\n\nVernor Vinge, True Names, Tor Books\n\nFirst real cyberpunk book; Gibson got credit for this sort of work."
