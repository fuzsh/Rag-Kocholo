        "text": "THE STARCOMBER\n\nALFRED BESTER\n\nWilder Publications\n\nCopyright © 2014 by Wilder Publications\n\nCover image © Can Stock Photo Inc. / ABCDK\n\nAll rights reserved, including the right to reproduce this book or portions thereof in any form whatsoever.\n\nManufactured in the United States of America\n\n10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n\nISBN 978-1-62755-875-4\n\nTake two parts of Beelzebub, two of Israfel, one of Monte Cristo, one of Cyrano, mix violently, season with mystery and you have Mr. Solon Aquila. He is tall, gaunt, sprightly in manner, bitter in expression, and when he laughs his dark eyes turn into wounds. His occupation is unknown. He is wealthy without visible means of support. He is seen everywhere and understood nowhere. There is something odd about his life.\n\nThis is what’s odd about Mr. Aquila, and you can make what you will of it. When he walks he is never forced to wait on a traffic signal. When he desires to ride there is always a vacant taxi on hand. When he bustles into his hotel an elevator always happens to be waiting. When he enters a store, a salesclerk is always free to serve him. There always happens to be a table available for Mr. Aquila in restaurants. There are always last-minute ticket returns when he craves entertainment at sold-out shows.\n\nYou can question waiters, hack drivers, elevator girls, salesmen, box-office men. There is no conspiracy. Mr. Aquila does not bribe or blackmail for these petty conveniences. In any case, it would not be possible for him to bribe or blackmail the automatic clock that governs the city traffic signal system. These things, which make life so convenient for him, simply happen. Mr. Solon Aquila is never disappointed. Presently we shall hear about his first disappointment and see what it led to.\n\nMr. Aquila has been seen fraternizing in low saloons, in middle saloons, in high saloons. He has been met in bagnios, at coronations, executions, circuses, magistrate’s courts and handbook offices. He has been known to buy antique cars, historic jewels, incunabula, pornography, chemicals, porro prisms, polo ponies and full-choke shotguns.\n\nHmimelHerrGottSeiDank! I’m crazy, man, crazy. Eclectic, by God, he told a flabbergasted department store president. The Weltmann type, nicht wahr? My ideal: Goethe. Tout le monde. God damn.\n\nHe spoke a spectacular tongue of mixed metaphors and meanings. Dozens of languages and dialects came out in machine-gun bursts. Apparently he also lied ad libitum.\n\nSacré bleu. Jeez! he was heard to say once. Aquila from the Latin. Means aquiline. O tempora O mores. Speech by Cicero. My ancestor.\n\nAnd another time: \"My idol: Kipling. Took my name from him. Aquila, one of his heroes. God damn. Greatest Negro writer since Uncle Tom’s Cabin.\"\n\nOn the morning that Mr. Solon Aquila was stunned by his first disappointment, he bustled into the atelier of Lagan & Derelict, dealers in paintings, sculpture and rare objects of art. It was his intention to buy a painting. Mr. James Derelict knew Aquila as a client. Aquila had already purchased a Frederic Remington and a Winslow Homer some time ago when, by another odd coincidence, he had bounced into the Madison Avenue shop one minute after the coveted paintings went up for sale. Mr. Derelict had also seen Mr. Aquila boat a prize striper at Montauk.\n\nBon soir, bel esprit, God damn, Jimmy, Mr. Aquila said. He was on first name terms with everyone. Here’s a cool day for color, oui! Cool. Slang. I have in me to buy a picture."
