        "text": "Princess Academy\n\nI just spent the most wonderful day outside! Picture this: Me, outside, lounging in the grass, not caring about getting grass stains on my pants, with Princess Academy by Shannon Hale in my grasp. Beautiful picture isn’t it? Haha, well it is to me, and I wish I could do this every day! Plus, besides the gorgeous weather, I finally got to read this book! I have actually had it on my ‘To Be Read’ list for a long time, and I knew I had it, but I just could not locate it! Suddenly, out of nowhere, my wondrous older sister appeared with it in her hand! 😉 Anyways, so I read “Princess Academy” and it really surprised me. Not that it was particularly amazingly good, or terribly bad, but I had just remembered it happening differently… But don’t worry! It was good. 🙂\n\nThis book takes place on Mount Eskel, the only place in Danland where Linder (a special and rare stone) can be mined. Now on this mountain lives a girl named Miri, after the Miri flowers that grow out of the Linder. She is only 14 years old, has an older sister named Marda, and a Papa named Laren. Where’s her mother you ask? Well you learn that later on in the book, but I will tell you a bit of what happens… On Mount Eskel there is a quarry where they get the Linder. One year they were short workers, and so Miri’s mother decided to help even though she was very pregnant with Miri. Then an accident happened. She lost a lot of blood, and then Miri was born prematurely. Her Mother help on for a week, keeping Miri in her arms the whole time, before she passed away. Because of this, Laren won’t let his youngest daughter anywhere near the quarry; which, unbeknownst to him, causes Miri to think she is too weak, unloved, and unwanted to work with everyone else. Sad isn’t it? Also, in the quarry a different way of speaking is used, since it’s far too loud to hear normally. It is called quarry-speak. How is it done? Miri will discover that in the book.\n\nOne day, when the traders arrive from the low-lands, a proclamation comes with them. “This past summer, the priests of the creator god took council on the birthday of the prince. They read the omens and divined the home of his future bride. All the signs indicated Mount Eskel.” Because of this, all the girls on the Mountain whom were aged 12 to 17 were forced to attend an academy down the mountain to prepare themselves to become a bride of the Prince. In this academy they learn all sorts of things, and the girls begin to compete to become the Academy Princess. She would be the girl with the best scores overall, and she would get the privilege of the first dance with the Prince, and the most beautiful dress. Guess who she is…? 😉 But all is not smooth sailing along the way. Miri must compete with Katar, one of the eldest and most able girls. She must face dangerous bandits. She must help her friend Britta to discover where she really belongs. And most of all, she must contend with her raging heart. Will she marry the Prince and finally escape to see the world? Or will she chose to stay on Mount Eskel, and try to win the heart of Peder, her childhood friend? You’ll just have to read and see! 😀\n\nThis was a really good book in the end, even though I thought the protagonist to be a tad bit too young… 😉 I mean, Miri is 14 and Prince Steffan is 18! Like come on, let’s be honest here. What 18-year-old would want to marry a 14-year-old? Mhm. Just what I thought. It was a really sweet book just the same, and I will admit to crying at some parts. (Plus the occasional yelling at the book.. Tee hee hee!) I would also like to brag about the fact that I was able to figure out the ending! 😛\n\nPersonally I would recommend ‘Princess Academy’ to any one who is under 20 years of age… Just because it would be an easy read for those who are older. But if yall would like to just relax with a simple read, this would be a perfect book! As a plus, it’s written by Shannon Hale! For those of you who don’t know her, she wrote ‘The Goose Girl’ that I adore so much! Now that I mention it… There’s another book I should put up here… Dang! 😛 Haha!\n\nNow go! Go forth and read! And enjoy planting a wondrous mindworm\n\n-Charlie"
