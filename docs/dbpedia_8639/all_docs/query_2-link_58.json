        "text": "Princess Uma is most famous for her connection to animals. She is currently the professor of Animal Communications at the School for Good. She is also a member of the League of Thirteen.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nIn the picture in The School For Good And Evil Ever Never Handbook, she has her mouth shaped in a 'O', most likely calling for an animal.\n\nPrincess Uma is described a a very pretty, having black hair to her waist, olive skin, almond-shaped eyes and crimson lips. Agatha first noted that she looks too young to be a teacher[1]She normally wears a pink teacher's dress, but in The Last Ever After she dresses like a ninja to rescue Tedros and Agatha.\n\nHer teacher outfit is a pink dress.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nUma is a typical happy and sweet princess. When she did speak, it was in a giggle whisper, but she couldn't make it through a full sentence. Every few words, she'd stop to listen to a distant fox or dove as respond with her own giddy howl or chirp[2]. She is very friendly with animals and she would do anything for them, Agatha at first described her as something crazy, but during book three sees her as a very brave princess.\n\nPrincess Uma has shown many defining attributes throughout the four books in The School for Good and Evil.\n\nAt first Uma is quite an animal lover, Agatha came to think that she was a bit crazy for always being surrounded by animals.\n\nIn book three Uma showed a more courageous personality of hers since being exiled from her made her see that she had to defend herself from and not always be able to depend on others who would come to help her.\n\nHistory[]\n\nFairy Tale[]\n\n\"Once upon a time, an animal saved mine and in return, it received the happiest ending of all.\" - Princess Uma, about her own fairy tale[3].\n\nChilhood[]\n\nNot much is known about Uma's childhood, other than that she was taken to the School of Good when she was just a child. She was top of her class in animal communication but was weak enough to defend herself. During her Trials by Tale, she was attacked by a swarm of bloodsucking bees, but was saved by Prince Kaveen, losing the chance to be the Class Captain but winning the heart of Uma, the two began dating and were always caught kissing by Dean Dovey.\n\nLater Life[]\n\nAfter graduating from the School of Good she married Kaveen and they had quite a wonderful romance, however one day Uma was kidnapped by an evil warlock who told Kaveen that if he wanted Uma back, he should go to his fortress to face him. In the warlock's fortress, Kaveen was about to arrive, Uma, scared that her beloved would be killed, used her animal communication skills and with them called a large white deer which attacked and killed all the warlock's servants and impaled their antlers on the warlock's heart of this killing him, the deer died due to its injuries, but Uma managed to free herself from its restraints. When Kaveen arrived at the warlock's lair, he found Uma free embracing the lifeless deer and the dead warlock.\n\nThe Storian immortalized the story of Princess Uma making her a legend among fairy tales, Uma gained a great reputation, but Kaveen was mocked for being too late to save Uma. Over time the two grew apart and finally divorced. After divorcing, Uma returned to the School of Good and became a teacher of Animal Communication, being a very popular teacher for her tale.\n\nThe School For Good And Evil[]\n\nAgatha had a rather negative relationship with Princess Uma. She taught Animal Communication for princesses, which, at the time, was not a class for males in the School for Good. As a quote from the first book, \"Agatha didn't know if she was nervous or just an idiot\". She \"couldn't make it through a full sentence and would respond with her own giddy howl or chirp.\" The Animal Communication teacher's challenge was for the students to put their finger in a bowl of Wish Fish, which can tell the girls' deepest desires. Most of the girls wished for boys (Beatrix's elaborate wedding with Tedros), while Agatha wished for so many different things, eventually making her wish come true and placing first in the challenge. After the incident at the Snow Ball, Uma along with Dovey and the other Masters of Good and Evil are petrified by the School Master but are released after he dies.\n\nDuring her Animal Communications lesson Uma taught evergirls that one of their most greatest weapons against evil was animals her first lesson was to have each girl make a wish on the wishlist but then Agatha caused an animal riot due to her ability to grant wishes, which got a tower set on fire. Uma was slightly impressed with the rare talent Agatha had but was also terrified since many animals that were her friends chased after Agatha, she told her to run. During the Circus of Talents she is trapped in her study and during Sophie's attack at the end of the book, she is Petrified by the School Master.\n\nA World Without Princes[]\n\nEvelyn Sader changed Uma's class of Animal Communications to Animal Hunting. Refusing to kill her friends who she has been close with for a very long time, she is ejected into the Woods. Everyone thinks that she is killed by the Red Cloaks around the School for Boy. According to Hester, Uma was requested to teach Animal Hunting. She refused the offer and was instantly evicted into the woods. Later, in the Last Ever After, it is shown that she survives the woods: \"An Animal Communication teacher unable to survive in the woods?\"\n\nIt turns out that during that time period, Uma found Yuba the Gnome and was requested to join the League of Twelve, which would change to Thirteen if the teacher agreed, which she did.\n\nThe Last Ever After[]\n\nAfter being evicted, Uma has her animal friends to help her survive she later on meets Reaper, who leads her to the League of Thirteen. She joins them, saves Agatha and Tedros Uma is annoyed by their bickering thinking she is taking care of them instead of leading them to safety, She is petrified by Snow White's witch and Tedros carries her to the League of Thirteen. She was forgotten about left on the floor but then is noticed by Yuba. She is saved by Tinkerbell's fairy dust. She and her animal friends help fight during the war later on. Many of her Animal friends died and she honors them.\n\nIn the third book of the series, Princess Uma first appears by disguising herself as a ninja while rescuing Agatha and Tedros. The two were facing Red Riding Hood's wolf and Jack's Giant, awakened by Rafal, determined to redo their fairytales. Princess Uma, having befriended millions of animals during her lifetime, called some with a piercing whistle and the two villains fled for their lives.\n\nUma brought the two Evers to the League of Thirteen, but along the way, they encountered Snow White's cottage. Tedros heard a female cry for help, and Agatha instantly followed him. They noticed that the sound had been coming through the cottage, and while Tedros was searching around outside, Agatha stepped in. She noticed the zombie villain from Snow White's fairytale and begins to defend herself as the Evil Queen slashes at her. When Agatha runs back to Tedros, the two Evers hear a scream and notice that Uma has been Petrified by Snow White's villain.\n\nShe wakes up when they find League headquarters and plays a rather small part throughout the rest of the book. Uma does help fight the rest of the war, calling animals to support her and fighting zombie villains. At the end of the fight, she silently prays for all her animal friends who died in combat. Before the end, she is rehired to the School for Good where she now teaches both girls and boys Animal Communication.\n\nThe Ever Never Handbook[]\n\nIt is confirmed that Uma is back at the School for Good to teach the Evers Animal Communication. She gives a short mini quiz determining which type of person the reader/ever is and can survive out in the wild. She also decides to finally have boys learn animal calls.\n\nQuests for Glory[]\n\nPrincess Uma appears once in the fourth book in the series, and it is simply to call her mongooses, which can help fight of the vicious snake they are fighting. Uma helped students get rid of the snakes she was thought to be crying but she was calling out friends, they were mongooses.\n\nAbilities[]\n\nAnimal Communication: Uma is incredibly skilled at talking to animals, being able to not only call small animals such as squirrels, rabbits, and mice, but also has the ability to call large animals such as deer, tigers, and wolves, with which she can interact and ask them to help her defend herself or escape.\n\nMagic: Like all the characters in fairy tales, Uma can use magic, she usually uses it to change her clothes.\n\nExpert Combatant: During her time in exile, Uma stopped relying solely on her animals and began practicing combat so she could defend herself alone.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nKaveen of Shazabah[]\n\nUma and Kaveen met at the School for Good. He saved Uma from a hive of blood-sucking bees during their Trial by Tale, losing his chance to be Class Captain but winning her heart. They used to be caught by Dean Dovey in the Love Spells nook of the library, where they carved their initials into the wood. After they graduated and married, Uma was captured by a warlock from Netherwood, who wanted to ransom her back to Kaveen. Uma didn't want Kaveen to get hurt, so she summoned a white stag from the Woods to help her. The stag ripped through the warlock's heart with his horns, battled his henchmen and died, but Uma escaped. The Storian wrote the triumph of Princess Uma, and she became legendary for her deep friendship with animals. But Kaveen was endlessly taunted for arriving too late to save her. Although Kaveen never blamed Uma for what happened with the passage of time they started fighting and ignoring each other, before eventually separating.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nUma's favourite animal was her white pet rabbit Roscoe, who slept in her bed. But he died after being bitten by a vampire bat.\n\nUma doesn't make friends with animals such as snakes calling them beasts\n\nUma is the first known princess (before Agatha) who had a happy ending without a boy.\n\nWhen Agatha heard that Uma was ejected she wasn't bothered, showing a hint on amusement instead\n\nBut then she remembers the read cloaks and gets extremely concerned\n\nReferences[]\n\nThe School for Good and Evil Books & Media: The School for Good and Evil (book) | A World Without Princes | The Last Ever After | The Ever Never Handbook | Quests for Glory | A Crystal of Time | One True King | Rise of the School for Good and Evil | Fall of the School for Good and Evil | The School for Good and Evil (Netflix)\n\nThe School for Good and Evil Characters Evers: Agatha | Tedros | Tristan | Chaddick | Beatrix | Kiko | Reena | Millicent | Giselle | Nicholas | Tarquin Nevers: Sophie | Hort | Hester | Anadil | Dot | Arachne | Callis | Vanessa | Aric | Mona | Nicola | Ravan | Vex School Staff: The School Master | Clarissa Dovey | Leonora Lesso | Princess Uma | August Sader | Evelyn Sader | Castor | Pollux | Yuba | Helga | Emma Anemone | Bilious Manley | Sheeba Sheeks Secondary Characters: Rhian Sader-Mistral | Japeth | Aric | Kei | Mistral Sisters | Lady of the Lake | Lady Grisella Gremlaine | Bettina | Edgar & Essa | Filip of Mount Honora | Yara | Maid Marian | Stefan | Willam | Bogden | Reaper Minor Characters: Ajubaju | Adam | Agnieszka | Dean Brunhilde | Belle | Gunilda | Honora | Elders | Jacob | Mumtaz Adeen | Popisil | Bane | The Butcher's Son | Radley Rise Duology Characters: Rafal Mistral | Rhian Mistral | Aladdin | James Hook | Midas | Kyma | Hephaestus | Pirate Captain | Vulcan | Marialena Sader | Quintana | Fala of Good | Botic | Professor Humburg | Professor Mayberry | Arabella\n\nFairy Tale Characters Evers: Aladdin | Cinderella | Peter Pan | Briar Rose | Snow White | Jack | Hansel and Gretel | Arthur | Sir Kay | Lancelot | Guinevere | Anya | Kaveen | Merlin | Red Riding Hood | White Rabbit Nevers: Captain Hook | Gertrude | Estra | Bluebeard | Cinderella's Stepmother | Cinderella's Stepsisters | George Scourie | Catherine | Rabid Bear Rex"
