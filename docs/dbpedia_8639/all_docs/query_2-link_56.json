Ages 9 and up.\n\nSOLIMAR: THE SWORD OF THE MONARCHS by Pam Muñoz Ryan\n\nFind it: Bookshop | Amazon\n\nPam Muñoz Ryan's books are often filled with magical realism (one of my favorite genres!) that whisk readers away to another time and place. Solimar, who has always been mesmerized by the monarch butterflies on their annual migration, is set to officially become a princess on her quinceañera. On one of her observations, she receives a mysterious rebozo, or shawl, which helps her intuit the future.

She is horrified at the idea of her impending 16th birthday ball, at which she is required to choose a husband. She offers her maid a chance to spend the day reading Alice in Wonderland, in exchange for her peasant clothes and spends the next several days attending the local school. This is a highly entertaining story in which everyone seems to have a good time, there is lots of delicious word play and plenty of quirky characters. We enjoyed this as a read aloud and my son got quite a kick out of it and had a grand time laughing at the foibles of the characters, especially the ridiculous suitors. Ages 8 and up.\n\nIRON HEARTED VIOLET by Kelly Barnhill\n\nFind it: Bookshop | Amazon\n\nPrincess Violet is not exactly the most traditional of princesses in the kingdom but she finds her way, anyway. When she and her best friend Demetrius discover a mysterious book and accidentally release a malignant spirit, Violet must reverse the magic. The court story-teller narrates the book, giving it an interesting narrative viewpoint, which comments on the nature of storytelling, and how we decide how stories are told and authenticated. Ages 9 and up.\n\nTUESDAYS AT THE CASTLE (series) by Jessica Day George\n\nFind it: Amazon | Bookshop\n\nEvery Tuesday the castle adds a new feature; it could be a room, a hallway, or a turret, or something else surprising.

Shannon Hale has written about how boys love her book, and are too often told they shouldn't read books about princesses, so let's dispense with the gendered reading nonsense, shall we?\n\nTHE GREAT GOOD THING (series) by Roderick Townley\n\nFind it: Bookshop | Amazon\n\nDo characters seem real beyond the pages? Well, that's because they are. In this metafictional tale, Sylvie decides that 80 years of living the same story over and over as the character in a book has gotten a bit dull. She decides to break the most important rule of all book character rules: she looks up at The Reader. Townley explores the wonder of books and how they merge with our imaginations and lives. I heartily recommend this for grown-ups, too.
