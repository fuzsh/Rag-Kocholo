Length will vary depending on format viewed.\n\nBrowse The Princess Academy Lesson Plan:\n\nIntroduction\n\nLesson Calendar\n\nChapter Abstracts\n\nCharacter Descriptions\n\nObject Descriptions\n\nDaily Lessons\n\nFun Activities\n\nEssay Topics\n\nShort Essay Questions\n\nMultiple Choice\n\nShort Answer Questions\n\nWorksheets and Evaluation Forms\n\nQuizzes\n\nTests\n\nQuiz/Test Generator\n\nFull Lesson Plan Overview\n\nCompletely Customizable!\n\nThe Princess Academy lesson plan is downloadable in PDF and Word. The Word file is viewable with any PC or Mac and can be further adjusted if you want to mix questions around and/or add your own headers for things like \"Name,\" \"Period,\" and \"Date.\" The Word file offers unlimited customizing options so that you can teach in the most efficient manner possible. Once you download the file, it is yours to keep and print for your classroom. View a FREE sample\n\nLesson Plan Calendars\n\nThe Lesson Plan Calendars provide daily suggestions about what to teach. They include detailed descriptions of when to assign reading, homework, in-class work, fun activities, quizzes, tests and more. Use the entire Princess Academy calendar, or supplement it with your own curriculum ideas. Calendars cover one, two, four, and eight week units. Determine how long your Princess Academy unit will be, then use one of the calendars provided to plan out your entire lesson.\n\nChapter Abstracts\n\nChapter abstracts are short descriptions of events that occur in each chapter of Princess Academy. They highlight major plot events and detail the important relationships and characteristics of important characters. The Chapter Abstracts can be used to review what the students have read, or to prepare the students for what they will read. Hand the abstracts out in class as a study guide, or use them as a \"key\" for a class discussion. They are relatively brief, but can serve to be an excellent refresher of Princess Academy for either a student or teacher.\n\nCharacter and Object Descriptions\n\nCharacter and Object Descriptions provide descriptions of the significant characters as well as objects and places in Princess Academy. These can be printed out and used as an individual study guide for students, a \"key\" for leading a class discussion, a summary review prior to exams, or a refresher for an educator. The character and object descriptions are also used in some of the quizzes and tests in this lesson plan. The longest descriptions run about 200 words. They become shorter as the importance of the character or object declines.\n\nDaily Lessons\n\nThis section of the lesson plan contains 30 Daily Lessons. Daily Lessons each have a specific objective and offer at least three (often more) ways to teach that objective. Lessons include classroom discussions, group and partner activities, in-class handouts, individual writing assignments, at least one homework assignment, class participation exercises and other ways to teach students about Princess Academy in a classroom setting. You can combine daily lessons or use the ideas within them to create your own unique curriculum. They vary greatly from day to day and offer an array of creative ideas that provide many options for an educator.\n\nFun Classroom Activities\n\nFun Classroom Activities differ from Daily Lessons because they make \"fun\" a priority. The 20 enjoyable, interactive classroom activities that are included will help students understand Princess Academy in fun and entertaining ways. Fun Classroom Activities include group projects, games, critical thinking activities, brainstorming sessions, writing poems, drawing or sketching, and countless other creative exercises. Many of the activities encourage students to interact with each other, be creative and think \"outside of the box,\" and ultimately grasp key concepts from the text by \"doing\" rather than simply studying. Fun activities are a great way to keep students interested and engaged while still providing a deeper understanding of Princess Academy and its themes.\n\nEssay Questions/Writing Assignments\n\nThese 20 Essay Questions/Writing Assignments can be used as essay questions on a test, or as stand-alone essay topics for a take-home or in-class writing assignment on Princess Academy. Students should have a full understanding of the unit material in order to answer these questions. They often include multiple parts of the work and ask for a thorough analysis of the overall text. They nearly always require a substantial response. Essay responses are typically expected to be one (or more) page(s) and consist of multiple paragraphs, although it is possible to write answers more briefly. These essays are designed to challenge a student's understanding of the broad points in a work, interactions among the characters, and main points and themes of the text. But, they also cover many of the other issues specific to the work and to the world today.\n\nShort Essay Questions\n\nThe 60 Short Essay Questions listed in this section require a one to two sentence answer. They ask students to demonstrate a deeper understanding of Princess Academy by describing what they've read, rather than just recalling it. The short essay questions evaluate not only whether students have read the material, but also how well they understand and can apply it. They require more thought than multiple choice questions, but are shorter than the essay questions.\n\nMultiple Choice Questions\n\nThe 180 Multiple Choice Questions in this lesson plan will test a student's recall and understanding of Princess Academy. Use these questions for quizzes, homework assignments or tests. The questions are broken out into sections, so they focus on specific chapters within Princess Academy. This allows you to test and review the book as you proceed through the unit. Typically, there are 5-15 questions per chapter, act or section.\n\nEvaluation Forms\n\nUse the Oral Reading Evaluation Form when students are reading aloud in class. Pass the forms out before you assign reading, so students will know what to expect. You can use the forms to provide general feedback on audibility, pronunciation, articulation, expression and rate of speech. You can use this form to grade students, or simply comment on their progress.\n\nUse the Writing Evaluation Form when you're grading student essays. This will help you establish uniform criteria for grading essays even though students may be writing about different aspects of the material. By following this form you will be able to evaluate the thesis, organization, supporting arguments, paragraph transitions, grammar, spelling, punctuation, etc. of each student's essay.\n\nQuizzes/Homework Assignments\n\nThe Quizzes/Homework Assignments are worksheets that can be used in a variety of ways. They pull questions from the multiple choice and short essay sections, the character and object descriptions, and the chapter abstracts to create worksheets that can be used for pop quizzes, in-class assignments and homework. Periodic homework assignments and quizzes are a great way to encourage students to stay on top of their assigned reading. They can also help you determine which concepts and ideas your class grasps and which they need more guidance on. By pulling from the different sections of the lesson plan, quizzes and homework assignments offer a comprehensive review of Princess Academy in manageable increments that are less substantial than a full blown test.\n\nTests\n\nUse the Test Summary page to determine which pre-made test is most relevant to your students' learning styles. This lesson plan provides both full unit tests and mid-unit tests. You can choose from several tests that include differing combinations of multiple choice questions, short answer questions, short essay questions, full essay questions, character and object matching, etc. Some of the tests are designed to be more difficult than others. Some have essay questions, while others are limited to short-response questions, like multiple choice, matching and short answer questions. If you don't find the combination of questions that best suits your class, you can also create your own test on Princess Academy.\n\nCreate Your Own Quiz or Test\n\nYou have the option to Create Your Own Quiz or Test. If you want to integrate questions you've developed for your curriculum with the questions in this lesson plan, or you simply want to create a unique test or quiz from the questions this lesson plan offers, it's easy to do. Cut and paste the information from the Create Your Own Quiz or Test page into a Word document to get started. Scroll through the sections of the lesson plan that most interest you and cut and paste the exact questions you want to use into your new, personalized Princess Academy lesson plan."
