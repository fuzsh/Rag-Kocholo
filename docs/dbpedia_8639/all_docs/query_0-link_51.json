This book is like a lovely, iridescent polished stone of linder, the fictional opaline marble quarried by the villagers of Mount Eskel. It has hidden\n\nShow More\n\nfacets from different angles that catch your eye and your heart and leave you with a sense of strength and beauty.\n\nMost of the children in the village start work in the quarry at age 8, but Miri, named after the tiny pink flower that bloomed out of the cracks in the linder rocks, has never been allowed to work there. She thought it was because she was small for her age, and had been deemed inadequate. Now, at age 14, she learns she, along with all the other village girls between the ages of 12 to 17, must go to a “princess academy” to train to be acceptable as a potential bride for the Prince.\n\nShe takes leave of her father, older sister Marda, and lifelong crush Peder to make the 3-hour journey along with 19 other girls. While there, they are exposed not only to book learning for the first time, but to competition, cliques and jealousy, and unanticipated tests of courage and friendship. Only occasionally are they allowed to return to their village on breaks.\n\nMiri may be one of the smallest children, but it is she who figures out the secret of the linder stone, and when the academy is in real danger, it is only her secret that can help save it.\n\nHale is a gifted writer of different genres that at first glance seem not to bear relation to one another. But all of her books are characterized by faith, good humor, and above all, the self-sufficiency and resilience of women and girls.\n\nHer language often plays just the right note. At one village gathering, Peder has just kissed Miri on the cheek, then runs off:\n\n\"Miri did not move for three verses of the next bonfire song. A smile tugged at one corner of her mouth like a brook trout on a fishing line, but she was too staggered to give in to it.\"\n\nIn another instance, one of the girls at the academy, Katar, has just confessed to Miri about the source of her unhappiness:\n\n\"…Katar sobbed misery at her side. ’I’m sorry,’ Miri said again, hating how hollow those words sounded. Katar had given her a small gift by opening her heart and showing her pain. Miri tucked the moment in her own heart and hoped somehow to repay.\"\n\nThis book is not really about princesses, unless you define princess as a young lady who is not afraid to summon all of her assets to take on the world and make a difference.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member ladycato\n\nHigh on Mount Eskel, all of the villagers help work linder blocks out of the quarry. Everyone, that is, except Miri. Her dad won't let her work in the quarry, leaving her feeling isolated and all too aware of her small stature. When a surprise emissary from the king arrives and declares that the\n\nShow More\n\nprince's bride must be from Mount Eskel, all of the teenage girls are forced to attend a \"princess academy\" at the base of the mountain. Overseen by a tyrannical tutor, the girls are taught to read and drilled in the ways of proper society. Miri is torn - should she work hard to catch the prince's eye and leave the mountain, or use her new skills for the aid of her village? And how can she fit in with the other girls who have bonded in their quarry work?\n\nThis was a fast read, even at 314-pages long. I read it on one day. Princess Academy is a fun read, and the sort of book I would have adored when I was 10-12. However, as an adult I found the plot very predictable. I won't be keeping this one, but it was worth reading.\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member robincar\n\nFourteen-year-old Miri lives in an isolated mining village in the mountains. After the priests declare that the prince’s bride is to come from her village, Miri and the other village girls must attend an academy to prepare them for the possibility of being chosen by the prince as his bride. Once\n\nShow More\n\nat the school, Miri discovers she has an interest in learning (although maybe not being a princess), but competition to be the best at the academy is fierce. The book’s plot is not as fluffy or shallow as the title might imply as the academy is not a wonderful fairy-tale place. Miri’s mountain culture is well-developed and richly imagined. It lends a good sense of depth and authenticity to the story. The book has quite the group of brave, spirited, and intelligent girls, including Miri. This is an excellent young adult fantasy novel of friendship, growing up, and finding one’s place in the world. The book also strongly emphasizes the importance of education and, especially, being able to read.\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member LeighAnneJensen\n\nI chose this book to read out loud to my daughter. Since before she was born, I have read out loud to her every single night before bed, and we really enjoy that time together. I like to read her classics, and as she gets older, she likes to hear about people having adventures. A lot of adventure\n\nShow More\n\nstories are either about boys, or they pair a boy with a girl. It's a rare and wonderful discovery to find a book that not only has a strong solo-female lead, but is beautifully written and fun to read. That is what Princess Academy was for both me and my daughter.\n\nI really enjoyed reading about Miri. She is exactly the kind of role model I want for my daughter - someone open-minded, sensitive, driven, intelligent, kind, and thoughtful. The story itself was so enjoyable to read. My daughter was so sad to see the book end, and then she was very excited when I told her that this is actually just the first book in the series! We can't wait to get started on the second book, and are actually going to the bookstore tomorrow to pick it up.\n\nWe're both really looking forward to reading more about Miri and her adventures.\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member kthomp25\n\nMiri is named for a small mountain flower. She is small and thinks perhaps her father finds her useless in the mining of linder, stone valued in the kingdom. She learns through her experiences that other girls face their own private issues; Katar whose father doesn't love her, Britta whose father\n\nShow More\n\nforces her to live a lie, Esa who has a useless arm... Everyone has some impediment to happiness, especially if those things prevent a view of a broader picture of life.\n\nThe lessons stressed in the Academy about Conversation and Diplomacy are intriguing and useful.\n\nUseful ideas, such as the the Rules for Diplomatic Negotiations:\n\nState the Problem\n\nAdmit Your Own Error\n\nState the Error of the Other Party\n\nPropose Specific Compromises\n\nInvite Mutual Acceptance\n\nllustrate the Negarive Outcome of Refusal and Positive of Acceptance\n\nAssert a Deadline for Acceptance\n\nConversation:\n\nRepeat the Name\n\nAsk Questions\n\nMake Observations, Not Judgements\n\nReturn the Conversation to the Other Person\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member elbakerone\n\nPrincess Academy is a cute fairy-tale story perfect for youth or young adults but easily enjoyed as a light novel for grown readers too. The book tells the story of Miri, a young girl from a mountain village who feels useless to her town since she is forbidden to work in the rock quarry with her\n\nShow More\n\nfamily. One day an emissary from the king comes to the mountain and reveals that the king's priests have determined that the prince's bride is to be chosen among the girls from Miri's village.\n\nMiri and all her friends are sent to a special Princess Academy to learn the ways of royalty but as Miri progresses through the school she finds that, even more than becoming a Princess, what she really longs for is a place to belong. With themes of the importance and potential of all people, and with a story that is sweet and yet unpredictable, Princess Academy is a charming tale that deserves all the accolades showered upon it.\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member mdomsky\n\nThe princess academy is set up near the foot of Mt.

Eskel, and so all the girls are forced to attend despite the hardship\n\nShow More\n\nit places on the town. The tutor is a fierce woman, and the girls have a lot to learn, not only about being a princess, but about each other, and about the mountain itself. And do any of them really want to marry a stranger just so that they can be a princess? This is a really wonderful story with just a touch of magic. The ending ties everything up perhaps just a little too neatly, otherwise, I loved it\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member humouress\n\n{First of 3 [Princess Academy] series; children’s/ YA, fantasy}\n\nMiri, named for a small mountain flower, is a mountain girl but, at fourteen, is small for her age and forbidden by her father from setting foot in the quarry for the linder which is the lifeblood of their village. She has grown up in\n\nShow More\n\na small village on Mount Eskel in the country of Danland where all the villagers over eight years old - except her - work in the linder quarry hoping to have cut enough stone when the traders make their annual visit to buy enough food to last them the whole winter. Linder is a stone used in building that is durable and marbled with a different colour from each quarry site.\n\nIt is hard enough to hold up great palaces and never crack, yet light enough to haul long distances.\n\nThen comes the surprising news that the priests have divined that the prince’s future bride will be found on Mount Eskel and so all the village girls between the ages of twelve and eighteen will be required to attend an academy so as to turn them into suitable suitors. However the only building big enough for the purpose is a few hours walk away so they will have to stay away from their homes and families for some months.\n\nThough the girls are all enchanted by the thought of becoming the princess and they all learn different things from the academy, will the girl chosen want to leave her mountain home? The Princess Academy changes all of their lives in ways they could never have dreamed of. Miri, for example, discovers how clever she is and how much she is loved.\n\n‘But your pa adores you. I’ve seen him look at you and Marda as if you were the mountain itself, as if you were the world.’\n\nHe does? thought Miri. Her heart beat once as she thought, He does.\n\nA story about family and friendship and adventures on the mountain, gently told. I love the way Hale portrays relationships, be it sibling, parental or friendship. And just maybe that ‘mean girl’ isn't really so bad ...\n\n4 stars\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member mullgirl\n\nWow. That’s about all I can say. Ok, just kidding, we all know that I am nothing if not wordy :) I loved this book, heart and soul, and I tore through it in an evening (one of the joys of reading a young adult book!).\n\nI had seen this book around at the local book sellers but never really thought\n\nShow More\n\nmuch about it until I made the connection that the author, Shannon Hale, also wrote a Pride and Prejudice fan-fic called Austenland. My daughter’s school sent home a recommended reading list for the holidays and had The Princess Academy listed for 6th grade reading. I decided that since my to-be-read shelf was nearly bare (only a bunch of digital photography how-tos), why not?\n\nWhy not indeed? In fact, why not sooner? In fact, now, I must get Ms. Hale’s The Goose Girl and read that. The story starts out a little iffy in my opinion. I’m not a fan of books that are meant for younger girls whose focus is on how to win themselves the perfect man. In this tale, Miri, the main character is 14 and sent with other girls in her village away to a “Princess Academy” because the King’s priests etc have foreseen that the Prince should marry a girl from that village. This story totally could have gone the wrong way with making the focus be, as it would seem to be logical, about improving oneself for the boy, doing, being, changing all for the approval of the boy. Not so here and so brava Ms. Hale!\n\nThe Princess Academy is all about becoming satisfied with who you are: discovering your talents and developing them, facing your weaknesses with both eyes opened and learning to accept them or try to change them to something more in your favor. It’s about growing up, for all of the right reasons.\n\nThe girl does get the boy in the end, but it’s on her terms, and he sees her and evidently always has as the wonderful young woman she has finally recognized in herself.\n\nDelightful. Wonderfully written–it’s easy to understand why it’s a Newberry Honor Book. The characters are rich and believable. And this is so not a book to keep hidden away for the pleasure of only tween girls. This is a book to be loved by all women everywhere.\n\nShow Less\n\nLibraryThing member Nikkles\n\nPrincess Academy is the second book I read by Shannon Hale and the one that really hooked me I think. Its so well written and different then the normal young adult novel that I was captivated. Hale's writing is deceptively simple in form, which makes it all the more fun to read.\n\nLibraryThing member tjsjohanna\n\nReally liked this book - realistic fantasy world, nice exploration of a child/young woman coming to see the world in a more true way - lovely friendships and family relationships.\n\nLibraryThing member dfullmer\n\nThis is a cute tale of a girl growing up in a village high in the mountains.

The cycle of their lives is simple -- mine until the traders come, trade the linder for much needed winter supplies, and then quarry to replace the deplenished stone stores. The traders provide the vilage's only contact\n\nShow More\n\nwith the lowland world, and the saying \"a surprise from a lowlander is like a snake in a box\" typifies the villagers' trust of those who don't belong on the mountain. When a blue wagon and a royal messenger arrive with the traders bearing a message that the next king's wife will be selected from the girls of Mount Eskel, and that in order to prepare them for meeting the prince, a school will be established.... Well, let's just say that not everyone is overjoyed at the prospect.\n\nMiri, just fourteen, and too small for quarry work, is one of those forced to attend the \"Princess Academy\". At school, rivalries develop among the girls, who vie for top spot in hopes of attracting the prince's attention. Miri is torn between wanting to see and learn more of the outside world, and her love of her family and Mount Eskel. Ultimately, a combination of Mount Eskel wisdom and skill with the new learning shows Miri the way to save all the girls, and make the village a better place for everyone.\n\nNot the fastest moving story, but it is well written. Miri is an appealing, sympathetic character realistically drawn, and her application of the abstract concepts she's learned to her real-life situation is a lessen of itself.
