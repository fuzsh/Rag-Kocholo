Then word comes that the king's priests have divined her small village the home of the future princess. In a year's time, the prince himself will come and choose his bride from among the girls of the village. The king's ministers set up an academy on the mountain, and every teenage girl must attend and learn how to become a princess.\n\nMiri soon finds herself confronted with a harsh academy mistress, bitter competition among the girls, and her own conflicting desires to be chosen and win the heart of her childhood best friend. But when bandits seek out the academy to kidnap the future princess, Miri must rally the girls together and use a power unique to the mountain dwellers to save herself and her classmates.\n\nHardcover, 314 pages\n\nPublished on April 1, 2007 by Perfection Learning\n\nISBN-10: 0756981808\n\nISBN-13: 9780756981808\n\nYou are About to Leave DOGObooks\n\nBy clicking on the \"Continue\" button, you will be redirected to Amazon.com to view the product page for this book.
