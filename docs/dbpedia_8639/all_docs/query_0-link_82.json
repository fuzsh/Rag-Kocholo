        "text": "Little Red, by Betan Woollvin (Apr. 2016, Peachtree Publishers), $16.95, ISBN: 9781561459179\n\nRecommended for ages 3-8\n\nWe all know the story by now – Little Red Riding Hood goes to visit her sick grandmother, meets the Big Bad Wolf, who forms a plan that has pretty dire circumstances for grandma, depending on which version you’re reading.

Not as a child, either – as an adult. When the Dutch artist moved to Arles, France, he was taunted and bullied by the townspeople, including the children, who mocked his bright red hair and his unusual artistic style. It’s even a recent theory that Van Gogh did not commit suicide, but was shot by two teenage boys that he knew.\n\nThe Artist and Me is told through the eyes of a childhood bully, one of Van Gogh’s tormentors, looking back at his life. Written as a journal entry, or possibly a letter to a son or grandson, the unnamed narrator begins by writing, “I used to do an ugly thing…” and tells the story of how he laughed at and ridiculed a “crazy man with wild red hair and a short red beard and a dream.” While he’s secretly intrigued by Van Gogh and his paintings, he falls into bully mode, “in crowds, of course, since that is what cowards do.” One day, he follows Van Gogh into a field and sees, just for a moment, the landscape as the artist does, and this transforms him – but when Van Gogh tries to connect with him, he runs away. As an older man, he sees the paintings in a museum and sadly writes, “I don’t laugh at him anymore”.\n\nThe Artist and Me is a message to both the bullied and the bullies. Anyone can be a target, but you can also rise above it. Van Gogh never gave up on his dream of telling the truth with his art. Bullies are redeemable – and you don’t have to wait for years to pass before realization. Seeing the world through someone else’s eyes can be the great equalizer, if one is brave enough to let it happen. The acknowledgement that bullying is a team sport for cowards delivers a strong message that I hope reaches children and adults.\n\nSophie Casson’s beautiful art is created in Van Gogh’s signature style, looking very much like he illustrated this story. She uses bold colors and lines, creating landscapes and people alike.\n\nThis is the kind of book you read to all of your grade levels to talk about the consequences of bullying. Putting Van Gogh’s story out there for people to hear and see opens up the chance to have some deep conversations about mob rules, crowd behavior, and most importantly, the effects that bullying has on both the bully and the bullied.\n\nTake a look at some of the beautiful artwork from this powerful book.\n\nThe Battle for Room 314: My Year of Hope and Despair in a New York City High School, by Ed Boland (Feb. 2016, Grand Central Publishing), $26, ISBN: 978-1455560615\n\nRecommended for ages 16+\n\nI normally review books for children here at MomReadIt, but I felt like this was an important book to review here for parents, educators, and anyone else trying to wrap their heads around education these days. Education is a hot-button topic everywhere – it’s always been, because it concerns our kids, and our future, but it’s never hotter than it is during an election year, and that’s exactly where we’re heading.\n\nWe know the education system needs help. We know that underserved communities in our country are falling through the system’s cracks. The Battle for Room 314 tells the story of one man who tried to make a difference in both arenas. Ed Boland left a high-profile career at a non-profit to teach in a New York City public high school. He was ready to make a difference in the lives of young people, having seen the fantastic results of his non-profile organization, which sends exemplary children from low-income neighborhoods to the best schools, giving them an advantage in life they wouldn’t otherwise have. He’s ready to cut out the middleman and help these kids himself.\n\nWhat a rude awakening. What Mr. Boland learns in his year of teaching is that politics enters the classroom at all levels. That the problems aren’t only in the classroom, they’re in the homes that these children come from. That teachers are burned out, overworked, and when they try to propose changes that will benefit the students and make things easier on themselves, they get stymied by their own union. He can’t make these kids turn on to learning, not when the issues they’re facing in their individual lives seem almost insurmountable. He met young girls who were prostituting themselves at middle grade age; children homeschooled on the subway by their homeless parents; kids who were running drug rings for their incarcerated family members. Their realities are so far away from anything Boland could comprehend – and myself, reading this book – that it seems like the ultimate Sisyphean task.\n\nThis isn’t going to be a fairy tale ending: the title alone is your heads-up to that. It’s not meant to be. It’s an indictment of so-called education reform and a plea for the powers that be to understand that changes need to be made at ALL levels, by multiple organizations. More standardized testing isn’t going to make these children succeed. Common Core isn’t going to help these kids.\n\nI loved this book. Boland has a sense of humor and a sincerity in his belief that makes it hard to read this book at times. I hurt for him, and I hurt for the kids in the classroom just as much as I wanted to scream at them for Boland. I’m a public librarian in an area that serves a lot of underprivileged kids, and I only see a fragment of what Boland witnessed in his classroom every day. There are some days where I just knock my head against a wall and wonder if I’m ever going to get through to “my kids”. Some days, the answer is “maybe”. Some days, I even feel like it’s a “yes”. Boland’s book spurs me on, to keep doing what I’m doing, but I’m in a completely different area, doing a completely different job. I see where I can make change, and go for it. And that’s what Mr. Boland’s book reminded me to keep in mind.\n\nParents, read this book and understand what our educators are up against. Educators, read this book and know that you’re not alone. People get it, and more people will continue to get it. All we have to do is keep pushing for the right changes to be identified. And it has nothing to do with a new state test.\n\nThe Last Monster, by Ginger Garrett/Illustrated by Dinara Mirtalipova (Apr. 2016, Delacorte Books for Young Readers), $16.99, ISBN: 9780553535242\n\nRecommended for ages 10-13\n\nSofia was never the type of kid to stand out. Not before the cancer, anyway. Now, with her shaved head and prosthetic leg, she really doesn’t want to stand out, but the mean girl group at school is determined to make Sofia their project. And then, there’s The Book. The Book that ended up in her closet. The Book that’s writing to her. Xeno, one of Aristotle’s lost students, has gotten in touch with Sofia through the book, telling her that’s she’s been chosen to be the next Guardian. Guardian of all the mythical monsters in the world. The thing is, someone else wants that book – wants to do away with the monsters, and she’ll do anything to get her hands on it, including unleashing the Last Monster. Now, Sofia has to learn her Guardian duties, deal with middle school, and navigate a relationship with her mother, who has a hard time letting go after almost losing her daughter.\n\nThis is a wild book, and I mean that in the best sense. I thought I was getting a story about a girl beating cancer – and I was – and then, this fantastic world opened up within that story. Who else to be chosen to be a hero, right? A kid who fought cancer and won, a kid who just wants to concentrate on getting through each day, now bestowed with this responsibility, this guardianship – it’s so much bigger than she is, but she’s clearly the one for the job. I loved Sofia because she’s not a victim. She doesn’t want to be with the cool girls, she doesn’t even know what the heck to do with a crush, it’s so confusing to navigate, and she’s really not sure what the heck to do when a monster shows up at her window for the first time, but she’s going to figure it all out. The monsters are going to teach her a few things, too, and so is Xeno.\n\nThis is a brilliant fantasy to put into the hands of middle schoolers. It brings kids realistic fiction and infuses it with an amazing fantasy that will keep the pages turning. This one is going on my library shelves, without question. Give this to your Fablehaven and Spiderwick fans and let them blend their own bestiaries together.\n\nThe White Cat and the Monk: A Retelling of the Poem “Pangur Bán”, by Jo Ellen Bogart/Illustrated by Sydney Smith (March 2016, Groundwood Books), $18.95, ISBN: 9781554987801\n\nRecommended for ages 3+\n\nA solitary monk meditates on the life he shares with a white cat he calls Pangur in this picture book retelling of the classic Irish poem, Pangur Bán. While pursues knowledge, Pangur has his own pursuits; he stalks a mouse. They live side by side, content with each other and what they each have.\n\nPangur Bán is a ninth-century Irish poem written by a Benedictine monk whose name is lost to history. An author’s note at the end of the story provides background on the poem and what we know about the writer and cat who inspired it. Jo Ellen Bogart’s retelling is my first introduction to the poem, and it’s amazing in the serene feeling it inspires. Paired with Sydney Smith’s gentle illustrations – the cat playfully sticks his paw under the monk’s door to gain entry, we see the monk lovingly hold Pangur in his lap, and there is a beautiful end picture of the cat at the window, ending with the poem’s line, “…and I find light in the darkness”, leading us to the conclusion that Pangur is the light, both literally (with his brilliant white fur) and figuratively, in his life. There’s a gorgeous illuminated manuscript spread that offers a great opportunity to talk to older readers about the artwork that monks created. It’s alternately a poem and a history lesson that works beautifully for young readers as easily as it does for higher grades.\n\nThis is a great book for any group of readers. Animal lovers and poetry lovers will have their own reasons for adoring the book, sure, but this is a great storytime read to get the little ones in a calming frame of mind after the singing and dancing are done. It’s a great book to introduce to kids who may not think they like poetry. It’s a great book to have on display for National Poetry Month. The White Cat and the Monk has already received a starred review from Publishers Weekly.\n\nJo Ellen Bogart is an award-winning children’s author. She has been nominated for and won many different awards, including the Ruth Schwartz Award, the Mr. Christie’s Book Award, the Amelia Frances Howard-Gibbon Award. Her picture book, Gifts, was selected for the TD Grade One Book Giveaway program, as well as the IBBY Honor List.\n\nSweaterweather, by Sara Varon (Feb. 2016, First Second), $19.99, ISBN: 9781626721180\n\nRecommended for ages 10+\n\nYou may have seen Sara Varon’s work before – she’s given us fun, all-ages graphic novels like Bake Sale, Chicken & Cat, and Odd Duck, and we’ll also be getting President Squid this year (review coming). She draws friendly, fun animals (and squids) in a cartoon style that makes you just want to curl up with these characters, have a cup of tea, and chat.\n\nSweaterweather is a re-issue of the original 2003 version, with extra stories and content. It’s done in two-color, and is part graphic novel story collection, part peek into Sara Varon’s creative brain. We have stories, essays, and journal entries existing together, an invite for kids and teens to take a load off and enjoy socially awkward animals wandering around Brooklyn and hey, while you’re here, see what goes on in the mind of a creative person!\n\nKids who love graphic novels and animal fiction will enjoy Sweaterweather for the stories. Creative kids will appreciate the big picture Sara Varon displays for them, and maybe, get them journaling and doodling on their own.\n\nSara Varon’s author website is great for burgeoning artists and fans. There are sections devoted to her books and illustrations, updates, and links to pages for her favorite illustrators and designers. She’s also an award-winning author/illustrator: Odd Duck was selected by Kirkus Reviews as one of the Best Children’s Books of 2013, Bake Sale was named a YALSA Great Graphic Novel for 2012, and Robot Dreams was on Oprah’s Kids’ Reading List in 2008. In 2013, Sara Varon was a Maurice Sendak Fellowship recipient.\n\nHere’s a sneak peek at some of the artwork from Sweaterweather.\n\nCurio, by Evangeline Denmark (Jan. 2016, ZonderKidz), $17.99, ISBN: 9780310729662\n\nRecommended for ages 13+\n\nIn a post-cataclysm Mercury City, Colorado, a group of alchemists, called Chemists, are the ruling body, controlling the populace through draconian laws, torture, and distribution of a daily potion that helps citizens survive after a plague ravaged society a century before. Physical contact between males and females comes with a price; a price her best friend, Whit, learns after trying to help Grey home in time for curfew. After Whit’s brutal punishment, Grey takes a risk she’s been thinking about for too long – she gives him her ration of potion. She knows she and her family are different – her father and grandfather don’t take it, and she suspects she doesn’t need it, either. This provides the Chemists with the chance they’ve been waiting for: the chance to get hold of Grey and attack her family. She seeks refuge at her grandfather’s repair shop, where her only chance at escape is to enter the world of the curio cabinet in the back of the shop: there, she finds herself in a world of living porcelain and clockwork figures, swept up in a class struggle of their own, and a mysterious figure known as the Mad Tock. Could he be the mysterious person she was told to seek out?\n\nCurio is a curious mix of post-apocalyptic and steampunk genres. Grey is a standard YA post-apocalyptic heroine, spunky and strong-willed, ready to take on the system. She’s got a special secret to be revealed and a family history that she only knows the surface of. The world inside the curio cabinet is a steampunk society, with “tocks” – clockwork figures that make up the working class – and “porcies”, the beautiful upper class. It’s a skin-deep society; the fragile porcies are terrified of cracks or breaks, because they’ll be banished to “Lower”, with the rest of the lower class and broken, to eke out an existence. We spend a lot of time in Curio, but a lot of it is laborious. There is a lot of concentration on the porcies’ fascination with Grey and where she could be from, and the villain of the story is enticing but not as fully realized as he could be. The Mad Tock storyline could also benefit from more emphasis on his story earlier on, and less on his gadgetry.\n\nThere’s some strong world-building on both sides of the curio cabinet, but the overall storytelling lags. The one plot that doesn’t lag at all is the love story, and that happens so quickly that it is difficult to believe (but that could just be my personal taste).\n\nCurio is an interesting mashup of two genres I never pictured working well together, but they do. There’s potential for a series here, and indeed, there is a prequel, Mark of Blood and Alchemy, available as a free download for Kindle and Nook."
