Even though Miri wanted to go back to her beloved home in Mount Eskel, but the king has sent Miri away to do it... And in order to keep good relationship with Stora, trying to avoid an war. During Miri`s teaching, she wrote the letters to her sister, Marda and her husband-to-be, Peder Doterson which never received. And that caused Peder to travel the long distance from Mount Eskel to Lesser Alva to see if Miri is really safe... And that`s part of the plot but if you guys want, you can check this book out! This book is so GOOD that I literally just lost in this book haha! But I would def recommend this book, and I also rate this 5 stars!\n\n5 years ago\n\nMiri is thrilled to go back to her family, when at the last minute gets summoned by the king. The queen and king want her to go to another place and teach three \"cousins\" of theirs. They need a treaty with Stora and want to offer one of the girls to Kind Fader. However, when Miri gets there, there are no servants and the three girls live alone in the linder house, far from the village. They hunt for their food and Miri meets Fat Holfer who is mostly trusting and also others like Jeffers that have lied and stolen the sisters money. Miri gets the sisters to learn with an influence of a bandit attack where they need to get back letters which contain money. Since they need to identify the letters the girls will have to learn to read. Also, from Miri's stories they will learn history. However, Stora invades Daniland unexpectedly and the girls and Miri are forced to escape the island on a pirate ship with the help of Peder, Miri's fiance. Miri soon discovers that the girls are princesses and that they are actually the queens daughters and they were hidden because they could have possibly taken over the rule. Miri sets things right and finds hope for them all. This book is very heart warming and super fun and action packed. I would suggest this book to almost anyone!!!\n\nOsoriost\n\n8 years ago\n\nThink this book is the best book I love it.\n\n9 years ago\n\nI would love to read this book and I hope I get to!!
