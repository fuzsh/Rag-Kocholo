        "text": "The girls walk back to the academy after receiving news of Prince Steffan’s return. Once there, Britta tells Miri a secret of hers. Her father was not a merchant but rather a nobleman. She grew up with Steffan and also happened to grow to love him. Her father sent her to live with a family in Mount Eskel so that she could attend the academy and possibly tie her family to the throne. Britta is afraid that Steffan will laugh at her or scorn her for coming to Mount Eskel and being somebody she’s not.\n\nThe prince enters the hall in the academy and lays eyes on Britta. After greeting each girls, and stops and converses with her. A few moments later, it is announced that Prince Steffan has chosen Britta. They are then betrothed. After the ceremony, the priest tell them that the king has raised Mount Eskel’s “status from a territory to the sixteenth province of Danland.”\n\nPeder comes to walk Miri home from the academy. After some conversation, they head home, hand-in-hand.\n\nThat marks the end of the Princess Academy by Shannon Hale! I quite enjoyed reading this book. The last chapter really tied everything together well. Each event that took place left me with a sense of fulfillment. Overall, Hale has done an excellent job with the imagery and plot. This is not an archetypal “princess” tale.\n\nThe next book is Princess Diana: Her Life Story, 1961-1997 by Richard Buskin. Stay tuned for the next series of blog posts!\n\nChapter 24 is the falling action. Everything is starting to calm down. Because the bandits ate most of the academy’s food supply, the girls have to spend the rest of the time at the village instead of the academy. Miri spends more time with her family and even teaches some of the kids who did not attend the academy how to read. She then has the idea of starting a village academy so that everyone in Mount Eskel has the chance to learn.\n\nMost afternoons, Olana teaches the academy girls–and a few others–at the village chapel. At first, she teaches subjects of the girls’ choosing. “After months of bowing to their desires, Olana [digs] her heels in and [insists] on reviewing some princess subjects.” Spring holiday then arrives, and a ball is held. Miri dances with Peder, who she finds much more enjoyable to dance with than Prince Steffan. However, “she [feels] as though the prince [stands] between them, keeping them one step apart.” While Miri thinks it would be wonderful to be the princess, she can’t quite think about leaving her village, family, and Peder.\n\nThis chapter is the calm after the storm. After everything that has happened with the bandits, Miri finally has a chance to relax. What will become of Miri and Peder with the thought of the prince looming over them?\n\nThe villagers face the bandits in a deadlock. They have four of the bandits, and the bandits have nine of the girls. The villagers attempt negotiation but get nowhere. Most of the bandits then abandon Dan because they are spooked by the story the girls told in Chapter 21. Miri, who is being held by Dan, observes that he is fairly close to the edge of a cliff that is concealed by snowfall. By using quarry-speech, she tells Peder and his friends to get Dan to move closer to the edge. After they do this, she stabs Dan in the wrist with her linder hawk, resulting in him ultimately falling off the cliff.\n\nThis chapter is the climax of the book. I wonder how Miri felt after all of this happened? Even though Dan was despicable, Miri did in fact cause him to fall to his death.\n\nPeder brings villagers armed with “levers, pickaxes, and mallets” to the academy. Miri spots them through the bedchamber window during the night. It is up to Miri to save the girls. While the bandits are sleeping, she quietly wakes the girls. Frid and Bena break the window frame and remove the glass pane. Most of the girls get outside before the bandits realize what is happening. Many of the girls reach safety and take refuge behind the wall of villagers. There is a commotion, and some the girls are recaptured, including Miri. At the end of the chapter, Dan grabs Miri and says, “‘You’re the troublemaker. . . I’ll see you broken and dead.'”\n\nThroughout the book, Miri often comforts herself with thoughts of her home, Mount Eskel. She sometimes sings or thinks of songs to encourage and comfort her. One song in particular stands out:\n\nNo wolf falters before the bite/ So strike/ No hawk wavers before the dive/ Just strike\n\nThis song appears in Chapter 22 as well as in many other chapters.\n\nSnowfall causes Dan to decide to stay at the academy until the storm breaks. Miri believes that “if the bandits [take] them down the mountain, none of them [will] return”, so she gets the girls to attempt escape. However, they are all caught. If just one of them had gotten away, help could have been sent to the girls. Miri wants to unnerve their captors, so she and the other girls tell the story of when bandits came to Mount Eskel. The last line goes as follows: “Mount Eskel feels the boots of outsiders. Mount Eskel won’t bear their weight.” Because she’s the one who started telling the story, Dan says to Miri, ” ‘[T]he next time there’s trouble, I slit you throat first and ask questions later.’ ”\n\nMiri has an idea. Since the whole mountain harbors linder, quarry-speech should work over long distances. For the next couple of days, she tries to quarry-speak with one of the villagers by putting her whole heart and mind into singing memories into the stone. When her memories of Pa and Marda do not work, she tries using some of Peder. She gets a faint reply, so she sends him a distress message asking for help.\n\nA lot is going on in this chapter! What I notice is how Miri tries to remain hopeful in the face of a very bleak situation. Those girls have been taken captive by murderous bandits, and they are all extremely frightened. Their only hope is in their families in Mount Eskel. However, the villagers all think that the girls are safe and sound at the academy. Thankfully, Miri finds a way to communicate their danger by using quarry-speech. Will Miri’s plea bring help, or will it go unnoticed?\n\nAs Miri flees, a man captures her and brings her back to the academy. A group of roughly fifteen bandits invaded the academy. They want to kidnap the prince’s betrothed and offer her to the king at a hefty ransom price. They do not know, however, that Prince Steffan left without choosing a bride.\n\nDan, the head bandit, does not believe the girls when they tell him that the prince did not select a bride. He offers to release the other girls if they tell him who the prince’s future wife is. No one speaks up, so he threatens them so that they will tell him who she is. Frid stands up and untruthfully admits to being the princess. By doing this, she hopes to save the other girls. Miri is afraid that Dan will not be true to his word. She is also frightened for Frid, so she claims to be the princess. The other girls key in and follow suit. Dan then decides to take them all with him.\n\nThis is a very scary and dangerous situation to be in. The girls are trying to do what they think is best under the circumstances. What will be the fate of the academy girls?\n\nAfter the ball, the girls have varying views of the prince. Some are positive, and others are negative. The chief delegate announces that the prince is returning to Asland and will revisit the academy to make his final decision. To the girls’ dismay, they have to stay and study at the academy until Prince Steffan’s return.\n\nMiri goes outside to be by herself. “For a slim moment, she had actually believed that she would leave the mountain, become someone new, see and do great things.” Because the prince left without any explanation, Miri loses this hope. Then Peder visits the academy, most likely to see Miri. They get in an argument with each other, and Peder runs away from the academy. While thinking about Peder, Miri hears a wail and a crash come from inside the academy. She receives a quarry-speech message from Esa telling her to run.\n\nThe author does an exceptional job using imagery in this book. She describes the world around Miri–the mountains, flowers, and linder. These things play a large role in Miri’s life. Her vivid descriptions give the book a unique characteristic.\n\nChapter 18 is about the ball. The author spends the most time describing the dancing, Miri’s overall experience, and her interactions with the Prince Steffan.\n\nAt first, Miri finds him polite and respectful yet stoic, uninteresting, and slightly rude. Then, she and the prince go and have some private time talking with each other. By being frank with him, Miri uncovers the real Steffan. Following the evaporation of his “princely demeanor”, she sees “an eighteen-year-old boy who could be confused like any other person.” The prince then tells her that Miri made an impression on him and he enjoyed dancing and talking with her more than with the other girls.\n\nWho will Prince Steffan chose as his bride?\n\nThe girls are left to their own devices after the exam. Then, the prince and his entourage arrive for the ball. The girls make a pack that they will be happy for whomever the prince chooses and not be jealous or mean. They do not want to jeopardize their friendships with the prince’s arrival. Unfortunately, Britta becomes sick the day of the ball and cannot attend. The girls also have a dress fitting. Because she is the academy princess, Miri gets to wear an especially beautiful gown.\n\nEverything the girls have been learning has led up to this event. They now get to show off their skills in dancing and conversation as well as their knowledge of history and economics.\n\nAt the beginning of each chapter, there is a short poem/song written by the author. Songs have a large role in Mount Eskel’s culture. Each poem/song has something to do with the chapter. For example, the one in Chapter 6 reads:\n\nWhiskers taut, front teeth bared/ Shaking breath, round eyes scared\n\nThis song is Miri’s variation of a work song. It also foreshadows what happens in the chapter–Miri is locked in a closet with a rat. These poems are all songs of the village. Some of them are about working in the quarry, others are of the mountain and nature, and the rest are about the villagers’ lives in general. Here is another example from Chapter 14:\n\nShe’s as lovely as a girl with flowers in her hair/ The mountain, my lady/ She’s as bright as spring sun drying rain from the air/ Mount Eskel, my lady\n\nI really enjoy reading each one and seeing the connection it has with the chapter. The author does an excellent job with this.\n\nAs autumn creeps into the air, the girls rush to prepare for the upcoming ball. It is only a few weeks away. They go into a studying frenzy anticipating the final exam. Whoever does not pass will not attend the ball. Then, they take the exam. After the individual tests, Miri feels confident that she will pass. The some of other girls, on the other hand, are not so assured. Their only redemption is to do well on the question-and-answer portion of the exam. Miri decides that everyone should have an equal opportunity to attend the ball, so she uses quarry-speech to help the girls who do not know an answer. The rest of the girls join in and silently hint answers to each other.\n\nAll of the girls score one hundred percent in the q-and-a portion of the exam thanks to the helpful quarry-speech hints. Because of this, they all pass the exam. Olana could not determine a leader between the top five girls, Katar, Esa, Liana, Bena, and Miri, so she allows everyone to vote for who they want as academy princess. Miri wins in an apparent majority. The title of academy princess reflects the hard work Miri has invested into the academy for the past year."
