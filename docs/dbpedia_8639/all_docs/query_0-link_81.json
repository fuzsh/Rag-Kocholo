        "text": "Hello my friends! I saw that two bloggers I follow, Emily and Daisy, both did The Ultimate Book Tag, and I decided to give it a go too! So here it is!\n\nDo you get sick while reading in the car?\n\nYES üò¶ Ever since I was a baby I‚Äôve gotten car sick in the car‚Ä¶..so I can‚Äôt read in the car‚Ä¶..\n\nBut we sometimes listen to audiobooks as a family in the car üòõ\n\nWhich author‚Äôs writing style is completely unique to you and why?\n\nDaniel Handler aka Lemony Snicket. His way of writing is comical and intriguing, and definitely thought provoking. Man does he have a wonderful way with words!\n\nPretty awesome, right?! Just Google ‚ÄúLemony Snicket quotes and you‚Äôll find a whole bunch more!\n\nBy the way‚Ä¶.have you read The Series of Unfortunate Events? It‚Äôs great!\n\nHarry Potter or the Twilight Saga?\n\nNeither.\n\nDo you carry a book bag? If so, what is in it?\n\nThat would be my purse‚Ä¶..which is actually too small for most books I‚Äôve been reading lately‚Ä¶.ugh‚Ä¶.but I do plan on buying a messenger bag soon‚Ä¶..\n\nOh, and inside is just the necessities‚Ä¶.bunch of tiny notepads, pens, pencils, little owl lip gloss, eos lip gloss, a book (if it fits‚Ä¶otherwise I carry it) yeah‚Ä¶.\n\nDo you smell your books?\n\nOf course! My sister and I are always like ‚ÄúOoh, here smell this one!‚Äù and ‚ÄúRemember such-and-such book? It smelled sooooo good!‚Äù\n\nBooks with or without little illustrations?\n\nEither way, I don‚Äôt have to have them but it doesn‚Äôt bother me if they do‚Ä¶But I don‚Äôt like so much when they show what the character looks like in total detail‚Ä¶.give my imagination some room to work people!\n\nWhich book did you dislike that everyone else loved?\n\nUmm‚Ä¶..I dunno‚Ä¶..\n\nDo you have any funny stories involving books from your childhood? Please share!\n\nThis isn‚Äôt exactly from my childhood‚Ä¶.more my teen hood‚Ä¶.about a year and a half ago‚Ä¶.I was reading and it was really late at night, ok‚Ä¶early morning, like 3 AM. Something in the book was really funny (don‚Äôt remember which book) And you know how everything is super funny when you‚Äôre tired‚Ä¶so I started laughing, but I didn‚Äôt want to way my family so I was cracking up‚Ä¶but silently‚Ä¶.and I started choking, tears running down my face‚Ä¶and I thought ‚ÄúImma die, imma die laughing silently in the middle of the night.‚Äù\n\nWhat is the tiniest book on your shelf?\n\nUh, imma go with the Princess Academy that seems to be the tiniest at the moment, with 314 pages.\n\nWhat is the thickest book on your shelf?\n\nThe Bible. And second would be Between the Lines, with 352 pages.\n\nDo you write as well as you read? Do you see yourself in he future as an author?\n\nMy dream is to be an author‚Ä¶.so I hope I write as well as I read.\n\nWhen did you get into reading?\n\nWhen I learned to read in Kindergarten I became obsessed‚Ä¶.I was little so I didn‚Äôt read many books back then but I read everything I could. The first books that I ever got into were The Hardy Boy books‚Ä¶.I started reading those around 7 & 8 and It got to the point where the librarian would order the next book in the series for me because she knew I would be coming to get it next XD\n\nWhat is your favorite classic book?\n\nSherlock Holmes and the Hound of Baskerville is my favorite novel‚Ä¶.but I love all the Sherlock Holmes books‚Ä¶.\n\nAnd The Dying Detective is my favorite short story.\n\nWhat is a series you know of that is similar to Harry Potter or The Hunger Games?\n\nHmm‚Ä¶I‚Äôve never read Harry Potter‚Ä¶.and the most violent books I‚Äôve read next to The Hunger Games is The Prince and the Pauper and the Crown and Covenant Trilogy‚Ä¶.But the book Ember is ranked as a ‚ÄúBook like The Hunger Games‚Äù But Ember wasn‚Äôt really violent‚Ä¶.weird? Yes, but not violent‚Ä¶.So uhh‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt really know.\n\nVampires or fairies?\n\nFairies‚Ä¶. I guess‚Ä¶..\n\nShapeshifters or angels?\n\nI dunno‚Ä¶.shapeshifters are pretty cool‚Ä¶.and I‚Äôd rather not read a book with angels because they wouldn‚Äôt be properly portrayed‚Ä¶If I want to read about angels I‚Äôll do that in the bible.\n\nSpirits or werewolves?\n\nNeither.\n\nZombies or vampires?\n\nEwww‚Ä¶.they both scare me‚Ä¶. so neither.\n\nIf you were given a book as a present that you had read before and hated, what would you do?\n\nDepending on the book‚Ä¶I would either give it to someone I think would like it‚Ä¶or I would donate it.\n\nIn school, what is your best subject?\n\nReading‚Ä¶duh‚Ä¶.\n\nWhat is a bad habit you always do while blogging?\n\nGetting distracted by Pinterest‚Ä¶.\n\nWhat is your favorite word?\n\nDo you know how hard this is to answer?! There are soooo many words out there‚Ä¶.But..the first word that comes to mind though is Alacrity. Years ago I looked up words all people should know and that was the one word that has stuck in my brain since, and I felt extra cool when I was reading a book and it had the word alacrity and I knew what it meant. üòé\n\nAre you a nerd, dork, or dweeb? or all of the above?\n\nNerd.\n\nLove triangle or forbidden love?\n\nForbidden love. Love triangles frustrate me‚Ä¶.In The Hunger Games‚Ä¶.ughhhh I hated that love triangle‚Ä¶. I always feel bad for one of them. I would much rather two‚Äôs love be forbidden and they have to fight to be together than have a love triangle‚Ä¶And the only love triangle I want is pizza.\n\nFinally: Full-on romance books, or action-packed with a few romance scenes mixed in?\n\nI pick Action-packed and I don‚Äôt mind a bit of romance thrown in‚Ä¶.. üôÇ\n\nAnd there you have it!\n\nThank you so much for stopping by! I hope you enjoyed this post! üôÇ I know I enjoyed writing it! üòÄ\n\nFollow for more Tags, book reviews and fiction! If you have any recommendations let me know in the comments below!\n\nAlso, sorry for no Judicious Julia these past two weeks, I haven‚Äôt been feeling inspired and I don‚Äôt want to mess up the next chapter, so bear with me!"
