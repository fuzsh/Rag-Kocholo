        "text": "April 8, 2020\n\nWas a bit iffy on this one because that cover is the stuff of nightmares. I liked it. Ends on a cliffhanger, bit of a secret identity thing going on. The relationship between the duo was entertaining. A user of darkness masquerading as a princess of light. That is one pain in the butt crown. I’d like to see where this one goes.\n\nFebruary 25, 2020\n\nI did not love the book but, I did not dislike it either. Overall, I quite enjoyed the first book in the series. It was a cross between selection and other similar books with fae mixed into it. The writing seemed jumpy at times and it kinda threw me off a tad. Other than that, it was a fun enough read.\n\nThe concept of malice vs. light magic was interesting. However, I did find myself confused at times. The world building wasn't elaborate but enough to give you an idea. I would have liked to know more about the fae, humans and how it changed completely for the humans. Instead of couple lines explaining things and not getting enough perspective thus, leaving me confused at times. This did not help with character development and thus, making me not as invested in the characters overall.\n\nI liked the FMC, Penne. She was snarky, independent and a strong malice caster in hiding living in the dregs. She gets pulled into the whole princess selection unwittingly and thus, begins her trial for the role of being one of the princesses. The whole process of princess selection left me a bit confused as well. Not much details were provided and even with what was given I kept thinking all they have to do is drink malice and absorb/fight it? And whoever absorbs and lives to see another day - moves on? The whole points given to women moved on also seemed confusing.\n\nPrince Lucas, was ok I suppose. While he was fae and \"different\" from rest of the fae he had his own agenda. I didn't love him or hate him. He was just a dude to me. He did not bring anything awesome to the story. He was on one hand sabotaging Penne because there was a reason for it. But, it also did not seem clear how he was helping her either. He was planning to overthrow the fae but the reasoning seemed kind of weak and I couldn't see his vision for \"why\" to end it. He wanted Penne to rebel but again, we failed to see his depth for why? Overall, he was good enough character.\n\nRomance, well, this book is not heavy on it which is good. There is building attraction but again, the depth of development overall, lacked for me. I could see them together. There is another character involved which was a surprise as I didn't know this was a real character until much later.\n\nIt does end with a cliffhanger.\n\n***I received an arc from the author for a review***\n\nFebruary 4, 2020\n\nI could not wait to get my hands on this book since the first day I laid eyes on the cover!! It’s absolutely stunning! And this story is just everything! I read it in one sitting! It’s my favorite read by this author, and I have read all her books! I can not wait to get my hands on book 2!!\n\nFebruary 2, 2020\n\nI really enjoyed this one and kept reading when I should have been doing other things, haha! Penne is a great heroine, I liked her from the start, and the chemistry between her and Lucas kept me turning the pages. I was a bit confused by some of the world building, but it made more sense as the book went along and I'm very much looking forward to book two!\n\nMay 27, 2020\n\nI received a free audiobook copy from the author in exchange for a review. All opinions are my own.\n\nIf you liked the Selection, you NEED to read this book!!\n\nPenne has lived her life in the Dregs, or the bad side of town. As a Malice caster, there isn't much more she can look forward to, especially with the Fae in charge due to their hatred of Malice. But when Penne is selected by one of the Crown Princess crowns, she's in for a new world at Crown Princess Academy. If she wins, she becomes the Crown Princess and one step closer to her goal of overthrowing the Fae.\n\nThis story alternates between Penne's POV and Crown Prince Lucas. I loved the banter between these two and the fact that they're basically working towards the same goal but don't know it. It was so funny to see them dance around each other, try to manipulate each other all while being ridiculously attracted to each other.\n\nCrown Princess Academy was a fun story that constantly made me smile. I loved this world and the characters. I cannot wait to see what will happen in book 2!\n\nApril 30, 2020\n\nPros:\n\n- An interesting set-up with a strong main character.\n\n- A cool concept for the world building.\n\n- A main plot you can support.\n\n- Good descriptions. Easy to picture the scenes and characters.\n\nCons:\n\n- Needs an editor. A lot of stuff spell check isn't going to catch and after seeing the variety of errors I think someone who's going to really go over this with experience is needed. There were some typos like \"relam\" for realm and \"been\" instead of seen. ex. \"I'd never been such a creature.\" Or once calling the character Laurel the wrong name(Lauren).\n\nThere were cases of words being used inaccurately or the wrong spelling being used \"hold the reigns\" instead of \"hold the reins\".\n\nAt one point blind-sighted is used instead of blindsided. It's possible the author doesn't actually know that is an error but I suppose it could be a typo. Same thing with straightening being written as straitening.\n\nSome missing words ex. he should be before wiped. \"... making no attempt to retract his fangs as wiped his mouth...\" Or in some cases an extra word was added. \"I hadn't let her to put any paint on my face.\"\n\nSome very awkward sentences like, \"A faint smile hinted at my lips.\" Smiles don't hint at lips. Pretty sure something like \"My lips hinted at a faint smile.\" or something along that line.\n\n\"I find it no surprise if each of you conjures the icon of your Academy House\" (should be I'll find or I'd find as she's speaking about anticipating a future event.)\n\nOne character says, \"I apologize to interrupt...\" Another good example of some of the awkward lines that tripped me up because I can't say 100% sure that it's \"wrong\" grammatically speaking but people don't tend to phrase things that way. They'd say \"I apologize for interrupting.\" Same thing with characters peering up to a person instead of up at a person. \"I had one week before I was about to have to trust him...\" Pretty sure that should be something like \"I had one week before I had to trust him.\"\n\nSo many times I sat down reading lines out loud to see if they came out less awkward and if anything it made it worse. I finally stopped noting specific examples because there were too many and I felt I had enough to provide examples for a review. Suffice to say that this could benefit from an editor.\n\n- Characters needed more work. People like Olli, Jilly, the king, Zizi, Laurel, Sorin, Melinda, and Rylie who were important enough to the MC or the plot(or were around enough) should've been fleshed out better. While the prince and Penne(I had a horrible time not picturing pasta every time i read her name) were well-developed and had motives and personalities, the rest just seemed to get slapped with some surface traits and that was it.\n\nFor example. Laurel is brought onto the scene once. Yanked out of the crown and bam she's there. And then she promptly gets sent back and she talks a few times in Penne's head but that's it. What's the point? Why are we adding more weird conjurations if they're just going to get sidelined?\n\nRylie and Penne had a lot of potential to be allies/friends but we hardly get to see Rylie at all. Melinda makes for a pretty weak \"mean girl rival\" as everything is pretty surface level when it comes to what she does/says.\n\n- This was the biggest issue for me. Plot issues. In no particular order here they are...\n\n1. \"I should have hated myself that one of the Candidates had already figured out that I was an imposter.\" (typo on impostor isn't mine)\n\nShe says this at 60% . . . and I'm like uh yeah. Because Penne goes into this with no plan, no preparation, and she frankly SUCKS at blending in. There is nothing about her that fits into this. She doesn't talk or act like any of the other Elite and quite frankly she makes zero attempt to blend in. I honestly was waiting to find out that the king knew the whole time that she was a fraud because it was the only explanation for her not being found out.\n\nIt required some major suspension of disbelief that a character who is trying to infiltrate an elite group makes no real effort to blend in. It's almost like she didn't care if she failed or not.\n\n2. Fae/Human and DNA or whatever.\n\nSo the Fae can't have magical children anymore. So the Fae king goes and picks up a human chick to have a kid with. Okay, so now we have a half fae/half human prince(which it's ALWAYS a male. How does that work? What happens if the queen miscarries or has a girl? How do they ensure that it's always a boy that's born? This is never explained.). Now that kid grows up and in 19 years he does the same thing. We now have a 1/4 fae and 3/4 human prince.\n\nSee where I'm going for this? How the heck are we who knows how many generations into this mess without someone thinking huh, we call ourselves Fae but at this point our Fae blood is so diluted that we're really way more human than Fae. I thought it was weird the prince thought of himself as Fae and not human considering that even if he had been the first in this change he would've been 50/50.\n\nNot to mention that uh they'd stop LOOKING like Fae after awhile. We are they still sporting the pointy ears and fangs? Shouldn't those genes be so watered down that chances of having them, especially in full pointyness would be slim?\n\n- The Academy.\n\n“Oh, right, Orientation Dinner. It can be a bit hard the first time.” Sighing, I clutched the edge of the bed. “How long have you worked here?” She bit her lip before replying. “Three years.\"\n\nWait . . . does Orientation Dinner happen for just the Queen's class or the whole Academy? Because it seems like it's specific to the queen's class. Everything about this story hints at that class being at a whole new level. And if that class only takes place every 19 years HOWWWW could Ollie say \"oh yeah it's hard the first time\" considering she's only been there 3 years?\n\nAnd if it is universal how are they providing a cover up for this? It's mentioned that all these girls are oblivious to the fact that they'll be killed off one by one and how it happens. I can see keeping a lid on things if it's a once every 19 years thing but if this is happening every semester? You'd be killing off your entire nobility. At least all of the females.\n\nAlso for all of the hype about it being \"the worst\". . . like worse than being a brood mare in the human malice section of the world, it fails to shock. There's one class. ONE CLASS where they're taught to conjure something while touching a magic artifact. They're given a glass of the Malice which kills one of the 7? girls at the dinner. But we already knew that the whole class ends up dead so losing one at the start isn't shocking. And then after the one class they're given another drink.\n\nThen after that they're allowed to wander in the gardens, sparring room, and music room. We see nothing with the garden thing, we see Rylie and Penne play/sing one song together in the music room, and then we have one underwhelming duel between Penne and Melinda.\n\nNothing exciting or impressive. And that's it for the next TWO WEEKS. Then they're given a score based on that one day of wandering through those rooms(where nothing horrible happens and music/gardening/dueling are all fairly benign and normal activities. And that's the final! They're done. They're given one more glass of Malice there at the end.\n\nI was like wow... that was a lot of nothing.\n\nThe thing with Steel and Zizi was also completely out of left field and felt more like a hey this book is ending and I need a twist to provide a reason for a second book.\n\nAnd the ending where the entire freaking class(except Penne) dies(or is dying) while she takes out the portal was . . . like really? There's no attempt from either \"hero\" to try and save these girls because they must sacrifice them for the greater good. Now I can see that from Lucas as despite his one redeeming quality(wanting to end this whole evil cycle) he is overall a not so nice person. He's kind of a creep that doesn't do anything really to suggest he's a decent person.\n\nBut Penne the people rescuer is just chill with this? It was a complete personality switch for her and the callous loss of life left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nI think in fact the whole ending scene/climax was shoddily done. After all that build up it was exactly what you expected with little emotion/detail/time. All the girls had to drink what apparently was a deadly dose of malice(so why did the tests matter if they hardly changed how strong the drink was?) and Penne did exactly what she had planned(mixing magics) without any struggle. And in a few short lines takes out the gate while it's casually mentioned that the other girls are dying around her.\n\nLike that's what I was waiting for? The climax/finale that took up like one page. There was no meat to it. It was just over before it even started. And it felt so unsatisfying.\n\nSummary:\n\nA great idea that had a lot of potential but unfortunately needed some type of developmental editor to work out the story bugs and definitely needed a line editor to sort out the SPaG issues. Story needed too much work for me to continue with the series.\n\nFebruary 24, 2021\n\nI was so pleasantly surprised by this book! I loved every bit of it. The premise is essentially princess hunger games + ACOTAR. I couldn’t put this book down, there was so much action and suspense that I devoured it in one day. The princess academy, the White Castle, the beautiful dresses, and the enemies-to-lovers romance all enchanted my reading experience.\n\nPenne irritated me a bit by being another anti-feminine heroine. She hated that she was being considered for Crown Princess, she preferred a dagger to a crown, and often expressed her distaste for the color pink. These heroines are not unique, they are overdone in YA and I find them sexist. Despite all of that, Penne was actually a likable main character. She had dignity and did not falter under the pressure of the Crown Prince wooing her. She kept her own agenda and was very talented in magic which I could only admire.\n\nI absolutely cannot wait for books 2 & 3!\n\nJanuary 19, 2020\n\nARC received from author\n\nFrom the synopsis this sounds like The Selection series with fairies. It isn’t at all. Despite the marriage competition it is really original and is more focused on the girl’s mastery of magic and less of marrying the prince.\n\nI can’t say I loved this book, but I didn’t hate it. I enjoyed it. I’m not sure if I would read book 2. I would be interested in knowing where the story goes, but at the same time I already sense where it will go (rebellion, romance, etc.).\n\nSome of my dislike of this book came from my confusion. I think this originated in the writing style. I found the book didn’t explain a lot of terminology when using it. The book started and I couldn’t get a clear image as to what was happening. In the end, I think better descriptions were needed. Once past the beginning, things cleared up for me. The Academy part of the story was interesting and fun. I enjoyed that; the classes, the building attraction between her and the prince.\n\nI liked the main character’s spunk and really have no complaints about her, but I’m unsure how I feel about the prince. Despite his placement, I found he didn’t impact the story in a large way. The romance is still building, which I appreciate, so there wasn’t much there. He’s planning a rebellion with her, but tells her nothing except fail. I hope he plays a greater part in later books because really, this story could have existed without him. If she created the same plan, and knew how the drinks worked, then all the same events could have occurred.\n\nAll in all, good book. Enjoyable, but not great.\n\nFebruary 25, 2020\n\nThis book was unique and overall a fun and easy read but with a few pretty large flaws. The world building was all over the place and it was hard to follow at times. The characters could have been more developed as well as their motivations. I will most likely read the second one in hopes that some of these things improve.\n\nJanuary 31, 2020\n\nLoving this series already!\n\nThis is definitely different from all Flower's others works.\n\nDevoured doesn't even cover what I did. The worldbuilding is amazing. The characters are unique and relatable. As in if Fae were real and all. But they kept the pages turning and you honestly don't even notice how much you've read. The pace obviously is fast but I didn't find it lacking in anything.\n\nBring on book two!\n\nJune 24, 2020\n\nDNF for me. I made it half-way through and just couldn’t anymore. I very rarely read books when they are just 1 book into a trilogy and usually put them on me wish list to read once everything’s been released. However, the plot for this one intrigued me enough that I decided to read this one now.\n\nBoy was I disappointed.\n\nThe overall writing was good (needed an editor in the worst way though) so why the DNF?? Ugh, the female MC.\n\nTo quote Hermione Granger: “What. An. Idiot.”\n\nThe plot layout and explanation of the realms and how Penne (seriously? A pasta? It was super distracting) was a tad hard to follow as it was jumpy and not well explained verbally. No biggie; there’s enough there that is understandable to be able to fill in the confusing pieces.\n\nOnce Penne gets to the Crown Princess Academy she has a plan to blend in and take down. But does she do this? Nope. Doesn’t even ATTEMPT to try to fit in. In fact, she could not stand out more if she tried.\n\nShe couldn’t even keep her mouth shut during the orientation dinner where she should have sat, listened, observed, etc. Omg. I wanted to reach into the book and slap the stupid out of her. Then she was surprised that the Crown Prince didn’t step in to defend her. Hello??? Why would he? Unlike our moron in the lead role, he knows there is a time and a place and a game to be played.\n\nIt did not get better from there and I just got to the point where I couldn’t take the idiocy anymore (the Prince does not help her to try to make it seem like it’s something she just needs to work on).\n\nSuch a shame because the description on Amazon had such promise.\n\nOctober 6, 2020\n\nNot my cup of tea I guess\n\nIt just throws you right in, which normally isn't a problem, but I was pretty confused at first. Nothing was really explained until it kind of pieces together later. That can be fine in some stories, but I didn't think it was particularly right in this one.\n\nApart from that.. You get two perspectives. The Fae Crown Prince and a human named Penelope. They're supposed to be on opposite ends, the Fae with light and the human suffering in darkness at whatever fate the fae leave them to. But in this story these two characters actually have a common goal.\n\nThat's what the story ends up being about. That goal. They don't learn that they have the same goal until almost the end, and then shortly after what was supposed to complete the goal happens.\n\nThat really all sounds interesting and it could've been, but I didn't particularly like how it was done. The writing itself was fine, but just some parts of the story I definitely could've lived without.. Even though they did end up making a little more sense father in.\n\nIf I didn't try to finish books I got a certain amount through... I probably would've stopped around 56%~ of the way through.\n\nDespite the interesting premise and a decent amount of things happening throughout the book I just wasn't invested and really didn't like the characters.\n\nDecember 18, 2023\n\nFans of Holly Black will love this deadly princess competition story in academy setting\n\nPenne is a Malice Caster and a cunning thief in the Dregs where humans wihtout light magic are forced to live. When she steals something she’s meant to hand over but doesn’t, using it to liberate one of her friends from a breeding house, things turn interesting. Next, she finds herself in a princess competition, fighting for her life while the prince has treacherous plans of his own.\n\nI quite enjoyed this book - the feels were like Holly Black’s Folk of the Air series - fae cruelty, compulson magic, humans picked on. I liked feisty Penelope aka Penne - fighting to keep her Malice powers while integrating the Light and her two fairy familiars Zizi and Laurel were adorable. With Prince Lucas as well as King of Malice having set their sights on Penne, this is turning a little bit RH and call me morally grey, but I’d pick the dark dude anytime what with the “light” prince sabotaging the FMC all the way but leaning in for kisses?!? I’ll chalk it up to needs must for Penne, but hoppe she picks right in the next book.\n\nRecommended for lovers of fae lore, deadly princess tournaments and those who consider good/evil or malice/light mere labels that need careful scrutiny as to its essence before passing judgment.\n\nJuly 1, 2021\n\n“I expected something more yet the story wasn’t bad just not great. The plot has lots of potential but sadly there’s nothing great about it. Confusing, random and not so logic. Kind of difficult to explain without giving details but there wasn’t a good perception of time. When Penne met Prince Lucas for the first time I was so excited about that moment it seems like there was going to be a hot relationship between them with the addition of the malice versus light but sadly there wasn’t at all. Prince Lucas was somehow different but yet as someone who wanted to changed how thing were working he could have try to save them all and not just one. I mean the whole “sacrifice a few for the greatest good” I get it but he could have try more and Penne well she lacked as FMC too. Plus if you (like me) are expecting romance and steam well that’s not gonna happen aside form a perv that has zero point, trust me. The attraction was there yeah but nothing else it was more like a game rather than something that could be a long term relationship. Lastly, that epilogue of was out of nowhere like seriously? What was the connection with the ending? Nothing al all! Or is it going to be a love triangle? Like I said, no sense at all.”\n\nMay 16, 2023\n\nA fae prince set on bringing down his kingdom from within …\n\nA human, having infiltrated the kingdom with plans to do the same …\n\nBut neither realizes they’re on the same side? Let the games begin.\n\nHow can anyone resist reading and/or listening to this book with THIS COVER?!?!?!? It’s definitely one of my faves of all-time. (But don’t let it fool you—this kingdom has been touched by darkness.)\n\nThere is so much going on here, not the least of which were the stunning visuals, thanks to this author’s talent of painting beautiful ‘mind pictures’ as she writes …\n\n👑 Fae realm setting.\n\n🦋 Royals.\n\n👑 Magic.\n\n🦋 Biiiiig attitudes.\n\n👑 Epic vocabulary designed to suit the world.\n\n🦋 Amazing world-building.\n\n👑 Academy vibes. (Specifically: Malice Academy—how intriguing does that sound?)\n\n🦋 Trials.\n\n👑 A reluctant, and rebellious princess candidate.\n\n🦋 A sassy pixie.\n\n👑 Malice with its own personality.\n\n🦋 A wicked cliffhanger—this one’s quite fun.\n\n👑 Epic world-building.\n\nOverall:\n\n5 stars. ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️\n\nAudio:\n\nI hadn’t previously heard of this narrator, to my memory—she sounds amazing! Great voice, I absolutely love her attitude. I feel like she really brought Penne to life—well done.\n\nJuly 6, 2021\n\nThis was my first book by A.J. Flowers and I will say it did not disappoint. Don't let the pretty cover fool you though as this story does have a bit of a dark twist to it which I really enjoyed. The main character Penne (yes like the pasta) was a wonderful breath of fresh air. She is headstrong, independent and a powerful Malice Castor who gets sucked into the \"princess\" lifestyle when a magical crown marks her as a candidate for the Crown Princess Academy. I was unsure of Lucas and still kind of am, and I think that's because of how he was written. He's the fae Crown Prince but he's not like all the other fae and although his backstory gives us an idea of his intentions, I feel like there needs to be more to his story for what his goal is. I loved these two's interactions and was so happy to not have an insta-love story come out. I also really enjoyed the characters of Zizi, Steel and Laurel who although all minor characters each have their own bit of flair about them. I look forward for books two and three to come out so I can see how thing cliffhanger ends!\n\nMarch 31, 2023\n\nI kind of felt like the whole Academy premise was flimsy. The only glimpse of students other than the Queen's Class was at the very end. Why not just make it a small elite group or something? And they only attended like 2 classes. It just didn't seem relevant at all in the grand scheme of the story.\n\nI also did not understand Lukas' plan at all until probably the 50 or 60% mark. It should have been explained earlier. Honestly a lot of the plot felt a bit half-baked, and I struggled to under what the point of it was.\n\nLastly, the girl on girl hate and slut shaming is old and tired in this day and age.\n\nThere were some parts that I liked and the overall direction of the story was actually really interesting. I feel it has potential. It sadly just felt like a flimsy, trope-y YA book that I think I'm just too old for these days.\n\nMay 13, 2020\n\nPenne is a great heroine. She is a powerful Malice caster and she has to hide her true identity while at the academy. Can she survive her time at the academy?\n\nBaby boy Fae, Lucas is the sexy Fae prince who has his eye on Penne. I loved the interaction between Penne and Lucas. I enjoyed learnings about the world and it’s humans, dregs, and Fae. I thought it was a interesting story. While it does leave you in a cliffhanger I don’t think it’s such a bad cliffhanger. Just leaves you wanting more.\n\nI listened to the audiobook and I enjoyed listening to Carolyn Lee. She brought another level to the narration. I thought she was a perfect blend for Penne and the other two that are in Penne’s head so to speak. Looking forward to the next installment.\n\nFebruary 16, 2021\n\nI loved the characters, the world, all of it! The competitive dynamics between the other candidates was excellent. It's got exactly what I like about books with any sort of trials or tests in them.\n\nOne of my favorite parts was definitely the worldbuilding. The world is straight out of a story book, but in a wonderfully flipped way.\n\nAnd there’s Lucas! I’m so glad we had chapters from his perspective because they really make his character come to life. Seeing into his motivations really has me rooting for him. I hope he and Penne can tear down the system--together.\n\nAnd at the same time, I'm intrigued by our mystery man who is poised to have a big role in book 2 (come on, July!).\n\nJuly 27, 2023\n\nI’m not fond of how the MC and ML got together. He’s just beautiful because he’s fae. He’s done nothing but manipulate you but you welcome him with open arms? Really? Girl, the red flags are thereeeee, are you color blinded by your glittery pink dress?\n\nSteel is a mystery to me. How in the world did he decide all of a sudden that she’ll be his malice queen? What prompted this? What in the world is happening?\n\nThere is a roundabout way the author could’ve done this story, opening up more information/ details, but I guess that’s why they decided to do a trilogy but I’m not sure this book even warrants that. It’s too fast paced and too short. Saying too much and too little at the same time. Could’ve done better, but oh well.\n\nI may read the next book. Or I may not. Let’s just see.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nMay 19, 2020\n\nDo you love dark fae? This deceptively light, airy cover hides a delightfully complex story with a ferociously loyal main character. Penne’s life has been tough, but with her ability to wield Malice, she’s had both freedom and prestige. Lee does a great job capturing her disbelief when Penne finds herself accidentally enrolled at the Crown Princess Academy, learning to utilize light magic that could destroy her Malice, her very identity if she’s not careful. With malicious Fae, Monsters in the woods, and rivals for the crown willing to do whatever it takes to see Penne fail, this is one intriguing adventure from start to finish. I cannot wait to listen to book two!\n\nAugust 2, 2020\n\nCrown Princess Academy, was not what I expected. The main characters and plot was darker than the beautiful colorful cover eludes too. I enjoyed the face pace of the story, likable characters, and quick humor. Although I knew there would be a cliff hanger, I was left disappointed by the conclusion. I feel like so much more should have happened before the end; mostly the connections between the \"love\" interest. Yes, I was rooting for one suitor over the other by the ending, but lust does not equal love. Other than some stolen kisses and physical attraction, relationships were not really developed. Still, I want to read what happens next when the sequel is released Summer 2021. Rating 3.5/5\n\nJuly 5, 2021\n\nPenne was brought up as a child of darkness but didn’t want that for her friend. When accepting a job to go to the Kingdom of light she breaks her friend out a home and takes her on the job. But Penne is mistakenly nominated as a tribute for the House of Roses where she drops her friend for safe keeping. Penne’s hatred for the Light Fae keeps her going even against the Crown Prince Lucas who just may be of use to her. Lucas dislikes the way his father is running the Kingdom so he sets out to destroy it and recognises that Penne is the one to help him. Together they can make a great team but there are things afoot to ruin that which is that cliffhanger that is continued in book 2.\n\nJuly 1, 2021\n\nPenne and Lucas are , completely different from each other in many ways (one being human and the other is Fae is the first one) but they do have some things in common. Both think that they are going to take advantage of the other but that changes when they see that they do have things that they both believe are right or wrong. Feelings are starting to change and surprises are around the corner for them. I do hope that we learn more about Penne's childhood But otherwise this was an enjoyable read\n\nDecember 2, 2023\n\nDon't let the cover and title fool you. The world in this book was not full of butterflies and rainbows. Yes, our heroine wears a frilly pink dress, but this is a serious case of don't judge a book by its cover.\n\nI love stories with cutthroat competitions, which is what drew me into this. I wasn't a fan of the use of male/female (\"this female\" or \"that male\" as opposed to using pronouns or other descriptors), but that's something that I've come to expect from fae stories. I really enjoyed the use of Malice and Light and I'm interested to see where the series goes.\n\nJuly 5, 2021\n\nI really enjoyed the concept behind this book. I am hoping for more world building in book 2 as things look like we are going to move into some large scale stuff based on the ending. I also enjoyed the fact that Penne didn't just immediately fall head over heels for the prince and in fact doesn't trust him at all. There's magic, intrigue, death, and danger rolled into a complex world I want to know more about.\n\nOctober 17, 2021\n\nDo not let the cover fool you!\n\nI was so skeptical when I started to read this and I was left totally surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I found I couldn’t put the book down.\n\nThis book is great if you like a strong female character with not too much lovey dovey stuff involved. As well as fantasy mixed with adventure. The twist and turns made it a capturing read, well for me anyway. I have the next book on pre-order!\n\nMay 13, 2020\n\nI really enjoyed myself getting lost to the creative world the author took me to. The story had intrigued me from the beginning to the end. There is a cliffhanger and I can’t wait for the installment to be available on audiobook. In my honest opinion I recommend. And the narrator did a fantastic job as well in great pace and bring the characters to life.\n\nAugust 24, 2020\n\nThis is one of those books you can’t judge by the cover. Penne is not a character who is all about frills and lace, and I loved the conflict of Malice and Light. One thing I wish this book would’ve explored a bit more was Penne’s relationship with the other girls in the academy, but I still found this to be a great read. Can’t wait to get my hands on the next installment!"
