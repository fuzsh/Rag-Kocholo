        "text": "An Original Kensington Musical: Princess Academy\n\nAdapted from the novel by SHANNON HALE\n\nBook by KATIE BROWN and TONI BUTLER\n\nMusic and Lyrics by KATIE BROWN with JEFF BROWN and MICHAEL BEARDEN\n\nArranged and Orchestrated by MICHELLE WILLIS\n\nAn Interview with Shannon Hale:\n\nBased on the Newbery Honor winning novel, Princess Academy by Shannon Hale, this heart-warming original Kensington musical of self-discovery will be back on our stage in December, 2021!\n\nPrincess Academy Summary:\n\nHigh on the side of rocky Mount Eskel, far from the valleys where gardens are green and lush, where lowlanders make laws, Miri’s family has lived forever, pounding a living from the stone of the mountain itself. For as long as she can remember, Miri has dreamed of working alongside the other villagers in the quarries of her beloved mountainside. But Miri has never been allowed to work there, perhaps, she thinks, because she is so small or maybe her Pa doesn’t think she can do it.\n\nThen word comes from the valley that the king’s priests have divined Mount Eskel to be the home of the prince’s bride-to-be—the next princess. The prince himself will travel to the village to choose her, but first all eligible girls must attend a makeshift mountain academy to prepare themselves for royal possibility.\n\nAt the school, Miri soon finds herself confronted by bitter competition among the girls and her own conflicting desires to be chosen by the prince and her blooming relationship with her best friend, Peder. Yet when danger comes to the academy and threatens all their lives, it is Miri who must find a way to save her classmates.\n\nThis production is being directed by Toni Butler and will be accompanied by a 30-piece orchestra directed by Michelle Willis on our main stage.\n\nTake a Peak at this beautiful production:\n\nDirector’s Note\n\nWhen I first read Shannon Hale’s Princess Academy, I knew it needed to be a musical; music was part of the story’s fabric! Shannon and I used to participate in community theatre when we were teens. So, I approached my friend with the idea of writing a musical based on her award winning book about thirteen years ago… and five years ago we produced the world premiere of Princess Academy, the Musical! When COVID created huge obstacles for theatres around the world, I asked my board if we could return to Mt. Eskel this December; a safe, comfortable place. So here we are again!\n\nThe journey of Miri’s self-discovery is touching and inspiring. My hope for this new Mt. Eskel family is that they will also be empowered by good, hard choices. I hope they will walk with more confidence knowing that they are exactly the right person to make anything happen in their lives: “Look no further than your hand/ Make a choice and take a stand.” And sometimes life may not be what you expect, but exactly what you need: “Maybe Mt. Eskel didn’t need a princess, just an academy.”\n\nWe have loved creating this original musical! It has been a beautiful journey from beginning to end. We would love to share this musical with you (20 teen girls in the lead roles!!). Contact us if you would like to bring Mt. Eskel to your schools or communities (contact@KensingtonTheatre.org). A special thanks to Shannon for letting us put her beloved characters on stage. Mt. Eskel has certainly become an unforgettable home to our Kensington Family!\n\n~Toni Butler\n\nDirector, Princess Academy\n\nPrincess Academy performed December 9-18, 2021\n\nPrincess Academy Cast\n\nMiriZada Harris\n\nYoung Miri/Village GirlEmmy Douglas\n\nPederIsaac Butler\n\nPrince Steffan/Village BoyLucas Morley\n\nPaDerek Wayman\n\nDoterJen Kroff\n\nOsSeth Goldklang\n\nOlana MansdaughterKatie Brown\n\nAcademy Servants/Village GirlsBethany Willis, Emma Smart, Luci Sanford, Elise Farmer, Hailey Voss, Beklynn Bennett, Dempsey Tatum\n\nMardaAnnaLeah Mecham\n\nMarda's FriendsNicole Walsman, Shara Judd\n\nDanTrenton Conover\n\nChief Delegate/Village Man/Jin (Katar's Pa)Isaac Carrillo\n\nInge (Frid's Ma)Cydney Farmer\n\nKatarMalea Hyte\n\nBrittaMadeline Steffany\n\nBenaAlyssa Crow\n\nLianaKarlie Parrish\n\nLiseNicole Merrell\n\nGertiSayla Butler\n\nFridAubrey Andersen\n\nEsaAmbree Poulter\n\nJettaKaylee Arsenault\n\nJetarLiesel Robinson\n\nTonnaAdria Kroff\n\nHeltaAriel Tegan\n\nIngarKaylee Ray\n\nKariAnna Jones\n\nSivAlexa Parrish\n\nIdaGrace Colvin\n\nMonaCamryn Cooper\n\nUnniKira Willis\n\nSagaMaggie Hale\n\nFinn/Ball Guest/DogfaceJeffrey Conover\n\nAlmond/Ball Guest/One-Eyed BanditAustin Curtis\n\nEnrik/Ball Guest/Bandit/Village BoyLogan Miller\n\nTrader 1/Ball Guest/Bandit/Village BoyBritton Forman\n\nJakob/Ball Guest/OnorAlex Draney\n\nJans/Ball Guest/BanditHunter Florence\n\nYork/Ball Guest/BanditHarlan Olson\n\nLukas/Ball Guest/BanditGavin Walburger\n\nAxel/Ball Guest/BanditMason Harris\n\nElias/Ball Guest/BanditLiam Allison\n\nMads/Ball Guest/BanditEthan Morris\n\nLew/Ball Guest/BanditAiden Curtis\n\nNiklas/Ball Guest/BanditAedan Douglas\n\nVillage MenBryce Perkins, Geoff Douglas\n\nVillage WomenKiely Clemens, Emily Wayman, Megan Perkins, Sarah Barrows, Clara Eddleman\n\nVillage BoyEthan Brown\n\nVillage GirlsBaylee Parrish, Jenna Lindgren, Olivia Eddleman, Aubrey Enger, Cali Douglas, Gwen Harris\n\nSoldier 1Jacob Berry\n\nSoldier 2Sterling Turner\n\nSoldiersElliott Berry, Koen Paskett"
