        "text": "Q: Overall impression of what Vladek went through in Auschwitz and how it changed him. How has it affected Artie and Francoise?\n\nA: My overall impression of what Vladek went through in Auschwitz is that he went through a really hard time. During the war there was barely enough food for everyone. So now Vladek values everything that is given to him, due to the things that happened to him during the war. The things that he experience during the war has changed him to be a man that takes value in what he has and to know that not a lot of people have these things. The things that Vladek has gone through have not only had a big deal on him but also on Francoise and Artie. They both feel bad for Vladek and they sometimes get annoyed by him. They feel bad that he experienced all the things he experienced. I think they know even though he can out alive from the war, there was still a part of him that was killed in a way.\n\nLinks:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ArtSpiegelman/\n\n-Chapter 1-\n\nQ: This is a graphic memoir. A graphic memoir tells a person’s life through text and drawings. Why does Art Spiegelman use mice instead of people to portray the characters in the story? What do the mice represent?\n\nA: Art Spiegelman used mice instead of people because they are dirty and savage. The mice represent the Jews who the Nazis and Hitler hate.\n\n-Chapter 2-\n\nQ: Why does Ms. Stefanska go to jail? What role did Anja play in Ms. Stefanska’s going to jail?\n\nA: Ms. Stefranska goes to jail because Anja was sending Communist messages to an old friend. In the time of panic Anja ran and asked Ms. Stefanska to hide the evidence from the Gestapo. However, the Gestapo searched Ms. Stefanska and they found the notes and took her to jail.\n\n-Chapter 3-\n\nQ: What does Vladek mean on page 50, when he says, “Well at least I did something.” Do you believe that he is justified in feeling this way? Explain.\n\nA: I think that he is justified because he did what he did to protect his country and their people during the war.\n\n-Chapter 4-\n\nQ: Although Jews were allowed only limited rations under the Nazi occupation, Vladek manages to circumvent these restrictions for a while. What methods does he use to support himself and his family?\n\nA: Vladek sold Anja’s family treasures for food in the black market. He also had to get things from friends who owed him favors.\n\n-Chapter 5-\n\nQ: How did Vladek care for Anja after the destruction of the Srodula ghetto? Contrast his behavior toward his first wife, during the worst years of the war, with the way he now treats Mala.\n\nA: Vladek was very sensitive and supportive to Anja. He told her that he need her and that they would struggle to survive together. On the other hand, he treats Mala badly, because he thinks that she only wants his money, but he does not truly love her.\n\n-Chapter 6-\n\nQ: Why does Artie call his father a murderer? Is he justified? Who else has he called a murderer, and why?\n\nA: Artie calls his father a murderer because Vladek destroyed all of his mother’s diaries and memories. Artie’s mom killed herself and his father destroyed all her memories. So in a way I do believe Artie is justified. He has also called his mother a murderer because she held on to him so tightly, and he always felt guilty and blamed himself for his mother’s death.\n\nDear Mom,\n\nToday is a day that we celebrate all the moms in America, but I only have one mommy, so today is only for you. Today is a day to celebrate everything you have done for me and my younger siblings. If I could pick out the perfect mom, I think I would miss out on the most perfect mom God has given me.\n\nEverything you do for me mommy, I appreciate them, not only on this day but every single day. Not many people in this world have the opportunity to have a mother, but I am so privileged to have a mom like you.\n\nI know that sometimes I drive you crazy and annoy you, but I am just a kid growing up. I also know that sometimes I might not be the best daughter, sister or person, but I am still learning from the best.\n\nI love you mommy and I hope and pray that when God gives me the chance to be a mother, that I will be half as good as a mom as you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nYour Daughter,\n\nJennifer\n\nPublished: October 16, 2008\n\nPublisher: Dutton Books\n\nWritten By: John Green\n\nGenre: Mystery, Young-Adult Fiction\n\nLength: 345 pages\n\nStars: 5 out of 5\n\nMargo and Quentin were childhood friends, doing what kids do. One day while riding their bikes around the park, and they had found a rotting, dead man under the tree. (Both Quentin and Margo where nine years old when this happened). After they had found the dead body, they ran home to tell their parents. After seeing this, Quentin wants to just push the whole thing out from his mind, but Margo finds out that the man had killed himself and she wonders why he would do that. Eight years went by, and all Margo and Quentin ever did was exchange silent “hello’s” in the hallway at school. So when one night Margo just randomly appears at Quentin’s window, he is shocked. Margo asks Quentin to go on a revenge trip, to get anyone that ever wronged her. Loving Margo so much, Quentin comes along, and they vandalize houses and cars using spray paint and fish; and to top it all, they sneaked into Sea World. After the revenge spree that Margo and Quentin had, Quentin discovers that Margo is missing. Detectives had said that she had been missing for almost four weeks, and that she was going to come back. Quentin knowing Margo, knew that she was gone forever, but was still determined to find her. Margo left a series of of clues for Quentin, so right before his high school graduation, Quentin goes on an adventure to find Margo.\n\nTo find out if Quentin ever finds Margo, you can read “Paper Towns” by John Green yourself, and you can find it at these stores:\n\nGoogle Play- $9.99\n\nBarnes & Noble- $ 7.60\n\nAmazon- $7.99\n\nThe part that I like about the book is how each character were developed. All the characters in the book were very different, but they were also very “real”. I really enjoyed how each character had their own layers to them.\n\nThere wasn’t a part in the book that I disliked because it was a really good book.\n\nPublished: 2005\n\nPublisher: Scholastic Inc.\n\nWritten By: Sharon Hale\n\nGenre: Fantasy\n\nLength: 314 pages\n\nStars: 4 out of 5\n\nPrincess Academy is a book about a 14-year old girl named Miri. Miri and her family live at the top of a mountain called Mount Eskel. Mri always wanted to work with the other villagers by the quarry. Miri never got a chance to work there because she was too small. Then when Miri thought nothing could get better, the king’s priests said that the prince’s bride-to-be (the next princess) would come from Mount Eskel. The prince would go up to Mount Eskel to hand pick his future bride, but before anything could happen all the girls that lived on Mount Eskel had to go to a temporary academy, to prepare themselves for the royal life.\n\nWhen Miri got to the princess academy, she always some how caught herself facing both the resentful competition from the other girls there, and her own conflicted desire to be chosen by the prince. When danger came to the academy, it was Miri, who had been named the tiny mountain flower at the princess academy, that had to save herself and her fellow classmates, and the future that each one of those girls at the academy, eagerly wanted to be theirs.\n\nThe thing that I most defiantly liked about the book is how brave Miri was. She wanted to be the next princess but when danger came to the academy, she was the one that rose up to the occasion and protected not only her future but the futures of all the girls in the academy. This taught me that no matter how much I want something to be mines, if danger comes not only my way but to the people I grew up with, I will forget about my desire to have what I want and protect not only myself but the people around me.\n\nThe thing that I disliked about the book was the way the author set the story up. Having young girls get chosen to be the prince’s bride, I know the book is fantasy, but to me that is wrong. I feel like a person has a choice to be with whoever they want to be with. Love shouldn’t be a competition, it should be a choice; but that is my opinion. Even though the book is fantasy, to me I feel like it is wrong to have young girls get chosen to be someone’s bride.\n\nIn order to either agree or disagree with my opinions, you would have to read the book yourself. You can find “Princess Academy” at these stores:\n\nAmazon: $9.95\n\nGoogle Play: $4.61\n\nBarnes & Noble: $7.99\n\nWalmart: $7.99\n\nJet.com: $9.19"
