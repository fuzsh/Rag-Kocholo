        "text": "I can’t believe we’re getting ready to go back to school already! Just this morning, I was thinking about classroom schedules and supply orders and books. Of course, books. I was reminded earlier this week of one of my favorite picture books, Pie is for Sharing. Whether it’s pie, a picnic, a tree, or friends, Stephanie Ledyard and Jason Chin gently hold our hands as we walk through the ups and downs of sharing with each other. I love starting the year with this book to help me guide the little hearts of my students towards loving their neighbor and toward learning my classroom expectations. As I was thinking about this book, my mind, naturally, wandered to food.\n\nThe Gospel is all about food. “I am the bread of life,” Jesus tells us. His first miracle was turning water into wine. He was constantly feeding his disciples and those who were following him. His parables involved food. The sacrament of communion is centered around a meal. Even the Old Testament points us all the way back to the garden, where humanity’s downfall was through the medium of food.\n\nThere is a lot of emotion tied to food. When we’re sad, there are certain foods that comfort us. When we celebrate, many times a great meal is involved. There are particular meals that I will remember for the rest of my life! And not just for the times of delight or sorrow, food is, of course, needed to just survive day to day. Much of history is made on the hunt for food.\n\nWhat does this have to do with the beginning of school? There is a lot of anxiety around moments of food, especially at school. Who will you sit with? Will you like what is packed in your lunchbox? Will other people have an opinion about your meal? And if you’re at home, making lunch adds to the list of other tasks piling up.\n\nHow do we ease some of this anxiety for our kiddos? By opening the door to conversations about food and enriching the imaginations of our children. As we prepare to go back to school, I encourage you to open the door by reading books about foods your child might not be accustomed to. Talk about language and what kind, uplifting words sound like. Instead of saying “Ew! I don’t like that,” encourage phrases like “I don’t care for that, but thank you for offering” or “I may not care for it, but thank you for showing me or sharing with me” are good places to start. Try a new food at home. Talk about Jesus sharing food with us and how that can model how we share kindness and openness to others.\n\nThe books below are a diving board into those kinds of conversations. They are a mix of at school and at home books, books about meals from around the world, books about big feelings around school and food.\n\nMany blessings as you prepare for the school year! If you are looking for Start of School books, you can find my list here.\n\nWe encourage you to order books through our friends at Hearts & Minds, Nooks, Landmark, Eighth Day, or your favorite local independent bookstores.\n\n—\n\nThis post was written by Carey Bustard, one of the co-editors of Wild Things and Castles in the Sky.\n\nSome seven months ago I met the Square Halo team. Well, sort of. It was through emails. Since then, I’ve read several of the books and written some blogs, but in March I met them, and the broader Square Halo community, in person at the annual Square Halo Conference.\n\nAs a first time attendee and a stranger to the city of Lancaster, it felt something like stumbling into a warm tavern and being met by a hundred and one delightful conversations and sounds. How could I not see things this way? There was music, drinks, laughter, storytelling, food, and shelter from the rain. This is essentially the recipe for any tavern scene in a story.\n\nHere is something I now know about Square Halo. The community they have created is composed of some of the most brilliant and loveable people I know. Writers will say something on the lecture stage that will astound you and then you will think how have I never thought of that and how beautiful that was. Then you will be stacking a chair or drinking a beer at pub night and a stranger (who has most likely not written a book, but perhaps has because you really don’t know with this community how many writers there are) will say one of the most profound and kingdom like things you’ve ever heard leaving you with a great smile and sense of inspiration.\n\nI'll also say there was much cheerfulness, laughter, and excitement in the conference. Gathering people who share a love for good books and art should have that effect. There was a button-making station where I cut out a sentence from The Voyage of the Dawn Treader with a small drawing of a lamb and pressed it into a button. My button sits on my desks and reads, “ ‘Come have breakfast’, said the lamb.” There was an art gallery with Narnia-inspired art by a variety of artists (including Ned Bustard’s linocuts from the new book Aslan’s Breath ) where people stood before the prints for quite some time till they stared themselves in and out of the images. The songwriters shared the personal histories of their songs and encouraged the many hobbyist musicians to keep creating whether or not you are the only listener. Ned even hosted a live linocut pop-up printing studio which gave a lot of people (like myself) a first-hand experience with the process that was demonstrated.\n\nI feel there was also a shared concern throughout the conference for how a follower of Christ lives in a sometimes harsh world that makes the acts of creation, laughter, and intimacy with the Father feel impossible. From David Bisgrove’s opening lecture to Sarah Sparks’ closing concert, there was a very honest admittance that we often live in what St. John of the Cross called the “dark night of the soul”. I’m thinking especially of a lyric from Sarah Sparks’ song, The Artist. She says to the artist,\n\nUse the brightest of the pigments\n\nThe most beautiful of hues\n\nBut the first stroke a dark shade of blue.\n\nIt was special to be in a room where communally it could be admitted that this whole Christian thing is not easy. It was comforting to see a speaker share a tear with his audience. I think these moments made this year’s theme of the Holy Spirit in Narnia feel so real. The “dark night of the soul” that obscures hope like Eustace’s dragon skin can’t be escaped by our own efforts and we ought to look elsewhere. If we look close enough in Narnia we would see the Holy Spirit was there all along and with it moments of comfort, grace, laughter, and warmth.\n\nThis year's theme—and the conference itself—was to me, a great breath of fresh air and a great welcome into the warmest, most bookish, and creative community I have known.\n\n—blog post by Iman Mozoffarian | photos by Drew Nyguist\n\nThis week marks the release of a new book, a passion project from Square Halo called Tiny Thoughts That I’ve Been Thinking: Selected Writings of Leslie Anne Bustard. In the forward Théa Rosenburg editor writes:\n\n[Leslie Anne Bustard] wrote poems and essays with startling abundance—more of them and more beautiful than seemed reasonable for a woman fighting two kinds of cancer. Though she had published a few pieces before her diagnosis, she spent her last three years publishing consistently in the writing communities that encouraged and supported her work, in addition to editing a book of essays and publishing a collection of her poems. The warmth and welcome of her writing drew others toward her, as though she’d thrown back the curtains in a dim room and readers couldn’t help but turn toward the sunlight.\n\nThis is the heart and soul of this book, but also only the beginning of it. Leslie’s collected writing is bound for hearts, not just for the pages they are written in. Her words had the incredible capacity to take on a whole new form of truth in my heart as I read this wonderful collection of essays, poems, and recipes. All the “tiny thoughts”.\n\nMany of Leslie’s writings in this book come from her time in what she called “cancer-land” and despite the barrenness and bleakness one might expect of such a land, she maintained the sight and expression of the “goodness of the Lord in the land of the living”. As I read her writings and of her battle with two kinds of cancer, stage IV melanoma and stage II breast cancer, I couldn’t stop thinking about the land of the living and all the questions I had about it as a Christian. Where is it? Where isn’t it? When is it? My humanity is bound to certain answers. Maybe it’s where things are easy and stress-free. Maybe it’s where money isn’t a concern and where good health is aplenty. Or maybe it’s where one feels accepted, loved, and relevant. Rarely have my answers been good.\n\nThis book answers those questions of where and when the land of the living is the way Frederich Buechner does when he says the kingdom of God is “now and then” and “already and not yet”. The Gospel gives us the good news that the kingdom of God has come down to earth, but in the course of our human lives we experience some very bad news that dims this trust of the kingdom’s presence here. We see homelessness, teen depression, forest fires, and cancer diagnoses. Pets go missing, our favorite restaurants close, and our aging bodies ache after tying shoes. What do we make of the “goodness of the Lord in the land of the living” when we experience all these reminders, great and small, of our broken and dying world? What does it look like to live the abundance of the kingdom in a world that is often barren and bleak.\n\nHere is a book written by a saint who daringly did just that. She did it in her poems which saw beauty in faded yellow curtains and in her recipes that were each a little feast, meant to be tasted and shared with others. She did it in her commitment to community and in her blog posts that called a day in “cancer-land” a good day because she noticed the ordinary beauty of a cheesy omelet. Scholars can write all the theologies they want to with some beautiful words and convincing translations, but I think my favorite theology of the goodness of God belongs to Leslie Bustard who summarized it in remembering a good cheesy omelet in the midst of battling two cancers.\n\nSo, now I understand what Frederich Buechner meant by saying “now and then” and “already and not yet”. The kingdom of God and the land of the living is right here and it is right now. It has been inaugurated on this side of resurrection, but not yet fully consummated. As Christians we are called to participate in the kingdom come. We participate in it by noticing the grand beauty of a child’s birth or the sun’s setting over the Sierra crest mountains, but also in noticing the smaller beauties of healthy wet dirt or a picnic table. And even then when we feel the especially painful moments of cancer, death, and loneliness, we participate in the kingdom by properly mourning with our brothers and sisters and holding onto the promise of resurrection.\n\nI’m without a doubt convinced of the warmth and love of Leslie Bustard which I have heard and read of now and I attest that the pages of this book are teeming with it. It is a strange thing to feel the warmth of someone and be fully convinced of their love for others without having ever met them. My suspicion is that is what it means to be remembered as one of Christ’s saints.\n\n—blog post by Iman Mozoffarian\n\nMy favorite Johnny Cash song is a cover of a famous hymn. It goes:\n\n. . . the voice I hear, falling on my ear,\n\nthe Son of God discloses.\n\nAnd He walks with me, and He talks with me,\n\nAnd He tells me I am his own\n\nThere is a deeply magical thing to breath. In the first act of creation, the spirit of Elohim or his breath, ruach in the Hebrew, tames the chaos waters ushering in the coming forth of all things. When God forms man, he breaths into him and calls him a living being and in Eden, the breath of God, his ruach, walks in the garden in search of man. In John’s gospel, he says of Jesus, “he breathed on them and said to them, ‘Receive the Holy Spirit’”.\n\nI think it is too often the case that we have grown accustomed to seizing things in our hectic world that demands a constant state of doing and producing. Like worn out runners we are panting for breath. I see myself there caught busy between the moments of college, tiring work in a kitchen, the chores of a roommate, and finding moments amidst it all to write and pray. I find myself in the space between a great exhale and a great inhale. In the moment between letting out a great gust of breath and waiting to draw a new one, there is a silent space to reflect on the very first breath that man drew into his lungs. It was the breath of God breathed into him which he only had to receive.\n\nIt’s a funny thought which I like to think that God made us to breathe in and out so there is that sacred and magical space between breaths. If we quiet ourselves and sit in the pause after an exhale, we may remember the God that gave the first breath as a gift, not a thing to be seized. Space and presence are perhaps one of the greatest needs in our humanity. Creating space in our lives and trusting God to be in the business of filling empty spaces with his presence is how I often think of the Holy Spirit. I think of God’s insistence on showing up in places where people said surely, not here. Nothing can come from this.\n\nOne of the great beauties of the triune God is that. Christ comes from Galilee, a region where people scoffed and thought, no good thing can come from there. Christ makes wine in a place where no ingredients of wine are. Salvation is breathed into men and women who have none of it together and the Holy Spirit enters empty homes. Where culture tells me, prove yourself and you bring it all to the table, Christ says, receive my body and blood and receive the Holy Spirit too.\n\nMatthew Dickerson has written a wonderful new book called Aslan’s Breath concerning the question of where the Holy Spirit can be found in Narnia. The title offers an answer, but more than that an invitation to return to a land. Not so that you may go through Narnia and know it better through scholarship and research, but so that Narnia may go through you.\n\nHistorian Kevin Belmonte observes:\"How seldom, these days, do we meet with books that are genuine friends for the journey. In the pages of Aslan's Breath, we find an author's voice that is conversational and winsome—a presence that comes alongside the reader. Matthew Dickerson knows the realm of Narnia very well indeed and shares many insights that bring richness to walking the paths of this good country. An air of discovering pervades this excellent book. What's more, and what is best—the gift of C.S. Lewis' writing about the Holy Spirit, amid scenes of comfort, reassurance, and peace, shines in this book. So, in these pages, we have a true gift: one that illumines the seven books of the Narnian Chronicles.\"\n\nDickerson walks one through the land of Narnia with the wisdom of a guide well acquainted with the terrain of his land, but also with the excitement and love of an explorer for that which may lie ahead. In some ways, the book feels like an introduction to a wonderful new friendship with Aslan who is full of all sorts of mysteries and complexities which you didn’t see in him before. Dickerson’s reflections on the imagery of Narnia shows the warmth and wildness of Aslan experienced by the characters of Lewis and calls the reader to go “further up and further in” in their own experience of the Holy Spirit.\n\n—blog post by Iman Mozoffarian\n\nA little over a year ago, I received a short email from Tim Keller. He had just returned to NYC after a moth of immuno-therapy. He wrote:\n\n… the festshrift books we received the last day we were in Maryland—were particular moving to Kathy and I. It was something we had no idea was coming at all and so it was indeed an astonishing, joyful surprise. After such a difficult June, the book just seemed like a kiss and an embrace, a gift of free grace. Many of the contributors are some of our dearest friends, but I don’t know every one of them and I don’t have all the email addresses. In fact, I’ve lost yours. (I know I used to have it!) And so could you simply pass on Kathy and my deepest thanks to all of the people involved in this and let them know how delightful this gift was to us?\n\nWhat is this short email about? It is in response to me shipping the Kellers a box of our book, The City for God: Essays Honoring the Work of Timothy Keller.\n\nThe book was actually begun before Tim got cancer. The whole project was a secret, and we had been chipping away at it for a while before his diagnosis was revealed. As you can imagine, it was discouraging to think we might have worked so hard to honor and thank him only for Tim not to ever know. Therefore, we were quite relieved to be able to get it to him in time for him to enjoy it.\n\nThe City for God was a labor of love that was the result of a brainstorming session the Square Halo partners had one summer day. We were thinking about what books we’d like to publish. Rather than merely responding to book ideas as they were sent to us from folks, we asked ourselves: if we could do anything, what would we want to make? One idea was to write a festschrift in honor of Tim Keller. He had had a huge impact on the founding of my church, his preaching and planting in NYC had had a huge impact on our daughters, and his contribution to It Was Good: Making Art to the Glory of God was easily Square Halo’s most often quoted.\n\nThe City for God is divided into three parts and has a foreword by Russell Moore. The opening section is GOSPEL and it has essays about Character, Rhetoric, Apologetics, Accessibility, and Influence. The middle section is CITY and its topics are Presence, City of God, Prayer, Hope, Creativity, and Jazz. The final section is VOCATION with essays on Work, Both/And, Business, Counseling, Leadership, Mercy, and Legacy.\n\nOne of the things I particularly like about the book is that, although it has some “big names,” many of the people who wrote for it are not well known. They are simply people who were impacted by the ministry and vision of Keller, and have gone on to put his understanding of the Gospel into practice within their spheres. And at the end of the day, what could be better for a pastor than to know his flock was advancing the Kingdom of God?\n\nInstead of endorsements like we’d usually collect for the front of the book, for this project I reached out to a number of folks to get “Thank Yous.” Here are a few:\n\n“At strategic moments, God sometimes makes a surprising choice of human instruments (Gideon, David, Saul of Tarsus). In our own time, I can’t imagine a more appropriate choice of a leader than Tim Keller to represent our faith in the fishbowl that is New York City. By temperament, intellect, trustworthiness, and driving spirit, Tim is supremely qualified.”—Philip Yancey\n\n“Tim was my pastor from 1999 until he retired from the pulpit in 2017. I came to Redeemer in New York City at a particularly lean time in my life. His ministry—following Jesus’ dictum to “feed my sheep”—deeply nourished my soul. He engaged my mind, softened my heart, and inspired my imagination. Tim was also God’s instrument for much of the C.S. Lewis work I have been a part of over the past twenty years. My debt to him remains to this day.”—Max McLean\n\n“Tim and Kathy, your life and ministry have had an impact on mine in countless indirect ways, which, in being indirect, testify mightily to the power of your work and faithfulness over the years. Everywhere I go, I am blessed to work with, be edified by, and befriend those who have been shaped and formed by the Kellers. What greater legacy can there be than to influence those who go on to influence others, and so on, into eternity. I thank God for this kind of ministry. I thank God for you both.”—Karen Swallow Prior\n\nA dear friend recently gave me A House on Mango Street—a book she was reading while preparing for a new year of teaching 8th graders. After she read parts aloud to me, I could understand her attachment to this book and her excitement to share it with her class. Written a couple decades ago by Sandra Cisneros, A House on Mango Street is a timeless, beautiful, and very human story (told in short vignettes), full of joy and sorrow. It is one of those books that you want to share sentence after sentence with someone and also write parts in your journal. It was a hard-to-put- down book.\n\nAfter reading Ms. Cisneros’s book, I remembered others that reminded me of it – books about home, laughter, struggles, growing up in hard times and places, and friendship.\n\nA House on Mango Street, a good read for students in 8th grade and above, focuses on Esperanza, a Mexican-American twelve-year old girl, but also on her family and her neighbors. Her parents have bought their first house but it is not one she is glad for because it is small and run down and in the middle of a crowded Latino neighborhood in Chicago. The theme of how belonging, friendship, family, and community fold into a person’s becoming was both sweet and hard to witness.\n\nTwig by Elizabeth Orten Jones is a perfect chapter book for new readers but also a wonderful read aloud for those in preschool and above. It’s a children’s fantasy novel about a girl named Twig and her backyard adventures, with a sweet spotlight on her affection for all her apartment neighbors.\n\nYou Bring the Distant Near by Mitali Perkins. I enjoyed this wonderful novel last month and invited several 8th and 9thgrade girls to join me in reading it. (We’ll meet later this summer at a local cupcake shop to talk about it.) This story focuses on five different women of one family with Bengali roots (from grandmother, to her two daughters, to her two granddaughters) and their individual experiences making their lives in America, but also how important family and community are to their formation as women and family . . . and their stories.\n\nI Captured the Castle by Dodie Smith. Years ago, I was intrigued by this book when several women shared that they read it as teenagers and couldn’t forget it when they grew up. It is the story of seventeen-year old Cassandra and her family who live in a ramshackle castle. They are a quirky family and very poor. There are many fun, and awkwardly uncomfortable, exploits in this coming-of-age story.\n\nA Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith. One of my daughters just recently read this for the first time and was overwhelmed by the sheer bittersweet - ness of it. The book is set in 1912 and centers on Francine and her family as they make their life in a tenement apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.\n\nAnd, of course, don’t forget classics like The Little Princess by Francis Hodgson Burnett or Great Expectations by Charles Dickens or Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen. They are full of young characters, hard hardship, friends, community, and growing up.\n\nSummer Picture Books\n\nI wandered around the children’s section of Barnes and Noble and discovered these wonderful picture books that fit the “what a good summer read” category.\n\nWave by Suzy Lee\n\nThis wordless book about a young girl meeting and interacting with waves at a beach is a delight. The faces this cute little makes at the water, as well as how the waves are personified, will make you smile and laugh, and hopefully cause some fun conversations.\n\nThe World Belonged to Us by Jacqueline Woodson and illustrated by Leo Espinosa\n\nThe first book I’ve read in a long time that captures the freedom and delights of summer and also reminded me of my childhood in the 1970s (even though it is set in Brooklyn, and I grew up in Wilmington, DE). I loved the summer activities and how the writer captured them with such fun, poetic sentences and how the illustrator captured them through the colorful, happy illustrations.\n\nFlip: How the Frisbee Took Flight by Margaret Muirhead and illustrated by Adam Gustavson\n\nI realized while reading this book that I never actually thought about how the Frisbee was invented! But this story, with its fabulous illustrations, piqued my interest and satisfied my history-loving heart. We meet a young Fred and Lu. They enjoyed tossing a tin popcorn lid around the backyard. Later, they get married and kept trying to figure out how to perfect the flying-disc (it takes them twenty years!). It’s a great history and science story.\n\nThere is a Flower at the Tip of My Nose Smelling Me by Alice Walker and illustrated by Queenbee Monyei\n\nThis is a newly illustrated version of this classic piece by Alice Walker. What a wonderful read to share with others with its focus on the natural world and us in it. I enjoyed the juxtaposition of how I smell the roses to how “a flower at the tip of my nose smelling me…” (and how this happens throughout the book with other natural elements).\n\nThe Honey Bee by Kristen Hall and illustrated by Isabelle Arsenault\n\nSummer is a good time to think about bees and what they are doing during the year. The words and rhymes are very fun (and informative) and the illustrations made me glad to be reading this book. I could picture myself with one of my daughters on my lap enjoying this fun book together.\n\nOne Smart Cookie: Bite-sized Lessons for School Years and Beyond by Amy Krouse Rosenthal and illustrated by Jane Dyer and Brooke Dyer (Illustrator)\n\nI haven’t thought about this book (and its companions) in years, so I was glad to see it at B&N. I do remember being enchanted by how the author was able to take words like kindness and empathy (character traits we would want to help our children know and grow in) and teach them through focusing on cookies and baking them. Also, I have love love loved the illustrations of Jane Dyer over the years, so her work in collaboration with her daughter in this book made it even more wonderful. This book is one to read and return to while getting your children ready for a new school year and thinking of how to be “others focused.”\n\n—\n\nThis post was written by Leslie Bustard, one of the co-editors of Wild Things and Castles in the Sky.\n\nPlease tell me about your new publishing company Owl’s Nest. What a wonderful name, which I imagine has a great backstory.\n\nOwl’s Nest Publishers was established this past year as a shared vision between myself and my lifelong bosom friend Katie Stewart. It is an independent publishing house that we created because we see the need to make space for authors who want to write books for adolescents—real adolescents, rather than what the market often mistakes for adolescents. Thus, our company motto is “Capturing the imagination of teen and middle grade readers.” We know that there are many readers out there between the ages of 8-18 who feel lost in the bookstores trying to find books that represent their coming-of-age experiences—or who simply can’t find the books they really want to read! We want to be a reliable source of books for them (and a reliable source for their parents).\n\nThe name for Owl’s Nest comes from the family camp Katie and I attended as children—for our entire lives, really. We came together every summer with the same families for one week in July, and we had this group of friends with whom we grew up, at this remote place in Upper Michigan—one of those rare places that was special and unique and felt like a truly “thin place.” Many of the buildings there were named for things from either The Chronicles of Narnia or Winnie the Pooh, and there was a camp library that was the upper room over the rec center—that library was called the Owl’s Nest (referencing Owl from Winnie the Pooh).\n\nThe Owl’s Nest had window seats with cushions where you could sit and overlook the fields and the beach and read a book, and I remember spending mornings up there with my class as a young kid, listening to one of the Narnia books read aloud to us. But as Katie and I and the rest of our friends grew older, the Owl’s Nest became a place we would hang out on rainy afternoons, or if we just needed a change of pace and place—without any adults or supervision involved. Lots of laughter and fun and memories and imagination were forged up there.\n\nWe had lots of motivations for starting Owl’s Nest! Katie and I are both parents ourselves and feel the lack of options when we search for books for our kids. As a former classical educator, I can also tell you that after many, many conversations with parents, there is a real lack of options for books for young teens. Also, Katie has been involved in the book-reviewing scene for many years and has seen the lack of books—particularly for the upper middle grade age group—herself. Previous to starting Owl’s Nest, I struggled for a decade to find representation and acceptance in the traditional publishing world for my books, which were written for ages 13-16, despite finding acceptance among readers. I’ve watched many authors go through the same struggles.\n\nOur hope for Owl’s Nest is that we can make space for these needed books to be published. We want to become a reliable publisher of adolescent literature for young readers and their parents, to grow and bring on an increasing number of authors who share our vision each year, and to publish books that capture the imagination of teens and middle grade readers in true, beautiful, and good ways.\n\nAt Owl’s Nest, we only publish books for adolescents, and our books are broken down into three imprints: Owl’s Nest Middle Grade, Owl’s Nest Teen, and Owl’s Nest Classics. Middle Grade is for books with an audience ages 8-12, Teen is for books with an audience ages 13-18, and Classics is a line of public domain literary companions that we are very excited about! These are public domain books that we will be publishing as study guides with annotations, questions, and essays to help introduce adolescents of today to Bildungsroman classics of yesterday.\n\nAnd we are open for submissions! All our submissions guidelines can be found here: https://www.owlsnestpublishers.com/submissions\n\nThis fall another book is coming out titled Orion and the Starborn. It looks really interesting! What is that about?\n\nWe are so very excited about Orion and the Starborn at Owl’s Nest—and I am of course excited about it on a personal level since it will be my 12th published novel and the first in another series!\n\nOrion has been such a difficult novel for me to define for people because it falls in that tricky in-between space: it’s in between genres and also in between audiences. It’s neither fantasy nor science fiction—it’s a little of both. It’s crossover middle grade to teen (so we’ll call it upper middle grade). The characters will age up as the story progresses, so it is true coming-of-age. Orion and the Starborn is the story of a boy who must find his place in the universe, literally, and the implications of what happens when he does. It should feel, when you read it, both like an old story you’ve read before, and something entirely brand new.\n\nWhat are five book recommendations that you can offer us?\n\nThis is such a hard question for me to answer because I don’t like recommending books (especially to children) without knowing what sort of reader I am dealing with. But here are a few go to books:\n\nThe Chronicles of Prydain by Lloyd Alexander is a lesser-known fantasy series that is an absolute favorite of mine, as is Goose Girl by Shannon Hale.\n\nThe Girl Who Drank the Moon is a light and lovely children’s fantasy read.\n\nMy non-fantasy reader (who struggled to read as a child) loved to read The Bad Guys books by Aaron Blabey, so I recommend those to parents of reluctant readers.\n\nAnd if I have a chance to buy picture books for people, I almost always choose Doreen Cronin’s Click, Clack, Moo books.\n\n—\n\nThis post was written by Leslie Bustard, one of the co-editors of Wild Things and Castles in the Sky.\n\nToday is Poem in Your Pocket Day!\n\nEver since 2002, April 29 has been designated Poem in Your Pocket Day. I do wish I had known about this day earlier, but it is never too late to share poems. You could extend this pleasurable day into the weekend.\n\nPoets.org shared the following thoughts: “Every April, on Poem in Your Pocket Day, people celebrate by selecting a poem, carrying it with them, and sharing it with others, throughout the day at schools, bookstores, libraries, retirement homes, parks, workplaces, and on social media (using the hashtag #PocketPoem).”\n\nPoem in Your Pocket Day takes place during National Poetry Month, which seems quite perfect since April feels like a living poem with all the flowers blooming, breezes blowing, and birds chirping.\n\nBut why take time with poetry anyway?\n\nSays Missy Andrews in her essay about poetry in Wild Things and Castles in the Sky: Poetry “exercises in-sight. . . that inner vision is the stuff of imagination. . . While the modern mind associates the imaginative faculty with “unreality,” the Bible suggests that figured things are often more real than things material. The Apostle Paul argues: “So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal” (2 Cor.4:18 NIV). If this is so, how is one to perceive the unseen reality of the gospel but with the figurative faculty that is the imagination? How is one to perceive the invisible truths without poetics?”\n\nNot only does reading poetry help us move into the the deep beautiful mysteries of Scripture and life in Jesus, it helps us learn to pay attention, enjoy, lament, name, and move through our lives and places with open hearts and open eyes. Poetry can be a means of grace to help you and me and the children we know live our days well.\n\nEnjoy Poem in Your Pocket Day with a loved one or a beloved little one. Below are poems to recopy and illustrate, memorize or recite, or together share with others (maybe with a telephone call or facetime).\n\nI also suggest adding in pancakes or popcorn or ice cream to increase the fun.\n\n—\n\nThis post was written by Leslie Bustard, one of the co-editors of Wild Things and Castles in the Sky.\n\nThe O in Hope | Luci Shaw\n\nFrom the book The O in Hope\n\nHope holds one lovely vowel like a promise!\n\nThink how we cry “Oh!” at the round sun rising.\n\nO is the shape of a mouth singing, and in\n\nthe color of a round red cherry.\n\n“Oh!” say our open eyes at surprising beauty,\n\nand then “Wow!”\n\nO is as complete as a wedding ring,\n\na round pool, and the shape of ripples\n\nspreading on the water.\n\nO is the heart of love and joy.\n\nO was in the invention of the wheel.\n\nO multiplies in the zoo, in an open door,\n\nand in a cool drink on a hot day.\n\nO grows in the heart of a green woood.\n\nO is like the moon, and the looping paths of planets.\n\nYou’ll find O in food and books,\n\nand cotton socks, and useful tools, and knitting wool.\n\nWe love the double O in good,\n\nand how O is in itself complete and whole.\n\nLove forms a circle that holds us all together,\n\nsafe in the center of the loving heart of God.\n\nPuppy and I | A.A. Milne\n\nWhen We Were Very Young\n\nI met a Man as I went walking:\n\nWe got talking,\n\nMan and I.\n\n\"Where are you going to, Man?\" I said\n\n(I said to the Man as he went by).\n\n\"Down to the village, to get some bread.\n\nWill you come with me?\" \"No, not I.\"\n\nI met a horse as I went walking;\n\nWe got talking,\n\nHorse and I.\n\n\"Where are you going to, Horse, today?\"\n\n(I said to the Horse as he went by).\n\n\"Down to the village to get some hay.\n\nWill you come with me?\" \"No, not I.\"\n\nI met a Woman as I went walking;\n\nWe got talking,\n\nWoman and I.\n\n\"Where are you going to, Woman, so early?\"\n\n(I said to the Woman as she went by).\n\n\"Down to the village to get some barley.\n\nWill you come with me?\" \"No, not I.\"\n\nI met some Rabbits as I went walking;\n\nWe got talking,\n\nRabbits and I.\n\n\"Where are you going in your brown fur coats?\"\n\n(I said to the Rabbits as they went by).\n\n\"Down to the village to get some oats.\n\nWill you come with us?\" \"No, not I.\"\n\nI met a Puppy as I went walking;\n\nWe got talking,\n\nPuppy and I.\n\n\"Where are you going this nice fine day?\"\n\n(I said to the Puppy as he went by).\n\n\"Up to the hills to roll and play.\"\n\n\"I'll come with you, Puppy,\" said I.\n\nWho has seen the Wind | Christina Rossetti\n\nWho has seen the Wind?\n\nNeither I nor you.\n\nBut when the leaves hang trembling,\n\nThe wind is passing through.\n\nWho has seen the wind?\n\nNeither you nor I.\n\nBut when the trees bow down their heads,\n\nThe wind is passing by.\n\nThe Duck | Ogden Nash\n\nBehold the duck.\n\nIt does not cluck.\n\nA cluck it lacks.\n\nIt quacks.\n\nIt is especially fond\n\nOf a Puddle or pond.\n\nWhen it dines or sups,\n\nIt bottoms up.\n\nA Popcorn Song | Nancy Byrd Turner\n\nSing a song of popcorn\n\nWhen the snowstorms rage;\n\nFifty little round men\n\nPut into a cage.\n\nShake them till they laugh and leap\n\nCrowding to the top;\n\nWatch them burst their little coats\n\nPop!! Pop!! Pop!!\n\nfrom Firefly | Li Po\n\nI think\n\nIf you flew\n\nUp to the sky\n\nBeside the moon,\n\nYou would\n\nTwinkle\n\nLike a star.\n\nThe Swing | Robert Louis Stevenson\n\n(This one does need to be read or recited while swinging on a swing.)\n\nHow do you like to go up in a swing,\n\nUp in the air so blue?\n\nOh, I do think it the pleasantest thing\n\nEver a child can do!\n\nUp in the air and over the wall,\n\nTill I can see so wide,\n\nRivers and trees and cattle and all\n\nOver the countryside—\n\nTill I look down on the garden green,\n\nDown on the roof so brown—\n\nUp in the air I go flying again,\n\nUp in the air and down!\n\nWhen your children range in age from six to almost-fourteen, it can be tough to find read-alouds that engage and challenge everybody. A few on this list hit that sweet spot, and a few others are books that all four girls have loved when they were at the perfect age to love them.\n\nThe Complete Brambly Hedge, by Jill Barklem\n\nI’ve never quite been able to decide if the magic in this book flows mostly from the illustrations or the stories. Probably, it’s the harmonious blend of the two: Barklem’s tales of the Brambly Hedge mice are delightful and sweetly told, and her watercolor illustrations (especially the cutaways of the homes!) have drawn our family into the world of Brambly Hedge over and over again.\n\nThe Misadventured Summer of Tumbleweed Thompson, by Glenn McCarty\n\nWhen I started reading this book to my girls, I had a hunch they’d enjoy it. But this frontier story so quickly won us all over and became such a foundational part of our summer lunch read-alouds that we’ve since read every other Glenn McCarty book we can find. And how’s this for full circle: I bought this book after reading Carolyn Givens’s recommendation in Wild Things!\n\nJames Herriot’s books (all of them)\n\nAt some point, all four girls have discovered James Herriot’s Treasury for Children, and we’ve lingered together over his stories of life as a country vet in the 1930s. But as the older girls have outgrown that book (as much as it’s possible to outgrow it—I’m not sure you ever really can), we’ve discovered Herriot’s other memoirs. These books include a lot more details about birth and veterinary procedures and aren’t exactly meant for teens and tweens, but Herriot is such a fantastic storyteller, he makes even these details riveting and somehow warm and wholesome. I’m pretty sure we’ll all love these stories forever.\n\nThe Secret Life of Walter Kitty, by Barbara Jean Hicks\n\nBarbara Jean Hicks and Caldecott-winning illustrator Dan Santat get the double life of the cat just right: they capture the inner life of Walter, a cat who answers to Fang and imagines himself as pirate, superhero, and explorer, and they set that alongside his everyday existence as a house cat—a sucker for catnip and chin-scratches, who is also willing to answer, in his weakest moments, to Snookums. We’ve loved so many picture books over the years, but this is one of those rare gems that still makes us all laugh.\n\nThe Wilderking Trilogy, by Jonathan Rogers\n\nThe summer we listened to the audiobooks of this trilogy over lunch was also the summer the girls ran along hiking trails barking like bog owls at top volume. (This was startling for other hikers and hilarious to me.) Rogers’s reimagining of King David’s story is set in a swamp filled with some of the most memorable characters you’ll meet, and it hits that sweet spot for readers who are ready for an adventure tale, but not quite ready for anything too scary or intense. But these books aren’t all fun and adventure: there are some deep, true moments in here that you’ll carry away with you and think back on for years.\n\nMay this Holy Week, these days of walking with Jesus and seeing how he set his face toward his death on cross and “did not despise its shame,” find you meditating on Scripture and other good words — to enlarge your imagination concerning God’s love found in Jesus Christ and to unite your heart to praise his name.\n\nHere are a few poems you and the children in your life can share together, as you enter in the story of the Cross.\n\nLion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe | CS Lewis\n\n“Wrong will be right, when Aslan comes in sight,\n\nAt the sound of his roar, sorrows will be no more,\n\nWhen he bares his teeth, winter meets its death,\n\nAnd when he shakes his mane, we shall have spring again.”\n\nApril | John Updike\n\nApril\n\nIt's Spring! Farewell\n\nTo chills and colds!\n\nThe blushing, girlish\n\nWorld unfolds\n\nEach flower, leaf,\n\nAnd blade of turf--\n\nSmall love-notes sent\n\nFrom air to earth.\n\nThe sky's a hard\n\nOf prancing sheep,\n\nThe birds and fields\n\nAbandon sleep,\n\nAnd jonquils, tulips,\n\nDaffodils\n\nBloom bright upon\n\nThe wide-eyed hills.\n\nAll things renew.\n\nAll things begin.\n\nAt church, they bring\n\nThe lilies in.\n\nRoyalty | Luci Shaw\n\nHe was a plain man\n\nand learned no latin.\n\nHaving left all gold behind\n\nhe dealt out peace\n\nto all us wild men\n\nand the weather\n\nHe ate fish, bread,\n\ncountry wine and God’s will\n\nDust sandalled his feet\n\nHe wore purple only once\n\nand that was an irony\n\nQuiet | Leslie Bustard\n\n…like a robin’s egg in a nest,\n\na row of yellow tulips, petals closed,\n\nthe last few shadowed moments\n\non the eastern horizon,\n\nand Holy Saturday,\n\nas Christ was lying in the sealed tomb,\n\nand the angels were waiting.\n\nThe Lion, the Witch, the Wardrobe | CS Lewis\n\nThe rising of the sun had made everything look so different – all the colours and shadows were changed – that for a moment they didn’t see the important thing. Then they did. The Stone Table was broken into two pieces by a great crack that ran down it from end to end; and there was no Aslan.\n\n“Oh, oh, oh!” cried the two girls rushing back to the Table.\n\n“Oh, it’s too bad,” sobbed Lucy; “they might have left the body alone.”\n\n“Whose done it?” cried Susan. “What does it mean? Is it more magic?”\n\n“Yes!” said a great voice behind their backs. “It is more magic.” They looked round. There, shining in the sunrise, larger than they had seen him before, shaking his mane (for it had apparently grown again) stood Aslan himself.\n\nEmmaus 2 | Malcolm Guite\n\nWe thought that everything was lost and gone,\n\nDisaster on disaster overtook us\n\nThe night we left our Jesus all alone\n\nAnd we were scattered, and our faith forsook us.\n\nBut oh that foul Friday proved far worse,\n\nFor we had hoped that he had been the one,\n\nTill crucifixion proved he was a curse,\n\nAnd on the cross our hopes were all undone.\n\nOh foolish foolish heart why do you grieve?\n\nHere is good news and comfort to your soul:\n\nOpen your mind to scripture and believe\n\nHe bore the curse for you to make you whole\n\nThe living God was numbered with the dead\n\nThat He might bring you Life in broken bread.\n\nfrom The Jesus Storybook Bible | Sally Lloyd-Jones\n\nAnd the King says, “Look!”\n\nGod and his children are together again.\n\nNo more running away. Or hiding.\n\nNor more crying or being lonely or afraid.\n\nNor more being sick or dying.\n\nBecause all these things are gone.\n\nYes, they’re gone forever.\n\nEverything sad has come untrue.\n\nAnd see — I have wiped away every tear from every eye!”\n\nAnd then a deep, beautiful voice that sounded like thunder\n\nIn the sky says, “Look, I am making everything new!”\n\n—\n\nThis post was written by Leslie Bustard, one of the co-editors of Wild Things and Castles in the Sky.\n\nThe other day someone on Facebook asked, “Which book would you like to reread for the first time?”\n\nI didn’t check the other answers so I could come up with my own idea.\n\nAfter a quick moment I knew I would want to relive many of those magical first moments in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe by C.S— like being with Lucy when she has tea with Mr. Tumnus, with the Peter, Susan, and Lucy when they come before the magnificent Aslan, and with Edmund as he trudges through the melting snow while spring musically makes its way into Narnia. Rowen Wlliams in The Lion’s World: A Journey into the Heart of Narnia says Lewis was seeking to re-enchant us with the glories of the gospel. The Chronicles of Narnia are Great Supposal stories. Suppose there was another world, and Jesus acted in that world, what would it be like? And seeing Jesus and how he acts (Aslan) we might see him as if for the first time and our dullness to the Scriptures may be replaced with awe and gratefulness. I have experienced this. (spoiler) Reliving the death and then the resurrection of Aslan chokes me up often. I don’t remember how I felt when I first read it when I was 12, so I imagine rereading these scenes for the first time and experiencing the joy of Aslan, Susan, and Lucy romping around the broken Stone Table might enchant me even more to the glory of Christ’s resurrection.\n\nEpic stories like Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter capture, like The Chronicles of Narnia, the sacrificial love of Jesus without actually be allegorical. Rereading these or even excerpts from them would be a way to assist the imaginations of our young people as we invite them into the true miracle of the gospel story. The following are several more stories that can be read during Passion Week and can help us enter into the amazingness of this time of the year and church calenar.\n\n1. Bare Tree and Little Wind: A Story for Holy Week by Mitali Perkins and illustrated by Khoa Le. “A lyrical, captivating retelling of the Palm Sunday and Easter story…” I love how my imagination gets caught up in the Holy Land through the characters of a tree and wind. Through these characters I witness what happens to Jesus and then I’m given the hope of his return that will restore the whole earth – people and nature. Mitali Perkins is a wonderful storyteller and the pictures by Khao Le are colorful and captivating.\n\n2. Oscar Wilde Stories for Children by Oscar Wilde, illustrated by P.J. Lynch\n\n“The Selfish Giant” and “The Nightingale and the Rose” are short stories which beautifully and achingly point us to Jesus and his sacrifice. P. J. Lynch’s illustrations in other books have been a favorite of mine for a longtime; these are a great addition to enjoying these stories.\n\n3. “Maundy Thursday” by Walter Wangerin\n\nI found this story in Stories for the Christian Year by The Chrysostom Society, but you can also find in online through Christianity Today.\n\nI read this story every Maundy Thursday to my family and anyone will listen. This story helps us remember how Jesus broke the bread and shared the wine with his disciples before he was arrested and then died. It is funny and endearing; it chokes me up every time I read the end.\n\n4. The Light Princess by George MacDonald and illustrated by Ned Bustard\n\nThis novella, with all the trappings of a traditional fairy tale told with a nod and a wink and clever word play offers insight into what true sacrifice looks like. (Also, the illustrations are perfect, created by my husband Ned. He fills each picture with lots of fun things to look at . . . yes, I might be slightly biased).\n\n5. The Biggest Story Bible Storybook written by Kevin DeYoung and illustrated by Don Clark.\n\nWhen my daughters were younger, and if I remembered (!), I would read all the Bible stories starting with Palm Sunday and ending with Christ’s death. Then on Easter and a few days after we would read the rest of the glorious story. (Each day we would focus on the stories that happened on that day.) Reading straight from the Bible is always a very, very good idea; supplementing with a storybook Bible is good, too, especially if the illustrations can capture your imagination without replacing any images in one’s mind already. This new one published by Crossway has colorful and dramatic illustrations by Don Clark, are modern-vintage; they are clear enough to give you an idea of what is going on, but because they are so stylized you don’t think it is actually how everything looked.\n\n—\n\nThis post was written by Leslie Bustard, one of the co-editors of Wild Things and Castles in the Sky.\n\nSeveral recently published books have come into BookEnd (the name my husband gave to our house here in Lancaster) that just need to be shared. These are great resources for adults and teeangers.\n\n1. Special Grace: Prayers and Reflections for Families with Special Needs by Elrena Evans.\n\nJoni Eareckson Tada shares in the forward the words of a mother with three special needs children. “I can’t tell you how many times I’ve teetered on the edge, desperate and wholly overwhelmed, barely able to utter a mere “Jesus, help me.’ How wonderful to have a Christ-loving mom articulate much heartfelt, spot-on prayers for nearly every circumstance! I so appreciate her faithfulness, her honesty, and her humor. “ I know how much I have needed the prayers of Every Moment Holy to help me trust God in everyday ups and downs, so I am excited how this book can help families with special needs children pray (and also help me pray alongside my friends). Topics include Family Life, School, Public Life, Changes, Seasons of the Year, and Thanksgivings (and other prayers). What a gift this book is to the Body of Christ.\n\n2. Rembrandt is in the Wind: Learning to Love Art Through the Eyes of Faith by Russ Ramsey.\n\nSeveral years ago I heard Russ Ramsey give several talks that linked Scripture and gospel truths with stories of certain artists and their paintings. My heart and mind could not have been happier. I’ve been looking forward to this book. Russ Ramsey writes about nine artists, including such greats as Michaelangelo, Rembrandt, Vermeer, van Gogh, Tanner, and Lillias Trotter. This book will be great for those who love art or would like to dig deeper into the importance of art and beauty in our lives, and even grow in their appreciation of it. My husband got to write one of the endorsements in which he praised the book, saying: “Ramsey is a deep lover of art and a student of art history. In this book he takes the reader on an amazing guided tour through an art museum that doesn't exist. In this carefully curated collection of art from around the world, he offers you an experience that only someone who really loves art can. This book inspires the reader to engage art in an eye-opening way and understand how these famous works of art bring glory to God.”\n\n3. Steeped in Stories: Timeless Children Novels to Refresh our Tired Souls by Mitali Perkins.\n\nRecently I wrote that Mitali Perkins is the Literature professor I wish I had had. This book is memoir, “classroom instruction” on the ins and outs of each story, as well as discussions on the virtues and vices these stories point us to. At the same time, she, while in love for these stories and their authors, also speaks to those challenging parts that many classics contain. It’s such a very good read. I love how she doesn’t tell us to throw away these classics but to see their value by modeling what it looks to truly be refreshed by these books; but at the same time she helps us think seriously and discerningly about legitimately troublesome parts (usually how “the other” is portrayed). Mitali Perkins discusses Little Women, A Little Princess, The Hobbit, Anne of Green Gables, Heidi, and Chronicles of Narnia. This book would be wonderful for an adult to read so they can have solid and wise tools to interact with young people they know who are reading these books – tools that can help them highlight all the good and work through the hard parts.\n\n4. The Scandal of Holiness: Renewing Your Imagination in the Company of Literary Saints by Jessica Hooten Wilson\n\nDo I need to make a disclaimer that I am on the launch team for this book? Probably not, except to say after I heard the author speak at a conference on renewing the imagination this past September, I knew I would love this book. Getting a jump-start on reading it has been a delight. Jessica Hooten Wilson says “Novels introduce us to ways of imagining God already at work in our hearts, present in the world, transforming and sanctifying his creation all the time.” She discusses eight contemporary classics, such as Kristen Lavransdatter, The Moviegoer, The Book of the Dun Cow, Moses, and Man of the Mountain. In each chapter she narrates and highlights the plot and the main characters, as well as instructs the reader in different aspects of holiness, as each book discusses one aspect of holy living. This book would make a solid read not just for adults who love books and the life of the mind and imagination but also upper-high school book-lovers and readers who desire to think deeply about what they are reading.\n\n5. Literarily: How Understanding Bible Genre Transforms Bible Study by Kristie Anyabwile\n\nI am also on the launch team for this book that was just recently released. Kristie Anyabwile is a Bible teacher I have enjoyed listening to. She is a wealth of Scriptural and theological knowledge, a love for the Church, and has a great ability to share truths in a way that is solid and accessible. Her book Literarily will help readers of Scripture dig in deeper (to sound like a cliché) by helping the them understand the importance of the authors use of certain genres, such as law, history, prophecy, and poetry, as well as literary themes and devices used within them. This book is an important tool in helping adults and teenagers thoughtfully encounter God’s Word.\n\n6. A Guide to Reading and Thinking Series edited by Karen Swallow Prior\n\nThe novels in this series are books I read in high school (Scarlet Letter) or classics I sought out in my adult years (Jane Eyre and Sense and Sensibility), as well as books I have been planning on reading sometime (Frankenstein and Tess of the D’Urbervilles). And while each book truly looks wonderful on my bookshelf (the covers look classy and feel welcoming), I have been glad for how each book in the series enlarges my mind through Karen Swallow Prior’s introduction and guidance through the themes, characters, etc. Since reading her first book Booked: Literature for the Soul of Me and then Fierce Convictions: The Extraordinary Life of Hannah More—Poet, Reformer, Abolitionist, and On Reading Well: Finding the Good Life through Great Books, I have sought her out to learn how to think more deeply about the classics. Tess of the D’Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy and The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne, the novels with her reader’s guide, have recently been released. These books and the other ones are perfect reads for high schoolers and adults.\n\n—\n\nThis post was written by Leslie Bustard, one of the co-editors of Wild Things and Castles in the Sky.\n\nWhen last year’s leaves have turned to mould in the flower beds and the vines of the clematis are black and brittle, that first glimpse of a golden crocus feels like a promise. Spring is coming! When my daughters were younger they’d wonder at each new spring flower, and I was never sure how well they remembered seeing the same flowers the previous year. Now, they are old enough to know: when we’re out walking, we’ll interrupt each other to cry, “Crocus!” and clap and maybe make fools of ourselves. And then we’ll go back to talking about middle school math, or a book they just finished. We delight in the changing season together, but we both know it happened last year and that it will (most likely) happen again next spring.\n\nBut when they were little: ah! Those crocuses were a burst of color where a second before everything had looked brown and sodden. The spring was brand new to them, and they marveled at each crocus (and then, at a certain age, most likely tried to eat it). The Easter story, nestled neatly into spring as it is, was new to them too. And over the years we found that the best Easter books for toddlers told the story of Jesus’ death and resurrection with color, promise, and joy. They gave our daughters something to wonder at, delight in, and remember. These Easter books for young readers became some of our very favorites.\n\nEaster is Coming, by Tama Fortner\n\nThis lovely, large-format board book tells the littlest readers the story of Easter from Genesis onward. The illustrations in this one are particularly lovely.\n\nThe Garden, the Curtain, and the Cross, by Carl Laferton\n\nThis one, too, tells the whole story of Easter, from the garden of Eden to Jesus' return. But it's not as long as you'd think such a telling would be—better yet, it's now available as a board book! And while it’s not technically an Easter book, it does offer a companion Advent-style calendar for the two weeks leading up to Easter.\n\nWhat is Easter?, by Michelle Medlock Adams\n\nThis sweet rhymed board book tells readers not just what happened on Easter but why we celebrate it the way we do. Where does the bunny come in? What's up with the new dresses? What is Easter? answers all those burning questions and more.\n\nHoly Week, by Danielle Hitchen\n\nThis board book primer takes readers through the events of Holy Week, supporting each page with Scripture and emphasizing the different emotions Jesus and the disciples may have felt as the week went on.\n\nA Very Happy Easter, by Tim Thornborough\n\nThis one also focuses on emotions as it tells the Easter story (those toddlers and their emotions!), but it tells the story differently, in an interactive and delightful way.\n\nJesus Rose for Me, by Jared Kennedy\n\nThis exuberant telling of the Easter story looks forward, beyond Jesus' death and resurrection to this moment, today, and helps readers understand why Jesus died—and why his resurrection still matters so much to us. This is one of my favorites.\n\n—\n\nThis post was written by Théa Rosenburg, one of the co-editors of Wild Things and Castles in the Sky.\n\nI checked in with Carey, my oldest daughter and a co-editor of Wild Things and Castles in the Sky: A Guide to Choosing the Best Books for Children, to make certain it was okay to use her birthday, February 16th, as an excuse to post a list of children’s books that I read to her when she was little. She said it was okay… and even reminded me of a few of our favorites.\n\nThe majority of these books are from our very first years of reading books together. These books are also ones that are still sitting on the bottom three shelves of the tallest book shelf in BookEnd, our home in the west end of Lancaster. Although I discovered most of them in our local library, we loved them enough to buy our own copies.\n\nCarey was the reason I discovered the goodness of a well-told and well-illustrated story, and how I also discovered my love for sitting on the floor, back against the couch, with a child on my lap (and later, when her sisters came, a child on one side of me, another child on my lap, and maybe another one rolling around on the floor or on top of me . . . and a book in front of us). Big cozy chairs do just fine, too. Snacks help.\n\nMaking a book about books with Carey has been a delight because, now that she teaches four year olds, she has continued developing her love of books and has also introduced me to many, many new books, authors, and illustrators in which to delight. It’s fun to have our roles reversed.\n\nWe spent many years going back and forth to the library, discovering stories written by people of all backgrounds and stories of all kinds… but these are the ones that got me started on my journey to learn more about books and to make reading a part of our family culture. These are the books written or illustrated by people we still remember. In the list below, there maybe be one book named with it’s author, but most likely that author has more books worth checking out. As with the suggestions in our upcoming book (Wild Things and Castles in the Sky—which should come out in early, early spring, 2022—shameless plug!), this list is just an introduction.\n\nRead With Me Bible: An NIV Story Bible for Children\n\nTomie de Paola’s Book of Bible Stories by Tomie dePaola\n\nSing a Song of Popcorn: Every Child’s Book of Poems by Beatrice Schenk de Regniers\n\nMudpies and Other Recipes: A Cookbook for Dolls by Marjorie Winslow\n\nChildren Just Like Me: a Unique Celebration of Children Around the World by Barnabas and Anabel Kindersley\n\nThe Going to Bed Book by Sandra Boyton\n\nWinnie the Pooh and Some Bees (and the others in the classic board book collection )\n\nGiving by Shirley Hughes\n\nTom and Pippo Go Shopping by Helen Oxenbury\n\nWhat the Sun Sees by Nancy Tafuri\n\nMake Way for Ducklings by Robert McCloskey\n\nMy First Little House Books: The Deer in the Wood adapted by Laura Ingalls Wilder\n\nCorduroy by Don Freeman\n\nMcDuff Moves In by Rosemary Wells\n\nThis Quiet Lady by Charlotte Zolotow\n\nThe Lovely Present by Charotte Zolotqw\n\nMadeline by Ludwig Bemelmans\n\nJust Only John by Jack Kent\n\nIsland Boy by Barbara Cooney\n\nMiss Fannie’s Hat by Jan Karon\n\nJennie’s Hat by Ezra Jack Keats\n\nMr. Putter and Tabby Paint the Porch by Cynthia Rylant\n\nFrog and Toad are Friends by Arnold Lobel\n\nLittle Bear by Elise Holmelund Minarik\n\n—\n\nThis post was written by Leslie Bustard, one of the co-editors of Wild Things and Castles in the Sky, coming Spring 2022.\n\nThe winter months are a struggle for me. It feels like the gray sky cuts to my core and refuses to shine. On top of that, I live in New York City, and the tall, cold skyscrapers create merciless wind tunnels through which I must crawl. Suffice to say, I’ve been dreading the approach of the next few months. But today I was put in my place while reading with my Junior Kindergarten students. We start every day with Thoughts to Make Your Heart Sing by Sally Lloyd-Jones, and as always, her words were exactly what I needed:\n\nWinter\n\nIn the winter it looks like the trees have all died. Their leaves wither and drop off. They stand like skeletons against the cold, desolate sky.\n\nBut did you know before even a single leaf falls to the ground, next spring’s bud is ready? Next summer’s leaf is furled inside that tiny buddy, waiting.\n\nAnd Jesus says there is nothing broken that won’t be mended, nothing sick that won’t be healed, nothing dead that won’t live again. Because God is making everything sad come untrue!\n\nWe can’t see it now– but remember the fruit tree in winter? It looks dead. But the buds are ready to go. And come spring–blossom and fruit!\n\nI am talking with my students about winter, snow, and animals who live in colder climates during our Enrichment time this week. Instead of me begrudgingly bringing my students along on an adventure, they guided me with their awe for winter wonderlands. They have eyes to see how detailed each snowflake is, they have the excitement you need to enjoy the icy air. You never know what could happen when you’re out walking in the cold! We looked at Renaissance painter Peter Bruegal’s Hunters in the Snow and Impressionist Camille Pissarro’s Chestnut Trees at Louveciennes and each student pointed out reasons why they would like to be tramping through those particular snowy scenes.\n\nI was challenged to see winter in a new light, to see that we need the cold for spring to come. How can we enjoy the warm air and the green buds if we don’t experience the stark opposite? I don’t want my heart to be “always winter, but never Christmas.” I need childlike eyes to see God’s glory shine through this harsh season. And so, with the help of a few of my favorite winter books below, I invite you to get out of this frigid funk and be reminded of God’s healing hand.\n\nA Big Bed for Little Snow by Grace Lin\n\nThe Snowy Day by Ezra Jack Keats\n\nLittle Penguins by Cynthia Rylant, Christian Robinson (Illustrator)\n\nOver and Under the Snow by Kate Messner, Christopher Silas Neal (Illustrator)\n\nFrederick by Leo Lionni\n\nStopping by the Woods on a Snowy Evening by Robert Frost, Susan Jeffers (Illustrator)\n\nKaty and the Big Snow by Virginia Lee Burton\n\nOwl Moon by Jane Yolen, John Schoenherr (Illustrator)\n\nToot and Puddle: Let it Snow by Hollie Hobbie\n\nBrambly Hedge: The Winter Story by Jill Barklem\n\nLook at the Weather by Britta Teckentrup\n\n—\n\nThis post was written by Carey Bustard, one of the co-editors of Wild Things and Castles in the Sky, coming Spring 2022.\n\nAlthough I have switched my planner from 2021 to 2022, and although the calendar pages look clean and pristine, January 1 still feels more like a continuation of whatever was happening pre-Christmas holiday than an actual new beginning.\n\nSince I’ve never been very good at keeping up with New Year’s resolutions, I’ve recently been thinking of the first of the year as a way to re-orient where I have gone off track or to strengthen what I have let grow weak. And as I try to reset, I need my imagination to be sparked and my heart encouraged to keep going on the path that’s been set before me.\n\nCS Lewis helps me with this in The Silver Chair. Jill and Eustace have been put on a journey to find a long-lost prince. Puddleglum, a Narnian Marshwiggle, is to accompany them. Aslan, when giving Jill this quest, listed for her the four signs that if followed would bring them success. Along the way, she was to keep reciting the signs so as not to forget them and miss the landmarks. Although she started with good intentions to keep reciting them, she eventually fell prey to several distractions, causing the three travelers to get into some scary situations. As the story continues, Aslan shows up and offers grace, making it possible to continue the journey. I have needed this story to remind me how daily remembering God’s promises and his words are a means of grace in my life.\n\nAnother Chronicles of Narnia tale, The Horse and His Boy, has also been helpful to my imagination. Not only is it a great adventure story, it’s a long, lovely parable of God’s providence. Throughout the story, Shasta deals with several scary situations and assumes it’s been fierce lions that have been following him on his journey and causing his hardships. In the end we learn what has been following him, as well as explanations him and the reader better understand what actually has been going on. This big reveal still continues to remind me of the providential hand of God; when my days are hard, I can remember Jesus promises to always be with me even when I don’t understand my circumstances and that he is the good shepherd leading me through dark valleys.\n\nThe following is a compilation of books to inspire you and the children (of various ages) in your life as you all continue into 2022. May these stories enlarge and strengthen your spirit and mind for the year ahead. This list has been compiled with the help of my editing team and a couple writers of Wild Things and Castles in the Sky: Choosing the Best Books for Children (coming out this March!), as well as several book-loving friends.\n\nI recommend:\n\nExtra Yarn by Marc Barnett | Illustrations by Jon Klassan\n\nA young girl has a box of magical yarn. Through the book she keeps knitting things for the people in her community; the yarn never runs out. After finishing the book, I kept thinking that this was a wonderful picture of what it means to use one’s gifts for one’s people and how the love of Jesus in us is never ending.\n\nThe Hobbit, or There and Back Again by JRR Tolkien\n\nI love Bilbo. I love how he finds the Took in him to go on an adventure with Gandalf and the dwarves. And I love how over the course of the journey he becomes a hero and a true friend. During the first half of the book, he keeps pining for all the good things of his home. But as he continues the adventure, he finds all the ways he is able to complete the job he is given, making he return home sweet. This is one of my very favorite books to teach middle school students— many interesting things in the story to enjoy and to talk about.\n\nCarved in Ebony: Lessons From the Black Women Who Shape Us by Jasmine Holmes\n\nBe inspired by ten black women who served God in extraordinary ways. Benefit from the research of Jasmine Holmes on these women and learn how these women, although not remembered in history books, have been important to the growth of the God’s Body, the church. As the website says, “This book is an unapologetic rejoicing in the fact that God chose to make each woman profiled in this book black and female for his glory, and it was good.”\n\nLife in the Big Story: Your Place in God’s Unfolding Story by Heidi Johnson\n\nHeidi deftly and wonderfully works through the book of Deuteronomy and other Scriptures to help us see how we are called to live a life glorifying to God. A wonderful way to biblically inform your imagination, and learn how the Old Testament (Deuteronomy) and the New Testament (John and Ephesians) are connected and inform how we live like we belong to God.\n\nWhat kind of reader are you? Maybe you’re a disciplined reader, who ends each day with a few chapters of a new novel. Maybe you loved reading growing up, but can’t seem to find a book you love or time to read in your everyday life. Maybe, like me, you collect books and reading is a full-time hobby; you have a favorite local bookstore, you’re excited for new releases from favorite authors, and you always have a book or two going at the same time.\n\nPerhaps you also have a unique relationship to New Year’s Resolutions (which I refused to participate in, for the last four years. As a new teacher, it felt like every day was already full of resolutions: Russian doll lists of lists to accomplish, each day ending with a slew of new ideas, better strategies, and another set of to-do’s.) Whether resolutions are a fun reset to a new season, or guilt-inducing promises for which you know you’ll need a do-over come February, there is something satisfying about setting a goal and pursuing it, day by day.\n\nWhen I finally decided to pick a resolution for 2021, I decided it would be around reading and the gratifying discipline of cultivating new rhythms. Reading is the way I learn, my medium for excitement and delight in life, and the way I relax. When I decided to read 52 books in 2021 (finishing about a book a week) the resolution was about practicing something I already knew I loved. The challenge wasn’t learning a new hobby, or mastering a discipline that felt like a chore, but keeping track of the books I read, making time to sit down and read, and keeping pace, as the busy-ness of each new season changed my reading rhythms from month to month.\n\nWhether you’re planning to read a hundred books this year, or you hope to finish the two titles that have been colorful coasters for the coffee mug on your bedside table since last Christmas, these reading tips and resolution ideas will motivate new and seasoned readers alike. And don’t miss the recommendations listed below! These titles are an excellent addition to your 2022 book lists.\n\n1. SET A GOAL, NUMBERS OPTIONAL\n\nWhen we think of book lists, we often think about reading a certain number of books. One book a month, or a solid-sounding 25. This year, switch it up by crafting your reading list with intentional themes or creative significance, with three ideas below.\n\nBe a Completist\n\nFor 2022, one of my non-numerical goals is to be a “reading completist” for an author or two who I already love. Prolific authors like Madeleine L’engle, Zora Neale Hurston, and Beverly Cleary, have published books across genre and generation, and tracking down every book they’ve written is rewarding treasure hunt. I’m looking forward to feeling like a L’engle, Hurston, or Cleary scholar by the end of 2022. Bonus points for reading in order of publication— what an enriching journey into one writer’s growth!\n\nRead More __________.\n\nDo you love fiction, but want to read more poetry? Do you find yourself mostly reading the classics, and hope to meet some new authors this year? Does your younger reader return to the same series over and over? It’s time to branch out! In 2021, I filled in this blank with “re-reads.” I wanted to revisit the novels and memoirs I spent much of my college years nodding along to, and foisting into the hands of those around me. Did I still love them as much as I did several presidents ago? Which lines would find me with new solace in this new season of life? And perhaps most intimidating: did they still hold up? Whatever you fill in the blank to read more of this year— Writers of Color, philosophers from the 18th century, YA books, or theology, taking inventory of the books you love and those you haven’t met yet could spark a new list for 2022!\n\nPick a Number, Any Number\n\nPick your age, “22” for 2022, or a number corresponding to an anniversary, to determine how many books you want to read this year. A playful numerical decision-maker could be just the thing to set a big numerical reading goal, or mark a specific life season with your book list this year. With young children or middle grade readers, this could be a fun discussion and activity, if you are preparing for the new year as a family. Picture child-decorated posters, with their number (a random choice, their age or grade) and book list, with space beside each book for their thoughts! Add a one to five star rating or a drawing of their favorite scene, upon completion.\n\n2. START A NO-BOOK BOOK CLUB\n\nWho are your book people? They may be friends in real life, readers you’ve interacted with through social media, or the people in your home. A “no-book book club” meets once a month, at the end of the month. Surrounded by stacks of finished books and to-be-read books, snacks and beverages (perhaps with a theme!) readers talk to the group about what they read that month, and what they are excited about reading in the next month, sharing takeaways and quotes with one another.\n\nAs much as I love reading and discussing books, the traditional book club with one book a month that participants invariably finish or don’t (and I’ve been both parties…) can give readers homework-feelings about an otherwise vacation of a book. Have you ever picked a favorite title for a group with delight and anticipation, and then just looked at it, the bright cover staring back at you from a bag or bookshelf, until the event comes? The spark is gone; the book is suddenly a chore, regardless of its true readability, or the initial excitement of choosing it. No-Book Book Clubs, without one assigned book, allow readers to share their stacks, share the joy of finishing a good book, and even allow readers to share physical copies, without a deadline, celebrating the diversity of different styles of reading.\n\nSpeaking of homework feelings…\n\n3. START THE NEW YEAR WITH GUILT-LESS READING\n\nWhen I shared my big 2021 reading goal, or another book I had finished with friends, I started to notice one consistent response: guilt. Friends, content with their already-full and fruitful lives (without a passionate interest in reading), expressed resentment at their lack of time to read, nervousness about a half-finished book begun a year ago, and instead of discussing characters, plot, or ideas, we would talk at length about how to feel less guilty about not reading— or I would be asked to give an explanation for how in the world I had all that time to read. What was being left out? There’s a time for everything, and every conversation that went this way was beneficial in its own way, but these discussions left me feeling fierce resolve for my friends and fellow readers, full of new questions: how can we take the guilt out of reading? Where did we inherit this idea that instead of feeding our families, catching up with friends on social media, or enjoying a new album on the commute, we should be reading?\n\nIf book-guilt of any variety plagues your would-be reading life, if your current season has changed your once-insatiable reading habits, or if you’ve always wanted to be a reader, but have never understood the hype, here are a few tips:\n\nPick a time, and make time\n\nWhether it’s with morning coffee, or as you relax after a long day, delegating fifteen minutes of reading during an already cozy, enjoyable moment of the day, makes reading feel like the act of leisure it is, and reinforces reading as your time. To incubate and reset before the kids wake up, to take a breather with lunch, or to mark the end of another day. Meals are another great time to include a read-aloud, while forks and knives clink, or as a treat with dessert!\n\nHave book, can travel\n\nKeep a novel you’ve always wanted to finish reading, or a deep and thoughtful nonfiction title with you in the passenger seat, for the parent pick-up line, instead of scrolling during an oil change, or in a long line at the grocery store. Every paragraph counts, and the near-counter-cultural move of pulling out a paperback instead of a screen can feel luxurious and like a break in and of itself, especially if your usual days don’t always include a quiet hour to read.\n\nTrust your boredom (Precious is for moments, not books)\n\nIf you’re bored, it’s not a sign to push through and fake it for another few chapters— even if (especially if) it’s a classic or comes highly recommended from other readers. Reading has become another “good thing you know you should be doing.” And getting lost in a book is too fun, and your time is too valuable to make reading another “should” that shadows a full to frenetic life with additional worry. Don’t make reading a burden it was never meant to be. Don’t let the idea of reading, book choice, or time spent reading, keep you from reading what you love, when you’re able. Why read if it’s another “should?” (If you’re a college student or an English major, my prayers are with you. Make it fun.)\n\nI read to furnish the living room of my mind. (Motto: It’s your room, and you get to hang whatever art you want.) So, trust your boredom, and switch it up.\n\nAnd while some things are sacred, sometimes “preciousness” around how you read, what you read, and where you read, can discourage motivated readers. Get out a pen for that hardback theology title and add your own thoughts (and question marks). Include a start and end date, and a doodle or two in the front cover of your favorite new novel. For some, this is an aesthetic preference. For me, reading is a sacred practice, but physical books are made to be consumed! My books are wrinkled friends: dog-eared, enjoyed in pools and on picnics, and bursting with marginalia. Reading without rules around perceived preciousness could be just the thing to unlock a sense of fun, delight, and play in your 2022 reading. For instance, when I read nonfiction and the sentences start to swirl, I start from the last chapter, and read from there, or open the book in the middle.\n\nSo, If you’ve heard it’s a great book and you just can’t get into it, sell it, gift it, or bury it. I’ve been reading long enough to know, books find you when you need them, and especially when you want them. To this end, I’m saving most of the Russians, all of Dickens, and (apologies to my brilliant teachers) all but a few Jane Austen novels until I’m at least 60. There are just too many books I can’t wait to read right now.\n\nA few favorites (chuck if bored):\n\nPicture books (best served with family dinner or Saturday pancakes)\n\nThis Moose Belongs to Me by Oliver Jeffers\n\nThe O in Hope by Luci Shaw\n\nGod’s Very Good Idea: A True Story about God’s Delightfully Different Family by Trillia Newbell\n\nMiddle grade (blanket forts and staying up late encouraged)\n\nThe Vanderbeekers of 141st Street by Karina Yan Glazer\n\nThe Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster\n\nSpiritual Formation\n\nGentle and Lowly by Dane Ortlund\n\nNailed It: 365 Readings for Angry or Worn-Out People by Anne Kennedy\n\nTheology\n\nNaming the Animals: An Invitation to Creativity by Stephen Roach\n\nLifting the Veil: Imagination and the Kingdom of God by Malcolm Guite\n\nLiterary Fiction\n\nAmericanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\n\nHome by Marilynne Robinson\n\nCultural Criticism\n\nPulphead by John Jeremiah Sullivan\n\nMemoir\n\nEverything Happens for a Reason (and other Lies I’ve Loved) by Kate Bowler\n\nThe Place Trilogy by Margie Haack\n\nPick up a few from your favorite local shop, or one of our favorites like Hearts and Minds Bookstore and Eighth Day Books.
