        "text": "Welcome Back-\n\nIn this section, Miri asks some of her friends if they think she’s a burden. And their reply was “No.” While Marda’s leg is broken, Miri starts to teach her to read. The girls must take a test to see who gets to go to the ball, and use quarry-speech to help each other with the answers. When the girls vote for Academy Princess, they majority votes Miri. Miri and Katar are talking about who wants to marry the Prince. The girls have time to study on their own before the Prince arrives. All the girls get fitted for their dresses and Miri is thinking she forgotten. The Prince arrives at the academy and all the girls are trying to get a better view of him. All the girls attend the ball except for a sick Britta. After the Prince’s departure, bandits break into the academy and hold the girls, Olana, and Knut hostage."
