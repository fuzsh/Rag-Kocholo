I am an oral surgeon and I have been working in Camarillo for the past year and in Lompoc for the past 6 years. I’m originally from Turlock, CA and attended UC Berkeley for my undergraduate studies. I met my wife, Amy Buehler, while playing water polo there. We both attended USC School of Dentistry and went on to complete residencies at the University of Michigan (Amy is a pedodontist at Camarillo Children’s Dental Group). We moved back to California to be closer to our families in 2012 and are so happy to call the central coast our home! We have three young sons (Casey, Cody, and Charlie) who are the lights of our lives.\n\nMy name is Jesse Lanzon.
