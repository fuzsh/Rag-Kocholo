        "text": "One of the nice things about Lompoc is that it is nautical, which means that parts of it are somewhat historic and touch the ocean or tidal bodies of water, such as inlets and bays. Because of this, visitors and locals will often go to these areas to take in the scenery or to enjoy waterfront activities.\n\nLike elsewhere in America, most people in Lompoc use a private automobile to get to work. But notably, a substantial number of Lompoc‘s citizens do make use of public transit in their daily commute, primarily riding the bus. This helps more people get to work with less air pollution, and require fewer highways to get them there.\n\nThe percentage of people in Lompoc with college degrees is quite a bit lower than the national average for cities and towns of 21.84%: just 12.75% of people over 25 have a bachelor's degree or advanced degree.\n\nThe per capita income in Lompoc in 2022 was $27,387, which is lower middle income relative to California and the nation. This equates to an annual income of $109,548 for a family of four. However, Lompoc contains both very wealthy and poor people as well.\n\nLompoc is an extremely ethnically-diverse city. The people who call Lompoc home describe themselves as belonging to a variety of racial and ethnic groups. People of Hispanic or Latino origin are the most prevalent group in Lompoc, accounting for 61.27% of the city’s residents (people of Hispanic or Latino origin can be of any race). The greatest number of Lompoc residents report their race to be White, followed by Asian. Important ancestries of people in Lompoc include German, English, Irish, Italian, and European.\n\nForeign born people are also an important part of Lompoc's cultural character, accounting for 22.61% of the city’s population.\n\nThe most common language spoken in Lompoc is English.
