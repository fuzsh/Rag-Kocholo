        "text": "Lompoc ( LOM-pohk; Chumash: Lum Poc) is a city in Santa Barbara County, California. Located on the Central Coast, Lompoc had a population of 44,444 in the 2020 census.\n\nLompoc has been inhabited for thousands of years by the Chumash people, who called the area Lum Poc, meaning \"stagnant waters\" or \"lagoon\" in the local Purisimeño language. The Spanish called the area Lompoco after Fermín de Lasuén had established Mission La Purísima in 1787. In 1837, the Mexican government sold the area as the Rancho Lompoc land grant. Following the American Conquest of California, multiple settlers acquired the Lompoc Valley, including William Welles Hollister, who sold the land around the mission to the Lompoc Valley Land Company, which established a temperance colony which incorporated in 1888 as Lompoc. Lompoc is often considered a military town because it is near Vandenberg Space Force Base.\n\nHistory\n\nPrior to the Spanish conquest, the area around Lompoc was inhabited by the Chumash people. La Purisima Mission was established in 1787 near what is now the southern edge of the city. Purisimeño, a Chumashan language, was spoken in the region during the mission period. After an earthquake destroyed the mission in 1812, it was relocated to its present location 1 mile (1.6 km) northeast of the present city. After independence from the Spanish Empire, the First Mexican Empire was established in 1821. The Mexicans secularized the Spanish missions in 1833, and La Purisima Mission gradually fell into ruins.\n\nThe coastal branch of the Southern Pacific Railroad replaced ship transportation around 1900. In 1893, a diatomaceous earth mine opened in the southern hills in Miguelito Canyon. It became (and still is) the largest marine diatomite mine in the world, and at one time was the largest employer in the valley. In the 1940s, Grefco, another diatomaceous earth company, moved to Lompoc. It ceased operations in 1998, but the remnants of its mine can still be seen at the northeast end of town. In 1909, the Sibyl Marston—at the time, the largest steam schooner built on the West Coast—sank nearby while carrying 1,100,000 board feet (2,600 m3) of lumber. Many of the older Lompoc homes were built with lumber from the shipwreck. The wreckage can still be seen south of Surf Beach.\n\nA paved road linked Lompoc to Buellton and the rest of California around 1920. In 1923, the Honda Point disaster, the U.S.'s largest peacetime naval accident, occurred just off the coast; nine U.S. destroyers ran aground, killing 23 people. During the Great Depression, La Purisima Mission was restored by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). During World War II, the coast west of Lompoc was the site of Camp Cooke, a United States Army training camp where large units could practice maneuvers.\n\nLompoc grew slowly until 1958, when the United States Air Force announced that the former Camp Cooke would be a test site for the Thor family of intermediate-range ballistic missiles and the first operational base for the SM-65 Atlas, an intercontinental ballistic missile. The city then began to grow rapidly to provide housing for thousands of civilians and contractors employed at what was soon renamed Vandenberg Air Force Base. It was the first missile base of the United States Air Force.\n\nThe Space Shuttle program was slated to begin launches in the late 1980s, and the city experienced a boom in restaurant and hotel construction in anticipation of tourists coming to see shuttle launches. However, when the Challenger exploded during take-off from Cape Canaveral in 1986, the West Coast shuttle program was terminated, sending Lompoc into a severe recession.\n\nToday, Lompoc is called \"The City of Arts and Flowers\" and is also becoming known for its wines.\n\nGeography\n\nLompoc is located at (34.646182, -120.460316). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 11.7 square miles (30 km2), 99.34% of it land and 0.66% of it water.\n\nMost of the city is in the valley of the Santa Ynez River, at an elevation of about 80–100 feet (25–30 meters); recent expansion has been to the north, on higher ground known as Vandenberg Village, with elevations of 150–300 feet (50–100 meters). Like most rivers in Southern California, the Santa Ynez River does not have a surface flow for most of the year. Underground flow in the sandy river bed recharges the aquifer beneath the city, from which nine wells (with a tenth one planned) supply the city with water. Unlike many other cities in Southern California, Lompoc is not connected to the State Water Project.\n\nClimate\n\nLompoc has a cool Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification Csb), typical of coastal California. The city is mostly sunny, with an ocean breeze. Fog is common. Snow is virtually unknown. The highest recorded temperature was 110 °F (44 °C) in 1987, and the lowest recorded temperature was 15 °F (-9 °C) in 2013.\n\nDemographics\n\nHistorical population Census Pop. %± 1880 226 — 1890 1,015 349.1% 1900 972 −4.2% 1910 1,482 52.5% 1920 1,876 26.6% 1930 2,845 51.7% 1940 3,379 18.8% 1950 5,520 63.4% 1960 14,415 161.1% 1970 25,284 75.4% 1980 26,267 3.9% 1990 37,649 43.3% 2000 41,103 9.2% 2010 42,434 3.2% 2020 44,444 4.7% U.S. Decennial Census\n\n2010\n\nIn the 2010 United States Census, Lompoc had a population of 42,434.

The shop opened in May 2009 and offers guitar lessons, consigned musical instruments and live performances.\n\nLocal artists\n\nOne of Lompoc’s most successful musical artists is the rock band Saint Anne’s Place, which was formed in 2008 and originally featured Jacob Cole, Samuel Cole, JT Wild and Clive Hacker. Today, its members are the Coles and their cousin, Joel, a bassist. They grew up playing in their families' blues bands and released their first EP, Speak Easy, in 2011. The band’s music has been described as a \"blistering yet rustic mix of blues, psychedelia, and folk rock with the chops of players twice their senior\". In 2011, they won the Santa Barbara Independent battle of the bands. They released their second EP, The Earth Shaker, in December 2012 to positive reviews by the local media.\n\nEmily Wryn is a Lompoc songwriter whose music has been featured on NPR’s Morning Becomes Eclectic. Her first EP, Head on Straight, was released in February 2012, and she played at the Indie Week festival in Ireland in April 2014. Wryn also collaborates with a local band, Saint Anne’s Place, in a group called The Lights Electric.\n\nAnother band, Millions, led by Randall Sena, plays along the Central Coast. Sena recorded and produced Wryn’s Head on Straight and Saint Anne’s Place’s Speak Easy in his recording studio, Certain Sparks.\n\nLompoc Theatre\n\nThe Lompoc Theatre, which opened in 1927, was owned and operated by the Calvert family for many years. It encountered financial trouble in the 1970s because of competition from multiplexes and television. The last time a movie was shown on its screen was in 1985.\n\nIn July 2003, a non-profit group, the Lompoc Housing and Community Development Corporation, announced plans to restore the theater. With the assistance of the city, the LHCDC was able to raise funds to buy the theater. By March 2008, the cost of renovating the building was estimated at just under $10 million. The LHCDC was unable to raise the money needed for renovations, and the building accumulated three liens. It was eventually sold to a grassroots group called the Lompoc Theatre Project, which hopes to reopen the theatre in 2017.\n\nLompoc Pops Orchestra\n\nThe Lompoc Pops Orchestra has been performing for 20 years. Composed of approximately 45 semi-professional musicians, under the direction of Dr. Brian Asher Alhadeff, its four annual performances include musicals, Broadway hits, jazz pieces, big band, gospel and patriotic music.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nIn the late 1960s, Quaker Oats had a marketing campaign that pitted two of its cereal mascots, Quisp and Quake, against each other in a race from Long Island to Lompoc.\n\nThe 1960s animated cartoon series Roger Ramjet, whose creators hailed from Lompoc, had many references to the city, which was the titular character's hometown.\n\nThe W.C.

Other mainstays of the economy include the Federal Correctional Institution, the diatomaceous earth mine (today owned by Imerys), the Lompoc Oil Field and associated oil processing facilities north of town, and agriculture (especially seed flowers and vegetables).\n\nWine production and wine tourism make up an expanding agricultural sector. Lompoc Valley is the gateway to the Sta. Rita Hills AVA wine appellation, internationally recognized for premium pinot noir and chardonnay. Thirty premium boutique wine labels are produced in Lompoc. Numerous other wineries are located along State Route 246 and on Santa Rosa Road. Tasting rooms are located in various parts of Lompoc.\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, many workers employed in Santa Barbara and Goleta have moved to Lompoc to take advantage of lower housing costs, effectively making Lompoc a bedroom community of Santa Barbara.
