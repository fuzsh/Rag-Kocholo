        "text": "California City Nicknames\n\nSlogans Help Put California Cities on the Map\n\nBy C. MacDonald\n\nMy late friend, Bill Arballo, former Mayor of Del Mar, once told me of a slogan the city had, \"Park your car in old Del Mar.\" That got me thinking about other fun slogans that were used officially or unofficially in other California cities.\n\nSome of them had a nice poetic ring, like \"Take pride in Oceanside;\" \"Eat a peach in Solana Beach;\" \"Tan your carcass in old San Marcos;\" \"Meet your sister in downtown Vista,\" and \"It's neato in Escondido.\" I like stuff that rhymes.\n\nBut other Golden State cities became known for certain things: Castroville, \"The artichoke center of the world;\" Pacifica, \"The fog capital of California,\" and Orange, \"A slice of Old Town charm.\"\n\nSanta Maria used to known as \"The Center of the Best,\" and Torrance, \"Halfway to everywhere.\" Bakersfield, \"California's Country Capital,\" Santa Clarita, \"Where the good life takes you,\" Chico, \"Where everything grows,\" Greenfield, \"Broccoli Capital of the World,\" and Bishop, \"Mule Packers Capital of the world.\"\n\nDoes your city have a slogan? If not, why not create one.
