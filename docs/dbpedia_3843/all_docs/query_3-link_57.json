Printing.--The term ``printing'' as used in these regulations shall be construed to include and apply to the processes of composition, platemaking, presswork, binding, and microform; the equipment as classified in the tables in Title II and used in such processes; or the end items produced by such processes and equipment. 1-2. Composition.--Composition as used in these regulations applies to the setting of type by hot-metal casting, phototypesetting, or electronic character generating devices for the purpose of producing camera copy, negatives, a plate or image to be used in the production of printing or microform. 1-3. Microform.--The term ``microform,'' as used in these regulations, applies to any product, produced in miniaturized image format, for mass or general distribution and as a substitute for conventionally printed material, but not including microfilming of administrative records, accounting reports, or similar items. 2-1. Duplicating/Copying.--The term ``duplicating/copying'' as used in these regulations means that material produced by use of (a) equipment listed in column 2 of the equipment tables and (b) duplicating equipment employing the lithographic process; and automatic copy-processing or copier-duplicating machines employing electrostatic, thermal, or other copying processes: Provided, That work exceeding 5,000 production units of any one page, and work exceeding 25,000 production units in the aggregate of multiple pages, shall not be done without prior authority of: (a) the Central Printing and Publications Management Organization as provided in paragraph 30 of these regulations; or (b) the Joint Committee on Printing. 2-2. A report shall be forwarded to the Committee not later than 30 days after the close of each quarter, listing individual jobs by title, quantity (pages and copies), date, and where done, which exceed either the 5,000 or 25,000 production units. 2-3. Microform Duplicating.--The term ``Microform Duplicating,'' as used in these regulations, means the production of not more than 250 duplicates from original microform, as defined in paragraph 7-2. 3. Department.--The term ``department'', as used in these regulations, means any executive or military department or independent agency and temporary or permanent committees and commissions of the Government. 4-1. Printing Plant.--The term ``printing plant,'' as used in these regulations, means any plant which produces ``printing'' as defined in paragraph 1, owned or operated wholly or in part by the Government or at Government expense, and shall include all such plants located on property owned or controlled by the Government. No printing plant shall be operated without prior authorization of the Joint Committee on Printing. No plant shall be moved from the building in which it was authorized for operation, or disestablished, without prior authority of the committee. No printing plant may be operated by a commercial contractor without prior approval of the Joint Committee on Printing. 4-2. Authorized plants shall be equipped to produce only that work which is not deemed to be commercially procurable. All work that can be procured within the necessary time constraints, except as provided in paragraph 49-2 of these regulations, will be forwarded to the Government Printing Office or its Regional Printing Procurement Office, as the case may be, for commercial procurement under contracts established for that purpose. Departments are required to solicit the opinion of the GPO as to the procurability of their individual printing requirements. 4-3. Map and Chart Printing Plants.--These plants are authorized to produce multicolor flat and/or folded maps and charts without referral to GPO procurement offices. In-house production, however, is limited to maps and charts, with all other supporting publications to be procured commercially through the GPO unless otherwise authorized by the Joint Committee on Printing. Only those departments which are authorized to operate map and chart printing plants have the option to procure map and chart work directly from commercial sources or through GPO procurement offices. 5. Government Printing Office Regional Printing Procurement Office (GPO-RPPO).--This term means any office, established by the Public Printer in accordance with Joint Committee on Printing authorization, which shall procure Federal printing needs which are determined to be commercially procurable. Except for orders submitted to the GPO Central Office and those placed by departments on direct-deal contracts authorized by GPO, all orders must be forwarded to the nearest GPO- RPPO. The GPO-RPPO will determine the area of bid competition, considering all factors, including lead-time and transportation costs. 6. Federal Printing.--This term means all printing as defined in paragraph 1 for the use of all departments, irrespective of the place of production or procurement origin or ultimate end-use. Determination as to where Federal printing is to be requisitioned shall be made by the head of each department through a central printing and publications management service, as defined in paragraph 30, in accordance with the collective provisions provided in paragraphs 4, 5, 28, and 46. 7-1. Production Unit.--A production unit means one sheet, size 8\\1/2\\ x 11 inches (215 x 280 mm), one side only, one color. 7-2. Microform Production Unit.--A production unit for microform, for the purposes of these regulations, is defined as one roll of microfilm 100 feet in length or one microfiche. 7-3. All production from presses of whatever size shall be computed on the basis of the unit size of press multiplied by the number of impressions obtained from the individual press concerned. For example: Units 11 by 17 inches or less (10\\3/4\\ x 14\\1/4\\ maximum image)............. 1 11 by 17 inches or less, tandem (10\\3/4\\ x 14\\1/4\\ maximum image).. 2 11 by 17 inches...................... 2 14 by 20 inches...................... 2 15 by 18 inches...................... 2 11 by 17 inches, tandem.............. 4 17 by 22 inches...................... 4 19 by 25 inches...................... 4 22 by 29 inches...................... 6 22 by 34 inches...................... 8 23 by 36 inches...................... 8 25 by 38 inches...................... 10 23 by 36 inches, perfecting.......... 16 34 by 44 inches...................... 16 45 by 48 inches...................... 24 42 by 58 inches...................... 28 48 by 54 inches...................... 30 ENGLISH-METRIC CONVERSION TABLE English Metric Equivalent 10 \\3/4\\\" x 14\\1/4\\\"................. 273 x 362 mm 11\" x 17\"............................ 279 x 432 mm 14\" x 20\"............................ 356 x 508 mm 15\" x 18\"............................ 381 x 457 mm 17\" x 22\"............................ 432 x 559 mm 19\" x 25\"............................ 483 x 635 mm 22\" x 29\"............................ 559 x 737 mm 22\" x 34\"............................ 559 x 864 mm 23\" x 36\"............................ 584 x 914 mm 25\" x 38\"............................ 635 x 965 mm 34\" x 44\"............................ 864 x 1118 mm 45\" x 48\"............................ 1143 x 1219 mm 42\" x 58\"............................ 1067 x 1473 mm 48\" x 54\"............................ 1219 x 1372 mm TITLE II: EQUIPMENT ---------- 8-1.

Equipment: Purchase, Rental, or Transfer.--Procedure for the purchase, rental, or transfer of printing, binding, and related or auxiliary equipment, as listed in columns 1 and 2 of the four tables in paragraph 8, shall be as follows: (a) The purchase, rental, or transfer of column 1 items require prior approval of the Joint Committee on Printing. All requests for prior approval of the committee to acquire equipment shall contain justification for its need, name and location of installation where needed, size (11- by 17-inch presses must show unit or plate image size), and shall be submitted in duplicate. (b) Purchase requests must show make (or equal) and estimated cost, together with expected trade-in allowance, if applicable; transfer requests must show make, age, condition, serial number, and estimated value; and rental requests must show make (or equal), and rental cost. When any transaction requiring prior approval of the Joint Committee on Printing has been completed, the committee shall be immediately notified thereof on form accompanying the authorization. (c) Joint Committee on Printing authorizations to purchase, rent or transfer equipment, except as otherwise provided as a part of the approval, are void after one year unless completed by action, or by obligation of funds. (d) Requests for authority to rent equipment, unless otherwise indicated, will be considered to be lease-purchase or purchase option arrangements. Until equipment is purchased, such authorizations will be subject to renewal annually. (e) The JCP approval number on all purchase and rental actions shall be cited on all advertisements and procurement documents which are related to the acquisition of JCP controlled equipment. 10. Equipment, Disposal of Excess.--Procedure for disposing of printing equipment determined by each department to be excess to its needs is as follows: (a) All items listed in columns 1 and 2 of paragraph 8 which are used in an authorized printing plant may be disposed of in accordance with existing Government surplus property disposal procedures without reference to the committee. Equipment disposals shall be reported to the committee on JCP Form No. 7 within 30 days after completion of the disposal action (cf. United States Code, Title 44, section 312). (b) To estimate the value of printing equipment: (1) Determine the normal life expectancy according to table I. (Page 30.) (2) Select the applicable condition in table 11 (page 31), column A, the normal life in column B, and (reading to the right) under C, the percentage. (3) Multiply the original cost of the equipment by the percentage. 11. New Processes.--Frequently there appear upon the market certain types of printing, binding, and related or auxiliary equipment utilizing newly developed or improved processes or new principles of operation. Before any such equipment is acquired, which will be used as a substitute for those processes described in paragraph 1, Joint Committee on Printing prior approval is required and departments shall provide the committee with all available information pertaining thereto. (Please see Joint Committee on Printing letters of February 15, 1979, on p. 57, and October 19, 1989, on p. 64). 12. Research and Development.--The Committee shall be advised and shall be supplied with all available data pertaining to departmental plans to engage in applied research and/or development which may affect printing, binding and related or auxiliary fields, contractually or otherwise. Such advice and data will be supplied the committee prior to the establishment of any contracts or the advertisement of requests for proposals. In addition, if printing or related equipment is required in conjunction with such research or as a result of the research, prior approval of the committee is necessary before procurement. TITLE III: GENERAL PROVISIONS ---------- 13. Advertisements, Commercial.--No Government publication or other Government printed matter, prepared or produced with either appropriated or nonappropriated funds or identified with an activity of the Government, shall contain any advertisement inserted by or for any private individual, firm, or corporation; or contain material which implies in any manner that the Government endorses or favors any specific commercial product, commodity, or service. The Committee is of the opinion that commercial advertising is not a proper or authorized function of the Government. Such advertisements are unfair to those who do not so advertise in that, whether intentionally or not, they are frequently made to appear to have the sanction of the Government. Furthermore, the publication of such advertisements is unjust to the public in that the advertisers profit thereby at the expense of the Government, particularly as a considerable number of the publications are circulated free, at least in part, under Government frank. Advertising in Government publications is also unfair to the publishers of other periodicals in that they generally cannot meet such competition, owing to the great advantage possessed by a Government publication. Another reason for objecting is that advertisers are apt to use Government periodicals for the purpose of currying favor with the officers issuing the same or the special class among whom such publications are circulated. This is a temptation that the Government ought not to encourage. 14. Art Signatures.--When the size of signatures on freehand art is out of proportion or relation to the design, the copy is unacceptable and shall not be printed unless the signature is removed or sufficiently reduced in size. Signatures of technical illustrators, designers, typographers, or layout artists shall not be printed. 15. Courtesy Credit Lines.--Courtesy credit lines are permissible only for uncopyrighted materials contributed or loaned by nongovernmental parties. They shall be subordinate in size of type to that of both text and legends for illustrations. When all materials have come from a single nongovernmental source, credit lines shall be given only in an undisplayed paragraph. 16-1. Publication Bylines.--The printing of Government employees' bylines in Government publications shall be confined to the authors of the articles appearing therein, and to the photographers who have originated the pictures contained therein. The authors' and photographers' bylines shall be printed in exact juxtaposition with the articles or pictures which they have created. 16-2. Publication Mastheads.--The printed mastheads of Government publications shall include the name of the publishing department or agency and its issuing bureau, branch, or office, together with the names of the department or agency head and the head of the issuing bureau, branch, or office. Additional names shall include only the names of the executive or managing editor, sports editor, feature editor, photo editor, and art editor, or their editorial equivalent officers by whatever title they are identified, unless otherwise authorized by the Joint Committee on Printing. 17. Copyright Notices.--Copyright notices shall be subordinated in size of type to that of both text and legends for llustrations. When privately copyrighted material is reprinted in a Government publication, notice of copyright is essential in order that the public not be misled. 18-1. Color Printing.--The committee recognizes that printing in two or more colors generally increases costs. Consequently, it is the responsibility of the head of any department, independent office or establishment of the Government to assure that all multicolor printing shall contribute demonstrable value toward achieving a greater fulfillment of the ultimate end-purpose of whatever printed item in which it is included. 18-2. Demonstrably valuable multicolor printing, for the purpose of these regulations, includes the following categories: (a) Maps and technical diagrams where additional color is necessary for clarity. (b) Object identification (medical specimens, diseases, plants, flags, uniforms, etc.). (c) Safety programs, fire prevention, savings bonds programs, and competitive areas of personnel recruiting. (d) Areas wherein clearly identifiable savings in costs can be soundly predicated on multicolor use. (e) Printing for programs required by law, whose relative success or failure is in direct ratio to the degree of public response, and where that response can be logically attributable to the number of colors planned and the manner in which they are proposed to be used. (f) Color for promotional or motivational purposes such as programs concerning public health, safety, consumer benefits; or to encourage utilization of Government facilities such as programs for Social Security, Medicare, and certain areas of need for veterans would come within this category. 18-3. Multicolor printing which does not meet the demonstrably valuable contribution requirement of these regulations, includes but is not exclusively limited to the following categories: (a) Printed items wherein additional color is used primarily for decorative effect. (b) Printed items where additional color is used primarily in lieu of effective layout and design. (c) Printed items where additional color is used excessively, i.e., four colors when two or three will fulfill the need; three colors when two are adequate; two colors when one is adequate. (d) Printed items wherein the inclusion of multicolor does not reflect careful, competent advanced planning which recognizes the contribution the use of color is expected to make to the ultimate end-purpose. 19. Illustrations.--Illustrations are to be used in Government printed matter only when they: (a) Relate entirely to the transaction of public business, and are in the public interest. (b) Relate directly to the subject matter and are necessary to explain the text. (c) Do not serve to aggrandize any individual. (d) Are in good taste and do not offend proper sensibilities. (e) Are restricted to the minimum size necessary to accomplish their purpose. (f) Illustrate employees actually engaged in an act or service related to their official duties. 20. Cards: Calling, Greeting.--Printing or engraving of calling or greeting cards is considered to be personal rather than official and shall not be done at Government expense. 21. Blank Books.--Blank books not available through General Services Administration but regularly carried in stock by commercial dealers and which require no printing and/or binding operation after receipt of order may be procured without obtaining a waiver from the Government Printing Office: Provided, That no order or orders for each type of blank book exceeds $500 in any one year. 22-1. Calendars, Date: Desk and Wall.--Standardized Government desk and wall calendars are the only calendars which departments are authorized to obtain at Government expense, and shall be ordered from the General Services Administration. 22-2. Style, size, and format of the standardized wall calendar, to be procured from the Government Printing Office, shall be subject to approval of the Joint Committee on Printing. Schedule and appointment sheets are not considered to be calendars. 23. Certificate of Necessity.--Section 1103, title 44, United States Code: When a department, the Supreme Court, or the Library of Congress requires printing or binding to be done, it shall certify that it is necessary for the public service. . . . 24-1. Correspondence and Liaison With Committee.--All official correspondence for the consideration of the Joint Committee on Printing is to be signed by the head of the department or an official designated by him. The Committee shall be notified in writing by the head of the department of any official so designated. In order to ensure prompt delivery, all official correspondence should be addressed as follows: Chairman, Joint Committee on Printing U.S. Senate Post Office Washington, DC 20510-6606 24-2. All matters pertaining to printing (composition, platemaking, presswork, binding, and microform), and the distribution of printed matter, shall be referred to the Committee by and through one designated source in each department. 25. Form and Style of Work for Departments.--The head of each department shall cause printing and binding for general use to be standardized. With respect to printing which is requisitioned from the Government Printing Office, attention is again directed to section 1105, title 44, United States Code, which provides that-- The Public Printer shall determine the form and style in which the printing or binding ordered by a department is executed, and the material and the size of type used, having proper regard to economy, workmanship, and the purposes for which the work is needed. The Government Printing Office Style Manual, approved by the Joint Committee on Printing, was specifically compiled and published to meet the requirements of this law. It is the opinion of the committee that deviations therefrom generally constitute a waste in public printing and binding. 26-1. Forms, Standard, Approval and Procurement of.--Standard forms are subject to the approval of the General Services Administration, or, in certain cases, the General Accounting Office or other responsible agency. 26-2. Stock standard forms shall be obtained from the Federal Supply Service (FSS) unless otherwise authorized by the General Services Administration. Deviations from stock standard forms shall be submitted to the FSS for approval prior to procurement through the Government Printing Office. 27-1. Journals, Magazines, Periodicals, and Similar Publications.-- The committee invites attention to section 1108, title 44, United States Code, relating to periodicals which reads as follows: The head of an executive department, independent agency or establishment of the Government, with the approval of the President, may use from the appropriations available for printing and binding such sums as are necessary for the printing of journals, magazines, periodicals, and similar publications he certifies in writing to be necessary in the transaction of the public business required by law of the department, office, or establishment. There may be printed, in addition to those necessary for the public business, not to exceed two thousand copies for free distribution by the issuing department, office, or establishment. The Public Printer, subject to regulation by the Joint Committee on Printing, shall print additional copies required for sale to the public by the Superintendent of Documents; but the printing of these additional copies may not interfere with the prompt execution of printing for the Government. 27-2. The term ``journals, magazines, periodicals, and similar publications'', as used in above section, shall be construed as not applying to strictly administrative reports, memoranda, and similar materials, or to strictly statistical materials, and information required exclusively for the official use of the issuing office or service in the transaction of its routine business. Such information shall be construed as being required exclusively for the use of the issuing office or service in the transaction of its routine business if not more than 2,000 copies, or not more than 10 percent of the total quantity printed, whichever is lesser, are for free distribution to other than the issuing department, office, or establishment, its official established auxiliary organizations, and other individuals and organizations required to be kept informed in the transaction of the routine business of the department, office, or establishment. 28. Legal Requirements.--Sections 501 and 502, title 44, United States Code: Sec. 501. All printing, binding, and blank-book work for Congress, the Executive Office, the Judiciary, other than the Supreme Court of the United States, and every executive department, independent office and establishment of the Government, shall be done at the Government Printing Office, except-- (1) classes of work the Joint Committee on Printing considers to be urgent or necessary to have done elsewhere; and (2) printing in field printing plants operated by an executive department, independent office or establishment, and the procurement of printing by an executive department, independent office or establishment from allotments for contract field printing, if approved by the Joint Committee on Printing. Printing or binding may be done at the Government Printing Office only when authorized by law. Sec. 502. Printing, binding, and blank-book work authorized by law, which the Public Printer is not able or equipped to do at the Government Printing Office, may be produced elsewhere under contracts made by him with the approval of the Joint Committee on Printing. 29. Legality and Necessity.--No printing, binding, or blank-book work shall be done at the Government Printing Office or at any other printing or binding office, plant, or school of the Government unless authorized by law. (See secs. 501 and 1123, title 44, U.S.C.) All printed matter issued shall be devoted to the work which the branch or officer of the Government issuing the same is required by law to undertake, and shall not contain matter which is unnecessary in the transaction of the public business or matter relating to work which any other branch of the Government service is authorized to perform. (See secs. 1102, 1113, and 1118, title 44, U.S.C.) 30. Central Printing and Publications Management Organization.--Heads of departments shall maintain under their direct supervision a central printing and publications management organization with responsibility for the conduct of a coordinated program controlling the development, production, procurement or distribution of materials through the utilization of conventional printing and binding methods or through the utilization of multiple copy microform methods. The central printing and publications management organization also will maintain responsibility and control of duplicating equipment and automatic copy- processing or copier-duplicating machines, as identified in column 2 of the equipment tables. (Please see Joint Committee on Printing letter of February 15, 1979, on p. 57.) 31. Mailing Lists.--All departments shall make necessary revisions in their mailing lists at least once each year in order to eliminate waste in Government funds caused by publications being improperly addressed or mailed to persons no longer desiring them. This method of revision shall require that persons receiving publications indicate that they wish to continue receiving the publication. Failure to reply to a mailing list revision request shall require the elimination of the addressee from the mailing list unless it is necessary in the conduct of official business to continue mailing publications to the addressee. It is the judgment of the Joint Committee on Printing that the use of titles on mailing lists in lieu of names will reduce the cost of list maintenance. 32. Mailing: Self-Mailer Technique.--The penalty or postage indicia and mailing address shall be imprinted directly upon printed materials rather than using separate envelopes for mailing whenever such technique will prove feasible and economical, and in accordance with existing postal regulations. 33. Neglect, Delay, Duplication, or Waste.--The attention of the Committee should be promptly called to ``any neglect, delay, duplication, or waste in the public printing and binding and the distribution of Government publications.'' 34-1. Paper, Standardization of.--The Committee invites attention to section 509, title 44, United States Code, relating to standards of paper, which reads as follows: The Joint Committee on Printing shall fix upon standards of paper for the different descriptions of public printing and binding, and the Public Printer, under their direction, shall advertise in six newspapers or trade journals, published in different cities, for sealed proposals to furnish the Government with paper, as specified in the schedule to be furnished applicants by the Public Printer, setting forth in detail the quality and quantities required for the public printing. The Public Printer shall furnish samples of the standard of papers fixed upon to applicants who desire to bid. 34-2. The ``Government Paper Specification Standards'' establishes specification standards of paper for the public printing and binding for the U.S. Government, including paper to be used on copying and duplicating devices as defined in paragraph 2. Unless otherwise authorized by the Joint Committee on Printing, these specifications and standards are mandatory for use by the departments of the Government in the preparation of procurement documents for paper stocks and in specifying paper stocks to be used in printing, binding, or duplicating. It is the opinion of the Committee that types, grades, or weights, other than those given under these standards generally constitute waste in public printing, and it is directed that the procurement or use of such paper types, grades, or weights, for printing, binding, or duplicating be discontinued. 34-3. Semiannual and annual contracts for paper, in general, are not in the best interests of the Government. Such procurement practices should be used only when savings in costs are clearly demonstrable. 34-4. The Public Printer is authorized and directed to furnish at cost to the departments such copies of these standards, and standard samples, as they may require in the transaction of the public business. 35-1. Printing Requirements Resulting From Contracts for Equipment and Services.--The Joint Committee on Printing does not intend that contractors shall become prime or substantial sources of printing for departments or agencies. Therefore, the inclusion of printing, as defined in paragraph 1, within contracts for the manufacture and/or operation of equipment and for services such as architectural, engineering, and research, is prohibited unless authorized by the Joint Committee on Printing. 35-2. This regulation does not preclude the procurement of writing, editing, preparation of manuscript copy, or preparation of related illustrative material as a part of contracts; or administrative printing, e.g., forms and instructional materials necessary to be used by the contractor to respond to the terms of a contract. Nor does it preclude recording manuscript copy in digital form for typesetting purposes provided coding instructions have been approved by the Central Printing and Publications Management Office. However, the printing of such material for the Government must be accomplished in accordance with printing laws and regulations. 35-3. A requirement for a contractor to duplicate less than 5,000 units of only one page, or less than 25,000 units in the aggregate of multiple pages for the use of a department or agency, will not be deemed to be printing primarily or substantially for a department or agency. For the purpose of this paragraph, such pages may not exceed a maximum image size of 10\\3/4\\ by 14\\1/4\\ inches. 35-4. A requirement for a contractor to produce or procure less than 250 duplicates from original microform, as defined in paragraph 7-2, will not be deemed to be printing primarily or substantially for a department or agency. 36-1. Printing Requirements Resulting From Grants.--The Joint Committee on Printing does not intend that grantees shall become prime or substantial sources of printing for the use of departments and agencies. Therefore, the inclusion of printing, as defined in paragraph 1, within grants is prohibited unless authorized by the Joint Committee on Printing. 36-2. This regulation does not preclude-- (a) The issuance of grants by any department or agency for the support of nongovernment publications, provided such grants were issued pursuant to an authorization of law and were not made primarily or substantially for the purpose of having material printed for the use of any department or agency. (b) The publication of findings by grantees within the terms of their grants provided that such publication is not primarily or substantially for the purpose of having such findings printed for the use of a department or agency. (c) The initiation by departments and agencies of the procurement of writing, editing, preparation of manuscript copy, or preparation of related illustrative material from grantees; or the administrative printing requirements of the grantee required to respond to the terms of the grant. Nor does it preclude recording manuscript copy in digital form for typesetting purposes provided coding instructions have been approved by the Central Printing and Publications Management Office. However, the printing of such material for the Government must be accomplished in accordance with printing laws and regulations. 36-3. A requirement for a grantee to duplicate less than 5,000 units of only one page, or less than 25,000 units in the aggregate of multiple pages of his findings for the use of a department or agency, will not be deemed to be printing primarily or substantially for a department or agency. For the purpose of this paragraph, such pages may not exceed a maximum image size of 10\\3/4\\ by 14\\1/4\\ inches. 36-4. A requirement for a grantee to produce or procure less than 250 duplicates from original microform, as defined in paragraph 7-2, will not be deemed to be printing primarily or substantially for a department or agency. 37. Private or Commercial Work.--No work of a private or commercial nature may be accomplished at any Government plant even though the Government is reimbursed therefor. (See secs. 1102 and 1118, title 44, U.S.C.) 38. Publications, by Private Publishers.--When a department uses appropriated funds to create information for publication, the printing and binding of that information is subject to the provisions of sections 103 and 501 of title 44, United States Code, and it shall not be made available to a private publisher for initial publication without the prior approval of the Joint Committee on Printing. 39-1. Publications, Free Distribution of.--Departments shall not make free distribution of any publication to any private individual or private organization in quantities exceeding 50 copies without prior approval of the Joint Committee on Printing. This quantity limitation shall not apply when the production cost of the publication to bedistributed is less than $100. 39-2. Requests for Committee approval shall list the name of the publication, the name of the person or organization desiring the same, and the number of copies desired. 39-3. This restriction includes the free distribution in bulk of any material to private individuals or organizations for redistribution to names on their mailing lists. Committee approval is not required when the initiative for distribution through nongovernmental facilities is taken by departments. (See also sec. 3204, title 39, U.S.C.) 40. Publications, Identification of.--All documents and publications printed at Government expense shall have printed thereon the name of the branch, bureau, department, or office of the Government responsible for publishing the same, the date of issuance, the title, subtitle, and series title and number when applicable. 41-1. Publications, Sale of by Superintendent of Documents.--The Superintendent of Documents will sell only those publications printed by the Government Printing Office or ordered printed through the Government Printing Office or the Government Printing Office Regional Printing Procurement Offices. This restriction on sale shall not affect the continued Catalog listing by the Superintendent of Documents of publications which are not printed by or ordered printed through the Government Printing Office. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as modifying or repealing provisions of sections 1702, 1711, and 1720 of title 44, United States Code. 41-2. Section 1902, title 44, United States Code provides: Government publications, except those determined by their issuing components to be required for official use only or for strictly administrative or operational purposes which have no public interest or educational value and publications classified for reasons of national security, shall be made available to depository libraries through the facilities of the Superintendent of Documents for public information. Each component of the Government shall furnish the Superintendent of Documents a list of such publications it issued during the previous month, that were obtained from sources other than the Government Printing Office. To meet the requirement of Monthly Catalog listing of Government publications by the Superintendent of Documents, each agency printing officer shall forward two copies of those types of Government publications cited in section 1902, title 44, United States Code, which are produced or procured through other than GPO sources to the Director, Library Programs Service (SL), Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20401. 42. Responsibility for Application and Enforcement of Regulations.-- The head of each department is responsible for the application and enforcement of these regulations and other applicable regulations and legislative provisions. (Please see Joint Committee on Printing letter of February 15, 1979, on p. 57.) 43-1. Stationery, Embossed.--The Public Printer may furnish, upon requisition, to the President of the United States, members of his Cabinet, and the Department of State (for diplomatic correspondence exclusively), such quantities of embossed stationery as may be necessary for official use. The Comptroller General, the Librarian of Congress, the Public Printer, the head of each permanent commission, independent establishment or board, and the judges of the U.S. Courts may requisition embossed noteheads or letterheads not to exceed 5,000 copies in the aggregate, and envelopes therefor in any one fiscal year: Provided, That greater quantities may be furnished upon the approval of the Joint Committee on Printing. The Public Printer shall not honor requests from any Government activity for embossing second sheets or other than standard-size envelopes. No embossed stationery other than listed above shall be produced or procured at Government expense unless authorized by the Joint Committee on Printing. 43-2. The provisions apply also to thermographic printing. 44. Stationery, Personalized.--The printing of names of officers or officials of the executive or judicial branches of the Government on official stationery and preprinted mastheads may be accomplished only after approval by the Joint Committee on Printing. Addresses and telephone numbers should be omitted in order to allow greater distribution and prevent the creation of ``frozen'' stocks frequently caused by changes. The Committee directs that no personalized second sheets shall be produced or procured at Government expense. 45. Stationery: Sizes, Quality, Weight, Printing Thereon, etc.--The Committee directs attention to the Federal Property Management Regulation which prescribes standards (sizes, grades and weights of paper, and colors of ink and paper) to be used for printing stationery and envelopes for official Government correspondence. 46-1. Waiver, Purchase of Printing by.--Section 504, title 44, United States Code provides: The Joint Committee on Printing may permit the Public Printer to authorize an executive department, independent office, or establishment of the Government to purchase direct for its use such printing, binding, and blank-book work, otherwise authorized by law, as the Government Printing Office is not able or suitably equipped to execute or as may be more economically or in the better interest of the Government executed elsewhere. 46-2. Pursuant to the above, the Public Printer is permitted to return to any department of the Government any written requisition for printing, binding, and blank-book work, otherwise authorized by law, as in his opinion he is neither able nor suitably equipped to execute or which may be more economically, or in the better interest of the Government, procured elsewhere than at the Government Printing Office or one of the Government Printing Office Regional Printing Procurement Offices. In all such instances he is hereby permitted to authorize such Government activity to procure the work direct from other sources. Such waiver, when granted, shall not be construed as an exemption from the provisions of these regulations. Upon all such returned requisitions the Public Printer shall endorse a statement that the action taken is in accordance with the provisions of section 504, title 44, United States Code. 46-3. All procurement by waiver must be identified by number and date of issuance and reported on JCP Form No. 2, ``Commercial Printing Report.'' 46-4. No department requisitioning printing from the Government Printing Office or one of the Government Printing Office Regional Printing Procurement Offices shall anticipate the release of any requisition for direct procurement, until so advised by the Public Printer. 47. Printing Facilities of Federal Prison Industries, Inc.--These facilities may be used for the production of unclassified printing. Printing services are available at the following seven locations \\2\\ and may be used by sending a purchase order direct to any one of them: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ Since the printing of the 1977 regulations, one plant was deauthorized, and six were added to the Federal Prisons Industries, Inc.
