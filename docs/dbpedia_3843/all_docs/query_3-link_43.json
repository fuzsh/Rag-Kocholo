The Authority contributes money toward this program. Under these arrangements, CenCal Health saves money because patients are not routinely taken to the emergency room, and hence CenCal Health avoids both those costs and the ambulance costs for such services — and patients are provided care that is most appropriate to their condition. The contract has proven to be cost-effective, as well as a service to our members by keeping them out of the law enforcement system, hospital emergency rooms, and the County’s Psychiatric Health Facility whenever possible.\n\nMHAT See “Mental Health Assessment Team”.\n\nMIA or MI (Medically Indigent Adult) Patients who qualify for assistance with the cost of their medical care, through separate County programs, but do qualify for Medi-Cal.
