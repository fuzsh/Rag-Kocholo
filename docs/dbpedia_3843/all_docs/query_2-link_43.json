        "text": "La Purísima Concepción is a former Spanish mission in Lompoc, California. It was the 11th of California’s 21 missions. The full name of the mission was La Purísima Concepción de María Santísima but was called La Purísima. It was named for an important Roman Catholic event involving Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ. The mission is now a California state park named La Purísima Mission State Historic Park.\n\nLa Purísima Concepción was founded by the priest Fermín Francisco de Lasuén on December 8, 1787. Unlike all the other missions, La Purísima Concepción was not built in the shape of a quadrangle (a four-sided enclosure). Instead, it was built in a straight line. The Native Americans of the area were the Chumash. The mission completely changed the Chumash way of life. They were forced to help build the mission’s buildings and aqueduct system and to raise crops and livestock. After an earthquake struck in 1812, the mission was rebuilt four miles (six kilometers) to the northwest. The mission continued to prosper with more than 20,000 cattle and sheep at times in addition to shops for weaving, pottery, and leatherwork.\n\nIn 1824 the Chumash revolted at Mission Santa Inés. The revolt spread to La Purísima. The Chumash took over the mission for about a month. The revolt caused great damage, including the death of one soldier and 16 Chumash.\n\nLa Purísima was abandoned by 1845, and by the early 1930s many of the buildings had collapsed. Reconstruction began in 1934. Many of the original buildings were fully restored. It is the most restored of all the California missions. The park offers “Mission Life Days” several times a year when local residents reenact life in the mission. The mission is a National Historic Landmark."
