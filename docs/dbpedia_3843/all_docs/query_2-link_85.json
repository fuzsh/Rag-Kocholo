Inmates must be in a car, generally organized along racial lines.\n\nOne inmate reports, “They told me on my first day that I wasn’t allowed to speak to anyone who wasn’t white. Within a day, the car came in with knives to tell me to produce my paperwork.”\n\nOthers report that the chow hall and even work assignments are segregated. One inmate stated that things have “calmed down” since the June 2017 riot. Another inmate said that “The Mexicans pretty much run the place.”\n\nLevel of Violence\n\nThere is a low level of violence at FCI Lompoc federal prison. Inmates report few fights but a significant amount of intimidation and political posturing.\n\nOne respondent stated that it is “basically very safe.” Other inmates indicated it is “seldom violent” and “violence is low but does happen.”\n\nVulnerable Populations\n\nSome Lompoc, CA prison inmates report that sex offenders, informants, and LGBT inmates can’t remain in the yard. Others say that all three groups can stay, have their tables in the chow hall, and may access the weight pile.\n\nOne respondent stated that sex offenders are typically driven out of two dorms, are not allowed in the TV rooms, and cannot use the pool hall. Another respondent stated that sex offenders are “subjected to constant verbal attacks, threats, and are not allowed to sit at most chow hall tables.”\n\nOne Lompoc prison inmate advised there is a “large gay community here which is safe.” Another respondent stated that sex offenders “roam free unbothered but are barred from TVs and the good jobs.” One respondent said that there is one transgender inmate who doesn’t appear to be harassed.\n\nGood at FCI Lompoc\n\n“I like the buildings because everything is in the same building (e.g., commissary, chow hall, theater, housing units, etc.). You don’t have to go outside if you don’t want to.”\n\n“It’s safe. The food is mostly decent. Recreation is plentiful. And the dorms are mostly quiet.”\n\n“The yard is large and has tables. There are many nice communities (gamers, musicians, students, etc.) that can make time easier.” “The food is ok, and the weather is windy but, for the most part, quite mild.”\n\n“Ok weather, weight pile, decent yard.” “Get to watch rocket launches from Vandenberg Air Force Base.” “The food is mostly edible. Nice weather. Part of the visiting room is outdoors.”\n\nBad at FCI Lompoc\n\n“Staff and politics. Abysmal selection in the Library.” “Chaotic, enclosed prison atmosphere, confining, horrible staff who lie and are disrespectful.” “While it didn’t use to be this way, now there are controlled movements.”\n\n“There is almost no job training, so inmates lack viable skills when they get out.” “The gangs run this place. The staff seems to allow, if not support, this.” “Medical care is worse than third world countries, although a few staff do try.” “The best jobs are given to very select groups.”\n\n“Many guards have an attitude and are disrespectful. No TV for sex offenders. More controlled moves than needed.”\n\n“Most staff are assholes and lie to, harass, and steal from inmates. There are individual moves for each housing unit.”\n\n“No microwaves.” “Complete disrespect from most staff and common belittling and insults.” “The water and medical care are horrible.” “Overcrowded.” “Medical doctor is a quack.”\n\n“If you’re a sex offender, homosexual, or rat, don’t come here. If you’re a stand-up guy with straight paperwork, you’ll be fine and might even appreciate the culture.” “I would not recommend it for sex offenders.”\n\n“This is the highest security Low I’ve ever been in. It has the most restrictive mailroom operations, recreation, and education movements, and getting responses from inmate staff request forms.” “Could be worse places.”\n\n“There are many Spanish inmates at this prison.” “Overall, it’s ok here. There are just too many Spanish inmates and the politics that come with them.”\n\n“Poor management; hostile, aggressive, and untrained staff.” “There is major corruption here amongst the staff.”\n\nFCI Lompoc in the News\n\nIn June 2017, Federal Correctional Institution Lompoc was locked down following a brawl in which nine prisoners and three staff members were injured. Four ambulances were called to transport the wounded to local hospitals.\n\nIn January 2015, Victor L. Curry, a prisoner at FCI Lompoc, was assaulted by fellow prisoner Kenyan Payne, resulting in a broken jaw and blindness in his left eye.

The incident occurred in April 2003.
