        "text": "CLASSIFIED SUBSTITUTE INFORMATION & INSTRUCTIONS\n\nThank you for your interest in serving as a substitute for the Lompoc Unified School District. We rely heavily on our substitutes and appreciate the support they provide to our staff.\n\nWhat is substitute work?\n\nSubstitute work is “on call” temporary work, which means you may be contacted to work with little advance notice. Your assignment may be for one day or it may last several days or longer, depending on the District’s needs.\n\nWhat type of substitute work is available?\n\nWe use many types of different substitutes. Some of the most requested types include:\n\nParaeducators (Bilingual and Special Education)\n\nClerical\n\nCustodial / Grounds\n\nChild Nutrition Workers\n\nHow do I apply?\n\nGo to https://www.governmentjobs.com/careers/lusd to submit an application to work as a substitute employee.\n\nWhat should I include in my application?\n\nInclude any information that demonstrates that you meet the minimum qualifications for the substitute position you are considering. In the work history section, make certain that you include all of your relevant work history, volunteer experience, and the amount of years you have in each of those areas. Finally, make certain that your application is complete and there is no information missing.\n\nWhom can I list as a reference?\n\nA reference is a recommendation from a person who can vouch for your qualifications for employment. Some examples of who should be listed as a reference include current and past employers (paid or volunteer work), colleagues, clients, vendors, supervisors, or someone else who can recommend you for employment. Do Not List Your Relatives as a Reference.\n\nIt is important to make certain that the names and contact information for your references listed on your application are current. If we are unable to contact your references, your application may be delayed or disqualified.\n\nWill I be required to take a test to be a substitute?\n\nSome (not all) positions require testing. If a test is required for the position for which you applied, you will be notified. Tests are held at the District Office in P-19.\n\nWhat happens after I have completed the application?\n\nOnce you complete and pass the required testing or if a test is not required, the next step is for us to complete your reference checks. Once we have completed your reference checks, we will contact you to come to our office to pick up the following materials:\n\nDOJ Fingerprints\n\nTB Test\n\nApplication Packet\n\nIs there anything else that I will need to submit for employment?\n\nThe following documents are required:\n\nFingerprint results (sent to us by the DOJ)\n\nTB test results (your responsibility to submit to HR)\n\nDriver’s License or other form of valid ID\n\nSocial Security Card\n\nWhen can I start working?\n\nYou may begin working as soon as you have received approval from the Classified HR Department.\n\nHow do I know when there is a substitute position available?\n\nOur District uses a substitute finder system called Aesop (or Frontline). This is a web-based system that allows you to search for available substitute jobs in our district. For those who prefer, you may also choose to be contacted for jobs via the telephone. Every new hire substitute will receive training on how to use the substitute system.\n\nWhat is my rate of pay?\n\nSubstitute employees are paid on step one of the position classification they are subbing in. For example, if you are subbing as a “Custodian Substitute,” you will be paid on step 1 of Range 29. The Classified Salary Schedule can be found on the District website.\n\nWhen is payday?\n\nEmployees are paid once per month on the last working day of each month. Timesheets should be submitted to payroll by the 10th of each month."
