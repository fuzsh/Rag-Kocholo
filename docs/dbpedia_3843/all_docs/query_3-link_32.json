La Purísima mission is restored to the 1820’s mission era. La Purísima hosts over 200,000 visitors each year for recreation and a chance to explore California's heritage.\n\nFounded in 1787, the La Purísima Mission land holdings once covered nearly 300,000 acres. Bordered by the Santa Maria River in the North and the Gaviota coastline in the South, the land was home to the Chumash people and Spanish settlers. The mission was best known for its hides and blankets, and at its peak two-thousand inhabitants herded as many as 24,000 cattle and sheep."
