        "text": "On Monday, August 5, Congressman Salud Carbajal hosted his ninth town of his current congressional term in Lompoc, California.\n\nThe Congressman answered questions and concerns from constituents and provided updates on recent legislative action in Washington. Topics included housing, immigration, adoption policy, the Federal Aviation Administration and launches out of Vandenberg Space Force Base, the war in Gaza, and child care affordability.\n\n“I appreciate everyone who took time out of their day to come out to my town hall Monday evening,” said Rep. Carbajal. “As I shared with those who attended: Washington dysfunction may seem like it’s at an all-time high, but thanks to laws I helped create, a lot is happening behind the scenes that you may not realize is the result of recent success I have found in actually governing and getting things done. Lompoc has benefited greatly from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and other federal funding bills, many of which have included direct funding for Lompoc that I personally fought for.”\n\nAfter an introduction from Lompoc Mayor Jenelle Osborne, Rep. Carbajal highlighted the recent range of federal investments secured for the Lompoc community with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and other federal programs he has supported throughout his tenure as Lompoc’s representative in Congress, including:\n\nNearly $10 million for Lompoc’s airport through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law\n\n$1.2 million for renovations at Pioneer Park, including new baseball fields\n\n$900,000 for expanded capacity at Lompoc Health Clinic\n\n$728,000 for public safety upgrades at the Lompoc Police Department"
