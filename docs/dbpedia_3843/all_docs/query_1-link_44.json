The Lompoc Land Company was formed and incorporated in August of 1874 for the purpose of purchasing almost 43,000 acres to establish a temperance colony. The City of Lompoc was incorporated on August 13, 1888.\n\nLompoc (/ˈlɒmpoʊk/, LOM-poke) (Purisimeño: Lompo’, “Stagnant Water”) is a city in Santa Barbara County, California, on the west coast of the United States. The name of the city is derived from a Purisimeño term, “Lum Poc”, which means “stagnant waters” or “lagoon”.\n\nLa Purisima Mission\n\nThe Spanish priest, Father Presidente Fermin de Lasuen, founded La Purisima Mission on December 8, 1787; the mission was the 11th of 21 Franciscan Missions founded in California.\n\nThe La Purisima Mission land holdings once covered nearly 470 square miles. Bordered by the Santa Maria River in the North and the Gaviota coastline in the South, the land was home to the Chumash people and Spanish settlers. The mission was best known for its hides and blankets, and at its peak inhabitants herded as many as 24,000 cattle and sheep.\n\nKeep an eye out for the International Space Station passing by!"
