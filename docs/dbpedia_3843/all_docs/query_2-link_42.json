        "text": "Aaron's or Rent-A-Center in Lompoc, CA?\n\nYour options are practically endless when looking for rent-to-own stores with furniture, electronics, appliances, and more in Lompoc, CA. There's Aaron's and Rent-A-Center, to name two top contenders. What's the best way to know which store is right for you?\n\nLompoc Aaron's vs. Rent-A-Center Lease Requirements\n\nWhen you rent-to-own the things you want, your payments are spread out over time, so you don't have to pay a big chunk of money all at one time. Before you get started with this awesome route, though, you'll have to provide a few pieces of information whether you go with Rent-A-Center or Aaron's in Lompoc. Aaron's might ask for your name, contact information, SSN, a government-issued ID, income information, and references that can vouch for you. Rent-A-Center only asks that you provide your name, DOB, contact info, income info, address, and two references at a minimum. No credit history is needed to rent from Rent-A-Center in Lompoc.\n\nAnd when it comes to payment plans offered by Aaron's and Rent-A-Center, things are a little different there, too. At Aaron's in Lompoc, you can pick a 12, 18, or 24-month payment plan. Some people think we're more flexible at Rent-A-Center since we let you pick the payment schedule that's right for your life. Make your payments weekly, every two weeks, semi-monthly, or monthly. There are lots of ways to make your payment, too. You can totally pay cash at local retailersÂ like Dollar GeneralÂ®, CVSâ¢, and 7-ElevenÂ®!\n\nHow Does Rent-A-Center and Lompoc Aaron's Product Selection Compare?\n\nGoing the rent-to-own route is all about getting the top brands and products you love as soon as possible, so it only makes sense to go with the store that has what you want! Both Rent-A-Center and Aaron's in Lompoc stock rent-to-own appliances, computers, furniture, electronics, smartphones, tools, and regularly offer discounts on individual products. Aaron's, however, does not offer rent-to-own tiresÂ in Lompoc. Rent-A-Center does! And we have some of the best tire brands, like Michelin, General and Falken. In addition, your Lompoc Rent-A-Center offers free product service, free repairs, and free same-day delivery for the term of your lease agreement. Aaron's offers free delivery but not free repairs in some situations. Both Rent-A-Center and Aaron's carry products from popular brands like Samsung, LG, Ashley Home Furniture, and Maytag.\n\nRent-A-Center vs. Lompoc Aaron's Benefits & Guarantees\n\nWe strive to give our customers amazing products and amazing perks, and we're sure that our pals at the Lompoc Aaron's do their best to accomplish the same. Aaron's Club is an optional program that's unique to Aaron's. Customers can choose to pay a monthly membership fee and in return, they get to protect their lease and take advantage of discounts at restaurants, retailers, wellness providers, and more. The Rent-A-Center benefits program is similar. It's called RAC Benefits Plus. Along with lease and product protection, RAC Benefits Plus presents members with plenty of money-saving opportunitiesÂ for things you actually buy and need, like car repair and groceries! There are a few perks we are particularly proud of here at Rent-A-Center in Lompoc, and they're unique to us. Let's start with the Rent-A-Center Worry-Free Guarantee. It puts the power of shopping in your hands, on your terms. It means there's no credit needed, you can own your item in the first six months and pay only the cash price, you can get an early purchase discount, our same-day delivery is always free, and we'll match any rent-to-own competitor's price on the same, in-stock item.** You can only get the Worry-Free Guarantee at Rent-A-Center.\n\nWhere Are Rent-A-Center & Aaron's Locations in California?\n\nRent-A-Center has more physical stores across the country than Aaron's, so you're more likely to find a Rent-A-Center near you than an Aaron's near you in Lompoc. Aaron's has 1,300 stores and counting, while Rent-A-Center is pushing 3,000+ locations. Convenience and proximity mean something when you need flexible payment methods and quick delivery.\n\nAt the end of the day, we encourage you to choose the rent-to-own company that's best for your situation. Check out real customer reviews, read company news, and order affordable rent-to-own appliances, furniture, electronics, computers, and more!"
