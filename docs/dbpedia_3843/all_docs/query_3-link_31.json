The exhibition will be available to the public from March 2, 2024, through September 2, 2024.\n\nEach artist brings a unique perspective to their pollinating subjects. For instance, artist Ava Roth works with honeybees to produce artworks using bee-created honeycombs. Susan Mcdonnell is producing new paintings showcasing lesser-known pollinators such as bats and butterflies. Elizabeth Weber’s photos spotlight dwindling monarch butterfly populations, aiming to encourage the planting of native species. And finally, Cynthia James is creating art that reflects the risks faced by pollinators like bees due to pesticides.\n\nWe are delighted to also be collaborating with the Cheadle Center For Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration at UC Santa Barbara. The Cheadle Center’s contribution is focused on native bees, including high-resolution images of rare, local bees from the UCSB Natural History Collection and images of bees visiting flowers of native plants for an up-close look at their beauty and biodiversity. Cheadle Center Director, Katja Seltmann, a bee biologist, will present a performative discussion and Q&A about bee natural history that includes bees for viewing under the microscope and music.

The exhibition will be on display from August 10th through October 27th. An opening reception will be held on Saturday, August 10 from 5:00 -7:00 p.m. The public is invited to join. There is no charge for admission.\n\nSteenholdt Borke’s unique hand-crafted sculptures in clay are an extraordinary testament to the artist’s profound connection with nature and her deep fascination with the relationships between humans and animals. Each piece is meticulously developed, created, and finished in her workshop, where they are kiln-fired, glazed, and often adorned with gold accents. These one-of-a-kind specimens invite viewers into a world where symbolism and artistic expression merge.\n\nCentral to Borke’s collection is her iconic Filihankat, a recurring motif of the lion in various shapes and forms. This symbol stems from her childhood experiences and a significant memento mori—a human skull with loose teeth—from her mother’s bookcase, paired with the poignant image of the dying lion monument in Lucerne, Switzerland, sculpted by Danish artist Bertel Thorvaldsen. These influences have led Borke to explore the imagery of a lion not as a symbol of suffering, but as one of joy and resilience.\n\nBorke’s sculptures extend beyond the lion motif, embracing a rich array of animals, including owls, birds, foxes, dogs, and squirrels. Each piece is imbued with layers of symbolism, drawing the observer into a reflective journey through nature’s diverse profusion and the intrinsic connections within.\n\n“We are honored to host Marianne Steenholdt Borke’s extraordinary collection,” said Elverhøj Executive Director, Sandie Mullin “Her sculptures are not only visually stunning but also deeply thought-provoking, inviting viewers to reflect on their own perceptions and the interconnectedness of all living beings.”\n\nThe Lion Has to Be Happy is a traveling exhibit sponsored by the National Foundation of Danish America and ScanDesign. Elverhøj Museum of History & Art is located at 1624 Elverhoy Way in Solvang. Hours are Thursday through Monday from 11:00 a.m. -5:00 p.m. There Is no charge for admission, but a $5 donation is suggested.
