        "text": "WOW! For spectacular, breathtaking coastal views, this trail is hard to beat!\n\nIt's been a few years, but over a period of thirty years or so, whenever my wife and I visited the Central Coast from SoCal we always made a point of hiking or biking this short but impressive trail.\n\nCalifornia golden poppies, wildflowers, deer, California valley quail, sea otters, rattlesnakes, and a perfectly pleasant hard packed, bike friendly trail make this a can't miss experience!\n\nBTW ~ Since you'll already be in the neighborhood, consider hiking the Point Buchon Trail directly south of Montana de Oro to make a full day of it and for even more incredible, scenic coastal views!\n\n(Last time I checked, Point Buchon Trail is closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays)\n\nThe Bob Jones trail has become dangerous. Electric vehicles now seem to outnumber bikes. Walkers, some elderly, some pushing strollers, some with small children or dogs of all sizes, and regular bicyclists now have to compete for passage with electric vehicles. I have seen: electric bikes, electric scooters, electric skateboards (some with beach chairs mounted on them), a moped, and one speeding electric unicycle whose rider used ski poles for balance. Sometimes the scooters and bikes come in packs of half a dozen, rented by a group, the bikes blaring good-times music. The electric bikes come in various sizes, and at you at various speeds. With my dog on a tight lead, I have been yelled at to get out of the way. With pleasure. Soon someone is going to get hurt seriously and the city will be sued.\n\nJan 2022: We parked at the Hagerman Sports Complex and rode both directions from there. Trail surface is paved smooth and wide enough. Heading south trail signage indicates end of trail but trail picks up again after crossing Skyway Dr. Okay ride to end. There is a stop with three information panels about military and aviation history of the area.\n\nJan 2022: Parked at the Broadway (exit 173) access. Tight entrance gate to get bike through. The levee is very wide with a gravel surface. We only rode from our access point to the West end of the trail where the levee is fenced and signs indicate end of access. Returned to our access point and called it quits. Saw no reason to go further. Nothing special about this trail, flat and wide."
