        "text": "Lived here 88-01 when my dad was stationed at the base. The climate is chaparral or near- desert and the weather is on the cooler side year round as you are by the ocean. Lompoc is a pretty small, quiet town on the Central Coast but more towards the south of California overall. It has the usual small town amenities and local events you would expect.If you are looking for more, L.A. is only 2.5 hours away, Santa Barbara is about and hour as is San Luis Obispo and Pismo Beach, only in different directions. National parks are less than a days drive away. Surf Beach is closed during the warmer months of the year due to an endangered species so for a good portion of the year Jalama is probably the closest beach (but worth the drive). Overall, when I lived there it was a decent, quiet town to grow up in although I could see leaving if you wanted to see the world. The only downside I can think of would be the outrageous real estate prices for a small, out of the way town."
