        "text": "Address\n\n2295 Purisima Road\n\nLompoc, CA 93436\n\nUnited States\n\nGet Directions\n\nSpecial Designation for La Purísima Mission\n\nThis mission is run by an organization known as Prelado. Prelado's support provides La Purísima Mission State Historic Park with animal care, money for enrichment programs, docent training, building repairs and many other aspects of operating this historic park.\n\nThe Prelado de los Tesoros (keepers of the treasures of La Purísima) is one of the largest and most robust group of trained volunteers in California. Docent candidates undergo eight (8) weeks of training and must accumulate 96 hours of volunteer work before they officially become docents.\n\nTelephone and website information are provided below.\n\nWebsite(s)\n\nhttps://www.lapurisimamission.org - Prelado de los Tesoros de La Purísima (Prelado)\n\nhttps://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=598 - La Purisima Mission State Historic Park (part of the CA Department of Parks and Recreation)\n\nPhone(s)\n\n805-733-3713 - Park\n\n805-736-3605 - Gift Shop\n\nFees, Hours and Tours\n\nPlease contact Prelado de los Tesoros de La Purísima directly by telephone or by visiting their website for the most current information regarding fees, hours of operation and tours.\n\nDue to Covid-19 restrictions, it is best to check for current information.\n\nWeddings and Other Special Services\n\nLa Purísima Mission State Historic Park offers a bucolic and relaxed setting for weddings and events, surrounded by historic buildings and tucked within a small canyon, La Cañada de los Berros. Visit the CA Department of Parks and Recreation website for more information regarding the options available.\n\nSpecial Events\n\nThe park stages \"special\" days throughout the year. Check the most current calendar for a list of scheduled events.\n\nUnique Attractions\n\nLa Purísima is a \"living history\" museum. Time your visit on a day when there are special activities or an encampment scheduled.\n\nThere are always docents in period costumes that create a realistic feel for life in the mission era.\n\nThe mission complex has been extensively restored and even includes an active blacksmith shop at the far end of the property.\n\nLa Purísima is the only California mission with live animals (carefully selected to reflect the animals of the mission era).\n\nMost of the missions were laid out in quadrangle format (including La Purísima at its first site).\n\nWhen the mission was rebuilt at a new and safer spot between 1813-1815, it was laid out in a linear fashion.\n\nOther Historic Attractions\n\nMake time to enjoy the town of Lompoc and its incredible collection of thirty-six (36) large murals. Download a copy of the Murals of Lompoc before visiting."
