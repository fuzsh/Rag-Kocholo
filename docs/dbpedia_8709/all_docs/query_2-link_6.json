        "text": "Bruce Cabot (born Étienne de Pelissier Bujac, Jr., April 20, 1904 – May 3, 1972) was an American film actor, best remembered as Jack Driscoll in King Kong (1933) and for his roles in films such as The Last of the Mohicans (1936), Fritz Lang's Fury (1936), and the Western Dodge City (1939). He was also known as one of \"Wayne's Regulars\", appearing in a number of John Wayne films beginning with Angel and the Badman (1947), and concluding with Big Jake (1971).\n\nEarly life Cabot was born in Carlsbad, New Mexico, to a prominent local lawyer, Major Étienne de Pelissier Bujac, Sr. and Julia Armandine Graves, who died shortly after giving birth to her son. Étienne, Sr., was the son of John James Bujac, a lawyer and mining expert in Baltimore, Maryland. Étienne, Sr., graduated from Cumberland School of Law near Nashville, Tennessee, and served in the United States Army during the Spanish–American War and the Philippine–American War before settling in Carlsbad.[1][2]\n\nCabot graduated from Sewanee Military Academy in 1921, and briefly attended the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, but left without graduating.[3] He worked at many jobs, including as a sailor, an insurance salesman, oil worker, surveyor, and prize fighter; he also sold cars, managed real estate, and worked at a slaughterhouse. A meeting with David O. Selznick at a Hollywood party led to his acting career.[4]\n\nActing career Early roles Cabot appeared in nearly 100 feature films. He made his debut in an uncredited bit part in an episode of the serial Heroes of the Flames (1931). In Ann Vickers (1933), he portrays a soldier who seduces a naive woman (Irene Dunne), and gets her pregnant before he leaves for the war.[5] He then appeared in King Kong (also 1933), which became an enormous success and established Cabot as a star.[4]\n\nHe also portrays villains in several productions, appearing as a gangster boss in Let 'Em Have It (1935) and as the Huron warrior Magua opposite Randolph Scott in The Last of the Mohicans (1936). He co-stars with Spencer Tracy in Fritz Lang's first Hollywood film, Fury (1936), playing the leader of a lynch mob. He also appears with Errol Flynn in Michael Curtiz's epic Western Dodge City, which in 1939 was one of Warner Bros.'s biggest hits.\n\nHe tested for the lead role of the Ringo Kid in John Ford's Stagecoach (1939), but John Wayne was cast in the part.[6] A consistent box-office draw, Cabot appeared in many movies at many studios before leaving Hollywood to serve in World War II.[7]\n\nWar service and return to Hollywood Cabot enlisted in December 1942 and, after Officer Training School in Miami Beach, was commissioned a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army Air Force.\n\nCabot headed back to Hollywood and fell in with John Wayne on the set of Angel and the Badman (1947), and became part of Wayne's circle, this relationship paying off in the 1960s, when Wayne cast him in 10 more of his films: The Comancheros (1961), Hatari! (1962), McLintock! (1963), In Harm's Way (1965), The War Wagon (1967), The Green Berets (1968), Hellfighters (1968), The Undefeated (1969), Chisum (1970), and Big Jake (1971).[4][8]\n\nCabot's final screen appearance is in the James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever (1971).\n\nHe was inducted into the New Mexico Entertainment Hall of Fame in 2012.\n\nTelevision Cabot starred in a number of the Tales of Tomorrow, a science-fiction drama, during its second season (1952–53) on ABC.\n\nHe also appeared on other television series, such as:\n\nBurke's Law - \"Who Killed Holly Howard?\" - Thomas Matherson (1963) Bonanza - \"A Dime's Worth of Glory\" - Sheriff Reed Larrimore (1964) Daniel Boone - \"The Devil's Four\" - Simon Bullard (1965) Personal life Cabot was married three times, in Florida to Mary Mather Smith, whom he divorced prior to moving to Hollywood, and to actresses Adrienne Ames and Francesca De Scaffa (1930-1994).[citation needed]\n\nHe was one of Errol Flynn's social pack for several years, but they fell out during the production of the unfinished The Story of William Tell. Flynn was producing the film and asked Cabot, whom he described as \"an old, old pal,\" to appear in it, knowing that Cabot was having difficulty finding work in Hollywood at that time. When Flynn's production partners went broke, though, production on the film halted, leaving Flynn stranded in Rome facing financial ruin. Cabot, in an attempt to get paid when other cast members were working for no money, had Flynn's and his wife Patrice Wymore's personal cars and clothing in their Rome hotel seized. Flynn wrote angrily in his autobiography of what he termed Cabot's \"betrayal\".[9] Eleven years after Flynn's death, in a 1970 interview, Cabot paid tribute to him as a critically underrated actor, but said that Flynn had destroyed himself through narcotic addiction.[citation needed] David Niven, also part of Flynn's social pack, in his autobiography accused Cabot of being missing when debts were to be paid.[citation needed]\n\nDeath Cabot died May 3, 1972, at age 68 in the Motion Picture Country Home at Woodland Hills, California due to lung cancer.[7] He was buried in his hometown of Carlsbad, New Mexico.\n\nHeroes of the Flames (1931, Serial) as Bit Part [ch.7] (film debut, uncredited)\n\nConfessions of a Co-Ed (1931) as Student at Dance (uncredited)\n\nLady with a Past (1932) as Party Guest (uncredited)\n\nThe Roadhouse Murder (1932) as Fred Dykes\n\nThe Lost Special (1932, Serial) as Forest Ranger (uncredited)\n\nLucky Devils (1933) as Happy White\n\nThe Great Jasper (1933) as Roger McGowd (adult)\n\nKing Kong (1933) as Jack Driscoll\n\nScarlet River (1933) as Himself (uncredited)\n\nDisgraced!

He was also known as one of \"Wayne's Regulars\", appearing in a number of John Wayne films beginning with Angel and the Badman.\n\nEarly life\n\nCabot was born Etienne Pelissier Jacques de Bujac in Carlsbad, New Mexico, to a prominent local lawyer, Colonel Etienne de Bujac, and Julia Armandine Graves, who died shortly after giving birth to him. Leaving the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee without graduating, Cabot worked at many jobs, including as a sailor, an insurance salesman, oil worker, surveyor, prize fighter, sold cars, handled real estate and also worked a slaughterhouse. A meeting with David O. Selznick at a Hollywood Party started his acting career.\n\nActing career\n\nCabot appeared in nearly one hundred feature films. He made his debut in 1931 in Heroes of the Flames. He tested for the lead role of The Ringo Kid in John Ford's western Stagecoach (1939), but John Wayne got the part.\n\nHe played a soldier who seduced a naive woman (portrayed by Irene Dunne) and got her pregnant as he left for the war, in the 1933 production Ann Vickers. He then starred in the 1933 blockbuster King Kong, which became an enormous success and established Cabot as a star. Cabot also played villains, appearing as a gangster boss in Let 'Em Have It (1936) and as the Huron warrior Magua opposite Randolph Scott in The Last of the Mohicans (1936). He starred with Spencer Tracy, playing the leader of a lynch mob in Fritz Lang's first Hollywood film, Fury (1936), and with Errol Flynn in Michael Curtiz's epic Western Dodge City, which became one of Warner Bros.'s biggest hits. A consistent box office draw, Cabot appeared in many movies at many studios before leaving Hollywood to serve in World War II.\n\nWorld War II\n\nCabot enlisted in December 1942 and, after Officer Training School in Miami Beach, became a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army Air Forces. He was an Air Transport Command operations officer at el Aouina, Tunis from July to November 1943.[citation needed] It is alleged (by L. Fletcher Prouty) that Cabot was involved in a gold smuggling ring that shipped Nazi gold to Brazil after the war's end. However, Counter Intelligence Corps documents show that Cabot was a courier for a smuggling ring run by high-ranking Air Transport Command officers to arbitrage Middle Eastern gold prices. Cabot, known to the Air Force as Lt. DeBujac, was apprehended in Cairo in November 1943 and after an investigation posted to the remote desert outpost of Atar in Mauritania, where he did odd jobs. He was separated from the service on 19 July 1944.\n\nReturn to Hollywood\n\nCabot headed back to Hollywood and fell in with John Wayne (whose career was then in the ascendant, and who would become a major force in American film-making over the next two decades) on the set of Angel and the Badman (1947) and became part of Wayne's circle, this relationship paying off in the 1960s when Wayne cast him in ten of his films: The Comancheros (1961), Hatari! (1962), McLintock! (1963), In Harm's Way (1965), The War Wagon (1967), The Green Berets (1968), Hellfighters (1968), The Undefeated (1969), Chisum (1970), and Big Jake (1971).\n\nCabot's final screen appearance was in the 1971 James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever.\n\nHe was inducted into the New Mexico Entertainment Hall of Fame in 2012.\n\nPersonal life\n\nCabot was married three times, to actresses Mary Mather Smith, Adrienne Ames and Francesca De Scaffa. It is possible that Mary Mather Smith was the black actress who starred in such all black cast films as The Girl from Chicago, but information about their marriage is difficult to find.\n\nHe was one of Errol Flynn's social pack for several years but they fell out during the production of the unfinished The Story of William Tell. Flynn was producing the film and asked Cabot, whom he described as \"an old, old pal,\" to perform in it, knowing that Cabot was finding it hard to get work in Hollywood at that time. However, when Flynn's production partners defaulted, the production halted, leaving Flynn stranded in Rome facing financial ruin.

Flynn wrote angrily in his autobiography of what he termed Cabot's \"betrayal.\" Eleven years after Flynn's death, in an interview in England in 1970, Cabot paid tribute to him as a critically underestimated actor, but said that Flynn had destroyed himself through narcotic addiction.\n\nDeath\n\nCabot died in 1972 at the Motion Picture Country Home at Woodland Hills, California from lung cancer and was buried in his hometown, Carlsbad, New Mexico.\n\nPartial filmography"
