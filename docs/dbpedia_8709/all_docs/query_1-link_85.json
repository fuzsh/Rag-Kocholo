        "text": "BRUCE CABOT\n\nIndex card signed by actor Bruce Cabot in blue ink. With small b/w printed photo of him in a cowboy hat and short bio affixed\n\nInscribed card signed \"For Jim/Bruce Cabot\" in blue ink. Blue ink notations on verso in unknown hand. 5x3 card. With 1x1 b/w printed photo of Cabot affixed in top right corner and 2Â¼x1 bio affixed on verso. Typed notations in full: \"BRUCE CABOT (1904-1972)/Tough leading man of the 1930's, the hero of/'King Kong' in 1933. Appeared in numerous/second feature westerns and on TV.\" According to the notations on verso, Cabot signed this card on Sept. 5, 1952. American actor Cabot (1904-1972), born Etienne Pelissier Jacques de Bujac, is probably best known to modern audiences as Jack Driscoll from King Kong (1933). This heroic role was against type for him, though, as Cabot was usually cast as a heavy (such as a gangster in Let 'Em Have It, Magua in Last of the Mohicans and a thuggish lynch-mob leader in Fury, all in 1936). Cabot was also a good friend of John Wayne and appeared with him in Angel and the Badman (1947) as well as many of his later exploits, like The Comancheros (1961), Hellfighters (1962), McLintock! (1963), In Harm's Way (1965), The Green Berets (1968), Chisum (1970) and Big Jake (1971). In all, Cabot appeared in almost 110 films and TV shows between 1931 and 1971. Lightly toned and creased. Discoloration from bio, which touches signature. Rounded and worn corners. Otherwise in fine condition.\n\nThis website image may contain our company watermark.
