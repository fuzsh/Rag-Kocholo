        "text": "Cabot: What does the surname Cabot mean?\n\nCabot is a surname of Norman origin, derived from the personal name \"Cobbo\" or \"Cobba.\" The surname may also have occupational roots, referring to individuals who breed or keep cows. In Old French, \"boeuf\" means \"ox.\" Over time, the name 'Cabot' has come to be associated with adventure and exploration, mainly due to John Cabot, an Italian navigator and explorer known for his 1497 voyage to North America, where he claimed land in Canada for England. This connection provides the surname with an air of courage and discovery. In different regions and languages, the name’s spelling and pronunciation have varied, causing the creation of different versions of the name; including Cabbott, Cabott, and Cabbot, among others. Therefore, while having roots in Norman and Old French traditions, the name has been widely spread and adopted cross-culturally.\n\nOrder DNA origin analysis\n\nCabot: Where does the name Cabot come from?\n\nThe surname Cabot is of French origin and is believed to have been derived from the word \"caboche\", meaning \"head\", referring to a stubborn or headstrong person. This name is often associated with the famous explorer John Cabot who was of Italian origin but sailed under the English flag.\n\nIn regard to its distribution, Cabot is found most frequently in the United States today. According to Forebears, a genealogical site compiling global surname information, there were approximately 3,676 individuals with the Cabot surname in the United States in 2014, which made it the country with the highest number of people bearing this last name. The surname is also found, though less commonly, in France, Canada, Spain, and England.\n\nMany of the Cabots in the United States are believed to be descendants of John Cabot, the famous Venetian explorer. The Cabot family is historically significant in New England, particularly in Massachusetts, where they have been prominent figures in business, politics, and philanthropy since the 18th century.\n\nVariations of the surname Cabot\n\nThe surname Cabot primarily originated from France and Spain. Variations include Cabott, Cabotte, Cabbot, Kabot, Cabo, Cabbo, Kabbott, and Caboote. It also appeared in England after the Norman conquest, with elements of it seen in surnames like Cabbott or Cabbert.\n\nThe surname Cabot may have also evolved into other similar names due to regional dialects and pronunciation. In Italy, for instance, it may be known as Cabotto. In Spain, potential variations include Caboté or Caboto.\n\nIn the past, the spelling of names was often not standardized, and names might be spelled differently even within the same document. As a result, a single person could be recorded under several spelling variations. Some of the different spellings of Cabot include the French Cabotte, Cabot, and Cabott, the Spanish Cabot, Caboto, and Cabote, the Italian Cabotto, and others.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the numerous variations of the same names was migration. As families moved from one region to another, they might change the spelling of their surnames to better fit in with the local language and culture. So, it is also possible that there are other variations of the Cabot surname that exist, which are not recorded here.\n\nFamous people with the name Cabot\n\nMeg Cabot: An American author known best for her \"Princess Diaries\" series, which was adapted into successful Disney movies.\n\nSusan Cabot: A 1950s American film and television actress who starred in numerous films like \"War of the Satellites\" and \"The Wasp Woman\".\n\nSebastian Cabot: A British actor known for his role as the butler in the American sitcom \"Family Affair\".
