Bruce Cabot – John Wayne’s toadie

Bruce Cabot

Bruce Cabot is well known to you whether you know it or not. Moving from a leading man to a sidekick role Cabot became a regular feature in most John Wayne movies such as The Comancheros (1961), Hatari! (1962), McLintock! (1963), In Harm’s Way (1965), The War Wagon (1967), The Green Berets (1968), Hellfighters (1969), The Undefeated (1969), Chisum (1970), and Big Jake (1971), a movie that has more quotable lines than a showing of Game of Thrones. Cabot became Wayne’s on-screen and off-screen drink buddy.

Bruce Cabot was the leading man and hero in King Kong (1933) but somehow he never made the transition to leading man. Cabot auditioned for the role of The Ringo Kid in Stagecoach (1939). John Wayne was eventually cast in the John Ford western and became one of the most important actors in Hollywood. Cabot was reduced to supporting roles from then on out. This clearly illustrated the main point of On Any Given Sunday when Al Pacino gives the life is a game of inches speech. When the duke and Bruce Cabot were cast in Angel and the Badman (1937) they became drinking buddies and continued this both on and off-screen. Cabot was in at least 10 movies with John Wayne. Cabot could rely on Wayne for a supporting part in one of the Duke’s movies.

Cabot joined the Army Air Corp and worked in intelligence during World War II. At least a part of his job involved smuggling gold from the Middle East.

Cabot was cast as the heel in many movies during the 1930s. He played a mobster in Let ’em Have It (1935) and the revengeful Magua in The Last of the Mohicans (1936). This was not the only time he played a Native American. He was cast as Indian tracker Sam Sharpnose in Big Jake (1971) and delivered great lines like “I don’t hunt Indians.”

Cabot was born in New Mexico in 1904 and died at the age of 68 from lung cancer.
