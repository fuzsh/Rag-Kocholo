        "text": "We're very excited to introduce Jester King Bitter Death -- Extra Hoppy Belgian-Style Pale Ale!\n\nOur motivations in presenting this beer are straightforward and selfish. For over a decade, we've had a great affinity for well-attenuated, crisp, hoppy, herbal ales with subtle but interesting pure culture fermentation character. With our pure culture fermentation program having taken flight in 2020, we were inspired to make a beer in this fashion.\n\nBitter Death was brewed with Texas malted barley and wheat from TexMalt and a touch of flaked oats. It was hopped aggressively at nearly 3 pounds per barrel with Perle, Hallertauer Mittelfr√ºh, and Tettnanger. We probably were more aggressive with the hopping than tradition would dictate, but dry, herbal, and bitter was our M.O. here. Fermented down to 1.2 Plato (1.002) with Antwerp Ale Yeast. 43 IBU. 4.5 pH. 5.4% abv. 100% naturally conditioned.\n\nWe get notes of white tea, dried hydrangea petals, bread dough, Texas toast, Euro-skunk, cannabis, dehydrated lime citrus wheels, caraway, and walking through the Hill Country on a spring day after it rains.\n\nAvailable now! Order at www.jesterkingbrewery.com or visit our brewery, kitchen, farm, inn, and event hall in the beautiful Texas Hill Country on the outskirts of Ausitn. Available by the glass and in 750ml bottles ($14). 4,000 bottles available. No bottle limit. Limited disto. Proxies welcome. Shipping & delivery illegal for TX craft brewers.\n\nArt by Joshua Cockrell. Photos by Jessica Attie."
