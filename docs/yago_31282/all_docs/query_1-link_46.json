        "text": "Sam Hunt on stage\n\nFive-time Grammy-nominated, chart-topping country artist Sam Hunt brings his “Outskirts Tour 2024” to Rosemont this weekend, joined by special guests Brett Young and Lily Rose. 7:30 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 24, at the Allstate Arena, 6920 Mannheim Road, Rosemont. $40.75-$200. rosemont.com.\n\nDan Tedesco returns\n\nFormer St. Charles folk-rocker Dan Tedesco heads back to Illinois from his current home in Iowa for a stop at one of his favorite venues this weekend. Catch his folk-rock show packed with old favorites — and probably a new tune or two. 7:30 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 24, at Hey Nonny, 10 S. Vail Ave., Arlington Heights. $15-$35. heynonny.com.\n\nToby Keith tribute\n\nThe Made in America Band tackles the music of late country artist Toby Keith, who died of stomach cancer in February, in a tribute worthy of a red solo cup toast. Through multimedia visuals and live music, fans can enjoy memories of Keith’s 30-year career. 8 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 24, at the Des Plaines Theatre, 1476 Miner St., Des Plaines. $25-$35. desplainestheatre.com.\n\nBitter Jester ramps up\n\nThe Bitter Jester Music Festival is back for its 18th season highlighting young musicians from throughout the region. In addition to Battle of the Band-style performance opportunities — this year set for two weekends in June in Highland Park and a number of satellite concerts — young artists also get feedback from industry pros and the chance to win some very useful prizes. Early applications are due by March 15; but the application deadline window officially closes April 22. See bitterjesterfoundation.org for details.\n\n• Brian Shamie is the Design Editor at the Daily Herald."
