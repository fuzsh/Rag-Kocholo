        "text": "Hoid\n\nby Ari Ibarra\n\nAbilities Yolish Lightweaving, Mistborn, Awakener, Lightweaver (Surgebinder), Elantrian, Worldhopper, Dawnshard (formerly), others Bonded With Design,[1] unnamed seon[2] Aliases Wit, Cephandrius, others Groups Worldsingers, Worldbringers[3] Homeworld Yolen Universe Cosmere Introduced In Elantris\n\nWhat did I tell you about spoiling the ending of stories!\n\nHoid has made his presence known all across the cosmere, and so this page contains extensive spoilers.\n\nThis page or section deals with theories or speculation.\n\nPlease read carefully and note that this is not necessarily canonical.\n\n“And while I am your friend, please understand that our goals do not completely align. You must not trust yourself with me. If I have to watch this world crumble and burn to get what I need, I will do so. With tears, yes, but I would let it happen. ”\n\n—Hoid to Dalinar[4]\n\nHoid is a worldhopper and Dawnshard[5] that travels the cosmere, originally born on the planet Yolen before the Shattering.[6] He was one of the major figures in the Shattering of Adonalsium, but avoided taking up a Shard himself,[7] instead choosing to wander the cosmere pursing his unknown goals, often in the guise of a fool[8] or storyteller.[9] He may be guided at times by a mysterious sense about where he should go, but not what he is to accomplish there.[10] One of his major goals is the defeat of Rayse, the original Vessel of the Shard Odium.[11] While Hoid has generally avoided direct involvement in the major events of the cosmere, he is oftentimes present in the periphery, influencing in large ways and small the people who will go on to alter the course of history, as well as occasionally taking on an apprentice to train at his side.[12] Hoid has been present for events such as the restoration of the city of Elantris on Sel,[13] the Catacendre of Scadrial,[14] and the True Desolation of Roshar.[15] Along the way he has gained access to a prodigious number of powerful Invested Arts and arcana, including Surgebinding,[16] AonDor,[17] Awakening,[18] and Allomancy,[19] among others.\n\nAppearance & Personality[edit]\n\nFor more images, see /Gallery.\n\nAppearance[edit]\n\nHoid's appearance varies dramatically from book to book. He's often in disguise, which makes his true appearance difficult to ascertain. Couple this with the fact that he can Lightweave his appearance in order to look however he wants, it makes it nearly impossible to know for sure what he looks like. To the best of our knowledge, his face is lined,[20] hawk-like and arrow shaped. Hoid is tall and thin[8] and also has a sharp nose and jaw with delicate eyebrows.[20] He tends to cock his head to one side[21] and has keen blue eyes.[8] Hoid's hair is white, though he was not born with that color[22] and he occasionally dyes it.[23] There is a particular reason for his hair being white.[24]\n\nWhen he is on Roshar during the War of Reckoning and True Desolation, serving as King Elhokar Kholin's, and later Queen Jasnah Kholin's Wit, Hoid has the appearance of an Alethi man in his mid-30s[25] with deep onyx hair. He wears a stiff black coat and carries a long thin sword at his waist.[8] This blade is not magically Invested but has personal value to Hoid.[26] It is a symbol of office for the King/Queen's Wit, though Hoid himself is not a skilled swordfighter.[27]\n\nPersonality[edit]\n\nHoid's true personality, while also usually disguised, is more easily seen as he occasionally drops whatever part he is playing. One of his overall most noticeable traits is his sharp wit and intelligence. The characters he plays often have a penchant for jokes and mockery but when he removes the facade his personality often seems mysterious and grave.[28][21] Hoid would not consider himself a good man.[29] Hoid is not always serious when he should be, due to how much normal human interaction bores him.[30]\n\nHoid cannot directly physically harm people; this is an involuntary trait that is the result of changes to his spirit made during his time as a Dawnshard.[31][32] Lunamor says he cannot hurt man because it is forbidden by other gods.[33] He also tells a young Shallan Davar, \"You needn't fear me. I'm terribly ineffective at hurting people. I blame my upbringing.\"[34] Hoid apologizes to Kelsier after beating him in a fight, stating he doesn't have the inclination to do real harm to him.[35] This aversion causes him to be nauseated when thinking about physically harming someone, and is sometimes bad enough to incapacitate him. However, this only extends to physical trauma- Hoid has no issues with mentally hurting someone or through inaction.[36] Hoid also has issues with harming himself physically, such as when he has to manipulate another man into punching him when he wants a tooth knocked out, rather than just doing it himself.[16][37] If he had the capacity to, he would be willing to kill to achieve his goals, he would also let even those he cares about perish if it meant the furtherance of his goals.[4][38]\n\nHoid is a very kind person to those he takes a liking to, doing his best to emotionally console them and give them the will to keep going. This can be seen in the various times he has told Kaladin stories in order to comfort him and teach him a lesson that he believes he needs to learn.[21][39] He has done the same to Shallan, most notably when he met her as a child traumatized by her experiences and the abuses she went through during the Middlefest Fair. Here, he consoles her and gave her motivation to keep moving forward.[34] He did the same later, when speaking with her in Kholinar.[40] He occasionally uses Allomancy to help Soothe people.[34][41]\n\nWhile he is very comforting to those he likes, and can sometimes be open about some parts of his past; he does make sure that they never come to trust him too much, and that they understand what kind of person he is, and that they understand the dangers involved with getting to close to or trusting him.[4][42]\n\nOn the other end, he finds great joy in tormenting those he hates, such as Ruthar, Rayse, or Kelsier.[43][1][44][35] This is likely a large part in his enjoyment of playing the role of court jesters like the King's Wit or the Imperial Fool. This behavior of his tends to rub many people the wrong way, making him despised by many people he interacts with.[35][15] He sometimes bickers even with those he likes, such as Design, though this takes the form of an exasperated fondness rather than bitter mockery.[1][45]\n\nHe deeply enjoys storytelling, and has learned many stories over his long life. The stories he tells often have a personal or thematic relevance to those he is telling them to.[9][21][40][39] Though sometimes, he simply tells stories for the sake of telling them, as he feels that as stories exist, they must be told.[9][45][46] As a storyteller, he deeply hates when people spoil his stories.[16] He also enjoys pontificating on the nature of art and storytelling to whoever would listen.[28][15][16][1][47][45] He also enjoys asking people questions of philosophy and ideology, and would do so even with complete strangers. He uses these questions in order to use the answers of others as a jumping off point to share his own philosophy on the subject in question.[28]\n\nHe also finds joy in is getting away with things.[48]\n\nAs a child, he often stared at the stars and wondered about what they were and what it would be like to visit them.[6]\n\nFor unknown reasons, he was willing to turn down the immense power of a Shard when it was offered to him.[49][50]\n\nHe has a very negative outlook on himself, often believing that he has no answers for others or even any answers at all,[21] believes that he should never be trusted due to what he is willing to do to achieve his goals,[4][42] he thinks himself arrogant and regrets many of his actions and inactions throughout his life,[51][21] and he does not consider himself a good man.[29] He even considers a Dawnshard itself to have become completely worthless in his wearing of it.[21]\n\nHis ultimate goal is to \"make that which once was,\" though the exact details are currently unknown.[52]\n\nPhilosophy[edit]\n\nHe believes that the main thing that people value in creation is not the creation itself, but the novelty, timeliness, and originality of it. Observing that if two people make the same discovery independently, the one who reveals their discovery first is the one given credit and lauded for their innovation, while the second is considered a forger. That if two artists create similar works of comparable pulchritude independent of each other, one would be lauded and the other would be bemoaned as derivative. He claims that if it was truly a matter of the aesthetic beauty of a work, it would not matter which came first. From this, he claims that the idea that what is valued most is creative ability, wisdom, and invention to be nothing more than a lie that humanity tells itself. He admits that it is a rather cynical viewpoint, but holds to it regardless.[28]\n\nHe feels that art and aesthetic beauty is not some eternal idea outside of humanity, but rather that it inherently relies upon and is defined by humanity. That art produced with low audience expectations can gain much love and loyal following from those given more then they expect; but conversely, an artist held in very high esteem can have their works torn apart and considered a failure for falling even slightly short from expectations. Aesthetic beauty is given definition through audience expectation and interpretation, it relies deeply upon audience participation, and therefore is not eternal and independent. He claims that this aspect of art makes it fundamentally unfair. He furthers this idea to say that the concept of expectation defining value extends to all parts of life, such as in financial gains.[15]\n\nHe believes that all great art is necessarily hated by some due to the variety in human tastes. To make it so nobody would hate a work of art, one must remove everything that makes it special, therefore making it so that it is loved by nobody. Being hated is not proof that art is great, but not being hated is proof that it is not.[16] He believes that art is about emotion, examination and going places people have never gone before to discover and investigate new things; it is from this definition of art, and his recognition of the subjective nature of aesthetic taste, that he argues that all great art is necessarily hated by somebody.[16] When questioning himself on how many people need to love a work of art to outweigh the hate it inevitably inspires, and balance out the risk. Thus, if even one person loves a work, no matter how many people hate it, it is worthwhile.[16]\n\nHe believes that stories don't live until they are imagined in someone's mind, and that everyone's experience of the story is individual and unique. He believes that the meaning of a story is up to the audience themselves to decide; that it is not meant to tell them how to think, but instead to give them questions to think upon.[21] He thinks that the interpretations people have of stories are based upon what they themselves are looking for, as are the answers they find in them.[21] His belief in how stories take on life in the minds of an audience is likely a reason for his feeling of obligation to tell the stories that he learns to whoever will listen.[9]\n\nAttributes and Abilities[edit]\n\nThis page or section deals with theories or speculation.\n\nPlease read carefully and note that this is not necessarily canonical.\n\nHoid does not yet have the abilities of every planet he's visited.[53] Some of his powers predate the Shattering, but none of them are gained through Hemalurgy.[54] Hoid is concerned about opening himself up to the influence of Shards, so he only gains access to manifestations of Investiture through more conventional, but more difficult ways.[55] Hoid has access to multiple Invested Arts, but not an incredibly large number.[56] He is likely the most powerful non-Shard entity in the cosmere,[57] although a few of the older dragons and aethers might rival him.[58]\n\nAfter Odium stole some of his memories, Hoid instituted protection protocols to defend himself if something or someone tried to interact with his soul.[59] This causes his body to be frozen in time, while his mind remains unaffected.[60] In this state, he is still able to make Connections with others, and may even see and hear from those he is Connected with.[61] The physical stasis was not what Hoid intended to happen and it will last until the person stops trying to interact with his soul.[59]\n\nThere are only a few things in the cosmere that are capable of hurting him, one of which is likely Nightblood, and he stays far away from all of them.[62] Hoid also has an unknown seon.[2][44]\n\nIllusions[edit]\n\n“I see. You do not yet understand the nature of lies. I had that trouble myself, long ago. The Shards here are very strict. You will have to see the truth, child, before you can expand upon it. Just as a man should know the law before he breaks it. ”\n\n—Hoid on Lightweaving to Shallan[34]\n\nHoid has access to an Invested Art known as Lightweaving that originates from Yolen prior to the Shattering of Adonalsium.[63] Lightweaving allows for the creation of optical and auditory illusions.[64] This Lightweaving is much less restrictive than the later Rosharan variant,[34] and does not require a spren or Stormlight to function.[63] Hoid sometimes makes use of this ability in his disguises[65] although he has several ways of changing how he looks[66] including practical effects.[67] He may also make use of it in some of his storytelling,[68] such as the pictures of Derethil and the Wandersail that Kaladin sees in the smoke when Hoid is telling him a story.[21]\n\nHoid's Yolish Lightweaving does not always seem to function perfectly on Roshar;[69] in fact, he needs help from Shallan to fully craft an illusion.[40] His power is somehow limited, and he has trouble making some aspects of it work, even after multiple attempts.[69] It is uncertain why this occurs and whether or not this issue is unique to Roshar. Hoid's bonding of a Cryptic will provide abilities that supplement his own Lightweaving[70] and allows him to overcome his issues crafting illusions, although further impacts or resonances between the two are unknown.[71][39] Hoid's access to Yolish Lightweaving does allow him to guide another Lightweaver's power, although this is not something he would be able to do with just any Invested Art.[69]\n\nWorldhopping[edit]\n\nHoid travels between various planets within the cosmere by making use of perpendicularities,[72] places usually created by the presence of a Shard on a planet where the sheer power of Investiture causes the borders between the realms to be weakened.[73] A knowledgeable person such as Hoid is able to transition from the Physical Realm to the Cognitive Realm.[72] Hoid can then travel to a different world's subastral, as the distances between worlds in the Cognitive Realm are much smaller than in the Physical Realm.[74] Hoid is very proficient at traveling in the Cognitive Realm.[75] He can easily travel to any world that has an active perpendicularity, even those worlds where the perpendicularities are dangerous to pass through such as the Well of Ascension.[35] Hoid is known to be aware of perpendicularities on Scadrial,[35] Sel,[76] and Roshar,[33] and likely knows of Nalthis's perpendicularity as well.[9][77] While Hoid typically makes use of natural perpendicularities in his travels, later in life he may also have access to an ability that essentially allows him to generate his own personal perpendicularity, much like the Surge of Transportation.[78] Following the invention of space travel, he also makes use of spaceships to travel between planets.[59]\n\nDawnshard[edit]\n\n“Other men . . . other men, as they age, merely grow stranger. I fear that I am one of those. I am the bones of a foreign species left drying on the plain that was once, long ago, a sea. A curiosity, perhaps a reminder, that all has not always been as it is now. ”\n\n—Hoid on his age[42]\n\nHoid held the Dawnshard with an intent diametrically opposed to the concepts of harm and violence for a long period of time.[5][32] His time holding it caused changes to his spiritweb in a similar manner to savantism. These changes meant that long-term, Hoid found himself unable to inflict harm on himself or any others,[16][34] as well as unable to eat meat he believes was naturally produced (i.e., he could eat meat he believes was made in a lab or by magic).[79] His Dawnshard is in some way connected to the First Gem,[80] his eponymous topaz. There were other side effects of the Dawnshard. Hoid held it for so long that not only is he ageless,[81][82][32] it has become essentially impossible for him to die.[12] While other people who have held this Dawnshard have gained the ability to Skip and teleport from planet to planet, Hoid has not for most of his life had access to this ability, and it is uncertain if he ever gained it.[83]\n\nTime-Dilation[edit]\n\nIn addition to his agelessness, Hoid has not actually experienced all those years,[84] instead making use of some time-dilation technique that may render him somehow unconscious or unaware.[85] However, Hoid does not have the ability to travel backwards in time.[86]\n\nHealing Factor[edit]\n\n“I'd be surprised if that little knife of yours poses me any real threat, Kholin. ”\n\n—Hoid to Jasnah on her Shardblade[15]\n\nHoid has access to some sort of healing factor that is capable of repairing both the body and the soul.[87] He is able to regenerate any damaged body parts at will, including his head. He can also heal from being stabbed hemalurgically.[88] Hoid is able to repress his healing factor in some way, preventing instantaneous healing, an ability that he makes use of in some of his disguises.[16] This healing factor makes it very difficult to kill Hoid,[89] although he is still at least somewhat vulnerable.[16] The name of the manifestation of Investiture responsible for Hoid's healing is unknown, but it is ancient,[37] likely originating from some Pre-Shattering source. It is uncertain whether or not this healing factor is at all related to Hoid's apparent agelessness, which is known to originate from a remnant of a weapon built to kill Adonalsium.[82] Hoid is unafraid of Shardblades for multiple reasons, probably including his healing factor.[90]\n\nFortune[edit]\n\n“I have discovered a place that I must be, though to be honest I'm not exactly sure why I need to be there. This doesn't always work as well as I'd like it to.”\n\n—Hoid to Dalinar[4]\n\nHoid has access to an ability that allows him to make use of the Spiritual attribute of Fortune,[10] which grants him a limited amount of foresight.[91] Hoid's Fortune ability gives him an innate knowledge of where and when he needs to be.[91] While this ability may grant him knowledge of what he is to do,[10][92] usually Hoid does not know why his ability has brought him to a specific place.[10] Hoid's Fortune ability is not infallible; occasionally it directs him to go somewhere, but either nothing notable is happening or he is unable to discover the reason why he has been led there.[93] Hoid's fortune ability has let him know about instant noodles,[94] although he has had prior experience with them on Taldain.[95]\n\nConnection[edit]\n\nHoid has access to some manifestation of Investiture that allows him to manipulate the Spiritual attribute of Connection. The full extent of this ability is unknown, but its primary known use is to help Hoid speak the various languages of the worlds of the cosmere that he visits. The ability allows him to Connect to whatever land he is in, temporarily altering his Spiritual aspect to believe that he was raised in that place, allowing him to speak as a native.[96] While Hoid has learned naturally how to speak some foreign languages,[97] and is decent with languages, he desires to pass as a local oftentimes, which requires something beyond natural learning.[98] Generally he makes use of his Connection ability to communicate in foreign languages.[97] This ability is not without fault though, as when Hoid speaks naturally it will fill in local idioms and phrases on its own, but if Hoid is careless and focuses on a specific word or phrase the ability may fail and he will say the word verbatim in his own tongue[96] or it may be said in an odd way.[99] Hoid is an expert in using his Connection ability, but even he sometimes makes mistakes. This is the reason he occasionally slips up and may say words that confuse others,[100] such as \"coin\"[15] and \"bunny\"[18] on Roshar. As Hoid has demonstrated the ability to fluently speak foreign languages before the knowledge of unsealed metalminds became widespread,[13] it is unlikely that he is making use of Feruchemical duralumin to manipulate Connection.\n\nVisions[edit]\n\nHoid, via unknown means, is able to enter and exit certain visions, as well as bring those he is bonded with, like Design.[39] While doing so, he creates a large, pure white bubble of light, which can shelter those who have been brought into the vision naturally. While in the vision, Hoid is able to create whatever objects he wants. Hoid is only able to do this for roughly twenty minutes before being detected.\n\nMetallic Arts[edit]\n\nHoid has also gained access to Allomancy,[19] by burning a bead of lerasium stolen from the Well of Ascension.[35][101][102] This grants him power equivalent to that of the ancient Allomancers.[103] It is uncertain how practiced he is with these powers, but he does make use of emotional Allomancy[41] on at least one occasion.[34] He also has access to atium.[104] It is unknown whether or not Hoid has access to Feruchemy.[105] However, he does have access to some unkeyed metalminds,[106] which would not be useful to him without Feruchemical abilities or unsealed metalminds. The particular attributes that are stored in these metalminds are unknown. Hoid does not make use of Hemalurgy, to gain access to the Metallic Arts or any other manifestation of Investiture, as he is concerned about opening himself up to the influence of Shards.[55] He does, however, own many Hemalurgic spikes.[107][108]\n\nAwakening[edit]\n\n“Perfect pitch makes this all so much easier than it once was.... ”\n\n—Hoid to Kaladin on making music[18]\n\nAs a Yolish man, Hoid was not himself born with any BioChromatic Breath.[109] However at some point Hoid has gained access to enough BioChromatic Breath to bring him to at least the Second Heightening.[1][18] This means Hoid has at least two hundred Breaths, which grant him the ability to recognize unsupressed Breath auras and judge about how much breath another Awakener has, as well as perfect pitch.[110][1] That is not to say that Hoid may not have reached a higher Heightening, just that the second Heightening is his minimum power level.[111] Hoid's level of skill with Awakening is still unknown, as he has only made use of it on one known occasion, when he Awakened a doll, causing it to walk.[16] This makes it difficult to ascertain his knowledge of Commands or complex Awakenings. Hoid's level of control over Investiture does allow him to suppress his Breath aura, making it difficult to be noticed by others. However, there are various methods of detecting Investiture that could circumvent this suppression.[112] Hoid's perfect pitch does aid him in tuning instruments and making music.[18] Additionally, holding Breath has allowed Hoid to outsource centuries of his memories to said Breath.[113] After Odium's destruction of some of these Breaths in order to wipe his short-term memory, his level of Breath was reduced to just under the Second Heightening, resulting in a loss of perfect pitch.[1]\n\nSurgebinder[edit]\n\n“It's either go with me now or wait it out and get captured. I honestly don't even know if you've the mind to listen. But if you do, know this: I will give you truths. And I know some juicy ones. ”\n\n—Hoid to his Cryptic, Design[16]\n\nHoid has bonded the Cryptic Design, which grants him access to Surgebinding.[16][1][114] While the enhanced reflexes and healing permitted by Stormlight will likely be less useful to Hoid, the Nahel bond allows him to access the surges of Illumination and Transformation.[16] This allows Hoid to Soulcast, transforming one type of matter to another by persuading its Cognitive aspect as well as Lightweaving, which grants him the ability to create visual and auditory illusions. This Rosharan Lightweaving seems to have a compounding effect with his Yolish Lightweaving, and allows him to circumvent the problems that he has experienced with his own illusions.[39] Although Hoid's Ideals are unknown, he has admitted some truths.[115] This may eventually grant him a Shardblade and Shardplate, and he likely has access to at least a Shardblade from their bond.[116]\n\nOut of all of the orders of the Knights Radiant, Lightweaver was his first choice, as Lightweaving matches him very well and he's quite familiar and experienced with it. Having full access to Lightweaving is a fulfillment of a long, long quest for him.[117]\n\nElantrian[edit]\n\n“It was constructed of Aons. Which I could now draw. The mechanics might bore you. The results, though, were spectacular.”\n\nHoid became an Elantrian through winning a bet he made with Riina, a member of The Ire.[17] Despite his short time with the power, Hoid showed a notable aptitude for the manipulation of Aons, being able to edit a complex AonDor \"curse\" placed on Charlie by Riina, who herself is a highly experienced wielder of AonDor.[17][118] Additionally, Hoid was shown to have spent significant time coveting this specific Invested art.[76][17]\n\nHis knowledge of AonDor is strong enough that he is able to hack the system in order to use it off of Sel.[17][119][120]\n\nStorytelling Method[edit]\n\nHoid tells stories with smoke[21] and sand.[9]\n\nSand[edit]\n\nOn Nalthis, Lightsong calls Hoid to tell the story of Hallandren history to him and Siri. As he told the story, he dropped sands, dusts, and small objects, mixing them together to produce various effects.\n\nHe began by trailing sand out of his hand, then he added a powdery black sand, when both trails mixed it became a white sand. He began to scatter fern leaves and then threw the handful up with blue and deep red dust making it seem like a minor explosion. He sprinkled silver glitter in front of him, then trailed powdery brown dirt. Black dust, and then flower petals. He then sent out a spray of half a dozen colors from both hands. Then bright yellow dust from one hand and black from the other. Torn writing on paper, followed by metal bits, black charcoal dust from both hands, he crumbled clay, sprinkled golden dust around, bits of grass and earth, a white powder and then a spray of water that turned into mist.\n\nSmoke[edit]\n\nWhile telling stories with smoke he uses a flute, blowing the smoke, it may be Yolish Lightweaving that causes patterns and images to appear in smoke.\n\nOn Roshar, the chasms echoed the music allowing him to speak and play, without the music ever seeming to stop. It is unclear how the flute could be used without chasms or canyons.\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nOrigins[edit]\n\n“Other men . . . other men, as they age, merely grow stranger. I fear that I am one of those. I am the bones of a foreign species left drying on the plain that was once, long ago, a sea. A curiosity, perhaps a reminder, that all has not always been as it is now.”\n\n—Hoid on his age[42]\n\nThe individual who would later become known as Hoid was born on Yolen sometime prior to the Shattering of Adonalsium.[6][109][121] He was born naturally and his parents were married.[122][35] From an early age he developed a fascination with the topic of whether life existed on other planets and often listened to local philosophers debate the topic.[6]\n\nDuring this period before the Shattering, Hoid learned Yolish Lightweaving, which sometimes got him into trouble.[63][123] Some of his oldest aliases, one of which likely came from a former master of his,[124] also date back to this period; among these are Hoid, which he says he stole from someone he should have loved,[21] and Cepandrius Maxtori.[125][126]\n\nEventually, Hoid met the dragon Frost, who is his elder by a small amount, though Hoid may have already started aging strangely by that time.[127][128][129] Shortly thereafter, Hoid also met the people who would become the sixteen original Vessels.[127] His early relationships with the future Vessels seem to have been amicable; he went out for drinks with Tanavast at least once,[15] considered Ati to be a kind and generous man,[130] and became friends with Rayse.[131]\n\nAt some point, for a variety of reasons, the future Vessels resolved to kill Adonalsium;[132] Hoid considered doing so to be somewhat necessary and was only loosely involved in their plan,[133][134] though he was present for the actual Shattering.[135] At the Shattering, he was offered one of the newly-created Shards, which he refused;[136] even millennia later, he regards this as having been a wise decision because it allows him a greater degree of freedom.[7]\n\nIn his conversations with the new Vessels, he implied that his rejection of a Shard meant he would not interfere with their affairs,[35] though given his interest in being able to do as he pleased it seems unlikely he actually intended to leave them alone. The Shattering appears to have been a turning point in his relationships with many of the Vessels, as he seems to look down on them for being so eager to Ascend,[7][137] while Edgli at least looks down on him continuing to involve himself in the affairs of the cosmere after refusing a Shard;[49][50] additionally, the Shattering may be the origin of his grudge against Rayse and Bavadin.[138][139]\n\nAt some point early in the history of the cosmere, Hoid held a Dawnshard;[32] this Dawnshard appears to have been associated with a piece of topaz.[140][80] Hoid apparently attempted to do something more with the gemstone for a long time,[124] but ultimately was forced to admit that it had become worthless because he wore it.[21] His association with this gem earned him the name Topaz and the title Bearer of the First Gem.[141][80] Holding a Dawnshard also permanently altered Hoid's spiritweb; among other things, these alterations make him unable to harm others or consume meat,[32] allow him to heal from nearly any injury,[37][62] and are likely the cause of his immortality.[82]\n\nHoid's involvement in important events early in the history of the cosmere has had significant effects on his relationship to Investiture. The fact that he comes from before the Shattering, when magic worked much differently, makes Investiture sometimes act oddly with regard to him;[109] the Shattering also appears to have changed magic such that his Yolish Lightweaving is no longer fully functional.[142] Additionally, his connection to certain events involving the Dawnshards makes some uses of Investiture particularly dangerous for him.[143]\n\nThe Desolations[edit]\n\nAt some point after the Shattering, Hoid visited Roshar and mingled with the original inhabitants of the world, even dancing with the ancient singers. He grew to be close with one singer known as Vatwha.[16]\n\nHe knew the Heralds, and they recognize him by the name Midius. He was the one that taught them how they could use Investiture to enhance their memories.[144][145] Whether he knew them before or after the Oathpact, or the exact nature of their relationship, is unclear.\n\nHoid came to be worshipped by the Unkalaki as Lunu'anaki, the god of travel and mischief who cannot hurt man.[33]\n\nHoid founded the Worldsingers, and has the rank of Master Worldsinger, and at some point in the early Sixth Epoch, he took Senne Khald as his apprentice, and assigned her with the task of writing a treatise on all the Radiant Orders.[146][147]\n\nHe has been to Aimia at some point.[148]\n\nHoid attempted to bond a Nahel spren at some point before the Recreance, possibly during a Desolation, but presumably failed.[149]\n\nCrisis in the Diem[edit]\n\nHoid traveled to Taldain, though for what reasons are unknown. He was there when the Taishin were deciding whether or not to disband the Diem.[150] Hoid later got onto the boat Khriss took to return to Darkside, where he sang a song to the passengers about the meaning of art.[151]\n\nThe Restoration of Elantris and Theft of the Moon Scepter[edit]\n\n“There is beauty in every disaster, friend, if you are clever enough to find it. ”\n\n—Hoid to a skaze[76]\n\nHoid traveled to Sel, likely making use of Devotion's Perpendicularity in Arelon. Hoid spoke to the skaze, and seems to have made some sort of agreement with them hinging on his desire to become an Elantrian with the restoration of Elantris.[76] Hoid disguised himself as a beggar, wrapped in bandages. He helped Sarene smuggle weapons into Elantris.[13] Following the restoration of the city by Raoden, Hoid traveled to the Pool to meet a skaze. He removed his bandages, hoping to find himself transformed into an Elantrian, but the transformation had not occurred. The skaze ridiculed Hoid for his failure, but Hoid expressed his joy that secrets still remained unknown to him and then entered the Perpendicularity and transitioned to the Cognitive Realm.[76]\n\nHoid returned to Sel several years later, and found himself a position in the court of Emperor Ashravan in the Rose Empire as the Royal Fool. He allied himself with the Forger Shai in her attempt to steal the Moon Scepter, an artifact that allows for the translation of the various symbols of Selish Investiture. He arranged for her to be caught after she'd left the Gallery with the Scepter, later using her duplicate to steal the scepter for himself. Hoid stole the Moon Scepter in order to help him translate between various symbols and gain access to the magics on Sel.[152]\n\nAt some point, he and Shai ran into each other once again, after Shai devoted herself towards finding him again to take her revenge.[153][154]\n\nThe Collapse of the Final Empire and Catacendre[edit]\n\nHoid arrived on Scadrial, likely through Ruin's perpendicularity in the Pits of Hathsin. He took up the guise of an informant, pretending to have bad eyesight in order to make himself less threatening to people seeking information from him.[155] At some point he became known to both Dockson and Ashweather Cett.[155][156] Kelsier, pretending to be a nobleman, contacted Hoid in 1022 FE, requesting information on House Renoux. Hoid (closed shop, smoking tobacco) met with Kelsier on the streets of Luthadel and told him that House Renoux was buying large amounts of weapons and armor from various noble houses and that Lord Renoux was considering a marriage between Valette and Elend Venture. He also claimed that Renoux was rumored to have some sort of leverage on Venture and that he knew Shan Elariel to be a Soother. At some point following this, he left Scadrial to attend to other business, again likely via the Pits.[157]\n\nAround a year later, in 1023 FE, Hoid returned to Scadrial, traveling through Scadrial's subastral, riding on the back of a Cognitive Shadow to the Well of Ascension, Preservation's Perpendicularity.[35] He was using an oar coated with a strange glowing substance connected to the substance drunk by members of the Ire.[158] He encountered the Shadow of Kelsier, who asked for help returning to the Physical Realm. Hoid told him that there was nothing to be done, but he challenged Kelsier to an insult battle, with the prize being the true answer to one question. Kelsier instead threatened Hoid. Hoid attempted to enter the pool, but Kelsier attacked him. Hoid easily overpowered Kelsier and caused him serious pain, but not permanent injury. Hoid then transitioned through the Well and stole a bead of lerasium from the adjacent room. He later consumed the lerasium and became a Mistborn.[102] When Kelsier spoke of the incident to Preservation, Preservation spoke briefly on Hoid, calling him Cephandrius. Later, Kelsier told Khriss and Nazh about his meeting with Hoid, and they seemed distressed to know that he had arrived and stolen a bead of lerasium.[132]\n\nHoid then traveled to the Terris Dominance to figure out Feruchemy,[159][157][160] and then became wrapped up in matters he did not anticipate. This may refer to him becoming involved after the Inquisitor attack on Tathingdwen and the slaughter of the Synod. Hoid took up the guise of a Terris leader[157] and led the Terris refugees to the Central Dominance.[161]\n\nA year later, in 1025 FE, Hoid was in Fadrex City, again acting as an informant, and Ashweather Cett suggested Vin speak to him.[14] Just before Vin arrived, Kelsier's Cognitive Shadow noticed Hoid from within the Cognitive Realm.[162] Kelsier tried to touch Hoid's soul, but was rebuffed by a shock that numbed his hand. At that moment, Vin arrived intending to meet with Hoid,[14] but Kelsier attempted to warn her away.[162] Since he was in the Cognitive Realm, he couldn't communicate with her directly, but she did sense that something was off about Hoid[163] and instead chose not to speak to him.\n\nHe has travelled to Scadrial several times between the Catacendre and the True Desolation, but actively hid from Harmony. During these visits he accomplished much, but what exactly he was doing is currently unknown.[164][165]\n\nThe Pahn Kahl Rebellion[edit]\n\nSeveral centuries later,[166] around Hallandren year 327,[167] Hoid traveled to Nalthis and took the role of a master storyteller. Lightsong summoned him to the Court of the Gods, where he recounted the story of Vo, explained the origin of the Hallandren God Kings, and answered Lightsong and Siri's questions.[9] He likely achieved perfect pitch while on this world by obtaining additional Breaths.[168][18][1] At some later point, Vivenna also met Hoid; she later described him as one of the only people on Nalthis that is cosmere-aware.\n\nHoid spent a lot of time gambling on Nalthis, and was fairly renowned. He would arrange things so that he could never lose, and then bet everything on himself. However, someone else managed to arrange it so that he couldn't win, either, resulting in a tie and the loss of his winnings.[7]\n\nVasher once met Hoid when he was using the alias \"Dust\", several years before Vasher's activities on Roshar.[169]\n\nObrodai[edit]\n\nHoid visited Obrodai at some point prior to the True Desolation. A female avatar was created by Autonomy and instilled with a great dislike of Hoid in order to prevent him from returning there.[170]\n\nPrelude to the True Desolation[edit]\n\n“I've come to your land to chase an old acquaintance, but I end up spending most of my time hiding from him instead. ”\n\n—Hoid to Kaladin.[21]\n\nAccording to Cord, when her grandmother served as watcher of the pool, Hoid warned the Unkalaki about the Gods Who Sleep Not.[171]\n\nRock also described an encounter with him in the Horneater Oceans.[33][172]\n\nIn a departure from his modus operandi, Hoid played a more conspicuous role in the events on Roshar, as his goal was to become a Radiant.[173] He has been to Threnody at some point before this visit to Roshar.[174]\n\nAt some point, Sigzil became his apprentice.[21] As master and apprentice, they traveled all across Roshar, including to Babatharnam. He had to pay to have Sigzil freed from prison on three separate occasions.[175] This relationship essentially ended after Sigzil attempted (and failed) to kill somebody and wound up punished via being made into a slave and bridgeman.[176]\n\n“Keep cutting away at those thorns, strong one, and make a path for the light.”\n\n—Hoid to Shallan[34]\n\nIn during the Middlefest Fair in Jah Keved, Shallan Davar met Hoid disguised as a messenger, and he spoke with her.[34] Seeing that she was emotionally distressed, he used emotional Allomancy in order to soothe her, and encouraged her to keep on pushing forward despite her struggles.[34][41] This meeting would leave a deep impression upon Shallan, and she would remember him for years after the event.[177]\n\nHe met Lift at some point after her blessing by the Nightwatcher in , but before her heist on the Bronze Palace in .[178][179] She was fond of him, and they parted ways when he jumped into the mouth of a greatshell.[179][15]\n\nIshikk was hired by three men from the Seventeenth Shard to search for Hoid in the Purelake, though all four failed to find him.[23] He searched for five months, though came up with no results.[23]\n\nThe War of Reckoning[edit]\n\nOnly a few months before the greatshell hunt on ,[8][180] he became the King's Wit, Elhokar Kholin's court jester. As the king lived at the Shattered Plains in order to better lead his people during the War of Reckoning, Wit spent most of his time at the plains. He was aware of Sigzil being held in slavery at the plains, but still avoided interacting with him, though not necessarily out of a lack of care.[21]\n\nThrough his role as Wit, he kept his eyes upon and influenced Dalinar Kholin, going so far as to ask him if he has ever heard the term \"Adonalsium\", as he believed that he was involved in secret societies such as the Sons of Honor, and thought that Gavilar Kholin confided in him; his suspicions were proven wrong.[20][181]\n\nHe also told Kaladin the story of Derethil and the Wandersail on .[21][180] During the course of the story, Hoid uses a special, ancient flute called a Trailman's flute. It is also likely that he used his Yolish Lightweaving to cause the smoke from the fire to take the form of various elements from his story. He told the story in order to teach Kaladin to take responsibility. As he sent him off, he gave him his Trailman's flute, and asked him to take care of Sigzil.[21]\n\nHoid was in Kholinar when Taln arrived to herald the coming of the Desolation on . Before his arrival, he was discussing with a few guards the nature of creativity, invention, and wisdom, and the deep importance in novelty and timeliness in all three. When he arrived, he apologized to his old friend, remarking that he was already too late.[28]\n\nLater, Hoid acted as the carriage driver for Adolin when he is visiting Shallan at Sebarial's warcamp. He speaks to Kaladin about his flute and mentions that he wants an interesting story from him. When Shallan recognizes him she happily hugs him for his advice from three and a half years prior when he encouraged her at her worst and told her to keep seeking the light.[177]\n\nHoid, acting as Wit, visits Kaladin while he is in prison on , seven days into his imprisonment. He tells Kaladin the story of a man named Fleet who raced a highstorm across one end of Roshar to the other. Fleet wins, but dies of exhaustion at the end, and his spirit goes on to race the wind forever.[18]\n\nThe True Desolation[edit]\n\nAfter the start of the True Desolation circa ,[182] on the day that the Everstorm was projected to hit Shinovar on , he monologued to a Sleepless Hordling about the nature of art. After he finished his monologue, he met with Jasnah Kholin as she exited the Cognitive Realm, offering to travel with her.[15][183]\n\nSiege of Kholinar[edit]\n\nHoid next appeared as Wit in Alethkar, discussing the nature of power with Shallan. Prior to that, while telling the story of Mishim in Alethkar, Hoid sees something next to his pack, which startles him. After the story, Shallan looks into Hoid's pack and sees a small, sealed black jar. The side of the jar pointing at Shallan was white. This might be a jar of sand from Taldain's Dayside, with the sand turning white showing Hoid a Surgebinder is near. This may be important, but not much is known about it. During Hoid's conversation with Shallan, he says that he knew of a group like the Cult of Moments, describing them as equally foolish and dangerous. It is unclear at the moment which group he may be referring to.\n\nHe later helps her get into the Cult of Moments, finding Shallan at her darkest moment, when she discovered the food she has been giving to the poor is just making things worse.[expand]\n\nShalash, upon seeing sketches of Talenel and herself, wondered aloud why Midius, another name for Hoid, was giving away drawings of them.[144]\n\nBonding of Design[edit]\n\nShortly after the Battle of Thaylen Field circa ,[184] Hoid was in Kholinar insulting a Thaylen man in an attempt to elicit a reaction. Upon realizing that the man couldn't understand Alethi, Hoid decided that repeating it all in Thaylen would be boring, so he cut in front of the man. The man hit Hoid, knocking loose a tooth which Hoid discarded upon leaving the area. While in the city, he noticed Vatwha, recognizing her as an old acquaintance. Despite this old camaraderie, the Fused were trained to watch for him - most likely to capture him and deliver him to Odium.[16]\n\nWhile walking through the city he found a child around the corpse of her mother, and used Awakening to lure her away from the body, leaving her in the care of a family in the city. He then headed to the palace where he finds a Cryptic, the spren Elhokar was about to bond before he died. This Spren was Design, and he bonded to her, becoming a Surgebinder of the Order of Lightweavers.[16][185]\n\nDuring an unknown point in the year between his bonding of Design and the expedition in Emul and Singer occupation of Urithiru, he and Jasnah began a romantic relationship.[186][187][7]\n\nCampaign in Emul[edit]\n\nHe and Jasnah both went to the expedition in Emul in .[186] During their expedition, Ruthar angered them both greatly, and Jasnah sent him to insult the highprince. After doing so, Ruthar challenged him to combat, but he chose Jasnah as his champion. She easily stabbed him through the throat, but had Renarin heal him.[43]\n\nHe later noticed that a Sleepless was spying upon him and Jasnah.[188]\n\nWhen Kaladin was stuck in a vision by Odium, he and Design appeared to him in order to tell him the story of the Dog and the Dragon, in order to try and cheer him up and point him in the right direction.[39]\n\nWriting the Contract and the Ascension of Taravangian[edit]\n\nHe and Jasnah worked together in order to write up a contract for the contest of champions with Odium.[7]\n\nSome time after Taravangian took up Odium on , Hoid was visited by the new Vessel while he was telling stories at the Shattered Plains. Taravangian's demeanor revealed what happened to Hoid, who, terrified by the idea of Odium having a new Vessel, began to leave. Realizing that he was found out, Odium rammed into him with energy in order to lock him in place, trying to find a way to harm him without breaking the Shardic oath he was still held to. While searching, he discovered that Hoid kept his short-term memories stored in his Breaths. He destroyed these, erasing part of his memory, in order to redo the interaction. In this second interaction, Taravangian was able to interact with Hoid while successfully convincing the man that he was still Rayse. Hoid left this second conversation believing that everything had gone according to plan.[1] However, afterwards he became aware of the fact that his memories were stolen and instituted protection protocols to defend himself if something or someone tried to interact with his soul.[59]\n\nThe destruction of his Breaths led him to falling below the Second Heightening, and losing his Perfect Pitch.[1]\n\nSigzil and the Dawnshard[edit]\n\n“I was wrong. I did the best with the situation I had, hoping it would prevent calamity. I ruined your life, and I was wrong. I’m sorry. ”\n\n—Hoid to Sigzil[6]\n\nAt some point, Hoid asked his apprentice Sigzil to briefly take up the same Dawnshard that gave Hoid his immortality,[189] an action that he believed would be necessary to avert calamity.[6] Hoid passed the Dawnshard to Sigzil, who was changed in some ways that were similar to Hoid, acquiring the ability to Skip to any planet in the cosmere, as well as his own inability to do violence.[5] This action would ultimately cause Sigzil to nearly kill his spren Auxiliary when the Dawnshard drew upon the Investiture that made up the spren in an attempt to defend itself.[189] This action ruined Sigzil's life, and forced him to remain on the move outrunning the Night Brigade in their quest to capture him.[6] Hoid regained possession of that Dawnshard again as well, meaning Sigzil was ultimately running from the Night Brigade to prevent them from finding Hoid. However, Hoid had come to feel sorrowful for his actions there, and felt like though his motivations were noble, the outcomes were ultimately not worth it and he was wrong to have done what he did.\n\nThe Letters[edit]\n\nAt some point, he wrote a letter to Frost. He wrote about how he was being hunted by the Seventeenth Shard and has set a false trail for them to follow, referencing the three figures sent by the Seventeenth Shard that were searching for him.[23] He came across as not at all worried about them, and in fact seemed mildly amused. He also asked Frost for his support in stopping Rayse, but was dismissed since Odium was trapped in the Rosharan system.[190]\n\nHe attempted to contact various Shards about Rayse and his worries that he would eventually escape. The figures he contacted were Endowment, Autonomy, and Harmony. The first two responded with aggressive dismissal, but Harmony was very receptive to his contact and responded curiosity and a desire for further contact.[191][192][193][194]\n\nDue to him being more receptive towards his advances, he contacted Harmony again, and requested that he try to contact other Shards concerning the growing threat of Rayse's escape from the Rosharan System, a request he fulfilled. This contact resulted in a variety of different responses, which, as with his own attempts, resulted mostly in dismissal.[195]\n\nPost-Catacendric Scadrial[edit]\n\n“Oh, my lord, I know it, I do. I own the place, technically. Now, regarding those coins for old Hoid, my good lord... ”\n\n—Hoid to Wax[196]\n\nIn 342 PC, following his actions on Roshar,[fn 1] Hoid returned to Scadrial to attend the wedding of Lord Joshin Yomen and Lady Mi'chelle Ostlin,[197][198] two friends of his that he had made at some unknown point in the past.[199] He did so via finding some way to bypass the strong Connection binding him to Roshar after becoming a Surgebinder[200][201][202]\n\nRather than coming to Scadrial in response to some important event, Hoid initially came merely to congratulate his friends.[199] He came dressed all in black, appearing as a scruffy looking beggar and spoke to the couple soon after they arrived at the dinner.[203] It is unknown if he was present for the subsequent Vanisher attack. Hoid may have left the planet briefly afterwards, but something on Scadrial had caught his attention and he was back several months later.[204] Hoid became employed as Waxillium Ladrian's new carriage driver.[205] By that point he had become friendly with Wayne, who liked him but did not know anything about Hoid's true identity.[206] When Wax headed to the precinct station to question Rian, Hoid drove the carriage and Wayne rode up front with him.[205] During the carriage ride, Hoid eavesdropped on Wax's conversation with Harmony about Bleeder's plans to disrupt the Elendel Basin.[207]\n\nHoid's actions after this point are unclear. Hoid somehow obtained a coin-like unsealed metalmind containing a memory of Kelsier aiding the southern Scadrians in surviving the aftereffects of the Catacendre.[208] He also spent some time in New Seran and following Nazh's theft of Nicki Savage's map of New Seran, Hoid asked her if she wanted to hear a story, an offer that she declined.[209][210] He has also somehow come to the conclusion that he is the true owner of Kelesina Shores' mansion there,[211] for somewhat legitimate but unknown reasons.[212] He was apparently a regular intruder on the mansion grounds, to the irritation of the guards.[196] During this time, Hoid took the appearance of a beggar with long, unkempt fingernails and a ragged shirt. Hoid appeared blind with milky white eyes.\n\nWhen Waxillium Ladrian walked up the path to Kelesina's mansion to attend a party with Steris Harms, Hoid climbed out of the bushes, startling Wax, although Wax did not recognise Hoid as his carriage driver through his disguise.[196] Wanting to reveal Kelsier's resurrection and identity as the Sovereign,[213] Hoid looked for an opportunity to pass on the unsealed metalmind. He asked Wax for a few clips.[196] Steris noticed Hoid's cologne and asked him if he was wearing cologne. Hoid was startled by her observation and claimed that he had been drinking perfume, as it had quite a kick. Steris told him that that was unhealthy and Wax advised Hoid that he should leave the private grounds. Hoid agreed but claimed that it was his property and again asked for coins. Wax gave him a banknote and told him again to leave the grounds. Hoid claimed it was far too much and that he wished to give Waxillium change. As Wax walked away, Hoid threw the coin at Wax's head, who caught it in midair. A groundsman then noticed Hoid and tried to chase him off. Hoid laughed and escaped back into the bushes again.\n\n“Carriage for you, sir? ”\n\n—Hoid to Wax in the middle of the ocean[214]\n\nHoid later became involved in the sting operation that Marasi ran in Bilming in 348 PC. He had a silent interaction with Moonlight from different trucks. Moonlight commented that she couldn't tell whether she was watching Hoid or if Hoid was watching her, but then resolved that they were both just keeping an eye on the same third parties.[154] After Wax arrived in Bilming, and gave chase to Dumad he casually appeared in a sleek black car to give Wax a ride.[215] In Bilming, he traded his harmonica with Wayne for a rat named Sir Squeekins.[216] Since this event, he has been taking good care of Sir Squeekins.[217] He also showed up to rescue Wax from the ocean in a small boat after the explosion of the Pewternaut A16.[214]\n\nBet with the Sorceress of Lumar[edit]\n\nHoid would later go on to visit the planet of Lumar,[218][fn 2] a relative backwater in the cosmere.[221]\n\nAt some point he informed his friend, the kandra Ulaam, of his intentions to visit the planet via letter.[224] Still hoping to gain access to AonDor, he met with Riina, who was living on the planet in the guise the Sorceress of the Midnight Sea.[224] While visiting her island, Hoid agreed to a bet with her. Riina would be allowed to place him under a curse, and in exchange, if he could successfully break it, he would be granted admission to the Elantrians and the ability to use AonDor. The curse placed on him stripped him of his sense of humor, sense of style, sense of decorum, sense of purpose, intelligence, and sense of self.[220] In order to break the curse, he would need to return to the central room of the Sorceress' ship on her island.[17] As a part of the curse, he was also forbidden from telling anyone any information about his curse, how he had been given it, or how it could be broken. Riina finished her casting by sending Hoid far away from the Midnight Sea. During his time here, he likely came into possession of some Midnight spores.[225]\n\n“I once ate an entire watermelon in one sitting. And it gave me diarrhea.”\n\n—Hoid to Tress while under the effects of Riina's curse[3]\n\nWhile under the effects of this curse, Hoid's behavior bore little resemblance to his normal personality. He dressed quite oddly, trying at times to wear every shade of orange he could find,[226] or his red-sequined briefs.[227] He spent time doing things like inventing the card game Kings, in which you hold your cards backwards and can see everyone's hand but your own, an invention that lost him many of his possessions. Bad jokes and nonsensical ideas filled basically all his time, and he was only very rarely able to think clearly enough to communicate anything meaningful or work to accomplish his goals. He was left with some dim awareness of his situation though, a cruel decision on the part of Riina who wanted him aware enough to be horrified by his situation. Any attempt to share information about his curse would only start him stuttering and send him back to his normal befuddled state.[3]\n\nHoid spent a long time at sea, wandering without apparent progress at breaking his curse. Ulaam eventually arrived on the planet and found Hoid, but was uninterested in working too hard to free him from his curse, preferring to simply stick close and wait for the problem to resolve itself.[3] The two of them spent at least a year traveling together in this way.[221] Eventually Hoid would become the cabin boy of the Whistlebow.[228] He came into contact with Charlie, son of the duke of Diggen's Point and returned there to give Tress a ceramic cup and Charlie's first letter to her.[218] Later, he was traded for by Fort for a large sum on the orders of Captain Crow who was interested in Hoid once she had heard that he had been cursed by the Sorceress.[229] Hoid settled onto a routine onto the Crow's Song, working as a cabin boy there as well,[220] and kept fed despite his near-uselessness by Fort.[230] Ulaam continued as his companion, and the two were suffered by the crew despite their oddities, due in part to Ulaam's skill with medicine.[231] During his time on the Crow's Song, Hoid gave midnight spores to Weev, the ship's sprouter, believing them to be licorice.[225]\n\nAnother of his shipmates, Tress, became interested in Hoid's past after Ulaam explained to her that Hoid had been cursed,[224] and approached him on the deck of the ship to try to obtain information about the Sorcess despite his curse.[3] Hoid was unable to say much of note, but he dimly realized she was trying to help him and was able to offer some cryptic clues, asking Tress to bring him to her planet so he could save her,[3] meaning the map of Lumar present on the Sorceress's ship.[232] He also told her to look for a grouping of six stars,[3] a carving under her bed, which would lead her to Weev's secret supply of midnight aether.[3] After Tress recovered the midnight aether, Ulaam confronted Hoid, asking if he had given the aether to her. Ulaam and Tress continued to press Hoid for information and he was able to tell them to look for a person that is not a person and could talk when they should not, which they realized referred to Charlie in his guise of Huck the rat.[225]\n\nAs the Crow's Song continued its journey into the Crimson Sea, Hoid continued to stymie Tress's attempts to wheedle more information out of him, unable to point at words on a sheet of paper that might be relevant to his curse. However, Tress realized that he she could glean information from his silences though, as he stopped speaking when the subject turned to the matter of his curse. This allowed him to indicate to her where Riina's island might be found on a map.[221] As they traveled closer to the Midnight Sea, Huck convinced the addled Hoid to dump much of the ship's food and water overboard, in an unsuccessful attempt to force the crew to return the to Emerald Sea.[51]\n\nLater when the Crow's Song reached the Sorceress's island, the ship's crew carried Hoid into the Sorceress's ship to save Tress and Huck,[233] who had realized that bringing Hoid to the center of the Sorceress's power would break the curse, and hopefully allow him to defeat her.[232] When Hoid entered the tower, the terms of the bet were fulfilled and he was restored to his sense and transformed into an Elantrian. Hoid arrived just in time to use AonDor to throw up a shield and prevent Riina from cursing Tress. In the brief confrontation that followed, Riina judged that she was not confident enough that she could defeat Hoid to risk a direct confrontation with him, instead choosing to flee the planet and let Hoid, Tress, and Charlie go free. While Hoid was unable to directly remove the curse on Charlie, he was able to tweak the parameters so that Charlie could break the curse himself once he returned to Diggen's Point with Tress.[17] Hoid may have lingered with them for some time giving Charlie some pointers on storytelling and music.[118]\n\nHoid would later share his adventure with Tress and Charlie as a story to an unknown audience, potentially made up of people from the planet First of the Sun.[3][219] It is unknown exactly when he tells this story relative to the events, but it is known to be within years or decades, but less than centuries.[234]\n\nMeeting with Sigzil on Canticle[edit]\n\nWhen Hoid's apprentice Sigzil arrived on Canticle, Sigzil's spren Auxiliary used some Investiture they had acquired to temporarily reinforce Sigzil's Connection to Hoid, allowing Hoid to appear before Sigzil as an illusion.[6] Sigzil remained angry with Hoid for the betrayal, feeling as if he had been tricked and used by Wit when he was asked to take up the Dawnshard, and forced into his life of fleeing the Night Brigade. He confronted Hoid in anger for this and his betrayal in the warcamps. Hoid responded by explaining to Sigzil that he had taken him on as an apprentice due to his hunger for answers to all his questions. Hoid reminded Sigzil that while that it was a good instinct, it's important to realize that the questions are more important than the answers themselves sometimes. As the Connection faded, Hoid apologized sincerely to Sigzil for his mistake, and for ruining his life.\n\nFrozen on Komashi[edit]\n\nAt some point after Sigzil's overthrowing of the Cinder King,[fn 3] Hoid went with Design to Komashi and was almost instantly frozen in place, unable to move. This was due to the protection measures that he instituted to prevent other entities from interfering with his Investiture after recovering from Odium's destruction of his breaths.[1] It activated as, immediately upon his arrival, the father machine attempted to absorb his Investiture to power itself.[59] Seeing his state, Design spraypainted him copper and used him as a coatrack in her new noodle shop, the Noodle Pupil. At some point following his stasis, he formed a Connection with Painter, Yumi, and Liyun allowing him to tell what they were doing, feeling, and thinking, along with many others on the planet, though he felt it with them particularly acutely, and knew it had something to do with him.[60][236]\n\nAfter the father machine was destroyed by Yumi, and the attempts to absorb his Investiture thus halted, he was freed from his stasis. He planned with Design to disguise themselves as astronauts and steal a ship, allowing them to travel to the nearby Iron Seven Waystation.[59]\n\nHe kept in contact with Nikaro, Yumi, and Masaka, via letters and inquiries, allowing him to keep up with their lives and how society coped with the loss of the shroud.[59] He would eventually tell the story of Yumi and Painter to an unknown audience on Roshar, with permission from those involved.[237][61][59][238]\n\nIt is possible that Hoid had been to Komashi at some point before the activation of the father machine, as he had some implied familiarity with some elements of Torish culture.[239]\n\nRelationships[edit]\n\nDue to his nature as a worldhopper, Hoid has met most of the main characters in the cosmere, as well as a large quantity of side characters.\n\nThe Shards[edit]\n\nHoid's relationships with the various Vessels are varied, to say the least, ranging from hate and terror to respect and cameraderie.\n\nAti\n\nHe considers Ati to once have been a kind and generous man before his Ascension, though he thinks very differently of what he became.[130]\n\nBavadin\n\nHoid has a long-standing grudge against Bavadin for unknown reasons.[138][139] She has instilled in many of her avatars, including the one on Obrodai, a deep dislike of him;[170] however, he and Bavadin herself had a relationship at some point.[192]\n\nEdgli\n\nHoid and Edgli mutually detest each other. However, their conversations are far more polite than Hoid's relations with Bavadin or Rayse.[191][50]\n\nKoravellium Avast\n\nHoid, while not enemies with Koravellium, has never really gotten along with her. However, he recognizes the fact that she poses a threat to Odium, and respects that.[177]\n\nRayse\n\nHoid was once friends with Rayse,[1][131] though considered him to have always been a very loathsome, crafty, and dangerous individual.[130] He is now terrified of the Shard, and takes many precautions against him. However, he is not above taunting the Shard, as he feels him to be the most detestable person he has ever met, albeit preferably from a position of superiority. Prior to Rayse's death, Hoid had not met the Shard in person for more than a thousand years.[1][130]\n\nSazed\n\nSazed has a benevolent feeling towards Hoid.[194] However, the latter has nevertheless hidden from the Shard whenever he visits Scadrial,[164] a decision of which Sazed disapproves and questions,[240] but by which he is also fascinated.[165] He wishes to work with Hoid to keep Odium contained, as he is highly disturbed by the wound upon the Spiritual Realm where Ambition was Splintered. They disagree on whether it is the Vessel or the power that is more dangerous, with Sazed believing that the Investiture will make any Vessel of Odium the same as their predecessor, but they agree that it would be the combination of a Vessel's craftiness and the power's Intent that would be most fearsome--coincidentally, a very good description of Taravangian.\n\nTanavast\n\nHoid was acquainted with Tanavast before the Shattering. Tanavast did like Hoid enough to buy him drinks once.[15]\n\nTaravangian\n\nPrior to Taravangian's Ascension, Hoid had never notably interacted with him. However, after the occupation of Urithiru, when going to challenge Rayse, he realized that a new Vessel had Ascended, and was completely terrified, as Rayse was controlled by the power, but a new Vessel might have more control. However, Taravangian destroyed the Breaths holding his short-term memory, so he did not believe anything to be amiss.[1]\n\nValor\n\nValor appears rather fond of Hoid, and believes it has been too long since their last conversation as of Harmony's letter.[241] The exact nature of their relationship, and his feelings concerning her, are currently unknown.\n\nCosmere-Wide[edit]\n\nKhrissalla\n\nHoid thinks well of Khriss.[242] Although it is unknown how much information she has shared with him, she knows far more about the cosmere than he, as she pursues the knowledge for the sake of scholarship, while he uses it to sound smart and achieve his goals.[243] If he were to ask her about something that she knew, though, and she perceived that he was asking for a morally good reason, she would tell him.[244]\n\nThe Seventeenth Shard\n\nHoid is quite dismissive of the Seventeenth Shard. Although they fear that his actions will exacerbate Shardic conflict due to their non-interventionist policy, he easily evades those whom they assign to pursue him.[23][245][246]\n\nFrost\n\nHoid and Frost know each other well, having worked together in the past, and have a method of communicating with one another besides the Silverlight Mercantile interplanetary postal service. Despite this, they are completely opposed on the courses of action that would be best for the cosmere. Frost, as a member of the Seventeenth Shard,[246] believes that the best course of action is to let events play out as they will, especially in regard to Odium's growing power and ambition. However, as Hoid is a worldhopper and Frost is not, the former believes that he has a more informed stance, and plans to take more active action against the Shard.[124][247][248]\n\nThe Ghostbloods\n\nHoid has a very different opinion of the Ghostbloods than he does of their leader, viewing them as generally not a threat.[188][249]\n\nWan ShaiLu\n\nIt is unclear how he feels about Wan ShaiLu, despite him betraying her without hesitation in order to get his hands on the Moon Scepter.[250][251]\n\nWan ShaiLu, on the other hand, despises him for his betrayal.[250] After escaping from the Rose Empire, she began to hunt after him to enact her revenge, an act that she eventually succeeded at.[154][252] Their current relationship is unclear, but she does wonder to herself if she was keeping watch over him, or he over her, but she knows that they are in reality just keeping watch over the same third parties.[154]\n\nNightblood\n\nHoid is terrified of Nightblood and tries to stay very far away from it, as he believes that it has a chance of killing him.[62][253]\n\nRiina\n\nHe has a very hostile relationship with Riina, with her having cursed him to tastelessness and unintelligence.[expand][citation needed]\n\nUlaam\n\n“Hoid has too many issues to count. I wouldn’t trouble yourself with his situation. He’s nearly as deft at untying knots as he is at creating them. ”\n\n—Ulaam to Tress on Hoid[224]\n\nHe has a relatively amiable relationship with Ulaam, with the two considering each other friends. Though Ulaam does enjoy insulting and humiliating him, even recording what he said during his curse from Riina in order to embarrass him for years, and also has sent records to their mutual friends.[231][expand][citation needed]\n\nRoshar[edit]\n\nIn his position as King's, and later, Queen's Wit, Hoid has had opportunities to interact with many notable Rosharans, and has taken full advantage of such chances.\n\nDesign\n\nHoid has a fondly exasperated view towards Design. Though, as a pair who share a Nahel bond, they are extremely close, he is consistently frustrated by her habit of spoiling stories that he's telling, as he sees it.[39][1]\n\nDespite this amicable relationship, they are not the best for each other, exacerbate certain features of one another in a way that isn't good for either of them.[185]\n\nJasnah\n\nHoid is romantically involved with Jasnah.[7][186] He also has immense respect for her, both due to her sheer intelligence and the fact that, when all else fails, she is, above all, paranoid. Jasnah notes that he seems to think such things as kissing her safehand would spark passion in her, though it is her view that mental stimulation is far superior.\n\nKaladin\n\nHoid feels paternally to Kaladin. In such situations as when Kaladin is terrified at the discovery of his Radiant powers,[21] languishing in prison,[18] or trapped in a vision concocted by Odium and Moash in order to try and break him,[39] Hoid is always there with a story to bring him back from the brink, and at one point gave Kaladin his Trailman's flute.\n\nSenne Khald\n\nHoid took Senne Khald as his apprentice in the Sixth Epoch. Though his exact relationship with her is unclear.[147]\n\nShallan Davar\n\nHoid feels similarly to Shallan as he does to Kaladin. Visiting her in times of need, such as when her father is growing more and more abusive or when she's sitting in a dark building in Kholinar, racked with guilt about Grund's death, he guides her to a path of self-forgiveness.\n\nSigzil\n\nHoid's relationship with Sigzil seems similar to that of Jasnah and Shallan. When in Azir, Hoid found Sigzil to be in some sort of trouble, and, after rescuing him, took the young Azish man under his wing and began teaching him as a Worldsinger.[21] The two traveled Roshar together, at one point ending up in Babatharnam, where Hoid had to pay for Sigzil to be freed three separate times, though Sigzil suspected that they mainly arrested him because Hoid had a lot of money.[33] Hoid graduated him as a full Worldsinger in .[21]\n\nHoid feels shame for how he affected Sigzil by giving him the Dawnshard, and for abandoning him to slavery.[6]\n\nFor a while, Sigzil believed that Hoid thought him dead, but was filled with rage upon learning that he knew he was alive all through his slavery at the Shattered Plains.[6] He is further angered by the burden placed upon him by Hoid giving him the Dawnshard.[6]\n\nTorol Sadeas\n\nHoid dislikes Sadeas, insulting him at any chance he gets. Though at first he tries to get Sadeas to attempt to kill him in order to remove the man as a threat, he makes fun of Sadeas after his death just for the fun of it.[254][42][citation needed]\n\nScadrial[edit]\n\nKelsier\n\nKelsier and Hoid mutually detest one another. Hoid considers him extremely dangerous, though he doesn't think much of his organization.[188][249] However, this doesn't stop him from taking action against the Cognitive Shadow, such as when he gives Wax a coppermind containing knowledge that Kelsier would have preferred to have stayed hidden.[208]\n\nWax\n\nHe seems to think positively of Wax, acting as his coachman and helping him on multiple occasions, such as giving him a coppermind containing information on Kelsier,[196][208] and saving him from the ocean after the destruction of the Pewternaut.[214]\n\nWayne\n\nHe has a rather cordial relationship with Wayne, although he finds him bizarre. He once tried to convince Wayne to stop being so hard on himself and accept that he is a good person.[216] Wayne also likes Hoid, and enjoys talking with him, though he doesn't know his true identity.[205][206]\n\nWhile relatively cordial, Hoid does seem to get annoyed by his kleptomania. Even though he wanted his harmonica back, he did ultimately accept Wayne's trade of it for a rat.[216]\n\nJoshin Yomen and Lady Mi'chelle Ostlin\n\nHe is good friends with Joshin Yomen and Lady Mi'chelle Ostlin, with their wedding being a big part of why he returned to Scadrial, wanting to come to congratulate his friends.[197][199][203]\n\nLumar[edit]\n\nTress\n\nHe holds enough respect for Tress and her adventure that he sees her as very mature and talented for her age,[118] and he remembered her adventure and told the tale years to decades after they parted.[118][234] Though he still felt that she didn't have the right to give him commands, but ultimately obliged due to her being his captain.[17] He has kept tabs on her and the rest of the crew of the Crow's Song for several years after his curse was broken.[118]\n\nTress knew Hoid as a cabin boy on Diggen's Point, and a member of the Crow's Song. Though, for much of their relationship, she held little respect for him due to the effects of the curse Riina put on him.[224][229] She eventually came to see him as a means to an end for finding Charlie.[224] Her opinion on him greatly changed after he saved her from Riina after his curse was broken, though she still viewed him as a member of her crew and thus under her command.[17]\n\nKnown Aliases[edit]\n\nSpeculation[edit]\n\nWorldsingers & Worldbringers[edit]\n\nThe names of the Worldsingers, a group of storytellers on Roshar, and the Conclave of Worldbringers, the leading body of the original Terris religion, are strikingly similar. Brandon has stated that this is not a coincidence.[260] Some believe that Hoid is a common root to both of these organizations, one of which, the Worldbringers, was very Realmatically aware.[261] In addition to this he is known to be a founder of the Worldsingers and a member of the Worldbringers.[146][3]\n\nQuotes[edit]\n\nFor a list of quotes, see /Quotes.\n\nTrivia[edit]\n\nThe character of Hoid existed before the concept of Adonalsium was developed. He first appeared in a short story Brandon wrote long ago, going by the name Kamp.[262] He was on a planet trying to figure out how the magical system of the area worked.[263]\n\nBrandon has stated that Hoid is one of his favorite characters, alongside Dalinar, by the virtue of being one of the oldest.[264]\n\nBrandon may eventually write a parallel novel to the Mistborn series that chronicles what Hoid was up to behind the scenes.[265]\n\nIn 2018, Brandon did a reading of an uncanonical scene he had written several years prior, called \"The Traveler.\" In it, two men, likely Hoid and Frost, have a conversation shortly after the deaths of Leras and Ati. A recording and a transcription of the reading can be found here.\n\nHoid, under the name Topaz, was Brandon's first Dungeons & Dragons character.[266]\n\nBrandon does not believe he would aid Hoid's cause if he were in the cosmere.[267]\n\nHoid fears the Beyond.[268]\n\nHe has a good opinion of Khriss, and they have met at least once.[242]\n\nHoid has spoken with the Nightwatcher.[269]\n\nFor several books, Hoid's best friend was somebody named Bat'Chor. This may no longer be the case as of Mistborn Era 2.[270]\n\nHoid has had a romantic interest in the past.[271] In fact, there were several.[272]\n\nHe is the happiest when \"getting away with something\". When asked in what published book that was, Brandon responded with The Bands of Mourning.[48]\n\nHoid's quest may be \"To make that which once was.\"[52]\n\nHoid is unimpressed with the Ghostbloods.[249]\n\nHoid loathes the Set, and the members who know of him loathe him in return.[273]\n\nThough he once (extremely accurately) said to Kaladin that he began life as words on a page, this was not in fact a break of the fourth wall.[274]\n\nHe has dressed in drag before, \"multiple times.\"[275]\n\nPrior to the events of Words of Radiance, Hoid had not been hugged in \"a long time.\"[276]\n\nHis favorite type of spren is a Cryptic.[277]\n\nHoid does not pay taxes.[278]\n\nHoid's favorite color is black.[279]\n\nHoid loves bacon.[280]\n\nHoid likes milkshakes.[281]\n\nHoid is interested in having a nose that can't smell cheese.[222]\n\nHoid is a fan of ramen.[282] and co-owned a restaurant called the Noodle Pupil on Komashi with Design[60] before Design gave it away to Yumi and Nikaro.[59]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\nFootnotes\n\nReferences\n\nThis article is still missing information.
