        "text": "Maija DiGiorgio will bring her comedy performance to the the Milton Theatre at 8 p.m., Saturday, Jan. 14.\n\nDiGiorgio is a gifted, multitalented comedienne whose memorable performance is infused with a unique combination of energy, enthusiasm, wry candor and witty observation. Her act is inspired by her biracial heritage as the daughter of an award-winning, mambo-dancing Sicilian father and an African-American chanteuse virtuoso mother. Her standup comedy reflects experiences throughout the world of dating and relationships, reflections on her heritage and her culturally diverse childhood.\n\nDiGiorgio enjoys making people laugh through her translation of the human condition peppered with stories from different times of her life. She has performed at top comedy clubs and festivals throughout the United States, including the Comedy Cellar, Caroline's and The Apollo Theater. She made her national television debut turning a booing audience to a standing ovation on \"Showtime at the Apollo.\" Since then, she has been seen on a number of television shows, including Fox's \"Laughs\" \"Comics Unleashed,\" \"Def Comedy Jam,\" BET's \"Comic View,\" Showtime's \"Michael Vick Comedy Explosion,\" Netflix's \"Uncontrolled Comedy Hour\" and \"Sex and The City.\" She has performed with Dave Chappelle, Kevin Hart, Dane Cook, Wanda Sykes, Lisa Lampanelli, Jeff Ross, Louis CK, Mike Epps and Tracy Morgan."
