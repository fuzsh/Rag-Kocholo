        "text": "Be your own you! Everyone is special in their own way!\n\n- CopyCat (Greeting Card)\n\nPrototype Bittergiggle is an alternate universe revamp of the cyan-gray Bittergiggle that was cut in halves and tossed into the abyss by a Givanium Worker.\n\nOverview\n\nAppearance\n\nPrototype Bittergiggle is a Bittergiggle recolor, that is cyan and gray instead of dark periwinkle and green. Their monster form is the same as Bittergiggle's, but with no burns considering they were never in the fire.\n\nPersonality\n\nPrototype has never been given a \"direct\" personality, but instead was given ideas for a personality. One being he could be a pychopath or pyromanic, yet this was scrapped and so was the monster due to children not being supposed to be around pychopaths and pyromanics, and the worker who came up with the idea was subsequently fired. After this, Prototype started to pick up an \"evil,\" \"sadistic,\" or even \"inapproprate\" personality, and was scrapped, killed, and tossed into the abyss.\n\nTrivia\n\nThis character's name was canonically once called \"CopyCat.\"\n\nThis was the name written on his greeting card, yet he still is called Proto.\n\nPrototype was directly based off of Cyan-Gray Bittergiggle."
