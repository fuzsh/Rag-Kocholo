        "text": "The Jester lives in the moment and just enjoy life. They fear boredom above everything. A Jester brand archetype tends to give out the impression that they live on the wild side and use outrageous imagery to often tease their customers affectionately.\n\nThe Jester business is a clever one. Finding success through brainstorming and lateral thinking, the Jester makes sure their team is having fun while they’re at it. They motivate people to see the value of play and by allowing people to connect with their fun inner child — impulsive and unrestrained, not afraid to bend rules, not afraid to stand out, and comfortable in their own skin.\n\nThe worst thing that could happen to a Jester brand would be to get embroiled in a bitter lawsuit or be seen as strict or boring. On a positive note, they are carefree and different but at their worst Jester brands can be cruel and irresponsible.\n\nThe Jester – Key Characteristics and Values"
