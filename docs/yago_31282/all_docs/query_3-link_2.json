Their latest album is an eclectic mix of genres, making for a unique listening experience. With their unwavering passion and commitment to music, Cо̄rduroy is excited to make their mark on the music industry and is joined at Bitter Jester by guest drummer Max Beardsley.\n\nDavid's House is a captivating young rock band with a powerful, highly engaging sound that infuses funk and soul with stunning vocals and superb musicianship. The band puts on an electric show, full of intensity and positive energy that leaves every audience wanting more. Their original songs often remind listeners of Steely Dan and Lake Street Dive.\n\nFightin’ Bob is a five-piece “Frog Rock” (funk/progressive rock) band from Milwaukee whose sound combines influences in prog rock, hard rock, funk, and jazz/fusion, among others. The band has one album and one single released with a second album written and about to be recorded. Their energetic stage presence, flashy antics, and pure determination to groove will get you dancing!\n\nGeology Club is a group of teens with a focus on making music. The group consists of Alex Bonell, lead singer, Evan Hansen, lead guitarist, Miah Miner, bassist, and Ian Dutter, drummer. The band was created in February, 2020, and has since released an EP called \"Sugar High,\" which has an Indie Rock feel. They hope you enjoy the music!\n\nGirl Club is a five-piece student band from Highland Park High School. They consist of Juniors Robert Oboza, Yonatan Garfinkel, Nolan Schott, Tane Walker, and Freshman Lucia Seiden. Individually, the members participate in HPHS choir, jazz band, theater, and percussion, respectively.

Bringing a new age sound with a classic rock feel, there are few doing it quite like Misplaced Religion. To put them into a genre, they would be best described as \"Alternative-rock\" ... but come to the show and find out how you define the band.\n\nPalace Kat consists of a trumpet player, saxophonist, keyboardist, bassist, and drummer. The band enjoys performing mostly a wide range of music related to jazz. The performers are all alumni of Jefferson High School, and, with their combined love for music, have stuck together and formed a passionate, talented band aimed at expressing that passion.\n\nRotting King is a Metal band from Chicago.
