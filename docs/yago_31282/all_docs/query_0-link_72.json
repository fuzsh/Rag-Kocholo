        "text": "Development and validation of in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) for estradiol transdermal drug delivery systems.\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, Yang; Manda, Prashanth; Pavurala, Naresh; Khan, Mansoor A; Krishnaiah, Yellela S R\n\n2015-07-28\n\nThe objective of this study was to develop a level A in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) for drug-in-adhesive (DIA) type estradiol transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS). In vitro drug permeation studies across human skin were carried out to obtain the percent of estradiol permeation from marketed products. The in vivo time versus plasma concentration data of three estradiol TDDS at drug loadings of 2.0, 3.8 and 7.6mg (delivery rates of 25, 50 and 100Î¼g/day, respectively) was deconvoluted using Wagner-Nelson method to obtain percent of in vivo drug absorption in postmenopausal women. The IVIVC between the in vitro percent of drug permeation (X) and in vivo percent of drug absorption (Y) for these three estradiol TDDS was constructed using GastroPlusÂ® software. There was a high correlation (R(2)=1.0) with a polynomial regression of Y=-0.227X(2)+0.331X-0.001. These three estradiol TDDS were used for internal validation whereas another two products of the same formulation design (with delivery rates of 60 and 100Î¼g/day) were used for external validation. The predicted estradiol serum concentrations (convoluted from in vitro skin permeation data) were compared with the observed serum concentrations for the respective products. The developed IVIVC model passed both the internal and external validations as the prediction errors (%PE) for Cmax and AUC were less than 15%. When another marketed estradiol TDDS with a delivery rate of 100Î¼g/day but with a slight variation in formulation design was chosen, it did not pass external validation indicating the product-specific nature of IVIVC model. Results suggest that the IVIVC model developed in this study can be used to successfully predict the in vivo performance of the same estradiol TDDS with in vivo delivery rates ranging from 25 to 100Î¼g/day.

Firstly, the pharmacokinetic data ware fitted by mathematical software to make up the lost points. Secondly, the parameters of the optimal fitted input function were defined by trail-and-error method according to the convolution principle in Excel under the hypothesis that all the input functions fit the Weibull functions. Finally, the IVIVC between in vivo input function and the in vitro dissolution was studied. In the examples, not only the application of this method was demonstrated in details but also its simplicity and effectiveness were proved by comparing with the compartment model method and deconvolution method. It showed to be a powerful tool for IVIVC research.\n\nImpact of microparticle formulation approaches on drug burst release: a level A IVIVC.\n\nPubMed\n\nIshak, Rania A H; Mortada, Nahed D; Zaki, Noha M; El-Shamy, Abd El-Hamid A; Awad, Gehanne A S\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTo study the effect of poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles (MPs) preparation techniques on particle physical characterization with special emphasis on burst drug release. A basic drug clozapine was used in combination with acid-terminated PLGA. Two approaches for MP preparation were compared; the in situ forming microparticle (ISM) and the emulsion-solvent evaporation (ESE) methods using an experimental design. The MPs obtained were compared according to their physical characterization, burst release and T80%. An in vivo pharmacokinetic study with in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) was also performed for the selected formula. Both methods were able to sustain drug release for three weeks. ISM produced more porous particles and was not effective as ESE for controlling burst release. A good IVIVC (R(2) = 0.9755) was attained when injecting the selected formula into rats. MPs prepared with ESE showed a minimum burst release and a level A IVIVC was obtained when administered to rats.\n\nIn vitro-in vivo correlation for nevirapine extended release tablets.\n\nPubMed\n\nMacha, Sreeraj; Yong, Chan-Loi; Darrington, Todd; Davis, Mark S; MacGregor, Thomas R; Castles, Mark; Krill, Steven L\n\n2009-12-01\n\nAn in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) for four nevirapine extended release tablets with varying polymer contents was developed. The pharmacokinetics of extended release formulations were assessed in a parallel group study with healthy volunteers and compared with corresponding in vitro dissolution data obtained using a USP apparatus type 1. In vitro samples were analysed using HPLC with UV detection and in vivo samples were analysed using a HPLC-MS/MS assay; the IVIVC analyses comparing the two results were performed using WinNonlin. A Double Weibull model optimally fits the in vitro data. A unit impulse response (UIR) was assessed using the fastest ER formulation as a reference. The deconvolution of the in vivo concentration time data was performed using the UIR to estimate an in vivo drug release profile. A linear model with a time-scaling factor clarified the relationship between in vitro and in vivo data. The predictability of the final model was consistent based on internal validation. Average percent prediction errors for pharmacokinetic parameters were <10% and individual values for all formulations were <15%. Therefore, a Level A IVIVC was developed and validated for nevirapine extended release formulations providing robust predictions of in vivo profiles based on in vitro dissolution profiles.

Three prototype ER formulations of potassium chloride with different in vitro release rates were developed and their urinary pharmacokinetic profiles were evaluated in healthy subjects. A mathematical model between in vitro dissolution and in vivo urinary excretion, a surrogate for measuring in vivo absorption, was developed using time-scale and time-shift parameters. The IVIVC model was then validated based on internal and external predictability. With the established IVIVC model, there was a good correlation between the observed fraction of dose excreted in urine and the time-scaled and time-shifted fraction of the drug dissolved, and between the in vitro dissolution time and the in vivo urinary excretion time for the ER formulations. The percent prediction error (%PE) on cumulative urinary excretion over the 24Â h interval (A e0-24h ) and maximum urinary excretion rate (R max ) was less than 15% for the individual formulations and less than 10% for the average of the two formulations used to develop the model. Further, the %PE values using external predictability were below 10%. A novel Level A IVIVC was successfully developed and validated for the new potassium chloride ER formulations using urinary pharmacokinetic data. This successful IVIVC may facilitate future development or manufacturing changes to the potassium chloride ER formulation.\n\nAn Accelerated Release Method of Risperidone Loaded PLGA Microspheres with Good IVIVC.\n\nPubMed\n\nHu, Xiaoqin; Zhang, Jianwei; Tang, Xuemei; Li, Mingyuan; Ma, Siyu; Liu, Cheng; Gao, Yue; Zhang, Yue; Liu, Yan; Yu, Fanglin; Yang, Yang; Guo, Jia; Li, Zhiping; Mei, Xingguo\n\n2018-01-01\n\nA long release period lasting several days or several weeks is always needed and thereby it is tedious and time consuming to screen formulations of such microspheres with so long release period and evaluate their release profiles in vitro with conventional long-term or \"real-time\" release method. So, an accelerated release testing of such system is necessary for formulation design as well as quality control purpose. The purpose of this study is to obtain an accelerated release method of risperidone loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres with good in vitro/in vivo correlation (IVIVC). Two formulations of risperidone loaded PLGA microspheres used for evaluating IVIVC were prepared by O/W method. The accelerated release condition was optimized by investigating the effect of pH, osmotic pressure, temperature and ethanol concentration on the release of risperidone from microspheres and the in vitro accelerated release profiles of risperidone from PLGA microspheres were obtained under this optimized accelerated release condition. The plasma concentration of risperidone were also detected after subcutaneous injection of risperidone loaded microspheres to rats. The in vivo cumulative absorption profiles were then calculated using Wagner-Nelson model, Loo- Riegelman model and numerical convolution model, respectively. The correlation between in vitro accelerated release and in vivo cumulative absorption were finally evaluated with Least Square Method. It was shown that temperature and ethanol concentration significantly affected the release of risperidone from the microspheres while pH and osmotic pressure of release media slightly affected the release behavior of risperidone. The in vitro release of risperidone from microspheres were finally undergone in PBS (pH7.0, 300mosm) with 20% (V/V) ethanol at 45Â°C. The sustained and complete release of risperidone was observed in both formulations under the accelerated release condition although these two release\n\nA survey on IVIVC/IVIVR development in the pharmaceutical industry - Past experience and current perspectives.\n\nPubMed\n\nNguyen, M A; Flanagan, T; Brewster, M; Kesisoglou, F; Beato, S; Biewenga, J; Crison, J; Holm, R; Li, R; Mannaert, E; McAllister, M; Mueller-Zsigmondy, M; Muenster, U; Ojala, K; Page, S; Parr, A; Rossenu, S; Timmins, P; Van Peer, A; Vermeulen, A; Langguth, P\n\n2017-05-01\n\nThe present work aimed to describe the current status of IVIVC/IVIVR development in the pharmaceutical industry, focusing on the use and perception of specific approaches as well as successful and failed case studies. Two questionnaires have been distributed to 13 EFPIA partners of the Oral Biopharmaceutics Tools Initiative and to the Pharmacokinetics Working Party of the European Medicines Agency in order to capture the perspectives and experiences of industry scientists and agency members, respectively. Responses from ten companies and three European Agencies were received between May 21st 2014 and January 19th 2016. The majority of the companies acknowledged the importance of IVIVC/IVIVR throughout the drug development stages and a well-balanced rate of return on investment. However, the IVIVC/IVIVR approach seemed to be underutilized in regulatory submissions. Four of the ten companies stated to have an internal guidance related to IVIVC/IVIVR modelling, whereas three felt that an overall strategy is not necessary. Successful models mainly served to support formulation development and to provide a better mechanistic understanding. There was not yet much experience with safe-space IVIVRs as well as the use of physiologically based modelling in the field of IVIVC. At the same time, the responses from both industry and agencies indicated that there might be a need for a regulatory framework to guide the application of these novel approaches. The relevance of IVIVC/IVIVR for oral IR drug products was recognized by most of the companies. For IR formulations, relationships other than Level A correlation were more common outcomes among the provided case studies, such as multiple Level C correlation or safe-space IVIVR, which could be successfully used for requesting regulatory flexibility. Compared to the responses from industry scientists, there was a trend towards a higher appreciation of the BCS among the regulators, but a less positive attitude towards the utility\n\nApplication of an NLME-Stochastic Deconvolution Approach to Level A IVIVC Modeling.\n\nPubMed\n\nKakhi, Maziar; Suarez-Sharp, Sandra; Shepard, Terry; Chittenden, Jason\n\n2017-07-01\n\nStochastic deconvolution is a parameter estimation method that calculates drug absorption using a nonlinear mixed-effects model in which the random effects associated with absorption represent a Wiener process. The present work compares (1) stochastic deconvolution and (2) numerical deconvolution, using clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) data generated for an inÂ vitro-inÂ vivo correlation (IVIVC) study of extended release (ER) formulations of a Biopharmaceutics Classification System class III drug substance. The preliminary analysis found that numerical and stochastic deconvolution yielded superimposable fraction absorbed (F abs ) versus time profiles when supplied with exactly the same externally determined unit impulse response parameters. In a separate analysis, a full population-PK/stochastic deconvolution was applied to the clinical PK data. Scenarios were considered in which immediate release (IR) data were either retained or excluded to inform parameter estimation. The resulting F abs profiles were then used to model level A IVIVCs. All the considered stochastic deconvolution scenarios, and numerical deconvolution, yielded on average similar results with respect to the IVIVC validation. These results could be achieved with stochastic deconvolution without recourse to IR data. Unlike numerical deconvolution, this also implies that in crossover studies where certain individuals do not receive an IR treatment, their ER data alone can still be included as part of the IVIVC analysis.

Previously, a Level A correlation has been established and validated for polymeric microspheres containing risperidone (a practically water insoluble small molecule drug). The objectives of the present study were: 1) to investigate whether a Level A IVIVC can be established for polymeric microspheres containing another small molecule drug with different solubility profiles compared to risperidone; and 2) to determine whether release characteristic differences (bi-phasic vs tri-phasic) between microspheres can affect the development and predictability of IVIVCs. Naltrexone was chosen as the model drug. Three compositionally equivalent formulations of naltrexone microspheres with different release characteristics were prepared using different manufacturing processes. The critical physicochemical properties (such as drug loading, particle size, porosity, and morphology) as well as the in vitro release characteristics of the prepared naltrexone microspheres and the reference-listed drug (VivitrolÂ®) were determined. The pharmacokinetics of the naltrexone microspheres were investigated using a rabbit model. The obtained pharmacokinetic profiles were deconvoluted using the Loo-Riegelman method, and compared with the in vitro release profiles of the naltrexone microspheres obtained using USP apparatus 4. Level A IVIVCs were established and validated for predictability. The results demonstrated that the developed USP 4 method was capable of detecting manufacturing process related performance changes, and most importantly, predicting the in vivo performance of naltrexone microspheres in the investigated animal model.

The extended-release quetiapine formulation is intended to be administered as an once-daily dosing. The development of an in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) and the use of in vitro data to predict in vivo bioavailability parameters has been of great interest for the rational development and evaluation process for extended release dosage forms. The aim of this study was to develop an IVIVC for quetiapine extended release formulation. In vitro dissolution rate data were obtained using USP apparatus 2 at 50ârpm, in 3 bio-relevant dissolution media with different pH values (1.2, 4.5 and 6.8). The drug release profiles of the 2 extended release dosage forms were compared using the similarity factor (f 2). The relative bioavailability of quetiapine was evaluated by a single-dose, randomized-sequence, open-label, 2 period cross over study with 16âhealthy volunteers. A linear level A IVIVC model was established using percentage of absorbed and dissolved data obtained at pH 1.2. The developed IVIVC model was employed to predict quetiapine concentration-time profiles, as well as the bioequivalence parameters for test formulation. Percent prediction errors were estimated for Cmax and AUC to evaluate the validity of the correlation. The values did not exceed 15%, proving the predictability of the correlation model. In conclusion, the established level A IVIVC model proved to be an excellent tool for predicting the rate and extent of quetiapine absorption as characterized by Cmax and AUC for test formulation.

The objective of the present study was to develop an IVIVC approach based on population pharmacokinetic (POP-PK) modeling that incorporated physiologically relevant absorption kinetics. To prepare three extended release (ER) tablets of loxoprofen, three types of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC 100, 4000, and 15000 cps) were used as drug release modifiers, while lactose and magnesium stearate were used as the diluent and lubricant, respectively. An in vitro dissolution test in various pH conditions showed that loxoprofen dissolution was faster at higher pH. The in vivo pharmacokinetics of loxoprofen was assessed following oral administration of the different loxoprofen formulations to Beagle dogs (n = 22 in total). Secondary peaks or shoulders were observed in many of the individual plasma concentration vs time profiles after ER tablet administration, which may result from secondary absorption in the intestine due to a dissolution rate increase under intestinal pH compared to that observed at stomach pH. In addition, in vivo oral bioavailability was found to decrease with prolonged drug dissolution, indicating site-specific absorption. Based on the in vitro dissolution and in vivo absorption data, a POP-PK IVIVC model was developed using S-ADAPT software. pH-dependent biphasic dissolution kinetics, described using modified Michaelis-Menten kinetics with varying V max , and site-specific absorption, modeled using a changeable absorbed fraction parameter, were applied to the POP-PK IVIVC model. To experimentally determine the biphasic dissolution profiles of the ER tablets, another in vitro dissolution test was conducted by switching dissolution medium pH based on an in vivo estimate of gastric emptying time. The model estimated, using linear regression, that in vivo initial maximum dissolution rate (V max (0) inÂ vivo ) was highly correlated (r\n\nIn vitro-in vivo correlation strategy applied to an immediate-release solid oral dosage form with a biopharmaceutical classification system IV compound case study.\n\nPubMed\n\nBredael, Gerard M; Bowers, Niya; Boulineau, Fabien; Hahn, David\n\n2014-07-01\n\nThe ability to predict in vivo response of an oral dosage form based on an in vitro technique has been a sought after goal of the pharmaceutical scientist. Dissolution testing that demonstrates discrimination to various critical formulations or process attributes provides a sensitive quality check that may be representative or may be overpredictive of potential in vivo changes. Dissolution methodology with an established in vitro-in vivo relationship or correlation may provide the desired in vivo predictability. To establish this in vitro-in vivo link, a clinical study must be performed. In this article, recommendations are given in the selection of batches for the clinical study followed by potential outcome scenarios. The investigation of a Level C in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC), which is the most common correlation for immediate-release oral dosage forms, is presented. Lastly, an IVIVC case study involving a biopharmaceutical classification system class IV compound is presented encompassing this strategy and techniques.

Three analgesic drugs were used as model compounds, and simulations of in vivo pharmacokinetic profiles were conducted using different release rates of the ER component and various IR percentages. Plasma concentration-time profiles exhibiting a wide range of tmax and maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) were obtained from superposition of the simulated IR and ER profiles based on a linear IVIVC. It was found that depending on the drug and dosage form design, direct use of the superposed IR and ER data for IVIVC modeling and prediction may (1) be acceptable within errors, (2) become unreliable and less meaningful because of the confounding effect from the non-negligible IR contribution to Cmax, or (3) be meaningless because of the insensitivity of Cmax to release rate change of the ER component. Therefore, understanding the drug, design and drug release characteristics of the product is essential for assessing the validity, accuracy, and reliability of IVIVC of complex MR products obtained via directly modeling of in vivo data.

The in vitro determined drug solubility and permeability data were related to the C(max) values observed from two in vivo human studies. Solubility and permeation studies of fenofibrate were conducted in medium simulating the fasted state conditions in the upper jejunum, containing the surfactant compositions of the six formulations at different concentrations. The behavior of all surfactant compositions was characterized by surface tension, dynamic light scattering, and cryo-TEM. The obtained solubility and permeation data were combined and compared with the C(max) values for the fenofibrate formulations, assuming a 50 mL in vivo dissolution volume. A good IVIVC was observed for five fenofibrate formulations (R(2) = 0.94). The in vitro studies revealed that the formulation compositions containing sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) interfered with the vesicular drug solubilizing system of the biorelevant medium and antagonized its solubilization capacity. The opposing interaction of surfactants with the emulsifying physiological constituents in intestinal juice should be taken into consideration in order to prevent unsatisfactory in vivo performance of orally administered formulations with low soluble active pharmaceutical ingredients.\n\nDevelopment of in vitro-in vivo correlation for extended-release niacin after administration of hypromellose-based matrix formulations to healthy volunteers.\n\nPubMed\n\nKesisoglou, Filippos; Rossenu, Stefaan; Farrell, Colm; Van Den Heuvel, Michiel; Prohn, Marita; Fitzpatrick, Shaun; De Kam, Pieter-Jan; Vargo, Ryan\n\n2014-11-01\n\nDevelopment of in vitro-in vivo correlations (IVIVCs) for extended-release (ER) products is commonly pursued during pharmaceutical development to increase product understanding, set release specifications, and support biowaivers. This manuscript details the development of Level C and Level A IVIVCs for ER formulations of niacin, a highly variable and extensively metabolized compound. Three ER formulations were screened in a cross-over study against immediate-release niacin. A Multiple Level C IVIVC was established for both niacin and its primary metabolite nicotinuric acid (NUA) as well as total niacin metabolites urinary excretion. For NUA, but not for niacin, Level A IVIVC models with acceptable prediction errors were achievable via a modified IVIVC rather than a traditional deconvolution/convolution approach. Hence, this is in contradiction with current regulatory guidelines that suggest that when a Multiple Level C IVIVC is established, Level A models should also be readily achievable. We demonstrate that for a highly variable, highly metabolized compound such as niacin, development of a Level A IVIVC model fully validated according to agency guidelines may be challenging. However, Multiple Level C models are achievable and could be used to guide release specifications and formulation/manufacturing changes.

The effect of polymeric blends of ethylcellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, xanthan gum, guar gum, Starch 1500, and lactose on in vitro release profiles was studied and fitted to various release kinetics models. Water uptake kinetics with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out to support the drug release mechanism. An IVIVC was established by comparing the pharmacokinetic parameters of optimized (M-24) and marketed (Glytop-2.5 SR) formulations after single oral dose studies on white albino rabbits. The matrix M-19 (xanthan:MCC PH301 at 70:40) and M-24 (xanthan:HPMC K4M:Starch 1500 at 70:25:15) showed the glipizide release within the predetermined constraints at all time points with Korsmeyer-Peppas' and zero-order release mechanism, respectively. Kopcha model revealed that the xanthan gum is the major excipient responsible for the diffusional release profile and was further supported by SEM and swelling studies. A significant level A IVIVC with acceptable limits of prediction errors (below 15%) enables the prediction of in vivo performance from their in vitro release profile. It was concluded that proper selection of rate-controlling polymers with release rate modifier excipients will determine overall release profile, duration and mechanism from directly compressed matrices.\n\nHandling of computational in vitro/in vivo correlation problems by Microsoft Excel II.

The discussion includes moments (AUC and mean) as summarizing statistics, and data-fitting algorithms for parameter estimation.\n\nPharmacokinetics and correlation between in vitro release and in vivo absorption of bio-adhesive pellets of panax notoginseng saponins.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Ying; Zhang, Yun; Zhu, Chun-Yan\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThe present study was designed to prepare and compare bio-adhesive pellets of panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) with hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), chitosan, and chitosan : carbomer, explore the influence of different bio-adhesive materials on pharmacokinetics behaviors of PNSbio-adhesive pellets, and evaluate the correlation between in vivo absorption and in vitro release (IVIVC). In order to predict the in vivo concentration-time profile by the in vitro release data of bio-adhesive pellets, the release experiment was performed using the rotating basket method in pH 6.8 phosphate buffer. The PNS concentrations in rat plasma were analyzed by HPLC-MS-MS method and the relative bioavailability and other pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using Kinetica4.4 pharmacokinetic software. Numerical deconvolution method was used to evaluate IVIVC. Our results indicated that, compared with ordinary pellets, PNS bio-adhesive pellets showed increased oral bioavailability by 1.45 to 3.20 times, increased C max , and extended MRT. What's more, the release behavior of drug in HPMC pellets was shown to follow a Fickian diffusion mechanism, a synergetic function of diffusion and skeleton corrosion. The in vitro release and the in vivo biological activity had a good correlation, demonstrating that the PNS bio-adhesive pellets had a better sustained release. Numerical deconvolution technique showed the advantage in evaluation of IVIVC for self-designed bio-adhesive pellets with HPMC. In conclusion, the in vitro release data of bio-adhesive pellets with HPMC can predict its concentration-time profile in vivo. Copyright Â© 2017 China Pharmaceutical University.

The traditional IVIVC model building process consists of 5 steps: deconvolution, model fitting, convolution, prediction error evaluation, and cross-validation. This is a time-consuming process and typically a few models at most are tested for any given data set. The objectives of this work were to (1) propose a statistical tool to screen models for further development of an IVIVC, (2) evaluate the performance of each model under different circumstances, and (3) investigate the effectiveness of common statistical model selection criteria for choosing IVIVC models. A computer program was developed to explore which model(s) would be most likely to work well with a random variation from the original formulation. The process used Monte Carlo simulation techniques to build IVIVC models. Data-based model selection criteria (Akaike Information Criteria [AIC], R2) and the probability of passing the Food and Drug Administration \"prediction error\" requirement was calculated. To illustrate this approach, several real data sets representing a broad range of release profiles are used to illustrate the process and to demonstrate the advantages of this automated process over the traditional approach. The Hixson-Crowell and Weibull models were often preferred over the linear. When evaluating whether a Level A IVIVC model was possible, the model selection criteria AIC generally selected the best model. We believe that the approach we proposed may be a rapid tool to determine which IVIVC model (if any) is the most applicable.\n\nIn Vitro-In Vivo Relationship of Amorphous Insoluble API (Progesterone) in PLGA Microspheres.\n\nPubMed\n\nPu, Chenguang; Wang, Qiao; Zhang, Hongjuan; Gou, Jingxin; Guo, Yuting; Tan, Xinyi; Xie, Bin; Yin, Na; He, Haibing; Zhang, Yu; Wang, Yanjiao; Yin, Tian; Tang, Xing\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe mechanism of PRG release from PLGA microspheres was studied and the correlation of in vitro and in vivo analyses was assessed. PRG-loaded microspheres were prepared by the emulsion-evaporate method. The physical state of PRG and microstructure changings during the drug release period were evaluated by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) respectively. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed in male Sprague-Dawley rats, and the in vivo-in vitro correlation (IVIVC) was established by linear fitting of the cumulative release (%) in vitro and fraction of absorption (%) in vivo. PXRD results indicated recrystallization of PRG during release. The changes of microstructure of PRG-loaded microspheres during the release period could be observed in SEM micrographs. Pharmacokinetics results performed low burst-release followed a steady-released manner. The IVIVC assessment exhibited a good correlation between vitro and in vivo. The burst release phase was caused by diffusion of amorphous PRG near the surface, while the second release stage was impacted by PRG-dissolution from crystal depots formed in microspheres. The IVIVC assessment suggests that the in vitro test method used in this study could predict the real situation in vivo and is helpful to study the release mechanism in vivo.\n\nDevelopment of In Vitro-In Vivo Correlation for Amorphous Solid Dispersion Immediate-Release Suvorexant Tablets and Application to Clinically Relevant Dissolution Specifications and In-Process Controls.\n\nPubMed\n\nKesisoglou, Filippos; Hermans, Andre; Neu, Colleen; Yee, Ka Lai; Palcza, John; Miller, Jessica\n\n2015-09-01\n\nAlthough in vitro-in vivo correlations (IVIVCs) are commonly pursued for modified-release products, there are limited reports of successful IVIVCs for immediate-release (IR) formulations. This manuscript details the development of a Multiple Level C IVIVC for the amorphous solid dispersion formulation of suvorexant, a BCS class II compound, and its application to establishing dissolution specifications and in-process controls. Four different 40 mg batches were manufactured at different tablet hardnesses to produce distinct dissolution profiles. These batches were evaluated in a relative bioavailability clinical study in healthy volunteers. Although no differences were observed for the total exposure (AUC) of the different batches, a clear relationship between dissolution and Cmax was observed. A validated Multiple Level C IVIVC against Cmax was developed for the 10, 15, 20, 30, and 45 min dissolution time points and the tablet disintegration time. The relationship established between tablet tensile strength and dissolution was subsequently used to inform suitable tablet hardness ranges within acceptable Cmax limits. This is the first published report for a validated Multiple Level C IVIVC for an IR solid dispersion formulation demonstrating how this approach can facilitate Quality by Design in formulation development and help toward clinically relevant specifications and in-process controls.

It is a complex process that (i) incorporates in a gradual and incremental way a large amount of information and (ii) requires information from different properties (formulation, analytical, clinical) and associated dedicated treatments (statistics, modeling, simulation). These results in many studies that are initiated and integrated into the specifications (quality target product profile, QTPP). This latter defines the appropriate experimental designs (quality by design, QbD) (Food and Drug Administration 2011, 2012) whose main objectives are determination (i) of key factors of development and manufacturing (critical process parameters, CPPs) and (ii) of critical points of physicochemical nature relating to active ingredients (API) and critical quality attribute (CQA) which may have implications in terms of efficiency, safety, and inoffensiveness for the patient, due to their non-inclusion. These processes generate a very large amount of data that is necessary to structure. In this context, the storage of information in a database (DB) and the management of this database (database management system, DBMS) become an important issue for the management of projects and IVIVC and more generally for development of new pharmaceutical forms. This article describes the implementation of a prototype object-oriented database (OODB) considered as a tool, which is helpful for decision taking, responding in a structured and consistent way to the issues of project management of IVIVC (including bioequivalence and bioavailability) (Food and Drug Administration 2003) necessary for the implementation of QTPP.\n\nAqueous Polymer Dispersion Coating Used for Osmotic Pump Tablets: Membrane Property Investigation and IVIVC Evaluation.\n\nPubMed\n\nCheng, Lizhen; Gai, Xiumei; Wen, Haoyang; Liu, Dandan; Tang, Xin; Wang, Yanyan; Wang, Tuanjie; Pan, Weisan; Yang, Xinggang\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to investigate the fundamental properties of propranolol hydrochloride osmotic pump tablets coated by aqueous polymer dispersion, simultaneously exploring the in vitro and in vivo correlation of the tablet. The physicochemical properties and parameters of aqueous polymer dispersion membranes (SEM, water uptake, and water vapor transmission coefficient) were investigated. In addition, the release behavior and the in vitro release and in vivo absorption profiles of the tablets coated by aqueous polymer dispersion were investigated by comparing with propranolol hydrochloride osmotic pump tablets coated by an organic solvent. Results showed that the similarity factor (f 2 ) between cellulose acetate-coated tablet and Eudragit-coated tablet was 78.1, and f 2 between cellulose acetate-coated tablet and Kollicoat-coated tablet was 77.6. The linear IVIVC of Eudragit-coated and Kollicoat-coated osmotic pump tablets was determined, which confirmed excellent correlation between the absorption in vivo and the drug release in vitro. Consequently, the membrane coated by aqueous polymer dispersion or organic solvent has similar in vitro release rates of controlled release. Also, compared with organic solvent coating, aqueous polymer dispersion has numerous advantages, such as reduced toxicity and no environmental damage. Therefore, the aqueous polymer dispersion technology has enormous potential as a replacement of organic solvent coating.\n\nExtended release dosage form of glipizide: development and validation of a level A in vitro-in vivo correlation.\n\nPubMed\n\nGhosh, Animesh; Bhaumik, Uttam Kumar; Bose, Anirbandeep; Mandal, Uttam; Gowda, Veeran; Chatterjee, Bappaditya; Chakrabarty, Uday Sankar; Pal, Tapan Kumar\n\n2008-10-01\n\nDefining a quantitative and reliable relationship between in vitro drug release and in vivo absorption is highly desired for rational development, optimization, and evaluation of controlled-release dosage forms and manufacturing process. During the development of once daily extended-release (ER) tablet of glipizide, a predictive in vitro drug release method was designed and statistically evaluated using three formulations with varying release rates. In order to establish internally and externally validated level A in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC), a total of three different ER formulations of glipizide were used to evaluate a linear IVIVC model based on the in vitro test method. For internal validation, a single-dose four-way cross over study (n=6) was performed using fast-, moderate-, and slow-releasing ER formulations and an immediate-release (IR) of glipizide as reference. In vitro release rate data were obtained for each formulation using the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) apparatus II, paddle stirrer at 50 and 100 rev. min(-1) in 0.1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) and pH 6.8 phosphate buffer. The f(2) metric (similarity factor) was used to analyze the dissolution data. The formulations were compared using area under the plasma concentration-time curve, AUC(0-infinity), time to reach peak plasma concentration, T(max), and peak plasma concentration, C(max), while correlation was determined between in vitro release and in vivo absorption. A linear correlation model was developed using percent absorbed data versus percent dissolved from the three formulations. Predicted glipizide concentrations were obtained by convolution of the in vivo absorption rates. Prediction errors were estimated for C(max) and AUC(0-infinity) to determine the validity of the correlation. Apparatus II, pH 6.8 at 100 rev. min(-1) was found to be the most discriminating dissolution method.

Such a model would be of substantial aid in the early stages of development of a pharmaceutical formulation, when no in vivo results are yet available and it is impossible to create a classical in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC)/IVIVR. Methods Chemoinformatics software was used to compute the molecular descriptors of drug substances (ie, active pharmaceutical ingredients) and excipients. The data were collected from the literature. Artificial neural networks were used as the modeling tool. The training process was carried out using the 10-fold cross-validation technique. Results The database contained 93 formulations with 307 inputs initially, and was later limited to 28 in a course of sensitivity analysis. The four best models were introduced into the artificial neural network ensemble. Complete in vivo profiles were predicted accurately for 37.6% of the formulations. Conclusion It has been shown that artificial neural networks can be an effective predictive tool for constructing IVIVR in an integrated generalized model for various formulations. Because IVIVC/IVIVR is classically conducted for 2â4 formulations and with a single active pharmaceutical ingredient, the approach described here is unique in that it incorporates various active pharmaceutical ingredients and dosage forms into a single model. Thus, preliminary IVIVC/IVIVR can be available without in vivo data, which is impossible using current IVIVC/IVIVR procedures.

Artemisinin based combination therapy (ACT) has been proposed as a promising treatment for malaria, and artemetherâ¯+â¯lumefantrine (20â¯+â¯120â¯mg) is the recommended association in endemic areas. Despite its widespread use, there is still scarce information about dissolution of artemether and lumefantrine, reflecting in the absence of a specific method in pharmacopoeias and international compendia. Because the of their low solubility, both artemether and lumefantrine are candidates for in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) studies. Previous equilibrium solubility studies have been carried out for both drugs using the shake-flask method and dissolution profiles. Experiments were conducted with a range of parameters such as medium composition, pH and surfactants. In vivo data obtained in a previous pharmacokinetic study was used to select the optimum conditions for dissolution test, based on IVIVC. For drug quantitation, a selective method by high performance liquid chromatography was optimized and validated. For this dosage form, the best dissolution conditions found for artemether were: paddles, 900â¯mL of dissolution medium containing phosphate buffer pH 6.8 with 1.0% sodium lauryl sulfate and rotation speed of 100â¯rpm. The same was obtained for lumefantrine, except the dissolution medium, which was pH 1.2 with 1.0% polysorbate 80. After obtaining the curve of in vitro dissolved fraction versus in vivo absorbed fraction, the calculated coefficient of determination (R squared) was close to 1.00 for both drugs, indicating a level A correlation. Therefore, a novel method for assessing dissolution of arthemeter and lumefantrine tablets was established and validated. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The formulations included were TramazacÂ® (Ml, conventional tablet) and TRD CONTINÂ® (M2, sustained release tablet), and a new controlled release tablet prepared on the basis of osmotic technology (formulation IVB). To develop level A IVIVC, in vivo data were deconvoluted into absorption data by using Wagner-Nelson equation. The absorption data (percent drug absorbed) was plotted against percent drug dissolved keeping the former along x-axis and the later along y-axis. The highest determination coefficient (RÂ² = 0.9278) of the level A IVIVC was observed for formulation MI, and then for M2 (RÂ² = 0.9046) and IVB (RÂ² = 0.8796). Additionally, plasma drug levels were approximated from in vitio dissolution data using convolution approach to calculate the prediction error (%), which was found to be < 10%.\n\nDefining level A IVIVC dissolution specifications based on individual in vitro dissolution profiles of a controlled release formulation.\n\nPubMed\n\nGonzÃ¡lez-GarcÃ­a, I; GarcÃ­a-Arieta, A; Merino-Sanjuan, M; Mangas-Sanjuan, V; Bermejo, M\n\n2018-07-01\n\nRegulatory guidelines recommend that, when a level A IVIVC is established, dissolution specification should be established using averaged data and the maximum difference between AUC and C max between the reference and test formulations cannot be greater than 20%. However, averaging data assumes a loss of information and may reflect a bias in the results. The objective of the current work is to present a new approach to establish dissolution specifications using a new methodology (individual approach) instead of average data (classical approach). Different scenarios were established based on the relationship between in vitro-in vivo dissolution rate coefficient using a level A IVIVC of a controlled release formulation. Then, in order to compare this new approach with the classical one, six additional batches were simulated. For each batch, 1000 simulations of a dissolution assay were run. C max ratios between the reference formulation and each batch were calculated showing that the individual approach was more sensitive and able to detect differences between the reference and the batch formulation compared to the classical approach. Additionally, the new methodology displays wider dissolution specification limits than the classical approach, ensuring that any tablet from the new batch would generate in vivo profiles which its AUC or C max ratio will be out of the 0.8-1.25 range, taking into account the in vitro and in vivo variability of the new batches developed.

In vitro-in vivo correlations (IVIVC) were examined to determine the best model membrane. In vitro permeation studies across different synthetic membranes and skin were performed for the Exelon(Â®) Patch (which contains RV), and the results were compared. Deconvolution of bioavailability data using the Wagner-Nelson method enabled the fraction of RV absorbed to be determined and a point-to-point IVIVC to be established. The synthetic membrane, Strat-Mâ¢, showed a RV permeation profile similar to that obtained with pig ear skin (R(2)=0.920). Studies with Strat-Mâ¢ resulted in a good and linear IVIVC (R(2)=0.991) when compared with other synthetic membranes that showed R(2) values less than 0.90. The R(2) for pig ear skin was 0.982. Strat-Mâ¢ membrane was the only synthetic membrane that adequately simulated skin barrier performance and therefore it can be considered to be a suitable alternative to human or animal skin in evaluating transdermal drug transport, potentially reducing the number of studies requiring human or animal samples.

The model for immediate release dosage form containing amoxicillin was used in the presented study to check if the calculation method of absorption profiles can influence final results achieved. The comparison showed that an averaging of individual absorption profiles performed by Wagner-Nelson (WN) conversion method can lead to lose the discrimination properties of the model. The approach considering individual plasma concentration versus time profiles enabled to average absorption profiles prior WN conversion. In turn, that enabled to find differences between dispersible tablets and capsules. It was concluded that in the case of immediate release dosage form, the decision to use averaging method should be based on an individual situation; however, it seems that the influence of such a procedure on the discrimination properties of the model is then more significant.

Correlation was validated with a third test formulation, Y1. Experimental solubility and permeability data were obtained to confirm that telmisartan is a class II compound under the Biopharmaceutic Classification System. Bioequivalence (BE) studies plasma profiles were combined using a previously published reference scaling procedure. X2 demonstrated in vivo BE, while X1 and Y1 failed to show BE due to the lower boundary of the 90% confidence interval for C max being outside the acceptance limits. Average plasma profiles were deconvoluted by the Loo-Riegelman method to obtain the oral fractions absorbed ( f a ). Fractions dissolved ( f diss ) were obtained in several conditions in USP II and USP IV apparatus, and later, the results were compared in order to find the most biopredictive model, calculating the f 2 similarity factor. The apparatus and conditions showing the same rank order than in vivo data were selected for further refinement of conditions. A Levy plot was constructed to estimate the time scaling factor and to make both processes, dissolution and absorption, superimposable. The in vitro dissolution experiment that reflected more accurately the in vivo behavior of the different formulations of telmisartan employed the USP IV dissolution apparatus and a dissolution environment with a flow rate of 8 mL/min and a three-step pH change, from 1.2 to 4.5 and 6.8, with a 0.05% of Tween 80. Thus, these conditions gave rise to a biopredictive dissolution test. This new model is able to predict the formulation differences in dissolution that were previously observed in vivo, which could be used as a risk-analysis tool for formulation selection in future bioequivalence trials.\n\nBiowaiver extension potential and IVIVC for BCS Class II drugs by formulation design: Case study for cyclosporine self-microemulsifying formulation.\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, Su-Geun\n\n2010-11-01\n\nThe objective of this work was to suggest the biowaiver potential of biopharmaceutical classification system (BCS) Class II drugs in self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems (SMEDDS) which are known to increase the solubility, dissolution and oral absorption of water-insoluble drugs. Cyclosporine was selected as a representative BCS Class II drug. New generic candidate of cyclosporine SMEDDS (test) was applied for the study with brand SMEDDS (reference I) and cyclosporine self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS, reference II). Solubility and dissolution of cyclosporine from SMEDDS were critically enhanced, which were the similar behaviors with BCS class I drug. The test showed the identical dissolution rate and the equivalent bioavailability (0.34, 0.42 and 0.68 of p values for AUCâ(â)ââ(h), C(max) and T(max), respectively) with the reference I. Based on the results, level A in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) was established from these two SMEDDS formulations. This study serves as a good example for speculating the biowaiver extension potential of BCS Class II drugs specifically in solubilizing formulation such as SMEDDS.\n\nStudy on the release of fenofibrate nanosuspension in vitro and its correlation with in situ intestinal and in vivo absorption kinetics in rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Yuanlong; Wang, Yonglu; Li, Xue Ming; Huang, Qinqin; Chen, Wei; Liu, Ran; Chen, BaoAn; Wei, Ping\n\n2014-07-01\n\nAs an oral delivery carrier for poorly water soluble drugs, the nanosuspension was prepared by melt emulsification method combined with high-pressure homogenization. The objective of this study was to clarify the absorption mechanism in rats of fenofibrate nanosuspension using the model of in situ gut perfusion. The release rate of drug from nanosuspension was fast which about 70% of the drug would be released within 5 minutes. The absorption of fenofibrate nanosuspension in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract was studied by the in situ closed loop method in rats. It was found that the absorption process in intestine was first-process with passive diffusion mechanism, and the whole intestine was the major segment for the drug absorption. Additionally, GI absorption in situ studies indicated that the fenofibrate nanosuspension had great success in regard to enhancement of intestinal absorption compared to the fenofibrate suspension of coarse powder. The pharmacokinetic characteristics were studied in rats after oral administration of fenofibrate nanosuspension or suspension at the dosage of 27âmg/kg. The plasma concentration-time curve was fitted to the one-compartment model. The correlation between in vitro dissolution (P), in situ intestinal absorption (F) and in vivo absorption (Fa) in rats was investigated with the results as follows: Faâ=â6.2061P-456.38(râ=â0.9559), Fâ=â3.6911P-2.2169(râ=â0.970), Fâ=â0.5095Pâ+â44.189(râ=â0.9609). The highest level A could be obtained from the in vitro--in vivo correlation (IVIVC) between dissolution percentage and intestinal absorption of the fenofibrate nanosuspension in rats. Consequently, the in situ intestinal perfusion model could be used to predict the in vivo pharmacokinetic characteristics in rats.\n\nIn Vivo Fluorescence Correlation and Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMÃ¼tze, JÃ¶rg; Ohrt, Thomas; PetrÃ¡Å¡ek, ZdenÄk; Schwille, Petra\n\nIn this manuscript, we describe the application of Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS), Fluorescence Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy (FCCS), and scanning FCS (sFCS) to two in vivo systems. In the first part, we describe the application of two-photon standard and scanning FCS in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. The differentiation of a single fertilized egg into a complex organism in C. elegans is regulated by a number of protein-dependent processes. The oocyte divides asymmetrically into two daughter cells of different developmental fate. Two of the involved proteins, PAR-2 and NMY-2, are studied. The second investigated system is the mechanism of RNA interference in human cells. An EGFP based cell line that allows to study the dynamics and localization of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) with FCS in vivo is created, which has so far been inaccessible with other experimental methods. Furthermore, Fluorescence Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy is employed to highlight the asymmetric incorporation of labeled siRNAs into RISC.\n\nIn vivo correlation mapping microscopy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMcGrath, James; Alexandrov, Sergey; Owens, Peter; Subhash, Hrebesh; Leahy, Martin\n\n2016-04-01\n\nTo facilitate regular assessment of the microcirculation in vivo, noninvasive imaging techniques such as nailfold capillaroscopy are required in clinics. Recently, a correlation mapping technique has been applied to optical coherence tomography (OCT), which extends the capabilities of OCT to microcirculation morphology imaging. This technique, known as correlation mapping optical coherence tomography, has been shown to extract parameters, such as capillary density and vessel diameter, and key clinical markers associated with early changes in microvascular diseases. However, OCT has limited spatial resolution in both the transverse and depth directions. Here, we extend this correlation mapping technique to other microscopy modalities, including confocal microscopy, and take advantage of the higher spatial resolution offered by these modalities. The technique is achieved as a processing step on microscopy images and does not require any modification to the microscope hardware. Results are presented which show that this correlation mapping microscopy technique can extend the capabilities of conventional microscopy to enable mapping of vascular networks in vivo with high spatial resolution in both the transverse and depth directions.\n\nPharmacokinetics, brain distribution, release and blood-brain barrier transport of Shunaoxin pills.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, Kai; Wang, Zhan-Zhang; Liu, Dan; Qi, Xian-Rong\n\n2014-02-12\n\nShunaoxin pills, a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) product, have been used to treat cerebrovascular diseases in China since 2005. The main active components of Shunaoxin pills are ferulic acid and ligustilide from Chuanxiong (Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort, Umbelliferae) and Danggui (Angelica sinensis radix, Umbelliferae). As Shunaoxin shows excellent activity in the central nervous system (CNS), the extent to which the major constituents of Shunaoxin reach the CNS should be investigated. Moreover, the in vivo-in vitro correlations (IVIVC) of the formulation should be studied to elucidate the mechanisms of action of TCM in the CNS. However, these data have not previously been available. Thus we intended to investigate what the extent when these constituents of Shunaoxin pills reach the CNS, and evaluate the IVIVC of release and pharmacokinetics. In this study, we evaluated the release of ferulic acid and ligustilide from Shunaoxin pills, and their transport across an in vitro model of the BBB. We also evaluated their pharmacokinetics and brain distribution in vivo. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to quantify both compounds simultaneously. Based on the release in vitro and absorption of ferulic acid and ligustilide in vivo, IVIVC permitted prediction of the pharmacokinetics of these compounds. The release of ferulic acid and ligustilide reached a platform phase within 1h. Ferulic acid and ligustilide rapidly crossed the BBB in different patterns; the transport ratio increased over time. After intragastric (i.g.) administration of Shunaoxin pills, ferulic acid and ligustilide were rapidly absorbed and distributed into brain, which may result in a rapid onset of action. Ferulic acid and ligustilide were transported across a model BBB. After i.g. administration of Shunaoxin pills, ferulic acid and ligustilide were rapidly absorbed and distributed in brain; this may lead to rapid pharmacological onset. The IVIVC can be used to predict in vivo\n\nPrediction of oral disintegration time of fast disintegrating tablets using texture analyzer and computational optimization.\n\nPubMed\n\nSzakonyi, G; ZelkÃ³, R\n\n2013-05-20\n\nOne of the promising approaches to predict in vivo disintegration time of orally disintegrating tablets (ODT) is the use of texture analyzer instrument. Once the method is able to provide good in vitro in vivo correlation (IVIVC) in the case of different tablets, it might be able to predict the oral disintegration time of similar products. However, there are many tablet parameters that influence the in vivo and the in vitro disintegration time of ODT products. Therefore, the measured in vitro and in vivo disintegration times can occasionally differ, even if they coincide in most cases of the investigated products and the in vivo disintegration times may also change if the aimed patient group is suffering from a special illness. If the method is no longer able to provide good IVIVC, then the modification of a single instrumental parameter may not be successful and the in vitro method must be re-set in a complex manner in order to provide satisfactory results. In the present experiment, an optimization process was developed based on texture analysis measurements using five different tablets in order to predict their in vivo disintegration times, and the optimized texture analysis method was evaluated using independent tablets.

A universal dissolution method was employed which simulated the physiology of human gastrointestinal tract, including the precise chyme transit behavior and biorelevant conditions. The multicompartmental dissolution data allowed direct observation and qualitative discrimination of the differences resulting from highly pH dependent dissolution behavior of the tested batches. Further evaluation of results was performed using IVIVC/IVIVR development. While satisfactory correlation could not be achieved using a conventional deconvolution based-model, promising results were obtained through the use of a nonconventional approach exploiting the complex compartmental dissolution data.

Effervescent floating-bioadhesive hydrophilic matrices were prepared and evaluated for in-vitro drug release, floatation and ex-vivo bioadhesive strength. The optimal composition of polymer blends was systematically chosen using central composite design and overlay plots. Pharmacokinetic studies were carried out in rabbits, and various levels of in-vitro/in-vivo correlation (IVIVC) were established. In-vivo gamma scintigraphic studies were performed in human volunteers using (99m) Tc to evaluate formulation retention in the gastric milieu. The optimized formulation exhibited excellent bioadhesive and floatational characteristics besides possessing adequate drug-release control and pharmacokinetic extension of plasma levels. The successful establishment of various levels of IVIVC substantiated the judicious choice of in-vitro dissolution media for simulating the in-vivo conditions. In-vivo gamma scintigraphic studies ratified the gastroretentive characteristics of the optimized formulation with a retention time of 5âh or more. Besides unravelling the polymer synergism, the study helped in developing an optimal once-a-day gastroretentive drug delivery system with improved bioavailability potential exhibiting excellent swelling, floating and bioadhesive characteristics.

In case of functional chewing gums, the mode and the mechanism of release and the site of application differ significantly from other conventional solid oral dosage forms and require a special consideration to extract meaningful information from clinical studies. In the current study, suitable drug release methodology was developed to predict the in vivo performance of an investigated chewing gum product. Different parameters of the drug release testing apparatus described in the Ph. Eur. and Pharmeuropa were evaluated. Drug release data indicate that the parameters, chewing distance, chewing frequency and twisting motion, affect the drug release. Higher drug release was observed when the frequency was changed from 40 chews/min to 60 chews/min for apparatus A and B, as was the case for the twisting motion when changed from 20Âº to 40Âº for apparatus B. As far as the chewing distance is concerned, the release rate was in the following order; apparatus A: 0.3 mm > 0.5 mm > 0.7 mm; apparatus B: 1.4 mm > 1.6 mm > 1.8 mm. A suitable apparatus set-up for in vitro release testing was identified. The method will be useful for the establishment of in vitro in vivo correlations (IVIVC) for medicated chewing gums. Interchangeability of the apparatus for a product is not generally recommended without prior knowledge of the performance of the product, as the construction and principle of operation for the apparatus differ considerably.

However, there are few reported correlations of such in vitro studies with in vivo data. The aim of this study was to investigate the skin permeation of a model active, niacinamide, both in vitro and in vivo. Conventional diffusion cell studies were conducted in human skin to determine niacinamide permeation from a range of vehicles which included dimethyl isosorbide (DMI), propylene glycol (PG), propylene glycol monolaurate (PGML), N-methyl 2-pyrrolidone (NMP), Miglyol 812NÂ® (MG), and mineral oil (MO). Single, binary or ternary systems were examined. The same vehicles were subsequently examined to investigate niacinamide delivery in vivo. For this proof-of-concept study one donor was used for the in vitro studies and one volunteer for the in vivo investigations to minimise biovariability. Analysis of in vitro samples was conducted using HPLC and in vivo uptake of niacinamide was evaluated using Confocal Raman spectroscopy (CRS). The amount of niacinamide permeated through skin in vitro was linearly proportional to the intensity of the niacinamide signal determined in the stratum corneum in vivo. A good correlation was observed between the signal intensities of selected vehicles and niacinamide signal intensity. The findings provide further support for the use of CRS to monitor drug delivery into and across the skin. In addition, the results highlight the critical role of the vehicle and its disposition in skin for effective dermal delivery.\n\nDevelopment and experimental design of a novel controlled-release matrix tablet formulation for indapamide hemihydrate.\n\nPubMed\n\nAntovska, Packa; Ugarkovic, Sonja; PetruÅ¡evski, Gjorgji; Stefanova, Bosilka; Manchevska, Blagica; Petkovska, Rumenka; Makreski, Petre\n\n2017-11-01\n\nDevelopment, experimental design and in vitro in vivo correlation (IVIVC) of controlled-release matrix formulation. Development of novel oral controlled delivery system for indapamide hemihydrate, optimization of the formulation by experimental design and evaluation regarding IVIVC on a pilot scale batch as a confirmation of a well-established formulation. In vitro dissolution profiles of controlled-release tablets of indapamide hemihydrate from four different matrices had been evaluated in comparison to the originator's product Natrilix (Servier) as a direction for further development and optimization of a hydroxyethylcellulose-based matrix controlled-release formulation. A central composite factorial design had been applied for the optimization of a chosen controlled-release tablet formulation. The controlled-release tablets with appropriate physical and technological properties had been obtained with a matrix: binder concentration variations in the range: 20-40w/w% for the matrix and 1-3w/w% for the binder. The experimental design had defined the design space for the formulation and was prerequisite for extraction of a particular formulation that would be a subject for transfer on pilot scale and IVIV correlation. The release model of the optimized formulation has shown best fit to the zero order kinetics depicted with the Hixson-Crowell erosion-dependent mechanism of release. Level A correlation was obtained.\n\nUnderstanding and predicting the impact of critical dissolution variables for nifedipine immediate release capsules by multivariate data analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nMercuri, A; Pagliari, M; Baxevanis, F; Fares, R; Fotaki, N\n\n2017-02-25\n\nIn this study the selection of in vivo predictive in vitro dissolution experimental set-ups using a multivariate analysis approach, in line with the Quality by Design (QbD) principles, is explored. The dissolution variables selected using a design of experiments (DoE) were the dissolution apparatus [USP1 apparatus (basket) and USP2 apparatus (paddle)], the rotational speed of the basket/or paddle, the operator conditions (dissolution apparatus brand and operator), the volume, the pH, and the ethanol content of the dissolution medium. The dissolution profiles of two nifedipine capsules (poorly soluble compound), under conditions mimicking the intake of the capsules with i. water, ii. orange juice and iii. an alcoholic drink (orange juice and ethanol) were analysed using multiple linear regression (MLR). Optimised dissolution set-ups, generated based on the mathematical model obtained via MLR, were used to build predicted in vitro-in vivo correlations (IVIVC). IVIVC could be achieved using physiologically relevant in vitro conditions mimicking the intake of the capsules with an alcoholic drink (orange juice and ethanol). The multivariate analysis revealed that the concentration of ethanol used in the in vitro dissolution experiments (47% v/v) can be lowered to less than 20% v/v, reflecting recently found physiological conditions.

The goal of this study was to prepare a novel porous calcium phosphate microparticle using povidone-mixed micelles as template while evaluating its in vitro and in vivo properties with silybin as a model drug. The particle characterization, in vitro drug release behavior, and pharmacokinetic parameters of the prepared silybin-loaded calcium phosphate microparticle were investigated. The mean particle size was found to be 3.54âÂ±â0.32Â Î¼m with a rough surface porous structure. Additionally, the silybin-loaded calcium phosphate microparticle compared with the free silybin showed a prolonged 72-h release in vitro and a higher C max (418.5âÂ±â23.7Â ngÂ mL(-1)) with 167.5% oral relative bioavailability. A level A in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC), established for the first time, demonstrated an excellent IVIVC of the formulated silybin in oral administration. In conclusion, this povidone-mixed micelle-based microparticle was successfully prepared to enhance the oral bioavailability of silybin. Therefore, application of this novel porous calcium phosphate microparticle holds a significant potential for the development of poorly water-soluble drugs.\n\nCorrelation of histological and ex-vivo confocal tumor thickness in malignant melanoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nHartmann, Daniela; Krammer, Sebastian; Ruini, Cristel; Ruzicka, Thomas; von BraunmÃ¼hl, Tanja\n\n2016-07-01\n\nThe ex-vivo confocal laser scanning microscopy (ex-vivo CLSM) is a novel diagnostic method for fresh tissue examination, which has already shown promising results in the evaluation of healthy skin and different skin tumors. In malignant melanoma, the histological tumor thickness plays an essential role for further treatment strategies. The immediate perioperative measurement of tumor thickness by means of ex-vivo CLSM might accelerate the decision for further operating procedures in malignant melanoma. Ten histologically confirmed malignant melanomas from various donor sites were blindly examined by two investigators via ex-vivo CLSM and conventional light microscopy. The histopathological tumor thickness (HTT) and confocal tumor thickness (CTT) were measured independently and evaluated using correlation curves, Spearman's correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman plots. Bland-Altman plots for HTT and reflectance-mode CTT, as well as for fluorescence-mode CTT, showed high correlations. Spearman's correlation coefficient of HTT and CTT was 1.00 in FM and RM. The mean difference of RM-CTT and FM-CTT versus HTT was 0.09âÂ±â0.30Â mm and 0.19âÂ±â0.35Â mm. In one case, the HTT was identical to the CTT in both modes. This pilot study shows high conformity of CTT and HTT measured in malignant melanoma underlining the potential of ex-vivo CLSM for perioperative decisions on safety margin excisions of malignant melanoma in the future.\n\nIn vitro/in vivo characterization of nanoemulsion formulation of metronidazole with improved skin targeting and anti-rosacea properties.\n\nPubMed\n\nYu, Meng; Ma, Huixian; Lei, Mingzhu; Li, Nan; Tan, Fengping\n\n2014-09-01\n\nTopical skin treatment was limited due to the lack of suitable delivery system with significant cutaneous localization and systemic safety. The aim of this study was to develop and optimize a nanoemulsion (NE) to enhance targeting localization of metronidazole (MTZ) in skin layers. In vitro studies were used to optimize NE formulations, and a series of experiments were carried in vitro and in vivo to validate the therapeutic efficacy of MTZ-loaded optimal NE. NE type selection and D-optimal design study were applied to optimize NE formulation with maximum skin retention and minimum skin penetration. Three formulation variables: Oil X1 (Labrafil), Smix X2 (a mixture of Cremophor EL/Tetraethylene glycol, 2:1 w/w) and water X3 were included in D-design. The system was assessed for skin retention Y1, cumulative MTZ amount after 24 h Y2 and droplet size Y3. Following optimization, the values of formulation components (X1, X2 and X3) were 4.13%, 16.42% and 79.45%, respectively. The optimized NE was assessed for viscosity, droplet size, morphological study and in vitro permeation in pig skin. Distributions of MTZ were validated by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Active agent of NE transferred into deeper skin and localized in epidermal/dermal layers after 24 h, which showed significant advantages of the optimal NE over Gel. The skin targeting localization and minimal systemic escape of optimal NE was further proved by in vivo study on rat skin. Current in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) enabled the prediction of pharmacokinetic profile of MTZ from in vitro permeation results. Further, the in vivo anti-rosacea efficacy of optimal formulation was investigated by pharmacodynamics study on mice ear. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we describe a correlative microscopy technique that offers a possibility of combining two-photon in vivo imaging with focus ion beam/scanning electron microscope (FIB/SEM) techniques. Long-term two-photon in vivo imaging allows the visualization of functional interactions within the brain of a living organism over the time, and therefore, is emerging as a new tool for studying the dynamics of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimerâs disease. However, light microscopy has important limitations in revealing alterations occurring at the synaptic level and when this is required, electron microscopy is mandatory. FIB/SEM microscopy is a novel tool for three-dimensional high-resolution reconstructions, since it acquires automated serial images at ultrastructural level. Using FIB/SEM imaging, we observed, at 10 nm isotropic resolution, the same dendrites that were imaged in vivo over 9 days. Thus, we analyzed their ultrastructure and monitored the dynamics of the neuropil around them. We found that stable spines (present during the 9 days of imaging) formed typical asymmetric contacts with axons, whereas transient spines (present only during one day of imaging) did not form a synaptic contact. Our data suggest that the morphological classification that was assigned to a dendritic spine according to the in vivo images did not fit with its ultrastructural morphology. The correlative technique described herein is likely to open opportunities for unravelling the earlier unrecognized complexity of the nervous system. Lay Description Neuroscience and the understanding of brain functions are closely linked to the technical advances in microscopy. In this study we performed a correlative microscopy technique that offers the possibility to combine 2 photon in vivo imaging and FIB/SEM microscopy.

A primary difficulty in validating these EM imaging modalities is that the true dielectric property values of the particular breast being imaged are not readily available on an individual subject basis. Here, we describe our initial experience in seeking to correlate tomographic EM imaging studies with discrete point spectroscopy measurements of the dielectric properties of breast tissue. The protocol we have developed involves measurement of in vivo tissue properties during partial and full mastectomy procedures in the operating room (OR) followed by ex vivo tissue property recordings in the same locations in the excised tissue specimens in the pathology laboratory immediately after resection. We have successfully applied all of the elements of this validation protocol in a series of six women with cancer diagnoses. Conductivity and permittivity gauged from ex vivo samples over the frequency range 100 Hzâ8.5 GHz are found to be similar to those reported in the literature. A decrease in both conductivity and permittivity is observed when these properties are gauged from ex vivo samples instead of in vivo. We present these results in addition to a case study demonstrating how discrete point spectroscopy measurements of the tissue can be correlated and used to validate EM imaging studies.

One such fundamental relationship is that between axon diameter and the axon's conduction velocity (ACV). Measurement of these neuronal properties, however, requires invasive procedures that preclude direct elucidation of this relationship in vivo. Here we demonstrate that diffusion-based MRI is sensitive to the fine microstructural elements of brain wiring and can be used to quantify axon diameter in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrate the in vivo correlation between the diameter of an axon and its conduction velocity in the human brain. Using AxCaliber, a novel magnetic resonance imaging technique that enables us to estimate in vivo axon diameter distribution (ADD) and by measuring the interhemispheric transfer time (IHTT) by electroencephalography, we found significant linear correlation, across a cohort of subjects, between brain microstructure morphology (ADD) and its physiology (ACV) in the tactile and visual sensory domains. The ability to make a quantitative assessment of a fundamental physiological property in the human brain from in vivo measurements of ADD may shed new light on neurological processes occurring in neuroplasticity as well as in neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nIn vivo two-dimensional NMR correlation spectroscopy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKraft, Robert A.\n\n1999-10-01\n\nThe poor resolution of in-vivo one- dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) has limited its clinical potential. Currently, only the large singlet methyl resonances arising from N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), choline, and creatine are quantitated in a clinical setting. Other metabolites such as myo- inositol, glutamine, glutamate, lactate, and Î³- amino butyric acid (GABA) are of clinical interest but quantitation is difficult due to the overlapping resonances and limited spectral resolution. To improve the spectral resolution and distinguish between overlapping resonances, a series of two- dimensional chemical shift correlation spectroscopy experiments were developed for a 1.5 Tesla clinical imaging magnet. Two-dimensional methods are attractive for in vivo spectroscopy due to their ability to unravel overlapping resonances with the second dimension, simplifying the interpretation and quantitation of low field NMR spectra. Two-dimensional experiments acquired with mix-mode line shape negate the advantages of the second dimension. For this reason, a new experiment, REVOLT, was developed to achieve absorptive mode line shape in both dimensions. Absorptive mode experiments were compared to mixed mode experiments with respect to sensitivity, resolution, and water suppression. Detailed theoretical and experimental calculations of the optimum spin lock and radio frequency power deposition were performed. Two-dimensional spectra were acquired from human bone marrow and human brain tissue. The human brain tissue spectra clearly reveal correlations among the coupled spins of NAA, glutamine, glutamate, lactate, GABA, aspartate and myo-inositol obtained from a single experiment of 23 minutes from a volume of 59 mL.

Gregory\n\n2011-01-01\n\nNovel low-power adiabatic sequences are demonstrated for in-vivo localized two-dimensional (2D) correlated MR spectroscopy, such as COSY (Correlated Spectroscopy) and TOCSY (Total Correlated Spectroscopy). The design is based on three new elements for in-vivo 2D MRS: the use of gradient modulated constant adiabaticity GOIA-W(16,4) pulses for i) localization (COSY and TOCSY) and ii) mixing (TOCSY), and iii) the use of longitudinal mixing (z-filter) for magnetization transfer during TOCSY. GOIA-W(16,4) provides accurate signal localization, and more importantly, lowers the SAR for both TOCSY mixing and localization. Longitudinal mixing improves considerably (five-folds) the efficiency of TOCSY transfer. These are markedly different from previous 1D editing TOCSY sequences using spatially non-selective pulses and transverse mixing. Fully adiabatic (adiabatic mixing with adiabatic localization) and semi-adiabatic (adiabatic mixing with non-adiabatic localization) methods for 2D TOCSY are compared. Results are presented for simulations, phantoms, and in-vivo 2D spectra from healthy volunteers and patients with brain tumors obtained on 3T clinical platforms equipped with standard hardware. To the best of our knowledge this is the first demonstration of in-vivo adiabatic 2D TOCSY and fully adiabatic 2D COSY. It is expected that these methodological developments will advance the in-vivo applicability of multi(spectrally)dimensional MRS to reliably identify metabolic biomarkers.

To predict the effectiveness of new designed formulations during preclinical studies, a correlation between in vitro assays and in vivo efficacy was performed. Liposomal BZC was characterized in terms of membrane/water partition coefficient, encapsulation efficiency, size, polydispersity, zeta potential, and morphology. Liposomal BZC (BL10) was incorporated into gel formulation and its performances were compared to plain BZC gel (B10) and the commercially available BZC gel (B20). BL10 and B10 presented higher flux and retention on pig esophagus mucosa with a shorter lag time, when compared to B20. BZC flux was strongly correlated with in vivo anesthetic efficacy, but not with topical anesthesia duration. The retention studies did not correlate with any of the in vivo efficacy parameters. Thus, in vitro permeation study can be useful to predict anesthetic efficacy during preclinical tests, because a correlation between flux and anesthetic efficacy was observed. Therefore, in vitro assays, followed by in vivo efficacy, are necessary to confirm anesthetic performance.\n\nFluorescence lifetime correlation spectroscopy for precise concentration detection in vivo by background subtraction\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGÃ¤rtner, Maria; MÃ¼tze, JÃ¶rg; Ohrt, Thomas; Schwille, Petra\n\n2009-07-01\n\nIn vivo studies of single molecule dynamics by means of Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy can suffer from high background. Fluorescence lifetime correlation spectroscopy provides a tool to distinguish between signal and unwanted contributions via lifetime separation. By studying the motion of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) within two compartments of a human cell, the nucleus and the cytoplasm, we observed clear differences in concentration as well as mobility of the protein complex between those two locations. Especially in the nucleus, where the fluorescence signal is very weak, a correction for background is crucial to provide reliable results of the particle number. Utilizing the fluorescent lifetime of the different contributions, we show that it is possible to distinguish between the fluorescent signal and the autofluorescent background in vivo in a single measurement.\n\nDetermining Protease Activity In Vivo by Fluorescence Cross-Correlation Analysis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKohl, Tobias; Haustein, Elke; Schwille, Petra\n\n2005-01-01\n\nTo date, most biochemical approaches to unravel protein function have focused on purified proteins in vitro. Whereas they analyze enzyme performance under assay conditions, they do not necessarily tell us what is relevant within a living cell. Ideally, cellular functions should be examined in situ. In particular, association/dissociation reactions are ubiquitous, but so far there is no standard technique permitting online analysis of these processes in vivo. Featuring single-molecule sensitivity combined with intrinsic averaging, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy is a minimally invasive technique ideally suited to monitor proteins. Moreover, endogenous fluorescence-based assays can be established by genetically encoding fusions of autofluorescent proteins and cellular proteins, thus avoiding the disadvantages of in vitro protein labeling and subsequent delivery to cells. Here, we present an in vivo protease assay as a model system: Green and red autofluorescent proteins were connected by Caspase-3- sensitive and insensitive protein linkers to create double-labeled protease substrates. Then, dual-color fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy was employed to study the protease reaction in situ. Allowing assessment of multiple dynamic parameters simultaneously, this method provided internal calibration and improved experimental resolution for quantifying protein stability. This approach, which is easily extended to reversible protein-protein interactions, seems very promising for elucidating intracellular protein functions.

Using traditional animal models to detect hepatotoxicity is expensive and time-consuming. Alternative in vitro methods, in particular cell-based high-throughput screening (HTS) studies, have provided the research community with a large amount of data from toxicity assays. Among the various assays used to screen potential toxicants is the antioxidant response element beta lactamase reporter gene assay (ARE-bla), which identifies chemicals that have the potential to induce oxidative stress and was used to test > 10,000 compounds from the Tox21 program. The ARE-bla computational model and HTS data from a big data source (PubChem) were used to profile environmental and pharmaceutical compounds with hepatotoxicity data. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models were developed based on ARE-bla data. The models predicted the potential oxidative stress response for known liver toxicants when no ARE-bla data were available. Liver toxicants were used as probe compounds to search PubChem Bioassay and generate a response profile, which contained thousands of bioassays (> 10 million data points). By ranking the in vitro-in vivo correlations (IVIVCs), the most relevant bioassay(s) related to hepatotoxicity were identified. The liver toxicants profile contained the ARE-bla and relevant PubChem assays. Potential toxicophores for well-known toxicants were created by identifying chemical features that existed only in compounds with high IVIVCs. Profiling chemical IVIVCs created an opportunity to fully explore the source-to-outcome continuum of modern "
