        "text": "Show 1: 7pm / Show 2: 9:30pm –\n\nMaija DiGiorgio is a comedian, filmmaker & a NY-to-LA transplant. Maija took the comedy world by storm in her first year doing standup, taping five national TV appearances. Her hour special for Comedy Dynamics is titled Maija! Maija! Maija! Recorded at the Tribeca Film Festival in NYC & her Dry Bar Special “Maija Pinion” is now on Amazon Prime. Her three Dry Bar segments are now reaching over six million views on the web. Being part of a summer series at the prestigious Here Theater in SOHO, her one-woman show IncogNegro is being developed into an upcoming special. She is also in the process of recording her first comedy album for 800 Pound Gorilla Records. Since her impressive start in comedy, Maija has taken her talents to countless prestigious venues worldwide—including the Beacon Theater, the New Orleans Essence Festival, and Scotland’s Edinburgh Festival—as well as TV performances across most major networks, including HBO, NBC, Fox, Bet & Showtime. She has shared the stage with many industry standouts—like Dave Chappelle, Kevin Hart, Bill Burr, Wanda Sykes, Mike Epps, Tracy Morgan & Craig Robinson.\n\nMaija’s comedy examines the complexities of what it means to be a mixed-race, multicultural woman. Through her witty nature and playful charisma, she tackles topics like dating, family & daily observations in a way that is hilarious, entertaining, and in a dialect any culture can understand!"
