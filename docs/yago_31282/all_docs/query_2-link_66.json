        "text": "Four comedians, one hilarious night, when The Big Apple Comedy Club returns to The Newton Theatre Stage on Friday, Jan. 31, 2020.\n\nMaija DiGiorgio is a comedian, actor, writer, radio personality, filmmaker, musician, and an NY-to-LA transplant. In her first year doing stand up, Maija took the comedy world by storm taping five national TV appearances, receiving a standing ovation at NBCâs Live from the Apollo, and performing at the HBO Aspen Comedy Festival. Since her impressive start in comedy, Maija has taken her talents to countless prestigious venues worldwideâincluding the Beacon Theater, the New Orleansâ Essence Festival, and Scotlandâs Edinburgh Festivalâas well as TV performances across most major networksâ including HBOâs Def Comedy Jam, NBCâs Comics Unleashed, Foxâs Laughs, Uncontrolled Comedy Hour, Betâs Comic View, and Showtimeâs Michael Vick Comedy Explosion.\n\nDan Wilson is one of those breezy, gentle types that will hit you like a building collapsing if youâre not paying attention. He is one of the great \"class clowns\" in the business. This is good-time comedy, clean and inoffensive but still mondo humorous and itâd be a darn good idea to see for yourself. Dan Wilson is a comedic force to be reckoned with. Long a favorite on the college and club circuits, Dan began to branch out with a talked about appearance at Budd Friedmanâs American Comedy Convention, held at The Riviera in Las Vegas. With that industry exposure under his belt, he began a string of television appearances including \"Star Search,\" A&Eâs \"Evening at the Improv,\" MTVâs \"Half Hour Comedy Hour,\" ESPN, Lifetime and Comedy Central. His rubbery face and keen ear for voices earned him status as a recurring sketch performer on HBOâs \"Hardcore T.V.\"\n\nBrad Trackman is a national touring comedian who has been featured as a stand up on CBS's The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, Comics Unleashed with Byron Allen, Star Search with Arsenio Hall, AXS tv's Gotham Comedy Live, MTV's The Buried Life, New Joke City with Robert Klein, NBC's Later, NBC's Friday Night and numerous appearances on Comedy Central. Trackman also had his own commercial campaign on Spike TV where he played the fictitious Presidential Candidate Biff Wolanski. Brad started his career in NYC and is a regular at The Comedy Cellar, Gotham, The Comic Strip Live, Carolines on Broadway and Stand Up NY. Also a regular in Atlantic City at the Borgota Casino and Las Vegas at Brad Garrett's Comedy Club in the MGM casino.\n\nJoe Larson started comedy at an early age and has always had a knack for making light of any situation. At 20 he really began to seriously pursue stand-up, comedy acting and improv as a potential career when he was chosen âCollege Comedian of the Yearâ at The Las Vegas Comedy Festival. Then the Seattle born and raised Comedian decided he didnât have enough traffic, smog, and pastrami in his life so he moved to New York City. Working the comedy circuit on the east coast, Larson found early success. He was nominated âBest Up-And-Coming Comedianâ at the NYC MAC Awards, and was a finalist in both the prestigious Johnny Carson Great American Comedy Festival and the Boston Comedy Festival. His popular blog, âMan with A Babyâ is read and enjoyed by many, and online sketch comedy pieces with âGrandmaâs Favoriteâ are a Youtube favorite."
