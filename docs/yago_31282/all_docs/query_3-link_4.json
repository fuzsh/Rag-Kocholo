        "text": "Tristan Bushman has quickly become one of the most talked about singer/songwriters after crashing into Music City.\n\nAshton, IL, is where Tristan was born and raised, surrounded by a musical family. His father Dave and his band would have Tristan join them on stage when he was only 5 years old. That lead him on his journey and now, at only 22 years old, he is a highly-respected songwriter, a true artist, a seasoned musician, and a captivating performer.\n\nNot only does Tristan have the rare ability to level any room with his stunning lyrics, he delivers his prose with pure honesty, soaring melodies, and the richest tone. He has been gaining a loyal fanbase while catching the attention of the entire industry.\n\n2009 Bitter Jester Grand Champion\n\nQuinn grew up in a musical family in Chicago. His two brothers, his sister, and he all participated in their high school choir and music department and all went on to study music in college.\n\nOne of his brothers is a professional jazz musician and composer in Chicago and his second brother is a bass player who formerly played for the Alabama Symphony and is currently studying at USC Thornton School of Music.\n\nQuinn received a degree in music composition and production from the University of Miami (also the alma matter of Bitter Jester producer Nicolas DeGrazia!). In his earlier years he and his brother played in a band, Maq, that won the Bitter Jester Music Festival in 2009.\n\nAfter college he went on to work as a recording engineer at Interscope Studios in Los Angeles while continuing to write and produce his own projects. Quinn has since =moved on from a professional music career but continues to write and play songs with family and friends. He retains a great appreciation for genuine, passionate lyrics and honest, committed performances and wishes all the Bitter Jester artists good luck!\n\n“I had the pleasure of participating in the Bitter Jester Music Festival as the winning band in 2009.\n\nEven in those early years the music festival was so well put together and it was such a pleasure to work with Nic. He is so passionate and kind to the musicians he works with!”\n\n— Quinn Carson\n\nA graduate of Loyola University New Orleans (BM Jazz, Minor in Philosophy, Magna Cum Laude, 2011), and Northwestern University (MM Jazz, 2013), Gustavo Cortiñas has developed a successful career in the US for over a decade, leading and accompanying ensembles in renowned stages and festivals in North America, Latin America, Asia, and Europe.\n\n“Cortiñas’ music is uplifting, robust, melodic, and gets your body moving; it’s an exciting blend of the artist’s musical influences from jazz and Latin American, including his native Mexico”\n\n— Downbeat Magazine\n\nRe: \"Snapshot,” his 2013 record:\n\n“A Smörgåsbord of the moods and nuances that make up the human experience... an idiosyncratic album that intrinsically fuses the personal to the universal.”\n\n— Lissette Corsa, Jazziz Magazine\n\nRe: \"ESSE\" (Origin Arts 2017):\n\n“With the cohesive and captivating Esse, Cortiñas has created superb work that balances refreshingly inventive ideas with high-caliber musicianship. This exquisite and continuously gripping record is a testament to Cortiñas’ triple threat of skills as dynamic performer, agile bandleader and brilliant composer.”\n\n— Hrayr Attarian, Chicago Jazz Magazine\n\nDuring his time in Chicago, Cortiñas has become one of the most sought out drummers, performing and recording with Kitt Lyles' Real Talk, Erik Skov's Liminality, Imagery Converter, Emily Kuhn's Helios, the Roy McGrath Quaret, and the Carla Campopiano Trio, among other ensembles.\n\nCortiñas is a member of the Chicago Jazz Composer's Collective, performing regularly for their monthly residency at Chicago's very own Green Mill. Currently, with a grant from the Mexican National Endowment of the Arts (FONCA), he is working on his third and most ambitious project as a leader: a musical journey which traces through thirteen compositions - the poetic and tragic history set by Eduardo Galeano in his book: The Open Veins of Latin America.\n\nChris Falcon is a fitness expert, small business owner, children's book author, newspaper columnist, artist, podcaster, community activist, and lover of deep dish pizza. He is also an extremely passionate motivational speaker. Chris believes that in order to reach your full potential you must be able to visualize not only the life you see yourself living, but how that life will positively impact the world.\n\nChris is the founder of Take No Bullying, a not for profit anti- bullying organization, as well as creator of Glenview Mentoring, a community based micro-mentoring resource for students. Chris has an undying belief in the power one person has to take control of their lives. He has spoken to groups of all ages about owning personal power, discovering your “Call to Action”, and the Art of Vision Creation.\n\nChris is able to capture the minds of everyone from young children to adults. His ability to connect with a wide variety of people on many levels has led him to be called the \"Swiss Army Knife\" of motivational speakers.\n\nChris is the inventor of the Ergopick, a guitar pick reimagined (coming soon!). He is a freestyle musician and songwriter who loves messing around on the piano and jamming with friends. More information at www.ChrisFalcon.com.\n\nA self-taught guitarist, multi-instrumentalist, and singer / songwriter, Nick hails from Highland Park, IL where he performed in the very first Bitter Jester Music Festival circa 2006 with his now legendary band Sad Panda. He jams often with his good childhood buddies with whom he's been singing forever. He wants you to feel good. And you will.\n\nHe went on to earn a bachelors degree in History at the University of Pittsburgh, all the while nurturing his musicality through labors of love, joining the prestigious Heinz Chapel Choir, and enlisting in the glam rock outfit Dazzletine.\n\nCurrently, Nick is the lead guitar installment and co-producer of the Chicago psychedelic group Head, who will be releasing two new records this summer. Check out one of their backyard performances here. Furthermore, he is in production of his debut solo project for which he is recording every instrument on 40+ new songs and planning to recruit a band for live shows.\n\nAs a solo performer, he pays much homage to the late 60's pop/psychedelic/folk scene, incorporating much Beatles and Simon & Garfunkel-esque tunes in his repertoire. After years of developing blending techniques in choirs, vocal harmonies are one of Nick’s fortes.\n\nHaving additionally taught himself piano, bass, and drums over the years, Nick has developed an interest in collecting as many instruments as he can and learning to play them or making new unique sounds with them. Nick is stoked to be participating in the 2020 Bitter Jester Original Song Competition as a judge and sends good vibes and encouraging wishes to all those involved!\n\nMelissa Forman grew up in Northbrook where she attended Glenbrook North High School. She went on to graduate college from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In 2008 Melissa received a Distinguished Alumnus Award from Glenbrook North where she was recognized for her leadership as an outstanding radio broadcaster and for her contribution to the community. She has been one of only a few women to lead a morning radio show and the first woman in the country to simultaneously host both a show in the morning and in the afternoon drive (at 93.9 WLIT-Chicago). She has also helped raise over $500,000 for local charities.\n\nMelissa's radio career started in Champaign, Illinois where she worked as an intern and received her first break imitating Bart Simpson on Mix 94.5. That break led to an incredibly successful five-year, on-air teaming with her partner, Jerome Ritchie. She then moved to Cincinnati where she worked at Mix 94.1. In 1999, she moved home to Chicago where she worked at WKIE-FM 92.7/5 (KISS FM). In 2001 she started hosting morning drive at WLIT-FM 93.9 in Chicago until August of 2009 with a team she loved.\n\nHer on-air radio adventures have taken her flying at six G's in fighter jets, hot air ballooning live on the air, sitting in 17,000 seats in chilly November at Memorial Stadium in order to raise money for a children's charity, and living in a shopping mall for four straight days.\n\nMelissa joined WCIU-TV (The \"U\") to Co-Host \"You & Me This Morning\" in 2009 until 2017 with Jeanne Sparrow. She is now back hosting mornings on 93.9 WLIT (Lite FM) from 6-10am weekdays. She has 4 Kids, 2 dogs, 2 frogs, 1 husband and a cat.

Through doing so, he gained a passion for music and became eager to expand his musical knowledge and rhythmic technique. Shortly after, Sam began to take drum lessons at The North Shore Music Institute. He did so under the instruction of Jim Hines (Brian Wilson). Through weekly lessons with Jim, Sam began to learn funk, jazz, rock and rudimental techniques. In high school, Sam was enthralled by the various musical opportunities offered. He became a percussionist in the Marching Giant’s drum line, Highland Park High School Jazz Ensemble, Honors Jazz Combo, and the Highland Park High School’s Wind Ensemble in which he toured China and received both the Most Improved Player Award and Woody Herman Jazz Award. Outside of school, Sam performed with his own Pop-Rock group, Xazz, playing at local Chicago venues like The House of Blues, Elbo Room, and Bottom Lounge. Additionally, the group released two all original EP’s in 2014 and 2015. Sam accredits many of his musical highlights during his teen years to the Bitter Jester Music Festival having been a Grand Champion as part of Xazz in 2014 and Caroline & The Priority in 2016.\n\nIn the summer of 2015 Sam deferred acceptance to Berklee College of Music in order to pursue the opportunity to play for viral sensation, Caroline Baran of Post Modern Jukebox, whom he still performs for on occasion. With Baran, Sam played around the Chicagoland area and toured Poland. In the summer of 2016 Sam began playing for his brother, Max Subar, a Chicago-based singer-songwriter. In addition to recording drums and percussion for his debut EP, In A Dream, Sam has played with Max throughout Chicago at venues like Schubas Tavern, Subterranean, The City Winery, and Space. He is also featured on Max's second EP, What The Story Says, released in the spring of 2019 and on Max's third EP to be released later this summer.\n\nIn 2016 Sam began attending Berklee College of Music on scholarship as a full-time student studying Professional Music with concentrations in Performance and Music Business. There he pushed himself within his craft and was lucky enough to perform and record with piano extraordinaire Jesus Javier Molina, The Bob Marley Ensemble, The Berklee Turntable Ensemble, Boston based Afro-Pop group Kina Zore, vibraphonist Colin Anderson, guitarists Gabe Childs and Hans Kristian Nordin, and singer songwriters Noah Kesselman and Corrina Tadros. He studied with the likes of Kenwood Dennard, Bob Gullotti, Steve Wilkes, Bob Tamagni, James Murphy, Jeffrey Lockhart and Dave DiCenso. During the summer of 2018, Sam traveled to Kenya with the non-for-profit organization Global Youth Groove along side a small group of Berklee students and faculty. There he had the opportunity to gig around the country. Additionally, he taught under-privileged youth and young adults whom he helped forge a relationship with Berklee to pursue higher educational opportunities within the U.S. In the spring semester of 2019, Sam received the Pro Music Academic & Performance Scholarship Award in recognition of his outstanding work within his studies and involvement on and off campus musically. In May of 2019, he graduated from Berklee. His experience culminated as a selected performer in the 2019 Berklee Commencement Concert at The Agganis Arena where he had the immense privilege of performing in front of students and their families, faculty, professors, and honorary doctorates Justin Timberlake, Missy Elliott, and Alex Lacamoire.\n\nAfter graduating, Sam moved back to his hometown of Chicago where he currently pursues a freelance career in drum performance, production and instruction. Today his pocket centric style behind the kit roots itself in a variety of styles with genuineness and musicality always at the forefront.\n\n“I feel immensely lucky to have been a part of two different groups that were selected as Grand Champions of the Bitter Jester Music Festival in 2014 & 2016.\n\nAs both a participant and winner of the festival, BJFA granted me with a variety of musical and interpersonal opportunities in the industry that will forever serve as major highlights at the onset of my professional career path as a musician.\n\nI feel extreme gratitude for all of the selfless hard work Nic and the rest of the BJFA team puts forth to provide uniquely meaningful experiences for young musicians. ”\n\n— Sam Subar\n\nAt just 22, Ava Suppelsa has a had a career that rivals songwriters twice her age.
