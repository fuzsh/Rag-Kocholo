        "text": "Kaddy Ridl'weaver\n\nNew Santharian\n\nOffline\n\nPosts: 23\n\nElf, Ak'váth'rhím\n\n« on: May 20, 2006, 05:25:23 AM »\n\nName: Kadence Ridlweaver\n\nNicknames and aliases: Kaddy the Heckler amongst the crowds she performs for. Ladyhawke has been given to her by the people of Ciosa because of her importing, exporting and training of birds. This name extends outside the walls of the city and has brought many a customer from afar.\n\nType: Assassin-Jester\n\nGender: Female\n\nRace: Elf\n\nTribe: Akváthrhím\n\nAge: 187 Age by Appearance: 27\n\nSkills and Training: Assassin-Swordswoman / Equivalent to a human 38 years of age, though more in depth.\n\nApproximate lifespan: 400 Years\n\nEye Color: Ice Green\n\nHair Color: Medium length norsidian\n\nHeight: Near 2 Palmspans over a Ped and a half (A bit short for her tribe. 510)\n\nWeight: 119 Od (Near 119lbs.)\n\nTitle: Bitter Jester\n\n ÷  Descripion  ÷ \n\nMedium length norsidian locks surge over her lithe and muscular shoulders, thick silky tresses flowing down her tiny back, ending at near two palmspans beneath her supple neckline. Kadence has not altered this style of cut in over a century; she has no intention of changing this now. It is extremely perceptible that she is exceedingly vain over her appearance. Often times her black mane is tied by a crimson and golden hairpiece, into a ponytail that comes to rest just between her lithe shoulder blades. This permits the elf a wide angle of vision when performing, stalking or murdering the innocent.\n\nGreen eyes peer out from her porcelain like face, their coloring a shade of jade ice. Many times she has used this somewhat mystifying hue to aid in the capture of her audience. If stared into many have said there is an ancientness swirling in them and a feeling of darkness gathered in their depths. Kadence has time and again used makeup about them, causing their chilly surface to appear almost radiant.\n\nHer pale elven face the picturesque image of an Akváthrhím elf, high cheekbones, unblemished pallid skin, and her radiant green eyes all indications of her people. The overall shape of her face coupled with a mischievious fanged smile can easily be compared to a grinning carnivore. Her narrow lips occasionally painted in a deep crimson or golden color, a habit she has gained from performing for so many years. If evil has elegance to it, then Kaddy would be perfect to fill this role. For she is often beaming brightly when a melodic tune rolls easily from well trained lips, this conceals the foul and dark being lurking in the depths of a gorgeous visage.\n\nA whimsical jest is always upon her lips, more than a few akin the sounds of her voice to frozen chimes carried upon the zephyrs of early mornings in Cyhalloi. Most of her jests, songs and stories draw a great deal of attention from those about her, Kadences skill in the entertainment arts are very evident. Especially when combined with a chatterbird in the knitting of a tale, performing a great ballad or carrying a whimsical melody as she travels.\n\nShéntelór (Styrásh for New Song) is a constant companion of Kadence in recent travels. The beautiful chatterbird or psitta, as they are more commonly known, is ever-present flittering about overhead. The back feathers of this avian are a shimmering emerald, while under wing and tail the feathering is a shiny dark red. Kaddy and the bird are constantly jesting with one another in attempts to perfect their performances together. To those that pay attention the two appear to be conversing in three languages. Yet in truth they are only practicing with dedication their ever expanding repertoire of acts.\n\nMost times she wears robes over her other clothing, The garment is made of an obsidian black cloth with a flowing cowl that frequently veils Kadences eyes in deep shadow. When the cowl is laid back it is apparent why it is designed in such a way. No normal sized cowl would contain her abundance of obsidian tresses that spill out when it is lowered. For those that have not seen her face before, the lowering of the cowl has caused them to be a bit shocked. The raven hue of her locks, porcelain colored skin and icy hued eyes are in stark contrast to the dark background of this drab clothing.\n\nWhen the flowing robes are removed, strong and wiry muscles can be seen enveloping her 1.8 ped form in a revelation of endurance and health. For half a century she traveled a nomadic lifestyle amongst the lands she had escaped to, coupled with near a century and a half long tutelage amongst an elite group of assassins. Many decades have been spent traveling for her brethren on errands, practicing stealth and spreading her works as a jester. The weight of her chosen weapons being carried throughout her long travels has kept Kaddy in amazing physical health.\n\nShe does not drink alcohol ever, would scoff at smoking any types of tobacco, maybe even a bit fickle about others doing this and eats a regiment of natural foods sources at all times. The elf prefers walking, many times doing so instead of more conventional modes of transportation. She is no fool about such things though; she would ride a horse for far distances or a boat over vast waters.\n\nA coat made of soft leather, is designed in a black and cobalt striped motif that covers the elf from just above pale bosom to her supple waist. A tiny stud upon the left breast of the jacket is a jewel in the shape of a cobalt heart, the golden background behind the heart sets many an eye upon it. A large, singular, golden ring is set into the base of the front v-pattern of the tight fitting garment. A strap of weaved beads the colors sky blue, cobalt and azure in a striped pattern stretch over each elegant shoulder, adding a hint of color to the dark jacket. Another strap of cobalt beads is attached to the coat just below each armpit, the straps resting just below her shoulder on each arm, revealing the maiden's supple shoulders. Tapering into flowing white sleeves tied firmly at the wrists with azure leather straps, the threads holding these together are cobalt in color.\n\nKadence wears a black sash tied about a tiny waist this covers the top of her breeches yet underlies the leather jacket. A large key ring on the murderer's supple left hip is attached to the sash. There are eight keys on the ring at all times, five of them are to bird cages at home and the other three are blanks. Kaddy has two other copies of these keys at home. One is in the possession of her servant, colleague and friend while the other is stored in a footlocker at home\n\nSkintight norsidian hued leather breeches cover her sinuous but well-muscled legs, revealing much of her porcelain like stomach with a very low-cut front. The leathery stitches holding these breeches together are deep cobalt in color and run down the outside of each leg. A thin leather belt is run through the blue loops that circumvent the waistline of this garment. Though this item is often hidden beneath the flowing sash worn about her supple waist, a garrote is usually hung from a clip to the rear left of this belt. The assassin does enjoy the sounds of strangling victims when the opportunity presents itself.\n\nThe elf is adorned with few other accessories, a pair of black low-cut leather boots are often times on her feet. A set of black leather gloves can sometimes be noticed upon nimble fingers. On her supple neck rests a golden necklace, with a single blue stone set like a tear at the base of the v-shape and a solitary mint green stone as the centerpiece of it in the front. A double strand of beads is woven into Kadences wavy black tresses just above each pointy ear. The length of the strands ride at just above the base of her skull behind her elven head. This is used to keep lengthy locks from falling over her eyes when removed from a ponytail. The necklace and hair beads are always worn no matter the guise she is traveling in.\n\nA leather sheath is rested between powerful shoulder blades. Two obsidian armblades, a few nailsbreadths over a ped in length are in this scabbard. The hilts of these blades are done in a complex setup; allowing Kaddy to attach them to her wrists similar to a standard armblade. This permits the jester freedom of her hands to manipulate objects or to climb freely while remaining armed. Or the elf can attach standard hilts like a common sword and wield them as such. Melorvévan (The name meaning: Shadowbird in Styrash) is the weapon Kadence wields in her left hand, much of the blades length is serrated and is her weapon of choice in close conflicts; she enjoys the weapons talon like wounds. Móhecuá (The name meaning: Darkbreaking in Styrash) is the name of the murderers second armblade, and is only definable as different from Melorvévan in that is has no serrated edge. Both of them are effective when used from the shadows upon unsuspecting foes, just how the assassin likes to engage in combat.\n\n ÷  Personalîy  ÷ \n\nHer demeanor teems with energy, a person that is in a constant state of motion. Which for Kadence is true literally and figuratively, often times lost in song and revelry or just pondering and studying the world about her. Add to this that she is a consummate bird trainer and is always busy training one or more than one. Her life would look like it is utterly filled with things she is doing or things yet to be done. Most people never realize that through all the chaos and jokes, she is most likely studying a simpler course to her next prey.\n\nHunting other sentient beings does have its adverse effects upon a person and Kadence is a prime example of a murderous person. For a century and a half she has served as a killer of sentient beings, there's a lot of blood upon nimble hands. Few can properly understand the demonic sense of humor Kaddy must have to do her job. This ideology has left the elf with almost no friends only having those that perceive themselves as friends. If a bounty she was ordered to take were upon her closest friend it would be performed without question and most likely done with sadistic glee.\n\nA liar of epic proportions; nearly her entire life has been a lie. One that Kadence has built upon so much that she no longer recalls who she really is beneath the façade. Kaddy lies out of hand, doing so frequently; most of the words she speaks to others are at least partially a lie. If not a full blown deception meant to manipulate and harm those she wishes to. The only time anyone could be sure that the assassin speaks the truth is to her fellow Akváthrhím and those she has threatened. The jester's threats are never made lightly and have always ended in the untimely demise of those the elf has warned.\n\nKadences cover as a jester is a paradox; she is a fun loving and joyous person to everyone about her. Yet behind this veil the girl is a cold and heartless creature with no cares for the lives of anyone. On more than one occasion she has performed for an audience only to murder patrons as they walked the dark streets afterwards. Kaddy sees it as a Karii wrote: \"To look into her eyes was to see the moon, into her face to see darkness. And to look at her blade was the greatest epiphany; to see the delivery of yourself standing before Queprur, bare of all but your deeds in life and your fears of death.\" This little rhythm has and frequently does bring a blissful smile to her supple lips. In fact it is one passage she has taught all of her personal song birds (Chatterbird / Psitta) to quote in three languages.\n\n ÷  Srenghs  ÷ \n\nShe is very adept in the arts of stealth; her natural swiftness coupled with Kadences ability to manipulate those of the opposite sex. Only enhances the elfs ability to get close to those she has targeted. Roughly two centuries of these practices have taught the maiden the finer arts of slyness on a daily bases. Watching, waiting, listening and striking from the shadows are a way of life for the murdering elf.\n\nThe wealth she has acquired over the decades would be considered a good strength. Kadence could easily do no more than train, breed, and deal in the trade of birds while living a life of relative comfort. On top of this she is a consummate assassin that is paid handsomely for her work. Still a portion of the elf's ill gotten wealth is spent on the wages of her personal bird handlers that also work in Kaddy's shop Ladyhawkes Aerie in Ciosa. She can speak four languages fluently and one decently well, this adds great prestige when one teaches a chatterbird to speak and sing in its masters language.\n\nShe speaks: Styrash, Tharian, Ylffer, KhomchrOm and speaks the trade language of Thergermin. Ylffer is only taught to her own personal birds because Kadence must spend alot of one on one time with the animal. Without the distractions of other languages interfering, due to different handlers, for none of her handlers know this tongue. The jester teaches no more than two languages to any one bird, rare is the occasion that she has found one capable of conversing in three. These being the ones Kaddy would keep for herself and integrate into performance acts.\n\nA melodious voice; her grandmother taught her the basics of musical representation. She has spent almost a century perfecting her songs and training them to her animals. Small excursions spent within the city of Bardavos have enhanced her musical skills to a presentable level. This lengthy practice is apparent in her acts as a jester, storyteller and bird handler. Many a small town or settlement around Ciosa recognize the jester on sight and welcome her arrival. Kaddy's natural propensity for music can be heard in her magnificent voice. The elf could have been a singer of great renown had she obtained formal teachings as was the dream of Eáránë.\n\n ÷  Weaknesses  ÷ \n\nA maelstrom of seething anger that borders on homicidal simmers frequently behind the elfs grinning visage. Kaddy has been known to launch into a swarm of claw racks and bites on those that have displeased the assassin. This tension builds gradually in the jester, especially when things are not revolving solely about her or business dealings have been tense. Though this has granted the assassin an escape route through surprise on more than one occasion, it is no way a deadly barrage. Hence she has left behind many that harbor enormous animosity towards her. Not something she finds enjoyable as a few of these enemies are trained killers, criminal organizations and ruffians from all walks of life.\n\nShe is utterly infatuated with all things avian most times spending a small fortune on literature and paintings of birds. When she first notices a new species, exquisite painting or a species of bird she has not watched previously she becomes nearly zealous in her observations of them. During these times she will ignore most of the significant things about her and follows the subject solely. The only time she can remain focused upon her work is if she is on a mission given to her by her murderous brethren. She has even been known to postpone musical performances in pursuit of an elusive bird.\n\nMuch of Kadences life has been spent living a lie; of course this is a natural thing for a habitual liar. This has left her with almost no friends and even fewer that she calls friend. Her friends number no more than a handful, the bird handlers of her shop, Grogan the dwarven merchant and the contacts she has within the underworld of Ciosa. Yet most of these are nothing more than superficial friendships she uses as a cover in the city. Grogan would be her one and only true friend, the dwarfs business relationship and avian knowledge have forged a true friendship with Kaddy. The dwarf would be the only person that she would feel any remorse for killing. Yet Grogan has never been a subject of interest for extermination, she has shared all of her knowledge of the dwarf with her fellow assassins. It is only that the merchant has no bearing in the assassins agenda that has kept their friendship on purely a personal level.\n\nThe elfess is highly xenophobic when dealing with humans in general. She gets along well with some people in Ciosa only due to the century spent amongst them. But as a rule of thumb she is contemptuous towards humans of other tribes, this being a carry over from her days of abuse at the hands of human mercenaries. This can be noticed in her public performances where she will often times play out her stories, songs or ballads to nonhuman patrons first and foremost. When traveling with merchant caravans or in a large city Kadence will distance herself from most humans only warming up to a few over long periods. This attribute has caused tension for her on more than one occasion and blood to be spilled frequently. Her lack of great weapon skills makes this attitude she carries, life threatening at times.\n\n ÷  Occupaions  ÷ \n\nKaddy has a list filled with things she is doing, has done or needs to be done. When she is not traveling she spends a lot of time running Ladyhawkes Aerie in Ciosa. Most weekends and early evenings she sets about outlying providences guised as Kaddy the Heckler. More than a few people call her Kaddy when they visit Ladyhawkes a charming shop and apartment not far from the Ports of Ciosa. The basis of the business idea were founded on her passionate love of birds. The jester is sometimes approached for after hour work while tending her shop, the more pristine the gathering the more likely Kadence will attend.\n\nShe also created Ladyhawkes Aerie because this port city is a hub of traveling information. The Aerie is located a few blocks from the docks which is a great place for gathering details from fellow mercenaries. It serves as a stable homebase for her travels as the jester, weaseling her way into upper class gatherings, only to murder one of the patrons or to absorb knowledge and pass it on to fellow assassins.\n\n ÷  Hisory  ÷ \n\nKadence Ridlweaver was born in the year 1479 B.S. on the second Elfday in the month of Molten Ice. Her family not of the highest noble standards of the Akváthrhím, brought Kadence into a life of near poverty. (Due to her mothers horrible burning that left the elf maid unable to grow hair in certain patches. This tragedy was vastly life changing for her kin, in a tribe prizing beauty above all things.)\n\nImmediate Family\n\nMother: Eáránë, once a prominent socialite amongst the Akváthrhím an accident over two centuries distant left these aspirations behind. Over the coming times, after the accident, she became fairly well known for her ability to apply complex dye patterns on most garments. Keeping the family still closely associated with some families of great renown but far behind their hopes.\n\nFather: Círdan, a picturesque male of his tribe and a practiconer in the arts of the sword. These arts had long since become nothing more than dances of beauty as the tribe has no need for true combat in their near utopian society. More than a bit of his time was spent teaching these dances to his children. A man destined to not remain amongst the travesty of his present life, more than one female of the tribe would welcome his attentions.\n\nBrother: Caranthir, only a decade older than Kadence they are extremely close, or were before his untimely death. (More mention of this topic in this section.) He spent many hours with his father and carried an unusually strong bond with him. This rivaled a level of hero worship as the boy would spend countless hours listening to tales of his fathers life.\n\nÇhaÞer I: Humble Heritage\n\nThe earliest days of the elfs life were spent helping her mother the best she could in the families struggle to survive. Not frequent but at times other children of the tribe would pick fun at Kadence because of her mothers loss. Yet a constant supply of vermin fed them well enough in these early years. Jealousy was broiling in the youthful elfs heart not far into her short life, envy that only a society such as her own could draw forth from a young child.\n\nWhen coming into early adulthood she began to learn the lessons of her father, coupled with formal dance etiquette from her mother. This enhanced the maidens uncanny grace while forming a physique toned but not muscled like warriors of most nations. Though the young maiden had found bird watching to be the calm amongst the storm, a trait she had often used to escape from work and training as a small child. Occasionally shirking her duties all together as she would wander vast stretches of land observing avian species of all kinds. Dreams of flight upon feathered wings carried her away from her present life; a desire to be free upon the skies filled her heart with such hopes.\n\nHer teenage years began a constant loathing from most females within her age group and even some discourtesy from those a touch older. Kaddy was stunning and more than one young elf lad had come to speak with the young elf maiden. Surprisingly at times with food, song and small gifts being presented to her. The elf had found a crack in the prison that had entrapped her family and became resolute to open this veiled banishment forever.\n\nWith flowing norsidian locks, reminiscent of moonlight dancing over a rippling pool of clear water, resting near her supple waist. A physique built upon elegance and endurance that had begun catching the eyes of future suitors. The maids icy hued emerald eyes were odd but beautiful, causing alot of resentment amongst most of the female population. A feral smile was radiant and constantly beaming upon the young maidens delicate features. These are the weapons she set out with to face the females of the Akváthrhím on an equal level, for the first time in a life that had never promised her so much.\n\nÇhaÞer II: Trials and Tribulation\n\n1496 B.S. Brythke, a young elf lad, whose family was quite well to do amongst the Akváthrhím took great interest in Kadence during this time. The maiden's hobby of bird watching was frequently used to escape the constant tornado of social gatherings, lessons and chores given to her by the maiden's parents. Yet Brythke was all she had ever hoped, breaking customary habits Kaddy began to invite him on nature voyages, praying time together would inspire him into courtship in later days. These times alone did indeed create a strong friendship, something she had not enjoyed from other females of the tribe for close to a decade.\n\nSlowly the years began to pass for the charming couple, despite the fact that this closeness began to increase the enmity of others in Kaddys age group. Especially from Amordalia Sáralondë, a name that still resounds with sorrow in the assassins life. Amordalia was the youngest child of her family, placing her but a few years older than Kadence. Unlike Kaddy, Amor came from an extremely wealthy family and was afforded the status given to the daughter of a prominent Akái'ástyrás. A fact often displayed if not flaunted upon the elf with spite and jealousy dripping from each word.\n\nWithout a doubt Amordalia wouldve been Brythkes first choice in courtship, if Kaddy would not have been born. The girls knew where they stood with their perspective consort, if not husband, having exchanged vicious words on more than one instance. Such confrontations only smoothed over by their friendship with and desire to impress Brythke. If not for the male elf, Kadence knows she would have scarred that pretty face long before it mattered. The teachings of her father were definitely not lessons that Amor had been privy to throughout their youth.\n\n1506 B.S. The first year that Kadence was allowed to join in the courtship festivals of her people. Without question a stress filled time for the young elf, as Amordalia was already engaged in these for the past few years. A fact the other elf had not let Kaddy forget over every excruciating moment of them. Brythke had not approached any other woman of the tribe for a chance to be with them. Still she had begun to notice that Brythke had been spending more and more time with Amor, a fact that weighed heavily upon the elfs mind.\n\nBut one month prior to the start of the festivities that would determine who would be coupled for years to come; Kadence had retreated to a secluded spot not far from home. Late afternoon spent observing the passing avian creatures as she sang songs of joy in anticipation of the coming days. A peaceful respite for the maiden, considering she was frequently encircled with socialites vying for one anothers attentions. Only the sound that rolled forth from behind her could have ruined such a calm moment for the young maiden. The voice of Amor once again telling her how lowly she was with tales of times spent with Brythke in recent days, thrown in for spitefulness.\n\nThe prominent Akái'ástyráss daughter was on the verge of danger the moment she began to approach Kaddy. The girls words already had the elf maiden on the edge of tears and her pressing of matters was not lightening the mood. Amor held out her wrist, a wondrous silver bracelet carved in an intricate pattern displayed before the near weeping elf. Brythke gave this to me today as we dined together over a delicious luncheon he had prepared for me. The last words the other Akváthrhím female spoke before she lost control, a primal rage took over Kaddy as she lunged at the girl in a ferocious assault.\n\nSmall fights and arguments were not uncommon amongst Akváthrhím of this age, yet Kaddy took it far beyond a squabble. To this day she does not recall the extent of Amors struggles but the end result was very evident and life changing for them both. She had broken the other girls arm with a stone and had bitten a hefty chunk of flesh from her rivals cheek. One can only guess that these things were done after the girl was unconscious for the simple fact that no screams of pain were heard. The rush of Brythke tackling her from the girls fallen body could be the only reason Amordalia had lived through this act of brutality.\n\nShe struggled like an untamed beast trying to reach the downed woman, years of frustration and rage had boiled over in a tidal wave of fury. How long it took for her to calm is uncertain but Brythke looked much worse for the wear than he had ever before. The temperate flavor of fresh blood permeated over Kaddys palette as she fled from the scene in disgrace, not for what she had done, only because her potential consort had witnessed most of it. Terror, shame and grief constant companions as she fled for home at last locking herself away in a bedroom.\n\nÇhaÞer III: Old Acquaintances Revisited\n\nQuickly the things she strived wholeheartedly towards began to unravel in ways Kaddy had never considered possible. The scars upon Amors face were deep, most displeasing to gaze on and never going to heal properly as to be unnoticed. As a tribe the Akváthrhím demanded some reprimand to be placed on the maiden, even though numerous of them were guilty of far worse crimes. A decade long removal of Kadence as eligible to participate in the festival of courtship was imposed. Her only thoughts were upon Brythke and how she was assured he would not wait such a time for the sentence to pass.\n\nThe strange twist of fate that both girls had gotten what they desired, but neither had ever expected the other to get their way as well. Amordalia forever scarred and destined to never find a mate befitting of her once great beauty. Kadence frozen in poverty, a situation that at this point could not be changed with hard work, only self-reflection and continued participation in a socialite atmosphere offered any hope. Other females began to treat her with a distant demeanor, a benefit to Kaddy as this distance partially replaced the usual envious glares and jealous innuendos.\n\n1508 B.S. The elf had already avoided one attempt on her life, living with little doubt it would be the last effort in this regard. With no money to aid her plans Kadence could only consider repaying this favor personally and planned the act daily for near eight months, not that these ideas hadnt came to her in the past. She had the layout of Amors home from times spent visiting when she was a child memorizing the outside easily through casual observations. The assassin knew the other girls schedule like a social chart as it was very similar to her own, outside the fact that Amors involved very minimal labor.\n\nThe faithful event came as the maiden listened to the gentle sounds of night while staring upon the home of her target. A brisk sprint carried her swiftly to crouch concealed in the shadows beneath a windowsill, the reverberating beat of her heart echoing in pointed ears. Amors room only two floors above as she climbed to stand gingerly upon the windows ledge hands held high. Lithe legs turned to the side as they coiled into a powerful spring upwards, nimble hands passing the handhold above by quite a few nailsbreadths. When the assassin's body dropped raven locks surged around her right hand permitting the elf to grasp with but a singular hand. Shaking the one that was entangled in an attempt to free it, she held on for dear life with the other, legs flailing in fear at the present situation.\n\nHolding the ledge with a death grip, Kaddy forced herself to remain still, yet her heart rate took many blinks to comply. Meticulously she labored to liberate her wrist from the mesh of norsidian locks. Once free the nimble digits lifted to grasp the ledge, an audible sigh of reprieve escaping sensual lips while the elfess at last felt safe. With due haste the maiden glided over the balconies edge, poised catlike upon the railing. Had the elf maiden understood what she was doing, she would have recognized that her present stance was very revealing in the moonlight. Luckily for Kadence there were no guards about or any roving servants on the grounds.\n\nStepping gingerly down from the balustrade the elf maiden stooped near to the ground and began an approach painstakingly towards the open glass entry. A whispered footstep hidden by the fluttering of curtains as Kaddy crossed the threshold of her enemys room. The cold rasp of steel as the maid unsheathed the knife she had brought for the matter at hand. Amors figure could easily be discerned within her silken blankets. Ever precautious steps carried her nearer to her objective, coming at last to be perched to pounce upon the object of her disgust.\n\nKadence stood over Amordalia for a blink, letting the first blow land to the hilt in the throat. A gasp rolled from her target as Kaddy pulled the knife back in a wide arc for another strike. The other girl attempted to scream but only bubbling blood spewed forth. The elf lost all sense of control and attacked savagely, the second blow driving upwards into the others chin. Had the elfess had any guile in the acts she now committed, she would never have continued with a job already finished, however rage drove her onward. Leaned over the writhing form of Amor, Kaddy let forth a bestial growl and stared deeply into the others eyes. A twist of the knife in the girls throat caused a shower of gore to sprinkle about the beddings.\n\nA wicked grin crossed over the elfs delicate face as she leaned to whisper in Amors ear. Death is what I have given, a gift from me to you for all you have done. Tell the demons I have sent you, a soulless wench in life, now a lifeless soul to serve them. The stench of blood granted Kaddy a sense of euphoria, kissing the other on the cheek to hold the taste with her. Slipping the knife from the gapping wound the elfess listened intently for any resonance that may suggest others having heard the assault. Satisfied immensely at the sounds of the night, she quickly made her way from the home, using the same route she had entered through.\n\nÇhaÞer IV: Decadent Decline\n\nThe rise of Injera upon the next day brought an array of chaos for Kaddy. Though not proficient in the atrocious acts she had committed the night previous, the elf had covered her tracks with great care. Accusations flew about the city bringing a patrol of guards to the Ridlweaver home, every item the youthful maiden possessed was studied with immense scrutiny. Yet there was nothing found to prove Kadence was involved, but proof was not needed for other young Akváthrhím to pass judgment upon her.\n\nThose that had avoided the elf previously, now made every effort to remain distant from her. Even the intermittent envious insults ceased almost immediately, considering no others would dare to annoy Kaddy. Just because she was proclaimed to be innocent of the crime does not mean the heavy weight of suspicion had been lifted. All of the other socialites knew of the maidens level of poverty and her hatred for Amor meant only one thing. Kadence had carried the deed out with her own hands and proved to everyone the extent of desire in the elfs heart to rise above all others.\n\nWhat none of them understood was the impact the entire event had on such an adolescent soul. There was a feeling of sorrowfulness that was veiled behind emerald eyes that Kaddy on no account relayed to any other. The emotion would haunt the young elf for all days to come, some part of Kadence that seemed to have passed like the wind from the depths of her soul. Where once there was hope, love and desire now contained only greed, lust and disdain. At long last she had become all that her tribe personified.\n\nFree time was something Kaddy now became all too familiar with, though there were still suitors giving earnest chase to the sensual beauty. They were not even close to what the elf had been familiar with. Bird watching was the most frequent of the young elfs activities, intermingled with more time spent with her brother, Caranthir. Exploring the regions about their homeland and practicing the lessons of the sword taught to them by their father. Still her brothers fanciful reenactments of battles bored her to an extreme at most times. Their constant wandering from home opened a new world for the young elfess. There were varieties of avian creatures that she had never seen or barely glanced from afar. Kadence used her brothers natural propensity for exploration to drive their journeys every further from their home.\n\nÇhaÞer V: Death, a New Beginning\n\n1510 B.S. Wandering along the edges of The Stone Fields of Peat, Kaddy spotted an ash falcon in the distance. Not an extraordinary bird for the young elf to have detected but it seemed to be bringing prey to its fledglings. With amazing enthusiasm she prodded her brother to follow it for a time, leading the duo ever further into the fields. It was not the first time Caranthirs sister had led them into the region after some obscure animal that had caught the maidens fancy.\n\nTragedy entwined with misfortune would be the order of the day for the siblings. Kaddys wanderings had led them both deeply into the Stone Fields, far beyond their previous ventures. Caranthir had pleaded with his sister more than once to cease the chase and turn back. Yet the maiden had continuously convinced him to travel a bit further, a mistake that would leave them both in mortal danger. Hope remained when Kadence had found the nesting area of the ash falcon, icy green eyes fixated upon the bird with a fanatical interest.\n\nSundrown was in full force but the elf maiden was lost in her observations of the mother falcon and her two chicks. Even the rumble of stones falling from the cliff face near the duo did not rouse her attention. Only the half-word uttered from her brother finally caught her attention. Before she could turn to see what it was he had begun to complain about, the sound of crunching bone, mingled with a shower of gore coated the area between them. A giant! The blow from its club had virtually severed her brothers carcass in half.\n\nFight or flight?! Like there was an option for the youthful elf. Though she was equipped with her armblades/scimitars there was no expectation she could face such a brute. So, she scampered blindly, running in the opposite direction of the beast that had slain her brother. There was minute hope that she could outdistance such a monster, the terrain was rough to navigate and the creature seemed to know it well. Trickery and agility had saved her a sparse amount of times but luck was running out, death was approaching with no uncertainties.\n\nNearly exhausted from her flight a weird and wonderful twist of fate saved Kaddy, at least momentarily. A trip sent the elf spiraling down a deep crevice one near five ped deep. The opening to it very narrow not that it mattered as the impact of hitting the bottom knocked the wind from her. The fall coupled with her fatigue the youthful maiden accomplished rolling over before darkness overcame her dazzling form. No hint of the horrors of recent events seeped through to the unconscious elfs dreams; only oblivious shadows shrouded her psyche.\n\nÇhaÞer VI: Desolation to Dismay\n\nUnbeknownst to the elf how long she had laid there, only the pain of her ribcage granting the knowledge that she yet lived. Flashes of Caranthirs end flooded her mind, tears welling in emerald eyes as she broke into a complete breakdown. Each of the maidens sobs sent striking pains wracking all through her petite form. Anger and frustration forced Kaddy to rise upon aching elbows, inquisitive eyes surveying the damage to her body. Surprisingly there was sunlight filtering into the obscurity of her fissure.\n\nHad she been out all night or had it been longer, vagueness brought the elf to inspect her body more closely. Kaddy was hurt of this there were no qualms but no visible wounds could be seen; only the pains of her chest confirmed this. Thirst was an imminent concern already striking lips had begun to chap from lack of hydration. With enormous exertion she grasped her canteen, sipping from it with measured efforts. Although she desired to drain the contents the precious fluid was already scarce. Spending a few moments to listen intently to the world outside, only the sounds of gentle zephyrs over the stony landscape came to the elfess. This only brought optimism that the giant had moved on from his trapped prey.\n\nAlmond shaped eyes closed for a second time, originally to block out the horrific images of her brothers death but sleep soon followed. Sundrown was again setting in when Kaddy awoke an additional time. Though suffering she knew escaping the crevice was a must if the elf wished to live. Had she been in full health the climb out would have been childs play but her present health turned the undertaking into a struggle of epic proportions. Due to falling more than once she had nearly given up hope when finally her tiny digits found the lip of the fissure. With every ounce of strength Kadence could muster she rolled over the rim, gasping loudly at the shooting aches of her torso.\n\nDarkness soon fell over the near comatose elf as Kaddy sought some reserve of vigor. Enough to stand was the most the maiden could gather in the dark of night, she knew there was no chance to find her way. Caranthir had always been her guide and in the hasty retreat from the giant she had no chance to take note of direction. Life was the solitary gift she had left and she was not going to give up on it so simply. Staggering feet began to wander off in a random direction; she needed to find people, irregardless of whom. To be left in such a desolate place alone meant but a distinct realization for Kadence, death.\n\nFor nigh two days she wandered with no signs of anything but craggily stone and scattered rubble. Hunger conquered the elf as she then set about seeking a meal, not an easy task for someone with Kaddys upbringing. In the end she began to feast on vermin, mice, rats and the carcasses of dead animals. Such a living began to bring out the primal instincts of her people; she became more adept at hunting prey. The harsh life started to make quite the huntress out of the petite elf, after starvation had just about overcame her over the next few weeks.\n\nWhile searching for food in the early hours one morning, the assassin spotted a sight she had not wished for in quite sometime, grasslands! The wound from her fall still ached though only lightly; evidently whatever she had done was getting better. The maiden broke into a full sprint towards the promise of escape from this desolate land. Kadence knew there would be food more readily available and with any luck something more to drink than semi-stagnant rain water.\n\nÇhaÞer VII: Hopeful Atrocity\n\n1511 B.S. Once the elfess finally achieved the grasslands she fell to the ground weeping with joy. Never in her existence had Kaddy expected to find a manner of escape from The Stone Lands of Peat. In spite of the fact the maidens brother had not made the trek with her, she could only revel in the newfound anticipation of survival. Nimble fingers caressed the prairie similar to a lover stroking the cheek of their beloved. The smell and feel of it an exhilaration beyond words for the youthful maiden.\n\nAfter the initial wonder of finding the edge of the Stone Lands Kadence sought out small clusters of scrubland trees. Major boons for her as rabbits appeared to be abundant in these spots. Their canopy granted the elf shelter that she had lacked over the last month. With practice during the forthcoming days Kaddy learned to drop from low lying branches upon small prey. She had even been blessed enough to have found a fresh water stream permitting the elfess a bath for the first time in the neighborhood of a month. Still the youthful elf saw no signs of civilization yet her strength and fortitude had been greatly enhanced with what the maiden had already found.\n\nWeeks passed bye as she continually traveled larger distances in the pursuit for anyone or anything resembling inhabitants. A pathway that appeared to be heavily traveled by wagon and horse instantly caused the elf to move her campsite along its edge. Its distance was remote from the brook Kaddy needed so badly but she made the travel between them every other day. Crouched like a predatory cat in the waist high grassland she would linger for hours, ever observant along the roadway. Only a few hours each day would be depleted seeking out quarry to sustain the tiny girl. The desire to find companionship was an obsession for a socialite like the Akváthrhím.\n\nInjera had just crested the horizon as Kadence feasted upon a large rabbit a meal she had began to lose a taste for. But there was nothing else she could take down with her inadequate weapons. Pointed ears perked, what was that she had heard. Had the elfs solitude started to play tricks on her mind or did she perceive the sound of horses. Icy emerald eyes scanned the roadway with a primal intensity. Kaddys heart skipped a few beats as the appearance of five riders came into view over the high grass. Acute eyes instantly recognized that they were not elves. Whom or what could they be? The elf had been taught that there were no other races, other than the Akváthrhím. Only story books and mythology hinted at tribes outside of hers.\n\nNimble digits caressed the hilts of the lone weapons she possessed, praying there would be no need for them. The humans took modest time to cover the ground between Kaddys earliest sighting of them and her hiding place. The maiden recognized what they were on close inspection but how could this be true. Humans were nothing more than myths, like dragons and unicorns. Still Kadence had been unaccompanied far too long and wanted naught more than to hear the voices of someone other than herself. If only she had known what these men were, the elf would have exercised extremely more caution than she did.\n\nA sensual swagger carried the youthful elf to stand along the road as the men passed. They did not hesitate for more than a few blinks, as they brought their mounts to respite in a semi-circle around the gorgeous elf. Hello gentlemen. The few words spoken in elven, given that it was the only language that Kaddy could articulate. It seemed to Kadence that she had somehow made a joke as the words caused the men to laugh loudly. One of them finally slipped down from his saddle chatting to his fellows with his approach towards the elfess. The maiden never saw it coming but the hammer like fist smashed into the side of her delicate cheek. Darkness came in a blur as the elf felt blood pour from her mouth.\n\nÇhaÞer VIII: Forsaken Fate\n\nWhen the darkness had finally lifted from the elf maidens mind, she found herself bound and gagged on horseback. Strapped across the hindquarters of the mount, the man that had struck her guided. The taste of Kaddys own blood poignant and tart upon her palette, emerald eyes peered about with fear at the other men in the party. Long norsidian tresses obscured much of her view considering the uncomfortable position she was now in. Kadences return to consciousness seemed to have brought all of the men some amusement, as they pointed to her and chuckled.\n\nThroughout the days ride Kaddy gathered the names of her captors yet she knew the human she rode with more so. Gath was what the others continually called him and it was evident he was the man in charge. A long conversation between them all near sundrown seemed to the maiden, a discussion to make camp for the night. Not understanding much of what they said left the elf to continually guess at what their motives were. But it seems that her belief their stopping for the night was accurate. All of the men dismounted and began to unload various items from their saddlebags.\n\nGath undid the tethers holding Kadence to the horse casually rolling her off its back. She struck the ground forcefully but managed to rollover onto her back, assessing the others with great inquiry. The human followed the elf as she fell, one of his calloused hands caressing her cheek as he spoke softly to her. Cautiously he untied the gag about the elfs mouth permitting Kaddy an opportunity to snarl aggressively towards him. A swift open handed blow from the human quickly silenced her. Supple lips parted as she careened her head to one side, the blow she had just received caused nausea and she soon vomited.\n\nThankfully for the elf this was all the attention she had gotten for quite sometime. The humans set their campsite up and began to drink heavily; it appeared to Kaddy like they were having a party. Still they offered her no food or drink simply leaving her to rest near her own vomit. Time passed on ever-so-slowly but gradually some of the humans began to pass out yet a few of them still remained awake. About this time is when the nightmares of her situation started. Ardon a large burly man asked Gath a question the leader simply replied with a nonchalant wave of his hand.\n\nArdon approached the elf with a wicked grin on his face, leaning over he took a handful of raven locks and pulled her some peds into the trees. Untying her feet the man set about viciously raping the young elf, each time Kaddy fought back the man would savagely strike her. Until at last she had no more strength to resist, the event a blurred nightmarish haze, one that a few of the other men participated in until the wee hours of the night. When the sun rose once more the men did not even bother to dress Kadence leaving her covered in their drunken stench as they forced her to march along with them.\n\nÇhaÞer IX: Time Unwell Spent\n\nThe humans kept Kaddy with them for the next five years each day not unlike the first she had spent with them. Though the members of the traveling group changed frequently, Gath was ever present. He was the only one of the humans that had never participated in using the maiden as the others would. Luckily as time passed the brutality and frequency of their rapes subsided though never did they stop completely. Kadence had learned much during these years as she had many hours of free time outside of preparing meals and *servicing* the men on demand.\n\nWith time she started to know their language fairly well and it made things much easier on her. Knowing what to say and when to say it was a useful tool in turning horrid situations for the elf into better ones. At meal times she always kept the mens tankards full of ale, the drunker humans got the less likely they were to be aggressive towards her. Gath led the group from town to town selling their services as swords for hire, occasionally using Kaddy as a bartering chip to seal deals. Still each and every night she would be bound and gagged leaving her no chance of escape.\n\nHer revulsion for these humans far outstretched any feeling of abhorrence she had kept within her previously. But she found with a mastery of their language that she could make them laugh easily. When any of them would start to become irritated at Kaddy, she would fall into a plethora of antics, quite frequently altering the mood entirely. She quickly learned new twists to the jokes they would tell about the fires in early evening, astounding most with a twisted sense of humor. Though captivating beauty, intellect and a pervasive sense of humor saved her many hours of suffering, they did not save Kadence from them all.\n\nA warm summers day gave the elf a rare chance to spend sometime alone, well as alone as they would permit her. Emerald hued eyes studying the one thing she had left close to her heart, birds. Gaths near continuous travels had granted the maiden some rare chances to study species she had never witnessed before. Nimble fingers flippantly running through norsidian tresses as she watched them inquisitively. Savagely her hair was grasped from behind pulling the maiden to lay flat on her back. A newer member of the traveling party, Dazdin, one that had seemed uninterested in Kaddys doings held her firmly to the ground.\n\nWench you sit about playing with your hair! I have my own needs and you are not meeting them! A knife flashed in the mans hand as he began to hack away the elfs flowing tresses. Savagely Kaddy lashed out with clawed fingers, leaving deep gashes over the eyes of Dazdin. He struck Kadence hard across the face with a white knuckled fist. The maiden knew when humans did this that they were beyond anything words could fix. So she lay still, feigning fear and a willingness to serve. No, no master forgive me I implore you. The words flowing with fear covered in a shower streaming of tears. She was raped again, the man left her sprawled in the remnants of her clothes, kicking her in the ribcage before he departed.\n\nÇhaÞer X: Vengeful Vagrant\n\nRape was a horrible aspect of Kaddys life, violent degrading comments were commonplace but the destruction of her beauty was the most heinous act to date. She had formulated a plan over the years for an escape but had never gathered the fortitude to carry it out. The severing of her abundant locks granted the elf the last reserves of her strength. Kadence would kill them; she would kill them all then flee. All it required was for them to stop near a town and then the plot would begin to play out.\n\nIt did not take more than a few weeks for them to arrive at a port town. Kaddy had never learned the name of the places she had visited; they never granted her the freedom to explore such ventures. Irregardless the moment had come for her plan to approach a tragic end, for the humans. The men seemed excessively joyous to be within sight of civilization again, so the elf played on it. Overly flirtatious she wandered amongst them telling quaint but seductive puns. Pouring excessive amounts of ale adding shots of Milno fire as the men became oblivious to what they drank.\n\nThe wee hours of the night came and all but one of the men had passed into drunken stupors. The plan was perfect other than the reality that Gath was still awake, time was running short. Approaching him to beg for Kaddys share of food for the night, the leader granted it to her, casting a dismissive wave towards the fire. Lithe hands grasped the knife near the hog and carved a hefty portion for her meal. Placing the ham on a platter she held the knife behind her dainty back, returning to sit obediently at Gaths feet.\n\nForcing a blissful smile upon the elfs supple lips when she would peer over a petite shoulder at *master*. The nod of the humans head was all it took for the maiden to strike, she sprung upon him like a jungle cat. The knife drove deeply into the base of the humans throat, the wound more than enough to muffle his dying gasps. Kaddy knew he held the key to the lockbox containing a treasure trove of wealth. But there were other orders of business to be handled first. Silent footsteps carried the elfess about the encampment, pausing only long enough to spill the lifeblood from her captors.\n\nSupple lips slid along the length of the knife, now covered in a mixture of her subjugators blood. It tasted sweet to the elf, savoring the flavor as it meant one thing for Kaddy. Freedom from the torment of these beasts, though she had nowhere to go, she was at least free to make the decisions herself. The knife was tossed aside as she returned to the corpse of Gath, hastily scouring his body for the key. With its retrieval she went to his belongings and took out the large chest. Upon opening it she found what she had desired and so much more. The blades of Kadences father were still contained there and a small fortune in goldbards nearly a hundred of them.\n\nFilling the saddlebags with much of the chests contents she saddled a horse and rode swiftly towards the town. She knew it was full of the sickening humans as well, but there was little choice. Though these humans would be her prey as she was now the hunter not the hunted. Five years of torture at their hands would not go without retribution. Blood would be spilled for she had centuries to hunt them. Their pitiful minds could not fathom beyond tomorrow let alone a quest spanning the lives of their children and grandchildren.\n\nKain Cristar\n\nDivine Aspect\n\nApproved Character\n\nOffline\n\nGender:\n\nPosts: 557\n\nElf, Co'orhem Kayrrhem\n\n« Reply #7 on: December 29, 2006, 01:27:32 PM »\n\nKain will try and give some pointers, though by the sound of it, you are already fairly put together. Search out my comments in a dull and lifeless gray\n\nName: Kadence Ridlweaver\n\nNicknames and aliases: Kaddy the Heckler amongst the crowds she performs for. Ladyhawke has been given to her by the people of Ciosa because of her importing, exporting and training of birds. This name extends outside the borders of Ciosa and has brought many a customer from afar.\n\nType: Assassin-Jester\n\nGender: Female\n\nRace: Elf\n\nTribe: Akváthrhím A difficult tribe to roleplay, considering their circumstances and beliefs\n\nAge: 187 Age by Appearance: 27\n\nSkills and Training: Assassin-Swordswoman / Equivalent to a human 38 years of age, though more in depth. This doesn't need to be here, but I won't tell you to take it away\n\nApproximate lifespan: 400 Years\n\nEye Color: Icy emerald green There is a nice set of santharian colors on-site, and if you want to get into detail, I would suggest using them. Icy emerald, what is that?\n\nHair Color: Medium length norsidian Nice, though its slightly repetive to put in the black, nor'sidian is never anything but black black\n\nHeight: 1.8 Ped (A bit short for her tribe. 510)\n\nWeight: 119 Od (Near 119lbs.)\n\nTitle: Bitter Jester\n\n ÷  Descripion  ÷ \n\nMedium length norsidian locks surge over her lithe and muscular shoulders, thick silky tresses flowing down her tiny back, ending at near two palmspans beneath her supple neckline. Kadence has not altered this style of cut in over a century; she has no intention of changing this \"changing it now\" might flow better. It is extremely perceptible that she is a exceedingly vain over about her appearance. Often times her black mane is tied by a crimson kari'krimson is the santharian term and golden hairpiece, into a ponytail that comes to rest just between her lithe shoulder blades. This permits the elf a wide angle of vision when performing, stalking, and murdering the innocent.\n\nGreen eyes peer out from her porcelain like face, their coloring a shade of jade ice. Many times she has used this somewhat mystifying hue to aid in the capture of her audience. If stared into, many have said there is an ancientness swirling in them and a feeling of darkness gathered in their depths. Kadence has time and again used makeup about them, causing their chilly surface to appear almost radiant. The radiance counteracts your mention of darkness, unless you radiate darkness. Also, a better way to put that sentence would be \"Ka'dence often uses paints and oils to excentuate these features, casing their chilly surface to appear almost radiant.\" paints and oils could of course be replaced with \"makeup\" i simply don't like how the term flows, the term excentuate (sp?) helps you tie into your last sentence.\n\nHer pale elven face is the the picturesque image of an Akváthrhím elf. Her high cheekbones, unblemished pallid skin, and her radiant green eyes are all indications of her people. The overall shape of her face, coupled with a mischievious fanged smile can easily be compared to a grinning carnivore. Her narrow lips often times painted in a deep crimson or golden color, a habit she has gained from performing for so many years. If evil has elegance to it, then Kaddy would be perfect to fill its role. For she is often beaming brightly when a melodic tune rolls easily from well trained lips, this conceals the foul and dark being lurking in the depths of a gorgeous visage. awkward last sentence\n\nA whimsical jest is always upon her lips, more than a few few what? times? people? toungues? feet? akin the sounds of her voice to frozen chimes carried upon the zephyrs of early mornings in Cyhalloi. Most of her jests, songs and stories draw a great deal of attention from those about her, Kadences skill in the entertainment arts are very evident. Especially when combined with a chatterbird in the knitting of a tale, performing a great ballad or carrying a whimsical melody as she travels.\n\nShéntelór (Styrásh for New Song) is a constant companion of Kadence in recent travels. The beautiful chatterbird or psitta, as they are more commonly known, is ever-present flittering about overhead. The back feathers of this avian are a shimmering emerald, while under wing and tail the feathering is a shiny dark red. Kaddy and the bird are constantly jesting with one another in attempts to perfect their performances together. To those that pay attention the two appear to be conversing in three languages. Yet in truth they are only practicing with dedication their ever expanding repertoire of acts. As long as you realize that this bird is simply a bird and is not sentient, that this is cool with me\n\nMost times she wears robes over her other clothing, The garment is made of an obsidian black cloth with a flowing cowl that frequently veils Kadences eyes in deep shadow. When the cowl is laid back it is apparent why it is designed in such a way. No normal sized cowl would contain her abundance of obsidian tresses that spill out when it is lowered. For those that have not seen her face before, the lowering of the cowl has caused them to be a bit shocked. The raven hue of her locks, porcelain colored skin and icy hued eyes are in stark contrast to the dark background of this drab clothing.\n\nWhen the flowing robes are removed, strong and wiry muscles can be seen enveloping her 1.8 ped form in a revelation of endurance and health. For half a century she traveled a nomadic lifestyle amongst the lands she had escaped to, coupled with near a century and a half long tutelage amongst an elite group of assassins. Many decades have been spent traveling for her brethren on errands, practicing stealth and spreading her works as a jester. The weight of her chosen weapons being carried throughout her long travels has kept Kaddy in amazing physical health.\n\nShe does not drink alcohol ever, would scoff at smoking any types of tobacco, maybe even a bit fickle about others doing this and eats a regiment of natural foods sources at all times. The elf prefers walking, many times doing so instead of more conventional modes of transportation. She is no fool about such things though; she would ride a horse for far distances or a boat over vast waters. I've noticed that you seem to wander in these passages into a different topic. This particular paragraph belongs in your personality section\n\nA coat made of soft leather, is designed in a black and cobalt striped motif that covers the elf from just above pale bosom to her supple waist. A tiny stud upon the left breast of the jacket is a jewel in the shape of a cobalt heart, the golden background behind the heart sets many an eye upon it. A large, singular, golden ring is set into the base of the front v-pattern of the tight fitting garment. A strap of weaved woven from beads the colors sky blue, cobalt and azure in a striped pattern stretch over each elegant shoulder, adding a hint of color to the dark jacket. Another strap of cobalt beads is attached to the coat just below each armpit, the straps resting just below her shoulder on each arm, revealing the maiden's supple shoulders. Tapering into flowing white sleeves tied firmly at the wrists with azure leather straps, the threads holding these together are cobalt in color.\n\nKadence wears a black sash tied about a tiny waist this covers the top her breeches yet underlies the leather jacket. A large key ring on the murderer's supple left hip is attached to the sash. There are eight keys on the ring at all times, five of them are to bird cages at home and the other three are blanks. Kaddy has two other copies of these keys at home. One is in the possession of her servant, colleague and friend while the other is stored in a footlocker a bit of a modern term, \"small chest\" would be better at home\n\nSkintight norsidian hued leather breeches cover her sinuous but well-muscled legs, revealing much of her porcelain like stomach with a very low-cut front. The leathery stitches holding these breeches together are deep cobalt in color and run down the outside of each leg. A thin leather belt is run through the blue loops that circumvent the waistline of this garment. Though this item is often hidden beneath the flowing sash worn about her supple waist, a garrote is usually hung from a clip to the rear left of this belt. The assassin does enjoy the sounds of strangling victims when the opportunity presents itself.\n\nThe elf is adorned with few other accessories, a pair of black low-cut leather boots are often times on her feet. A set of black leather gloves can sometimes be noticed upon nimble fingers. On her supple neck rests a golden necklace, with a single blue stone set like a tear at the base of the v-shape and a solitary mint green stone as the centerpiece of it in the front. A double strand of beads is woven into Kadences wavy black tresses just above each pointy ear. The length of the strands ride at just above the base of her skull behind her elven head. This is used to keep lengthy locks from falling over her eyes when removed from a ponytail. The necklace and hair beads are always worn no matter the guise she is traveling in.\n\nA leather sheath is rested between powerful shoulder blades. Two obsidian armblades, a few nailsbreadths over a ped in length are in this scabbard. The hilts of these blades are done in a complex setup; allowing Kaddy to attach them to her wrists similar to a standard armblade. This permits the jester freedom of her hands to manipulate objects or to climb freely while remaining armed. Or the elf can attach standard hilts like a common sword and wield them as such. Melorvévan (The name meaning: Shadowbird in Styrash) is the weapon Kadence wields in her left hand, much of the blades length is serrated and is her weapon of choice in close conflicts; she enjoys the weapons talon like wounds. Móhecuá (The name meaning: Darkbreaking in Styrash) is the name of the murderers second armblade, and is only definable as different from Melorvévan in that is has no serrated edge. Both of them are effective when used from the shadows upon unsuspecting foes, just how the assassin likes to engage in combat. I am having trouble imagining how this would work, unless the last blade could detach from the other two somehow and become a singular shortsword?.\n\n ÷  Personalîy  ÷ \n\nHer demeanor teems with energy, a person that is in a constant state of motion. Which for Kadence is true literally and figuratively, often times lost in song and revelry or just pondering and studying the world about her. Add to this that she is a consummate bird trainer and is always busy training one or more than one. Her life would look like it is utterly filled with things she is doing or things yet to be done. Most people never realize that through all the chaos and jokes, she is most likely studying a simpler course to her next prey.\n\nHunting other sentient beings does have its adverse effects upon a person and Kadence is a prime example of a murderous person. For a century and a half she has served as a killer of sentient beings, there's a lot of blood upon nimble hands. Few can properly understand the demonic sense of humor Kaddy must have to do her job. This ideology has left the elf with almost no friends only having those that perceive themselves as friends. If a bounty she was ordered to take were upon her closest friend it would be performed without question and most likely done with sadistic glee.\n\nA liar of epic proportions; nearly her entire life has been a lie. One that Kadence has built upon so much that she no longer recalls who she really is beneath the façade. Kaddy lies out of hand, doing so frequently; most of the words she speaks to others are at least partially a lie. If not a full blown deception meant to manipulate and harm those she wishes to. The only time anyone could be sure that the assassin speaks the truth is to her fellow Akváthrhím and those she has threatened. The jester's threats are never made lightly and have always ended in the untimely demise of those the elf has warned.\n\nKadences cover as a jester is a paradox; she is a fun loving and joyous person to everyone about her. Yet behind this veil the girl is a cold and heartless creature with no cares for the lives of anyone. On more than one occasion she has performed for an audience only to murder patrons as they walked the dark streets afterwards. Kaddy sees it as a Karii wrote: \"To look into her eyes was to see the moon, into her face to see darkness. And to look at her blade was the greatest epiphany; to see the delivery of yourself standing before Queprur, bare of all but your deeds in life and your fears of death.\" This little rhythm has and frequently does bring a blissful smile to her supple lips. In fact it is one passage she has taught all of her personal song birds (Chatterbird / Psitta) to quote in three languages.\n\n ÷  Srenghs  ÷ \n\nShe is very adept in the arts of stealth; her natural swiftness coupled with Kadences ability to manipulate those of the opposite sex. Only enhances the elfs ability to get close to those she has targeted. Roughly two centuries of these practices have taught the maiden the finer arts of slyness on a daily bases. Watching, waiting, listening and striking from the shadows are a way of life for the murdering elf.\n\nThe wealth she has acquired over the decades would be considered a good strength. Kadence could easily do no more than train, breed, and deal in the trade of birds while living a life of relative comfort. On top of this she is a consummate assassin that is paid handsomely for her work. Still a portion of the elf's ill gotten wealth is spent on the wages of her personal bird handlers that also work in Kaddy's shop Ladyhawkes Aerie in Ciosa. She can speak four languages fluently and one decently well, this adds great prestige when one teaches a chatterbird to speak and sing in its masters language.\n\nShe speaks: Styrash, Tharian, Ylffer, KhomchrOm and speaks the trade language of Thergermin. Ylffer is only taught to her own personal birds because Kadence must spend alot of one on one time with the animal. Without the distractions of other languages interfering, due to different handlers, for none of her handlers know this tongue. The jester teaches no more than two languages to any one bird, rare is the occasion that she has found one capable of conversing in three. These being the ones Kaddy would keep for herself and integrate into performance acts.\n\nA melodious voice; her grandmother taught her the basics of musical representation. She has spent almost a century perfecting her songs and training them to her animals. Small excursions spent within the city of Bardavos have enhanced her musical skills to a presentable level. This lengthy practice is apparent in her acts as a jester, storyteller and bird handler. Many a small town or settlement around Ciosa recognize the jester on sight and welcome her arrival. Kaddy's natural propensity for music can be heard in her magnificent voice. The elf could have been a singer of great renown had she obtained formal teachings as was the dream of Eáránë.\n\nYou should mention her skills with a weapon and think about her as you might rp her, what other strengths will you use. Will she be hardy in battle, does she make \"friends easily\" Those are just simple examples, but thoughts none the less\n\n ÷  Weaknesses  ÷ \n\nA maelstrom of seething anger that borders on homicidal simmers frequently behind the elfs grinning visage. Kaddy has been known to launch into a swarm of claw racks and bites on those that have displeased the assassin. This tension builds gradually in the jester, especially when things are not revolving solely about her or business dealings have been tense. Though this has granted the assassin an escape route through surprise on more than one occasion, it is no way a deadly barrage. Hence she has left behind many that harbor enormous animosity towards her. Not something she finds enjoyable as a few of these enemies are trained killers, criminal organizations and ruffians from all walks of life.\n\nShe is utterly infatuated with all things avian most times spending a small fortune on literature and paintings of birds. When she first notices a new species, exquisite painting or a species of bird she has not watched previously she becomes nearly zealous in her observations of them. During these times she will ignore most of the significant things about her and follows the subject solely. The only time she can remain focused upon her work is if she is on a mission given to her by her murderous brethren. She has even been known to postpone musical performances in pursuit of an elusive bird.\n\nMuch of Kadences life has been spent living a lie; of course this is a natural thing for a habitual liar. This has left her with almost no friends and even fewer that she calls friend. Her friends number no more than a handful, the bird handlers of her shop, Grogan the dwarven merchant and the contacts she has within the underworld of Ciosa. Yet most of these are nothing more than superficial friendships she uses as a cover in the city. Grogan would be her one and only true friend, the dwarfs business relationship and avian knowledge have forged a true friendship with Kaddy. The dwarf would be the only person that she would feel any remorse for killing. Yet Grogan has never been a subject of interest for extermination, she has shared all of her knowledge of the dwarf with her fellow assassins. It is only that the merchant has no bearing in the assassins agenda that has kept their friendship on purely a personal level.\n\nThe elfess is highly xenophobic when dealing with humans in general. She gets along well with some people in Ciosa only due to the century spent amongst them. But as a rule of thumb she is contemptuous towards humans of other tribes, this being a carry over from her days of abuse at the hands of human mercenaries. This can be noticed in her public performances where she will often times play out her stories, songs or ballads to nonhuman patrons first and foremost. When traveling with merchant caravans or in a large city Kadence will distance herself from most humans only warming up to a few over long periods. This attribute has caused tension for her on more than one occasion and blood to be spilled frequently. Her lack of great weapon skills makes this attitude she carries, life threatening at times.\n\nHere is how I see your setup. You are stealthy and well armed, a trained assassin, a wealthy and talented buisness woman, an astoundingly beautiful woman who knows how to use her looks to her advantage, and a talented entertainer. To balance these stengths out you have chosen to be ravenously violent spendthrift who doesn't have a lot of friends and dislikes humans. Many of your weaknesses find themselves overcome by your strengths. You don't have alot of friends, but you know how to manipulate people to do your bidding. Unless you have psychological ramifications from your lonelyness which hinder you in some way, I fail to see your weakness. You spend alot of money, but have a large fortune to spend, and have the ability to easily make more money if you run low. You are violent and start fights, but you also are a trained killer, and can end fights in your favor. You obsessively follow rare birds, but not enough that you would disrupt a mission. Really you are not that unbalanced, but here are some things that I see. Your tribe is beyond xenophobic, and I wonder less why you dislike humans, and more why you tolerate everyone else. You state that you are not well trained with your weapons, yet you are a trained assassin? Some thoughts, nothing more\n\n ÷  Occupaions  ÷ \n\nKaddy has a list filled with things she is doing, has done or needs to be done. When she is not traveling she spends a lot of time running Ladyhawkes Aerie in Ciosa. Most weekends and early evenings she sets about outlying providences guised as Kaddy the Heckler. More than a few people call her Kaddy when they visit Ladyhawkes a charming shop and apartment not far from the Ports of Ciosa. The basis of the business idea were founded on her passionate love of birds. The jester is sometimes approached for after hour work while tending her shop, the more pristine the gathering the more likely Kadence will attend. She also created Ladyhawkes Aerie because this port city is a hub of traveling information. The Aerie is located a few blocks from the docks which is a great place for gathering details from fellow mercenaries. It serves as a stable homebase for her travels as the jester, weaseling her way into upper class gatherings, only to murder one of the patrons or to absorb knowledge and pass it on to fellow assassins.\n\n ÷  Hisory  ÷ \n\nKadence Ridlweaver was born in the year 1479 B.S. on the second Elfday in the month of Molten Ice. Her family not of the highest noble standards of the Akváthrhím, brought Kadence into a life of near poverty. (Due to her mothers horrible burning that left the elf maid unable to grow hair in certain patches. This tragedy was vastly life changing for her kin, in a tribe prizing beauty above all things.)\n\nImmediate Family\n\nMother: Eáránë, once a prominent socialite amongst the Akváthrhím an accident over two centuries distant left these aspirations behind. Over the coming times, after the accident, she became fairly well known for her ability to apply complex dye patterns on most garments. Keeping the family still closely associated with some families of great renown but far behind their hopes.\n\nFather: Círdan, a picturesque male of his tribe and a practiconer in the arts of the sword. These arts had long since become nothing more than dances of beauty as the tribe has no need for true combat in their near utopian society Utopian?. More than a bit of his time was spent teaching these dances to his children. A man destined to not remain amongst the travesty of his present life, more than one female of the tribe would welcome his attentions.\n\nBrother: Caranthir, only a decade older than Kadence they are extremely close, or were before his untimely death. (More mention of this topic in this section.) He spent many hours with his father and carried an unusually strong bond with him. This rivaled a level of hero worship as the boy would spend countless hours listening to tales of his fathers life.\n\nI'm too tired to go on, but will finish in the morning, nice CD! She reminds me a bit of a prissy Ne'iav'rine"
