        "text": "Thank you so much for doing this with us! Our readers would love to get to know you a bit better. Can you tell us the story of how you grew up?\n\nI was born in New York City. I grew up in a very musical, multicultural household. My Mother was an international singer and pianist, Sylvia Copeland, and my father is an Italian immigrant. My parents met in acting school. My father wanted to be an actor at first and became Herbert Bergoff’s assistant at HB Studios in Greenwich village. My Mother worked in-between summer stock, broadway productions and international performances and looked to sharpen her acting with the great Uta Hagen. Herbert Bergoff put my parents as scene parents because my mother was always over the top and my father’s acting was completely understated. They did one scene and the next thing you know my sister was born.\n\nBoth my sister and I were raised in an artistic environment from the start. I was told by my mother the only time I would kick in her womb was when she was playing piano. She said my timing was impeccable and placed bets that I would be either a drummer or a tap dancer.\n\nI was born right into my career. I was told I came in second to landing the Pampers Diaper account. The reason I lost the job is because I, for the first time, listened to my mother. We went in for the call back- she told me to behave, and for the first time I did…I lost the job. They wanted a baby that didn’t behave at all. At the ripe age of 18 months I decided to take control of my life and listen to no one ever again when it came to behaving.\n\nFrom three years old, I had piano, drums and voice training. Some people think this to be harsh, but I loved it. I wasn’t very popular at school. My parents had moved us to the suburbs of New Jersey, and being a biracial child in a completely white neighborhood wasn’t very welcoming at that time. I was fair skinned but had a completely out of control mane for hair. My sister was dark olive and looked like she was from India…so the neighborhood kids quickly knew the story. I found myself getting chased and beaten weekly by the neighborhood boys. So, I really enjoyed the time training for the performing arts. It was the only place that accepted me. I was never “good enough” to be in the school plays…but somehow I was working off Broadway in a play singing a show stopping number to Chase Palminteri.\n\nI had an amazing childhood, we spend most of our days in New York City at my Uncle’s tap studio. We used that as the hub for training, hanging out between auditions, and of course jumping in and out of tap classes. My uncle was the Tony Award-winning Henry LeTang. As a kid I watched everyone come in and out of the studio, from Gregory Hines, Debbie Allen, Nicholas Brothers, all the greatest of the greats. Between my mother and my uncle Henry, me, my sister and my cousin Trisha were dragged to every broadway show that was appropriate for kids. My favorites were watching the ones my uncle choreographed. We all then ended up getting booked to work on the movie Cotton Club.\n\nWe stayed on set for almost a year as the film ran over budget. I got the biggest check I’d ever seen as my mother would quickly remove them from my hands and put them into savings. I was a jazz drummer, my sister a cotton club tap dancer, my mother worked on musical arrangements for the tap numbers and my uncle choreographed 22 numbers. It was awesome. Like I said, my childhood was great, even when I would spend some holidays with my father’s Sicilian parents with their very broken English. They were war survivors, they spent many years in the thick of it as war refugees, so they were the kind of people who were grateful every day to be alive. They weren’t happy about my mother being African American BUT they couldn’t have loved me and my sister more. We were spoiled when we were with them. They lived in an Italian neighborhood in Brooklyn. It was the opposite of being in my mother’s environment but it was amazing.\n\nCan you share a story with us about what brought you to this specific career path?\n\nMy mother passed when I was 14. My life was suddenly split between the total opposite lifestyles, cultures, religions and ideas of how a woman should be positioned for life. It was a mess, and whenever I described the mess to others, including a therapist, they laughed.\n\nI never wanted to do stand up, I was determined to continue in the footsteps of the serious show business that I was being prepared for. Clinging to my early childhood on a film set, I decided to go to the School of Visual Arts. And I decided to go audition for Herbert Bergoff’s class. If he though I had a shot in front of the camera maybe I’d try it. He left me in his class and after ripping every student to shred for weeks, I did my first scene and got my first on stage laugh, I didn’t even know what I did…which made it even funnier. Herbert compared me to a young Barbra Streisand. From then on, I worked on acting and character work. I started to write a script about living between these crazy families and dealing with identity. A classmate took me to a comedy club to try it. It worked and I never left. If the jokes stopped working, I went back again and again until they did.\n\nCan you tell us the most interesting story that happened to you since you began your career?\n\nI was bouncing back and forth between the comedy segregation line between mainstream clubs and the black comedy rooms. I got a call from Barry Katz asking if I wanted to do my first television appearance. I quickly said yes. He then said it’s “Showtime at Apollo”. I said “OOOO”. He said it’s $800. I had never gotten paid before nor had I been on television. I went back to the club and told my fellow comedians what I said yes to. They said you better make them laugh because that crowd will boo you and they will air the boo on national television. I have been booed a million times at Uptown Comedy Club in Harlem…almost every night but never for $800. I practiced and practiced which meant I went to every club that would boo comedians for a few weeks then tested the set at the worst club in the country, the legendary Peppermint Lounge in east Orange NJ. This was Bill Bellamy’s room. This was the room that they’d audition the comedians for Def Comedy Jam. It’s been said that people have pulled guns on comedians in this club. I boldly marched on that stage to test my set and surprisingly had a standing ovation. I was ready for the Apollo… but can anyone truly be ready for the Apollo?\n\nI entered the legendary Apollo, I saw the cameras swinging into place, I heard echos of the audience filing in, I felt the soul of its legendary performers as I looked at the stage. Later, I’m coming out of makeup when I see the crew scrambling cause a fight breaks out in the balcony, its two women and one guy slugging it out. The police are called in, but the police enter the room from the stage…they are white police. The audience starts to boo the police. Steve Harvey runs on stage to stop the booing and the audience turns and boos Steve Harvey. The stage manager pushes on a magician. The audience watches 3 tricks then they start booing the magician while shouting “he’s a fake, we saw how he did it!!”. Then I hear “Quick get the comedian”. The crew shuffles me to the stage, Harvey announces me. I walk on, starting in on my routine..”I’m so confused, I’m half Italian and half black…” the room instantly starts to boo. I see hands waving and pointing off the stage. People start shouting “get this white b*tch off the stage!” I, out of nowhere, roar the words “shut the hell up!” And they did. And I will tell you it was the longest 10 seconds of them looking at me and me looking at them, both surprised. I then continued my set and got a standing ovation.\n\nIt has been said that our mistakes can be our greatest teachers. Can you share a story about the funniest mistake you made when you were first starting? Can you tell us what lesson you learned from that?\n\nI can share a story about a big mistake, but I don’t know how funny it is. When I first started I decided to challenge myself to make the first digital documentary on stand up comedy and my experiences in comedy. It had a cast of almost every name in comedy: George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Kevin James, Phyllis Diller, Norman Lear, Whoopi Goldberg and many many more. I wrote, directed and edited it myself, I was in my early 20s. My father paid for it. It got rave reviews in Variety and the NY Times from the festival circuit. An older comedian who had introduced me to some celebrities and saw the first rough cut said he didn’t want his name attached to the film. By the time he saw my final cut he changed his mind and wanted to be my executive producer of the already finished film. I gratefully said, “of course.” Then his manager sent me over a contract which took the copyright from me. When I told my manager and father about the contract and how I wanted to run it past a lawyer, they told me I was being “difficult!” and that even though I personally took two years of my life for every frame of this film that I needed to not make trouble and sign the contract. Doubting my inner instinct, I signed it. They ended up turning down a theatrical release and burying my work. It took me a decade to get the rights back. By the time I did, I was too tired to let the world see it.\n\nSo the advice here is, Trust your instincts, even when family is telling you not to. Don’t be afraid to fight for what’s yours. Don’t devalue yourself or your work.\n\nActually, recently, a Hollywood higher up asked, “by the way, how much did you sell that copyright for?” I said, “wait you mean…that was worth money?”\n\nNone of us are able to achieve success without some help along the way. Is there a particular person who you are grateful towards who helped get you to where you are? Can you share a story about that?\n\nYes. I quit comedy for a decade because I stood up for myself in a very male oriented business. I am a domestic violence survivor. I stopped believing in myself. I was getting shut down out of work for a long time and then I believed that I had zero shot of starting over. I was filming an event and met Robert Townsend. We talked even though I was considered the hired help. He kindly asked me to Facebook him some of my stand up. I did. He then called me and cussed me out for like 30 minutes for quitting. Then he started showing up with a business plan for me to get back on my feet as a comedian. He encouraged me to write 3 specials. He went over them with me over and over, editing my writing and even rehearsing material with me. He demanded that I stop the negative thinking and do a “brain scrub” he called it. He made me write 100x in the morning and 50x at night “I am a winner and I always win” and “I expect good things to happen to me”. It changed everything. My career has completely been restored and my spirit and strength and trust in myself which includes loving my art again. I am forever grateful.\n\nYou have been blessed with great success in a career path that can be challenging. Do you have any words of advice for others who may want to embark on this career path, but seem daunted by the prospect of failure?\n\nYou can’t anticipate the future. Being daunted by failure, is trying to anticipate the future. That’s like wanting to drive a car but needing an exact plan of all that’s coming at you on the road. It will only clutter your brain if you are worried about running into everything. You need to just flow. Set your GPS and flow. If you worry about failure, you will freeze and then end up in a crash. Even when I’m on stage, someone can boo, someone can not laugh, I even watched a fight break out mid show…if you learn to roll with it and not worry about failing…you will land on your feet.\n\nEvery industry iterates and seeks improvement. What changes would you like to see in the industry going forward?\n\nI would like for the business of comedy to be a more respectful environment. Or at the very least- if the male comics feel like they can dish it out to the female comics,..if we snap back and our comeback is funnier than yours…don’t get your panties in a bunch and try to get us fired. I think that in my art form it’s a boys club and with that comes a lot of masking some awful behavior. If a female doesn’t respond the way they want, they are labeled as “they can’t take a joke”, then called problematic and you might end up fired. Once, I was brought on stage by a male comic who introduced me to the audience, by mentioning my accomplishments but by saying I “strapped on a dildo and f***ed him in the ass”. Not a single person working the club that night came to my defense in any way. A friend asked me why don’t I report him to management or rip him from the stage. The answer is because I learned the hard way…when I was a new comedian I would stand up for myself and snap back on them while on stage and then I would be removed and ousted. I learned to just keep my eyes on the job of getting the audience on my side and trying to salvage my stage time. The comedian who did this shall remain nameless…not because I’m not mentioning him in the article, he just wasn’t funny enough for me to even remember his name.\n\nYou have such impressive work. What are some of the most interesting or exciting projects you are working on now? Where do you see yourself heading from here?\n\nI made a comedy feature years ago, Bitter Jester. I would love to have it re-released with all its footage. I am currently working on the script for a new comedy feature that I am looking forward to directing in the near future. I have my comedy special on Amazon Prime and I am in pre-production for my next special.\n\nWe are very interested in looking at diversity in the entertainment industry. Can you share three reasons with our readers why you think it’s important to have diversity represented in film and television? How can that potentially affect our culture and our youth growing up today?\n\nBeing black and Italian, I go by the theory that people are not alike. People try to act like we are always alike. What’s wrong with being different? We come from completely different worlds and that is interesting. Great art is letting go and letting magic happen… when you diversify not only does the gold happen, but then you reach more people, and lift spirits around the world. But that only can happen when artists create experiences for themselves with more people. When it’s forced, it’s not authentic. I think all artists, writers and filmmakers, producers, should travel, and break bread with all kinds of people. In my family we have everybody, and to me it just makes every holiday much more interesting.\n\nWhat are your “5 things I wish someone told me when I first started” and why?\n\n1. Don’t work against yourself by putting yourself down. Don’t be your worst enemy. The other day I came out of yoga class, the first thing I wanted to say about myself was negative “Maija, you are so fat you can’t even do the posture” or “Maija, you go to one class and never go back, because you are inconsistent” or “Maija, you didn’t do this posture right”…I stopped myself and had to just say “Maija, you did it, you went to yoga, you did your best, be grateful”…leave yourself alone. The blessing is I made it through. That’s the healing. Don’t complain and put yourself down. It doesn’t help. Speak only good things to yourself.\n\n2. Failure isn’t personal, your formula is wrong, it’s okay to rework your formula. Some formulas you can only figure out by trial and error. So don’t take failure personally. I used to go on stage and get booed. The first time I got booed I beat myself up for a week. I finally would stop reacting to it. I’d just look closer at what I was doing and work to fix it and ask healthy questions..where was the hiccup and what could be improved?\n\n3. Always take a weekend, even if it’s in the middle of the week. There are times I would work every day for 6 months. I thought that’s what gets it done. In the long run, it just kills your joy and stamina. Your mind works clearer when you leave yourself alone.\n\n4. Trust yourself. I spent years asking people, mostly people I knew more than, for answers and then built up resentment because they couldn’t give me the answers I needed. The answers were inside of me, I just didn’t trust myself. I look back on my body of work and realize…I was ahead of the curve. You can’t judge what you’re doing by others. You don’t know where the others are at.\n\n5. It’s not fair, it’s never fair and it’s okay. It’s not about making everything fair. It’s about surviving life’s roller coaster. I have spent a lot of time getting stuck, cause I thought things should be a certain way. It drains your energy. Life is like football, you wanna get in the end zone, you gotta just keep your feet moving.\n\nCan you share with our readers any self-care routines, practices or treatments that you do to help your body, mind or heart to thrive? Please share a story for each one if you can.\n\n1. Keep listening to music. It can uplift your spirit and shift any mood. Sometimes I can get in my own head too deeply. Music can inspire me. There have been times when I have gotten so down and nothing can shift it, but then I hear a great song or some gospel and I am right back to fearless. In fact, before I have to film a special or something important I put on some gospel music that will make me fearless and free. I think people see me dancing around with my earbuds on and think it’s hip hop, it’s probably Mahalia.\n\n2. What helps my body? I always do two things, JJ Smith’s Smoothie Cleanse and then some bikram yoga. I know people don’t like Bikram himself but his yoga is HOT! It is always my go to. It’s so hard to do that. You have to shut your mind off to do the postures. And when your mind is off, the answers come.\n\n3. I don’t like to talk religion. But I started going back to church, it is where I am reminded that no one has control over my career or my life. I’m a fan of the writings of Mary Baker Eddy and that’s really working for me right now.\n\nCan you please give us your favorite “Life Lesson Quote”? Can you share how that was relevant to you in your life?\n\n“Be A Lion”…it’s from a song from the Wiz. When the Lion doesn’t think he can go on any longer.\n\n“…not even lightning\n\nWill be frightening, my lion\n\nAnd with no fear inside\n\nNo need to run\n\nNo need to hide\n\nYou’re standing strong and tall\n\nYou’re the bravest of them all\n\nIf on courage you must call\n\nThen just keep on tryin’\n\nAnd tryin’, and tryin’\n\nYou’re a lion\n\nIn your own way, be a lion”\n\nI have had a ton of hard roads that I have had to walk myself since my mother passed on. I made the promise to her I would keep on, maybe I can help get her some recognition along the way. Finish her musical that she wrote. Not quit. A lot of incidents happened that I had no way to see my way through. But I keep remembering that musical she showed me as a kid. And in some of the craziest, sometimes even dangerous places that I was in and ill-equipped to get out of, I overcame fear and became a lion in my own way. And keep trying every day.\n\nYou are a person of enormous influence. If you could inspire a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be?\n\nI think I would like to make some kind of movement to help people break through their fears. Fear can mesmerize people, destroy their hopes and dreams and health. It is paralyzing. So if we can help people break their fear, they can help themselves better. That’s why I love comedy. A laugh can give you that break to not take life so seriously. And that break can give you the break you need to get to the answers you need for everything.\n\nIs there a person in the world whom you would love to have lunch with, and why? Maybe we can tag them and see what happens!\n\nYes. Robbie Praw, at Netflix. He’s got the best eye in comedy, he was trained from working for the Montreal Festival. Mr Praw is single handedly holding the integrity of the comedy world together. My dream lunch would be with Robbie saying yes he would like to check out my one woman show.\n\nAre you on social media? How can our readers follow you online?\n\nYes, my handle is @maijadigiorgio"
