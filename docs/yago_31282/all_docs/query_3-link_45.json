        "text": "Welcome to #CriticalRole, where nerdy-ass voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons. Sometimes as sheep in astral space. But almost always in unison.\n\nThanks to Skillshare for sponsoring tonight's show! First 1000 critters to go to http://skl.sh/criticalrole05211 get a free trial. (That link wasn't part of the bit, that was real.)\n\nSam took a class in photography, and is ready to show slides.\n\nOf his hand. Blocking the lens. Apparently it has subversive commentary built into it.\n\nSam's booger. Sam on the toilet. Also on the toilet. Also also on the toilet. And getting attacked by a tripod.\n\nTruly a master at metaphors.\n\nOh, and there's one where is head is shoved so deep in the bowl, his face is almost certainly in the water.\n\nIf nothing else, this truly shows how dedicated Sam is to his craft. Probably not photography, but...\n\n\"He ripcorded out of the bit!\"\n\nThanks also to Ghostfire Gaming, with Grim Hollow: The Monster Grimoire!\n\nThanks, as always, to D&D Beyond!\n\nAshley is still queasy with how deep Sam's head was in the bowl. BUT, she still has to thank you all for showing support to @CriticalRoleFDN!\n\nThe stores have new stuff: temporary tattoos with designs by @well_dipper, and a Xhorhas beanie! (We just checked, they're still in stock. For NOW.)\n\nTie Dye shirts? Marisha will add another thing to the video to do list. Super high priority, sure.\n\nSam managed to not only derail his own bit, but all subsequent bits.\n\nLast Time\n\nLast time: The Nein chased after Cree and Lucien through the Genesis Ward of Aeor, evading some creatures and pitting some against others. They also found that someone ahead of them laid a bunch of Intuit Charges in anticipation of the Nein pursuing them.\n\nThe Nein entered a chamber with two live Intuit Charges and the two Tomb Takers, engaged in brief conversation before the TT escaped into the Astral Sea. The Nein then escaped from a legendary water elemental after them. And Caleb is a sheep.\n\nThe Nein currently are floating in the Astral Sea, looking at the massive island of rock: The living Cognouza Ward.\n\nHoofing It\n\nThe Nein watch something get pulled into the ward. The city is beautiful, but ominous. Beau looks for Lucien while Fjord bats at the sheep. 11: In the immensity of the space around, there is too much going around.\n\nClay makes a party check: no one is moving. Clay flaps his wings, not moving. It looks beautiful, if not practical. Jester reminds everyone they have to think where they want to go.\n\nSheepleb can't make out depth in this vast area. Broken bits of rock, chunks of landmasses. Tendrils and lengths of chain. Puffs of cloud. Soft waves of sliver and glitter against black void. All shifting.\n\nJester thinks she wants to go towards Fjord's hand and hold it. Did she do it? She wills herself; she moves in his direction at 3 ft per round, assuming +1 is the base. Clay moves at 1 ft per round, assuming -1 is the base. The sheep spins in space. He has a -4 Int modifier.\n\nJester is afraid that Caleb will be a sheep forever. Fjord suggests they kill him. Yasha grabs the sheep as Clay asks him if he will be a sheep forever.\n\nWith a 15, Fjord estimates they are 2-3 miles from the city. Veth tries to calculate how long it will take them to get where they are going.\n\nBeau admits that Caleb is a cute sheep. It wouldn't be a bad ending, if he stayed a sheep.\n\nCaleb imagines some hay, which would be good to eat.\n\nThe rule of speed is corrected: speed is 3 times your intelligence SCORE, not modifier.\n\nBeau has Clay hold onto her belt while she tests how much it would take to tug him. She can!\n\nSam: \"Just floating around, tugging people!\" Someone makes the noise of a motor boat.\n\nFjord looks around to make sure the Tomb Takers aren't following them. He sees two shapes heading toward the city, a ways off. They divide from each other. Jester is worried they're both taking a threshold crest to a separate location.\n\nThe party debate what direction they want to go, right or left. Caleb points with a hoof.\n\nJester gives Artie a vote. The weasel has a fey aura, adjusting form. \"...My, you found yourself in a bit of a pickle.\" He's never been here, this is WILD.\n\nJester demands a vote from Artie, who votes left.\n\nEssek also gets a vote. He also tries left.\n\nLeft it is. Think really hard, let's go.\n\nClay asks Jester to attempt Divine Intervention, since he's unsure if his is back yet. Clay rolls, but it's unsuccessful. (Stats Confirmation: It has been EXACTLY 7 full days since the last successful attempt on Clay's DI, plus a few hours. It's available again.)\n\nAbove Cognouza\n\nAs Cognouza has expanded in the Astral Sea, it has begun to replicate elements of itself as it expands and absorbs surrounding elements.\n\nThe Nein drift further and closer, following the left-hand path. Beau assists Fjord to see who they are chasing: Nat20 for 23. The Nein stay trained on this figure, traveling in a flock, watching the structures of the city fall into greater focus.\n\nThe streets of the city are barren and empty, no people. An expression of society, absent of society.\n\nUp closer, Jester sees no eyeballs on the buildings. That detail from before was only for Caleb and Beau.\n\nA voice rings through all of the Nein's minds: WELCOME, GUESTS. MINDS. KIN. So rare (rare RARE WELCOME welcome) Welcome us hoooome.\n\nCaleb: \"Baaaah.\" Jester: \"We have to destroy this city.\"\n\nAfter receiving this message, the Nein look at the streets again... and they're full of people. Bustling, walking in pairs, groups, moving carts, going about their business. They are too far above the city to see if there is any corruption.\n\nClay looks for anything following them from the void. 25: nothing.\n\nJester notes that the party is still pretty busted up, and shouldn't keep going until they heal.\n\nThe person they are following is coasting down to the city.\n\nBringing Caleb Baaaack\n\nJester inspects Caleb to see if he is permanently a sheep now. Medicine Check 26: physically seems like a sheep.\n\nClay takes initiative, and smacks him with his staff. 17 cracks the sheep for 5 damage, 2 of which carries over to Caleb, who is no longer a sheep.\n\nYasha is still holding Caleb. He is okay with her holding him a little bit longer until he recovers. Okay, he's fine.\n\nBeau remembers the spyglass she took from Avantika, and takes it out to look at who they are pursuing. With guidance from Sprinkle and Jester, she rolls 20 total. Beau sees the figure dart behind a building. She catches the hint of a tail.\n\nBoth Lucien and Cree have tails. No idea who.\n\nCaleb does not have a spell to create the tower. The party really wants to rest, but they don't have the means. Jester frantically insists they have no time to rest. 8 hours, and Cognouza is already back to Exandria!\n\nEveryone explains how damaged they are. Clay debates casting a Heal, but decides ultimately on a Prayer of Healing for 21. Six people: Beau, Yasha, Caleb, Clay, Fjord, and Jester.\n\nMatt and Ashley confirm that the HP gained from the level up to 15 are included in what HP they have now.\n\nBeau offers to tether Caduceus to make up for his slow speed. Caleb offers to also help pull him.\n\nThe person they are pursuing isn't moving at an incredible speed, at least.\n\nEntering Cognouza\n\nThe party feel gravity shift as they get close enough to the city. They still move in the direction they are going, but the gravity is such that it feels like they could walk on this streets. They didn't realize the lack of gravity before.\n\nFjord sees people moving about. He casts See Invisibility for the next hour. A variety of people: mostly human, some elf. Their outfits all resemble the clothing of the corpses in Aeor.\n\nNone of the people here are paying any attention to the Nein as they fly overhead. The quarry disappeared over a lip; Clay rolls Nat20 of 30+4 guidance to spot them... finding NOTHING.\n\nClay turns his attention to the townsfolk. They are facing each other, but there is no conversation. Just going through the motions, interactions brief and superficial.\n\nJester wonders if all of the brains of the people here are like the inside of Yussa's: just screaming.\n\nClay wonders if they don't need their bodies. Caleb and Beau confirm with their eyesight that these are real.\n\nThere are a number of buildings, a courtyard with a fountain with no water. Veth: \"It's the best fountain I've ever seen!\" Connected residential buildings, a dome with a metallic vane on top, a vibrant and green tree, a garden area. The roofs have no entryways; the buildings have no chimneys.\n\nClay suggests they need cover, and need to not touch down on the ground. He says they lost who they were chasing; it's time to regather themselves.\n\nFjord wants to experiment with these people. Jester suggests Veth send one of them a message. She flies within 120 ft, and says, \"Hey there, you! Nice day!\" She realizes how difficult it is for Jester to construct messages to send as she also hits the word limit.\n\nThe individual doesn't respond in words. She looks about 17 years old in lavender robes. She stops, and looks up. Then she continues walking.\n\nTimorei\n\nCaleb tries using his mind to contact someone for the time.\n\nThe individual he contacts stops, looks up at Caleb, then SCREAMS.\n\nThe Nein all heard the screams. No one else on the street pays attention to this display.\n\nAfter a while, the screaming stops. Caleb hears a voice in his mind: \"I see you. Let's talk!\" The figure continues to stare at Caleb. He stands next to an archway, and asks Caleb to follow him before the others take note.\n\nThe Nein heard the scream, but Caleb tells them about the mental conversation. At the distance Caleb was at, the person he talked to seemed humanoid. Caleb will go down to talk to the man while the rest of the Nein stay back a little.\n\nCaleb glides down to the ground while Fjord is 60 ft above the population, sword out. Yasha and Jester stay nearby, as well. The metal vane is across the courtyard; Beau and Veth go to investigate it. Jester goes right above the arch in the roadway.\n\nCaleb approaches the man: 40s, haven't shaved in a few days, hair combed back and to the left. Nice clothing, a design he recognizes as Aeorian. Caleb looks at the archway. It seems reddish... and fleshy, veins bulging from the surface. There's a few errant teeth. And it becomes the archway of this stone.\n\nCaleb gets within 10 ft of the man. His face is blank... and it turns into bitter sobs. Eventually, the sobbing stops, abruptly... and SWELLS, the eye ballooning up. Yasha rushes to Caleb as he backs up. He recognizes the eye from a dream he had.\n\nThe eye babbles in Caleb's mind about how oblivion must be DESTROYED. Beau can hear hints of the convo. The Nein can only hear the mental babbling if they are close.\n\nThis individual is Timorei, one of the Somnovem, and he could use their aid. His mad babbling continues. Find them, find them within the Aether Crux, so they, others may SURVIVE. Pleassssse.\n\nTimorei says he has been parted from his other parts. But Caleb has the power to find where their essence survives.\n\nJester thinks this is a trap: 9 insight. (9 is not special here.) This is a shotgun of fear and communication through a veil of scattered insanity and madness. It is impossible to make out any intent beyond the words said. But there is a profound sense of terror within Timorei.\n\nElatis and Luctus are two other members of the Somnovem, who Timorei is at odds with. Timorei would like to see Elatis and Luctus destroyed because they apparently want all of this to be destroyed, and Timorei doesn't want that.\n\nTimorei inquires after the Nonagon. The nonagon is going to help them come home, welcome them home.\n\nHow many are there of you? Nine. Many. At \"many,\" everyone on the street repeats the word.\n\nCaleb asks what they must be wary of here. \"The rest. I must go, I can sense them coming. They are curious too. They are curious too!\"\n\nThe eye shrinks down, the man liquefies into a puddle... and turns to perfect, unmarked cobblestone.\n\nIra\n\nFjord lands on the ground. Gravity is normal here, no other effect. He pokes the ground with his sword. Sword on cobblestone.\n\nAn elderly woman's attention is directed to the Nein. She approaches. Fjord takes a step back. The clothing on these people seem to merge with their flesh with their hands. As they walk, their feet never fully leave the ground as something seems to lift their feet, simulated walking.\n\nThe woman shifts as an eye forces its way out of her mouth. A deep voice growls and bellows into their minds: \"WHO WAS HERE?!\" They can sense someone was here. \"I am Ira.\" Travis: \"Roth Ira.\"\n\nIra wants to make the planes bleed. They all shall feel their wrath. Creation is born from destruction. All that is destroyed opens ways for more creation. They will ALL PAY.\n\nIra wants to know who the Nein were talking to. Caleb says they are new here; it's hard to get their bearings. Deception with disadvantage: 14. The eye shifts from Fjord to Caleb. The grandmother's legs seems to break and fold on themselves as the form slithers across the stone to Caleb.\n\n\"You... LIE.\" All the civilians around yell \"LIE\" in unison. Caleb says there is a ring of truth, though. How does Ira feel about visitors in their fine city?\n\nIra starts listing names. Mirumus? Gaudius?\n\nCaleb claims it was Gaudius: deception 21.\n\nIra growls not to trust Gaudius. They say that Gaudius pushes them all toward oblivion. Destroy Gaudius' essence, and maybe they can talk. Show that you can do what Ira needs you to do.\n\nThe eye pops into red ether energy. The bodies around in the courtyard also convulse and collapse into muscle and teeth... As the bodies around the party swell into unnatural forms of flesh and teeth and eyes... it's time to roll initiative.\n\nThe party places themselves around the map. Essek is on a roof, in a defensive stance. Yasha was close to Caleb, Beau and Veth were over by the weather vane.\n\nLaura wonders if necrotic or radiant energy would work here. The party rolls initiative before break. Beau and Yasha both roll 21. \"My babe!\" \"Babaaay!\"\n\nVeth's initiative is brought to you by Dwarven Forge, and is 17.\n\nFjord 16. Jester 11. Essek 11. Caleb 7. Caduceus 6.\n\nLaura misses all being close to everyone at the table. Sam likes having his own table.\n\nAs the party prepares to fight the meat-colored individuals with exploding faces (\"Just like Barbie dolls!\"), we go to break!\n\n(We'd like to remind anyone who had trouble keeping up with Matt's impressive impressions of madness that LIVE and EDITED closed captions are available on Twitch and Youtube!)\n\nCombat: Cognouza Flesh Horrors\n\nWelcome back! Combat begins now. Without strategy over the break.\n\nRound 1\n\nBeau notes that all these fleshy things seem pretty primal. She looks for the grandma that was split in half.\n\n\"Do I get any weird thoughts or feelings from the eyeballs on my body?\" No more than usual.\n\nBeau notes that her astral speed is about the same as her running speed. She uses her brain speed.\n\nSam asks if they can still feel the tug. Matt gives a straight answer while the cast dies in laughter.\n\nBeau touches down on the ground with her movement. She's still 10 ft away; Step of the Wind to close the distance. The ground doesn't seem to react to her steps; just stone.\n\nBeau twirls her staff and lays into the Old Horror Lady. 31 and 21 both hit for 10 and 11 damage. Stunning strike: It is not stunned. Teeth emerges where Beau struck. It's like striking a water bed. White humanoid eyes appear in various places in the flesh.\n\nEveryone in proximity of the creatures hear the screams of the mouths. Yasha starts her turn with a Wis Save, aided by her sword: Nat20. No issue from the screams. She kisses the sword and RAGES.\n\nYasha drifts towards the Old Horror Lady. 18 hits for 36 damage; radiant damage is allowed. Nat1 will miss.\n\nVeth is on top of the clock tower. She floats inside to hide for cover, and aims to disable a flesh creature by telling a joke. \"What do you get when you cross Beauregard and a bowl of bran cereal? Monk s***!\"\n\nSix eyes appear on the creature, and turn to Veth. The mouths open up. A dozen mouths all chuckle in a manner reminiscent of the Laughing Hand. But the mound of flesh does fall prone.\n\nFjord flies up 42 feet. (Laura points out that's the answer to life.) Three eldritch blasts to one of the flesh horror creatures. All three hit its AC of 15 for 34 damage. He uses a bonus action to make his face look like a big red eye.\n\nThe Cognouza Flesh Horrors (CFH) now get their turn. They rush the party, but can only move 20 ft without being controlled by something greater.\n\nOne CFH attacks Caleb. 26 and 12: only the Torrent of Teeth hits for 32 piercing damage. Strength save with advantage is 19: he tears himself away from the teeth-covered tendril.\n\nAnother CFH attacks Beau. 23 hits, 19 misses. Torrent of Teeth lands for 32 damage. Strength save 15 meets the DC; she is not wrestled to the ground.\n\nThe CFH are done this round. They pack a punch, but are not terribly hardy.\n\nJester's turn. She would like to RAGE. But instead, she casts Guiding Bolt with her ring of Spell Splitting. She realizes that the wild magic of Aeor does not extend to this space. Both guiding bolts land for 24 radiant damage. She kills one of the CFH, it screaming as it burns away to ash. There is a sigh of relief at the end of the scream. The other is lit up.\n\nJester decides to RISE UP to one of the rooftops, opposite to Yasha. Jester notes that the CFH felt happy that they freed it. They must free ALL CITIZENS. (Yeah, they totally got time for that.)\n\nEssek prepares an orb of energy in his hands, then arcs off a black lightning bolt. A boom of thunder sounds as it strikes three of the CFH for 36 damage (they all fail). He backs up a little more.\n\nCaleb pulls out the cat's cradle, streaking a web of fire to each CFH. The one on the ground automatically fails. Another also takes the full 33 damage. Two succeed, but one of those is already weak enough to be burned up. The death of this third CFH is also marked by screams of pain, concluded by a sigh of relief.\n\nCaleb uses his mind to travel 60 ft out of range.\n\nClay sends a Sacred Flame to the CFH right below him. It fails the dex save, taking 20 radiant damage. It's still up. He rises up in the sky, just a little bit.\n\nRound 2\n\nTop of round 2, Caleb rolls Wis Save against the screams. 16 beats 15.\n\nBeau starts her turn with a Wis Save: 14 fails. She feels the screams pierce her mind. Roll a D8: 7.\n\nBeau's vision is a mess of colors and shapes. She rolls two attacks at the nearest creature: 29 and 21 both hit Yasha. Since raging, she only takes 13 damage. Marisha: \"Why are [the damage dice] good?!\"\n\nYasha feels like she probably deserved that from past fights. \"I've practically killed you, this is not that bad.\"\n\nYasha starts her turn by pushing Beau with her finger on Beau's forehead, then glides toward a CFH to attack: Nat1 misses. 22 hits 36 damage. This kills the form of the Old Lady Horror.\n\nYasha turns her head over her shoulder, and blows Beau a kiss. Veth mistakes this kiss as going to a tentacle monster.\n\nVeth sees two creatures, including the prone creature no longer laughing. She doesn't see anything interesting in this clock tower. She floats to a tree, hiding as a bonus action before firing at the prone creature. 17 hits w/o sneak attack: 8 damage.\n\nFjord moves above the fountain before firing three blasts at a single CFH: 31 force damage as all three hit. Splatters of flesh and bone and other elements; it's barely keeping it together.\n\nThe CFH take their turn. Ashley makes sound effects.\n\nOne CFH climbs the tree. It is right next to Veth, but it burned its action to do so. The other CFH also used its action to move.\n\nJester casts Sacred Flame on the CFH in the tree that is reaching for Veth: 9 will fail for 12 radiant damage.\n\nEssek glides up to fire bolt the CFH next to Veth: 19 hits, burning it to death before it wraps around Veth. The branches tries to pull itself away from the burning creature. The tree is also of flesh, though not nearly as hostile. Essek turns to Jester. \"There, team work!\" \"Good job, Essek.\"\n\nCaleb smirks at Essek's fire bolt, and does the same: Nat20 deals 42 fire damage for the #HDYWTDT. The last CFH squeals and liquefies into a horrible fondue. A face appears in the puddle: \"Thank you...\" It melts away into unmarked cobblestone.\n\nInspecting the Courtyard\n\nThe party isn't sure where they need to go, but they need to not be here. Beau points out the city has been replicating itself, so they can easily get turned around.\n\nVeth inspects the buildings to see if the items and furniture inside are real, or if it's all flesh.\n\nBeau: \"If you cut into it, is it cake?\"\n\nVeth notes that the coloration of the interiors are not incredibly detailed. She opens a crate: she grabs an item from it, and it immediately retracts back inside.\n\nVeth finds pliers to pet. Though she asks for consent first. No response. She leaves it alone.\n\nClay is convinced there is nothing here for them. Beau feels like there is something very central about this fountain and the bird on top of it. She inspects it for a secret lever: 30.\n\nThe fountain has no water. The marble darkens to a purplish red, undulating slightly. Where the water should be, there is a false replication of water.\n\nJester debates the specifics of Find the Path; if the whole city is one flesh, taking a piece of it wouldn't lead them to the exact location of the threshold crest, right?\n\nClay wants allies. Veth thinks they can turn the Somnovem against each other, though Jester points out they are already opposed. Maybe they can find minds that align with their goals?\n\nClay points out the emotions tied to each individual they spoke to: Fear and Wrath. The party consider using these emotions to their advantage.\n\nWhile the party debate how to use the Somnovem, Jester is concerned about Lucien. The Somnovem said they couldn't see the nonagon, but they could see his second.\n\nThe party drift up; time to get moving. If the person they were following had stayed on the streets, the Nein would have had visibility. The Nein are convinced the person they were chasing had to have hidden in a building or structure of some sort. The party splits up to search.\n\nYasha and Beau take one building. Essek and Veth will take the center building. Fjord still has See Invisibility enabled as he looks around: 15. Nothing.\n\nWith 29 and 30, Beau and Yasha look around a building. The stairs are doughy. The second floor looks unfinished, and colored like pale, untouched skin. Nothing of interest here. Let's leave NOW.\n\nFjord and Jester search the next building. Inside... it is completely open and empty. A tongue-like material is where the carpet floor should be. They bounce on it. Jester pets it. It's faintly damp. Fjord notes that the dampness comes from the saliva dripping from the ceiling. Jester gets a vial to fill for Veth. They sniff it. No scent.\n\nVeth and Essek investigate the middle structure. With a 28, there is some furniture that seems to merge with the floor in the same flesh color. Doughy stairs extend to second floor. There is a single person in a chair staring down at the street. Veth asks the person about their domicile. They look at her.\n\nShe looks back. Then SCREAMS. Screaming and screaming and screaming and screaming and screaming. Essek sends a fire bolt at it. The screaming stops.\n\nCaleb and Caduceus try the next house. 26: This chamber is half present. The wall seems to have swollen out, bulging in others. A hand almost seems to push from the inside of the skin wall. The steps lead to no second floor. Clay taps where the second floor should open up. Teeth open up to the roof as more steps appear in front of them. They walk up to the roof, where Jester greets them from the air.\n\nClay touches the window stone; it's warm. He casts Decompose. It quivers and twitches before turning gray, fungus and lichen taking hold. \"Oh, I bet you don't like that.\"\n\nCaleb approaches one of the massive humanoid statues near the gazebo. The details are fuzzy are gone, the memory of who it represented begun to drift. With the passage of time, the body and face are featureless and blank.\n\nCaleb looks around the gazebo for details. This was a park. There is a lip in the floor for a physical hiding location. He touches it: it opens up with teeth to another place to descend.\n\nYasha inspects the other statue in the courtyard. It is an exact duplicate of the statue Caleb first inspected. The idea of a memory. A lot of what, not a lot of why.\n\nThe Subdermal Depths\n\nThe Nein all follow Caleb into the literal bowels of the gazebo. The stairs here are solid, but it gets warmer the more they descend the spiral. The stairs also get softer the deeper they go. 60 ft, 80 ft, then the bottom. A corridor leads to three different direction, a brass hallway that seems very similar to Aeor. The plates aren't in disarray, though; everything is intact, but they slightly corkscrew just out of their periphery.\n\nVeth touches the metal walls. They bounce like aluminum; it's more metallic than flesh.\n\nClay casts Decompose. It takes a while, but it does eventually gray. Stronger memory, this wall.\n\nThere is writing on these tunnels. While Caleb consults the spells, Jester gives Veth a vial of Unstinky House Drool. Veth accepts, then sneakily drops it on the floor with 33 sleight of hand.\n\nThe tunnel to the right reads \"Praesidis Junction Junction Junction jUNcTion.\" Next says \"Help help help help help.\" The third says \"Crest Vault.\"\n\nJester attempts to roll for Divine Intervention: No. She looks at Sprinkle, who snorts. Artie isn't present in there at the moment.\n\nThe party debate if they do want to chase after the crest, or if there's any merit to seeing who needs help help help help.\n\nBeau worries that if they see Cree, Lucien will know. Jester argues that Lucien knows all on this territory, in spite of their amulets.\n\nClay thinks they have allies in this city. Veth argues they need to stop the crests before they activate, but Clay says that if something terrible happens, what else are they going to do. Caleb argues they can't trust any of the Somnovem. Clay wants to just talk.\n\nJester argues that they need to go now. Beau wonders what the choices are. Caleb would like to at least cut off Cree; that will buy them time. The Nein pursue the Crest Vault, traveling as quickly as they can, using foot or mind, whichever is faster. Essek is just barely faster than Caleb.\n\nThe hallway corkscrews. Then continues. It's hard to tell which is up, especially when the Nein float. The only ones who are keeping upright are the ones who stay on foot. Stone and rock have a purplish tint, veins pulsing between the stones. Portions underneath have a film of smooth, shiny sack of skin.\n\nThe Nein hear footsteps coming towards them from the direction they are approaching. There isn't really anywhere to hide, though there are minor flesh folds. Beau, Veth, Jester, Yasha, and Caleb take a fold while Clay and Fjord disguise themselves. Stealth checks for everyone who steps into a fold. Caleb rolls low 7. Fjord and Clay stand out, disguised.\n\nA figure runs up to them, and stops 40 ft ahead. Just... breathing, panting. Jester rolls insight to see if she recognizes who is breathing. 23: she doesn't know who it is, but they are definitely physically winded, and there is a faint, curious upturned growl.\n\nRed light begins to fill the hall as Beau and Caleb's eyes glow, exposing their locations. Cree's eyes also glow. \"Ah. I was wondering when you would catch up.\" And we end the night there!\n\nMatt will prepare the subdermal depths of Cognouza for battle next week.\n\nThank you for joining us! We love you very much, take care of yourselves, and Is It Thursday Yet?"
