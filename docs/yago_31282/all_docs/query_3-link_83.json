A “Stammtisch” is an informal group meeting held on a regular basis – more directly translating to ‘table for regulars’. Our Stammtisch was brewed to celebrate this idea of community and socializing. It’s a traditional German Pilsner featuring a blend of Hallertau and Strisselspalt hops, giving it a pronounced herbal and spicy aroma. It’s crisp and dry with a light grainy malt profile. We think it’s the perfect accompaniment to any gathering. 5.4% ABV – MO\n\nURBAN CHESTNUT SCHNICKELFRITZ 6/4/16oz CANS – Bavarian Weissbier. The unmistakable characteristics of this Bavarian Weissbier are achieved with a yeast that is decidedly fruity and phenolic. You may note clove, nutmeg or even vanilla and/or banana-like aromas and flavors. 5% ABV – MO\n\nClock House “Low Bandito” imperial stout returns today!
