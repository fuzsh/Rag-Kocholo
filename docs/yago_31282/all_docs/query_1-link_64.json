        "text": "“I've been working with Joe since 2002. That's 50 Super Bowl spots ago. And about 23,535 frames. Til someone figures out that Joe is really the guy who comes up with my shots, I say why ruin a good thing?”\n\n— Bryan Buckley, Director/ Owner of Hungry Man - The King of Super Bowl\n\n“It doesn't matter where I'm shooting, what time zone, how little time we have—Joe has become a crucial partner and I feel very fortunate to have found him seventeen years ago. If I can't get Joe—I'd rather do a shot list!”\n\n— Matt Smukler, Director at Supply & Demand\n\n“Joe James is the best and if you have a chance to work with him...don't you dare hesitate...I have worked with Joe for many years and rarely have I worked with anyone so professional, friendly, and talented.”\n\n— Mark Tiedemann\n\n“Joe is so great at so many things. I remember when he was just starting out. He was good right out of the gate. Now, he's a Grandmaster.”\n\n— Jim Shooter, Writer & Creator\n\n“You're the best man, honestly—Bryan and I were just talking about you. How you're our silent partner and you've been with us on all these journeys. A couple thousand people in a couple dozen countries have seen a Joe James drawing. Pretty great!”\n\n— Mino Jarjoura, Oscar-Nominated Producer\n\n“My favorite thing about working with Joe is that he always finds a new way to surprise me on every job. Whether it's an angle I never thought of or a way to make the story come through more effectively through the visuals, I know that every time I get another set of boards from him it's going to make the project even better. He's always a great listener and is asking questions I haven't even thought of yet.”\n\n— Andrew Wonder\n\n“Ms. Jackson is one of those rare creative people who does many things well, and moreover, is able to make connections between disciplines. She ‘sees the weave’ She constantly perceives insights that others miss. She can bring to bear design skills while writing or creating, production expertise while designing and creative imagination with regard to production…”\n\n— Jim Shooter"
