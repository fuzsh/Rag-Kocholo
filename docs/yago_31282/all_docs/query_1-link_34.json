        "meta_description": "For a 12-year-old guitarist from Highland Park or a 16-year-old vocalist from Milwaukee, the Bitter Jester Music Festival is the place to be. Now in its fourteenth year, the festival is the largest professional music competition for up-and-coming bands in the Midwest. Organized by the non-profit Bitter Jester Foundation for the Arts, the competition features bands from across Chicagoland and Wisconsin in which at least half of the members are 21 or younger. Four bands have already made it to the July 4 grand finale, but on this segment, we announce four additional wild card bands that will be advancing to the independence day competition. Joining us for the exciting announcement are Nicolas DeGrazia, founder and executive producer of the Bitter Jester Music Festival, and Michael Tseitlin, a performance adviser for and former four-time competitor in the Bitter Jester Music Festival. Tseitlin will also be one of seven judges for the final round of competition.",
