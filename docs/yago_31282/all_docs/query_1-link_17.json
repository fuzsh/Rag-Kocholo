        "meta_description": "Specialties: Discover your next favorite band at the Bitter Jester Music Fest! This free, family-friendly concert series began in Downtown Highland Park, IL, in 2006 and has evolved into the Midwest&#39;s largest showcase for emerging artists. With performers coming from across the Midwest and vying for a $3,500 in cash prizes and other awards, the Bitter Jester Music Fest is a must-see event!\n\nAs Dash from 101.9 The Mix put it: &#34;It&#39;s… an incredible concert with a bunch of future headliners!&#34; BJMF is the festival to check out some of your next favorite bands and be able to say &#34;I saw them when...&#34;\n\nMultiple musical acts perform each night in an “battle of the bands” style event where they receive detailed feedback from industry professionals. A winner is selected at each of the four Preliminary Concerts and four &#34;Wild Cards&#34; are chosen at the end of the summer. Those eight acts then compete at a Grand Finale Concert, also in Highland Park.\n\nSelect Bitter Jester Finalists are chosen to open for national headliners on Ravinia&#39;s Carousel Stage and many perform a &#34;Best Of&#34; show at Navy Pier&#39;s Beer Garden on Labor Day each year.\n\nPreliminary Concerts take place typically in June at Port Clinton Square, 600 Central Ave, in downtown Highland Park.\n\nThe Grand Finale is held at “The Lot” (at the intersection of St Johns and Central Avenues as part of the City of Highland Park&#39;s summer festival lineup! Established in 2006.  This homegrown festival started as a local &#34;battle of the bands&#34; and has grown into a well-respected summer-long concert series that culminates in a &#34;Best Of&#34; Showcase concert at Navy Pier every Labor Day. Many BJMF ‘graduates’ go on to perform as musical guests on shows including Late Nite with Seth Myers, Saturday Night Live, and American Jukebox, as well as performing live at Lollapalooza, Riot Fest, South by Southwest, and Ravinia Festival (past BJMF winners have opened for Charlie Puth and The Steve Miller Band at Ravinia, for example).",
