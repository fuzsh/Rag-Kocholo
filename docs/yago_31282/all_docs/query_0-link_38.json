        "text": "Acclaimed American stand-up Richard Belzer has pulled out of the Edinburgh fringe, citing movie commitments.\n\nThe star of Homicide has been scheduled to play three dates at the Crowne Plaza Hotel to coincide with the screening of the movie Bitter Jester, which he produced.\n\nHis show was much-anticipated by stand-up devotees - reflected in the fact that, at Â£17.50 a ticket, his would have been the most expensive one-man show on the Fringe.\n\nHowever, he will now be filming - and unable to make the Fringe gig.\n\nFilling his slots at the venue will be a showcase of American stand-up hosted by Bitter Jester star Maija DiGiorgio and featuring Tina Kim and Lewis Schaffer.\n\nPublished: 18 Jun 2003"
