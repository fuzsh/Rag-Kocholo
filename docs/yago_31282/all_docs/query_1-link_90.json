        "text": "Kelsi Richter\n\nBitter Jester Music Festival Judge\n\nKelsi has been playing music for twenty years, starting with the violin and growing to include drums and piano. Her favorite musical project was with The Fleeting Suns (along with fellow Bitter Jester Music Fest judge Andy Burrows), a folk rock band based in Chicago.\n\nAlong with creating music, Kelsi has worked as an artist for musicians creating album covers, posters, and merchandise. After moving to Seattle, Kelsi focused her talents on the business side of music and started to manage the Indie-Rock group Lofts (also check out their Facebook page here).\n\nWhen not creating art or managing her gang of musical goofballs, she can be found reading novels about existential crises and playing with her rowdy dogs."
