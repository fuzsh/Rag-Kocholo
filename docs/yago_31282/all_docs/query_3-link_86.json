        "text": "2023 BEER LIST\n\n(512) Brewing\n\n(512) Pils – American Style Pilsner\n\n(512) Pils is an American-style pale lager that is light straw in color with a kiss of malt sweetness and classic Saaz hops character. Designed for maximum drinkability, this beer offers a crisp, dry finish without bitterness.\n\nWhiskey Barrel aged Double Pecan Porter\n\n(512) Double Pecan Porter is a robust porter accented by organic Texas grown roasted pecans and subtly enhanced by aging in recently emptied oak whiskey barrels for two months. Notes of chocolate, coffee and pecan marry with the subtle flavors of vanilla and whiskey to make this a wonderful warmer worth savoring.\n\n12:30 Rotating Tap: Sandia Limon – Hazy IPA with Additions\n\nJuicy IPA with watermelon, lime, red chili and sea salt\n\n5th Element Brewing\n\nPickle Weisse – Beer Infused with Pickle Juice\n\nA 3.0% ABV sour Berliner Weisse infused with pickle juice. Ideal for beer cocktails and brunch sessions.\n\nMa Belle – Belgian Tripel\n\nAroma of classic Belgian esters merging with spices like coriander and zestes d’orange. A dry, light, and crisp finish awaits.\n\nLost Marker – Czech Style Lager\n\nOur Pale Lager with classic Bohemian taste, low ABV, and easy drinking.\n\nErste Kind – Blonde Ale\n\nOur inaugural core beer at 5th Element. A 4.9% ABV Blonde with vibrant cascade hop aroma. Clean, crisp, perfect for summer day-drinking.\n\nAcopon Brewing Company\n\nGaspipes – Best Bitter\n\nGaspipes is a traditional English best bitter. The name ‘bitter’ was an old term to differentiate it from a ‘mild’ or less hopped beer. This beer is still a malt forward beer, with a crispness from the hops and a nice dry finish. We use traditional hand malted Maris Otter to provide the backbone to this beer, and accent it with Goldings and Fuggle hops. This is a traditional style and we stay true to that. Served on cask, it’s natural carbonation, softer on the palate, so the malt complexities shine through.\n\nKarnstein – Amber Lager\n\nKarnstein is closest in style to a German märzen lager. Light malt sweetness is accentuated by a traditional decoction mash where part of the runnings are pulled off, boiled, then returned to the mash-tun. This adds an extra layer of malt complexity to the beer. We then lager the beer for a month to allow the beer to fully mature and mellow. The beer presents as a light copper color, with a bright white head. Low IBUs make this beer very drinkable.\n\nAlamo Beer Company\n\nRing of Fire – Chilli Beer\n\nAmber Lager with Ancho & Chipotle Peppers and Raspberry.\n\nForce Majeure – Not So Light Lager\n\nExtreme American Light Lager with Kiwi\n\n1:30 Rotating Tap: Strawberry Milkshake IPA\n\nVelvety smooth, NE IPA inspired ale with Strawberry, Vanilla & Lactose\n\nAltstadt Brewery\n\nAltstadt Hefe – South German-style Hefeweizen\n\nA traditional German Wheat beer. More than half of the malt used in this full-bodied brew is made up of German malted wheat. But the star of this brew is the yeast! Fermented in our open fermentation vessels, the yeast is free to impart a variety of fruity and spicy clove-like flavors.\n\nAltstadt Radler – Peach Radler\n\nThis Radler is a Texas Hill Country take on the classic German beverage. We’ve taken our gold-medal winning lager and blended it with world-famous Fredericksburg peaches and real fruit juice. The result is a light, crisp and refreshing drink perfect for the hot Texas summers.\n\nAustin Beerworks\n\nHydration Pils – Electrolyte Lager\n\nSuper light and clean lager with refreshing notes of lemon & lime. Breweries aren’t allowed to make health claims about their beers, but we can say that this beer does contain electrolytes and you can Google whether or not electrolytes help with hydration.\n\nKölsch Is Kölsch – Kölsch\n\nGuess what kind of beer this is? If you said Kölsch, you win a Kölsch! Light and bubbly with subtle notes of orchard fruit and white grape.\n\nBlack Thunder – Black Lager\n\nWe used to call this a German-style Schwarzbier (which is what it is), but that had too many scary looking letters so we changed it to Black Lager and now it sells much better. Dark and roasty, yet light and crisp. GABF Gold Medal winner!\n\nBlack Duck – Coffee Porter\n\nWe used so much coffee* in this, we’re not sure if it’s coffee-flavored beer or beer-flavored coffee. Sorry, “flavoured” since this is technically an English-style Porter.\n\n*Super premium coffee from our friends at Wild Gift.\n\nEpeelio Zestyhaze – Hazy IPA w/ Orange Peel & Lime Zest\n\nHazy!

A crisp, dry lager is given the Texas treatment by adding a touch of sweetness from malted maize and subtle spice from Tettnang and Saaz hops. No addition of salt or lime needed, but never discouraged.\n\nPilsner\n\nPack light and bring a lot of personality. A simple Czech pilsner recipe brewed with organic Contessa hops in lieu of the traditional Saaz variety. Light floral and herbal notes dance to a crisp and refreshing finish. Live the bohemian life…of luxury.\n\nWest Coast IPA\n\nMesmerizing and breathtaking.

It’s kettle hopped with Citra and El Dorado and dry hopped with Simcoe, Amarillo, Citra, and Mosaic Cryo. We fermented it in stainless steel with Imperial A38 Juice yeast. It’s super fresh, hoppy, and delicious, so we hope you enjoy it this Fall season!\n\n3:00 Rotating Tap: Atrial Rubicite – BA Fruited Wild Ale\n\nThis is last year’s batch of Atrial Rubicite which won Gold at the World Beer Cup!

Roadmap Brewing joined us to make this beer for their 5th Anniversary. The goal was a “Sabro-forward” hazee so hopefully we used enough Sabro, alongside Ekuanot & Citra. Can’t tell you much about how it tastes as clairvoyance is not our forte. Hazees & Pale Ales, however, are, so we’re hoping for the best.\n\nUpdate: Upon tasting this beer to clear it for packaging we can in fact confirm that this lil hazee pale does all the things that we set out to do. Turns out we used enough Sabro. Coconut & cedar & pillowy pineapples.
