A day in which one consciously separates the past from the future. ‚ú®Ô∏è Jobs, lovers, family, employers, and friends can exist one day without any one of us, and if our egos permit us to confess, they could exist eternally in our absence. Each person deserves a day away in which no problems are confronted, no solutions searched for. üö´ Each of us needs to withdraw from the cares which will not withdraw from us. We need hours of aimless wandering or spates of time sitting on park benches, observing the mysterious world of ants and the canopy of treetops. üåé If we step away for a time, we are not, as many may think and some will accuse, being irresponsible, but rather we are preparing ourselves to more ably perform our duties and discharge our obligations. When I return home, I am always surprised to find some questions I sought to evade had been answered and some entanglements I had hoped to flee had become unraveled in my absence. üí´ A day away acts as a spring tonic. It can dispel rancor, transform indecision, and renew the spirit.\" üîã - Maya Angelou, Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now üí• #wednesdaywisdom üí° ----‚Äê‚Äê-----------‚Äê------------------------------------------------------------------ üëãüèæ Thanks for dropping by‚ÄºÔ∏èüôèüèæ For more content like this, please like, share and ring the bell at the top of my profile to receive notifications for all new posts.\n\n39\n\n22 Comments\n\nThe Power of Your Word: Keeping Agreements in a World of Shifting Sands In a world constantly bombarded by information and changing priorities, it's easy to let our commitments slip. We make promises with the best of intentions, but life happens. Deadlines shift, unforeseen circumstances arise, and the well-meaning agreements we made start to feel like distant memories. But here's the truth: **our word is our most valuable currency.** When we stick to our agreements, we build trust, foster healthy relationships, and create a foundation of reliability. **Why is keeping your word so important?** * **Trust:** When you consistently follow through on your commitments, you build trust with others. They know they can count on you, and that creates a sense of security and peace of mind. * **Respect:** Keeping your word shows respect for the time and energy invested by others. It demonstrates that you value their time and effort, and that you take your commitments seriously. * **Integrity:** Honoring your agreements is a cornerstone of integrity. It aligns your actions with your values and creates a sense of personal accountability. * **Peace of mind:** When you are true to your word, you gain a sense of accomplishment and peace of mind. You know you did the right thing, and that feeling is invaluable. **How to keep your word:** * **Be mindful when making agreements:** Don't make promises you can't keep. Think carefully before committing, and be realistic about what you can achieve. * **Communicate clearly and effectively:** Ensure both parties understand the terms of the agreement. Be specific about deadlines, expectations, and responsibilities. * **Prioritize your commitments:** Treat your agreements as important tasks and schedule them accordingly. * **Be proactive:** If you foresee challenges in meeting a deadline, communicate those challenges early on. Find solutions together instead of waiting until it's too late. * **Don't make excuses:** Own your responsibilities. If you fall short, acknowledge it and work to rectify the situation. Apologize sincerely and commit to doing better in the future. https://lnkd.in/ekc793rx https://lnkd.in/dMxNdiu7 https://lnkd.in/eqXySTVw your word is not just about fulfilling obligations; it's about cultivating a sense of personal integrity and building strong, lasting relationships. It's about being a person of your word, someone others can trust and rely upon. In a world that's constantly shifting, the strength of our word remains a constant, a beacon of reliability and a source of true power."
