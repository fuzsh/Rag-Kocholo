        "text": "The 15th Annual Bitter Jester Music Festival and Band Competition\n\nHighland Park, IL\n\nFree weekly concert series in Downtown Highland Park’s Port Clinton Square – 6:45 p.m. Fridays July 23 & 30, Aug. 6 & 13\n\nGrand Finale Concert & Fireworks at Wolters Field – 3 p.m. Sept. 5\n\nBitter Jester Music Festival\n\nBeing a young artist can be a difficult experience. For starting out musicians, there are so many unknowns to navigate, it can often be discouraging. For those that have been at it a few years, the challenges can mount up and overwhelm these folks who most likely started this path for a simple love of playing and performing music.\n\nOften, for young musicians, local band competitions are an attractive outlet to hone their craft and gain some recognition. These competitions can at times be fairly cutthroat and leave everyone but the winner feeling jaded with their efforts.\n\nThat’s where the Bitter Jester Music Festival comes in.\n\nBitter Jester Music Festival, hosted by The Bitter Jester Foundation for the Arts, is “the Midwest’s largest professional music competition for emerging musicians.” More than a band competition, however, Bitter Jester presents a uniquely invaluable opportunity to its participants.\n\nThe Bitter Jester Band Experience\n\nWhen a band of young musicians (all bands must consist of at least 50% of its members under the age of 22) enters the Bitter Jester competition, they are already on track for a great experience.\n\nEach competing act of the multi-week concert series will be judged by a panel of music/media professionals and leading music educators who will select a winner each week. The four weekly winners – plus four additional “Wild Card” bands selected by BJMF producers – advance to a Grand Finale where cash prizes and other awards are given out before a big fireworks display.\n\nBut it is what all of the bands – not just the chosen winners – receive that makes this competition so special.\n\nEach band in the Bitter Jester Competition gets the experience of performing in front of a crowd on a professional stage with professional equipment – but that’s just the beginning.\n\nAll Bitter Jester performers receive a wealth of critical and encouraging feedback from working music professionals, including full-page written comments, numerical scores in different categories, graphs, and charts comparing each performer’s ranks relative to their competition. Additionally, all participants receive a soundboard recording of their performance including a real-time track of verbal feedback by one of the esteemed judges on the panel. For any up-and-coming artist, this amount of feedback and analysis can be game-changing for their musical growth.\n\nOn top of that, there is an appointed “Band Liason” on-site whose goal is to facilitate connections among these young artists. The sense of camaraderie among these competing young acts is uplifting, as they typically befriend one and another and cheer each other on, despite being in a competition. Connections are made amongst acts that can endure, and also prove to be incredible resources for their emerging musical careers.\n\n“This musical competition is a great opportunity for talented young musicians to get noticed and measure their skills against those of their peers,” says festival judge Greg Easterling, a former on-air DJ with 97.1 TheDrive, WDRV. “It’s also a lot of fun! I’m proud to be associated with it as a judge and all-around supporter.”\n\nAs it is a competition, winners are eventually chosen. At the Grand Finale Concert, the judges will narrow the field down to two finalists. These two finalists will then go head to head and a winner is chosen based on crowd response.\n\nThe winner of the Bitter Jester Music Festival competition will receive $1000, generously donated by First Bank of Highland Park, with $750 to the runner-up and $500 to the 3rd place act.\n\nAttending Bitter Jester Music Festival\n\nBitter Jester Music Festival is celebrating its 15th year. That means that this might look a bit different than what many might envision of a ‘band competition.’\n\nFor starters, this is a series of concerts. Beginning July 23rd, the Festival series continues each Friday in Downtown Highland Park’s Port Clinton Square – July 23 & 30, Aug. 6 & 13. The Grand Finale Concert and Fireworks takes place at Wolters Field, beginning at 3 p.m. on Sept. 5. All of these events are free.\n\nWith all of the amazing offerings for the contest participants, Bitter Jester manages to attract top-notch talent from all over the country. Unlike some band competitions, Bitter Jester performers will deliver professional performances by extremely talented young musicians.\n\nThe bottom line is that the crowd will be treated to some incredible music while the acts on stage compete to deliver their best performances.\n\n“If you’re looking for a summer music festival where you can hear really good music in a family-friendly environment with fireworks, Bitter Jester is the place you should go. It’s remarkable,” says BJMF Director of Education Michael Tseitlin, himself a\n\nfive-time competitor in BJMF and now Director of Guitar at Stevenson High School in Lincolnshire, IL.\n\n“I volunteer for this incredible organization because my life was so profoundly shaped by it when I was a\n\nteenager. I wouldn’t have gone into music education if it weren’t for Bitter Jester.”\n\nMore Information on Bitter Jester Music Festival"
