Emmy Rossum wants to walk down the aisle again in the future. The 27-year-old actress married music executive Justin Siegel in February 2008. But he filed for divorce in September 2009, before the couple officially ended their marriage in December 2010. However, Shameless star Emmy insists the experience hasn’t put her off becoming a bride for a second time.

'My parents were never married, and I was teased in school and called a b*****d'

“Honestly, I was so young, I don’t think I knew what marriage meant,” Emmy told the American edition of Cosmopolitan magazine.

“My parents were never married, and I was teased in school and called a b*****d. So the idea of marriage as safety forever was idealised in my head, and we rushed into it.”

Emmy is now in a relationship with Sam Esmail, a writer and director who she met while working on the film Comet.

And the stunning brunette admits she sometimes finds it difficult to differentiate between herself and her Shameless character Fiona.

“I feel like on the first date with a guy he’ll think I’m easy [like Fiona], and that’s so disconcerting,” she said. “It’s not like I haven’t had sex on the first date, but usually that ended up in a two-year relationship…I don’t gravitate to the jock; it’s the nerdy guy in the corner. I’m dating a writer now. Writers are sexy.”

Emmy also revealed in the interview that while many of her friends keep in touch via text messages, she prefers to use other mediums to communicate.

The reason for her hatred of texts derives from an unfortunate situation in the past.

“I once found a guy I was dating dirty-texting another woman and I completely lost my sh*t,” she said. “Texting is so dangerous! I won’t even give guys my number, because I know me. We’ll start texting and he’ll start emoticon-ing and I’ll start emoticon-ing, and soon we have a big mess. I’m a very flirty person in general.”
