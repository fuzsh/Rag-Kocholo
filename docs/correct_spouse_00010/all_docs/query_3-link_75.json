        "text": "NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK: Emmy Rossum is undoubtedly the epitome of ‘beauty with brain’. After a great start in 2000, the 36-year-old star won millions of hearts and a string of awards for her acclaimed performances in blockbusters including ‘Shameless’, ‘The Phantom of the Opera’, ‘The Day After Tomorrow’ and ‘Before I Disappear’. Rossum is now all set to deliver another phenomenal performance in ‘The Crowded Room’, an Apple TV+ show where she will portray the role of Tom Holland’s mother.\n\nHolland and Rossum only have a 10-year age difference, but she isn't bothered by it since she believes her character Candy is intended to be a young mother. \"It makes sense when I read the script. Candy's a super young mom, she's almost a child in her own right when she becomes pregnant at age 16. You watch as I age from 25 to 35, which is actually younger than I am now,\" she told ET Online while defending her role.\n\nThe actress also stated that her character \"brings up a lot\" of feelings for her as she discovered she was pregnant with her youngest child while shooting the series. She shares a 2-year-old daughter and 2-month-old son with film producer Sam Esmail, who she married in 2017. Rossum and Esmail have a real-life rom-com love story, where they went from working together to living their lives together. The adorable couple first met in 2013 when Rossum starred in 'Comet', a rom-com written and directed by Esmail.\n\nWho Is Sam Esmail?\n\nBorn in Egypt, Esmail was raised in North Carolina, South Carolina, and New Jersey after his parents moved to America. Ever since Sam was young, he was fascinated by all things technological and filmmaking. He studied both subjects at New York University and was subsequently admitted to the esteemed Tisch School of the Arts. After earning his degree, Sam worked for an internet start-up before starting his very own ISP software firm. Then, he steered his career and went on to pursue his passion.\n\nNow, Esmail is a big name in the entertainment industry, and is the creator, writer, and director of the award-winning TV series 'Mr. Robot', starring then-breakout star, Rami Malek. He also directed and produced the psychological thriller ‘Homecoming’, a Prime Video series starring Julia Roberts and Janelle Monáe. His next projects include ‘Metropolis’, which is based on the Fritz Lang picture from 1927, and ‘Leave The World Behind’, which is an adaptation of Rumaan Alam's best-selling novel of the same name and will also feature Julia Roberts.\n\nThe rom-com love story of Emmy Rossum and Sam Esmail\n\nRossum and Esmail met in 2012 on the set of his first feature film, ‘Comet’ just a few years after her divorce from her first husband Justin Siegel. Soon after, they fell head over heels in love and made their public debut as a couple at the June 2014 premiere of ‘Comet’. Their romance blossomed pretty quickly as a year later, Esmail popped the question in the most cinematic way possible. In a 2017 interview with Vogue, Rossum revealed that the couple had a tradition of reading the Modern Love column of The New York Times every Sunday but they unknowingly missed one weekend.\n\n“Then one weekend we didn't read it — I don't remember why exactly — and the following Friday he reminded me that we hadn't,\" she explained. Rossum was almost ready to enter the bathtub, but he persuaded her to read the column. As soon she started reading, she noticed that the story sounded familiar — a director falling in love with an actress. \"Then, I kind of scanned to the end and it said, 'Love your Sam,'\" she recalled. She finished the story in the tub, and right there and then, Esmail got down on one knee to propose.\n\nTwo years later, Rossum and Esmail tied the knot on May 28, 2017, at an intimate ceremony held at the Central Synagogue in New York City. Following the wedding, a magnificent banquet was held in the Guggenheim Museum, whose design served as the model for Rossum's Carolina Herrera bridal gown. Since then the couple has been together and has welcomed two adorable kids - a 2-year-old daughter, Samantha, and a 2-month-old son, whose name they haven’t revealed yet."
