        "text": "Actress Emmy Rossum has dismissed speculation she has quietly tied the knot with fiance Sam Esmail.\n\nThe Shameless star became engaged to her writer/director boyfriend last August (15) after two years of dating, but the couple hit headlines early on Friday (15Jul16) after Emmy's TV co-star Shanola Hampton suggested her friend had secretly wed in a post on social media.\n\nShanola had taken to Twitter on Thursday (14Jul16) to celebrate the six Primetime Emmy nominations Sam's sci-fi series Mr. Robot had landed, but she appeared to let some news slip as she congratulated her pal's man.\n\n\"To the genius that is @samesmail,\" she began, \"CONGRATS on marrying my girl @emmyrossum, oh and on SIX #EmmyNominations!\"\n\nRossum did not comment directly on the marriage reference, but shared the message on her Twitter page and replied with a smiley face emoji.\n\nHer coy post sparked reports the couple may have already become husband and wife, but Emmy returned to Twitter later on Friday to clear up the claims.\n\nAfter one fan asked if the news was true, she responded, \"hahaha nope not yet!\"\n\nThe actress, 29, is known for keeping her personal life under wraps and she has yet to share any information about her and Sam's wedding plans.\n\nRossum and Esmail met when he directed the actress in 2014 romantic comedy/drama Comet."
