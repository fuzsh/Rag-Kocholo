        "text": "Emmy Rossum delighted her Instagram followers on Thursday morning as she revealed the arrival of her second child with her 45-year-old husband, Sam Esmail.\n\nThe 36-year-old Shameless actress shared the news of their baby boy's birth, simply writing: \"On a foggy Wednesday morning, our son was born.\"\n\nAccompanying the announcement was a close-up image of the newborn's face. Rossum, who did not appear pregnant when spotted at Disneyland in December, also posted a bump photo, confirming she carried the baby herself.\n\nSTORY: Emmy Rossum goes natural for Burt's Bees campaign\n\nThe couple's well-guarded secret came as a surprise to fans, as there had been no sightings of Rossum with a baby bump nor any rumors of her pregnancy.\n\nEmmy and Sam are already parents to their two-year-old daughter, Samantha.\n\nIn her post, Rossum included a black-and-white card displaying her newborn son's footprints and birth details.\n\nHe was born on April 5 at 10:40 am, weighing 6lbs 14oz and measuring 19.5 inches in length. The actress also shared a photo of her bare baby bump, lifting her striped shirt to reveal her pregnancy.\n\nFans expressed shock and congratulatory messages in the comments, praising Emmy for her ability to maintain privacy. One fan noted the refreshing nature of Rossum's desire for privacy, urging the actress to: \"enjoy every beautiful moment with your growing family.\"\n\nEmmy similarly kept her first pregnancy under wraps, surprising fans with an Instagram announcement in May 2021.\n\nIn a series of heartfelt images, she unveiled her baby bump and shared her daughter's footprint, celebrating her arrival on a sunny Monday morning.\n\nThe second photo featured Esmail tenderly standing behind Rossum, his hands on her stomach, while she rested a hand on his shoulder. Although the couple did not share a photo of their newborn at the time, they offered a glimpse of their daughter's tiny footprint.\n\nEmmy Rossum, known for her role in The Phantom Of The Opera, married Mr. Robot creator Sam Esmail in 2017, following her previous marriage to music executive Justin Siegel from 2008 to 2010.\n\nRead more HELLO!
