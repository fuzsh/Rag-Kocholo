Rossum, 36, posted a series of three photos including one of herself shortly before giving birth, another of the newborn's footprints and a close-up of her son's lips. \"On a foggy Wednesday morning, our son was born,\" she wrote.\n\nThe news came as a surprise to fans of Rossum, who had kept her pregnancy private.\n\nThe photos also revealed that the child was born at 10:40 a.m., weighed 6 pounds, 14 ounces, and measured 19.5 inches at birth.\n\nRossum and Esmail, 45, who were married in 2017, also have a daughter, who was born in May 2021. The couple met in 2014 on the set of the movie \"Comet,\" which she starred in and which was directed by Esmail.\n\nRossum was previously married to music executive Justin Siegel from 2008 until their divorce in 2010."
