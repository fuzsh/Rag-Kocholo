        "text": "Emmy's Featured on the Hamptons.com\n\nPrime Time Emmy\n\nEmmy Rossum heats up the summer with a new album.\n\nThe actress/singer Emmy Rossum, who turns 21 in September, has a wonderful memory of celebrating her sixth birthday in Southampton, where she also spent most of her childhood summers. \"It was the best birthday party ever,\" she says. There was a Beauty and the Beast theme: An actress dressed as Belle and an actor as Lumiere, the candelabra, led all the guests in a sing-a-long. At the end of the party, Rossum was so excited she stripped down to her, well, birthday suit, then jumped in the pool, butt naked. \"I didn't like clothes at all then,\" says Rossum, who now shows up to New York events regularly dressed in Chanel, Ralph Lauren, and Valentino. \"It was very embarrassing to my family,\" she jokes. \"Skinny-dipping is apparently not that chic.\"\n\nRossum, a native New Yorker, a one-time Spence student, a trained opera singer, and the precocious star of Poseidon, The Phantom of the Opera, and the weather-disaster blockbuster The Day After Tomorrow, is once again getting ready to, if not bare her skin, then at least show a more vulnerable side of herself. Her first album, the solo effort Inside Out, will be given a full-scale release by Universal/Geffen in October. But keeping up with the times, three tracks from the album, including the single \"Slow Me Down\" and a making-of documentary, will be available on iTunes on July 24.\n\n\"I didn't want to wait for the traditional release 'cause I knew it'd be a while,\" says Rossum, who will vacation in the Hamptons later this summer when she visits her old friend Lily Vonnegut, the daughter of the late Kurt Vonnegut. \"I really want to start sharing it right away.\" Then she corrects herself: \"Not illegal sharing! I don't think you should download my album on Napster or LimeWire. I mean I think that music is about emotional connection and there's no better way than to share that with people.\"\n\nShe compares her album's sound to the techno-cool vocals of Imogen Heap. The mixing of the record involved putting it through a program called Logic, then importing the sound into a keyboard. \"So I actually can play my own voice on the piano,\" she says. Kids these days!\n\nThat said, her music is far from detached. \"It's about taking me as I am, inside out,\" Rossum says. \"To have that kind of vulnerability on the record is scary for me, but at the same time, it's the whole reason I made it.\"\n\nMarshall Heyman: So let's talk about your record: What was the genesis of it?\n\nEmmy Rossum: I'd wanted to do a record ever since I was little. It never occurred to me that it would be possible until after we recorded the soundtrack to The Phantom of the Opera, which was my second time in a recording studio. The first time was when I was 14, right after I shot the movie Songcatcher. Dolly Parton personally approached me and asked if she could write a duet for us, to go on the soundtrack for that film. She flew me out to Nashville, and it was the first time I'd ever been in a recording studio. And I knew it was a place that I loved. After The Phantom of the Opera, I was approached by some labels to make a record. The most obvious kind of record would be a \"popera\" record like Josh Groban. Nothing against Josh, because I'm friends with him and I think he's tremendously talented, but for me, I'd been at the opera for a while and I wanted to record something totally different. And Ron Fair, who was at Geffen, said, \"Let's not do the record everyone's expecting you to make. Why don't you go off for a few months, work with a lot of people, and find your sound, find your voice, find what you want to write about, develop yourself as a writer?\" I've always written poetry and journals, but I had never really written music before.\n\nMH: What was the process of writing the new songs?\n\nER: It was kind of like blind dating. I mean, you sit down with people and you never know what the chemistry's going to be. This was the first time I was not doing a movie or playing a character, and I didn't have to do anything but be myself and express who I am. Which, in a sense, was one of the scariest things. I also wanted a sound that I felt really represented me. And I wanted to use my voice as much as I could because a lot of pop-rock music isn't vocal-driven. A lot of the musicians that have influenced me, like Sigur Ros, Jem, Sinead O'Connor, and David Gray, find a way to be vocally driven and very unique. So I started experimenting with layering, and what beats I couldcreate using my voice in a percussive way, and it just started to evolve. And I found this little studio in the valley where I felt safe and cozy and could express myself, and then it was off to the races.\n\nMH: Did the process surprise you in any way?\n\nER: It's so unlike making movies. I mean a film is like a little factory. As an actor you're really just one piece of the puzzle. And then you leave your scenes there, they edit them, they can shape them in different ways, and then everyone gets together again to see the finished product at the premiere. It's a completely strange experience--sometimes you pour your heart and soul into it and then they cut your favorite scene. As an actor, you're just one instrument in the song. Recording Inside Out, I felt like I was the director and the writer and the actor and the editor. I got to choose which emotional direction the songs went in. For the first time I felt like a director must feel with a studio; how much pressure it is to have all those people to answer to. And I have even more respect for directors now, because as an actor you're just one instrument in the song.\n\nMH: Did you experience any of the strife with your label that, say, Kelly Clarkson seems to have had?\n\nER: I experienced nothing but support and love, and Ron Fair is a wonderful human being--he has been my shepherd and my guide. And he was behind Christina Aguilera and so many other strong female voices, like Keyshia Cole and Mary J. Blige. He gave me a lot of freedom--here I am, a new artist, trying to find a sound that's unique and they could have hated it.\n\nMH: As a young person in Hollywood, do you feel like you have to be a multi-hyphenate?\n\nER: People know me as an actress, but I've been a musician for longer than I knew how to act. And I think it's always helpful to do lots of different things. I mean I really respect Jennifer Lopez; she does films, she does music, she does fashion, fragrance, she really is incredibly diversified. I can't even imagine how hard that woman must work.\n\nMH: Do you feel that agents, managers, and publicists are trying to figure out ways to branch out and brand you, like on Entourage?\n\nER: I don't like to think of myself as a brand because I've never really felt like I was selling anything, you know? I just think of myself as Emmy. I never wanted to put my name on anything that I didn't think was going to be worth the price of the ticket. I never want to sell anybody anything that I don't think is great, that I wouldn't want to spend my own money on.\n\nMH: Has your mom heard the whole album?\n\nER: She's heard a lot of it. She hasn't heard the sexier numbers. I won't play those for her.\n\nMH: So there are sexier numbers?\n\nER: There is romantic, sexy stuff on there. That's not getting played for the family.\n\nMH: Does your mom know about the sexier numbers?\n\nER: Yeah, of course.\n\nMH: And what does she say?\n\nER: \"Oh, God, I don't want to hear those!\"\n\nMH: But she really does want to hear them?\n\nER: Of course, yeah. She's an artist--she's a photographer. I've always hated taking pictures because I feel like they'll never be as good as her pictures. And she can't carry a tune, so we're perfect together. And if she had images that were sexy, I don't think I'd want to see them.\n\nMH: What are your favorite things to do in the Hamptons?\n\nER: I like how chill the Hamptons are, though sometimes it's such a scene, you feel like you have to put your makeup on to go to like the beach. I like renting bikes. I'm a big biker. And I love to fish. It's very un-girly and strange of me, but I do.\n\nMH: What memories of fishing do you have?\n\nER: Um, you know, getting hooks stuck in my feet and every other which way. I went to Alaska when I was seven and caught 40 salmon in one day. But I'm always going out fishing with the boys. The last time I went was a year and a half ago in the Caribbean. I accidentally caught a shark.\n\nMH: Are you planning to go on tour?\n\nER: I hope so. I'm lucky to have a good, strong fan-base in Asia, because of a lot of the big-budget movies that I've done did really well over there. Phantom apparently made $40 million in Korea. So, Korea, here I come.\n\nEmmy's Hampton Style\n\nSPF: Mario Badescu Body Sun Block 30+\n\nFlipflops: Coach for running around town; Jimmy Choo for lounging by the pool or with a pretty sundress for lunch in town, and Mella for the beach.\n\nHamptons workout: Morning yoga on the beach.\n\nSunglasses: Prada or Vera Wang (my cousin!)\n\nBeach bag: Tory Burch canvas tote.\n\nHat: White Ralph Lauren straw hat.\n\nFavorite local stores:Candy Kitchen, Bridgehampton, The Monogram Shop, East Hampton, Blue & Cream, East Hampton, Village Cheese Shop, Southampton\n\nSummer beverage: Mint lemonade or watermelon juice.\n\nRainy-day activity: Boardgames like Clue, Monopoly, and Jenga.\n\nSurf or turf?
