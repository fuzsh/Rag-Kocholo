        "text": "One could understand if Hilary Swank resents Emmy Rossum, her co-star in the new film “You’re Not You,” opening Friday.\n\nThat’s because during filming, Swank had to restrict her diet to show herself wasting away ­— while Rossum had the opposite challenge: eating all she could to add muscle for the task of having to lift a dying woman.\n\n“There was a lot of bonding while I was stuffing my face with chocolate chip cookies and she was fasting on green juices,” says Rossum, 28, who plays Bec, an unqualified caretaker to Swank’s Kate, an ALS patient. “I’m glad the shoe wasn’t on the other foot, because I can get really hangry.”\n\nPart of the challenge of playing Bec was the physical intimacy she has to develop with Swank. During one of their first scenes together, Bec has to help Kate in the shower, even holding the naked woman.\n\n“It was so cold that when they turned the water off, we just wanted to sit in the hot water. So we found ourselves sitting in the shower, staying in the moment between takes,” Rossum recalls. “It’s very intimate when you’re touching another person’s body in the way that a caretaker does. It’s an intensely emotional thing.”\n\n“Intensely emotional” is Rossum’s specialty of late. As one of the stars of the gritty, darkly humorous Showtime series “Shameless,” she plays a poverty-stricken young woman struggling to build a life for herself and her abandoned younger siblings even as she makes breathtaking mistakes. This past season, the show’s fourth, found her character imprisoned for accidentally exposing her baby brother to cocaine. The role requires a naked performance from Rossum — sometimes emotionally, sometimes literally.\n\nBut she wasn’t always so willing to expose herself.\n\nIt wasn’t publicly known that Rossum, then 21, had married record executive Justin Siegel in 2008 until he filed for divorce 18 months later. She has said that they rushed into it. “Honestly, I was so young, I don’t think I knew what marriage meant,” the actress recently told Cosmopolitan. “My parents were never married, and I was teased in school and called a bastard.”\n\nRossum was raised in New York City by her mom, a photographer who split up with her father before Emmy was born. The actress came to show business as a vocal prodigy in the Metropolitan Opera Children’s Chorus, performing with legends Plácido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti before hitting her teens. She cops to being “the princessy girl who sang a lot” in her early, often precious acting roles, including the 2004 film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “The Phantom of the Opera,” alongside Gerard Butler.\n\nNowadays, Rossum lives in Los Angeles ­— where the paparazzi snap her daily goings-on — but still regularly crashes at her mother’s place on the Upper East Side, the land where photographers don’t bother to tread.\n\n“I walk out of my mom’s apartment, where I sleep on the couch, and it’s normal life,” she says. “There’s no paparazzi because not enough cool people live there. I eat my sandwich at EJ’s [Luncheonette], and nobody cares.”\n\nThe tabloids, however, are curious about her dating life — and she’s no longer hiding her relationships. After her divorce, Rossum dated singer Adam Duritz and her “Shameless” co-star Tyler Jacob Moore.\n\nShe met her current boyfriend (“a nice guy,” she says), Sam Esmail, when he directed her in the upcoming film “Comet.” A time-jumping love story with a dark edge, it gives Rossum another chance to overhaul her former goody-goody image. And that suits her just fine."
