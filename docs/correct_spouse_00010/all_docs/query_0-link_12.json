Secret wedding?\n\nWhat the hell?\n\nI love a good secret wedding. It's like a soap opera!\n\ni agree. it makes her marginally more interesting.\n\nsecret babies are better.\n\nThat picture is amazing.\n\nI can't look away...\n\nI can't look away from your icon ಠ_ಠ\n\nlol irl.\n\nShe pulled a Janet Jackson.\n\nthat picture is somewhat terrifying\n\nlol oh emmy\n\nMeh. I am so whelmed.\n\nDo you live in Europe?\n\nYou just made me very happy :O)\n\nlmao. A+ reference\n\nLOL, 10 things ftw.\n\nlmao\n\nlmao\n\n22? She seems so much older! I think I like her...I'm not sure. She seems super full of herself but I could be wrong.\n\nNo, you're right. Very very right.\n\nBut I could just be jealous. Except at least I don't have warts on my face. :D\n\nShe's always been very sweet with her fans and much more accessible and interactive than many, so take her interviews with a pinch of salt.\n\nNo, you are very much right. A friend of mine worked on the set of that Sean Penn movie she was in and said none of the crew could stand her. Incredibly smug and entitled, but is under the impression she is adorable and charming!\n\nOh. Well that's a shame.\n\njesus, that picture is scary.\n\njanet did it better\n\nFor almost a decade to boot.\n\nlmao member when Beyonce tried to do the same thing and the press was like \"lmao not so fast bitch\"\n\nHer face always managed to freak me out.\n\nIn some photoshoots Emmy kind of looks like Angelina to me, like she could be her long last bb sister.\n\nThe expression on the little boy's face is priceless. You know he's looking at his mom and going, \"Can you believe this bitch???\""
