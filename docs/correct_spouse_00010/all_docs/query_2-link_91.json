        "text": "What do Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox Arquette, Mary-Louise Parker and now Emmy Rossum all have in common? An affinity for Hollywood's dreadlocked heartbreaker, Counting Crows frontman Adam Duritz.\n\nRossum, the star of \"The Phantom of The Opera,\" made headlines earlier this week with her divorce from music executive Justin Siegel, and the 23-year-old appears to be back to making more sweet music with 45-year-old \"Mr. Jones\" singer.\n\nVIEW THE PHOTOS: Jennifer Aniston: From TV 'Friend' To Box Office Superstar\n\nAccording to People, Adam and Emmy have been spotted dining together in both LA And NYC. While at NYC's Dos Caminos, the duo was reportedly \"extremely affectionate with each other,\" a source claimed. \"They were sitting side by side, and kissing throughout dinner.\"\n\nBut is Emmy just another notch on Adam's actress bedpost?\n\nVIEW THE PHOTOS: Divorce! Break-Ups! Hollywood's Most Famous Former Couples\n\nAdam has been previsouly linked to \"Weeds\" star Mary-Louise Parker in the '90s, and they reportedly remain good friends. They attended the 2008 Tony Awards together.\n\nAdam also cast his spell over two \"Friends\" star – and no, it's not Lisa Kudrow.\n\nHe first dated Courteney Cox Arquette after she appeared in the video for 1997's \"A Long December.\" (See Adam and Courteney, HERE!)\n\nVIEW THE PHOTOS: Celeb Groupies: Stars Who Love Rock N' Roll Stars!\n\nAdam then dated Jennifer Aniston, but the actor has claimed in multiple interviews that their relationship was not serious, People reported.\n\nThe rocker explained to the mag that life as a musician has been rough on all of his romances.\n\n\"[My love life] is a disaster. The road really screwed up a couple of things,\" he told People in January 2005 when asked about keeping his relationships alive while still pursuing his rock star dreams. \"I really don't know. I haven't figured [love] all out yet.\"\n\nBut has he figured out his thing for ladies of the big (and small) screen?\n\n[They] have a similar kind of lifestyle,\" he told British music magazine Q in June 1999, explaining that he \"never got to date the cheerleaders\" in high school. \"Also they're often independent, driven and, very, very attractive. Being with certain people, even if it brings all this unwanted attention is… just worth all the weirdness in the world.\"\n\nWith Mary-Louise Parker's recent Emmy win, Courteney's successful return to scripted TV and Jennifer's huge big screen success all occurring after they dated the rocker – AccessHollywood.com couldn't help but wonder if Adam is the good luck charm to Hollywood's leading ladies. Is there award show fame in the future for Emmy?\n\nRelated Content from AccessHollywood.com:\n\nPLAY IT NOW: Aaron Eckhart & Jennifer Aniston: 'Love' Is In The Air\n\nPLAY IT NOW: Courteney Cox Is The New 'Cougar' In Town\n\nMORE ACCESS ON THESE TOPICS: Couples - Emmy Rossum - Mary-Louise Parker - Weeds - Music"
