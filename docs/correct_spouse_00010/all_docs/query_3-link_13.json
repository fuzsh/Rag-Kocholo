        "text": "In a surprise announcement, actress Emmy Rossum shared on Thursday that she and producer husband Sam Esmail have welcomed a new member to their family.\n\n“On a foggy Wednesday morning, our son was born,” Rossum posted on her verified Instagram account, noting the child’s April 5 birth date. Rossum’s post also included snapshots of her son’s newborn footprints, her pregnant belly, and a sweet black and white photo of the baby snuggled up in a blanket.\n\nThe couple are also parents to a 22-month-old daughter.\n\nThe announcement comes as a surprise to the general public. Rossum kept the news secret that she and “Mr. Robot” creator Esmail were expecting until Thursday’s birth announcement.\n\nWhat’s not a surprise, however, is that Rossum was able to pull off such a feat.\n\nIn May 2021, Rossum delivered the news that they had welcomed their daughter on Instagram after never previously sharing that she was pregnant.\n\nThe “Shameless” star is notoriously private but posted a moving message on Mother’s Day last year that included photos of her daughter.\n\n“The first year has been full of playing, crawling, eating, carrying pacifiers in mouths and holding hands. I am so deeply grateful to be your mom,” her post read."
