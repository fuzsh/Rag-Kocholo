        "text": "Rossum later shared another snap of her baby bump taken before she gave birth. In the black-and-white pic, she stood on a windowsill while holding her bump. \"Two weeks before our daughter was born,\" she captioned the post.\n\nEsmail popped the question in 2015 after the pair got together two years earlier. They then tied the knot in May 2017 in a romantic ceremony at Central Synagogue in New York City and had a reception at the Guggenheim Museum, according to PEOPLE.\n\nThe same year she got married, Rossum reflected on being raised by a single mom. \"Growing up in a school — and a world — filled with mostly two parent units was difficult for me. Father’s Day still is difficult for me. I’m not really sure how to celebrate. In the weeks leading up to it, I sense it coming like a wave approaching. Sometimes I try to ignore it. … Sometimes, I take my mom to brunch and get her a present, to show her how much I value her,\" she wrote on Facebook at the time."
