        "text": "(The Frisky) -- Oh no! \"Beaches\" actress Barbara Hershey and \"Lost\" hottie Naveen Andrews broke up? Wait a minute, were they ever dating?\n\nPeople referred to them as one of Hollywood's \"more endearing couples,\" but who knew the 41-year-old TV star was dating the 62-year-old actress? Apparently, they'd been dating since 1998 -- with a short split in 2005 when Andrews fathered a child with another woman (oops!) -- but broke up quietly six months ago? What do they think this is -- a deserted island? You don't get privacy when you're famous!\n\nIn honor of Barbara and Naveen, we've rounded up a few other couples who broke up ... before anyone realized they were actually involved.\n\nThe Frisky: Clooney's girlfriend says Jennifer Aniston looks like haggard rocker\n\nEmmy Rossum\n\nEmmy Rossum surprised us last summer when she got divorced from music exec Justin Siegel. We had no idea the 22-year-old actress had gotten married to begin with! Apparently, the unhappy couple met in 2007 and paid for their marriage license to be confidential. Sounds kind of \"Phantom of the Opera\"-esque, maybe, with the secret shadowy love affair.\n\nJanet Jackson\n\nJanet Jackson did a good job of keeping her relationship with dancer/songwriter/music video director Ren√© Elizondo Jr. a secret. The couple met in the 80s, got secretly married in 1991 and divorced in 1999. The bummer about secret marriages is the not-so-secret divorce, which in this case ended in Jackson paying out an alleged $15 million, a Mercedes, and an $8 million Malibu beachfront home. Yowch.\n\nThe Frisky: Stars who ended their relationships to chase fame\n\nFreida Pinto\n\nIt came out last year that Freida Pinto had a secret husband named Rohan Antao, who she allegedly left in the dirt after \"Slumdog Millionaire\" came out and she fell for her co-star, Dev Patel. To be fair, we didn't know who she was before the movie came out, so of course we didn't know she was married. But, apparently, neither did anyone else. Even her agent claims to know nothing of a husband.\n\nThe Frisky: 10 famous men stayed with their mistresses\n\nMichael Cera\n\nEmo kids everywhere mourned the breakup of Michael Cera and Charlyne Yi last year, even though their alleged three-year relationship was all kept very hush-hush until \"Paper Hearts\" came out. The relationship was denied altogether by Yi, even though reports said that she was \"heartbroken\" over the sudden breakup. Huh?\n\nThe Frisky: 10 stars who've been defrauded\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nIt came out that Kim Kardashian's 2000 marriage to music producer Damon Thomas was totally abusive and ended badly. Sure, Kim wasn't really famous in 2000, but we didn't realize she'd already been through the marriage ringer. After divorcing in 2004, Kim was given a $56K settlement ... which I think is less than she gets for Twittering now?\n\nBob Dylan\n\nBob Dylan had a secret marriage to back-up singer Carolyn Dennis in 1986, fathered a secret daughter with her named Desi, and they secretly divorced six years later. Dylan set the two up in a house in a suburb of Los Angeles and managed to keep the relationship secret for 15 years. Dennis says the decision was mutual. \"Bob and I made a choice to keep our marriage a private matter for a simple reason -- to give our daughter a normal childhood,\" she says.\n\nThe Frisky: Heidi Klum and Seal to spill love secrets on new TV show"
