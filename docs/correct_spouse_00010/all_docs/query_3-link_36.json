They got engaged in 2015 and married in 2017.\n\nRossum was raised by a single parent, as she reflected on in a 2017 Facebook post.\n\n\"I had a single mom. I have a single mom. This isn’t a secret,\" she said at the time, per Us Weekly. \"Growing up in a school — and a world — filled with mostly two parent units was difficult for me.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRossum continued: \"Father’s Day still is difficult for me. I’m not really sure how to celebrate. In the weeks leading up to it, I sense it coming like a wave approaching. Sometimes I try to ignore it. … Sometimes, I take my mom to brunch and get her a present, to show her how much I value her.\"\n\nThe actress gushed over her mother, who she said filled both maternal and paternal roles in her life.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\n\"I don’t like her to know that it still causes me pain — 30 years later — lest she feel somehow that she wasn’t enough,\" she said. \"She was always enough. She is enough. She wasn’t perfect, no one is, but for me she was the best mom ever.\""
