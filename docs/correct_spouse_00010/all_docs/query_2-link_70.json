        "text": "Emmy Rossum only fancies nerds.\n\nThe 'Shameless' actress - who plays Fiona Gallagher in the hit U.S. remake of the British TV show - says her type is a brainy guy who can teach her about the world, and admits she would never go after a typically handsome man.\n\nShe told People magazine: ''I'm kinda more attracted to the nerd. I'm really into guys who are super smart and funny and can teach me something I don't know about.''\n\nEmmy has previously dated her 'Shameless' co-star Tyler Jacob Moore and was married to music executive Justin Siegel until 2009, and insists it's important to not be ''shallow'' about men's looks.\n\nThe 27-year-old star believes personality always trumps looks and advises women to fall for what's inside before worrying about the outside.\n\nShe added: ''Girls, and guys too, are so shallow that we don't give a chance to the good guy who's maybe not as cute. They're kinda like a fixer-upper apartment.\n\n''You need to pick the guy who's really good inside and then give him a makeover. Turn him into the perfect version of himself. You can never change what's inside, that's the problem. You can change their jacket and their hairstyle, and buy them a Clarisonic.''"
