        "text": "Shameless star Emmy Rossum is infamously private about her dating life. When the Fiona Gallagher actor married her current husband, Sam Esmail, in 2017, they had a clandestine ceremony. The couple also didn’t announce their wedding until it already happened. So, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the Showtime alum kept her relationship with one of her co-stars a secret as well.\n\nEmmy Rossum played Fiona Gallagher on ‘Shameless’ for nine seasons\n\nAfter finding success in several movies, including The Day After Tomorrow and Phantom of the Opera, Rossum joined the Shameless cast in the 2010s. The series aired its first episode on Jan. 9, 2011. During her time on the show, fans watched as Rossum’s character raised her siblings without little help from their father, Frank Gallagher (William H. Macy). Additionally, she worked as a director in the show’s later seasons.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter. Rossum earned $350,000 an episode for Shameless in 2016. However, she announced that she planned to leave the series in 2017. On her Facebook page, the actor shared that playing Fiona was a “gift,” and she will miss the cast and crew.\n\n“I know you will continue on without me, for now,” Rossum wrote. “There is much more Gallagher story to be told. I will always be rooting for my family. Try not to think of me as gone. Just think of me as moving down the block.”\n\nIn her Facebook announcement, Rossum described her longtime character as a “mother lion, fierce, flawed and sexually liberated.” On Shameless, viewers saw Fiona search for love in between supporting her family. Throughout nine seasons, the eldest Gallagher sibling had multiple boyfriends. However, one of her most notable love stories is with Steve/Jimmy (Justin Chatwin).\n\nDuring the show’s first season, Fiona and Steve briefly parted ways after a fight. In episode three, “I’m Just Not Wired That Way,” she decides to go on a date with a cop in her neighborhood, Tony Markovich (Tyler Jacob Moore). Although they ultimately have sex in the back of his car, Fiona gets back with Steve shortly after their date.\n\nAlthough Fiona and Tony weren’t a match, Rossum and Moore made a real-life connection. According to Us Weekly, the couple dated for two years following her 2010 divorce from Justin Siegel. The outlet shared that their relationship was mostly private, and their fans didn’t know they were together until they broke up in 2013.\n\nIs Rossum returning to the ‘Shameless’ cast as Fiona?\n\nFollowing her split from Moore, Rossum met Esmail. In August 2015, the actor and the Mr. Robot creator announced their engagement, per E! News. The pair tied the knot in May 2017 at a temple in New York. Since leaving Shameless as Fiona, Rossum appeared in a Peacock mini-series called Angelyne. She also had a guest spot on Mr. Robot in 2015."
