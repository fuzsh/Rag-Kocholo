        "text": "Emmy Rossum is a mom of two!\n\nThe “Shameless” alum welcomed her second child, her first boy, with husband Sam Esmail on Wednesday.\n\n“04.05.23,” Rossum wrote via Instagram Thursday. “On a foggy Wednesday morning, our son was born.”\n\nThe “Angelyne” star shared her son’s footprints and revealed that he weighed in at 6 pounds, 14 ounces and 19.5 inches tall when he was born at 10:40 a.m.\n\nRossum – who kept her pregnancy quiet – also posted a photo of her baby snuggling in her neck and a mirror selfie of her showing off her baby bump.\n\nThe couple became parents in May 2021 when Rossum, 36, gave birth to a baby girl, whose name she has yet to reveal.\n\nThe actress, who had kept her first pregnancy a secret, posted a throwback maternity shoot photo to Instagram when she announced that she became a mom.\n\n“5.14.21,” she captioned the baby bump snap. “On a sunny Monday morning, at 8:13AM, we welcomed our daughter into the world.”\n\nRossum waited until May of the following year to describe her birth experience in detail, revealing she nearly welcomed her infant in an Uber.\n\n“I ended up getting a lovely and very conscientious Uber driver, which is not what you want when you’re in labor,” she joked to Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest of her drive to the hospital.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n“I want[ed] to go [fast],” she recalled. “I was basically 10 minutes away from having a child. It had progressed very quickly.”\n\nWhile the actress pressured her driver to “go, go, go,” he focused on getting the then-expectant star to her destination “safely.”\n\nSince welcoming her little one, Rossum has been intentional about keeping her child’s face off social media.\n\nThe “Cold Pursuit” star has only shown the back of the toddler’s head while documenting her blowing bubbles and watching waves, among other sweet moments."
