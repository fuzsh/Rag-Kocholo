        "text": "Emmy Rossum and director Sam Esmail are married! The couple tied the knot in an intimate ceremony on Sunday.\n\nRossum and Esmail—who directed the star in Comet—wed in a small ceremony held at a synagogue in New York City, People reports. She wore a bespoke ivory Carolina Herrera wedding dress with a dramatic off-the-shoulder neckline and a fit-and-flare cut, topped off by a sweeping cathedral-length veil. Rossum kept her jewelry simple, wearing only teardrop earrings, which really set off the gown.\n\nRossum has often worn Herrera’s designs on the red carpet—including at this year’s Met Gala—and has said she trusted the designer to create anything her heart desired. And Rossum might just win the award for the most low-key bride ever:\n\n“I don’t really care what the dress looks like,” Rossum said back in February. But her dress wasn’t the only detail the star stayed hands-off on: “I don’t really care what the plates look like. I don’t really care what the invitation looks like. The only thing that’s really important to me is that we get married and there’s some kind of party.”\n\nOf course, the dress turned out gorgeous—check it out below:\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAnd the back of the gown, plus that veil:\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nRossum also posted this sweet pic of her and Esmail at the altar:\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAccording to People, the wedding guest list included Robert Downey Jr., William H. Macy, Rami Malek, Christian Slater, Charly Chaikin, and Hilary Swank. Swank posted a message of congratulations to the couple on her Instagram, captioning it, “Wishing you nothing but a lifetime of love and happiness [Rossum]. You will be the most beautiful bride. Congratulations!”\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nRossum and Esmail, creator of Mr. Robot, got engaged in August 2015 after two years of dating. Previously, Rossum was married to music executive Justin Siegel from 2008 to 2010.\n\nEsmail gave Rossum a classic solitaire engagement ring; the bauble came from jeweler Neil Lane’s archival collection of historical rings.\n\n“I like that it’s old and I like to imagine who wore it before me and the life that they had,” Rossum told People. “I don’t know the story behind it, but it’s from 1920 in Paris, so I like that I’ve inherited someone’s story, and I hope that it’s a good one.”\n\nCongratulations to the newlyweds!\n\nRelated Stories:\n\n-Here's a Peek at Emmy Rossum's Totally Timeless Engagement Ring\n\n-Emmy Rossum Is Engaged to Mr. Robot Creator Sam Esmail\n\n-Spotted: Soon-to-be-Bride Emmy Rossum Wearing Wedding Dress"
