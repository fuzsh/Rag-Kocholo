She announced the happy news on Instagram alongside maternity photos, writing, \"5.24.21 On a sunny Monday morning, at 8:13AM, we welcomed our daughter into the world.\"\n\nThe following month, Rossum opened up about her newborn in a post with a sweet snap of herself kissing the baby girl. \"When I was pregnant I got vaccinated,\" she wrote, referring to the COVID-19 vaccine. \"Not only did we have a healthy, beautiful baby girl but we also just learned our daughter now has antibodies. In short, stop being an irresponsible idiot and get the vaccine.\"\n\nIn June 2022, Rossum shared that her daughter had also gotten vaccinated. \"An exciting day we've waited a long time for! Our daughter got her first covid vaccine,\" she wrote, sharing a pic of the tot sporting a bandaid.\n\nRossum shared another of her daughter's firsts in December 2022 when they visited Disneyland. \"My daughter's first time and she agrees â€” it is the happiest place! So much joy with friends, family and Star Wars!!!\""
