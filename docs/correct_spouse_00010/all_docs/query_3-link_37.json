Following an international search for talent and having nearly missed the audition on account of a family engagement, Emmy was asked to audition in person for Webber at his home in New York. \"When I arrived, he just said, 'Shall we?' meaning I was to sing. And I did,\" Emmy has said of the audition. After seeing her audition, Webber felt she proved her ability to play the young opera singer who becomes the opject of the Phantom's obsessive love.
