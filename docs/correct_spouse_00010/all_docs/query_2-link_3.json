        "text": "Emmy Rossum's divorce is certainly not in the Kelsey Grammer territory ... for a mere $57,000, Emmy is now a free woman.\n\nEmmy secretly married Justin Siegel in February, 2008. Under the terms of the final divorce setttlement, obtained by TMZ, Emmy gets to keep the house, her jewelry and other personal stuff. Justin gets to keep an $11,200 security deposit, along with a Mercedes, jewelry and other stuff.\n\nTo equalize things, Emmy also agrees to pay Justin $57,500.\n\nAlthough Justin asked for spousal support when he filed for divorce, he's not getting any.\n\nAccording to the divorce judgment, filed yesterday in L.A. County Superior Court, no spousal support will be awarded to either party."
