        "text": "Emmy Rossum and her husband Sam Esmail exchanged loving looks while making an extremely rare red carpet appearance together, eight months after welcoming their second child, a baby boy, on Monday evening.\n\nWhile attending Netflix's premiere of Leave The World Behind, which Esmail directed and produced, the lovebirds looked every inch the doting couple as they arrived to the Paris Theater in New York City.\n\nOn a rare night away from their little boy, whose name has not been publicly revealed, and two-year-old daughter, Samantha, the Shameless star, 37, oozed elegance in a white gown, complete with a pearl body chain, and matching blazer.\n\nFor the occasion, she wore her dark brown locks in a low ponytail and sported a glamorous makeup look, consisting of a bold pink lipstick, a pretty rose gold eyeshadow and plenty of blush for a healthy glow.\n\nThe mother-of-two, who started her career as a child performer with the Metropolitan Opera, completed her look with a pair of peep-toe heels and and round cut diamond engagement ring.\n\nEsmail, who is best known as the creator, writer, and director of the award-winning series Mr. Robot, looked handsome in a grey suit, black dress shirt and shiny loafers.\n\nHis apocalyptic thriller, Leave The World Behind, which is an adaptation of the Rumaan Alam novel of the same name, stars Julia Roberts, Mahershala Ali with wife Amatus Sami-Karim, Ethan Hawke, Myha'la, Farrah Mackenzie, Charlie Evans, and Kevin Bacon.\n\nRoberts and Hawke play a married couple on vacation who encounter a father (Ali) and daughter who claim to be renting the same AirBnB and who may know more about the impending doom than they let on.\n\nRossum and Esmail met in 2012 on the set of his film, Comet, which he wrote and directed.\n\n'He sent a letter that accompanied the script,' Rossum told Vogue in 2017. 'It's not uncommon for a director to do that, especially for someone for whom it's their first feature, but the tone of the letter and the way he wrote it seemed immediately familiar. He was self-effacing, humble, and funny … I took an immediate liking to the tone and the person who was writing the letter.'\n\nThe duo went public with their relationship in 2014, one year before he proposed by writing a mock column of The New York Times, based on their own love story.\n\n'I realized that he had gone through this whole process of writing this whole story. Apparently he had called Daniel Jones at The New York Times and gotten their paper template and gotten the people there to print out a whole mock section on the bottom half,' she recalled. 'He had even put an ad for the Ralph Lauren Ricky Bag.'\n\nThey ultimately wed on May 28, 2017, at the Central Synagogue in New York City.\n\nTheir reception was held at the Guggenheim Museum.\n\nWhile speaking of her first impression of Esmail, Rossum told Vogue: 'I just thought he was one of the more unique, kind, creative, brilliant people I'd ever met. Just somebody that I always wanted to be around.'\n\nAs for how they manage their hectic schedules and dealing with long distance, at times, Rossum raved they always make sure to 'text multiple times a day' and 'send little videos back and forth on set.'\n\nSince they always try to 'share as much of' their lives as possible, the actress said they 'don't feel that disconnect' when they are apart.\n\n'We are both equally committed to our art, as we always have been, and to each other,' Rossum explained during a chat with Extra.\n\nPreviously, she was married to music executive Justin Siegel from 2008 to 2010.\n\nWhile speaking about their short-lived marriage in 2012, Rossum said: 'Everyone messes up in relationships and has peaks and valleys in their personal lives.'\n\n'When I realized it wasn’t the end of the world and I would keep on standing, I knew it was going to be OK,' she told InStyle Hair.\n\nBefore settling down, the performer was romantically linked to her Shameless costar, Tyler Jacob Moore, Adam Duritz, Chris Evans, Milo Ventimiglia, Topher Grace and David Wildenstein."
