        "text": "A secret surprise! Emmy Rossum announced that she and husband Sam Esmail quietly welcomed their second child.\n\nSee Which Stars Gave Birth in 2023\n\nRead article\n\n“On a foggy Wednesday morning, our son was born,” the Shameless alum, 36, wrote via Instagram on Thursday, April 6, revealing her baby’s birthdate as Wednesday, April 5.\n\nThe little one weighed 6 pounds, 14 ounces and was 19 and a half inches long. While Rossum didn’t show any full photos of the newborn, she shared a picture of his footprints.\n\nThe New York native also gave fans a glimpse at her son’s face from the side in a black-and-white snap.\n\nThe “Slow Me Down” songstress, who never publicly shared she was expecting, later posted a third photo of her pregnant baby bump ahead of her son’s delivery.\n\nRossum’s birth announcement is similar to the one she gave when her daughter was born in May 2021.\n\n“5.24.21 On a sunny Monday morning, at 8:13AM, we welcomed our daughter into the world,” she captioned maternity shoot photos at the time. The You’re Not You actress has yet to reveal her toddler’s name.\n\nEmmy Rossum's Rare Photos of Her and Sam Esmail's Daughter\n\nRead article\n\nThe Phantom of the Opera star — who married the Mr. Robot creator, 45, in May 2017 — waited two months until she posted a photo of her daughter. In July 2021, Rossum shared a sweet snap kissing the back of her head.\n\nAhead of her daughter’s first birthday, Rossum detailed giving birth, describing it as “just about my worst nightmare.” The Angelyne alum explained during a May 2022 appearance on Live With Kelly and Ryan that she took an Uber to the hospital after going into labor in New York City.\n\nIn order to view the video, please allow Manage Cookies\n\n“I had this [mental] picture of me holding on [to the handle above the door] in the car with the baby coming out in the Uber,” she recalled, joking her driver’s reaction to the situation was almost too nice. “When you’re in labor and they’re driving to the hospital — I ended up getting a lovely and very conscientious Uber driver, which is not what you want when you’re in labor. I want to go. If it’s an orange [light], just take that as a green and go.”\n\nEmmy Rossum and Sam Esmail's Relationship Timeline\n\nRead article\n\nRossum continued: “We were driving and we were a couple of minutes away from the hospital and I was fully in contractions and I didn’t realize I was actually nine centimeters dilated at that point, so real close. I was basically 10 minutes away from having a child.”"
