        "text": "Actor Emmy Rossum and her husband, director Sam Esmail, a New Jersey native, welcomed their first child Monday after keeping her pregnancy under wraps.\n\nRossum, 34, announced on Instagram Tuesday night that not only was she recently pregnant, but also that she already had the baby, a girl. She did not give a name.\n\nThe actor’s two-in-one news upended typical celebrity pregnancy announcements. She had shared images from her life throughout the pandemic, but nothing indicating that she was pregnant.\n\n“5.24.21,” she said in her Instagram post Tuesday, captioning pregnancy photos, including one with Esmail, and a footprint of the baby. “On a sunny Monday morning, at 8:13AM, we welcomed our daughter into the world.”\n\nRossum, a New York native who formerly starred as Fiona Gallagher in the Showtime series “Shameless,” had one of her first major roles in Joel Schumacher’s “The Phantom of the Opera” in 2004. She stars in and is a producer of the upcoming limited series “Angelyne.”\n\nEsmail, 43, also produced the Peacock series, which is based on a 2017 Hollywood Reporter story about the real-life Angelyne, a platinum blond Los Angeles billboard star who is known for driving around Hollywood in a pink Corvette. Angelyne, played by Rossum in the series, was “famous for being famous” long before Paris Hilton and the Kardashians. (She’s also currently running for governor of California.)\n\nEsmail, who married Rossum in 2017 after the couple got engaged in 2015, was born in Hoboken. He moved to the South with his family when he was a child before returning to New Jersey, settling in Sewell. Esmail is an alum of Washington Township High School in Gloucester County.\n\nThe director, who created the Emmy-nominated and Golden Globe-winning USA series “Mr. Robot,” starring Rami Malek, also helmed the first installment of the Amazon series “Homecoming,” starring Julia Roberts, Stephan James and Jersey’s Bobby Cannavale.\n\nRossum, sending celebrity outlets buzzing about her “surprise” pregnancy, shared another image on Instagram from two weeks before the baby was born that shows her baby bump in profile.\n\nAs for Esmail, his most recent Instagram post, dated June 2020, was about how it would be his last post because Facebook owns Instagram. He shared an image with the following message:\n\n“Due to Facebook’s insistence on being a propaganda machine for authoritarians, this will be my last post until they decide to take the spread of misinformation on their platforms seriously.”\n\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.
