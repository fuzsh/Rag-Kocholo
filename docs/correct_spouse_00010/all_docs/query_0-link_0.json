        "text": "Emmy Rossum is opening up about her 2010 divorce from music executive Justin Siegel after a year-and-a-half of marriage.\n\n“Everyone messes up in relationships and has peaks and valleys in their personal lives,\" Rossum said in the latest issue of InStyle Hair. \"When I realized it wasn’t the end of the world and I would keep on standing, I knew it was going to be OK.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter her ex-husband filed for divorce in September 2009, the 25-year-old starlet dated Counting Crows frontman Adam Duritz. The pair split in fall 2010 and Rossum has since found love with Tyler Jacob Moore, her co-star on Showtime's \"Shameless.\"\n\nIn the same interview, Rossum revealed that she and Moore have double dated with Lady Gaga, whose boyfriend Taylor Kinney appeared on the Showtime hit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We stayed in, cooked steaks, and watched 'Shameless,'\" the actress said. \"It was all very normal, and she is so nice.”\n\nEmmy discreetly married ex-husband Siegel in February 2008 -- few knew the pair had wed until they split. In his divorce filing, Siegal citied irreconcilable differences and requested spousal support, which he was denied when the divorce was finalized in December 2010."
