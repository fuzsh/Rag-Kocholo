        "text": "Singer / Actress Emmy Rossum is married – but is a divorce coming just as the public finds out about her secret nuptials?\n\nThe Los Angeles County Registrar Recorder’s Office has confirmed to Access Hollywood that a marriage license was issued to Emmy Rossum – whose full name is Emmanuelle Grey Rossum – and one Justin Siegel. Further details about when the couple was married could not be released, as the license is confidential.\n\nBut according to E! Online, news of the couple’s marriage is not something to celebrate. They have reportedly now split.\n\nEmmy, 22, and Justin, 27, reportedly first stepped out as a couple in 2007."
