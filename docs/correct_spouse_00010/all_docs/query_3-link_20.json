Rossum looked elegant in a custom, off-the-shoulder Carolina Herrera gown and veil for the nuptials.\n\nHere's another look at that gorgeous outfit.\n\nRossum, 30, and Esmail, 39, were wed in Central Synagogue, People reports, where they said \"I do\" under a floral chuppah.\n\nThe celebration continued at the Guggenheim Museum, where this lovely photo was taken.\n\nLooked like a fun time!\n\nRossum was previously married to music executive Justin Siegel before the pair split in 2010. According to People, Rossum and Esmail dated for two years and worked on the movie Comet together (he directed; she starred) before getting engaged in August of 2014."
