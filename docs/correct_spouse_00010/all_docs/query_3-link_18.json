        "text": "Emmy Rossum is undoubtedly one of Hollywood's hottest actors, but the leading man in her life is somewhat of a mystery. Rossum is a seasoned veteran in Tinseltown, and she's appeared in plenty of blockbusters, including The Phantom of the Opera and Mystic River. Perhaps her most famous role was that of Fiona Gallagher on Showtime's hit series Shameless, where she starred alongside William H. Macy.\n\nIn August 2018, the actor shocked fans by announcing that she would be leaving her role on the wildly popular series. \"The opportunity to play Fiona has been a gift. There are few characters — female or otherwise — as layered and dynamic,\" she wrote on Facebook at the time. \"She is a mother lion, fierce, flawed, and sexually liberated.\" Rossum also called her time of the series the \"best of [her] life.\"\n\nRossum revealed that she would be leaving to pursue other roles, including a project with her husband. In April 2020, the Los Angeles Times reported that Rossum teamed up with her hubby, Sam Esmail, on the NBC Universal show Angelyne. The pair tied the knot in May 2017, and according to The Hollywood Reporter, the actress and the Mr. Robot creator said their vows in New York City. There were plenty of A-listers in attendance, including Rami Malek, Christian Slater, and Shanola Hampton.\n\nWhile it was undoubtedly a beautiful event, many people were left asking who exactly is Sam Esmail? Keep scrolling to find out!\n\nEmmy Rossum's husband, Sam Esmail, may not star in front of the camera like his wife, but he's outstanding behind it. According to IMDb, Esmail is a talented writer, director, and producer. He's the man behind a few big projects including Mr. Robot, Homecoming, and Comet. As of this writing, Esmail has been nominated for two Primetime Emmys (he really must love the name Emmy), and he's nabbed a Writer's Guild of America award for his work on Mr. Robot.\n\nEsmail is Egyptian American and Muslim, and he told NPR that people bullied him when he was growing up. \"My parents didn't even know it. ... I got beat up. I remember the first day [of] kindergarten,\" he told the publication. \"My older sister Nancy, she was born mentally challenged and so she would get picked on a lot, and therefore I would get sort of residual bullying from that.\" He developed his love of film at a young age and when he was just eight or nine, he would go to the movies for hours by himself. Esmail has more than 100,000 followers on Instagram, and while he doesn't post all too often, he shares a few photos of Rossum here and there.\n\nAccording to People, Esmail and Rossum met on the set of Comet in 2014, and they were engaged the following year. As previously mentioned, they tied the knot in May 2017, and the rest is history!"
