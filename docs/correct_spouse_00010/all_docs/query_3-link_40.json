The Shameless star, 28, and Mr. Robot creator, 37, who have been dating for two years, got engaged over the weekend in Los Angeles.\n\nThe couple sparked engagement rumors last December after the star stepped out in New York City with a diamond ring.\n\nThe now-engaged pair made their debut as a couple in June 2014 at the premiere of Esmailâs flick Cornet, in which Rossum starred.\n\nThank You!\n\nYou have successfully subscribed.\n\nâHeâs a bit of a nerd,â Rossum admitted during an interview on Live! With Kelly & Michael in October 2014. âHe doesnât know chivalry too well, so we have to bust his chops a little bit and tell him every time a woman stood up and went to the restroom, he had to stand up.â\n\nRossum was previously married to Justin Siegel from 2008 to 2010.\n\nncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJympaliv7C%2F0q6kZp2enK6oscNmq6hlkqTGp77InqWdZaOWum6x0qaYoqRdZ31ygZJqbw%3D%3D"
