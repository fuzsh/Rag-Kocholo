        "text": "Two months after it was discovered that Emmy Rossum had been secretly married, her husband is filing for divorce.\n\nJustin Siegel, a music producer, filed papers on Friday at L.A.'s County Superior Court, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nAccording to the documents, which were first reported by TMZ.com, the couple had been married for less than two years and wed in February 2008. (Siegel is seeking spousal support and requests that Rossum pay all divorce costs.)\n\nThe couple began dating in 2007 but never announced plans to wed, instead opting for a confidential marriage license. It wasn't until August, when the pair split, that their secret marriage was reported."
