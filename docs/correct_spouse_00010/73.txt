Emmy Rossum's husband has filed for divorce following a year-and-a-half of marriage, according to E! News.

The Phantom Of The Opera star is reported to have split with music executive Justin Siegel in August.

Rossum has never confirmed the marriage publicly.

Siegel is alleged to have cited "irreconcilable differences" in the divorce papers, which confirm that the couple wed on February 17, 2008. He has also reportedly asked for spousal support and for Rossum to pay his legal fees.

Rossum has yet to comment.
