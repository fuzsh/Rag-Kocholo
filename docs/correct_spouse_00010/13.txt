Itâ€™s officially over between Emmy Rossum and her husband of two years, Justin Siegel.

Siegel finally filed for divorce Friday from his Phantom Of The Opera actress wife, citing irreconcilable differences.

The docs state that the couple were married in February 2008, and Siegel wants Emmy to pay him spousal support and for her to foot the bill for the divorce.

The couple split weeks ago and divorce rumors have been swirling around the notoriously private actress ever since.
