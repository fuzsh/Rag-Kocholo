Emmy Rossum may know how to keep a marriage secret, but her divorce is now a matter of public record.

The Phantom of the Opera star is back on the market after documents were filed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court finalizing her settlement with ex-hubby Justin Siegel for a paltry $57,000.

And the good news? Rossum won't have to pay him any spousal support.

Per the divorce judgment obtained by E! News, the 24-year-old thesp will keep their house in Beverly Hills, her jewelry and some personal accoutrements. While the record company exec will get to keep the $11,200 security deposit on a residence in Coldwater Canyon, along with the pair's Mercedes, some clothes, jewelry and furniture already in his possession.

While Siegel lost his bid for spousal support, the good news is he won't have to pay the actress any, either; Instead, Rossum has also agreed to pony up $57,500 to her onetime spouse to even things out and put their brief union behind her.

After meeting the year before, the duo quietly swapped vows on Feb. 17, 2008. But they spent the next year-and-a-half, pretty much the duration of their marriage, masquerading as boyfriend-girlfriend before Siegel filed for divorce in September 2009, citing irreconcilable differences.

Not long after, Rossum joined a list of beautiful actresses, including Jennifer Aniston, Mandy Moore and Courteney Cox, who have hooked up with Counting Crows' dread-headed frontman Adam Duritz before they broke up this September.
