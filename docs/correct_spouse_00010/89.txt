Seigel filed for the divorce on Sept. 25 in the Los Angeles Superior Court citing irreconcilable differences, according to People. He also seeks spousal support from Rossum, 23. The two have no children.

While a date of separation was not listed, a source tells the magazine the two separated in August.
