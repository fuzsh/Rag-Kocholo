        "text": "Robert William “Bob” Foreskins, Jr. was an English actor, which played roles such as cockneys, and gangsters. His most famous movie he starred in was in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988). He has appeared in several movies such as The long Good Friday, Mona Lisa, Mermaids, Hook, Nixon, A Christmas Carol, Neverland, and Snow White & the Huntsman. Since 2011 he had a long battle with Parkinson’s disease, which in that year he was diagnosed from. On April 29, 2014 in the hospital he died at the age of 71. On April 30, 2014, his agent Clair Dobbs announced that he had died of pneumonia. More is yet to be determined at this time.\n\nWe are all caught in ourselves by being greedy on everything, and not helping others. If there are people helping you out, help them back. Show showmanship, and be a good role model. Nobody likes a person who doesn’t give back to good people. Most people love to do good deeds to nice decent people. Many people care for innocent people who are in tough situations. A friend helping out a friend is always best. You’ll feel much better when you give favors to good people, as when they are passed on to you. I am not saying to give up, and fail. But, everybody has a competitive side in them, as you do. If you see someone who is nice, and doesn’t have any friends, be his or her friend. It doesn’t hurt, and you’re not obligated to anything. You still can be competitive. Your friends do you favors, and you do them favors back helps your ego. Do the good deeds, and help out, as the good deeds will pass on to you, but don’t do any favors to the people who don’t deserve it. Help out your friends, and families.\n\nJohn T. “Jack” Ramsay was an American basketball coach nicknamed as “Dr. Jack”. His best known coaching job was for the Portland Trailblazers in the NBA, which he led them to their only NBA title in 1977. He broadcasted for the Indiana Pacers, Miami Heat, ESPN TV, and ESPN radio. He was among the most respected coaches in NBA history. He is also an NBA basketball Hall of Famer in the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. He has written several books, including The Coaches Art, and Dr. Jack’s Leadership Lessons Learned From a Lifetime in Basketball. He worked for the Miami Heat as a Heat Broadcaster alongside Heat broadcaster Eric Reid from 1992 to 2002 from Sunshine Network (now Sun Sports), Sports Florida, and sometimes local Miami TV station WBFS. He died in April 27,2014. He was 89 years old.\n\nFor some people: money, and the weak mind are their worst enemies to ruin their lives. I am advising you to use the money for the good, not for the worse. The worst case scenario is that money changes some of us as bad, if we have weak minds. If we see it in millions, or billions, then some will use it for the worse. Like most people say money talks, but you have to do it the right healthy way of lifestyle. The money changes some individuals who start out as nice artists, then they turn into the worst persons. The problem is that they don’t see it coming when they receive it. They do realize it when they receive huge amounts of money, then they get bad ideas to do in public with it. The reason is some people get into trouble, or make bizarre lifestyles for themselves, because of it. Don’t be some of those people who think it’s cool to rob someone, or trick innocent people. These people who have money in millions or billions, have to think it over about their lives. Do the right thing, not the wrong. It’s their lives they’re messing with, not ours. If they don’t change, then it’s too late to recover their lives, because soon all it’s lost. The worst case scenario is if you don’t change it for health reasons, then it’s too late. Whatever anyone tells you to do about the money for worst case scenarios don’t change into the person that your friends and families don’t want you to. If you do, then you blame others for it, and it’s your loss. For some: money and the weak mind; It can really make you jump into conclusions about the people who care for you the most. Have a talk with your parents first.\n\nI think that ghosts are a real part of the reasons of why your life is better, and well. They care about us humans. When they see us acting out negative they want to change it into a positive. I know you might think that ghosts changing your life might be crazy, but they probably are of why your life is socially well. Even if you don’t see them they do us favors, by letting some people become our friends. I think it has happened before, and they sometimes give you favors in life. It is strange and crazy, but they help out of our own problems. Ghosts do know who the jerks are, and know how to handle them. Have you realized that you’re not procrastinating anymore? Yes, you do! They are the reason you aren’t doing it anymore. Sometimes or most of the time they make you be more alert, and react better. Ghosts do help out in your situations. Another thing is that they help you get a job that is more suitable for you. They let you think normal, and they want you to do your chores in your home. This means you need to do your chores yourself. I know all this sounds silly, but this is probably the reason you are much decent, and nicer.\n\nMost of us have seen many people throw their lives down the toilet. Many celebrities took their own lives, because of personal reasons. I think by saving your own life you should realize, that you can make yourself happy again. Not all people are good and nice like some of us are. We have to let other people’s problems go on as it is, because it’s not our problems. It’s theirs. Of course, we care about all good people, but we need to but out. I have seen many shocking things that went on not only to important people, but to average decent people that didn’t mean any harm. You should treat your life with dignity and respect. Don’t let evil, and bad people push all over you. I don’t care who they are. Make a stand, and protect your life. When I see someone trying to make problems with me, I just walk away. The most important thing is from most problems is to walk away. When you do this it becomes that person’s problem, and it’s not yours anymore. It brings you a lot of sigh of relief. Some people don’t see life clearly, and think in their own perspective of life for what it should be. This shouldn’t be how life should be viewed by someone else’s stupid rules. We have rules to live by, our freedoms, and they should be respected. Life is what you make of it, not by people of how they view it. People’s likes, and votes should be respected. Don’t bash people, the things that they go for, and who they go out with. If you do this, then you’ve got a major problem, even if you don’t think it’s your problem. It actually is. Life is life. God is love and respect. Anyway this is my 200th post, and I am speaking from the heart. Peace. Love. Freedom. Smiles, and happy faces!!!\n\nKaty Perry is an American recording artist, singer, businesswoman, philanthropist, and actress. She went on to a music career in Gospel music.

I was trying to make sense of it all, but know some of the things he has explained. I need to watch his show series several times, which I intend to do. The other show I was watching today was How The Universe Works, and then Through the Wormhole with Morgan Freeman. I was trying to understand all of it, and it seems that these too I need to repeat seeing it. I think I know some of the things, but love astronomy anyway. I think I have sort of complete understanding of some of the things the universe acts on nature in space. In outer space nature is real strange, this is the reason I enjoy watching these shows. They keep you guessing what the host is explaining you in order to learn from it. I have recently bought The Parallel World by Michio Kaku on the kindle fire, and Physics of the Future in print by the same author. The reason I am watching astronomy and reading it is because I want to learn about things in space. The Science Channel is my favorite channel, but I only watch the educational shows, and not the other shows like Survivor Man for example."
