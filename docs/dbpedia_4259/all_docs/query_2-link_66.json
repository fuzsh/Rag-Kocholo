        "text": "Hollywood is mourning the loss today of British actor Bob Hoskins, who died Tuesday of pneumonia at age 71.\n\nHelen Mirren, who worked beside Hoskins in the British gangster film “The Long Good Friday,” called her co-star “a great actor and an even greater man.”\n\nAlso read: Bob Hoskins Was ‘X-Men’ Writer’s First Choice for Wolverine\n\n“Funny, loyal, instinctive, hard working, with that inimitable energy that seemed like a spectacular firework rocket just as it takes off,” the Oscar-winning British actress said in a statement. “When I worked with him on his iconic film, ‘The Long Good Friday,’ he was supportive and unegotistic. He was never sexist, when many around at that time were. I had the honour of watching the creation of one of the most memorable characters of British film.”\n\nAlso read: John Leguizamo Remembers Bob Hoskins’ Most-Hated Movie ‘Super Mario Bros’\n\n“X-Men” star Hugh Jackman, who took the role that was originally written for Hoskins, called the actor “a true great!”\n\nAlso read: Hollywood’s Notable Deaths of 2014 (Photos)\n\n“A true gent and a remarkable talent whom I had the privilege of working with,” actor Cary Elwes added."
