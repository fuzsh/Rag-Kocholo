        "text": "Actor Bob Hoskins has died at the age of 71 after suffering from pneumonia, his agent has confirmed.\n\nHoskins retired from acting in 2012 at the age of 69 after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.\n\nThe Oscar-nominated star of The Long Good Friday, Mona Lisa and Who Framed Roger Rabbit was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in the autumn of 2011.\n\nHis family released a statement saying he died last night in hospital.\n\nBob Hoskins (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nHis wife of 30 years, Linda, and children Alex, Sarah, Rosa and Jack said: \"We are devastated by the loss of our beloved Bob.\n\n\"Bob died peacefully at hospital last night surrounded by family, following a bout of pneumonia.\n\n\"We ask that you respect our privacy during this time and thank you for your messages of love and support.\"\n\nThe star, who was born Suffolk after his mother was evacuated from London, grew up in north London and left school aged 15 to work in a series of odd jobs including as a porter, lorry driver and window cleaner while dreaming of getting into acting.\n\nHe then did a three-year accountancy course but dropped out.\n\nHe claimed he got his big break by accident after being mistakenly called for a theatre audition when he accompanied his friend in 1968 and was mistaken for a candidate.\n\nBut he proved a natural and stage success lead him into television and small film parts.\n\nHis breakthrough role came in Dennis Potter's 1978 series Pennies From Heaven in which he played the lovelorn sheet music salesman Arthur Parker.\n\nHis portrayal of doomed London gangster Harold Shand in The Long Good Friday, which co-starred Helen Mirren, made him a film star and he followed it with stand-out roles in Mona Lisa and The Cotton Club.\n\nMore recently, he played a father figure to the women activists fighting for their rights at the Ford car plant in the British hit film Made In Dagenham, which also featured rising star Sally Hawkins.\n\nDame Judi Dench, who starred opposite Hoskins in Mrs Henderson Presents, told BBC News: \"I'm so very sorry to hear this news, and am thinking of his family at this sad time.\n\nHoskins’s father was a shy man, a bookkeeper; his mother, a nursery school cook, was more of an extrovert. Bob was their only child, born in 1942.\n\nBy the mid-1980s he was an established Hollywood star with appearances in blockbusters including Who Framed Roger Rabbit and opposite Cher in Mermaids.\n\nHe had a better time with a role he did not win - when a proposed move to replace Robert De Niro as Al Capone in The Untouchables fell through he was given a £20,000 pay-off by director Brian De Palma, prompting Hoskins to ask if he had any more films he did not want him to be in.\n\nHe continued to work steadily - appearing alongside Dame Judi Dench in wartime drama Mrs Henderson Presents, playing one of the seven dwarfs in Snow White And The Huntsman, starring Kristen Stewart, and appearing in British films including Made In Dagenham and Outside Bet.\n\nThe star - who had been married to his second wife, Linda, for more than 30 years - also moved into directing with The Raggedy Rawney and Rainbow.\n\nDespite his flourishing big-screen career, Hoskins took a role in Jimmy McGovern's BBC1 series The Street in 2009, winning an international Emmy.\n\nHe was also more than happy to appear in low-budget movies such as the Shane Meadows-directed A Room For Romeo Brass.\n\nAnd in 2009, keen to play down his fame, he told the Daily Telegraph: “Actors are just entertainers, even the serious ones. That’s all an actor is. He’s like a serious Bruce Forsyth.\"\n\nHe also said he had no film posters in his house, not even for Mona Lisa, which saw him nominated for an Oscar. He says he rarely watches the films he has starred in, and having made more than 80 cannot remember which ones he has been in.\n\nAfter the news was announced just after 1.30pm on Wednesday, tributes to the actor were posted on Twitter.\n\nActor Nick Frost shared the screen with Hoskins when they appeared together as Nion and Muir, two of the seven dwarves in Snow White And The Huntsman.\n\nFrost tweeted: \"Terribly sad news about Bob Hoskins. A pleasure to have shared the screen with you mate. An Actors actor and a gentleman to boot. RIP.\n\n\"If you want to see Bob in full flow watch The Long Good Friday. A tour de force. The long shot at the end of Bob in the taxi is amazing.\"\n\nTheatre director and choreographer Matthew Bourne added simply: \"RIP Bob Hoskins\".\n\nVicky McClure, the actress who has appeared in Broadchurch and Line of Duty, wrote: \"Just heard the very sad news Bob Hoskins has died. He was one of the best. I feel honoured to have met & worked with him. RIP Bob. XX\"\n\nIrish Game Of Thrones actor Liam Cunningham, who starred with Hoskins in Jimmy McGovern drama The Street, tweeted of how he enjoyed filming with the diminutive actor.\n\nHe tweeted: \"I filmed 'The Street' with Bob Hoskins in 2010. Had copious amounts of wine with the man. It was a joy to work with him. RIP\".\n\nSamuel L Jackson said: \"Truly saddened by the passing of Bob Hoskins! A truly Gigantic talent & a Gentleman. R.I.P.\"\n\nStephen Fry said: \"Oh no, Bob Hoskins. Gone? That’s awful news. The Long Good Friday one of the best British movies of the modern era. A marvellous man.\"\n\nOfficials at Bafta said they were \"deeply saddened\" to hear of the actor's death, while Simon Pegg wrote: \"Really sad news about Bob Hoskins. Great and varied career.\"\n\nCulture Minister Ed Vaizey also paid tribute to the popular actor. He said: \"For decades, Bob Hoskins has entertained television and film audiences of all age groups around the world. The British film industry has lost one of its true greats, and my thoughts and sympathies go out to his family and friends.\"\n\nTime Out Film also posted: \"Really tragic news about Bob Hoskins. A great man and a damn fine actor. Gor bless you, Mr 'Oskins.\"\n\nMartin Kemp said: \"RIP Bob Hoskins, 'Long Good Friday' one of the best movies ever made! You will be missed.\"\n\nShe said: \"Bob was a great actor and an even greater man. Funny, loyal, instinctive, hard-working, with that inimitable energy that seemed like a spectacular firework rocket just as it takes off.\n\n\"When I worked with him on his iconic film The Long Good Friday, he was supportive and unegotistic. He was never sexist, when many around at that time were. I had the honour of watching the creation of one of the most memorable characters of British film.\n\n\"I watched his brilliant Bosola in The Duchess Of Malfi, and then had the greatest of pleasures in playing again opposite him in the film Last Orders. Playing again with him was like playing a duet with a brother I had grown up with, which professionally I had.\n\n\"I personally will miss him very much, London will miss one of her best and most loving sons, and Britain will miss a man to be proud of.\""
