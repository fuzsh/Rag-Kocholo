        "text": "RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:\n\nLet's remember now actor Bob Hoskins, who died this week. He's probably best known for playing the private eye in \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit,\" opposite a very sexy cartoon, Jessica Rabbit.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT\")\n\nMONTAGNE: Bob Hoskins was a perfect big-screen gangster. He was short, but looked mean in a tall fedora.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nHoskins was a veteran of England's Royal National Theatre. He won over critics in the film \"Mona Lisa.\" He played George, an ex-con who falls for the working girl he chauffeurs around London.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"MONA LISA\")\n\nINSKEEP: The role won him an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe.\n\nMONTAGNE: The story is he got into acting by accident. He was watching a friend audition for a play when someone handed him a script. Hoskins landed the part. And although he was British, he played a lot of Americans. Oliver Stone cast him as a nasty J. Edgar Hoover in the movie \"Nixon.\"\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"NIXON\")\n\nMONTAGNE: Actor Bob Hoskins, in one of his many roles. He was 71 when he died on Tuesday.
