        "text": "The actor Bob Hoskins has died from pneumonia at the age of 71, his publicist confirmed on Wednesday.\n\nThe British actor was best known for his roles in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, The Long Good Friday and Mona Lisa, for which he was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar in 1987. Hoskins was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 2011 and it wasn’t long before he announced his retirement from acting in 2012. His last role was in Snow White and the Huntsman in 2012.\n\n“We are devastated by the loss of our beloved Bob,” his wife Linda and their children Alex, Sarah, Rosa and Jack said in a statement, after the actor passed away on Tuesday night. “Bob died peacefully at hospital last night surrounded by family, following a bout of pneumonia. We ask that you respect our privacy during this time and thank you for your messages of love and support.”"
