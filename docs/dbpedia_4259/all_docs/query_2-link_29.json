        "text": "British actor Bob Hoskins died last night following a battle with pneumonia. The 71-year-old's career spanned four decades, with some of his best-known films including Mona Lisa and, most recently, Snow White and the Huntsman.\n\nHoskins built his solid reputation in the theatre in the Sixties before winning favour from critics with his performance as East End gangster Harold Shand in 1980’s The Long Good Friday.\n\nThe Suffolk-born star lost out to Paul Newman at the Oscars in 1987, but received a Golden Globe nomination for his role in animated classic Who Framed Roger Rabbit? the next year.\n\nHoskins, who had suffered from Parkinson’s disease since late 2011, had retired from acting at the time of his death. He remains a respected member of the film industry, so let’s take a look back at five of his finest movie moments:\n\nThe Long Good Friday, 1980\n\nThis British film marked the beginning of Hoskins' cinematic career. He starred as a gangster opposite Helen Mirren and won widespread critical acclaim for his performance, including a Bafta nod. Watch him make his entrance as Harold Shand below.\n\nWho Framed Roger Rabbit?, 1988\n\nThis loveable animated film established Hoskins as a worldwide star. After playing Eddie Valiant, an alcoholic detective investigating a murder in a world where Forties cartoon stars are a submissive minority, he was soon in high demand. Remember this dramatic car chase scene? \"Jumpin' jeepers!\"\n\nMona Lisa, 1986\n\nHoskins picked up the Best Actor award at the Golden Globes and Baftas for his role as ex-con turned high-class prostitute's chauffeur, George. Paul Newman might have beaten him at the Oscars with The Colour of Money, but this mystery movie remains one of Hoskins' finest. Watch an excerpt from Neil Jordan's film below.\n\nHook, 1991\n\nHoskins' performance as Captain Hook's loyal sidekick Smee is remembered with great fondness by many movie fans. Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman also starred in this action-packed take on Peter Pan's villain. Watch Hoskins talk Hook out of suicide here.\n\nMrs Henderson Presents, 2005\n\nHoskins starred alongside Judi Dench and Kelly Reilly in this Stephen Frears comedy. He played doubting theatre manager Vivian van Damm and earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Pop Idol winner Will Young also appeared.\n\nFilm fans will also remember Hoskins as Sally Hawkins' supportive husband in 2011's gender equality hit, Made in Dagenham, or as magician Steve Laws in 1999's moving A Room for Romeo Brass."
