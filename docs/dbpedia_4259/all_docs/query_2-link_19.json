        "text": "British actor Bob Hoskins, best known for roles in The Long Good Friday and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, has died of pneumonia at the age of 71.\n\nStars and former co-workers have paid tribute to the Bafta-winning actor.\n\nWhen I worked with him on his iconic film The Long Good Friday, he was supportive and unegotistic. He was never sexist, when many around at that time were. I had the honour of watching the creation of one of the most memorable characters of British film.\n\nI watched his brilliant Bosola in The Duchess Of Malfi and then had the greatest of pleasures in playing again opposite him in the film Last Orders.\n\nPlaying again with him was like playing a duet with a brother I had grown up with, which professionally I had.\n\nI personally will miss him very much, London will miss one of her best and most loving sons, and Britain will miss a man to be proud of.\n\nBob Hoskins was a wonderful actor and an equally wonderful human being. He had the rare mixture of what it takes to be a great actor, a mixture of sophistication and innocence. He was able to make people laugh and cry. He was an adored man and a deeply respected and admired actor.\n\nIt is a great loss to the British acting profession, and I personally will mourn him with great affection. I wish his family and all his loved ones well.\n\nI was saddened to learn of the passing of Bob Hoskins. He was a beloved actor who brought a lot of enjoyment to film audiences worldwide.\n\nAs for his performance in Roger Rabbit, for all the special effects and technical wizardry, it was Bob's honesty and the truth of his performance that made the animated characters believable - and that was a testament to his real talent.\n\nThe generosity of both him and Michael Caine was fantastic - the reverence for what was happening. He was immersed in his character, but he was a very kind to me.\n\nI remember we did a take on the Brighton Pier, it's that scene where I've got the star-spangled glasses on and I say: \"Haven't you ever loved someone?\" And he says: \"All the time.\" And we were both crying.\n\nBut when we first started doing it, I wasn't crying. I remember he said to me: \"Now try that again, you could do that again, couldn't you?\" It wasn't the director, Neil Jordan, who said that. Bob did.\n\nI looked up to him. I wanted to do well for him - so I thought, \"OK yes, I trust him\" and I went to a different depth.\n\nFrom that day onwards, I didn't look back.\n\nShe then listed some of her father's words of wisdom - including \"don't worry about other people's opinions\" and \"appreciate beauty\".\n\n\"These are the lessons he taught me,\" she said.\n\n\"I will keep them close to my heart and remind myself of them whenever I stumble or falter.\n\n\"This isn't general wisdom, rather advice that he tailor made just for me.\n\n\"I love you Dad.\"\n\nBob Hoskins is the most generous actor I have worked with. He not only took a huge chance on me when he agreed to star in my first feature film, he taught me so much about the business, how to survive it and how to stay true to yourself.\n\nWhen we travelled to New York together back in the late 90s to promote Twenty Four Seven, the film company had put Bob in first class and me in with the chickens.\n\nBob refused to go unless they upgraded me to first or downgraded him to economy. They upgraded me, thank goodness, but knowing he would have forgone the champers and flambe steak to sit in twerp class with me says it all, really.\n\nHe was a true gentleman. RIP Bob.\n\nIt is with great sadness that we hear that our very dear friend, supporter and patron Bob Hoskins has died today.\n\nBob and his family have supported Chickenshed for many years. He empathised and understood our very being. He loved spending time with our members and nothing was ever too much trouble for him, be it helping us to pitch for funding, speaking to the press so eloquently on our behalf, or even singing on our Celebrity Album - he was up for anything!\n\nBob said that he \"stumbled\" into acting when he went to meet a friend auditioning at a local theatre and he landed the lead role. He also says that he \"stumbled\" on Chickenshed when he came to see The Tempest - and he thought it was great!\n\nWe are thrilled and honoured that he found Chickenshed. He has given us sound advice, love and kindness for many years.\n\nThere's only a handful of British A-lister actors that low-budget, new independent film-makers could approach - with their fingers crossed - in the hope they would say \"yes\" and Bob was one of them.\n\nWhat I particularly remember fondly is he called himself \"one-take Bob\" - but I only had two weeks to shoot my film, so he met his match in me!\n\nHe was absolutely fantastic. On every level, there was a warmth, a sensitivity, an intelligence. He was very creative and very funny, as well.\n\nOne lovely thing I remember about him is we couldn't quite afford a Winnebago, and his agent said we'd need to get him something nice to relax in. I felt she was absolutely right, so I went knocking on doors in Broadstairs and found someone who had a camper van.\n\nSo we got Carol, the camper van owner, to come to the shoot - and I think Bob went in there once because he just loved hanging out with the crew and hanging out with the children that were in the film. He was playing games with the kids all the time, and teaching them silly songs. And rude songs - even when their mums were there.\n\nHe will be lost and grieved by many, many people. He could make anybody feel at his ease. He was literally an everyman."
