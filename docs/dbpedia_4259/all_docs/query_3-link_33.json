        "text": "Actor Bob Hoskins, best known for roles in Who Framed Roger Rabbit and The Long Good Friday, has passed away aged 71 as a result of pneumonia.\n\nHoskins died on Tuesday in hospital, surrounded by family, according to his agent.\n\nThough he retired from acting in 2012 after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, his back-catalogue of work is gargantuan. He was arguably best known for films including Hook, The Long Good Friday and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, though was also nominated for a Best Actor Oscar in 1986 for Mona Lisa.\n\nGamers will probably best remember him from the 1993 movie adaptation of Super Mario Bros. in which he played the red-garbed plumber. Even though it drew incredibly negative reviews from critics, the wider public and even the man himself, it still remains a memorable movie, even if not for the right reasons.\n\nHis final movie was 2012's Snow White and the Huntsman, in which he starred opposite Chris Hemsworth and Kristen Stewart. Our best wishes go out to his family and friends.\n\nThis post might contain affiliation links. If you buy something through this post, the publisher may get a share of the sale."
