        "text": "30/04/2014 - Revered British star of The Long Good Friday and Mona Lisa succumbs to pneumonia\n\nIconic British actor Bob Hoskins passed away on Tuesday after a bout of pneumonia. He was 71. Hoskins had retired from acting in 2012, after being diagnosed with Parkinson’s. Hoskins’ wife Linda and children Alex, Sarah, Rosa and Jack said in a statement: “We are devastated by the loss of our beloved Bob. Bob died peacefully at hospital last night surrounded by family, following a bout of pneumonia. We ask that you respect our privacy during this time and thank you for your messages of love and support.”\n\nRobert William \"Bob\" Hoskins, Jr. began his acting career on the stage and thereupon played minor parts in television until he got his first break in the medium with On the Move (1976) and Pennies from Heaven (1978). He acted in several films in the 70s, but it was John Mackenzie’s The Long Good Friday (1980) that made the world sit up and take notice of his remarkable talent. He won the Evening Standard British Film Award for best actor for the film\n\nFor his role in Neil Jordan’s Mona Lisa, Hoskins was nominated for best actor at the Oscars and the Golden Globes and won the BAFTA and best actor at Cannes for it. Other honours in Hoskins’ glittering career include the Richard Harris Award at the British Independent Film Awards in 2004, an European Film Award for best actor for Twenty Four Seven in 1997, a best actor Genie in 2000 for Felicia’s Journey, an International Emmy for The Street and many more accolades from around the world.\n\nOne of Hoskins’ most beloved roles is in Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1989) and for his role in that film and for his performance in The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne, he took home another Evening Standard gong."
