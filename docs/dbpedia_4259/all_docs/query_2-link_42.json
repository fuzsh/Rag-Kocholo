        "text": "It’s being reported that British actor Bob Hoskins, best known for starring roles in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Mona Lisa, Hook, Brazil and dozens of other classic films, has passed away at the age of 71 after suffering from pneumonia and complications from Parkinson’s Disease.\n\nHoskins was born in West Suffolk on October 26, 1942 and like many British actors began his career on stage and television during the ’70s before finally making his mark with performances in ’80s British films The Long Good Friday and Mona Lisa as well as a memorable role in Terry Gilliam’s Brazil. Hoskins’ distinctive Cockney accent set him apart from many of his peers and Americans came to know and love him after his starring role in Robert Zemeckis’ Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988, which led to other roles in Hollywood films like Super Mario Bros. (playing Mario) and the Steven Spielberg-directed Hook in which he played the pirate Smee. Hoskins would reprise that role in 2011’s “Neverland.”\n\nAlthough his film appearances in recent years had been scarce–his role as a crime boss in Jet Li’s Unleashed is one of our recent faves–Hoskins’ last film appearance was playing a dwarf in 2012’s Snow White and the Huntsman and later that year, he announced his retirement from acting after being diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease.\n\nHoskins is survived by four children from his two marriages including his most recent wife of 32 years, Linda Banwell.\n\n(Photo Credit: WENN.com)"
