He was 71.\n\nAlso read: Bob Hoskins Retires From Acting After Parkinson’s Diagnosis\n\nThe versatile actor was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance in 1986 drama “Mona Lisa.”\n\nHoskins’ portrayal of an ex-con netted him the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Drama.\n\nAlso read: Hollywood’s Notable Deaths of 2014 (Photos)\n\nHis biggest hit came two years later in the blockbuster 1988 comedy “Who Framed Roger Rabbit,” where Hoskins played the hard-nosed private investigator Eddie Valiant.\n\nHe continued to make successful star turns in other family comedies including Mr. Smee in “Hook,” and as the eponymous video game character in “Super Mario Brothers.”\n\nHoskins retired from acting in 2012 after he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.\n\nAlso read: Robert Zemeckis Rethinks ‘Roger Rabbit’: ‘No Sane Person Would Do This” (Party Photos)\n\n“We are devastated by the loss of our beloved Bob.

When I worked with him on his iconic film, the ‘Long Good Friday,’ he was supportive and unegotistic. He was never sexist, when many around at that time, were. I had the honor of watching the creation of one of the most memorable characters of British film.”\n\nTony Maglio contributed to this report"
