        "text": "In an industry littered with deeply individual artists, Bob Hoskins still stood out.\n\nPerhaps it was his background. Brought up in Finsbury Park, Hoskins' did not come from an acting dynasty and left school with just one O-level.\n\nYet he was a natural actor. Gaining his first audition by change, Bob Hoskins quickly grew in stature, first becoming a regular on British television.\n\nTaking on Hollywood roles, the actor spent the 80s appearing in roles as diverse as 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' and Terry Gilliam's hypnotic 'Brasil'.\n\nPerhaps best known for playing cockney hard men, Bob Hoskins is well remembered for his starring turn in 'The Long Good Friday'. Perhaps the pinnacle of the British gangster movie genre, his performance – in turns disgusting and absorbing, horrifying and hilarious – earned widespread plaudits.\n\nRemaining a hugely prolific actor, Bob Hoskins retired in 2012 after confirming he was suffering from Parkinson's Disease. Recently contracting pneumonia, the actor's family issued a statement a few moments ago confirming that Bob Hopkins had passed away on Tuesday (April 29th) in hospital. He was 71.\n\nThe statement reads: \"We are devastated by the loss of our beloved Bob. Bob died peacefully at hospital last night surrounded by family, following a bout of pneumonia. We ask that you respect our privacy during this time and thank you for your messages of love and support.\"\n\n(via BBC)\n\nBuy Clash Magazine"
