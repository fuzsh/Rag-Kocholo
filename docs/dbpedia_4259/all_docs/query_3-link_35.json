        "text": "The BBC is reporting that English actor Bob Hoskins has passed away at the age of 71. Though often referred to as a character actor, Hoskins burst onto the scene in the early 80s with leading roles in gritty, crime neo-noirs like The Long Good Friday and Mona Lisa. His later performance in 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit brilliantly turned Hoskins’ typical role of a modern-day gumshoe on its head. Speaking to Vanity Fair in 2010 Hoskins recalled his work on Who Framed Roger Rabbit saying, “I had to learn to hallucinate.” Hoskins’ gruff but daffy turn opposite a host of cartoons earned him a whole new following and kickstarted a new phase in his career resulting in kid-friendly roles like Smee in Hook and Mario himself in Super Mario Bros.\n\nBut Hoskins never lost his taste for more dramatic roles, netting an International Emmy in 2009 for his performance in the British drama serial The Street. Hoskins had retired from acting in 2012 after being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. His agent is saying Hoskins passed away from pneumonia. After a too-short career filled with awards and accolades, Hoskins will be remembered by generations of moviegoers as our favorite gumshoe. When asked if he had any words of wisdom for the next generation of actors, Hoskins’ reply harkened back to his Roger Rabbit days. “My advice,” he said, “would be to learn to hallucinate.”\n\nAward Season\n\nBaby Reindeer’s Jessica Gunning Never Saw Martha as a Villain\n\n“She’s so much more than that,” says the newly minted Emmy nominee of her breakout role in the Netflix hit series.\n\nMovies\n\nWhy Was Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway’s New Movie Buried?\n\nMothers’ Instinct is a perfectly solid domestic thriller with two Oscar-winning movie stars that barely got a North American release.\n\nMovies\n\nWhen You’re 23 and Spielberg Calls: The Wild Origin Story of Jon M.
