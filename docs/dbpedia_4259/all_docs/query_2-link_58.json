        "text": "Actor Bob Hoskins has died, aged 71.\n\nThe actor’s death was caused by pneumonia with the news confirmed by his family earlier today. BBC News reports that Hoskins’ agent says his client died on Tuesday (April 29), surrounded by loved ones.\n\nHoskins is best known for his roles in The Long Good Friday and Who Framed Roger Rabbit and was nominated for an Academy Award in 1987 for his role in Mona Lisa. Hoskins retired from acting in 2012 after being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.\n\n“We are devastated by the loss of our beloved Bob,” the actor’s wife Linda and children Alex, Sarah, Rosa and Jack said in a statement. “Bob died peacefully at hospital last night surrounded by family, following a bout of pneumonia. We ask that you respect our privacy during this time and thank you for your messages of love and support.”\n\nAdvertisement"
