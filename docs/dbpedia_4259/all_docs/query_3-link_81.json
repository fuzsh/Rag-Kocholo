        "text": "Culture Minister Ed Vaizey paid tribute, saying: \"For decades, Bob Hoskins has entertained television and film audiences of all age groups around the world. The British film industry has lost one of its true greats, and my thoughts and sympathies go out to his family and friends.\"\n\nIn this country we can sometimes mistake colloquialism for inarticulacy, and banish everyman characters to the peripheries. In the Seventies writers such as Dennis Potter (Pennies From Heaven) and Barrie Keeffe (The Long Good Friday) placed everyman characters at the centre of their dramas and conveyed their thoughts and feelings eloquently and authentically. Bob Hoskins was their actor.\n\nHe spoke like one of us and at the same time conveyed the underlying vulnerability and confusion we couldn’t admit to. He showed us what we wanted to be, but also what we truly were. He was a master of his craft and definitely the father of my career.\n\nEddie Marsan\n\nBob Hoskins was gentle, thoughtful, unselfish, always personally helpful. He gave Tom Hunsinger and myself a subtle and witty performance in Sparkle — and when he had to lose his cool on screen, it was wonderful to watch him wind himself up, to corral the energy. A consummate professional, who took the work seriously, but was never solemn.\n\nNeil Hunter, co-writer/co-director, Sparkle"
