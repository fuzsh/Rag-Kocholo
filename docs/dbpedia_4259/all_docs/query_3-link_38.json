        "text": "London, Apr 30 (EFE). — British actor Bob Hoskins, known for his performances in films such as “The Long Good Friday” and “Who Framed Roger Rabbit,” has died of pneumonia, his family said Wednesday. He was 71.\n\nHoskins, who received an Oscar nomination in 1987 for the crime drama “Mona Lisa,” retired from acting in 2012 after he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.\n\n“Bob died peacefully at hospital last night surrounded by family, following a bout of pneumonia,” his wife, Linda, and children Alex, Sarah, Rosa and Jack said in a statement.\n\nFellow actors offered praise for Hoskins and expressed sadness over his death.\n\n“That’s awful news,” Stephen Fry said on Twitter. “The Long Good Friday (is) one of the best British movies of the modern era. A marvelous man.”\n\nHoskins was born Oct. 26, 1942, in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, where his mother was living after being evacuated from London during the Blitz.\n\nHe grew up in London and left school at 15. Hoskins got his start in show business as a stage actor and starred in 1978 in the popular British television series “Pennies from Heaven.”\n\nHis first major bigscreen role was as a London crime boss in “The Long Good Friday,” a 1980 film that also featured Helen Mirren.\n\nHoskins garnered a Bafta Britain’s equivalent of the Oscar for “Mona Lisa” and was honored by Spain’s San Sebastian International Film Festival in 2002 with the Donostia Prize for lifetime achievement."
