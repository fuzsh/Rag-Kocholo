We’ll certainly remember him here for such fantasy and SF movies as Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Terry Gilliam’s Brazil, Super Mario Bros., Doomsday, Steven Spielberg’s Hook, and his very last film role was as a dwarf in Snow White and the Huntsman.\n\nHis old friend Sir Michael Caine, commented on the death . . . “He was one of the nicest and best actors I have ever worked with.”\n\nSee you on the other side, Bob. Hopefully with Jessica Rabbit on your arm."
