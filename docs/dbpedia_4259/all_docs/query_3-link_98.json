        "text": "Oscar-nominated, and BAFTA- and Golden Globe-winning English actor Bob Hoskins has died. The star of such films as The Long Good Friday, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Mona Lisa passed away Tuesday night following a bout of pneumonia. He was 71. Hoskins was last seen in 2012’s Snow White And The Huntsman and that same year announced his retirement from acting after being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. The versatile Hoskins hailed from West Suffolk but was brought up in London. He began acting on the stage in the late 1960s, and throughout the 1970s, he appeared in several UK television series including the 1978 BBC mini Pennies From Heaven. Early in his feature career, he had roles in such films as Zulu Dawn, Pink Floyd The Wall, The Cotton Club and Brazil. But it was 1980 crime drama The Long Good Friday that gave him his breakout starring part. The now-classic gangster movie, which co-starred Helen Mirren, earned Hoskins his first BAFTA Film Award nomination for Lead Actor. In 1986, he starred in Neil Jordan’s noir mystery Mona Lisa opposite Michael Caine, Cathy Tyson and Robbie Coltrane. Hoskins was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for the movie, and won the BAFTA and Golden Globe for his role. It was 1988’s Who Framed Roger Rabbit that brought him great international fame as Eddie Valiant, the live-action detective investigating a Toontown murder. The part in the groundbreaking Robert Zemeckis film earned Hoskins his second Golden Globe nom. The prolific actor’s other movies include Richard Benjamin’s Mermaids, Steven Spielberg’s Hook, Oliver Stone’s Nixon, Nora Ephron’s Michael, Kevin Spacey’s Beyond The Sea, Stephen Frears’ Mrs Henderson Presents and Zemeckis’ A Christmas Carol. Hoskins’ wife Linda and children Alex, Sarah, Rosa and Jack said in a statement today: “We are devastated by the loss of our beloved Bob. … We ask that you respect our privacy during this time and thank you for your messages of love and support.”"
