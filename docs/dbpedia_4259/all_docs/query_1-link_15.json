        "text": "Legendary English character actor Bob Hoskins has died at age 71, nearly two years after Parkinson’s Disease forced him to retire from acting. According to Hoskins’ publicist, Clair Dobbs, he died from pneumonia, and is survived by his wife and four children.\n\nKnown for playing gangsters, lowlives and working-class men, this very fine actor was perhaps best known for “The Long Good Friday” (1980), “Mona Lisa” (1986) and “Who Framed Roger Rabbit” (1988). “Mona Lisa” nabbed him a BAFTA and a Golden Globe, as well as an Oscar-nomination. He got his start in theater in the late 1960s, and his final performance was in 2012’s “Snow White and the Huntsman.” (Read Variety’s touching obit here.)\n\nThough effaced by Hoskins himself, his almost-forgotten performance in the infamous 1993 “Super Mario Bros.” movie is due for reconsideration, writes Joe Leydon on his Moving Picture Blog:\n\nEven some of the most respectful obits for the late, great Bob Hoskins — who passed away Tuesday at age 71 — contain snarky remarks about “Super Mario Bros,” which Hoskins himself once described as “the worst thing I ever did.”\n\nWith the pugnacious Bob Hoskins as Mario, a blunt-spoken pragmatist, and the soulful John Leguizamo as Luigi, a dreamy-eyed innocent, the filmmakers have actors who are strong enough to be persuasive as straight-faced heroes, and engaging enough to keep from being upstaged by the neon-lit scenery.\n\nWatch some of Hoskins’ best movie moments below."
