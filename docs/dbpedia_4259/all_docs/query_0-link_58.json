        "text": "Private eyes, gangsters, working class toughs - English actor Bob Hoskins excelled at them all during an international stage and screen career that concurrently showcased the everyman's ability to pass as American, Italian or even Russian. His breakout leading role in the gritty British thriller \"The Long Good Friday\" (1980) established Hoskins' streetwise charm, and from there, the following he had acquired on British television and the stages of London's West End spread internationally. A New York mobster in Francis Ford Coppola's \"Cotton Club\" (1984), Hoskins lent an emotional depth to the ex-con he portrayed in Neil Jordan's \"Mona Lisa\" (1986), earning a Golden Globe Award for his performance and returning to the ceremony two years later as a nominee for one of the era's most inventive comedies, \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\" (1988). For a man who self-deprecatingly referred to himself as \"5 foot six and cubic,\" Hoskins was perpetually booked, disappearing chameleon-like into portrayals of world leaders and charismatic self-starters like the role that earned him an Academy Award nomination opposite Judi Dench in \"Mrs. Henderson Presents\" (2005). Hoskins' gregarious charm and ability to bring humanness to heavies made him a much-loved player in both Hollywood and his native U.K. His death from pneumonia on April 29, 2014, two years after he retired from acting due to Parkinson's Disease, brought tributes from fellow actors and directors across the entire film industry."
