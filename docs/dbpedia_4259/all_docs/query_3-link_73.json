Bob was a genuine and down to earth, generally nice man and of course a very talented actor.\n\n“He will always be very much a part of British TV and film history.”\n\nBob was quoted in the most recent edition of Elstree & Borehamwood Town Crier as saying: “Without Elstree, British cinema would have lost half it’s history.”\n\nA spokesperson from Elstree Studios has said: \"We are saddened to hear of Bob Hoskins passing. Bob spent 7 months here in 1986 filming Who Framed Roger Rabbit and has frequented the Studios many times in the years since. It is a sad day for our film industry.\n\n\"Our thoughts go out to his family and friends at this sad time.\""
