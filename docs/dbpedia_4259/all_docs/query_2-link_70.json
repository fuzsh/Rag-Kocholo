        "text": "London: British actor Bob Hoskins, whose roles ranged from London gangsters to FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover and who starred opposite a cast of cartoon characters in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, has died after a bout of pneumonia, his publicist said on Wednesday.\n\nHe was 71.\n\nA statement issued on behalf of his wife Linda and his children said: “We are devastated by the loss of our beloved Bob. Bob died peacefully at hospital last night surrounded by family, following a bout of pneumonia.”\n\nHoskins announced his retirement from acting in 2012, saying at the time that he was suffering from Parkinson’s disease, an incurable muscular disorder.\n\nHoskins started his career in the 1970s on British television shows such as Thick as Thieves and Rock Follies of ‘77. Moving into big film roles, his turn as a mobster in 1980s The Long Good Friday shot him to stardom and defined his tough guy persona.\n\nHe was nominated for a best actor Oscar in 1987 for Mona Lisa, in which he starred opposite Sir Michael Caine and Robbie Coltrane, and won a Golden Globe award.\n\nThe Suffolk-born actor became a staple face in the British film industry, often playing Cockney-speaking characters in both comedy and drama genres with his trademark gravelly voice.\n\nHis big Hollywood break came in 1988 when he played Eddie Valiant in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, a role for which he received a Golden Globe nomination. He then went on to play roles in 1990’s Mermaids and 1991’s “Hook.”\n\nHe portrayed Hoover in the 1995 movie Nixon.\n\nIn his later years he took on parts in smaller films, including a role in Made in Dagenham about women seeking equal pay with male workers at a car plant near London.\n\nHe also played the voice of the character Winston in the 2006 film Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties."
