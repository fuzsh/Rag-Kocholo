Bob Hoskins has passed away at the age of 71.

The much-loved actor died of pneumonia in hospital yesterday (April 29), his agent confirmed to the BBC. He was with his family at the time.

Hoskins, famed for his roles in Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Mermaids and Mona Lisa, announced his retirement in 2012 after he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.

“We are devastated by the loss of our beloved Bob,” his family said in a statement.

“Bob died peacefully at hospital last night surrounded by family, following a bout of pneumonia. We ask that you respect our privacy during this time and thank you for your messages of love and support.”

Hoskins is survived by his second wife, Linda, whom he married in 1982, and by his four children.

The Suffolk-born actor began his career on the stage in the 1960s before focusing on screen work in later decades. He won a Golden Globe and received an Oscar nomination for his performance in 1986’s Mona Lisa, and went on to appear in films including Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Hook, Super Mario Bros. and Mermaids, in which he starred opposite Cher.

In recent years, he appeared in acclaimed British film Made In Dagenham and BBC drama series The Street, for which he won an Emmy in 2010.

His final role came in the 2012 movie Snow White and the Huntsman.
