LONDON (AP) - April 30, 2014

A family statement released Wednesday by agent Clair Dobbs said Hoskins died in a hospital after a bout of pneumonia.

His wife Linda and children Alex, Sarah, Rosa and Jack, said: "We are devastated by the loss of our beloved Bob."

A versatile character actor capable of menace, poignancy and Cockney charm, Hoskins appeared in some of the most acclaimed British films of the past few decades, including gangster classic "The Long Good Friday."

In 2012 Hoskins announced that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and was retiring from acting.
