The Vyborg Side (Vyborgskaya storona, also released in English as New Horizons) is a Soviet 1939 (filmed 1938) historical drama directed by Grigoriy Kozintsev and Leonid Trauberg. This is the third part of Maxim Trilogy, predated by The Youth of Maxim (1935) and The Return of Maxim (1937). The third part depicts Maxim Ivanovich Lisitsin (Boris Chirkov) after the October revolution 1917. Maksim stands in charge of the State Bank of Russia, uncovers an anti-Bolsheviks conspiracy and at last joins the Red Army. The film was named after the Vyborg Side, an industrial area in Petrograd where many Red Guard units were formed.

Note: the first part of the trilogy, The Youth of Maxim (Yunost Maksima) (1935), lacks any firearms and so isn't listed on IMFDB.

The following weapons were used in the film The Vyborg Side (Vyborgskaya storona):

Revolvers

Nagant M1895

Nagant M1895 revolvers are widely used by Bolsheviks and Red Guards, notably Maksim Ivanovich Lisitsin (Boris Chirkov) and Natalya Artemyeva (Valentina Kibardina), and counter-revolutionaries, notably Anarchist Platon Vasilyevich Dymba (Mikhail Zharov) and one of the leaders of Socialists-Revolutionaries (SRs) Ropshin (Dmitri Dudnikov). Most, if not all Nagants appear to be of anachronistic post-1930 version.

Short-barreled Nagant M1895

Red Guard Yegor Bugai (Yuriy Tolubeev) uses a short-barreled Nagant M1895. Sources about shortened Nagants vary: were they produced in Russian Empire or this version appeared only in 1920s (this is more credible).

Pistols

M1911

One of the officers-conspirators is seen with an M1911 pistols. A large number of M1911s in .45 Colt and .455 Webley calibers was purchased by Russian Empire during the Great War, so this pistol wasn't uncommon in Russia in 1917.

Unidentified pistol

Another officer-conspirator holds a pistol that is seen only partially. It is possibly a Luger P08 but it's only a guess.

Rifles

Mosin Nagant M1891

Red Guards are armed with Mosin Nagant M1891 rifles, mostly of Infantry version.

Note: see additional images on talk page.

Mosin Nagant M1907 Carbine

Sailor Zheleznyakov (Boris Blinov) carries a Mosin Nagant M1907 Carbine in the well known historical scene of the disperse of All Russian Constituent Assembly.

Machine Guns

Maxim

A Maxim machine gun, supposedly M1910, is briefly seen in the Council of the Vyborg Side.
