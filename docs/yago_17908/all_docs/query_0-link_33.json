The film, along with the second part of Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible was harshly criticized by Andrei Zhdanov and banned. A version of the film, released in 1956 during Khrushchev Thaw, was disowned by Kozintsev because the reediting was done without his participation.\n\nSimple PeopleDirected byGrigori Kozintsev\n\nLeonid TraubergWritten byGrigori Kozintsev\n\nLeonid TraubergStarringYuri TolubeyevCinematographyAndrei Moskvin\n\nAnatoli NazarovEdited byV.
