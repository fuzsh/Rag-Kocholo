        "text": "Another strikingly original film from the FEKS duo of Kozintsev and Trauberg, New Babylon – named after the department store where its central character works – is a love story set amongst the events of the Paris Commune of 1871. Jay Leyda called it a ‘consistently magnificent climax to the silent films of Kozintsev and Trauberg’.\n\nPlease note, this print has no soundtrack."
