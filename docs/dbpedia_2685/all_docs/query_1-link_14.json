        "text": "We present the first comprehensive systematic-faunistic account on a Messinian gastropod assemblage from the Moncucco Torinese site in the Tertiary Piedmont Basin in Italy. In total, the samples yielded 53 gastropod species comprising 40 terrestrial and 13 aquatic species. The assemblage reflects a predominantly dry, rather open and stony landscape mixed with restricted wooded areas with some deadwood and leaf litter. Freshwater settings were present as well but may have been largely restricted to ephemeral puddles and ponds. The assemblage is outstanding in evolutionary aspects as it represents an example of the earliest post-evaporitic gastropod fauna, which has passed the Messinian Salinity Crisis. Indeed, the composition of the terrestrial Moncucco Torinese fauna suggests a biochronologic transition from Late Miocene to Pliocene faunas, supporting the dating based on mammals as late Turolian (MN 13). About 15% of the species have been known so far only from the European Miocene, 40% were described from the Pliocene and were unknown from older strata and about 42% are only known from the Late Messinian of Moncucco Torinese. This suggests that the Pliocene continental gastropod fauna is partly rooted in Messinian faunas, pointing to a rather low turnover at the Miocene/Pliocene boundary. In terms of biogeography, no evolutionary relation to coeval Pannonian-Pontian faunas of Lake Pannon or the Dacian Basin are documented for the Lago-Mare gastropods. Hydrocena moncuccoensis Harzhauser, Neubauer & Esu n. sp., Saccoia globosa Harzhauser, Neubauer & Esu n. sp., Acicula giuntellii Harzhauser, Neubauer & Esu n. sp., Platyla manganellii Harzhauser, Neubauer & Esu n. sp., Cochlicopa fassabortoloi Harzhauser, Neubauer & Esu n. sp., Lucilla miocaenica Harzhauser, Neubauer & Esu n. sp., and ?Helicopsis piedmontanica Harzhauser, Neubauer & Esu n. sp. are described as new species. Possible further new taxa are described in open nomenclature, because the poor preservation of the material does not allow formal species to be established.\n\nThe taxonomy of the uncoiling \"worm-snails\" belonging to the marine gastropod families Vermetidae, Siliquariidae and Turritellidae is notoriously confused and their nominal species frequently mixed (in the literature as well as in type specimen collections) with members of superficially similar tube-building polychaete worms or members of unrelated molluscan groups. A long history of introducing and using infrasubspecific names and the rampant employment of homonymous names for unrelated taxa had contributed to a system that became unworkable. The current catalogue researches nearly 1,500 names that have been cited in conjunction with Recent and fossil taxa worm-snail taxonomy (six names above family-group level, 18 family-group names, 195 genus-group names, 1,278 species-group names). Each nameâ€™s validity and availability (in the sense of the I.C.Z.N. Code) was investigated and current placement within or outside the mentioned worm-snail families is suggested. 560 species-group names are interpreted as available for members of the worm-snail groups here under discussion. Of these, approximately 280 species-group names are available for extant taxa. Various formal First-Reviser actions are taken to resolve priority issues. The type species for Tulaxoda Blainville, 1828 is herein designated to be Serpulorbis polyphragma Sasso, 1827, making Tulaxoda an objective junior synonym of Thylacodes Guettard, 1770. Magilus Montfort, 1810 is declared a nomen protectum over Campulotus Guettard, 1770, a nomen oblitum. Recurring nomenclatural issues and those too complex to treat within the regular catalogue entries are discussed in 22 taxa notes. The catalogue is fully referenced in 766 literature titles and eight associated literature notes.\n\nThis is the second part of a series on the German zoologist Johannes Thiele (1860-1935) and comprises a critical listing of the genus-group taxa which he described as new to malacology. Each of these names is accompanied by author and bibliographic references, original status, type-species with its original binominal spelling and bibliographic source and some data on subsequent taxonomic placements. Thiele introduced a total of 291 such names in the Phylum Mollusca, distributed as follows: 11 Aplacophora; 39 Polyplacophora; 200 Gastropoda (138 Prosobranchia; 20 Opisthobranchia and 42 Pulmonata); 31 Bivalvia; 10 Cephalopoda; there were no new scaphopod or monoplacophoran names. Of these, later authors recognized as valid 85 at the generic level, 110 at the subgeneric level; 71 are considered to be synonyms, and the remaining 25 are unjustified emendations or errors."
