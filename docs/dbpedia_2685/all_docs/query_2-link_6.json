Minutes of the October meeting were accepted as published in The Festivus. Treasurer Silvana Vollero reported continued financial soundness, and reminded members of their 2007 club dues. Vice President John LaGrange’s plans for next month include a talk on pink abalone. Librarian Marilyn Goldammer noted that books and reprints were again being offered for sale on the back tables. Botanical Society Representative Wes Farmer called attention to the new' chairs in our meeting room. Christmas Party Chairman Jules Hertz reminded members of the upcoming Christmas Party on December 2nd . Red wine will be provided by John Jackson, and there will be a program presented by Richard Herrmann. Wrapped shell gifts will be exchanged. New officers for 2007 were elected by acclamation: President, John LaGrange; Vice President, Carole Hertz; Treasurer, Silvana Vollero; Corresponding Secretary, Marilyn Goldammer; and Recording Secretary, Nancy Schneider. The slate will be installed at the Christmas Party. Vice President LaGrange introduced the evening's program, presented by members who shared their shells and the stories surrounding them. Some showed their very first finds— the shells that stimulated their interest in this subject we all find so fascinating. Bruce Kemp related his tale of diving for huge Cassis, and he brought the largest one to show. An enormous pendant, set with endemic Cypraea, was given to John LaGrange by the governor of Easter Island; the accompanying story was as good as the pendant. Everyone was overawed at the huge, shiny Cypraea that Ron Deems showed off— until he told us that it was a wood carving. Jules' Antarctica micro Epitonium was later traded for an expensive and rare species from Galapagos. John Bishop's shell finds from the upper Gulf of California turned out to be a Caribbean species; he is still trying to figure out how they got there. Larry Catarius and friend dove for twenty-nine years off Santa Barbara, resulting in a great variety of Pecten diegensis. Bill Schneider brought a photo of his antipatharian coral embedded with the rare Rhizochilus, which was caught by hook and line and refuses detachment. Finding fossil ammonites from 65 mya is what piqued the Schneider's interest in shells and led to their joining the shell club. Wes Farmer demonstrated how to construct a Dorid nudibranch utilizing plastic clay. This brought back his memory of finding his first nudibranch in San Diego Bay when he was a boy in Junior High School. He also showed some of his beautiful finished models. The shell drawing was won by Marilyn Goldammer. The meeting was adjourned at 8:50 p.m. Coffee table snacks were provided by Carole Hertz and Silvana Vollero, while great photos from last April's Shell Auction were being shown as a PowerPoint presentation by Wes Farmer. Nancy Schneider The Club’s Annual Christmas Dinner Party Saturday evening, December 2nd On Saturday evening December 2nd the Club hosted its annual Christmas Dinner Party at the Butcher Shop on Kearny Villa Rd in San Diego. It was a fun time. Tables were decorated with poinsettia in Strombus shells provided by the Pisors. And the wine on the tables was donated by John Jackson - both gifts much appreciated. MC Carole Hertz got the evening going promptly at 7:00 p.m. with a few stories before the dinner. Everyone enjoyed the meal and their companions at the tables. Before dessert Carole told that this was the 45* anniversary year of the Club and the 37th year of continuous publication of The Festivus. Then after a few more “stories” President Bill Schneider thanked his board and the new board for 2007 was installed (See Minutes). It was then dessert time - which seems to be the highlight of every Club meal. Following dessert, Richard Herrmann gave another of his terrific programs - his first to the Club done digitally. His wonderful photos of blue whales, balls of krill, sharks etc. accompanied by his lively narrative was greatly appreciated. The evening ended with the traditional gift exchange and the lingering of attendees who were having too enjoyable a time to want to leave. Dues are Overdue It is time to pay your dues if you haven’t already done so. If your dues are not received this month, this will be your last issue. Vol. XXXIX(l): 2007 THE FESTIVUS Page 3 NEW EL SALVADOR DISTRIBUTIONAL RECORD LOR SOLENOSTEIRA ANOMALA (REEVE, 1847) (MOLLUSCA: BUCCINIDAE) JULES HERTZ1 & KIRSTIE L. KAISER 2 Associates, Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History 2559 Puesta del Sol Road Santa Barbara, California 93105, USA A Solenosteira specimen was taken by Kirstie L. Kaiser using SCUBA in March 2001 while on the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute El Salvador Expedition aboard the R/V Urraca. The crabbed, 47.8 mm shell (Figure 1) was found at a depth of five meters among boulders covered with fine sand and gorgonians at Isla Meanguera in the Golfo de Fonseca. The unusual specimen is more rounded and has more broadly rounded axial ribs than any of the Solenosteira spp. figured by Keen (1971). We believe Figure 1 (herein) to be a specimen of Solenosteira anomala (Reeve, 1847). Hernandez (1992) in his preliminary survey of marine mollusks of El Salvador reported neither S. anomala nor the closely related S. pallida (Broderip & Sowerby, 1829). Therefore this is the first report of S. anomala in El Salvador. Pyrula anomala Reeve, 1847, was originally described as follows: “Shell solid, somewhat fusiform, whorls transversely grooved and striated, swollen in the middle, longitudinally plicated and noduled; columella umbilicated; lip serrated; yellowish-white.” Reeve figured two syntypes ( Pyrula , pi. 3, Species 9, 12). The first of which (Species 9) as Figure 2 herein, is more elongate and (Species 12) the second syntype (Figure 3 herein), which he considered to be “the more characteristic illustration of the species.” looks nearly Figure 1 .

Sadeghian. identical to the Kaiser specimen shown in Figure 1. It is a rounder, sturdier looking specimen than that figured in Keen (1971). Keen (1971, fig. 1117) is a syntype of Solenosteira anomala (taken from Reeve’s Species 9) which is in the British Museum. According to Keen (1971) the second syntype (Species 12) “seems to have been lost.” She described S. anomala as “relatively slender, with strong spiral cords and a pinched-in i Mailing address: 3883 M t.

Reeve’s Species 12 is what we consider to be the usual form of Solenosteira anomala. The genus Solenosteira (Dali, 1890), has as its type species by original designation, S. anomala Reeve. The distribution for S. anomala is listed in Keen (1971) as “Baja California southward, possibly to Ecuador, intertidally and offshore to depths of 73 m.” Pilsbry & Olsson (1941) list S. anomala as occurring on the coast of Ecuador and northern Peru. Olsson & Harbison (1953) list the distribution of S. anomala as Pacific coast of northwestern South America. Searches of the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History Collection revealed some lots of Solenosteira anomala (SBMNH 37681, 8573, 24634, 9871, 369348, 28342 and some unnumbered lots). They were from Mexico, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Peru. One specimen collected by shrimpers out of Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, Mexico (SBMNH 369348) is shown here as Figure 4. Three lots were also found at the San Diego Natural History Museum which were originally identified as S. pallidus (Broderip & Sowerby, 1829) (SDNHM 41293, 19052, 51811) and one of those lots from Bahia Tenacatita, Mexico, is shown here as Figure 5. Carol Skoglund of Phoenix, Arizona, has three lots in her collection which have the very distinctive rounded appearance and heavy axial ribs of the El Salvador specimen. These specimens, between 24 to 67 mm in height (Figures 6-8), came from off the tip of Baja California Sur, Bahia Santiago, Colima, Mexico, and Playas de Villamil, Guayas, Ecuador. The largest specimens are very heavy and most have a tightly adhering dark brown periostracum. Abbott (1974) has S. anomala (Reeve, 1847), as a form of Cantharus pallidus , a quite variable, common species from intertidal regions to 20 fathoms. Keen’s lectotype figure of Solenosteira pallida (1971, fig. 1 123) is a much more slender shell with a higher spire and more angular periphery than seen in S. anomala. The specimen figured is from the type lot in the Gray collection in the British Museum. There are two species in the fossil record that look somewhat like S. anomala (Reeve, 1847). Hanetia boggsi (Pilsbry & Olsson, 1941 pp. 28, 29, pi. 5, figs. 3,4) is very similar but is distinguished by more numerous axial ribs, there being 15 to 17 on the last whorl, while 5. anomala usually has 9 to 11; the shoulder of the body whorl is rounded, the ribs small and crowded. Hanetia dalli (Brown & Pilsbry, 1911) was figured by Olsson (1964) and this species also looks similar to S. anomala. This small study has demonstrated the great variability within the many species of Solenosteira and emphasizes the need for an in-depth or monographic examination of the group. Figures 1-8.

There can never be enough nudibranch books! Including the recent Eastern Pacific Nudibranchs (Behrens & Hermosillo, 2005), which updated Pacific Coast Nudibranchs (Behrens, 1980 and 1991), we now have three excellent field guides to the opisthobranch fauna of the northeastern Pacific along the American coasts, from Alaska to Peru. Each of these books is unique, distinguished from each other by different photographs and descriptive and introductory text. They are complementary to each other. Combined they represent the most comprehensive presentation of illustrative and written information about opisthobranch biodiversity, variation and natural history for any faunal regions worldwide. If a person had to choose just one, I could only recommend that all three be purchased, read, and used in the field or at the desk. Behrens & Hermosillo (2005) has already been reviewed (Bertsch, 2006), so this review presents the works of Camacho- Garcia et al., 2005, and Hermosillo et al., 2006. In the interests of editorial disclosure, it must be stated that I know personally, both as friends and colleagues, all six of the authors (some for over 30 years!). However, they know me well, and know that I would honestly say if I did not like (or disagreed with) their work. Nevertheless, these two books provide patent evidence for the esteem and respect in which 1 hold and value their science and friendship. Guia de Campo de las Babosas Marinas del Pacifico Este Tropical (CGGV) is bilingual. The Spanish and English text (excepting the Identification Keys) are printed on the same page, which enables the reader to review the material rapidly in either language. Dichotomous identification keys (Span., pp. 32-42; Eng., pp. 43-53) form a substantial portion (15%) of the pagination. The ordinal/subordinal key leads one to the 10 individual species-level keys for Acteonids and Cephalaspideans, Sacoglossans, Anaspideans, Tylodinids, Pleurobranchids, Dorids ( = Cryptobranchs), Phanerobranch Dorids, Arminids and Janolids, Dendronotaceans, and Aeolids. The informative introduction (illustrated with anatomical line drawings, color photographs and SEMs) explains opisthobranch external morphology, anatomy, natural history and physiology, defense, biogeography, importance and usage (referencing the Nobel prize- winning research of Eric Kandel on Aplysia nervous systems), and collecting methods. Species’ descriptions follow the 3-species-per-page boiler-plate standard established in the Sea Challengers natural history guide books, most with the sections Size, Page 8 THE FESTIVUS V°1 . XX XIX(l); 2007 Morphology, Natural History, and Geographic Range. Some species’ texts include Etymology (almost in a random appearance); very rarely are Remarks given. Common names are given in both English and Spanish. By far the majority of the photos (primarily taken by Terrence M . Gosliner) are portrait-style “tub shots,” expertly lit, in focus, and showing the animals’ complex colors and shapes. With the exceptions of the chromo- variable Cyerce orteai (and egg mass). Taringa aivica, Flabellina telja, F. marcusorum, and Phestilla lugubris, all species have one identifying full-color photograph. I confess to hesitation in accepting the labelled “ Glossodoris baumanni juvenil” (page 81), and suggest it is most probably a juvenile Chromodoris sphoni. One particularly compelling series were black-and-white apertural-view photos of the animal-less shells of Acetonids, Atys, and Julia. Several specimens bear radular bore holes, suggesting that the sandy environs support gastropod predators on those opisthobranchs ( s.l .) which are still confined to the plesiomorphic use of the shell for defense. Opistobranquios de Mexico (HBRJ) is a visually stunning presentation of the intimacies of 234 species of “babosas marinas.” Its illustrative variety, bold layout and comprehensive text emphasize the dynamism of opisthobranch evolutionary ecology. Nudibranchs (used synecdochically) are all dressed up for their own Mardi Gras. Even the perfunctory title pages, dedication, credits, table of contents and preface are gloriously enhanced with vibrant photos of these “butterflies of the seas” cavorting in their search for food or sex. Yahweh might have made the Great Whales for His amusement” (Psalm 104), but he subcontracted the marine slugs to the natural selection team of Van Gogh, Giotto and Gauguin. The introduction describes and copiously illustrates their forms and colors, commerical importance, feeding and the radula, sensory organs and rhinohores, respiration, reproduction (with an entire page of photos of nudibranchs in flagrante delicto and of their egg masses), collection, preservation and identification (all stages of the process are photographed), and biogeography (including a full page of mini-photos of various habitats). A section on nomenclature terminology, derivation and symbols, “How to Use This Book,” and an illustrated glossary follows. Species’ description categories (again following the Sea Challengers template) are external morphology, radular formula, natural history, size, geographic distribution, and etymology. Spanish common names are given. Nearly all photographs were taken in situ by Alicia Hermosillo. Quite frequently the egg mass and/or prey item are included in the underwater image and multiple shots of the species reveal a range of coloration differences, behavioral activities or substrate occurrences. The jumps-out-at-you photograph (p. 10) of Tambja abdere on its prey bryozoan Sessibugula is definitely a self-proclamation of nudibranch-ness! Today’s web-based data sites provide copious amounts of nudibranch information and photographs; they also give access to “conversation” with recognized experts, photographers and aficionados. The Appendix (HBRJ, p. 143) lists web sites related to opisthobranchs. Regrettably, the URL given in the References (p. 140) to McDonald & Nybakken’s list of worldwide food habits of nudibranchs is erroneous; it should be: http://theveliger.org/nudibranch_food.html . These two excellent faunal guides complement each other. The geographic areas of coverage are allopatric: HBRJ covers the fauna occurring along the Pacific and Sea of Cortez Mexican coasts, and at the territorial offshore islands (map, p. 11). CGGV describes the more southerly tropical eastern Pacific, from the border of Mexico-Guatemala to the Peru-Chile border and the Islas Gal pagos, with major collecting efforts in Costa Rica. Given the different zoogeographic provinces covered (the temperate Californian and the tropical Panamic provinces, which includes a subtropical division, and the distinct regions of the Gulf of California, and the west coasts of Mexico, Central and South America), the same species are not included in both books. CGGV presents 163 species, 1 15 named, 48 unnamed (29%) without binomials but identified to genus; HBRJ includes 234 species, 204 named, 30 unnamed (13%). Of these, 8 unnamed and 83 named species occur in both books. Hence the total fauna identified for the combined range of coverage in these works is 305 species, of which 69 (22.6%) are unnamed. Eastern Pacific Nudibranchs (BH) reports 314 species, which includes 277 named and 37 unnamed (12%), from Alaska to Central America. The coverage of BH adds the cold water Alaskan and Oregonian provinces; it has 80 species (9 unnamed and 71 named) not found in CGGV and HBRJ. Therefore, based on the data presented in these three books, the opisthobranch fauna of the west coast of the Americas, from Alaska to southern Peru (excluding several Philine spp., and the bathyal Bathydoris aioca ), is 385 species, of which 78 are unnamed (20%), and 307 named. The highest percentage of unnamed species occurs in the southern Vol. XXXIX(l): 2007 THE FESTVUS Paje 9 portion of the Panamic Province, reflecting the different amounts of research activity in these areas. A full analysis of these biogeographic data is warranted (Bertsch, in prep.). Higher level opisthobranch taxonomy is in flux. Not even suffixes are consistent. In CGGV (see p. 27) a glaring lack of stating of Categorical ranks occurs above the Family level. “ Heterobranquios superiores. Higher Heterobranchs” appears to be placed at the same level as the traditional Orders Cephalaspidea, Sacoglossa, Anaspidea and Nudibranchia, but none are so labelled. Tylodinoidea and Pleurobranchomorpha (certainly Pleurobranchoidea is preferable and correct, as CGGV themselves use on pages 30, 36, and 47; see also Vonnemann et al., 2005) are likewise typographically within the Order position, but again without proper indication of category. This separation of the Notaspidea into two clades is in complete agreement with recent work by Wagele & Willan (2000) and Vonnemann et al. (2005), who introduce and use Nudipleura, and with their own (CGGV) phylogenetic lineage. Let me comment on their significant diagram (CGGV, p. 7) which shows the main opisthobranch lineages organized according to their evolutionary history. The apical branches are all Orders, although this designation is not stated; the formerly-standard 5 are divided into 7, with the additions of “ Heterobranquios superioresIWigbet Heterobranchia” and the two former subsets of “Notaspidea,” “ry/odino/rfeoj/Tylodinids’and “ PleurobrancoideoslP\\z\\xxobTanc.b\\ds>\" (note the latter is not “ Pleurobranchomorfideos/PleurobranchomoTphs”). The points of basal origin of the tree and the horizontal bars indicate major evolutionary synapomorphies, which are used to define nomenclatural rankings or clades. The placement of this figure's upper title is confusing regarding taxa included in Subclass Opisthobranchia. Does this clade include everything above the base of the tree (as indicated by the length of the line under “Opistobranquios/Opisthobranchs”), or from above the first horizontal line in the tree? The latter is most probable, since based on Mikkelsen's (1996) phylogeny, Higher Heterobranchs/Acteonids are not opisthobranchs. Does the named taxon Nudipleura include the two branches above the second-from-the-top horizontal bar? What is its category rank? Would we need the other Order-level clades positioned in different similarly ranked taxa? The logical phylogenetic consequence of this relationship ranks both Tylodinoidea and Pleurobranchoidea as separate opisthobranch Orders, with the Pleurobranchoidea and Nudibranchia monophyletically included within Nudipleura. Of the traditionally recognized 4 suborders of Nudibranchia, Arminina is paraphyletic (CGGV, pp. 29. 31, 39 and 50; HBRJ, p. 108; BH, p. 100; Wagele & Willan, 2000, pp. 170-171). Accepting this establishes 2 monophyletic subordinal level clades: Arminina and either Janolina [?], or Zephyrinina [?], or Proctonotina [?]. (Note: [?] indicates name priority not determined.) The Family is spelled Arminiidae (HBRJ and BH) and Arminidae (CGGV), this latter probably being the correct orthography. CGGV (pp. 28-29, and 31) utilize 5 Suborders, without a Categorical rank, but spell each 2 different ways: Doridacea (Doridoidea), Dendronotacea (Dendronotoidea), Arminacea (Arminoidea), Janolidacea (Janolidoidea), and Aeolidacea ( Aeolidoidea). HBRJ and BH use the 4 Suborders Doridina, Dendronotina, Arminina, and Aeolidina. CLEM AM's taxonomic data base on European Marine Mollusca (2006: www.somali.asso.fr/clemam/biotaxis.php) places Proctonotidae within Unassigned Nudibranchia (the janolid group), and uses the spellings Doridina, Dendronotina, Arminina, and Aeolidiina (note thedouble “i”). Only one of the three suffix spelling alternatives should be used. Science advances with the known and the unknown. Discovery allows us to ask where our search can continue. Guia de Campo de las Babosas Marinas del Pacifico Este Tropical and Opistobranquios de Mexico are magnificent clarion calls, challenging us with their comprehensive presentations to keep observing, caring for and protecting the denizens and habitats of the ocean. Beauty of the Beasts: flailing swimmers ( Flabellina cynara), sea goddesses ( Glossodoris sedna), slimy slugs (Tambja abdere), singing lion kings (Hermosita hakunamatata) , fathers’ pride (Favorinus elenalexiarum), and even a sour apricot slug (Berthellina ilisima). These and hundreds of other opisthobranchs are spectacularly illustrated and authoritatively described in these two guide books. Thanks to the efforts of Yolanda, Terrence, Angel, Alicia, David and Eduardo, tropical eastern Pacific babosas marinas have never looked better— well, except when you discover them underw ater!

XXX I X ( 2) : 2007 CLUB NEWS Minutes of the San Diego Shell Club Meeting January 18, 2007 The meeting was called to order by President John LaGrange at 7:45 p.m. The minutes of the previous meeting were accepted as printed in The Festivus. Carole Hertz revealed the date of the upcoming Auction: April 28. Librarian Marilyn Goldammer presented up-to-date Library Lists for those attending the meeting. Carole announced that SCUM would be meeting across the street, at the San Diego Natural History Museum, on Saturday beginning at 8 a.m. Wes Farmer has secured our meeting room for not only year 2007, but also 2008. The Festivus has articles ready through March. Carole announced that Twila Bratcher Critchlow has died. She and her sister, Billee Gerrodette have traveled the world together and collected shells from exotic places. Now the donation of their collections is enhancing our Annual Auction. The speaker of the evening, Cynthia Catton Button, was introduced by John LaGrange. As a graduate student at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, she is entitling her thesis Population Biology of Two Broadcast-Spawning Gastropods. Within a 9-hectare box off Pt. Loma, she is studying population dynamics of Haliotis corrugata and Astraea undosa. Although California Fish & Game estimates a necessary spawning population density of 2,000 individuals per hectare, in reality there are only about 100 of the abalone per hectare. A moratorium has been placed on abalone in 1998 due to its decline. Because of the abalone's sedentary existence, an aggregation is necessary for broadcast spawning to take place. Astraea undosa and H. corrugata have similar life histories, but the turban is mobile and extremely abundant at the Pt. Loma management of the fishery. Much discussion followed her presentation. The meeting was adjourned at 8:55 p.m. Coffee and cookies provided by John LaGrange and Nancy Schneider were enjoyed by all. Nancy Schneider The Annual Auction/Potluck April 28, 2007 The date has been set and the place has been secured for the Club’s Annual Auction/Potluck. For the 17th consecutive year, Wes Farmer will be hosting this affair at the community room at his condo. It is the perfect place, he is the perfect host and - do we have shells for you!! Two weeks ago, members of the board assembled for a day to work on the shells for the auction and many fantastic specimens have been selected for the voice auction, with great buys for the silent auction and the $ 1- table. As a bit of a teaser, we might mention that there are some very special shells such as: Cypraea ostergaardi Dali, 1921; Haliotis dalli Henderson, 1915; Strombus taurus Reeve, 1857, and Boreotrophon bentleyi (Dali, 1908) that are awaiting new homes. Save the date and remember that festivities begin at 5:00 p.m. for relaxing fluid, socializing and browsing the shells for the voice auction and the silent auction tables. Dinner is at 6:00 p.m. and the voice auction begins promptly at 7:00 p.m. A map will be included with the April issue. Hope to see you there! IN MEMORIAM Twila Bratcher Critchlow November 29, 191 1 - December 25, 2006 It is with sadness that we report the passing of Twila Bratcher Critchlow. She has gladdened the lives of all who knew her and has contributed gready to the field of malacology. The Festivus is preparing a special issue in tribute to Twila. Vo 1 . XXX I X(2): 2007 THE FESTIVUS Page 13 RESULTS OF DEEP-WATER DREDGING IN THE GULF OF MEXICO USING THE \"BENTHIC SKIMMER\"; AND REPORT ON SEVERAL GEOGRAPHIC EXTENSIONS, INCLUDING TWO SPECIES NOT PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN THE WESTERN ATLANTIC EMILIO F. GARCIA 115 Oak Crest Drive, Lafayette, Louisiana 70503, USA E-mail: Efg2112@louisiana.edu In July 2006, members of the Biology Department at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette led a group of marine biologists on a dredging expedition to the Gulf of Mexico. The area to be sampled extended from off the Louisiana coast to Tampa, Florida. Although there were several standard dredges available that had been used before in relatively shallow water, this time the plans called for sampling much deeper water where regular dredges would not work properly because of the very soft sediment that covered the bottom. For this purpose, a dredge was built following the exact design of the Benthic Skimmer, a dredge deployed in the late 1960s by Pequegnat et al. (1970) to study the benthic fauna of the Gulf of Mexico. The research vessel used by our expedition was the R/V Pelican , operated by LUMCON (Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium) with its homeport in Cocodrie, Louisiana. The Benthic Skimmer has the general shape of a capital I (Figure 1). It is larger than most dredges used by research vessels, having a frontal gape of 3 m, a length of 3.66 m, and a \"tail\" width of 1 .8 m. The three- meter opening increases the probability that a reasonable quantity of specimens are collected. The Benthic Skimmer was designed to be sufficiently heavy to permit rapid lowering and fast tows, as well as strong enough to remain intact on adverse substrates. Very important objectives were also the collecting of delicate marine life that would reach the surface in good condition, as well as long hauls, up to four hours, that would bring up a dredge relatively free of sediment. By using only twice the length of cable as there was depth, rather than the standard triple length, the dredge was prevented from digging too deeply into the soft sediment. The Benthic Skimmer was used in our expedition at five stations, ranging in depth from 600 to 2468 m. It took an average of about one hour to get the dredge down. In the first and deepest trial (2432 to 2468 m) the dredge was kept at the bottom for only one hour, as we were uncertain of its performance. However, the dredge performed without complications, free of sediment, and with a good sampling of invertebrates and fish. The Skimmer performed even better in the other four stations, where the bottom time was two hours instead of one. The dredge came up almost totally free of sediment, which suggests that the four-hour hauls recommended by the designers seemed very plausible. The total molluscan catch in the four stations was 28 lots comprising 24 species: 18 gastropods and 6 bivalves. Ironically, the design of the dredge had prevented the gathering of sediment and, therefore, the collection of micromollusks other than the few specimens that were entangled, by chance, in the rest of the biota. The species collected are as follows: (The letter \"L\" after a name indicates species that were collected live.)

The single specimen collected is in almost pristine condition and shows all the characters of the species. Gregorioiscala pachya (Figure 6) has been collected in southwestern Europe and the Azores (Bouchet & Waren, 1986: 544, figs. 1254-1255). It has not been reported from the western Atlantic. Although the single specimen was collected dead and has a broken apex, it perfectly matches the unusual characters of the taxon, as well as the specimens figured by Bouchet & Waren. Although I have said elsewhere that the differences between Gregorioiscala and Opalia s.l. are nebulous (Garcia, 2004:1), I follow Bouchet & Waren (1986: 544) in placing this taxon in Gregorioiscala . Interestingly, a second deep-water epitoniid species, Eccliseogyra formosissima (Jeffreys, 1884) (Figure 7), formerly known only from off Portugal, Morocco and the Azores (Bouchet & Waren, 1986: 483, fig. 1142), has also recently been reported from the hydrocarbon vents, off the Fouisiana coast (Garcia, 2003). Globidrillia smirna (Figure 5) has been reported from off the northwestern coast of Cuba, but has not been reported from the northern Gulf of Mexico until now. The fact that two live specimens were found at two non- consecutive stations seems to show that it is well settled in the northern Gulf. Calliotropis actinophora (Figure 3) is a wide-spread species, occurring from Rio de la Plata, Argentina, to the Florida Straits. However, it had never been reported north of 25°37’ or west of 82°35' (Quinn, 1979). Three live specimens were dredged at NSF. 111.26. Leucosyrinx subgrundifera (Figure 11) had been reported by Dali (1881) as inhabiting the eastern Gulf of Mexico, between the Mississippi Delta and Cedar Key. However, this is the first report of this species for the northwestern quadrant of the Gulf of Mexico. A single, dead specimen of Volutomitra bairdii had been reported (Garcia & Fee, 2004) from the hydrocarbon vents off Fouisiana. The worn specimen conforms with the holotype of the species. The three live specimens of Volutomitra cf. bairdii (Figures 9 and 10) collected on this trip have a more pronounced shoulder and heavier axial ribs than the holotype. However, they may only be ecomorphs Other species collected, not quite conforming with described species, may also be ecomorphs: The single specimen of Amygdalum cf. politum (Figure 2) measures 16 mm in length and 9 mm in width, with a width/length ratio of 0.56. It has a wider shell than that of Amygdalum politum , which has an average width/length ration 0.43. The specimens of Macoma cf. tenta have a more rectilinear dorsal, posterior edge, and a more pointed anterior end than Macoma tenta. The two specimens of Gymnobela cf. chyta (Watson, 1881) (Figure 8) follow the description given by Bouchet & Waren (1980:58, fig. 110), but are more elongated than their figure and have Vol. XXXIX(2): 2007 THE FESTIVUS Page 15 Plate I.

Refreshments were available at 8:00 a.m. and the meeting was officially convened at 9:00 a.m. There were 48 attendees (Figure 1), a record number for SCUM meetings. Tom Demere, Curator of Paleontology at SDNHM, welcomed the group and set out the agenda for the day. He then turned over the meeting to Scott Rugh, Collection Manager in that department, the host for the meeting. There was a round of self-introductions with each person giving some brief remarks on their interests and/or accomplishments in malacology during the past year. As examples, Lindsey Groves of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County (LACM) talked of working on the oldest known abalone fossil and about nearing completion of a database on 100,000 lots of specimens and Jim McLean gave a status report of his books on the gastropods from Alaska to southern California. It looks like he is making giant strides and there is a chance that at least one volume would be published within two years. He had two binders containing many beautiful plates to show the attendees. At the conclusion of the self-introductions, the meeting proceeded to the first of nine brief PowerPoint presentations. The first presenter was Hans Bertsch who gave a brief report of a newly-described nudibranch named for him and his wife Rosa and showed the picture featured in the latest issue of The Nautilus. He also briefly discussed the new book to be available shortly, an updated version of the Sea of Cortez Marine Invertebrates by Alex Kerstich and Hans Bertsch. This is a field guide to living species and he showed some of the species. He concluded with an abbreviated version of the paper that he gave at the Seattle AMS/WSM meeting on Steinbeck & Ricketts. Kent Trego spoke next on the abyssal-hadal holothurians from the Chile Trench. He showed a preserved example of a very large holothurian, Psychropotes longicauda, from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) benthic collection. The following presentation was Relative Influence of Predation and Recruitment of the Invasive Asian Mussel by Brian Cheng and Kevin Hovel from San Diego State University (SDSU). Brian was the presenter and he discussed biodiversity loss, food-web disruption, economic costs, and accelerating invasion rate. He spoke primarily about the invasive mussel species, Musculista senhousia, in Mission Bay, San Diego. The adverse effects include reduction of native clam growth and inhibition of seagrass reproduction. The mussel abundance increases exponentially. Pteropurpuraf estiva, a local murex, feeds on these mussels and can actually reduce local populations up to 95% . Brian is studying the effects of temperature, salinity and flow rate on the survival rate of the mussels. Michael Vendrasco was the next speaker and he spoke on Chitons and Other Mollusks Past and Present. He discussed: 1) shell microstructure in Cambrian mollusks, 2) aesthete canal morphology in the Mopaliidae and 3) chiton assemblages from the lower portion of the San Diego Formation. He talked of phosphatic internal and external coatings replicating shell microstructures and said that new data shows a nacreous linear layer on internal shells for several species. Nerida Wilson spoke on the Phylogeography of the Antarctic Nudibranch Doris kerguelensis. The Drake Passage formed 41 million years ago and kept species in Antarctica isolated.

The question discussed was do circumpolar species exist at -40°F. Doris kerguelensis is a generalist sponge feeder, direct developer, has low dispersal capabilities and has been found at depths of 4 to 1550 m. Tuberal size and shape and body color vary with time. There are approximately 12-15 synonyms for this species which has been reported around the Antarctic continent. Phil Liff-Grieff describes himself as a hobbyist. He is an avid collector of land snails, minute shells and chitons. He talked briefly of land snail collecting in Hawaii and coastal California species in the family Helminthoglyptidae. He is interested in collecting localities and boundaries between sympatric species. Bill and Nancy Schneider followed with an update on their 2005 story of a black coral and its associated species that Bill collected while fishing off Hurricane Bank. They donated the coral to Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) where it will be housed in a special case. They showed pictures of all the species found with the coral and stated that there may be an undescribed barnacle species attached to the coral. Bill Hewson from California State University at Fullerton spoke on the Biogeography of Lottia Vol. XXXIX(2): 2007 THE FESTIVUS Page 21 strigatella and Lottia paradigitalis. It has long been considered that L. paradigitalis is the northern species and L. strigatella the southern species, with Pt. Conception as the point of separation. Bill’s molecular studies showed that there may be an overlap on both sides of the boundary and there may be a third species in the south which also makes it north of Pt. Conception. Wes Farmer gave the final presentation with a group of photos on what one might see on a fun day at the beach. This concluded the presentation phase of the meeting. The attendees had time during the meeting. particularly during the lunch break, to tour some of the permanent exhibits at the San Diego Natural History Museum with Scott Rugh. At the end of the meeting attendees were invited to visit the Paleontology and Marine Invertebrate Departments and their collections. The next annual SCUM meeting will be held in January 2008 at the LACM. Lindsey Groves will notify all interested parties of the date. My thanks to Lindsey Groves for providing the photograph of the group and the accompanying figure legend. IN MEMORIAM David K. Mulliner April 15, 1921 - January 24, 2007 It was a shock to learn that our long-time friend and colleague, Baja Dave, had died suddenly after a fall. All who knew him will be sadder for his passing. The Festivus will be publishing a remembrance of Dave in an upcoming issue.

It was with sadness that John announced the death of longtime member, Dave Mulliner. Visitor, Michael, from Colorado was welcomed, as was new member. Clint Crowe. President LaGrange introduced the evening's speaker. Bob Yin. noted underwater photographer. For the past fifty years Bob has been a diver, and a photographer for nearly that long. He currently spends four months a year traveling and diving. Much of his time is spent in the “Coral Triangle” of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippine Islands. And that is where he took us, by camera, computer, and projector. One of the few' pristine areas left in the world lies north of Australia in Indonesia, on the islands of Raja Ampat. Using a $200 digital camera. Bob showed us the small, tree-covered island of Wai, then zoomed in to reveal the single house present on the island. At night, he reported, fireflies lit up the forest like a Christmas tree. Underwater, his camera captured an opaque school of catfish that became detailed individuals in response to the zoom lens. Tridacna, Spondylus, Cypraea all were captured live by his lenses. A video clip from the camera revealed gently waving, spotted eagle rays, a juvenile whale shark in the background. Another clip revealed the emergence of a damsel fish from her home in a beer can. The audience was enthralled by these images. Silvana Vollero won the door prize (winning number pulled by son, Christian!). The meeting was adjourned at 8:30 p.m. Cookies on the coffee table were baked by Wes Farmer and John LaGrange.

Vol. XXXIX(3): 2007 THE FESTIVUS Page 25 OBSERVATIONS OF BROODING IN TWO SPECIES OF SAXICAVELLA FISCHER, 1978 (BIVALVIA, HIATELLIDAE, SAXICAVELLINAE) FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA KELVIN BARWICK AND TIMOTHY STEBBINS City of San Diego Marine Biology Laboratory, Environmental Monitoring and Technical Services Division, Metropolitan Wastewater Department, 2392 Kincaid Road, San Diego, California 92101, USA E-mail: Kbarwick@sandiego.gov Introduction Little is known about brooding in the Hiatellidae, although it is a common reproductive strategy in other bivalve mollusks occurring in more than 30 different families (Sellmer, 1967; Mackie, 1984). In fact, the only record for this family or any Hiatelloidea is that of Scott (1994) who described a new type of brood protection in the genus Saxicavella. Partly because of the unique and apparently restricted nature of this particular method of brooding, Scott erected a new subfamily, the Saxicavellinae. and also suggested that the group should possibly be elevated to family status. This note provides additional information and observations of this unique form of larval protection in the two species of Saxicavella that occur in southern California waters, Saxicavella nybakkeni Scott, 1994, and Saxicavella pacifica Dali, 1916. Methods The specimens examined in this study were collected as pan of the Southern California Bight 2003 Regional Monitoring Project (Bight’03) conducted in the summer of 2003. Infauna samples were collected with a 0. 1 m2 Van Veen grab and sieved through a 1 mm mesh screen. Material retained on the screen was placed in a relaxant solution of about 1 kg MgS04 per 20 L of seawater for at least 30 minutes, and then fixed in 10% sodium borate buffered formalin for a minimum of 72 hours. Each sample was then rinsed with freshwater and transferred to 70% ethyl alcohol for final preservation. All organisms in the samples were sorted into major taxonomic categories (e.g., mollusks, annelids, arthropods, echinoderms), and sent to experienced taxonomists for species identification. Bivalve mantle morphology and terminology used herein are modified after Yonge (1971). Results and Discussion Saxicavella specimens with brood attached were collected from two different sites located in the northern part of Southern California Bight (SCB) during the Bight’03 regional survey (Table 1). Adults of both species were present at each site. Although a total of 12 adults occurred in these samples, only 3 animals were observed with brood attached to the middle and outer mantle folds. Brooding adults included 1 specimen of Saxicavella nybakkeni and 2 specimens of Saxicavella pacifica. In a sample containing 3 adult S. nybakkeni and 1 adult S. pacifica , only 1 specimen of S. nybakkeni had brood animals attached to the mantle folds (Figures 1-2). A total of 4 offspring were evident with an average length of 0.28 mm. Three of the offspring were attached on or very near the middle mantle fold of the parent along the posterior margin of the pedal aperture, while the fourth offspring was affixed to the outer mantle fold. The method of brood attachment, while probably a byssus (Scott, 1994), was not evident. This sample was collected at a Bight’03 station located offshore of Page 26 THE FESTIVUS Vol. XX X IX ( 3 )^2007 Table 1. Brooding Saxicavella from the Bight’03 Regional Monitoring Survey Number of Adults Station Depth (m) Date Species Total Brooding Brood Observations 4079 36.5 23 July 2003 S. nybakkeni 3 1 4 attached offspring (Figures 1, 2) S. pacifica 1 0 No brood 4123 56.5 30 July 2003 S. nybakkeni 1 0 No brood S. pacifica 7 2 1 adult with 1 attached offspring; 1 adult with 2 attached offspring (Figures 3-5) Carpinteria, California in olive-green sediments composed of silt and clay. In a second sample from the same survey, 2 out of 7 individuals of S. pacifica present were discovered with brood attached (Figures 3-5). A single specimen of S. nybakkeni was also found in this sample but with no external brood evident. One of the adult S. pacifica had a single offspring and the other had 2 offspring, with the individual brood animals attached at their ventral shell margin. The offspring were affixed to the parents along the midline of the ventrum on the outer mantle fold, posterior of the pedal aperture. The 3 offspring averaged 0.31 mm in length. As with brooding S. nybakkeni , the method of brood attachment was not evident here for S. pacifica , although it was also likely by a byssus. These specimens were collected at a Bight’03 site located off the coast of Gaviota, California in olive-green sediments composed of sand, silt, and clay. Scott (1994) reported finding broods of S. nybakkeni in a pouch formed between the inner and outer mantle folds. He hypothesized that as the brood animals develop, they migrate to the outer mantle before being released. This fits well with the present observations where offspring for both S. nybakkeni and S. pacifica were found attached to the middle and outer mantle folds of the parents. These records provide additional evidence of this unique form of larval protection in Saxicavella and further support Scott’s proposition that the subfamily Saxicavellinae should be elevated to family level.

Valdes, editors Published by the American Malacological Society (Pittsburgh. PA), 445 pp. $35.95 USD How times have changed! This book is a continuation of the American Malacological Society’s How to Collect Shells , editions 1-4, published from 1942 to 1974. Note that the 4th edition was titled How to Studx and Collect Shells (emphasis mine); already it was reflecting a need to learn more about the animals inside the shells. This current edition also reflects the times by concentrating even more on the study of mollusks and includes a sizeable contribution on their curation: maintaining collections of shells and wet specimens, and even the use of databases to keep track of collections both in museums and private collections. The editors have done a wonderful job of putting together 31 chapters by assorted molluscan experts on topics as diverse as molluscan anatomy, an introduction to phylogeny (wow, was that ever valuable to an old codger like me!), chapters and sections on collecting, sections on each mollusk type and their ecology and evolution, preservation and curation (don’t put your shells in an oak cabinet!), conservation and extinction (more mollusks have gone extinct than birds and mammals combined), and even useful websites and organizations to join to meet other malacologists and contribute to molluscan conferences. I wish I could review each chapter separately, all by my colleagues and friends, but space is limiting so I’ll pick out a few highlights. Chapter Three by Burch and Sturm, is largely a rewrite of Tom Burch’s 1941 article on remote bottom collecting. As he points out, it was obviously written before SCUBA was invented (and Chapter Four covers collecting by SCUBA) but the tools and techniques are still used and useful today. As he points out: “every shell collector who has gotten up at an unearthly hour in the morning to collect at a minus tide has gazed out beyond the narrow band of shore left uncovered by the retreating waters and wondered what rare treasures he could find, if the sea would but drop a hundred feet or so for awhile.” He then goes on to discuss simple dredges, grabs, traps and tangle nets for personal use to catch mollusks. Not everyone can SCUBA dive and as one who has had to give it up myself, I still collect vicariously using such methods. As a cephalopod specialist I especially appreciated Andy Anderson’s chapter on cephalopods. Have you ever wondered how the Smithsonain Institution went about preserving a giant squid? In light of the first videos and first capture of a live giant squid such curiosity might lead you to this chapter where you learn how to do it. Andy goes on to discuss the different orders of cephalopods, their taxonomy, behavior, evolution and curation in detail. I have a small quibble with this section. Cephalopods, especially octopuses, are intelligent animals. Octopuses can learn classic target training for food, navigate mazes, and open screw-top and even child-proof pill bottles to get at food. They have individual personalities, they exhibit play behavior, and they can recognize individual humans. As such we have to think of the ethics of capturing them, maintaining them in laboratories, and narcotization and euthanasia as we would for chimpanzees maintained in the lab. I would have liked to see more mention of the ethics of dealing with these clever animals in an otherwise excellent review of the class. Maybe it will be emphasized more in the next edition. I've always had a fascination with the Aplacophora, a class of mollusks first discovered in 1844, unlike most other mollusks that were written about by Aristotle. Without shells, these are far different from cephalopods and the other classes of mollusks. They are all worm-like maybe showing an evolutionary connection to annelid worms, and they burrow in deep soft sediments. They have a radula and a mantle cavity like any other good mollusk and they are covered thoroughly by the eminent contributor Amelie Scheltema. Overall, this is a wonderful book that every malacologist and most shell collectors should own. It is the most up-to-date text on mollusks in general, and it contains a wealth of information for all people interested in the phylum. Note that if you order it direct from the publisher (Universal Publishers, Boca Raton, FL) a greater percentage of the profit goes to the AMS. You can also order it from the American Malacological Society website. Roland Anderson Vol. XXXIX(3): 2007 THE FESTIVUS Page 29 A TRAWL-CAUGHT PEN SHELL, ATRINA OLDROYDI DALL, 1901, COLLECTED BY THE ORANGE COUNTY SANITATION DISTRICT CHRISTINA THOMAS Orange County Sanitation District OCSD, division 635, 10844 Ellis Avenue, Fountain Valley, California 92708. USA E-mail: cthomas@ocsd.com The Orange County Sanitation District (OCSD) is a large publicly owned treatment works plant that discharges highly treated wastewater to the ocean through an off-shore, submarine outfall located off Newport Beach and Huntington Beach, California. The OCSD’s discharge is jointly regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, who issue the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit under the Federal Clean Water Act. This permit requires OCSD to implement an ocean monitoring program (OMP) that evaluates potential environmental and public health effects from the wastewater discharge. A major component of the OMP is assessing the health of demersal fish and epibenthic macroinvertebrates (EMI) through oner trawl sampling. The OCSD trawls at nine core-monitoring stations and one historic station bi-annually (summer and winter). During routine, summer sampling on August 21, 2006, OCSD collected a live, intact Atrina oldroydi Dali, 1901, at the trawl station T1 (33° 34.620 N; 118° 0.449' W) (Figure 1). This station is located at the end of the outfall pipe at a depth of 60 m. Like all the 60 m stations in OCSD’s monitoring area, T1 has soft, sandy sediments, but the area near the outfall tends to have a larger grain size and a lower percentage of fines than the other 60 m sites probably due to scouring of currents and shell hash (i.e. bivalve shells attached to the outfall structure) (OCSD 2005). Atrina oldroydi is rarely collected in trawl nets. In fact, this is the first trawl record of an Atrina species in OCSD’s monitoring area in over 30 years of sampling. Two animals, however, were collected in 1998 at station ZB2 with a VanVeen grab sampler. Station ZB2 is also located near the outfall pipe and is at the boundary of the zone of initial dilution (ZID). Because pen shells are so brittle and fragile, they are rarely collected intact. These animals are protected Figure 1. Atrina oldroydi collected off Huntington Beach. California at 60 m. length 201 mm. by the mud into which they bury with only a portion of the posterior margin of the shell exposed above the surface. The shell is anchored into the protective sediment by the byssus. Trawl nets are designed to collect animals that live on the sediment surface, thus a buried pen shell is very rarely collected in trawls. This intact pen shell was likely jostled by something, such as ray feeding, which removed some of the protective sediments or it was no longer held in place by its byssus (Don Cadien. personal communication). The Atrina oldroydi specimen collected by OCSD has a large, dark brown and olive colored shell, measuring 201 mm in length and 1 19 mm in height. It fits the description from Coan et al. (2000) of “relatively thick, with low commarginal lamellae and obscure, low radial ribs; periostracum thick.” The animal does, however, have some raised, serrated radial ribs, which is consistent with A. texta. Upon further Page 30 THE FESTIVUS The Feetivue. American Museum of Natural History Received on: 03-19-07 investigation and comparison of vouchered Atrina species at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History (SBMNH), SCAMIT (Southern California Association of Invertebrate Taxonomists) taxonomists concurred that the animal was A. oldroydi , despite the low serrations and being collected out of its depth range, which is reported at 2-46 m from San Pedro, California to Punta Pequena. Baja California Sur (Coan et al., 2000). The OCSD has preserved this animal in 100% ethanol and added it to its voucher collection. Prior to preserv ation, the animal was kept frozen until a sample of adductor muscle tissue was extracted by Paul Valentich-Scott at the SBMNH (vouchered as SBMNH 83 140). DNA analysis of this muscle tissue may lead to a better understanding of the Atrina species. Literature Cited COAN. EUGENE V. PAUL VALENTICH SCOTT AND FRANK R. BERNARD 2000.
