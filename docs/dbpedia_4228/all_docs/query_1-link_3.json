        "text": "âIâm realising that my biggest problem, now as then,â says Andy Roberts, âis that I get so bored in the studio. I just want to bang it down and get on with something else. In the â70s I was so busy rushing around from one gig to another, one session to another, one collaboration to another, that I couldnât be bothered to polish anything in the way that other artists did. There wasnât enough time.\n\nAndyâs âfailingâ, though, has been responsible for an extraordinarily rich and, up till now, largely untapped (on CD) seam of music from the glory days of rock â intriguingly crafted, beautifully played, often luxuriantly produced (at odds with that âbang-it-downâ remembrance), and, taken as a body of work, the product of a man who deserves to be written back into the history which so curiously seems to have airbrushed him out or, at best, demoted his name to that of a Zelig-like footnote in the sories of other people.\n\nAndy Roberts is an enigma: a man whose story involves playing on hit singles while studying for (and achieving) a law degree in the â60s; playing on an album produced by Jimi Hendrix; hanging out at Paul McCartneyâs place during the Beatlesâ studio years; playing the Albert Hall and touring America with Led Zeppelin in 1969; playing both 1969 and 1970 Isle of Wight Festivals."
