        "text": "Andy Roberts has exited Bauer Media after 26 years.\n\nRoberts confirmed on social media that he has left his position as Kiss group programme director. He has yet to confirm a new role.\n\nHe recently helped Kiss brand extension Kisstory becoming the market leader for digital-only networks with RAJAR Q2 ratings of 2.323m. The main Kiss station was down 4.4% year-on-year to 5.379m\n\n“Today I left Bauer Media and Kiss and a career that I'm proud of with many achievements along the way,” said Roberts.\n\nRoberts was pivotal in the creation of new brand extensions – including Kisstory, Kiss Fresh and the new online radio stations Kiss Dnce, Kiss Ibiza and KISS Garage – as well as signing on-air talent.\n\nSteve Parkinson, group MD, national radio, Bauer Media, said: “Andy Roberts is a highly skilled, innovative and passionate programme director. He re-invented Kiss ensuring that the brand remained the pre-eminent rhythmic music and commercial youth orientated radio station in the United Kingdom. We wish him well in his next endeavours.”"
