        "text": "Now that I have your attention - here is a show you HAVE to mark down on your calendar\n\nI'm sure you agree with me, there is nothing more exciting than feeling your adrenaline pumping, with the anticipation of your favorite band hitting the stage. This October at one of the coolest venues in all of North Dakota - Warrant will be at Prarie Knights Casino and Resort October 12th! Here is what Prairie posted on their Facebook page yesterday:\n\nCherry Pie and Cherry Bomb!\n\nGet ready to “Rock and Roll All Night” with the legends themselves—Warrant and the one and only Lita Ford—coming to The Pavilion on Saturday, October 12th!\n\nWhether you're ready to scream “Heaven” at the top of your lungs or belt out “Kiss Me Deadly”, this is a night you won’t want to miss!\n\nTickets go on sale this Thursday at 10 AM CST. They’ll go fast, so be ready to grab yours and get set for a night of pure rock ‘n’ roll energy!\n\nSo how epic is that? Let me tell you a few things about Prairie Knights Casino - some people may say that \"it takes too long to drive out there...\" - Hey it's only 47 miles from our studios here in Mandan. A relaxing scenic drive in under 50 minutes, and there is literally \"not a bad seat in the house\". Simple planning will make it so much better - you can start by getting yourself a hotel room - so affordable and it will alleviate all the worry and stress off your mind - no need to rush home after the show. You deserve to get away and catch an awesome show!"
