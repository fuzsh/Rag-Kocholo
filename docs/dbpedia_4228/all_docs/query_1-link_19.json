        "text": "Plainsong was formed in 1971 by Iain Matthews and Andy Roberts. Following the release of their classic LP \"In Search Of Amelia Earhart\" the group toured extensively and then set about recording a second album. Before these sessions were completed the band disintegrated in less than a year. Plainsong had been born, made an indelible mark on musical history and then disappeared.\n\nFast forward twenty years: Iain and Andy decide that the time is right to revive Plainsong and recruit Mark Griffiths and Julian Dawson. This quartet released three albums from 1992 to 1996 and whilst touring to promote these recordings, built up a strong following: a combination of devotees of the original line-up, fans of solo projects by group members and people hearing Plainsong for the first time.\n\nAs 1996 drew to a close, Julian left the band to concentrate on his solo career. His replacement is Clive Gregson - and so to Plainsong, 1999:\n\nCLIVE GREGSON - Vocal, Guitars, Mandolin\n\nOriginally from Manchester, now resident in Nashville. Founder of Stiff Records band Any Trouble, longtime member of the Richard Thompson Band, half of classic folk-rock duo Gregson & Collister and solo singer/songwriter. A multi-instrumentalist, Clive's songs have been recorded by Kim Carnes, Fairport Convention and Smokie.\n\nMARK GRIFFITHS - Vocal, Bass, Guitar\n\nA native of Northampton, Mark was in the original line-up of Matthews Southern Comfort. A virtuoso multi-instrumentalist, Mark has graced recordings and performances by David Essex, Al Stewart, Gallagher & Lyle, The Everly Brothers, The Shadows, Sonny Curtis, Deniece Williams, Dobie Gray, Jeff Lynne, Mark Knopfler and Cliff Richard. He asked us not to mention The Nolans and Twiggy!\n\nIAIN MATTHEWS - Vocal, Guitar\n\nA founder member of Fairport Convention, Iain featured on their first three ground-breaking albums. He then formed Matthews Southern Comfort: three albums and a no. 1 UK hit (\"Woodstock\") later, Iain embarked on a solo career which has produced over twenty albums, a US Top 20 single (\"Shake It\") and a catalogue of first rate songs. Iain is one of contemporary music's finest singers.\n\nANDY ROBERTS\n\nDISCOGRAPHY:"
