        "text": "The expected disaster in commercial real estate looks far more benign than expected for insurers, despite their $900 billion of exposure.\n\nDespite the gloom and doom, there are numerous examples of companies achieving competitive advantage through their use of insurtech.&nbsp;\n\nLarge language models will let insurers onboard, renew and service risks at close to zero marginal cost, underpinned with consistent control over risk selection.&nbsp;\n\nBy automating routine tasks, AI can free adjusters to focus on the human aspects of their work that require empathy, nuanced judgment and creative problem-solving.\n\nOne area in which insurance companies can make immediate changes is in how (and how often) they communicate with their customers.\n\nThe IoT has become a permanent fixture in healthcare, helping in particular with remote patient monitoring, wearable medical devices and telemedicine."
