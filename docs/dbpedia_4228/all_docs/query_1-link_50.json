It was co-written with Vanity Fair contributor Sam Kashner.[93]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nAncestry\n\n[edit]\n\nOn a 2023 episode of Finding Your Roots featuring Julia Roberts, it was revealed that Eric Roberts' biological paternal great-great-grandfather's surname was actually Mitchell, not Roberts.[94]\n\nEric Roberts is a distant cousin of fellow actor Edward Norton.[95]\n\nRelationships and family\n\n[edit]\n\nA 1989 profile of actress Sandy Dennis in People says she had a live-in relationship with Roberts for five years at a seven-bedroom house she rented in Connecticut.[96] The relationship began several years after her 1974 parting from boyfriend Gerry Mulligan, a jazz musician who had lived with Dennis in the same house (whose Connecticut location was identified as Westport or Wilton in different People magazine articles).[96]\n\nIn 1981, some months after Roberts began living with Dennis, he was in a debilitating car accident near their home.[97] His ordeal was described by People magazine years later as \"a month-long hospital stay after a bad car accident in 1981.\" Leaving the Wilton house he lived with Dennis, Roberts went for a Jeep ride with his girlfriend's German shepherd. When the dog seemed to lean out too far, Roberts tried to get hold of him. He let go of the steering wheel, and the car ended up hitting a tree. He was in a coma for three days.[97] Dennis, an animal lover who cared for many dogs and cats, was relieved to learn her German shepherd was not injured in the accident.[98] After Roberts recovered, his live-in relationship with Dennis lasted a few more years. Author James Spada claimed that it came to an end because of his affair with actress Ellen Barkin,[10] while Roberts cited Dennis' refusal to start an animal shelter for some 100 stray cats living in the couple's shared home as the reason for their split.[84]\n\nRoberts broke off engagements with Dennis[99] and actress Dana Wheeler-Nicholson.[97] He has a daughter, Emma, from a live-in relationship with Kelly Cunningham;[100] Emma was born on February 10, 1991.[100] She eventually became an actress as well, making her major-film debut at age 10 in the 2001 drama Blow.[100] After Roberts' relationship with Cunningham, he married Eliza Garrett (daughter of screenwriters David Rayfiel and Lila Garrett) in 1992.[101][102] His stepson, Keaton Simons, is a singer-songwriter, and his stepdaughter, Morgan Simons, is a chef. Roberts became a grandfather for the first time in December 2020 when Emma gave birth to her first child, a son named Rhodes, with actor Garrett Hedlund.[103]\n\nOn January 12, 2001, Roberts visited The Howard Stern Radio Show with Garrett, during a segment called \"The Gossip Game\" with Mike Walker of the National Enquirer. He confirmed that he and his sister, Julia, had been estranged for several years. The source of the estrangement had been his past drug abuse and her siding with his ex-girlfriend over the custody of his daughter. In 2004, he told People magazine that he and his sister reconciled when he visited her in the hospital after she gave birth to twins.[104]\n\nLegal issues\n\n[edit]\n\nIn December 1987, Roberts was arrested after police found him banging on a woman's apartment door in Manhattan's Upper West Side. He was charged with criminal trespass, possession of cocaine and marijuana, and second-degree assault after he punched a police officer.[105] In February 1988, he pleaded guilty to harassment and was sentenced to six months on probation. His possession and assault charges were dropped.[106]\n\nIn February 1995, Roberts was arrested in Los Angeles for shoving his wife Eliza into a wall.[107]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\n— (2024).
