        "text": "A four-day music festival is set for its 13th year as festivalgoers help raise money for homeless and refugee women and children.\n\nFarmFest will return to Lynsters Farm in Maple Cross from Friday August 23 to Monday August 26, with a lineup of “exciting upcoming” indie artists including Pincher, Le Junk, Coming Up Roses, Millie Turner and Misty Miller.\n\nThe festival also offers on-site camping, craft beers on draught and a barbecue with options for vegetarians and vegans.\n\nAll ticket, food and drink sales will go towards running the farm which provides a home for 20 homeless and refugee women and children, some of whom fled the war in Ukraine, and organisers are hoping to raise £10,000 this year, up from £8,000 in 2023.\n\nFree summer events in Watford include Fringe and Jazz\n\nWatford's Notting Hill-inspired carnival returning for third year\n\n​Lynsters Farm and festival organiser Scott Albrecht said: “FarmFest isn’t Glastonbury. It’s a chilled-out single stage festival set in beautiful farmland next to a large, serene lake, where you can spend a few days discovering brilliant new bands from across the country.\n\n“We’re committed to showcasing some of the UK’s most exciting indie artists, and from the bands that take part to our brilliant lighting and sound teams, everyone takes huge pride in the show that we put on.”\n\nDay tickets start at £15 per adult or £50 for all four days and can be purchased online at farmfest.info or on the door."
