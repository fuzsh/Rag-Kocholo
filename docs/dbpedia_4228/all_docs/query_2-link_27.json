We are always stretching and reaching for that next goal.”\n\nIt has been that way for Roberts since he first played around on a piano as a child.\n\n“I started lessons when I was very young,” he said. “But I remember playing before I ever took a lesson. My mother played piano so we always had one.”\n\nHe said he started lessons officially when he was about 6, but was banging around on the piano a couple years before that.\n\n“I enjoyed exploring the keyboard,” Roberts said. “That’s how I still look at it. I’m in love with exploring the keyboard. It always felt very natural for me.”\n\nBy the time he was 14 he was playing in his brother’s rock band.\n\n“That’s when I learned you could make money doing this stuff,” he said. “It was mostly playing the local VFW and then some places that I probably wasn’t legally allowed to be.”\n\nThe experience solidified his dream of being a musician, so he attended the Berklee School of Music (where daughter Nicole currently follows in his footsteps) and worked on both performance and the business side of things.\n\n“Berklee is known for contemporary music styles,” he said. “Especially jazz. So it was a good fit for me.”\n\nHe has expanded since then to include music direction at several theaters, including the American Music Theatre and Prima in Lancaster and The Timbers in Mount Gretna.\n\n“I do enjoy the process of all those different things,” he said. “I love developing a show, getting a cast together and seeing how things gel, then rehearsing and putting it in front of an audience.”\n\nRoberts enjoys taking all different types of music and filtering it through his jazz ears to create something new, yet still familiar.\n\n“I almost hate to say jazz pianist,” he said. “Because I’m certainly a rock-and-roll guy as well. I stay true to the music that influenced me and that would be considered classic jazz. But once you know the structure of the song and you’ve stated the melody, then you can improvise and that’s essentially what we do. So really I just try to approach it that way and let my influences dictate the music.”\n\nIt works for him, too.\n\n“I think (jazz) sometimes finds you,” he said. “It’s always been there, and I feel lucky that there is a thing that I love to do that is also my work.”\n\nEmail Tracy Rasmussen: weekend@readingeagle.com.\n\nOriginally Published: May 21, 2015 at 1:00 a.m."
