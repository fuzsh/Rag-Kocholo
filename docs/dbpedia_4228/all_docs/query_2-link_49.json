Influenced by his surroundings and personal journey, Andy's songs deeply resonate with listeners, providing a genuine connection to his narratives.\n\t\n\tCareer path\n\t\n\tFirst public performance.\n\t\n\tA very young and inexperienced 14yr old  Andy was called up from the audience at a Ralph MvTell concert in the City Hall. Asked by MC John “The Fish” to take a turn on stage due to an embarrassing delay in the main star’s arrival, he surprised everyone there with his newly acquired skills singing “Motel Blues” by Loudon Wainwright and then a couple of originals. The packed audience’s enthusiastic  applause and cheers gave him the taste for it and he never looked back. \n\t\n\tParis Recordings\n\t\n\tPlucked from singing down in the metro by an Italian pop music producer, they embarked on making reel to reel Revox recordings of Andy’s songs after signing a very long and ultimately pointless contract. There were socials and photo shoots as well but the weekly journeys from one side of  Paris to the other petered out and those tapes have never been recovered. \n\t\n\tBack in Cornwall in the late 70s, Andy drove around with a huge combo amp in the back of a Mini Countryman and played occasional gigs in pubs at the back of nowhere.  \n\t\n\t1980s\n\t\n\tFor much the 80s and 90s music took a back seat to family and day job but for a  while Andy played electric guitar in a jazz funk band appearing in pubs in Canterbury and at the well supported “Mines not Missiles” Festival in Aylesham. \n\t\n\tIsland Escape\n\t\n\tShortly after arriving on the island, Andy bumped into an ex-member of Hawkwind and formed a duo to play in Yarmouth and Freshwater Bay. \n\tDespite these brief attempts at collaboration, Andy really is at heart a soloist singer songwriter suited to making arrangements for one voice and an acoustic guitar. The songbird sessions at Strings and acoustic originals at Quay arts provided platforms from which to become better known. One session involved having four of his songs performed by Jazz players Jim Thorne and John throne, with Chris from Plastic Mermaids on percusssion.   \n\tJust a year or two after deciding to launch full time into the pub circuit., the pandemic closed all venues indefinitely. So was that it, is it all over? Andy remembered his roots as a busker and set about working out how to do that on the internet. \n\t\n\tThe Power of Music in Challenging Times\n\t\n\tAs the world began to emerge from the confines of lockdowns, a simple stroll around Andy Roberts' village revealed something profound. Local people not seen for a year or more approached him, expressing their heartfelt gratitude for the solace his weekly Facebook live music concerts provided during those isolating months. This unexpected revelation was transformative for Andy.\n\tRecognising the profound emotional impact of his live music, he renewed his dedication to it. Now, with a mission to touch more hearts and souls, Andy brings his live music experience to venues throughout the Isle of Wight, continuing to be a beacon of hope and connection in a world that truly needs it.\n\t\n\tBeyond music, Andy's passion extends to permaculture and natural patterns, embracing their potential to mend the harm caused by current systems.\n\t\n\tPraise for Andy Roberts\n\t\n\t&quot;Always a pleasure to have Andy Roberts play at Caffè Isola!&quot;\n\t\n\t&quot;Some great music and vocals, thanks for sharing my friend, cheered me up no end in these dark times.&quot; - Online viewer.\n\t\n\t“You’re the real deal Andy” - Angelina\n\t\n\t&quot;You made lots of friends with your lovely choice of songs and playing.
