        "text": "Herbie Armstrong is a singer and a musician who reached the Semi-Finals of Series 5 of Britain's Got Talent. He was aged sixty six, worked as a pub landlord at the time of his audition. He hailed from Hampshire in Ireland.\n\nIn his audition, he sang and played the guitar 'Still In My Heart' before Amanda asked him to if he had a back-up song and requested he sang a song that the judges were more aware with. He then sang and played the guitar to 'Have I Told You Lately' by Van Morrison. Louis remarked that he possessed a 'Great voice', with Amanda adding that she could feel it were 'Kind of like [Herbie's] last shot' at fame.\n\nIn the Semi-Finals, he sang and played the guitar to 'Mandy', which was written by his friend Scott English as several colourful lights could be seen around the stage. Amanda remarked 'You do have great vulnerability', with Simon adding 'I think you could have done something a little less karaoke [and] a little bit more cool'.\n\nBefore BGT[]\n\nHe started his musical career there in Belfast in the early 1960s as a guitarist with the Manhattan Showband, alongside his friend Van Morrison. He became a member of the Golden Eagles, who then became The Wheels. The band gained a residency in Blackpool, and wrote and recorded the original version of \"Bad Little Woman\", later covered in America by The Shadows of Knight. The Wheels split up however though in 1967.\n\nHerbie and his bandmate and songwriting partner, singer and bassist Rod Demick, then joined Screaming Lord Sutch's band, known at the time as the Beautiful Quality, for six months in 1967. The following year, the pair left and recorded as the James Brothers, releasing two unsuccessful singles on the Page One label in 1968. Demick and Armstrong continued as a duo under their own names, and released several singles and two albums, Little Willy Ramble (MAM, 1971) and Lookin' Through (A&M, 1972).\n\nAfter a period living in Portugal to raise horses, Armstrong returned to Britain and joined with American songwriter and singer Kenny Young and Australian singer Noosha Fox to form the band Fox. They had several chart hits in the UK, notably \"Only You Can\" in 1974 and \"S-S-S-Single Bed\" in 1976, and released three albums, Fox in 1975, Tails of Illusion in 1975, and Blue Hotel in 1977. Armstrong co-wrote several of the album tracks with Young, who was the main songwriter.\n\nAfter Noosha left Fox, Armstrong and Young formed a new band, Yellow Dog, with guitarists Andy Roberts and Jim Gannon, bassist Gary Taylor, and drummer Gerry Conway. The band had UK chart hits with \"Just One More Night\" and \"Wait Until Midnight\" both in 1978 and released three albums, Yellow Dog in 1977, Beware of the Dog in 1978, and Strangers in Paradox in 1981.\n\nArmstrong then spent several years touring as the guitarist in Van Morrison's band, and played lead guitar on four of Morrison's albums between 1978 and 1982. In 1985 he released an album under his own name, Back Against the Wall, on the Making Waves label. He then gave up the music business for several years, and opened a restaurant, Armstrong's, in London. He later moved to Sheffield, where he ran two live venues, before another move to run a pub and live venue in the village of Rowland's Castle near Portsmouth.\n\nAfter BGT[]\n\nThe following year, he released a compilation album, Real Real Gone, including the title track, written by Morrison at the time of his album Common One, along with several other Morrison compositions, as well as several by Armstrong and other writers."
