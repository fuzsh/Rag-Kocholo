(K).\n\nUnusual for the sixties, The Meteorites started off as an all-female band. Although there were plenty of singing groups around at the time, there were very few that sang and played their own instruments. It all started when sisters Chris and Pat Wiffen, plus their friend Kathy Singelton, decided to form a group while working at the Ryvita factory in Poole. They bought their guitars, drums and amplifiers from Minns in Westbourne and practiced in a garage behind a fish & chip shop in Ringwood Road. The girls decided to call themselves The Meteorites as it sounded dynamic. Later, they added Gloria on keyboards, whose tenure was short-lived, and they found a manager in Poole based promoter and town crier Malcolm Squires. After Gloria left, Gordon Doe joined as vocalist and the band regularly played the White Buck in Burley and gained a residency at the Cuckoo Club in Bransgore, where the band lived in. In 1965 and 1966, the group took part in the ‘Bournemouth Regatta Beat Contests’, but were unplaced both times despite causing a stir because of their, unusual for the time, line-up.

They were playing in a small space next to the boiler room, when a strobe light caused a small number of over heated teenagers to collapse. Six girls and a boy were taken to hospital where they received medical attention. The story made headlines in the Bournemouth Echo and was picked up by some of the national dailies, who could hardly contain their outrage at such an event being allowed to happen. The Daily Mirror ran the headline, ‘Pop Frenzy KO’s Seven Children at a Club Dance’, with the sub-header, ‘Council to Probe Psychedelic Session’. The Daily Sketch went with, ‘Flashing Pop Lights Knock Out 12 Young Ravers’. It is said, that The Rolling Stones manager, Andrew Loog-Oldham, was so impressed with the stunt, that he offered the band a contract, as long as they wrote some original songs to record. None were forthcoming, and the idea was quietly dropped.\n\nIn 1971 Mark Eden replaced Mike Pike and The Mystic Tangent morphed into Manky Kat. There was a brief reunion in the nineties of the original line-up, but that was brought to a premature end with the untimely death of Mark Austen. Eden, Bellamy and Dashwood came together in 2022 and formed Still Breathing after a thirty year break.
