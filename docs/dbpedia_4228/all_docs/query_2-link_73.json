He is simply quite unique.\n\nHelen Theophanous, aka JazzHelen, has performed in many leading London jazz venues in recent years having studied music at Goldsmiths and the Guildhall School of Music & Drama and with award-winning Warner Brothers jazz recording artist Lea DeLaria. Half Irish and half Greek, Helen’s warm, passionate vocals can swing one minute and captivate with a gentle ballad the next.\n\nHer voice has been described by Claire Martin OBE as “Classy...stunning...with drama and presence….” “Deliciously warm vocals and terrific scatting” Cabaret Scenes. Tickets 14 in advance & £16 on the door.\n\nAlso on Sunday is the Bill Posters Band with their Yuletide Extravaganza on the evening session.\n\nWhen Three Bonzo’s & A Piano and Bill Posters Will Be Band deciding to call it a day at the end of 2014, several former members of both outfits decided to draw breath again to launch Bill Posters Band on the unsuspecting public.\n\nThus two of the illustrious Bonzo’s, Roger Ruskin-Spear, reeds & vocals, and the late great Sam Spoons, joined together with infamous ex-Bill Posters members, Mike (Megs) Etherington, cornet, vocals & assorted teapots, Chris Lowe, trombone, ukulele, percussion & vocals and Biff Harrison, banjo, accordion, saw & stravoli, whilst bringing in an exciting new talent to the line-up in the form of Jim Heath, for many years a stalwart with Harry Strutters Hot Rhythm Orchestra on banjo & guitar.\n\nAnother ‘new boy’, keyboard ace David Glasson, the pianist in 3 Bonzo’s & A Piano and a former member of Bob Kerr’s Whoopee Band has also joined the new line-up.\n\nThe band will be playing some of the Bonzo’s repertoire that we all love and some favourites that Bill Posters have become famous for, as well as new material to create an unusual musical slant on the wild and zany show that made both bands so popular over the years. 7.30pm Tickets £13 in advance and £15 on the door."
