His Mixed Signals Music company is also involved in throwing these parties.\n\nWHAT\n\n“Raw, deep house music with an edge. I try to steer away from the fluffy stuff.”\n\nWHY\n\n“Back in the day we would all buy records and play around on the turntables at my boy Sean’s house. I inherited the tables and was hooked from day one.”\n\nMOST MEMORABLE MOMENT\n\n“One of the most recent highlights was opening up for the legendary Tony Humphries for our first Long Weekend Legends event in 2006. That was when I first witnessed the house scene making a comeback to proper clubs in Toronto.”"
