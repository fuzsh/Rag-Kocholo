        "text": "Iain Matthews generally is unassuming about his role in pop-rock music history.\n\n“I am a forward-thinking person,” Matthews said. “I don’t think in terms of legacy. People tell me I do have one. I’m constantly surprised when someone knows the small details of my life. Or even recognizes me. I don’t think about it.”\n\nOthers do. Matthews, 70, emerged from the late-1960s British folk-rock era with Fairport Convention and Matthews’ Southern Comfort.\n\nThe singer, songwriter and guitar player still amplifies his history as a solo performer and in Plainsong, either a duo — with boyhood friend Andy Roberts, 70 — or a trio. He’s planning a Matthews’ Southern Comfort (1969-72) reboot this year.\n\nHe and Roberts, who plays guitar and mandolin, return tonight to Stockton for a 60-minute show at The Haggin Museum, where they performed on Nov. 19, 2015.\n\nMatthews — at someone else’s suggestion — now is revisiting his 51-year career by crafting “memento boxes” from vintage photographs; newspaper and magazine clippings; show tickets; posters; backstage passes and other memorabilia (iainmatthews.nl/mementoboxes).\n\n“Only stuff I have doubles of,” he said from Berkeley, where Plainsong played a Sunday house concert. “I personalize them. I had to do something with so much stuff. When I’m finished, I varnish them. It’s pretty cool.\"\n\n\"She (Trudi) said ‘You should do more,’ ” Matthews said of a bar owner in Wegwijzser, near his home in The Netherlands, where he’s lived for 18 years. She suggested the idea. “ ‘This is far more than we expected. Way more than anyone else has done.’ ”\n\nHe’s assembled a “half-dozen” boxes and is “making ones for specific periods.” Matthews lets people pick their price. He’s suggested $1,000, topping out at $750: “It comes with a little card of authenticity.”\n\nThat’s largely a result of his fledgling membership (1967-69) in Fairport Convention, a revered British folk-rock band that has included Richard Thompson, now 68, Sandy Denny (1947-78) and dozens of others in its 44 years.\n\nHe’s also dedicated to the music and life of Richard Fariña (1937-66). The Brooklyn, New York, singer-songwriter and author didn't reach the apex of success in the ’60s Greenwich Village folk-music firmament.\n\nMatthews still performs Fariña’s “Reno, Nevada” (1965), the first Fariña song he recorded.\n\n“Initially, the lyrical content is kind of obtuse,” said Matthews, who released the 15-track “Reinventing Richard: the Songs of Richard Fariña” in 2015. “I like the way he spreads things. He’s ultra-political one minute and poking fun at himself in the next song. He’s always very literary.”\n\nUnlike Bob Dylan, now 75; Phil Ochs (1940-76); Eric Andersen, 74; Joan Baez, 76; Tom Paxton, 79, and others, Fariña — who sang in a marital duo with Baez’s sister Mimi (1945-2001) — never achieved wide acceptance. “Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me” (1966), his Jack Kerouac-influenced novel, hasn’t eluded its “mediocre” critical label.\n\nFariña died in an April 30, 1966, crash while riding as a motorcycle passenger on Carmel Valley Road — two days before his book was published.\n\n“I just read it again,” said Matthews, who’s released 48 recordings — in many configurations on nine labels — since 1967. “I still don’t really understand it.”\n\nFariña was politically active and wrote “protest” songs in the Jim Crow/Cuban missile crisis/Vietnam War age.\n\n“I don’t see too many stepping up and writing about things now,” said Matthews, a native of Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, England. “Maybe it’s just a sign of the times. (Fariña’s book) is based on cultural clashes.\n\n“I’m doing my bit. I think it (’60s music and political activism) had a significant impact. It’s eroded with time. It’s almost like everybody talks about it. But isn't doing so much. Maybe it’s a reflection on the computer-iPhone generation. Who’s gonna call this guy (the U.S. president) up on the carpet?”\n\nWhile Matthews seems ambivalent about his status in music history, he’s determined to ensure Fariña’s.\n\n“At the time, he wasn’t left out,” Matthew said. “It was a brief period. A small window. It was gone by April ’66. Another year and he would have broken out. ... It sort of exploded a year later. He would have made it.\n\n“His catalog kind of got left by the wayside. He did wonderful work. Maybe it’s because he played dulcimer. ‘Reno, Nevada’ barely has left my repertoire. Duo or trio, it’s usually there.”\n\nSo is Matthews Southern Comfort, which initially included members of Fairport Convention.\n\nThe first reunion was “quite short-lived,” said Matthews, a former Los Angeles and Seattle resident who lives in the southern Netherlands. “Very refreshing. Quite rewarding. It’s a little eroded. But, with time, it can be rebuilt to an extent.”\n\n— Contact Tony Sauro at (209) 546-8267 or tsauro@recordnet.com.
