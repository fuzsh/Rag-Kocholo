        "text": "Andy Roberts\n\nThere is an illuminating interview with the great bowler in the current edition of the Cricketer. Two things stood out for me. Firstly he was asked whether he ever encountered racism in Britain and he replied\n\n“In my first few years as an overseas player at Hampshire (1973-1975) I never even thought I was black – nobody said anything about my colour”.\n\nBut he added that he first encountered it touring here with the West Indians in 1976 when, he said, “the floodgates opened” and “all of these racist letters and notes started turning up” – apparently even before Tony Greig’s comments about making the tourists grovel.\n\nSecondly he spoke about how his action in the early days of county cricket had low arms “coming across my body” when he said “I used to bowl genuinely fast” and thinks he “could have bowled as fast as anyone has ever bowled”. I enjoyed reading that because despite the year-on-year magnificence of Malcolm Marshall I am convinced that Andy Roberts in 1974 bowled as fast (and brilliantly) as anyone I’ve ever seen. He was fearsome.\n\n5 Comments"
