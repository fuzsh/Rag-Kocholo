This international and innovative Master's programme in the Religious Roots of Europe (RRE) gives students a unique opportunity to explore the three major European religions - Christianity, Judaism and Islam - and the impact of these religions on European culture and society.

The importance of expertise in religion and in its role in society and culture is increasingly recognised. As a graduate of this programme you will be qualified for scholarly work, e.g. in PhD-programmes, as well as for teaching. You will also be able to enter into specialised occupations in government institutions or organisations dealing with culture, integration, diplomacy etc. and in private companies with business relations with e.g. the Middle East.
