        "text": "Overview\n\nThe UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020. Free movement between the UK and the European Union ended on 31 December 2020 and on 1 January 2021, the UK implemented a points-based immigration system that prioritises skills and talent over where a person comes from.\n\nIf you were not resident in the UK by 31 December 2020 and do not have rights under the withdrawal agreement, you need to meet specific requirements in order to work or study in the UK from 1 January 2021. You also need to pass relevant checks, including UK criminality checks. You can continue to visit the UK for up to 6 months without applying for a visa and may participate in a wide range of activities, including tourism, visiting family and friends, short term study, attend job interviews and other business-related activities, such as events and conferences.\n\nIrish citizens’ status continues to be protected as part of Common Travel Area arrangements. Therefore, Irish citizens do not require permission to come to the UK (except in a very limited number of circumstances), and as a result, are not eligible to apply under the new points-based immigration system.\n\nSpecific guidance for those looking to visit, work or study in the UK can be found under documents, along with application guidance.\n\nEU Settlement Scheme\n\nBefore you apply to work or study in the UK under the points-based immigration system, you should check if you’re eligible for the EU Settlement Scheme.\n\nApplying through the points-based immigration system\n\nYou should begin your application on GOV.UK and you will need to demonstrate that you meet the relevant criteria and score the number of points required for the visa you’re applying for.\n\nAs part of your application, you will need to verify your identity. Most people will be able to do this using a smartphone, through the ‘UK Immigration: ID Check’ app, as part of the online application. Those who cannot use the ‘UK Immigration: ID Check’ app will need to attend a Visa Application Centre.\n\nYou will need to pay an application fee and, if you are coming to the UK for more than 6 months, you may have to pay the Immigration Health Surcharge, which will enable you to access the UK’s National Health Service (NHS).\n\nThe processing times for applications vary depending on the visa you are applying for and the service available. You must apply and receive confirmation that you have been successful before you travel to the UK.\n\nYou will have created a UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) account when you applied for a visa using the ID Check app, or to the EU Settlement Scheme. You will use your UKVI account credentials to sign in to the View and Prove service on GOV.UK, which is where you can access your immigration status (eVisa). For more information read the immigration status guidance.\n\nTravelling to the UK\n\nWhen making your journey to the UK, you will need to travel with the same document you made your application with. For example, if you use your biometric passport to apply, you will need to travel using this.\n\nYou will not be able to use an EU, EEA or Swiss national ID card to enter the UK from 1 October 2021 unless you:\n\nhave settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme\n\napplied to the EU Settlement Scheme by 30 June 2021 but have not received a decision yet\n\nhave an EU Settlement Scheme family permit\n\nhave a frontier worker permit\n\nare an S2 Healthcare Visitor\n\nare a Swiss national and have a Service Provider from Switzerland visa\n\nIn these cases, you can continue to use your national ID card to enter the UK until at least 31 December 2025.\n\nWorking in the UK\n\nRight to work\n\nLearn more about your right to work in the UK as an EU, EEA or Swiss citizen.\n\nSkilled Worker visa\n\nTo be eligible for this visa, you must demonstrate:\n\nyou have a job offer from a Home Office-licensed sponsor at the required skill level\n\nyou will be paid the relevant minimum salary threshold by your sponsor (normally £26,500 or the going rate for their particular job, whichever is higher)\n\nyou can speak English at the intermediate level at B1 (on the Common European Framework of Reference for languages)\n\nApply for a Skilled Worker visa.\n\nSkilled Work: Health and Care visa\n\nIf you work in an eligible health occupation and have a job offer from the NHS, social care sector or employers and organisations which provide services to the NHS, are able to speak English and meet the requirements of the Skilled Worker route, you can apply for the Health and Care visa to come to the UK with your family.\n\nThere is fast-track entry, with reduced application fees and dedicated support through the application process. If you’re eligible to apply for the Health and Care visa, you will also be exempt from having to pay the Immigration Health Surcharge. Frontline workers in the health and social care sector who are not eligible to apply for the Health and Care visa will have to pay the Immigration Health Surcharge and could benefit from a reimbursement scheme where they will be repaid.\n\nApply for a Health and Care visa.\n\nGlobal Talent\n\nThe Global Talent visa allows the most highly skilled to come to the UK without a job offer. This visa caters for recognised global leaders, and the leaders of tomorrow in science, humanities, engineering, the arts (including film, fashion design and architecture) and digital technology, with individuals’ unique skills enriching the UK’s knowledge, economy and society. Top scientists and researchers benefit from a quicker endorsement process as part of a fast track STEM scheme.\n\nApply for a Global Talent visa.\n\nAlternative work visa routes and specialist occupations\n\nThere are a range of other visa routes available for working in the UK, such as the Start-up and Innovator visas. There are also visa routes for further specialist occupations, including ministers of religion, sportspeople and creatives.\n\nStudying in the UK\n\nStudent visa\n\nTo be eligible for the Student visa, you will need to demonstrate:\n\nyou have been offered a place on a course by a Home Office-licensed Student sponsor\n\nyou can speak, read, write and understand English\n\nyou have enough money to support yourself and pay for your course\n\nyou genuinely intend to study in the UK\n\nThere is a separate Child Student visa for child students aged between 4 to 17 years old who wish to study at an independent school.\n\nApply for a Student visa.\n\nGraduate visa\n\nIf you successfully complete a degree at undergraduate level or above in the UK, you can apply for a Graduate visa to stay and work, or look for work, for a maximum period of 2 years (3 years for doctoral students) after completing your studies.\n\nApply for a Graduate visa\n\nCheck if you will need a UK visa.\n\nDocuments\n\nThe UK's points-based immigration system: an introduction for EU citizens\n\nPDF, 336 KB, 8 pages\n\nThis file may not be suitable for users of assistive technology.\n\nRequest an accessible format.\n\nIf you use assistive technology (such as a screen reader) and need a version of this document in a more accessible format, please email alternativeformats@homeoffice.gov.uk.
