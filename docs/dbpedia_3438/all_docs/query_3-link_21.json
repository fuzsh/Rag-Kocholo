        "text": "The programme prepares students for educational and social work in a multi-religious society or for research on the role of the three religions in European history and society. Through the programme students acquire detailed knowledge about the formation of the three religions and their interaction with one another, as well as skills relevant for any occupation or study where the role of the three religions is of importance.\n\nThe programme is unique in its focus on the formation of all three religions in a comparative perspective. As a joint Nordic programme it gives students access to professors and research at three different universities, as well as to the Nordic institutes in Rome, which are associated to the programme. Lund University, as well as its partners, is internationally recognised for its research in the field of study. The use of e-learning, local tutorials and joint Nordic compact seminars provides a unique combination of campus studies and exchange with students based at other universities.\n\nEven if the programme uses e-teaching, the whole programme cannot be studied from a distance. Participation in Nordic compact seminars is part of the programme, and also local tutorials.\n\nCareer prospects\n\nThe formation of multi-religious societies in Europe and the increasing role of religion today create a need for individuals with an in-depth knowledge of the formation and history of religions, especially Judaism, Christianity and Islam, as well as a need for future research in the field. A graduate from this programme will be able to enter into specialised occupations in government institutions or organisations dealing with culture, integration or diplomacy and in private firms, for example with business relations with the Middle East. The programme also provides an excellent basis for PhD studies."
