        "text": "Jacques Delors' unparalleled talent and unwavering willpower left a permanent mark on the very fabric of the European Union.\n\nFrom 1985 to 1995 as President of the European Commission, Jacques Delors was the visionary architect who laid the foundations and sowed the seeds of some of the most outstanding achievements of the European project.\n\nHis 10-year tenure was not just a chapter; it was an epoch of profound change, which has left a lasting imprint on the European Union as we know it today.\n\nThree decades on, Delors' legacy continues to echo in European history.\n\nA profound legacy of unity\n\nWhen Jacques Delors became President of the European Commission, he was faced with a continent in the grip of crisis. A prevailing sense of pessimism dominated European economics, casting doubts over the very foundations of the European project. The fall of the Berlin Wall, the reunification of Germany, the collapse of the USSR and the wars in former Yugoslavia, marked an era of tumultuous transformation.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Delors' leadership emerged as a beacon of resilience. His decisive actions forged a path towards unity.\n\nBy the culmination of his third term as President of the European Commission in 1995, the European Union stood more resilient, fairer, stronger, and more tightly woven than ever before.\n\nHe was among the creators of the Schengen area, which today allows more than 400 million people to travel freely between member countries without going through border controls.\n\nIt is thanks to him that we now have our beloved Erasmus EU student exchange programme, which has become one of the most emblematic brands of the EU."
