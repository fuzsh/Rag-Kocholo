        "text": "Every product exported from or imported into the EU is classified under a tariff code. The classification helps you understand which conditions and tariffs apply to your specific product. The tariff code, also called product code, provides information on\n\nthe duty rates and other levies that apply to the product\n\nany applicable protective measures (e.g. anti-dumping)\n\nimport and export formalities and other non-tariff requirements (health certificates, quality controls, CE marking, etc.)\n\nThe global classification system is called the Harmonised System (HS). It is an arrangement developed by the World Customs Organisation (WCO), comprising about 5,000 commodity groups. It is organised in a hierarchical structure by\n\nsection\n\nchapter (2 digits)\n\nheadings (4 digits)\n\nsub-headings (6 digits)\n\nIt is supported by interpretation rules and explanatory notes. The World Customs Organisation (WCO) provides a list of countries applying the Harmonised System."
