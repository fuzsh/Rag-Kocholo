        "text": "Summary of Northern European Renaissance\n\nWhile Italy was witnessing the revival of classical antiquity and the development of humanism in the 15th century, Northern Europe (present day Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and France) similarly experienced a flourishing of artistic production.\n\nThe Northern Renaissance has its roots in the Gothic tradition and the lavish court art sponsored by the dukes of Burgundy, who controlled regions of present-day France and the Low Countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg). In the 1420s, artists from these areas began to create oil paintings that were remarkable for their illusionism and naturalistic representation.\n\nIn the following century, the Protestant Reformation greatly influenced the production of art. With its rejection of certain types of religious images, the Reformation inspired artists to develop new genres of artwork that depicted elements of daily life. While artistic patronage had traditionally been centered around the Church and aristocracy, the rising merchant class began to play an important role in art production in the North, especially with the growth of urban centers and the development of a robust art market.\n\nKey Ideas & Accomplishments\n\nDuring the Northern Renaissance, artists such as Jan van Eyck and Robert Campin developed and perfected the medium of oil painting, which was used to produce altarpieces, devotional works, and portraits. Their paintings, as well as those by Rogier van der Weyden, Hans Memling, and Gerard David, are remarkable for their illusionism, attention to detail, and emphasis on materiality.\n\nDuring the late 15th and early 16th centuries, Northern artists, many of whom traveled to Italy, created paintings that, for the first time, combined regional traditions with elements taken from the Italian Renaissance, such as architectural forms and imagery from classical antiquity. In doing so, these artists created completely new, hybrid painting styles that helped spread Italian Renaissance culture throughout Northern Europe.\n\nThe Protestant Reformation not only addressed the vices and corruption of the Catholic Church, but also promoted man's ability to maintain a direct connection with God through prayer and scripture, without mediation from the church. The Reformation had a major influence on the arts, as artists adapted their subject matter and styles to match new theological attitudes towards religious images.\n\nThe growing popularity of printmaking in Northern Europe allowed images to be mass-produced and widely available to the public. With the invention of the printing press, Protestant reformers were able to bring theology to the people through books and pamphlets on a large scale; in many instances, artists collaborated with authors and publishers to illustrate these printed books.\n\nNorthern European artists began to explore new genres of paintings that emphasized scenes and subjects from daily life, many of which were given a moralizing undertone. These new categories of painting included landscape, portrait, animal, still life, and scenes of everyday life (also known as genre painting).\n\nArtworks and Artists of Northern European Renaissance\n\nBeginnings of Northern European Renaissance\n\nThe Italian Renaissance and the Gothic Tradition\n\nThe artworks of the Italian Renaissance and the Northern European Renaissance were very different in style and visual sensibility. During the 15th century, Italian artists were deeply inspired by the rediscovery of ancient Greek and Roman learning and art. They actively sought to incorporate elements of classical aesthetics, which focused on harmony and idealized form, into their works of art and architecture.\n\nMeanwhile, in Northern Europe, artists drew from a pre-existing Gothic tradition of painting and manuscript illumination. Developing the medium of oil paint, they created highly detailed altarpieces and panel paintings for churches and chapels that were in line with the aesthetics of Devotio Moderna, a late medieval religious movement that emphasized empathetic piety, where worshippers could see the divine in the everyday; the realism and illusionism in works by artists such Jan van Eyck brought the divine into daily life and allowed viewers to directly identify with religious figures.\n\nThe Burgundian Court\n\nDuring the 15th century, the dukes of Burgundy ruled large territories across Northern Europe that included parts of present-day France (the region known as Burgundy), Luxembourg, Belgium, and Holland. Due to the wealth and political power of the dukes, the Burgundian court was one of the most important sites of artistic production in Northern Europe. Because Burgundian court was itinerant, there was with no fixed capital; instead, the dukes maintained various courts throughout their territories and thus stimulated artistic production throughout the region. Within these ducal holdings, major trade cities in the Low Countries such as Bruges and Brussels served as particularly important artistic hubs and favored destinations for the dukes.\n\nThe Burgundian dukes believed that patronage of the arts was crucial to demonstrating princely magnificence and power. The variety of artistic production at the court was stunning, as the dukes commissioned artworks across a wide range of media, including tapestry, goldwork, sculpture, illuminated manuscripts, and painting. While some of these artworks drew from older, pre-existing Gothic traditions, such as the production of lavishly illustrated books of hours, other works, such as paintings featuring nude figures and mythological subject matter, turned to newer trends from Italy. Naturally, talented artists such as Jan van Eyck were drawn to the court, which served as model of artistic patronage for other rulers across Europe. Burgundian prominence in the arts would last until 1477, when the duchy of Burgundy reverted to France and the Low Countries were ceded to the Holy Roman Empire through the marriage of Mary of Burgundy to the future Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I.\n\nIlluminated Manuscripts and the Limbourg Brothers\n\nThe International Gothic style of manuscript illumination represented the pinnacle of a long tradition. During the medieval period most books had been rare manuscripts, made by hand with vellum pages that contained brightly inked illustrations accentuated with gold and silver, which appeared \"illuminated.\" Made by monks in scriptoriums, these manuscripts were primarily religious, including Bibles like the noted The Book of DurrowÂ (650-700) or The Book of Kells (c. 800). Later volumes included bestiaries like The Westminster Abbey BestiaryÂ (c. 1275-90), drawing upon classical Greek and Biblical accounts of fantastic beasts, or books of prayer like The Book of Hours of Jeanne dâEvreux (c. 1324-28).\n\nThe International Gothic style was exemplified by the Dutch miniaturist brothers Herman, Paul, and Johan Limbourg who became renowned for their TrÃ¨s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry (c. 1412-16), an illuminated book of prayers to be said during the canonical hours. It was one of the earliest illuminated manuscripts made by known artists rather than monks. Scenes of contemporary life dominated the work of 130 illustrations, half of which were miniatures depicting scenes of court life, agricultural labor, and military expeditions, rendered in jewel-like colors.\n\nTapestry in the North\n\nTapestry was an important form of artistic production in Northern Europe, particularly in Northern France and the Low Countries. Aside from their decorative purposesâused to adorn the walls of castles and churchesâtapestries were mobile, so they could be easily transported, and provided additional insulation from the elements. Tapestries were traditionally valued over painting during the Northern Renaissance as they used costly materials, such as dyed wool, silk, and gilt metallic thread, as well as a great amount of labor. To make a tapestry, an initial design, called a âcartoonâ would be created by an artist. This design would then be taken to a workshop, where it would be woven by hand on a loom. During the 15th and 16th centuries, workshops in Northern Europe produced numerous tapestries that were exported across Europe.\n\nTapestries from the 15th century often depicted biblical, historical, or hunt scenes and featured complex narratives and iconography. Stylistically, these works, drawing from Gothic tradition, emphasized pattern and line, rather than volume in the rendering of figures and spaces. Famous examples of these late-Gothic tapestries include the famous Lady and the Unicorn series that were designed in Paris and woven in Flanders, c. 1500, in the mille-fleurs or âthousand flowersâ style. However, artists began to introduce forms and subject matter from the Italian Renaissance in the 16th century. For example, Bernard van Orleyâs Hunts of Maximilian, a set of twelve tapestries made for the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I made c. 1528-33, created a new style of tapestry that incorporated Italianate elements such as the use of perspective and a volumetric rendering of his figures.\n\nJan van Eyck and Robert Campin: Early Northern Renaissance Oil Painting\n\nThe artists Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck played important roles developing the detailed and illusionistic style of oil painting that would characterize Northern Renaissance art during the 15th century. Their work, drawing from late Gothic styles and art from the Burgundian court, was also influenced by the Devotio Moderna movement, which emphasized empathetic piety and the emotional response of the viewer; the emphasis on detail and realism in their paintings served in part to heighten the emotional impact of their works. The style developed by van Eyck and Campin was extremely influential until the end of the 15th and early 16th centuries, when a new generation of artists would incorporate traditional styles with elements taken from Italy, such as the introduction of classical motifs and depictions of the nude body.\n\nInfluenced by the Limbourg brothers, Robert Campin pioneered the use of oil painting that characterized the North European Renaissance. Only a handful of works can be certainly attributed to him, as he seldom signed his work, a common practice in the Middle Ages. As subsequent scholarship has identified him as the Master of FlÃ©malle, his masterwork is considered to be the MÃ©rode Altarpiece (1427). Like most International Gothic artists, he primarily painted religious subjects but his contemporary settings depicting ordinary activities, simultaneously accurate in observation and symbolic in meaning, initiated the Renaissance approach. Rogier van der Weyden, an important artist, was first trained in his workshop.\n\nJan van Eyck, who was Campinâs contemporary, so mastered oil painting that historian Giorgio Vasari was to erroneously credit him with the invention of the medium. Little is known of van Eyck's training or artistic background, as he first appears in records in 1422 as a painter for John III the Pitiless, ruler of Holland. We do know that van Eyck was versed in Greek and Latin, the mark of the educated class. Subsequently, he became the court painter for Philip, Duke of Burgundy until 1429. His pioneering masterpiece The Ghent Altarpiece (1431) launched the Renaissance in Northern Europe with its oil painting and realism. Subsequently he pioneered both self-portraiture with Portrait of a Man (1433) and portraiture with his Arnolfini Portrait (1434). His technique and style influenced his contemporaries Petrus Christus, Hans Memling, and van der Weyden.\n\nVan Eyck was the only 15th-century Northern European artist to sign his works. He sometimes used the phrase \"I Jan van Eyck was here,\" but more often used his motto \"ALS IK KAN,\" meaning \"As I can,\" a pun upon his name and the Dutch word for art. His motto, like that of the Italian Renaissance architect Leon Battista Alberti's, \"A man can do all things if he will,\" reflected a distinctly Renaissance view of the artist as a divinely inspired genius.\n\nThe Printing Press and Print Making\n\nThe advent of the printing press, invented by Johannes Gutenberg c. 1440, made sacred texts accessible to any literate individual, and allowed intellectuals to publish their own writing. Printing had a revolutionary impact on the era but particularly in Northern Europe. Gutenberg's BibleÂ (1455), the first German version, made the sacred text widely available, and, though printed in Latin, translations into English and German followed in the 1520's. The new accessibility of the text corresponded with rising Protestant belief that an individual could have a personal relationship with God, without need of a mediating Pope or priest. Many of the first books were religious texts, often illustrated by Northern artists.\n\nAside from the development of the printing press, the Northern Renaissance also witnessed the development of print making. Engravings were first produced in Germany in the 1430s, but would become a major artistic medium after 1470, when artists such as Martin Schongauer, a goldsmith and printmaker, and later, Albrecht DÃ¼rer helped develop engraving as a major art form. In addition to the rising popularity of engraving, the technique of etching was developed in Germany around 1500. While less popular than engraving, many artists nonetheless experimented with the medium, especially those from the Danube School in Germany or School of Fontainebleau in France.\n\nWith the growing popularity of printed media, artists began to make individual prints, as well as series of prints, for the art market. These included both secular and religious content, sometimes derived from pre-existing designs, such as paintings, but often were created explicitly as prints. Northern Europe, particularly Antwerp, served as an important hub of print production. The establishment of printing houses, such as Aux Quatre Vents run by Hieronymus Cock, allowed for the mass production, publication, and dissemination of printed artworks. As an early form of mass-media, prints thus served as an important way to spread knowledge and new artistic styles across not only Europe, but also across the globe.\n\nGerman Renaissance and Albrecht DÃ¼rer\n\nDuring the late 15th century, Germany emerged as an important region for artistic production, as artists developed unique regional styles that drew from both the Low Countries and Italy, but also incorporated local traditions.\n\nAlbrecht DÃ¼rer, a master printmaker, draughtsman and painter, is the most notable artist of the German Renaissance. The artist made two trips to Italy, the first in 1494, and the second in 1505; he played a major role bringing styles and imagery from the Italian Renaissance to the North. DÃ¼rerâs work reflects a deep engagement with the philosophical and artistic currents of Renaissance Italy and Venice, as seen in his altarpiece Feast of the Rose Garlands (1506), which reflects his interest in Venetian color. His engravings such as Adam and Eve (1504) also reflect the Italian humanist celebration of the ideal human form and draw from classical models. DÃ¼rer was interested in humanist philosophy and maintained a lifelong friendship with the German humanist Conrad Celtis, who promoted a study of German antiquity. DÃ¼rer's Four Books of Human Proportion (1532) and his work of geometric theory, Underweysung der Messung (1525), were the first such works by an artist from Northern Europe and included a scientific discussion of perspective.\n\nWhile DÃ¼rer engaged directly with antiquity and Italian Renaissance ideas, other German artists, such as Matthias GrÃ¼newald, worked in style derived from late Gothic painting but included contemporary technical advances in oil painting to create vivid and expressive forms. His Isenheim Altarpiece (1512-16), made for the Monastery of St. Anthony, illustrates how traditional styles continued to flourish in Germany well into the 16th century.\n\nGerman artists also contributed to the development of landscape as a genre. Albrecht Altdorfer, who worked in the imperial city of Regensburg, was part of a group of artists known today as the Danube School. He and his colleagues, such as Wolf Huber, created paintings and prints depicting the local forests and countryside. For example, in Altdorferâs Saint George (1510), the dense, leafy forest plays a prominent role in the composition, while the religious scene is almost secondary. Altdorfer also had important imperial patrons; his large-format painting Battle of Alexander at Issus (1529), which features a chaotic scene of warfare against the backdrop of craggy mountains and a distant landscape, was made for William IV, Duke of Bavaria.\n\nArtists of the German Renaissance were deeply affected by the Reformation. Lucas Cranach the Elder was another artist who engaged with antiquity and new ideas from the Italian Renaissance. For example, many of his works made for aristocratic patrons depict subject matter from classical mythology and prominently feature nudes, such as his painting Apollo and Diana (1530). But with the spread of Lutheranism, Cranach began to produce portraits of Martin Luther and other Protestant leaders. He also developed new religious subject matter that followed Lutherâs guidance on images, such as his painting Law and Gospel (ca. 1529). Hans Holbein the Younger was another noted artist whose career was directly impacted by the Reformation. In 1526, he left the city of Basel, where he produced his iconic Dance of Death woodcut series (c. 1526), due to the iconoclastic religious climate. He traveled to England, where he worked primarily as a portraitist. Although he would return to Basel, he eventually settled in England, where he worked at the court of Henry VIII and produced major works such as The Ambassadors (1533).\n\nPatronage of the Merchant Class\n\nUnlike the Italian Renaissance where a few wealthy patrons, like the ruling Medici family in Florence or the Pope in Rome, commissioned most of the era's major artistic works, the Northern Renaissance primarily produced art for a prosperous merchant class. The growth of urban centers, such as Antwerp, led to the development of art markets where prints, portraits, and paintings, all of which could be displayed in private homes, were sold to great demand. While some artists, such as van Eyck or DÃ¼rer, worked for princely patrons, they also derived much of their income from wealthy bourgeois clients and reached much broader public audience than their Italian counterparts.\n\nThe Protestant Reformation\n\nIn 1517, Martin Luther wrote the Ninety-Five Theses, which attacked the excesses and corruption of the Roman Catholic Church. His publication sparked the Protestant Reformation, which promoted a new interpretation of Christianity that was focused on scripture and faith alone and no longer required the mediation of the Church. While the Reformation began in Germany, it quickly spread throughout Northern Europe. Many regions witnessed conflict between Protestants and Catholics, especially as regional rulers either adopted Protestantism or stood in defense of the Catholic Church.\n\nNaturally, the Reformation deeply influenced the production of artwork across Europe. Certain regions experienced iconoclasm, where Protestants destroyed religious artworks that were deemed as idolatrous, such as portraits of saints. Artists were thus forced to negotiate the tumult of the period with various strategies, such as developing new, secular types of painting, which included scenes of daily life or still-lifes, or focusing on Protestant subject matter. For example, Lucas Cranach the Elder worked closely with the main figures of the Reformation to create new works. He produced portraits of Martin Luther, with whom he was friends, as well as scenes Protestant religious themes, such as âChrist Blessing the Children.â His art, which pointed out the failings and flaws of human behavior, was received favorably by both the Protestant public and the movement's leaders.\n\nConcepts and Styles\n\nNorthern Renaissance Humanism\n\nWhile Italian humanism focused on the study of classical Greek and Roman texts and emphasized individual man's importance in the world,Â Northern European humanism was primarily Christian in nature; it applied the methods used to study the classics to the analytical study of the bible and emphasized the foundations for leading a Christian life. The development of the printing press allowed for the wide dissemination of works by leading thinkers such as the Desiderius Erasmus, a classical scholar and Catholic priest known for his views of religion and new translations from Greek and Latin of New Testament, and Conrad Celtis, a poet, scholar, and historian who stimulated classical learning in Germany and promoted the study of German antiquity.\n\nHumanism played a major role in shaping artistic production in the North, as artists themselves studied humanist literature and created works for educated patrons who valued humanistic erudition. For example, Erasmusâs humanistic texts influenced artists such as Pieter Bruegel, whose print series The Seven Virtues (1559-60) was inspired by Erasmusâs Enchiridion (1501). Erasmus also maintained personal connections with important artists of the day, such as Quentyn Massys, Albrecht DÃ¼rer, and Hans Holbein the Younger, who painted portraits of him. Celtis had a strong influence on German artists, especially Albrecht DÃ¼rer, a lifelong friend and working colleague. Together, they produced works such as the illustrated Quatuor Libri Amorum (1502), which feature woodcuts by DÃ¼rer.\n\nExchange Between the North and South\n\nDuring the early 15th century, artists in Northern Europe developed regional styles that drew from the Gothic tradition and Burgundian court culture. At the same time, artists in Italy developed distinctive styles and subject matter based on the rediscovery of antiquity. However, there was also extensive artistic and economic exchange between Northern Europe and Italy during this period. Oil paint, which was developed in the North and was closely associated with artists such as van Eyck, slowly began to replace tempera as the medium of choice for artists in Italy. Works such as the Portinari Altarpiece (c. 1475-78), which was made in Florence by the Flemish painter Hugo van der Goes, further highlight the artistic connections between the two regions.\n\nBy the late 15th century, it was common for artists from the North, such as Albrecht DÃ¼rer, to travel to Italy to study the works of antiquity and the different regional styles. In the Low Countries, a group of artists, which included Jan Gossaert, Maarten van Heemskerck and Pieter Coecke van Aelst, were known as the âRomanistsâ for their introduction of classicizing motifs and Italianate forms; their unique blending of Northern and Italian motifs created a new type of painting, which by the 1520s would replace the older styles first developed by van Eyck and Campin. In France, King Francis I was so enamored by Italian art that he invited the artists Rosso Fiorentino and Benvenuto Cellini to his court, where they would work with Flemish and native French artists to design royal works of art.\n\nAltarpieces and Devotional Works\n\nAltarpieces were some of the most important types of artwork created during the Northern Renaissance. They were commonly created in a multiple-panel format known as a diptych (altarpieces with two panels), triptych (with three panels) or polyptych (with four or more panels) so that the side panels could be folded inward, essentially covering the paintings of the inner panels. While the outer panels would often be painted with simpler imagery, often in grisaille, the main inner panels featured detailed and lavishly painted religious scenes. Triptychs and polyptychs would usually be stored closed, with the inner scenes covered, but then opened for Mass and other special occasions, such as Saintâs Day celebrations.\n\nArtists including Hans Baldung Grien, Dierec Bouts, Hugo van der Goes, Hans Memling, Rogier van der Weyden, Jan van Eyck, and Matthias GrÃ¼newald executed their most noted works as large-scale altarpieces. Most of these works were commissioned for or by monasteries or churches. In some altarpieces, portraits of the donors were also included, as seen in Hugo van der Goes's Portinari Altarpiece (c. 1475), Portrait of Tommaso Portinari (c 1470), and Portrait of Maria Portinari, (c. 1470-72).\n\nWhile these large altarpieces were destined for semi-public spaces such as churches or aristocratic chapels, artists also made works for private devotion. These were much smaller in size, often portable in nature, and came in a variety of formats, including single panels, diptychs or triptychs, such as Jan van Eyckâs beautifully painted Dresden Triptych (1437). These paintings, which were commissioned for the homes of wealthy members of the banking or merchant classes, were intended to encourage private prayer and contemplation in daily life. Like the larger altarpieces of the period, many of these devotional works feature portraits of the donor, such as Hans Memlings Diptych of Maarten van Nieuwenhove (1487).\n\nThe Rise of Printmaking\n\nThe Northern Renaissance is particularly noted for its rich production of printsâwoodcuts, engravings, and etchings. Because of its reproducibility and small format, print was able to reach broader audiences and thus, served as an important medium for the spread of artistic ideas and imagery. Notable artists such as Martin Schongauer, Pieter Bruegel, Hans Holbein the Elder, Lucas Cranach the Elder, and Albrecht DÃ¼rer understood the power of printmaking and produced numerous original designs specifically for the medium.\n\nMartin Schongauer was the most important Northern printmaker before DÃ¼rer. Originally trained as a painter, Schongauer created engravings primarily of religious scenes, such as his Temptation of St. Anthony (1470-75), but also peasant life and ornament designs. Schongauer is credited as one of the first artists to have perfected the technique of engraving, which had originally been developed by goldsmiths, and his prints are noted for their complexity of detail, attention to realism, and textural variety.\n\nDÃ¼rer, a master of both woodcut and engraving, revolutionized the potential of printmaking as an independent medium for art, developing its dramatic and tonal capabilities, and exploring new imagery. His various woodcut series like The Apocalypse (1498) and the Large Woodcut Passion (c. 1497-1500), based on religious narratives, launched his fame throughout Europe. Subsequently, he made individual prints like his engraving Adam and Eve (1504) and series of images called his Meisterstiche (master engravings) that included prints such The Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513). As art historian Jacob Wisse noted of his prints, \"Their technical virtuosity, intellectual scope, and psychological depth were unmatched by earlier printed work.\"\n\nBruegel came from a family of four generations of printmakers and artists, and from 1555 to 1562, worked primarily with Aux Quatre Vents (At the Four Winds), an Antwerp publishing house. He designed engravings that often translated proverbs, morals, and parables into contemporary scenes, as seen in his engraving Big Fish Eat Little Fish (1557). Visual treatments of proverbs had been popular, dating back to early 15th century books of the hours. Often the interest in proverbs combined an appreciation of the common sense of the people of Northern Europe with moralistic purpose.\n\nHans Holbein the Younger's work often served a moralistic purpose as well, as seen in his famous series of woodcuts, The Dance of Death (1526), depicting Death's arrival in various scenes where ordinary people are engaged in everyday activities. Such works served as memento mori, reminders of mortality, urging people to live a virtuous life.\n\nCranach the Elder, closely associated with the Protestant Reformation due to his close friendship with Martin Luther, created prints portraying Luther and his family, as well as other Protestant leaders. His other artwork often illustrated Protestant themes printed in pamphlets and distributed to proselytize the faith.\n\nPortraits\n\nPortraiture was an economic mainstay for many Northern European artists, and the mastery of oil painting allowed for artistic virtuosity, precise realism, and psychological portrayals (there is a reason why Willem de Kooning in the 20th century famously said \"Flesh is the reason oil painting was invented\"). Rogier van der Weyden,Â Petrus Christus, Hans Holbein the Younger, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Hans Memling, Jan van Eyck, and Albrecht DÃ¼rer were all noted portraitists. The masterworks of Van Eyck and DÃ¼rer included self-portraits that became foundational to the form in technique and sensibility. Holbein the Younger and Cranach the Elder made iconic portraits of the notable leaders of the day: Holbein portrayed the English court, and Cranach the leaders of the Reformation. Christus created portraits like his Portrait of a Carthusian (1446), showing an anonymous monk, and his Isabel of Portugal with St. Elizabeth (1457-60), as well as Portrait of a Young Girl (c. 1470). Rogier van den Weyden's portraits like his Portrait of a Woman (1460) were noted for their sculpted facial features and realistic expression.\n\nThe Invention of New Genres\n\nThe Northern European Renaissance was responsible for introducing various new genres that would become long-lasting motifs in Western art. Due in part to the Reformation, which rejected certain types of religious imagery and the rise of wealthy merchant class, there was enormous growth in the market for secular painting. While landscape and still-life had their origins in religious painting, over the course of the 16th century, they grew into their own separate genres.\n\nJoachim Patinir pioneered the development of landscape painting in works like Flight into Egypt (1516-17), which featured religious scenes set within magnificent and fantastic landscapes of mountains, farmland, forests, and bodies of water. The taste for this type of âworld landscapeâ grew, and over time, the paintings lost their religious imagery. Bruegel also played a major figure in developing landscape with his works such as Winter Landscape with Skaters and Bird Trap (1565), which present a more realistic, observed landscape compared to the earlier versions by Patinir.\n\nWith their attentive rendering of consumer goods, Pieter Aertsenâs paintings pairing market stalls with religious scenes helped establish a taste for still-life paintings. Over time, artists such as Joachim Beuckelaer would create compositions forgoing the religious figures altogether and focus solely on market and kitchen scenes. Additionally, Albrecht DÃ¼rer's detailed and observant depictions of flora and fauna, such as his Large Piece of Turf (1503) or his Young Hare (1502), informed the development of still-life painting, especially depictions of the natural world.\n\nLastly, depictions of daily life, especially scenes of peasants in the countryside, became popular during the 16th century. Bruegel played a key role in developing this type of artwork, also known as genre painting, as demonstrated by The Peasant Dance (1568). He became so associated with this subject matter that he was dubbed \"peasant Bruegel.\"\n\nLater Developments - After Northern European Renaissance\n\nBy the 1580s, artistic tastes shifted as Mannerism, which was first developed in Italy, spread throughout Northern Europe. A new generation of artists, such as Hendrick Goltzius, Cornelis Cornelisz van Haarlem, and Adriaen de Vries, would draw from new Italian trends to develop a distinctive style of Northern Mannerism that featured sinuous, elongated bodies and centered on the concept of artifice. Aside from these changing tastes, political events such as the outbreak of the Eighty Yearsâ War in 1568, in which the Low Countries fought for independence from their Spanish Habsburg rulers, greatly affected the production of artwork in the Low Countries. The second half of the 16th century also witnessed the development of new artistic hubs, most notably Prague, the seat of the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II.\n\nIn the following century, artists from the Dutch Golden Age drew inspiration from the techniques and genres developed during Northern Renaissance. In particular, portraiture, genre, landscape and still-life became major categories of painting that played an important role in the art market. For example, artists such as Adriaen Brouwer and David Teniers the Younger established careers as peasant painters in the model of Pieter Bruegel.\n\nAdditionally, each Northern European Renaissance artist went on to have a long-lasting influence. Matthias GrÃ¼newald's work influenced the Expressionists and New Objectivity artistsÂ like Otto Dix and George Grosz, as well as Pablo Picasso, and the Surrealist Max Ernst. Jan van Eyck was foundational to the works of the Pre-Raphaelites, as Hieronymus Bosch's work was to Surrealists like Salvador DalÃ­ and Joan MirÃ³. Hans Holbein the Younger's portraiture influenced Anthony van Dyck, Peter Paul Rubens, and British portraiture beginning in the 1700s. Bruegel's peasant genre launched the painting of everyday life as a trend in Western art, found in the subsequent movements of Realism (and the many strands of it to this day), Naturalism, Impressionism, and Post-Impressionism, to name a few.\n\nThe innovations of the Northern European Renaissance so informed Western art, that art historian Joseph Leo Koerner, referencing the realism and self-staging of DÃ¼rer and van Eyck and the idiosyncratic vision of Bruegel and Bosch, has argued (rather boldly) that they, rather than the Italian Renaissance artists, laid the groundwork for modern art.\n\nUseful Resources on Northern European Renaissance\n\nSimilar Art"
