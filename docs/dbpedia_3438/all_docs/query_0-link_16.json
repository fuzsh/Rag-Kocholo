Old imperial insignia have replaced hammers and sickles on government buildings, the bodies of the last tsar and his family have been exhumed and venerated, and Putin's foreign policy stakes imperial claims on the nations on Russia's border. This course examines what the Russian empire was, how it worked, and the legacies that it left behind. Themes to be considered include the culture of the autocracy and the tradition of reform from above; imperial expansion and multiethnic society; the construction of class, ethnic, and estate identities; and the causes and consequences of the Old Regime's collapse. Mondays and Wednesdays are reserved for lectures, Fridays for discussion. Note(s): First-year students warmly welcomed; no prior Russian history, culture, or language assumed.

War, Culture, and Imperialism: Russia and the West from the 19th Century to the Present. 100 Units.\n\nThis course will survey literature shaped by the history of imperial conflict between Russia and \"The West,\" ultimately with a view to better understanding our current geopolitical situation and mediascape. The course will be anchored in the nineteenth century, focusing on writing related to the Crimean War (1853-6) and the long contest between Britain and Russia for domination in Central Asia and India known as \"The Great Game,\" but it will also provide a snapshot of Cold War cultural production, with an emphasis on ideological dissent among Black radicals and Russian emigres, before turning finally to our contemporary moment.

Tolstoy's Late Works. 100 Units.\n\nThis course examines the works written by Tolstoy after Anna Karenina, when he abandoned the novel as a form and gave up his copyright. Readings include his influential writings on non-violence and vegetarianism, his challenges to church and state authority, as well as later literary works, which some believe surpass the famous novels he had renounced. We will also explore the particularities of Tolstoy's charisma in these years, when he came to be viewed as a second Tsar in Russia and as a moral authority throughout the world.\n\nInstructor(s): William Nickell Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RLIT 32900, RLST 28501, FNDL 22850, REES 30000\n\nREES 20002.

My sin, my soul, Lolita: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate, to tap at three on the teeth.\" Popular as Nabokov's \"all-American\" novel is, it is rarely discussed beyond its psychosexual profile. This intensive text-centered and discussion-based course attempts to supersede the univocal obsession with the novel's pedophiliac plot as such by concerning itself above all with the novel's language: language as failure, as mania, and as conjuration.\n\nInstructor(s): M.

Dostoevsky's Demons. 100 Units.\n\nMikhail Bakhtin's description of Dostoevsky's novels as polyphonic works, in which characters are free of ideological subordination to the author and thus more fully embody radically different points of view, has been highly compelling as a model for novelistic discourse particularly in the West. There are other views of Dostoevsky, however. In Russia, more attention has been paid to his faith in Orthodox Christianity, which he believed could resolve the intense conflicts that dominate his novels, and to his view that the Russian national character might have the power to unite humanity under universal values. In this course we will read the novel Demons against the backdrop of these ideas, but also in the context of contemporary Russia, where notions of national destiny and sovereign ideals have been used to justify repression and invasion. Our method of reading will be straight out of Dostoevsky and Bakhtin, as students will be invited to adopt the most diverse perspectives and to argue their ideas as if possessed.\n\nInstructor(s): William Nickell Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): REES 30027, FNDL 20027\n\nREES 20200. Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov. 100 Units.\n\nWe will read and interpret The Brothers Karamazov by Dostoevsky. Among major themes are the relation to God and religion to the larger society and state; the problem of evil; and the nature of sin and how it enters into religious beliefs; human \"freedom,\" and what the word might have meant to Dostoevsky; and love.\n\nInstructor(s): S.

Walter Benjamin: 1935-1938. 100 Units.\n\n[Volume 3 of] Harvard's majestic annotated edition of the essays and fragments includes reflections on Brecht, Kafka and the collector Eduard Fuchs, an early version of the famous analysis of art in the age of mechanical reproduction (here more accurately translated as 'technological reproducibility') and the equally exhilarating inquiry into the nature of narrative, 'The Storyteller.'

Gombrowicz: The Writer as Philosopher. 100 Units.\n\nIn this course, we dwell on Witold Gombrowicz the philosopher, exploring the components of his authorial style and concepts that substantiate his claim to both the literary and the philosophical spheres. Entangled in an ongoing battle with basic philosophical tenets and, indeed, with existence itself, this erudite Polish author is a prime example of a 20th century modernist whose philosophical novels explode with uncanny laughter. In contrast to many of his contemporaries, who established their reputations as writers/philosophers, Gombrowicz applied distinctly literary models to the same questions that they explored. We investigate these models in depth, as we focus on Gombrowicz's novels, philosophical lectures, and some of his autobiographical writings. With an insight from recent criticism of these primary texts, we seek answers to the more general question: What makes this author a philosopher?\n\nInstructor(s): Bozena Shallcross Terms Offered: Winter\n\nNote(s): All readings in English.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): FNDL 26903, ISHU 29405, REES 31000\n\nREES 21001. Greece and the Balkans in the Age of Nationalism. 100 Units.\n\nThis course is an introduction to the history of Southeastern Europe since the 1790s. Each week's work will examine a key topic in the Balkan affairs through a combination of lectures, readings and discussion of associated issues. The class will not follow the history of any one Balkan country comprehensively. Instead, the course will direct students' attention to relevant developments which address questions like these: 1. How does Balkan history related to European history? 2. What is a nation, a nationality, and an ethnic group? 3. What has nationalism meant in the Balkans? The curse emphasizes the history of Greece, Albania, Bulgaria, Romania and Yugoslavia, with some attention to events in the Ottoman Empire, the Habsburg Monarchy and Hungary as appropriate. The course aims to offer a historical background that will enable students to better understand the recent history of Greece and the Balkans.\n\nInstructor(s): Stefanos Katsikas Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): NEHC 21002, MOGK 21001, MOGK 31001, HIST 23613\n\nREES 21002. Kieslowski's French Cinema. 100 Units.\n\nKrzysztof Kieślowski's The Decalogue and The Double Life of Veronique catapulted the Polish director to the international scene. His subsequent French triptych Blue, White, Red turned out to be his last works that altered his image and legacy to affirm his status as an auteur and a representative of the transnational cinema. We discuss how in his virtual universe of parallel histories and repeated chances, captured with visually and aurally dazzling artistry, the possibility of reconstituting one's identity, triggered by tragic loss and betrayal, reveals an ever-ambiguous reality. By focusing on the filmmaker's dissolution of the thing-world, often portrayed on the verge of vague abstraction of (in)audibility or (un)transparency, this course bridges his cinema with the larger concepts of postmodern subjectivity and possibility of metaphysics. The course concludes with the filmmaker's contribution to world cinema. All along, we read selections from Kieślowski's and Piesiewicz's screen scripts, Kieślowski's own writings and interviews, as well as from the abundant criticism of his French movies. All materials are in English.\n\nInstructor(s): Bozena Shallcross Terms Offered: TBD\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CMST 24405, CMLT 24405, FNDL 25312, REES 31002, CMST 34405\n\nREES 21101. Advanced BCS: Language through Fiction and Media I. 100 Units.\n\nThe three-quarter sequence advanced course in BCS is designed for both students who have completed two years of language training at the University of Chicago or equivalent formal study elsewhere, and heritage learners. While the pedagogical needs of heritage learners differ from those of second-language learners, they collectively inform central tenets of the course. The objective is to accelerate the process of language acquisition through reciprocal exchange of knowledge, skills, and cultural information. The course curriculum combines selected pieces of fiction with media-film adaptations of literary works featured in the textbook, or films addressing the weekly topic. Other materials, such as interviews with writers, directors, and humanities scholars also complement the course.

(Re)Branding the Balkan City: Comtemp. Belgrade/Sarajevo/Zagreb. 100 Units.\n\nThe freedom to make and remake our cities (and ourselves) is one of the most precious yet most neglected of the human rights,\" argues David Harvey. In this course, we use an urban studies lens to explore the complex history, social fabric, architecture, infrastructure, and cultural transformation of the former Yugoslav capitals. Since their inception, these cities have relied on multifaceted exchanges of peoples and political projects, forms of knowledge, financial and cultural capital, means of production, and innovative ideas. Among others, these exchanges produced two phenomena, Yugoslav architecture, embodying one of the great political experiments of the modern era, and the Non-Aligned Movement, as explored in recent documentary films (Turajlić 2023), museum exhibits (MoMA 2018, \"Toward a Concrete Utopia: Architecture in Yugoslavia 1948-1980\"), and monographs (Tito in Africa: Picturing Solidarity). Drawing on anthropological theory and ethnography of the city, we consider processes of urban destruction and renewal, practices of branding spaces and identities, metropolitan citizenship, arts and design, architectural histories and styles, and the broader politics of space. The course is complemented by cultural and historical media, guest speakers, and virtual tours.

It emphasizes the four communicative skills of listening, reading, speaking, and writing in a culturally authentic context. It builds transcultural competence by expanding students' knowledge of the language, culture, history, and daily lives of the Russian-speaking people. Vocabulary building is strongly emphasized. We add to the existing skills and develop our abilities to analyze increasingly complex texts for their meaning: to identify various styles and registers of the Russian language and to provide their neutral equivalents in standard Russian. We also work on developing our abilities to paraphrase, narrate, describe, support opinions, hypothesize, discuss abstract topics, and handle linguistically unfamiliar situations (in spoken and written format).

Kafka's The Trial. 100 Units.\n\nThis very close reading of Kafka's arguably most well known unfinished novel means to move away from megalithic glosses of Kafka as a writer of allegory-of bureaucratic oppression, social alienation, and a world abandoned by God, etc.-instead to look deeply at Kafka's precision, and strategic imprecision, of language, language as trauma, wound, and axe.

The Cinema of Miloš Forman. 100 Units.\n\nThe films of Miloš Forman (1932-2018) reflect the turbulence of the 1960s, '70s, '80s and '90s, and 2000s by focusing on the underdog, the pariah, the eccentric. The subject matter to which Forman was drawn translated into his cinema with a signature bittersweet tone, emphatic narrative cogency, and lush spontaneity. This course is an intensive study of Forman's work from his \"New Wave\" work in Czechoslovakia (Loves of a Blonde, The Fireman's Ball) to his U.S. studio successes (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Amadeus), to his idiosyncratic and parabolic last films (Man on the Moon, Goya's Ghosts). Among other topics, the course contemplate the value of a dark sense of humor, cinematic gorgeousness, and artistic dissidence.\n\nInstructor(s): Malynne Sternstein Terms Offered: TBD\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CMST 26603, CMST 36603, REES 32010, FNDL 22010\n\nREES 23015.

Contact Linguistics. 100 Units.\n\nThis seminar focuses on current research in contact linguistics in a global perspective, including but not limited to the impact of languages of wider communication (e.g. English, Russian) in contact with other languages. Topics to be covered include the following: language/dialect contact, convergence and language shift resulting in attrition and language endangerment and loss. Other contact-induced linguistic changes and processes to be considered include borrowing, code-switching, code-shifting, diglossia, loss of linguistic restrictions and grammatical permeability, and the impact of language contact in the emergence and/or historical development of languages.\n\nInstructor(s): Lenore Grenoble Terms Offered: Spring\n\nPrerequisite(s): LING 20001 or consent of instructor\n\nEquivalent Course(s): LING 26310, LING 36310\n\nREES 23154. XCAP: The Commune: The Making and Breaking of Intentional Communities. 100 Units.\n\nAny class is an intentional community of sorts: people gathered together with a sense of collective purpose. But often the hopes of students are not met by the content or the methods in the classroom. Can we do better by making the process more intentional-clarifying and developing a collective sense of purpose at the outset? We will start by forming a collective plan on topics to be explored-anything from iconic American communities and Russian communes to memoir studies and economics. Possible projects include creating an intentional community in an off-campus location, designing a communal space, rewriting manifestos, or creating a new communal charter. We can cover anything from economics, space, and gender to the problem of leadership and secular belief systems. We may also want to utilize alternative modes of learning, besides reading and discussing texts, such as roleplaying. A few students in the class have some experience in intentional communities, and we will welcome their input and suggestions\n\nInstructor(s): William Nickell Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GNSE 29975, REES 33154, KNOW 29975\n\nREES 23300. Introduction to Contemporary Ukrainian Culture. 100 Units.\n\nThis course examines contemporary Ukrainian culture and society with attention to anticolonial resistance in the past and after the start of the Russian war on Ukraine in 2014. It focuses on diverse literary texts (poems, novels, memoirs), films (feature, short, documentary), and other forms of cultural production (visual artwork, music videos, multimodal digital projects). It is structured in three parts. The first part examines the CULTURAL MEMORY of events in Ukraine' history which are re-examined today and continue to resonate in contemporary Ukrainian contexts. Among examined events are persecutions of Ukrainian intellectuals in the Soviet Union, Holodomor or Stalin's human-made famine, Chornobyl nuclear explosion, and others. The second part focuses on the dynamics of DISSENT AND CIVIC SOCIETY, addressing three contemporary Ukrainian revolutions, feminist movements and gender dissent, debates surrounding public space and the place of Soviet heritage in contemporary Ukraine, and the process of decolonization. The third part examines RUSSIA'S WAR ON UKRAINE, which has been ongoing for more than a decade and 1/3 of Ukraine's history of independence. This part focuses on places affected by the war, such as Crimea, Mariupol, and the east of Ukraine, but also addresses the dynamics of volunteering in Ukrainian society and artmaking in times of war. No knowledge of Ukrainian language is required for this course.\n\nInstructor(s): Darya Tsymbalyuk Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): REES 33300\n\nREES 23325. Ukrainian Art, Literature and Film in the Wake of the Russian Invasion (2014-present) 100 Units.\n\nHow does war affect art? Over the past decade, Ukrainian artists have been raising this question in their work, alongside questions about personal and collective identity, authority and authenticity, language and imperial violence, epistemic injustice and decolonization. In this course, we will examine art, literature, and film arising out of the war-triggered crises, whether political, aesthetic, ethical, or existential, focusing on the artists' creative engagement with different kinds of documentary and source material, experiments with form, and intermodal and inter-genre dialogue. Readings may include work by Stanislav Aseyev, Yevgenia Belorusets, Artem Chekh, Andrey Kurkov, Olena Stiazhkina, Natalya Vorozhbit, and Serhiy Zhadan. We will also consider films, cartoons, and a range of audiovisual sources. Students can expect to engage with the newest cutting-edge work from Ukraine; to develop individual research projects in collaboration with their peers; and to write a final paper.\n\nInstructor(s): Max Rosochinsky Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): REES 33325, CMST 23325\n\nREES 23706. The Soviet Union. 100 Units.\n\nThis lecture course surveys the making and unmaking of the Soviet Union as a society, culture, economy, superpower, and empire from 1917 to 1991. The Soviet Union began as an unprecedented radical experiment in remaking society and economy, ethnic and gender relations, personal identities, even human nature, but in the course of its history, it came to resemble other (capitalist) societies, sharing, in turn, their violence, welfare provisions, and consumerism. The story of this transformation-from being unique and exhilarating to being much like everyone else, only poorer and more drab-will be at the center of our exploration. The main themes of the course include social and cultural revolutions; ideology and the role of Marxism; political violence from the birth of the socialist state to the end of the Stalin terror; origins, practices, aesthetics, legacies, and critiques of Stalinism; law, dissent, and human rights; nationality policies and the role of ethnic minorities; the economy of shortages and the material culture it created; institutions of daily life (communal apartments, courtyards, peasant markets, dachas, and boiler rooms); socialist realism and the Soviet dreamworld.\n\nInstructor(s): E.

Anxious Spaces. 100 Units.\n\nThis course explores built (architectural), filmic, and narrative spaces that disturb our bearings, un-situate us, and defy neurotypical cognition. In the sense that \"angst\" is a mode that can be understood as both stalling and generative, we analyze spaces and representations of spaces such as corridors, attics, basements, canals, viaducts, labyrinths, forests, ruins, etc., spaces that are 'felt' as estranging, foreboding, in short, anxiety-provoking, in order to understand why-despite or because these topoi are hostile-they are produced, reproduced, and craved. We will pay special attention to abject spaces of racial and sexual exclusivity, sites of spoliation, and of memory and erasure. Among our primary texts are films by Kubrick, Tarkovksy, and Antonioni, and Chytilová, short fiction by Borges, Kafka, Nabokov, and selections from the philosophical/theoretical writings of Bachelard, Deleuze & Guattari, Debord, Foucault, Kracauer, and the edited volume, Mapping Desire, Geographies of Sexuality.\n\nInstructor(s): Malynne Sternstein Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): REES 34220, GNSE 24220, GNSE 34220, ARCH 24220\n\nREES 24402. Introduction to Russian and Soviet Cinema. 100 Units.\n\nWhat is the relationship between film, myth, ideology, and revolution? What are the features of Soviet comedy? What could it mean for a film to be \"poetic\" and how is this idea understood by and manifest in the work of directors like Andrei Tarkovsky and Alexander Sokurov? These are only some of the many questions we will explore as we engage in a survey of Russian-language cinema from its very beginnings (in the 1890s) to the present, engaging with representative texts and cinematic works from each of Russian cinema's primary periods (early Russian, avant-garde revolutionary, socialist realist, thaw, stagnation, and post-Soviet).\n\nInstructor(s): David Molina Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CMST 22402\n\nREES 24404. Theater in East and Central Europe: Between Power and Powerlessness. 100 Units.\n\nNational independence movements, revolutions, authoritarian regimes, and the decline of empire: playwrights in East and Central Europe wrote major works of world literature in response to these events - and sometimes in prescient anticipation of them. This seminar introduces students to the plays that, from Chekhov to Havel, shaped the fates of nations. Topics include: the avant-garde, theater of the absurd, acting methods, performance art, and documentary theater.\n\nInstructor(s): Ania Aizman Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): REES 34404, TAPS 35214, TAPS 25214, CMLT 26040\n\nREES 24425. Invasion Culture: Russia through its Wars. 100 Units.\n\nThis course looks at contemporary culture through Russia's invasions, from the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Broadly, this course explores how war shapes cultural life. How do the policies and strategies of war, and the art and literature of wartime, convey ideas about power and the state, traditional vs. modern values, civilizational mission vs. cultural pluralism? Beyond Russian literature and film, we consider voices from Afghanistan, the Caucasus, Chechnya, Syria, Belarus, and Ukraine, asking, How are Russia's wars fought and resisted in the domain of culture?\n\nInstructor(s): Ania Aizman Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): HIST 24009, CMLT 24425, REES 34425\n\nREES 24426. The Witch Craze in 17th-Century Europe: Scotland, Poland-Lithuania, Russia, and Moravia. 100 Units.\n\nIn this course, we look carefully at the reasons for and repercussions of the \"witch craze\" in the long 17th-century, focussing on primary texts such as trial reports, legal literature, pamphlets, woodcuts, scholarly dissent, and other paraphernalia. The course follows a sweep of the craze from Lancashire in Scotland, where trials began in the 1590s, to Poznań in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, to the Russian village of Lukh on the outskirts of Moscow, where between 1656 and 1660 over twenty-five individuals, most of them male, were tried and several executed, and finally to Northern Moravia under Habsburg rule where inquisitor Hetman Boblig presided over the burning of almost 100 \"witches.\" In each region, trials followed different customs-Protestant, Eastern Orthodox, Catholic-and answered to different legislative discourse-ecclesiastical, laic, secular-yet all can be said to be the product of a common desire and collective fear. To supplement our understanding of the multifaceted anxieties that are expressed in works such as King James' Daemonologie (1597), and to ask more questions of the intersectional phobias around gender, sexuality, religion, and class (rural-urban; colony-metropole), we take up theory from Foucault, Federici, and Mbembe, and others.\n\nInstructor(s): Malynne Sternstein Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): REES 34426, GNSE 24426, GNSE 34426, HIST 32315, HIST 22315\n\nREES 25005. History of International Cinema II: Sound Era to 1960. 100 Units.\n\nThe center of this course is film style, from the classical scene breakdown to the introduction of deep focus, stylistic experimentation, and technical innovation (sound, wide screen, location shooting). The development of a film culture is also discussed. Texts include Thompson and Bordwell's Film History: An Introduction; and works by Bazin, Belton, Sitney, and Godard. Screenings include films by Hitchcock, Welles, Rossellini, Bresson, Ozu, Antonioni, and Renoir.\n\nInstructor(s): James Lastra Terms Offered: Winter\n\nPrerequisite(s): Prior or concurrent registration in CMST 10100 required.

Russian Media at War. 100 Units.\n\nIn this course we will form a collective to follow and respond to Russian media coverage of the war in Ukraine and its larger context. We will consider the impact of tightened control over journalistic free speech and the increasingly top-down control of representations of Russia's role in the region, with a primary focus on Ukraine. We will analyze the main narratives that have been used to justify the actions of the Russian state, and the methods that have been used to undermine counternarratives. While we will find tools of analysis through background reading in theory, we will spend most of our time looking at current media content coming out of Russia, Ukraine, and their neighboring countries, with some attention also to American and other western sources. Russian, Ukrainian, and other language skills will be highly useful, but are not required.\n\nInstructor(s): William Nickell Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): REES 35604, KNOW 25604, KNOW 35604\n\nREES 26011-26012-26015. Introduction to Russian Civilization I-II-III.\n\nThis three-quarter sequence, which meets the general education requirement in civilization studies, provides an interdisciplinary introduction to Russian civilization. The first quarter covers the ninth century to the 1870s; the second quarter continues on through the post-Soviet period. Working closely with a variety of primary sources—from oral legends to film and music, from political treatises to literary masterpieces—we will track the evolution of Russian civilization over the centuries and through radically different political regimes. Topics to be discussed include the influence of Byzantine, Mongol-Tataric, and Western culture in Russian civilization; forces of change and continuity in political, intellectual and cultural life; the relationship between center and periphery; systems of social and political legitimization; and symbols and practices of collective identity.\n\nREES 26011. Russia and Eurasia: Empires, Societies, Cultures I. 100 Units.\n\nThe first quarter spans the centuries between early medieval Rus', which furnished modern Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus with a story of origins, to the intellectual, social, and national mobilization in the mid-19th century. Major themes include: the influence of Byzantine, Mongol-Tataric, and Western cultures; medieval principalities, city-states, and the rise of the centralized state, its oversized role in Russian and regional social and economic development, its hyper-modernizing schemes and its periodic collapse; cross-cultural interactions in the steppe and the Baltic and Black Seas littorals; Russia's wars and the emergence of the Russian empire; varieties of resistance, from peasant uprisings and flight to religious dissent to aristocratic opposition, and the emergence of the repressive machinery of the state; forces of change and continuity in political, intellectual, and cultural life.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): Taking these courses in sequence is recommended but not required.

Russia and Eurasia: Empires, Societies, Cultures II. 100 Units.\n\nThe second quarter focuses on nearly two centuries of upheaval, from the radical movements of the late 19th century to the birth, life, and death of the Soviet Union and the emergence of post-Soviet states. Our topics include Russian imperialism, colonial conquests, and the reconstitution of the Russian empire as the Soviet Union; systems of social and political legitimization; political violence, the evolution of the repressive machinery, and the enduring problem of the rule of law; religious, national, and sexual minorities, practices of everyday life, social order and disorder; resistance, dissent, and liberation movements; creativity, experimentation, and self-expression under censorship.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Winter\n\nNote(s): Taking these courses in sequence is recommended but not required.

Topics vary from year to year. Previously, we have examined Russia's cultures of war in the 20th century; Soviet and East European dissent; Russia and the West since the 18th century; gender and revolutionary violence in Russia; transitions to capitalism across the socialist bloc; and art and anarchism in the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and post-Soviet Russia.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Spring\n\nNote(s): When taken following Hist 13900 and Hist 14000, this course meets the general education requirement in Humanities, Civilization Studies, and the Arts.

Russophonia: Contemporary Poetry Beyond Borders. 100 Units.\n\nLike anglophone and francophone literatures, russophone culture has long been produced beyond Russia's borders. The collapse of the Soviet Union both shrunk and scattered Russia's cultural influence, transforming the contours of \"russophonia-land.\" Studying the development of poetry written in Russian both within and outside of Russia, we read anthologies of Russian poems from Kyiv, Minsk, Petersburg, Fergana, Alma-Aty, Tel Aviv, and New York. We consider: revolutionary exchange networks, colonization, immigration, translation, and other dynamics that drive linguistic spread. Students undertake presentations and research on writers of their choice.\n\nInstructor(s): Ania Aizman Terms Offered: TBD\n\nPrerequisite(s): Knowledge of Russian for reading.\n\nEquivalent Course(s): REES 36038\n\nREES 26070.

In a guided process, students will co-facilitate this syllabus, deciding on topics and readings in (translated) Ukrainian literature and film as well as the history of Ukraine. Possible topics include: memory of Soviet wars, the capitalist transition, Chornobyl, artistic movements, subcultures, the Maidan Revolution, Russia's war, language politics, ethnicities, and gender relations. Reading options include Andryukhovich, Zabuzhko, Plokhy, Zhadan.

The Roots of War: Historical and Cultural Causes of Russian Aggression in Ukraine. 100 Units.\n\nSince the beginning of Russia's war on Ukraine, Vladimir Putin and his entourage have created false historical constructions that serve as the basis for their aggressive policy. The main question of this course is: to what extent is Putin's retro-policy historically grounded, traditional and natural? An analysis of the rhetoric and historiosophy of the modern Russian elite will reveal the sources they been drawn upon. Is there a connection between Muscovite Russia, the Russian Empire and modern Russian neo-imperialism? What role does the legacy of the USSR play in the political system, state structure and foreign policy of the modern Russian Federation? Where do historical trends, national interests and the new imperial ideology coincide and contradict each other? We will also discuss the modern history of opposition to Putin's authoritarianism and trace the history and cultural significance of democratic institutions in Russia. Finally, we will use the history of Ukrainian statehood and the processes of formation of the Ukrainian nation to shed alternative perspective on recent Russian views of Ukraine.\n\nInstructor(s): Sergei Shokarev Terms Offered: Spring Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): REES 36072\n\nREES 26074. The Cinema of Andrei Tarkovsky. 100 Units.\n\nFilmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky (1932-1986) is widely considered to be one of Soviet cinema's great auteurs, a fiercely independent creative artist and thinker. Known for his long takes, visual imagery, intertextuality, and philosophical self-reflectiveness, Tarkovsky has profoundly shaped the evolution of modern art cinema over the past fifty years and his legacy is still very much alive in both the Slavic world and the west. In this course, we will study Tarkovsky's major films focusing particularly on their aesthetic characteristics, spiritual and philosophical dimensions, and cultural and political context.\n\nInstructor(s): David Molina Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CMST 26074, CMST 36074, REES 36074\n\nREES 26077. Russian Modernist Theater. 100 Units.\n\nRussian Modernist Theater explores the theory and practice of the new stage forms developed in Russia from 1900 to 1940. The course begins with the Stanislavsky school, and then delves deeply into the more experimental work of Meyerhold and his generation and the first attempts to create a revolutionary Soviet theater in the 1920s. The course will include a production, which will be scaled to the number and ambitions of the enrolled students. Course requirements can be met through the writing of a conventional paper, or through the production, via set or costume design, dramaturgy, performance, or staging. Each of these production assignments will require a write-up relating the work to the course materials and discussions.\n\nInstructor(s): William Nickell Terms Offered: TBD\n\nEquivalent Course(s): REES 36077\n\nREES 26603. Soviet Cinema and the Avant-Garde. 100 Units.\n\nThis course examines some of the most ambitious claims about what cinema as a medium can do by early Soviet filmmakers. We look at the extraordinary flourishing of cinema in the Soviet Union in the 1920s and 30s including films by Eisenstein, Vertov, Shub, Pudovkin and Dovzhenko, their theoretical writings, their collaborations with avant-garde artists and theater designers, and their far-reaching influence on film and film theory. We will also consider the political and historical context of the films and their creators.\n\nInstructor(s): Anne E.

Anticolonial Worlding: Literature, Film, Thought. 100 Units.\n\nThis course explores anticolonial worldbuilding through literature, film, art, and philosophy. It focuses on the role of the cultural Cold War in shaping anticolonial aesthetics and politics during the twentieth century as well as its impact on our current political moment. The mid-century was characterized by an expansion of anticolonial festivals, exchanges, and congresses and marked by political crises and coalitional solidarity across Vietnam, Palestine, Cuba, Soviet and US imperial expansion, and the May 1968 student protests. We will explore how Pan-Arab, Pan-African, Non-Aligned/Global South, Marxist-Leninist, indigenous land rights, and racial justice movements mobilized class, gender, and language politics. Exploring anticolonial literature, film, and art across a multilingual and transnational archive we will ask how socialist and speculative realisms, engaged literature, third cinema, agitprop, and other aesthetic movements generated powerful internationalist imaginations and networks of resistance.\n\nInstructor(s): Leah Feldman Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): RDIN 36994, GNSE 26994, ENGL 26994, NEHC 26994, GNSE 36994, CMLT 26994, CMLT 36994, RDIN 26994, HMRT 26994\n\nREES 27007. Mapping Our Selves: Identity and Subjectivity. 100 Units.\n\nThis course examines how different collective and individual selves develop, change, and get mobilized in modern Eastern and Central Europe. As Enlightenment, post-Enlightenment, and national ideas spread across Europe, the understanding of self and subjectivity was fundamentally transformed. In Eastern and Central Europe, themselves terms that have their roots in these changes, this occurred at a tumultuous time of changes of borders, countries, and forms of government. This course focuses primarily on cultures and literatures in Poland's different forms of existence and non-existence, a locus central to these dynamics. We will ask such questions as: What does it mean to develop a sense of a nation without a territorial state or within an empire? What kind of subject do different works of art elicit and why? Under what circumstances does identity become a more engaging understanding of the self? What are its borders and porousness? We will be reading a variety of literary, artistic, and theoretical works from the 18th to 21st centuries, among them Immanuel Kant on Enlightenment subjectivity, Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau on the form and future of Poland, Karl Marx on base and superstructure, and Louis Althusser on the dynamics of getting drawn into a society and economic system (interpellation); as well as Polish authors probing these issues and tensions, such as Witkacy, Eliza Orzeszkowa, Andrzej Stasiuk, Debora Vogel, and Stanisław Brzozowski.\n\nInstructor(s): Dag Lindskog Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): REES 37007\n\nREES 27019. Holocaust Object. 100 Units.\n\nIn this course, we explore various ontological and representational modes of the Holocaust material object world as it was represented during World War II. Then, we interrogate the post-Holocaust artifacts and material remnants, as they are displayed, curated, controlled, and narrated in the memorial sites and museums of former ghettos and extermination and concentration camps. These sites which-once the locations of genocide-are now places of remembrance, the (post)human, and material remnants also serve educational purposes. Therefore, we study the ways in which this material world, ranging from infrastructure to detritus, has been subjected to two, often conflicting, tasks of representation and preservation, which we view through a prism of authenticity. In order to study representation, we critically engage a textual and visual reading of museum narrations and fiction writings; to tackle the demands of preservation, we apply a neo-materialist approach. Of special interest are survivors' testimonies as appended to the artifacts they donated. The course will also equip you with salient critical tools for future creative research in Holocaust studies.\n\nInstructor(s): Bozena Shallcross Terms Offered: TBD\n\nEquivalent Course(s): REES 37019, ANTH 23910, ARCH 27019, ANTH 35035, HIST 33413, HIST 23413, JWSC 29500\n\nREES 27025. The Cracks of Being: Polish Modernist Literature. 100 Units.\n\nThe Cracks of Being: Polish Modernist Literature. The 19th and early 20th centuries were characterized by radical changes: trains, cameras, telephones, industrialization, democracy. Moreover, objectivity appeared to be undermined by our unconscious, making for an increased doubt and suspicion toward being. \"All that is solid melts into air,\" Karl Marx wrote, and many would-be truths seemed to unmoor. On the other hand, modern life came with a sense of alienation and disenchantment in our increasingly mediated experience. Straddling this chasm, modernist literature has used many different strategies to make literary modern existence; and these are the focus of this course. Some authors try to salvage form, others attempt to mimic this instability, or represent the impossibility of representation. Our authors look for liminalities, epiphanies, cracks and nooks of being and language, in order to sound out, defamiliarize and re-present reality. The authors we will read include Bolesław Leśmian, Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz, Zofia Nałkowska, Bruno Schulz, Czesław Miłosz, and Witold Gombrowicz.\n\nInstructor(s): Sasha Lindskog Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): REES 37025\n\nREES 27026. Kieslowski: The Decalogue. 100 Units.\n\nIn this class, we study the monumental series \"The Decalogue\" by one of the most influential filmmakers from Poland, Krzysztof Kieślowski. Without mechanically relating the films to the Ten Commandments, Kieślowski explores the relevance of the biblical moral rules to the state of modern man forced to make ethical choices. Each part of the series contests the absolutism of moral axioms through narrative twists and reversals in a wide, universalized sphere. An analysis of the films will be accompanied by readings from Kieślowski's own writings and interviews, including criticism by Zizek, Insdorf, and others.\n\nInstructor(s): Bozena Shallcross Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): REES 37026, CMST 36705, FNDL 24003, CMST 26705\n\nREES 27032. Bodies, Objects, Cognition. 100 Units.\n\nThis course explores the differences between objects and embodiment as examined in varied historical periods and artistic genres. We will probe the ontological indeterminacy of embodied beings versus machines in terms of agency, autonomy, subjectivity, and artificiality. Our main operative mode is a visual-verbal comparison and its perception. Through discussions of such visual strategies as pareidolia, abstraction, bodyscape, as well as the scientific phenomena of cloning and humanoid robotics, the course will destabilize once fundamental epistemologies to present a cognitive moment when the traditionally stable object-body dichotomy is understood anew as a dynamic site of affective, biological, representational, and mechanical relations. Visual artists, writers and critics studied will include Leonardo da Vinci, Hans Holbein, Giuseppe Arcimboldo, Wassily Kandinsky, Kazimir Malevich, Tadeusz Borowski, Stanislaw Lem, Allan Teger, Magdalena Abakanowicz, W.T.J. Mitchell and others. All readings are in English.\n\nInstructor(s): Bozena Shallcross Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ARTH 37032, ANTH 27032, ANTH 37032, ARTH 27032, KNOW 27032, REES 37032, KNOW 37032\n\nREES 27035. Gender, Agency, and Power in 19th C Russian Literature. 100 Units.\n\nThis course focuses on scandalous provocations and quieter acts of resistance against normative gender expectations in 19th-century Russian literature. We read narratives of rebellion by individuals and collective actions by groups of women, and consider the surprising agency attributed to women's cooperative work in Russian literature as well as the heavy burdens placed on women by family, state, and church. Readings include primarily short fiction in a variety of genres (sentimental, romantic, realist, and gothic) by canonized male writers and by women writers of the 19th Century who are less often taught and translated, but were widely read in their own day. These works expand our understanding of the narrative possibilities for sexuality and gendered subjectivity in the Russian literary sphere, and of the ways in which possibility itself was made and remade by literary expression. The course also introduces students to methods of literary analysis informed by critical theories of gender, and asks how Russian literary and cultural history may offer new ways of thinking about gendered bodies, performance, and interrelations in the 19th Century and today.\n\nInstructor(s): Anne Eakin Moss Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): GNSE 20118, REES 37035\n\nREES 27203.

Politics and Cinema under Authority. 100 Units.\n\nWhy do authoritarian regimes take interest in art and culture? How do citizens respond to these efforts? Between authoritarian propaganda and outright contestation of authoritarianism is a wide niche of art and media production that is just independent enough to capture the attention of the citizens and yet subtle enough to not alarm authoritarian rulers. This is relevant for film and television in particular, which cannot function under authoritarian regimes without official approval. In this course, we explore the compromises filmmakers make to continue their creative practice and the concessions state actors grant to accommodate artistic work using the 10-episode television series, Dekalog (1988), by the acclaimed Polish director Krzysztof Kieślowski. To answer our questions, we draw on literature and methodology from political science and film and media studies. We investigate what is to be gained by combining approaches from two disciplines that are rarely in conversation with each other.\n\nInstructor(s): Maria Belodubrovskaya and Monika Nalepa Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nNote(s): Enrollment limit: 18\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CDIN 28801, CMST 38800, CDIN 38800, CMST 28805, REES 38800, PLSC 38801, PLSC 28805\n\nREES 28914.

This course is an overview of Balkan folklore from historical, political, and anthropological perspectives. We seek to understand folk tradition as a dynamic process and consider the function of different folklore genres in the imagining and maintenance of community and the socialization of the individual. We also experience this living tradition firsthand through visits of a Chicago-based folk dance ensemble, \"Balkan Dance.\"\n\nInstructor(s): Angelina Ilieva Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): ANTH 35908, REES 39009, NEHC 20568, CMLT 33301, NEHC 30568, ANTH 25908, CMLT 23301\n\nREES 29010. Strangers to Ourselves: Emigre Literature and Film from Russia and Southeast Europe. 100 Units.\n\nBeing alienated from myself, as painful as that may be, provides me with that exquisite distance within which perverse pleasure begins, as well as the possibility of my imagining and thinking,\" writes Julia Kristeva in \"Strangers to Ourselves,\" the book from which this course takes its title. The authors whose works we are going to examine often alternate between nostalgia and the exhilaration of being set free into the breathless possibilities of new lives. Leaving home does not simply mean movement in space. Separated from the sensory boundaries that defined their old selves, immigrants inhabit a warped, fragmentary, disjointed time. Immigrant writers struggle for breath-speech, language, voice, the very stuff of their craft resounds somewhere else. Join us as we explore the pain, the struggle, the failure, and the triumph of emigration and exile.

The Shadows of Living Things: The Writings of Mikhail Bulgakov. 100 Units.\n\nWhat would your good do if evil did not exist, and what would the earth look like if all the shadows disappeared? After all, shadows are cast by things and people…. Do you want to strip the earth of all the trees and living things just because of your fantasy of enjoying naked light?\" asks the Devil. Mikhail Bulgakov worked on his novel The Master and Margarita throughout most of his writing career, in Stalin's Moscow. Bulgakov destroyed his manuscript, re-created it from memory, and reworked it feverishly even as his body was failing him in his battle with death. The result is an intense contemplation on the nature of good and evil, on the role of art and the ethical duty of the artist, but also a dazzling world of magic, witches, and romantic love, and an irresistible seduction into the comedic. Laughter, as shadow and light, as the subversive weapon but also as power's whip, grounds human relation to both good and evil. Brief excursions to other texts that help us better understand Master and Margarita.\n\nInstructor(s): Angelina Ilieva Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): FNDL 29020, REES 39021\n\nREES 29023. Returning the Gaze: The West and the Rest. 100 Units.\n\nAware of being observed. And judged. Inferior... Abject… Angry... Proud… This course provides insight into identity dynamics between the \"West,\" as the center of economic power and self-proclaimed normative humanity, and the \"Rest,\" as the poor, backward, volatile periphery. We investigate the relationship between South East European self-representations and the imagined Western gaze. Inherent in the act of looking at oneself through the eyes of another is the privileging of that other's standard. We will contemplate the responses to this existential position of identifying symbolically with a normative site outside of oneself-self-consciousness, defiance, arrogance, self-exoticization-and consider how these responses have been incorporated in the texture of the national, gender, and social identities in the region.

States of Surveillance. 100 Units.\n\nWhat does it feel to be watched and listened to all the time? Literary and cinematic works give us a glimpse into the experience of living under surveillance and explore the human effects of surveillance - the fraying of intimacy, fracturing sense of self, testing the limits of what it means to be human. Works from the former Soviet Union (Solzhenitsyn, Abram Tertz, Andrey Zvyagintsev), former Yugoslavia (Ivo Andrić, Danilo Kiš, Dušan Kovačević), Romania (Norman Manea, Cristian Mungiu), Bulgaria (Valeri Petrov), and Albania (Ismail Kadare).\n\nInstructor(s): Angelina Ilieva Terms Offered: Autumn\n\nEquivalent Course(s): REES 39024, CMLT 29024, CMLT 39024\n\nREES 29026. Loyalties, Friendships, Loves. 100 Units.\n\nThe Eastern European experience of surveillance under the police state is most often associated with the sense of betrayal, the invasion of the innermost spaces of intimacy and individual consciousness by the secret all-seeing eye. What is often overlooked, however, is the obverse side of fear - the fierce code of loyalty, the tenacity of friendship and love nurtured in the interstices of surveillance and resistance. How are love and friendship understood in such circumstances? Are they experienced in the same way as we understand them? This class will explore these emotional cultural scripts through an array of East, Central, South-East European literary and cinematic works.\n\nInstructor(s): Angelina Ilieva Terms Offered: Spring\n\nEquivalent Course(s): REES 39026, CMLT 29026\n\nREES 29035. Empathetic Sorrows: Recent Bulgarian Literature. 100 Units.\n\nWhat does it feel to write from \"the saddest place in the world\"? In 2010, The Economist published an article entitled \"The Rich, the Poor, and Bulgaria,\" in which Bulgaria bucked the paradigm of predicted correlation between income and happiness. \"The saddest place in the world, relative to its income per person,\" the Economist reported, \"is Bulgaria.\" Storytelling invites us to step outside ourselves and inhabit someone else's way of relating to the world. This course will explore the gentle, melancholic empathy with which Bulgarian post-socialist literature seeks otherness in the (no longer heroic) past and the (even less heroic) present.\n\nInstructor(s): Angelina Ilieva Terms Offered: TBD\n\nEquivalent Course(s): REES 39035\n\nREES 29045. Dostoevsky and Critical Theory. 100 Units.\n\nThe tormented, obsessed, and sadistic characters of Dostoevsky's novels posed a challenge to positivism and reason too scandalous and compelling to be ignored. The novels inspired some of the most brilliant and influential thinkers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in the fields of religion, philosophy, psychology and literary theory. We will read two of Dostoevsky's philosophically challenging novels alongside works by these critics and philosophers, including Nietzsche, Sartre, Freud, Bakhtin, Kristeva, and Levinas. While exploring their ideas about faith and unbelief, madness and reason, violence and torture, society and history, we will also inquire into the relationships among literature, philosophy and biography and examine the processes of influence and adaptation.\n\nInstructor(s): Anne Eakin Moss Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): CMLT 29045, REES 39045, RLST 28207, CMLT 39045\n\nREES 29071. Magic Nations. 100 Units.\n\nAs part of the post-colonial turn, magic realism is a hybrid mode of narration rejects, overcomes, and offers an alternative to the colonial, Enlightenment episteme. It mobilizes the imaginations and narrative modes of pre-colonial pasts in the articulation of new, post-colonial, often national, selves. In this course, we will unpack some captivating narratives from Southeast Europe in which the visions of the pre-modern mythic worlds emerge as the magic, transcendent core of the modern nations. We will indulge in the sheer enjoyment of the brilliance of these text while focusing on the paradoxes they embody - for example, the simultaneous rejection and reliance on the realist mode, the colonial worldview, and its civilizational hierarchies and models.\n\nInstructor(s): Angelina Ilieva Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): REES 39071, CMLT 29071\n\nREES 29646. Tutorial - Science and Literature in Twentieth Century Russia. 100 Units.\n\nThis course examines the interactions between the science and literature of late Imperial Russia and the early Soviet Union. The relationship between sciences and humanities is difficult to disentangle. Are they antithetical, or allies? Disparate or proximate? The possibilities that science offers for literature, and literature for science, are exemplified in their interactions in Russia. The dynamic culture of the waning Empire and the turbulence of the nascent Soviet Union are captured in the literature of the early 20th century, as authors and scientists contend with the social and political upheaval. Literature embodies the engagements between science and humanities, inspiring, reflecting, and reinterpreting scientific aspirations. Readings will be balanced between primary fictional texts, including novels, short stories, plays, films, and poetry, and secondary scholarship on the history of science. Authors include Mikhail Bulgakov, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Anna Akhmatova, and more, while we will explore Cold War and contemporary historiography though scholars such as David Joravsky, Loren Graham, and Nikolai Krementsov.\n\nInstructor(s): Reese Fulgenzi Terms Offered: Spring.

BA Paper Workshop. 100 Units.\n\nStudents pursuing honors must write an acceptable BA paper in their final year under the supervision of a faculty member in the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures. At the latest by the Autumn Quarter, students should begin the BA process by consulting with the director of undergraduate studies. Students may register for the BA Paper seminar (REES 29900 BA Paper Workshop) with the approval of the BA supervisor. This course will confer general College elective credit, but it will not count toward the major. If the completed bachelor's paper is judged by the supervisor and a second faculty member to be a distinguished example of original research or criticism, the student is recommended to the College for graduation with honors in Russian and East European Studies. The final decision regarding the granting of any degree with honors rests with the Collegiate divisional master.\n\nInstructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: Autumn Spring Winter\n\nREES 29902. The Time of Death. 100 Units.\n\nThis course is designed to meet the specific needs of a student in the College, an advanced learner of Serbian language and culture, double majoring in Economics and REES. The curriculum of this one-quarter class focuses on the literary work of 20th-century Serbian writer Borislav Pekić. Through a close reading of his first novel, The Time of Miracles (1965), we plan to uncover not only Pekić's notable artistic skills, but also the variety of his linguistic devices- ranging from highly ornate imitations of biblical diction to expressions bordering on urban slang-adjusted to depict the historical and cultural context of his era. In the novel the Christian myth becomes a vehicle for exposing the moral hypocrisy, cruelty, and futility of modern myths, especially those built around the Communists' ideal of their own \"promised land.\" The inevitable flatness of allegorical presentation is always counterbalanced by an enormous vividness of realistic detail, while implied irony makes this somber book surprisingly light-thus it showcases hallmarks of Pekić's unique style.\n\nInstructor(s): Nada Petkovic Terms Offered: Winter\n\nREES 29976. XCAP: The Narratives and Aesthetics of Contagion: Knowledge Formation in the Time of COVID-19. 100 Units.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented event in our lifetimes, one that has permeated our personal, national, and global discourse about health, disease, and dying. From individual fears and anxieties, to community lockdowns, to the steady march of infection and death statistics, the pandemic is everywhere, and we have been inundated with images and information about the virus, its contagious spread, and the impact on our society. Yet what do we make of all of this information? Where does it come from? And how does it help us understand the current moment? This course will explore how (dis)information about the virus and pandemic is created, disseminated, and shapes our perceptions, with a particular focus on narratives and aesthetics within a variety of information ecosystems. We will explore, in a broadly chronological format, important narratives and iconography that emerged and continue to evolve during the course of the ongoing pandemic and that contribute to our individual and collective understanding of social, cultural, political, and scientific aspects of the pandemic. We will further consider how this information relates to personal and collective knowledge formation that subsequently informs our attitudes about and behaviors during the pandemic. In particular, we will discuss how medical knowledge is formed and used to care for patients within a rapidly changing clinical environment. Clinical and public health ethics will provide an important framework for asses\n\nInstructor(s): William Nickell, Brian Callender Terms Offered: Winter\n\nEquivalent Course(s): KNOW 29976, HLTH 29976, HIPS 26076"
