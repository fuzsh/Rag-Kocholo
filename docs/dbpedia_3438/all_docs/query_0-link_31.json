The course focuses on three kinds of changes: in women's work and the gendered division of labor; in relationships between gender, politics, and the state; and the rise of consumer and mass cultures. Students will read what historians and other scholars have written about women and analyze historians' sources in the form of documents and images. We will pay particular attention to differences among women in such areas as race and ethnicity, class, religion, and sexuality. Students should acquire a deeper understanding of the forces influencing women's lives and gender norms and a better appreciation of how women and gender have shaped the history of the United States.\n\nDEC: K & 4\n\nSBC: SBS, USA\n\n3 credits\n\n​\n\nHIS 201: The Ancient Near East\n\nAn overview of the world's first civilization, from the invention of writing to the conquests of Alexander the Great (d. 323 BCE).

It approaches the colonial era of Latin America and the Carib-bean as a unique historical turning point in human history. For the first time in world history, the destinies of three continents (Europe, Africa, and America) became inextricably linked. At the same time, the expansion of Europe into the New World in the 16th century also signaled the end of a millennial history of native civilizations, as the Aztec, Mayan, and Inca civilizations seemed almost to collapse under the weight of Spanish militarism, colonial bureaucracy, and the Christian crusades.\n\nDEC: J\n\nSBC: GLO, SBS\n\n3 credits\n\n​\n\nHIS 214: Modern Latin America\n\nAn introduction to the major themes in the history of modern Latin America, from the early nineteenth century to the present.

Themes include the impact of ethnic conflicts in the British Isles and overseas empire on the emergence of one of the first unambiguous 'nation-states' in Europe and the only one to avoid revolutionary upheaval in the 18th and 19th centuries; the Industrial Revolution and its aftermath; the rise of democracy and parliamentary parties, including the Labour Party; women's rights and suffrage; the impact of two World Wars; and the creation of a welfare state with cradle-to-grave social security that is destroyed by decolonialism and racism. The politics and experience of class, gender, race and nation are the lenses through which this history is developed, bringing the history of the British Isles and empire into a single frame.\n\nDEC: I\n\nSBC: GLO, SBS\n\n3 credits\n\n​\n\nHIS 235: The Heirs of Rome: The Early Medieval World, 300-1000\n\nA survey of the history of Europe and the Mediterranean in the early Middle Ages (300-1000).

Within various colonial contexts, the drive to find, collect, and, where possible, commodify native plants, animals, and peoples played critical roles in larger contests to control people and places. As competing imperial powers sought to exploit natural resources and reshape entire regions in the service of empire, Indians and enslaved Africans variously resisted or contributed to those efforts. This course explores how changing concepts of the natural world impacted the development of science, medicine, and technology and influenced concepts of race, gender, class, and human adaptability. Readings will include current works by historians and other scholars as well as primary documents ranging from fantastical early travel narratives, to revealing accounts of Indian and African American medical/spiritual practitioners, to increasingly empirical studies by surveyors, engineers, and scientists in the 19th century.\n\nSBC: ESI, SPK, STAS\n\n3 credits\n\n​\n\nHIS 241: Nazi Genocide and the Holocaust\n\nThe rise of modern anti-Semitism since the late 18th century and its political application in Nazi Germany.

Through an integration of theoretical approaches and selected case studies, we will analyze how and why popular culture is not \"neutral\" in Latin America, but rather is linked to the larger problem of national identity. In doing so, the course will traverse the territory of nationalism, cultural imperialism, and cultural hybridity. The class focuses on the following sites of popular culture in particular: music, comics, telenovelas, cinema, sports, and food.\n\nDEC: J\n\nSBC: DIV, GLO, SBS\n\n3 credits\n\n​\n\nHIS 261: Change and Reform in the United States, 1877-1919\n\nThe growth of industrialism, class conflict, and ethnic diversity in America and the rise of social reform movements to address these changing conditions.

It is moral, intellectual, creative activity. It is also a response to personal and social relationships and to political and economic developments. It is a mode of interpreting our common experience, and even changing it. This course analyzes the way 19th-century popular entertainment culture--from dancing, boxing, and gambling to novels, newspapers, and circus acts--reflected and shaped American society.

What connected famous explorers like Marco Polo, Ibn Battuta, and Christopher Columbus to people who traveled the globe as part of their daily lives as merchants, diplomats, and sailors? Travel was a central feature of the medieval world and one of the primary factors that contributed to cultural contact, communication, exchange, and the diffusion of ideas between Europe, Africa and Asia in the pre-modern era. This course will explore the interconnected histories of the medieval world, focusing primarily on the Mediterranean world¿Latin Christendom, Byzantium and the Islamic world¿between roughly 500 and 1700. It will also devote attention to travel and travelers in the Atlantic world (including West Africa), the Indian Ocean, Central Asia, and China during the same period. Whether the motivation was exploration, piety, knowledge, survival, or profit, the act of travel involved the travelers in larger processes of interaction and exchange between cultures. We will examine the lives and accounts of pilgrims, merchants, scholars, slaves, and soldiers to investigate what motivated people to travel to, from, or within regions throughout the medieval world, and how they portrayed their experiences. With an emphasis on primary sources and class discussion, we will explore the writings of a diverse group of travelers and situate them within their larger social, cultural, and political contexts, while at the same time coming to terms with their reasons for travel and their particular world view.\n\nPrerequisite: U3 or U4 standing; 1 D.E.C.

At war with indigenous peoples in its empire for almost the entire century, and faced with restive and even revolutionary laborers, Irish Home Rulers and suffragettes on the domestic front, Victorians formulated imaginary solutions to the real social and political problems faced at home and in the colonies, and these formulations of monsters, social or supernatural impacted nothing less than western conceptions of modernity itself. National and imperial developments across hemispheric and transoceanic space provide the larger contexts for the two assigned novels (about monsters) and historical narratives and primary sources (about Victorian society). Finally, the course also teaches historians how to use literary fiction as historical sources (a methodology distinct from but linked to that of literature departments), in conjunction with primary and secondary historical works.\n\nPrerequisite: U3 or U4 standing; 1 D.E.C. F or SBS course\n\nSBC: DIV, SBS+\n\n3 credits\n\n​\n\nHIS 310: Britain Since 1945: Postcolonial Disruptions\n\nExamines the 'great events' of the post World War period and the patterns of social, economic, and political change through the lens of British experience. In particular, we will attend to the impact of decolonization on issues of race, class and gender within British domestic culture. Britain entered the 20th century as the world's premier imperial power, the barometer of global technological, cultural, political and intellectual developments. As the empire disintegrated, wracked by world wars and nationalist revolts, the British state took up a different kind of revolution -- a 'socialist' revolution--that sought to give its citizens economic and social security 'from the cradle to the grave.' At the same time, British society was significantly enlivened, and further transformed, by the influx of immigrants from former colonies and the Commonwealth. The second half of the twentieth century thus marked the successes and failures of the twinned projects of socialism and decolonization, while also producing new kinds of mass cultural exports that continue to shape global culture. These narratives of changing configurations of empire, class, race, gender and politics are the subject of our course, and will be explored through imaginative and historical literature and film.\n\nPrerequisite: U3 or U4 standing; 1 D.E.C.

This course traces the development of what some have termed the 'New Jim Crow' and a 'prison empire' by viewing American history through the lens of race, crime, punishment policing, and prisons.\n\nPrerequisite: U3 or U4 standing; 1 D.E.C.

In other words, they have changed throughout human history, and they are not just defined by scientists and doctors but by many more actors. This course has two goals: to introduce students to the study of disease and health as historical phenomena and to examine Africa's importance within global and regional histories of these subjects.

Some of the themes we will examine are: the clash of native and European legal systems; the adoption and adaptation of European law, particularly English law, to the circumstances of the American colonies; the development of the profession of law; changing definitions of crime and penal practices; shifts in women's legal status and their relationship to everyday practices and opportunities for women; the changing legal status of children; and transformations in the law of servitude, slavery, race, and emancipation. Witches, judges, women, lawyers, bankrupts, laborers, Native Americans, servants and slaves are some of the groups we encounter in assessing the forces that shaped American legal culture and its institutions. No prior knowledge of law is necessary.\n\nPrerequisite: U3 or U4 standing; 1 D.E.C.

Cultural revolutions, student protests, Cold War battles fought in the Third World and Eastern Europe, and the radicalization of civil rights struggles all converged. How do we make sense of the 1960s as a transnational, global set of experiences whose revolutionary heroes from Che Guevara to The Beatles and imagery were deeply intertwined? This course will examine various foundational texts from the period, including films, music and poster art, while exploring the multiple contexts of the 'Global Sixties,' from Cuba to Prague, Paris to Berkeley, Beijing to Mexico City.\n\nPrerequisite: U3 or U4 standing; 1 D.E.C.

Despite the contemporary nature of this debate over privacy versus security, there is a long and contested history of U.S. domestic spying. This course considers that history. The class will place the development of a surveillance state in the historical context of wars as well as on racial and ethnic demographic and political changes.\n\nPrerequisite: U3 or U4 standing; 1 D.E.C.

This course uses that familiarity as a starting point and follows the history of the Maya from ancient times to the present. We begin with an overview of what scholars know about the ancient Maya before tracing their experiences since the Spanish conquest, placing emphasis on Spanish colonization in the lowland areas of Mesoamerica, Mexico's War of the Castas, and the diverse experiences of the modern Maya including the Guatemalan Civil War and the Chiapas uprising, the impact of foreign tourism, and the experience of transnational migration.
