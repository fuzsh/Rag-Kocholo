The Spokane Coliseum, also known as "the Boone Street Barn", was an indoor arena located in Spokane, Washington. It opened in 1954 and had a capacity of 5,400. It was host to a number of teams including the Spokane Chiefs of the Western Hockey League. The arena served as the home of the men's basketball program of Gonzaga University from its entry into NCAA Division I competition in 1958 until the opening of the on-campus John F. Kennedy Memorial Pavilion, later the Charlotte Y. Martin Centre, in 1965.

The Coliseum was replaced by the Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena in 1995 and demolished that same year. The space which the Coliseum occupied became a parking lot for the new arena.
