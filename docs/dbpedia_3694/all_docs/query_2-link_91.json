        "text": "Happy Holidays!\n\nHOME / Happy Holidays!\n\nDecember 28th, 2017\n\nTHE PERFECT GAME FOUNDATION® sends you all good wishes for this Holiday Season and\n\nshares with you some thoughtful insights from an Advisor and some of out Fellows.\n\nWe thank you for you support.\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nThe Perfect Game Foundation\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nBetsy Nagelsen McCormack\n\nADVISOR\n\nIn her own words\n\nChristmas is my favorite time of the year. It’s the time to celebrate the birth of Christ. It’s the season to singsongs of joy and to bless my family and friends with gifts. Christmas is also the time when I’ve received my greatest “gift.” December is the special month my lovely daughter Maggie was born. It’s been said its “better to give than to receive.” I believe this.\n\nMaggie and I try to practice “giving” every month – not only in December – because so much has been given to us. As a former professional tennis player, I feel it’s my life’s purpose to “give” back to the game of tennis. I do this through my training facility, R&B Tennis, located in Wellington, FL. We try to prepare young and aspiring players for careers in professional tennis and equally important, for the game of life. I’m thrilled to be part of The Perfect Game Foundation and its work.\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nMallory Cecil\n\nFELLOW\n\nIn her own words\n\nPlaying a sport and working in the Business of Sports are two very different experiences.\n\nHaving played tennis collegiately and professionally, I knew that I wanted to start\n\nmy career in the Sports Industry, but I did not have a clue where to start.\n\nI was first introduced to the Perfect Game Foundation as a junior in college, when\n\nI was starting to consider career opportunities. Seven years later, and into my\n\ncareer, TPGF is still my most valuable resource when I am seeking career mentorship\n\nand networking. The wealth of knowledge and genuine desire to help young professionals\n\nsucceed is what I love most about this foundation, and why I am proud to be a part\n\nof it. I have also had the privilege to speak with upcoming/recent graduates who\n\nare looking for the same kind of mentorship and insight I was seeking when I was\n\nin their position. I currently work in Operations for the Women’s Tennis Association\n\n(WTA), and my intern at the moment, is a young lady that I was connected with through\n\nthe foundation. The quality of talent that comes through the program speaks for\n\nitself. The Perfect Game Foundation is one that keeps on giving.\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nLiam Gibney\n\nFELLOW\n\nIn his own words\n\nEver since I was old enough to understand the complexities of the sports industry,\n\nI have been fascinated with it. Since I was young, it has been my goal to work in\n\nsports because I have always been told that there is nothing better than loving\n\nwhat you do for a living. The Perfect Game Foundation has aided me by giving me\n\na crucial push in the right direction in gaining both experience and exposure within\n\nthe sporting world.\n\nThrough the Perfect Game Foundation, I was able to take on an internship at Columbia\n\nUniversity in the Sports Management Graduate Program. I worked for the office of\n\nVince Gennaro, who is the Dean and Director of the program. Gennaro is the President\n\nof The Society of American Baseball Research (SABR), and the author of Diamond Dollars:\n\nThe Economics of Winning in Baseball. My experience at Columbia helped me to not\n\nonly develop my skill set within the sports industry and to experience a professional\n\noffice environment but also helped me to begin developing a network of relationships\n\nwith professionals and graduate students in the field of sports business from whom\n\nI can learn as I progress.\n\nThis holiday season, I wish to stress the importance of what it means to have a\n\nfamily and that we should never take it granted. My family has given me more than\n\nI could ever ask for, but most importantly they have given me unconditional love\n\nand support. That is something that no one could ever put a price tag on, and it\n\nis something that I owe everything to. That is why this holiday season I ask that\n\nwhen you get together with your family, make sure that you remind them that you\n\nlove them and that you are thankful for everything that they do.\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nMax Gaitan\n\nFELLOW\n\nIn his own words\n\nSport and exercise is central to my life, both personally and professionally. My\n\npassion for endurance sports led me to complete a Master’s in Exercise Physiology.\n\nStarting in January, I will be taking my sport and exercise skills off the field\n\nand into the research lab, where I’ll study the impact of exercise on Alzheimer’s\n\nDisease.\n\nThis Holiday Season I’m especially grateful for the work of The Perfect Game Foundation,\n\nwhich has vastly expanded my professional network. My involvement with the Foundation\n\nwill undoubtedly impact my career path for years to come, as I’ve been given the\n\nopportunity to meet individuals from all corners of the sport industry. Everyone\n\nI’ve encountered through the Foundation embodies the ideals of giving and service\n\nto others, and I hope that in this Holiday Season and New Year we all continue to\n\ngrow in these ideals.\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nMollie Lane\n\nFELLOW\n\nIn her own words\n\nWishing you and yours a healthy, happy, fulfilling Holiday Season!\n\nAfter graduating this past May from Brown University, I now work as a Junior Associate in the healthcare practice at Weber Shandwick. Over the past summer, Del and The Perfect Game Foundation were key in helping me navigate my career path. As a former collegiate Division I lacrosse player and all-around sports enthusiast, I knew that the sports business industry fascinated me. Del helped me to narrow my interests, network with other professionals in the field, apply and for various positions, prepare for interviews, and set myself up for success. While I did not end up in sport business, I learned that it’s critical to take advantage of all networking opportunities and be a sponge for learning. There is something that you can take away from each and every conversation, even if it doesn’t seem like something that interests you. And finally, don’t burn any bridges and build a rapport with everyone!\n\nQ &A with TPGF Fellow Caitlin Fischer\n\nHOME / Q &A with TPGF Fellow Caitlin Fischer\n\nMay 24th, 2017\n\nCaitlin and the Foundation connected early last summer with the assistance of TPGF Advisor Hank Torbert. She is a UVA graduate whose hometown is Leesburg, VA. Early on Caitlin assisted TPGF with the TPGF Golf Tournament at TPC Potomac in July and followed that by becoming the Editor/Publisher of “The Inside Pitch” Foundation newsletter. She took a job working for Bessemer Trust in Chicago in April and is setting into the Windy City quickly! An enthusiastic athlete, coach and sports fan her favorite baseball team is the St Louis Cardinals!\n\nTPGF – Caitlin, you’re a UVA grad. Tell us how you selected UVA and give us a few comments on college life in Charlottesville?\n\nGreat question, right off the bat! There is just one disclaimer: I did grow up a Hokie because my mom played basketball for Virginia Tech. However, I remember visiting UVA for the first time in the sixth grade and I was in awe of the Rotunda, the Lawn, and the sheer kindness of those in the community. The atmosphere and academics seemed to fit my character and what I found was I wanted a well-rounded education that was focused on the liberal arts and the humanities paired with applied coursework.\n\nMy parents were very supportive and not once did my mom dissuade me from attending Mr. Jefferson’s university (she rightfully encouraged it!). Truth be told, I met the greatest people on the Grounds at UVA and thoroughly enjoyed every second of my undergraduate career. Charlottesville is rather near and dear to my heart and the best a college town has to offer. GO HOOS!\n\nTPGF – We know you’re a basketball coach in your spare time – how did you get started doing that?\n\nBasketball has been a huge part of my life. My mom absolutely loved the game and I was always around it growing up, whether it was playing it or watching it. I started coaching in high school because one of my friends asked if I would help out with a developmental league. I loved kids and sports, but I was a little apprehensive at first about coaching third grade boys. My friend and I continued to coach 3rd, 4th, and 7th grade boys teams in the Loudoun County area during my high school years. This past winter, my mom and I coached my younger brother’s freshmen high school team. My mom is truly the greatest coach – teaching the fundamentals, the importance of playing good defense, and how those who give the most heart and are humble about their successes will be the greatest players. I also have to say it was great coaching my little brother because of his attitude and level-headedness.\n\nTPGF – What other sports did you play and what do you do now when you work out?\n\nSoccer and basketball were my two main sports. I started playing soccer at age four on an all boys team in because I missed the sign-up for the girls league since I was moving to Charlotte, NC. I always played basketball growing up but I started playing in a league in third grade once I moved back to Northern Virginia. I preferred team sports because of the camaraderie and the friendships. Nowadays, I try to keep up with running, I really like long, endurance runs because as they are as good mentally as they are physically\n\nTPGF – As you started your job search there were several career paths options that you found interesting. How did you finally settle on Wealth Management?\n\nI knew I wanted to work for a firm where I would feasibly be able to help and serve others. My first semester of my fourth year in college, I was looking into private equity because of how intriguing the line of work seemed to be. However, I found that those roles had minimal relationship development and were heavy on the quantitative side for an entry-level analyst position. I rerouted to exploring marketing positions, but I found that those firms were also serving relatively large clients. In regards to wealth management, my dad’s background was in private wealth management and I was able to see how appreciative and grateful he was for his clients and even to this day he keeps in close contact. I also had the pleasure of speaking with Mike Okun at Bessemer Trust, who was a tremendous help in not only passing along my information, but describing Bessemer as a firm that is bar none in the industry today. I could not be happier and I absolutely love the people and the type of work I am doing on a day to day basis at Bessemer. Private wealth is the perfect medium for those who are both social and analytical but want a more personal business relationship and that is what I found I enjoyed the most. I am very, very thankful for this opportunity and the people who supported me along the way.\n\nTPGF – What advice do you have regarding the ‘search process’ for those who follow you?\n\nPatience is a virtue. That is by far the biggest piece of advice I can give. However, I may add that you have to actively pursue or at least “keep swimming,” throughout the entire process. Also, do not underestimate mentors, I have been so lucky to have so many great people who truly want me to succeed and who have given me opportunities I otherwise would have never had.\n\nTPGF – You’ve moved into a new city – Tell us about that process?\n\nIt has been a major change, especially since I am so close to my family and friends back on the east coast. My move has made me appreciate how much I have even though I moved to a completely new city. My parents were extremely supportive, along with the rest of my family and friends. Fair warning: when you visit home, everyone will have a million and one questions to ask you. I would say, once I settle down and get into the swing of things I will feel more at ease. What is nice is that there are so many areas to explore and things to do in Chicago – there is never a dull moment!\n\nTPGF – Rumor has it that you may be a STL Cardinals fan? Is that true? How did that happen since you grew up in the DC area?\n\nOne hundred and ten percent true! My dad grew up in a small farm town about an hour outside of St. Louis. From a very young age, I was told the only baseball team I could cheer for was the Cards. I can’t complain because they are one of the most well respected sports franchises.\n\nTPGF – Any advice you have for those about to go through the interview process? Both with regard to finding jobs of interest and the interview itself?\n\nAs aforementioned, you have to be patient and there is nothing wrong with being particular during the process, as long as you are willing to take the time and put forth the effort. In regards to the interview, I would say you have to show up to the interview with questions that really make the interviewers think. Especially in regards to their firm and the culture they try to instill. Moreover, read up on what is happening in the news about their firm and do not be afraid to ask loaded questions because you should be interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you. Also, the more and more you fine tune your story the easier it will be able to convey that you are interviewing for the right reasons and not just because you had a time slot. You always have to be mindful of other people’s time and graciously thank them!\n\nTPGF – The Foundation believes strongly in ‘Pay it Forward’ – you subscribe to that concept?\n\nAbsolutely! No question about it.\n\nInterview with Mayu Fielding\n\nHOME / Interview with Mayu Fielding\n\nMay 24th, 2017\n\nMayu Fielding is the Education Coordinator for the Pittsburgh Pirates. As such, she manages an extraordinary program from Pirate City in Bradenton, FL. Born and raised in Venezuela Mayu graduated from Universidad Metropolitana (VE) in Caracas. She is a teacher first and foremost. Her passion is communication, culture and appreciation for all that we have in our lives.\n\nThe Perfect Game Foundation talked with Mayu and discussed the following subjects:\n\nTPGF – Mayu how did you and the Pirates connect in Bradenton?\n\nMayu – 10 years ago, the Pirates ran an ad in the Bradenton paper looking for an Administrative Assistant at Pirate City. I thought it might be a good seasonal/part time job, while I searched for a full time teaching position, so I applied. Well – I immediately loved the work and the Pirates interest in excellence. My job as an Administrative Assistant became more and more involved with the players development. The position for Education Coordinator was created and here I am going on 10 years with the organization! The Pirates are wonderful and I could not be happier doing this work.\n\nTPGF – Approximately how many Pirate players do you work with each year?\n\nMayu – It varies but about 120 is a good estimate and they start as young as 16 years of age. A lot of the work is done at Pirate City but I also travel to all our minor league cities. This past week I was in Charleston, WV working with our Class A team.\n\nAdditionally I frequently go to the Pirate Academy in the Dominican Republic and work with our young players down there.\n\nOur focus with the players is always on life skills so they can become more independent in their daily lives.\n\nI also work with our teachers who are working directly with our players helping them with life skill issues and self-confidence. The Pirates have local teachers in all the minor league cities as well as in the Dominican.\n\nTPGF – What advice would you pass on to those young people who would like to work in sports?\n\nMayu – Attention to detail! Developing a solid work ethic! There is nothing more disappointing than seeing projects or documents show up with misspelling, grammar errors, punctuation mistakes etc., so that attention to detail is really important (and not just in a sports career!) The work ethic issue also important as it sets the tone for what your colleagues can count on from you during your working career. It also sets the stage for developing a ‘go above and beyond’ attitude about your work.\n\nAt the end of the day the most important things we can do with and for each other is to communicate well and often! Especially in this digital age, when person-to-person communication is becoming a lost art!\n\nQ & A with John Angelos\n\nHOME / Q & A with John Angelos\n\nApril 23rd, 2017\n\nInterview with John Angelos\n\nJohn P. Angelos is the Executive Vice President of the Baltimore Orioles, a position he has held since April 1999, leading the club’s front office and overseeing day-to-day business operations. He also serves as President and Chief Operating Officer of the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network (MASN), overseeing the network’s business operations. John went to college at Duke and then got his JD at the U of Baltimore School of Law.\n\nQ: John – I know our readers would love to hear about your early years. How you picked Duke, what you majored in and how you decided to go on and get a law degree?\n\nA: I selected Duke in the aftermath of attending an all boys prep school for twelve years. Gilman School in Baltimore had a strong focus on preparing students to attend some of the most highly regarded colleges and universities and among those Duke offered an early action program. Through that program, I was accepted very early in my senior year and after visiting just a handful of schools including Duke and a few Ivy League possibilities, I made a decision based on Duke’s reputation, size, and campus environment. While that decision did work out for me, in retrospect I likely did not visit enough diverse schools and really consider schools based outside of the east coast, of various sizes, or offering differing emphases on curriculum, mission, and campus culture. Today, I advise college candidates to visit as many different types of schools as economically possible, including urban and rural, small and large, private, parochial, and public, and schools on both coasts and all regions of the country of any interest as this will challenge the many assumptions we make as teenagers about what is important. I also advise some students to consider taking a gap year, or traveling the world, or taking advantage of one or several paid or volunteer internships and deferring entering college immediately after high school as this may be a better choice for some. College is a great opportunity and a great time in life, and it will be the best of both when entered into with a lot of thought and without following a any one accepted approach to learning.\n\nQ: Since you sort of grew up in a baseball family what was that like – baseball talk at the kitchen table?\n\nA: Baseball talk and sports talk in general is a great thing, and when it is experienced with those across generations it takes on the added dimensions of expanding not only the pool of player knowledge and different ways in which the game was played and the business of baseball was conducted from Era to Era but expanding the inevitably different points of view we each have in part simply because of circumstances of when we were born and how and when we grew up. Baseball is a game of vast data and statistics but that data is just a way to express the vast company of characters who have populated the history of the game. Baseball is a game of the people because it engages the most fans, players, scouts, coaches, and staff, and that bigger than life scale of the national passion makes baseball talk the best of all sports banter. For me, adding in the dimension of team ownership and family business certainly overlaid a few unique aspects to the conversation, including the role of finances, public relations, team operation, and others, but over the past many years that I have been involved and whether in my twenties, thirties, forties, or later years, that the best way to sort through the business issues that overlay the game is to filter out the business bias as much as possible and view the game just as you did when you were a kid, long before team ownership was a gleam in the eye, for by viewing the game as every kid in America does you will most easily stress what is most important in arriving at the best solution to whatever the business or baseball issue may be.\n\nQ: You not only run the Orioles but you also run MASN – what is a typical work day in your life?\n\nA: The Orioles ownership group has over the past quarter century developed a multi-platform approach to sports brand presentation that only a handful of other sports teams in the four major sports have been able to create. Developing and managing a team owned and managed subsidiary media network in the forms of a regional sports television network, an in house radio network, and an iconic sports venue in Oriole Park at Camden Yards is rewarding for the two primary reasons that such a platform allows those interested in the team to experience it in an integrated manner on all platforms presented by one guiding force as opposed to by many different participants with often competing interests and objections and also allows the media platform to backstop and secure the long term financial stability and presence of the team in the local community free of a threat of relocation from a smaller market to a larger one. The major benefit of MASN is that as long as it exists in strong financial form it insures the Orioles franchise could remain in a market the size of Baltimore permanently. MASN’s guiding business objective however is to promote the game of baseball in the form of 300 games of two MLB clubs, the Nationals and Orioles, across a seven state Mid Atlantic region and the fourteen Nielsen designated market areas that we reach. MASN promotes a two teams on on one network, with a chance for fans to see every club in MLB play and to see hundreds of games from the powerhouse AL and NL East divisions. My job is to make sure that MASN sells the concept of the power of MLB as the best entertainment form in America and promotes equivalently the two teams across those markets and reinforces the fact that MLB is the number one spectator sport and highest cumulatively rated sports media property in the US, just as that is the joint goal of MASN and both of its clubs.\n\nQ: Do you find the television world interesting?\n\nA: The larger media world contains within it the television industry, and the television industry in turn includes within it the sports media world. When a club management is running it’s sports team operation and it’s venue, and all that entails, and while that is a considerable and interesting involvement, without having direct access to the television and larger media industry the team is missing tremendous opportunity. My experiences over the past eleven years of having unique access to the sports team and sports television world’s has provided that opportunity for the club and has been just about the most interesting involvement I could imagine.\n\nQ: Since you are such a forward thinker – what challenges do you see ahead for Major League Baseball?\n\nA: The future off Major League Baseball and the broader game of baseball is incredibly bright. Last year, major and minor league baseball attracted almost 110 million paid fans to see a professional baseball game, and tens of millions more boys, girls, and their families in the US and around the world participated in college, amateur, and youth baseball. With that said, the challenges and opportunities ahead for Mlb and for the great game are considerable, and they are exciting as well. The five areas where Mlb and the game have vast opportunity to grow and improve our business performance by best practices are in my view: 1. Achieving significantly expanded, proactive, and professional industry-standard levels of promotion and marketing of the league, game, and sport domestically to all core and casual demographic groups around the country in support of every local club in their markets; 2. Reaching a state of on-field competitive balance in MLB that is equivalent to that already existing in the best sports leagues in the US and globally as the only realistic and responsible method of growing and protecting the business and popularity of the game of baseball and protecting it from a flattening and then decline in popularity, revenue, and general financial health; 3. Defining a sensible ballpark re-investment and franchise expansion business plan at the major, spring training, and minor league levels that makes all franchises part of a collective league-wide ballpark preservation masterplanning and funding effort that in turn protects the integrity of the league, the presentation of it’s jewel events, and the value of its local clubs by protecting the quality of it’s venues; 4. Reviewing the manner in which MLB and the clubs deploy substantial percentages of revenues to the research and development function of scouting and player development with the goal of better and more appropriately compensating our scouts, minor league coaches, and players who execute that function while making the research and development system far more efficient, less redundant, and more accurate in predicting future performance of amateur athletes at the professional level; 5. Realigning the international marketing of MLB and efforts to grow the game abroad around existing dominant institutions such as the Olympic Games, “dream team” methodology, expanded international amateur programming and marketing, and other international models to reach equivalency with the international efforts of the other major sports US leagues; 6. Reenvision multimedia content distribution in ways that serve the best interests of fans, consumers, players association members, and clubs.\n\nQ: You’ve built such a great team of people working on both the MASN and O’s side of things – what hiring strategies have you employed to end up with such great people working for you?\n\nA: The first and last guidelines in building business or baseball teams for me are the ones that a great baseball man, former Orioles general manager and farm director, and a friend explained to me. Syd Thrift used to explain how building successful teams that possessed chemistry was about recruiting for it by design not trying to create it after the group was built. Syd also was an advocate of measuring everything, coaching the coaches, and evaluating the evaluators using internal communication and external experts to constantly evaluate how the Orioles were doing as compared to other teams. Syd brought that mentality to the Orioles from his many decades with the best baseball minds and in his building the renowned Royals Academy that Ewing Kauffman supported, rejuvenating the Pirates, and many other accomplishments. I took that same mentality to MASN when I recruited the executive team and we launched the new twenty four hour, 365-day media network, and we have the same group together eleven years later.\n\nQ: You love the world of music – who is your favorite song writer/singer?\n\nA: My favorite songwriter is Margaret Valentine, who is also my wife. My favorite singers vary across many diversity talented people and genres, including everyone from Neko Case to Shirley Bassey, Billy Joel to Tom Waits, Johnny Cash to Neil Young, Roger Waters, Eddie Vedder, Edith Piaf, Led Zeppelin, and many more. The best live performances I have recently seen were Florence and the Machine at the Hollywood Bowl, Tom Waits and the Kronos Quartet at the Bridge School Benefit, and the Blind Boys of Alabama at the New Orleans Jazz Festival. The best album I recently listened to was Ryan Beaver’s Rx, and in my view we all need to get back to listening to albums and away from rushing past the great collected work artists create to sample this or that. As Robin Williams’ character in Dead Poets Society famously explained, science and math help us live and the arts are what makes life worth living. We would do well to live by those words and get out and support what songwriters, singers, and artists of every type do to better our lives and make society more livable.\n\nQ: For all of those young people reading this who aspire to work in the sports industry – what words of advice do you have for them?\n\nA: Read a lot of Books. Thirty or more every summer throughout your younger years. Never stop doing that. Give time to books and they will give you back much more time than you put in to them. Go as far in your education as possible as additional exposures, education, and credentials will distinguish you from your peers. Learn to write and communicate as well as you can as doing so will help you think clearly, and the ability to think clearly will permit you to be marketable to any employer in any field. Don’t worry with learning the substance of any one profession as you will be taught that later. Worry only about learning the thinking process applied to any and every profession and human endeavor. As an aside, learning how to read, think, analyze, question, write, and speak will not only make you marketable, distinguish you from others, and get you a job that is rewarding, it may also help you to save yourself and your society from those who will use demagoguery and propaganda to infringe your freedom and individual rights. So, start reading and never stop.\n\nQ: Last question – what National League team do you predict the O’s will play in the World Series this year?\n\nA: The San Francisco Giants. One of the best run organizations in sports, right up there with the Spurs, Steelers, and others, and the Giants focus on pitching, defense, and thinking outside the box between and beyond the lines. Moreover, the Os and Giants colors complement one another, and although I am a bit biased, I think we have the two best cities and two best ballparks anywhere.\n\nQ & A with Tyrone Brooks\n\nHOME / Q & A with Tyrone Brooks\n\nOctober 10th, 2016\n\nTyrone Brooks is everything The Perfect Game Foundation aspires to provide to its fellows, but he did it all on his own. He followed his passion to land a valued internship with the Atlanta Braves after he graduated from the University of Maryland with a double-major. Within weeks, he was hired as a full-time employee. His ravenous appetite for learning all aspects of the game was quickly noticed, and he moved into new and more important roles in short order, even a scouting role he wanted to master in order to better understand the player evaluation process\n\nIn 2016 he was lured away from the Pittsburgh Pirates to head up Major League Baseball’s diversity initiative. He is roundly considered one of the most talented “rising stars” on the MLB landscape.\n\nHe recently spoke with us, at length, about his career and his philosophies.\n\nTPGF: You had a double major at the University of Maryland, in accounting and marketing. When and how did baseball become a key mission in your life?\n\nTB: I started playing baseball at age 5, and I always loved the game. I played all the way through high school, but I knew I wasn’t quite good enough to play Division 1 ball, so I focused on my education.\n\nI’d always loved the University of Maryland. It was destined to be my school. I got into photography there, and since sports are a big part of the school, I was able to get into sports photography and that kept me closely involved. I thought about pursuing it as a career, but being actively involved in sports was my number one goal. I was determined to find a way to be directly involved.\n\nOver Christmas break, just a semester before I graduated, I found a book called the “Internship Bible.” Most of the intern jobs were Wall Street or business based, but I saw a listing posted by the Atlanta Braves, for a position Hank Aaron and Stan Kasten had put together. I applied, got an interview, and got the spot. It was just a three-month deal, so I knew I had to come in and make an impression.\n\nTPGF: TPGF exists to give people like you an introduction to the sports industry, to be the person you know. How did you do this without any help?\n\nTB: For me, it was a “right place at the right time” sort of thing. That’s part of it, but after that you still have to deliver.\n\nI understood where I was in life, and I understood my skill set. I knew what I could bring to the Braves, and I was eager to impress them. I love the game of baseball. I love its history.\n\nJust being in a Major League front office, even as an intern, was fascinating to me. Watching the draft unfold, and seeing what the Braves looked for in young men, was eye-opening.\n\nThen, another person in the front office left the club and I got the job.\n\nRight place, right time. But also, I knew I had to show the club what I could do to even be considered for such a job.\n\nTPGF: Your first position in baseball was with the Braves, as a trainee and intern in the baseball operations department. Within three months you were hired full-time to be an admin in the Scouting and Player Development department. How did that happen so fast?\n\nTB: I was eager to be as well-rounded as possible, and I let everyone know that. There was never a time when I thought “This is my box on the organizational chart and that’s all I’ll be.”\n\nThe Braves were a scouting based organization, and I realized the importance of it. They had a training system, a “scouts school” and I dove into that. Scouting is a craft, and to be successful you have to work at it. Thanks to the staff at the Braves, they worked with me and took the time to help me learn the craft.\n\nTPGF: You then went to the Pirates and it was all baseball jobs, rather than business or marketing. Was that the plan all along, or did it just happen?\n\nTB: By this time, I was all about being the best baseball person I could be. I wanted to know all the jobs, all the crafts, and be the best at it.\n\nThe original front-office environment was critical for me. Being there, with those life-long professionals who understood the game, helped me understand what a team should look for in a young player. I understood that, and was able to develop my own evaluation skills.\n\nI loved scouting, because I was out there on my own accepting the challenge. I loved being in the players’ homes, getting to know the families, and establishing those relationships. There’s a lot more to scouting than just seeing the talent. I loved that part of it.\n\nTPGF: Now, at MLB, you’re the Senior Director for Front Office and Field Staff Diversity Pipeline. What’s your mission in this position, and how do you go about planning for the future?\n\nTB: The mission is to help the teams identify and recruit talented people, whether they’re minorities or women. We need to help them get in the door to show what they can do. There’s been a lack of a true pipeline, historically, and we need to proactively feed that pipeline.\n\nI’m like the poster child for this program. For a hundred years, general managers were just ex-players who moved into the front office. Now, many of them started out like I did, as interns. The pipeline is shifting, and we have to be ahead of that curve to keep it going.\n\nThe key is the teams, not MLB. The teams have to be invested, they have to buy in, and that means getting out there to identify candidates and keep track of them.\n\nEvery team is involved in this. They need to be aggressive and inclusive. Historically, they’ve been able to take the easy road. Now, we have to reach out, identify, and enable.\n\nTPGF: There are various types of diversity issues, including race, gender, ethnicity, and now “non-baseball” people in key analytical roles, even as general managers. How do you see that?\n\nTB: I saw this whole revolution in baseball first-hand. It unfolded in front of me. There were these really smart people, Wall Street types who could make a fortune moving money, but they also realized they could use their skill sets in a different way. It wasn’t as financially rewarding, but it was far more rewarding in a different way.\n\n“Money Ball” changed the game. Information is power. The more you know, the more you can quantify, the better you’ll be.\n\nWith it came bigger front-office staffs, with a new type of staff. That changed the general manager’s job, because it wasn’t just about a staff of former players anymore.\n\nNow, we need to keep expanding. There are talented women who can run baseball teams and understand the metrics that make teams successful. You don’t need to have played in the big leagues, but you need to understand what makes a big league organization successful.\n\nWe need to be in tune with this and understand how information works.\n\nTPGF: Baseball has been seeing a decline in the number of African American players. Why do you think that is, and how can it be reversed? Since most field staff positions are filled by former players, this seems to be a critical trend.\n\nTB: This is a long-range plan that starts at the grass-roots level. We need to get more kids playing, just for the fun of playing the game. It doesn’t need to be formal and organized. Just get a ball and a bat and go play, like kids always used to do. We are finding ways to make that happen, and we’re seeing a lot of progress. It’s a wonderful game, and the best part of it is the playing.\n\nThe NBA and NFL have done a great job at marketing themselves to these kids. I give them credit for that.\n\nWe show these kids, through MLB programs, that baseball can be a key to a great education. With that, you can be successful in life.\n\nWe have programs in place where we can identify young players and provide the coaching and development they need. We’re working at it actively.\n\nTPGF: What would be your direct message to the younger Tyrone Brooks when he graduated from college? Are there any pitfalls you’d warn your younger self about?\n\nTB: Every kid needs to focus on their own skill set, and understand it. That’s a lot to expect from a high school or college kid, but I managed to do it and anyone else can do the same.\n\nBe aware of what you can do the best. Be ready to jump right in and do it.\n\nThis is all about the power of relationships, too. Meet people, get to know them, understand them, and make sure they understand you. Follow up. Stay in touch. Expand your network.\n\nIt all comes down to relationships. At some point, you’ll know a person who believes in you, and who can help you. The relationship you built with that person will be the key to your success.\n\nQ & A with Founding Advisor Bob Wilber\n\nHOME / Q & A with Founding Advisor Bob Wilber\n\nDecember 11th, 2015\n\nQ & A with Founding Advisor Bob Wilber\n\nBob Wilber is the youngest of Del and Taffy Wilber’s five children. As aFounding Advisor for The Perfect Game Foundation he brought a unique outlook to TPGF, having spent his entire life in the sports world. Once a former professional baseball player, coach, and scout, he has spent the last 20 years as a Team Manager and Public Relations Representative for championship-caliber Nitro Funny Car teams on the NHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing tour.\n\nTPGF: Bob, tell us the motivation for the creation of The Perfect Game\n\nFoundation.\n\nBW: They say you can’t pick your parents, and after we lost both Del and\n\nTaffy at the end of some traumatic years, the legitimacy of that cliche’ was\n\noverwhelmingly obvious to some of us. I don’t think there’s such a thing as\n\n“perfect parents” and Big Del and Taffy had a few flaws like any dad or mom,\n\nbut they raised us right, loved all of us, and were always very proud of\n\nwhat we accomplished. When they passed away, what struck us was the good\n\nfortune we all had to be so luckily born into this family. There’s no doubt\n\nthat doors opened for us, and good things happened, because we were Wilbers.\n\nAnother common cliche’ is “It’s not what you know, it’s who you know” and\n\nthat was true for us, no doubt. We wanted TPGF to be the “who you know” for\n\naspiring and talented young people who want to get a foot in the door in the\n\nsports world. Through TPGF, we could pay it forward and be that person who\n\ngives an otherwise unconnected applicant a shot. Our oldest brother Del Jr.\n\nwas absolutely the driving force behind this, and he steers the ship to this\n\nday. I’m proud to have simply helped out. My sisters Mary and Cindy have\n\nbeen deeply involved, and it’s been a real bonding thing for all of us.\n\nTPGF: Tell us about your childhood, in the Wilber household.\n\nBW: My folks bought the house I grew up in a couple of years before I was\n\nborn, and it was located in Kirkwood, Mo., a St. Louis suburb that was\n\nstraight from Hollywood, with tree-lined streets and safe neighborhoods. We\n\ndidn’t sell it until both of them were moved into an assisted-living\n\nfacility, so it was “home” well into my 40s, no matter where I happened to\n\nactually live. It was a small neighborhood with 10 houses and a cul de sac,\n\nand we didn’t own a key to the lock on the front door. It was always\n\nunlocked. What I remember most was how warm and loving the place was during\n\nthe winters. Big Del traveled so much as a scout, coach, or manager during\n\nthe other three seasons that we treasured his time at home during the\n\nbaseball off-season. We made the most of every minute he was there. I would\n\nsay the word “cherished” is probably more accurate. During the warmer\n\nmonths, when I was a boy, our house was headquarters for all the kids in the\n\nsurrounding neighborhoods. They’d all arrive on their bikes in the mornings\n\nand we’d play whatever sport was in season until it was time to go home.\n\nSeems pretty idyllic, looking back on it, and I think it was.\n\nTPGF: So you then went on to play baseball and stay in sports your entire\n\ncareer. Tell us about that.\n\nBW: Like all the Wilber kids, I was pretty athletic although I was really\n\nsick a lot as a little kid, with asthma and bad allergies. Because of that,\n\nI was a bit of a late bloomer, but I earned a full athletic scholarship to\n\nSouthern Illinois University – Edwardsville and was fortunate to be a part\n\nof two teams there that advanced to the NCAA Div. II World Series. It was a\n\ngood baseball school and I got my degree in TV/Radio Broadcasting. My plan\n\nwas to play 10 years in the Big Leagues and then go into the broadcast\n\nbooth, but I wasn’t quite that good. I got to play two seasons in the\n\nDetroit organization and one summer in the Oakland A’s system, but that was\n\nit. Just as I was about to start looking for a broadcasting job, the Toronto\n\nBlue Jays offered me a scouting job and I took that. Four years later, I was\n\nbeginning to realize the hit-or-miss part of the scouting profession wasnt\n\nreally for me, and that I needed to make a move while I was still young. I\n\nwent to work for Converse Shoes for a couple of rewarding years, then joined\n\nDel Jr’s sports marketing agency in Washington D.C. for three years. I ended\n\nup going into indoor soccer, running a couple of successful franchises in\n\nthe early 90s, and then as I closed in on 40 I saw my first drag race, when\n\nI was hired as the general manager of the track in Topeka. I truly never saw\n\nthe drag racing thing coming, but I’ve been doing it for 20 years.\n\nTPGF: So you never had seen a race before you landed your first job in\n\nracing?\n\nBW: That’s right. Bill Kentling had been the Commissioner of the Major\n\nIndoor Soccer League and he knew me and respected what I’d done in that\n\nsport. He called me one day and said “Son, I’ve got good news and bad news.\n\nThe good news is we’re going racing together. The bad news is we’re gonna do\n\nit in Topeka, Kansas.” First I said “Bill, I don’t know anything about\n\nracing” and he told me that’s why he’d called me. He didn’t want a racing\n\nfan, he wanted a marketing guy. We learned racing together. And as for\n\nTopeka, I was fine with that. I’m a Midwest boy, and it was a fine place to\n\nlive.\n\nTPGF: And how did that translate into your jobs with Funny Car teams?\n\nBW: I worked at Heartland Park Topeka for a year, and we did some great\n\nthings there, but working for the track wasn’t for me. I’m a team player,\n\nand by that I mean I like to win or lose as a part of a team. When you run\n\nthe track, you just pray it doesn’t rain. So I hooked on with a guy in New\n\nJersey, as his assistant, and that was my first taste of doing public\n\nrelations for professional drag racing teams. By 1996, after I’d gone back\n\ninto indoor soccer for a couple of years in Kansas City, I landed my first\n\ngig as the sole PR rep for a Funny Car team. For the last 20 years I’ve\n\nworked for two great guys, Del Worsham for 12 years and Tim Wilkerson since\n\nthen. You couldn’t work for two better people in this sport. And we’ve been\n\ngood enough to get to the Winner’s Circle so many times my wife wants me to\n\nfind a new home for all of these trophies.\n\nTPGF: And you write a very successful blog on the NHRA website, correct?\n\nBW: Correct. 10 years ago, we all started hearing about these new things\n\ncalled “blogs” although we didn’t know what that meant. NHRA.com asked a\n\nbunch of drivers to write them for an entire month, but my guy Del Worsham\n\nwasn’t really suited for that, so the powers that be challenged me to write\n\nit as myself, just so readers could see what it’s like to be a part of a\n\nteam and do this for a living. The challenge was “Let’s see if a guy nobody\n\never heard of can write about stuff nobody cares about, and still keep them\n\nentertained.” I didn’t see how I could do that for an entire month, and I\n\nhad no idea if anyone would read it. I took a pretty big chance doing it, I\n\nthink, because it could have been an utter failure with my name attached to\n\nit. Instead, it was quickly the most popular blog on the site and it remains\n\nthat to this day. I’ve written well more than 2,500 installments and have\n\nabout 10,000 readers around the world. It absolutely changed my life,\n\nbecause I’m no longer a guy nobody ever heard of. The fans are amazing, and\n\nI have fantastic conversations all day long at every race. It’s really been\n\na fantastic thing. I’m proud of it. There’s no denying that the success of\n\nthe blog gave me the writing chops and the confidence to take on just about\n\nanything.\n\nTPGF: But it sounds like you’re about to hang up the ear plugs and make\n\nanother change. Is that true?\n\nBW: YBW: Yes, that’s true. 20 years is long enough, and I want to take on the next great challenge while I’m still young enough to do it with all my youthful energy, despite the fact I’ll be 60 next summer. Our season just ended, and I’m in the process of leaving the sport after I wrap up a few PR things and help Team Wilkerson\n\nRacing with the transition. I’m going take 2016 to write a book. The book is in me, and I’ve known for decades that I’m destined to write it, but the only thing getting in the way was my career. It’s time to make the commitment and just do it. And maybe it’s good that I’ve put it off this long, because some great stories to tell are things that have happened recently. That will be my job in 2016. I’ll be a self-employed and underpaid writer.\n\nTPGF: And the subject matter?\n\nBW: Pretty much everything we’ve talked about here. It will be the story of\n\nmy very fortunate life. My upbringing, baseball, college, my short but\n\neventful minor league career, then traipsing through the world of sports and\n\nsports marketing until I was 40, at which point I stumbled into NHRA Drag\n\nRacing for the next 20 years. It’s been a wild and wonderful ride, and there\n\nare too many great stories and rich characters to not write it all down. I’m\n\nexcited to do it.\n\nTPGF: When will we see it?\n\nBW: I guess when I’m done (laughing). If it takes a year, that’s what it\n\ntakes. I don’t believe it will, and I’ve already written what looks like\n\nChapter 1, but it will be my actual job in 2016. It just won’t pay much. As\n\nin it won’t pay at all, but I’m going to be very dedicated to it and I hope\n\nsome people find it entertaining when it’s in print.\n\nTPGF: And what happens to your blog?\n\nBW: Thanks to TPGF and the largesse of my brother Del, I’m going to move the blog to our TPGF website, and it will take the place of what has been called “Bob On Baseball”. We’ve already adjusted the title to a simple “Bob’s Blog” because it will be about everything and anything, like my other blog has been for more than 10 years. I’ve announced it on my current blog, and the response from literally thousands of people has been phenomenal. Somehow, I’ve touched a chord with a lot of folks and they really enjoy what I write, even when it’s just nonsense about my cats, my wife, and what we had for dinner. I guess I’ll be a blogger for the rest of my life.\n\nTPGF: Do you remain a sports fan to this day, and if so what sports or teams\n\ndo you follow?\n\nBW: Oh my gosh, I don’t go through a day without closely following just\n\nabout every major sport out there. My wonderful wife Barbara and I moved to\n\nMinnesota in 2002, where we lived in an east-side suburb of St. Paul for a\n\ndecade, and we adopted all the Minnesota teams as our own. We still consider\n\nit “home” and still have a house there, although Barb’s job means we also\n\nhave a home in Spokane. Once she retires, we’ll go back to Minnesota for\n\ngood. At one point we had season tickets to the Twins, the Wild, and the\n\nTimberwolves and I wouldn’t be surprised if we signed up for all of that\n\nagain when we get back. Hopefully next spring.\n\nTPGF: Tell us the back-story about your affinity for the Twins.\n\nBW: Well, from the time I was four until I was 14, my dad was the Twins’ top\n\nnational scout and the manager of their Fall Instructional League team. We\n\nlived in St. Louis, and I had Cardinal baseball in my blood, considering\n\nthey were the first team Big Del played for in the Major Leagues, but with\n\nhim working for the Twins during those childhood years, I was a huge Twins\n\nfan growing up. Harmon Killebrew was my first “favorite player” ever. I\n\nsuspect I was probably the only kid in St. Louis who constantly wore a cap\n\nwith TC on it instead of STL. Once Barbara and I got to Minnesota, I\n\nhonestly felt like I was finally “home” and we’ll keep it that way.\n\nTPGF: And the President of the Twins, Dave St. Peter, is part of the\n\nadvisory council here at TPGF.\n\nBW: He is, and he’s been a great help to us from the first day. When Barbara\n\nand I moved to the Twin Cities in ’02, I sent a note to Dave just to\n\nintroduce myself as a member of the extended Twins family, dating back to my\n\nchildhood years wearing that TC cap, and he wrote back immediately. When we\n\nlaunched TPGF, I met with him down in Fort Myers at Spring Training, and he\n\nagreed to join the Advisory Council without hesitation. He helped us get\n\nBert Blyleven on-board as well. They’re both great guys and have been so\n\nhelpful. Dave and I exchange emails regularly and every one of them ends\n\nwith “Win Twins!”\n\nTPGF: Thanks for your time, and best of luck with your next great adventure.\n\nBW: My pleasure. It’s kind of surreal to have wrapped up my drag racing career, and it was a very emotional weekend in Pomona, with all sorts of heartfelt send-offs and tributes that I know I’m not worthy of. I’m saying goodbye to a large number of people who feel like family to me, and while that was sad and emotional, we all know the bond we have and we’ll stay in touch, and I plan to go to four or five races next year, just to see my friends and colleagues. 20 years is a long time, and it’s time for the next chapter. And that pun is fully\n\nintended! I’m looking forward to it.\n\nQ & A with Marci Doyle Baker\n\nHOME / Q & A with Marci Doyle Baker\n\nOctober 22nd, 2014\n\nMeet Marci Doyle Baker, the Chief Operating Officer for The Arnold Palmer Invitational Presented by MasterCard at Bay Hill in Orlando and the newest TPGF Advisor.\n\nMarci is a Florida Gator who is on a fantastic career path with work in the sports/event marketing /media industry including stops at DWA, Wunderman, Golf Channel and currently The Arnold Palmer Invitational Presented by MasterCard.\n\nShe lives with her husband in Orlando and recently spent some time with us talking about her work, her family and her belief in ‘Pay it Forward’\n\nQuestion: What a great career you have had so far – Including having an office next door to Arnold Palmer ! You are a Florida Gator but how did you get started in your sports career?\n\nI started my career out of college interning with a fantastic sports marketing agency, DelWilber + Associates, who took a chance on me and hired me full time (thank you, Del!) to work on their 7 LPGA tournaments, as well as assist managing a number of sports sponsorships (NHL, PGA TOUR, college basketball, etc)\n\nQuestion: You grew up in a Major League Baseball family (Dad Denny Doyle (full disclosure Denny was my roommate for 3 seasons in the Minor Leagues and my best baseball friend, Uncles Brian Doyle and Blake Doyle) – what was that like?\n\nMy Dad was outnumbered from the beginning with 3 daughters (he claims he has all the boys he ever needs via his Baseball School now)! Growing up, we were at the stadium every chance we got, and it was a true blessing, not to mention the life lessons learned – like how to sit still for 9 innings as a child, to be careful what you say about the other team, as you never know who’s family is sitting around you, etc.\n\nMy Mom is one of the strongest women I know, balancing and juggling the baseball life (living all over the country, never knowing where you’d be sent next, etc), along with her own teaching career and 3 girls! Dad was such a great example of strong work ethic as well – his philosophy was he may not be the most talented on the field, but he was the first one to arrive and last one to leave at the stadium every game – no one was going to out-work him! Not to mention what a strong Christian example and mentor both my parents are for our family as well as for so many others – baseball was just a great platform for them to do so!\n\nWe still have a friendly family rivalry with my Dad having played for the Red Sox and Uncle Brian played for the Yankees. But now we ALL cheer for the Colorado Rockies, as my Uncle Blake is currently their hitting coach and living out his dream job!\n\nQuestion: You have worked on the sports marketing agency side, the media side (with Golf Channel) and currently on the PGA Tour Golf Tournament side – what lessons would you pass on to those who aspire to a career path like yours?\n\nI highly recommend gaining experience in as many different sports areas as possible within the industry (team, league, venue, broadcast, agency, client/corporate). Whether it be via internships, volunteering, part-time position, commission-only – whatever you’re able to give of your time, the exposure to different sides of the business helps you determine where you want to contribute long-term, while at the same time showing off your abilities and providing networking opportunities for your career path.\n\nQuestion: Recently you were promoted to Chief Operating Officer at The Arnold Palmer Invitational sponsored by MasterCard – what challenges come with these new responsibilities?\n\nI am honored to be representing and working with arguably one of the greatest brands in sports, Mr. Arnold Palmer, and I don’t take that lightly. Our biggest challenge is to maintain and build upon the Arnold Palmer legacy and standards of his tournament, within the golf industry, as well as in the business and philanthropic communities – and I love the challenge!\n\nQuestion: As a woman with a very important job in sports what advice might you pass on to other young women looking to make their way in the sports business?\n\nMy advice would be that you not make it a male/female thing – ask questions of others who are in a position you would like to be in, find opportunities to continue learning in the industry (training, shadowing, reading), and remember to always GIVE BACK/Pay It Forward (your time, your knowledge, your gifts)\n\nQuestion: How do you balance your work life and personal life? What advice would you pass along regarding this important issue?\n\nI recommend that you find a significant other that is understanding and supportive of your career. If they don’t understand your passion, your need to spend the extra hours, etc. in the beginning, it will not get easier. I also recommend to find time for yourself to do something unrelated to your day-to-day career life (charity, exercise, etc) – easier said than done, but important no matter what industry you are in, especially in one as demanding as sports.\n\nQuestion: We’ve been told that in addition to everything else you are a very accomplished singer – possibly even singing the National Anthem at sports events? Is that true ? Tell us about that ?\n\nHa! Ha! You’re funny, Del! J\n\nQ & A with Leo Kiely\n\nHOME / Q & A with Leo Kiely\n\nJune 21st, 2014\n\nQ & A with Leo Kiely\n\nToday’s TPGF Interview is with Leo Kiely the newest member of The Perfect Game Foundation Advisory Council.\n\nLeo has had a spectacular business career including stops at Procter & Gamble, Wilson Sporting Goods, Frito-Lay, and finally the first Non Family Member to ever run the Coors Brewing Company!\n\nHe retired as CEO of Miller Coors after 20 years and currently lives in Colorado and Southern California where he remains very active with business and family – he spent some time with us talking about his career\n\n· What was your first job?\n\no Cutting lawns in a cemetery in Long Branch NJ ! Seriously! But my first ‘professional/career’ job was as a Brand Assistant with Procter & Gamble working the Gleem toothpaste brand\n\n·You have mentored a lot of young people throughout your career – did you some mentors as you were growing up?\n\no Absolutely and without them I might still be cutting lawns in that cemetery! Bill Weintraub was my first boss at P&G (he was the Gleem Brand Manager) and he helped me immeasurably. We remain friends to this day and had several occasions to work together after those early P&G days. Another guy was Jack Fette at Wilson Sporting Goods (when he was not doing his Wilson job Jack was a long time NFL Referee!). Jack taught me things I still use today – totally a world class guy and dear friend. Also Bill Connell who was the Crest Brand Manager who gave me countless hours of advice/counsel and support.\n\n·Your business career is Hall of Fame stuff – how did you manage the work/family balance issue?\n\no I always believed that you had to be passionate about your work as well as passionate about your family. For me that translated into making time for staying in touch on a regular basis no matter where in the world I might be on business. It also meant blocking out time for family activity – regardless of the business pressures of that day\n\n·You have worked with many companies involved in sports (one way or another) – any memorable moments from those days?\n\no Yes ! I have fond memories of negotiating with Magic Johnson and his dad about a shoe endorsement deal when I was at Wilson – what fun that was ! And I was closely involved/interested in the Coors Light Silver Bullets Women’s Baseball Team which was a blast! I got to know Joe Niekro and his brother Phil very well – I have a photo on my desk with them and Sparky Anderson! And I played catch with Joe Niekro and tried (unsuccessfully) to catch his knuckleball!\n\n·Do you have some favorite sports teams?\n\no I’m a Red Sox guy for sure — I can remember meeting Ted Williams with my Grandfather (who played in the Big Leagues) at Fenway ! I also love the Bears and Bruins and became a huge Avalanche fan while living in Denver\n\n·You were the first Non Family Member to run the Coors Brewing Company – what was that like when you arrived in Golden Colorado?\n\no Pretty interesting – there were bets being made on how quickly I’d get fired! This old family business had never had someone run the Company whose name was not Coors so the early days were very interesting to say the least! But the adoptive process began and Pete Coors became another mentor of mine and a close friend -his loyalty and support were huge contributors to making this move a success for the Company. Coors is an amazing company and the people there would do anything for the business. My challenge was to help teach them to ‘win’ and my business style as always been to be a ‘loyalist’ – total commitment to my boss. Happily Pete was the same way with me – the rest, as they say, is history\n\n·For today’s young people getting out of school and looking to start their careers – any words of advice/pearls of wisdom to share?\n\no Find a career path that you are passionate about – there is no substitute for the enthusiasm that comes from passion\n\no Learn a skill early on – concentrate on being the best you can be at your chosen discipline no matter what that skill/discipline might be\n\no Appreciate the fact that you will live with a batting average during your business career – no one bats 1.000 so it’s critical to learn from your disappointments and come back stronger than before the setbacks\n\nQ & A with Betsy Nagelsen-McCormack\n\nHOME / Q & A with Betsy Nagelsen-McCormack\n\nNovember 6th, 2013\n\nMeet Betsy Nagelsen-McCormack who is a former WTA professional tennis player, a mother of an active teenager and the Head Tennis Coach at the State College of Florida\n\nBetsy was an internationally ranked player on the WTA Tour for more than 20 years, and a two-time Grand Slam tournament champion in doubles. She achieved a career high ranking of world No. 25 in singles and No. 11 in doubles, and won more than 30 career titles in singles and doubles. She won the Australian Open doubles title in 1978 and 1980, and was a finalist at the 1978 Australian Open. She was a four-time member of the U.S. Wightman Cup Team.\n\nBefore launching her pro career, Nagelsen-McCormack was the world’s top junior player in 1973 and winner of the prestigious USTA Girls’ Sportsmanship Award.\n\nPlaying in her 20th consecutive main draw at Wimbledon in 1993, Nagelsen-McCormack won the over-35 women’s doubles championship, and went on to win back-to-back titles in the US Open Senior women’s doubles in 1993 and 1994.\n\nAfter her retirement in 1996, Nagelsen-McCormack became a commentator for ABC and ESPN in the United States and Australia’s Nine Network.\n\nHer late husband, Mark H. McCormack, was founder and chairman of International Management Group (IMG) and widely recognized as the inventor of sports marketing. Following his passing in 2003, the company was sold to a longtime family friend, Ted Forstmann, founder\n\nof Forstmann Little and the financier of recognized brands, Gulfstream and Dr. Pepper.\n\nMcCormack is active in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association Women’s Hall of Fame at the McCormack-Nagelsen Tennis Center at the College of William & Mary. She also serves on the boards of the International Tennis Hall of Fame. She was honored as the recipient of the House of Hope Humanitarian Award for her service to House of Hope, an Orlando ministry for troubled teens.\n\nToday, Nagelsen-McCormack remains active in the sport, and serves as Head Coach for the State College of Florida Women’s Tennis Team.\n\nQuestion: What a great tennis career you have had so far ! How old were you when you started playing and where did you play ?\n\nI grew up in St. Petersburg Florida and when I was six years old my mom got invited to go watch a tennis tournament at the St. Pete Tennis center which was then called Bartlett Park. It was part of the Caribbean tour and attracted the best tennis players at that time. She took me and I got hooked then and there and begged for months for my mom to let me play tennis. A few months later she did and I’ve been playing ever since!\n\nQuestion: Tell us about your Junior tennis — you were #1 in the Country !\n\nIn 1972 I won the 16 and under national’s and that same year lost in the finals of the 18 and under nationals and was co-ranked number one in the country.\n\nQuestion: You had some great Doubles Wins as a player – is there one victory in particular that you enjoyed the most?\n\nI did have some success in doubles as my game was more suited for it. I loved to serve and volley and it was also more fun with a partner. I want 2 grand slam doubles, one with Martina Navratilova, and got to the finals of Wimbledon one year losing a close one. Wendy Turnbull from Australia and I won the richest tournament at that time with all the greats in it and we each won a car. Some of my most fun doubles memories were in mixed doubles. One year in a Wimbledon semi final Scott Davis and I played up until then the longest match ever played losing to Martina Navratilova and Emilio Sanchez in a little over four hours. One year in a US open final Paul Annacone and I had a match point against Martina and Emilio again and lost that in three close sets. Peter Fleming and I won a world mixed doubles title which was also memorable.\n\nQuestion: With all the time you have been part of women’s professional tennis tell us who are the best women’s players you ever played against?\n\nI feel blessed to have played in the era that I did. Playing with the original nine which included Billie Jean King, Rosie Casals, Virginia Wade, Betty Stove, and Julie Heldman, all of whom I got to play against. Then it was Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova, then Steffi Graf and Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati. Wish I could say I played against Venus and Serena too!\n\nQuestion: Now that you are a college tennis coach (at State College of Florida — http://www.scfmanatees.com/sports/wten/index) tell us about that chapter of your life?\n\nI could write a book on my 3 1/2 years as a college tennis coach! It has been an extremely rewarding and fun experience. I have been blessed to have had some wonderful girls playing for me and it’s been a joy to watch them improve and have several of them go on to good D1 schools on scholarship! The best part is the interaction with them and hopefully having a positive impact on their lives both on and off the court.\n\nQuestion: Your religion has always been a very important part of your life – how does your strong Christian faith help you in sports?\n\nYes, my relationship with the Lord has been the most important part of my life. I became a Christian at 16 and now many years later have found that His love for me and my wanting an ever closer relationship with Him has not only sustained me both through difficult circumstances but has helped me put things in proper order in a way that only knowing Him can do. I can not imagine any life which mine included competing seriously in a sport to dealing with the loss of a husband and being a single mom to all the other equally tough things people go through without the help from a perfect Savior.\n\nQuestion: As a very successful Mom of a great daughter – how do you balance your business interests and your coaching with being a Mother of a teenager?\n\nI am realizing that being a mom to a teenager and a single mom at that is one of the toughest jobs there is! It’s also my most important job and my most favorite job! I have a very strong willed, opinionated daughter who also has unbelievable negotiating skills. No surprise there! She makes me grow as a mom! She’s also a very good athlete and enjoys tennis which works out well since she comes to practice with us every day which of course I love. So I get to spend lots of time with my nearly 16-year-old daughter which is the best part of my life! She seems to be ok with it too!!\n\nQ & A with David Sheinin\n\nHOME / Q & A with David Sheinin\n\nAugust 23rd, 2013\n\nDavid Sheinin, a long-time Washington Post sports writer, has penned a new biography of the Washington Redskins’ star quarterback, Robert Griffin III, more commonly known as RG3. We asked Dave some questions about the book, sports writing, how he became a success in the business and why he isn’t an opera singer (no joke). You can find RG3 – The Promise at Amazon http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399165452/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d4_i1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center2&pf_rd_r=16PQG511CZQ8Q4RR4BSB&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=1389517282&pf_rd_i=507846\n\n1) Dave — Where did you get the idea to write about RG3?\n\nMy boss, Washington Post sports editor Matt Vita, put me on the RG3 “beat” back in March 2012, shortly after the trade in which the Redskins moved up to the No. 2 pick in the draft — when it became clear they were going to pick Griffin. I immediately went to Texas to start meeting Griffin and his family. The book began to take shape in October, when it was clear Griffin was more than just another star athlete.\n\n2)You are a Vandy graduate in English. Tell us how you got from there to becoming an award winning writer ?\n\nI went to Vanderbilt on the Grantland Rice/Fred Russell sportswriting scholarship (which has also produced journalists such as Roy Blount Jr., Skip Bayless, Tyler Kepner and Lee Jenkins). I got a well-rounded liberal-arts education there, with a major in English and a minor in music. In my music studies, I trained for a time as an opera singer and toyed with the notion of pursuing it as a career — but by that point I was fairly far along in journalism. I’ve only had two full-time employers in the business: the Miami Herald from 1993-1999 and The Washington Post from 1999-present.\n\n3)Your book ‘The Promise’ about RG 3 has been getting rave reviews – can you tell us anything you discovered about RG3 in writing it that totally surprised you?\n\nNothing about my reporting on Griffin has totally surprised me. In fact, it has all reinforced the opinions I had — which is in itself a surprise. Usually it’s the opposite — the more you delve into someone’s background and life story, the more it unravels. With Griffin, it was the opposite. The more I learned, the more impressed I became.\n\n4) Are there lessons from RG3’s life, career that you think would be valuable to people seeking jobs in the business of sports?\n\nIt is difficult to apply specific lessons from Griffin’s life and career to folks seeking work in the business of sports, but the fundamental traits that have made him successful are worth repeating: hard work, personal discipline, strong parenting, etc. I also admire the way he pursued a wide variety of interests, including music, law and other sports (track and field, basketball) — rather than narrow his focus to only football.\n\n5)During your years covering MLB – who were a few of your very favorite players? Managers? Owners? Why?\n\nWhen I look back at my beat-writing career (roughly 1998-2004), my fondest memory by far will be covering the end of Cal Ripken Jr.’s career. In fact, now that I think about it, that may be the closest comparison I have ever witnessed to Griffin’s time in DC — in the sense of an entire community bonding to its superstar.\n\n6) When you aren’t writing a book or churning out newspaper copy, what do you do? Has spending a lifetime covering sports affected the way you watch, enjoy the games?\n\nI certainly have become more cynical and detached from sports as a fan over the years. In my younger years, I could still root openly from the teams of my youth (the Atlanta Braves, Hawks and Falcons), but now they’re all just another team. The only entity I still root passionately for is my alma mater, Vanderbilt. I do enjoy going to baseball games now that I’m not so deeply ingrained in that world.\n\nQ & A with Bert Blyleven\n\nHOME / Q & A with Bert Blyleven\n\nApril 14th, 2013\n\nBert Blyleven, an Advisory Board member for TPGF, was elected into\n\nBaseball’s Hall of Fame in 2011. He has also been the color commentator for\n\nMinnesota Twins television broadcasts since 1996, and is enormously popular\n\nwith Twins fans all around the world.\n\nIn addition, Bert has acted as the pitching coach for the Kingdom of the\n\nNetherlands in the past two World Baseball Classic tournaments, where he and\n\nhis underdog team have exceeded any reasonable expectations by advancing to\n\nthe final round in 2013, after making it the second round in 2009, when they\n\nbeat the strong Dominican Republic squad twice in order to advance.\n\nBert was born in Zeist, Netherlands and moved to the United States as a\n\nyoung child.\n\nTPGF: Bert, the growth of the World Baseball Classic has been impressive,\n\nand we think it illustrates some rather remarkable growth for the sport of\n\nbaseball in new regions of the world. How has your experience been, with the\n\nDutch team?\n\nBert: It’s just been a fantastic experience for me, and I know it’s been a\n\nmajor positive step for baseball in a lot of different countries. Most of\n\nour Dutch team is made up of players from The Netherlands and from Curacao,\n\nwhich is part of the Kingdom of The Netherlands, and it’s been amazing to\n\nwatch these guys come together and really compete at the highest levels in\n\nthe world, despite the fact most of these young men will never play in the\n\nmajor leagues.\n\nThe only issue with the WBC is the timing of it, but there’s really no other\n\nway to do it. You can’t stop the major league season to play it, and you\n\ncan’t schedule it for after the season, because all the players are pretty\n\nworn out by then. Doing it during spring training is the best time for the\n\nWBC, and we just make it work.\n\nTPGF: It has to be a great experience for your young Dutch players, right?\n\nBert: Oh it’s the greatest experience they could get. Some of our guys are\n\nin the minor leagues in various organizations, but none of them have ever\n\nreally experienced what it’s like to play against established major league\n\nplayers in front of packed stadiums filled with excited fans. They don’t get\n\nto feel that pressure and excitement in a minor league spring training game\n\non the back field at some complex. We’re over there in Chinese Taipei and\n\nJapan, playing in big stadiums that are rocking with excitement, and it’s a\n\nthrill for the Dutch players to not only experience that, but do so well.\n\nTPGF: Speaking of Chinese Taipei and Japan, your team had to do some\n\nbackbreaking travel during the WBC.\n\nBert: Boy, we sure did and that was the hardest part for us. It probably\n\nwore our guys out a bit by the final round. We’re in the opening rounds\n\nagainst those Asian teams, so our guys had to travel from Holland and\n\nCuracao before spring training, so we could practice together and come\n\ntogether as a team a little bit, in Arizona. Then we got on a plane and went\n\nto Taipei, then on to Japan, and then back to the U.S. to get ready for the\n\nfinal round. We did 15,000 miles in the air as a team, and no other country\n\nhad to do anything close to that.\n\nTPGF: Why hasn’t the U.S. team done as well as people expected?\n\nBert: I think it’s because they bring in All-Star players, who are all great\n\nballplayers and very motivated to be there, but they don’t have the time to\n\ncome together as a team. We didn’t have the pure talent like the USA did,\n\nbut we spent the time to learn each other’s tendencies and become a team. By\n\nthe time we played our first game, we had our pitching figured out and we\n\nwere comfortable with our batting order and defense.\n\nTPGF: So, after all these years in the broadcast booth, getting back in the\n\ndugout and back in uniform has to be great.\n\nBert: Oh it’s been great. I love working with young players, helping them\n\nlearn the game and learn how to respect the game and play it the right way.\n\nTo have a chance to work with these Dutch players, who are playing against\n\nsome of the best teams in the world, is really rewarding. And you know, the\n\nbest part of this is that I’m honoring my mom and dad by coaching the Dutch\n\nteam. They brought us to America to make a better life for themselves, so I\n\nget to honor them and my country of birth by coaching the Netherlands team.\n\nTPGF: And now the 2013 MLB season is underway and the Twins are playing\n\npretty well to start the season, despite being picked by most experts to\n\nfinish at the bottom of the AL Central again.\n\nBert: The Twins pitching, especially the starting staff, has just not been\n\nup to the normal Minnesota Twins standards the last couple of years, so that\n\nwas General Manager Terry Ryan’s aim this season, to shore that up. Vance\n\nWorley, Kevin Correia, and Mike Pelfrey are three good starters who have\n\ncome in as fresh faces, and I know everyone in the front office is happy\n\nabout how they’re throwing the ball. The other day, we brought up Pedro\n\nHernandez, a young pitcher we got in the Francisco Liriano trade, and he\n\npitched a good strong outing for us. This club has plenty of offensive\n\ntools, and a very good bullpen, so I think the 2013 Minnesota Twins have a\n\nchance to make some of those experts look a little foolish. It’s a long\n\nseason and we’ll see how it ends up, but this is a much better team than\n\nwe’ve had the last two years.\n\nTPGF: Speaking of pitching, you’re pretty outspoken about things like pitch\n\ncounts and complete games. The game has really changed, hasn’t it?\n\nBert: Oh my gosh, it’s changed so much I think we need to adjust some things\n\nto make it work. With everyone on pitch counts, if you can get your starter\n\nto the seventh inning it’s almost like a complete game, anymore. There are\n\nteams carrying 13 pitchers, to make sure they have all the long guys, set-up\n\nguys, and closers they need. When you do that, you only have three position\n\nplayers on the bench. The manager only has three moves he can make, and one\n\nof those might be his back-up catcher, so you have to be careful there that\n\nyou don’t make a move and run out of catchers.\n\nTPGF: So what can be done, since it doesn’t look like pitch counts are going\n\naway?\n\nBert: Two things come to mind for me. First, maybe the Players Association\n\nand the MLB clubs can work out an increase in the size of the roster. Just\n\nadding a couple of players will give the managers a lot more options to make\n\nchanges or moves. Going into a game with just three players on the bench\n\nmakes it really hard to match-up as the game goes on. Secondly, now that\n\nwe’re balanced at 15 teams per league, with the Houston Astros moving to the\n\nAmerican League, we have to have one inter-league series going at all times.\n\nMaybe it’s time to either eliminate the DH or expand it to both leagues,\n\nbecause it’s awfully hard for these NL teams and AL teams to have to swap\n\nback and forth depending on who the home team is. Either way, it’s probably\n\ntime to make some changes, because the game has changed. Especially in terms\n\nof pitching.\n\nTPGF: Bert, thanks so much for the great conversation and best of luck the\n\nrest of the way with the Twins.\n\nBert: My pleasure, and I’m happy to be involved with TPGF. What you and your\n\nfamily are doing is a great thing, and good for the game.\n\nQ & A with TPGF Fellow Madison Meade\n\nHOME / Q & A with TPGF Fellow Madison Meade\n\nMarch 7th, 2013\n\nQ. You went to school at SIU Edwardsville – how did you choose that school?\n\nMy decision to go to Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE) was based on the aspiration of being a student-athlete. I left California and signed a scholarship to SIUE which navigated me outside of my comfort zone. Attending SIUE not only equipped me to fulfill my dreams of being a Division I basketball player and to continue my education, but it developed me to become comfortable being uncomfortable.\n\nQ. At SIUE you were a Student Athlete – what were the most demanding areas of balancing athletics with scholarship?\n\nThe act of balancing was indeed a challenge during my four years at SIUE. As a student-athlete, one is expected to excel scholastically, dominate one’s sport and be a standout representative of the university. Balancing my social life with school and basketball took some adjustments initially. By senior year I was able to finish school on time, play basketball, work a part time job and have an additional part time internship. The most demanding area of this balancing act for me was disciplining myself and committing to do whatever it takes to reach my goals. I thought I understood what these two things meant until I left home and went to college. I quickly learned that no one was going to complete my tasks for me. I had to commit myself to my goals, my education, and my team. I had to discipline myself and calculate choices I made. In my opinion, the balancing act of a student-athlete is about discipline and commitment.\n\nQ. During your time in college can you identify a person or two who mentored you and/or had unusual impact on your life?\n\nI am blessed to have many inspirational and influencing people in my life. Aside from my family, my coach, Amanda Levens, was an enlightening leader on and off the court. She was exquisitely demanding and strong, as well as kind and calm. The “tough love” approach ignited me to persevere in the next steps in my life. I am so grateful to have such an inspiring coach that never stopped engaging in my dreams and aspirations.\n\nThe summer before my senior year of college, Del Wilber (of TPGF), reached out to me to talk. As we started chatting more and more, we became friends and someone I looked to for advice about “the real world”. We connected on our similarities of being student-athletes. I sensed his trust and passion for helping others succeed in their goals. Del not only helped introduce me to new wonderful people, but he gave me a sense of hope and encouragement. The kindness of his words, enthusiasm of his generosity and thoughtfulness to take the time to guide and support others has been one of the best lessons I have learned in my life. I am truly blessed to have such a great mentor like Del.\n\nQ. When did you decide that working in sports was something you were passionate about and wanted to pursue post graduation?\n\nI will always be passionate about sports but I will admit, I wasn’t pursuing a career in sports until my junior/senior year of college. As my athletic career was coming to an end, I began to focus on my next move. Del helped guide me into the business side of sports. At the end of my basketball career I realized that the lessons I was taught throughout the years playing were things I would never be able to learn in a classroom. I wanted to continue to support athletics and grow as a business leader in the sports world.\n\nQ. Your first internship after graduating was working for the San Francisco 49ers – tell us about that assignment?\n\nYes, I received news about the opportunity to be an event marketing intern for the 49ers during my last few months of college. At this point, my college athletic career was over and I was finishing my last few classes. I was so eager to start and do anything and everything I could for the 49ers. The event marketing internship was an amazing step to get the feel of how a team works within a front office. I assisted with special events which enabled me to fine tune my social skills and help the smooth flow of events occur.\n\nQ. That internship turned into a full time opportunity. Tell us what you are doing now and what your responsibilities are today?\n\nI currently work on retail operations and my responsibilities include being a buyer for 49ers merchandise, analyzing data, creating customer experience in our stores, and delivering satisfaction for our fans through retail. This is only a quick snapshot of the key items I have been working on.\n\nQ . Besides the 49ers – what other teams (pro or college) do you follow?\n\nFor business, I follow a lot of teams to keep up to date with trends, social media engagement and to extend my knowledge of how each team is running their business/team. As a fan, I am all about the U of O Ducks and Stanford Cardinal. I became a big St. Louis Cardinals fan while in college (saw two World Series). Although, I can’t move on to the next question without giving a shout out to the San Francisco Giants!! Way to go!\n\nQ. Any advice you would pass on to other TPGF candidates as they work their way toward a career in sports?\n\nOne may dream of one’s perfect job in sports, or may not even be sure what is out there. Either way, continue to meet new people, be open minded, and never underestimate one’s potential. TPGF candidates are in the perfect position right now; with endless possibilities you can do or go anywhere you want. If you put the time and effort into what you are working for, you will create opportunities for yourself. You can be a leader at any age or at any position. Be kind, work hard, set an example and believe in yourself. Make an employer have no choice but to want and need you to work for them.\n\nQ & A with Hank Torbert\n\nHOME / Q & A with Hank Torbert\n\nJanuary 29th, 2013\n\nQ: Over your career you have done some very interesting things – could you walk us through your career to date?\n\nI have spent the last 15 years in the private equity, operational management,business development and corporate finance world after starting my career as an intern at the FifthThird Bank at fourteen. After college, I helped build an emerging markets investment firm, and then went to business school at Columbia. Post-graduate school, I was fortunate enough to join JPMorgan’s investment banking group. This was an amazing experience in terms of exposure, training and career validation. After being promoted to Vice President, I left JPMorgan to become the COO of a client’s private equity firm in Washington, DC. And, in 2006, founded my own investment firm to continue my focus on medium-sized companies. Through my firm, I have been fortunate to have helped build two publicly-traded companies in the technology sector.\n\nQ: Of all the stops along the way for you so far – which one/ones were the most gratifying?.\n\nOne of the most gratifying moments in my career was the 2008 initial public offering of Mood Media (TSX: “MM”), formerly Fluid Music, Inc. an internet-based music services company. I invested in the company and worked with the company’s founder from concept to the public offering. To participate in the evolution of a company from birth was an amazing experience.\n\nQ: Who was a key mentor to you in your career and how did that relationship help you along the way?\n\nI have been fortunate to have several mentors throughout my career. One in particular was the late Mr. Clement Buenger, former Chairman of Fifth ThirdBank. Mr. Buenger played an integral role in early career development as an intern at the Bank and ultimately my hiring at JPMorgan. The most important lesson I learned from him was that, “you are too young to make a mistake.” Specifically, don’t be afraid to test yourself, to try new things, or to pursue your dreams. In addition, he constantly reminded me of my personal obligation to always assist others in need, especially as it related to advancement of education and the arts.\n\nQ: Along the way you have personally done great things breaking through diversity barriers – what advice would you have today for any minorities aspiring to a business career in sports?\n\nPursuing any career path has its challenges. But the most important thing to remember is that you should never let anyone take away or diminish how hard you have worked to get to where you are. Also, be inquisitive. Try to meet those who are where you would like to go with your career and get their insight. You will be surprised at how much people are willing to share their experiences with you – especially in the sports business industry. This knowledge will assist you in plotting a career course for yourself.\n\nQ: You have some interesting ties to Professional Baseball – could you tell us about those?\n\nI have been very fortunate to have met and known two owners of MLB teams for several years. Through these relationships, I have gained a lot of insight into the business side of major league baseball and other franchises.\n\nQ: Over your career you have worked in both the Corporate and Entrepreneurial Sectors -which have you enjoyed more?\n\nI have most enjoyed entrepreneurial sectors and experiences. I have always considered myself a builder or one who likes to assist others in building platforms. This is no different than building a home, you have the ability to step back and say, “I have created something.”\n\nQ: What are a couple of yourfavorite sports moment as a fan?\n\nIn many ways, the sport heroes of childhood represented tenacity, dedication and all the other positive values of great athletes. As a result, my most memorable sports moments include:\n\n1) Hank Aaron hitting his career home run number 715 on April 8, 1974, breaking Babe Ruth’s record. I am actually named after Hank Aaron.\n\n2) The Big Red Machine dominating the National League from 1972 – 1976. As a young child, Cincinnati Reds games were always playing in the background on the radio or the television.\n\nQ: What are your favorite activities outside of work?\n\nFishing by far. My father first took me fishing when I was a young boy, and I have loved it ever since. If I’m not around, I’m probably fishing somewhere away from it all.\n\nQ & A with David Bell\n\nHOME / Q & A with David Bell\n\nOctober 10th, 2012\n\nAs member of the prestigious Advertising Hall of Fame, David Bell has over 40 years of experience in the marketing communications sector. He is Chairman Emeritus and previously served as Chairman and CEO of The Interpublic Group, Inc., one of the world’s largest marketing communications service companies.\n\nMr. Bell previously held the positions of Chairman and CEO of True North Communications Inc., the world’s sixth largest global advertising and marketing communications holding company.

Mr. Bell serves the industry as Past Chairman of The Advertising Council, The American Advertising Federation, The Advertising Educational Foundation and The American Association of Advertising Agencies. Mr. Bell was inducted into the Advertising Hall of Fame by his peers in March 2007.\n\nQ: What was your first job?\n\nFresh out of college I was hired by Leo Burnett in Chicago to work in their Training Program. I was the only non-MBA out of 19 people in the program and that job saved me from going to Law School\n\nQ: Of all the jobs you have had were there any that were particularly rewarding/fulfilling – and why?\n\nYes! My current job of ‘Coach’ – today I am mentoring dozens of young people along with companies like Gyro, Creative Realities and AOL.\n\nQ: You have mentored a lot of young people – did you have a mentor when you were growing up?\n\nSeveral but two stand out – Chuck Pihl became a mentor of mine when I was 14 and I will never forget him.\n\nChuck Peebler, who was the CEO at Bozell Worldwide when I was the President was my partner, collaborator, friend and mentor for 25 years.\n\nBoth men contributed greatly to my business and personal growth.\n\nQ: You know as much about sports media and sponsorships as anyone on the planet — what are the trends you see these days?\n\nActivation and Lower Costs for sure.\n\nThese two elements can dramatically drive more efficiency and higher ROI\n\nQ: You have a World Class family – how have you been able to balance your career with family?\n\nI always schedule family first and business second – and – I always try to remember that ‘one surprise is worth 10 expecteds’\n\nQ: You are a big NY Yankees fan – who is your favorite Yankees manager of all time?\n\nJoe Torre – he had a unique and invaluable skill of being able to push different buttons with different players to help them raise their game\n\nQ: Do you have a favorite sports memory?\n\nYes! As an original bond and season ticket holder with the Minnesota Vikings I have vivid and fond memories of the Bud Grant Super Bowl teams during the 70’s.\n\nI also am totally enjoying the amazing resurgence of Washington Nationals and Baltimore Orioles this season\n\nQ & A with Sara Loarte\n\nHOME / Q & A with Sara Loarte\n\nJune 12th, 2012\n\nWe recently asked Sara Loarte about her interests, and the business of baseball. We know you’ll really enjoy reading her story:\n\nQ: Over your career you have done some very interesting things and worked on some very exciting projects — which one of those was the most rewarding and why?\n\nIn 2001 I was fortunate to work on the MLB Opening Day Series in San Juan, Puerto Rico between the Texas Rangers and the Toronto Blue Jays. The Series was the first regular season game ever played in Puerto Rico, however the reason the Series has meant so much to me is because I was born in Puerto Rico and I participated in the island’s sports history. The enthusiasm and energy that the Major League teams received from the locals were contagious. Even the players felt it was something special. Carlos Delgado (1st baseman for the Blue Jays) and Ivan Rodriguez (catcher for the Rangers) who are both natives of Puerto Rico were quoted as saying that it was the most important game they have ever played in their careers. This will always be an event that I cherish for years to come.\n\nQ: Who was a key mentor to you in your career and how did that relationship help you along the way?\n\nMy key mentor during the early stages of my sports marketing career was Steve Baker, former President of the NAIA. Steve and I both worked together for a few years in the international division of Major League Baseball. His insights on marketing have always been very progressive but the most impactful advise he provided was that you should always focus on your strengths and to be a big fish in a little pond… During the latter part of my career, Tim Brosnan, the head of MLB business, was instrumental in opening doors for me to grow professionally at the League. Tim’s business and legal influence have helped me become more disciplined about my business performance. He always reinforced that a good deal had to be one that was “good for both sides” otherwise it would not last.\n\nQ: Along the way you have personally done great things breaking through diversity barriers – what advice would you have today for any minorities aspiring to a business career in sports?\n\nDuring my tenure at Major League Baseball I was the highest ranking Latina female executive at the League. My success came with hard work, dedicating my strengths to areas where the League lacked expertise (Latin America) and continued perseverance. I would recommend to other minorities who are interested in a business career in sports to be aggressive about their approach and not take “no” for an answer. Today there may be a “no” but tomorrow it can change to a “yes.” Also, once they get their foot in the door, they should work their hardest to continue to grow professionally within the entity. Considering other areas within the organization will also help. I started at MLB in the Legal department but I knew that my future was with the international division therefore I stayed close to their activities and personnel until an opportunity became available.\n\nQ: Over your career you have been a very successful businesswoman, wife and mother of two – how do you balance all those responsibilities?\n\nIt’s not an easy task… Women today must manage motherhood with a very demanding business world. I must say that I’ve been very fortunate to have a supportive husband but also a family that lends a hand when it is needed. The key to juggling the two successfully is to have a support system at home.\n\nQ: You have had a lot of first hand involvement in the sponsorship space – what trends do you see today in the world of corporate sponsorship?\n\nThe sponsorship environment is evolving in a very rapid manner. Property owners are now having to provide sponsors with a 360 degree activation model. The digital environment has changed the dynamics of how we interact with the consumer, therefore the offerings and communications have changed to reflect these activation platforms. I believe the trends that are evolving in corporate sponsorship are making the Property owners (teams, leagues, events) offer a turn-key solution for their sponsors. Where as in the past they have primarily licensed their intellectual property rights and the sponsor has been responsible for creating the activation program. This is no longer the case. The Properties now have to work harder for the sponsor dollars by being creative and providing more offerings.\n\nQ: We see a lot of minorities playing professional sports – any thoughts on why the percentage of minorities working on the business side of professional sports is so low?\n\nLike many other industries, the business side of professional sports was largely dominated by White males. As our society continues to change and become more diverse, so does the business world. It will take continued effort in providing minorities with opportunities in order for the numbers to change.\n\nQ: What are a couple of your favorite sports moment as a fan?\n\nThere are so many. But I probably have to highlight the 2001 World Series featuring the NY Yankees and the Arizona Diamondbacks. Although the Yankees lost the Series, games #4 and #5 were some of the most exciting games I’ve ever attended.\n\nQ: What are your favorite activities outside of work?\n\nI enjoy spending time with my kids and enjoying outdoor activities.\n\nQ: Why would you encourage someone to enter sports as a career?\n\nIt is an exciting environment to work in. Every day is different and if you enjoy entertainment, it becomes a very creative environment to grow in.\n\nQ & A with Martin Lee\n\nHOME / Q & A with Martin Lee\n\nMay 9th, 2012\n\nWe recently asked Advisor Martin Lee a few questions regarding his business career, interests, and the business of sports. Here is what Martin had to say.\n\nQ: Over your career you have worked for Olympus, Sirius and Sears — what position you have held was the most rewarding and why?\n\nThey have all been rewarding but Olympus was probably the most rewarding because I learned so much there. Olympus was transforming from a traditional film camera company to one that could battle with consumer electronic giants like Sony and HP. At the same time, we were experiencing dramatic growth because of digital camera adoption. Our marketing budget grew 10X and we got involved in sponsorships, cause marketing, sports marketing, digital engagement and more. More importantly, we had a great team that worked together to drive the business forward. There were no silos and no politics. It was a great culture when I was there.\n\nQ. Who was a mentor to you in your career and how did that relationship help you along the way?\n\nI’ve had several mentors and encourage everyone to find several mentors. If I had to single anyone out, it would have to be my father. He was a surgeon that literally had nothing when we was young. He put himself through medical school, moved to the United States to give his family a better life, started a educational scholarship fund and ended his career on medical missions serving underprivileged communities around the world. No matter what I accomplish in my career, in my mind it will never measure up to what he accomplished in his.\n\nQ: What are the most important business lessons you have learned in life?\n\nFollow your passions. I ended up at SIRIUS XM because I am a huge sports fan and music enthusiast. Having a job where I could market sports and music was a dream job. I moved to Sears because I am also a big do-it-yourself enthusiast. I love landscaping, carpentry, anything that has to do with building or working with your hands. Everyone should follow their passions. If you do, you will find your job will be much more rewarding.\n\nQ: Over your career you have been a very suc"
