According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the consolidated population of Indianapolis and Marion County was 977,203 in 2020.[11] The \"balance\" population, which excludes semi-autonomous municipalities in Marion County, was 887,642.[12] It is the 15th most populous city in the U.S., the third-most populous city in the Midwest, after Chicago and Columbus, Ohio, and the fourth-most populous state capital after Phoenix, Arizona, Austin, Texas, and Columbus. The Indianapolis metropolitan area is the 33rd most populous metropolitan statistical area in the U.S., with 2,111,040 residents.[13] Its combined statistical area ranks 28th, with a population of 2,431,361.[14] Indianapolis covers Template:Convert/sqmi, making it the 18th largest city by land area in the U.S.\n\nIndigenous peoples inhabited the area dating to as early as 10,000 BC.[15] In 1818, the Lenape relinquished their tribal lands in the Treaty of St. Mary's.[16] In 1821, Indianapolis was founded as a planned city for the new seat of Indiana's state government. The city was platted by Alexander Ralston and Elias Pym Fordham on a Template:Convert/sqmi grid next to the White River. Completion of the National and Michigan roads and arrival of rail later solidified the city's position as a manufacturing and transportation hub.[17] Two of the city's nicknames reflect its historical ties to transportation—the \"Crossroads of America\" and \"Railroad City\".[18][19][1] Since the 1970 city-county consolidation, known as Unigov, local government administration operates under the direction of an elected 25-member city-county council headed by the mayor.\n\nIndianapolis anchors the 29th largest economic region in the U.S., based primarily on the industries of trade, transportation, and utilities; professional and business services; education and health services; government; leisure and hospitality; and manufacturing.[20] The city has notable niche markets in amateur sports and auto racing.[21][22] The city is home to three Fortune 500 companies, two major league sports clubs (Colts and Pacers), five university campuses, and several museums, including the world's largest children's museum.[23][24] However, the city is perhaps best known for annually hosting the world's largest single-day sporting event, the Indianapolis 500.[25][26] Among the city's historic sites and districts, Indianapolis is home to the largest collection of monuments dedicated to veterans and war casualties in the U.S. outside of Washington, D.C.[27][28]\n\nEtymology[]\n\nThe name Indianapolis is derived from the state's name, Indiana (meaning \"Land of the Indians\", or simply \"Indian Land\"[29]), and polis, the Greek word for \"city.\" Jeremiah Sullivan, justice of the Indiana Supreme Court, is credited with coining the name.[30] Other names considered were Concord, Suwarrow, and Tecumseh.[31]\n\nHistory[]\n\nMain article: History of Indianapolis\n\nScript error: No such module \"For related page\".\n\nFounding[]\n\nIn 1816, the year Indiana gained statehood, the U.S. Congress donated four sections of federal land to establish a permanent seat of state government.[32] Two years later, under the Treaty of St. Mary's (1818), the Delaware relinquished title to their tribal lands in central Indiana, agreeing to leave the area by 1821.[16] This tract of land, which was called the New Purchase, included the site selected for the new state capital in 1820.[33] The indigenous people of the land prior to systematic removal are the Miami Nation of Indiana (Miami Nation of Oklahoma) and Indianapolis makes up part of Cession 99; the primary treaty between the indigenous population and the United States was the Treaty of St. Mary's (1818).[34]\n\nThe availability of new federal lands for purchase in central Indiana attracted settlers, many of them descendants of families from northwestern Europe. Although many of these first European and American settlers were Protestants, a large proportion of the early Irish and German immigrants were Catholics. Few African Americans lived in central Indiana before 1840.[35] The first European Americans to permanently settle in the area that became Indianapolis were either the McCormick or Pogue families. The McCormicks are generally considered to be the first permanent settlers; however, some historians believe George Pogue and family may have arrived first, on March 2, 1819, and settled in a log cabin along the creek that was later called Pogue's Run. Other historians have argued as early as 1822 that John Wesley McCormick, his family, and employees became the area's first European American settlers, settling near the White River in February 1820.[36]\n\nOn January 11, 1820, the Indiana General Assembly authorized a committee to select a site in central Indiana for the new state capital.[37] The state legislature approved the site, adopting the name Indianapolis on January 6, 1821.[2] In April, Alexander Ralston and Elias Pym Fordham were appointed to survey and design a town plan for the new settlement.[38] Indianapolis became a seat of county government on December 31, 1821, when Marion County, was established. A combined county and town government continued until 1832 when Indianapolis was incorporated as a town. Indianapolis became an incorporated city effective March 30, 1847. Samuel Henderson, the city's first mayor, led the new city government, which included a seven-member city council. In 1853, voters approved a new city charter that provided for an elected mayor and a fourteen-member city council. The city charter continued to be revised as Indianapolis expanded.[39] Effective January 1, 1825, the seat of state government moved to Indianapolis from Corydon, Indiana. In addition to state government offices, a U.S. district court was established at Indianapolis in 1825.[40]\n\nGrowth occurred with the opening of the National Road through the town in 1827, the first major federally funded highway in the United States.[41] A small segment of the ultimately failed Indiana Central Canal was opened in 1839.[42] The first railroad to serve Indianapolis, the Jeffersonville, Madison and Indianapolis Railroad, began operation in 1847, and subsequent railroad connections fostered growth.[43] Indianapolis Union Station was the first of its kind in the world when it opened in 1853.[44]\n\nCivil War and Gilded Age[]\n\nMain article: Indianapolis in the American Civil War\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Indianapolis was mostly loyal to the Union cause. Governor Oliver P. Morton, a major supporter of President Abraham Lincoln, quickly made Indianapolis a rallying place for Union army troops. On February 11, 1861, President-elect Lincoln arrived in the city, en route to Washington, D.C. for his presidential inauguration, marking the first visit from a president-elect in the city's history.[45] On April 16, 1861, the first orders were issued to form Indiana's first regiments and establish Indianapolis as a headquarters for the state's volunteer soldiers.[46][47] Within a week, more than 12,000 recruits signed up to fight for the Union.[48]\n\nIndianapolis became a major logistics hub during the war, establishing the city as a crucial military base.[49][50] Between 1860 and 1870, the city's population more than doubled.[43] An estimated 4,000 men from Indianapolis served in 39 regiments, and an estimated 700 died during the war.[51] On May 20, 1863, Union soldiers attempted to disrupt a statewide Democratic convention at Indianapolis, forcing the proceedings to be adjourned, sarcastically referred to as the Battle of Pogue's Run.[52] Fear turned to panic in July 1863, during Morgan's Raid into southern Indiana, but Confederate forces turned east toward Ohio, never reaching Indianapolis.[53] On April 30, 1865, Lincoln's funeral train made a stop at Indianapolis, where an estimated crowd of more than 100,000 people passed the assassinated president's bier at the Indiana Statehouse.[50][54]\n\nFollowing the Civil War—and in the wake of the Second Industrial Revolution—Indianapolis experienced tremendous growth and prosperity. In 1880, Indianapolis was the world's third-largest pork packing city, after Chicago and Cincinnati, and the second-largest railroad center in the United States by 1888.[55][56] By 1890, the city's population surpassed 100,000.[43] Some of the city's most notable businesses were founded during this period of growth and innovation, including L. S. Ayres (1872), Eli Lilly and Company (1876), Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company (1910), and Allison Transmission (1915). Once home to 60 automakers, Indianapolis rivaled Detroit as a center of automobile manufacturing.[57] The city was an early focus of labor organization.[43] The Indianapolis Street Car Strike of 1913 and subsequent police mutiny and riots led to the creation of the state's earliest labor-protection laws, including a minimum wage, regular work weeks, and improved working conditions.[58] The International Typographical Union and United Mine Workers of America were among several influential labor unions based in the city.[43]\n\nProgressive Era to Great Depression[]\n\nSome of the city's most prominent architectural features and best-known historical events date from the turn of the 20th century. The Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, dedicated on May 15, 1902, would later become the city's unofficial symbol.[59] Ray Harroun won the inaugural running of the Indianapolis 500, held May 30, 1911, at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Indianapolis was one of the hardest hit cities in the Great Flood of 1913, resulting in five known deaths[60][61][62] and the displacement of 7,000 families.[63]\n\nAs a stop on the Underground Railroad, Indianapolis had one of the largest black populations in the Northern States, until the Great Migration.[64] Led by D. C. Stephenson, the Indiana Klan became the most powerful political and social organization in Indianapolis from 1921 through 1928, controlling the City Council and the Board of School Commissioners, among others. At its height, more than 40% of native-born white males in Indianapolis claimed membership in the Klan.\n\nScript error: No such module \"wide image\".\n\nPost–World War II[]\n\nWhile campaigning in the city in 1968, Robert F. Kennedy delivered one of the most lauded speeches in 20th century American history, following the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.[65][66][67] As in most U.S. cities during the Civil Rights Movement, the city experienced strained race relations. A 1971 federal court decision forcing Indianapolis Public Schools to implement desegregation busing proved controversial.[68]\n\nDuring the administration of mayor Richard Lugar (1968–1976), the city and county governments were consolidated. Known as Unigov (a portmanteau of \"unified\" and \"government\"), the city-county consolidation removed bureaucratic redundancies, captured increasingly suburbanizing tax revenue, and created a Republican political machine that dominated local politics until the early 2000s.[69][70] Unigov went into effect on January 1, 1970, increasing the city's land area by Template:Convert/sqmi and its population by 268,366 people.[71][72] It was the first major city-county consolidation to occur in the U.S. without a referendum since the creation of the City of Greater New York in 1898.[73]\n\nAmid the changes in government and growth, the city pursued an aggressive economic development strategy to brand Indianapolis as a sports tourism destination, known as the Indianapolis Project.[74] During the administration of the city's longest-serving mayor, William Hudnut, (1976–1992), millions of dollars were invested into sports facilities and public relations campaigns.[22] The strategy was successful in landing the U.S. Olympic Festival in 1982, securing the relocation of the Baltimore Colts in 1984, and hosting the 1987 Pan American Games.[22]\n\n1990s to present[]\n\nEconomic development initiatives focused on revitalizing the city's downtown continued in the 1990s under the mayoral administration of Stephen Goldsmith. During this period, a number of cultural amenities were completed at White River State Park, the Canal Walk continued development,[42] Circle Centre Mall was completed,[75] and new sports venues (Victory Field and Gainbridge Fieldhouse) were opened. In 1999, several cultural districts were designated to capitalize on cultural assets within historically significant neighborhoods unique to the city's heritage as a means to promote continued economic development.[76]\n\nDuring the 2000s, the city invested heavily in public infrastructure projects, including two of the largest building projects in the city's history: the $1.1 billion Indianapolis International Airport Colonel H. Weir Cook Terminal and $720 million Lucas Oil Stadium, both opened in 2008.[77][78] A $275 million expansion of the Indiana Convention Center was completed in 2011.[79] Construction began that year on DigIndy, a $1.9 billion project to correct the city's combined sewer overflows by 2025.[80] Rapid transit was reintroduced to Indianapolis with the opening of IndyGo's $96 million Red Line bus rapid transit project in 2019.[81]\n\nGeography[]\n\nIndianapolis is located in the East North Central region of the Midwestern United States, about 14 miles (23 km) south-southeast of Indiana's geographic center.[82] According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Indianapolis (balance) encompasses a total area of Template:Convert/sqmi, of which Template:Convert/sqmi is land and Template:Convert/sqmi is water.[4] It is the 18th largest city by land area in the U.S.\n\nAs a consolidated city-county, the city's municipal boundaries are coterminous with Marion County, except the autonomous and semi-autonomous municipalities outlined in Unigov.[43][83] Nine civil townships form the broadest geographic divisions within the city and county.[84] The consolidated city-county borders the adjacent counties of Boone to the northwest; Hamilton to the north; Hancock to the east; Shelby to the southeast; Johnson to the south; Morgan to the southwest; and Hendricks to the west.[85]\n\nIndianapolis is located within a physiographic province known as the Tipton Till Plain, a flat, gently rolling terrain underlain by glacial deposits known as till. The lowest point in the city is about 650 feet (Template:Convert/pround m) above mean sea level, with the highest natural elevation at about 900 feet (Template:Convert/pround m) above sea level.[86] Few hills or short ridges, known as kames, rise about 100 feet (Template:Convert/pround m) to 130 feet (Template:Convert/pround m) above the surrounding terrain. The city lies just north of the Indiana Uplands, a region characterized by rolling hills and high limestone content.\n\nIndianapolis is located in the West Fork White River drainage basin, part of the larger Mississippi River watershed[87] via the Wabash and Ohio rivers.[85] The White River is fed by some 35 tributaries, including Fall Creek and Pogue's Run, as it flows 31 miles (50 km) north to south through Indianapolis.[88] The city's largest water bodies are artificial quarry lakes or reservoirs.\n\nFlora and fauna[]\n\nIndianapolis is situated in the Southern Great Lakes forests ecoregion which in turn is located within the larger temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome, as defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature.[89] Based on the United States Environmental Protection Agency's alternative classification system, the city is located in the Eastern Corn Belt Plains, an area of the U.S. known for its fertile agricultural land.[90]\n\nMuch of the decidious forests that once covered 98% of the region were cleared for agriculture and urban development, contributing to considerable habitat loss.[89][87] Indianapolis's current urban tree canopy averages approximately 33%.[91] A rare example of old-growth forest in the city can be found on Template:Convert/acres of Crown Hill Cemetery's North Woods in the Butler–Tarkington neighborhood.[92] The cemetery's Template:Convert/acres represents the largest green space in Center Township, home to an abundance of wildlife and some 130 species of trees.[93] Native trees most common to the area include varieties of ash, maple, and oak.[89] Several invasive species are also common in Indianapolis, including tree of heaven, wintercreeper, Amur honeysuckle, and Callery or Bradford pear.[94][95]\n\nA 2016 bioblitz along three of the city's riparian corridors found 590 taxa.[87] Urban wildlife common to the Indianapolis area include mammals such as the white-tailed deer, eastern chipmunk, eastern cottontail, and the eastern grey and American red squirrels.[89] In recent years, local raccoon and groundhog populations have increased alongside sightings of American badgers, beavers, mink, coyotes, and red fox.[96][97] Birds native to the area include the northern cardinal, wood thrush, eastern screech owl, mourning dove, pileated and red-bellied woodpeckers, and wild turkey.[89] Located in the Mississippi Flyway, the city sees more than 400 migratory bird species throughout the year.[98][99][100] Some 57 species of fish can be found in the city's waterways, including bass and sunfish.[88] Some federally-designated endangered and threatened species are native to the Indianapolis area, including several species of freshwater mussels, the rusty patched bumble bee, Indiana bat, northern long-eared bat, and the running buffalo clover.[101]\n\nIn recent years, the National Wildlife Federation has ranked Indianapolis among the ten most wildlife-friendly cities in the U.S.[102]\n\nClimate[]\n\nScript error: No such module \"Multiple image\".\n\nIndianapolis has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa), but can be considered a borderline humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cfa) using the Template:Convert/C isotherm. It experiences four distinct seasons.[103] The city lies at the transition between USDA plant hardiness zones 5b and 6a.[104]\n\nTypically, summers are hot, humid, and wet. Winters are generally cold with moderate snowfall. The July daily average temperature is Template:Convert/°F. High temperatures reach or exceed Template:Convert/°F an average of 18 days each year,[105] and occasionally exceed Template:Convert/°F. Spring and autumn are usually pleasant, if at times unpredictable; midday temperature drops exceeding Template:Convert/F-change are common during March and April, and instances of very warm days (Template:Convert/°F) followed within 36 hours by snowfall are not unusual during these months. Winters are cold, with an average January temperature of Template:Convert/°F. Temperatures dip to Template:Convert/°F or below an average of 3.7 nights per year.[105]\n\nThe rainiest months occur in the spring and summer, with slightly higher averages during May, June, and July. May is typically the wettest, with an average of Template:Convert/in of precipitation.[105] Most rain is derived from thunderstorm activity; there is no distinct dry season, although occasional droughts occur. Severe weather is not uncommon, particularly in the spring and summer months; the city experiences an average of 20 thunderstorm days annually.[106]\n\nThe city's average annual precipitation is Template:Convert/in, with snowfall averaging Template:Convert/in per season. Official temperature extremes range from Template:Convert/°F, set on July 14, 1936,[107] to Template:Convert/°F, set on January 19, 1994.[107][108] Template:Indianapolis weatherbox\n\nCityscape[]\n\nIndianapolis is a planned city. On January 11, 1820, the Indiana General Assembly authorized a committee to select a site in central Indiana for the new state capital, appointing Alexander Ralston and Elias Pym Fordham to survey and design a town plan for Indianapolis. Ralston had been a surveyor for the French architect Pierre L'Enfant, assisting him with the plan for Washington, D.C. Ralston's original plan for Indianapolis called for a town of Template:Convert/sqmi, near the confluence of the White River and Fall Creek.[109]\n\nThe plan, known as the Mile Square, is bounded by East, West, North, and South streets, centered on a traffic circle, called Monument Circle (originally Circle Street), from which Indianapolis's \"Circle City\" nickname originated.[110] Four diagonal streets radiated a block from Monument Circle: Massachusetts, Virginia, Kentucky, and Indiana avenues.[111] The city's address numbering system begins at the intersection of Washington and Meridian streets.[112] Before its submersion into a sanitary tunnel, Pogue's Run was included into the plan, disrupting the rectilinear street grid to the southeast.\n\nCompared with similar-sized American cities, Indianapolis is unique in that it contains some 200 farms covering thousands of acres of agricultural land within its municipal boundaries.[113] Equestrian farms and corn and soybean fields interspersed with suburban development are commonplace on the city's periphery, especially in Franklin Township.[114]\n\nArchitecture[]\n\nScript error: No such module \"Labelled list hatnote\".\n\nNoted as one of the finest examples of the City Beautiful movement design in the U.S., the Indiana World War Memorial Plaza Historic District began construction in 1921 in downtown Indianapolis.[115][116] The district, a National Historic Landmark, encompasses several examples of neoclassical architecture, including the American Legion, Central Library, and Birch Bayh Federal Building and United States Courthouse. The district is also home to several sculptures and memorials, Depew Memorial Fountain, and open space, hosting many annual civic events.[116]\n\nAfter completion of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, an ordinance was passed in 1905 restricting building heights on the traffic circle to 86 ft (Template:Convert/pround m)Template:Convert/test/Aon to protect views of the 284 ft (Template:Convert/pround m)Template:Convert/test/Aon monument.[117] The ordinance was revised in 1922, permitting buildings to rise to 108 ft (Template:Convert/pround m)Template:Convert/test/Aon, with an additional 42 ft (Template:Convert/pround m)Template:Convert/test/Aon allowable with a series of setbacks.[117] A citywide height restriction ordinance was instituted in 1912, barring structures over 200 ft (Template:Convert/pround m)Template:Convert/test/Aon.[118] Completed in 1962, the City-County Building was the first skyscraper in the city, surpassing the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in height by nearly 100 ft (Template:Convert/pround m)Template:Convert/test/Aon.[119] A building boom, lasting from 1982 to 1990, saw the construction of six of the city's ten tallest buildings.[120][121] The tallest is Salesforce Tower, completed in 1990 at 811 ft (Template:Convert/pround m)Template:Convert/test/Aon.[122] Indiana limestone is the signature building material in Indianapolis, widely included in the city's many monuments, churches, academic, government, and civic buildings.[120]\n\nNeighborhoods[]\n\nScript error: No such module \"Labelled list hatnote\".\n\nFor statistical purposes, the consolidated city-county is organized into 99 \"neighborhood areas\" with most containing numerous individual historic and cultural districts, subdivisions, and some semi-autonomous towns. In total, some 500 self-identified neighborhood associations are listed in the city's Registered Community Organization system.[123] As a result of the city's expansive land area, Indianapolis has a unique urban-to-rural transect, ranging from dense urban neighborhoods to suburban tract housing subdivisions, to rural villages.[124]\n\nTypical of American cities in the Midwest, Indianapolis urbanized in the late-19th and early-20th centuries, resulting in the development of relatively dense, well-defined neighborhoods clustered around streetcar corridors, especially in Center Township.[125] Notable streetcar suburbs include Broad Ripple, Irvington, and University Heights.[126] Starting in the mid-20th century, the post–World War II economic expansion and subsequent suburbanization greatly influenced the city's development patterns. From 1950 to 1970, nearly 100,000 housing units were built in Marion County, most outside Center Township in suburban neighborhoods such as Castleton, Eagledale, and Nora.[126]\n\nSince the 2000s, downtown Indianapolis and surrounding neighborhoods have seen increased reinvestment mirroring nationwide market trends, driven by empty nesters and millennials.[127][128] Renewed interest in urban living has been met with some dispute regarding gentrification and affordable housing.[129][130][131] According to a Center for Community Progress report, neighborhoods like Cottage Home and Fall Creek Place have experienced measurable gentrification since 2000.[132] The North Meridian Street Historic District is among the most affluent urban neighborhoods in the U.S., with a mean household income of $102,599 in 2017.[133]\n\nParkland[]\n\nScript error: No such module \"Labelled list hatnote\".\n\nIndianapolis maintains 212 public parks covering Template:Convert/LoffAoffDbSoffNa of green space, representing about 5.1% of the city's land area.[134][135] Amenities include 129 playgrounds, 155 sports fields, 153 miles (246 km) of recreational trails, 23 recreation and nature centers, 21 spraygrounds, 19 aquatic centers, 13 golf courses, and four dog parks.[134] The department also provides 2,400 programs and classes annually.[136] Eagle Creek Park is the largest and most visited park in the city and ranks among the largest municipal parks in the U.S., covering Template:Convert/LoffAoffDbSoffNa.[137]\n\nMilitary Park was established as the city's first state-owned park in 1852.

As a result, the Indianapolis metropolitan area had the highest concentration of chain restaurants per capita of any market in the U.S. in 2008, with one chain restaurant for every 1,459 people—44% higher than the national average.[292] In recent years, immigrants have opened some 800 ethnic restaurants.[291]\n\nFilm and television[]\n\nTemplate:Main cat Template:Main cat\n\nIndianapolis natives have left a mark on the entertainment industry, most notably during the Classical Hollywood cinema era.

Many functions of the city and county governments are consolidated, though some remain separate.[3] The city has a strong mayor–council form of government overseeing six administrative departments. Marion County also contains some 60 taxing units, nine separate civil township governments, and seven special-purpose municipal corporations.[348][349]\n\nThe executive branch is headed by an elected mayor, who serves as the chief executive of both the city and county.[350] Joe Hogsett is the 49th and current mayor of Indianapolis.
