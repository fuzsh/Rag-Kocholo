        "text": "Hugh Panaro is perhaps best known for having played the coveted role of the Phantom in Broadway’s The Phantom of the Opera over 2,000 times, including the 25th Anniversary production. In fact, Hugh is one of the few actors to be cast by Harold Prince as both The Phantom and Raoul in the show’s Broadway production and is currently starring as the titular role in the immersive Off-Broadway production of Sweeney Todd.\n\nHugh made his Broadway debut in the original production of Les Misérables as Marius, the role he originated in the First National Company. He also created the roles of Buddy in the original Side Show (Sony cast recording); Julian Craster in Jule Styne’s last musical, The Red Shoes; and the title role in the American premiere of Cameron Mackintosh’s Martin Guerre. Hugh was nominated for an Outer Critics Circle Award for his performance in the title role of Elton John’s Lestat, based on Anne Rice’s Vampire Chronicles.\n\nHe made his West End debut in the original London company of Harold Prince’s Show Boat as Gaylord Ravenal, the role he previously played in the Broadway and Toronto productions.\n\nAt the prestigious 5th Avenue Theater in Seattle, Hugh played George Seurat in Sam Buntrock’s Tony Award-winning production of Sunday in the Park with George, and Robert in Stephen Sondheim’s Company. Hugh’s performance as Jean Valjean in the Walnut Street Theater’s production of Les Misérables earned him the prestigious Barrymore Award, for which he was again nominated after a turn as Fagin in Oliver! In 2012, Hugh was honored with the Edwin Forrest Award for his long-term contribution to the theater.\n\nAn active concert artist, Panaro has performed with numerous symphony orchestras including Dallas, Detroit, San Francisco, Seattle Utah Symphonies, and the London Sinfonietta, among many others. He had the privilege of performing in the world premiere of Penderecki’s Te Deum at Carnegie Hall and was a guest soloist with the Buffalo Philharmonic, conducted by Marvin Hamlisch. His recordings include Jerome Kern Treasury, the original cast recording of Side Show, Tap Your Troubles Away (Herman), The Centennial (Weil), and Life On The Wicked Stage (Kern). His first solo CD, recorded with Sony/BMG, was released in the summer of 2007. In addition, he toured throughout Europe with the legendary Barbra Streisand. A native of Philadelphia, Panaro graduated from Temple University and was awarded the Boyer College of Music Certificate of Honor.\n\nMorgan James is a classically trained vocalist, Broadway veteran and recording artist.\n\nMorgan recently paid tribute to Judy Garland for her centennial, where she most recently performed “Get Happy” with Sinfonia Gulf Coast and Nashville Symphony.\n\nMs. James is a frequent symphony pops soloist, and most recently she premiered her brand new show “Symphonic Soul: The Magic of the Memphis Sound” with the Virginia Symphony, Wheeling Symphony Orchestra, and Sinfonia Gulf Coast. Other appearances include the Cleveland Pops, Houston Symphony, Sun Valley Music Festival, American Pops Orchestra, Spokane Symphony, Detroit Symphony, Harrisburg Symphony, San Diego Symphony, Utah Symphony, Youngstown Symphony, Gulf Coast Symphony, Missouri Symphony, Sinfonia Gulf Coast, Ocean City Pops, Greensboro Symphony, Charlotte Symphony, Allentown Symphony, Lansing Symphony, Atlanta Symphony, Long Bay Symphony, and many more.\n\nA Leonard Bernstein aficionado, Ms. James has appeared with the Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra, Malaysian Philharmonic, Breckinridge Music Festival, Utah Symphony, Louisville Orchestra, Colorado Symphony, and Wichita Symphony performing her solo Bernstein show, conducted by Teddy Abrams. Morgan was also featured with the Philadelphia Orchestra in West Side Story in concert, conducted by Yannick Nézet-Séguin. Morgan has had the honor of being in the Bernstein MASS four times: most recently with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at Ravinia Music festival, conducted by Marin Alsop; with the Louisville Orchestra (conducted by Teddy Abrams), the Philadelphia Orchestra (conducted by Yannick Nézet-Séguin), as well as with Baltimore Symphony at Carnegie Hall and the Kennedy Center, (also conducted by Marin Alsop).\n\nOn Broadway, Morgan has appeared in five Original Broadway Casts: Motown: The Musical, Godspell, Wonderland, The Addams Family, and Kristin Chenoweth’s For The Girls. She routinely tours Europe and the US with her own soul band, and she also toured Europe, Australia, and the U.S. with Scott Bradlee’s Postmodern Jukebox, and is featured in ten of their videos. Her videos on YouTube have garnered 275 million views (and counting).\n\nAs a recording artist, Ms. James is about to release her fifth studio album of original soul music entitled “Nobody’s Fool”, in addition to “Memphis Magnetic”, “A Very Magnetic"
