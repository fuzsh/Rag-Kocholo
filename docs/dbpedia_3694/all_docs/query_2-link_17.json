The club wants to fill 20 slots, so friends are invited.\n\nSaturday, Oct. 12, 2 p.m., Free Rein tour in Spokane Valley.\n\nChanges due for new school year\n\nA new school year means fewer students in Spokane schools and ever-younger classmates, Holmes Elementary Principal Kale Colyar says.\n\nColyar described the changes as about 15 Spokane-North Rotary members quickly filled the Holmes supply closet on Aug. 19.\n\nâThank you. Your help means the world to us,â Colyar said. He thanked the group for providing a new washing machine and dryer and for funding the supplies and helping stock the school products.\n\nDue to a newly scheduled District meeting, he had only a few minutes to talk about the new school year, Colyar offered some details.\n\nWith a declining birth population, schools everywhere are dealing with reduced enrollments. In Seattle, for example, some 20 schools are planned to be closed. Spokaneâs District 81 expects 29,000 or fewer students, about 1,000 less than previous years.\n\nColyar said Holmes expects to have 380 students, about 20 fewer than in previous years.\n\nBut a big change is enrolling 4-year and 5-year old pre-school students, he said. âAnd we donât have pre-school certificated teachers yet,â he said.\n\nColyar said Holmes also will have 71 kindergartners, requiring a fourth class, and hiring another teacher for the younger students.\n\nColyar said Holmes again expects âabout a 45 percent mobility rate,â meaning the number of departing and arriving students during the school year.\n\nHoliday times, like Halloween and the Christmas weeks are times when most students leave or arrive, he said.\n\nSandy Fink, the clubâs coordinator with Holmes, again headed the annual supply project.\n\nThe supply closet sundries included stacking cartons of rows of Clorox disinfecting wipes, which seemed enough to clean up any needs.\n\nSandy also mentioned a new product â âsentence stripsâ â will help reading and writing skills.\n\nColyar thanked the club for Spokane-Northâs long time commitment to Holmes and to the supply closet project, which began two principalâs ago before his tenure at the school.\n\nAlso Supplied were: Pencil Sharpeners and Post it Easel pads\n\nBulletin editors: Chuck Rehberg and Sandy Fink.\n\nTransitions - Jessica Burke\n\nNorth Notes\n\nSpokane-North Rotary Club\n\nAugust 12, 2024\n\nCalendar:\n\nAug. 19: Noon meeting at Holmes Elementary School.

Spouses and guests are welcome to join. Sandy has the luncheon list.\n\nHappy Buck$:\n\nBill Simer was $2 happy that he met no bears during an outing near Sullivan Lake with a retired forest ranger. Bill said the ranger carried a .44 magnum, but Bill âjust had a sandwich.â\n\nDave Hayward was $5 happy and Jerry Logan for $2 for the âmile-longâ tour of the âamazingâ Amazon warehouse tour in West Spokane.\n\nJanine McCorkle was happy to win the weekly ticket draw, netting $23. She said she had never won a ticket like that in years of playing.\n\nSheila Fritts was happy about the success of a new book club she has joined, a club that meets at the Bark.\n\nTours and activities:\n\nClub activities chair Laura Zahn said upcoming events:\n\nTuesday, Aug. 27 from 3 to 7 p.m.: Community table at Fairwood Farmersâ Market. Fundraiser for Mobius science kits for Holmes 3rd and 5th graders. Two shifts planned during the market hours. Some members are needed at 12:30 p.m. for set-up.

Founded by four groups of Catholic Sisters, Transitions has developed into a comprehensive program to provide needed help.\n\nAt the clubâs Aug. 12 luncheon, Transitions Development Director Jessica Burke described the history and activities.\n\nIn 1986 the nuns established Miryamâs House a residential program for women recovering from homelessness and abuse.\n\nFollowing that were The Womenâs Drop-In Center in 1991; the Transitional Living Center and EduCare in 1993; the New Leaf Kitchen and CafÃ© in 2006; and, the Home Yard Cottages in 2018.\n\nWhile the needs are big, many of the groups are small, Burke said.\n\nMiryamâs has space for 9 women without children. The TLC, for homeless women and children, has 16 apartments and one permanent housing unit. Finding housing is difficult she said, adding many of the clients can stay 12 to 16 months, and âwe want less than two years.â\n\nThe larger Home Yard Cottages, for families and individuals, have 24 units, ranging from studio size to three bedrooms with 700 square feet, Burke said.\n\nEduCare has licensed childcare and the TLC has infants, toddlers and pre-school kids who are homeless and recovering from trauma.\n\nThe New Leaf Kitchen helps women with hands-on training. âSome did not even know how to make coffee,â she said.\n\nAt the Womenâs Hearth, women have access to phones, computer, healthy food, hygiene supplies and showers.\n\nThe extensive âneeds listâ for the various programs include bus passes, diapers, cleaning products, cookware, towels, school supplies and various types of clothing.\n\nAs for the mounting needs at Transitions, Burke said âlast year 1,100 women were served and we passed that this year in July.â\n\nAs development director, Burke writes all of the grants. Transitions fund drives include the 22nd Annual People Who Care event Oct. 15 at the Davenport Grand, plus a âSpokane Mardi Brasâ program with Volunteers of America, and Giving Tuesdays and Give BIG initiatives.\n\nBurke said the Transitions clientele has challenges, citing one case where law enforcement was called in an abusive instance where a murder was involved.\n\nAsked why local abusive cases are so high, she said, âwho knows?â She added that area widespread poverty levels are part of the problem.\n\nThough the numbers of nuns have declined since the founding of Miryamâs in 1986, the ladies leading Transitions have filled some of the needs and the motto âMoving Lives Forwardâ still applies.\n\nBulletin editors: Chuck Rehberg and Sandy Fink.\n\nNortheast Community Center ZONE - Jene Ray\n\nNorth Notes\n\nSpokane-North Rotary Club\n\nAugust 5, 2024\n\nCalendar:\n\nAug. 12: Noon meeting at the Bark.

A formal introduction is planned.\n\nHillyard is now âin the ZONEâ\n\nNortheast Spokane now has an aggressive new plan to develop the area of quality of life of social, health, education and recreational needs.\n\nThe theme is âYou Belong Hereâ in the Northeast Community Center ZONE.\n\nAt the Aug. 5 club luncheon, Jene Ray described the challenges and the ambitious plans in the neighborhoods of Hillyard and nearby environs.\n\nRay, a 2022 graduate of Leadership Spokane, was a classroom teacher for 20 years, then spent five years in Olympia, advocating for student-centered policies and funding pre-school through workforce development. She then directed operations for an educational research center at UW-Tacoma. Since 2018 she has supported the Northeast ZONE, modeled after the Harlem Childrenâs Zone.\n\nAs she discussed the plans, Jene walked about the packed Barkâs conference room, effectively circulating to reach all attending. Jerry Logan, a former education professor, said Jene looked like a kindergarten class making sure every student gets some attention.\n\nRay also is a founding member of Lumen School, Spokaneâs high school whose class members have their own kids. Our club sponsors a Lumen scholarship annually.\n\nJene circulated a small map outlining the Northeast neighborhood areas and schools âHillyard, Shiloh Hills, Whitman, Bemiss Nevada Heights, Minnehaha, and Chief Garry â where elementary schools funnel into Shaw, Garry and Yasuhara middle schools and then into Rogers High. She added some Holmes Elementary students also reach the ZONE.\n\nWhy create the ZONE?\n\nRay said the area was focused on Shaw, where she said âstudents just were not ready for the next level.â Jene said the Harlem Zone was âan Obama-eraâ programâ which âlooks at all the aspects of being a student.â\n\nThus the ZONE wants to work âwith residents, schools and organizations, assuring children and youth are safe and nurtured, residents are engages and all families have what they need to thrive.â\n\nUsing an array of grants and other sources, Ray said some 17,000 families have been served at the Northeast Center and 77,000 hours of after school and summer programs have been provided.\n\nSome 12,500 hours of adult participation, especially for seniors, have been programmed, including fitness classes. Pets can be vaccinated and farmerâs markets and more than 10,000 books have been provided at the center.\n\nOn the plus side, she said Shawâs building has been remodeled, the adjacent community center has been improved. Multi-Care now provides mental health in the old Hillyard Library and dental care is âa mustâ at the center.\n\nBusy Cook Street has been âcalmingâ with $1 million improvements and neighboring streets are safer, but intruders still pose problems.\n\nAnother challenge is dealing with the North Spokane Corridor freeway. Ray said some neighborhoods east of the road âare just dirt streets,â and though a walking bridge now spans the railroad tracks and freeway, she said many parents say itâs too tough for kids to get to the community center.\n\nAnother problem is finding affordable housing for families. Many families have several children and need three or four bedrooms. Also, English is a second language for some.\n\nSo, will a Harlem project work in Hillyard?\n\nAll in the Northeast Community Center hope the ZONE may be one of the answers\n\nBulletin editors: Chuck Rehberg and Sandy Fink.

In its âNo Kid Hungryâ national program some $134 million was spent last year feeding hungry kids.\n\nThat group, founded 40 years ago, also helps with disaster relief and is now expanding to parts of India.\n\nIn the Spokane area, Stevenson said 11,395 students in classes from kindergarten to high schools were provided food on weekends and elsewhere. Some 250 groups have sponsored schools including Stevens County and Pasco schools and some in North Idaho.\n\nLife Center Church has adopted Holmes Elementary Schoolâs Bite2Go program. Tom said Glover Middle School still needs a sponsor in our area.\n\nBite2Go, Tom said, âis great for the kids, but also for the businesses and other organizations. Rotary involvement, he said, includes Club 21, Aurora Northwest, South and some in the Tri-Cities.\n\nHe said groups pay $15 a week for elementary schools and $24 a week for middle schools.\n\nTom said on Tuesdays and Thursdays groups of 60 gather in a building next to 2nd Harvest and fill the bags âof real food, not just snacksâ to distribute.\n\nOne of the videos Tom showed said âone in five kids in America live in food insecurity.â\n\nBite2Go wants to keep taking a bite out of that problem.\n\nAs Tom says: âKids can change the world â if they are fed.â\n\nBulletin editors: Chuck Rehberg and Sandy Fink.\n\nSaling Scholarship Award - Payton Nachtigal\n\nNorth Notes\n\nSpokane-North Rotary Club\n\nJuly 22, 2024\n\nCalendar:\n\nJuly 29: Noon meeting at the Bark.

The club wants to fill 20 slots, so friends are invited.\n\nPayton is a special Saling scholar\n\nThis yearâs Saling Scholarship winner has a variety of skills and interests.\n\nAt the clubâs July 22 luncheon, we learned that Payton Nachtigal rides horses, shoots well, works with goats and is mastering sign language.\n\nPayton and her family live on a 300 acre ranch near Davenport. Her mom, Robin, joined the lunch along with Christine DeGeare, scholarship and alumni relations manager for the Community Colleges of Spokane Foundation.\n\nClub Scholarship Chairman Jerry Logan introduced the program and the $1,500 scholarship award for this year and again next year. The program has shifted from graduating high school students to community college students.\n\nDeGeare said her office received 742 student scholarship applicants. Ten finalists were selected for the Saling award, named for the late Jerry Saling, long-time club member, former state legislator and former Community Colleges of Spokane president.\n\nDeGeare, who works at the collegesâ downtown office, said even with those applications many students still are not aware of the various scholarships available. In response to a question, Christine said she is willing to work with the club in incorporate concepts of Rotaryâs 4-Way Test in the clubâs application process.\n\nIn her application, Payton wrote about her familyâs 25 horses and the other animals on the farm. She has her own herd of Champion Boer Market goats. She was active in 4H, FFA and high school rodeo. She graduated with a 3.8 GPA while earning six varsity letters in softball, volleyball, cheerleading and band.\n\nPayton qualified three times to the National High School Rodeo and seven times to the Silverstate International Rodeo. She is still active in barrel racing and breakaway roping events.\n\nJerry Logan said âPayton is an Annie Oakley, citing her shooting awards and working with horses.â\n\nAnd she accomplished all of this while working through a learning disability.\n\nIn her application, Payton wrote, âIn kindergarten, a teacher realized that I learn differently than other students. I have a learning disability and we spent the next 12 years devising a learning system that worked best for me.â She achieved a 3.6 GPA at SFCC and plans to graduate next June.\n\nAt the club, Payton said she would like to work in an elementary or middle school as a teacher or para-professional educator specializing in American Sign Language.\n\nAsked on her application about financial need, Payton responded that âher dad is in a wheelchair and is a C1 quadriplegic after his car was hit by a drunk driver. He struggles every day to do the simple things in life.â\n\nHer mom works at a medical supply company.\n\nPayton added: âI want to make a difference for students who are enrolled in schoolsâ special needs programs.\n\nâMy learning disability has taught me to never give up and to try my best at everything I do, and that sometimes a person just has to look a different path to reach their goals in life.â\n\nBulletin editors: Chuck Rehberg and Sandy Fink.\n\nJOYA - Teresa Conway\n\nNorth Notes\n\nSpokane-North Rotary Club\n\nJuly 15, 2024\n\nCalendar:\n\nJuly 22: Noon meeting at the Bark.

John himself has amassed more than 10,000 points and asked other members to discuss the program details with him.\n\nTours and activities:\n\nClub activities chair Laura Zahn said upcoming events include a Riverpark Square tour at 1:15 p.m. on July 29; and a booth at the Fairwood Market on Tuesday, Aug. 27. A day in September for a Habitat for Humanity build also is planned.\n\nAffair\n\nJump for âJoyaâ at its new site\n\nWith a new name and a much larger new space, Joya, Spokaneâs remarkable pediatric therapy provider has nearly doubled its ability to help infants and young children.\n\nFounded in 1960 as the Spokane Guildsâ School & Neuromuscular Center, the organization has helped thousands of children in Spokane County ages 0 to 3 in need of therapy and special education services.\n\nAt the July 15 club luncheon, Teresa Conway, Joya grants and communications manager, recalled the history and new developments for the institution.\n\nConwayâs story is personal. Her son, James, she said had a normal birth but at age 3 months got pneumonia and needed help. The Guildsâ School staff was there to help.\n\nResults like her case, she said, âis a gut check. Parents are frightened.â In some cases, she added, special child care costs often exceed $1 million to cover uncompensated care.\n\nTo raise funds the organization started collecting pennies. Annual âKid for Kids Penney Driveâ projects were familiar. The late Bill Hiatt of our club made it a Spokane-North project to help count the change every spring.\n\nConway discussed how the Guildsâ School was founded in 1960 by several women working in the Cowley Youth Building at Westminister Church, 411 S. Washington, to arrange assessment, therapy, education and support for the children and their families.\n\nAfter 22 years, as the program grew, the Guildsâ School was located in 1982 in a former School District 81 elementary student at 2118 W. Garland, under long-time director Dick Boysen. He worked with the program for 42 years, retiring as executive director.\n\nConway said in 2017 land was purchased from a former convent at 1016 N. Superior. The expanded facility, which opened in spring of 2022, allows growth and access to the freeway and to the University District staff and students.\n\nThe name was rebranded to âJoya,â which means âgemâ in Spanish. It also connotes the joy of infants and young children who have grown through the program.\n\nShe said children served increased from 352 in 2022-23 to 509 last year. Conway said, â50 percent of the children served reached age-appropriate milestones and did not require additional services after Joya.â She added that 486 parents and guardians received training to help aid in the child development last year.\n\nJoya also has 15 clinical rotations, 5 special education practicums and 13 medicine and physiatry residents, among the staff support. This year 9 pediatric medical residency rotations will be started.\n\nJoya still collects pennies, but last year is secured a $3 million federal grant for neurodevelopmental research and training.\n\nConway said financial elements are âin thirds â one-third state and federal disability act money, one-third in philanthropy and one-third in private insurance.â\n\nJoya, starting with all those pennies, and other help, indeed has become a âgemâ in Spokane health care for infant and children and their parents.\n\nBulletin editors: Chuck Rehberg and Sandy Fink.\n\nFree Food Pantries - Mary Charbonneau\n\nNorth Notes\n\nSpokane-North Rotary Club\n\nJuly 8, 2024\n\nCalendar:\n\nJuly 15: Noon meeting at the Bark.

She also wants to add sites in the West Plains area.\n\nShe said a wide assortment of folks have built little free pantries, including Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts. A Great Family Project site distributes how-to building kits with patterns and assembly tips. Food items come from a variety of sources including large food banks.\n\nAt the luncheon she showed a small grocery bag with her âtop five items,â including dry cereal, canned fish, a chicken m eat pouch, a banana and a jar of peanut butter (âthe top favorite.â). Spaghetti and sauce also are popular, because the dishes can last several days, she added.\n\nThe free pantry idea started several years ago, spurred nation-wide by the pandemic in 2020, Charbonneau said.\n\nShe said a statewide survey shows that in Spokane County 49 percent are struggling to get adequate food, adding, â56 percent of those households have kids in the home.â One website added that â29 percent of those experiencing food insecurity do not qualify for federal nutrition programs.â\n\nMary & Paul's Little Pantry\n\nWith the help of her husband, Bill, she said up to 250 pounds a day and 100 users are distributed at her pantry near Monroe and Montgomery. Bill, using their pickup, loads about 500 pounds of items weekly to that little pantry.\n\nMary said each little free pantry has a âsteward,â who monitors the site. She said 40 to 50 stewards meet monthly to share ideas.\n\nThe littlefreepantrySpokane.org site, created two years ago, has 4,100 members and lists the pantry âno-nos,â including no medicines or vitamins and no glass items.\n\nThe site adds: âStay on topic. No politics. No irrelevant shared links. No food deliveries and no pictures with permission.â\n\nThe Spokane free pantry site also adds:\n\nâSharing food is more than nourishment; itâs a profound act of generosity and connection.\n\nâItâs a reminder that amidst our differences, we all hunger for kindness and community.â\n\nBulletin editors: Chuck Rehberg and Sandy Fink.\n\nExpo â74 Memories -- Mike Kobluk\n\nNORTH NOTES\n\nSpokane-North Rotary Club\n\nApril 29, 2024\n\nCalendar:\n\nMay 6: Noon meeting at the Bark.

Weâll have a sign-up sheet at our meeting next Monday.\n\nWorld-class memories remembered\n\nThe theme for the clubâs April 29 luncheon clearly was âThanks for the Memories.â\n\nAs the 50th anniversary of Spokaneâs Expo â74 Worldâs Fair, Mike Kobluk, hired in 1972 as manager of special events for Expo, talked about the amazing roster of performances throughout the six-month fair.\n\nKobluk, quickly then named manager of performance and visual events for the fair, said that when challenges mounted to get top-rated stars to attend Expo it was comedian Bob Hope who made a key difference.\n\nKoblukâs talk was titled âExpo Memoriesâ and Hopeâs longtime signature song was of course âThanks for the Memories.â\n\nAnd when Hope delivered, the trickle of stars opened the floodgates of first-class events.\n\nKobluk said dozens of acts remained interested, but un-signed, for the small inland Northwest city.\n\nBut when Hope not only agreed to perform, and also starred in a television ad saying he would attend, suddenly top performers agreed, Kobluk said.\n\nSuddenly, he added, Expo, which some feared would be like âa three-week county fairâ to what The Spokane Daily Chronicle called it âthe center of entertainment for six months.â\n\nAt the lunch, Kobluk distributed a list of more than 100 attractions that came to Expo â74.\n\nThe diverse acts included the Seattle Operaâs âAida,â Bachman-Turner Overdrive, Harry Belafonte, Jack Benny, the Carpenters, Chicago, the Cleveland Orchestra, Rita Coolidge and Kris Kristofferson, Ella Fitzgerald, Festa Brazil, Margot Fonteyn and the London Ballet, Merle Haggard, Bob Hope of course, the Irish Rovers, gymnast Olga Korbut, the Joffrey City Centre Ballet, Liberace, Gordon Lightfoot, The Limelighters with Glenn Yarbrough, and the 100-plus member Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra with Zubin Mehta.\n\nThe list continued with mime Marcel Marceau, Russiaâs Moiseyev Dance Company, Spokane-native opera singer Patrice Munsel, Jim Nabors, Itzhak Perlman, Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra, Buck Owens, Roberta Peters, Charley Pride, the Pointer Sisters, Helen Reddy, the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Seals & Croft, Isaac Stern, Van Cliburn, ballet dancer Edward Villella, Walt Wagner, Porter Wagoner, Lawrence Welk, Roger Williams and the Royal Lipizzaner Stallions.\n\nSports fans also enjoyed the Soviet National Basketball Team, the Soviet Championship Skaters, Rodeo and Wild West Shows, the Seattle Supersonics, a pre-season NFL game with the New England Patriots and Denver Broncos, and the WSU-Kansas football game.\n\nWith that lineup, that âcenter of entertainmentâ claim was realized.\n\nKobluk said âit was a real miracleâ that the tangle of railroads from Trent (now Spokane Falls Blvd.) north to the Spokane River was removed quickly enough to open the space which now covers Riverfront Park.\n\nHe said a bit of lucky confusion made that happen. While a Spokane delegation went to Chicago to ask a railroad executive to clear the tracks, Lincoln Savings president Roderick A. âRodâ Lindsay, Expo board chairman, announced the group. A secretary carried the message and the railroad leader came out, expecting his long-time friend, then New York City Mayor John Lindsay.\n\nAfter the confusion was cleared up, the railroad leader said, while you are here, come on in. And soon the railroad agreed to move the obstacles, clearing the space for Expo.\n\nKobluk, one of the original members of the Chad Mitchell Trio from Spokane, used all of his contacts to lure entertainers to come to Spokane.\n\nâI wrote to all the mayors I could find to invite cultural events, bands, singers, whatever.â He said some 450 groups paid their own to provide free entertainment on site.\n\nThe Smithsonian was asked to provide folk-life events. They declined, but Bob Glatzer, of the Smithsonian staff, liked the ideas and stayed to coordinate during the fair, and stayed.\n\nClub member Art Rudd, a friend of Glatzer, said he bought one of the small houses at folk life for a kidsâ play houseâ¦and the building is still used in his yard.\n\nAsked about how Spokane could hurdle all the challenges to make Expo possible, Kobluk said, âKing Cole, called âthe father of Expo,â would not take ânoâ for an answer.â\n\nThe challenges also included finding a funding measure when a local 60 percent super levy failed by just a few votes, plus a national gasoline shortage which lower interstate speeds to 50 miles per hour.\n\nWhen a flood of entertainers flowed in Kobluk said hotels were filled, especially for some larger groups. Jack Geraghty, working with Expo prior to being Spokane mayor, found interesting lodging. A Winnebago franchise in Liberty Lake had a lot-full of recreational vehicles. The RVs were used as hotel rooms, two or four to a unit.\n\nâExpo had to buy blankets, soap and other items, but the visitorsâ unique spaces loved it,â Kobluk said.\n\nHe said when plans for the state of Washington pavilion were discussed some wanted a planetarium and others wanted an aquarium. But the winners were an Opera House and a new convention center.\n\nGiven all the entertainers who came, it would have been hard not to have a new 2,000-seat Opera House for performances.\n\nAfter Expo, Kobluk was named by the city to direct activities at the Opera House, Coliseum and Albi Stadium. He led those facilities for more than 30 years. In 1995 the Spokane Veterans Arena replaced the Coliseum, more than 100,000 square feet of convention center space was added and now Albi has been replaced by the new ONE Spokane Stadium downtown.\n\nAnd Expoâs legacy--Riverfront Parkâhas become a world-class downtown venue.\n\nEspecially for the next nine weeks we can think about the 50th Anniversary and what Expo produced.\n\nThose are enduring memories indeed.\n\nBulletin editors: Chuck Rehberg and Sandy Fink.

The table will be near the Rotary Fountain in Riverfront Park.\n\nWelcome Jessica!\n\nMelinda Keberle and Bill Simer welcomed Jessica Shew, our clubâs newest member.\n\nMelinda, a Realtor, has worked with Jessica through Idaho Central Bank. Melinda said Jessica has three children and likes to travel and drink some wine.\n\nClub President Simer said the board has a goal of adding five new members â Jessica is the first â by Sept. 30.\n\nWWII âcampâ lessons recalled\n\nCasualties of war come in varieties of ways.\n\nAnd while hostilities continued overseas, for Japanese Americans in the USA, the dreaded words at home for Japanese Americans were âincarcerationâ and âinternment.â\n\nRod Tamura said itâs important not to forget the impacts on those affected.\n\nAt the April 22 luncheon, Tamura, now retiring from a career with Spokane schools, brought a large plastic bin of family memories. There were pictures of the Tamuras, his dadâs family, and Obas, his momâs family. He shared slides, yearbooks, documents, maps and many stories.\n\nMany of the pictures showed conditions in the barren landscapes of Minidoka in southern Idaho and in Tule Lake, Calif., near the Oregon border.\n\nTwo months after Pearl Harbor, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, forcing tens of thousands of Japanese in America and Japanese Americans to abandon farms and businesses. They were boarded on buses with blackened windows as they moved inland to make-shift lodgings, former stables and other residences often ringed with barbed wire.\n\nTamura, now nearly 64, wants to continue retelling his familyâs ordeal, especially to teens who get just glimpses of this part of history.\n\nRod, raised in Spokane, said he himself âdidnât know much about the internments until he was in high school,â adding, âmom didnât want to talk about it.â\n\nHe said the ordeals for Japanese Americans âoften are glossed overâ in history lessons, so he has developed a 45-minute presentation to share his familiesâ stories.\n\nRod learned that until 1875 most Asians had no citizenship rights. During internments during World War II most rights were suspended.\n\nMuch of his story involves the Minidoka War Relocation Center in Hunt, Idaho, in Jerome County in south central Idaho. The camp housed more than 13,000 from the February 1942 opening until its closure on Oct. 28, 1945. Minidoka was one of 10 internment camps.\n\nTamura said he visited Minidoka just before Covid, saying, âOh, my God. It blew my mind.â\n\nHis family had a farm on 194 acres in Kent, Wash., but often land then could only be leased, not owned.\n\nDuring the internments, some ancestors here lodged at the Puyallup Fairgrounds, called âCamp Harmony,â but housed in former stables. Curfew there was 9 p.m. and lights out at 10 p.m., Tamura said.\n\nAt Minidoka, he said, there were 44 blocks of housing in 12 wood-framed barracks, some with just black tar paper sides, and the cold winds âswept in and sand got into everything.â Pot-bellied stoves provided the only heat. Tamura showed a picture of the guard tower, which looked inward on the residents.\n\nThe camp had two elementary schools, one junior high and one high school.\n\nPlayers could play baseball on a dirt field, and Rod showed pictures of his dad in uniforms in the mid-1930s. The irony of Americaâs past-time is a long way from Ichiro Suzukiâs pending Hall of Fame notoriety and Shohei Otaniâs multi-million wealth as baseballâs wealthiest player.\n\nFiled say 844 residents who were incarcerated at Minidoka volunteered or were drafted for military service, including William K. Nakamura, a Medal of Honor Army soldier.\n\nA national monument for Minidoka was approved in 2001.\n\nAfter retirement, he said he will continue his history lessons about the internments, especially to the young.\n\nDuring the internment, much of the land and many businesses were confiscated. It took decades to get any reparations. In 2006, President Bush approved $38 million divided for all 10 camps.\n\nAs club members Eric Johnson and Ron Noble mentioned during Tamuraâs talk, Yakama Tribal members did return some of the property reclaimed to Japanese Americans in the Yakima Valleyâanother irony as so many Indian Americans were forced onto reservation lands.\n\nTamura asked his dad about returning to farming after the internments, but his dad told him âno, farming is a hard life.â\n\nRod said internees were sent to the camps âif people had just 1/32nd Japanese blood.â\n\nA national aid he will continue his history lessons about the internments, especially to the young.\n\nHis lessons: âBe respectful and appreciate the rights you have because things can change.â\n\nâAnd we have to be care about what other groups are like.â\n\nBulletin editors: Chuck Rehberg and Sandy Fink.

The table will be near the Rotary Fountain in Riverfront Park.\n\nHappy Birthday: Sandy Finkâs happy day is on April 20.\n\nLawyers should help rebuild trust\n\nIn the past 20 years, public trust has waned in many areas from the presidency to law enforcement to the legal profession, Hunter M. Abell told club members at the April 15 luncheon.\n\nAbell said âcynicism and nostalgiaâ are among the reasons for the decline of respect for many sectors of business.\n\nâThere are simple answers, but not easy answers,â he said.\n\nHe said as polarization has mounted âlawyers, whose number one role is the guardian of structures, should become teachers.â\n\nAbell, on a leave as president of the Washington State Bar Association, has had his own remarkable journey.\n\nHe was born on a ranch near Inchelium on the Colville Reservation.\n\nPart of his legal practice, he said, is split between working âon a table in Incheliumâ and in Spokane at the Williams Kastner offices. The firm also has offices in Seattle and Portland.\n\nAbell specializes in civil litigation, residential real estate and Indian law.\n\nHe served as a commander in the Navyâs JAG Corps and was a liaison officer in the Central Criminal Court in Baghdad, Iraq.\n\nAbell graduated in Willam and Mary, earned his law degree at Gonzaga in 2005 and studied at Georgetown Law in 2006. He also is a member of the Ferry County and King County bar associations.\n\nSo, obviously, Abell brings a lot to the table when he talks about the roles of lawyers.\n\nAt the luncheon, he used slides to show how much public confidence has declined in sectors.\n\nPolling showed respect for the Presidency dropped from 52 percent in 1973 to just 26 percent last year. Supreme Court showed 45 percent in 1973; just 27 percent in 2023. Banking went from 60 percent in 1979 to 26 percent last year. Public school trust dropped from 58 percent in 1973 to 26 percent and media fell from 39 percent to 18 percent. Congressâ numbers dropped from 42 percent to just 8 percent.\n\nAbell said the only growth in respect in the sectors in the polling was the military, which grew from 58 percent in 1973 to 60 percent last year. He added though, depending on war time, in some years even the military declined 7 percent.\n\nWhile many reasons have âundermined public trust,â he said, âtrust can be rebuilt.â\n\nHe challenges lawyers to help rally trust in many areas and institutions.\n\nThough some may think there are too many lawyers, Abell said âwe need more lawyers, especially in rural areas.â\n\nHe added that we also need more doctors and nurses and accountants in rural areas, but people in urban areas, especially the young, donât like to move to rural areas. âThere is no big dating pool in rural areas,â he quipped.\n\nAbell said another key to rebuilding trust among institutions is to make an effort to connect better with people in the areas. He said Rotary, with its various classifications is âwell-positioned with its diversity.â Reaching young people is a special challenge, he admits.\n\nAsked about the possibility that some new lawyers now may be admitted to the bar without bar exams, Abell said he hopes that does not become areas where there is a âgold standardâ for those who passed the bar exam, and a âsilver standardâ for those who just clerked with law offices to be admitted.\n\nBulletin editors: Chuck Rehberg and Sandy Fink.\n\nGiving Back Spokane - Rick Clark\n\nNorth Notes\n\nSpokane-North Rotary Club\n\nApril 8, 2024\n\nCalendar:\n\nApril 15: Noon meeting at the Bark.

That was their 26th major baseball stadium they have visited. Adding to her happiness as her son said âthis was a great trip.â\n\nLaura Zahn was $5 of success for the supply drive with KHQ for the Ronald McDonald House March 30. Worried that the Easter weekend would not earn as much, the amount of supplies equaled or surpassed the previous year.\n\nSheila Fritts was $3 happy for the three guests she brought to this meeting.\n\nEric Johnson was happy for his April 7 birthday and for the birthdays of his dad, Leroy, and Leroyâs twin. Leroy, now 93, a retired Real Estate Broker, joined our club in 1973.\n\nSteve Boharski was happy for a pleasant Arizona trip.\n\nAnnouncements:\n\nBoard member Nancy Hanson said that as part of the 50th anniversary of Expo â74 six area Rotary clubs will staff a special table Saturday, May 18, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. near the Rotary Fountain in Riverfront Park âto make aware of Rotary.â Sheila Fritts has signed up for the entire day, but other club members are welcomed to staff the table for one-hour each.\n\nRemember: Construction continues on North Washington near the Bark for our luncheons. Access should be available via North River Drive west of Division.\n\nSpecial solar treat\n\nAs the moon darkened a small slice of the sun during the April 8 solar eclipse, club members were treated to âsolar doughnutsâ by Jerry Logan, sergeant-at-arms for the day.\n\nJerryâs tribute included a base of a Krispy Kreme doughnut topped by one side of an Oreo cookie and whipped cream. Too bad we have to wait another 20 years for the next full eclipse in our area.\n\n(Sorry the photographer was too busy eating to take a picture!)\n\nA gift of giving back\n\nRick Clark didnât wear a backpack to our April 8 luncheon, but thatâs because he probably gave it away to a needy person on the way to the Bark.\n\nWhat he never gives away is his will to help people in need.\n\nClark nearly teared-up as he recalled his challenges and successes. His riveting life story also brought strong emotions to the full crowd.\n\nClark, now 53, was born in the Spokane Valley. Dad left early, leaving poverty and numerous challenges for the family. He said he dropped out of high school and already had a baby. His sisters also had babies by then.\n\nRick said by age 44 âhis third marriage was on the rocks,â had five children and 50 different jobs âall entry-level.â By then he was âsquatting in a trailer in Medical Lake.â\n\nEmotions raw, Clark said he screamed, saying âyouâre not going out like this.â\n\nâI wasnât a bad guy, but I just didnât want things that way,â he said.\n\nâI was 28 years as a drop out and this was my âHail Maryâ shotâ to do something, Clark said.\n\nThatâs where he met Jerrod. Clark had gone to the downtown bus plaza and saw Jerrod, dirty clothing, no shoes. âHe looked like one of my sonâs age,â Rick said.\n\nSo Clark made a connection to someone âwho was doing worse than me.â\n\nJerrod told him he had slept under the Monroe Street Bridge the previous night and muggers took his backpack and most of his meager belongings.\n\nRick offered the question which he now knows connects people most: âAre you hungry?â\n\nClark offered his $10 at the plaza food court. Jerrod wanted a pastry and a Mountain Dew.\n\nRick wrote down Jerrodâs clothing sizes, a backpack, and promised to find him again.\n\nâYou are low, but others are even lower and my job is I want to be a helper,â Rick said.\n\nHe gave out a backpacks and started at Spokane Community College. Rick graduated the same day his son graduated from Spokane Falls Community College.\n\nBuoyed by that success he borrowed $100 and sent a heartfelt letter about his travails to Gonzaga University.\n\nâThis opened the door to ending his chain of poverty,â Clark said. He said at GU classes, he was in his 50s and one student in his 30s and they used to nod at each other since every other student was so much younger.\n\nGU provided $35,000 to start school and a donor paid most of the rest.\n\nWith his communications degree in hand, Clark started out to help âGiving Back Pack.â More than 7,000 backpacks, with toiletries, clothing and other essential items were given to the needy.\n\nWhen the backpack needs were met, Clark changed the program to âGiving Back Spokane,â and the non-profit provides a variety of necessities and food, especially for youngsters in need who may not have food when schools are not in session.\n\nBecause all the money is private community funds, no governmental red tape limits donations, he said.\n\nDuring the Covid pandemic, Clark said, the group helped 110 restaurants keep open.\n\nTalking about the homeless, here and elsewhere, Rick said the key âis to make a connection. When there is no hate, there is dignity,â he said. âGive people a reason to get up in the morning.â\n\nHe said his Facebook responses have numbered 36,000â¦âand 80 percent are people over age 40.â\n\nClark said he did find Jerrod a few years ago, finally recognized as schizophrenic, living in North Idaho.\n\nAnd Rick Clark, whose life has gone very far indeed, now operates his agency on West Sprague, just a block or so from that bus plaza where his life changed forever.\n\nBulletin editors: Chuck Rehberg and Sandy Fink.\n\nMichael Baumgartner -- County Treasurer\n\nNorth Notes\n\nSpokane-North Rotary Club\n\nApril 1, 2024\n\nCalendar:\n\nApril 8: Noon meeting at the Bark.

The assessor adjusts the rates for levies and bonds.â\n\nMike, who was elected treasurer in 2018, was joined at the lunch with Hillary Pham, the county treasurerâs inter-governmental affairs officer.\n\nWhile Mike knows very well about the distinctions about raising taxes, he has much to talk about how those rates have risen, especially for schools, while he was in the State Senate from 2010 to 2018.\n\nHe said the Democratic legislative majority and the governor, also a Democrat, helped push teacher salaries âto the highest in the nation.â He added that with smaller class loads statewide, âthere are also some very expensive new buildings.â\n\nMike and wife, Eleanor, know personally about public schools, since four of their five children are in school.\n\nBaumgartner shared how the growth of Spokane County property taxes raised during his term: $579 million in 2019; $658 million, in 2020; $713 million in 2021; $770 million in 2022; $818 million in 2023 and $856 million in 2024. That is an increase of $277 million from 2019.\n\nHe said about 60 percent of the taxes fund public K-12 education, including salaries and buildings, and 40 percent of tax bills are self-imposed by tax payers for school bonds and levies.\n\nThe treasurerâs management team, including Pham and six others, supervise banking services for 80 local government entities and a $1.9 billion portfolio. Using an array of U.S. Treasury notes, Fannie Mac, Fannie Mae, World Bank and corporate bonds, he said more than $120 million in earnings have accrued since 2019 tax years.\n\nHe said the Treasurer's office also has been able to speed funding for projects like the expensive Bigelow Gulch widening.\n\nBaumgartner said the increasing tax rate does hit hard for some homeowners, especially seniors on fixed-rate incomes. Last year senior and disabled property tax exemptions went to 10,595 participants, 1,000 more than in 2022.\n\nâSome people come to our office with tears in their eyes because they canât pay their taxes,â he said.\n\nTo keep the access, he said, a City of Spokane Valley office and several other collection points are opened during spring and fall tax deadline times.\n\nAsked how his office has worked with five commissioners rather than three, Baumgartner said he probably would have liked a county executive system to help manage the load.\n\nHe also was asked about his candidacy for the 5th District Congressional seat where long-term Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers said she will not seek re-election.\n\nBaumgartner, 48, is a Pullman native. His mom was an elementary teacher and his dad a professor at WSU. Mike has a major in economics and minors in French and math at WSU and a masterâs degree in public administration from Harvard.\n\nHe met Eleanor while working in Afghanistan and Mike worked there and in the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad in strategic planning.\n\nHe said he would like to get involved in international issues and said he has talked with Cathy about âhow much could get done in four years,â telling him that much could be done.\n\nBut for now Mike reminds property owners that first-half county taxes are due April 30.\n\nBulletin editors: Chuck Rehberg and Sandy Fink.\n\nVelocity and Real-estate Home Sales Status - Robben, Hopkins, and Johnson\n\nNorth Notes\n\nSpokane-North Rotary Club\n\nMarch 4, 2024\n\nCalendar:\n\nMarch 18: Noon meeting at Fairmount Memorial Association, 822N.

It felt a bit like the atmosphere on one of those timed cooking shows, as we laughed and worked around each other to get everything ready in a two hour window.\n\nThe group divided the myriad of tasks involved with prepping, cooking and cleaning up and were ready to serve our menu right on time at 6pm. Our menu consisted of Lenoreâs Mexican chicken entrÃ©e, seasoned salmon fillets, cilantro & lime rice, fresh fruit salad, and hot fudge sundaes with Lauraâs homemade hot fudge sauce right. With hardly any leftovers, we took it as a thumbâs-up sign!\n\nHelping to support these families was a fun and worthwhile way to spend a few hours on a Friday eveningâ¦we look forward to doing this project again.\n\nA special Paul Harris moment\n\nAt the March 11 club luncheon, David Hayward was given a Paul Harris Fellowship, celebrating $1,000 to the\n\nRotary International fund. It was the 4th Paul Harris mention for long-time member Dave and reading the tribute was\n\nDaveâs grandson, Hunter Hopkins.\n\nGet your kicks with the Velocity\n\nPerhaps the luck of the Irish will be with Spokaneâs new pro soccer team in the United Soccer League One.\n\nOn Saturday, March 16, the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick start their annual Irish Parade at noon.\n\nAt 2 p.m., the Spokane Velocity FC kick off its home schedule at One Spokane Stadium against the Richmond Kickers.\n\nLogan Robben, Velocity assistant manager, said just 600 tickets remained for the 5,000 seats at the inaugural home game. He told the club that 200 soccer fans crowded a local bar to watch the first road trip, where the Velocity lost 3-1 to the Greenville Triumph in South Carolina.\n\nThe menâs team home schedule has 15 games with the last regular home game on Oct. 26. The pro womenâs team, the Zephyr, start in the summer. Robben said soccer games will play all months except November and December.\n\nIndividual ticket prices range from $18 to $39, he said. Team colors are âRiver Rapid White and Impact Blue. The club has a merchandize store in the Davenport Grand Hotel.\n\nThe pro teams here, Robben said, âare at the level at Double-A baseball and are modeling after British Leagues in soccer,â where winning teams may move up and losers may drop a bit. Robben said personally, heâs a Chelsea fan.\n\nJoining Robben at the clubâs meeting was Hunter Hopkins, a WSU student majoring in sports management. Hopkins, Dave Haywardâs grandson, is an intern with the soccer teams. Hunter said he played (the other) football in high school, not soccer.\n\nHome sale outlook: Challenges continue\n\nAn active home sales spring is expected in Spokane, and while prices continue to rise, homes are even pricier elsewhere.\n\nâThe lack of inventory continues to be our number one issue,â said Eric Johnson, who has tracked Spokane area home sales for decades. In 2021 he was president of the Spokane Association of Realtors.\n\nEric said in 2024 the Realtors forecast a 6 percent increase in units and a 3 percent price increase. Another Realtor index expects a 3.6 percent gain in units, but a 10.2 percent price drop, while the National Association of Realtors forecast a 13.5 percent increase, with no overall increase in prices.\n\nHe said in February the median home sales price was $400,000, up 6.7 percent and closed sales totaled 341, a 13 percent increase.\n\nâThere are about 1,000 homes on the market and the âchurnâ has been pretty good,â Eric said.\n\nHe said a number of home buyers are moving to Spokane. âThey are coming from L.A., Portland, Seattle, and even Coeur dâAlene, where costs are pricing out of that market. âThe Spokane Valley is the benefit of that,â Eric said.\n\nInventory is low, he said, and, with prices rising, some new âruthless buildersâ are cutting quality, like not installing soffits, and locating on just 5-foot-wide setbacks.\n\nHe said, with âa lot of variables,â some younger people are âmore of a rental mind,â rather than buying homes.\n\nBut overall, Johnson said, âThis is not a bad market for home sales,â even when interest rates âhas been the most sensitive weâve ever had since I have been doing this.â\n\nBulletin editors: Chuck Rehberg, Lenore Romney, and Sandy Fink.\n\nSPS Bond & Levy - Shawn Jordan and Sandra Jarrard\n\nNorth Notes\n\nSpokane-North Rotary Club\n\nFebruary 5, 2024\n\nCalendar:\n\nFeb. 12: Noon lunch at the Bark.

The deadline is March 31.\n\nLaura Zahn, coordinating the clubâs sharing project at the Ronald McDonald House, has sign-up sheets for five helpers needed Friday, March 8, 4:30-7:30 p.m., to feed about 40 people staying there while family members are treated at local hospitals.\n\nClub anniversaries:\n\nIn February, Art Rudd, who joined in 1969, reaches 55 years with the club. Also noted were Dave Hayward, 38 years, Lenore Romney, 19 years, and Eric Johnson, 15 years.\n\nHappy Buck$:\n\nJerry Logan, in a âGrammyâ mood, was happy about Miley Cyrusâ âFlowersâ song winner.\n\nNancy Hanson was happy for WSUâs basketball successes.\n\nLenore Romney offered a âsad buckâ for the GU menâs loss to St. Maryâs.\n\nRon Noble then added a dollar for the Zag ladies wins.\n\nNext Tuesday voters decide funding\n\nMillions of dollars are at stake Feb. 13 as residents of 15 Spokane area school districts vote on bonds and levies.\n\nAt the Feb. 5 luncheon members learned details about the funding proposals in Spokaneâs District 81 from Shawn Jordan, chief operations officer and Sandra Jarrard, chief of communications and governmental affairs.\n\nDistrict 81 Superintendent Adam Swinyard, scheduled to speak, had a conflict.\n\nJordan was introduced by Sandy Fink, who was principal at North Central High School when Jordan was a teacher there.\n\nFor many years, the educators have recalled the mantra that âbonds are for buildings and levies are for learning.â Levy measures require 50 percent passage, while bond measures require 60 percent âsuper majoritiesâ and 40 percent of voters from the previous general election for validation.\n\nJordan said District 81 now has 29,000 students, an increase of 400 this year. He said the district has 5,037 employees. He added that students from 79 different languages are spoken in the district.\n\nIn each of three years, the District 81 replacement levy rate is assessed at $2.50 per $1,000 value. The current 3-year levies were assessed at $2.41 in 2022, $2.10 in 2023 and $2.24 this year.\n\nThus the amounts for the new levy rates would total $95 million in 2025, $99 million in 2026 and $103 million in 2027.\n\nThe levies supplement state funding, and the local money, Jordan said, funds athletics, arts, music and drama, nurses, counselors, advanced placement courses, special education, behavioral specialists, technology support, smaller class sizes, highly capable programs, librarians, custodians and intervention programs.\n\nJordan said average class load in most elementary schools is 18 students. Club member Jerry Logan, a retired educator, said âthatâs an optimum levelâ for success. School classes for grades 4 and 5 average 22 students and middle and high school classes average 25 students, he said.\n\nThe district has 57 buildings, including 34 elementary schools, 9 middle schools, 5 high schools and 7 schools dedicated to alternative learning.\n\nJordan said 2024 major bond projects include replacements of Adams and Madison elementaries, modernizing parts of North Central High and Garry Middle School, Chase Middle School improvements, upgrades to Public Montessori and Libby Center, Community School improvements and a full design of Balboa and Indian Trail elementaries. He said there is some discussion about locating a school in the Eagle Ridge area in the future.\n\nThe bond assessment per $1,000 value estimates are $1.34 in 2025, $1.36 in 2026 and $1.30 in 2039. The previous three year assessments were $2.11 in 2022, $1.70 in 2 023 and $1.58 this year.\n\nJarrard and Jordan said âWe have been going out to all groups to get the correct information out, but people are feeling the tax.â\n\nNext Tuesday, area voters will decide the important pass-fail tests for school funding.\n\nBulletin editors: Chuck Rehberg and Sandy Fink.\n\nVanessa Behan -- Sue and Gordon Jackson\n\nNorth Notes\n\nSpokane-North Rotary Club\n\nJanuary 29, 2024\n\nCalendar:\n\nFeb. 5: Noon lunch at the Bark.

They came to Spokane from South Africa in 1983. Gordon led the journalism program and Sue worked in administrative jobs at Whitworth.\n\nFor the past 17 years, they have volunteered at Vanessa Behan. They shared their stories at the clubâs Jan. 29 luncheon.\n\nVanessa Kay Behan was a 2-year-old Spokane girl who died from a long list of injuries of child abuse. In 1987, the center was opened in a private home to provide safe care for neglected children. The need grew and the operation was moved to a South Hill location and now has been expanded to a spacious building and playground at 2230 E. Sprague.\n\nThe center operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and all services are free and confidential.\n\nChildren are cared for ages birth through 6 and on a case-by-case basis ages 7 to 12, the Jacksons said. Many kids are referred to the center, but some drop-ins can be accommodated, they said.\n\nThe center serves children of families âin cases of substance abuse, domestic violence, homelessness or just exhausted and worn out from the demands of parenting.â\n\nIn 1987, 427 children were cared for at the center. In 2023, 6,860 kids were protected, they said. Over that lifespan, they said, some 132,500 children were served. The center operates with a nearly $4 million operating budget. About half of the money is from individual and business contributions, augmented by events, programs and appeals and a few grants.\n\nGordon and Sue said they work 4-hour shifts twice a week, playing with infants and kids.\n\nâIt is a very secure building and every door is locked,â Sue said.\n\nâThere is an enormous, kid-friendly great room, with a climbing wall, slides and hidey-holes. Kids can run and they can build things,â she said, adding, there also are quiet transition places. An outdoor playground is designed for kid-friendly surfaces and equipment.\n\nGordon said the youngsters âare incredibly honest,â asking in various ways, âcan I trust you?â or âdo you like me?â\n\nSue said that âthere are some special need kids who are classified âone-onâ children who get single house parents.â\n\nShe added there is âa dramatic roomâ where kids ages 2-5 can play dress up and use instruments.\n\nâWe both enjoy playing with the toys,â she said, displaying for the club a tall plastic pole with rings that curves around the stack.\n\nGordon said the Behan Center âhas very few male volunteers. We need more male role models.â\n\nPreventing child abuse and dealing with neglect, unfortunately is a big challenge, but the Vanessa Behan staff and volunteers have made a huge difference.\n\nBulletin editors: Chuck Rehberg and Sandy Fink.\n\nMarijke Fakasiieiki - Fig Tree\n\nNorth Notes\n\nSpokane-North Rotary Club\n\nJanuary 22, 2024\n\nCalendar:\n\nJan. 29: Noon lunch at the Bark.

That was not allowed in Washington because the eligible age there is 14, but in Post Falls, John said, there was no problem to shoot handguns and rifles.\n\nFaith grows in a Fig Tree\n\nBibles have several references about fig trees.\n\nMark (11:12-20) recalls âhow Jesus cursed the fig tree because he was hungry and found only leaves (when the fruit was out of season).â\n\nMicah (4:4) talks about people âunder their own fig trees and no one shall make them afraidâ because their independence were freed from the military.â\n\nIn the Spokane region, The Fig Tree is âa monthly newspaper and website covering faith in action.â\n\nAt the Jan. 22 club luncheon, Marijke Fakasiieiki, Fig Treeâs development and editorial associate, described the organizationâs outreach.\n\nShe said the newspaper publishes 10 times each month and circulates a 200-page resource directory of churches and centers for human services, medical resources, senior and retirement centers, justice resources and agencies on the environment, arts and culture and civic services.\n\nThe resource service guide is funded by two dozens of companies, businesses and organizations plus individual donations.\n\nThe Fig Tree, located at 13th and Perry, was started in 1984 and circulates throughout Eastern Washington and North Idaho.\n\nMarijke said the interfaith effort was founded by Methodist ministers in the 1930s in Great Britainâs World Council.\n\nShe said the concept is âto have the faith communities get together and share their voices for peace and justice.â\n\nThe Fig Tree counters the negativity in media and to emphasize stories about positive events, Marijke said.\n\nFor example, the current tabloid features Catherine Ferguson, of the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary (SNJM), who has âtraveled the world to do international research for an internship and in leadership roles.â Her story is one of the Fig Treeâs 40th anniversary publications.\n\nAlso in the current edition, Ferguson wrote about the work of Kaye Peterson, guest services manager at the Silver Lake Camp and Retreat Center.\n\nWhen the devastating fire in the Medical Lake area scorched 10,000 acres of fires and 240 structures in August, much of the camp structures, two miles south of the city, survived.\n\nDuring the trauma, Peterson said, she âconstantly felt Jesusâ presence,â adding, âregardless of all the work that still needs to be done, her faith in God inspires everything she does and asks how can we help the greater community and show Godâs love.â\n\nMarijke said a free Fig Tree 40th anniversary Benefit Event is scheduled at noon on March 8 at GUâs Cataldo Hall, to âfeature recent stories that empower people.â\n\nBulletin editors: Chuck Rehberg and Sandy Fink Photo: Lenore Romney\n\nSalvation Army - Marcie Undlin\n\nNorth Notes\n\nSpokane-North Rotary Club\n\nJanuary 8, 2024\n\nCalendar:\n\nJan. 15: No meeting.

Melinda Keberle said her dad won an award for a photo at Expo.\n\nJohn Mailliard reminded that âevery member of the club is on the membership committee.â\n\nBill Simer said little red heart decals have been added to membersâ badges for contributing to the clubâs charitable giving campaign.\n\nHappy Buck$:\n\nJohn Mailliard visited Salem, Ore., to celebrate his sister and her husband for their 50th anniversary and brought back a flag from the Salem Rotary club.\n\nRon Noble was happy to reach his 75th birthday.\n\nJerry Logan is happily awaiting an Arizona trip to buy a sports car.\n\nA special Holler for $1:\n\nEric Johnson and wife, Stephanie, had stopped at the north side Fred Meyer store for gasoline last week, when they noticed that a young man ahead of them in line had his driverâs door ajar. Then they heard a loud clunk when the man fell to the pavement.\n\nThe 17-year-old, who was driving alone, had fractured his skull in the fall. Stephanie, a nurse, helped the young man, while Eric called 911 to summon EMTs and found the manâs motherâs number to call him.\n\nEric said the young man is hospitalized and asked members âfor thoughts and prayers.â\n\nOne prayer was already answered by the quick assistance of Eric and Stephanie.\n\nThis Army has prayer and a lot of programs\n\nFor the Salvation Army, itâs about âsoup, soap and salvation.â\n\nAnd this Armyâs marching order is âDoing the Most Good.â\n\nAt the Jan. 8 club luncheon Marcie Undlin, the Salvation Armyâs eastern Washington donor relations director, described the organizationâs efforts. Her territory includes six facilities, with the largest at 222 E. Indiana.\n\nâWe are much more than holiday bell ringing,â Undlin said. But there is a lot of bell-ringing. She said there are 62 kettle stations in the Spokane area whose volunteers, supplemented by some paid workers, ring bells in two-hour shifts to raise about $3 million a year.\n\nThe Salvation Army Spokane offers help and refuge for all ages, Undlin said.\n\nâSallyâs Houseâ works with children ages 2-12 who have been abused, abandoned or neglected. Some 8,000 children have been served since its opening in 2002.\n\nâEvangelineâs Houseâ provides short-term placement for ages 12-20 needing support and counseling.\n\nâStepping Stonesâ is a family transitional housing program which serves three or more individuals seeking housing and work.\n\nA âNurturing Centerâ provides court-ordered time and visitation services to children aged birth to 18 and their families.\n\nCamp Gifford at Deer Lake brings 500 or so aged 7 to 17 to a summer experience.\n\nA family resource center helps those who âwork paycheck-to-paycheckâ when emergencies arise.\n\nThe âWay Out Bridge Housing Centerâ works with homeless adults trying to transition from shelters to permanent housing.\n\nAnd the âWay in Sheltersâ help facilities like the âlow-barrierâ Trent Resource and Assistance Centerâ to get out of the cold. TRAC has 350 beds and a Cannon center adds 80 beds.\n\nThe Salvation Army also has a variety of community programs for scouting, after school, movies in the park, Thanksgiving Day Meals and âTrunk or Treatâ families.\n\nThe Spokane Salvation Army is headed by Majors Ken and Jennie Perine.\n\nThe original Salvation Army was founded in 1865 in London by a Methodist minister. Undlin said âwe have churches and all officers are ordained ministers, part of the universal Christian Church.â\n\nShe added: âWe operate like a military base and ranks rise from privates to colonels.â\n\nUndlin said the âsoupâ is nourishment, the âsoapâ help programs like addictions and the âsalvationâ Biblical references to help bring the words of Jesus.\n\nBulletin editors: Chuck Rehberg and Sandy Fink.\n\nMeasure No 1 -- Sheriff Nowels\n\nNorth Notes\n\nSpokane-North Rotary Club\n\nOct.30, 2023\n\nCalendar:\n\nNov. 6: Noon lunch at the Bark.

Each member is asked to take two tags for gifts and each gift is limited to $60.\n\nSheila Fritts shared a nice thank-you note from the Kids Closet program for two boxes of items donated by Carters which Lenore had picked up.\n\nSave the dates:\n\nThe clubâs holiday gathering will be the evening of Friday, Dec.1 at Bill Simerâs house, with details to follow.\n\nIn lieu of the Monday, Dec 4 club luncheon, members are invited to help at 2nd Harvest during 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. that day. Steve Boharski coordinated the dirty hands project.\n\nHappy Buck$:\n\nBill Simer and Jerry Logan visited the Lumen School and said they were very happy to have received infant clothing donations, also from Carters\n\n.\n\nRon Noble was pre-Halloween happy that a grandchild was born just soon of the eerie date of Oct. 31.\n\nThanks from Holmes Students:\n\nSandy shared a poster made by the 5th graders in science class thanking Rotary for the Mobius science kits.\n\nSheriff Nowels: âWe do have a planâ\n\nAt the Oct. 30 club luncheon, Spokane County Sheriff John Nowels offered dozens of reasons to support Measure No. 1 â building a new jail and several other item and programs.\n\nWhile some critics have said the law and justice program measure lacks details, Nowels offered a blizzard of data points about how current correction facilities are overcrowded and outdated and programs for mental health and substance use disorders are severely lacking.\n\nIf ballot Measure 1 is approved by voters, a 0.2% sales tax over 30 years would generate an estimated $1.7 billion to build two new jails and provide local governments in the county to added revenue, which, by state law, must be spent on criminal justice, public safety and behavioral health programs.\n\nThe funding would split, with 60 percent â about $540 million, including interest payments, for the county, and 40 percent for various municipalities, Nowels said.\n\nWhile some critics said the plan lacks details, Nowels said flatly, âWe do have a plan.â\n\nâWe have lacked money for criminal justice for a long time,â the sheriff said.\n\nWith Measure 1, the current county jail would open and two new buildings near the old jail would be built. One would be a five-story jail for medium and minimum offenders. The second new building would house a variety of behavior programs, including detox programs, a drug court and community contact programs, Nowels said.\n\nThe existing jail would house maximum-level offenders.\n\nThe Geiger Corrections Center, a minimum-level facility built in the Korean War-era, would be demolished, the sheriff said. Geiger, he said, can only house 100 to 150 minimum-level inmates and only males because it lacks staffing and facilities. âThey could just climb the fence,â he said, adding the county intends to demolish Geiger in five years regardless of the ballot result. Replacing that could cost $40 million, he added.\n\nNowels said that the current jail is severely overcrowded. In one recent day, the jail, designed to house 465 inmates, had 675 inmates.\n\nâSome days we have deputies in patrol cars holding inmates, waiting for a room in the jail to open,â he said. âItâs not anecdotal,â Nowels said, âWe have to make decisions every day about who to hold in jail or who to release.â\n\nBuilding a facility for behavioral programs comes close to home for the sheriff.\n\nHe said his daughter has struggled with addiction. âWe must have a system that helps people. For many, a better health program is better than incarceration, but we just lack the facilities to do the programs,â Nowels said.\n\nWith the spread of fentanyl and cocaine and other substances, he said, âWe have an epidemic of drug use.â He said housing someone with a drug problem in jail for 30 to 90 days âcould be a better placeâ than on the streets. Space for that is lacking now.\n\nTalking about homelessness, the sheriff said âOnly three people died because of freezing temperatures in Spokane last year, but 63 people died of drug overdoses.â\n\nIf Measure 1 passes, he said, construction would take five years to complete and add 500 beds to the total.\n\nThe sheriff said the new facilities can be built without adding much staff, because current state law limits how many inmates can be housed on one floor, while the new designs can use fewer staff per floor.\n\nNowels also detailed how local and state law enforcement ranks here are among the lowest totals in the nation. To achieve the average national number of officers, he said Spokane County would need to add 136 deputies.\n\nâWe need more cops,â he said.\n\nBulletin editors: Chuck Rehberg and Sandy Fink\n\nBetsy Wilkerson-- Council President Candidate\n\nNorth Notes\n\nSpokane North Rotary Club\n\nOct. 23, 2023\n\nCalendar:\n\nOct. 30: Noon lunch at the Bark.

At Arms: Colin Prestesater\n\nBetsy: âNegativity has never solved one thingâ\n\nTalking about homelessness, crime and safety, campaigning and other topics, Spokane Council President candidate Betsy Wilkerson said, âThere is a lot of negativity â the worst since my time in Spokane.â\n\nAsked about liberal and conservative views in the city mayoral and council administration, Wilkerson said âboth sides are a little guilty.â\n\nâWe must take the personalities out to get the work done,â she said, adding, ânegativity has never solved one thing.â\n\nWilkerson spoke at the clubâs Oct. 23 meeting. Her opponent, Kim Plese, did not attend.\n\nOn Oct. 30, the last of the clubâs pre-election programs, Spokane County Sheriff John Nowels will discuss the proposal to fund a new jail.\n\nAsked about the city council presidency, Wilkerson said âI was going to retire, but no one else will do it. Thatâs what leadership does.â Among other duties, the council president, she said, sets the council agenda and âis second in lineâ to the mayor.\n\nWilkerson was appointed as a District 2 Councilwoman in 2020 and re-elected in 2021. She was asked to run for president by former Council President Breean Beggs after he was named a Superior Court judge by Gov. Jay Inslee earlier this year.\n\nBetsy has owned and operated Mooreâs Assisted Living, a mental health facility, since 1993. On the City Council she is current president of the Spokane Regional Transportation Council and current president of the Associated Washington Cities.\n\nShe fielded a variety of topics during the clubâs luncheon.\n\nOne thing she mentioned was âcracked sidewalks,â saying throughout town sidewalk problems make it difficult to travel, especially for those with disabilities. She said traffic calming money from red light fines could help.\n\nAbout homelessness, Wilkerson said she was impressed with programs in Vancouver, Wash., to house âtiny homes and RVs.â That is a better solution than living in cars, she said, adding, \"when you are homeless, you often live in a car.â\n\nShe commended Lt. Gov. Denny Heck for convening representatives statewide to study issues of homelessness âand how to stay at the table.â\n\nâSince Covid, when there were few gatherings,â she said. âWe have to build back civic muscle.â\n\nWilkerson is no fan of concentrated homeless venues, such as Camp Hope and the East Trent Shelter. She said, â70 people you can absorb; but 300, no.â\n\nShe said space is available on city, county and state parcels of lands in the area and even private parking lots, including near churches. She suggests finding (the homeless) areas âwhere they grew up, such as Hillyard.â\n\nâLetâs not make them come downtown,â she said. The area near Second and Division is a problem area because there is no place to gather. Apartments are secured. There is no park or benches and most businesses lock lavatories by 8 p.m.\n\nShe said some homeless people are moving to Deer Park, but facilities and programs are scarce there.\n\nWilkerson agreed that improvements are needed in the Monroe Street Bridge area, where some have jumped or fallen into the river. âMaybe we need a net or cameras,â she said.\n\nAsked if more stop signs can be installed to control speeding traffic, she said âstop signs are a day in the past. They just are not effective. More round-abouts is where weâre going.â\n\nWilkerson said improving government means working together âin collaboration and with the process,â even, she said, if sometimes (at the council) âare Jerry Springer Monday nights.\"\n\nâGovernment can be changed,â she said, âbut itâs a heavy load.â Nancy and Betsy acknowledging Mobius Certificate\n\nBulletin editors: Chuck Rehberg and Sandy Fink\n\nLisa Brown - Mayoral Candidate\n\nNorth Notes\n\nSpokane North Rotary Club\n\nOct. 16, 2023\n\nCalendar:\n\nOct. 23: Noon lunch at the Bark.

We need to pull people together.â\n\nShe said one important initiative, working with the school districts, is to strengthen programs for the youngest students. Brown said 30 percent of youngsters are not yet ready for kindergarten, with the rate 35 percent for girls and just 25 percent for boys.\n\nThe 50th anniversary of Expo â74 next year would be a good target to boost quality for an improved quality early learning program.\n\nAsked about policy and program splits among the mayor and council members, Brown said âin the State Legislature, I worked both sides of the aisle.â One example, she said was creating a ârainy day fund,â where some of her fellow Democrats opposed, but was established with bipartisan support.\n\nâPotholes are not partisan,â Brown said.\n\nAs Chancellor of WSU Spokane, she also noted that taking just four years to create a medical school from inception to launch was amazing.\n\nAsked about dealing with homelessness in Spokane, Brown said there are about 2,000 people on the streets now and the total is growing.\n\nOf the current number, she said âwe can handle thatâ with a variety of sources, but more effective outreach is needed. âWhat do we do upstream?â she asked.\n\nâWe canât turn around the issue in four years, but we can make a big dent in the problem,â Brown said, adding, âItâs not just a law response.â\n\nâItâs tricky, but we have to get to people before they are evicted,â she said.\n\nBrown mentioned using âa network of neighborhoods,â plus more programs for food banks, food stamps, and reaching young people earlier, like Crosswalk.\n\nAsked about the new jail, she said the details âare not yet ready and itâs too expensive.â Brown questioned about funds to staff three facilities â the current jail, a new jail and a behavior health facility. (The current plan would eliminate the Geiger Corrections Center.)\n\nâThe city and county have not had effective dialog on the jail issue,â Brown said.\n\nBulletin editors: Chuck Rehberg and Sandy Fink\n\nMayor Nadine Woodward -- Upcoming Election\n\nNorth Notes\n\nSpokane North Rotary Club\n\nOct. 2, 2023\n\nCalendar:\n\nOct. 9: No meeting (federal holiday).\n\nOct. 16: Noon lunch at the Bark.
