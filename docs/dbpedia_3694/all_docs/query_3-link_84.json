        "text": "To Adela and Mariano S. Martínez, also a Mexican immigrant from Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico, I César Augusto Martínez was born on June 4, 1944. Sadly, I never got to know my father; he died of renal failure in the spring of 1945 before I was even a year old. It is unfortunate that I never got to know that side of the family; interestingly, a family name I inherited from his side is, depending on which identification document is true, Santana or Santa Ana, an appellation that goes over big here in San Antonio. I was raised in my grandmother’s Laredo household until I left for college in 1964 and became the first in my family to earn a college degree.\n\nI graduated from Texas A&I University in Kingsville, Texas in 1968 with a B.S. Degree in All-Level Art Education. I never had plans to teach and never have; if anything, where art was concerned, the idea of being a professional artist was a mere thought and a college degree provided no road map for that….and actually, all along, my actual ambition was to be a professional Matador….“I think I can do that”. On and off, I had actually spent time, since high school, training with professional toreros in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico but that ambition would never be fulfilled. The toros thing would surface many years later. Inevitably, I may deal with that aspect of my life on this site….plenty of material available, but not now.\n\nCollege life for me was basically dodging the draft to stay out of the Army, and especially out of the Viet Nam War. If this sounds political, it wasn’t, I wasn’t politicized yet; I simply didn’t want that intrusion in my life. I was trying to run the clock out on that but eventually, I did get drafted into the Army. In 1969, after basic training at Fort Bliss in El Paso and then advanced training as a radio operator at Fort Ord, California, rumors started leaking out from the front office about our next deployment and the bad news was that everybody was going to Viet Nam except for two guys….one was going to Germany and the other, which turned out to be me, Korea. I extended my Korean tour of duty to qualify for an early out and, after 18 months in the army, I went home.\n\nThe Army, I realized, runs like clockwork and when we all landed in Seattle/Tacoma, Washington, having flown in from our over-seas mission station to be processed and discharged from the Army, I ran into many of my fellow soldiers from basic training that were also going home, safe and sound after being stationed in Viet Nam. I was very moved to see them alive, especially the one who had sat next to me, silently weeping as our plane left San Antonio for Fort Bliss during that first leg of our military experience.\n\nIn the spring of 1971, after my Army stint, I joined friends from college in San Antonio, Texas, a hot-bed of Chicano activism; they were now involved in the Chicano political movement of that time. Rather than be too linear, that and other biographical aspects of my life will be touched upon anecdotally in other parts of this website, as it is all interwoven into the fabric of my work as a whole….and what isn’t biographical, anyway? My expectation is that this web site will be dynamic and in constant flux to shed light on the genesis of my very varied body work. I hope there is enough time to tell that story.\n\n,,,,César A.
