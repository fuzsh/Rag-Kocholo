        "text": "Charlotte Y. Martin Centre is an athletics center on the campus of Gonzaga University housing a 4,000 seat multi-purpose arena in Spokane, Washington. It opened on December 3, 1965 as the John F. Kennedy Memorial Pavilion, with a capacity of approximately 2,000 patrons.[1] The arena was renamed as part of Gonzaga's centennial celebrations on March 17, 1987, for which major renovations were done to the venue that doubled its size.[1][2]\n\nIt is the home of the Gonzaga University Bulldogs women's volleyball team, and was home to the school's men's and women's basketball teams from its opening, with a partial hiatus in the 1979-80 season when the men's team returned to its former home of the Spokane Coliseum for West Coast Conference home games only,[2][3] until the McCarthey Athletic Center opened in 2004. The venue was affectionately known as 'The Kennel', a reference to the nature of the crowds who turned up to basketball games.[1]\n\nEnglish rock group Led Zeppelin played their fifth-ever American concert at the Kennedy Pavilion on December 30, 1968; the first known bootleg recording of the band originated from this performance.[1][4]\n\nNotes and references"
