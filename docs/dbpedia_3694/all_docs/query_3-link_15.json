        "text": "Contact Not Available\n\nWednesday, October 30, 2013 at 6:10 p.m.\n\nSpokane, Wash. – A public memorial service for former House Speaker Thomas S. Foley will be held at St. Aloysius Church (330 E. Boone Ave.), adjacent to the campus of Gonzaga University, at 11 a.m., Friday, Nov. 1. Gonzaga University and St. Aloysius are hosting services for the Spokane native and alumnus of Gonzaga Prep and the University at the request of Mrs. Heather Foley.\n\nCongressman Foley served 15 terms, from 1965 to 1995, as Democratic representative from Eastern Washington’s 5th Congressional District. He served as party whip (1981-87), majority leader (1987-89), and the last five years as the 57th speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. A former U.S. Ambassador to Japan (1997-2001), Foley died on Oct. 18 in Washington, D.C.\n\nAs an overflow crowd is expected for the service, Gonzaga will also broadcast the memorial live on a large screen at the University’s Charlotte Y. Martin Centre, located on the southeast part of Gonzaga’s campus. The Martin Centre is adjacent to the McCarthey Athletic Center and is accessible from Cincinnati Street.

McCulloh, president of Gonzaga University. “Everyone is welcome.” Special guests from Washington, D.C. and Olympia are expected to attend.\n\nParking is free on a space-available basis at the following locations:\n\nThe elderly or those with limited ability to walk and who need to park as close as possible to St. Aloysius Church may find parking at the College Hall lot, located at the main campus entrance at Addison Street and Sharp Avenue. Limited parking also may be available close to St. Aloysius Church in the lots surrounding the Knights of Columbus Hall (302 E. Boone Ave.; access via Astor Street).\n\nFor those attending at Martin Centre, utilize the large lot located directly south of the venue, as well as the lot south of Spokane Falls Boulevard, adjacent to McKinstry.\n\nBARC (Boone Avenue Retail Center), at the corner of Boone Avenue and Hamilton Street, offers 650 parking spaces on four levels. This facility is within walking distance (a few city blocks) to St. Aloysius Church and the Martin Centre (access from Boone Ave.).\n\nVisit Gonzaga’s Foley Memorial event website [www.gonzaga.edu/foleymemorial] for event updates and to view a live webcast of the memorial Nov. 1. TVW will offer a live webcast of the event from its website [www.TVW.org]; check the TVW website for information on whether the event also will be broadcast via its television network.\n\nFor more information, the public should contact Angela Ruff in the Gonzaga president’s office at 509.313.3572 or via email."
