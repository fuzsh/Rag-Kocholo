The original film includes defects that affect the legibility of some frames; the original schedules no longer exist.\n\nThis catalog supplements the Federal Population Censuses, 1790-1890, the 1900 Federal Population Census, and the 1910 Federal Population Census catalogs, which contain details for ordering copies of the population schedules for 1790-1910 and of the 1880-1910 Soundexes.\n\nPrinted versions of these catalogs can also be ordered. For information about fees and the ordering of these catalogs, please contact Publications Distribution (NECD), National Archives, Room G9, Seventh and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20408; telephone 202-501-7190 or toll-free 1-866-272-6272.\n\n1920 Census Schedules (T625)\n\nOn January 2, 1920, at 9:00 a.m., the Bureau of the Census began taking the 14th decennial census of the United States. The Department of Agriculture had requested that the date be changed from the traditional spring/early summer dates to January. The department argued that harvests would be completed and information about the harvests fresh in farmers' minds, and more people would be at home in January than in April.\n\nThe 1920 census schedules are arranged by state or territory, and thereunder by county, and finally by enumeration district. The states are arranged alphabetically; however, Alaska, Guam and American Samoa, Hawaii, military and naval schedules, the Panama Canal, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands (taken in 1917) are listed last. There was no separate Indian schedule for 1920.\n\nThe format and information in the 1920 census schedules closely resemble that of the 1910 census. The 1920 census, however, did not ask about unemployment on the day of the census, nor did it ask about service in the Union or Confederate army or navy. Questions about the number of children born and how long a couple had been married were also omitted. The bureau modified the enumeration of inmates of institutions and dependent, defective, and delinquent classes. The 1920 census included four new questions: one asking the year of naturalization and three about mother tongue.\n\nBecause of the changes in some boundaries following World War I, enumerators were instructed to report the province (state or region) or city of persons declaring they or their parents had been born in Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia, or Turkey. If a person had been born in any other foreign country, only the name of the country was to be entered.\n\nThe instructions to the enumerators did not require that individuals spell out their names. Enumerators wrote down the information given to them; they were not authorized to request proof of age, date of arrival, or other information. People were known to change their ages between censuses, and some people claimed not to know their age. The race determination was based on the enumerator's impressions.\n\nIndividuals were enumerated as residents of the place in which they regularly slept, not where they worked or might be visiting. People with no regular residence, including \"floaters\" and members of transient railroad or construction camps, were enumerated as residents of the place where they were when the enumeration was taken. Enumerators were also to ask if any family members were temporarily absent; if so, these were to be listed either with the household or on the last schedule for the census subdivision. Thus, the user should always check that page. The answers that appear on the microfilmed schedules depend upon what the enumerator recorded and what the people interviewed told the enumerator.\n\nThe microfilm may also show code numbers or letters in some of the columns. Clerks added these codes in red ink (which cannot be distinguished on the microfilm) after the census, to be punched into the cards used to tabulate the census results. The codes usually represent household composition, occupation and class of worker, or simply marks made in the coding, punching, or tabulating operations themselves and should be ignored.\n\nSoundex\n\nThe Bureau of the Census created and filmed Soundex index cards for the entire 1920 census. The Soundex is a coded surname (last name) index based on the way a surname sounds rather than how it is spelled. Surnames that sound the same but are spelled differently, like SMITH and SMYTH, have the same code and are filed together. The Soundex coding system was developed to find a surname even though it may have been recorded under various spellings. The National Archives has assigned a separate microfilm publication for each state and territory.\n\nThe Bureau of the Census used two separate Soundex cards, the \"family card\" and the \"individual card.\" Both types of cards are arranged numerically by the Soundex code and then alphabetically by the first name of the head of the household on the family cards and the first name of the individual on the individual cards.\n\nThe individual card gives the names of people other than those in the immediate household (husband, wife, son, daughter) that are enumerated with a family. These include grandparents, cousins, boarders, and servants. The card also shows the name of the head of the household or the institution name where the person is living.\n\nThe information on the Soundex card includes the surname, first name, state and county of residence, city (if appropriate), age, place of birth, and whether a U.S. citizen. Each card also lists the volume, enumeration district, sheet number, and line number where the person can be found on the population schedule.\n\nThe Soundex Coding System\n\nEvery Soundex code consists of a letter and three numbers, such as S-650. The letter is always the first letter of the surname, whether it is a vowel or a consonant. Disregard the remaining vowels and W, Y, and H and assign numbers to the next three consonants of the surname according to the Soundex coding guide. If there are not three consonants following the initial letter, use zeros to fill out the three-digit code.\n\nMost surnames can be coded using the Soundex coding guide. Names with prefixes, double letters, or letters side by side that have the same number of the Soundex coding system are described below.\n\nSoundex Coding Guide\n\nCode Key Letters and Equivalents 1 b, p, f, v 2 c, s, k, g, j, q, x, z 3 d, t 4 l 5 m, n 6 r\n\nNames with Prefixes\n\nIf the surname has a prefix, such as van, Von, De, Di, or Le, code it both with and without the prefix because it might be listed under either code. The surname vanDevanter, for example, could be V-531 or D-153.\n\nMc and Mac are not considered prefixes.\n\nNames with Double Letters\n\nIf the surname has any double letters, they should be treated as one letter. Thus, in the surname Lloyd, the second L should be crossed out, in the surname Gutierrez, the second R should be crossed out.\n\nNames with Letters Side by Side That Have the Same Number on the Soundex Coding Guide\n\nA surname may have different letters that are side by side and have the same number on the Soundex coding guide; for example, PF in Pfister (1 is the number for both P and F); CKS in Jackson (2 is the number for C, K, and S). These letters should be treated as one letter. Thus in the name Pfister, F should be crossed out; in the name Jackson, K and S should be crossed out.\n\nResearch Hints\n\n— On the schedules, the enumerators sometimes transposed the number of the supervisor's district and the enumeration district (ED). The EDs and visitation numbers, however, remain in the correct numerical order.\n\n— The Soundex card is not always accurate. If you initially cannot find a person listed, the card may be out of order. If the person is not where he or she is listed to be, it may be necessary to read the entire page of the schedule, the entire enumeration district, or the entire county.\n\n— Not everyone enumerated on the schedule is on the Soundex, as some names were missed by the indexer. In that case, it may be necessary to read the entire county.\n\n— Many institutions, even if enumerated at their street addresses, are found at the end of the enumeration district.\n\nEnumeration Districts (EDs)\n\nCensus schedules are arranged by state or territory, thereunder by county, and beginning in 1880 by enumeration district (ED). EDs were the areas that an enumerator covered in taking the census. To consult the schedules for a particular town, a minor civil division or geographical area, or a ward of a large city, one must know the enumeration district. National Archives Microfilm Publication T1224 describes ED boundaries as they were in 1920; present-day boundaries may not be the same.\n\nRolls 41-60 of Descriptions of Census Enumeration Districts, 1830-1890 and 1910-1950 (T1224) identify the enumeration district number assigned within the state, county, and city for the 1920 census. The descriptions are arranged alphabetically by state and thereunder by supervisor's district, which is a large geographic area that covers several counties. The descriptions are then arranged by county and thereunder by township or city. The ED is listed on the left-hand side of the page. Below are examples from T1224.\n\n1920 Enumeration Districts (T1224)\n\nRoll 41 Alabama, [Alaska, see roll 60], Arizona, Arkansas Roll 42 California, [Canal Zone, see roll 60], Colorado Roll 43 Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, [Hawaii, see roll 60] Roll 44 Illinois Roll 45 Indiana, Iowa Roll 46 Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana Roll 47 Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts Roll 48 Michigan, Minnesota Roll 49 Mississippi, Missouri Roll 50 Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico Roll 51 New Jersey, New York supervisor's districts 1 and 2 (Manhattan and Bronx), and supervisor's district 3 (part Kings County) Roll 52 New York supervisor's district 3 (part), supervisor's districts 4 to 6 (Queens and Richmond), supervisor's districts 7 to 22.
