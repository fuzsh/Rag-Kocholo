        "text": "From time to time, Prometric has to temporarily close a testing site for a variety of reasons including unforeseen events such as extreme weather, natural disaster, power outages, technical issues, pandemic impacts or other circumstances. We provide test takers with as much advance notice of upcoming site closures as possible. We recognize in some cases there is limited opportunity to reach test takers well in advance.\n\nThis list of temporary Prometric test center closures by market is updated daily. Please note that the list presents information by Prometric Test Center Number. Some physical locations have more than one Prometric Test Center Number reflecting multiple labs operating at the same address or location, so it is possible that some sites are testing while others may be closed on that date. Therefore, we encourage you to check your scheduling confirmation email to confirm your Prometric Test Center Number when reviewing this site closure list. You should also check your email and mobile notifications, which will be used to reflect all the important details or any changes to your appointment."
