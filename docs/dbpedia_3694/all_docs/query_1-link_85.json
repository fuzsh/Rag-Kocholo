While at Eastman, Hilary won the 2003 Nielsen Flute Concerto Competition allowing her to perform with the Eastman Philharmonia Chamber Orchestra in a gala concert honoring Professor Emeritus, Joseph Mariano. She has also won the Byron Hester Young Artist Competition, was a prizewinner at the Myrna Brown Young Artist Competition, and a silver medalist at the Fischoff Chamber Music Competition.

Shortly after obtaining her Bachelor’s at BW she played piccolo in the Erie Philharmonic and flute with the New Cleveland Chamber Players while teaching at Cleveland State University. She was appointed Principal Flute in the Akron Symphony and flute teacher at the University of Akron and then returned to her native Rochester to study with Bonita Boyd and obtain her Master’s at Eastman. She returned to Cleveland to become Principal Flute with the Ohio Chamber Orchestra, Cleveland Ballet and Cleveland Opera, as well as play in the orchestras for the many Broadway touring shows which stopped in Cleveland. Always drawn to art, she began to paint after nearly 20 years as a performer, and in 2012 had a featured exhibition at the gallery of the Arts and Cultural Council of Greater Rochester, a show entitled “Inspiration and Imagination.” She feels that her background as a performer led her to paint large canvases with bold color. She has developed experimental tech­niques working with different media, applying paint with unusual items, creating exciting patterns and textures. Us­ing her own method of layering and overlapping washes of acrylic paint as water medium, she gives her work luminous depth and richness, different from varying angles and light. Although not a collage artist, she sometimes uses (or hides) vin­tage images of women to express themes of feminine freedom. She also designs and creates unusual jewelry in pearls, semi-precious stones and sterling silver. www.paulasgallery.com\n\nGina Sebastian graduated with a B.M. from The Eastman School of Music in 2009.
