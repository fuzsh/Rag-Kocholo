        "text": "1981 is a black year in the history of Blue Oyster Cult. By August, a simmering mixture of internal band resentment, exasperation and frustration exploded with the net result that drummer/singer/songwriter and general creative pile-driver, Albert Bouchard was fired. In the UK, of all places!!\n\nAnd yet it all started so promisingly. In June, BOC released the fantastic \"Fire Of Unknown Origin\" and with Cultosaurus already under their belt, BOC fans were beginning to believe that the Cult were on their way. There was nothing going to stop their relentless march towards dominance now... except maybe... submission.\n\nBy losing Albert Bouchard, the creative heart was ripped out of the band and, for a lot of people, a major part of what made Blue Oyster Cult the band it was, was now gone.\n\nLighting man Rick Downey was hastily drafted in to take over the drums and BOC finished off the year with a massive tour with Foghat.\n\nThis page, as with a great part of the rest of the site, would not have been possible without the help of ex-BOC roadie, Sam Judd, and it's his notes which inform many of the facts contained herein...\n\nHave you got anything to contribute to this page? Reviews, missing info, ticket stubs, posters etc etc - if so, let me .\n\nWhat happened in January? If you know, please let me ...\n\nFri 6 Feb\n\nTV Appearance: \"Fridays\" - Allen Lanier guests with Jim Carroll Band\n\nFridays was an ABC late-night live comedy show that attempted to mine the vein created by the success of NBC's Saturday Night Live, and ran for three seasons between 11 April 1980 - 23 April 1982.\n\nThe featured musical artist for the 6 Feb 1981 show was the Jim Carroll Band (including Allen Lanier on keyboards), performing three tracks from 1980's \"Catholic Boy\" album:\n\nPeople Who Died\n\nDay and Night (written by Lanier/Carroll)\n\nIt's Too Late\n\nVideo\n\nWhat happened in March? If you know, please let me ...\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\n\"Rock Superbowl X\"\n\nDave Douglass\n\nI'm glad to see that someone else provided an entry on this show - I'd lost my ticket stub and couldn't recall the exact date. I was definitely in attendance at this show, my first BOC show ever. As a clueless and wide-eyed 16-year-old just trying to take in the whole crazy Rock Superbowl scene, I was years and years away from having the presence of mind to actually compile and keep a set list, but I've retained some very clear memories of this concert.\n\nI recall that I knew every song that they played, so they definitely did not play \"Burnin' For You\", since it would be two or three more months until that song and the Fire of Unknown Origin album were unleashed on an unsuspecting world. They definitely played their three biggest songs up to that point, \"Reaper\", \"Godzilla\", and \"Cities On Flame\".\n\nBut the most striking memory I've kept is when they played \"Unknown Tongue\" from Cultosaurus Erectus - it was late afternoon, Eric Bloom walked up to the front edge of the stage, and as he sang the lines about \"and then she took her father's razor\", he pulled out a special-effects knife and drew it across his open palm while fake blood spilled from the fake cut he had made!\n\nWhat an amazing juxtaposition, to see that spectacle occurring on such a sunny and pleasant springtime afternoon! I was definitely thrilled to be seeing BOC, my favorite band then and now, but too many years have passed for me to have an accurate memory now of everything they played then -- I just recall that they sounded really good and put on a very satisfying show.\n\nI'm very thankful that I got this last-chance opportunity to see BOC with Albert Bouchard. Later in 1981, I desperately wanted to go see them at the Lakeland Civic Center on October 10th, but unbreakable family obligations prevented me from going -- this bothered me for years, until your website showed me that Rick Downey had become the BOC drummer by that time!\n\nI certainly didn't know that then (I had thought the switch happened in 1982), and would have fully expected to see Albert Bouchard still in the drummer's seat, so the fact that I was unable to see that 10/10/81 show actually saved me from a crushing disappointment. Funny how life works!\n\nAlso, I can definitely say that UFO was the first act of the day, then Firefall, then BOC, then Cheap Trick, and then finally Heart.\n\nThanks so much for the existence of this website - long may it continue!\n\nRalph\n\nI found the attendance figures for this gig in the 26 June 1981 edition of the \"The Orlando Sentinel\":\n\nRock Superbowl X, April 1981; Heart, Cheap Trick, Blue Oyster Cult, Firefall, UFO; attendance 48,000.\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\n\"Super Bowl of Rock'n'Roll\"\n\nMike Breene\n\nAnother BOC show and an interesting one, at that. This show took place at Miami Baseball Stadium; not exectly a great place for a rock show. The stage was so unusually high, and the sound was pretty much crap for most of the acts. The opening band was some popular local band that kind of sucked. The next band, however, was a glimpse into my unknown future of thrash metal. MOTORHEAD!! I had never heard these guys before and I was simply stunned by their performance. I had never heard music like this before, played so fast and so loud.\n\nI wasn't quite sure I liked it or hated it. I'm sure the rest of the crowd felt the same. I'm not sure about the songs they played, but I do remember \"Overkill\" and I actually liked that one a lot. I'm sure a lot of U.K. fans know about the history of Motorhead opening for the Cult and getting treated quite shabbily at the Hammersmith shows in '75 or '76. Well, they probably didn't get much better treatment at this gig either because they played a pretty short set with no encore. In fact, I remember Lemmy saying at the end of the set \"... Is their going to be an encore? Doesn't fuckin' look like it!! See ya!!\"\n\nPoor Lemmy. However, I would get the full message of Motorhead about 5 years later when I saw them at Santa Monica Civic with Megadeth opening. They just killed that night. Now, I love them to death. I still run into Lemmy at the Rainbow (his 2nd home) in L.A. from time to time. A legend, to be sure.\n\nFinally, after a long day standing, BOC came on. This was right before they released Fire Of Unknown Orgin. Despite the lame sound, they played an energetic set. I'm sure they played \"Burnin' For You\" and \"After Dark\" from Fire. They sounded great. BOC's set was rather short however, due to Heart being the headliners. I think they played \"Hot Rails To Hell\" \"The Reaper\" \"ETI\" \"Red and the Black\" but I'm kind of cloudy on the setlist. They also did the 5 guitars mark III.\n\nOverall, a pretty decent show and a preview of their full-blown \"Fire\" tour about to be unleashed. It was also the last time I saw Albert on drums for a few years (more on that in a later review).\n\nI stayed to see Heart but left after 3 songs. Just couldn't get into it. Also, I had stupidly taken a bunk hit of acid I bought from a concertgoer. Fucked my stomach up hella bad!! Not a wise move. Not even bunk acid can stop me from seeing my favorite Oysters, though. Good show.\n\nRushfan\n\nThe unknown local band at this show was Freewheel - just thought I'd pass this along. Unfortunately I no longer have the concert T-shirt as proof.\n\nChris Dupre\n\nAt this show, all the bands in order:\n\nFreewheel\n\nMotorhead (1st U.S. gig, met them after show)\n\nFirefall (believe it or not!!!!)\n\nBOC\n\nHeart\n\nJorge\n\nAnybody that was there would remember that BOC opened with Godzilla... Godzilla monster on stage.\n\nAlso ripped with supersonic power Don't Fear The Reaper.\n\nSean Quinn\n\n19 Apr, 1981: Bobby Maduro Stadium/Miami Baseball Stadium\n\nBand running order:\n\nMotorhead\n\nFirefall\n\nBOC\n\nHeart\n\nSetlist:\n\nDr. Music\n\nE.T.I.\n\nCities on Flame\n\nHot Rails to Hell\n\nFire of Unknown Origin\n\nUnknown Tongue\n\nGodzilla\n\n5 Guitars (Golden Age of Leather/Texas Radio and the Big Beat)\n\nBorn to be Wild\n\nME 262\n\nEncore: Don't Fear the Reaper\n\nGodzilla made an appearance. This was outdoors, so it was probably the large Godzilla. I don't remember \"Golden Age,\" but I have it written down.\n\nIt must have been the 5 guitars version, but I distinctly remember them playing The Doors' \"Texas Radio\" as their 5 guitars, though I don't have that written down.\n\n\"FoUO\" was introduced as from the upcoming album. I'm lucky to have seen the original lineup, they lived up to expectations and I was already a huge fan.\n\nIn the late 80s they played at a tiny sports bar across the street from my college; I figured that they must not have been very good by that point but now I wish I'd gone to see them.\n\nIncidentally this was Motorhead's US debut, on the \"Ace of Spades\" tour. \"America,\" from the following year's \"Iron Fist\" album, mentions Miami.\n\nWhat happened in May? If you know, please let me ...\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\nSoft White Underbelly Show\n\nHenry Biedenkapp\n\nI remember an opening act at Hammerheads who's band had an amazing long-haired blond singer. Years later, I would imagine that it was a White Lion type band.\n\nRalph\n\nIf anyone can put a name to this band, please let me know...\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\nSoft White Underbelly Show\n\nDFFD\n\nGreat club show, tiny dive in North Jersey. We got there at noon to insure we were in the front row. Partied all day, Met BOC fans from LI that told me of the Spit show.\n\nMet the band again, started to realize Joe and Albert were the friendliest, Eric would blow right by, Lanier and Buck would chat, but never remember you later, but the Brothers would, and even ask about things you had mentioned in past.\n\nDavid Roter opened, with Manny Caiati standing in for Andy Shernoff, since Sandy Pearlman & Murray Krugman were suing Andy Shernoff at the time over a live Dictators cassette only release for their 10%.\n\nIn fact, I was friends with David Roter guitarist Jack Rigg & bassist Manny Caiati as they were in Helen Wheels band at the time, and they told me that was the first show opening for BOC. Was told later that Albert's insistence on using Roter to open was one of the problems.\n\nThe line-up for these dates with BOC was: Joe Played Guitar & keyboards in the David Roter Method. Manny Caiati on bass, Jack Rigg lead guitar, Albert drums. On the early gigs from Spring 1981, the lineup included Andy Shernoff on bass, and also Top 10 would jam on the encores occassionally. The set list was way longer & included more Dictators tunes.\n\nI remember Eric Bloom intro'd the band wearing glasses with a fake penis nose!!! And Albert wore a fake beard during Roter's set - it was rather long and ZZ Topish! - Joe didn't need the fake beard, as his was in full effect at the time.\n\nRoter was a trip, that guy killed me. I saw the David Roter Method several times, before the June shows. I still have the lobby sign from the Fountain Casino, where Andy bought us backstage to meet Joe & Albert. Albert had his Doctor bag at the time;) LOL!! I remember him stomping around backstage as Godzilla played on the PA, acting all nutty!!!!\n\nI also just remembered being bribed by Buck's roadie at Hole In The Wall to guard his wireless receiver, which was taped to the front monitor. In exchange, I got my first BOC drumsticks that night, and a bunch of picks from every member except Albert, that one took until I worked with Helen to get:)\n\nRalph\n\nWireless? In 1981?\n\nDFFD\n\nYeah, 1981 was just on the cusp of wireless tech, I imagine Buck's setup was quite costly, and it had very thin, about 1 foot long, antennas on both ends, with another receiver atop his amp.\n\nSince the Hole had no security pit, and you were inches from the band, they actually needed to be guarded, or get bent. Since I had arrived at the club at noon to ensure my front row spot, I was elected upon entry.\n\nNothing like the wireless I had a few years later that cost $125 and only had 1 base station. I heard early units in 1980 were as high as $6000 US dollars.\n\nBob Simpson\n\nI remember going to the Hole in the Wall concert June 13, 1981. I had a belt that said Soft White Underbelly, at the end I handed it to Buck who held it up in front of the audience and then gave me his pick.\n\nDoes anybody who went remember this?\n\nJeff Thomas\n\nIt has been a long time from that evening. It is funny you talked about Buck's wireless taped to the front monitor. If my memory is correct it was taped close to the top of the monitor. My Ex and I got scolded when the antenna got bent.\n\nWe were up front and got pushed into the stage more than once. I did get a Buck pick that evening right from the hand of the man. Still have the white pick with black lettering. I also went a few nights later at Bonds Casino in NYC. The stage was a bit higher there.\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\nSoft White Underbelly Show\n\nDFFD\n\nThis Emerald City venue is sometimes referred to as the Latin Casino...\n\nSlipkid\n\ni saw BOC at Emerald City in NJ, which was a small club, across the way from philadelphia - they were billed as SOFT WHITE UNDERBELLY in the ads for the show, and back in those pre-internet days a lot of people didn't know who SWU was (i certainly never heard of 'em), but luckily the radio station ads played DON'T FEAR THE REAPER in the background, so i had a pretty good guess that the show had something to do with BOC...\n\nto make a long story longer, i went with a couple friends and the start time was supposed to be around 7 or 8 pm with doors opening up an hour prior to that\n\nnote that back then BOC were very popular and we could only see them in big arenas like the spectrum in philly, so i think this was a sellout and the crowd anticipation and excitement were very high, nobody could believe we were going to be able to see BOC in such a small place...\n\nthis was during the summer so all us kids were out of school (actually i had already graduated college by that point), and alot of people showed up pretty early... and it was a hot summer day if i remember right... and i don't remember if the club had airco or not\n\nanyways, we were there early hanging out in the parking lot probably most of the day, drinking/smoking/etc as were other people... having a party... finally we get into the club, everybody rushes in like a stampede to get right up front near the stage to get a good spot\n\ni was in the front row with i think 5 friends - and if the fog of years gone by, and the haze of substances has distorted my memory too much, i think the place was packed right from the start\n\nand i think this was around 7pm, if not earlier - might even have been 6??? was anyone reading this there that night to help me remember right???? cause this was one very strange night - as far as we knew, this was ONLY a SOFT WHITE UNDERBELLY (ie: BLUE OYSTER CULT) gig... there were no advertised opening bands or anything like that... and the tix had a start time of 8pm at the latest (again, if i remember right)\n\nso we were there, we were inside, we were ready to go, we were fired up, we were TUNED UP, we were hot, we were sweaty, we were hungry, drunk, stoned, you name it - and we wanted to see BOC and we wanted to see 'em NOW!!!!!\n\nbut they made us wait... and wait... and wait... and wait... and wait... and wait... and wait... and wait... and... you get the idea - the time dragged on and on and on and on interminably\n\ni think we were waiting around 3+ hours, yelling, screaming, drinking some more, taking turns holding our spot at the stage & getting food/drink/bathroom breaks so as not to lose our prime spots - the natives were VERY restless...\n\nthen FINALLY... maybe around 9-9:30???... out comes some band we didn't want to see... WHO ARE THESE GUYS????? WE'RE WAITING HERE FOR HOURS FOR BOC???? GET OFF BOC'S STAGE!!!!! BOOOOO!!!!! HISSSSSSS!!!!! BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC!!!!\n\neverybody in the crowd was yelling at this poor opening band for their entire set - perhaps even things were thrown at them, i don't recall\n\nfinally their drummer, who was also the singer - who had a futuristic microphone type microphone thingee on his head like headphones, which for those daze was pretty cutting edge - well this drummer had had enough of the crowd abuse, and he started giving us some abuse back, yelling at us, giving us the finger etc...\n\nwhich only fired up the crowd even worse and what i remember most of all is the surrealistic sight of the drummer standing up and yelling \"YOU SUCK\" to us, and us in unison yelling \"NO YOU SUCK\" back at him over and over again, until finally he & his band stalked off very angry... i think he might have thrown his sticks or somehting like that at us, i forget\n\nso there we were, all doubly pissed and fired up that this crap band dare soil BOC's stage and keep us waiting longer for the zillagods, but we felt good, damn good, because we chased these s.o.b.'s off the stage, so BRING ON BOC !!! LET'S GO!!!!! BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC!!!!\n\n10 minutes go by - we're yelling BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC!!!!\n\nwe're booing, we're screaming, we're getting pissed off, we're getting tired...\n\n30 minutes go by... we're yelling BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC!!!! we're booing, we're screaming, we're getting pissed off, we're getting tired\n\nan hour goes by - we're yelling BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC!!!!\n\nwe're booing, we're screaming, we're getting pissed off, we're getting tired...\n\ntwo hours go by... we're yelling BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC!!!!\n\nwe're booing, we're screaming, we're getting pissed off, we're getting tired...\n\nthree hours go by... we're yelling BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC BOC!!!!\n\nwe're booing, we're screaming, we're getting pissed off, we're getting tired...\n\nwell maybe i'm exaggerating the time - but maybe i'm not - i don't think i am - i think it wasn't until something like 1 am or later that finally BOC came on...\n\nHOLY S*%*!!! THE DRUMMER IS THE SAME GUY WE WERE YELLING AT!!! HE'S ALBERT BOUCHARD!!!!!!!! OH F*%*%!!!!!!!! WE HAD BOOED ALBERT OFF THE STAGE BEFORE!!! uh oh...\n\nwe had pissed off bouchard so much (i guess?) that some sort of aggro must have gone on backstage and he made us wait forever and ever b4 BOC came on ?????? or something like that - maybe he didn't want to come on at all - i'd love to hear his perspective on what happened after all these years (if he remembers)\n\nbut here's the kicker - after all day partying, standing up in front of the stage for what seemed like 3 weeks (probably about 7 hours???), i couldn't take it anymore - the crowd surged forward and crushed the stage like a giant single celled amoeba - my feet left the floor and i was being held up by the crush (which was a good thing since i was too tired to stand up anymore)... but i couldn't take it... i had to get out of there\n\ni fought to turn myself around, got down on my hands and knees, and crawled all the way to the back of the club, through peoples knees, i remember climbing up in the back on some kind of raised carpeted floor that had trees planted in it (??) and collapsing, and there i spotted one of my friends flat passed out on the floor!! and another friend joined us shortly\n\nwe watched the show from all the way in the back of the club, sitting on the carpet i think, not being able to see anything, and i don't recall how long the actual gig was, but that's my longest BOC \"outing\"\n\nall in all it was a bummer :-(\n\nSam Judd\n\nI remember how bad David Roter's set SUCKED & how pissed Al got about the crowd hating them... (remember those fake beards too)...\n\nMain thing I remember about Emerald City was waiting ALL DAY & ALL NIGHT to do the damn show & get out of there... I also remember that instead of the intro music we were using at the time, I got GpG to play a tape I had made of a B-29 starting all 4 engines, warming them up & then taking off... it sounded amazing thru the PA... he then proceeded to record the show OVER my damn B29 tape... DOH!!!\n\nSlipkid\n\nHey Sam - do you know WHY it took so long to get the show started??? and do you have a tape of that show??? or even the ROTER set? i'd even love to hear the ROTER set just for the YOU SUCK shouting match! that would take me back to my youth :)\n\nSam Judd\n\nMost of those jive ass clubs book the shows that late and tell the patrons an early start time... all of the ticket money and then some is going to the band... the longer they have a club full of people drinking and spending money, the more they make... that spit show started dreadfully late too as I remember...\n\nI got no tape, but there was sure as shit one made, cause it was recorded over my B29 tape and GpG just gave me a new blank... Albert usually got the show tapes and I believe he eventually gave all the ones he still had to Bolle...\n\nI hope there's not a tape of Roter... nobody should have to suffer thru that crap again...\n\nDFFD\n\nSam's right, most Shithole clubs make all their money on booze, Emerald City was one of the worst offenders.\n\nThe club was a Disco, they made their money off the Saturday Night Fever crowd, as I remember they bragged the lighted floor had been designed by the same guy that designed the disco in Fever.\n\nThe first show I saw there was Iggy Pop, only a small crowd of rockers up front, and tons of open shirted, gold chain wearing disco idiots not digging it at all. They used to wait until at least midnight to start the shows, but usually you could get there late and still get up front, the only time I was ever in the 2nd row there was for the Pretenders show.\n\nSam, don't be so hard on the late Mr Roter, they actually had a few good gigs in NYC without the BOC fans booing. I remember in particular a CBGB show (sans fake beards) where they rocked the house for 2 sets, played Unknown Tongue, Il Duce, Joan Crawford, and Dictators tunes. Allen Lanier even got dragged onstage for the BOC tunes, and played keys while Joe played guitar. I still have the setlist signed by Allen somewhere! (oops, shouldn't have mentioned that, one more thing Ralph will be bugging me for;)\n\nDavid was a very strange guy, a school guidance counselor by day that wrote weird songs at night. It was a whole comedy thing, all his songs were bent. You should hear Chocolate Candy, LOL!!\n\nThe shows with BOC were their worst, considering Manny joined the band the morning of the Hole In The Wall show, and was learning the songs onstage!! I remember afterwards them saying how much BOC had hated the idea of Roter opening, but the Bouchards pushed for it.\n\nBonnie Lee McCleary\n\nI was at this show!!! It was by far one of the most amazing shows I ever saw.\n\nI was in front of the stage and I was mesmerized watching as Albert Bouchard's drum solo on Godzilla, especially when the strobe light started.\n\nNext, smoke came up from the drums and he ended wearing a Godzilla mask with red eyes!! It was incredible!!\n\nWish I could find this video someday to show my kids what real music was like back in the good old days!\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\nSoft White Underbelly Show\n\nWLIR-FM broadcast\n\nDFFD\n\nThe Spit Club was later renamed Key Largo by the time BOC played there again, 12/20/84. Unfortunately, it had also become a dinner theater, and the band had to play at a reduced volume. Probably the quietest show I ever saw BOC play, you could hear fans talking over the band, and I was in the front row!!!\n\nBTW - Roter did not open at Spit, I can't remember who did, if anyone.\n\nSam Judd\n\nClub Spit was called Uncle Sam's during the early hours, then they ran everybody out, changed the decor of the place by adding a bunch of diamond plate flooring and hanging cyclone fence all over and brought everyone in thru the service entrance to make it \"grittier\"... What a sham...\n\nThey also refused to turn off or turn down the DJ music while we packed up and loaded out (the place was open for several more hours).. made for a really god awful loadout with the stagehands totally unable to hear any instructions... one of the worst ever...\n\nAre you sure that it became Key Largo?... seems like that was a different place... I always thought Key Largo was the place that was originally Hammerheads...\n\nDFFD\n\nI think I'm right on this one, because I lived far away, and only went to the 1984 show because I had such fond memories of the 81 spit show. I even got to say hi to the boys because I remembered the stage door;)\n\nHammerhead's did change it's name too, I saw the band there 12/29/87, but can't remember what the hell it was called at the time. Kingston Station or something, I think was what Wrax told me. That was the only time I went there.\n\nSam Judd\n\nOne of the main reasons I think that is that both Hammerheads and Key Largo were in West Islip and Spit/Uncle Sams was in Levittown... those towns are not THAT close together are they??\n\nNot to mention Key Largo was about 5 times bigger than Spit... I've even found a Zebra site that shows how many time Zebra played Hammerheads/Key Largo W.Islip L.I.\n\nKen V\n\nI was at both the Hammerheads show and the Spit show, I believe that Jim Carroll opened the Spit show.\n\nDFFD\n\nWow, Jim Carroll opened at Spit, that's funny, I didn't even remember that, and I actually like his LPs!!\n\nRalph\n\nWas Jim Carroll doing a Garrison Keilor type deal and just reading extracts from his stuff or was it an actual band or what? And did Allen Lanier join in... ?\n\nDFFD\n\nI would have pics if Lanier jammed with Jim Carroll that night :)\n\nJim used to have a band that at times included Lenny Kaye, at Spit it would have been around the time his 1st LP was released so I would imagine that was the backing band.\n\nSaw Jim a few times between 1981-4, never saw Allen with him, except on the TV shows. Nowadays he does the poetry reading thing, no more band sadly. The last time my friend saw Jim a couple years ago in NYC, he was just reading direct from Basketball Diaries...\n\nRob Fontano\n\nThe tune up shows for this tour were held in small clubs on Long Island. In many instances the band played under the name Soft White Underbelly.\n\nThe kick off show for the tour was at a club called \"Spit\" the alter ego to the disco \"Uncle Sam's\"\n\nBy the way - Spit did not become Key Largo. It was not a club after it closed. Hammerheads became Key Largo. It was in Islip, we used go there to see Twisted Sister, Zebra, The Good Rats and a host of other Long Island acts. I was once forcibly removed during a Pat Travers show there. That was the first and last time I drank Yukon Jack... oh the good old days.\n\nThe Spit show was incredible. It was broadcast on WLIR. My buddy Chris still has the tape. That was the first time the drummer wore the Godzilla mask.\n\nWe saw both the MSG and Nassau Collasium shows with Foghat. I miss Lonesome Dave.\n\nCharlie Martin\n\nI saw BOC as Soft White Underbelly at a club called \"Spit\" it was actually Levitown NY.\n\nI sat on the amp boxes right in front of Eric and next to the Amp Stack. I know a couple of tunes were Godzilla and Buck's Boogie, I really don't remember all that much more. The band was really cool because we had our feet under the stage and was close enough that Eric accepted a beer from us.\n\nI proudly received a good portion of my tinitus that night.\n\nHenry Biedenkapp\n\nI can confirm that it was Jim Carroll who opened - it was a surprise considering that BOC was always paired with Foghat, Angel, Zebra and the likes.\n\nCarroll just seemed to be a very unlikely opener and naturally it didn't go well with the audience.\n\nIt was somewhat chaotic getting into the place, but it was an awesome show.\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\nSoft White Underbelly Show\n\n\"A Night On The Road\" broadcast\n\nRalph\n\nI can't be sure of the exact setlist order for this show - from what Bolle has reported in Morning Final, sonic skullduggery was afoot:\n\nThe second show was held on June 16th at The Bond's International Casino and the recording trucks were waiting outside to capture the show for \"A Night On The Road.\" This show was aired almost two months later on August 8th. The show is very similar to the previous day's set (at the Spit), and runs about 95 minutes.\n\nAs it happened, the mixing budget ran out, so Steve Schenck & George Geranios opted for splicing in parts of the previously mixed Old Waldorf San Francisco show from the year before.\n\n\"ME 262\" ends the actual running order of the set. They salvaged one more new song from the Bonds performance, \"Heavy Metal,\" and positioned it after \"ME 262\" (it was actually played in the encore at Bond's).\n\nAll the other songs from this \"Night on the Road\" broadcast were taken from the Old Waldorf but were edited onto the Bond show using the between-song stage patter from Bond's to keep a continuum. So, actually from the Old Waldorf, but included here in the guise of Bond's are \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\" \"Godzilla,\" \"Born To Be Wild,\" \"The Five Guitars,\" and \"Roadhouse Blues.\"\n\nAnd that's even before you get onto the subject of Steve Schenck overdubbing Allen's keyboard solo on \"Flaming Telepaths\" later in the studio \"to make it sound right.\"\n\nAnyway, the broadcast setlist was as follows:\n\nDr. Music\n\nETI\n\nBurnin' for You\n\nFire of Unknown Origin\n\nCities on Flame\n\nJoan Crawford\n\nFlaming Telepaths\n\nVeteran of the Psychic Wars\n\nHot Rails to Hell\n\nME 262\n\nHeavy Metal\n\n(Don't Fear) The Reaper\n\nGodzilla\n\nBorn to Be Wild\n\n5 Guitars\n\nRoadhouse Blues\n\nThis was obviously wrong, and I even doubt that the 5 Guitars was played that night. They usually seemed to miss that one off when doing SWU-designated gigs - although I do take note that the one that was spliced into the ANOTR broadcast was actually from a SWU show at the Old Waldorf in August the previous year...\n\nAnyway - I've taken some liberties with the setlist on the right - eg I've removed said 5 guitars - and based the order on contextual logic, rather than the ANOTR broadcast setlist.\n\nFor example, I've switched the order of Hot Rails and ME262 so that it conforms with the order played the previous night, but clearly that could easily be wrong.\n\nIf you know what it was for sure, please let me know...\n\nSam Judd\n\nI remember that Bonds show like a nightmare that just wouldn't end... starting with no elevator, a 150ft escalator that didn't move and a me with a Steinway grand piano... uuuuhhh NO.. hello Studio Instrument Rentals, please bring me a Yamaha CP70 electric piano and deliver it to the STAGE please..\n\nThen the tuner came & told me that piano was a piece of shite... he did his best, but Joe B sat down behind it during line checks (Lanier was a no show) and deemed the tuning unacceptable... tuner was summoned back... he & Joe argued over it, he tuned it to satisfy Joe & that was that...\n\nBut I believe the show was schedded VERY late as well... but there were major problems with the recording truck (I even tried to find it at one point, went all around the block & NEVER did find it!!... tried following the mic snake to it, but lost it among a bunch of power distro cables all over a fire escape)...\n\nThe crew was operating on almost no sleep for several days on that run... it was NO fun at all... but we were getting REALLY good news about Burnin for you getting massive airplay & buzz all over the country...\n\nEverybody else is just green, have you seen the chart?\n\nIt's a helluva start, it could be made into a monster\n\nIf we all pull together as a team.\n\nAnd did we tell you the name of the game, boy?\n\nWe call it Riding the Gravy Train.\n\nThat's all I've got...\n\nSirrastus\n\nI went to the Bonds Intl show - they did Burnin' twice because the tape messed up the first time. I remember either Eric or Buck saying \"Nothing we can't do better a second time\" Played it at either the end or before the encore. Hard to recall but my best guess is BEFORE the encore after they came back on stage...\n\nAlso the only time I saw them do Heavy Metal. My friend and I thought it was funny as two black girls danced to Cities. Maybe they were just Bonds regulars and not BOC fans. :)\n\nA cool show - even 12 yr old Lib Monkey was there. I used to have the radio promo albums for the show - it was called \"A Night On The Road\" with Blue Oyster Cult. I sold it on ebay.\n\nI taped the Spit show off radio. My friend was DJing there at the time - I've never been to that club (It actually had two names at the time I believe).\n\nHave you guys noticed the screwup on Joan Crawford. BTW - That was about a month after I saw the David Roter Connection at Max's Kansas City with the Bouchard's premiering Joan Crawford. I had this memory of Roter and the boys doing a sendup of He's A Rebel called He's A Rabbi. After many years went by I just assumed I dreamt it. When I met Joe B at a Chiller Theatre convention I asked him about it and he confirmed they did it. Yowza-dat vas no dream baby!\n\nEdosaurus\n\nI was lucky enough to be at the Bonds' show, and taped it off the radio when it was first broadcast. There was no opening act, it was just a SWU show.\n\nA couple memories from that night. It's the only time I've heard the same song played twice in the same set by BOC. They played Burnin'4U two times, I seem to remember something about some mic troubles. It took a loong time for BOC to hit the stage that night.\n\nThe 2nd \"Burnin\" was played with the encores I think, remember they said it was for broadcast and something had gone wrong with the recording. Don't remember any playing or singing mistakes during the first take.\n\nThe crew spent a long time adjusting lights, and tweaking a bunch of stuff. The crowd was growing fairly impatient, but of course the Boys came out and blew everyone away with the new stuff off of FOUO.\n\nAbout if the 5 guitars were played or not - wouldn't surprise me if they did not play the five guitars, but I don't remember...\n\nThe next week, I called up EB while he was hosting his then weekly radio show on WLIR. I got to ask him about the show, and he told me how The Clash and crew had absolutely trashed the club during their week stay at the club. The resulting Clash On Broadway was from this run of shows.\n\nonegoodmeteor\n\nI was at the performance. B4U was performed for the second time as the first number of the encore.\n\nRegarding the 5 guitars - I also was at the Hole in the Wall performance a few nights earlier and 5 Guitars was definitely NOT played there.\n\nFrom the Bonds show, I have one of two very vivid recollections: either they played it and I thought \"Great, it's not out of the set\" or they didn't play it and I thought \"Crap, it's out of the set.\"\n\nWhat clouds my memory, is that - as we know - 5 Guitars was definitely dropped after Albert left that year.\n\nWed 17 Jun\n\nRadio Interview (Buck and Eric): \"Robert Klein Radio Show\"\n\nKevin Walker\n\nDuring the interview, Eric said they did a show last night at Bonds and, as that show was June 16th 1981, it seems to me that it was recorded on June 17th 1981 at RCA studios New York:\n\nHost: Robert Klein\n\nGuests:\n\nBuck Dharma\n\nEric Bloom\n\nSouthside Johnny\n\nInterview structure:\n\nIntro\n\nRobert Talks\n\nEric & Buck Talk about the Bonds show the day before this interview,not printing lyrics and more\n\nEric & Buck Talk about the Black & Blue tour,Dio and more\n\nSouthside Johnny talks about new live lp \"Reach Up and Touch the Sky\" and talks about the cost of touring with Eric and Buck\n\nSouthside Johnny, Eric & Buck Talk about lyrics, 50's bands, new LPs and more\n\nRalph\n\nAs usual, ignore what wikipedia says regarding the release date for this record - it came out during the third week of June. My current best guess is Mon 22 Jun 1981.\n\nIt was certainly available in the NE record shops for purchase from Thu 25 Jun, and the Sun 28 Jun 1981 of \"The Morning Call\" [Allentown PA] mentioned this in its review of the rescheduled 27 Jun Allentown gig:\n\nThe New York-based quintet has a lot riding on its new studio LP,\"Fire Of Unknown Origin,\" which was released last week.\n\nHence the date I've provided above. If you know different, please let me know...\n\nRalph\n\nThis date was posted on the boc.com official site with no location details...\n\nSam Judd\n\nThis could only have been the Merv Griffin show taping, as we were in Pokeepsie for several days rehearsing and flew band and 2 crew out to LA for that (I wasn't invited)...\n\nRalph\n\nDunno - it just gave the following setlist, annotated as \"BBC Rock Hour\":\n\nETI\n\nVeteran Of The Psychic Wars\n\nSeven Screaming Diz-Busters\n\nJoan Crawford\n\nBurnin' For You\n\nGodzilla\n\n(Don't Fear) The Reaper\n\nAnybody got any info on this? I'm pretty sure that this date is just a broadcast date of the aforementioned setlist, and not an actual gig date...\n\nTom Moretti\n\nI remember this gig being a bit lackluster, Albert was starting to fade. A lot of the crowd didnt know the new Fire of Unknown Origin material and it left the show uneven.\n\nJim Montague\n\nThis was my first BOC and first concert ever. (See July 19,1979 for my almost first BOC concert story) Although Tom may be right about it being flat, I just remember being in awe seeing BOC live.\n\nMy seats were row J, 10th row left of the center section. I remember standing on my seat the whole show. I also remember thinking how cool the light show was, prety simple stuff like king in yellow queen in red light changes and the strobe lights during Alberts drum solo.\n\nFire was just released that month, so I don't remember whether I had the album yet or not. Talas was the opening act. That was a 3 man band with Billy Sheehan on bass.\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\nRescheduled to 27 June due to heavy storms\n\nJeffrey Boyle\n\nOk, original gig cancelled not due to rain but due to believe it or not, tornados! Massive storm.\n\nForget who the original opening act was but it wasn't humble pie.\n\nShow was rescheduled for later in the summer, by then was a free concert as they let in a lot of people for the original show and then the tornados touched down and they cancelled so they said if you had a ticket you could come to the makeup show, of course 5000+ people said they lost their stubs so the rescheduled show, if you showed up, they let you in (Makoul Productions were not the smartest concert promoters).\n\nRalph\n\nThanks to the above ad kindly sent by Sam You, I now know that this rescheduled show did in fact take place just two days later on the 27th.\n\nRalph\n\nThe only indication I have that this gig took place is the mention in the above article kindly sent to me by Sam You.\n\nVisit his EasternPa MusicChannel Facebook page and check out his concert memorabilia...\n\nStop Press: Click the link from the Erie County Fieldhouse Concerts Facebook page to see a concert ad and ticket from this gig:\n\n26 June 1981 Advert\n\n26 June 1981 Ticket\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\nRescheduled from 25th June due to heavy storms\n\nJoe Georganna\n\nThere is one concert in 81 that I failed to keep the ticket of. It was my first BOC concert and unfortunately the last one with the entire band intact. I can find no record of this \"phantom concert\".\n\nI remember that Fire of Unknown Origin was just released. This was in June. My friend Jerry bought it on a Sunday and I remember getting mine on that following Tuesday. Jerry gave me a call to see if I wanted to see BOC at an outside venue, the Allentown Fairgrounds in Allentown PA. It was a rescheduled date because the previous one was rained out - I think it had been originally scheduled for the previous night. I know that it was the week after Fire was released and I'm thinking it was a Wednesday. Don't ask me why.\n\nThe opening act was Humble Pie.\n\nAll I remember is the opening song which was Heavy Metal Black and Silver and the great bass solo and drum interplay between the brothers Bouchard. I remember Albert's arms and drumsticks appearing from below the stage and drumming on Joe's bass. Then he emerged from under the stage and did their bass and drum act. I think they may have also played Fire of Unknown origin.\n\nFor some reason I had some idea that it was the last show in the US before the European Tour. Eric may have said this on stage. Anyway I have not been able to track it down. Too many dead brain cells from that time period. Maybe you know someone who remembers this show. I know I didn't dream it.\n\nIf you find anything out about when the Allentown show took place, it would be much appreciated.\n\nJim Dietzler\n\nThis was my first of several BOC shows at the Fairgrounds.\n\nI was in HS, school was in session and very close to the end of the school year (so June 10 fits) and a postponement makes sense as I remember jumping in the back of a Chevette at the last minute at school's end when someone asked if i wanted to go because somone else couldn't make it--we didn't pre buy them back then.\n\nI know I've seen Aldo Nova support BOC at the Fairgrounds - I had thought it was at this gig, but it may have been the 19 Sep 1982 one. We may have even missed the opener, so I can't be sure... Most of the shows at the Fairgrounds had some pretty forgettable openers lol. I know I saw them at least twice there between 81-84.\n\nSadly, I don't have any of the ticket stubs and those were hazy crazy days, so i could be wrong about the dates... Given that it was the 80s, i'm not certain about much --lol.\n\nSam You\n\nThe opener was Humble Pie - a huge storm blew in - it rained so hard it flooded the area under the stage and that is were the power was located and yes the show was rescheduled a couple of days later.\n\nWe ended up giving the promoter hell because our ticket fell apart due to the rain - hundreds of kids stood around to get a stub \"no one could leave without one\" - some even got back in line twice like me...\n\nKurt Sveilis\n\nWas looking for my first gig I ever saw and came across your site. My brother and I aged 15 and I 13 convinced my parents that going to this concert would be a good idea.\n\nWhat I can remember of course was the storm as well as the scramble to get our ticket stubs back.\n\nWhat is stuck in my memory is that Joe Perry Project was one of the opening acts. He didn't last long got angry at his guitar and stuck it into an amp and walked off.\n\nAll very exciting for a 13 year old kid wondering if that was part of the act.\n\nRalph\n\nI've had no reports of Joe Perry being on this bill, only Humble Pie... Are you sure you're not thinking of your second gig at that venue...? There's a documented Joe Perry Project gig at the Allentown Fairgrounds a month later, on 26 July 1981...\n\nBobzilla\n\nThe Sunday June 28, 1981, BOC concert, at Pine Knob, in Clarkston, Michigan was a great show. I don't remember the exact set list, but the highlight of the night was Buck playing Born to Rock. The standards were played from Fire of Unknown Origin, and the band sounded great.\n\nPine Knob is an outdoor pavilion venue, and the sound was always excellent. The picture is a classic shot of BOC playing under the watchful eye of Sam Judd. I remember Allen's keyboards were off-center, so Sam walked out before the gig picked-up and moved the entire rack.\n\nHumble Pie rocked too. The drummer played part of the drum solo hitting his head against the symbols.\n\nJonathan Wyman\n\nJust for the record, that is Sam Judd in the black tee-shirt and shorts, off-stage on the left hand side of the photo.\n\nJonathan Bayer\n\nJune 24 81 - Hara Arena Dayton. I'm 100% sure it was Humble Pie opening up. I remember picking up a t-shirt - it was around the time of the Humble Pie album \"go for the throat\" - I looked up the album and recall my tshirt with the same design as the album...\n\nRalph\n\nThis gig confirmed on the WLS MusicRadio 89 page.\n\nTim Shockley\n\nBlue Oyster Cult 6/30/81 Poplar Creek, IL - the support was Humble Pie.\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\nOregon Jam '81\n\nTony Hepner\n\nOverall, this day ranks as the greatest concert I ever attended. The anticipation for this was huge, especially in Eugene, Oregon, where they had been trying for years to get an outdoor rock festival arranged. I guess the Grateful Dead had played there in the '70s, but the local police and politicians said no more after that one. By 1981, it was okay again.\n\nThat morning, my brother and two of my friends loaded into my 1967 Mustang, waxed for the occasion, and headed from Portland to Eugene. A beautiful sunny day. A great time to be 20 yrs old. We ripped down Interstate 5; it seemed like everyone in the state was going to Eugene. We parked in an area by the trees which is now where the new baseball stadium is. Free parking, too.\n\nThe opening act was good; the lead singer asked the audience if they thought his guitarist \"looks like Paul McCartney?\" to a lot of cheers. Everyone was in a great mood.\n\nThe fire hoses came out early. We were in the stands, and I remember just before BOC came out, that I wanted down on that field. Heart was the headliner and would close the show that night, but for me it was BOC who was the headliner.\n\nI managed to work my way down to the football field, about 30 yards from the stage, just to the right. There was an irrigation pipe on the ground going right thru the crowd to feed those hoses spraying the crowd. Hey, no problem, another 6 inches higher for me. So I climbed on that just before BOC hit the stage.\n\nMan, there I was, on the field, pumping my fist in the air with BOC banging out their stuff. Their sound was great !! Whoever set up the equipment and PA knew what they were doing. After BOC concluded and left the stage, I figuered they were done and was ready to go back up to the stands and find my friends. But nobody was moving off the field. See, this was only my 3rd concert, so I had forgotten about the encore. But here they came back out. BOC.\n\nWhat happened next was one of the greatest moments or experiences of my life.\n\nEric Bloom heads to the microphone, but the band has already started pumping out \"Roadhouse Blues\" by my favorite band of all-time, The Doors. Bloom steps to the mic and says, \"10 years ago today....Jim Morrison died in Paris, France....and we'd like to do a tribute to him !!\" Oh, my God, I fucking blew my mind right there. I began jumping up and down, and I swear I reached 26 feet in the air. It felt like it.\n\nThey started with Roadhouse Blues, then went into a Doors-style medley of their songs. Never missed a beat. It was over 100 degrees on that field with no shade, but I didn't give a shit. One of my favorite current bands laying it all down, all on the line, for The Doors.\n\nThe encore ended by returning to Roadhouse Blues. And then it was over. I headed back up to find my friends and brother like a conquering hero. They all knew how much I liked the Doors. I was talking trash the rest of the day. BOC just kicked ass.\n\n\"Heart\" closed and near the end of their show blew out the power. Some of the lights went out in the stadium, too. We waited around, then figuered they weren't going to get it fixed, so fuck it, we left. About a quarter of a mile from the stadium, heading to my car, the lights and power came back on inside, but it was short-lived. The power to the amps went out a 2nd time in mid-song right as we reached my car. I don't remember which song, but that's how Oregon Jam '81 ended.\n\nToday, 28+ years later, I can still feel that heat and see that day.\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\nDay on the Green Show\n\nXavier Russell\n\nAnother trip backstage for a pint or three, and a quick lig with Albert Bouchard, to find out just how many DOGs the Cult have played. As it turned out this is to be their sixth appearance at this annual bash. Blue Oyster Cult have been around a long time, near 12 years, and not many bands can boast an unchanged line up, which also explains why the Cult are one of the tightest acts on the road at the moment.\n\nOnly the suits have changed for this year. Don Roeser was wearing a gold shirt, which gleamed in the sun. Allen Lanier now favours a red and black (geddit) football jersey. Sadly no songs from 'Cultosaurus' were played.\n\nHowever, the new material came over very well, especially 'Burning for You' with great harmonising. Should be a top twenty hit single. 'Joan Crawford', meanwhile, is too tongue-in-cheek, and the sight of 40,000 mouths agape with disbelief over the lyrics had me in hysterics.\n\n\"We ain't played this one in the Bay Area for five years\" screamed Manny Bloom. It turned out to be 'Seven Screaming Dizbusters'. This is how all heavy metal should sound, great riffs accompanied by classy guitar solos from Buck Dharma.\n\nThe titanic 'Godzilla' followed, complete with synthesized drum solo, one of a few not so boring drum solos left. 'Born to be Wild' as usual was excellent, although, personally I'm becoming a little tired of the song, as is the same for the Cult's mainstay song, 'The Reaper'. The encore on the other hand was fab, 'Roadhouse Blues', the old Doors toon.\n\nSadly the stadium began to empty when Heart came on as I think BOC had no trouble in blowing the headliners off the stage, a pity coz the gorgeous Wilson sisters turned in a fine show.\n\nRalph\n\nHere's a review of this gig I came across on a Randy Rhoads site called \"The Day The Music Died\":\n\nThe fireworks may have gone off Saturday at the year's first Day on the Green at the Oakland Stadium, but the concert was a dud. Only 38,000 fans - less than two-thirds capacity - attended, and many left even before headliner Heart took the stage following an hour-long intermission.\n\nAfter a strong opening, Heart then bogged down in a lengthy middle section devoted to dreamy, folk-oriented material, as the crowd, primed to rock, began to stream the exits. Seven hours of hot sun and headbanger rock left the audience tired and restless by the time the afternoon's stars arrived on the scene.\n\nBy then, the sky had grown overcast and a cool breeze whipped around the cavernous stadium. Acts performed from a hole in the stage front, flanked by paintings of forest, birds and crashing waves that covered the massive sound system.\n\nFrom the sparsely populated third deck, musicians appeared to be less than an inch tall. During the performances, the almost entirely teenage audience sat listlessly in their seats, offering only cursory applause at the close of individual numbers, although enthusiastically demanding the regulation encores.\n\nBut, ear splitting music is only a small part of these annual summer time events. Rock bands just provide a central focus for the convocation. What these shows are really about is a day outside the purview of adult authority figures for the high schoolers.\n\nA Day on the Green has more in common with a day at the beach than with other rock concerts.\n\nMorning arrivals caught local rockers 415, Loverboy and Ozzy Osbourne, former lead vocalist of Black Sabbath, who reportedly drew quite a response from the heavy metal-minded crowd.\n\nGuitarist Pat Travers drilled the house with machine gun, staccato riffs, played with such velocity, it was difficult to separate the reverberations from the actual notes he played.\n\nBlue Oyster Cult, which appears tomorrow at the Old Waldorf under the pseudonym Soft White Underbelly, mixed considerable recent material of lesser interest with the fire-breathing rock band's standards such as \"Cities in Flame\" and \"Hot Rails to Hell.\"\n\nGuitarist Buck Dharma filled the sound with thrashing, driving solos, but the band's set never settled into a consistent charge.\n\nHeart brought the Tower of Power horn section along to liven things up, but by the time the brass joined the band, it was too little, too late, and the audience continued its exodus unabated toward the parking lots.\n\nHere are some links to a few of Larry Shorr's great BOC photos taken at this gig and which are available for order from his My Pix Rock site:\n\nEric 1\n\nEric 2\n\nEric 3\n\nEric 4\n\nSam Judd\n\nWe played that show late afternoon on the 4th, threw just instruments into vans and limos and booked for the SFO airport, flew to JFK in NY, lugged it all over to the Marine Air Terminal where our 2 (Cult Air Force as we called them) twin engine Navahos were waiting in the early morning mist, flew up to Clayton NY, rented cars and drove out to a Biker Fest/Picnic in the middle of nowhere and played a show with Chubby Checker, Jan & Dean & others on the 5th...\n\nCaught about 4hrs sleep and flew back to JFK, legged it all over to get on a commercial flight BACK to SFO, where we thankfully had a night off on the 6th before playing TWO shows the night of the 7th at The Old Waldorf in one of our rare (in those days) club appearances as \"Soft White Underbelly\"... ahh the memories... and lost brain cells...\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\n1000 Islands Festival\n\nBuck Dharma\n\nWe flew 'cross country and drove to make this gig that Sam called a \"Biker Gig in the Pasture\" - it was held in upstate NY near the childhood home of the Bouchard brothers.\n\nThen we turned around and flew back to California. Chubby was a nice guy, and drove his own tour bus!!\n\nJill Atwood\n\nI went to the 1,000 Islands Music Festival in 1981. The 'fest' grounds were essentially a muddy farm field surrounded by ditches in a moat-like configuration, a moderate size stage, a few vendors, alot of bikers and 2 porta potties. I don't recall too much about the 4 day event, other than our main purpose of going was to see Blue Oyster Cult.\n\nCan't say I remember seeing Chubby Checker there at all - it seemed like there was mainly a lot of local bands with plenty of down time between.\n\nAnyways, the crowd had thinned out by Sunday night when BOC finally went on - like 9 or 10 at night. I think they were the final act of the entire event.\n\nWe got down to the stage area early to get a good place to stand, and watched with interest as a bunch of guys dumped a large couch into the field from the back of a pick up truck. They came back and just sat on it, quietly drinking for the most part.\n\nOnce BOC went on, we pretty much forgot about them. Then, just after the opening chords of \"Cities on Flame\", there was a flurry of activity behind us. Seconds later, the couch was a complete inferno, with flames shooting 15 or 20 feet into the air! (Clearly some sort of accelerant was used). The show continued uninterrupted as the couch burned away.\n\nMarc Chauvette\n\nHi! I just wanted to tell ya that this was a show I played at. I sent some pics of BOC that I took from on stage that day to one of the Bouchard Brothers last year online. We played just before BOC in a band called \"Wirlwind.\" Before I played with Wirlwind that day, I also played guitar in a band called \"Contraband.\"\n\nI remember Chubby Checker driving his own bus up to the backstage. It got stuck in the mud. I believe this was the last day of the Fest. I also think this was the 2nd TI Music Fest that was held in Clayton. The 1st was more like Woodstock. The crowd was in the thousands. There were people walking around naked drinking alcohol and smoking pot, passing out pills.\n\nAnyway, about a month later I got a call from this guy in NYC. He told me that Chubby had heard me playing guitar with another band that day and wanted me to fly to audition for his band in NYC. I eventually ended up declining on the offer. Anyway, glad to have seen this. Thanks for the memories. I attached a couple photos of our band, and the backstage BOC snaps.\n\nThad Rosemyer\n\n2 of my friends attending this low budget Woodstockian type gig. They both confirmed Greg Kihn Band played as well.\n\nGreg cut the set short when some brainiac hit one of his band with a firecracker.\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\n2 Soft White Underbelly Shows at 8pm and 11pm\n\nScott E.

As with other shows during this time period, Johnny Van Zant Band opened and Pat Travers was in the middle.\n\nBOC didn't come on until midnight and played a massive 2 hour plus set. Show didn't get out till nearly 2.30 a.m. in the morning. I had 4th row center seats for this. Sorry, no setlist.\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\nGig with Steve Schenck on keys...\n\nJames DeWilde\n\nThe concert was Johnny Van Zant opening, Pat Travers and then BOC, and the venue was the Wichita Falls City Auditorium.

It had the band members as magicians (top hats, wands, etc).\n\nMy mom washed my ticket stub with the jeans I had on that day so I can't give you a date but it was in the summer because it was after I graduated High School in May.\n\nBert Gangl\n\nAccording to the fine folks at the Wichita Falls Public Library, the concert there took place on Wed Jul 15, 1981.\n\nJohnny Van Zant and Pat Travers were also mentioned in the review that appeared in the local paper after the show.\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\nSteve Schenck on keys\n\nRalph\n\nCheck out the stubs above - Pat Travers is down as headliner!! Also the second stub has \"Utopia?\" written on it - I'm assuming that's a mistake?\n\nMark Miller\n\nIn regard to the Dallas concert on 17 July 1981. That was my first rock concert, which was pretty impressive to a 13 year old, especially since my friend and I scored floor seats.\n\nThe concert did have Van Zant opening, then Travers, and the headline band was BOC of course.\n\nThe ticket stub that has marked on it Utopia was not entirely wrong. Seems Todd Rundgren was in town and they got him on stage also.\n\nThe highlight was Buck Dharma, Todd Rundgren and Pat Travers mixing it up on guitar.\n\nRalph\n\nThanks Mark - and you're right about Utopia being in town - they were playing The Dallas Agora Ballroom on July 18 and 19:\n\nTodd Rundgren Touring History\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\nTexxas Jam\n\nMike\n\nMy friends and I could not get tickets to the Texas Jam because it was sold out. We decided to try to sneak into the Astrodome. (Back-up plan: go to Galveston if we couldn't get in). We figured our chances were good because we used to work special events at the Dome.\n\nJust as we were making our break (we were actually inside the building but we hadn't cleared security) we could hear \"Godzilla\" playing. We out-ran the cops up the security stairwell and made it into the arena proper and ditched the cops by mixing in with the crowd. Godzilla was about half-way over by the time we had pulled it off.\n\nWhenever I hear Godzilla, it takes me back.\n\nRalph\n\nHere's a review from the 23 Jul 1981 edition of \"The North Texas Daily\":\n\nSpeedwagon steals shov/ at Texas festival\n\nRock 'n' rollers race to seats like 'cattle at feeding time' to savor jam\n\nby Steve Robinson, Daily Reporter\n\nConfusion reigned supreme at the Fourth annual Texxas World Music Festival in Houston Saturday as a capacity crowd of more than 66,000 danced, drank, smoked and fought its way through the nine-hour extravaganza.\n\nThe event is also known as the \"Texas Jam.\"\n\nNobody seemed to know where his seat was in the cavernous Astrodome, and the ushers were almost no help at all. The result was people sitting wherever they could find a place or not silting at all throughout the long day.\n\nCrowds of souvenir-hungry fans surrounded the T-shirt stands, blocking aisles and creating massive bottlenecks that made Central Expressway at rush hour seem like a deserted country road. The concession stands were also crowded with masses of humans impatiently waiting to pay 52 for a beer or hot dog.\n\nPeople were dressed in every conceivable manner, from T-shirts and shorts to karate suits. One woman sported a tatoo of a desert sunrise or sunset covering her back.\n\nThe festival scene was reminiscent of Mardi Gras, where confusion and getting lost in the crowd was half the fun. It was, indeed, a heyday for people-watchers.\n\nWhen the first chords rang out, everyone headed for his seat, the floor section looking like a thousand head of cattle at feeding time.\n\nThe Rockets, a heavy-metal band from Detroit, started the show with a lackluster set of music that could only be called noise by the kindest of critics. Their only salvation was the Fleetwood Mac tune, \"Oh Well,\" which brought a mild response from the still sober audience.\n\nThe disappointing start was forgotten when Blue Oyster Cult, from New York, brought the crowd to its feet several times with old reliable tunes, \"Godzilla\" and \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper.\" The group finished with a medley of songs from The Doors, and \"Born to be Wild,\" from Steppenwolf, both of which went over surprisingly well.\n\nThe crowd came to life when Foghat, a London-based band, \"shook the rafters\" with its traditional high-energy style. The band's sound system, however, was inadequate for the Astrodome and much of the power Foghat is famous for was lost somewhere between the first few rows of floor scats and the first balconv\n\nA parachute drape, which was supposed to enhance acoustics, never was put up resulting in loss of sound and The Cotton Bowl, where the last three Texxas World Music Festivals were held, definitely has better acoustics.\n\nEven with poor sound quality, Foghat pleased the crowd with \"Slow Ride\" and \"I Just Want to Make Love to You,\" and left the audience screaming for more when its hour-long set was finished.\n\nThe dull grey light from the skylights was giving way to darkness when R.E.O Speedwagon, the band that is drawing the largest crowds nationwide, took the stage amid thunderous applause. Kevin Cronin, lead vocalist, and Gary Richrath, lead guitarist, strutted and stomped around stage as they lead the group through cuts from their latest album, \"High Infidelity,\" along with provens crowd pleasers, \"Riding the Storm Out,\" \"157 Riverside Avenue,\" \"Only the Strong Survive,\" \"Back On the Road Again\" and \"Say You Love Me or Say Goodnight.\"\n\nRichrath showed he was the best guitar player of the evening with lightning-fast solos and hard-driving rhythm, which rang clear in the night, despite the poor sound system. After two hours of foot-stomping, hand-clapping rock 'n' roll and two encores, R.E.O. left.\n\nBy the time Heart, a Seattle-based band, appeared on stage, the concert was running one hour late. That, along with the obvious fact that most people came to see R.E.O. Speedwagon, resulted in about half the audience leaving after the first few Heart songs.\n\nThe band seemed to sense the audience's disinterest and gave a lackluster performance, which brought people to their feet only once or twice Heart received good response; on hard-hitting tunes, especially the Led Zeppelin song, \"Rock 'n' Roll.\" However, the audience was so tired by the end of the night that when Heart played some of their mellow tunes, the audience all but fell asleep.\n\nOverall, R.E.O. stole the show, as they usually do everywhere. The other bands were adequate, but could not overcome the accoustics barrier quite as well as R.E.O. did.\n\nNo matter, nobody expected the concert to sound like an album, and maybe nobody really wanted it to. Most people came to just be a part of the affair, to see and be seen, to escape from reality for a few hours. They would have had a great time if no bands at all showed up.\n\nNot a REO fan by any chance, are you, Steve...?\n\nRalph\n\nI only know about this gig as a result of the following review that appeared in the Thursday 23 Jul 1981 edition of the Tucson Citizen (courtesy of Ian Cassetty):\n\nBlue Oyster Cult - softer heavy metal\n\nby Chuck Graham, Citizen Entertainment Writer\n\nBlue Oyster Cult, the shortest band of rock 'n' rollers in show business, continues to expand its style of heavy metal with a romantic touch.\n\nLast night's show for approximately 4000 in the Community Center arena found this quintet less threatening, more melodic, than in the past. BOC has become the Sir Lancelot of rock's bombastic legions. Offering a pleasant demeanor and songs that are tuneful, BOC doesn't mind tossing the crowd a playful wink while on its way to Armageddon.\n\nThe laser show is conspicuously absent on this tour. However, playful lead guitarist Donald \"Buck Dharma\" Roeser delighted in the chance to catch the spotlight on his guitar and reflect the beams back into the audience.\n\nThere were also a couple of numbers during which the the band was covered with fog, and a joyfully anticipated appearance by the red-eyed, smoke breathing Godzilla. With its massive head hoisted up on the prongs of a fork lift, Godzilla peeked over the speaker stack while the BOC classic raged on stage below.\n\nSuch theatrics reached an apex with the show closing \"Born to Be Wild.\" Wearing stylish black leathers, lead singer Eric Bloom rode a massive motorcycle on stage, kicked off the song and kept it going as smoke once more engulfed both band and bike. The number concluded amidst showering fireworks that spewed from cannons on each side of the drum riser.\n\nIn terms of pure muscle, BOC didn't play a strong set. Molly Hatchet could beat up these guys several times a night and then stick them with the bar tab.\n\nBut musically it was pleasant enough. Not without charm in a mix of old and new songs that went back to \"Tyranny and Mutation\" while giving equal time to the sick joke controversy of \"Joan Crawford (Has Risen From The Grave)\" on the band's current album. If nothing else, BOC proves that heavy metal isn't always outrageous.\n\nThe Pat Travers Band, second on the bill, was most remarkable for the fact that Travers has returned to playing guitar at great length but with little effectiveness.\n\nCutting and slashing through several choruses at a time, he was forever stringing out boisterous blues distortions that fried the air without moving the crowd. It was a remarkable achievement that didn't improve until the final number, \"Boom Boom Out Go The lights.\" From there the trio took a brief offstage pause before shooting back out to do its encore, \"Snortin' Whiskey, Drinkin' Cocaine.\" That flurry of activity was as good as the set ever got.\n\nThis band used to be a quartet, with flash guitarist Pat Thrall hired to provide the thrilling jams while Travers sang the songs and comped along on piano. But Thrall left the band a while back to pursue a solo career. Travers decided to cut down the overhead by reducing his band to a trio and playing the guitar parts again himself.\n\nOpening this four-hour concert was Johnny Van Zant, presenting Southern rock in the Van Zant tradition. This band's show closer includes waving a large Confederate flag. It was the most exciting part of that set.\n\nRalph\n\nI know about the band line-up for this gig because I read a short ad in the 19 July 1981 issue of the LA Times which said: \"BOC with Special Guest star Pat Travers and Johnny Van Zant. Thursday July 23 8PM at the Swing Auditorium, San Bernadino.\"\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\nSummer Blowout\n\nSat 25 July\n\nTV Appearance: \"The Merv Griffin Show\"\n\nBOC appeared on \"The Merv Griffin Show\", which was the band's first national television appearance.\n\nThey mimed to two songs: \"Burnin' For You\" and \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\"\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\nRay Manzarek guested on keyboards\n\nGardner Trimble\n\nMy first show - It was BOC/Pat Travers/Johnny Van Zant.\n\nSet list included but not limited to (not in order, sorry):\n\nDr. Music (opener)\n\nETI\n\nVeteran Of The Psychic Wars\n\nJoan Crawford\n\nCities On Flame\n\nBorn To Be Wild\n\nGodzilla\n\nDFTR\n\nRoadhouse Blues\n\nAnd Ray Manzarek guested on Roadhouse Blues (Lanier played guitar, Manzarek played organ).\n\nTad Huggins\n\nI was at this show. The opening band was the Johnny Van Zant Band.\n\nI remember 7 Screaming Diz Busters and Eric Bloom cutting his wrist with a knife, blood spewing everywhere. He was talking about signing in blood and having Porches in his driveway. It was a cool show and we were right in front.\n\nRalph\n\nI got a confirmation of this date at this bootleg site:\n\nwww.concerts-db.com\n\nIt's listing on the site would indicate it had been recorded, but no details are given, so it's strange. However, they do provide the date and confirm the support act, so there's that at least.\n\nRalph\n\nI know about this gig because I read a review in the 30 July 1981 issue of the Deseret News. The reviewer found fault with the volume of the show and wondered why BOC seemed intent on \"rattling the rafters\"...\n\nI was especially pleased to learn about this gig because for a few years now I've had two \"help me nail this gig\" requests down at the foot of this page.\n\nThe first was from the official site which merely hinted at a gig on this date at an unknown venue in an unknown town. That was always going to be a hard one to sort out...\n\nThe second concerned a gig mentioned in a UFO interview I once read which alluded to a gig UFO had played with BOC in Salt Lake City, and as I didn't have one listed, it was obviously a \"new gig\" for me to discover...\n\nWho'd have thought that these were both one and the same gig!!\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\n\"Heart's Rock'n'Roll Weekend\" Show 1\n\nMark Carscadden\n\nI was at this show. The western Canadian dates were actually promoted as \"Canada Jam II\".\n\nIt was at the football stadium, and it was packed. I believe it was sold out, probably 30,000 plus.\n\nIt was a beautiful sunny hot Saturday, 90 F plus for sure.\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\n\"Heart's Rock'n'Roll Weekend\" Show 2\n\nRalph\n\nThe 31 Jul 1981 edition of The Vancouver Sun gave the following timings for this show:\n\nSUMMER SUNDAY '81: Here's the timetable for Sunday's concert at Empire Stadium: doors open at 11.30 a.m., Rockets (1:30 p.m.), Blue Oyster Cult (3 p.m.), Ted Nugent (4:30 p.m.), Loverboy (6 p.m.) and Heart (8 p.m.)...\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\n\"Heart's Rock'n'Roll Weekend\" Show 3\n\nBuck Dharma guested on Heart's encore of \"Rock'n'Roll\" with Ted Nugent and Paul Dean\n\nNeil Boyle\n\nThis all-day concert was billed as \"Rock Cirkus II\", sponsored by Edmonton radio station K-97 (97.3).\n\nThe venue is a natural grass football stadium that held about 65,000 (when you had people on the field). I don't know what the crowd size was, but it was large, 10,000's (I can recall it took about 1/2 hour to get from the stage area to a washroom and back!!!!!).\n\nI was most excited to see BOC and Ted Nugent and both rocked hard. I enjoy the Hearts older stuff, but after hearing the other bands, their set was more mellow and, I hate to admit it, but I left part way through their closing set.\n\nLoverboy had just put out their 2nd album, and were already huge in Canada, which explains why they came on after BOC, who were also huge internationally at that point.\n\nMark Donaghue\n\nThis was called World Festival of Rock I believe? It is too bad that Neil left because some Rocket came out with Ted Nugent, Paul Dean and Buck and played Led Zep's RocknRoll for an encore. It was one of those \"moments\"\n\nTed stole the show of course but I think all had fun. BOC had some great fans there !! LoverBoy was a rising star but it all added up to a Really Big Show!!\n\nBOC were selling these really cool Tshirts. I had mine for years !! I do not recall the songset either.\n\nNew Wave\n\nI was a roadie for the band \"The Rockets\" and worked many shows with BOC as an opening act...\n\nIn August 81, we did 3 shows with BOC, Ted, LoverBoy and Heart in Canada. I'm sure you know this, but what you might not know is that the whole 3 days were filmed - they filmed everybody with the bands and crews for 3 straight days, in hotels, eating, sitting up, flying and the shows themselves...\n\nThey said they were doing a documentary, but till this day I have never seen any footage...\n\nSam Judd\n\nI remember the tour VERY well especially the flights on the chartered 727 and the C-130 cargo plane that the gear went via... never saw ANY evidence of any filming either of the shows or the crews...\n\nNew Wave\n\nI can positively say that it was filmed. I ran into the Heart sisters at a show about 8 years ago and mentioned the film, and they remembered it, but didn't know what happened to it.\n\nAt the time I was more of a body guard / bus driver for the Rockets - we had drummer Jonny \"B\" (formally of Mitch Ryder and played with many other musicians) and I would take care of Jimmy McCarty's guitars on stage (he played with Mitch Ryder, Jimi Hendrix and Cactus) - but I wasn't too involved with the set-up because I was babysitting...\n\nWe were almost taken off the play bill because they thought we wouldn't be able to get all the band gear on the plane but somehow they managed and we flew to the next cities...\n\nCan you imagine 5 bands and 5 crews altogether on one plane? I think Ted was the only one not doing drugs on the fold down tables - we drove the stewardess crazy with the serving of liquor, they ran out of change so they started to give it out free....\n\nThe next plane ride they wouldn't serve any alcohol and brought on a belly dancer instead, I felt sorry for her...\n\nThe plane rides were like they were right out of animal house... I remember when the stewardess did the demo of the oxygen mask dropping, everybody held up there shoes, held on to the laces and dropped the shoe - yea I know pretty childish, but it was funny at the time...\n\nOn your site, it mentioned that a radio station had put this on, maybe they have the film... at the time it was a very big deal, 3 huge stadium shows in a row, I remember them filming in the hotels, planes and at the shows - it's very amazing that it hasn't shown up anywhere with everything you see now days on the telly...\n\nAs far as working with BOC, at my best guess, I would say I've worked with them at a hundred shows (around) mostly with the Rockets and I think I did some shows with them when I worked for WinterLand Productions (12 years) as a Merchandise guy...\n\nBeing 5'8 tall, I liked them because none of them were taller than me... Just kidding...\n\nThey were great guys, spent a lot of time with them, in fact, I remember being in a limo with them in Vancouver, to the hotel from the plane I think, and we came to the conclusion that Vancouver had the best looking hookers in the world, we didn't stop but just an observation...\n\nIf you track down the film I would love to see it / maybe they had to cut to much out / not enough left... lol...\n\nSam Judd\n\nThere definitely wasn't anyone filming me... I rarely give permission for that sort of thing...\n\nBut really, there COULD have been film crews there... cause honestly I don't even remember Rockets BEING on those shows!!... but for there to have been QUALITY audio for the performance part, I would have HAD TO KNOW about that as there were differences in the way instruments were miked up and especially keyboards taken at line level for the multi-track recording that HAS to take place for quality audio.. otherwise you end up with rancid dawg shit for audio like the live 76 bunch o crap...\n\nMy favorite memories from that crazy deal were our pyro guy getting busted for hashish coming it to Canada (we didn't even notice he was missing till R Downey got a call from the authorities!!.. we were already having dinner at the hotel...\n\nThen all the fun on those plane flights (including when I took over the paging mike at the gate and clandestinely paged the aforementioned Pyro guy to report to the RCMP precinct in the main terminal... lolololol) and going out for a big dinner at a Jap steak house at the end of the tour and having Ted Nugent pick up the tab!!... he even bought us some champagne too...\n\nRalph\n\nThe 24 Oct 1981 edition of the Ellensburg Daily Record mentioned that BOC and The Rockets were on this bill. It didn't say that there weren't any other bands on the bill, although that was the impression you got...\n\nPaul Wolfe\n\nThis was my first concert... opening acts were the Johnny Van Zant Band and the Rockets.\n\nBOC opened with Dr. Music and ended with Roadhouse blues featuring hometown boys Mike DeRosier, Howard Leese and Steve Fossen of Heart onstage with them.\n\nAs I recall, the rest of the set pretty well followed Extraterrestrial Live set list. I don't recall the drum solo relying on electronic drums like that record, however...\n\nThere was an article in the Seattle Times a couple weeks later condemning concerts for being \"too loud\" and referenced this show as being 120 dB. It was definitely LOUD.\n\nThis was an amazing first concert. I've seen BOC a couple of times since in club level gigs and it's just not the same as seeing the original band at the top of their game.\n\nShane Austermuhl\n\nYou're missing an Anchorage date from 1981 (Aug 8th) - they played at the West High Auditorium.\n\nIt was a big thing. I remember I was only 10 and really wanted to go because I liked burnin' for you along with Godzilla... I was really just getting into bands of BOC's genre thanks to my brother and Dad.\n\nHere is a funny story. About a week before the gig there was an ad in the Periodical about renting a particular (model, cc) \"Harley\" for one evening. It was not to be drove. Just to be observed.\n\nOne of the particular lads that I know that went to the gig said there was a Harley there that matched the bike wanted in the ad. Needless to say the venue was my High School. We did not have an \"arena\" here yet.\n\nTed Nugent, Molly Hatchett, Ozzy, Nazareth, Pat Travers all had played there circa '82-'84... I was able to see Hatchett, Nazareth, Travers and Oz... but no BOC!...\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\n2 shows at 3.30pm & 7.30pm\n\nShane Austermuhl\n\nAfter some research at the local library I came across a brilliant review of the West Anchorage High gigs. There was actually 3 shows. Saturday August 8th at 8pm, 1981. It was sold out though in no time.\n\nNorthern Stage Productions (which are no longer around unfortunately) in Association with Albatross Productions brought BOC up here for the very first time.\n\nThey added a second show on Sunday August 9th at 8pm, however that sold out as well. West auditorium is a lovely little venue where I have been for other shows, and any seat in the house is good. It holds 2,000.\n\nBy overwhelming response of the fans they added a 3rd show for Sunday at 3pm. A local band by the name of Tytus Canby opened each show with a 30 min set. From the review of the Sunday afternoon show the Cult played 2 hours.\n\nThey brought up their own sound system as well as only a third of their stage set due to the venue.\n\nAfter the afternoon show the Cult indulged in catering of Alaska King Crab and potatoes. This was the last perfomances with Albert behind the drum kit on U.S. soil.\n\nRalph\n\nCheck out the above stub - as the only Tuesday to fall on the 11th in 1981 was in August (thank you, Sam), then this would appear to be from a Portland gig on 11 August. Plus, it's torn, which indicates that the gig occurred.\n\nThis - if true - is interesting because it'd represent the last known US gig with Albert before the ill-fated Euro trip. I'd always thought previously that the two Alaskan High School gigs mentioned above were Albert's last US shows.\n\nSo - the question is - did BOC head back to Portland to do a gig there before heading off to Europe - this stub suggests they did...\n\nSam Judd\n\nWell, I had thought that I remembered Seattle as being the last stateside show before Euro, but I've just had a flash memory last night of all of us arriving at the Benson Hotel in Portland from possibly Alaska...\n\nI know it was from somewhere we flew to, as no Bus and I remember Rich Neesin was band valet (that makes it 1981) and was to make sure everyones luggage went up to their rooms and mine got left in the lobby and the front desk man just happened to see some guy try to leg it out of there with my suitcase...\n\nBut yes, it's very possible we went to Portland from Alaska... but my strongest memory of this time is that Rick Downey had designed a \" Stage Set\" of ramps and risers and pipe and drape to hide the amp-line... very cheesy and un BOC like... the band hated it... the crew REALLY hated it as it made a LOT of extra work for us...\n\nFirst time we saw it was Seattle, next time we saw it was Lubbock (on 2nd Sept - after Europe - at the start of the Foghat tour)... so we either didn't try to use it at all in Portland, or the Portland gig was before Seattle...\n\nBill Dant\n\nI saw the August 11th, 1981 show at the Paramount Theater in Portland. I couldn't believe they were playing there again, and so soon after playing in Eugene at Oregon Jam the previous month.\n\nThey opened with The Red and The Black, and Albert broke his snare head. I remember the drum tech coming out to replace it, and Albert patting him on the head!\n\nIt was a great show, including the extended guitar solo versions of Veteran of the Psychic Wars and Heavy Metal Black & Silver. I believe Roadhouse Blues/Love Me Two Times was the final encore. I'd kill for a recording of that show. I had no idea at the time that I was seeing one of Albert's last shows.\n\np.s. If I remember correctly, the opening act was Johnnie Van Zandt?\n\nWraxallman\n\nI was at the first of those German shows in 1981 (while Albert was still drumming). Capt Von Ondine posted a really excellent pic of the Stuttgart show last year. I have it somewhere - I'll try and dig it out. He said he had others but hasn't posted any more since.\n\nThe gig. Great gig! My first outdoor festival. Kansas - Blackfoot - Iron Maiden (Killers) - Motorhead - BOC and Foreigner (who were headlining and better than I though they were going to be!) Me an impoverished student, barely scraped the cash together to go the gig and have some beer and train money. I remember the merchandise being stupidly expensive but really wanted that t-shirt. It was going to be either the T-shirt or the train and the train won. Bloody hot day so the beer money was essential. I got a nice sunburn that day and I still had hair so it was hat free.\n\nGreg Jones\n\nI was at the Golden Summer night concert in Stuttgart with several Army buddies. Hotter than hell that day and lines for beer were awful.\n\nHad a hell of a time. Wore the t shirt until it literally fell apart. Would kill to have another. Oh, well.\n\nEric Manner\n\nThis was the first \"real\" concert I ever went to. I was stationed in Goeppingen, Germany, at Cooke Bks. our Rec Center provided a bus to the event because they sold a lot of tix to the soldiers and their families who lived there. We were about 40 km from the location.\n\nWhen I went, I was not a big fan of any group, but had listened to some of their songs on the radio. I probably knew Foreigner the best and their song \"Urgent\" had just been released in June. That is what they closed the show with in their encore.\n\nThe concert was \"totally devestating\". It was sooo great! Even though I enjoyed it as much as I did, it hasn't been until these last 10 years or so that I started to appreciate it. I wish I could have embraced it then, like I do now, and the artists that performed. As hot as it was, it did allow for some sweet \"eye candy\". Sometimes you got to take the bad with the good.\n\nOf the 9 1/2 years I spent in Germany, on 3 different assignments, this will always be one of those \"top ten\" moments.\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\nThe 4th Golden Summernight Concert\n\nAlan Bleiweiss\n\nI was at that show - I was in the US Army, stationed in Wurzburg. It's been so long yet I've never been to a more intense and enjoyable concert experience - all day, all night! I had remembered Foreigner, BOC, 38 Special, and Kansas but couldn't remember any of the other bands, though Iron Maiden had been nagging my brain as a possibility!\n\nI distinctly remember coming in on one of the gazillion buses, and walking forever into the stadium. Being in that stadium - one with so much history to it, was surreal to me.\n\nMy memory still retains brief moments throughout the entire day. I remember there being at least two stages side by side - were there three? It was a great summer experience with women in bikinis, everyone caught up in the great music - the sun shining...\n\nThank you for having posted the info on the BOC web site. I really loved seeing the ticket scan...\n\nRalf Gimbel\n\nIn 16th august 1981 (Nuremberg) the songlist is pretty much the same as in Stuttgart, 15th.\n\nFor sure I only know following things:\n\nThe second song was ETI\n\nthe fourth song was Cities On Flame\n\nand the last songs were Godzilla, with a very long drum solo (it felt for 10 minutes), bass solo, Born To Be Wild, The Reaper, Roadhouse Blues.\n\nthere was no 5 Guitars (who could forget about that)\n\nthey also certainly played Hot Rails, because Joe had lead vocals in one song\n\nTo explain you, at that time I didn't know BOC. But after the concert I was a fan.\n\nJeffrey D. Fisher\n\nI saw Blue Oyster Cult at the 4th Golden Summernight Concert at the Zeppelinfeld in Nürnberg, Germany in Summer 1981. I have a ticket stub somewhere, though, I have not seen the stub in years. I have several ticket stubs from concerts in Germany.\n\nI don't recall any sort of conflicts or tension between the band members. I do recall that most of the audience was asleep; it was a hot day and in the afternoon of an all day concert.\n\nI was standing right in front of the stage, mostly alone, watching and listening to the band play. The lead guitarist was looking at me and indicated the audience. I just shrugged and mouthed \"I like it\". He smiled and kept playing. It was a memorable experience for me. I was stationed in Germany (Augsburg) with the US Army.\n\nHarold Sultzbaugh\n\nBOC played a killer show that day. The running order for the bands that day:\n\nMore\n\nBlackfoot\n\n.38 Special\n\nIron Maiden\n\nMotorhead\n\nKansas\n\nBlue Oyster Cult\n\nForeigner\n\nI was in the US Army stationed at Herzo Artillery Base. Good times.\n\nMartin Giles\n\nJust wondering if you remember someone putting a mega big British flag over Hitlers balcony at the 4th summer night concert. That someone was me and I have been trying to find any pictures of it...\n\nI have some great memories of that concert. I was at the 3rd Concert as well...\n\nBuck Dharma\n\nI think that was the Nuremburg concert I looked out our backstage trailer and saw Steve Walsh of Kansas doing situps with a 25 lb. barbell plate on his chest before Kansas' appearance.\n\nSteve was quite the acrobat onstage those days, doing handstands on the Hammond organ while he played and sang.\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\nSoft White Underbelly gig\n\nAlbert late - Rick Downey drummed 4 songs\n\nSam Judd\n\nThis was the first gig Al was late for... we went round the corner for a bite of food (quickly as we were late getting there) and returned to find Rick warming up to go on in place of him... it's still a hoot at that point... Rick's Big Nite as it were (I had mine once when George didn't show up and I got to mix the band...Yeee-Hawww!)\n\nAl showed up a few songs into the show and all had a good laugh... the next time it wasn't as funny...\n\nThe ride back to London was interesting as the Van that the crew (and Mr Rock Star Downey) was riding in smacked a curbing and lampost just south of town and did the front windscreen and whacked the alignment silly on the front wheels...\n\nWe pressed on (it was luckily summer) till the poxy thing ran out of petrol on the side of the road at the end of the runway of RAF Lakenheath...\n\nThose F-111's eliminated any sleep we might have gotten waiting for someone to get some more... finally a long walk was completed and we were on our way again...\n\nAll well until just north of the old North Weald fighter command base (can you tell I'm into military stuff???... I navigate in Europe by military installations..) - at this point both front tires blew and we called Taxis on the emergency phone and left the van by the side of the road...\n\nAhh the glory of Rock'n'Roll...\n\nGeoff Barrett\n\nI was there. I didn't fancy going to Donington but went to the 3 warm up dates [Dunstable and London, The Venue being the other two].I don't remember much about the gig except of course Albert arrived late.\n\nI do remember before the concert started Buck came out in casual gear and strummed [very quietly] the opening chords to 'ETI', presumably a last minute sound check. After a few seconds a half-hearted cheer went up as fans recognised him.\n\nI hadn't seen the band too many times before West Runton but enjoyed it immensely, particularly as it was a small venue. I can remember the London gig was much poorer in comparison as Buck seemed to be in a bad mood. First and only time!\n\nAlex Coulthard\n\nYes I went to this one, having persuaded my parents to take a summer holiday in East Anglia so that I could see them. I remember opening 'Sounds' magazine one week and discovering to my delight that that BOC were going to be playing there as a warm-up for their Donnington appearance under their pseudonym Soft White Underbelly. This was intensely exciting as I was 18 at the time and probably at the peak of my BOC-obsession.\n\nI'd seen them for the first time a couple of years previously on the Mirrors tour at Queens Hall, Leeds. I remember that occasion as being absolutely seminal - even though the venue in Leeds was a converted tram-shed the sound was awful.\n\nAnyway I remember arriving in West Runton the day before the gig (I think) and quickly did a recce of the village, which didn't take long. We were staying in a B&B just over the road from the venue. I remember on the big day hanging about in the pub next to the venue chatting to the roadies with a mounting level of excitement. Started queing at about 6pm ish I think - no-one else there seemed to be much older than me (what is it about BOC that seemed to appeal to teenage boys so specifically)?\n\nAnyway the gig itelf I don't remember too many specifics of. I was right at the front and it was seriously loud. The first thing I noticed was that Albert Bouchard appeared to have undergone a dramatic transformation - so much so that it was no longer Albert Bouchard! His stand-in sounded pretty good for about four numbers, after which everything ground to a halt. Eric Bloom & Buck Dharma started chatting to themselves quietly on stage as though it were a practice session - this was surreal. After what seemed like several minutes Albert took his seat and the gig resumed.\n\nOf the songs performed I remember Dr Music, Burnin for You and Roadhouse Blues as being great live - the other numbers have become blurred in my memory. I cherished a couple of BOC plectrums that I managed to grab hold of at the gig. Marvellous stuff.\n\nI saw BOC on a couple of later occasions later in 80s - at Birmingham in '84, and London in '85. By this time I think the band were in decline and the gigs were a relative disappointment.\n\nPostscript: I revisited West Runton a couple of years ago and was saddened to discover that the Pavillion is no more - it is now a car park!\n\nSteve Andrews\n\nYes I was there and what a GIG. I had only got into BOC about a year before with a copy of Tyranny I swapped with a mate and nearly wore it up.\n\nWe couldn't believe it when eagerly scanning Runtons gig list and there was Soft White Underbelly, the year before we had seen Ozzy with what I believe was his first Blizzard of Oz date and now a chance to see BOC well I still get a buzz from it today.\n\nI was fifteen and mad about bands and gigs I went to School at Wroxham just a short train journey away from the Pavilion and school day gigs were great, we all use to tell our parents that our mates Dad was taking us to the gig and arrange for one of them to pick us up. Then bunk off for the day get the train from Wroxham station and head to the Village Inn at West Runton to get into the spirit etc of things, this usually was followed by a good pratting about on the beach then making sure of staking claim to the position of the head of the cue and dig in for the door opening.\n\nSometimes we even helped out with humping some gear for the bands, I regret never taking a camera but I think the combination of everything being drunk & smoked leading to many dubious situations I doubt any camera would have survived.\n\nSaying all that I can't remember how I got to the BOC gig, but we were at the head of the cue with all senses in tact, wasn't going miss out on this one.\n\nI was surprised at the set list on the web page thought they did more than fourteen numbers but saying that from what I can remember the songs were all full or extended versions and I wasn't disappointed with the selection.\n\nI remember getting a couple of Buck's personalised plectrums, very impressive, which with much regret I have lost and if my memory serves me well a can of breaker lager Eric drunk from, this last item is also not in my possession (I'm not that sad yet) but sad enough to still have one of the Drums sticks Albert launched into the crowd, I think in Godzilla, always remember the story about it being one of his last gigs.\n\nI have a memory rightly or wrongly of Buck playing a solo and finishing with breaking one by one the strings on his guitar as he finished, or did I imagine it! We were at the front all the way through the gig and to say it was awesome is a understatement.\n\nFunnily enough I had a nostalgic trip the other night after seeing Ozzy on TOTP2 and dug out a few old singles and albums and found tucked in the Crazy Train single sleeve Blizzard of Oz autographs including the departed Randy Rhodes, and you comment about meeting the band made me think, we usually did meet them at great effort but I don't know why we didn't with BOC! there ya go.\n\nI also found an old list of the gigs I made at the time, and by the time I left School in 82 I'd seen getting onto 40 bands some who disappeared without trace some who went onto big things and a few that stood out like this one, it was great to find this web-site and especially this page (the pictures were a bonus) bringing back some great memories of the hallowed places of West Runton Inn and Pavilion.\n\nDavid Dukes\n\nI remember the gig well and have some dodgy photos of the gig itself. There were 6 of us all aged about 19, who came up from Norwich and spent the day on the beach in eager anticipation. Cameron Self, Simon Rumsey, Paul Tremlin and myself who were all BOC devotees since around 1978 and we were joined by Nick Clements and John Grayling who I doubt had ever heard of them! Certainly I don't think they would admit they were even there now, but I have the photos!\n\nI remember playing all the BOC albums on an ancient tape player over and over on the beach, much to the annoyance of the nearby families. We were certainly getting ourselves in the mood.\n\nBOC playing this little venue in a small seaside village in North Norfolk was not such a surprise as some really top bands have played there over the years, and at Cromer Links down the road. I saw Gillan, Motorhead, Stiff Little Fingers, Def leppard, Saxon and the Damned there for eg. We therefore expected a big crowd and remember hanging around the Village Inn to make sure we got in. The Adnams was pretty tasty and we all had loads of chips! However, we needn't have worried as I reckon the venue was no more than 1/2 full. Most of those I told about the gig later said they hadn't believed me!\n\nI recall hoping to bump into the band before the gig but we never got a glimpse. I reckon we went into the venue too soon.\n\nThe description of the gig itself has been well documented and I recall shouting out in unison with about 5 others \"Where's Albert\" (and I remember one plank shouting \"Where's Joe\" until he realized he'd chosen the wrong name!) However, there was no acknowledgement from Eric or Buck that anything was amiss. I do recall that when Albert did appear he didn't seem too enamoured with the stand-in and appeared to shove him aside, but maybe I imagined it.\n\nFinal memory was that it was all over too soon and we were heading back down the A140 full of great memories of what was a great gig. Shame about the next time we saw them at Donington. Standing in the constant drizzle with a Robin's Records bag over my head, dodging flying burgers and being underwhelmed by More, Blackfoot and Slade before being even more so by BOC and Whitesnake. AC/DC were a class act though and made the 3 hour wait to get out of the car park worth while.\n\nWe were wet and cold, but I was wetter the following year for the Genesis gig at Milton Keynes. That was to be my last ever open air gig. I vowed never to go again, but finally cracked and watched Peter Gabriel in summer 07 - again in a monsoon. Never Again!\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\nSoft White Underbelly gig\n\nRalph\n\nI originally found a listing for this gig in the Saturday, 18 Jul 1981 edition of the \"Evening Post\":\n\nPsst. Want to See a Big Band in Reading?\n\nOne of the bigest rock gigs Reading has known takes place next month - but don't tell anyone...!\n\nBlue Oyster Cult, a huge name in the States and throughout Europe, bring their particular brand of heavy metal to Reading on August 19, but you are not supposed to know.\n\nThe gig is at the Top Rank, but the band are not being billed as the Cult. They are advertised under the name of Soft White Underbelly.\n\nIt's all to do with contractual clauses. You see, BOC are due to play the Donington rock festival on August 22 and apparently, they are not allowed to be advertised as a competing draw anywhere else in the days preceding the event.\n\nBut Kevin Heaton of the promoter Quicksilver says with a smile that if people realise Soft White Underbelly is really Blue Oyster Cult, he won't mind.\n\nThe gig will also be a big break for local band After Dark, who are scheduled to support the Cult, in front of possibly 2,000 punters.\n\nMeanwhile, Blue Oyster Cult's new album, Fire of Unknown Origin, has just been released.\n\nThe promoter said it himself: \"they are not allowed to be advertised as a competing draw anywhere else in the days preceding the event,\" yet here he was promoting the Reading gig - off-handedly, perhaps, but self-evidently, nevertheless - as a \"BOC\" gig...\n\nIs it any wonder, then, that the Saturday, 8th Aug issue of the \"Evening Post\" brought the following bad news:\n\nThe Blue Oyster Cult - sorry, Soft White Underbelly - gig at Reading's Top Rank on August 19 has been cancelled.\n\nIt appears the band wanted to perform some warm-up gigs to the Donington rock festival, but has now been booked into The Venue in London, instead of Reading.\n\nObviously, we don't know that the promoter's loose lips sank this particular ship, but I'm sure it wouldn't have helped...\n\nQuick Gig Facts\n\nSoft White Underbelly gig\n\nRalph\n\nI originally found a review of this gig in the Friday, 21 Aug 1981 edition of \"The Daily Telegraph\":\n\nSoft White Underbelly\n\nBy John Coldstream\n\nAlthough at least one music journal had let the cat out of the bag, there was still just enough room to manipulate an earplug in the Venue when Blue Oyster Cult, one of the more spectacularly brutal Transatlantic combos, reverted to its 1971 name for a \"low profile\" prelude to the inevitable mayhem of Saturday's \"Monsters of Rock\" concert at Castle Donington.\n\nThe principle is admirable. Devotees see their idols in comparatively intimate surroundings without a thick grey line of bouncers making the gulf between audience and performer seem even wider than it always is at the more lucrative large-scale shows. Likewise the group if it has not forgotten how can relax a little delve among the mothballs and perhaps recall some of the sweat tears and motorway catering of yesteryear.\n\nMore is the pity, then, that the Underbelly should have treated the evening so pretentiously.\n\nFrom the instant their arrival was announced \"from New York City\" they might as well have been up on the lofty outdoor platform which awaits them at the weekend. Certainly the amplifiers will need little adjustment or this foundation-trembling 95 minutes, measuring at least 8 on the Richter Scale, may well have shaken snow off the Alpine peaks being scaled by Miss Petula Clark and her von Trapps down the road at the Apollo.\n\nOnly when thev settled for simplicity, as in the Steppenwolf classic \"Born to be Wild,\" did lead vocalist Eric Bloom and his four colleagues hint at a party spirit. Even \"Joan Crawford\" on record a dramatic piece with apt soundtrack effects fr"
