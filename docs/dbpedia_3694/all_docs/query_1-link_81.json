        "text": "The roll that country star Jelly Roll is on will make itself felt in arenas in the late summer and fall of 2024, as the singer has laid out an itinerary that has him headlining big-sized halls in 37 U.S. cities over a two-month period.\n\nThe “Beautifully Broken” tour starts Aug. 27 at Salt Lake City’s Delta Center and wraps up Oct. 27 at Charlotte’s Spectrum Center. In-between, he’ll be playing east cost venues including Madison Square Garden in New York (Sept. 27), Prudential Center in Newark (Sept. 29) and TD Garden in Boston (Sept. 26). On the west coast, performances include shows at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles (Sept. 6) and Honda Center in Anaheim (Sept. 7).\n\nThe singer will also be visiting arenas in Washington, D.C., Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Orlando, New Orleans, Atlanta, Chicago, Seattle and St. Louis, among other major cities.\n\nWarren Zeiders and Alexandra Kay are listed as opening acts for the run of shows.\n\nPresales for the Live Nation-promoted begin on Monday — including an early shot at tickets for Citi cardholders — and continue through next week before a general onsale March 1 at 10 a.m. local time. Ticketing links can be found at jellyroll615.com.\n\nKnoxville is the closest city in the current routing to his hometown, Nashville, where he made an impression headlining the Bridgestone Arena in December 2022 while his star was still on the rise. In any case, given the current overwhelming demand for Jelly Roll, it would be surprising if these were the only dates he posted this year.\n\nAlthough this will be Jelly Roll’s first all-arenas tour, he had a good chance to become accustomed to them on his 2023 “Backroad Baptism” tour, which found him playing a mixture of amphitheaters and arenas, with almost entirely different routing than he has scheduled for 2024. He hasn’t had much cause to play modest venues since his albums “Ballads of the Broken” (2022) and “Whitsett Chapel” (2023) elevated him to the ranks of country superstar, in a career that started in the realm of hip-hop in the 2000s and 2010s.\n\nJelly Roll was nominated for best new artist at the Grammys and, just this week, was named favorite male country singer at the People’s Choice Awards.\n\nJelly Roll’s 2024 tour dates:\n\nTue Aug 27 – Salt Lake City, UT – Delta Center\n\nWed Aug 28 – Nampa, ID – Ford Idaho Center\n\nFri Aug 30 – Spokane, WA – Spokane Arena\n\nSat Aug 31 – Seattle, WA – Climate Pledge Arena\n\nSun Sep 1 – Portland, OR – Moda Center\n\nTue Sep 3 – San Jose, CA – SAP Center\n\nWed Sep 4 – Sacramento, CA – Golden 1 Center\n\nFri Sep 6 – Los Angeles, CA – Crypto.com Arena\n\nSat Sep 7 – Anaheim, CA – Honda Center\n\nMon Sep 9 – El Paso, TX – Don Haskins Center\n\nWed Sep 11 – San Antonio, TX – Frost Bank Center\n\nFri Sep 13 – Lafayette, LA – CAJUNDOME\n\nSat Sep 14 – New Orleans, LA – Smoothie King Center\n\nTue Sep 17 – Orlando, FL – Kia Center\n\nThu Sep 19 – Charleston, SC – North Charleston Coliseum\n\nFri Sep 20 – Raleigh, NC – PNC Arena\n\nSat Sep 21 – Washington, DC – Capital One Arena\n\nTue Sep 24 – Albany, NY – MVP Arena\n\nThu Sep 26 – Boston, MA – TD Garden\n\nFri Sep 27 – New York, NY – Madison Square Garden\n\nSat Sep 28 – Belmont Park, NY – UBS Arena\n\nSun Sep 29 – Newark, NJ – Prudential Center\n\nTue Oct 1 – State College, PA – Bryce Jordan Center\n\nWed Oct 2 – Philadelphia, PA – Wells Fargo Center\n\nSat Oct 5 – Pittsburgh, PA – PPG Paints Arena\n\nSun Oct 6 – Buffalo, NY – KeyBank Center\n\nWed Oct 9 – Columbus, OH – Nationwide Arena\n\nFri Oct 11 – Chicago, IL – United Center\n\nSat Oct 12 – Louisville, KY – KFC Yum!
