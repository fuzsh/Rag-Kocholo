        "text": "Each fall semester, the Gonzaga oarsmen and coxswains descend on their primary boathouse and water-training facility, the Charlotte Y. Martin Boathouse. This boathouse is situated just above the Upriver Dam on the Spokane River and is privately accessed by only the men's and women's rowing programs at Gonzaga. Once there, the team has 6,800 meters of undisturbed water up to the top of the river, and the same amount back to the boathouse. They compete with no other rowing teams or water traffic allowing for productive and uninterrupted strokes on the Spokane River. Additionally the river is extremely protected from wind and choppy water, making \"bad-water\" days virtually non-existent.\n\nThe boathouse is a short 12 minute drive east of the Gonzaga University campus. Typically, the team is able to make the most of this facility and the river until late February.\n\nDIRECTIONS TO THE GONZAGA BOATHOUSE\n\nPhysical Address:\n\n7200 E.
