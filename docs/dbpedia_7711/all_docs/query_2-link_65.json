        "text": "Thank the Beatles for \"Madagascar.\"\n\nTom McGrath, co-director of the new animated DreamWorks comedy about a quartet of zoo animals that wind up on the Indian Ocean island, had been developing an altogether different project. Along with \"Madagascar\" co-director Eric Darnell, he was trying to get a toon project called \"Rockumentary\" off the ground - kind of \"A Hard Day's Night\" with penguins instead of Liverpudlians. However, landing the rights to the Beatles' songs proved impossible, and the idea was shelved.\n\nBut the penguins remained.\n\nOne of \"Madagascar's\" funnier conceits is that four of the black-and-white antarctic birds stow away on the freighter that's taking the Central Park Zoo escapees across the Atlantic to the remote island off southeastern Africa. In the family-friendly farce, opening in theaters today, Ben Affleck provides the voice of the lion, Chris Rock's the zebra, David Schwimmer's the giraffe and Jada Pinkett Smith's the hippo.\n\nMcGrath, in fact, ended up doing the voice of the chief penguin, Skipper, a nutty fellow who goes into pirate mode when he realizes that maybe a jungle island isn't the best place for a penguin to be.\n\nAlthough \"Madagascar\" hails from the same outfit that produced \"Shrek\" and \"Shark Tale,\" employing a crew of 300 in state-of-the-art facilities in San Francisco and Los Angeles, the film has a different sort of look to it. McGrath and Darnell wanted to make a real \"cartoon,\" with characters that squash and stretch, just as in the old \"Looney Tunes.\"\n\n\"What if we took the style of animation that was pioneered in the '40s and '50s, and put it in the computer-generated arena, which can create worlds that seem real?\" says McGrath. \"That was our main goal.\"\n\nA graduate of the animation program at Cal-Arts, McGrath 39, says that although the trend is all computer animation, all the time, he doesn't see the ink-and-paint traditions dying out.\n\n\"I know someone will come along in a few years with a traditionally animated project and people will go, 'Wow, that's really amazing!' And then everybody will be scurrying to do 2-D, traditional animation again.\n\n\"To me, it's more like the pen and the pencil: 'The pen is in town! The pencil is dead forever!' Well, that's just not the case. ... In Hollywood right now, computers are sexy, but it's really the story that makes it, or breaks it.\"\n\nIn fact, McGrath says, the current move away from traditional animation helped to give \"Madagascar\" its character - and characters - by expanding the talent pool to include out-of-work, old-school animators.\n\n\"A lot of them were very reluctant to take on computer animation - and I was one of them,\" McGrath reports. \"But, by economic necessity, a lot of them decided to make the leap over and try computer animation. And while an animator's drawing ability is one thing, what really makes a great animator is his or her sense of timing and sense of motion and performance. ... So all that experience from traditional animation was now challenging computer animation. These guys, with five weeks of training, were just blowing the doors off of stuff!\""
