        "text": "While Hollywood has already produced virtual reality experiences based on theatrical features, Roth Kirschenbaum Films and VR startup Baobab Studios are taking the opposite approach, teaming up to create a theatrical feature based on the characters and story in Baobab’s debut narrative VR short Invasion!\n\nInvasion!, an original 6-minute narrative directed by Baobab partner and chief creative officer Eric Darnell (Madagascar), tells the story of bumbling aliens who try to destroy earth but are thwarted by two bunnies. Ethan Hawke narrated.\n\nThe details for the feature production are still being discussed; It hasn’t yet been determined who will write or direct, as well as where the animation will be produced. But the Hollywood pros have high expectations. “I want Invasion! to be the next Toy Story,” said producer Joe Roth, former chairman of Walt Disney Studios and co-founder of R/K Films, in a statement. “It struck an emotional chord.”\n\nInvasion! debuted last spring at the Tribeca Film Festival."
