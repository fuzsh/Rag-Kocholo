Undaunted by the colonies unyielding caste system, Z enlists the aid of his best friend, a soldier ant named Weaver (Sylvester Stallone), to get to the Princess. When a remarkable twist of fate turns Z from a common drone into an unlikely hero, he unwittingly puts a bug in the ambitious General Mandibles (Gene Hackman) plan to literally liquidate the colony and remake it in his own image.\n\nZ soon finds himself leading a revolution that becomes a celebration of individuality in the face of overwhelming conformity. Once the most insignificant of workers, Z may just prove to be the biggest hero of them all.\n\nNo picnic will ever be the same when DreamWorks and PDI present the romantic comedy adventure Antz, starring the voices of (in alphabetical order) Woody Allen, Dan Aykroyd, Anne Bancroft, Jane Curtin, Danny Glover, Gene Hackman, Jennifer Lopez, John Mahoney, Paul Mazursky, Grant Shaud, Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone and Christopher Walken.\n\nThe film is directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson and produced by Brad Lewis, Aaron Warner and Patty Wooton. Penney Finkelman Cox, Sandra Rabins and Carl Rosendahl are the executive producers. The animation screenplay is by Todd Alcott and Chris Weitz & Paul Weitz.\n\nJohn Bell (Production Designer) previously served as an art director on Steven Spielberg's blockbuster Jurassic Park."
