Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.\n\n[Makunga encounters Zuba in a flashback]\n\nMakunga: Look at it this way. After I defeat you and take your place as alpha lion, you'll have that much more time to spend with your pathetic excuse of a son.\n\nZuba: Before I kick your butt, tell me ask you - why do you even wanna be the alpha lion?\n\nMakunga: I'm better looking, I have better hair, I'm deceitfully smart...and I want everyone to do what I say. We'll fight on 3. 1, 2, 3!\n\nSkipper: Struts.\n\nKowalski: [flicks the levers] Check.\n\nSkipper: Flaps.\n\nKowalski: [taps on the flaps control] Check.\n\nSkipper: Engine.\n\nKowalski: [turns a knob] Check.\n\nSkipper: Coffee maker.\n\nKowalski: [turns on the coffee maker] Check.\n\nSkipper: That's got to be the second biggest slingshot I've ever seen. But it's gonna have to do. [on the intercom] Attention. This is your captain speaking.\n\n[Private is giving a safety demonstration to the passengers]\n\nPrivate: [shows life vest] In the event of a water emergency, place the vest over your head, and kiss your... [pulls on the red tab, causing the vest to inflate and explode] ...Goodbye.\n\nGloria: New York City! Here we come, baby!\n\nSkipper: ...Sit back, relax, pray to your personal god this hunk of junk flies.\n\nAlex: Personal god. Hunk of what?\n\nKowalski: We are go, sir.\n\nMort: Open the door! I'm outside! [screams]\n\nPrivate: In case of a loss in cabin pressure, place the mask over your face... [places oxygen mask over his face, muffling his voice] ...To hide your terrified expression from the other passengers.\n\nMarty: [showing his detached seatbelt] Excuse me, miss, but aren't these supposed to be attached to my seat?\n\nPrivate: [removes the mask] No, sir.\n\n[The red bulb on the plane's fuel gauge is flashing]\n\nKowalski: Skipper, look.\n\nSkipper: Analysis.\n\nKowalski: It looks like a small incandescent bulb, designed to indicate something out of the ordinary, like a malfunction.\n\nSkipper: I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.\n\nKowalski: That too, sir.\n\nSkipper: Right. Rico, manual! [catches the manual and promptly smashes the bulb with it] Problemo solved.\n\nKowalski: Sir, we may be out of fuel.\n\nSkipper: What makes you think that?\n\nKowalski: We've lost engine 1. [out the left window, engine #1 sputters out] And engine 2 is no longer on fire. [out the right window, engine #2 stops smoking and sputters]\n\nSkipper: Buckle up, boys. [covers \"Doll's\" eyes] Don't look, doll, this might get hairy. [on the intercom] Attention. This is your captain speaking. I've got good news and bad news. The good news is we'll be landing immediately. Bad news is...we're crash landing. [the plane falls out of the sky; all, except the sleeping Gloria, and the chimps; Mason and Phil, start screaming] When it comes to air travel, we know you have no choice whatsoever. But thanks again for choosing Air Penguin.\n\nKing Julien: [laughing] Raise your arms, Maurice! It's more fun when you raise arms like this! [everything in first class, including Julien and Maurice get sucked out of the plane; deploys a parachute] I can fly!\n\nAlex: This could be it, Marty! I just want you to know you are truly a one-in-a million friend!\n\nMarty: Thanks, buddy! You're the best ever!\n\nAlex: I know you won't mind when I tell youâ€¦\n\nMarty: Go on! Tell me anything! Tell me what?\n\nAlex: I broke your iPod!\n\nMarty: WHAT?!\n\nAlex: The buttons were so small! It made me mad!\n\nMarty: Oh, no! The horror!\n\nAlex: I'm sorry!\n\nMarty: I'm gonna kill you, butt-bitter! Butt-bitter! Butt-bitter!\n\nAlex: It was an accident! I'm sorry! I'll get you a new one!\n\nMelman: I love you, Gloria! I always have! [Gloria is snoring, Alex, Marty, Mason, and Phil glare at Melman quizzically] Yeah, like you love the beach, or a good book. Or the beach.\n\nSkipper: My goodness, Doll, you're shaking like a leaf. Rico! You've had your fun. Pull up. [Rico pulls up] Gear down. [Kowalski pulls a lever that deploys the landing gear] Gently now. You just want to kiss the ground. Just a little peck. A smooch. Like you're kissing your sister. [the landing gear breaks] I said kiss it! [the wings, engines, and the hull of the plane break off] Now just a little brake. Just a touch. A little whisper.\n\nMason: [while playing chess with Phil] I believe that's checkmate.\n\n[Alex and Marty scream]\n\nSkipper: Commence emergency landing procedure! Flaps up! Deploy!\n\n[Kowalski and Rico deploy the parachutes that make the plane land gently]\n\n[Looking out over the African plain]\n\nMelman: Whoa.\n\nGloria: Am I trippin'?\n\nMarty: Look at all the zebras, like me! Wait a minute, where are we?\n\nMelman: San Diego. This time I'm 40% sure.\n\nAlex: I know this place.\n\nMarty: I think it's Africa.\n\nMelman: Africa?\n\nMarty: It's gotta be. Our ancestral crib! It's in our blood, I can feel it!\n\nAlex: No, no. It's more than that. It's like, deja vu, like I've...like I've been here before.\n\nMarty: It's like Roots!\n\nAlex: [dazed] No, no. It's like, Deja Vu|deja vu, like I've...like I've been here before.\n\nMoto Moto: [raspy voice] Goodness, girl, you're huge.\n\nGloria: Who's your friend or is that your butt?\n\nKowalski: Skipper, we have all the parts we need. But, we're slightly behind schedule.\n\nSkipper: How slightly?\n\nKowalski: 6 to 9 years.\n\nSkipper: 69 years?\n\nKowalski: No. 6 to 9 years.\n\nSkipper: [on the intercom] Private, what happened to our thumbs?\n\nPrivate: Haven't seen them since yesterday sir. [drops his screwdriver] Darn you Darwin! [the car's hood closes on him]\n\nSkipper: Nobody goes AWOL on my watch. Private! You're coming with me! [the inside of the front of the car explodes] Rico! You're coming with me!\n\n[Rico welds a car in half]\n\nSkipper: We'll track them down and bring them in for court martial.\n\nMason: That won't be necessary. We've recruited a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper. [camera pans to a whole lot of chimpanzees]\n\nSkipper: Well I'll be a monkey's uncle.\n\nMason: Oh, I doubt that. [chimpanzees screeching]\n\nSkipper: [on the intercom] Enough lollygagging. Now let's get to work. We'll divide into three groups. Group Alpha, you're in charge of sheet metal fabrication. Group Bronson, you'll handle assembly. Group George Peppard, you'll handle craft services. Any questions? [Mason tries to say something] Good, now let's get to work.\n\nJulien: What ever happened to the separation of the classes?\n\nMaurice: Don't worry, I'm sure this democracy thing is just a fad.\n\nMurray: You'll find a cure. Hey! You've got at least 48 hours!\n\nGloria: Is this place great or what?!\n\nAlex: I'd go with \"Or what?\".\n\n[The union monkeys have gone on strike. Mason and Phil are with Skipper at the negotiating table]\n\nMason: The plane won't be fixed until the suits meet our demands. Now, about maternity leave.\n\nSkipper: \"Maternity leave\"? [glances under the table] You're all males...\n\nMarty: Look, we need that plane for a rescue mission.\n\nSkipper: Well, there's nothing I can do until we bust up this union.\n\nGloria: I'm gonna get to busting up all you if you don't get this plane going!\n\nSkipper: Can't you see these commies have my hands tied here! No maternity leave!\n\nMason: [nudges Phil, who pulls out incriminating photos of Skipper and \"Doll\" in compromising positions] Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want these blowing around on the savanna? Hmm?\n\nSkipper: [reluctantly] Alright, you get your maternity leave.\n\n[A whistle blows in the background and the monkeys get back to fixing the plane]\n\nMarty: Finally.\n\nNana: That was beautiful. Now let's eat!\n\nAlex: Dad! Look out!\n\nZuba: What the...?\n\nMarty: Alex! Get in!\n\nAlex: She's got a gun! Let's get out while we can!\n\nMarty: What?\n\nAlex: She's got a gun! Let's get out while we can! Pass it on.\n\n[The chimpanzees chatter the message all the way up the chain]\n\nMason: He said, \"Let's have some fun and take out the dam. Basset hound.\"\n\nMarty: Skipper! Alex wants to take out the dam!\n\nSkipper: Alright. [on the intercom] It's his funeral.\n\nMarty: What?\n\nSkipper: [on the intercom] Hard to port!\n\nGloria: Aye aye, Skippy!\n\nMelman: Bring it on! Bring it on! Whoo!\n\nNana: Come back! That's my dinner!\n\nSkipper: Kowalski, full throttle. Music.\n\nPrivate: [puts in a tape that plays \"At The Copa (Copacabana)\" by Barry Manilow] Oh, I like this song.\n\nKowalski: It never gets old.\n\nSkipper: It does have a catchy hook. Come about! Bring her in low! [on the intercom] Hold on to your skirts! It's dam-busting time!\n\nGloria: Hold on tight, baby! Here we go!\n\nAlex: Tell them No! Pull up! They'll kill us! There's got to be another way! Pass it on.\n\n[The chimpanzees chatter the message all the way up the chain]\n\nMason: They said, \"Yes! Don't pull up, kill us! There's no other way. Basset Hound.\"\n\nMarty: Are you sure?\n\nSkipper: Men, there's no sacrifice greater than someone else's. [\"Doll's\" head gets blown off by Nana's shotgun] Doll!!! Medic!!!\n\n[Rico pulls out the tape]\n\nSkipper: Ramming speed!!\n\nNana: [Twirling her purse] Bring it on! [All scream as they're about to crash head-first into the dam] Bad kitties!\n\nTaglines\n\n[edit]\n\nStill together, still lost.\n\nYou got to move it move it. You got to move it.\n\n[from trailer] This fall, your favorite castaways are going home.\n\n[from trailer] They thought they were going home. They thought wrong.\n\n[from trailer] On November 7, for these castaways, it's a jungle out there.\n\n[from trailer] From DreamWorks, to survive in Africa, they'll have to get in touch with their wild side.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nMadagascar\n\nEurope's Most Wanted\n\nThe Penguins of Madagascar (TV show)\n\nPenguins of Madagascar (movie)\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nBen Stiller â€” Alex the Lion\n\nChris Rock â€” Marty the Zebra / Additional Zebras\n\nDavid Schwimmer â€” Melman Mankiewicz the Giraffe\n\nJada Pinkett Smith â€” Gloria the Hippo\n\nSacha Baron Cohen â€” Julien the Lemur\n\nCedric the Entertainer â€” Maurice the Lemur\n\nAndy Richter â€” Mort the Lemur\n\nBernie Mac (final role) â€” Zuba the Alpha Lion\n\nAlec Baldwin â€” Makunga the Rival Lion\n\nSherri Shepherd â€” Florrie the Alpha Lioness\n\nwill.i.am â€” Moto Moto the Hippo\n\nTom McGrath â€” Skipper the Penguin\n\nChris Miller â€” Kowalski the Penguin\n\nChris Knights â€” Private the Penguin\n\nJohn DiMaggio â€” Rico the Penguin\n\nConrad Vernon â€” Mason the Chimpanzee\n\nElise Gabriel â€” Nana the Old Lady\n\nDedication\n\n[edit]\n\nFor our friend, Bernie Mac.
