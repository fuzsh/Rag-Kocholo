        "text": "August 1999\n\nAntz\n\nReviewed by Roger Kanno\n\nDVD Format\n\nStarring the voices of Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman, Sylvester Stallone, Jennifer Lopez, Christopher Walken\n\nDirected by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson\n\nTheatrical Release: 1998\n\nDVD Release: 1999\n\nDolby Digital 5.1\n\nWidescreen (Anamorphic)\n\nAntz, the first feature-length animated film to be released by Dreamworks SKG, features many of Hollywoods biggest stars providing the voices and the prestige of having been produced by a film studio that is owned in part by Steven Spielberg. Having also secured the services of Pacific Data Images (PDI) to provide the computer animation for Antz and several other upcoming releases, Dreamworks appears to have forged a partnership which may challenge Disney and Pixar for superiority in the field of animated films.\n\nDreamworks has also done a thorough job on the production of this DVD and created a disc that is not only full of quality extras, but which is also a remarkable technical achievement. The disc contains the directors audio commentary, a production featurette, production notes, cast and crew biographies, a theatrical trailer, and several interviews with production staff that explore the animation process employed by PDI to create Antz.\n\nThe animation in Antz is not as elaborate as that of Disneys A Bugs Life, but it is still quite good. There is not as much articulation or complexity in the faces or bodies of the characters nor are the lighting effects and backgrounds as realistic or detailed. In fact, the lighting throughout much of Antz is quite dark and gives the picture a slightly soft appearance. However, the subtle shadow detail is excellent, and blacks are dark and solid. Bright exterior shots, on the other hand, have very vibrant colors and seemingly exhibit much greater detail.\n\nThe sound design is exceptional and relies heavily on a well-recorded, well-integrated musical score. The music exhibits a sound that is rich and warm with an expansive soundstage that is unlike most movie soundtracks. Scenes such as Chapter 5: Invitation to the Dantz and Chapter 19: Insectopia! feature covers of \"Guantanamera\" and \"I Can See Clearly Now\" that are a sheer delight. The use of the surround channels is not as aggressive as is possible and the bass is sometimes slightly boomy, but the soundtrack is always smooth, coherent, and provides a wonderful accompaniment to the striking visuals.\n\nAntz revolves around the life of Z, a worker ant portrayed by Woody Allen, who has become weary of the lack of individuality inherent in being part of an ant colony. Through a series of misadventures and unlikely events, Z becomes involved in a sinister plot involving General Mandible, who is voiced by Gene Hackman. Along the way he befriends the queen's daughter, Princess Bala, who is played by Sharon Stone, and he is helped out by his friends Azteca and Weaver, played by Jennifer Lopez and Sylvester Stallone respectively. While some of the exchanges between Princess Bala and Z are clever and genuinely funny, it is the budding romance between Azteca and Weaver that captures your interest with its refreshing charm and innocence. Allen, Stone, and Lopez are all perfectly cast in their roles, and Stallone is at his best as the strong yet sensible soldier ant displaying great loyalty towards his friend Z.\n\nThe plot of Antz is much darker and more complex than that of most animated films and is more suited to adults than to children. There is also much more character development, not only of the main characters, but also of the supporting characters such as Weaver and Colonel Cutter. Antz is more like a Woody Allen comedy that happens to be animated rather than an animated film made for children. As such, it may not have the same broad appeal as other animated films, but it is still very smart and well written. In fact, I enjoyed Antz even more during my second and third viewings. This is definitely one to add to your library."
