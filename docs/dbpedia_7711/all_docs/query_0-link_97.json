        "text": "Madagascar is a 2005 American animated survival comedy film produced by DreamWorks Animation SKG and PDI/DreamWorks, and distributed by DreamWorks Pictures.\n\nThe film was directed by Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath (in McGrath's feature directorial debut) and written by Darnell, McGrath, Mark Burton, and Billy Frolick.\n\nThe film stars the voices of Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, Jada Pinkett Smith, Sacha Baron Cohen, Cedric the Entertainer, and Andy Richter.\n\nIt centers around a group of animals from the Central Park Zoo who find themselves stranded on the island of Madagascar and must adjust to living in the wild.\n\nDreamWorks and PDI began developing an animated film titled Rockumentary, featuring a Beatles-esque penguin rock band, and was set to be directed by Darnell, after he finished his work on Antz (1998). The idea was scrapped in 2001, but Darnell decided to revive the penguins, albeit with a commando unit instead rather than a rock band after production on Madagascar started.\n\nThe film features several songs from various artists, with musical score being composed by Hans Zimmer. It also has the cover of \"I Like to Move It\" by Cohen, which has since become a recurring theme song throughout the franchise.\n\nReleased on May 27, 2005, Madagascar received mixed to positive reviews from critics, who praised the visuals and charm but criticized the story and humor. Despite the mixed reviews, it was a success at the box office, grossing $556.6 million on a production budget of $75 million, becoming the sixth highest-grossing film of 2005.\n\nThe success of Madagascar launched a multimedia franchise, which includes two sequels as well as the spin-off film Penguins of Madagascar; several short films, television series and specials; and a number of video games, theme park attractions and live stage shows, starting with Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa. Madagascar is also DreamWorks Animation's film to date, and the animated film released by DreamWorks Pictures, and it held the title of being the animated film of all time worldwide until Blue Sky Studios' Rio surpassed it in 2011.\n\nPlot:\n\nIn New York City, Alex the lion lives in the Central Park Zoo as a star attraction known as the \"King of New York\", and spends time with his friends, consisting of Melman the giraffe, Gloria the hippopotamus, and his best friend Marty the zebra. Marty has grown weary of his daily routine and desires to experience the wild. On Marty's tenth birthday, Alex, Melman, and Gloria attempt to cheer him up, but a still-unsatisfied Marty learns that the zoo's penguins — Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, and Private — are trying to escape to Antarctica, and promptly follows them out. Marty heads towards Grand Central Station, as he plans to catch a train to nearby Connecticut. Alex, Melman, and Gloria pursue Marty in an attempt to convince him to return, only to end up, along with the penguins and two chimpanzees named Mason and Phil, at Grand Central, where the police officers, firefighters, and animal control officers sedate them using tranquillizer guns. Under pressure from anti-captivity activists, the zoo is forced to ship their escaped animals by sea to a wildlife preserve in Kenya. During their travels, the penguins escape their crate and commandeer the ship in the hopes of heading to Antarctica, causing the crates containing Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria to fall overboard.\n\nUpon being washed ashore on the island of Madagascar, the animals come across a pack of lemurs led by King Julien XIII. The predatory fossa attack the lemurs, only to be scared off by the fearsome appearance of Alex, who selfishly blames Marty for the group's predicament and attempts to signal for help to get back to civilization. Marty finds the wild to be exactly what he was looking for, and Gloria and Melman soon join him in enjoying the island. Alex, coming to realize how selfish and entitled he has been and with some Marty's encouragement, eventually comes around and makes amends, but without the raw steaks he was provided at the zoo, his hunger sets in and prey drive begins to show. Julien leads the lemurs into befriending the zoo animals in the hope that Alex's presence will keep the fossa at bay, despite his adviser Maurice's warnings about Alex's predatory nature. When Alex loses control and attacks Marty, Maurice throws a coconut at Alex to stop him. Realizing what he has done and feeling sad and guilty for attacking his friends, Alex flees to the predator side of the island, where the fossa live. Seeing what Alex has become and how dangerous the wild can be, Marty regrets his decision to leave the zoo.\n\nHaving found Antarctica to be inhospitable, the penguins land the ship at Madagascar. Seeing the chance to return Alex to New York, Marty crosses over to the predator side and attempts to convince the scared and starving Alex to return, but Alex refuses out of fear that he will attack Marty again. The fossa attack Marty, and though Gloria, Melman, and the penguins come to the rescue, they are outnumbered. Alex overcomes his predatory instincts, rescues his friends, and scares the fossa away from the lemur territory. The lemurs regain their respect for Alex, and the penguins satisfy his hunger by feeding him sushi, which he finds better than steak. As the lemurs throw a farewell celebration for the foursome, the penguins decide not to tell them that the ship has run out of fuel, leaving them stranded on the island for the time being.\n\nWhy It Likes To Move It:\n\nSplendid animation, especially for 2005 standards.\n\nMadagascar itself looks amazing.\n\nThe movie takes advantage of the fact that it is an animated movie and has fast-paced animation and comedy while still having some heart.\n\nThe movie stays away from most clichés and instead tries to be unpredictable, as the movie keeps you guessing. The plot of Alex trying to keep his temptation of eating his friends back is also a very different and interesting plot.\n\nNice voice acting, especially from Ben Stiller.\n\nLikable and funny characters, especially Alex, Marty, Gloria, Melman, and especially the Penguins.\n\nFunny moments such as Alex thinking Marty is steak and Mort getting scared when Alex tries to be nice to him.\n\nThe song \"I Like To Move It\" (originally by Reel 2 Real) is catchy.\n\nThe Penguins are absolute scene-stealers, and easily the best part of the movie.\n\nThere is a great attempt when it comes to the dialogue, such as \"Giraffe, Corner Pocket!\" and \"San Diego\".\n\nBad Qualities:\n\nSome moments in the animation can look kind of creepy and slightly dated (even though it is a fairly old movie), such as when Mort is crying and his eyes look completely black.\n\nPlot hole: It's never explained how Marty escaped the zoo, which is a very questionable plot hole for viewers.\n\nThere is a tiny little amount of product placement in the New York scene such as Hewlett-Packard, Coca-Cola, Starbucks, Toys R Us, Hugo Boss, TGI Friday's, Samsung, McDonald's, RCA, and Nike, but it at least wasn't shoved in the audiences' throats.\n\nSome inappropriate humor at times, such as Marty making an acronym that resembles the word “shit” (acronym in question: Sugar Honey Iced Tea).\n\nReception:\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a 55% approval rating based on 192 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The consensus reads: \"Though its story is problematic in spots and its humor is hit-or-miss for the adult crowd, Madagascar boasts impressive visuals and enough spunky charm to keep children entertained.\"\n\nOn Metacritic, the film has a score of 57 out of 100, based on 36 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nAudiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale."
