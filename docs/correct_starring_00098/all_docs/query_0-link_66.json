        "text": "Regina George can’t sit with them! Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried, and Lacey Chabert just had the Mean Girls reunion in Los Angeles.\n\nThe best part? It appears we’re going to get to see what came of the Plastics’ meetup, which TMZ reports was for a Pepsi commercial. On October 6 the Mean Girls stars who played Cady Heron, Karen Smith, and Gretchen Wieners in the 2004 high school comedy were photographed smiling on set. Lohan was seen in a silky pink robe in photos obtained by TMZ, while Seyfried and Chabert wore pink dresses in snaps shared on TikTok. In one photo Lohan was even seen sporting what appeared to be a “Plastic Club Member, Est. 2004” makeup pouch, which also featured the quote, “On Wednesdays, we wear pink.”\n\nUnfortunately, Rachel McAdams did not make an appearance, though she starred in the original film as the Plastics’ fearsome leader, Regina George. McAdams may not have been spotted filming the Pepsi ad, but she has said she’s down to reprise her role. “It would be fun to play Regina George later in her life and see where life took her,” she said in April 2020, though she noted there had not been involved in any serious discussions.\n\nAround the same time, Lindsay Lohan said she’d love to be involved in a Mean Girls sequel with the original cast and crew. “I think I was hanging on to [Mean Girls] for a really long idea,” Lohan told Spade in April 2020. “I wanted to come back with a Mean Girls 2 with the same cast, work with Tina [Fey], and the whole crew again, and [director] Mark Waters. That was really what I wanted; I was excited to do that. But that’s all in their hands, really.”"
