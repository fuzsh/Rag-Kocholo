And it’s a musical version?\n\nThat’s so fetch.\n\nThat’s what we’re getting, starting on Friday, January 12 in the United States, with Tina Fey bringing back the characters from the now-classic 2004 comedy and basing it on the Broadway musical from 2018.\n\nFey penned the script and it’s directed by Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr. But who plays Cady and Regina George and Damian and everyone else we enjoyed in the first flick? Glad you asked."
