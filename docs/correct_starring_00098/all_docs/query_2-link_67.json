Our first look at the adaptation dropped on 8th November and there’s so much happening.\n\nFeaturing Olivia Rodrigo's ‘Get Him Back!’, the trailer starts out with the warning: “This is not your mother's Mean Girls.” We then get our first glimpse of Reneé Rapp as Regina George, plus Tina Fey returns as does the iconic Burn Book, the Winter Talent Show and more.\n\nYou can watch the trailer here:\n\nWho is the cast of the Mean Girls musical film?\n\nThe cast features faces we know and love plus new names, including:\n\nAngourie Rice as Cady Heron (she plays Betty in Spider-Man Homecoming and No Way Home!)\n\nReneé Rapp as Regina George (from The Sex Lives of College Girls)\n\nAuli’i Cravalho as Janice (AKA Moana herself)\n\nJaquel Spivey as Damian\n\nAvantika Vandanapu as Karen\n\nBebe Wood as Gretchen\n\nChristopher Briney as Aaron Samuels (that’s Conrad from The Summer I Turned Pretty).\n\nPlus, Tina Fey returns as Ms. Norbury and Emily in Paris’ Ashley Park plays a French teacher. Rachel McAdams has also revealed she was almost in the revival, but eventually decided against it.\n\n\"Tina and I sort of dabbled with a few ideas, but it was tough to make it all work in the end,” she told Variety. \"I was really down for whatever she wanted to do. I think the direction it went in will be fantastic and I cannot wait to see it.\"\n\nWhat is the Mean Girls musical film release date?"
