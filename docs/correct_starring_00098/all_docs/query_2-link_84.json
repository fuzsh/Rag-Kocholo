        "text": "There is a certain magic to capturing the barbaric qualities of high school on film. Each aspect from bullies to cliques, to love is heightened in the most satisfying way possible. The magic is in taking the more-or-less universal experiences of youth and exaggerating them into pure, unabashed, unashamed drama. While musicals are not my usual flavor of film, “Mean Girls” ended up being an incredibly fun film that I had a great time with. Directed by Samatha Jayne and Arturo Perez, with the script coming from Tina Fey, “Mean Girls” succeeds in capturing the slaughterhouse high school is capable of being.\n\nBack of the DVD Summary: For the uninitiated like myself, Mean Girls follows Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) as she traverses the horrors of high school and a boy crush who used to date the Queen Bee Regina George (Reneé Rapp). The basics consist of Cady trying to navigate finding her place as the new girl, while also trying to figure out who she is and who she wants to be. The antics that ensue are a direct result of Cady’s attempts to dethrone Regina, but incidentally becoming an almost worse version."
