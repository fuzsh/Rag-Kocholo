        "text": "Not to age ourselves, but also not caring if we do, we’ve LOVED Lacey Chabert since her days on Party of Five. That show is the reason we know her, follow her career, and love all of her movies.\n\nYes, we’re aware that for some of you, it’s Mean Girls that made you love Lacey and to those we say, you really need to watch Party of Five.\n\nLacey has gone on from Party of Five to have quite the successful career. While she’s been in a lot of movies and television shows, we’ve followed her Hallmark movies closely.\n\nChabert has made over 30 Hallmark films, so narrowing down our top five? No easy feat.\n\nChristmas in Rome\n\nWhat It’s About: Angela, an American tour guide in Rome, agrees to teach a culture-shocked businessman named Oliver about the heart of Rome at Christmas.\n\nWhy We Love It: We love that this movie is set in Rome, because you know one of our favorite cities in the world. Chabert stars as Angela, and she’s endearing in the role. It’s the way that Chabert’s character leads you around Rome, educating on the city, but also following her own path and wanting to make her own way – we’re here for.\n\nAnd that ending, well… we always love a happy ending.\n\nThe Wedding Veil\n\nWhat It’s About: Follows longtime friends who find a mysterious, antique veil fabled to unite its bearer with her true love.\n\nWhy We Love It: We love every movie in The Wedding Veil franchise, without regret. The series of movies follow three friends and the ups and downs of their love lives after they find a mysterious veil that leads them to love.\n\nChabert plays Avery, a museum director who believes in love to her core, but is also willing to challenge it at every turn. She knows what she wants and she’s willing to go after it. But she’s also willing to sacrifice whatever for love.\n\nWhat we love about this character is that Avery is loyal and she gives everything to her friends and the people that she loves. These movies made us believe in the magic of love and hey, that’s something that we’ll never regret feeling.\n\nHaul out the Holly\n\nWhat It’s About: Emily arrives home hoping to visit her parents, only to find that they are going on a trip of their own. While she stays at her house for the holidays, her HOA is determined to get Emily involved in the neighborhood Christmas festivities.\n\nWhy We Love It: Call us a sucker for Christmas, but that’s what made this movie so special. It was filled with holiday cheer and joy. It kept us laughing, smiling, and looking forward to Christmas.\n\nChristmas at Castle Hart\n\nWhat It’s About: Brooke Bennett goes to Ireland for Christmas to search for her Irish roots. While there, she meets Aiden Hart. Mistaken for an elite event planner, she’s hired to host his castle’s epic Christmas party.\n\nWhy We Love It: Our love for Ireland is strong, but what made us love this movie isn’t just that. It’s that no matter what happened in this movie, people believed in better.\n\nA better life.\n\nA better chance.\n\nA better future.\n\nIt went to show us that we can all dream and that finding your way to family is inevitable. There’s also that bit about the truth always rising to the top.\n\nLoved everything about it.\n\nSWEET CAROLINA\n\nWhat It’s About: Marketing executive, Josie, returns home when she becomes the unexpected guardian of her niece and nephew. While there, she reconnects with Cooper, her high school boyfriend.\n\nWhy We Love It: There was no part of this movie that didn’t make us cry our eyes out. The heartbreak of loosing family, the heartbreak of finding a way, the heartbreak of loosing your way. The road of self discovery for all of the characters in this movie was hard to watch, but it was worth it.\n\nBecause in the end we realized that what it gave us hope and what’s better than that."
