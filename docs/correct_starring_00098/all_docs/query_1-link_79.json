        "text": "Having 30 Hallmark movies to her name, Lacey Chabert – known for her roles on “Party of Five” and “Mean Girls” – has been called the “Queen of Hallmark Movies,” something the actress takes as a compliment.\n\n“The first one I did was ‘Elevator Girl’ (2010). Now, I just completed my 30th movie. I never knew when I did ‘Elevator Girl’ that it would turn into what it has. I’m so proud to be part of the Hallmark family. It means a lot to me that people enjoy the films and relate to the characters. People say the movies are ‘comfort food for the soul.’ I’m proud to be part of something that’s uplifting and adds a little goodness into the world,” said Chabert.\n\nHer latest Hallmark film is this weekend’s “The Wedding Veil Legacy.” It’s the final installment of a trilogy that began with last month’s “The Wedding Veil” and continued with Feb. 12’s “The Wedding Veil Unveiled.”\n\nThis trilogy features Chabert and fellow Hallmark actresses – her “Hallmark sisters” – Autumn Reeser (“Entourage”) and Alison Sweeney (“Days of Our Lives”). They play the lead in one film and supporting roles in the other two. The trilogy follows three lifelong friends who find a mysterious wedding veil believed to unite its bearer with true love. Chabert’s Avery was center stage in the first movie and Reeser’s Emma in the second. The spotlight is on Sweeney’s Tracy in the third.\n\n“It’s not just about the veil and the love stories – that’s the centerpiece – but it really is about the relationship between these three women and how they care for one another, support one another, and have each other’s backs, which is a beautiful thing to see,” said Chabert.\n\nBased on Lori Wilde’s novels, sisters/long-time Hallmark movie writers Sandra and Judith Berg approached Chabert and executive producers Beth Grossbard and Lisa Demberg about this trilogy.\n\n“We’re just thankful Hallmark allowed us to tell this kind of story,” said Chabert. “With every movie, I’m trying to raise the bar… find a different way of telling these stories. I loved that it was a trilogy and loved the opportunity to act along some of my friends from the network. A lot of fans asked over the years if we’d be in movies together or if there’d be some sort of crossover – this was the perfect time for that… It’s been really exciting these past few months to see it come to life and see it be so well-received. I just appreciate the fan support.”\n\nThis trilogy, something new to Hallmark, allowed Chabert to work with Reeser and Sweeney.\n\n“I knew both Autumn and Ali before this, but we’ve gotten to know each other so much more on a deeper level now that we’ve had the experience of making these three movies together and traveling the world to make it happen. We have so many good memories, so many laughs, relating to each other as mothers, balancing work and personal life,” explained Chabert. “It was also interesting to be in a film with someone else who understands what it is to be the lead in these movies and understands the responsibility we have to the Hallmark fans. We put so much passion into it and enjoyed the work. I just feel really blessed we had the chance to collaborate. I just love them. I hope we can do another movie together. If not, I told them we’re friends for life.”\n\nIn 2014, Chabert played Gina Kell Spehn, of Rochester Hills, in Hallmark’s “The Color of Rain,” based on the book of the same name written by Gina and her husband Michael Spehn. Both Gina and Michael lost their spouses to cancer and eventually got married, finding love again in the wake of such overwhelming loss. They founded the New Day Foundation for Families in Rochester Hills 15 years ago. Its mission is to provide financial assistance and emotional support to families battling cancer.\n\n“I love Gina so much,” said Chabert. “What a special woman. What a special family. To have overcome such tragedy and they now use their lives to help so many people, I’m constantly inspired by them. They’re a beautiful family. She’s a lovely woman and I’m proud to call her a friend… It was a real honor that I got to be a part of telling their story in (‘Rain’).”\n\nChabert assists with New Day fundraisers when able. She donates 100% of her Cameo proceeds to New Day. In late 2021, Chabert raised approximately $60,000 for New Day on “Celebrity Wheel of Fortune.”\n\n“I’ll never get over the fact I didn’t solve the last puzzle, which was ‘a very lucky guy.’ It haunts me to this day,” she recalled, laughing. “That experience was an absolute dream come true because I am a super-fan of the show. When I had a chance to be a part of it, I was so excited and so nervous. I knew I wanted to play on New Day’s behalf because they do so much to help so many people through the emotional and financial crisis that comes with a cancer diagnosis. I believe in the work they do, so I was thrilled to represent them.”\n\nIn turn, Spehn praised Chabert.\n\n“The first time I met Lacey was on our movie set. Her light-hearted spirit and genuine kindness were immediately evident. I’ve been a fan since her (‘Party’) days, so I was elated and honored when I found out she would play me in (‘Rain’),” she said. “Lacey has become a friend and champion for the mission of New Day. She’s a woman after God’s heart, who – despite suffering her own deep losses – lives her faith and uses her gifts and talents to serve others. I simply adore her and am blessed to have her in my life. I only wished she lived closer!”"
