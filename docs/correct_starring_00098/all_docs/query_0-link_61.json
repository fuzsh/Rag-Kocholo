        "text": "Lacey Chabert‘s Gretchen Wieners is back for another Mean Girls Walmart Black Friday ad.\n\nThe new ad spot (below) sees Gretchen’s new clique that she formed after her days at North Shore High School: the Wieners household.\n\n“I am so getting you white gold hoop earrings for Hanukkah,” she says to her teen daughter. “What gold? It’s giving 2004,” her daughter replies before Chabert quickly cuts in, “Irregardless, I don’t think your grandfather, the inventor of Toaster Strudel, would be too pleased to hear you using that tone with me.”\n\nLater, Chabert also tried to make “bop” happen, while listening to ‘Milkshake’: “Throwback Wednesday! I love this song. What a bop.” But her daughter was not having it, telling her mom, “Please don’t say bop.”\n\nThe commercial references several memorable lines from the original 2004 film, including Amanda Seyfried’s Karen Smith making an appearance to ask Chabert, “Do you ever wonder if the girl in the mirror can see you back?”\n\nBut “even the [Walmart] deals couldn’t keep Gretchen Wieners from cracking,” Lindsay Lohan says in a voiceover during the ad spot.\n\nWhile sitting down for family dinner, Chabert snaps at her daughter who has headphones on at the table, “If you can’t take your headphones out, you can’t sit with us!”\n\nLast week, several of the castmembers of the 2004 Mean Girls, including stars Lohan, Seyfried, Chabert, Daniel Franzese and Rajiv Surendra, reunited for the first of many Walmart Black Friday marketing campaigns.\n\nThe ad featured Cady Heron (Lohan) as the school guidance counselor, Karen Smith (Seyfried) as a weather reporter and Gretchen Wieners (Chabert) as the mom of one of the new popular girls in the school.\n\nThe retail giant will continue to release new commercials featuring the cast every Wednesday leading up to Black Friday and Cyber Monday on Nov. 27."
