        "text": "Gretchen Wieners is one of the main characters in Mean Girls. She is portrayed by Lacey Chabert in the movie, and Ashley Park in the musical. Gretchen is a member of the Plastics. She is the gossip girl in the group and the loyal sidekick of Regina George. She comes from an extremely rich family, as her father is the inventor of Toaster Strudel.\n\nThrough the entire movie, Gretchen is shown to be one of the nicer members of the Plastics, only being mean-spirited under the influence of Regina. Gretchen is also the only person that knows almost all of Regina's family secrets such as the fact that her parents are having issues and that Regina secretly got a nose job at some point during her teenage years.\n\nGretchen continuously tries to make a slang term, fetch, happen, even though everyone around her is annoyed by it. She has also shown to be really nice in certain situations, such as the moment she met Cady Heron and admired her bracelet.\n\nHowever, she can also be very pessimistic and downright negative, as she's always been self-conscious about her looks and keeps comparing herself to other girls in school.\n\nAfter the break-up of the Plastics toward the end of her Junior year, Gretchen eventually joined the Cool Asians clique of North Shore High School.\n\nAppearance\n\nGretchen has shoulder length brunette hair, and she is the only brunette in the Plastics. She has Hazel eyes and wears makeup throughout the film, significantly more than her fellow Plastics. Her outfit in the promotion is a pink long-sleeved shirt that exposes her midriff, a brown and beige checkerboard pattern miniskirt, and black ankle-strap sandal heels.\n\nShe mentions that she enjoyed wearing hoop earrings as a personal accessory for quite some time, but was forced to give them up by Regina, after the latter claimed that is was 'her thing'.\n\nAfter joining the Cool Asians clique, Gretchen's hair is straightened down. Finally, she's also wearing her beloved hoop earrings.\n\nGretchen's hair was described by Damien, to be \"so big because it is full of secrets,\" when Cady gets introduced to the plastics for the very first time.\n\nIn the original script, Gretchen was described as scrawny and unattractive with a whiny and snivelling face. She was said to only be in The Plastics due to her nice clothes. However, she was changed to be described as beautiful in the movie when her actress was cast. Regina’s belief that Gretchen is not pretty comes from this.\n\nRelationships\n\nShe had a boyfriend called Jason, but he seems to enjoy making her jealous, as he brought a friend who might have had a crush on him, Taylor Wedell, to Cady's get-together. However, Jason and Gretchen make out in Cady’s bathroom and it seems they do care about each other.\n\nIn Mean Girls (musical), Jason like to play girls, even she already have girlfriend, in Cady Party, Gretchen ask Jason if what he's thinking about, But Jason steal a little glance on the girls before looking away and look at Gretchen.\n\nIn The ending of Musical, Jason flirt with the \"Girl\", not knowing it was Gretchen, they ended breaking up.\n\nShe is best friends with Karen Smith and frequently watches out for her. For example, when Karen admits to her that she has kissed her first cousin Seth, she tries to help Karen understand that it's wrong to be romantically involved with someone with whom you share relations. When Regina calls her a slut, Gretchen seems to feel bad for her and takes it upon herself to tell Karen. When Gretchen, Cady, and Karen are sent to the principal's office for the Burn Book, Gretchen does not tell on Karen or Cady. She seems to accept Karen's apology, and in return, Karen is the only girl to catch Gretchen when she does her trust fall off the table.\n\nHer relationship with Regina is a complicated one. While it is clear that Regina has confided a large amount of personal secrets in Gretchen, Gretchen often ends up spilling them without meaning to. After a slip up, she always says, \"Don't tell Regina I told you that.\"\n\nRegina is overly controlling and Gretchen is clingy, willing to do anything to keep Regina's trust and friendship. For example, she promised Cady she would keep her attraction to Regina's former boyfriend a secret, but gives the information over to her without a second thought. She gave up wearing hoop earrings when Regina told her she must, going so far as to turn down a pair of expensive white gold ones her parents gave her for Hanukkah.\n\nShe knows that Regina cheats on Aaron Samuels with Shane Oman, and seems to feel remorseful about it, but never tells anyone until she confesses to Cady. She is distressed, when Cady receives a candy cane from Regina and she does not. At the Winter Talent Show for the plastics performance of Jingle Bell Rock performance, she overreacts when Regina tells her to switch places with Cady, claiming she is \"always\" on Regina's left.\n\nGretchen and Cady Heron became good friends and when Gretchen began falling out with Regina she and Cady confided in each other. After Regina lost her status as Queen Bee to Cady, all of Gretchen’s loyalty switched to Cady.\n\nWhen performing, there is visible space between her and the other Plastics, as though Regina's \"rejection\" had her unsure of her place in the group. When Regina cried over losing Aaron and claimed no one understood her, Gretchen ran after her saying \"I understand you, please talk to me!\" As Cady says \"The meaner Regina was, the harder Gretchen tried to win her back.\"\n\nSong\n\nQuotes\n\nTrivia\n\nIn the original script, Gretchen was going to be described as conventionally unattractive and only in The Plastics because of her nice clothes. This was changed to Gretchen being a beautiful girl when her actress was cast to play her.\n\nAlso in the original script, when Cady walked in on Gretchen and Jason in Cady’s bathroom, rather than them making out they were originally supposed to be having oral sex. This was changed to just a make out session however.\n\nIt has been confirmed that Gretchen is not a virgin. In a deleted scene, Karen mentioned Gretchen had sex with Jason twice (and they may have done it a third time at Cady’s Get-Together)."
