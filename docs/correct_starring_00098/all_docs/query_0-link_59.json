        "text": "Lacey Chabert and the cast of \"Mean Girls\" have reunited at last.\n\nA new Walmart Black Friday ad shows the \"Plastics\" returning to North Shore High School. Stars Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried, Daniel Franzese and Rajiv Surendra join Chabert in the hilarious marketing campaign.\n\nWatch the full ad spot below:\n\nThe commercial imagines what the lives of the titular mean girls would be like nearly 20 years later. And fans are raving at how spot-on it is.\n\nGretchen Wieners (Chabert) is the parent of a popular girl in the school, and her daughter leads a reincarnation of the \"Plastics\" with a level of tyranny that would make Regina George proud. Cady Heron (Lohan), wielding her traumatic high school experience for good, is now the school guidance counselor. And Karen Smith (Seyfried) is a weather reporter who's just as airheaded as ever.\n\nThe commercial is chockful of references sure to delight fans of the 2004 film.\n\n\"This is going to be so fetch,\" Chabert says while filming her daughter for a TikTok video. \"Stop trying to make fetch happen Mom, it's still not gonna happen,\" her daughter replies.\n\n\"Some things never change,\" Lohan says in a voiceover. \"On Wednesdays, we still wear pink, but now we shop Walmart Black Friday deals.\"\n\nWalmart has more \"Mean Girls\" content coming down the pipeline. A new ad will be released every Wednesday leading up to Black Friday and on Cyber Monday, November 27.\n\nRumors of a \"Mean Girls\" reunion swirled last month when photos of the actresses on set began to circulate.\n\nA sequel to the film by Tina Fey and Mark Waters, which was based on the 2002 book \"Queen Bees and Wannabes\" by Rosalind Wiseman, has been highly anticipated since the release of the iconic original.\n\nIn addition to this series of ads, a film adaptation of the \"Mean Girls\" musical hits theaters on January 12, 2024."
