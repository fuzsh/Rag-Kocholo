        "text": "That’s so fetch.\n\n“Mean Girls” stars Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried, and Lacey Chaber reunited Friday in Los Angeles to reportedly film a Pepsi commercial inspired by the 2004 cult classic film.\n\nPerhaps a Super Bowl commercial is in the works?\n\nLohan, 37, was photographed holing a clutch that read “Plastics Club Member, Est 2004,” with the movie’s famous tagline, “On Wednesdays we wear pink.”\n\nSeyfried, 37, wore a grey blazer, pink blouse, black trousers, and matching boots for the shoot while Chaber, 41, donned a hot pink dress and heels.\n\nThe duo filmed scenes in a convertible and on a football field.\n\nThe Post has contacted reps for Lohan, Seyfried, Chaber, and Pepsi for comment.\n\nNostalgia around the movie has been abundant recently.\n\nOn October 3 — which fans have deemed as “Mean Girls” day thanks to Aaron Samuels (Jonathan Bennett) asking Cady Heron (Lohan) what day it was — fans could watch the entire movie on TikTok for free.\n\nThe “Mean Girls” Broadway musical is also coming to theaters on Jan. 12, 2024.\n\nThe Paramount project was originally intended to stream on Paramount+ but will now received its moment on the big screen instead.\n\nAdapted from the 2018 Broadway production, Reneé Rapp will reprise her breakout role in the upcoming film as Regina George.\n\n“Mean Girls” stage and screen writer Tina Fey will continue on as Ms. Norbury and “Saturday Night Live” alum Tim Meadows will return as Principal Duval.\n\nThe new movie’s cast also stars Angourie Rice, Auli’i Cravalho, Jaquel Spivey, Jenna Fischer, Busy Philipps, Avantika, Mahi Alam, Christopher Briney, Bebe Wood, Ashley Park, Connor Ratliff and Jon Hamm."
