        "text": "It’s here. We finally have the Mean Girls reunion we’ve been waiting roughly twenty years for. It may have come in the form of a Walmart commercial, but hey, we’ll take it.\n\nIn an incredible turn of events, the retail chain tapped the original cast of Tina Fey’s Mean Girls for their annual Black Friday extravaganza. Featuring Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried and Lacey Chabert reprising their roles as Plastics, Cady Heron, Karen Smith and Gretchen Wieners,\n\nFans will also rejoice in seeing other familiar faces in Daniel Franzese, who played Damien, and Rajiv Surendra, known better as the OG ‘Math Enthusiast/Bad-Ass MC’, Kevin Gnapoor.\n\nIn the two-minute commercial, a heap of iconic moments from the film were revisited, only this time, the girls are all grown up. Cady is now the guidance counsellor at North Shore High School, Gretchen is the ‘Cool Mom’ with a “STRDLGRL” number plate, and Karen is, well, still the psychic weather girl with a fifth sense. Set to songs off the original soundtrack, Missy Elliot makes a cameo as the new Physical Education teacher after Coach Carr.\n\nAs they usher in the next generation of Plastics taking on ‘Jingle Bell Rock’ at the talent show, the trio deal with the mayhem incited by news of deals dropping. And from the looks of things, it seems Damien did get his pink shirt back.\n\nWhile it’s enough to bring some joy to our weeks, fans desperate for a reboot or sequel may be in luck. In a conversation between Lohan and Seyfried for Interview magazine, the actresses agreed that they’d love to take on their roles again.\n\n“I would kill just to do one week, all of us playing our own roles on Mean Girls on Broadway,” Seyfried said, referring to the play iteration.\n\nSeyfried then coyly inquired about the chances of a sequel.\n\n“Because a Mean Girls 2 is never going to happen, is it?” she asked.\n\n“I don’t know. I heard something about it being a movie musical, and I was like, ‘Oh no,’” Lohan explained. “We can’t do that. It has to be the same tone.”\n\nCall us wishful, but we’d say it’s a promising step towards getting the gang back together.\n\nWatch the full video below."
