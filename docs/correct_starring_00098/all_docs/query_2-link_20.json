The film is responsible for creating iconic lines including, “On Wednesdays, we wear pink” and “Is butter a carb?” But when Aaron Samuels (Jonathan Bennett) innocently asked Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan), “What day is it?” and she replied, “It’s October 3,” no one could have predicted it would become the movie’s unofficial holiday. “And as I sat there on October 3rd, I realized no one else on the planet will ever understand how weird it is to be me today,” Bennett wrote via Instagram in October 2021, sharing a clip of himself at the airport.

She also had a recurring role on Ugly Betty and released two albums, Speak in 2004 and A Little More Personal (Raw) in 2005. The former child star, however, became a tabloid magnet due to her partying, substance abuse issues, family drama and romantic relationships. She has since made a comeback with a short-lived MTV reality series, Lindsay Lohan Beach Club, and released a song, called “Xanax,” in September 2019. She briefly served as a judge on the Australian version of The Masked Singer in 2019 and launched a new business venture called #BeYourOwnBoss in September 2020. Lohan made her acting return in Netflix's Falling for Christmas, which premiered in November 2022.\n\nLohan has had many high-profile romances post-Mean Girls. She notably dated Samantha Ronson on-and-off from 2008 to 2009 and was briefly engaged to Egor Tarabasov in 2016. Lohan got engaged to businessman Bader Shammas in November 2021. The twosome said “I do” in July 2022. Less than one year later, Lohan told Us Weekly in March 2023 that she and Shammas were expecting their first child together. Lohan’s rep confirmed to Us in July 2023 that the couple welcomed a baby boy, Luai.\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nTina Fey (Ms. Norbury)\n\nFey’s career blasted off following the success of Mean Girls.

She continued to appear in movies including Baby Mama, Date Night, Sisters and Wine Country. She then created more projects under her Little Stranger production company such as Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Busy Tonight. Additionally, she published her memoir, Bossypants, in 2011.

The SNL alum created Peacock’s Girls5eva series, which premiered in May 2021.

He starred in a one-man show, I’ve Never Really Made the Kind of Money to Become a Mess, in 2013 and became an art curator.\n\nFranzese proposed to his boyfriend Joseph Bradley Phillips in 2016 after two years of dating, but they called it quits in 2018.\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nAmy Poehler (Mrs. George)\n\nPohler’s star power continued to rise as she appeared in films including Blades of Glory, Baby Mama and The House.
