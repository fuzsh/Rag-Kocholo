        "text": "Highest Rated: 84% Anastasia (1997)\n\nLowest Rated: 7% Dirty Deeds (2005)\n\nBirthday: Sep 30, 1982\n\nBirthplace: Purvis, Mississippi, USA\n\nMost Hollywood child actors grow up while the whole world watches. A fine example was hardworking and talented Lacey Chabert. Best known for playing Claudia Salinger on the hit FOX network drama, \"Party of Five\" (1994-2000), Chabert was not alone in making her name for herself courtesy of this endearing series. The show also launched the careers of \"Lost\" (ABC, 2004-10) star Matthew Fox; \"Ghost Whisperer\" (CBS, 2004-10) lead Jennifer Love Hewitt; and Neve Campbell, who went on to big screen success with the \"Scream\" (1996) franchise. But it was Chabert's highly emotional preteen role of Claudia that won everyone's hearts for six seasons. The fact that the young actress later blossomed into a shapely adult beauty was also not lost on fans, who had a hard time believing their little Claudia had finally grown up - enough to adorn the cover of Maxim magazine.\n\nHighest rated movies\n\n84% Mean Girls\n\n33% Sherman's Way\n\n33% A New Wave\n\n31% Not Another Teen Movie\n\n28% Ghosts of Girlfriends Past\n\n27% Daddy Day Care\n\n27% Lost in Space\n\n14% Black Christmas\n\nPhotos\n\nLacey Chabert Lacey Chabert at arrivals for Hallmark Channel TCA 2019 Winter Party - Part 2, Tournament House, Pasadena, CA February 9, 2019.
