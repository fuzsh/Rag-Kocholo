From Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams to Amanda Seyfried, Lacey Chabert and Jonathan Bennett – their roles, relationships and ventures in 2024\n\nSTORYCarolina Malis\n\nJan 19 , 2024\n\n“On Wednesdays, we wear pink.” If this line immediately takes you back to the corridors of North Shore High School, you’re not alone. Released in 2004, Mean Girls gifted pop culture with a lexicon of unforgettable quotes and memes.\n\nIts influence extends far beyond the big screen too. From Ariana Grande recreating scenes from the movie in her “Thank U, Next” music video, to former US president Barack Obama sharing a picture of his dog with the caption “Bo, stop trying to make fetch happen” on X, formerly Twitter, the film has definitely etched itself into the fabric of our cultural consciousness.\n\nWith the new Mean Girls film out on January 12 – this time led by the talented Renée Rapp – it’s the perfect time to catch up with the original Plastics and find out where life has taken them.\n\nLindsay Lohan\n\nLindsay Lohan, 37, known for her role as the sharp yet naïve Cady Heron, has mirrored her character’s dramatic arc in real life. After her rise to fame, the actress faced personal challenges, addiction battles and intense scrutiny, but she has made a remarkable comeback.\n\nLohan then stepped into the business world, opening a nightclub in Athens in 2016, and two Greek island beach clubs in 2018. She shone in Netflix’s Falling for Christmas in 2022, reminding audiences of her versatility as an actress. The same year, she married financier Bader Shammas, and gave birth to a son in July last year.\n\nRachel McAdams\n\nRachel McAdams, 45, unforgettable as Mean Girls’ Regina George, has thrived in Hollywood in the years since. She’s captivated audiences in a variety of roles, in films including The Notebook and Spotlight.\n\nNext spring, McAdams is set to make her Broadway debut in Mary Jane, marking a new milestone in her career. Off screen, she is known for her environmental activism and her efforts to bring attention to social issues. She is married and has two children with screenwriter Jamie Linden.\n\nAmanda Seyfried\n\nKnown for her portrayal of the lovably naïve Karen Smith, Amanda Seyfried, 38, has showcased her versatility in the years since Mean Girls, taking on a wide range of roles. From the musicals Mamma Mia! and Les Misérables to starring as disgraced Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes in The Dropout, Seyfried has earned critical acclaim and won more than 20 awards.\n\nOff screen, Seyfried is an advocate for mental health and animal rights. She is married to Life in Pieces actor Thomas Sadoski, with whom she shares two children.\n\nLacey Chabert\n\nLacey Chabert, 41, portrayed Gretchen Wieners, the girl forever trying to make “fetch” happen. Since her days at North Shore High, Chabert has found her niche in the realm of Hallmark movies and their heart-warming narratives, starring in a wide array of romantic comedies and holiday films.\n\nBeyond acting, Chabert has lent her voice to several animated series too, from children’s cartoons to video games, displaying her range and talent across different facets of the industry. She is married and has one daughter.\n\nJonathan Bennett\n\nJonathan Bennett, 42, remembered as Aaron Samuels, has stayed active in the entertainment world. He’s hosted cooking shows, appeared in various TV movies, and has become a prominent figure in the LGBTQ+ community, using his platform to make an impact in and out of the entertainment world.\n\nBennett has also wrote a Mean Girls-themed cookbook in homage to his role in the film. He is married to Celebrity Page host Jaymes Vaughan.\n\nThe Y2K movie’s impact continues to be felt 20 years later, with everyone from Ariana Grande to Barack Obama making references, and the remake starring Renée Rapp smashing the box office\n\nLindsay Lohan made a comeback in Netflix film Falling for Christmas, Amanda Seyfried won an Emmy portraying Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes in The Dropout – so what about the rest?"
