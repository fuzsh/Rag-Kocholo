        "text": "Gretchen Wieners is back, and she's got a whole new clique in the latest \"Mean Girls\" Walmart ad.\n\nWalmart released the second installment Wednesday of its Black Friday ads centered around the 2004 teen comedy, this time featuring Gretchen Wieners (Lacey Chabert) and a guest appearance from Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried).\n\nCady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) narrates the ad, as she did the film, which sees Gretchen playing stage mom during a typical school day.\n\n\"Oh, sweetie, it's Wednesday, you're wearing sweatpants,\" Gretchen tells her teen daughter, both dressed in pink, upon entering the kitchen. Of course, wearing sweatpants is a no-no for \"Mean Girls.\" But the teen tells her mom that she plans to shop online all day for Walmart deals.\n\nGretchen plans to gift her daughter white gold hoop earrings for Hanukkah, but is quickly informed that white gold is \"giving 2004.\"\n\n\"Irregardless, I don't think your grandfather, the inventor of Toaster Strudel, would be too pleased to hear you using that tone with me,\" Gretchen quips back.\n\nDriving the kids to North Shore High School, Gretchen's cool points continue to dwindle as she calls Kelis' \"Milkshake\" a \"bop.\"\n\nSeyfried returns as Karen and asks Gretchen over the phone whether she thinks \"the girl in the mirror can see you back\" while testing her reflection. \"Karen, we've talked about this,\" Gretchen says.\n\nWith the school day over, Gretchen sits down for dinner with her three children and husband, who departs from his \"regular chair\" to sit on her left, when Gretchen characteristically begins to freak out.\n\n'Mean Girls' stars Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried and Lacey Chabert reunite in Walmart ad\n\n\"Mom, chill,\" her daughter says. Gretchen, now noticing the teen is wearing headphones, shouts, \"If you can't take your headphones out, you can't sit with us!\"\n\nWalmart debuted the \"Mean Girls\" themed ads last week in a commercial that introduced three of the film's main characters all grown up."
