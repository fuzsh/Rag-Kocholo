        "text": "Fey's general scenario — loosely inspired by Rosalind Wiseman's 2002 best-seller Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends and Other Realities of Adolescence — hasn't changed much from its 2004 incarnation. At its heart, this is still the Cady vs. Regina show, and Janis, Damian, Karen, Gretchen, and the rest of the students (and teachers) at North Shore High School are stuck squarely between the two of them.\n\nWhile that is expected, the thing about this film that shocked me was how little I connected to anyone and how what they did — or were going through — resonated with me even less. There is a choppiness here that makes it difficult for scenes to symbiotically coexist with those that surround them. Character evolution either happens in fits and starts or doesn't materialize at all. The music shines and many of the set pieces are impressive (especially one featuring Cravalho after the revelation of The Plastics' \"Burn Book\" rips North Shore apart), and yet almost none of it made a meaningful impression.\n\nOn the plus side, Rapp and Cravalho are undeniably \"grool.\" They have a cinematic magnetism that leaps off the screen. While Rapp will never replace McAdams, the wonderful thing in this is that she doesn't even try to. She tackles many of Regina's signature lines with a reading that's entirely her own. Better, she brings an internalized pathos to the teenage titan I wasn't anticipating. This gives Regina a sympathetic underpinning that helps make her final confrontations with Cady more compelling than they otherwise would have been.\n\nAs for Cravalho, she's sensational. The young actor makes mincemeat out of any opportunity to take center stage that Janis gets. Cravalho rages against the machine with a burning intensity that engulfs everything with a flame of awesomeness that borders on the atomic. As mentioned, it sucks that her character tends to be something of an afterthought, especially as Janis has a great, progressively timely backstory that comes tantalizingly close to being worth crowing about.\n\nAnd yet, I wanted more. Jayne and Perez Jr. can't maintain a consistent pace, and the haphazard ways in which the proceedings come to a grinding halt at the most inopportune times drove me batty. They reproduce signature scenes from the original — like the climactic mathlete competition, this time with a special guest cleverly emceeing the proceedings —but they don't mean anything. They make almost no impact.\n\n\"Fetch\" still isn't happening. No matter how successful it may have been on Broadway, the same can't be said about this new Mean Girls. I wish I could bake the film a cake filled with rainbows and smiles and everyone would eat and be happy, but that's not the case. Heck, I'm pretty sure we don't even go to the same school."
