Lacey Chabert, who starred as Gretchen Wieners in 2004’s Mean Girls, is opening up about her reunion with former co-stars Lindsay Lohan and Amanda Seyfried for Walmart’s Black Friday ads.

The actress told Yahoo Entertainment, in an interview published online Wednesday, that filming the commercials “was even more fun than it looked.”

“It was a really special day to be with Lindsay and Amanda again and to reminisce about the experience we had together, which is just so unique, and to catch up with each other,” Chabert added. “We’re all moms now! It was really a full-circle moment.”

Walmart recruited much of the original cast, including Lohan, Seyfried, Chabert, Daniel Franzese and Rajiv Surendra, to star in a Black Friday marketing campaign. Throughout the month of November, the retail giant is releasing new commercials featuring the cast every Wednesday leading up to Black Friday and Cyber Monday on Nov. 27.

In the latest ad spot (below), Cady Heron (Lohan) is seen taking on North Shore High School again, only this time as the school guidance counselor. In the video, she finds a “deal book” full of Walmart secrets that has been going around school, which references the iconic “burn book” from the film.

The other ads have also featured Karen Smith (Seyfried) as a weather reporter and Gretchen Wieners (Chabert) as the mom of one of the new popular girls at the school. They have also included several memorable lines and references from the original movie.

As she looks back at filming the comedy classic, Chabert told Yahoo Entertainment that she has nothing but positive memories.

“Whenever I do any project, I hope that it’s going to resonate with people,” the actress said. “So, to have something be so well-received is wonderful.”
