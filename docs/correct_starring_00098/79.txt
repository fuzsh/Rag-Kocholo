This is not a drill: we‚Äôre headed back to the world of Mean Girls, and we have a feeling that it‚Äôs going to be so fetch. üíñ

Mean Girls has been a cultural phenomenon since its theatrical release in 2004, starring Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Amanda Seyfried, and Lacey Chabert. The teen flick‚Äôs hilarious one-liners have been referenced time and time again, and even spawned a Broadway musical adaptation by its original writer and producer, Tina Fey and Lorne Michaels, in 2017.

Now, the Broadway adaptation is being made into a movie for Paramount+, and needless to say, ~the limit does not exist~ on our excitement. The script of this new movie is in good hands with Tina Fey, who is returning to the world of The Plastics once again after writing the screenplay for 2004‚Äôs Mean Girls and the on-stage script of Mean Girls the Musical.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm very excited to bring Mean Girls back to the big screen,‚Äù Tina Fey wrote in a 2020 statement. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been incredibly gratifying to see how much the movie and the musical have meant to audiences. I‚Äôve spent 16 years with these characters now. They are my Marvel Universe and I love them dearly.‚Äù

If you weren‚Äôt able to catch any of the Broadway performances in New York City before the show stopped during the COVID-19 pandemic, this upcoming film is the perfect chance to see Cady, Regina, Janis, and other characters come to life musically. Here‚Äôs everything we know about the Mean Girls musical movie, from its cast to its release date.

What is the plot of Mean Girls?

This musical movie will be based on both the Tony-nominated Broadway show and the cult-favorite O.G. Mean Girls movie, so we can assume that the plot will be similar to both.

The 2004 chick-flick classic follows Cady Heron, a new student at North Shore High School who recently moved to Illinois from Africa, as she learns to navigate the tricky waters of cliques, shopping malls, walking in high heels, and figuring out where to sit in the cafeteria. Cady is quickly adopted by a popular group of girls known as The Plastics (Regina, Gretchen, and Karen) but her friends Janis and Ian persuaded her to sabotage them after they discover that Cady likes Regina‚Äôs ex-boyfriend, Aaron Samuels. Through a series of mistakes, Cady learns that although there‚Äôs a reason The Plastics received their shallow nickname, she‚Äôs not innocent in her efforts to take them down, either.

However, Rene√© Rapp (Regina George) explained to Us, "A lot of it is different. Tina is such a creative genius and such a creative freak, and her partner, Jeff Richmond, who does all of the music, is as well. So there‚Äôs definitely different things." Rapp continued, ‚ÄúThere might be different songs. Some songs that are in the musical version might be in the movie or might not be.‚Äù

It seems like the plot of the new movie is in good hands, though, because Rapp praised Tina Fey and Jeff Richmond for adapting the plot to "work with young people and people that are of the current culture." She concluded, "Some things are different, some things are the same.‚Äù

Who is in the Mean Girls musical movie cast?

It was announced in December 2022 that Angourie Rice (Honor Society, Black Mirror, Spider-Man: Far From Home), Auli‚Äôi Cravalho (Moana, The Little Mermaid Live!, Crush), Jaquel Spivey (A Strange Loop) and ReneeÃÅ Rapp (The Sex Lives of College Girls) have been cast in the upcoming musical movie.

Angourie plays Cady Heron, Auli‚Äôi stars as Janis Ian, Jaquel portrays Damian Hubbard, and ReneeÃÅ ‚Äî who was part of the Mean Girls Broadway cast! ‚Äî takes on the iconic role of Regina George once more.

On December 10, 2022, Rene√© posted a throwback photo to announce that she will reprise her role as the iconic Mean Girls character in its upcoming musical movie adaptation. ‚Äúmean girls is one of the biggest reasons why I am where I am. it‚Äôs an honor. tina, jeff, lorne, eric and 2019 mean girls fans, I love you,‚Äù she wrote in her caption.

In February 2023, the cast was expanded once more. Avantika Vandanapu (Senior Year) and Bebe Wood (Love, Victor) will star as Karen Smith and Gretchen Wieners, respectively, while Christopher Briney (The Summer I Turned Pretty) will play Aaron Samuels. Deadline later revealed that The Office star Jenna Fischer will portray Ms. Heron, Cady Heron‚Äôs mom (portrayed by Saturday Night Live star Ana Gasteyer in the 2004 flick) and Busy Phillips will star as Mrs. George, Regina George‚Äôs mother (originally played by Amy Poehler).

On March 22, Deadline broke the news that up-and-coming actor Mahi Alam (American Born Chinese, New Amsterdam) has been cast as our Mathlete king Kevin G. Additionally, Connor Ratliff (Dead Eyes, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel) will play the role of Mr. Rapp, a teacher at North Shore High. Mr. Rapp is a new character that wasn‚Äôt in the original film or musical, so we‚Äôre eager to see how he plays a role in this new story.

The latest casting news arrived on March 24, when The Hollywood Reporter announced that Jon Hamm (Mad Men, Top Gun: Maverick) is slated to play Coach Carr, North Shore‚Äôs gym teacher, in the film. The role was not included in the musical adaptation, but is featured in the original movie for a limited number of scenes.

Lorne Michaels will produce the new film with Tina Fey, who is writing the screenplay. Like the Broadway adaptation, music will be written by Jeff Richmond with lyrics by Nell Benjamin.

Will any of the original cast members be coming back?

Rumor has it that all four of the O.G. Plastics ‚Äî Lindsay Lohan, Lacey Chabert, Amanda Seyfried, and Rachel McAdams ‚Äî are interested in returning to the Mean Girls world with appearances in the new movie.But Page Six reports that negotiations have been stalled due to disagreements over salary. A ‚Äúhighly placed production source‚Äù explained, ‚ÄúParamount Pictures doesn‚Äôt want to pay the girls what they are worth. All four girls were willing to come back, but Paramount has not been respectful of what they are worth."

McAdams commented on the new movie in a recent interview with Bustle, saying, "I don't see a way to shoehorn us in." But not all hope is lost, because the actress added that she's willing to take on the project if Tina Fey can come up with a creative way to include her. "If Tina can figure it out, I'm there, for sure," she said.

Jonathan Bennett, who played Aaron Samuels in the original movie, has also teased potentially returning for the new project. "There's some talks going on about certain things," he exclusively told PEOPLE at the 34th GLAAD Media Awards. "Let's just say that."

Bennett added, "[It was] fun to be a part of a movie like Mean Girls, where so many people have such a good reaction and such a heartwarming feeling when they think about our movie, because it changed their lives in so many ways. It changed my life."

It has been confirmed that Tina Fey and Tim Meadows will reprise their roles as Ms. Norbury and Principal Duvall. ‚ÄúTeachers work forever,‚Äù quipped Fey on Late Night With Seth Meyers.
