Her paternal family belongs to Russian and Polish nobility from the Don Region (Russia) and Poland (Krakow). According to “Onomastikon” by prof. Veselovsky, her paternal side of the family has also ancient Persian roots. Her ancestors include: Alexander Hanzhonkov (the founder of Russian cinematography), Count Nikolay Raevsky (a Russian general and statesman who achieved fame for his feats of arms during the Napoleonic wars), Antoni Malczewski (famous Polish writer, bright representative of Polish romanitism) and Jacek Malczewski (Polish painter). On her mother’s side from Mazur Polish family as well as Poniatowsky, “on the other side of the blanket”.\n\nEducation\n\nKarina’s education began at the UNESCO School in Kiev. She also graduated from Angwin High School in California, USA and was educated privately in Paris, France. She was later enrolled at the National Taras Shevtchenko University of Ukraine. Currently she holds major degrees of BA, MBA in Translation, Interpreting, World Literature and Pedagogics, and PhD in Folkloristics. To discover more about the French language and culture she attended Nice Summer University. Later, she graduated twice with honors from a school organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine and became qualified in Translation, Guide-Interpreting, Protocol and Etiquette. Karina is a native Russian and Ukrainian speaker and is fluent in both English and French. Princess Karina is a life-long learner. She also understands several other European languages.\n\nAccomplishments in Science\n\nKarina had made a name for herself in Humanities and Pedagogics. She had dreamt of learning more about Scotland ever since she read old Celtic legends at primary school. So, no wonder, her PhD was the first research done in Ukraine on the basis of “History-Fiction” used by W.Scott and R.Burns and their inter-relation with Ukrainian historical and cultural heritage. In short, Karina’s thesis deals with the problem of coexistence and the combination of Christian and Celtic mythology and history in works of Walter Scott and Robert Burns. Karina is the author of numerous scientific articles. She participates actively in various scientific events and projects both in her native country and abroad. A former sportswoman, Karina is also the author of a book titled “Olympic Games”. The book aims to ingrain the universal Olympic values while teaching foreign languages and culture.\n\nCareer\n\nAfter the completion of her university degree, Karina took a position at National Taras Shevtchenko University of Ukraine. Her career path continued with a position of a private networker and an international consultant for high net worth individuals. Her Highness travels extensively in Europe and, in particular, to her father’s homeland in France.\n\nLove Story\n\nDimitry and Karina fell in love and married when they were quite young. Karina was introduced to H.S.H.Prince Dimitry Bagration-Moukhransky at a Gala event organized by Russian Nobility Assemblyin Kiev, Ukraine. The Prince and Karina began their love affair soon after. After almost a 2 year courtship, Prince Dimitry, on bended knee, presented the future princess with a diamond engagement ring. Their engagement, which took both Karina’s family and royal watchers by surprise, was officially revealed in June 2002.On 25 October 2003, on the occasion of her marriage to His Serene Highness Prince Dimitry Bagration-Moukhransky she became Her Serene Highness Princess Karina Bagration-Moukhransky.\n\nBoth the marriage ceremony and the wedding festivities took place in Kiev, Ukraine with the presence of Russian Nobility Assembly representatives and international aristocracy. Karina did not change her religious affiliation after the wedding.By the summer of 2009, rumors were circulating that her marriage to Prince Dimitry had gone sour. To the endless regret, the rumors proved to be true. Later, Their Serene Highnesses announced separation and eventual intention to divorce. Despite all, Karina managed to stand difficult times with dignity and currently supports numerous international initiatives, helping women to overcome the post-divorce syndrome and regain self-esteem.\n\n“Lady Diana of the Eastern Europe”?"
