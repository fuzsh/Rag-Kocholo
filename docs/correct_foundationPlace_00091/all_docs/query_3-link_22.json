        "text": "Taking into account the ideological responses the Soviet Union offered, in its different phases of existence, to the national question, this study aims to offer a diachronical perspective of Moscow's efforts in order to create a 'Soviet people'. Kenneth Jowitt's concept, 'the Moscow centre', applies to the whole socialist camp, both the USSR and to the rest of the communist states loyal to Moscow; however, in the present paper, I have carried out a risky enterprise, and limited it only to the territory of the former USSR, more exactly, to the relation between Moscow and the nationalities and/or ethnies of the Soviet Union, most of them dispersed trough the remote regions of the country and only a part of them having their own federative republic. Recognizing the imperilous potential which the nationalities might have with reference to the Soviet Union as a state, the communists tried both ideologically and politically, to 'forge' a Soviet supranational identity able to overcame this thorny problem. Officially, the Russians also must have 1 The syntagm was borrowed from Jowitt: 1992, p. 159 2 This paper was initially presented at the 2008 edition of the 'Ideologies, values and political behaviors in Central and Eastern Europe' conference, which took place between 5 and 6 of December at the West University of Timișoara. Its previous title was Cohesion or destabilization? Controversial aspects regarding the influence of the Russian Federation on its 'near abroad', where I also took into account the national problems of the former Soviet Union. Finally, I decided to concentrate on the Soviet Union exclusively. The research needed to conceive this paper was partially facilitated by an AMPOSDRU grant which I received from Babeș Bolyai University for the whole duration of my doctoral studies. Political Science Forum renounced their national identity in favor of the Soviet melting pot; in practice, however, the non-Russians were always oppressed by the dominant nationality, although this fact was not ideologically and constitutionally visible. This was one of the main causes which, in combination with others, led to the undermining and finally to the disintegration of the Soviet Union.\n\nRussia and the World in the Modern Age: Regional Space and Transcontinental Routes In the third volume of his majestic work Civilisation and Capitalism, 15th-18th Centuries,(est-ce la traduction officielle ? Il manque “matérielle” et “économie”) Fernand Braudel confirmed that, notwithstanding its numerous and long-established contacts with Europe, China, India, Persia and the Ottoman Empire, Russia constitutes “an autonomous world-economy” in the modern age. From the sixteenth to the nineteenth century, Russia built an empire, which was marked by territorial continuity and incorporated European and Asian regions into its sphere of domination that were both densely and sparsely populated and had the common feature of acting as bridges between a Russian world in the process of consolidation and unequally wealthy, powerful and ‘developed’ external worlds. In the twentieth century, the Soviet empire rediscovered the pivotal role of these borders and, moreover, the internationalist project that emerged in 1917 laid the groundwork for the establishment of a continental Eurasian identity. Remarkably, the pages devoted to Russia by Braudel echo the geopolitical tensions that have pervaded the contemporary Russian space since the 1990s, in particular when they are linked to the two reference spaces of Europe and the Russian-Soviet empire in its various historical extensions. We know that Braudel generated crucial impetus in terms of focusing attention for the first time on space and territory in the study of social and human phenomena. Based on the traditional interaction between history and geography, this enabled the French social sciences to play an important role in the innovative spatial turn movement. A considerable distance has been covered since then in the interdisciplinary consideration of territorial factors in the field of public policies – international relations, economics, urbanism, migration etc. The work done on the historical and cultural dynamics of territorialization by the Cluster of Excellence ‘Territorial and Spatial Dynamics’ (LabEx DynamiTe), to which the three authors of this introduction belong, is evidence of this. It is in this context that this project involving a collective examination of the question of the Russian territory both in the light of recent research and from a long-term perspective emerged. In view of its key role in the economic and diplomatic relations between the East and West, this territory is considered a place of both integration and opening. The articles that bookend this publication set out to situate the Russian space and its relationship with the world in the modern period in an epistemological context spanning both geography and history as written about since the 1960s."
