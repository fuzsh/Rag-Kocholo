        "text": "Geneticists at two San Diego organizations have emerged as key players in an international effort to save the Tasmanian devil, a ferocious meat-eating marsupial that is being decimated by a mysterious type of contagious cancer.\n\nThe work also promises to shed a broader light on cancers in humans and the way epidemics spread through populations.\n\nThe San Diego life sciences company Illumina said last week it has completed a female devil’s full genome sequence for a British research center that is working to save a species threatened with extinction within two decades.\n\nAt the same time, Vanessa Hayes, a professor of genomic medicine at the J. Craig Venter Institute in Torrey Pines, completed the sequencing of two other devils about two months ago.\n\nThe researchers are hoping that the genetic information will give them important clues behind grotesque facial tumors that have been spreading across the Tasmanian devil population since 1997.\n\nThe cancer leaps from one devil to another when the temperamental animals brawl over food or a potential mate, biting each other in the face and transmitting malignant cells from teeth to fresh wounds.\n\nThe cancer is a rare exception from typical tumors, which emerge as an individualistic medical phenomenon inside the body of a person or animal and remain there.\n\nIn just 13 years, the illness has wiped out nearly three quarters of the wild devil population which is isolated to their namesake island off the southern tip of Australia, said Greg Woods, a cancer immunology expert at the University of Tasmania’s Menzies Research Institute in the capital city of Hobart.\n\n“At the moment, there have been no animals exposed to the disease that have survived,” he said.\n\nSeveral people working to save the fox-sized creatures hailed the work by Illumina and Hayes as a major achievement.\n\n“Understanding why these diseases suddenly emerge and spread has huge relevance. The more we understand that, the safer we are,” said Peter Daszak, whose New York nonprofit EcoHealth Alliance works on diseases that threaten animal species.\n\nWith the DNA of three devils fully mapped, researchers have a powerful new tool. They can search for mutations that cause the cancer by comparing the genetic data to sequences of tumors. They can target pathways for drugs that might treat or cure the disease. They can look for genetic markers for diagnosing vulnerability or immunity to the tumors in baby devils.\n\nMore immediately, the genetic information will be used by the Devils in Danger Foundation to identify a genetically diverse group of animals for relocation to a mainland sanctuary 250 miles north of Sydney, Hayes said.\n\nOnce there, the devils will be protected from the scourge so that they can one day help repopulate Tasmania after the disease has been stopped or run its natural course.\n\nHayes started her work on sequencing devils in late 2008 when she was affiliated with the University of New South Wales in Sydney. She joined the J. Craig Venter Institute in July.\n\nWorking with researchers at Pennsylvania State University, Hayes sequenced Cedric, a male devil from the northwestern region of Tasmania which has largely escaped the cancer epidemic so far, and Spirit, a female from the island’s southwestern region.\n\nThe geographic difference was important because Hayes wanted animals with as divergent genetic makeups as possible.\n\nThat’s not easy to achieve because all of the animals trace their ancestry back to a small number of devils that originally populated the island.\n\nCedric was no ordinary marsupial. He became famous in Australia when he failed to develop cancer in 2007 after researchers injected him with cells from another animal’s tumor.\n\nScientists thought Cedric’s apparent immunity would provide the key to developing a cure or vaccine. However, those hopes were dashed last week when the devil was euthanized because of tumors in his lungs tied to a 2008 injection of cells from another strain of the cancer.\n\nResearchers have identified at least a dozen mutations of the cancer so far, Hayes said.\n\nIllumina’s foray into the devil rescue effort started about a year ago, said David Bentley, the company’s chief scientist who works out of the company’s United Kingdom office south of Cambridge.\n\nThe company was asked to sequence a female devil named Salem along with two tumors from other animals for the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, a nonprofit genomic research center also located south of Cambridge.\n\nThe work was performed using Illumina’s HiSeq 2000, a sequencing system introduced in January that greatly increased the speed of genetic mapping and dropped the cost of the work below $10,000.\n\nThe project offered an opportunity to challenge the technology, Bentley said.\n\n“The goal has been to really push the level of DNA sequencing to go beyond re-sequencing individuals from well-known beings, such as humans,” he said.\n\nUsing the new genetic data to study how the devil cancer mutates as it moves among the animals could give researchers new insight into the way human cancers start in one part of the body, such as the breast or lungs, then metastasis and spread into other organs and tissue, Bentley said.\n\n“It creates a very interesting related model,” he said.\n\nOriginally Published: September 19, 2010 at 8:00 p.m.\n\nGeneticists at two San Diego organizations have emerged as key players in an international effort to save the Tasmanian devil, a ferocious meat-eating marsupial that is being decimated by a mysterious type of contagious cancer.\n\nThe work also promises to shed a broader light on cancers in humans and the way epidemics spread through populations.\n\nThe San Diego life sciences company Illumina said last week it has completed a female devil’s full genome sequence for a British research center that is working to save a species threatened with extinction within two decades.\n\nAt the same time, Vanessa Hayes, a professor of genomic medicine at the J.
