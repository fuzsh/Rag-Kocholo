        "text": "Dear Friends and Supporters of Project Safety Net,\n\nSince 2009, Project Safety Net (PSN) has been dedicated to promoting youth mental wellness and suicide prevention. We have positively impacted countless teens and families through community engagement, education, advocacy, and improving access to mental health support.\n\nUnfortunately, we are currently facing significant financial challenges. As a result, the PSN Board took the difficult decision to furlough our staff beginning May 24, 2024 until further notice. Despite this setback, our commitment to our mission remains unwavering. We are actively working on strategic goals and developing a sustainable funding model to ensure the continuity of our essential services.\n\nDuring this period, please note that responses to requests may be slower than usual as we prioritize our limited resources. For urgent inquiries, you can reach us at [email protected]. Our board is available to engage with the community.\n\nWe sincerely appreciate your continued support and understanding as we navigate these challenges. Together, we can continue to make a difference in the lives of the youth we serve.\n\nAshley Raggio and Peter Stone\n\nCo-Chairs\n\nOn behalf of the Project Safety Net Board of Directors\n\nProject Safety Net (PSN) mobilizes community support and resources for youth suicide prevention and mental wellness.
