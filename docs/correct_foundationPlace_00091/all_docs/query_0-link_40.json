        "text": "Tag Archives: Palo Alto Medical Foundation\n\nFrom the The Palo Alto Medical Foundation — Is Veganism for You?\n\nWhat do former President Bill Clinton, Ozzy Osbourne and Ellen de Generes have in common? They’re all vegan. Let’s take a look at this diet and lifestyle, which is becoming more popular.\n\nFor many reasons, some people choose to eliminate all animal products and adopt what’s known as a vegan diet. In 2008, a survey for the Vegetarian Resource Group reported that .5 percent of Americans, or 1 million people, called themselves vegans. The recent documentary, “Forks Over Knives,” has brought new popularity to the vegan diet.\n\nWhat is veganism? It’s strictly defined as the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products in any form. This includes eliminating all animal products from the diet. For strict vegans, who adhere to veganism as a philosophy of treating all living beings ethically, this also means not wearing clothing or shoes made of animal products, including leather, wool and silk.\n\nWhat food can you eat in a vegan diet? Most vegetable dishes are vegan, or can easily made to be so. Plant-based proteins include beans and legumes, tofu and other soy products, and nuts. There are now widely available non-dairy milk substitutes made of soy, almonds and coconut. Soy and nut yogurt and cheese substitutes are also available.\n\nWhat foods are prohibited in a vegan diet? Strict vegans eliminate any food containing meat, seafood, eggs or dairy products (milk, yogurt and butter). They may also avoid honey and gelatin.\n\nWhat are the benefits of the vegan diet? Nutrition research has provided robust evidence that a diet composed mainly of vegetables, fruits and whole grains has great health benefits. Or as Michael Pollan put it, “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.” A large nutrition study known as the China Study proposes that most chronic diseases affecting adults (obesity, heart disease, high cholesterol, diabetes and cancer) can be prevented or reversed by following a vegan diet.\n\nIs there any harm in following a vegan diet? A carefully planned vegan diet can be very healthful, but there are a few micronutrients that aren’t easily obtained from plant sources of food. These include vitamin D, vitamin B12, iron, calcium, and possibly iodine and omega-3 fatty acids. The first two of these will usually need to be taken in vitamin form, but the others can be found in a carefully planned plant-based diet. So long as a diet includes a variety of nuts, soy products and legumes, getting enough protein is usually not an issue.\n\nHelpful resources and websites:\n\nwww.TheChinaStudy.com\n\nForks Over Knives (documentary and book based upon The China Study)\n\nwww.VeganHealth.org (nutrition information written by a vegan registered dietician)\n\nwww.ivu.org/recipes (more than 3,000 vegan recipes from around the world)\n\n— Linda Shiue, M.D.\n\nDr. Linda Shiue is an internal medicine physician at the Redwood Shores Health Center of the Palo Alto Medical Foundation.\n\nThe Palo Alto Medical Foundation and column editor Arian Dasmalchi provide this monthly column.\n\nFrom the The Palo Alto Medical Foundation — Newborn Screening Saves Young Lives\n\nAll new parents should be aware of the importance of the newborn screening test—a simple, routine way to protect your child from potentially life-threatening illness. This blood test can detect diseases that would otherwise not be apparent—in time for them to be treated.\n\nTo understand the newborn screening test, it’s important to look at its history. The test was initially developed to prevent mental retardation by promptly treating a rare disease called phenylketonuria (PKU).\n\nIn 1934, Dr. Asbjorn Folling first recognized PKU—a defect or deficiency in the enzyme that processes phenylalanine. Without an effective enzyme, the buildup of phenylalanine damages the developing nervous system—causing mental retardation and seizures. Doctors could treat infants with this disease by limiting their intake of phenylalanine, a substance found in proteins such as standard infant formula and breast milk. The problem was that the infants were healthy at birth and had no signs of the disease, so doctors and parents didn’t know which children to treat with this restricted diet. Dr. Robert Guthrie solved this problem by developing a simple test, using a drop of blood on filter paper, to test newborns for this disease. This was the birth of the newborn screening test.\n\nThe newborn screening test has expanded significantly, but it still follows the same principle and is conducted similarly. Newborn screens vary by state. In California, blood samples are tested for the following diseases:\n\nMetabolic diseases (including PKU) that makes the body unable to use certain parts of food for energy, growth or repair\n\nEndocrine diseases that cause the body to make too much or too little of a hormone, which can affect growth and development\n\nHemoglobin diseases, which cause anemia by affecting the type or amount of hemoglobin in the red blood cells\n\nCystic fibrosis, a common chronic lung disease in children\n\nAs medicine and genetic research advances, we’re able to identify more genetic diseases. As new tests become available, each new test must undergo a rigorous ethical discussion in order to be included in the newborn screen. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has suggested three key principles for inclusion in newborn screening:\n\nIdentification of the condition must provide a clear benefit to the child.\n\nA system must be in place to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nTreatment and follow up must be available for affected newborns.\n\nFor example, early identification of PKU can result in effective treatment and prevent mental retardation, clearly providing a benefit to the child. A test can confirm PKU and specialty care does exist.\n\nOn the other hand, we have a test for Huntington’s disease, but we have no effective treatment to alter the course of the disease. Therefore, choosing whether or not to test for Huntington’s disease is complex and made on an individual basis considering the potential psychological responses, the possibility for stigma or discrimination, and balancing this against the reduction of uncertainty in knowing whether one carries the gene. For these reasons Huntington’s disease does not meet the IOM standards and is not included on the newborn screening test.\n\nEach state’s newborn screening program periodically reviews screening recommendations as new testing and new treatments become available. At that time these programs consider new additions and the possibility of eliminating certain tests.\n\nTo do a newborn screening test, a health care professional simply collects a few drops of blood from a baby’s heel and sends this sample to the newborn screening lab. Parents are notified if a child needs further evaluation, but it’s important to remember that requiring further screening doesn’t necessarily mean that a child has a disease or is sick.\n\nAll parents should be aware of the newborn screening test—a simple blood test that can save a child’s life.\n\n— By Natasha Leman, M.D.\n\nFrom the The Palo Alto Medical Foundation — Take the Toxins Out of Cleaning\n\nRemember the “Hints from Heloise” newspaper column? She provided simple household advice passed down from mothers and grandmothers whose common ingredients for cleaning, including baking soda and vinegar, came from the kitchen cupboard.\n\nThese types of non-toxic cleaning products are making a comeback. Armed with emerging scientific data on the hazards of synthetic cleaning products, consumers are ready to get back to the basics.\n\nWe now know that as we dust, polish and scrub our way to a “cleaner” house, we may create a harmful mix of chemicals that pollute the indoor air and surfaces and compromise the health of our family and pets. Some products contain toxic substances that can cause harm if inhaled, swallowed or absorbed through the skin. Mixing certain chemical cleaners, such as chlorine bleach and ammonia, can create toxic gases. Extremely high doses of some substances may even cause birth defects or other serious health problems, including brain damage or death.\n\nRecent studies show that many common cleaners and air “fresheners” contain chemicals that can trigger asthma. This includes products such as spray and plug-in air fresheners; toilet cleaners; and laundry products including detergents, fabric softeners and dryer sheets. A recent study published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine showed that people who used cleaning sprays at least once a week were 50 percent more likely to have increased asthma symptoms, wheeze or use asthma medications. Of the products studied, air fresheners, glass cleaners and furniture sprays had the strongest association with asthma.\n\nLess than 10 percent of approximately 100,000 synthetic chemicals produced each year for industry, home and agriculture uses have undergone testing for long-term health effects. Some synthetic chemicals found in cleaning products are not deliberately added, but are carcinogenic byproducts of manufacturing (including formaldehyde and benzene). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not require manufacturers to list chemicals used in product fragrances. In addition, there are no legal requirements for ingredient labeling on household cleaning products.\n\nFragrance-free products are the best solution for those at risk for asthma. This is just a rough guideline since there is no exact definition for “scent-free,” “fragrance-free” or “unscented.” Products labeled as “unscented” may actually contain ingredients to mask the smell of other ingredients.\n\nYou can also try substituting chemical cleaning products with non-toxic alternatives, just like your grandmother or Heloise used to do. For example:\n\nOpen windows or use products scented with essential oils instead of spraying air fresheners.\n\nUse these non-toxic cleaning alternatives:\n\nCastile soap (least toxic, vegetable oil-based)\n\nBaking soda\n\nVinegar\n\nLemons and essential oils\n\nUse this quick recipe for a safe, effective glass cleaner:\n\n2 cups of water\n\n1 cup of distilled vinegar\n\n1 teaspoon of liquid soap\n\nYou can find more non-toxic, natural cleaning and cooking tips in Vicky Lansky’s books Vinegar and Baking Soda.\n\nIf you use chemical cleaning products, keep them in their original containers, keep them out of reach of children, and carefully follow instructions for storage and use. If anyone swallows, inhales or gets a toxic product on their skin, seek immediate medical attention.\n\nListed below are three organizations you can contact with questions or concerns about common household chemicals:\n\nNational Pesticide Information Center, 800-858-7378, www.npic.orst.edu\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, 202-272-0167, www.epa.gov\n\nNational Poison Control Hotline, 800-222-1222, www.poison.org\n\n— Cindy Russell, M.D.\n\nCindy Russell, M.D.\n\nFrom the The Palo Alto Medical Foundation — Local Color You Should Eat\n\nHow many colors did you eat today? March was National Nutrition Month, and the American Dietetic Association introduced the theme “Eat Right with Color.” Colorful foods are loaded with “phytonutrients,” or plant substances that can protect us against cancer, heart disease and other unhealthy effects of aging. The brighter and more intense the colors, the stronger the phytonutrients are in foods. Each color group provides us with different, important nutrients.\n\nWe’re fortunate to live in the Bay Area, where it’s easy to get a variety of fresh, colorful produce all year round. Fruits and vegetables that grow locally are usually picked ripe, and they have more color because they don’t have to be shipped long distances. I get my rainbow of produce by shopping at a farmers’ market and subscribing to Community Supported Agriculture (CSA). CSA enables you to purchase seasonal produce grown at a local farm. Visit www.localharvest.org for more information.\n\nPeople who eat more fruits and vegetables as part of a healthy diet are likely to have a reduced risk of chronic diseases, including stroke, type 2 diabetes, some types of cancer, heart disease and high blood pressure.\n\nHere’s a sampling of what colorful foods that you can find in the local market today:\n\nGo green: Green fruits and vegetables are colored by a natural plant pigment called “chlorophyll,” which contains nutrients “lutein” and “zeaxanthin” believed to help keep your eyes healthy and reduce risk of cataracts and age-related eyesight degeneration. “Indoles,” chemicals found in the cabbage family, may help protect against some types of cancer. Some good green options are Romanesco cauliflower, bok choy, Brussels sprouts, asparagus, dinosaur kale, collards, rapini, kiwis and avocados.\n\nRed rules: Red fruits and vegetables are colored by natural plant pigments called “lycopene” or “anthocyanins.” Lycopene may reduce your risk of several types of cancer, especially prostate cancer, and it may slow the development of atherosclerosis. Anthocyanins can act as powerful antioxidants that protect cells from damage and help keep our hearts healthy, too. Try painting your plate red with strawberries, blood oranges, ruby grapefruit, guavas and beets this week.\n\nBright news about orange and yellow: Orange and yellow fruits and vegetables are usually colored by natural plant pigments called “carotenoids.” Beta-carotene, a well-known carotenoid, is converted to vitamin A, which can help maintain healthy mucous membranes and healthy eyes. Carotenoid-rich foods may help reduce the risk of cancer and heart disease, and benefit your immune system. Some orange and yellow citrus fruits are high in vitamin C, another powerful antioxidant that may reduce the risk of cancers and heart disease. Add a splash of orange and yellow to your diet with carrots, winter squash, oranges, tangerines, and Meyer lemons.\n\nWhite earns its colors: White fruits and vegetables are colored by pigments called “anthoxanthins,” which may help lower cholesterol and blood pressure and reduce the risk of stomach cancer and heart disease. Some white fruits and veggies are good sources of the mineral potassium, too. A few good white choices are parsnips, potatoes, onions, green garlic, crimini mushrooms and pears.\n\nTry true blue (and purple): Blue and purple fruits and vegetables are colored by natural plant pigments called “anthocyanins,” which may act as powerful antioxidants that protect cells from damage. They can help reduce the risk of cancer, stroke and heart disease, and have been associated with boosted memory function and healthy aging. Try adding more blue and purple to your plate with red cabbage, radicchio, purple cauliflower and purple potatoes.\n\nWhen it comes to the produce you put on your plate, go local and diverse with an emphasis on colorful intensity. I hope you’ll use these tips to improve your diet and reap the health rewards offered by colorful fruits and vegetables.\n\n— Darcie Ellyne, M.S., R.D., CDE\n\n— The Palo Alto Medical Foundation and column editor Arian Dasmalchi provide this monthly column.\n\nBuy Safe Toys this Holiday Season\n\nBefore you head out to purchase gifts for the children in your life, there are a few things you should know about toy safety. Well-chosen toys help children develop coordination, imagination and other skills, but inappropriate toys or unsupervised playtime can do more harm than good … and some toys can be dangerous.\n\nEach year, thousands of children suffer toy-related injuries. Below are some toy-selection tips to help minimize risks to children:\n\nSelect toys that are appropriate for the child’s age and interest.\n\nWhen buying for infants or toddlers, avoid toys with small parts. Even the button eyes on a teddy bear can be dangerous to a young child.\n\nWhen choosing toys for infants, avoid those with long strings or chords that may cause strangulation.\n\nFor all children under age 8, avoid toys with sharp edges and points.\n\nAvoid toys that shoot small objects into the air, since they can cause serious eye injuries and choking.\n\nLook for sturdy toy construction. Avoid toys that have small or thin parts that can be broken off.\n\nCheck for toxins or poisons. Buy paint sets, crayons and markers that are labeled nontoxic.\n\nRead all toy labels, and follow instructions.\n\nDiscard all plastic wrappings, which can cause suffocation.\n\nProviding adequate supervision when a child is playing is as important as buying the right toys. Here are some safety tips:\n\nClosely supervise young children while they play.\n\nKeep toys meant for older children out of younger children’s reach.\n\nPlan ahead if you buy cycles, skates or razors. Provide helmets, wrist, elbow and knee guards, and discuss safe areas for riding.\n\nDo not allow young children to use shooting or target toys, chemistry lab sets or electrical toys. Closely supervise older children playing with these toys.\n\nTeach your child to use and store toys properly.\n\nKeep toys in good condition, and repair or replace them when they are damaged.\n\nDo not allow children to play near stairs, hills, traffic and swimming pools.\n\nStore batteries out of reach, since they are toxic and can pose a choking hazard.\n\nHere’s to a happy, healthy holiday season.

With all the parties and family gatherings, it’s easy to nosh on a few too many appetizers, eat an extra plateful at mealtime and sip on several high-calorie beverages.\n\nThe delicious, high-calorie foods and drinks that abound during the holidays make it easy to overindulge. In addition, stress levels tend to be higher during the holiday season — making us more prone to reach for comfort food or another cocktail.\n\nThere are a few things you can do to beat the urge to overindulge in food and drinks during the holiday season.\n\nGet plenty of rest. When you don’t get the proper amount of sleep (eight hours is ideal for most people), the hormones that control your appetite can become off-balance, leading to overeating.\n\nRecognize what causes you to overindulge. Some people overindulge in food and alcohol when they are stressed or “blue,” while others tend to eat or drink too much in social settings. Try to recognize your triggers and put a plan in place. For example, if youÕre feeling blue go for a walk instead of reaching for a cookie, or predetermine how many drinks you’ll have at a party.\n\nDrink water between cocktails. It’s easy to have too many cocktails at a social event. You can slow yourself down by alternating cocktails with sparkling water.\n\nWait a few minutes before reaching for more. It takes our bodies about 20 minutes to process the calories we eat or drink. So if you’re feeling the urge to have a second serving of chips and dip, for example, tell yourself you can have more if you wait for 20 minutes. If you still want it after 20 minutes, you can have it, but in many cases the craving will subside and you’ll end up consuming fewer calories.\n\nDon’t skip meals. If you don’t let yourself get really hungry, you’ll be less likely to binge eat or drink when the opportunities present themselves. Plan regular meals and snacks at approximately the same time each day — about two or three hours apart (three meals and two to three snacks a day). This enables your body to regulate hunger so you’re hungry at mealtimes, but not so hungry that you’ll overindulge. If your stomach is full, but you still have the munchies, reach for low-calorie snacks like air-popped popcorn, raw nuts, or raw veggies with balsamic vinegar or low-calorie dressing.\n\nDon’t be too hard on yourself. When people try to completely avoid the foods they love, they often end up overindulging in them. Allow yourself to have a small piece of pie or cake — but not both. Select one decadent, high-calorie item from the buffet table and then load up the rest of your plate with healthy, low-calorie options.\n\nThese next couple months will be filled with opportunities to overindulge, but if you plan ahead, you can beat the temptation. I hope these practical tips will help you avoid the holiday bulge and enjoy a happy, healthy season.\n\n— Karen Astrachan, M.S., R.D., CDE, CSSD\n\n— The Palo Alto Medical Foundation and column editor Arian Dasmalchi provide this monthly column.\n\nPoison Oak vs. Your Immune System\n\nThe human immune system protects us from all kinds of invaders — from practically invisible viruses, to microscopic bacteria and protozoa, to large parasitic worms. Most of the time our immune system does a great job, attacking invaders and clearing them from our bodies. But sometimes it gets fooled and mistakenly attacks something benign, causing more trouble than benefit. An example of such a mistake is the poison oak rash.\n\nPoison oak’s scientific name is Toxicodendron diversilobum, meaning toxic tree with diverse forms. Poison oak is a leafy plant that grows as both a bush in dense thickets and as a tree-climbing vine. It’s found throughout much of western North America and is common in the open country and hills surrounding the San Francisco Bay. Poison oak has myrtle green leaves in groupings of three in the spring that gradually turn reddish green then crimson over the course of the growing season, as it fruits a white berry. In the winter, only twigs and stems are left, making it especially difficult to identify.\n\nPoison oak produces an oily resin called urushiol, which initiates the itchy rash. Studies show that it takes less than 50 micrograms, which is less than the weight of a grain of table salt, to initiate a rash in 90 percent of humans. Urushiol attaches easily to anything brushed against the leaves or stems of the plant. It can attach directly to skin or first to clothes and subsequently to skin. It’s not uncommon to get the rash from pets that have run through, or sports balls that have bounced into, poison oak bushes. The resin is tremendously stable. Dead plant specimens over 100 years old have been shown to cause the rash. If the plants are burned, for instance when clearing brush, the urushiol can get into the lungs, causing an especially dangerous reaction.\n\nThe rash occurs when some of the urushiol resin gets on and penetrates through the skin to cause a reaction called cell-mediated immunity. This is where our immune system makes the mistake. The molecules in the urushiol attach to the proteins and cells of our own body. This alters the appearance of these proteins and cells. Our own immune system is fooled by this altered appearance into thinking that a foreign invader, for instance a parasitic worm, is trying to enter our body. Our immune system marshals its diverse forces, releasing toxins locally to try to kill or repel the invader. Unfortunately the toxins also damage body tissues, causing the rash.\n\nHow can the rash be avoided? The first and best defense is to know how to recognize the plant and avoid it. If you need to go into an area with these plants, wear long pants and a long-sleeved shirt, and carefully remove and wash these in hot soapy water immediately afterward. If your pet or sports equipment may have contacted poison oak, wear gloves and give them a bath. There is now an over-the-counter product called Ivy Block that, if applied prior to exposure, physically blocks urushiol from attaching to skin.\n\nIf you get the rash, treatments are directed at reducing the local irritation, reducing the itch or stopping the underlying immune system reaction that caused the rash. The local irritation is typically treated with lotions such as calamine, cool water baths with oatmeal or baking soda or cool compresses. The itch can be treated with over-the-counter antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (e.g., Bendryl). Steroid creams or ointments, such as over-the-counter cortisone or more potent prescription strength steroids, can be used to quiet the immune response reaction. In severe cases systemic steroids may be necessary, either in pill form or, rarely, intravenously.\n\nPoison oak is a fact of life in California, especially in the Bay Area. It’s best avoided, but can be an irritating reminder of just how hard our immune systems work to protect us from invaders.\n\n— Bill Black, M.D., Ph.D.\n\n— The Palo Alto Medical Foundation and column editor Arian Dasmalchi provide this monthly column.\n\nFive Get-Fit Diet Tips for After Baby Arrives\n\nWhen a new baby arrives, many moms get lost in the whirlwind of activity that follows. As you count feedings and dirty diapers to make sure your baby is getting enough to eat, don’t forget all about your own dietary and fitness needs.\n\nIt’s important to take care of yourself—for your own good as well as your baby’s. If you feel healthy you’ll likely do a better job caring for your newborn during a time often characterized by sleep deprivation and mental exhaustion.\n\nFollowing are five tips to help you stay focused on your own nutrition and fitness needs after childbirth:\n\nDon’t try to lose your pregnancy weight quickly. Despite what you may see in movies, new moms don’t magically shrink down to their pre-pregnancy size as soon as the baby is delivered. Be patient and remember that it can take up to a year to get back to your pre-pregnancy weight. A crash diet can make baby blues and sleep deprivation feel even worse. Furthermore, if you’re breastfeeding you need extra calories and nutrition for your baby. Making small changes and smarter nutrition choices will help you return to your pre-pregnancy weight in a healthy way.\n\nWatch your food portions. You don’t have to give up your favorite high-calorie foods, but you may need to eat less of them, and less often. A good general rule is to make half your plate vegetables, one-quarter lean protein (poultry, fish or tofu), and one-quarter starch (baked potato, brown rice or whole wheat bread). In addition, limit the amount of calorie-rich and fat-heavy “extras,” such as dressings and sauces made with cream, butter, mayonnaise and oils.\n\nTake help when it’s offered. If friends or family offer to prepare meals for you, let them. It’s a nice (and usually healthier) alternative to take-out or restaurant food. When you do have time to cook, make extra batches and freeze them for later. This way you have an alternative to processed instant foods that are typically higher in calories, salt, sugar and preservatives than food prepared at home with lower-fat cooking methods such as baking, broiling, grilling, roasting or steaming.\n\nDon’t skip meals. If you do, you’re likely to become overly hungry later and overeat or choose less healthy foods. One way to avoid skipping meals is to have your kitchen stocked with healthy convenience foods such as fruits and veggies (preferably washed and ready to eat). Make breakfast a priority, since it’s the most important meal of the day. Chances are you are tired from interrupted sleep, so make it easy for yourself and have healthy yet easy-to-prepare choices in your kitchen, like high-fiber cereal, whole-wheat bread and hard-boiled eggs; or yogurt and fruit.\n\nMake time to exercise. Even a short walk will help you burn calories, which can help with weight loss. Moderate sunlight exposure also helps your body make vitamin D, which helps to absorb calcium and improve bone health.\n\nIn the midst of all the new-baby chaos, don’t forget to take care of yourself. By following these five simple tips you’ll feel better and have more energy to care for your new little bundle.\n\n— Karen Astrachan, MS, RD, CDE, CSSD\n\nThe Skinny on Salt\n\nIf you or one of your family members has high blood pressure, you probably know all about the challenges of avoiding added salt in modern-day prepared foods. Yet salt is critical for life and has always been a critical part of human society.\n\nThe earliest-known pharmaceutical text, the Peng-Tzao-Kan-Mu, written about 5,000 years ago in China, described 40 kinds of salt and their properties. The ancient Greeks traded slaves in exchange for salt, which gave rise to the expression, “not worth his salt.” Marco Polo found salt cakes stamped with the imperial seal of Kublai Khan used as money in Tibet; and in Timbuktu, on the southern edge of the Saharan desert, salt was once traded ounce for ounce for gold. Salt enabled the early Europeans to fish the Grand Banks in Newfoundland since they could preserve their catch for the long journey home. In this respect, salt could be considered one of the first antibiotics used by humans, since it was used to kill the bacteria that would have otherwise caused the fish to spoil.\n\nCommon table salt is made up of one part sodium and one part chloride atom. It is one of the four basic flavors that all humans appreciate, along with sweet, sour and bitter. Salt is present in all the fluids and tissues of our bodies and is necessary for normal functioning of our organs. Our heart needs it to beat and our brain needs it to think. Yet too much salt can contribute to blood-pressure problems. So we ask our patients to avoid added salt and to read food labels regarding salt content.\n\nDietary salt is measured and displayed on food labels as milligrams (mg) of sodium. The current recommendation is that we consume less than 2,400 mg of sodium daily. That is only about one teaspoon, and this includes all salt — salt naturally present in foods, salt added to processed foods, salt used in cooking and salt added at the table. For someone with high blood pressure, a lower target — 1,500 mg daily — helps keep blood pressure down and helps blood pressure-lowering medicines work more effectively.\n\nSalt is present in almost all of our foods. Even natural unprepared foods have some salt. Milk, a natural body fluid, has about 160 mg of sodium per cup.\n\nSome foods are obvious culprits. Pretzels wear their salt right on the surface, and we eat potato and corn chips as much for the salty flavor as for the flavor of the baked or fried starch. But there is a surprising amount of salt in most sauces or condiments, such as spaghetti sauce and catsup. Most canned foods, including soups, stews and vegetables, are rife with added salt, sometimes 300 to 1,000 mg per serving. Prepared meats such a cold cuts and sausages are also chock full of salt.\n\nAlways read the food label for sodium (salt) content. Always check the serving size and servings per container. Though some prepared foods may appear to have only a modest salt content, a review of the food label may reveal many servings per container. If you are consuming more than one serving, your actual salt intake could be much higher than the number listed on the label. Fast foods are probably the worst offenders. It is not uncommon for fast food meals to have 1,000 to 2,000 mg of sodium in one serving.\n\nWhile salt has been a critical part of human history and is critical to our body’s physiology, we want to make sure we avoid “too much of a good thing.” For additional information on the impact of salt on health, visit the following websites.\n\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/features/sodium/\n\nhttp://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/hbp/prevent/sodium/sodium.htm\n\nhttp://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm181577.htm\n\n— Bill Black, M.D., Ph.D.\n\nThe Importance of Primary Care\n\nAmong the prominent buzzwords in today’s health-care debates is “primary care.” The conversations revolve around the shortage of primary care doctors, how primary care is essential to the success of health care reform and ways primary care can save money for everyone in the long run.\n\nSo what exactly is primary care, and why is it so important? If you Google a definition you’ll get approximately 15 responses, each one touching on some part of its essence. The one I like best is “the care of individuals with common health problems and chronic illnesses that can be managed on an outpatient basis, with an emphasis on prevention and continuity.”\n\nThe key to successful primary care lies in establishing a trusted relationship with your medical provider. This includes age-specific preventive exams and screenings, as well as treatment for more acute problems. Study after study has demonstrated that this primary-care relationship — really more of a health partnership — is the bedrock of any comprehensive and efficient health-care system.\n\nThe emerging model of primary care is a team approach, also known as the “medical home.” In this model, doctors work closely with nurses, pharmacists, dieticians, social workers, mental health providers, physical therapists, medical assistants and other members of the health care team to ensure that all problems or potential problems are addressed in a thorough and timely manner.\n\nSuccessful primary care also relies on doctors having the knowledge and resources to provide appropriate convenient access to medical specialists or specialized servicesÑalong with the ability to provide a seamless flow of information among these entities.\n\nWherever you choose to receive your primary care, remember that you as the patient are always the driving force, and that primary care is just thatÑyour primary connection to every aspect of medical prevention, diagnosis and treatment. It is a powerful tool in achieving and maintaining good health.\n\n— By Robert Russo, M.D.\n\n— The Palo Alto Medical Foundation and column editor Arian Dasmalchi provide this monthly column."
