        "text": "This essay analyses Foucault's revolutionary thought on power and knowledge, and their relationship in society. It first ascertains what Foucault means by 'power', i.e. its un-objectivity as 'force relations', to then uncover power's intrinsic relationship with knowledge, or rather 'systems of knowledge' in the form of discourse. Due to Foucault's very atypical, unconventional view on society, and power itself, this essay first ascertains what Foucault does not mean by 'power', as a means of separating any personal preconception the reader may have with Foucault's vision.\n\nThe essay explores Friedrich Nietzsche’s and Michel Foucault’s accounts of genealogy. It argues that genealogy sees human history not in terms of events, battles and wars (i.e. through empirical facts), but in terms of discursive regimes and practices which form our subjectivity. The link between knowledge/ truth and power plays crucial role in both Nietzsche’s and Foucault’s accounts of genealogy. Foucault’s notion of dispositive (the regime of intelligibility) serves as a key concept in his approach to history. The Nietzschean idea of the will to power is transformed into the idea of strategies of relations of forces supporting and supported by types of knowledge. The essay concludes that Foucault’s genealogy reduces meaning to power relations. It argues that in Foucault’s thought human history is intelligible not because of its inner meaning, but because knowledge and discourses, which play a key role in human history, are understood in terms of tactics and strategies.\n\nRethinking the Paradox of the Subject: “Power” and “Freedom” in Nietzsche and Foucault Abstract This essay re-examines “the paradox of the subject” as one of the main traps for critical theory today. I attempt to demonstrate that this famous paradox is an effect of the ambivalence of the power/freedom relationship in Foucault and it may be resolved by a recourse to Nietzsche. Following Paul Patton I argue that in a Nietzschean context “power” and “freedom” are not in opposition: freedom is power to act. But this synonymy creates a risk that “freedom” will become indistinguishable from “subjection” and “subordination”. Turning once again to Nietzsche’s perspectivism, I attempt to demonstrate how immanent evaluative confrontations are made between “freedom” and “power” – how, when, and why they function as antonyms. Freedom is not every power, but only the one we exercise from “our” actual perspective, in “the first person.” With every performance we inevitably make strong evaluations – including distinctions between freedom and domination – in an entirely immanent way, without resorting to justification. Finally, I attempt to focus on the strategic possibilities for critique today, which can enable us to practise – while keeping reflexive “modesty” - freedom of evaluation, including the freedom of making strong evaluations which are not based upon pre-given normative models. Key words: The paradox of the subject, power, freedom, Nietzsche, Foucault, Amy Allen, Paul Patton\n\nNietzsche and Foucault offer radical articulations of the ‘death of God’ in its critical-negative import for religion. However, the resources their thought contains for the elaboration of a positive conception of the nature of religion premised on the same epochal development has received less attention. This piece sketches a nascent conception of such a post-theistic account of the nature of religion by bringing into dialogue aspects of Nietzsche’s and Foucault’s respective ontologies of power and critical interrogations of religion (particularly Christianity). Drawing on aspects of both philosopher’s thought an emerging hybrid – an immanent religion of power itself – will be outlined. The perspective sketched cross-fertilizes aspects of both Nietzsche’s and Foucault’s genealogies of religion to propose an affirmative conception of the relation between religion and power that contests both notions of the infinite power of the transcendent and anthropocentric analyses of the power of specific religious institutions, values and practices. Focusing on Nietzsche’s and Foucault’s respective genealogies of Christian values and practice, as elaborated in their accounts of the ‘ascetic priest’ and ‘pastoral power’ respectively, a possible turn from the socio-political ‘reduction’ of religions of the transcendent to the emergence of the immanent religion of power itself is proposed.\n\nThe following article will broach the issue of the relation between Hegel and Foucault based on the binomial knowledge-power. While for Hegel human knowledge comes with the development of consciousness, for Foucault the possibility of knowledge is articulated within a phenomenology of power. While for Hegel Bildung leads spirit to self-consciousness, Foucault initially considers formation to be connected to a forced correction. At first Foucault studies the problem of formation in view of the dynamics of power, as a faculty of repression; later he underlines that the exchange between the sovereign and the advisor positively influences the decisions of the latter, as well as their personal growth. Foucault points out the connection between truth and freedom, and emphasizes the fundamental role of parresia as a force to break the system of power relations."
