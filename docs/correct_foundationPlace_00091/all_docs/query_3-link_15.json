In the decade since the first edition of this book, other huge philanthropies, some in the form of limited liability partnerships rather than tax-exempt foundations, have appeared on the scene—for example, the Emerson Collective, founded by Steve Jobs’s widow, Laurene Powell Jobs; the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, founded by Priscilla Chan and her husband, Mark Zuckerberg, a cofounder of Facebook; and Good Ventures, founded by Cari Tuna and her husband, Dustin Moskowitz, also a Facebook cofounder. In 2010, Bill Gates and Warren Buffet began recruiting the wealthy people of the world to contribute a majority of their wealth to philanthropic causes during their lifetimes or in their wills. As of 2017, the pledge has 158 signers, either individuals or couples. Most of the signers of the pledge are billionaires, with their pledges totaling more than $365 billion.1 Today, there are almost ninety US foundations with assets over $1 billion; more than two hundred with assets over $500 million; and myriad foundations with assets over $1 million.2 Transfers of wealth by gifts and bequests are predicted to increase greatly in the coming decades, with significant portions of the monies going to philanthropy. The philanthropic sectors in China and India and some other countries are also growing. And there also is a growing global interest in novel finance mechanisms, includ-\n\nxii\n\nPreface to the Second Edition\n\ning results-based financing and socially motivated investing—socalled impact investing. The second edition of Money Well Spent reflects these developments and trends. More important, it reflects the field’s, and our own, growing understanding of how to do philanthropy effectively. We began the first edition when we were at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation—Paul as president and Hal as director of its Environment Program. We’re proud of the foundation’s leadership in practicing what might be called strategic philanthropy. But at that time, the foundation was close to unique in this practice, and we were learning while doing. Ten years later, strategic philanthropy is still not pervasive. But it has taken root not only among larger foundations but also in the practice of an increasing number of high-net-worth individual philanthropists. Concomitantly, the infrastructure of the field supporting their work has flourished. At the same time, our own experience has broadened and our knowledge has deepened. Paul retired from the Hewlett Foundation to return to Stanford, where he joined the Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society and has been teaching about philanthropic strategy and impact investing at the Law School and Graduate School of Business. Hal moved from the Hewlett Foundation to become founder and CEO of the ClimateWorks Foundation and then to found Energy Innovation, which consults on clean energy for a broad range of philanthropists and organizations. All of these developments have given us new perspectives on the principles and practices of strategic philanthropy. As in the first edition, a somewhat disproportionate number of our examples are drawn from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation—not (merely) because it is an exemplary grantmaker but because we worked there and continue to keep up with its activities through friends and colleagues, including Paul’s successor as president, Larry Kramer.\n\nMONEY WELL SPENT\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nPeople choose to engage in philanthropy for any number of reasons: to solve pressing social problems, to act on religious or philosophical dictates, to aid the less fortunate, to instill altruistic values in their children, to achieve recognition, or to give meaning to their lives.1 Regardless of motive, most philanthropists want to use their money to best effect. Yet the history of efforts to improve people’s lives—from reducing drug addiction and high school dropout rates, to protecting ecosystems, to ameliorating global disease and poverty—demonstrates how difficult it is to actually make a difference. There are three basic requirements for having real impact as a philanthropist: motivation, money, and a winning strategy. You need to bring the first two to the table; this book serves up the third. Strategy matters in philanthropy just as it does in investing, running businesses, and conducting wars. While a good strategy cannot ensure success, it improves the odds—and its absence virtually assures failure. Effective grantmaking requires strategies based on clear goals, sound evidence, diligent care in selecting which organizations to fund, and provisions for assessing the results—good or bad.\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhether you are giving away $100,000 or $1 billion a year, your funds are not unlimited, and a good strategy can multiply their impact many times over. Our goal is to help you make the world a better place according to your own lights. We do not presume to tell you either how much to give or what passions to pursue.2 Those are personal choices. Philanthropic goals are as diverse as individuals’ conceptions of what is good for society. You may wish to promote the arts, religion, education, health, or world peace; protect the environment; or support the search for extraterrestrial life. You may want to stimulate social change, preserve the status quo, or return to halcyon days. While your choice of goals—commissioning symphonies or supporting the destitute—can be debated from a moral point of view, such issues are outside the scope of this book. Like a car repair manual, a guide to strategic philanthropy is essentially value neutral. The manual can be used equally to fine-tune an ambulance or the getaway car for a bank heist. By (almost) the same token, our book is useful for the pursuit of a wide variety of philanthropic goals, and some people, ourselves included, will regard certain of these goals as wrongheaded or even loathsome. When philanthropy addresses some of the hotbutton issues that divide the citizens of our pluralistic society, it is inevitable that one person’s ambulance is another’s getaway car. Indeed, even when goals, such as poverty alleviation or improved education, are widely shared, there may be differences about the appropriate ways to achieve them—for example, voluntary private action versus government spending and policy regulations. The book arises out of our belief that philanthropy can make a great difference in the world but that much of its potential is not realized. To put it bluntly, hundreds of millions of philanthropic dollars are squandered through donations to organizations that have no impact whatsoever. This is a guide for how to make a difference. It is intended to do for philanthropists what the best books on business strategy do for business entrepreneurs and executives. We wish to provide readers with the concepts necessary\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nto design a strategy to achieve their charitable goals and to assess the strategies of organizations that seek their support. Our fundamental premise is that, as important as the sheer number of dollars devoted to philanthropy may be, intelligent planning, systematic implementation, and continual feedback are even more crucial. Part 1 consists of a single chapter that makes the case for strategic philanthropy, using contemporary examples of successful and failed philanthropic projects. Part 2 takes the reader through the steps of developing and evaluating a philanthropic strategy. Its five chapters offer a framework that is essential for achieving results. This is the most technical and “academic” portion of the book. But if you have time to read only one part of the book, we recommend this one. Part 3 applies the framework from Part 2 to the actual practice of grantmaking. It begins with determining the scope of your interests and continues with vetting applicants and considering appropriate forms of philanthropic funding, including impact investing. The three chapters of Part 4 take a deep dive into major ways of achieving one’s philanthropic objectives: promoting knowledge, providing goods and services, and influencing government policies and business practices. Part 5 covers two constitutive aspects of engaging in philanthropy: the choice of structures—checkbooks, donor-advised funds, and the like—and your spending plan—ranging from giving all your philanthropic capital away in your lifetime or sooner to creating a perpetual foundation. The book ends with a short Afterword that addresses some concerns about the consequences of philanthropy, strategic or otherwise. We should disclose at the outset that strategic philanthropy demands serious focus, time, energy, and consultation. As individual philanthropists come to see what’s required to make a real difference, they often conclude that high-impact philanthropy\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nis not a one-person, part-time operation. It usually requires at least some professional staff. That’s why most of our examples are drawn from staffed foundations. If, as you read the following pages, you decide that you cannot or do not want to do it on your own, and lack the resources or interest to establish a staffed foundation, there are other good options. For example, you can place your assets in a trusted private foundation (as Warren Buffett did), in a strategically oriented community foundation, or in one of the increasing number of funds that manage portfolios of grants. You can mirror grants from a foundation that has a powerful strategy. Or you can become a sustaining supporter of a very-well-managed nonprofit group that has its own strategic focus and discipline. This book is intended not only for those who amass or inherit the fortunes that make large-scale philanthropy possible but also for the many others who counsel them and help spend their money, including the staff and boards of foundations, the myriad nonprofit organizations that seek philanthropic support, and the increasing number of professionals who advise wealthy clients on philanthropy. It is also designed as a textbook for the increasing number of university courses on philanthropy. Although we value knowledge for its own sake, this book is written with an instrumental purpose: to improve the effectiveness of your philanthropy with the ultimate goal of making the world a better place. Our theory of change is that this book will help readers who are already strategically oriented become even better and will whet others’ appetites. Doubtless, this is a speculative and somewhat optimistic belief. After all, for every thousand books written with the hope of making a difference in people’s lives, let alone society at large, at most one or two succeed. But we think of our effort in terms of expected return: the probability of impact may not be high, but its potential magnitude is. In any event, writing the book has been a labor of love and voyage of discovery for both of us.\n\nPART ONE\n\nINTRODUCTION TO STRATEGIC PHILANTHROPY\n\nis synonymous with “result-oriented,” “outcome-oriented,” and “effective” philanthropy. It refers to philanthropy in which donors seek to achieve clearly defined goals, they and their grantees pursue evidence-based strategies for achieving those goals, and both parties monitor progress toward outcomes in order to make appropriate course corrections and ultimately evaluate their success. The basic imperative of strategic philanthropy is to deploy your resources to achieve your goals most effectively. This calls for approaching the work with a clear-eyed appreciation of the inevitable risks of failure as well as the potential for success. Your chances of success are greatly increased by having well-defined goals and a sound strategic plan to achieve them. The goals describe what success would look like, and the strategic plan details every step necessary to achieve them, including indicators that you are on the right path—or, conversely, that you’ve strayed or lost your way. This one-chapter part begins with a section on choosing goals and then sets out some contemporary examples of strategic philanthropy. “STRATEGIC PHILANTHROPY”\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nChapter 1\n\nTHE PROMISE OF STRATEGIC PHILANTHROPY\n\nThe Choice of Philanthropic Goals Since strategy is merely a means for achieving goals, you can’t have a strategy until you have decided what you want to achieve. Some of Hal’s and Paul’s goals for their personal philanthropy, such as combating global warming, are identical. Some differ: Hal cares about protecting the great landscapes of the American West; Paul is devoted to classical chamber music. But, as we said in the Introduction, this book is designed to help you be effective in pursuing your goals, not ours. Many philanthropists’ goals are determined by particular commitments and passions that motivate and precede their philanthropy. They may come from personal experience or be based on religious, philosophical, or personal beliefs—for example, the effective altruism movement’s argument that charitable giving should be dedicated solely to addressing catastrophic risks and improving the lives of the world’s poorest people,1 or the idea (which is in tension with effective altruism) that philanthropists have a special obligation to their geographic communities.2 For some, the urge to be altruistic precedes particular objectives; they\n\n8\n\nChapter 1\n\nmay benefit from an inquiry like the famous What Color Is Your Parachute? approach to choosing careers. Without suggesting that you should follow Cari Tuna’s and Dustin Moscowitz’s particular path, you may find these young Giving Pledgers’ approach evocative. At the time they made their pledge, Dustin, a cofounder of Facebook, wrote that he viewed his good fortune “not as personal wealth, but as a tool with which I hope to bring even more benefit to the world.”3 While Dustin devoted attention to building another company, Cari undertook a several-year exploration of their philanthropic goals and approaches. In her own words, Cari wondered “how many excellent causes I and other U.S. donors might be overlooking because we had never encountered them personally.”4 She joined forces with the cofounders of GiveWell, which rates charities that address global poverty, to have in-depth conversations with a broad range of practitioners and funders, and she cofunded grants with more experienced foundations to learn about grantmaking and get a direct sense of the activities and impact of grantee organizations. Cari and Dustin created the Good Ventures Foundation and the closely allied Open Philanthropy Project.5 While the precise language of the foundation’s underlying values has changed over the years, they are captured on its current website: The primary goal of our giving is to improve the lives of as many people as possible as much as possible. We believe that all lives are valuable, including future lives. These guiding principles have big implications for the foundation’s approach to grantmaking. Some donors prefer to give closer to home. Some find it helpful to limit their scope to a particular country or region. We think being open to giving in any region is a comparative advantage of ours. Much of the foundation’s grantmaking to date has been focused on the poorest places in the world, where dollars go further toward saving and improving lives. But we’re also fund-\n\nThe Promise of Strategic Philanthropy\n\n9\n\ning organizations in the developed world with the potential to increase human well-being at scale.6\n\nThe website explains: “As a new foundation, we’ve decided not to commit to focus areas just yet. Instead, we’re taking time to learn about causes across the major categories of philanthropy— direct aid, research and development, and policy advocacy—in search of important areas on which we could have an outsized impact long-term.”7 The foundation has set these criteria for choosing causes for grantmaking: • Importance: What is the problem, how many people does it affect, and how deeply does it affect them? • Tractability: What are the possible solutions, and do opportunities exist to make tangible progress? • Crowdedness: Who else is working on the issue? Is it an area that is underfunded (rather than more “crowded” with donors) where Good Ventures therefore could have a bigger impact?8 Many new philanthropists do not have the capacity—or attention span—to engage in anything approaching Cari Tuna’s arduous learning journey. And, of course, you may start with a different set of values and goals. But she provides a model of a thorough process, which can be adapted to fit your own resources. While Cari worried about overlooking charitable opportunities that she and Dustin had not personally encountered, philanthropy often begins with donors’ personal experiences. For example, when his wife was treated heartlessly by hospital staff, Dr. Har vey Picker, a pioneer in X-ray technology, used the resources of his family foundation in collaboration with the Commonwealth Fund to support research and advocacy that established the idea of patient- centered care.9 Bill and Melinda Gates’s exposure to poverty in Africa was a side effect of a safari trip they took in 1993.10 Ed Scott’s anchor gift to found the Center\n\n10\n\nChapter 1\n\nfor Global Development was inspired by a documentary on the disastrous consequences of the World Bank’s and International Monetary Fund’s imposition of austerity measures on developing countries.11 Although Cari and Dustin came out of the gate with incredibly ambitious goals, it is not unusual for people who have acquired great wealth to initially seek safer targets for their philanthropy and only later—if ever—consider bolder and more complex goals.\n\nThe Necessity of Strategy And this brings us to strategy. Whatever your philanthropic motivations and goals may be, a sense of mission, commitment, and passion is essential to every aspect of your work. But for every case where mission, commitment, and passion were translated into impact, there are hundreds where philanthropists acted as if these qualities alone sufficed. Without the capacity to move beyond passion to reason, planning, and execution, the sector would be left largely with well-meaning gestures that confuse good intentions with real effects. Whether you are concerned with combating global warming, eradicating hunger, curing diseases, or reforming education, you are in for a challenge not just because social change is the product of a large variety of forces that are hard to isolate, much less affect with any certainty, but also because, unlike the financial returns of a business or even electoral returns in politics, philanthropy has no common measures of success. Philanthropy is a field with poor feedback and messy signals—and those signals are often distorted by the pervasive flattery that colors transactions in the money-giving business. Thus, once you have acknowledged your passions and determined your goals, mind and muscle must come in to design and implement a strategy to realize them. A strategy comprises the unromantic, nitty-gritty working out of the means to accomplish your\n\nThe Promise of Strategic Philanthropy\n\n11\n\nphilanthropic ends. The ultimate goal of a strategy is to achieve impact, which is at the opposite end of the spectrum from good intentions. Impact means making a difference—not in some existential or universal sense but rather in terms of your own philanthropic goals.\n\nPhilanthropic Successes and Failures The chapters of this book are full of real-world examples, intended to give you a sense of the range of the practices and tools of philanthropy and their applications to varied situations. We describe failed as well as successful philanthropic efforts. Grantmaking almost always involves risk taking—sometimes relatively low, as in grants to long-standing service-delivery organizatons; sometime extremely high, as in the case of policy-advocacy strategies— and risk taking entails a chance of failure. The relevant questions are whether the potential reward is worth the risk and whether your strategy is designed to mitigate risks to the extent feasible. We emphasize failures because philanthropists can learn a lot from failure. As Joel Podolny, dean of Apple University, remarked, “Success is a lousy learning environment,”12 and learning from one’s failures is among the core tenets of strategic philanthropy. But you can learn from your failures only if you are candid in recognizing them. With great respect for Krista Donaldson’s leadership of D-Rev in designing products for developing countries,13 we couldn’t disagree more with her comment that “calling a learning a failure will discourage honesty and integrity—and hinder the pursuit of impact.”14 Taking the opposite point of view, Vanessa Kirsch, founder of New Profit, the venture fund for social entrepreneurs, astutely said, “If an organization walks through our door and says they’ve never failed, we’re skeptical.”15 When we were at the Hewlett Foundation, we inaugurated an annual contest for “the worst grant from which you learned the most.” Because of the foundation-\n\n12\n\nChapter 1\n\nwide learning that came from it, the prize became a sought-after honor rather than a mark of opprobrium. For the same reasons that the foundation’s grantmaking improved by telling it like it was, we believe that yours will as well. In most instances, it’s pretty obvious when a strategy has failed: the activities necessary to implement a strategy were not carried out or, if they were, did not create the sequence of events necessary to achieve your intended outcome. Seemingly successful outcomes present a particular problem, however. It is often difficult to determine whether a good outcome was the result of your grantee’s intervention or whether it would have happened in any event—what’s called the “counterfactual”—as a result of other forces. Why does it matter? Not mainly so that you can feel good (or bad) about your accomplishments—though we wouldn’t begrudge anyone those feelings—but rather so that you and others can learn what works and doesn’t work in order to improve your own performance and that of your grantees. As we see in Chapter 5, there are some robust methods for testing causality in interventions that provide goods and services such as food, health, and education. It’s far more difficult, however, to assess causality in efforts to influence legislative policy and corporate behavior. To some extent this is inherent in the complex social and political dynamics intrinsic to these interventions. But it’s also a product of the poor level of analysis and transparency of many philanthropic efforts and the tendency, not discouraged by philanthropists, their supplicants, and their peers, to be self-congratulatory. One noteworthy effort to bring rigor, including counterfactual analysis, to these stories is the Open Philanthropy Project’s commissioned case studies of the history of philanthropy.16 Our book draws on several cases from this nascent collection. With this background, we examine some examples of different modes of philanthropy with successful, unsuccessful, and ambiguous results.\n\nThe Promise of Strategic Philanthropy\n\n13\n\nFighting Poverty through Service Delivery The Robin Hood Foundation, whose approximately $200 million annual budget is funded by hedge fund managers and other individual donors, is devoted to fighting poverty in New York City.17 The foundation has four programs: 1. Jobs and economic security (e.g., microlending, financial literacy, and helping people access public benefits) 2. K–12 education (e.g., high-performing charter schools) 3. Early childhood and youth (e.g., abused children, children aging out of foster care, and early childhood education) 4. Survival/health (e.g., homelessness, emergency food, HIV/ AIDS) The foundation’s grantees are mainly service-delivery organizations, to which it provides capacity-building assistance as well as grant dollars. Robin Hood employs a common metric for assessing grantees’ performance and its own aggregate performance in the first three programs: the boost that a program gives to the lifetime earnings of participants. According to its benefit-cost analysis, every dollar granted has a 12× multiplier effect on outcomes for Robin Hood’s beneficiaries.18 While the foundation’s grantmaking process calls for a systematic assessment of every applicant’s benefit/cost ratio, this is not the sole basis for making grants. Former chief program officer Michael Weinstein writes: The ratios are useful guides but they are imprecise. They amount to one of several tools in a funder’s tool kit. Smart funders would no more make grant decisions based solely on the arithmetic of benefit/cost ratios than smart admissions officers at competitive undergraduate colleges would make decisions based solely on the arithmetic of SAT scores. . . . Along with other information, benefit/cost ratios steer a funder toward grantees with the best chance to fulfill its mission.19\n\n14\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe numbers provide a focal point for discussions about an organization’s effectiveness, but program officers are encouraged to push back on numbers that don’t jibe with their experience or fully capture an organization’s value. The goal is to test the program officers’ judgments against relatively objective numbers and subject the numbers to a reality check.20 Robin Hood is a highly strategic foundation. Its activities are focused on the unquestionably important goal of alleviating poverty in New York City. Though not the only possible measure of success, the individual benefit conferred on a poor person is a perfectly good one.21 And though there are strategies besides funding service delivery, including policy research and advocacy, this is a sound, relatively low-risk approach. Finally, Robin Hood’s use of empirical data in its highly transparent decision making is exemplary.22 The foundation holds itself accountable not only for outcomes but for impact—for achieving outcomes that would not have happened but for its grants. Robin Hood has a large budget, a sophisticated grantmaking process, and a commensurately large staff of about seventy-five professionals who conduct due diligence and provide support to its grantees. Can an individual philanthropist also be strategic in making grants to service-delivery organizations, whether for the benefit of poor families, the environment, music students, or any of the myriad beneficiaries of nonprofit organizations? Our answer is absolutely yes, but with some conditions. Although you needn’t have a single overarching goal for all your philanthropy, you must have (1) a clear goal for each gift or grant you make and (2) reasonable confidence that the organization is capable of achieving that goal. While the first condition is relatively easy to meet, the second is more difficult because many nonprofit organizations don’t keep track of, let alone divulge, their own progress and outcomes, and there is no third-party service that measures impact for a broad array of organizations. Absent such indicators, strategic individual philanthropists may imitate the grantmaking of a foundation in which they have\n\nThe Promise of Strategic Philanthropy\n\n15\n\nconfidence or give to one of the increasing number of issue-based funds (see Chapter 11) in which they have confidence. What is not strategic is to give to an organization based on its heartrending appeals, its charismatic executive director, or requests from your friends or business associates.\n\nReducing Drug Abuse through Community Action From 1988 to 2003, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) invested $87.9 million in its Fighting Back initiative to reduce drug and alcohol addiction in a number of disadvantaged communities.23 Before undertaking the program, RWJF conducted an extensive two-year analysis of past community efforts to address alcohol and drug abuse, which centered around decreasing the supply of drugs mainly through increased law enforcement. Those efforts were characterized by the absence of community leadership and lack of coordination among programs, communities, and local and state governments—and they were total failures. Consistent with the best thinking in the field of community change, Fighting Back was premised on the belief that a local community could address its drug problems by coordinating the work of government agencies, schools, and nonprofits with community efforts and individual treatment programs. The initiative specified measurable outcome indicators, which included sustained reductions in the initiation of drug and alcohol abuse among children and adolescents, in drug- and alcohol-related deaths and injuries, in health problems related to alcohol and drug abuse, and in drug-related crimes. From more than three hundred applications, RWJF chose fifteen communities whose proposals linked strategies for prevention, early intervention, treatment, and relapse prevention. In each community, a lead organization was chosen based on its demonstrated ability to pull together health care and other community resources. Each community pursued three complementary strategies:\n\n16\n\nChapter 1\n\n• Increasing the physical and social conditions that deter alcohol and drug use through community policing, street lighting, and cleaning up housing projects • Strengthening individuals’ ability to resist and recover from alcohol and drug use through parenting classes, youth programs, academic assistance, and case management for alcohol and drug abuse clients • Diminishing the availability and accessibility of alcohol and drugs by closing crack houses, demolishing abandoned buildings, and closing liquor outlets in risk areas Yet, as a comprehensive evaluation concluded, “a sustained, 10-year community-based coalition approach with ample technical assistance and direction, top-notch people, and sites that were pre-selected, did not produce robust results in terms of decreasing substance abuse.”24 Among the explanations for the initiative’s failure were distrust and competition for funding among organizations and agencies, which distracted from its main goal. We think of RWJF’s Fighting Back initiative as a highly strategic effort. It had a clear focus, it was based on good evidence, and it was carefully implemented. It contrasts sharply with the Hewlett Foundation’s failed Neighborhood Improvement Initiative, described in Chapter 11, which was flawed from the outset. It should be noted that, typical of RWJF’s practice of making assessments of its initiatives publicly available, its evaluation of Fighting Back contributed to the growing body of information about what works and doesn’t in community change. Subsequent years have seen many more efforts to address problems on a community level, including “collective impact” initiatives, where individual philanthropists and family foundations can also play a role. Though it may be too early to tell, their overall success rate has not been remarkable, perhaps attesting to the intractability of the problems addressed and the difficulties of coordinating multiple independent actors.\n\nThe Promise of Strategic Philanthropy\n\n17\n\nReducing Smoking and Smoking Deaths in the United States We follow a story of a significant failure by RWJF with a story of its significant and far-reaching success.25 From 1991 to 2009, under the leadership of Steve Schroeder, the foundation devoted $700 million to reducing smoking in the United States. The Annie E. Casey Foundation and California Wellness Foundation also contributed to the effort. The foundations made grants supporting policy research, advocacy, coalition building, communications, and cessation programs. As described by the Center for Public Program Evaluation, Through these and other programs, RWJF focused its efforts on building policy and public health infrastructures designed to prevent smoking, help those who already smoke to quit, and transform the national culture and social acceptability of smoking. For example, the Foundation, along with other leading tobacco-control advocates, supported an expansion of comprehensive statewide tobacco-control programs that used mass media and community-based organizations to discourage smoking. It promoted increases in federal and state excise taxes, a powerful disincentive to smoking, especially among youth. It also helped bring about prohibitions on youth-targeted advertising and marketing, enactment of smoking bans, access to proven smoking cessation treatments, insurance coverage of such treatments and authority for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate tobacco products.26\n\nRWJF supported research on policies, such as regulation and taxation, that might reduce tobacco use. It invested millions of dollars in “SmokeLess States programs” to support statewide plans and activities to reduce tobacco use, especially among children and teenagers. It also supported research on the treatment of tobacco addiction and the translation of successful research into practice and built the demand for effective treatment ser-\n\n18\n\nChapter 1\n\nvices. The foundation also helped broker a Master Settlement Agreement that ended litigation between the states and the tobacco industry with an agreement that imposed restrictions on tobacco advertising, marketing, and promotional programs.27 The Center for Public Program Evaluation’s report concludes: In 1990, virtually no one was covered by smoking bans. By 2009, state and local government smoking bans covered 57 percent of Americans in workplaces, 65 percent in restaurants, and 54 percent in bars. . . . The impact of these changes is significant in terms of smokingrelated mortality and illness. As a result of the excise taxes, price increases linked to the Master Settlement Agreement, indoor smoking bans and other tobacco-control policy changes put into place between 1993 and mid-2009, at least 5.3 million fewer people were smoking in 2010 and a cumulative total of more than 60,000 smoking-attributable deaths had been averted. By 2063, some 70 years after the first data became available since RWJF started its tobacco-control work, 12 million fewer people will smoke and 2.1 million smoking-attributable deaths will have been averted, assuming the new policies continue.28\n\nBy 2009, smoking and its attendant morbidity and mortality rates had fallen dramatically, and social norms in many parts of the country had changed to disfavor smoking. Of course, it is impossible to know how much of this to attribute to the foundations’ work. As a result of the 1964 report of the surgeon general of the United States, which linked smoking and specific diseases;29 efforts by the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products; and publicity by the American Cancer Society, American Medical Association, American Heart Society, and other groups, smoking had already begun to decline before RWJF came on the scene. The historian Benjamin Soskis notes that “it is not possible . . . to isolate the RWJF funding from the various other actors that also might have been pushing for similar reforms,” but he concludes that it likely contributed to positive health outcomes.30\n\nThe Promise of Strategic Philanthropy\n\n19\n\nWe’ll let readers consider for themselves whether they would invest in an effort where one could not more clearly attribute the outcome to the expenditure of $700 million of philanthropic dollars. Our own answer is unequivocally yes. It is the nature of a decision that it must be made before you know the outcome. The most you can do is predict is how likely you are to have impact in achieving your intended outcome, and at what cost, and to design and implement the best possible strategy. The history of RWJF’s campaign against tobacco is that of well-thought-out and wellexecuted strategies.\n\nAdvocating for School Choice The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation’s and the Walton Family Foundation’s (WFF) efforts to implement the vision of school vouchers proposed by free-market economist Milton Friedman provide another good example of a multipronged advocacy strategy.31 Joined by twenty-eight other foundations, they gave close to $400 million to more than a hundred organizations concerned with school choice. The late journalist Rick Cohen observed: “These foundations deserve credit for serving as the capital bulwark for a movement that has had significant impact in shaping the public’s understanding of K–12 education.”32 The Bradley Foundation’s first efforts came in the late 1980s, in the form of funding for a scholarly book supporting school choice.33 It then supported the legal defense of Milwaukee’s experimental voucher program and advocacy for public programs. Beginning in 1992, some of the foundation’s largest grants went to a private, nonprofit voucher program for low-income students, which served as a pilot for the eventual government program. The Bradley Foundation’s multifaceted support was critical to the development of Milwaukee’s school-choice program and to the advocacy that led to the Supreme Court decision that upheld it.34 Grantmaking by WFF included funding parent organizing to build support for public policies that provide school choice; managing and strengthening publicly funded scholarship programs;\n\n20\n\nChapter 1\n\nproviding families with useful information about their traditional public-, public charter-, and private-school options; and evaluating the performance and effects of school-choice programs.35 Although Bradley and Walton moved vouchers from a theoretical idea to plausible public policy, the school-voucher movement has stalled, at least for the moment.36 The Bradley Foundation continues to fund groups supporting private-school vouchers.37 As we mention in Chapter 5, evidence suggests that school choice does not improve student outcomes. Indeed, WFF’s theory of change has evolved from the belief that “more choices would generate more competition [and that] competition would catalyze systemic improvement,”38 to the understanding that “choice is necessary, but . . . choice [alone] cannot stimulate systemic transformation and large-scale improvements on their own.”39 Among other things, WFF is putting hundreds of millions of dollars into charter and private schools that target low-income students. Based on the two foundations’ websites, other documents, and activities, they had rather different, albeit compatible, goals. The Bradley Foundation’s funding of school choice was aimed at protecting the freedoms of “competent, self-governing citizens, who are understood to be fully capable of and personally responsible for making the major political, economic, and moral decisions that shape their own lives, and the lives of their children.” 40 The WFF sought “to improve K–12 outcomes for all students, especially those of limited means, by ensuring access to high-quality educational options that prepare them for a lifetime of opportunity.”41 Each foundation has acted strategically to further its objectives. WFF’s explicit acknowledgment that its original theory of change was not working is a signal act of strategic realignment based on empirical evidence. Whether the foundations have succeeded in their objectives may depend on the time frame involved. As we write in the fall of 2017, it seems possible that the voucher movement may gain new momentum with President Trump’s appointment of Betsy DeVos as secretary of education. As for Walton’s goal of providing qual-\n\nThe Promise of Strategic Philanthropy\n\n21\n\nity education for disadvantaged children, the foundation has contributed to the small but increasing number of children who attend quality charter schools. Individual philanthropists who share one or both of the foundations’ objectives have many opportunities to pursue them. The Philanthropy Roundtable, an organization comprising mainly conservative family foundations, holds workshops on K–12 education that provide current information about these issues.42 And donors who wish to support high-quality charter schools in their area or nationally have access to far better evaluative data than are available about most nonprofit organizations.43\n\nBuilding the Field of Open Educational Resources To quote from Wikipedia, one of the most widely used “open” sources of information, “Open educational resources (OER) are freely accessible, openly licensed text, media, and other digital assets that are useful for teaching, learning, and assessing as well as for research purposes.”44 OER is the center both of a field of linked researchers, practitioners, and organizations, and a movement whose participants are evangelical about the goal of increasing and protecting open access to educational resources.45 The movement began in the 1990s with David Wiley’s leadership of the Center for Open and Sustainable Learning at Utah State University; a grant by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to California State University to create a database of free online higher education curricula; the launch of the Public Library of Science (PLOS), a nonprofit publisher of open-access science, technology, and medical journals; and the Budapest Open Access Initiative, an international effort to make academic research articles freely available on the Internet. The term “open educational resources” was coined at a 2002 meeting of the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). In 2001, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and William and Flora Hewlett Foundation made large grants to MIT to support its OpenCourseWare (OCW) initiative, which makes the teaching\n\n22\n\nChapter 1\n\nmaterials for almost all of the university’s courses available free online, under an open copyright license. That same year, also with funds from Hewlett, Larry Lessig and others founded Creative Commons (CC), whose mission is to “develop, support, and steward legal and technical infrastructure that maximizes digital creativity, sharing, and innovation.”46 CC “provides free, easy-to-use copyright licenses to make a simple and standardized way to give the public permission to share and use your creative work—on conditions of your choice.”47 The most open license, Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY), allows anyone to “copy and redistribute the material for any purpose in any medium or format and remix, transform, and build upon the material as long as the user gives the author appropriate credit and indicates if changes were made.”48 As of 2017, more than 1.2 billion works—text, music, video, photos, and other digital resources—have been shared with the world using CC licenses. Besides Wikipedia, Khan Academy is one of the best-known open online resources. An increasing number of academic journals are open, as are many (though by no means all) videos published on YouTube and photos on Flickr. Several Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), including those on EdX and Philanthropy University, are CC-licensed. One major domestic OER effort has been to encourage the writing, publication, and use of open textbooks for K–12 and college levels. In 2015, The US Department of Education announced its #GoOpen campaign to encourage states, school districts, and educators to use openly licensed educational materials. The same year, the US Department of Labor announced that postsecondary educational materials developed under a major grant program must be released with a CC BY license. Along similar lines, NSF requires that papers supported by its grants be available for downloading, reading, and analysis free of charge no later than twelve months after initial publication.49 UNESCO and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have played a significant role in expanding OER globally.\n\nThe Promise of Strategic Philanthropy\n\n23\n\nA recent article on the state of OER summarizes the movement’s achievements: The extent of coverage for higher education from MIT OCW and its many translations into different languages is enormous. More than 100 million unique visitors, including scholars, teachers, and students, have explored content on the MIT site (and millions more who speak and read in languages other than English have visited the sites of the 250 higher education institutions from all over the world in the Open Education Consortium). . . . Thousands of open textbooks and hundreds of full open courses are now available for the most highly enrolled US college courses and are being translated into many languages, helping more students afford college. . . . Teacher Education in Sub- Saharan Africa (TESSA), COL, and TESS-India support high-quality professional development for teachers in a half dozen African nations and seven states in India, together influencing teachers of hundreds of thousands of students.50\n\nAt the K–12 level, Khan Academy materials have had hundreds of millions of users. An important by-product is the work of the Foundation for Learning Equality (FLE), which has developed a method for delivering Khan and other educational materials in settings where there is no connectivity and no electrical power. FLE has brought educational materials to an estimated two million–plus users through its work with large nongovernmental organizations in refugee camps, US prisons, and other resourcelimited settings. Full K–12 open curricula reaching millions of students are available in English, as are hundreds of textbooks and online courses. Open textbooks are also available in dozens of countries. Since its grant to MIT, the Hewlett Foundation has played a key role in developing the field, not just through funding but also through intellectual leadership, by nurturing the field’s organizations, and by using its convening power to keep the participants linked. While Hewlett remains the single largest funder of the\n\n24\n\nChapter 1\n\nOER infrastructure, the movement is also being supported by the Arnold, Gates, Charles Koch, and Open Society Foundations, the Helmsley Trust, and many smaller foundations and high-networth individual donors. For example, Khan Academy was a small start-up, on the verge of bankruptcy, when John and Ann Doerr discovered it and provided both funds and steady guidance to build it into its current prominence. Importantly, an increasing number of foundations are making their own publications, as well as those created under their grants, available under CC licenses.51 The OER movement could not have happened without the proliferation of computers and the advent of the Internet in the last decades of the twentieth century. It depended on creative academics, entrepreneurial nonprofit leaders, and visionary government officials—and on the commitment and perseverance of philanthropy.\n\nThe Mind-Set of Strategic Philanthropy: Maximizing Expected Social Return Having seen some of the many forms that strategic philanthropy can take, you might wonder what it doesn’t include. The answer, unfortunately, is much philanthropy as it is actually practiced. If a strategy is a road map showing the way to a goal, the goals of many philanthropic gifts and grants are not sufficiently specific to be placed on any map.52 We do not suggest that such philanthropy is harmful. In our personal lives, the authors regularly make year-end gifts to organizations for which we have warm feelings. These gifts make us feel good, and doubtless they help good organizations. But this is not the way to change the world, and it certainly is not a responsible way to give away someone else’s money. In the introduction to Part 1, we set out the elements of strategic philanthropy: clearly defined goals pursued through evidencebased strategies; and monitoring progress toward outcomes and\n\nThe Promise of Strategic Philanthropy\n\n25\n\nassessing their achievement in order to make appropriate course corrections. Here we would like to add an element that underlies these practices: maximizing the expected social return (hereafter, just expected return) of one’s philanthropic efforts. The idea is simply that you want your (inevitably) limited resources to achieve the greatest possible impact. For most objectives—whether improving the graduation rates of disadvantaged youth, feeding the hungry, or preventing AIDS—the more you accomplish, the better. The more you accomplish with the same resources, the greater the expected return. The concept of expected return accounts for the risk involved in achieving your goals. It is a function of the magnitude of the impact times the probability of achieving it. The cost of a program and the expected return of its outcome together describe its cost-effectiveness. The impact of some philanthropic activities is pretty certain: if you are supporting a soup kitchen, you and the organizations you are funding will know at the end of the day how many people (who might otherwise have gone hungry) you are feeding, and you can predict what the organization will achieve tomorrow. For many if not most nonprofit activities, however, the impact is anything but certain. How many pregnancies will a teen pregnancy prevention program prevent? Will advocacy for bail reform succeed in state legislatures, and, if so, will reform measures be implemented by prosecutors and judges? Realistically, one usually cannot calculate the likelihood of success with any degree of precision. Even so, an expected return mind-set that estimates expected return while acknowledging its huge margins of error has many benefits: • It encourages philanthropists and the organizations they support to marshal their resources most effectively to accomplish shared objectives. • It puts the administrative costs of the foundation and those of the organizations it supports in the proper context: specif-\n\n26\n\nChapter 1\n\nically, those costs are justified to the extent, but only to the extent, that they contribute to an organization’s impact (discussed in Chapter 9). • It helps a philanthropist recognize the risks of implementation so that attention can be given to minimizing or mitigating them. • It justifies risky nonprofit ventures that have high potential benefits if they succeed. Consider the likelihood of an organization’s succeeding in reducing global warming or of a medical research institute’s developing an AIDS vaccine. The probabilities may be low, but the potential impacts are enormous. • It encourages philanthropists to be realistic and candid about failure. “Failure” is almost a dirty word in our sector. Yet a large proportion of nonprofit activities and foundation grants fail to achieve their objectives. As we noted earlier, without acknowledging failure, an organization loses one of its most important avenues of learning. • It helps a philanthropist understand his own tolerance for risk. Some funders are prepared to take huge risks of failure. Others are quite risk averse. You can sometimes find effective ways to achieve objectives that fit your tolerance for risks or undertake several projects with different risk levels so that the overall “portfolio” is in line with your appetite for risk, or choose different objectives that can be achieved without too much risk. In fact, everyone goes through some sort of expected return analysis when deciding to make a grant. It is usually informal, and often even unconscious. Bringing the analysis out in the open forces disciplined thinking when comparing and assessing proposals. It also highlights particular vulnerabilities in a program— aspects of the strategy where the probabilities seem particularly uncertain or noticeably low. In cases like these, it may well be\n\nThe Promise of Strategic Philanthropy\n\n27\n\nworth the effort to gather more information or to design redundant strategies.\n\nApplication to Your Own Philanthropy The five case studies in this chapter examined several quite different strategies: delivering services, collaborating to improve a community’s well-being, supporting knowledge building, advocating for policy changes, and building fields and movements. The likelihood of success or the risks of failure vary greatly. Putting aside the particular goals of these philanthropic efforts, which approaches appeal to you? Why? And what is your own attitude toward philanthropic risk taking in these or similar circumstances?\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nPART TWO\n\nPHILANTHROPIC STRATEGY FROM SOUP TO NUTS\n\nwe take you through the steps of developing a philanthropic or nonprofit strategy. For most practical purposes, there’s no difference between developing a strategy to guide your own philanthropic giving in a particular area and a nonprofit organization’s development of its strategy. Nonetheless, you may ask, why is developing a strategy an appropriate task for philanthropists rather for the organizations they support? In later chapters, we consider how active a role you wish take in regard to a grantee organization in determining the strategy for addressing a particular problem. But even if you believe that this should be primarily the grantee’s responsibility, you will at least need to assure yourself that its staff has adequately thought through the proposed strategy and that it makes good sense. In other words, those on both sides of the table should be in the know. Here are the basic steps involved in developing a strategy:\n\nIN PART 2\n\n• Clarifying what problem you’re trying to solve • Understanding your beneficiaries and their needs • Understanding the causes of the problem\n\n30\n\nPart 2\n\n• Clearly articulating your intended outcome and an evidencebased theory of change that will achieve it • Designing a plan for implementing your strategy and anticipating problems with it • Preparing to get feedback as you implement the plan We walk through these steps together with Peggy and Fred Gordon, a married couple, who are concerned with homelessness in their city. They have asked you, the reader, and us, the authors, to help sketch a strategy to address this problem.\n\nChapter 2\n\nPROBLEM ANALYSIS A problem well put is half solved. —JOHN DEWEY1\n\nYou can think of most philanthropy as either responding to a problem or seizing an opportunity. While these are two sides of the same coin, focusing on the problem side tends to sharpen analysis. A problem can be understood in several different ways.2 In its narrowest sense, a problem is a situation in which something has gone wrong—for example, a river is polluted and the fish are dying. Sometimes nothing has gone wrong yet, but there is reason to believe that if action is not taken, something may go wrong in the future—for example, if your city is not adequately prepared for an earthquake or flood, thousands of people may die unnecessarily. Most broadly, a problem is a situation in which something is less than ideal—where the world as it is varies from the world as we would like it to be. For example, a particular region suffers from poor agricultural productivity, and you believe that it could be improved. Or you may believe that it’s a problem that audiences for classical music are shrinking. A problem does not exist abstractly, but always from someone’s point of view. What one person may regard as a problem may be a satisfactory state for someone else. One nonprofit organization may believe that any laws permitting abortion jeopardize a fetus’s\n\n32\n\nChapter 2\n\nabsolute right to life, while another may believe that a woman has an absolute right to terminate her pregnancy. One organization may believe that government needs to regulate citizens’ ownership of guns more strictly, while another believes that almost any regulation of ownership violates the US Constitution. Even in the simplest case of individuals’ seeking to solve their own personal problems, the nature of the problem and their underlying needs or interests are not always self-evident. Fashioning a robust solution requires getting at the essence of the problem and identifying their needs or interests even when they have not been explicitly articulated. The process of defining a problem typically begins with a description of the current state of affairs and what the decision maker finds wrong with it. Even when one’s sense that something is wrong is inchoate, stories of hardship, conflicts, or frustrations can help describe the problem, and data can indicate its magnitude. The problem might be as global as “7.3 million teenage girls in developing countries become pregnant each year” or as local as “it takes two months for the utility company to respond to consumer complaints.” The problem-solving process should provide some sense of what the ideal would be if the problem were solved: “No teenager will become pregnant,” or perhaps “No teenager will become pregnant unless the pregnancy is planned and she and her partner have the capacity to care for the child without compromising their own futures;” or “The utility company will respond to consumer complaints within twenty-four hours.” As the word implies, it may not be feasible to achieve the “ideal.” But it will provide a benchmark against which solutions can be assessed.\n\nProblem Framing: Getting to the Heart of the Problem A Zen adage recommends that one should ask “why?” five times to get to the heart of a problem. (This is very different from inquiring into the causes of the problem.) In getting to the heart of a\n\nProblem Analysis\n\n33\n\nproblem, the question may often best be phrased as “why is this objective important?”—and there are also other kinds of questions that help us understand what the problem is really about. Questioning each stated objective may lead to a closer approximation of the real problem. Consider this example from public policy, concerning the transportation of hazardous material to a distant waste dump. Q. How shall we get hazardous materials to the waste dump? A. We should minimize the distance that the trucks must transport the material. Q. Why is this objective important? A. Shorter distances would reduce both the chances of accidents and the costs of transportation. Q. Why is this important? A. Accidents cause automotive injuries and fatalities and, in our case, exposure of the public to hazardous material. Q. Have you considered whether distance is the only factor relevant to determining the number and seriousness of truck accidents, and the number of people likely to be exposed to the hazardous material if there is an accident? A. Good point! We should minimize exposure in order to reduce the health impacts of the hazardous material. Q. Why is it important to reduce health impacts? A. That’s obviously important.3\n\nAt this point, we have reached the decision maker’s fundamental objective—the basis for the next phase of the problem-solving process. Note that stopping with the first stated objective—minimizing the distance that the material is transported by trucks— would have significantly narrowed the range of possible solutions and, indeed, led to a putative “solution” that might have exacerbated rather than solved the underlying problem. Let’s try this again a little closer to home and, for the first time, engage Fred Gordon in a conversation to try to get to the heart of the problem of homelessness as he views it.\n\n34\n\nChapter 2\n\nQ. Why is homelessness a problem? A. Homeless families need shelter. Q. That sounds more like a particular solution. We’ll come to solutions later. But first, why is homelessness a problem? A. Because no one should have to live on the streets. Q. Why is living on the streets a problem? A. People are exposed to the elements—cold, rain, snow, heat. Q. And why is that a problem? A. It is uncomfortable and unhealthy. Also, they lack adequate sanitation. Q. Why is that a problem? A. It creates health issues for them, and they may also infect others. But there’s a more basic problem as well. Being homeless deprives people of dignity, privacy, and personal security. Q. You are making some assumptions of fact here—I’m wondering particularly about your statement that homeless people may infect others. How certain are you that this is correct? A. Well, that’s what I’ve heard. Q. We’ll return to that later. But meanwhile, why is the problem important to you as a philanthropist? A. I empathize with people who have to endure these hardships. Q. There are many poor people in your city who are not homeless, but they and their families suffer similar hardships. Why do you want to limit the scope of your philanthropy to the homeless? A. Maybe in a few years, we’ll expand our philanthropy to others. But I believe that it’s good to begin with a focus. Also, to tell you the truth, I’m affected by what I see on my way to work every morning—a line of homeless people, including mothers and their children, waiting patiently for a meal at a church. Q. OK. I’ve got that. But why are you concerned only with homeless people in your city rather than more broadly, even globally? Is that a matter of focus too? A. No, it’s a matter of personal preference. I was born in this city and have spent my life here, and I’m committed to it. Also, I\n\nProblem Analysis\n\n35\n\nfeel more comfortable when I can see the results of my philanthropy rather than being informed I’m doing good somewhere else.\n\nAs the dialogue with Fred illustrates, the way that any of us think of a problem is affected by our preconceptions and personal experiences. The dialogue with Peggy reflects her quite different perspective. Q. What do you feel is the problem with homelessness in your city? A. We need to move homeless people out of town. Q. That sounds more like a particular solution. We’ll come to solutions later. But first, why is homelessness a problem? A. Homeless people congregate in some residential and business neighborhoods. Q. Why is this a problem? A. You should see the homeless encampment blocking the sidewalks just down the street from my office! Q. And why is that a problem? A. They disturb and frighten people and make it uncomfortable for residents and business patrons to walk on the streets. They reduce residents’ quality of life, lower property values, and reduce merchants’ revenues. People won’t want to do business in the city, and it will lead to the city’s decay. Plus, the homeless people abuse drugs, and some engage in criminal behavior. Also, many of these people have diseases, which they may pass on to other residents. Q. That sounds like you are making some big factual assumptions. How certain are you that they actually cause those problems? A: Well, that’s what I’ve heard. Q. We’ll return to that question. But meanwhile, why is the problem important to you as a philanthropist? A. I am a resident of the city and a taxpayer. My husband and I own some businesses. Our neighbors and business associates are adversely affected.\n\n36\n\nChapter 2\n\nQ. Aren’t there some other major problems, such as poor schools, a crumbling infrastructure, and poor public services that adversely affect the same individuals and businesses? Why not try to address those? A. As Fred said, it’s good to have some focus. Moreover, addressing those problems would involve us in political advocacy, something I’m uncomfortable with even if it’s a legitimate activity for a foundation.\n\nPeggy and Fred each described the problem of homelessness in terms of their own, distinctive frames based on their personal experiences. In the dialogue with Fred, we suggested two alternative frames for viewing the problem: problems of the poor rather than just the homeless poor and problems of homeless people beyond his city. These would have significantly increased the scope of his philanthropy. And in the dialogue with Peggy, we suggested broadening her frame from problems she believed homeless people created for the city’s residents and businesses to problems the residents and businesses faced from other sources as well. As it turned out, they rejected our suggestions, and we didn’t argue with their decisions. The purpose of the dialogue was to help them explore alternative frames, not to impose any on them. The Gordons’ conceptions of the problem of homelessness are shaped by their experiences and images. More generally, the images, metaphors, and labels that you bring to a problem can have a powerful framing effect. Do you view negotiation as a game, a war, or a collaboration? In an interesting experiment, participants played a prisoner’s dilemma–type game in which they had the choice of cooperating or defecting. Those who were told that the exercise was called the “Wall Street game” were more likely to defect than those told it was called the “community game.” 4 Just thinking about the game one way or another changed the way they behaved. In the context of philanthropy, consider the terms that foundations use to refer to their grantees: “customers,” “partners,” and\n\nProblem Analysis\n\n37\n\n“agents.” While “customer” captures the importance of maintaining a good relationship, it ignores the fact that the real beneficiaries are the communities and individuals that the foundation and grantees are serving. “Partner” captures some ideal aspects of the relationship but ignores the imbalance of power that often separates funders and grantees. “Agent” captures the power relationship but understates the importance of the grantee’s autonomy. Although we haven’t heard the term used in philanthropy, one might also consider the grantee as a “seller” of services to the funder. You can’t avoid using metaphors, but be conscious of their hidden meanings; don’t become their prisoner as you frame a problem. Framing a problem too narrowly is not an error unique to novice philanthropists. Consider this whopper of an error made for decades by the United Nations and many organizations funding K–12 education in the poorest developing countries. In response to the statistic that one hundred million children—mostly girls— in developing countries received no education at all, many bilateral and multinational donor agencies framed the problem solely in terms of barriers to access to elementary education. Adopted in 2000, Goal 2 of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG2) defined universal primary education in terms of enrollment.5 But MDG2 neglected the scandalously poor education that often occurred within schools and the fact that merely removing barriers would stress systems that were already operating on the margin. School fees were correctly understood as a significant barrier, and enrollments in Malawi jumped by 62 percent in the first year that the country provided free primary education. But the shock in demand exacerbated already overcrowded classrooms and shortages of teachers, textbooks, and materials. And this, in turn, led to a reduction in enrollments—not because of barriers to access but because ineffectual schooling didn’t seem worth sacrificing the child’s help with household work or tending the farm. It is now understood that getting students into the classroom\n\n38\n\nChapter 2\n\ndoesn’t come close to ensuring that they are learning. Though lack of attendance is part of the problem, it is also a symptom. Obtaining an education depends on factors such as whether there are books in the classroom, whether the teachers are adequately trained, whether the teachers show up, whether students are physically healthy and sufficiently fed so that they can focus their minds on learning, and whether it is safe for them to walk to school or spend the day there. The new UN Sustainable Development Goal, adopted in 2015, is to “ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning.”6\n\nElements of an Effective Problem Statement Our dialogues with Fred and Peggy Gordon were intended to help them develop effective problem statements, much like the UN’s 2015 revised statement on education. At this point, Fred and Peggy might describe their respective understandings of the problem in the following ways. Fred would say, “Homelessness deprives individuals and families of dignity, privacy, health, and personal security.” Peggy would say, “Homeless people adversely affect the economy and the quality of life for other individuals in the city.” In our view, an effective problem statement has these characteristics: • It gets to the heart of the problem—what the problem is really about. • It identifies your intended beneficiaries—for whom you are solving the problem. • It is not a particular solution in disguise but is sufficiently broad to admit to a range of solutions and not foreclose any plausible ones. • It avoids hidden and dubious factual assumptions. The dialogues with Fred and Peggy were intended to help them get to the heart of the problem as each one of them sees it. Let’s see how their problem statements fit the other criteria.\n\nProblem Analysis\n\n39\n\nIdentifying Intended Beneficiaries For whom are you solving the problem? Each of our philanthropists identified a different group of intended beneficiaries—for Fred, it was the homeless people dwelling on the streets; for Peggy, it was the residents and businesses of areas of the city where homeless people tend to congregate. Later on, it will be interesting to see if we can figure out a solution that works for both of them. Even if we look at the problem just from Fred’s perspective, there are a number of possible beneficiaries, including • single homeless individuals • homeless families • homeless children • homeless veterans • runaway kids who have no safe place to live • chronically homeless people suffering from addiction, physical, and mental problems • people who are not yet homeless but vulnerable to being evicted It is unlikely that we can help craft a solution that effectively addresses all of these beneficiaries’ needs. Peggy obviously has a different set of beneficiaries in mind. Some solutions to the problems affecting homeless people themselves may also solve the problem of the beneficiaries on whom she is focused. But from the perspective of the residents and businesses who are Peggy’s concern, homelessness is a different problem than it is for the other beneficiaries. This suggests that you can’t define the problem without describing the intended beneficiaries of your potential solution. Sometimes, what might be initially described as a unitary problem may have multiple beneficiaries, and the solutions might work better for some than for others, or even at the expense of others. Consider the problem that “audiences for classical music are\n\n40\n\nChapter 2\n\nshrinking.” The solutions may differ depending on whether the intended beneficiaries are (1) the audiences who lack exposure to classical music, (2) children who are less likely to learn musical instruments, or (3) professional musicians who can’t earn a living. A 2010 report by the Institute of Medicine notes that cases of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa will greatly outstrip the availability of treatment by 2020. It urges nations to intensify prevention rather than treatment measures as the best long-term strategy for combating the disease. “Because treatment will only reach a fraction of those who need it, . . . preventing new infections should be the central tenet of any long term response to HIV/ AIDS in Africa.”7 Notice that preventing cases of HIV/AIDS will benefit different individuals than curing existing cases—people who are not yet infected rather than those who already have the disease. While the former approach has greater long-term public health benefits, its individual beneficiaries are not identifiable, while the beneficiaries of treatment know just who they are and may object vehemently to being denied curative drugs. There’s a well-known psychological phenomenon known as the “identifiable victim effect,”8 which describes philanthropists’ and policy makers’ willingness to spend enormous resources to aid individuals known to be in distress, while being reluctant to spend much to prevent the same harm from occurring to myriad anonymous people. What choice would you make if you had to allocate scarce dollars to HIV/AIDS prevention or cure?\n\nAvoiding Premature Solutions In their dialogues, both Fred and Peggy proposed particular solutions. Of course, they eventually need to choose and implement a solution. But first they need to understand more about the problem. Fred and Peggy are not unique in their tendency to fix on solutions too early. This can be a by-product of what is often a constructive “fix-it” mentality. But it can also be the result of what the French call an “idée fixe,” or the old saying that “to a person with\n\nProblem Analysis\n\n41\n\na hammer, every problem looks like a nail.” Consider what solutions are foreclosed by these problem statements, and articulate a better description of the underlying problem: • The problem of obesity is that consumers lack information about the nutritional and caloric content of junk foods. • Inner-city elementary school children don’t have enough after- school tutoring programs.\n\nEmpirical Assumptions Almost every problem description contains empirical assumptions: something in the water is causing fish to die; the transportation of hazardous materials might cause harm to the city’s residents; audiences for classical music are shrinking. With an understanding of whom Peggy and Fred wish to benefit, let’s return to our philanthropist couple and the empirical assumptions that underlie their descriptions of the problem of homelessness. Fred focused on what he believed to be the needs and interests of homeless individuals and families, such as dignity, privacy, health, and personal security. Peggy focused on what she believed to be the needs and interests of residents, businesses, and communities adversely affected by the homeless: personal safety and security, revenues, and quality of life. How could the philanthropists move beyond their assumptions about the needs and interests of beneficiaries to learn what they actually are? One important source of information is the beneficiaries themselves. As Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, wisely noted, “Listening to and learning from those we seek to help is essential for us to enhance our impact. . . . Listening can help us more intimately understand our institutional ignorance and biases, and allow us to learn about how we can do better.”9 Our philanthropists want to improve other people’s lives, but their intended beneficiaries are likely to know their own needs better than Fred and Peggy do. This means that Fred, or perhaps a skilled observer working on his behalf, would go out on\n\n42\n\nChapter 2\n\nthe streets to observe and listen to homeless people in their environment to learn what they believe their problems and needs are. Peggy could observe how homeless people interact with residents and shoppers. She could also talk with her intended beneficiaries to learn what they believe their problems and needs are. Both Fred and Peggy were concerned with health among the homeless population and the likelihood that they infected other residents. Here, the views of potential beneficiaries pale beside scientific data. Epidemiological studies indicate that rates of tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and hepatitis C are much greater among the homeless than in the general population.10 Because these diseases are transmitted by close contact or sharing needles, however, the principal risk of infection is to other homeless people, not to the population at large.11 Although we can take risk of general infection off the table, there is plenty left to sort through. Fred’s statement that “homelessness deprives individuals and families of dignity, privacy, health, and personal security” seems pretty obviously correct— though, for some, the problems may originate in the underlying conditions that lead to their homelessness. Peggy’s statement that “homeless people adversely affect the economy and the quality of life for other individuals in the city” may be less self-evident. In any event, we should help her get some sense of the scope of these problems. If they are of small magnitude, it may not be worth funding a program to reduce or eliminate them. To learn more, Peggy could ask the city’s law enforcement officials for their records or retain someone with the appropriate skills to survey residents and business owners.\n\nUnderstanding Problem Causes Identifying dubious empirical assumptions hidden in a problem statement clears the deck for accurately diagnosing the causes of a problem and relating them to possible solutions. We identify problem causes, not to narrow possible solutions to those that\n\nProblem Analysis\n\n43\n\nwould address so-called root causes, but rather to open up a range of possible solutions. For example, if you are concerned about the devastating effects of malaria, understanding how the disease is propagated is essential to identifying possible points of intervention—reducing the population of mosquitoes through poison or genetics or eliminating their habitats; protecting people against mosquitoes through bed nets or developing better antimalarial medicines or a vaccine. If you are concerned about the depletion of salmon in the Pacific Northwest, you must understand why they are being depleted. Is the cause overfishing, pollution from farms running into spawning streams, dams on the spawning streams—or all three? If you are concerned about the high rate of teen pregnancies in your community, you need to understand why teenage girls get pregnant. Are the pregnancies intended and, if so, why? If not, why are the young people not taking adequate precautions? Are they aware of contraceptive methods? Do they have access to contraception? If we are mistaken about the causes of the problem, our understanding of the beneficiaries’ needs may be incorrect and our solutions may be ineffective. For example, imagine a British organization or government agency concerned with addressing the outbreak of cholera in a London neighborhood in 1854. Under one prevailing folk theory, cholera was caused by a miasma, or bad air. You might recommend that residents stay indoors or wear masks when they are outside (Figure 1). In what may have been the first example of modern epidemiology, the English physician John Snow discovered that cholera was caused by water-borne bacteria. This led to the solution of removing the pump handle from the neighborhood’s contaminated water supply.12 For a contemporary example, consider these questions: Are greenhouse gas emissions created by humans contributing to climate change, and does climate change have catastrophic consequences? If, contrary to the beliefs of virtually all climate scientists, those who deny these causal connections were correct, then\n\n44\n\nChapter 2\n\nFIGURE 1.\n\nAdvice for preventing cholera\n\nall the proposed remedies of reducing greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., replacing fossil-fuel energy production with renewables) would be as worthless as staying indoors to avoid cholera. People sometimes say that the best solution is one aimed at the “root cause” of the problem. In the case of climate change, reducing the production of greenhouse gases is almost surely the best solution. But it would be folly to exclude other solutions, such as sequestering those gases or adapting to climate change by protecting low-lying areas against what is now an inevitable rise in sea level.\n\nProblem Analysis\n\n45\n\nSometimes, directly addressing the root cause is not costeffective or even possible. The root cause of malaria is the Plasmodium parasite, carried by Anopheles mosquitoes. But current technologies are not up to eliminating the parasite or its carrier. Nonetheless, drugs and insecticide-treated bed nets can prevent people from contracting malaria, and medicines can cure or mitigate its effects. There are many causes of homelessness—for example, poverty, lack of affordable housing, natural disasters, drug and alcohol abuse, mental and physical illness, and posttraumatic stress disorders. Victims of domestic violence may also need to leave their homes to maintain their safety or the safety of their children. Would you recommend that Fred and Peggy Gordon tackle only root causes in addressing the problem of homelessness in their city?\n\nBefore You Begin to Solve the Problem At the beginning of this chapter we wrote that, in its broadest sense, a problem is a situation in which something is less than ideal—where the world as it is varies from the world as we would like it to be. Of course, it is seldom possible for a solution to a social, environmental, or health problem to actually achieve the ideal world. But having this aspiration in mind can help you develop an ambitious but realistic intended outcome and strategy for achieving it, even if it falls far short of your ideal. In considering solutions, you should aim for one that maximizes the achievement of your most important objective and, if possible, also achieves other important objectives without having unintended bad side effects. While it is not always possible to “have it all,” you should at least know what that would mean. For Fred, the ideal is that no person his city suffers the hardships of homelessness. For Peggy, it is that no resident or business in the city is adversely affected by homeless people. With a clear problem statement and an analysis of the causes of the problem, you are almost ready to address the problem (what-\n\n46\n\nChapter 2\n\never it may be) for your beneficiaries (whoever they may be). But you are probably not the first person to try to solve this problem, so it would be wise to discover who else is tackling the problem, what you can learn from them, and, indeed, whether you can collaborate with them. There might already be organizations addressing the problems of homelessness in Fred and Peggy’s own city. Possibly, they’re concerned with a segment of the homeless population—say, runaway teens—that is not the Gordons’ particular focus. Or perhaps the organizations are poorly run and ineffective. But maybe there’s an organization that’s doing an excellent job of serving the very populations that concern the Gordons. If so, the Gordons might decide to support their work rather than start a new organization. And even if there’s no local organization that would achieve their goals, before taking the big step of starting their own organization, the Gordons can learn a great deal from the strategies, successes, and failures of efforts to address homelessness in other places.\n\nApplication to Your Own Philanthropy 1. Describe a Social Problem That Interests You Throughout Part 2, we ask you to develop a strategy to solve a social (or environmental or health) problem of your own choice— for example, drug addiction, energy use, animal rights, or whatever. Choose a problem in which you have a deep interest and describe it in a few sentences.\n\n2. Get to the Heart of the Problem Assume that you are the founder of a new organization created to address the problem that you just described. Invent a dialogue between you and a trusted, tough-minded, demanding colleague to help clarify the problem by getting to its heart. (You don’t actually have to work with a colleague; just be a playwright and create the script.) The dialogue should have these elements:\n\nProblem Analysis\n\n47\n\n• Your colleague begins by asking why the problem the organization is trying to solve is a problem. • One of your answers mistakenly includes a solution to the problem. • Your colleague (more or less gently) tells you that you need to get a deeper understanding of the problem before coming up with solutions, and continues asking “why”-type questions.\n\n3. Write an Effective Problem Description Examine the dialogue you just wrote. Now, rewrite the description of the problem that the organization is trying to solve, while (1) minimizing empirical assumptions and (2) avoiding including solutions in the problem description. Does this problem description make any empirical assumptions? If so, how would you test them?\n\n4. Identify Problem Causes Using the problem description you just wrote, identify several of the significant causes underlying the problem, say why you believe they are significant causes, and describe how confident you are in your belief.\n\nChapter 3\n\nDEVELOPING SOLUTIONS\n\nNow that we have identified some of the major causes of the problem, we can start to look at a range of potential solutions. First, we should undertake a scan of various approaches to addressing the problem.\n\nFundamental Approaches to Philanthropic Problem Solving What do we mean by approaches? Most of the great variety of work done by nonprofit organizations, governments, and public institutions can be placed in three general categories, which we return to later in the book. Promoting knowledge. Philanthropists support basic and applied research and other forms of knowledge development in fields ranging from medicine to rocket science, philosophy, and political theory. For example, the Laura and John Arnold Foundation supports evaluations to learn which social interventions work and do not work. Philanthropists also support building fields by helping link researchers, theorists, practitioners, advocates, organizations, and policy makers concerned with common problems. For example, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation is working to create a field linking the many stakeholders involved in cybersecu-\n\nDeveloping Solutions\n\n49\n\nrity; and a consortium of foundations, under the umbrella of the Water Funders Initiative, is working to build a field to address issues of water security and safety. Improving individual lives. When you think about charities, the chances are that the first ones that come to mind are nonprofits that provide direct services—to disadvantaged youth, the homeless, drug addicts, and so forth. Many nonprofits provide services to poor clients at no charge. Others, such as orchestras and theaters, depend on a combination of charitable donations and fees. Influencing policy makers and businesses. In recent decades, philanthropists have supported organizations using policy advocacy to mitigate global warming, reduce the unnecessary incarceration of convicts, and protect farm animals; and they have supported movements ranging from the Tea Party to marriage equality for gay and lesbian people. Returning to our philanthropists, the Gordons might well conclude that there’s sufficient knowledge about the causes of homelessness and its likely solutions that, rather than support further research, they want to take action. One possible approach would be to provide health care and other services to homeless people on the street. Although it offers immediate care, this intervention accepts the status quo of people living on the streets—in other words, it is unlikely to change the number of people who are without homes. Although it might begin to address Fred’s concerns, it wouldn’t address Peggy’s at all. Another example of direct services would be to provide permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless people—free housing combined with health and social services. Although it is much more expensive than on-the-street care, it has the potential to reduce homelessness—a definite advantage. And it addresses both philanthropists’ concerns. Yet another approach is to help individuals and families at risk of becoming homeless stay in their homes. This also involves service delivery in the form of defending families against eviction. Perhaps it also addresses both philanthropists’ concerns. But it\n\n50\n\nChapter 3\n\nimposes a cost on landlords by requiring them to keep on tenants who may not pay their rent on time, and this will likely lead to their opposition—and to Peggy’s as well. A very different approach would be to ameliorate the conditions that lead to homelessness, perhaps by advocating that employers be required to pay a living wage or that the city provide a basic minimum income. While it’s valuable to learn about these possible approaches, you cannot determine the most effective one for solving a particular problem at this early stage. Rather, you must first hypothesize plausible strategies and compare their feasibility. The two most fundamental criteria in choosing among these various approaches are (1) which will have the greatest impact in solving the problem and (2) which are within the philanthropist’s resources, acting alone or together with others. Predicting impact can be complicated. On the one hand, a service-delivery program that has proven successful in many other venues has a good chance of succeeding in your city. But it helps only one individual at a time. On the other hand, advocating policy change, if successful, can improve the lives of many individuals, but it is a risky strategy since policy advocacy often fails to achieve its objectives. So the choice of strategy will involve an estimation of risk and reward. When deciding whether you have the funds for a given strategy, you’ll want to consider factors such as scope and time frame as well as the possibility of cofunding or directly collaborating with others. We return to these issues later in the book.\n\nDeveloping Alternative Solutions We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them. —ALBERT EINSTEIN\n\nBefore fixing on a particular strategy to solve the problem, you need to consider alternative solutions. Just as the best description\n\nDeveloping Solutions\n\n51\n\nof the problem is not necessarily the first to come to mind, so it is for potential solutions or strategies. Earlier we suggested continually asking why? to identify your goals. Now ask how?, or (in the lingo of human-centered design) how might we? to generate solutions. The most fundamental rule is don’t stop with the first good idea that comes to mind. There may be better ones out there. It is often useful to begin by considering both solutions that maximize the achievement of your most important objective even at the expense of others, and those that simultaneously satisfy several important objectives even if they are not optimal for any one of them. Creativity in developing solutions to problems. The generation of alternative solutions calls for creativity. By creativity, we do not mean self-expression in the artistic sense but rather innovation akin to that of a scientist or engineer—creativity that is goal oriented and aims to come up with pragmatic solutions to a problem. This calls for a mind-set that views problem situations from multiple perspectives.1 Such creativity is often fostered by engaging in divergent thinking—imagining and generating a broad range of options—before evaluating, analyzing, criticizing, and narrowing down the range of alternatives. Some of the most creative breakthroughs occur “when an idea that works well in one domain gets grafted onto another and revitalizes it.”2 “Social marketing” is a good example. An innovator in the field, Population Services International, draws lessons from marketing products in the business sector to sell contraceptives and other health-related products at subsidized prices to the poorest people in Africa and other developing areas. In its roughly hundred-year history, American philanthropy has played a role in developing many creative solutions that have had real impact on society. Consider these examples: • public libraries • Sesame Street • insulin to treat diabetes\n\n52\n\nChapter 3\n\n• releasing poor criminal defendants on their own recognizance • creating the profession of the nurse-practitioner • the 911 phone emergency line • hospice care • painting lines on the shoulders of highways to prevent accidents • school vouchers3 You have the potential to fund equally important breakthroughs in the coming decades. After all is said and done, however, it may turn out that the best solution to a problem is a triedand-true approach—but you can’t know that until you have considered other possibilities. In any event, the ultimate test is not whether a solution is novel or innovative but whether it works. Indeed, we have seen novelty per se drive so many philanthropic decisions at the expense of bringing effective existing strategies to scale that we’re tempted to propose a ten-year moratorium on the very use of the word “innovation.” Returning to our philanthropist couple: Fred and Peggy Gordon considered their various choices. After much research about approaches that have worked elsewhere and discussions with Casa, the major homelessness organization in their city, they decide that the most promising approach would involve a “housingfirst” permanent supportive housing program. The main beneficiaries of this intervention will be chronically homeless single men. The Gordons realize that this will not reduce the number of evictions by people in danger of becoming homeless or serve all members of the homeless population. But it has the promise of reducing the current number of homeless individuals in their city. Fred likes this approach because it meets his desire to help people who are homeless live safely and with dignity. Peggy thinks it is the right approach because it addresses her concern about getting homeless people off the street. Permanent supportive housing will offer chronically home-\n\nDeveloping Solutions\n\n53\n\nless people free housing, combined with what are called wraparound support services that address problems of physical and mental health and substance abuse; where possible, it will also help them prepare them for employment. Under a housing-first program, people are provided long-term housing with no preconditions—although strong efforts are made to induce them to accept drug, mental health, or other counseling where appropriate to their needs.4 When the Gordons began discussions with Casa, the organization already provided housing for the homeless without any supplemental support in two "
