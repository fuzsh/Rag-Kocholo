        "text": "Comprehensive\n\nZero Trust should never focus on a narrow technology. Instead, it should consider the full ecosystem of controls–network, endpoint, cloud, application, IoT, identity and more–that many organizations rely on for protection.\n\nActionable\n\nImplementing Zero Trust isn’t easy, but getting started shouldn’t be hard. Consider what current set of controls can be immediately leveraged. Once your Zero Trust foundation is established, we’ll help you go to what’s next.\n\nIntelligible\n\nZero Trust is not a service, it’s a concept–and a simple one at that: trust nothing. Rather than explaining specialized point solutions in geek speak, Zero Trust is easily conveyed to nontechnical executives. Trust nothing, validate everything. Always.\n\nScalable\n\nWe can’t get you to use our framework if it doesn’t make your enterprise more secure and spend less. Palo Alto Networks offers a lot of products, and while we don’t do it all, we strive to be a resource for your entire Zero Trust journey.\n\nWhat is Zero Trust?\n\nZero Trust is a strategic approach to cybersecurity that secures an organization by eliminating implicit trust and continuously validating every stage of a digital interaction.\n\nWho is Zero Trust For?\n\nZero Trust is for any enterprise that requires a secure network. So, if you’re going through a network transformation, if your data center is moving to the cloud, or if you’re going through a SecOps transformation, Zero Trust is for you.\n\nWhen should you implement Zero Trust?\n\nIf cybersecurity is important to you, and if your enterprise does not currently have a Zero Trust policy in place, the time is now to implement . Establishing Zero Trust is an opportunity for you to properly rebuild your security network, from the ground up.\n\nBetter Security Outcomes\n\nZero Trust removes all implicit trust and continuously validates every stage of a digital interaction. Taking a holistic approach to Zero Trust means, policies and controls must apply across users, applications and infrastructure to reduce risk and complexity while achieving enterprise resilience.\n\nSimplified Infrastructure\n\nThe average enterprise runs 45 cybersecurity-related tools on its network.1 With more tools comes more complexity, and complexity creates security gaps. Zero Trust creates an opportunity to rebuild security in a way that meets digital transformation goals while reducing risk and overall complexity.\n\n1. The More Cybersecurity Tools an Enterprise Deploys, the Less Effective Their Defense Is\n\nLower operational costs\n\nInstead of having multiple nonintegrated security controls across all domains, rely on one single control, which can be deployed across the entire organization. With a Zero Trust approach, security becomes a single use case reducing the cost of deployment and operations."
