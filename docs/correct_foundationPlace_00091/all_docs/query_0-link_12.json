        "text": "Such an earthquake is light. It is felt indoors by many, outdoors by few during the day. At night, some awaken. Dishes, windows, doors are disturbed; walls make cracking sounds. A sensation like a heavy truck is striking the building can be felt. Standing motor cars rock noticeably.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe Augurisk Earthquake Hazard index is defined at the U.S. Census block level. It is based on the intensity of the earthquake happening in your block with a 2% probability over the next 50 years, and computed using data from USGS (Rukstales and Petersen, 2019). Intensity is defined based on the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale (MMI). All scores are normalized to a 0-100 scale.\n\nReferences\n\nRukstales, K.S., and Petersen, M.D., 2019, Data Release for 2018 Update of the U.S. National Seismic Hazard Model: U.S. Geological Survey data release, https://doi.org/10.5066/P9WT5OVB. More information on the Modified Mercalli Index and its interpretation can be found on usgs.gov.\n\nMore details\n\nThe Air Pollution Hazard Score is moderate (49.91) for the closest AQI monitor (San Jose - Knox Ave), located 16.49 miles away from Palo Alto.\n\nThe maximum recorded AQI over the last 3 years is Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (109). The maximum recorded AQI over the last 3 years is Unhealthy (182.37). In such circumstances, everyone may begin to experience adverse health effects, and members of sensitive groups may experience more serious effects.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe Augurisk Air Pollution hazard score is defined at the U.S. block level. It is based on the daily median and maximal air quality values recorded at the nearest U.S. EPA AQI monitor over the last 3 years. All values are normalized to a 0-100 scale. To avoid disturbances in the distribution of risk scores, specific transformations to the higher percentiles of selected variables (i.e. winsorization) were applied to the maximal recorded AQI variable.\n\nReferences\n\nAQI data was collected from the U.S. EPA AirNow program. Map data is provided by Air Now Current Monitor Data Public on ESRI. More information on the U.S. AQI computation and interpretation can be found on the AirNow website.\n\nMore details\n\nThe Socioeconomic risk score for Palo Alto is very low. In 2018, your county had a $118k Median Household Income and a 2.6% unemployment rate, as compared to the $51.2k and 4.13% national averages. Besides, its average educational attainment, poverty rate and income inequality levels were higher than respectively 72%, 8% and 33% of all U.S. counties."
