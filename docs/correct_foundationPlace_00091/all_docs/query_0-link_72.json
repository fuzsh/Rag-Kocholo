        "text": "The Alamo Community College District Emergency Management Program (EMP) is a District-wide program that guides the emergency personnel and resources before, during and after a natural, technological or human-caused incident. Although this program does not cover every conceivable situation, it does provide comprehensive administrative procedures necessary to respond effectively to incidents caused by threats in the all-hazards environment. The Alamo Colleges Emergency Management Program manages, coordinates and supports planning, training, and exercises necessary to enable all Alamo Colleges to protect against, respond to, and recover from natural and human-caused emergencies.\n\nThe first priority and obligation of the District, within the limits of its resources, is the safety and health of students, employees and guests in the event of an emergency, disruption, and/or major interruption in the District's mission and operations.\n\nThe Alamo Colleges Alert Notification System alerts you to severe weather and other emergencies using phone calls, emails and/or text messages. So it’s critical for you to keep your contact information updated so we can deliver the most accurate and up-to-the-minute news to you in an emergency. To find out how to update your contact information in ACES, click on the Help Guide on the right hand side of this page.\n\nThe Emergency Notification System enables us to schedule, send and track personalized voice messages to up to six phone numbers per person and immediately send messages four different ways:\n\n• Voice messages to home phones, work phones, cell phones and email addresses\n\n• *Text messages to cell phones, PDA’s and other text-based devices\n\n• Text messages to email accounts\n\n• Messages to TTY/TDD receiving devices for the hearing impaired\n\nContact information will only be used for Alamo Colleges’ notifications and will not be made available to any other service.\n\n*Text messaging will be sent to the text enabled cell phone number provided in your personal information in ACES. By entering your cell phone number, you opt in to receive text messaging from the emergency notification system. For information on opting out of the text messaging option, see the FAQ in the right hand column of this page.\n\nAn active shooter is someone with a firearm who is firing the weapon or threatening to fire the weapon near or on District property.\n\nThe response of people on campus can be summarized in the phrase: RUN, HIDE, FIGHT.\n\nActions to take by anyone on the campus:\n\nMove To A Place of Safety\n\nYour goal should be to get away from the area of the shooter, or not be visible to the shooter. If you can leave and go to a place of safety, get out quickly, but be alert to the possibility of other gunmen.\n\nHide Securely Where You Are Located\n\nIf you are secure, stay at your location until instructed to leave and follow the instructions of ACPD officials. In most cases, the shooter will not stop until engaged by outside force. Attempt to rescue other people only if you can do so without further end-angering those inside a secured area.\n\nPerform the following:\n\nLock and barricade doors\n\nTurn off lights and close blinds\n\nTurn off radios, televisions, and monitors\n\nKeep occupants calm, quiet, and out of sight using available protection (i.e. concrete walls, thick desks, and filing cabinets)\n\nUsing cover, have occupants spread out as much as possible, silence all cell phone ringers, and quietly notify the ACPD at 485-0911; identify who you are, your location, and the situation. Do not hang up the phone until you are told to do so.\n\nFight to Protect Your Life\n\nQuietly discuss among those present a plan in case the shooter is able to enter your area. “Think survival.”\n\nPrepare to use whatever resources you have to fight the shooter if he or she breaks into the room.\n\nCONTACTING AUTHORITIES WHEN YOU ARE IN AN ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION\n\nCalling 485-0911 from a campus phone will place you in contact with ACPD. Calling 9-911 from a campus phone will help you reach the San Antonio Police Department and ACPD.\n\nWhat to report:\n\nYour specific location - building name and office/room number;\n\nNumber of people at your specific location;\n\nInjuries - number injured, types of injuries;\n\nAssailant's location, number of suspects, race, gender, clothing description, physical features; and\n\nTypes of weapon(s) (e.g. long gun or handgun), backpack, shooter's identity if already known, etc.\n\nPolice Response\n\nFollow ACPD directions and do not make immediate or quick movements. (Officers are there to eliminate the threat and you do not want to be mistaken as a threat.) Keep your hands in the open with fingers spread apart.\n\nThe primary objective of the ACPD is to:\n\nImmediately isolate and engage the assailant.\n\nNOTE: THESE ACTIONS ALSO APPLY TO ANY ACTIVE ASSAILANT. THEY MAY POSSESS OTHER WEAPONS, AND NOT A FIREARM.\n\nHazardous materials releases (in air, water, or on the ground/building floor) may be of a minor nature and easily managed at the site. The material may have little direct threat to most people, but there are people with extreme sensitivities to many common chemicals. Therefore, the District/Colleges will always take conservative action to protect people immediately by evacuating them from the site and moving them Upwind, Uphill and Upstream from any hazardous material release.\n\nIn the event of an incident, the District/Colleges should:\n\nImmediately report all hazardous chemical spills (large/small) to ACPD, ERM, and the Facilities Department.\n\nProvide the exact location of the spill such as the room number, building number, and the name of the campus.\n\nFollow detailed safety procedures in the chemical hygiene and/or HAZCOM plans in place at the campus laboratories or shops where chemicals and gases are used and stored.\n\nIf a chemical spill is discovered, or if there is a release of toxic gases, and there are trained individuals in the area:\n\nExtinguish open flames in the area if it is safe to do so;\n\nIf there are vapors or noxious fumes, evacuate the affected area or building and do not re-enter the area until authorized personnel give the ‘All Clear’message.\n\nAll personnel shall vacate the immediate area and the building, unless instructed otherwise by the Building Coordinator, ACPD and ERM.\n\nERM shall arrange to have a certified environmental vendor evaluate and respond to the cleanup and proper disposal of any hazardous waste material.\n\nIndividuals who have been contaminated shall be isolated. EMS and/or a fire service HAZMAT Team shall decontaminate all exposed employees and students as needed. Employees must, as soon as possible, report the contamination to ERM through ACPD or by completing an Employee Injury Report.\n\nIf a hazardous chemical spill occurs outside on the major interstate highways, railroads, shipping lanes, etc., near the College or other District properties, and the toxic fumes are approaching the campus, employees, students, and guests shall shelter-in-place and shut off ventilation systems, unless otherwise directed to take other actions by ERM, ACPD, the HAZMAT Team, and/or the Emergency Response Personnel.\n\nERM shall immediately notify the Facilities Department responsible for the District office or College campus to shut-off the fresh air intakes on the ventilation systems to prevent toxic fumes from entering the buildings and exposing employees, students, and/or guests to the potential health hazard.\n\nACPD and first responders shall establish an Incident Command Post to assess the hazardous situation. The Incident Command Post shall be flexible and/or mobile and positioned upwind from the toxic fumes or spill.\n\nAll individuals contaminated by the chemical spill shall be evacuated and separated from others. Their names shall be provided to the ERT, ERM, ACPD, HAZMAT Team, and EMS. The HAZMAT Team and EMS shall immediately render first aid and start the proper decontamination process.\n\nIf evacuation is directed, when the building emergency alarm systems are activated, all employees, students, and guests shall proceed calmly/quickly to the nearest marked exit and to the pre-determined designated Assembly Areas. If the primary exit is obstructed, use the alternative exit. A Building Coordinator should direct you to a safe Assembly Area Upwind, Uphill, and Upstream\n\nAll employees shall assist people with mobility restriction who are exiting the building/buildings.\n\nOnce outside, keep streets, fire lanes, hydrants and walkways, clear for emergency vehicles and crews.\n\nDO NOT RETURN TO AN EVACUATED BUILDING OR LEAVE THE DESIGNATED ASSEMBLY AREAS unless instructed by Building Coordinators.\n\nIf requested, ACPD, ERM, and/or Facilities shall assist Emergency Response Personnel as necessary.\n\nThe District/Colleges work diligently with ERM Environmental Health & Safety staff to ensure that highly toxic chemicals are properly used, stored and disposed when present on District property. The District also maintains a Right-To-Know Program that includes a complete inventory list of all chemicals and the Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) to track and identify the chemicals in the District/College so staff and first responders will be able to identify and locate chemicals currently in use. However, some hazardous materials incidents may happen off District property on fixed hazardous materials facilities and from rail, plane, truck or pipeline accidents. The District/College must take immediate actions to move people away from the threat, or in fast moving events, shelter people inside and close off ventilation systems. Each incident will require a timely evaluation and response between District/College ERT staff and first responders.\n\nIMPORTANT:After evacuation, report to your pre-determined designated Assembly Areas. Do not leave because each supervisor and instructor must perform accountability at the designated Assembly Areas. Individuals not accounted for and/or missing must be reported immediately to the BAT Building Coordinator, EOC ERT and the Incident Commander at the Incident Command Post.\n\nIn the event someone within the Alamo Colleges community (employee, student or visitor) experiences a medical emergency, the following steps should be followed:\n\nEnsure that the scene is safe before entering. If the scene is safe, do not attempt to move the victim until it is safe.\n\nCall or have someone call 911 (see steps below) and ACPD at 485-0911.\n\nProvide first responder care within the scope and limits of your training. Continue care until more advanced help arrives or the scene becomes unsafe.\n\nA medical emergency can be defined as any situation where the victim experiences any of the following conditions:\n\nUnconscious or in an altered level of consciousness, such as drowsy or confused\n\nBreathing problem or no breathing\n\nSevere or persistent chest pain lasting more than a few minutes\n\nPersistent abdominal pain or pressure\n\nSevere external bleeding\n\nVomiting or passing blood\n\nCritical burns (2nd or 3rd degree) covering more than 10% of body\n\nSuspected poisoning\n\nExperiencing seizures\n\nStroke Injuries to the head, neck or spine\n\nPainful, swollen or deformed areas or open fracture\n\nAny injury or illness where advanced medical care is needed\n\nWhen calling 911 you should provide as much information about the victim and scene as possible, such as:\n\nNature (e.g., medical) and address of emergency (street, building, floor, room, etc.)\n\nAge and gender of victim\n\nSymptoms\n\nExisting health conditions and Medications victim takes (if known)\n\nDo not hang up until the emergency operator instructs you to do so\n\nNote: Under no circumstances should an employee or student attempt to transport a victim to the hospital or clinic.\n\nEmergency Medical Services (EMS) should be called to transport the injured as they have equipment and skills to manage a victim if their conditions worsen, and can reach the closest trauma center faster and safer than people in personal vehicles can.\n\nDirections for Reporting Injuries or Severe Illnesses\n\nAll medical emergencies involving employees, students and/or visitors should be reported as soon as possible to the ACPD and ERM by the staff member’s supervisor, the student’s faculty member, or the person doing business with a vendor.\n\nEmployees have a duty to immediately notify their direct supervisor of any known injury or illness. The direct supervisor shall notify ACPD and ERM.\n\nIf a student is injured during their participation in a credit or continuing education course, the responsible instructor must notify ACPD, ERM and the College VP for Student Success.\n\nShould a visitor become injured, the visiting College or District department shall notify ACPD and ERM.\n\nIncident Investigations\n\nThe Enterprise Risk Management Department may conduct an incident investigation to determine the root-cause of any injury or exposure event and provide corrective actions to avoid similar future incidents.\n\nWorkers Compensation Program\n\nIf an employee is injured or becomes ill because of performing their job duties for the Alamo Colleges, the District’s Workers’ Compensation Program will address any compensable injury or illness. The Workers’ Compensation Program is administered by ERM.\n\nVehicle fires are most likely to occur in College parking lots or garages. There are a few simple rules to remember if you encounter a vehicle fire.\n\nNotify ACPD or call 911 immediately.\n\nDo not move towards a burning vehicle unless you have appropriate fire-fighting extinguishers and there is a life-and-death extraction needed of someone in the vehicle. Vehicles can explode. You may become a victim.\n\nMove away from the area and stay away until fire personnel have extinguished the fire and ACPD announces it is safe to enter the area. There may not be a widespread “All Clear” message released if it is a minor, quickly resolved event.\n\nIf the ACPD decides a crime is associated with the fire, they may seal the area with stanchions and often with yellow and black tape. Under no circumstance should anyone except first responders enter the sealed area unless they are requested to enter by fire or law enforcement officials.\n\nIf your vehicle was damaged by the vehicle fire, contact your insurance company. The District is not responsible for damage to your vehicle when it is parked in a parking lot or garage.\n\nIf the vehicle was set on fire because of an emergency (wildfire, bomb, hazardous material explosion, etc.), contact your insurance company, not the District. Reestablish campus operations with critical operations starting first."
