Part of chapter 2 of the present work, \"Laughable Loves; or, The Impossible Don Juan,\" appeared in a slightly different version in The Review of Contemporary Fiction 9, no. 2 (Summer 1984):37—46. I wish to thank my editor, Joy Johannessen, for her intelligent and sensitive work.\n\nINTRODUCTION In his Jerusalem Address (1985), meditating on the European tradition of the novel, Milan Kundera asks: But what is that wisdom, what is the novel? There is a fine Jewish proverb: Man thinks, God laughs. Inspired by that adage, I like to imagine that Francois Rabelais heard God's laughter one day, and thus was born the idea of the first great European novel. It pleases me to think that the art of the novel came into the world as the echo of God's laughter. 1 This myth of origins, invented at the apex of his maturity by a novelist living in the age he has defined as one of terminal paradoxes, is strangely moving. It moves with the beauty of human reverence, touched by a deeply felt awareness of the radical mortality of all things human. The novel too is mortal, \"as mortal as the West of the Modern Era, \"2 says Kundera. But if one takes a second, more analytical look at Kundera's fable, one discerns the scenario for a comic skit involving two players whose modes of being are in essential contradiction. God, whose nature it is to rejoice in the full knowledge of his being, looks down on earth and catches man in the act of aping him, contorting himself silly in the effort to think out the truth of his own being as it keeps eluding him. Pascal said that man tries to make himself out an angel and makes a beast of himself. The problem, Kundera says, is that \"man is never what he thinks he is. \"3 Even Rabelais, who played with the Promethean myth of a usurping man capable of scaling Olympus, nevertheless ended his wise book with a parodistic portrayal of the mystery of human apotheosis in the guise of a descent into a wine cave. \"De vin on divin devient\"4 is the playful gloss handed down to Panurge and his companions during their ritual of enlightenment. We recall that Bacbuc's oracular injunction—to drink—is delivered at the end of a journey of discovery that took the questioners to the outer margins of the physical world, since the wise men cogitating dry in a mock Symposium had failed to heal Panurge's anguish. Kundera's gloss on the art of novelistic gnosis is permeated by the spirit of generative paradox, just like Bacbuc's formula, which can be instantly translated into a multiplicity of individual meanings by the initiates. Kundera's God would rather be entertained than sit in perpetual judgment over human imperfections. That is why he is moved to laughter by the spectacle of the thinking fool's antics. Man, catching an echo of that merriment and suddenly understanding, joins in to become for a brief instant, not God nor an angel, but the wise fool, a joyous master of his own laughter. Laughter, in Kundera's mind, figures as the locus of mystery where, in a moment of rare congruence, the human and the divine meet on the uncertain ground of creative possibility, never to be captured as a certainty. During the Renaissance, when the European novel was in its infancy, the art of paradoxy flourished in all the intricacy of its mutually entangled varieties. In her brilliant study of the Renaissance tradition of paradox, Paradoxia Epidemica, Rosalie Colie writes, \"One element common to all these kinds of paradox [the rhetorical, the logical, and the epistemological] is their exploitation of the fact of relative, or competing, value systems. The paradox is always somehow involved in dialectic; challenging some orthodoxy, the paradox is an oblique criticism of absolute judgment or absolute convention.\"5 Like laughter, paradox is a sworn enemy of all absolutes. In its unadulterated humanist form, it used to serve as a corrective to the totalitarian reductionism embedded in the logical operations of reason. A game of reason played at the extreme limits of the rational discourse, paradox became the favorite device in the intellectual arsenal of the Renaissance fool. Erasmus, the fool in God, and Panurge, the secular fool once he had reached the end of his journey, both understood that the highest form of serio ludere engages the player in laughing back at himself in the very act of criticizing the world. A true paradoxist unsettles those who take his meaning too seriously, as well as those who do not take it seriously enough.\n\n\"I was born on the first of April. That has its metaphysical significance,\"6 Kundera told Antonin Liehm in a February 1967 interview, thus claiming the role of philosophical fool as his birthright. By then he was already the author of two notebooks of Laughable Loves, as well as a novel, The Joke. Between the first and the last notebooks of Laughable Loves falls the shadow of public events marking the time span between 1967 and 1969 as the great matrix of meanings that cut deep into the lives of Czechs of Kundera's generation. The duplicitous year 1968 stamped European consciousness with two superimposed and contradictory images of Prague. First there was the festive show of freedom in the streets of an old Central European city, and then the resident genius of historical irony, well schooled in the art of double exposure, cut that image open to let the Russian tanks roll through those same streets in the dog days of August. For Kundera, the moment of awakening to the Russian tanks in Prague on the morning of August 21, 1968, no longer belongs to History, which commands the decreative power of time. Instead, it lives with the emotional power of memory in the anachronistic imagination he has unleashed in his novels. Here it figures as the moment when death, once again, knocks at the Czech nation's door, this time wearing the smiling mask of a naive young Russian soldier. The messenger from a civilization dominated by the vastness of its physical space beckons the Czechs to step outside their own waking time and join him in the immensity of the Russian night. After years of living in the West, Kundera would describe the experience as the violent death of the West, and of its culture based on the values of Renaissance individualism. But by then he would also understand that this moment of his consciousness was impenetrably Central European, and therefore peripheral to the Western mind. In the essay \"A Kidnapped West; or, Culture Bows Out\" (1984), Kundera asks himself why it is so easy for present-day Europe to dispense with its borderlands to the east, which have grown thinkers and artistic innovators of genius, men like Freud and Einstein, Kafka, Husserl, Bartok, and others, without whom it is impossible to conceive of twentieth-century culture. In Prague, during the tragic days of August 1968, he had assumed that culture \"existed as a realm in which supreme values were enacted. \"7 But now he sees that there is another side to the deadly conundrum in which his country is trapped. Europe itself has changed. No longer a crucible of cultural significance, Europe no longer experiences itself as a value, and thus cannot understand why a small nation at its eastern margins needs it. Kundera concludes that \"the real tragedy for Central Europe, then, is not Russia but Europe.\"8 Kundera's vision of contemporary Europe reveals a once brilliantly peopled stage growing bare. Culture is bowing out and the mass media are muscling in to occupy a privileged position at the center of modern life. These quantifiers of human experience serve as a permanently installed Chorus, endlessly purveying images and sounds that have neither depth nor true vitality. In the cultural wasteland of our actuality the mass media have constituted themselves as a formidable system of power, and like other power systems Kundera has observed, they are dedicated to the task of reducing all reality to their own level. The mode of being they propagate is characterized by the rule of minimum diversity over a maximum range. In \"The Depreciated Legacy of Cervantes,\" which serves as the lead essay in his Art of the Novel,9 Kundera pursues the question of disappearing values in the domain of his artistic predilection. In seeking to illuminate the significance of the novel to the European spirit, he reaches back to the point of origin, when the world of the \"Modern Era,\" and with it the novel, \"the image and model of that world,\" was born.10 The European adventure, as Kundera conceives it, began when Don Quixote, armed with his semantic certainties, stepped out into a world from which God was already retreating, leaving behind a vast open question. \"The key moment of European history,\"11 captured in the\n\ninimitable shorthand of this singular novelistic action, is marked by a characteristic ambiguity. It is, as Kundera says, \"decline and progress at the same time,\"12 since Don Quixote's engagement with the question of what is real leaves us with a world of expanding possibilities as well as with an inner magnitude of loss. But the seventeenth century, which saw Don Quixote as an aging man playing the role of an imagined youth, was also the age of the scientific revolution that redefined the methodology of human thought as well as its purpose. Kundera points out that Edmund Husserl, in his 1935 lectures in Prague and Vienna, traced the roots of the crisis of European spirituality to the one-sided development of the mind that began with Galileo and Descartes. The Modern Era of Europe, notes Kundera, \"like all that is human, carries the seed of its end in its beginning.\"13 By persisting in using his reason like a knife to cut open the fruit of the world, neither sensing the living ripeness nor understanding itself in the act of penetration, man has reduced himself and the world in which he lives to pure instrumentality. The example of Cervantes, on the other hand, shows that the living world of human existence can be engaged in all its quickness within the experimental realm of a novel, where concrete individuals meet at crossroads and confabulate at inns. The novel, which has accompanied European humanity on its historical journey since the beginning of the Modern Era, has provided the vital counterpoint to the relentless pursuit of objective knowledge, which carries within it the fatal seeds of a future \"forgetting of being.\"14 With every new turn of the wheel marking the progress of Time the destroyer, the novel was there to chart new territories on the imaginary map of human possibilities. Kundera sees the evolution of the genre as a paradoxical dialectic between a loss inherited and a new option created. The disappearance of God from the world raised the picaresque novel of adventure, which suggested the possibility of individual self-definition through action. After the French Revolution came Balzac, who discovered the adventure of money in the modern city. And when that option grew stale after 1848, Flaubert revealed the new infinity and beauty of the individual soul. For Kundera, the latest great age of the European novel is the period of terminal paradoxes, which he dates from the disaster of the First World War, and in which he finds himself still living. It was then that the Central European novel moved center stage, achieving the demystification of History, which had been the most potent of the several nineteenth-century illusions left at our door. Jaroslav Hasek attacked History with laughter to create the last great popular novel of Europe out of the nightmare of the Great War. His exact contemporary in Prague, the German-speaking Kafka, articulated the evil dream of modern anonymity, holding up a premonitory mirror to a future soon to be. In The Man Without Qualities, the Austrian Robert Musil showed that the dimension of the historical future, however much intellectuals may speculate about it, is like a dumb beast about to pounce and cannot be tamed by the intellect. Hermann Broch, a refugee from the second Viennese apocalypse, whose beast was Hitler, registered and analyzed the relentless process of degradation of values and its acceleration in the terminal phase of the Modern Era. And the Pole Witold Gombrowicz made us laugh at the pretensions of moderns antiqued by their cult of modernity. Kundera lists four terminal paradoxes that he has uncovered while meditating in the \"laboratory of twilight\"15 of the Central European novel, where his own brilliant experiments were conceived. The first two encapsulate a total comedown from the positions assumed by Descartes. The paradox of Man, who sets himself up as \"master and proprietor of nature,\" only to end as a \"mere thing\"16 possessed by forces of technology that surpass him and threaten to wipe out nature altogether, is intertwined with the paradox of Reason. European ratio, having run through all the old values inherited from the Middle Ages, and not having anything more to process, celebrates its total victory in the form of pure\n\nirrationality. Kundera's other two paradoxes encode the debacle of the European being-for-history as our time has experienced it. The dream of a humanity unified and at peace with itself in the comfortable house built by man-made Providence collapses in the monstrosities of two world wars initiated by Europe. The paradoxical effect of that cataclysm is a world increasingly united, offering a leveled global arena for uniform models of humanity, and leaving no space where the remaining individuals can play. Under the condition of terminal paradoxes, all existential categories undergo a fraudulent conversion that changes all values into parodies of themselves. The nature of paradox itself suffers a similar degradation in the process. What had been a play of the mind during the Renaissance, always actively generating improvised meanings, has now passed out of the domain of human freedom to become the terminal form of human entrapment. The reification of paradox is the underlying, unspoken phenomenon of this discourse.17 Kundera insists that even at the nadir of the age of terminal paradoxes, the novel retains the capability to create an experimental time and space fit for habitation by free human individuals. But it can only do so if it remains at odds with the prevailing spirit of the times. Kundera is sometimes described as a postmodernist, and it is true, of course, that he has rejected the modernism of the 1920s, with its \"glorification of the technical\" and its \"fascination with the future.\" Instead, he practices what he calls \"antimodern modernism,\"18 combining skepticism about the novelties of our actuality, which usually come down to us preprocessed by the media, with the imperative to \"make new,\" which he applies to both the form and the substance of his novels. The charge of Europocentrism that has been leveled at Kundera is potentially more misleading. The word comes to literature from the vocabulary of contemporary politics and has the undertaste of a nostalgic imperialism. The label does not fit Kundera. Apart from obscuring his genuine admiration for the American novel (both Latin and North American), it misses completely the idiosyncratic, uniquely personal significance of the category \"Europe\" in Kundera's novels and essays. While perfectly intelligible to all those who know it as a geographical and historical entity, Kundera's Europe of the Modern Era also functions as a personal metaphor for the metaphysical territory on which the house of his novels is built. And it must be emphasized that for Kundera the term \"metaphysical\" connotes a dimension of human existence that does not lie beyond the physical but vaults over it like a fragile luminous bow of many colors overarching the cascading stream of time. Perhaps the best way to understand the value Kundera attaches to his Europe-in-the-mind is to look at it as a reflection glimpsed in the crooked but premonitory mirror of Czech history. That image—of a culture drawing life from an awareness of death standing at its shoulder—is Kundera's Europe, not the new imperium of wealth the politicians promise for the 1990s. But now, let us read Kundera's novels.\n\n1 The Joke OR Uneasy Rider The Joke, Kundera's first novel, has the precise formal articulation and ironic bite of the two cycles of short stories that preceded it, the first two notebooks of Laughable Loves.1 But the imaginative scope here is much vaster, and the complex intellectual resonances sound poignantly lyrical, as seldom again after. \"Remorseful nostalgia and remorseless skepticism are the two pans of the scales that give the novel its equilibrium\"2—thus the author characterizes his book's brilliant discordance. Though modernist in technique and feeling, The Joke accommodates a larger chunk of life and more descriptive detail than the elliptical novels that would follow. Critics have called it a realistic novel3 because of the way it exemplifies the conditions of Czechoslovak society in the first two decades of the Communist regime. The unmistakable typicality of the c haracters and their situations afforded the pleasure of instant recognition to Czech and Slovak readers in 1967, when the novel first appeared in print, soon to be turned into a popular film.4 In the year of the memorable Fourth Congress of Czechoslovak Writers, even a difficult work like The Joke soon ran through three large printings. Readers tended to see Kundera's novel in light of the prevailing literary trend, which emphasized criticism of the Stalinist fifties, with their political trials and atmosphere of terror. In works of this kind, the settling of accounts with the recent past could be presented as a family drama built around a rebellious son's challenge to a rigidly authoritarian father.5 The indictment of Stalinism figures more directly in nonfiction writings, such as Ladislav Mnacko's The Taste of Power (1967), as well as in many autobiographical tales of political persecution. One of the paradoxes of this period was that the victims of Communism were often the very devotees who had helped usher it in. However, the point of view of the victim dominated the attention of the Czech public in the sixties. The Joke also takes on these themes, but after its own original fashion. The action develops around a scheme of revenge: Ludvik Jahn plots to humiliate Pavel Zemanek by sleeping with his wife, Helena, because Zemanek presided over the student tribunal that expelled him from the university and the Party in 1949. But the human sympathy belongs to Ludvik's childhood friend Jaroslav, an ardent Communist dreamer distressed by a loss of communication with his teenage son Vladimir. The questions raised by these mutually entangled fates are of a subtler order than politics, and they bounce off the historical context rather than playing into it. In the West, The joke first appeared in Paris during the autumn of 1968, under the huge shadow cast by the Soviet tanks in Prague. In his introduction to the first French edition,6 Louis Aragon, the venerable lyric voice of French Communism, declared it \"one of the greatest novels of this century.\" He also praised it as a piece of true history, preserving the authenticity of the moment of hope that was Prague in 1967—68 against the distortions of the mythogra-phers who, he suspected, would soon begin writing the winners' version of events. Fourteen years later, a Czech citizen no longer, Kundera wrote his own preface to the first integral English text of the novel,7 using the occasion to reject the bowdlerized version that had been published in England without his permission in 1969.8 He acknowledged the acuteness of Aragon's insight into the politics of historiography while deriding the poet's short-lived capacity for outrage. \"Four years later his legs consented to take him to Moscow to receive a decoration from Brezhnev. . . . And yet the\n\nvery same Ar-agon wrote what is probably the most eloquent and penetrating piece anyone has written on the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia: his foreword to The Joke\" (p. ix). Kundera, however, is extremely impatient with those who persist in treating his fiction as the captive of history. \"When in 1980, during a television panel discussion devoted to my works, someone called The Joke a major indictment of Stalinism,' I was quick to interject, 'Spare me your Stalinism, please. The Joke is a love story!' \" He goes on to explain that \"the spark that started me off on this first novel \"was an event in a small Czech town: the arrest of a girl for stealing flowers from a cemetery and offering them to her lover as a gift\" (p. vii). In the novel, the same kind of floral tribute is addressed by Lucie to the young Ludvik during his forced service in an army penal battalion. But as the narrative opens fifteen years later, Ludvik is a middle-aged cynic about to exact his revenge upon the man he holds responsible for the ordeal of that captivity. Lucie's forbidden gesture of love, the consecration of Eros by despoiling Thanatos, is about to be obliterated by Ludvik's inversion of the act of love into an expression of \"all the hatred he has accumulated during his life\" (p. viii). Kundera has observed that \"the paradoxes of history and private life have the same basic properties\" (p. viii). In The Joke, sexual love is paradoxical not only because of the ancient discord between body and soul, already recorded in the two notebooks of Laughable Loves, but also because the signs and gestures modern men and women use to express it are endowed with an untamable and often perverse ambiguity. The critic Sylvie Richterova, who interprets Kundera's first three novels as meditations on the problem of communication, notes that each verbal message and each gesture in The joke is immediately subjected to a multiplicity of interpretations. \"The novel's characters are thrashing around in a vortex where everything can be inverted,\" she writes.9 In the same vein, Kvetoslav Chvatik draws attention to the fact that Kundera's novel, published soon after Michel Foucault's Les mots et les choses (1966), also addresses the problematic relation between human experience and its expression in language.10 With its seven-part structure and four distinct narrators, three male and one female, The Joke has been compared to a musical composition based on a scheme of seven and three.11 In the first six parts, each narrative sequence is a self-contained unit controlled by a single voice. Ludvik, who initiates the series, is heard three times in this arrangement (Ludvik-Helena-Ludvik-Jaroslav-Ludvik-Kostka). But while he dominates the first two chords of the narrative scale that stops at the problematic seventh step, he shares the last part with Jaroslav and Helena as all three alternate in rapid counterpoint to tell the jarring action that unravels the plot, and with it the eighteen years of personal history evoked earlier. The time span of the novel, from about 1947 to 1965, encompasses the lead characters' passage from early youth to encroaching middle age. It also corresponds to the first two decades of Communism in Czechoslovakia. Ludvik, Helena, and Pavel, as well as Jaroslav and Kostka, all belong to the postwar generation of university students recruited by the Party to form the intellectual elite of the future. With the exception of Kostka, they all joined shortly before or after the establishment of the Communist regime. Kostka and Ludvik stumbled early in their careers, while Jaroslav and both Zemaneks prospered. But in the spring of 1965, as the five of them converge on that weekend of collisions when all illusions explode, it is difficult to tell the victims from the winners. The stage is set in the small Moravian town and adjoining village where Ludvik and Jaroslav were born. It is first described in part 1, through Ludvik's eyes, as he arrives on a Friday afternoon from Prague, intent on completing his sexual conquest of Helena. Standing in the main square (which I'd crossed countless times in my childhood, boyhood, and youth), I felt no emotion whatsoever; all I could think was that the flat space, with the spire of its town hall (like a soldier in an ancient helmet) rising above the rooftops, looked like a huge parade ground and that the\n\nmilitary past of the Moravian town, once a bastion against Magyar and Turk invaders, had engraved a set of irrevocably hideous features on its face. (p. 1) The abandoned parade ground of history, with its ugly reminders of past significance, pleases Ludvik as an appropriately ironic backdrop to his mission of revenge, which he plans to execute in the combat zone of the bedroom. Helena, his erotic target, is no more to Ludvik than a means to an end. And so also his homecoming serves as a convenient pretext for a project that he himself views as \"so cynical and base as to make a mockery of any suspicion that I had come out of any maudlin attachment to things past\" (pp. 1—2). As he goes about his methodical preparations, reconnoitering the pitifully inadequate accommodations of his shabby hotel, Ludvik is intensely conscious of the parodistic quality of all his moves and gestures. In his assault on the past, the avenger craves symmetry above all, and a precise symbolic articulation of the grand act of reversal that he hopes will take him back into wholeness. Thus, Ludvik plans to possess Helena in order to compensate himself for the humiliation of having been cast from the royal train of History into a life of triviality. By his act of sexual domination he seeks not only to subdue his enemy Zemanek but also to gain mastery once for all over the power of mockery that has devastated his life. The hotel room having convinced him of its unworthiness with its thin walls and creaking bed, Ludvik decides to borrow his friend Kostka's bachelor apartment for his appointment with Helena the next day. Dr. Kostka is a virologist at the local hospital, and Ludvik had helped him to secure the job. In his aversion for everything that reminds him of his boyhood, Ludvik avoids seeking Jaroslav's help, and when he meets his childhood companion on the street, he fails to greet him. Still another figure from the past emerges quite unexpectedly in the afternoons grayness. In a barbershop recommended by Kostka, Ludvik rediscovers his old lost love, Lucie, in the woman who is shaving his face. He has been leaning back idly against the headrest, abandoning his face to the feminine touch of the razor-wielding hands, allowing his eyes to roam the blotchy ceiling so as to avoid contact with the mirror in front of him. In the intimacy of the anonymous caress, his mind soon invents a game on the edge of eroticism: his disembodied head enjoying the unseen woman's tenderness and simultaneously registering the deadly threat implied in the blade. When he finally meets her face in the mirror, he finds that his \"tender assassin\" (p. 7) is none other than Lucie, whom he had loved passionately fifteen years before. In spite of the mask time has pressed upon the once girlish features, he knows her true face by the eyes. Then, listening to her voice in casual conversation with another customer, he is shocked by its coarseness, and she is a stranger to him once again. In this scene of imperfect remembering, the ritual of the lovers' mutual salutation by look and gentle smile is left incomplete and deeply flawed. Though he \"felt a chill run up [his] spine\" (p. 7) when he first glimpsed Lucie in the mirror, Ludvik's shudder of recognition is only a very distant recall of the love terror that seized Dante in Earthly Paradise, on the summit of Mount Purgatory, when Beatrice unveiled herself for him. Ludvik is a lover who wants \"to believe her hands, to recognize her by her hands\" (p. 8), and when Lucie fails to grant him the grace of sensual recognition, he leaves the barbershop \"oddly frustrated,\" diminished even in his capacity for knowledge. \"All I knew was that I knew nothing and that failing to recognize a face once dearly loved was a sign of great callousness\" (p. 9). Yet as he hurries back to the hotel, he deliberately refuses to acknowledge Jaroslav, his oldest friend, when he passes him on the street. This second, distinctly willful moment of non-recognition evens his score against the forces of forgetting. A casual exchange on the phone with Kostka confirms Lucie's name, but instead of answering when Kostka asks how he knows her, he comments vaguely that it was long ago. The question of Lucie is thus left hanging in the darkening air, and Ludvik sets off to wander through town.\n\nThe void created in the narrative by the suspension of knowledge about Lucie is filled by Helena, who has the voice in the second part. Her internal monologue, as she lies in her comfortable bed in Prague on the eve of her Moravian adventure with Ludvik, has the same brevity as his exposition, but not its crisp tone. Helena's sentences run on agitatedly, accreting self-pity, defensively self-righteous, as she reviews her faltering marriage to the ever popular, handsome Pavel. While his career in the Party and with women has been one charmed round of successful performances—\"he can't live without applause, it's his alcohol and nicotine\" (p. 15)—her femininity has been turning sour at the edges. She clings to the Communist doctrine Pavel \"never tired of repeating\" in the days of their courtship, when they were both students at the university in Prague in 1949, \"that the new man differed from the old insofar as he had abolished the distinction between public and private life\" (p. 14). She considers herself a new woman, body and soul, forever purposeful and optimistic, resolutely rejecting the \"fashionable skepticism\" (p. 11) that crept in around \"fifty-six when there was all that talk about Stalin's crimes, and people went wild and began rejecting everything.\" She knows that people call her \"a hard-liner, a fanatic, a dogmatist, a Party bloodhound\" (p. 15), but she remains loyal to the rhetoric of feeling and the emotional arguments Pavel has taught her. \"He was never satisfied with reaching the mind alone, he had to get at the emotions,\" in those days when she felt so young and attractive around him and life was \"like a fairy tale\" (p. 12) and they sang together in the Fucik Song and Dance Ensemble. Helena's complaining voice rises to a singing pitch when she describes the moment in Old Town Square in May 1949, on the anniversary of the liberation of Prague by the Soviet armies, that she considers the historic consecration of her love for Pavel. Standing near him in the dense crowd, she had seized his hand. As he squeezed back, their love mingled with the tidal wave of lyric solidarity that rose from so many young throats toward the rostrum, where the Italian Communist leader Togliatti stood with other dignitaries, Czech and foreign, clapping and chanting slogans. This poetic flight of memory reads like a set piece, a grotesque parody of the typical propaganda vignette. It sounds excruciatingly false. When Helena whispers into her pillow the heroic, deathdefying message the martyr Fucik left to posterity before he was hanged by the Nazis in 1943—\"May melancholy never taint my name\" (p. 11)—the words sound like a frightened prayer in the mouth of a fausse devote. When she and Pavel got engaged, he had given her \"a locket with a picture of the Kremlin on it\" (p. 14) as a talisman of their common faith. Pavel says it was a gift from a dying Soviet soldier he nursed in Prague in 1945, but Ludvik in part 5 will reflect bitterly that the symbolic memento of Pavel's Communist baptism is as phony as his Moravian folk costume, a histrionic prop used to good effect by the consummate actor of the Revolution. Pavel Zemanek, like Helena, is of bourgeois origin, but that is not what is wrong here. Helena is the perfect illustration of the easy conviviality between Czech Communism and what used to be labeled the bourgeois spirit. The Kremlin locket, the dying Soviet soldier, Fucik's testament, and Togliatti's song are authentic Communist kitsch, in the sense Kundera gives the term in the essay that forms a part of his novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being. Their function is to drape a pleasing, sentimental veil over the anguishing reality of death. Elsewhere Kundera has defined \"kitsch\" more concretely (and more cruelly, for Helena) as \"the absolute denial of shit.\"12 Helena is a blowsy, lustful beauty who lies alone in her matrimonial bed and, like Molly Bloom in Joyce's Ulysses, recalls the ecstasy of her first sexual surrender to the man who became her husband. Like Molly, she is all woman in her commitment to the bodily language of love. But when Helena says, \"It was love, love of love\" (p. 17), she is not talking of a carnal embrace but explaining why she felt compelled to denounce a colleague to the Party. Helena has been properly schooled by Pavel in the fundamental civic lesson of Communism that there is nothing private in life. \"I want it to be one from\n\nbeginning to end\" (p. 11), as she says in the self-referential style that dominates all her discourse. Confusing a colleague's marital infidelity with a breach of Party discipline, and mixing private spite with public indignation, she has denounced him to her local committee. \"The Party is almost like a living being, I can tell it all my most intimate thoughts now that I have nothing to say to Pavel\" (p. 16), she explains, invoking the emotional necessity that rules her under the accommodating cloak of official ideology. One of the characteristics of Communist consciousness is that the true believer is never alone within it. Kundera calls this the \"violation of solitude\" that occurs in the nightmarish world of pseudotheological despotism. It is a state of being he finds described in Kafka's fiction: \"The Kafkan is not restricted to either the private or the public domain; it encompasses both. The public is the mirror of the private, the private reflects the public.\"13 Helena, who takes the Party with her to bed, lives the comic side of Kafka's nightmare without knowing it. Self-delusion is the leitmotif of her life; she believes that the sadness she reads on Ludvik's face signals the beginning of his love for her and that it will be like \"seeing my youth return from the shadows\" (p. 19). Helena, brazenly claiming for herself a life free of tragedy, is a model of the historical optimism of the victorious class. She will fly to her Moravian rendezvous armed with the paraphernalia of success—the reporter's tape recorder to capture the sounds of the folk festival, the imported Italian raincoat sportily draped on her body. And she will deliver all into the trap of Ludvik's vengeful arms. When Ludvik's voice is heard again, opening the longest narrative section of the novel, he is walking outside town, through an absent landscape where fields stretch out behind deserted houses, factories, courtyards, and heaps of rubbish. The desolation around him has the color of the memories Lucie has stirred in him. He reflects on the curious inter-changeability of life's phenomena as he suddenly sees in his hometown a mirror of Ostrava, the mining center of Moravian Silesia where he met Lucie. The drama of his thwarted life, now reemerging from his memory, really began with the debacle in Prague —a consequence of his \"fatal predilection for silly jokes\" (p. 22). Ludvik relates his disasters in a quiet, even tone devoid of self-pity. The experiencing self in his autobiographical narrative is disciplined by an overarching intelligence that keeps directing the storytelling toward the pole of analysis. The result is a brilliant piece of sustained philosophical prose that succeeds in transforming personal remembrance into an essay on the phenomenology of the age. The loss of the distinction between private and public—a convenience for Helena, allowing her to masquerade her most selfish impulses under a grand banner—was a stumbling block in Ludvik's path. His fall from the Party's grace took the form of an essentially comic quid pro quo between love and politics. Ludvik was one of the first in his generation to join the Revolution, welcoming the new age even before the Communists seized full power in February 1948. As Jaroslav remembers him after his first year in Prague, \"He had the look all Communists had at the time. He looked as if he'd made a secret pact with the future and thereby acquired the right to act in its name\" (p. 120). Because of the seductive arguments Ludvik uses to convert the boys back home to Communism in that first summer of 1948, Jaroslav nicknames him the Pied Piper. But the next summer Ludvik's other side, that of a twenty-year-old boy entangled in the contradiction between his sexual aggressiveness and his inexperience, rears up in pain. He has been courting Marketa inconclusively for several months. She, an infinitely gullible, pretty girl, has been sending him impersonal letters from her summer training camp, full of the grave enthusiasm the age demands, and woefully lacking even a hint at flirtation. Smarting from the humiliation he feels at her indifference to\n\nhis passion, Ludvik fires off a postcard inscribed, \"Optimism is the opium of the people! A healthy atmosphere stinks of stupidity! Long live Trotsky! Ludvik!\" (p. 26). The three exclamation marks in this provocative message are the clues that betray the hurt and rage of the rebuffed lover, concealed under a wise-guy posture. This coded communication is Ludvik's ultimate salvo in a losing game of seduction, a parting shot fired in the air for revenge. It contains all the agonistic bravado of male adolescence, with its cruel vulnerability and its profoundly ambiguous attitude toward the girl addressee. Despite its overt allusion to politics, it is most emphatically not a political statement. Marketa, who takes everything literally, and whose mind, like the society it reflects so perfectly, is entirely humorless, cannot understand Ludvik's verbal game. She considers the card subversive and surrenders it to the camp authorities, who question her about her correspondence. \"They knew all about it before talking to you\" (p. 34), Ludvik consoles her when they talk again in the fall. Marketa, for her part, wishes him no harm. Inspired by the example of a heroic wife in a then popular Soviet film, Court of Honor, and strengthened in her resolve by a conversation with Comrade Zemanek, she offers to stand by Ludvik providing he admits his guilt to the Party. Ludvik knows that everything is possible for him, including the conquest of Marketa at last, if only he will play this deadly serious game of political salvation. Yet he says no to her, accepting his loss in love and the peril of a head-on confrontation with Zemanek. Sylvie Richterova has pointed out that Ludvik's fall into disgrace, like most of the crucial events in Kundera's first three novels, begins with a single verbal act. She argues that the postcard, once launched, assumes an autonomous existence quite beyond Ludvik's will.14 That perceptive observation requires some amplification, for the paradigm does not quite fit Ludvik's case. After all, he has the option of taking back his unfortunate joke if he will only allow the Party agelastes15 to reinterpret what he has written in accordance with their pseudotheology, which reduces all texts to the single measure of the Party's authorized speech. The joke, penned by Ludvik in a moment of emotional confusion, has unexpectedly presented him with a clear moral choice. If we momentarily forget the absurdist interpretation that Ludvik's own analysis of his fate presses on us, the situation he confronts when he appears before Zemanek's committee is the archetypal dilemma of a man who must either opt for a convenient lie or suffer the unpleasant consequences of telling the truth as he sees it. In his address to the Fourth Congress of Czechoslovak Writers, two years after The Joke was written, the philosopher Karel Kosik read from a letter that Jan Hus, \"the great Czech intellectual of the fifteenth century,\" wrote from prison on June 18, 1415, describing what happened to him at the Council of Constance. One theologian told me: that everything will be allowed and made possible for me, providing I submit to the council, adding: should the council proclaim that you have only one eye, even though you have two, it would be your duty to profess, together with the council, that it is indeed so. I answered him: even if the whole world affirmed this to me, I, possessed of the reason which I now have, could not admit it without resistance of my conscience.16 In his commentary on this text, Kosik compared Hus's stand against arbitrary authority with the options of a contemporary intellectual in a similar quandary. Unlike the fifteenth-century religious humanist, Kosik argued, the present-day thinker could not rely on his individual reason and his conscience because the two did not necessarily work together in his world. Yet, Kosik stressed, \"only in that unity do they (reason and conscience) become the foundation of human existence.\" He concluded that the modern mind, which views reason and conscience as two independent, mutually indifferent, or even\n\nhostile entities, stands groundless before the problem of truth. Ludvik not only suffers from such a split between reason and conscience, he no longer even claims his conscience as his own. His conscience belongs to History, which is a creature of the Party that purports to be History's servant. When the accusation of subversion is leveled against Ludvik, he feels guilty even though his reason objects to the analysis behind the charge. Because I (like the rest of us) stood before the Revolution and its Party with permanently bowed head, I gradually became reconciled to the idea that my words, though genuinely intended as a joke, were still a transgression of sorts, and torrents of tortured self-criticism started whirling through my head. (p. 37) Ludvik's reason plays the knave to his captive conscience and begins spinning out the sophistic argument that ultimately reconciles his residual sense of the truth with his overwhelming need to feel guilty. \"Looking back on my state of mind at the time,\" Ludvik the narrator reflects after many years that it was similar to the Christian conscience with its \"fundamental and never-ending guilt\" (p. 37). But more accurately, Ludvik before the session of the Party division committee is like K. in The Trial, a defendant still searching for his guilt. Kundera has described this \"Kafkan,\" ' pseudotheological\" consciousness as a creation of modern totalitarian society, where power \"behaves like God\" and \"awakens religious feelings toward itself.\"17 Why, then, does Ludvik say no to Marketa and Zemanek's persuasion? For all Ludvik's introspection, the question is left hanging, just as in the more frivolous version of the truth-teller in spite of himself, \"Nobody Will Laugh\" (Laughable Loves), which tells the story of an art historian who refuses to write a dishonest review. Conscience is the unacknowledged ghost in the machine of Kundera's absurd world, situated beyond the limits of inquiry in the consciousness of his characters and narrators. As Ludvik tells it, Zemanek's performance as inquisitor was so spellbinding as to bring everyone at the session, including Ludvik's friends and teachers, to vote for his expulsion. The actual description of the trial is strategically postponed until part 5, where it surges from Ludvik's vengeful memory in sharply etched detail, to provide a delicious incitement for the equally virtuoso scene he is about to play opposite Helena in bed. Zemanek, a past master of the emotional argument, had read Ludvik's facetious postcard to the investigating committee right after his own pathos-laden recitation from Julius Fucik's Notes from the Gallows. \"That text, written clandestinely in prison, then published after the war in a million copies, broadcast over the radio, studied in schools as required reading, was the scripture of the age\" (p. 166). By contrast, the text of Ludvik s postcard, as Kvetoslav Chvatik has pointed out, is virtually meaningless outside the existential situation that generated it.18 Zemanek forces it into the extraneous context of Fucik's testament, and by that semiotic manipulation, he manages to transform a frivolous quip into blasphemy, the most extreme form of unauthorized speech. While Ludvik is thus shamed by his own words, Fucik's \"fervent, yet pure\" face looks down at him from the poetic portrait in profile done by the painter Svabinsky on the basis of an old photograph —a lyric icon that soon obliterates the memory of the real man's more prosaic look. Under that silently eloquent gaze, Ludvik feels crushed by a sense of his own aesthetic unworthiness. But when one of Zemanek's acolytes, \"the girl with the pigtail,\" pipes up to deliver the rhetorical kill—\"Tell me, how do you think the Comrades tortured by the Gestapo, tortured to death, would have reacted to your words?\" (p. 167)—he suddenly remembers his own father, who did not return from a Nazi camp. He answers, \"If they had read my postcard, they might well have laughed\" (p. 168). In a flash of ironic insight Ludvik sees the incongruity between the real tragedy of death in a concentration camp and the theatrical performance into which he has been drawn. That moment of truth legitimizes laughter for him, but it also isolates him from \"the Comrades.\" He will be condemned under the category of\n\ntreasonous skepticism. Ludvik's stand does not originate in the deliberations of either his reason or his conscience. Rather, it is the spontaneous eruption of an irrepressible comic instinct. It is also an act of courage that momentarily restores the integrity of the word. Yet Ludvik cannot quite believe in the value of his gesture and finds himself in the absurd situation of a martyr of comic courage who persists in looking at himself with the humorless eyes of his executioners. He is a victim rather than a master of his laughter, a man \"caught in the trap of a joke\" and \"condemned to triviality\" as Kundera puts it (p. vii). Seen from outside, his personal catastrophe is ludicrous, lacking any moral or aesthetic dignity. In his disgrace, Ludvik selfconsciously abandons the stage of history for the humbler pursuit of love in what he calls the \"everyday world\" (p. 77). In the penal battalion to which he is assigned to work in the coal mines near Ostrava, he temporarily recovers a lost feeling of solidarity with members of his own generation. This time he and his fellows are on the receiving end of history. His companions, who all wear the black insignia of political prisoners, have been condemned for a variety of offenses, most of them as trivial as his own. The list, which Richterova calls \"surrealistic,\"19 ranges from striking a policeman to pissing on a curb while drunk during a May Day demonstration. The politicals are united by their propensity to look at the world from below and their capacity for mockery, the vitriolic power of the powerless. The masterpiece of their collective parodistic spirit is the game they improvise to subvert an athletic competition organized as part of a punishment decreed by their fanatical \"boy commander,\" a potential Saint-Just who illustrates Ludvik's observation that \"youth is a terrible thing\" (p. 76), particularly when it inherits history for its playground. The type will reappear in the person of the poet Jaromil in Kundera's next novel, Life Is Elsewhere. Both adolescents are monsters of inexperience who rampage through life draped in the purple cloak of the tragic stage, mistaking words for feelings and symbols for things. The inspired clowning of the inmates, temporarily transformed into athletes, disrupts the command performance. By limping, puffing, and stumbling along the racecourse, the runners exaggerate the zeal of extreme athletic effort, simultaneously miming their own hobbled condition as prisoners. Only one competitor among them runs in earnest: Alexej, the son of a highly placed Communist official recently condemned as a Western spy. His inherited guilt, like his Russian-sounding name, sits heavily on his narrow shoulders. He is a character out of Koestler's Darkness at Noon, lost in a Central European underworld of Schweiks. Alexej runs in earnest, but his inadequate body, sweating authentic pain, cannot outdistance the clowns. Ironically, he is the one the boy commander singles out for punishment as a saboteur. Irony, in the world of The Joke, is the great equalizer whose tentacular web no one can escape. As Richterova has observed, there is a sense that the characters in this novel and the situations they endure are essentially interchangeable.20 Alexej and the boy commander, who drives him to suicide by an overdose of barbiturates, are really spiritual twins, absurdly separated by an arbitrary barbed-wire fence. Later, contemplating Alexej's rigid body, which looks frail in death, like that of a child, Ludvik is moved to violent pity by the fate of this boy whose virulent faith in the system made him a misfit among his fellow prisoners. \"He was trying to tell me that the moment the Party banishes a man from its ranks, that man has no reason to live.\" Ludvik can no longer share Alexej s conviction, yet his death draws Ludvik back to his old guilt and his nostalgia for the lost paradise of Communism. As a result, he loses his newfound sense of community, reflecting bitterly that \"the collective of the black insignia was as capable of bullying a man (making him an outcast, hounding him to death) as the collective in that lecture hall, as any collective\" (p. 102). This new dispossession coincides with the moment when Ludvik discovers that he has lost Lucie, the girl in whose love he had sought compensation for his \"exit from history.\" Lucie figures in his career as\n\na second prize, a consolation for an ambitious youth who has lost the higher privilege of \"standing near the wheel of history\" (p. 61). When he first sees her in front of a cinema in suburban Ostrava, her solitary, strangely idle figure affects him with the force of overpowering revelation. \"Lucie had revealed herself to me the way religious truth reveals itself to others\" (p. 57). But their love, though it begins with a vision, is instantly marred by the manipulations of his intellect. Ludvik argues to himself that this \"pitiful girl,\" whose presence seems to hold the mystery of ordinariness, is \"eminently worthy of love\" as a figure standing on \"the meadow of day-to-day existence,\" a creature living far from history, \"beneath it,\" who can open to him the lyric realm of a long-lost pastoral (p. 61). Ludvik's imagination casts a myth of love over Lucie, like a net or a veil, a myth he has fashioned by turning the fabric of his humiliation inside out. Even before Lucie becomes an erotic object for his inflamed senses, she is the plaything of his imagination in its frustrated longing for aesthetic dignity. The high romance of Lucie is preceded by the episode of the blonde on a tractor, a shabby sexual encounter that inspires in Ludvik a cruel recoil from the realities of his life. During an evening furlough in town, Ludvik and his friends manage to persuade a prostitute to abandon the legitimate soldiers monopolizing her attention in a cheap bar and join their gang instead. They go to a back alley, where they take turns making love to her while she is enthroned on the seat of \"a tractor-like contraption\" (p. 51). When his moment comes, Ludvik's body performs adequately, releasing him from his \"raging lust for a woman; any woman\" (p. 52), while his mind scrambles desperately for some illusion of personal uniqueness. Once the alcoholic glamor is stripped from the event, it shows itself in all the bleakness of a serialized mechanical transaction. Ludvik feels his soul contracting in the aftermath of this collective cockcrow, even as he recognizes the experience as \"the norm of my existence\" (p. 53). In the early, disembodied phase of their love, Lucie's gentle responsiveness is profoundly healing for Ludvik. It restores in him a lost spontaneity of feeling, and in the haze of his tenderness, her body, as yet untouched by his vociferous desire, has a brief moment of transparency that allows their souls a silent communion—\"More than beauty more than anything / A festival of understanding\" (p. 64). Ludvik reads Lucie these words from a poem by Frantisek Halas21 in a voice without false pathos or emphasis, as if this poetry were the natural language of their days together. But the disarmed state of their love is soon disrupted by \"the revelation of her body\" (p. 70), which Ludvik experiences as he watches her try on an elegant new dress he is buying for her. That black evening gown, concealing and revealing her form, becomes the metonym of the new sexual identity she has acquired with it. She puts it on to receive him alone in her dormitory room. All the props of the ritual of sexual consummation are in place for the occasion, but the ceremony is interrupted by Lucie's sudden and unexpected physical resistance. Ludvik interprets her fierce struggle as an excessive defense of her virginity. She leaves him with that illusion intact, merely promising to surrender the next time. In a novel full of the clamor of voices about her, Lucie's own voice is never raised in explanation of her baffling conduct. For Ludvik, the period that follows the first scene of Lucie's denial is the most romantic phase of his love. With the intensity of a Fabrizio del Dongo in his high tower, keeping passionate watch over Clelia in Stendhal's Charterhouse of Parma, Ludvik lives for Lucie's brief visits at the camp fence. Instead of writing to him, Lucie comes, bringing bunches of flowers. At first Ludvik is embarrassed by what he sees as a reversal of the male/female roles in courtship, but gradually he accepts her offerings as \"a form of speech\" quite unlike \"the heavy-handed imagery of conventional flower symbolism,\" intuiting \"an older, vaguer, more instinctive precursor of language\" in her gesture (p. 68). Like Stendhal's hero, Ludvik is a lover contemplating the object of his desire through the barrier of a prison. But his imagination, unlike Fabrizio's, is also a captive of the barbed wire behind which this age of anonymity\n\nherds its rebels, inventing other, obfuscating names for the flat, arbitrary places thus circumscribed. His is not the age of exalted individualism. So when Lucie came up to the fence, I wasn't the only one looking at her; I was joined by ten or so of my fellow soldiers, who knew precisely what she was like when she made love (what she said, how she moaned) and who would make all kinds of innuendos about the black heels she had on again, and picture her parading naked in them around her tiny room. (p. 92) That image of a provocative and compliant Lucie, which Ludvik offers as the price of his admission to the collective of the black insignia, is a sham, but it is sufficient to relieve the men's sexual hunger. For Ludvik's part, his willingness to share his most intimate moments is the impulse of a dubious charity, carrying the trademark of the age that has abolished privacy. The essence of romantic love, as Fabrizio or Henry Brulard understood it, and as Ludvik himself briefly sensed it when he read Halas to Lucie, rises from the sexual act elevated above the body's cockcrow. It exists only within the pathos, which is a blessing, of agonistic individuation. For all his suffering, Ludvik's norm as lover remains that of a gang rapist, however much he tries to escape from the surrounding world of triviality where values have lost their arche.22 Pursuing his own parody of romance, Ludvik resolves to brave the danger of crossing the barrier that separates him from Lucie. Disguised in a borrowed suit, he makes his way past the guards to a bare room in a house outside the camp, where Lucie is waiting for him. The much-desired scene of intimacy that follows unravels all his hopes by cruelly inverting the symbols of sexual domination he had conjured up during his long anticipation. I realized that everything had turned out the opposite of what I'd dreamed: instead of a naked girl serving wine to a fully dressed man, a naked man was lying in the lap of a fully dressed woman. I saw myself as the naked Christ taken down from the cross and placed in the arms of a grieving Mary, and I was horrified, because I hadn't come to Lucie for compassion and consolation, I'd come for something entirely different. (pp. 97-98) Like all of Kundera's young men, Ludvik abhors any suggestion of the maternal in the woman he desires, as if it contained the negation of his manhood. Lucie's compassionate lap forces him \"to eat the humble pie of [his] immaturity.\" In a rage of humiliation, he starts tearing off her clothes, unconsciously debasing the ceremony of erotic disrobement into the brutal impersonality of a rape. \"Possessed by the same blind force\" (p. 98) that tragically divides them, Ludvik and Lucie struggle until their love duel climaxes with his slap across her face. By now he has lost all sense of her individuality, just like the boyfriend in the story \"The Hitchhiking Game\" (Laughable Loves), who experiences the same loss at the height of sexual mastery. Lucie flees from Ludvik, leaving him to face alone the additional ordeal of Alexej's suicide. In the cynical hangover from those two events, his mind takes bitter satisfaction in noting, without self-pity but also without forgiveness, that \"I was more the object than the subject of my story\" (p. 104). This awareness of his own indignity, an incurable falling-short of the tragic norm his imagination craves, has followed Ludvik from the playground of history into the world of the tarnished pastoral. But in this polyphonic novel, no statement is allowed to stand without being confronted with the possibility of its opposite. In part 4, Jaroslav sketches a retrospect of Ludvik's life that might very well fit the tragic mold. We learn that Ludvik is the son of a village bricklayer who died in a Nazi camp and that he had to endure the ostentatious charity of his rich relatives, the Kouteckys. As Jaroslav sees it, that boyhood humiliation is the key to Ludvik's ardent Communism, a commitment Ludvik himself prefers to discuss in more philosophical terms. Jaroslav's own life is bound together by a deep loyalty to his roots, and he naturally interprets Ludvik's enforced absence from his mother's funeral, which\n\ntook place while he was in jail for desertion, as an event of prime significance. The Kouteckys, left to dispose of the dead woman's body as they pleased, ensconced it in a monument of marble \"guarded by a white angel with curly hair and a sprig of flowers.\" For Jaroslav, that angel is the emblem of petty bourgeois kitsch, for which he and Ludvik hold a shared aversion. \"I'll never forget that angel, soaring above the ravaged life of a friend whose parents' corpses had been snatched from him along with everything else. It was an angel of devastation \" (p. 132). Impervious to the historical irony lurking in that statement, Jaroslav, who is still a sincere Communist, lumps together under the hated aegis of the Kouteckys both the Nazi occupation and the more recent depredation of which Ludvik is a victim. Jaroslav's voice shifts the narrative from bitter irony to a warm tone of a deeply felt nostalgia. He is a six-foot-two giant constitutionally unable to resist anyone he perceives to be weaker than himself. In his mouth, the adjective \"poor\" is more a term of endearment than a label of class warfare. His is the Communism of the heart, open to all generous illusions. Like his schoolteacher father, who was also Ludvik's mentor, Jaroslav is deeply attached to the folklore of his native Moravia. Ludvik, the Pied Piper of Revolution, had persuaded him that Communism, in abolishing private property, would by the same stroke reawaken the \"languorous Sleeping Beauty of the past\" (p. 121) in popular music and ritual, and so he had joined the Party while studying at the university in Brno. In the fall of 1949, Jaroslav had returned home to be near his father, who was in frail health after a stroke. This sacrifice of a university career unexpectedly leads to undreamt-of success on the home ground of his village. Under the watchful eyes of the Party, the cimbalom ensemble he organizes to play songs ancient and new soon catapults him to national fame. His group's repertoire includes hymns to Stalin and songs about the collectivization of agriculture, as well as lyrics about love and death. As Jaroslav's voice surfaces in the novel, he is on the verge of seeing an old dream fulfilled. It is a Friday night in June 1965, and that Sunday his son Vladimir is to play the role of king in a folk ritual known as the Ride of the Kings, which his native village has celebrated from time immemorial. The exact origin and meaning of this seasonal rite is veiled in obscurity, a subject of learned dispute among ethnographers. But for Jaroslav, it speaks with the intensity of a cherished personal memory, consecrating his filial bond to his dead father. In 1944, when the Ride took on secret meaning as a national demonstration against the Nazi occupation, the villagers had selected him to play the lead role, seeking thus to honor the spirit of his patriotic father. In the coded language of the ceremony, which the Germans did not trouble to decipher, the village was acting out its \"pilgrimage to our sources\" (p. 111), articulating the great lesson of survival through remembrance, a lesson the nation had retrieved from its long history of dispossession. The figure of the beggar-king riding with his retinue through the village, silent and veiled, while his heralds ask the people for alms, was intuitively perceived as a symbol of the humiliated majesty that belonged to a threatened Czech culture communicating in a language always on the verge of extinction but so dearly loved that nothing could erase it from memory. When we first hear Jaroslav's voice, he is shown as a lonely figure in the Moravian landscape, lying on a grassy verge among small fields. To the alert Czech reader of 1967, this tiny descriptive detail would immediately have brought home the anachronistic character of the setting. These grassy verges (meze), which marked the borders of individually owned farming plots, had been forcibly ploughed over in the collectivization process of the early 1950s. In 1965, when Jaroslav is lying there, such meze had long disappeared from the Moravian landscape, if not from Jaroslav's personal memory. His questions at the outset—\"Do these lands I cross belong to another age? What lands are they?\" (p. 105)—signal the mind's flight from historical actuality that informs his entire reverie. Jaroslav is trying to escape the oppression of present success and the anxiety about his son by turning to the dream world of the old myth that is the matrix of all his reverence. Private tenderness and public passion merge harmoniously\n\nwithin his meditation, making music together, not ideology. \"I believe things have a meaning, Vladimir,\" he tells his son in an imaginary colloquy. \"I want to hand my kingdom over to you. And I want you to accept it from me\" (p. 112). Jaroslav knows that his son is reluctant to play the king; moreover, he is not sure about his wife's attitude. In his dream vision, as he relives his wedding to Vlasta, the images of the Moravian nuptial feast keep flowing into scenes from the Ride, now strangely transformed into a drama of defeat and desertion. The central characters of both pageants, the bride and the beggar-king, are concealed figures, and the effectiveness of the event hinges on their quasimagical power to compel recognition. Jaroslav the bridegroom, guided by the patriarch as the ritual demands, reads the signs flawlessly, rejecting the sham bride first offered under the mask of a kerchief in a playful mimicry of courtship. He still knows his Vlasta in her poetic essence, as \"a poor man's daughter\" (p. 107), whoever her father might be, because he looks at life with the second sight of a voyant who sees by not seeing as other people do. \"Vlasta calls me a dreamer. She says I don't see things as they are. Well, she's wrong. I do see things as they are, but in addition to the visible I see the invisible\" (p. 124). For Jaroslav, folk song and folk ritual are the arche of experience. He calls them \"a tunnel beneath history\" (p. 116), because through them his imagination enters the lives and emotions of men and women long dead, whose names do not figure in official history's record of battles and political deals, with their dubious gains and losses. Jaroslav believes that unlike modern man, who \"cheats,\" his ancestors, for all their passionate hereditary attachment to growing things, had the ability to come to terms with death as \"the fact of no return.\" When he experiences folk ritual, it is a homecoming into the real life modern man has lost, a sinking down as peaceful as when a child goes to sleep. \"I felt the inexorable order of it all,\" he says (p. 129), reflecting on his wedding feast. \"Then Vlasta and I climbed into the bed piled high with quilts, and it was as though all mankind in its never-ending wisdom had taken us into its gentle arms\" (p. 130). Part 5, where Ludvik's voice returns for the third time, functions somewhat deceptively, like the dominant step in a major scale, as if to conclude the assertive chord of the theme of revenge announced by the tonic. While the avenger deliberately fuses his description of the bedroom scene with Helena and his memory of Zemanek's triumph at the trial, another echo is overheard by the attentive reader. The Pieta scene with Lucie reverberates through the sadism of Ludvik's lovemaking with Helena, an unwanted replay that is all the more disturbing because it seems to creep in on the telling in spite of the narrator's intellectual control. Underlining the Lucie connection, part 5 is framed by Ludvik's reflections on the paradoxical nature of sexual love. These thoughts, whose philosophical pessimism recalls the observations of Schopenhauer or the maxims of Georges Bataille, dwell on the essential loneliness of the lover, which persists into the most intimate fulfillment of his body's desire. In Ludvik's formulation of the problem, the agonistic self-enclosure of the lover is doubled by the egotism of the poet-actor who teams up with him for the duration of the erotic game, thus converting his experiencing self into an aesthetic object of his own making that rivals the beloved for passionate attention. Lucie's reappearance in the barbershop seems to have given a rough jolt to the poetic text of Ludvik's life, where she has figured as \"a kind of legend or myth, inscribed on parchment and laid in a metal casket at the very foundation of my life\" (p. 140). Unlike the Byronic lover whose predatory imagination he shares, Ludvik feels himself void of the charisma to generate from within an aesthetically compelling myth of his self. He needs Lucie as a talisman against his loss of individuation. As he walks through town on Saturday morning, killing time before Helena's arrival, he notices a Baroque monument to victims of plague, which stands as a reminder of the town's once fervently Catholic past. There was a saint on the pedestal, a cloud on the saint, an angel on the cloud, and on that angel's cloud\n\nanother angel, the last. I took a long look at the poignant pyramid of saints, clouds, and angels masquerading in stone as heaven, then at the real heaven—a pale (morning) blue hopelessly removed from that dusty stretch of earth. (p. 142) In this description of the statuary grouping, Ludvik's not so innocent eye opens the way for the mind's demystification. By reading the monument upside down and by insisting on the pull of gravity that binds all the figures to earth, he has transformed the angels and the clouds and the saints into mere pedestals to support the vain illusion of soaring weightlessness, which no longer holds. Contemplating this monument to an ancient faith that has lost all power to compel belief, Ludvik experiences a feeling of very personal loss. It has become too easy to deconstruct all systems of meaning, and the price to be paid for such sophistication is a perception of reality deprived of any sense of authenticity. This acedia, as the medieval monks might have called it, turns the world around Ludvik into a sham, always a parody of something else, like the grotesque ceremony of the \"welcoming of new citizens to life\" (p. 148), a travesty of Christian baptism that he witnesses soon after passing the monument. Ludvik the narrator chooses to depict this rite of civic initiation by means of the device of ostranenie (estrangement), made famous by Tolstoy's description of an opera performance through the eyes of a countrified Natasha in book 8 of War and Peace. Kundera wields the same device in the intellectual manner of an eighteenth-century philosophe. Young Pioneers march with military precision to form a guard of Communist angels around the newborns while the mothers look on in embarrassment, uncertain about what to do with the precious bundles that are now being claimed by the State. Several pages later, after Ludvik has picked Helena up at the bus station, the motif of the monument returns: it \"jutted up above the square like a piece of broken-off sky that couldn't find its way back\" (p. 155). This time Ludvik's commentary characterizes it as an emblem of the age he lives in, with its relentlessly downward pull of inherent baseness. The availability of Helena's body at his side fills him with bitter recognition of his own lack of nobility, so he complicates his game by teasing her mind a bit, since that mind also belongs to Zemanek. When they pass the monument again, after having a drink, he points to the statuary, and Helena, conforming to his expectations, delivers herself of a small pearl of Communist kitsch. \"Why do they keep them anyway, those holy statues? Why don't they build something to celebrate life instead of all that mysticism?\" (p. 159) she pipes in a perfect falsetto that recalls the naive enthusiasm of Marketa. Having executed \"without a hitch\" (p. 154) the intellectual foreplay to this pathetically unequal sexual duel, Ludvik feels himself master of irony at last. In Dr. Kostka's borrowed apartment, just before the kill, as he places his hands on Helena's legs—\"the very legs whose opening and closing have provided the rhythm, the pulsations for a decade of Zemanek's life\" (pp. 168—69)—his intellect is firmly focused on his target. But Helena as erotic victim, a nothing in herself, is also a stand-in for Lucie's body, whose pulsations he could never master. And in the sadistic ribaldry of possessing Helena, whom he orders to undress for him while denying her the intimacy of a kiss, he also debases Lucie's image. The middle-aged seducer executes his scenario of sexual subjugation with routine skill, but in the process he senses his mind wandering. \"I was to be a man guarding his fugitive prey with total vigilance,\" he muses, leaving unsaid the fact that the fugitive prey in contention is Lucie, not the everwilling Helena. His abstracted mind proceeds to develop its conceit about love while Helena beckons him with shameless abandon. \"Physical love only rarely merges with spiritual love,\" the narrator cuts into the action. What does the spirit actually do when the body unites (in its age-old, universal, immutable motion) with another body? Think of the wonderful ideas it comes up with during those times, proving as they inevitably do its superiority over the never-ending monotony of the life of the body! Think of the scorn\n\nit has for the body. ... Or conversely: think of the joy it takes in disparaging the body by leaving it to its push-pull game and giving free rein to its own wide-ranging thoughts. (p. 170) In the Czech original of the text, Ludvik uses the feminine noun duse (soul)23 instead of \"spirit.\" It is a word Kundera always uses to denote the spiritual aspect of love, which he so often pits against the opposing concept of the body, in a perennial discord his lovers cannot resolve. Michael Heim's translation, the only one that sounds natural in English, does not alter the substance of Ludvik's statement, but it carries a faint allusion to Shakespeare's \"The expense of spirit in a waste of shame / Is lust in action\" (Sonnet 129), which has the effect of tempering the mind's arrogance crowing from Ludvik's aside. For the spirit (or the soul) is held in the same scorn as the poor body in a scene of cruel lovemaking under the watchful gaze of a sadistic intellect that enjoys the comic quid pro quo inflicted on Helena, a foolish woman who mistakes brutality for passion and a slap in the face for a lover's extreme caress. When he finally confronts his own face in the mirror as he washes up, Ludvik bursts into a peal of laughter and takes this reaction as a token of his victory. For her part, Helena is exultant in her pleasure, boasting of the infallible instinct of her body, which, she says, has recognized in him from the start \"a mysterious elan vital, . . . the joy of youth eternal\" (p. 175). In her new effusiveness, she confesses the secret of her collapsing marriage, a revelation that \"made [his] flesh creep\" (p. 176). His scheme of revenge is suddenly devalued into a joke at his own expense, and Helena's body looms before him as the ugly reality of a virulently comic contrappasso. When she finally leaves him alone with himself, he seeks to escape into the thought of Lucie, the incorporeal one, his \"goddess of vain pursuit\" (p. 178). Momentarily, his own longing for abstract purity masks the guilt he feels for the violation he has just inflicted on Lucie's image. The penultimate narrative section introduces an \"outside person\" whose function is to open \"a secret window through the novel's wall.\"24 In the solitude of his apartment, which has now recovered its ascetic character, Dr. Kostka reviews the themes of his conversation with Ludvik, who has asked him about Lucie. The meditations of this medical scientist, who reads Jan Hus, Luther, and Pascal, have the probing introspective quality of a rigorous examination of conscience. In Kostka's exposition of events and characters, the narrative matter is subject to the imperative of self-judgment, in the confessional mode as interpreted by a Christian. His ultimate interlocutor, even when he appears to address Ludvik or Lucie, is the unseen God, as in Augustine's Confessions. Kostka is an anguished evangelical Christian who dreams of realizing the promise of brotherly love contained in the Gospels. It was this hope for humankind, for this world but not of it, that determined his relation to Communism. At the university in 1947, before the Party seized absolute control, he had sided with the Communists in all the debates, thus scandalizing his fellow Christians. Soon after the February coup, he fell under suspicion as an internal dissenter who moreover \"took the side of several students due to be expelled for the political stance of their parents\" (p. 181). At a Party hearing, a student named Ludvik Jahn stood up for him, arguing that the Party owed him respect for his support before the coup and that his Christianity was no doubt a mere phase. The friendship between the two men dates from this gesture by Ludvik and the private exchange of views that followed, in which Kostka felt bound to declare that he did not expect to outgrow his faith in God and Ludvik responded that religious faith was \"of no concern to anyone but the individual\" (p. 182). That first meeting set the tone for their continuing friendship, which is characterized by what Kostka terms \"external sympathies\" and \"internal conflicts\" (p. 179). Each time they talk, they return to their fundamental disagreement about the origins and meaning of Communism. While Ludvik sees socialism as the culmination of the secular, antireligious spirit of European skepticism, stemming from\n\nRenaissance rationalism, Kostka argues that socialism is religious in its essence, a significant but passing phase in the long history of humanity's quest for the kingdom of God on this earth.25 For Kostka, the atheism professed by the Communists dooms them to transience. But he assigns a religious meaning even to their apostasy, interpreting it as still another chapter in mankind's unending dialogue with God, \"a sign that mortals cannot sit on His throne with impunity and that without His participation even the most equitable order of worldly affairs is doomed to failure and corruption\" (p. 181). In Kostka's world, everything, including absence and failure, has a meaning that hinges on its relation to the absolute good of human redemption. It is from this perspective that he views his own relationship with Lucie, whom he met in the fall of 1951, after she fled from Ludvik to the Cheb region of western Bohemia, where she was born. Kostka was then working as a technical adviser at a collective farm, having resigned his position at Prague University. Lucie first crops up in Kostka's pastoral as a mysterious runaway who hides in the hills, begging bread and milk from the shepherds. She is like Dorotea in Don Quixote, a girl fleeing love's madness in disguise, or, closer to home, like Viktorka in Bozena Nemcova's much-loved nineteenth-century novel Babicka (The Grandmother), half woman and half vila (a spirit of the woods), who lives on the extreme margins of the domesticated lands of a Czech village. Even before meeting the girl, Kostka is deeply moved by her power to evoke the protective instinct of the local people, especially the children, who call her the \"wandering fairy\" (p. 186). This sentimental idyll of spontaneous Christian feeling is soon interrupted when the police find Lucie and identify her as a girl with a morals charge and a theft on her record. She is nevertheless given a job at the state farm, where Kostka, who sees her as a symbol of an age of defilement, takes her on as his assistant and becomes her protector. Throughout the winter, Kostka the healer nurtures Lucie's trust with infinite patience and gentleness, until she tells him about the two mysteries of her past, each of them linked to a social transgression. At sixteen, she had been the only girl in a gang of six young hoodlums, who subjected her to a collective rape as a ritual of initiation. The boys were arrested for stealing, and she spent a year in the reformatory for having given them \"everything a young girl could give\" (p. 197). From there she went to faraway Ostrava, where she was a model worker until she was again arrested, this time for taking flowers from a cemetery. As Kostka contemplates Lucie's fate, with its perpetual running away—from Cheb to Ostrava and back again, from a loveless home into the brutal embrace of the gang, from there into the rough arms of an \"insistent soldier\" (p. 198), and finally into his own soothing presence—it assumes the keenness of an instinctive, not fully understood quest for the sacred meaning of life. Lucie is for him the child-victim of the age of religious emptiness. Under his prompting, the gang rape and the struggle with Ludvik emerge as a confession of two experiences of violation, ordeals enacted against the background of the religious pictures hanging on the walls of the bare rooms in which the two events took place. The image of the Madonna lactans presided over Lucie's humiliating sexual baptism, and the Christ of Gethsemane was the privileged witness of Ludvik's attempt to rape her. Kostka's retelling of Lucie's life has all the inner coherence but also the oppressiveness of a religious allegory. The human figures are reduced to their proper scale as illustrations of the perennially moving sacred drama of the birth and killing of the Man-God. It is quite obvious that Kostka does not know that the \"insistent soldier\" is his friend Ludvik, to whom he confides the tale of Lucie's past, and Ludvik fails to enlighten him. As a result of this withholding of facts, the two legends of Lucie, Ludvik's and Kostka's, are made to stand side by side in the novel in unmediated confrontation. At the end of the long winter, the deadening grip of shame is\n\nfinally unclasped from Lucie's soul, and she responds to Kostka with the passionate flowering of \"the great female springtime.\" Their lovemaking on a hilltop is a fulfillment of the pastoral promise of beauty that eluded Ludvik's grasp. As Kostka tells it, the scene of sexual consummation is ushered in by a spiritual epiphany in a landscape suddenly transfigured into the temple of God. But his severe, almost Jansenist conscience also weighs in, casting the bitter seeds of guilt on that triumph of the spirit over the body. He blames himself for being \"a seducer in priest's robes\" (p. 200), at the same time acknowledging that this scruple, which prompts him to resign from the farm and separate himself from Lucie, is also a great wrong done to her love for him, an abandonment and a human betrayal. Kostka lives with an internal tribunal sitting in permanent session in his conscience. Unlike the Communist believer, whose propensity for self-accusation he shares, the judgments to which he subjects himself are not open to external manipulation, and they rarely accommodate anyone's convenience. Kostka is not afraid of the truth, wherever it may lead him, yet for all its agonized honesty, his voice is burdened by too much certainty and grates unpleasantly against Ludvik's equally relentless but much lighter skepticism. Kostka's discourse, dominated by the vocative mode, is obtrusively insistent, even though it is gentle when directed at Lucie and stern mostly in dialogue with himself. Like the voice of the priest in the Cathedral scene of The Trial, it seems to come from a vast empty distance, and it resonates with a strangely inhuman sound. The final part of the novel hinges on two near-death scenes that produce first a comic and then a tragic catharsis. Both events, Helena's overdose and Jaroslav's heart attack, are preceded by a shattering of illusions, a leitmotif that connects the two characters to Ludvik, who is the third narrator of this part. As the three voices alternate in telling the action, the tempo varies from the staccato of the minimal sections to the more leisurely and even pace of the longer narrative passages. On Sunday morning, three spectators converge upon the Ride of the Kings, which takes place on the main street of the suburban village. Jaroslav has followed the preparations with anxious trepidation, even while giving perfunctory answers to the routine questions with which Helena, armed with a tape recorder, plies him. Ludvik, who is longing to leave the events of the past day behind him and return to Prague, stumbles into the din of the festival in a mood of cynical indifference. Kostka's revelations the evening before have destroyed his legend about Lucie's innocence, and with it, his own pathos as the unfulfilled lover. He now sees himself as the dupe in a laughable, somewhat obscene anecdote about a child-whore. In the yard of Jaroslav's house, the veiled beggar-king, dressed in a woman's costume as custom demands, and guarded by two pages also disguised as women, sits astride his festive horse. Deeply moved, Jaroslav forgets his exhaustion, approaches the figure, and whispers his son's name. Blinded by his will to believe that Vladimir has at last accepted the precious legacy he himself had received from his father, he is quite unaware that the real Vladimir has absconded to the motorcycle races in Brno with the active collusion of his mother. For the first time in his life, Jaroslav's second sight has failed him. He will follow the performance of insincere actors with true emotion, until his illusion is punctured by old man Koutecky, who tells him with a bit of malice that Vladimir has gone off with his grandson Milos. By contrast, Ludvik enters the spectacle in the middle, with a mind forewarned against a ritual debased into mass entertainment. The shabbiness of it all, the noise of the loudspeakers and the inattentiveness of the crowd, which keeps interfering with the cortege as it winds its way through a traffic jam, exceeds even his expectations. But then, making an effort to filter out the vulgar noise that surrounds him, Ludvik begins to listen to the strange music of the heralds, gradually discovering an island of pure sound, \"a construct on the border of speech and song.\" His musician's ear distinguishes each individual\n\nnote in the \"richly variegated canon\" (p. 221) of this primitive polyphony, whose incantatory power suggests to him the recitation of Greek tragedy. The formal beauty of the archaic verse he hears moves him as sublime poetry, precisely because he can read no particular meaning into it. His imagination, worn down by a perpetual wandering in a maze of symbols of his own making, which have all been inverted into parodies, takes in the healing power of chaste sound. Ludvik knows that the Ride of the Kings has been interpreted as a stylized commemoration of a historical event, perhaps the flight of defeated Hungarian king Matthias or, as some say (though Ludvik doesn't mention it), the escape from captivity of Prince Viktorin, son of the popular fifteenth-century Czech king Jiri Podebrady. He also knows about speculations that the Ride may be a survival of pagan rites of passage from boyhood to manhood. But he finds both readings redundant. As he lets himself sink into the vortex of rhythmic utterance, he momentarily experiences the vertigo of eternal forgetting. Twenty years earlier, when he had played one of the heralds to Jaroslav's king, he \"hadn't seen a thing,\" because he had experienced the Ride \"from within\" (p. 222). But as the coded speech works its deeper life-in-death magic upon him, it finally releases its hidden thaumaturgic gift of vision, without which all poetry, no matter how beautiful its inner articulation, would be a dead letter. \"Looking at the veiled king, I saw Lucie riding (unknown and unknowable) majestically (and mockingly) through my life\" (p. 223). The Ride of the Kings, Kundera says in his preface, \"frames the action of the novel; it is a frame of forgetting\" (p. viii). But it also connotes the very opposite of the act of forgetting, a ceremony of mnemonic empowering. Performed yearly on Whitsunday, the seventh Sunday after Easter, this seasonal ritual conceals in its pagan heart an allusion to the Pentecostal mystery of spiritual initiation. The beggar who hides the king, and the young man about to reach the first peak of virility disguised as a woman, are oxymoronic symbols of dignity masked in humility, of great power about to be released from constraint. In this ironic novel about the modern distemper between words and the things they signify, poetry suddenly flares out with its ancient tongue of flame. At last disabused of his deadening cynicism, Ludvik comes to the verge of addressing Lucie in the rediscovered language of love, the language in which she had courted him when she gave him those flowers picked from the cemetery. Freed from the narrow confines of Kostka's allegory—a tale that \"mixed truth with fiction and produced a new legend (closer to the truth, perhaps, more beautiful, more profound) to superimpose on the old\" (p. 223)—Lucie, the dispossessed figure of innocence, is finally reinstated by Ludvik to the intimate dignity of the beloved. The vision of Lucie rediscovered is abruptly dispelled by the sound of a male voice calling out to Ludvik. It is Pavel Zemanek, smilingly advancing with outstretched hand. Ludvik takes that hand just before the scene cuts to Jaroslav and his no less dumbfounding encounter with old Koutecky, the expropriated rich man who tells him the truth about his son Vladimir. Old hatreds are like old loves. One day they die, leaving in their fiery wake something like a budding nostalgia for shared memories. So Ludvik, in the next scene, hearing Pavel's attractive young girlfriend praise the former Stalinist as a liberal of the mid-sixties, one of the most popular lecturers at the university, registers a sneaking sympathy for his old enemy. Once again, Zemanek is successfully pointing his rhetoric in the same direction the whole country is headed. Sensing that \"the dishonorable truce\" (p. 236) with Zemanek is imminent, Ludvik is prepared to submit, only to be bested once again. His inveterate tormentor reduces the dreaded ceremony of reconciliation to a casual glance at his watch before departing with his beautiful young girlfriend on his arm. Ludvik then proceeds to tell Helena that he does not love her and will not see her again, in full awareness that \"she was quite innocent with respect to me\" (p. 237). Under that blow, Helena's bloated world collapses\n\ninstantly. But she is a woman of appetite, with little talent for despair. While her distracted mind toys with the temptation of eternal oblivion, she feels driven to indulge herself one more time by allowing Jindra, the young sound technician who dogs her footsteps with adolescent devotion, to kiss her on the mouth. Jindra is the source of the pills she has just ingested in a dangerously exaggerated quantity, in order to still the ache that racks her head. The consequences of Helena's halfhearted suicide attempt are described suspensefully from the perspective of a terrified Ludvik. He fears the worst once he has scanned Helena's melodramatic farewell message, which Jindra delivers to him by hand, in an envelope bearing the official letterhead of the Party District Council. The two men conduct a frantic search that finally leads them to the bolted door of a country outhouse. Forced open, the latrine yields a vision of comic anguish that more than matches in its extremity the dreaded image of a dead or dying Helena. Jindra s pills were not analgesics, as Helena had thought, but laxatives mislabeled in a gesture of self-protective prudery by an adolescent ashamed of the unpoetic character of his digestive tract. Helena, perched on the wooden seat of the primitive toilet with her skirt pulled up, is an outrageous sight that underlines the cruelty of laughter with a sadism that has shocked some of Kundera's readers. In 1967, when The Joke first appeared, the Czechs laughed freely, because they saw the Party being humiliated through Helena. But if we heed Kundera's counsel against a political interpretation of the novel, we are faced with the revolting spectacle of woman's body shamed through its \"place of excrement,\" without even a pornographic trace of anything that might remind us of Yeats' paradox about love's mansion. Panurge's obscene trick, which turns the pious lady who rejected his sexual advances into an object of unseemly attention for excited dogs right in the middle of a religious service,26 seems like a prank compared with the treatment Kundera reserves as Helena's reward for excessive complacency. Jindra, maddened by pity, turns upon the mortally embarrassed Ludvik. \"She doesn't need you for anything!\" he yells. \"She doesn't give a shit!\" (p. 254). In Czech, the throwa-way phrase has a directed concreteness impossible to reproduce in English. The expression \"Sere na Yds\" (\"She shits on you\"),27 which Jindra repeats twice without fully realizing what he is saying, turns the offensive noun \"shit\" into an active verb with Helena as its ruling grammatical subject. In this way, Czech speech manages to retrieve something for Helena from this agonizing scene, by endowing her body with the mimetic power of a Schweik. She suddenly escapes from the humiliating trap of her concrete position into the realm of verbal abstraction, where the words generate a vivid metaphor for the state of mind of a whole nation that has overdosed on so many lies for so many years. There is a measure of justice for Ludvik as well in this fully realized trope. He is, after all, the mirror as well as the victim of the age whose ill humors are thus purged. In the process, Helena's body is freed at last of the phony-noble rhetoric that has draped it, and it becomes pure physis once more, the Rabelaisian touchstone of truth, as when the child Gargantua demonstrates the empirical method of philosophical inquiry by testing for the best possible ass-wipe.28 Jindra's words release laughter from the grip of cruelty and bring merciful comic relief to Ludvik and to the narrative as well. Jaroslav's release from illusion follows immediately after. In a confrontation with Vlasta in their kitchen, he taxes her with complicity in Vladimir's betrayal, and when she retaliates, the exchange heats into a quarrel between the Communist and the kulak's daughter. She sullenly keeps her thin back turned to him as she stands at her stove, pretending to be busy with her cooking. The rage inside him keeps mounting, until he starts breaking the dishes on the floor. After this uncharacteristic bout of violence, he steps over the rubble in his home, where he had \"borne the tender yoke of the poor man's daughter\" (p. 257), conscious of stepping out of his dream world forever.\n\nIn his anger at Vlasta, who has been filling his house with the tasteless bibelots of neo-bourgeois consumerism, Jaroslav would like to think that he is hitting out against the Koutecky element. But Ludvik, whom he meets outdoors, knows better, having understood that \"they\" and \"we,\" terms once pitted against each other in the ideological discourse of 1948, are hopelessly ambiguous whenever applied to real experience. History, with its lure of eternal memory, is really a very ironic jade. All rectification (both vengeance and forgiveness) will be taken over by oblivion\" (p. 245). This maxim belongs to Ludvik, mulling over his encounter with Zemanek, but it applies equally to the aftertaste of Jaroslav's confrontation with Vlasta, when he is like \"an abandoned king past his prime\" (p. 258), a man deprived of his sense of the future by the sudden loss of his legitimate heir. In the last, poignant scene of the novel, Ludvik sits down to play with Jaroslav's cimbalom ensemble in the same restaurant where Jindra had sounded his false alarm that afternoon. The two old friends, when they acknowledge each other at last, at the end of the harrowing weekend, seem to have exchanged roles. Jaroslav, still the masterful fiddler, plays with the passion born of despair, as if trying to hold the melody one more time against the growing tide of indifference about to engulf him. Ludvik, chastened by what he has been through, picks up his clarinet with the authentic tenderness of a long-delayed homecoming. As they concentrate on playing, life appears to Ludvik bathed in the gentle light of forgiveness. From within the \"glass cabin\" of an ancient love song, the values he and Jaroslav shared in their youth, which circulated in words like \"comrade,\" \"Fucik,\" and \"the future,\" revealing a sinister underside in the process, appear to him again in their original innocence, like Lucie come back to him in the \"magic circle of music\" (p. 264) to plead \"on behalf of a devastated world.\" Moved by an irresistible wave of understanding compassion, Ludvik accepts her lyric persuasion. \"The blame lay elsewhere and was so great that its shadow had fallen over a vast area, over the world of innocent things (and words), and was devastating them\" (p. 262). This statement, rising with the insistence that only final conclusions can muster in any discourse, seems to beg for a commentary transcending the immediacy of the moment of grace that inspired it. The Joke was written in 1965, when Czech culture was experiencing the gathering momentum of hope. It is characteristic of Kundera's temper that he ends his novel against the grain of optimism and the righteous clamor for retribution that filled the Czech air at the time. One may well ask how much hope there should have been about the liberalizing trend in Communism whose representative is the opportunistic Zemanek. Rather than looking forward to a time when \"Communism with a human face\" would be the slogan meant to legitimize an outburst of radical skepticism to Russian ears, Kundera's nostalgic coda contemplates the meaning of 1948 and the things long gone, which people like Zemanek were busily forgetting. But even in relation to Zemanek, Ludvik's mind, purged of all venom, leans toward an understanding that has the poignantly personal quality of generational sympathy. As the music swells, Jaroslav, the defeated dreamer, suffers a heart attack that will doom him to live out the rest of his life without passion, \"under the watchful eye of death.\" He is the image of a man of true feeling whom the age has played false. But it is inside the skeptical mind of Ludvik that Jaroslav's lost faith flares up one last time, with a tragic incandescence that lingers with the reader as the novel's culminating effect. Looking down at his stricken friend, Ludvik pictures himself \"holding him in my arms, holding him and carrying him, carrying him, big and heavy as he was, carrying my own obscure guilt; I could picture myself carrying him through the indifferent mob, weeping as I went\" (p. 266). The repetition of the word \"carrying,\" with its rhythmic insistence on the burdensome assumption of guilty responsibility in an act of purely gratuitous love, becomes a dirge for a past never more loved than at this moment of its passing into a dreamlike state of being. While Zemanek the timeserver elbows his way back to the helm of unfolding events, Ludvik chooses to stay behind with Jarosla"
