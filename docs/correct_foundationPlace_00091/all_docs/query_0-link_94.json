Prisma Cloud continuously monitors and learns each user's activities to identify what’s normal, and then alerts on any behaviors that deviate from that baseline.\n\nAnomalous compute provisioning detection\n\nLearn the normal behavior of each user to detect anomalous compute provisioning activities, indicative of either accidental resource misuse or more sinister attacks like cryptojacking\n\nInsider threat detection\n\nDiscover suspicious behaviors such as excessive login failures that could signal compromised accounts, brute force attacks, and other behaviors that traditional security tools miss.\n\nSuspicious user activity detection\n\nIdentify specific actions and surface correlated account data, both in real time and with historical context."
