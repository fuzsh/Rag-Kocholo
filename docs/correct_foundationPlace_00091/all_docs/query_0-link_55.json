In 2007, the facility ceased operations and was demolished in 2009. All the surface structures, including distillation towers, storage tanks, and hazardous waste drum storage buildings were demolished as part of the closure process.\n\nRomic operated the 12.6-acre facility from approximately 1964 to 2007. Historical facility operations included solvent recycling, fuel blending, wastewater treatment, and hazardous waste storage and treatment. Soil and groundwater beneath the site became contaminated as a result of Romic's past operations and those of its predecessor companies dating back to the 1950s. The primary contaminants in the soil and groundwater are volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Typical VOCs found at Romic are solvents used in the dry cleaning and automotive industries. Groundwater contamination extends across most of the site to a depth of at least 80 feet below ground surface.\n\nRemedy Decision for Soil and Groundwater\n\nBiological treatment was the primary remedy selected by EPA to address the solvent contaminated soil and groundwater. Biological treatment was tested at the former facility and was proven to be successful.\n\nSite Cleanup and Redevelopment\n\nEPAâ€™s selected remedy is designed to allow for flexibility during redevelopment, such as allowing the cleanup to proceed underground at the same time construction is happening on the surface. This is possible because the horizontal injection wells and the biological treatment system can operate independently and not interfere with the redevelopment construction. The full-scale treatment system was installed in 2020 and groundwater treatment is underway.\n\nEPA's approach emphasizes that closure, clean-up and reuse are complementary goals. Consideration of anticipated property reuse is an integral part of the EPA's clean-up decisions. The community of East Palo Alto may benefit from redevelopment which could generate new business for the community and additional revenues for the city, while at the same time resulting in a cleaner environment.\n\nKey Documents and Further Information\n\nThe following PDF files contain the key documents EPA used in the remedy decision making process and for the site cleanup. Hard copies of these documents are available for public review at the following location:\n\nU.S. EPA Pacific Southwest, Region 9\n\n75 Hawthorne St.\n\nSan Francisco, CA 94105\n\nIf you have questions or would like to make an appointment to see the records, contact the Project Manager, Nicole Palazzolo (palazzolo.nicole@epa.gov) at (415) 972-3045."
