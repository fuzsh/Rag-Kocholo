        "text": "Ben Herzog, 93, of Knowlton, passed away Monday, September 18, 2017 at his ranch.\n\nBenjamin Theodore Herzog was born May 1, 1924 in Miles City, MT to John and Elsa (Eichenberger) Herzog, the third of eight children. He was raised on the family dairy in Yellowstone Valley, and at a young age, he learned a strong work ethic; milking cows and helping deliver milk before school for the Herzog’s Miles City Dairy. He went to Kircher School and graduated from Custer Co High School in 1942, the smallest guy in his senior class. Then he enlisted in the Navy, and it grew him up to be the tallest Herzog. He went to Naval school in Seattle, before shipping out on the USS Idaho during World War II and his ship was hit off Japan, so D Day was special to him!\n\nBen came back home to later meet the love of his life, Leona Mae Wildman. He had to wait for her to turn 18 and graduate, and they were married on May 23, 1948 in Miles City. They honeymooned to Alaska in a Pontiac car, pulling a pop-up camper. They ran out of money due to unforeseen breakdowns, so Ben worked for a while at a sawmill, and still needed his Dad to wire them money to get home. They returned back to Yellowstone Valley to the family farm, where they started their family: Patricia Carol, Roger Allen, and Monte Lee.\n\nIn the fall of 1955, they bought the Finch ranch at Knowlton for $12.50 an acre, and Grandpa John sold him cows for $85. Monte was only 3 months old, when Ben moved his bride from a modern home to a ranch house with coal heat, no electricity or running water, but Leona was back where she grew up. Old timers said there was no way that would work! With lots of hard work and a good business mind, they survived the drought years from 1955-1961 and Ben had to put up hay in Miles City some years.\n\nIn 1972, they leased the Wildman ranch and bought it in 1984. In 1977, Ben, Leona and Monte became Herzog and Son, Inc. and Ben and Leona continued to ranch with their youngest son, Monte and family. They always enjoyed having the grandkids a week at a time at the ranch in the summers, and everyone loved the Sunday dinners and card parties with all the family and many friends. Dad was always proud to take everyone for rides in the back of the pickup to show them the ranch and the beautiful views and wildlife. Hunting season was a special time, as were the motorcycle rides with Grandpa.\n\nBen T. always loved his ranch life, motor biking, hunting, fishing, the special elk hunts at Harley’s, and he was hard to beat at any game of cards! He loved challenging his grandkids at cribbage, and just a month ago, he showed niece, Tricia Lee, how it’s done! He loved his family and he surely will be missed.\n\nIn retirement, he got to stay in his home in the country, and he still checked on cows and their water on his 4-wheeler, and took his doggies for a ride, nearly every day, weather permitting. He loved reading, FOX news, and kept up on all the latest politics and news with his sharp mind. In the last 10 years, he shared lots of war stories with Jay Woods that he never told the rest of us.\n\nHe is survived by Monte & Pat Herzog, Patsy & Mike Davis, and grandchildren: Marla Gibson, Dusty Davis, Jody Fiechtner, Jenny Ketchum, Randy Herzog, Ryan Herzog, Tammy Herzog, Jennifer Denby, Kaci Woods and Joe Herzog, and greats: Shyln, Olivia, Devon, Matthew- Carson, Reid, Brianna, Ashtyn, Blake, Lucas – Braedon, Jacob, Zoey & Sadie. Also, brother, Paul and sister, Irma.\n\nHe was preceded in death by wife, Leona; son, Roger; his parents; and siblings, Menga, John C, Ruth, Larry and Sharon.\n\nVisitation will be held on Friday, September 22, 2017 at Stevenson & Sons Funeral Home with family receiving friends from 4:00-6:00 p.m. Funeral services will be held on Saturday, September 23, 2017 at 10:00 a.m. at Grace Bible Church. Interment will follow in the Knowlton Cemetery.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorials can be made to the Knowlton Cemetery Fund in Ben’s name."
