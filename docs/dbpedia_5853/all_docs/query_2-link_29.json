        "text": "I’ve been unbelievably lucky in my career. I’ve worked with so many amazing people, across so many different subject areas, contexts, sizes, verticals, you name it. And even in that incredibly lucky context, Delving has been an exceptional experience. I’ve rarely had the joy of working with such a uniformly healthy, supportive, highly-performing team and I’ve cherished every moment. And, like many other startups in the current climate, we’ve made the difficult choice to streamline operations and conserve runway while we deepen our product market fit. I’ve shifted from my CPO role to a board seat, and remain engaged in an advisory capacity. I feel deeply privileged to be able to continue to help steer our company through this time and I’m jazzed at the way our adoption is growing and the quick iterations we’re learning through. (Seriously, if you deal with spreadsheets check out how we help you compare them at https://lnkd.in/edmQsraC.) I’ve also begun a new role I’m very excited about, and I’ll update here shortly. But for the moment I just wanted to say thanks to the Delving team for an incredibly awesome year. I can’t wait to see what we all do from here.\n\nI have so much to say about graduating from MIT Sloan School of Management with an MBA - way too much to cram into a single post. So I want to start with gratitude. Not many poor girls from tiny towns in Maine make it to where I am, and I wouldn't be here without an incredible amount of luck and support from others. I'm grateful to the MIT Sloan Executive Education EMBA team, who welcomed us with open arms and worked so hard to give us the best possible experience during a global pandemic. To the faculty, who shared their brilliance and insight in a practical, engaging, challenging way. To my colleagues the #pandEMBAs, who helped me grow, made me laugh, and became lifelong friends. To the folks at Travelers, who kept on top of things while I was in class and let me bring what I was learning back to our work. To my friends, who cheered me on and supported me every step of the way. As many of my colleagues have said, this degree was a team sport and I was playing alongside superstars. Thank you, all. I'm also ridiculously grateful to Jonathan and our teens. And I want to highlight this for a moment. Even outside the context of a degree, it's still pretty unusual for a mom to have equal partnership at home. These last 20 months, Jon and our kids did *way* more than that. They took _100%_ of the household load. I didn't cook. I didn't clean. I didn't do dishes, or laundry, or schedule doctor's appointments, or keep track of any music lessons or birthday parties or teacher gifts or do the after school taxi dance, or vet visits, or any of it. Whatever family time I had was devoted to *actually connecting* with my family. Words can't really express what this support has meant to me (and even if they could, Jon's not one for public displays). But I wanted to take a moment to recognize the support I had simply because it flips the script that so many of my fellow mothers experience. I've always been proud of the way Jon and I trade off supporting one another's big dreams and goals, but I don't speak about it much. So this time, I wanted to say: It is *possible* for moms to get the same kind of support that many dads in the corporate world enjoy. Jon's career didn't suffer. We all made it through. We're lucky, of course. And in addition to luck, we're better off for digging in and showing our kids a less-typical (?) model for balancing careers and family needs. Thank you so, *so much* to everyone who helped me become who I am and reach this moment. I'm wicked excited to see where we all go from here.\n\nHi friends! I’m extremely excited to share that I’ve accepted a position as the Chief Product Officer at Delving. Product leadership, innovation, and entrepreneurship are core to who I am, and working with Joshua McKenty and Carl Coryell-Martin again is such a delight. But the clincher for me is the problem we’re solving: Nearly one billion spreadsheet users fuel the world’s decisions each month, and spreadsheet collaboration & review is… clunky and frustrating to say the least. How is it still true that the central pillar of business decision-making is so painful for teams? We can do better, *without* telling folks they shouldn’t use Excel. And I’m so jazzed to be a part of creating this better world. (If that sounds good to you too, please reach out! We’re primarily focused on expanding our engineering team* right now, but other disciplines will follow soon — and bringing amazing people from all functions together to achieve the unlikely is my favorite thing in the world. ) *** Any announcement like this is bittersweet, and today’s is no exception. I’ve had the privilege of working closely with so many great people at Travelers these last couple of years. Transforming culture & ways of working is incredibly challenging work. But our teams pulled together, dug in, and got incredible things done -- while remaining true to Travelers’ deep commitment to caring for one another, always. I’m incredibly grateful for, and proud of, the work we’ve done. I’m honored that Travelers has asked me to stay on in a consultive role to ensure the transition is smooth and successful, and I can’t wait to see what this fantastic team does from here. *** *https://lnkd.in/g3iZcZe3 & email careers@delving.co :-)"
