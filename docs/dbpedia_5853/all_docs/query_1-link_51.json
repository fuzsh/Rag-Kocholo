        "text": "Philip Ashman Herzog OBITUARY\n\nPHILIP ASHMAN HERZOG Herzog, Philip Ashman, was born August 18, 1937. Taken home for eternal rest with the Lord on October 2, 2003. Philip was the son of the late Emilie Buskirk Ashman and Karl Herzog. He is survived by his “forever love” and wife, Laura Herzog, Daughters Lisa Maree Herzog, Lori Renee Herzog, and Gwen Margaret Herzog. Son Christopher Cory Herzog. Two step children Michael and Joshua and 6 grandchildren. Philip was an amazing, loving and caring man that would do anything he could for anyone in need. He has touched the lives and hearts of all those that come into contact with him. He was greatly loved by his “forever love” wife, Laura, family, and friends. His parting is a tremendous loss and we each are grieving deeply on our own ways, but I ask you now to please look to the Lord and know that he is in a better place and is in perfect peace at home with the Lord. cancer took him from us very quickly and unexpectedly. Please rest assuredly knowing he did pass very peacefully held in the arms of his wife Laura who remained at his bedside and cared for him and his every need 24 hours a day. The last weeks of his life, she never left his side. God brought Laura and Philip together and the love that they shared was a strong love . Everyone could see, even to the very end, that love cannot and will never be, taken away. What God has brought together, no man can separate. Some people search their entire life for the love they have and never are able to find and experience what Laura and Philip have shared and that in itself is a true miracle brought only from the Lord. In his remaining days here, he fought and continued to share that love with her each and every day. Philip held her, kissed her, said “I Love You”, and that she was not only the most beautiful thing in his life but was also God’s Grave to him and then took her hand and took his last peaceful breath with no pain. God Bless You, Philip, my dear and “forever love”. You will always be here with me and we will be together again soon. I will never forget what we had and still have and I thank you my “forever love”. Thank you to his daughters. Lisa, you have been my sense of comfort and my new daughter. Gwen, I love you, and I will, as I promised your father, I will be here for your every need. Mort Rose you are Philip’s Best and Dearest friend. Thank you for your love and support to him during his time here on this earth, and the love that you both share is forever. Never forget how much he loves you. I pray to have you as a part of my life. Thank You all and my sincere love goes out to each one of you. I pray for God’s blessings on all your lives, now and forever.
