        "text": "Charles Augustus (born September 3, 1757, Weimar, Eisenach—died June 14, 1828, Schloss Graditz, near Torgau, Weimar) was the Grossherzog (grand duke) of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, an enlightened ruler, and patron of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. He made his court and the University of Jena leading intellectual centres of Germany during the late 18th and early 19th centuries.\n\nIntroduced to Goethe in 1774, Charles Augustus formed a lifelong friendship with the poet, who shared the grand duke’s patronage at Weimar with such other intellectuals as the philosopher Johann Gottfried von Herder and the poet Friedrich Schiller.\n\nA supporter of Prussia, Charles Augustus took part in the wars against Revolutionary France. After the battles of Jena and Auerstädt (1806), he was forced to join the Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine. In 1813, however, he sided once again with a resurgent Germany, commanding a corps against Napoleon in the Netherlands. Weimar’s territories were increased at the Congress of Vienna (1815), and though he became a grand duke, Charles protested the congress’s reactionary spirit. The following year he granted his state a liberal constitution, becoming the first German ruler to do so."
