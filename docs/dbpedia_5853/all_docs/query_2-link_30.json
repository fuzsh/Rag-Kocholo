        "text": "This week, the prolific film-maker Werner Herzog has also released a Netflix documentary called Into the Inferno, about the terrible might of active volcanoes. Here is his second new film this year (there’s a third to come, called Salt and Fire). It’s another catastrophist study of a colossal force that is indifferent to humans’ puny and irrelevant moral judgement. His subject is the internet and our new world of digital interconnectivity, and he takes a sombre, quite censorious line.\n\nThe first crudely web-linked computer at UCLA whirred into life in 1969, and is still kept in the university’s computer science department. “The corridors here look repulsive … ” growls Herzog, a little bafflingly. They just look like bland, functional corridors. But it was there that the computer sent the first two letters of “log on” before halting. Herzog suggests the resulting “lo … ” is a serendipitous cry, as in “ … and behold!”\n\nIt’s a second industrial revolution, which has been achieved without the pollution of the first – but which might have created dark, satanic mills of the mind. It has unlocked huge reserves of creative energy, revolutionised communication, democratised the means of publication, enabled amazing feats of crowdsourced knowledge and dazzlingly speedy analysis. But it has also legitimised hatred and abuse, created poisonously addictive narcissism, and encouraged companies and nation states to entrust vital services to digital control and remote management, leaving them horribly vulnerable to hacking, vandalism and natural disasters that, in an analogue age, would have caused only local difficulty. Herzog’s inimitable, rasping voice runs through all these scenarios off-camera. Somehow it’s the bad stuff that seems to get his juices pumping.\n\nInevitably, he cites the great New Yorker cartoon: “On the internet, no one can tell you’re a dog.” Anonymity is the great, dark force of the web: it abolishes status and respect. Dog and human are as one – sort of. Herzog interviews a mother and father who were psychologically torn apart when trolls circulated sickening photographs of their daughter, who had been killed in a car accident. It’s an ordeal that would not have existed before the web. (However, Herzog neglects to mention citizen journalists who can call the mighty to account by taking and sharing pictures and videos. It’s been very important for the #blacklivesmatter movement.) The other dog-equals-man aspect of the internet is cyberwarfare. Small countries can attack Goliath superpowers on almost equal terms. It’s an interesting, disturbing concept, not touched upon in Alex Gibney’s cyberwarfare documentary Zero Days.\n\nHerzog addresses the subject of internet addiction, and speaks to web rehab specialists, and former obsessive gamers who are in recovery. The movie at this stage reminded me in some ways of Beeban Kidron’s 2013 film about web addiction, InRealLife, although Herzog does not take Kidron’s bolder tack of finding the positives in our web-orientated life, and avoiding the obviously supercilious tack of affecting to be deeply concerned by the web while in actual fact being as utterly dependent on it as everyone else. The other trick I think Herzog misses is the relatively recent invention of the smartphone, which overnight made our web-dependence all but total. I couldn’t help remembering the episode of Josh Widdicombe’s BBC3 sitcom, Josh, in which his flatmate Kate has to wait in all day for her new phone to be delivered; when a powercut makes the TV useless, she goes quickly insane, as she realises she has lost the ability to amuse herself by thinking or reading a book.\n\nHerzog is on firmer ground when he ruminates on the nature of artificial intelligence. He musingly cites Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz’s comment that war can dream of itself, and asks if the web can dream of itself – also bringing in Philip K Dick’s great title Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? The answer seems to be: yes, the internet does dream of itself – in the form of Tim Berners-Lee’s world wide web. These sites make up the endlessly morphing, proliferating, interreacting dreamscape of humanity’s hive mind. Each site, each page and each meme is a pixel of the web’s unconscious.\n\nThis is a thorough, thoughtful piece of work from Herzog, but slightly ho-hum in its fence-sitting tendencies: I actually think Kidron’s film is clearer and more satisfying in its way. The web could be good, could be bad, could revolutionise consciousness and identity, or maybe not. Sometimes it is as if the film is stymied by the very importance on which it had insisted from the beginning. It is very much a reverie: something more wakeful might have been better."
