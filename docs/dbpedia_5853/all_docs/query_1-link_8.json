        "text": "Karl Friedrich August Herzog zu Mecklenburg-Strelitz\n\n(30.11.1785 - 21.09.1837)\n\nplace of birth: Hannover\n\nKönigreich Preußen: KG, General der Infanterie\n\nKarl zu Mecklenburg was the initial commanding general of Prussia's Guards Corps (Garde-Korps) in Berlin, serving a period of 23 years from 1814 to 1837. During this period, he also served as president of the Prussian State Council (Preußischer Staatsrat). Karl was the son of Karl II. Großherzog zu Mecklenburg-Strelitz and his second wife Charlotte von Hessen-Darmstadt, who died during Karl's birth. Karl was a prince of the House Strelitz, but carried the title of Herzog, or Duke. Karl's sister Queen Luise of Prussia, with whom he was very close, was the spouse of King Friedrich Wilhelm III. Young Karl entered Prussian military service in 1799 and was on General von Blucher's general staff during the German Campaign of 1813-1815 (Befreiungskriege). He was wounded during the war, but for his actions was decorated with the Pour le Mérite order, as well as the Iron Cross I. Class."
