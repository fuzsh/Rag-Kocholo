        "text": "We are delighted to welcome Werner Herzog as a participant in the event »Landscapes in Trance. Werner Herzog: Reading and Discussion« on September 14, 2023, 7 pm, at Haus der Berliner Festspiele.\n\nWerner Herzog, director of more than 40 feature films and documentaries that rank among the milestones of cinematic art, talks with writer Jan Brandt about the importance of writing and literature for his work. From the essay »Of Walking in Ice« about a hike from Munich to Paris in the winter of 1974, which has its own magic as a meditation on life and death, to the legendary diary of the filming of »Fitzcarraldo« with Klaus Kinski and his memoir »Every Man for Himself and God Against All« [2022].\n\nHALLUCINATIONS\n\nREADING FROM TEXTS BY WERNER HERZOG\n\nVOLKSTHEATER\n\nVienna October 28, 2022\n\nWith Werner Herzog and Ernst Reijseger, Mola Sylla, Harmen Fraanje - and Ernst Reijseger, Mola Sylla, Harmen Fraanje - and the Sardinian chorus Cuncordu e Tenore de Orosei\n\nDuring an event at the occasion of Werner Herzog's 80th birthday, the Volkstheater in Vienna in cooperation with Viennale staged an exclusive reading by Werner Herzog from his memoires JEDER FÜR SICH UND GOTT GEGEN ALLE. The reading is accompanied by the musicians Ernst Reijseger, Mola Sylla, Harmen Fraanje and the Sardinian chorus Cuncordu e Tenore de Orosei. Music from another world.\n\nThe musicians offered three encores after the reading.\n\nWerner Herzog is cult! Celebrated as a director and with his work premiering at international film festivals, Herzog stands not only for his non-conformist attitude among cineastes, but is also highly popular among the internet-savvy generation.\n\nThere is hardly another living director who can keep pace with the extent of Herzog’s many contributions, not to mention his imitators on social networks. The popular television entertainers Joko & Klaas parodied him, Herzog has had guest appearances on the ‘Simpsons,’ and he has drawn a great deal of attention to the ‘Star Wars’ series ‘The Mandalorian’ (since 2019) by playing the villain. In around 70 feature films and documentaries, Werner Herzog has created extraordinary visual imagery that goes far beyond what we are accustomed to seeing at the cinema.\n\nA press tour with the team of curators takes place at the Deutsche Kinemathek on 24 August, 2022, at 11 am. Invitations will be sent out shortly before the preview.\n\nRead more at:\n\nwww.deutsche-kinemathek.de\n\nHis life is a life of the century, his memoirs are a literary event.\n\n\"As a child,\" writes Werner Herzog, \"I was convinced I would not reach my eighteenth year.\" It turned out differently. Werner Herzog's long-awaited memoir recounts a life of the century that wouldn't even fit into one of his own famous films.\n\nA perpetually hungry boy, fleeing with his mother from bombed Munich to a desperately poor nest in the Alps. A youth with an all-bursting thirst for adventure, who hitchhikes all alone and soon finds himself in the furthest reaches of Egypt, delirious with fever, waiting for death. A lover, an enthusiast, a driven man: a man who quietly talks to the raging Klaus Kinski in the middle of the jungle, a man who sits weeping for his friend Bruce Chatwin at his deathbed.\n\nFor Werner Herzog's 80th birthday, his memoirs are published, which are anything but merely a resume. Desolate and gentle, full of lust for life and wonder at our world, this book is a literary event.\n\nPreorder now:\n\nCarl Hanser Literatur- und Sachbuchverlag München\n\n\"All Of Us Are In Some Sort Of Theater We Create For Ourselves\" - Werner Herzog On Being A Character, 6.22.2022\n\n\"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\"\n\nWerner Herzog is the author of the new book, \"The Twilight World,\" and he joins Stephen for a two-part interview that begins with an examination of the theater of life, and the incredible story of the subject of his book, Hiroo Onada.\n\nWerner Herzog Doesn't Get Nervous When He Releases New Movies, 6.24.2022\n\n\"Late Night with Seth Meyers\"\n\nWerner Herzog discusses the true story behind his novel The Twilight World, how he manages working on multiple projects at once and why he doesn't like speaking French.\n\nThe UK’s Sheffield DocFest (June 23-28) has unveiled its 2022 line-up, including the world premiere of Werner Herzog’s \"The Fire Within: Requiem For Katia And Maurice Krafft.\"\n\n\"The Fire Within\", which is written, narrated and directed by Herzog, will feature in DocFest’s Memories strand. It chronicles the French volcanologists who died in a volcanic eruption on Japan’s Mount Uzen in 1991, leaving an archive of more than 200 hours of footage that makes up the film.\n\nHerzog previously explored the life of Katie and Maurice Krafft in his 2016 Netflix documentary \"Into The Inferno\".\n\nFor more details visit:\n\nwww.sheffdocfest.com\n\nThe great filmmaker Werner Herzog, in his first novel, tells the incredible story of Hiroo Onoda, a Japanese soldier who defended a small island in the Philippines for twenty-nine years after the end of World War II\n\nHiroo Onoda is young when Japan surrenders to the USA and the Second World War ends without him knowing about it. He is old when his war finally comes to an end as well. For decades after, the soldier has continued to defend a meaningless island in the Pacific. Like a ghost, Onoda hides in the jungle, fighting with the merciless nature as well as with his own demons.\n\nThe great author and filmmaker Werner Herzog met the man with this special past himself in Japan. His first book in many years is a glowing, moving pictorial dance of the sense and nonsense of our existence.\n\nThis year, the Honorary Award of the German Documentary Film Prize goes to Werner Herzog for his life's work.\n\nThe 79-year-old director, producer and author is one of the most important and influential filmmakers worldwide. His films are considered densely narrated masterpieces that blur the line between fiction and documentary. As a director, he thus creates style-defining documentary works that are often dedicated to the elemental force of nature, the attraction of distant places or the depths of the human condition. The prize was awarded as part of the SWR Doku Festival on June 24, 2022.\n\nWim Wenders and Werner Herzog - ©SWR/Sigrid Faltin"
