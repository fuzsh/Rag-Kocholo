        "text": "Hi I'm assuming you are talking about this dude, I bet he didn't get many invites to the Buckingham Palace Garden Parties\n\nPS I havn't got a clue as to why it is underlined??\n\nEdited June 10, 2013 by Alex K\n\nThe book, The Royals and the Reich details his truly twisted pathetic career/life. Like so many Germans, he was seduced by Hitler, although in his case he admitted to having a strong homosexual attraction to Adolf Hitler. He was openly jealous of Eva Braun. Speer used to joke about it.\n\nhe was and is an embarrassment to the Windsors.\n\nEdited June 12, 2013 by Ulsterman\n\nCan someone fix the thread title? Eduard wasn't his surname, Carl Eduard was his given name. Royals don't have surnames, but as a matter of practice, he would be either \"Herzog von Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha, Carl Eduard\" or \"Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha, Carl Eduard Herzog von\".\n\nOne son, Prinz Hubertus, was killed in action in 1943 as an Oberleutnant in the Luftwaffe. Another, Prinz Friedrich Josias, who would head the house after Carl Eduard's death, was an Oberleutnant in the Army, serving in armored reconnaissance units and then in a bunch of staff jobs after Hitler got more leery of princes serving in combat. He did remain at the front well after the Prinzenerlass, though. The William and Harry to Carl Eduard's Charles, in some respects.\n\nSince this is a signature database, here is that of Prinz Friedrich Josias.\n\nHere is the last evaluation in his file, when he was an Ordonnanz-Offizier for Field Marshal Rommel. Shortly after this, on 25 June 1944, he was transferred to Frontaufklärungskommando 140."
