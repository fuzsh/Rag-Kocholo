        "text": "The invitation for last week’s Chanel show in Hamburg, Germany, featured an original sketch by designer Karl Lagerfeld of the port city’s iconic gates. \"The Gateway to the World,” as Hamburg has been known for centuries. Now, they open onto the futuristic-looking Elbphilharmonie, the city’s new concert hall, which was designed by contemporary starchitecture firm Herzog and De Meuron and opened to much fanfare last year. According to the designer, who was born here and raised in Hamburg before moving to Paris and launching one of the most iconic fashion careers ever, it was a symbolic gesture of the city’s blending of the old and the new. “Before, Hamburg was lacking some cultural power. Now, suddenly, it’s become the culture capital of Germany,” he said, citing especially the Elbphilharmonie's trapezoid shape and roof that surfs up from the harbor like the top of a wave. “This place is booked every night, every day. Everyone wants to see this place, which I must say is stunning.” Lagerfeld adds that he knows everyone thinks Berlin is Germany’s creative epicenter, but those in the know head to Hamburg.\n\nLagerfeld is famously non-nostalgic. He has built a career on anticipating what comes next in fashion, and his shows have included everything from faux icebergs (a comment on global warming) to tiny Chanel bags inspired by alcohol monitoring ankle bracelets (when it seemed like every celebrity had gotten a DUI). After he presented his Metiers d’Art show here, I asked if returning to his hometown was as close as we’d see to him being wistful. “I like Hamburg as an abstract idea. The reality is it’s not for my job. It’s something in the background of my mind,” he said, adding that the city looks much different today than it did when he left in the 1950s. “I had a house here, which some people said was the most beautiful house I ever had, but I had no life to put in it.”\n\nI arrived a few days before Lagerfeld’s shows to take in some of the city sites. (Unfortunately, the designer said he didn’t get to see much of the city before the show—“unless you count what I saw from the car from the airport”—because he was in model fittings.) Hamburg around Christmastime looks quainter than an oil painting. I visited the Rathausmarkt, which had hand-carved nutcrackers, Christmas tree ornaments, and food stalls full of the sort of delicious, doughy food one wants on a chilly holiday evening. Obligatory punny Instagram caption: “Having the wurst time in Hamburg” when I ate the best sausage I’ve ever tried, a currywurst. At one point in the evening, Father Christmas sleighed over the crowd, but I should warn you: Santa sounds rather ominous when he speaks German.\n\nOther highlights: A tour of the Steinway piano factory, most of which I wasn’t able to photograph to protect some of the secrets the [family has used since the mid-1800s. The Deichtorhallen museum had a retrospective of the American painter Alice Neel, which blew my socks off (it's on through January 14). It’s funny how sometimes you need to look at culture through the lens of another country to reflect on its significance. But by far my personal highlight was a visit to the Miniatur Wunderland, an entire museum devoted to meticulously re-created miniatures that boasts the world’s largest model train display. I felt like I had entered into a frat boy fantasy land: A Star Wars ship took off from the model airport and there were secret tunnels full of elephants on exotic journeys. (No, really. I promise it’s super cool.) As for the best food in Hamburg, I took a recommendation from Karl himself: Jacob’s, one of the oldest restaurants in Germany, which the designer frequented with his parents on Sunday nights when he was a little boy. “The food is very good,” he told me, just as good as he remembered it. “Which may be surprising because Germany is not famous for its haute cuisine.”\n\nWhen the night of the show arrived, I ditched my shirt and tie for a turtleneck—the cold air whips off the sea in Hamburg—and took my seat at the Elbphilharmonie. German model Anna Ewers opened the show, which incorporated influences from Germany’s largest port city (“I was inspired by modern shipping containers”) and the mod fashions of the 1960s, including short skirts and high boots. To that, Lagerfeld reminded us of this little known fun fact: From 1960 to 1962, the Beatles performed often in Hamburg, honing their craft. Legend has it their infamous bowl haircuts were born in Hamburg. Many of the models wore Lagerfeld’s versions of “Beatles caps.” Lagerfeld also reinterpreted striped shirts, wide-legged trousers and pea coats, which Coco Chanel herself had already borrowed from a sailor’s wardrobe.\n\nFollowing the fashion show, dinner for around 1,000 was organized at the Fischauktionshalle, Hamburg’s historic fish market. Die Blowboys Choir provided a cappella entertainment while we ate. Chanel had also organized several party favors, including a temporary tattoo parlor, a foosball tournament, photo booth and traditional German carnival games. After dinner, there was a performance by Los Ninos du Brasil, a South American percussion duo that combines techno music with live drumming and a generous splattering of handheld graffiti canons. It got Lagerfeld devotees Lily Rose Depp and Kristen Stewart (with her girlfriend Stella Maxwell in tow) on the dance floor. On the way out, the air was heavy, the night sky pitch black. “Which I think has a romance and beauty to it,” Lagerfeld said. “The North of Europe is not bad as a people think. It’s quite beautiful. The weather is very clean. In the north of Europe, where I spent my childhood in the countryside, it’s not polluted and it’s very healthy. If you want to wear the same shirt for a week you go to the island of Silt and you cannot get dirty.”"
