Member of the editorial boards of Zeitschrift für Sexualforschung, WSQ, German History, and German Politics and Society.\n\nSIDELIGHTS:\n\nEducator and writer Dagmar Herzog conducts research on how religion and secularization have affected social and political developments in modern Europe. She has taught history at Michigan State University and the City University of New York, and was a Mellon Faculty Fellow at Harvard University. She has contributed to numerous periodicals and journals related to the study of history. Herzog also has served on the executive committee of the German Studies Association.\n\nIn 1996, Herzog published Intimacy and Exclusion: Religious Politics in Pre-revolutionary Baden. The book studies the politics and ethics of German liberal- ism in the early nineteenth century, specifically concentrating on attitudes toward Jews and women. Using traditional methodology and sources to build her case, the author argues that religious issues were in fact important in the politics of the day, and that liberals were very concerned with the issues of marriage and sexuality from 1820 to 1848. At this time, disputes about certain issues led German Catholics to part ways with the Roman Catholic Church. Overall, readers and critics responded positively to Intimacy and Exclusion, citing its fresh perspective on this point in history and well-researched arguments to support her thesis. Herzog provides readers with \"insightful and persuasive reflections,\" wrote English Historical Review contributor Christopher Clark. Others found the book a welcome addition to other literature about this subject. Intimacy and Exclusion is \"an important contribution,\" noted Judith J. Hurwich in a review for the Journal of Interdisciplinary History.\n\nIn 2004, Herzog published her next book, Sexuality and German Fascism, which examines the role of and views toward sexuality in fascist Germany. Herzog served as editor of the volume, pulling together articles from prominent scholars to flesh out the often conflicting images and conceptions associated with sexuality during this time. Contributors include Julia Roos, Stefan Micheler, Patricia Szobar, Birthe Kundrus, Anita Grossman, Erik Jensen, and Geoffrey Giles, and often draw from personal case studies that are often hard to find in other research. Altogether, the essays argue that sexuality was indeed alive and well in Nazi Germany, making the book an interesting counterpoint to many other books written about the subject. Critics cited this as why Sexuality and German Fascism is such a welcome addition to research on this subject. The book is a \"significant departure from the traditional view\" of sexuality in fascist Germany, wrote Andrew Wackerfuss in a review for the German Quarterly.\n\nThe following year, Herzog followed up Sexuality and German Fascism with Sex after Fascism: Memory and Morality in Twentieth-Century Germany. The book in a way picks up where Sexuality and German Fascism left off, dissecting recent scholarship on the history of German sexuality and politics. Drawing from other sources, such as advice literature, sexual surveys, newspaper articles, and the writing of sexologists and medical professionals, she gives context to recent events in German social, political, and cultural history. Herzog's first chapter goes back to material covered in her previous book, giving a recap of sexuality in Nazi Germany; the second chapter focuses on the postwar period from 1945 to 1952, when there was a sharp rise in discussion of sexuality, a kind of sexual liberality. Herzog then covers the mid-1950s and 1960s, which were dominated by a shift toward sexual conservatism. Again, critics responded favorably to Herzog's work, noting its depth of research and well-written arguments. Sex after Fascism is \"brilliant, deeply researched, and beautifully written,\" wrote BookForum Web site contributor Thomas Laqueur. For other critics, it was Herzog's comprehensive look at an important time in history that makes the book a welcome addition. Sex after Fascism provides a \"panoramic sweep of German history,\" stated Jane Slaughter in a review for Labour/Le Travail.\n\nHerzog also edited, along with Gunter Bischof and Anton Pelinka, 2007's Sexuality in Austria, and wrote 2008's Sex in Crisis: The New Sexual Revolution and the Future of American Politics, which focuses on what Herzog believes is a second sexual revolution in the United States.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nAmerican Historical Review, October, 1997, James C.
