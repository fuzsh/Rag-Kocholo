        "text": "Five minutes into our interview, the filmmaker Werner Herzog revealed that he doesn’t like talking about himself, or what drives him.\n\n“My knowledge of myself is limited, and we shouldn’t get too deep into it. I don’t want this to end up like a confessional,” he said via video last month. “I still try to avoid psychological introspection.”\n\nHerzog steers from self-reflection in part by throwing himself into work. He’s made films at an astonishing clip — more than 70 in the past 61 years, by his count.\n\nNow nearly 80, he’s maintaining his prolific streak. During the course of the pandemic, he completed two films and wrote two books, “a memoir of ideas” and, even more surprising, a debut novel titled “The Twilight World,” due out from Penguin Press on June 14.\n\n“The Twilight World” blends elements of memoir, history and fiction to tell the story of Hiroo Onoda, a Japanese intelligence officer who in 1974 emerged from the jungle on an island in the Philippines, wearing a tattered military uniform and carrying a rifle held together with tree bark.\n\nHe had been hiding since 1944, refusing to believe that World War II had ended. When Onoda returned to Japan, he became a celebrity, his story of perseverance eventually inspiring feature films, documentaries and his autobiography.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
