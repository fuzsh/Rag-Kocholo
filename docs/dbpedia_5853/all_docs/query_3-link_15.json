And after an hour of this, it dawned on me that he found it the most fascinating screenplay and wanted to be Aguirre.”\n\n“Absolutely stunning…Mr. Herzog views all the proceedings with fixed detachment. He remains cool. He takes no sides, he may even be slightly amused. Mainly he is a poet who constantly surprises us with unexpected juxtapositions . This is a splendid and haunting work.”\n\n“To see Aguirre for the first time is to discover a genuine masterpiece. It is overwhelming, spellbinding; at first dreamlike, and then hallucinatory.”\n\nNosferatu the Vampyre\n\n[dd-parallax img=”https://jesuitroundup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-2.jpg” height=”800″ speed=”2″ z-index=”2″ position=”center” offset=”true” text-pos=”bottom”]Werner Herzog (Left) and Klaus Kinski (Right) on the set of “Nosferatu the Vampyre” [/dd-parallax]\n\n“One striking quality of the film is its beauty. Herzog’s pictorial eye is not often credited enough. His films always upstage it with their themes. We are focused on what happens, and there are few ‘beauty shots.’ Look at his control of the color palette, his off-center compositions, and the dramatic counterpoint of light and dark. Here is a film that does honor the seriousness of vampires. No, I don’t believe in them. But if they were real, here is how they must look.”\n\nWoyzeck\n\n[dd-parallax img=”https://jesuitroundup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-3.jpg” height=”800″ speed=”2″ z-index=”2″ position=”center” offset=”true” text-pos=”bottom”]Klaus Kinski as Woyzeck in “Woyzeck”[/dd-parallax]\n\nFitzcarraldo\n\n[dd-parallax img=”https://jesuitroundup.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Image-4.jpg” height=”800″ speed=”2″ z-index=”2″ position=”center” offset=”true” text-pos=”bottom”]Klaus Kinski (Fitzcarraldo) standing in front of his boat[/dd-parallax]\n\n“we are always aware both of the film, and of the making of the film” and concluding that “the movie is imperfect, but transcendent.”\n\nCobra Verde\n\n“Herzog does not know that I give life to the dead scenery.”\n\n[dd-parallax img=”Image-5.jpg” height=”800″ speed=”2″ z-index=”2″ position=”center” offset=”true” text-pos=”bottom”] Klaus Kinski (left) talking to Werner Herzog (right) on the set of “Cobra Verde”[/dd-parallax]\n\nMy Best Fiend\n\n[dd-parallax img=”Image-6.jpg” height=”800″ speed=”2″ z-index=”2″ position=”center” offset=”true” text-pos=”bottom”] Klaus Kinski (right) trying to straggle Werner Herzog (right) on the set of “Cobra Verde”[/dd-parallax]\n\nReflection\n\n“People think we had a love-hate relationship. Well, I did not love him, nor did I hate him. We had mutual respect for each other, even as we both planned each other’s murder.”"
