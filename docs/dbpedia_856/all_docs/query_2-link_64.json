        "text": "Organisations in Wales are improving their services for children and young people by involving them in their work, taking their ideas on board, and upholding and promoting their rights under the UNCRC.\n\nHere’s a flavour of some of the excellent work happening across the country.\n\nIf you need help or advice on your organisation’s work with children and young people, please get in touch.\n\nAneurin Bevan\n\nIn April 2019, Aneurin Bevan University Health Board became the first health board to sign up to the Children and Young People’s National Participation Standards Charter, and recently obtained the National Children’s Participation Kitemark, awarded by the First Minister.\n\nThey are exploring opportunities to work with the existing local youth forums across the Health Board area, including the youth group based in the Serennu centre in Newport, and Regional youth forum.\n\nAneurin Bevan has established a Children’s Rights and Participation Forum, and have organised for staff to receive children’s rights training.\n\nAneurin Bevan has also been working to provide a more universal advocacy offer for children and young people in health settings.\n\nSwansea Bay Health Board – BAYouth\n\nBAYouth is Swansea Bay’s youth advisory panel. Previously ABMYouth, the Panel consists of around 20 young people, and was established in 2017.\n\nThe Panel meets monthly, and has lots of success stories to share, including their work on the ’15 steps challenge’, visiting different health settings around the health board area to see what the impression is for young people taking their first 15 steps into that setting.\n\nMembers of the Panel also sit on interview panels to recruit health professionals.\n\nRead about BaYouth’s Case Study here\n\nChildren’s Rights Charter\n\nSwansea Bay University Health Board (Formerly Abertawe Bro Morgannwg) were the first Health Board to develop a Children’s Rights Charter, in 2017. They are now developing a pictorial version of the charter for children and young people with additional needs, working with primary and special schools in the health board area.\n\nSome of Bay Youth’s work includes:\n\nA report on paediatric services at Morriston Hospital\n\nSitting on the interview panel, and having an equal say in the appointments of new members of staff\n\nCalling for and leading to the setup of a helpline for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services.\n\nWork on a paediatrics care poster\n\nA review of the Children’s Rights Charter\n\nCardiff and Vale Health Board\n\nThe health board published a Children’s Rights Charter on Universal Children’s Day 2018.\n\nIt lists the promises the health board makes to all children and young people who use its services, all linked to their rights under the UNCRC.\n\nThey also have an active Youth Board, with 30 young people with a diverse range of backgrounds and experiences.\n\nSome of the work they’ve been involved in includes influencing patient consultation methods, interviewing staff, and improvements to Child and Adolescent Mental Health services.\n\nRead the Cardiff and Vale Health Board Case Study here\n\nBetsi Cadwaladr\n\nBetsi Cadwaladr University Health Board have shared one of the ways they support their children and young people to have a say (Article 12) in Glan Clwyd Hospital.\n\nThis video shows how they use ‘High 5 Low 5’, an opportunity for children to have their voices heard while in hospital. It is a feedback tool used by the Health Board to ensure that all children and young people have a chance to say what they think in an easy and engaging way. By using the ‘High 5 Low 5’ method, the staff know what things they can improve on the ward.\n\nPublic Health Wales\n\nThe national public health agency has produced Young People’s Annual Quality Statements, held its first ever Public Health Youth Summit, and created a new Young Ambassadors programme.\n\nRead the Public Health Wales Case Study here\n\nWelsh Ambulance Services\n\nThe Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust have been looking at their policies around emergency calls, and when paramedics attend to patients.\n\nThe Trust undertook a big engagement exercise in different settings across Wales, which identified ways that young people felt the Trust could improve its interaction with young people.\n\nOne of the issues raised was that the scripts used for answering emergency calls or attending a patient may use words that children and young people might find it hard to understand.\n\nThey held a consultation to come up with alternative words when interacting with children and young people.\n\nThey have committed to a series of promises (co-produced with children), which are aimed at being more responsive to their needs. They’re also working on easy read versions of documents, and the use of pictorial characters in these documents to make them easier to understand for those children and young people with specific learning needs.\n\nHere is a poster that shows a series of those promises:\n\nWAST – Children’s Promises\n\nWAST – Case Study\n\nPowys Teaching Health Board\n\nIn the summer of 2018, Powys Teaching Health Board held joint workshops with the local authority, which included the Regional Partnership Board’s children and young people’s sub-group, Start Well, and the Powys Youth Forum.\n\nThese workshops resulted in a draft ‘Children and Young People’s Pledge’. The young people themselves decided that they preferred the word pledge, rather than charter.\n\nIt is hoped that the Pledge will be published soon.\n\nChildren’s Charter\n\nDeveloped in 2021 the Children’s Charter was a collaboration between Dyfed-Powys Police, Dyfed-Powys Police and Crime Commissioner, Hywel Dda University Health Board and Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service involving over 200 children and young people.\n\nChildren’s Rights Charter\n\nChildren’s Rights Charter – Arabic\n\nChildren’s Rights Charter – Polish\n\nParc Prison\n\nAll young people and staff at Parc Prison are aware of children’s rights under the UNCRC.\n\nYoung people learn about their rights and are encouraged to have their say on matters that affect them. Staff are expected to refer to children’s rights at relevant opportunities.\n\nStaff at Parc feel that a rights-based approach has benefited both the young people and themselves.\n\nRead the Parc Prison Case Study here\n\nHillside\n\nHillside is a Secure Children’s Home located in the town of Neath Port Talbot, in Wales. Read this case study to learn how young people have a say within this secure setting:\n\nHillside Case Study\n\nSouth Wales Police\n\nWe’ve delivered a training session with South Wales Police’s Gold command: its senior police leaders.\n\nThey have committed to embedding a Children’s Rights Approach in their work, and have developed a children’s rights charter, with the support of young people from Pentrehafod school and Hillside Secure Unit. The charter shows how they’ll uphold and promote their human rights.\n\nWe’re also working with them to develop their participation strategy.\n\nHere is a poster of the children’s rights charter –\n\nChildren’s Rights Poster\n\nSWP have also created a video that shows the 7 rights young people have when they come in contact with the police, including when they have been a victim of a crime or accused of breaking the law.\n\nOfficers, staff and volunteers are all expected to abide by the charter’s promises whenever they come into contact with young people.\n\nHere is a link to the Children’s Charter Launch video –\n\nChildren’s Charter Launch Video\n\nGwynedd and Anglesey Youth Justice Service\n\nGwynedd and Anglesey Youth Justice Service have been embedding children and young people’s rights into all aspects of their work.

It also captures the commitments the children made to help look after nature and the world around them.\n\nThe Children’s Rights Charter shows how NRW will uphold and promote children’s rights in our work and deliver better services for children and young people in Wales.\n\nChildren’s Rights Charter – A4 Poster Bilingual\n\nSport Wales\n\nSports Wales have been embedding children and young people’s rights into all aspects of their work. To know how they have embedded the 5 principles in their work, click on the link below:\n\nRead Sports Wales Case Study here\n\nMonmouthshire Children’s Services Participation Strategy for Children and Young People\n\nThis Participation Strategy from Monmouthshire’s Children’s Services is an excellent example of how services are embedding the principle of participation into their ways of working. We have chosen to share this best case example as it;\n\nHas a bold commitment to rights;\n\nPlans to strategically embed children’s views into all elements of children’s services – planning, policies, commissioning, reviewing;\n\nAims to be collaborative, for children to be valued, respected and in control;\n\nIt reflects on the different degrees of participation and the many ways in which children can be included and asked for views – no ‘one size fits all approach’\n\nFocuses on the importance of children being informed;\n\nSets out a strong message that all children should know how their views can affect decisions about their life and services.\n\nWe plan to stay in touch with Monmouthshire, to learn about how this strategy has been put into practice. We’ll be keen to find out what difference this has made to children and young people’s experiences of services.\n\nMonmouthshire Children’s Services Participation Strategy for Children and Young People"
