        "text": "The Healthy Child Wales Programme for children aged 0 to 7 years old was launched in 2016.\n\nPart 2 of Healthy Child Wales, the operating model, sets out the planned contacts children, young people and their families can expect from their health boards, commencing at school entry (5 years old) through to the final year of compulsory schooling in Wales (16 years old).\n\nThese universal contacts cover 3 areas of intervention:\n\nscreening\n\nimmunisation\n\nmonitoring and supporting child health and development\n\nThe new national operating model is needed to underpin the existing school nursing frameworks (part 1 2017 and part 2 2018) to clearly define the school nursing services provided by NHS Wales.\n\nThe operating model for school aged children in Wales, forming part of the Healthy Child Wales Programme, will be delivered by school nursing services within NHS Wales. School nursing services in Wales are professionally led by senior nurses with a post graduate specialist community public health nurse qualification in school nursing.\n\nThere are a range of nursing roles delivering school nursing services in Wales, regardless of setting. The qualifications, skill set and expertise of the nurses defines which children and young people they work with. For example, nurses with a specialist post graduate qualification in community public health (school nursing) deliver services for mainstream schools and children and young people educated other at school.\n\nWhilst in contrast, a range of children’s nurses work in special schools and there is not a single defined special school nurse role in Wales. Due to the size and scale of the work required, workforce has been identified as a key implementation workstream of the operating model, with the clear aim of working towards greater consistency across Wales over the duration of the implementation period.\n\nWithin the new operating model the nursing roles which typically make up school nursing services in Wales are described as follows.\n\nSpecialist community public health nurse (school nursing)\n\nSpecialist community public health nurses (school nursing) are professionals at the frontline of public health. They are independent practitioners who are committed to improving children and young people’s health and wellbeing. Due to their post graduate learning and experience, they have expertise in relation to understanding the wider determinants of health and tackling health inequalities across the diverse communities they support. They are uniquely linked to a specific secondary school and the cluster primary schools. They work in partnership with schools, communities and families across three levels of support, according to:\n\nneed to prevent ill health\n\nprotect health\n\npromote wellbeing\n\nRegistered nurse (school nursing)\n\nThe registered nurse (school nursing) has delegated responsibility to support the universal and enhanced offer to prevent ill health, protect health and promote wellbeing. The nurse works both alone and as part of a team with confidence to make decisions without supervision. The role includes identifying the health needs of school-aged children, through an ongoing programme of:\n\nhealth surveillance\n\nassessment\n\nmonitoring\n\nreferral\n\ninterventions\n\nworking effectively with children, their families and parents/carers\n\nUnregistered workforce (school nursing)\n\nThe unregistered workforce (school nursing), works in a variety of community settings to provide both clerical and clinical support to deliver services, involving direct contact with school-aged children under the direction of the specialist community public health nurse (school nursing) and other members of the service.\n\nCommunity children’s nurses and nurses in special schools\n\nIn addition to the nursing roles described above, which predominantly cover the universal elements of the operating model, there are also a range of key nursing roles which support children and young people with complex healthcare needs. The roles are unique in the level of co-ordination and connectivity provided between the team around the child and wider professionals and services. These nurses support the school to safely manage the child’s health and wellbeing needs, so that learning opportunities are optimised, and the child or young person is included in school activities.\n\nThrough the delivery of the new operating model, school nursing services are committed to fulfilling their duties as part of the wider NHS Wales obligation to follow key legislation and drivers in Wales.\n\nA healthier Wales is the long-term plan for health and social care in Wales.\n\nThe Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act (2015) came into force in April 2016 and seeks to improve the social, economic, environmental and cultural wellbeing of Wales. NHS Wales along with other public bodies are required to:\n\nthink more about the long-term\n\nwork better with people, communities and each other\n\nlook to prevent problems\n\ntake a more joined-up approach\n\nChildren and young people are central to the legislation and school nursing services will ensure the ways of working are embedded in the delivery of the new operating model.\n\nThe Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act (2014) provides the legal framework for transforming social services in Wales. The Act has integration at its heart and has implications for the Welsh NHS and the way in which services are delivered by school nursing services.\n\nThe United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) is the basis for all Welsh Government work with children and young people, with the 7 core aims for developing policy for children and young people. The Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure 2011, imposes a duty on Welsh Ministers to have regard to children’s rights set out in the UNCRC. The Children’s Rights Scheme 2014 sets out the arrangements for Welsh Ministers to comply with the duty to have due regard to children’s rights when exercising any functions.\n\nThe standards have been ratified by the Welsh Government and are underpinned by the UNCRC and the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act (2015), that puts the involvement of children at the heart of improving their wellbeing. The standards have been adapted to make them more accessible for disabled children and young people under the name of \"having a voice, having a choice\".\n\nThe Duty of Quality is a legal responsibility that requires Welsh Ministers and the NHS to think about how their decisions will improve health care in the future. It also requires them to talk to the public openly and with transparency about the quality of health care. School nursing services are committed to following the Duty of Quality and will ensure it is considered in all their processes and systems, and when making decisions regarding services for children and young people.\n\nThe Additional Learning Needs and Educational Tribunal (Wales) Act (2018) makes provision for a new statutory framework for supporting children and young people with additional learning needs. A unified legislative framework to support all children of compulsory school age or below with additional learning needs.\n\nIn line with the Nurse Staffing Levels (Wales) Act (2016), health boards have a legal duty to regard the importance of ensuring appropriate levels of nurse staffing in all settings.\n\nAdditionally, the Strategic Equality Plan 2020 to 2024, the Anti-racist Wales Action Plan, More than just words 2022 to 2027 and the LGBTQ+ Action Plan will be used by school nursing services when delivering the operating model to embed meaningful changes and values as part of Welsh life. The Anti-racist Wales Action Plan must be used to deliver demonstrable school nursing leadership at all levels, to meet existing commitments to challenge systemic and institutional racism and in the provision of equitable, culturally appropriate services, recognising intersectionality and differences among groups.\n\nMore than just words 2022 to 2027 will strengthen Welsh language provision in health and social care, and school nursing services will support Welsh speakers to receive care in their first language.\n\nThe LGBTQ+ Action Plan, developed with the aim of making Wales the most LGBTQ+ friendly nation in Europe, sets out healthcare, social care and welfare actions NHS Wales must deliver against, and school nursing services will deliver their part accordingly.\n\nThe new unified operating model will be offered to all school aged children regardless of setting. In practice this means that the health and development offer in special and mainstream schools will also be offered to children and families who opt to educate at home, or who are educated in a location other than at school. It will be delivered through a variety of methods including digital channels and signposting children and young people to the right service to meet their needs and circumstances. This will require partnership working with other parts of NHS Wales and local authority partners, underlining the importance of a team around the family approach to public health and development.\n\nAs part of the commitment to providing services to support children and young people throughout the school age, an important aspect of the role of school nursing services is provision in the community and multi-agency working with local authorities and other public service partners and the third sector. The aim of this community outreach is to meet children and young people in the communities in which they live and raise the profile of school nursing services. Examples include multi-agency community engagement events and community drop-in sessions.\n\nTo support the implementation of the new operating model, NHS Wales and Welsh Government have agreed a 2 year implementation period commencing in April 2024. This will give each health board time to take account of the requirements and different approaches currently across Wales and then implement fully. At the end of the 2 year period in April 2026, Welsh Government and NHS Wales will conduct an implementation review.\n\nSchool nursing services will prioritise the following implementation workstreams.\n\nWorkforce and training\n\nThis includes looking at the nurse staffing level implications longer term and the 5 levels of care approach, as well as exploring opportunities for:\n\nconsistent job descriptions\n\nworkforce re-design to meet changing case-mix needs\n\nskill mix within teams\n\nlearning and development needs\n\nMonitoring framework\n\nThe development of a proportionate monitoring framework to measure the impact and quality of the new operating model. This will include support from experts in knowledge and analysis to define clear outputs and outcomes for school nursing services in Wales.\n\nDigital and data\n\nAcross Wales there is still an over reliance on paper records. As a result, there is an urgent need to establish a digital and data workstream led by heads of school nursing services. This will drive forward transformation and will influence the wider digital and data agenda in NHS Wales to ensure digital services for children and young people, including school nursing are prioritised. Patient safety and quality improvement is central to this workstream to make sure that school nursing services are able monitor and measure the impact of their services and the outcomes for children and young people in Wales.\n\nCommunication and engagement\n\nThis workstream will be focused on maximising opportunities for promoting a vibrant and modern school nursing service for Wales. The first task for this workstream will be to produce an innovative communications and engagement plan, aimed at using digital channels to raise the profile of school nursing services.\n\nTeam around the child is a phrase which is used to describe a preventative approach undertaken by public service professionals, often in a multi-agency context, to support a child or young person with their needs.\n\nIn the context of the operating model, this refers to their health and wellbeing needs. A team around the child is a virtual multi-agency team made up of the child / young person, family and professionals who know the child best. For children and young people with complex health needs who require an enhanced or intensive tier of support, they will form a core team, working together, to meet the child’s individualised needs. There is longstanding evidence which supports the effectiveness of this approach for children and young people, especially for those with complex health needs.\n\nWithin this operating model, we are focussing specifically on a school-based team around the child approach. When the school nursing services representative undertakes a care co-ordinating role (already set out in part 2 school nursing framework: nursing in special schools), they will engage a mix of professionals drawn from the following areas, as required:\n\nallied health professionals and therapists, such as physiotherapists or occupational therapists\n\npaediatricians\n\ngeneral practitioners and primary care practitioners, such as practice nurses\n\nlearning disability or emotional mental health team and/or nurses\n\nteacher/school representatives\n\nearly help practitioners\n\nsecondary care and tertiary care practitioners, such as hospital doctors or specialist nurses\n\nother multi-agency representatives as appropriate"
