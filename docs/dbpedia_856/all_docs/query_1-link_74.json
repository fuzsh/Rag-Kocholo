        "text": "Your child will usually need to spend some time in hospital during their treatment.\n\nAll children and young people diagnosed with cancer are treated in one of the 21 specialist hospital centres across the UK and Ireland. If the doctor at your local hospital thinks that your child has cancer, they are likely to send your child to one of these Principal Treatment Centres.\n\nSpecialist centres in childhood cancer (Principal Treatment Centres)\n\nOften, some of the treatment which your child receives can be given at your local hospital under the guidance of the nearest specialist centre. This allows your child to be treated closer to home and, more importantly, gives better access to local community support services.\n\nThis is called 'shared care' and the local hospitals are known as Paediatric Oncology Shared Care Units (POSCU).\n\nShared care centres\n\nMany different hospital staff will be involved in your child’s care and at first meeting all the staff may seem overwhelming.\n\nMeet the hospital staff\n\nA team of specialists will plan the treatment they feel is best for your child’s condition.\n\nThe multidisciplinary team (MDT)\n\nChildren’s wards are relaxed and friendly places that give you and your child as positive an experience as possible. You’re likely to get to know the staff well."
