        "text": "Children in care need specific types of beds as well as seating, to help them get quality sleep and assist their recovery if they are in intensive care.\n\nOur work with children’s hospitals such as GOSH (Great Ormond Street Hospital) has brought us into the realm of paediatric care, and we would like to share our experience in finding suitable beds for children and adolescents.\n\nTypes of Paediatric Beds\n\nA paediatric bed is specially designed for the care of children and adolescents in healthcare settings, such as hospitals and clinics. Under this broad heading, there are some key distinctions we would like to point out to clarify the different types available.\n\nStandard Paediatric Bed\n\nStandard paediatric beds cover the main requirements for a childcare bed, with strong safety features such as height adjustment and side rails, adjustable head & footboard sections, and child-friendly colours and designs.\n\nThe height adjustment helps carers access the child at the right height, and assists with transferring them on and off the bed.\n\nColourful and themed designs, like Captain Marvel or Disney, make the child feel at home and reduce overall stress levels. Or how about inbuilt sound systems and screens? Specialist children’s hospitals like GOSH theme the child’s room and give them digital access to their favourite movies and games, to give them the best care experience possible.\n\nCrib-Style Paediatric Bed\n\nThese are designed to ensure maximum patient safety with higher sides, creating a more enclosed, ‘crib’ style environment. For young infants and toddlers this creates a calmer, more reassuring environment. The mattress is normally height-adjustable to enable carer-to-patient access, and they often have mesh sides so the child can interact with people around them as well as feeling safe.\n\nPaediatric Intensive Care Unit Bed (PICU)\n\nThe clue being in the name, these are built specifically for use in hospital intensive care units (ICUs). The Paediatric ICU area in a hospital provides close monitoring and 24hr care for critically ill children and adolescents.\n\nAdvanced features on these beds include vital signs monitoring equipment, weigh scales, IV pole and pump holders, and they are designed to accommodate medical procedures like CPR.\n\nTransportable Paediatric Bed\n\nSmaller and lightweight, these are designed for easy movement between hospital wards or healthcare facilities. This is particularly useful if the child is moved around the hospital for different procedures e.g. tests or infusion therapy.\n\nSide rails and harnesses are important features to protect the child during transit. These beds are made from durable materials that are robust and easy to clean.\n\nExamples of Different Paediatric Beds\n\nThe following list is a randomised selection of paediatric beds available on the UK market. They are diverse enough to illustrate the different types of beds covered above, and show the pros and cons of each.\n\nAs standard, all beds meet the medical bed standards for children (BN EN 50637), covered in more detail in this article.\n\nLisclare Junior Bed (Standard Paediatric)\n\nPros Cons\n\nWider range of padded accessories\n\nLimited range of features\n\nEasy click-in side rails\n\nLacks specialisation for specific medical conditions\n\nVersatile, can accommodate a wide range of patients in community care settings\n\nCubCare Paediatric Bed (PICU)\n\nPros Cons\n\nIt is fully BS EN 50637:2017 compliant.\n\nHeavy\n\nHighly adjustable, and dynamic lengthening feature allows it to grow with the child\n\nTransparent and adjustable Perspex sides for increased child interaction, visibility and monitoring\n\nIntegrates advanced functional and technological features such as weigh scales and a touch screen display\n\nCustomisable positioning for pressure relief, body alignment and child activities\n\nKinderkey Junior Care Bed (Transportable Paediatric)\n\nPros Cons\n\nSmall wheeled bed, easy to move between locations\n\nLacks advanced features like anti-trendelenburg and length adjustment\n\nCompact design, good for small spaces\n\nEasy clean platform\n\nAccora JuniorBed (Standard Paediatric)\n\nPros Cons\n\nGoes down to floor level\n\nNo side rails as standard\n\nPadded head and footboard bumpers\n\nMobile\n\nSmooth, minimalist styling — no sharp edges or parts\n\nLinet Tom 2 (Crib-Style Paediatric)\n\nPros Cons\n\nEnclosed sides prevent falls\n\nDoesn’t grow with the child\n\nCheerful modern design\n\nComfortable mattress and bedding, creating a cosy and reassuring environment\n\nTelescopic sides and height adjustment enable easy patient access\n\nElectronic locking key for extra security\n\nWhat Type of Paediatric Bed Do I Need?\n\nThe Linet Tom 2 is ideal for small infants as it is enclosed, with extra safety features, making it a good option for PICU environments.\n\nSmall infants 0-5 years are generally well catered for, but there is a lack of suitably sized beds in the 5-15 year bracket. This is where the CubCare fits perfectly, with dynamic length adjustment to suit children within this age range, with average heights of 100-170cm.\n\nConclusion\n\nStandard paediatric beds are versatile, but may lack specialised features that are crucial for care of children with specific medical conditions in intensive care environments.\n\nAs standard, all beds should comply with the medical bed standards for children, BS EN 50637, to ensure patient safety.\n\nWhen purchasing paediatric beds, close attention should be paid to the adjustability of the bed so it can be used for a wider age range, such as the CubCare bed, which adjusts from 160 to 200cm long.\n\nFor more advice or to arrange a demonstration of our CubCare bed, please contact our Acute Sales Team."
