Any discounts, donations, or promotions we receive from suppliers or sponsorships reflect the total cost. Due to variations in market prices, the total cost of a Medical Gaming Cart may fluctuate. The price does not include delivery and VAT.\n\nXbox Series S – Medical Gaming Cart – £2170.00 + VAT + Delivery\n\nNintendo Switch Medical Gaming Cart – £2170.00 + VAT + Delivery\n\nIf we receive a Purchase Order or payment for a Gaming Cart without reference to a valid quotation, we cannot accept your order. To request a quotation, please contact us.\n\nAre you a staff member at a hospital/hospice/charity who would like to purchase a Cart for your hospital?\n\nIf you want a fully detailed and transparent quotation, please complete the Contact Form. Be sure to include the type of Gaming Cart(s), how many there are and the hospital’s location, as this will give accurate delivery costs.\n\nFor more information on the ordering process and how to source the funds, please continue reading.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nWe encourage all individuals, groups, wards and hospitals to fundraise for TheRockinR. You can fundraise for a Gaming Cart, TheRockinR Revamp Service or help us support and maintain existing Medical Gaming Carts (theft and breakages are extremely common in the medical environment).\n\nYou could start a GoFundMe, Just Giving campaign, or a simplistic collection. You can fundraise in any way you’d like; our only rule is that you have fun doing it! Give us a shout if you need any fundraising supplies; we’re always happy to help in any way we can.\n\nPlease let us know if you plan to or are actively fundraising for TheRockinR. Pictures and updates are always massively appreciated, and with your consent, we would love to share them on our Socials!\n\nAfter completing the required target and obtaining a valid quotation, we can supply the Gaming Cart or TheRockinR Revamp to your hospital/ward of choice. Any funds raised to support and maintain existing Medical Gaming Carts for hospitals will go directly to hospitals requiring replacement controllers or monitors.\n\nFor more information on fundraising, please visit our Donate page.\n\nIf you need further information or require a detailed and transparent quotation for your hospital of choice, please fill out our Contact Form, and we will get back to you as soon as possible.\n\nThank you so much for your interest in supporting TheRockinR!"
