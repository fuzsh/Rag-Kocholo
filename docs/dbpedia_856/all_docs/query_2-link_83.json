        "text": "SC4C is evaluating an integrated model of care, with paediatricians working directly with GPs in their practices to bring the best possible close-to-home care to children and their families. The GP-led intervention consists of paediatricians working in co-consultation with GPs, providing case based education and being available by phone and mail support.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, following a similar 12 month-long integrated GP-paediatrician intervention, a 39% reduction in new patient hospital appointments, a 19% reduction in speciality referrals, and a 22% reduction in ED attendances 12 months was reported. Pilot data from this same model of care implemented in Victoria demonstrated a 5% decrease in OP referrals and most importantly a 16% increase in parental confidence in GP care and satisfaction in the care they received. The SC4C study is supported by an NHMRC partnership grant, with 21 participating GP practices across Central and Eastern Sydney PHN and North West Melbourne PHN regions.\n\nFollowing on from the SC4C study, our group has been successfully awarded two further grants to expand this idea beyond metropolitan areas."
