        "text": "Welcome to the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children\n\nThe Bristol Royal Hospital for Children (BRHC) provides a local service for Bristol children and a referral service for specialist care for families across the South West and nationally. You can view our trust map here\n\nMain reception: 0117 342 8460 - Monday to Friday, 8am to 4pm only\n\nTrust switchboard: 0117 923 0000\n\nIf you're looking for information on the children's emergency department click here\n\nThe current building opened on 22 April 2001 and was the first purpose-built children's hospital in the South West. In April 2007, a further ward was opened to accommodate children's services from Southmead, and in May 2015 two specialist hospital services for children moved from Frenchay Hospital to create one centre of excellence in Bristol.\n\nThese pages are designed to provide you with useful information to help you during your stay with us.\n\nYou might find it useful to view this document if your child has been referred to Bristol Royal Hospital for Children.\n\nIf you have questions, please contact the Family Information Room on 0117 342 8065 or email bchinfo@UHBW.nhs.uk\n\nWe are proud to offer patients and families opportunities to take part in research. We may discuss research studies with you whilst you, or your child is, under our care. For more information on taking part in research please speak to your clinical team.\n\nIf you require the services of an interpreter during a hospital visit, the Trust has a team of interpreters whose services we can call upon. Depending on the circumstances, staff may also use a telephone interpreting service as an alternative.\n\nVisit our interactive website designed for young patients between the ages of 8-12. You'll find lots of information about what happens at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, and some fun activities too.\n\nLooking to support us? Find out more about our charities here.\n\nTrust switchboard - 0117 923 0000\n\nMain reception: 0117 342 8460 - Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm only\n\nWe know that bringing your child to hospital can be a difficult time. All of our staff will offer their help and support to make it as easy as possible. Please read on for more information about the facilities for parents and visitors.\n\nIf you cannot find what you are looking for, please contact the Family Information Room on 0117 342 8065\n\nAccommodation\n\nEach of our hospital beds has a drop down bed for one parent to stay overnight with the exception of the intensive care unit and our short stay surgery ward. We have limited family accommodation but are happy to provide advice regarding hotels and guest houses in the local area.\n\nTransport and parking\n\nCar parking within the hospital precinct has been affected by the current building work. There is some parking outside of the children's hospital, though this is very limited. The closest hospital pay and display spaces are at the Bristol Haematology & Oncology Centre and St Michael's Hospital. Parking permits to reduce the cost are available for families staying overnight. There are roadside parking meters and Trenchard Street NCP is also close to the main entrance. Families parking at Cabot Circus can catch a free shuttle bus during normal hours. Please take care when parking as all spaces are patrolled regularly. If you have any queries or concerns about parking, please contact the LIAISE team on 0117 342 8065 or 0117 342 8158 or email BCHInfo@uhbw.nhs.uk\n\nFamilies receiving an income related benefit may be able to claim back some of their costs. Please ask the ward for details.\n\nFood\n\nFood for patients is provided and there are legal restrictions on bringing in food for patients. Please see the food folder at every bedside for more information.\n\nFood for parents can be obtained from the Brewnel's, close to the main entrance to Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, open Monday-Friday, 7am-6pm and Saturday and Sunday, 9am-4pm.\n\nEach long stay ward also has access to a parent's kitchen where parents are welcome to prepare their own food. Hot drinks are generally not allowed on the wards for your child's safety.\n\nFacilities for parents\n\nEach long stay ward has access to a shower room and toilet for parents to use. Linen is also provided for drop down beds. Please ask ward staff to show you the facilities on your ward.\n\nVisiting\n\nParents and carers are welcome to stay with their child for as long as they wish, although we ask for one adult only between 8pm and 8am, except in exceptional circumstances. Other visitors are welcome but we ask for no more than two per bed at any time. If you wish to bring siblings to visit, please discuss this first with your named nurse.\n\nSupport services\n\nThere are a range of services which will support the clinical care of your child and also services which will help support you with the experience of being in hospital.
