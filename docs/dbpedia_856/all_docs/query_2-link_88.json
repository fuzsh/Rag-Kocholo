        "text": "Referrals to Emotional Wellbeing & Mental Health are assessed and triaged by clinicians in the Single Point of Access (SPOA).\n\nThere are two main elements to the function of the SPOA:\n\nReferral processing, triage and making recommendations or signposting\n\nConsultation for professionals, including contacting families for more information\n\nPlease be aware that some referrals into the Single Point of Access may not require a mental health intervention, as there is low risk and the patient’s needs can be met by existing alternative services.\n\nIn such cases, the referrer will be advised to recommend other options to the young person as a starting point.\n\nWhat to consider before making a referral\n\nReferral to Emotional Wellbeing & Mental Health is not always necessary to support a child or young person’s mental health. Referrals to another service, such as the local early help service, or the support available through schools may be more suited to meeting a child or young person’s needs.\n\nWe recommend that as a first step, referrers:\n\nEncourage families to access local services through their local early help service\n\nEncourage young people to engage with any support available in their school\n\nEncourage young people aged over 16 years to access Silvercloud\n\nIf these have not been done, there is a chance that the referral will be redirected and the family recommended to act on one or more of these as a first step\n\nIf you are uncertain about the need for a mental health assessment for a particular child or young person, you can call the Single Point of Access for a consultation. This will help us to fully understand the situation and work with you to formulate a plan for the child or young person. In some cases, we will be able to accept this as a referral to our services.\n\nPlease note, you can contact the SPOA team to discuss a child or young person without identifying them. However, in this case we would only be able to offer general advice due to not being able to look at the individual’s record.\n\nWhat to include in a referral to Emotional Wellbeing & Mental Health\n\nProviding a detailed referral will help the clinical SPOA team to decide the most appropriate pathway to meet the child or young person’s needs.\n\nIf insufficient information is provided, the referral will not be accepted until the SPOA team have sufficient information with which to make a decision. The SPOA team will contact you and possibly the family for more information.\n\nIt is essential that all referrers confirm the patient’s address and contact details when they meet with them, regardless of how long you have known them. We rely on these details to contact the family and a significant amount of administrative time is wasted contacting referrers to find up to date information.\n\nNot confirming the correct contact details may delay referral processing, triage and the booking of the young person’s appointment (if relevant).\n\nWe recommend that referrers include the following information in their referrals to Emotional Wellbeing & Mental Health:\n\nHow do I make a referral to Emotional Wellbeing & Mental Health\n\nFrom November 2021, we will only accept referrals electronically (via email, web form or WAP) or over the telephone. Please do not send letters or referral forms to us in the post.\n\nGPs can complete an e-referral via WCCG.\n\nC&V UHB colleagues working in the community (e.g. health visitors) are recommended to email childrensspoa.cav@wales.nhs.uk with a case note number as evidence for a referral.\n\nIf you are uncertain about the need for a mental health assessment for a particular child or young person, you can call the Single Point of Access for a consultation. This will help us to fully understand the situation and work with you to formulate a plan for the child or young person. In some cases, we will be able to accept this as a referral to our services.\n\nHow to make a crisis referral"
