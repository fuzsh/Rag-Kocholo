Malay English Vietnamese Chinese anh huynh brother ñeä em muoäi sadara sister chò tyû To distinguish the given words, their one or more prominent semantic features must be considered with care: • Sadara has one prominent semantic feature: [+born by the same parents]. • Brother and sister share their two prominent semantic features: [+born by the same parents] and [±male]. • Anh and chò share their three prominent semantic features: [+born by the same parents], [±male] and [+older] while em is marked by its two prominent semantic features: [+born by the same parents] and [+younger]. That is, to the Vietnamese people, it is unnecessary to distinguish the sex of younger siblings though it is a must whenever they deal with their older siblings.\n\n5. 181 • Huynh, ñeä, tyû and muoäi all share their three prominent semantic features: [+born by the same parents], [±male] and [±older]. Exercise 4: Organise the given words (and probably those of your own) into three semantic fields: shirts, end, short, forward(s), long, hats, lend, coats, shorts, beginning, trousers, amble, out, limp, tiptoe, plod, socks, trudge, borrow, stomp, in, stump, backward(s), and tramp. ANSWER: (1) Articles of clothing: shirts, socks, hats, coats, shorts, trousers, etc. (2) Ways of walking3 : amble, limp, tiptoe, plod, trudge, stomp, stump, tramp, etc. 3 Amble = ride or walk at a slow, leisurely pace: He came ambling down the road. Limp = walk unevenly, as when one foot or leg is hurt or stiff: That dog must be hurt — he’s limping. Plod (along/on) = walk with heavy steps or with difficulty: Labourers plodded home through the muddy fields. Tiptoe = walk quietly and carefully on the tips of one’s toes/with one’s heels not touching the ground: She tiptoed to the bed where the child lay asleep. Trudge = walk slowly or with difficulty because one is tired, on a long journey, etc.: He trudged along for more than 2 miles. Stump = walk stiffly or noisily: They stumped up the hill. He stumped out in fury. Stomp (about, around, off, etc.) = move, dance, or walk with a heavy step (in a specified direction): She stomped about noisily. Tramp = walk with heavy or noisy steps: We could hear him tramping about upstairs. “Stomp, stump, plod, trudge, and tramp all indicate styles of walking with heavy steps. Stomp and stump can both suggest making noise while walking in order to show anger: She slammed the door and stomped/stumped upstairs. Additionally, stump can indicate walking with stiffs legs: stumping up the garden path. Stomp can suggest clumsy and noisy walking or dancing: He looked funny stomping around the dance floor.

Exercise 21: Explain the lexical ambiguity in each of the two given sentences. Does polysemy or homonymy contribute to such ambiguity. (1) She cannot bear children. (2) The cat sat on the mat. We can interpret (1) in two different ways because the two verbs bear — bear1, which means givebirthto and bear2, whish means tolerate — are two homonyms. We can interpret (2) in two different ways because the noun mat is a polysemous word which has two slightly different but closely related meanings: (i) piece of material, made of straw, fibre, rushes, etc. used to cover part of a floor; (ii) small piece of material placed under a hot dish, a glass, a vase, etc. Exercise 22: In what way are homonyms related to lexical ambiguity? Homonyms can create lexical ambiguity. She cannot bear children, for example, is lexically ambiguous because the sentence contains one ambiguous word — bear. The sentence may mean either she is unable to give birth to children or she cannot tolerate children. The lexical ambiguity of the sentence in question is due to the two homonyms, bear1 and bear2, with two quite different meanings. Exercise 23: In what way is a polysemous word related to lexical ambiguity? A polysemous word can create lexical ambiguity. That robot is bright, for example, is lexically ambiguous because it contains one ambiguous word — bright. The sentence may mean either that robot is shining or that robot is intelligent.\n\n25. 201 The lexical ambiguity of the sentence in question is due to the two slightly different but closely related meanings of the polysemous word bright — shining and intelligent.

This sentence is semantically anomalous because both my unmarried sister and a bachelor are [+single], and thus they can’t be husband and wife. 7. The bigger key and John opened the door. This sentence is semantically anomalous because its instrument (the bigger key) cannot be conjoined with its agent (John). 8. James sliced the ideas. This sentence is semantically anomalous because the ideas are [+abstract notion] while only concrete things that are long, round, and soft enough like a sausage or a tomato can be sliced. 9. Jack’s courage chewed the bones. This sentence is semantically anomalous because Jack’s courage is [+abstract notion], and thus it could not chew anything.\n\n29. 205 10. I hear the cloud. This sentence is semantically anomalous because “hear, presumably, presupposes that its object is audible” [Palmer, 1981: 170] while the cloud is [− − − − audible]. 11. The tiger remained alive for an hour after the hunter killed it. This sentence is semantically anomalous because no living organism can remain alive after being killed. In fact, the tiger died right at the moment the hunter killed it. Exercise 26: How can each of the given sentences be changed to avoid anomaly? 1. Christopher is killing himself. 2. My brother is a bachelor. 3. The boy chewed the chocolate and then swallowed it. 4. This crane can lift one ton. 5. Puppies are not human. 6. My unmarried sister will be married to a bachelor. 7.

I hear the piece of news already / I see the cloud. 11. The tiger remained alive for an hour after the hunter injured it.\n\n30. 206 Exercise 27: Do the two following sentences have the same proposition? (1) Mr Dindlay killed Janet. (2) Mr Dindlay caused Janet to die. No, they don’t. Killed somebody in (1) implies [+intentionally] whereas caused somebody to die in (2) implies [+accidentally]. The semantic feature [±intention] is crucial in distinguishing the different propositions in (1-2). Exercise 28: Explain why the two members of each of the following pairs of sentences do not share the same proposition. 1(a) John is the parent of James. 1(b) James is the parent of John. 3(a) The fly was on the wall. 3(b) The wall was under the fly. 2(a) The hunter bit the lion. 2(b) The lion bit the hunter. 4(a) Jack was injured by a stone. 4(b) Jack was injured with a stone. ANSWER: The two pairs of sentences marked 1(a-b) and 2(a-b) are not related to each other. In other words, they indicate different states of affairs: 1(a) tells us about John, 1(b) tells us about James, 2(a) tells us about the hunter, and 2(b) tells us about the lion. The pair of sentences marked 3(a-b) expresses different propositions. On the one hand, the preposition on in 3(a) indicates that the fly was in a position that allows it to touch the wall. On the other hand, the preposition under in 3(b) indicates that though the wall was in a position directly below the fly, there was no touching between them. The semantic feature [±touching] is crucial in distinguishing different propositions in 3(a-b). The preposition by in 4(a) tells us that a stone fell and accidentally injured Jack whereas the preposition with in 4(b) implies that somebody intentionally used a stone as a means to injure Jack. The semantic feature [±intention] is crucial in distinguishing different propositions in 4(a-b).\n\n31. 207 Exercise 29: Fill in the following chart given by Hurford and Heasley [1984: 23] with ‘+’ or ‘–’ as appropriate. Thus, for example, if it makes sense to think of a proposition being in a particular regional accent, put a ‘+’ in the appropriate box; if not put a ‘–.’ Utterances Sentences Propositions Can be loud or quiet + – – Can be grammatical or not + + – Can be true or false + + + In a particular regional accent + – – In a particular language + + – Exercise 30: Circle the following sentences A for analytic, S for synthetic or C for contradiction, as appropriate. 1.

Exercise 42: Use the locution, illocution, and perlocution analysis to analyse the underlined utterance in each of the following dialogues.\n\n49. 225 (1) Mrs Smith’s neighbour: ‘I was so sorry to hear about your loss.’ Mrs Smith: ‘Thank you. It was a great shock, but I must get used to it.’ Locution: Mrs Smith’s neighbour uttered the words ‘I was so sorry to hear about your loss’, which can be semantically paraphrased as ‘You have my great sympathy’, with I referring to the neighbour. Illocution: The neighbour performed the act of condoling. Perlocution: Mrs Smith, who is a recently bereaved widow and who expects the neighbour’s utterance, gives a prepared reply: ‘Thank you. It was a great shock, but I must get used to it.’ (2) A: ‘Would you like a cup of coffee?’ B: ‘Yes, please.’ Locution: A uttered the words ‘Would you like a cup of coffee’, which can be semantically paraphrased as ‘Have a cup of coffee, please’, with you referring to B. Illocution: A performed the act of offering. Perlocution: The utterance may cause B, who is the hearer, to think the speaker, who is A, is more generous than he/she thought. (3) Son: ‘Can I go out for a while, Mum?’ Mother: ‘You can play outside for half an hour.’ Locution: The mother uttered the words ‘You can play outside for half an hour’, which can be semantically paraphrased as ‘You have my permission to go out for a while’, with you referring to the son. Illocution: The mother performed the act of giving permission. Perlocution: The utterance may cause the son to race out of the room, picking up his football on the way. Exercise 43: Are the following utterances performative (P) or constative (C)? 1. P; 2. C; 3. P; 4. C; 5. P; 6. C; 7. P; 8. C; 9. P; 10. P\n\n50. 226 Exercise 44: Also note that the most reliable test to determine whether an utterance is performative is to insert the word hereby and see if the modified utterance is acceptable. Can hereby be acceptably inserted in the following utterances? 1.Yes; 2. No; 3. No; 4. Yes; 5. Yes; 6. No; 7. Yes; 8. No; 9. Yes; 10. No Exercise 45: Fill in each of the blanks with an appropriate word. The first one is done as an example. 1. Semantics 11. Anomaly 2. Homography 12. features 3. contradiction 13. Homonymy 4. Hyponymy 14. lexical 5. sentence 15. Partial 6. Antonymy 16. structurally 7. proposition 17. Polysemy 8. Homophony 18. analytic 9. utterance 19. pragmatic 10. reference 20.
