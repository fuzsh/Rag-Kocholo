The Showcase will include presentations from Nadine Griffiths on why reading matters for hospitalised neonates, Lyn Biviano on innovative multiagency service, KEYS, and Marianne Mc Cormick and Kellie Carter on maximising a child's potential through an allied health approach. To see the full agenda and register your attendance, visit https://lnkd.in/gDNtHFmU Registration is essential as space is limited. #First2000Days #SCHNKids #paediatrichealth\n\nThis week teams at The Children's Hospital at Westmead celebrated the 20th anniversary of Hall Ward, marking two decades of dedicated mental health care for young people. Opening in 2004, Hall Ward has evolved from providing care five days a week to offering around the clock care, and helping thousands of young people along the way. The milestone event honoured the exceptional contributions of our staff, including long-standing members like Nurse Zoey Mabey, who has worked on Hall Ward since its opening, and Pharmacist Judy Longworth, whose dedication has shaped the ward’s approach to care. Nurse Unit Manager of Hall Ward, Jennifer Fong said, “As we look ahead, we aim to deepen our focus on mental health treatment, with hopes of fostering greater understanding in the wider community.” “By leveraging our team’s expertise, we strive to enhance personalised care and improve how we address mental health within our hospital and beyond.\" Congratulations to Hall Ward on 20 years of impactful service and for continuing to provide hope and support to young people and their families.\n\nDid you know that the first 2,000 days of a child’s life are crucial for their future health and development? At the Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network (SCHN), we are committed to making these early days as impactful as possible. Join us on Tuesday, September 3 from 8:30am - 12:30pm AEST for this special FREE event dedicated to the importance of health and development from conception to 5 years of age. Discover the initiatives our teams are implementing to ensure every child has the best start in life. Register your attendance via the event link.\n\nCongratulations to Dr Andrew Wallis, Clinical Specialist Social Worker and Family Therapist at our Network, Paul Rhodes, and Kerrie James, who have just launched their new book 'A Practical Guide to Family Therapy'. This essential resource is designed for mental health clinicians to learn and apply systemic family therapy in their work with families. The book provides a comprehensive overview of the latest developments in family therapy and effectively translates systemic ideas into practice for both new and experienced social workers and family therapists. The first edition of the book has been used widely in both academic and clinical teaching programs. The 2024 edition includes new chapters on working with Aboriginal families and diversity and is already being utilised in the Master of Counselling Social Work at UNSW, Clinical Psychology Program at University of Sydney and the Master programs at The Bouverie Centre, La Trobe University.\n\nIt is a well-known fact breastfeeding can help give babies the best start to life. When a baby is in hospital, the role of this is even more important, making the support for healthcare teams invaluable. Together with Western Sydney Local Health District, our lactation nurses in the Grace Centre for Newborn Intensive Care and our Family Health Nurses recently ran a two-day 'SCORIO (Structured, Clinical, Objective, Referenced, Problem-orientated, Integrated, Organise) Breastfeeding Train the Trainer' workshop for healthcare workers, equipping participants with the knowledge and skills needed to become breastfeeding trainers. The interactive workshop brought together 64 participants from eight different Local Health Districts and our Network, including nurses from our Grace Centre, Edgar Stephens Ward, Clancy Ward, and our Education team. Lactation Specialist, Gabbie Kerslake, was one of the presenters at the workshop and said it was a hands-on way for participants to learn practical skills they can use to help educate and train their own teams. \"SCORPIO increases health professionals' confidence and provides them with up to date, evidence-based knowledge and skills that they can use when providing care for mothers and babies with breastfeeding,\" Gabbie said. \"The impact on mothers is that they receive correct and consistent information, which is vital for mothers of sick babies and infants. This empowers mothers to feel more supported so they can breastfeed for longer and hopefully decrease some of the stress they experience.\" The workshop was praised by participants and has been a vital step in building capacity and empowering more breastfeeding educators around the state.\n\nOur Network and NSW Health are committed to taking action and responding to climate risk to ensure the long-term sustainability of the healthcare sector. As part of this commitment, NSW Health has established a Sustainable Futures Innovation Fund to assist projects across the system deliver an environmentally sustainable footprint for the future. Congratulations to Associate Professor Justin Skowno, Dr Reza Kahlaee and their team in our Anaesthetics Department on their success in securing funding for their sustainability project 'Empowering Gas Monitoring for Better Care: A Smart Dashboard for Sustainability and Healthcare Efficiency'. With this grant, the team will develop a smart dashboard that provides real-time data on nitrous oxide gas consumption and emissions within healthcare facilities. The overall aim is to transform how healthcare facilities monitor and manage nitrous oxide gas usage, with a strong focus on reducing the environmental impact and enhancing operational efficiency. \"By accurately tracking nitrous oxide usage, with data-driven insights, the dashboard will help healthcare providers make informed decisions to optimise their resource usage,\" Dr Kahlaee said. The smart dashboard builds on last year's initiative to install an accurate flowmeter for monitoring nitrous oxide consumption at our hospital - the first of its kind in Australia, and is an important step in reducing our carbon footprint for the future. \"It is an incredible honour and a significant milestone for our team. It validates our vision of leveraging technology to create a healthier and more sustainable future,\" Dr Kahlaee said. We look forward to seeing this projects progress in the coming months.\n\nWorking in our Grace Centre for Newborn Intensive Care at The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Felicity and our lactation specialists provide crucial support to new mothers and their babies who are starting their breastfeeding journey. This includes Julieta and her baby, Austin, who was born at 28 weeks' gestation weighing less than a kilo. After several surgeries, Austin needed tailored support to help him progress to breastfeeding. With Felicity's guidance, Julieta was able to learn how to pump, the best ways to express milk and was able to practice regular skin-to-skin. Over time, Austin gradually mastered the skill of latching and breastfeeding quickly became one of his favourite activities. As well as working with families, our lactation specialists also work with other teams across the Network and across the health system, providing education and training that helps empower health professionals to support all new mums with breastfeeding their baby. The role of our lactation specialists across the Network is invaluable and this World Breastfeeding Week is a chance to recognise and celebrate their dedication in fostering successful breastfeeding journeys and delivering essential multi-level support for families like Austin's. #WorldBreastfeedingWeek #NICU #breastisbest\n\nJoin us for the biennial \"Spring with the Kids\" seminar on 14 September.
