        "text": "About us\n\nAdmissions\n\nAlder Hey is one of the busiest children's hospitals in Europe covering the Northwest of England, North Wales, and the Isle of Man.\n\nChildren present with a wide variety of complex medical conditions for which they may spend long, short, or recurring periods in hospital.\n\nWho do we teach?\n\nWe teach inpatients of statutory school age - up to 19 for those children with an EHCP (Education and Health Care Plan) - and who meet one or more of the criteria listed below. Our aim is to teach your child if he/she:\n\nIs likely to be in hospital longer than 15 days\n\nHas a recurring or chronic illness/diagnosis\n\nHas a Education Health Care Plan (EHCP)\n\nIs following an examination course and due to take exams that year (e.g. SATs, GCSE)\n\nTeachers monitor ward lists daily and may come and see parent/guardian to offer lessons.\n\nThe length of teaching sessions is variable and depends on a number of factors including children’s medical conditions, emotional and psychological issues, and length of admission period.\n\nOur Teaching Areas\n\nWards\n\nPatients are taught at the bedside on a one to one basis. The length of a teaching session will vary depending on age, ability level, and medical/emotional need.\n\nOncology Unit\n\nOncology patients attend the classroom and/or are taught at the bedside depending on their medical conditions.\n\nThe Neurological Rehabilitation Education and Assessment Unit.\n\nPatients are referred by the Head Injury Rehabilitation Team or Consultant Neurologist and a timetable is planned for them to attend the unit classroom.\n\nSunflower House\n\nIn-Patients attend the classroom base within the unit on a daily basis.\n\nSpecial Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND)\n\nWe have a dedicated SEND team which aims to meet the needs of patients with special needs and disabilities.\n\nCurriculum\n\nTeachers focus on English, Maths, and children’s special interest subjects according to National Curriculum guidelines and maintain continuity with pupils’ own school work where possible.\n\nParticular consideration is given to those children studying for SATs and GCSE examinations that year.\n\nActivities and targets for pupils in the specialist units are planned according to need.\n\nWhere applicable, post 16 pupils are supported to enable them to continue to progress with their educational targets including:\n\nArranging examinations\n\nProviding laptops and iPads with access to the internet\n\nLiaising with schools or colleges\n\nICT and Resources\n\nInformation and Communication Technology (ICT) is integral to the delivery of the curriculum, along with a wide variety of paper-based and practical resources. Teachers use laptops, iPads, and a range of educational software, including games and puzzles, to make learning fun - particularly important for children and young people in hospital.\n\nIn the classroom bases, pupils experience the latest technology such as interactive iBoards, touch screens, and switches.\n\nPupils are encouraged to maintain links with their teachers and peers online via their school websites and virtual learning environments.\n\nPublic Examinations\n\nWhere appropriate, arrangements can be made to enable pupils to take part in external examinations while in hospital."
