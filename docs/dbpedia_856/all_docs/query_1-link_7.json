        "text": "Staffing\n\nWard staff comprised a ward manager, two deputies shared across the two medical wards, band 6 nurses (n = 4), band 5 nurses (n = 29), HCAs (n = 5) and play specialists. The ward also had student nurses on placement. Staff turnover was high; many experienced staff had left for specialist roles, diluting the ward’s skill mix. There was widespread use of external agency staff.\n\nNurses and HCAs worked from 07.00 to 19.30. Typically, five registered nurses and a HCA were on shift, but staff could be moved in response to changing demand in the hospital. There was a designated nurse in charge of the shift (typically a senior band 6, although, at night, this could also be a band 5), who also carried a case load. Nurses were allocated patients from both sections of the ward. More experienced HCAs were allocated patients, but all observations had to be supervised by a qualified nurse.\n\nThe medical team covered the two general medical wards and worked 08.00–20.00. The eight-person rota included two consultants, two registrars and junior doctors (who rotated every 6 months), supported by ANPs who worked variable shift patterns. Generally, doctors divided themselves between the two general medical wards, the PAU and accident and emergency (A&E). General medical doctors were present on the ward immediately following ward round, with one SHO often based on the ward throughout the day. The hospital worked with the Hospital at Night model:215 two registrars and a SHO covered the general, specialty and surgical wards, and PAU and A&E, supported by an on-call consultant.\n\nThe specialist teams included paediatric specialists (oncology/renal/cardiac) and adult specialist with paediatric training (e.g. orthopaedics; ear, nose and throat).\n\nDetect\n\nMonitoring core vital signs was integral to nurses’ work, although not all nurses were equally skilled in monitoring techniques. The hospital’s observation policy specified which observations should be conducted routinely and set a minimum frequency of every 4 hours, unless otherwise indicated (see Report Supplementary Material 18). The policy was well understood by nurses, who undertook a range of ‘additional assessments’: ‘eyeballing’ patients, touching patients to assess temperature and assessing tracheal tug (a proxy for increased effort of breathing). Nurses often increased the frequency of observations based on their assessments. They also made professional judgements in deciding which vital signs to monitor, which may have been non-compliant with observation policy, but took into account wider considerations about a child’s care:\n\nHe’s not too hot, so I won’t do his temperature now. The fact his heart rate is low and I’ve touched him and he’s not hot, we’ll just let him go into a deeper sleep and then do his temperature, because they don’t want to wake him up just for that.\n\nNurse, field notes\n\nNurses had a high level of awareness of conditions that required additional observations. Patient categorisations such as ‘bronch baby’, ‘premie’ and ‘ex-25 weeker’ oriented staff to risk factors and additional observations required. Beyond formal observations, nurses valued having oversight of patients, although the physical layout of the ward made this challenging:\n\nIt is wonderful for the parents, the parents love it, but it is really tricky for the staff. We can’t see everything that is going on.\n\nNurse, field notes\n\nThe four-bedded bay and two single cubicles had fixed continuous monitoring. Higher-acuity patients were allocated to these beds or rooms immediately adjacent to the nurses’ station, which allowed greater visibility. Mobile continuous monitoring units could be provided if required.\n\nThe sound of alarms was commonplace, triggered by a drop in oxygen saturation levels or if a monitor had been disconnected. Nurses always responded, but often to check that the equipment was working correctly. Staff frequently readjusted probes to encourage oxygen saturation level readings to improve. There were no monitors at the nurses’ station, however, and nurses were required to determine the alarm’s location. Depending on the patient, nurses also permitted parents to turn off monitors:\n\n[T]hey’ve said ‘you can switch it off if you want to because, as long as we check it every now and again’, I just turn it on and have a look [laughter] and check it and turn it off again.\n\nParent\n\nA monitoring equipment trolley was located in the middle of the ward, which was inconvenient for staff working in more distant rooms. In addition, field observations revealed that nurses were often unable to locate a specific item, and/or the equipment was broken. Thermometers were a particular issue and, once located, would be held by staff rather than being returned to the equipment trolley.\n\nNurse 1 to Nurse 2:\n\nYou don’t know what I’ve done with my thermometer do you?\n\nNurse 2:\n\nI don’t but I can tell you where I’ve stashed mine.\n\nField notes\n\nThere were no formal routines for involving families, although staff considered themselves to regularly involve families in defining baselines, as well as encouraging them to talk about any concerns. Nurses also actively engaged parents in monitoring their child’s condition. During interviews, two parents reported that nursing staff had explained to them acceptable ranges in observation numbers and that they then played an active role in monitoring their child. One parent noted that staff had spent time explaining what the numbers on continuous monitoring equipment related to, and the parent reported that she was not concerned as long as the patient’s heart rate stayed at < 200 beats per minute.\n\nObservations were recorded on paper charts. There were no colour-coded vital signs thresholds and no PTTT score. Although charts allowed nurses to clearly see patterns and trends, staff with previous experience of working with PTTTs favoured the colour-coded vital signs thresholds, as these were useful triggers for action:\n\nI really don’t like the documentation here so much. [. . .] Because it’s just black and white, [. . .] the obs[ervation] chart is not so nice. [. . .] When you see a heart rate up to a hundred per cent, in the dark red, so you see, everybody would see, OK, err and a student would see that is not right.\n\nNurse\n\nThere were no formal resources on the ward that allowed staff to check a child’s observations against normal thresholds, with an assumption that these should be known by all staff.\n\nObservation charts were located in a folder stored outside a patient’s room. Nurses were often unable to find a folder immediately, typically because medical staff were using it. During these times, nursing staff still performed a full round of observations on their patients, noting the results on informal pieces of paper and later transferring these to observation charts.\n\nContinuity of care was ensured whenever possible, and was prioritised during patient allocation. Nurses had high levels of engagement with parents and involved them in interpretations of a child’s vital signs:\n\nHe is very clammy. I asked mum if he gets clammy at night and she said he does but not like this, this is more than normal.\n\nNurse, field notes\n\nFamily concern was also regularly highlighted during nursing handover. Sometimes this was described as something relevant, and other times it was described as parental anxiety or a lack of understanding of the child’s condition. Not all parents were treated as equally legitimate in raising concerns.\n\nPlan\n\nThere were a number of mechanisms for reviewing individual patients and unit capacity, which produced different levels of situational awareness across the nursing and medical teams.\n\nWard staff received a safety briefing at 07.00. This was used to highlight patients at risk of deterioration, or those with particularly challenging pre-existing conditions, as well as general information. The shift’s handover sheet was also distributed during the safety briefing. This was electronically generated, containing information relating to diagnosis, treatment, medication and tests needed or awaiting results (see Report Supplementary Material 19).\n\nMore detailed information on all patients was shared during nursing handover, which was conducted outside the patients’ rooms, to enable a visual review of the children. Nurses asked questions to make sense of the case, for example when a point was not clear, or if they felt that the account being provided contradicted their experience of looking after that child during a previous shift. Nurses received handover for all patients and so had an overview of the whole ward. Both the morning and evening handovers followed the same format. During the week, the ward manager, who was a highly experienced clinician, reviewed all patients to identify individuals at risk.\n\nA whiteboard indicated the location of patients on the ward, nurse–patient allocation and the on-shift consultant. A yellow star denoted the sickest patients, although was not always used. The board was regularly updated at nursing handover.\n\nA bed management meeting took place at 14.00 and 20.00 on the PAU. This was held with the patient flow co-ordinators and ward managers, to review organisational capacity. The medical handover took place twice a day at 08.30 and 20.30, and was an opportunity to review all patients in the medical service, with on-coming doctors and ANPs making notes on an electronic pre-populated handover sheet. However, there was no systematic mechanism for identifying children of concern and no ward nurse in attendance.\n\nThe general medical team ward round was an opportunity to review all patients and talk to parents. The format varied. Sometimes, the team saw all patients; on other occasions, the team divided into two, with the consultant focused on the sickest patients and the registrar leading the other team. The whole team came together after the ward round to review decisions and plan. In the week, the ward manager always attended the ward round. Children under the care of specialist teams would be seen during the morning ward round for that team, but the timing of this was less predictable and nurse involvement was inconsistent. Nurses would often have to check the medical notes to establish the plans for a child’s care.\n\nAlthough there were mechanisms in place to ensure that nursing and medical teams had an overview of the patients in their care, there was no opportunity for a shared nursing and medical understanding, and information flows were fragmented. Doctors were not always aware of the most at-risk children on the ward, and did not always prioritise activity appropriately. In addition, the general medical team’s purview extended to all the medical patients in the hospital across two wards, the PAU and A&E, whereas the purview of nurses included children under the care of specialists and the medical patients on a single ward.\n\nAct\n\nThere was no hospital-wide PTTT score and no formal escalation policy. Junior nurses typically escalated concerns to the nurse in charge, who then made a decision about escalating to medical colleagues, working up through the medical hierarchy if they were not satisfied with the response. One doctor, usually a SHO, was ward based during the day and was visible at the nurses’ station, which meant that concerns were often addressed informally. Although this seemed to work satisfactorily in practice, there was sometimes a lack of clarity about the process when escalating; this could be particularly challenging at night, when there was more limited medical cover and/or when the nurse raising concerns was more junior. There were particular challenges contacting the on-call consultant at night and some of the specialist consultants, especially if they were from the adult service:\n\nThe [name of specialist consultant] was phoned, and said he would come in in 2 hours to review [the patient], but I said, ‘sorry that’s not good enough’. He then told me off for forcing him to make decisions under pressure. But I wasn’t happy at all, I didn’t want to wait, so I sent her to HDU.\n\nConsultant, field notes\n\nAt interview, many parents described feeling able to raise concerns about their child with nurses, although this was observed to be more difficult for families for whom English was not their first language. However, involvement was uneven, with not all parents instructed on the use of buzzers to alert the nurse. The physical layout of the ward could make it difficult for families to locate the nurses. See Report Supplementary Material 6, Table 3, for a summary of the pre-implementation system strengths and weaknesses identified by the PUMA team.\n\nThe PUMA programme initiatives\n\nThe team proposed four initiatives (see Report Supplementary Material 8, Table 3):\n\nmodified SHINE posters in clinical areas\n\nelectronic site board at nurses’ stations\n\nreviewing and adjusting existing communication mediums\n\nescalation plan.\n\nModified SHINE posters\n\nThe SHINE poster was intended to address weakness in family involvement in monitoring and detecting deterioration (see Report Supplementary Material 20). The initiative, as expressed in the action planning documentation, aimed to ensure ‘continuity of clear information for parents’ and to ‘empower parents to report the deterioration of their child’s condition when it happens’.\n\nThe senior nurse PI led the initiative, having failed to enlist the help of others. The poster was developed in February 2017, and implemented throughout June 2017. Trust policy stipulated that posters should be placed on pin boards only; these were unavailable in the surgical unit, and the intervention was never extended to the specialist or oncology wards. Implementation on the medical wards was facilitated through an additional poster designed to engage nurses in the use of the tool, and was also promoted through nursing and medical induction programmes.\n\nA small number of SHINE posters were observed in patient rooms during the post-implementation fieldwork, but their use had not been normalised on the medical ward. Many staff were unfamiliar with the tool, and those who were familiar with it maintained that they had not received any information on its purpose. When the intent of the poster was explained, staff indicated that, in formalising a process that was deeply embedded in their professional practice, it undermined their role as nurses. There was criticism of the poster’s content and format (volume of information and font size), which, it was suggested, would discourage people from reading it. There was also resistance to the idea of formally requesting parents to monitor their child:\n\n[It is] a lot of responsibility for a parent to recognise change. You know, it’s different saying ‘I think his breathing has changed, can you have a look, I’m a bit worried’, than actually sort of rely on the parents to look at the rolling signs that their child’s . . . I don’t think I agree with that.\n\nSenior nurse\n\nReviewing and adjusting existing communication mediums\n\nThis initiative was intended to address system weakness relating to nursing–medical communication of at-risk children. Doctors, in particular, were not always aware of the sickest children on the ward; therefore, prioritising high-risk children was not as efficient as it could be.\n\nIn February 2017, a consultant (the PI) observed medical handovers to assess the extent to which at-risk children were identified and prioritised. This confirmed that there was no clear mechanism for achieving this. A ‘common safety briefing’ attended by both nurses and medical staff was proposed, but little progress was made because of difficulties in accommodating different shift patterns.\n\nThe initiative was abandoned, with the team electing to focus on the implementation of the electronic whiteboard to support situational awareness.\n\nElectronic site board\n\nThe electronic site board was intended as a common information space for doctors and nurses to identify the sickest patients across all wards. However, it quickly became apparent that this ‘became too big a mountain to climb’ because it needed to be managed by the health board’s information technology department, which had other priorities.\n\nAn alternative intervention was developed: a whiteboard displaying the ‘4Ss’ (sickest patients, bed status, safeguarding issues and staffing) in the general, specialty and surgical doctors’ handover rooms. The intent was that, prior to medical handovers, the registrar handing over would run through the ‘4Ss’ and then add a yellow star next to ‘at-risk children’.\n\nWhiteboards were installed in the general medical doctors’ handover room. The board displayed the sickest patients across the general wards, as well as highlighting staff, bed management and safeguarding issues, and was completed at the start of every handover (see Report Supplementary Material 21). The purpose of this was to quickly orient medical staff to issues surrounding the planning of risk and to ensure that there was common understanding. For this to be achieved across teams, nursing staff were required to telephone the doctors’ room before each medical handover to share their own interpretation of the ‘4Ss’. Staff were enrolled in the initiative through a variety of means: presentations to all junior doctors during orientation, and meetings were held with new registrars and with senior nurses. A second whiteboard was also extended to specialty medicine in September 2017.\n\nThe success of the initiative was uneven. During the early period of implementation, the presence of the clinical chief investigator during handover may have helped to embed the new format, but, over time, practice became variable and was largely dependent on the registrar handing over.\n\nSome medical staff found the new approach to be beneficial; it had the desired impact of improving multidisciplinary communication and at-risk children were identified on one system:\n\nBefore this, we probably wouldn’t have had a clue about bed status or erm, the nursing side of things. It was kind of, like, very separate.\n\nJunior Doctor\n\nTelephone calls between senior nurses and the doctors at the start of handover appeared to happen routinely during the post-implementation observations. Concern regarding any child raised during the nursing handover would also be communicated during medical handover. The ward manager and senior nurses all mentioned that they were now able to get information on to the doctors’ handover if needed. The initiative did not appear to have been implemented on the specialty medical ward. Although the whiteboard was installed, it was not used. This is arguably down to the very different culture on this ward. Rather than one team on the general medical ward, the specialty medicine ward is made up of a number of different teams, each responsible for their own patients. A consensus on what patient is at greatest risk of deteriorating is far more challenging in this environment.\n\nEscalation plan\n\nThe purpose of this initiative, as expressed in the action planning documentation, was to articulate a clear procedure for escalating care, with the aim of embedding ‘a more consistent approach, to empower staff to call for help and to make clear the roles and expectation of senior staff in responding to escalation requests’. The policy was initially intended to be implemented across all wards and was developed by the senior nurse PI working with ward managers. The policy specified to whom concerns should be escalated and subsequent steps if there was ‘ongoing deterioration or an inadequate response’ (see Report Supplementary Material 22). Once the Children’s Board approved the policy, a number of implementation strategies were employed, such as inclusion in staff induction, and nursing and medical study days. However, difficulties were encountered in practice with implementing this across multiple wards. There were certain wards that were more difficult to change than others; the surgery ward, in particular, was very resistant to the idea of having a formal escalation policy, despite this being the ward where difficulties in escalation were highlighted during the system assessment process. Consequently, implementation was limited to the two general medical wards.\n\nIn the post-implementation fieldwork, there was a low level of awareness on the new policy, but this may be because the policy simply formalised usual practice. This lack of awareness of the formal policy, made it challenging to assess whether or not it empowered staff to escalate.\n\nSee Report Supplementary Material 9, Table 3, for a summary of initiatives implemented at Noah’s Ark, and Appendix 21, Table 47, for a summary of all embedded system improvements."
