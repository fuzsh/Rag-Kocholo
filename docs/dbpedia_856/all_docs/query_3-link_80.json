This document provides an introduction to semantics. It defines semantics as the branch of linguistics that deals with meaning in language. It distinguishes semantics from pragmatics by explaining that semantics studies meaning in language itself, while pragmatics studies meaning in context. The document gives examples to illustrate how semantic meaning is context-free, while pragmatic meaning depends on context. It also outlines three main aspects commonly included in semantics - word meaning, sentence meaning, and utterance meaning.",
