        "text": "Our high performance, heavy-duty 'WISKAWAY'® Wall Beds have an unbeatable service record, meet all current Health & Safety, Manual Handling and Infection Control requirements and eliminate the need for ward staff to trundle makeshift beds to and fro and make them up/unmake them each evening/morning. This leads to substantial cost savings over time, including reduced laundry bills, as well as various Health & Safety and Manual Handling benefits.\n\nBecause ‘WISKAWAY’® Wall Beds are counterbalanced, they need to be fixed to the wall.\n\nAlder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool is one of the world's leading Children's Hospitals and has recently moved to a new site.\n\nFor many years, Alder Hey specified our 'WISKAWAY’® Wall Beds for incorporation into their ward refurbishment and new-build projects.\n\nThus, 16 of our Vertical 'WISKAWAY’® 7500H Wall Beds were specified for the bays and cubicles in the new Paediatric Oncology Building at Alder Hey, opened in 2003, with housings in a tough, wipe-clean 'Light Ash' MFC finish. As many of the children/their parents on this unit were likely to have to spend longer periods in Hospital, matching Wardrobes/Lockers 7600H were also included.\n\nThe client list for our ‘WISKAWAY’® 7500H Vertical wallbed includes Children’s units in General Hospitals throughout England, Scotland and Wales, as well as dedicated Children’s Hospitals, including Great Ormond Street Hospital in London and most of the new Children’s Hospitals to be built in recent years, such as the new Royal Aberdeen Children’s Hospital, the new Queen Elizabeth Children’s Hospital in Glasgow, the new Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital, the newly extended Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospital for Wales in Cardiff, the new Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, the new Children’s Hospital at the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth and the new Royal Alexandra Children’s Hospital in Brighton. The ‘WISKAWAY’® 7500H is also used in Hospices up and down the country and in private Hospitals such as the BMI Alexandra Hospital in Manchester and the BUPA Cromwell Hospital in London.\n\nA current requirement in Children's Hospitals is to provide overnight accommodation for at least one parent, as near as possible to the child's bed.\n\nVarious types of space-saving bed have been employed over the years for this purpose, but the ultimate solution to the problem of where to put parents, is a ‘WISKAWAY’® Wall Bed.\n\nGP Care Systems are the country's leading supplier of wallbeds and related furniture for Hospitals and Hospices.\n\nSpecifically designed for daily, heavy-duty use, GP Care Systems' range of high performance, all-steel, Horizontal and Vertical 'WISKAWAY'® Wall Beds for Hospitals and Hospices, are fully counterbalanced and fitted with automatically opening and retracting legs, for safe, smooth and easy operation.\n\nThey set completely new standards of safety, durability, comfort, convenience and space-efficiency and are supplied, with a choice of wipe-clean mattresses and complete with tough, compact, unobtrusive, integral housings, in a wide range of attractive, finishes, including wipe-clean MFC and Plastic Laminates as well as veneers. Matching wardrobes/lockers and other (optional) complementary furniture are also available.\n\n‘WISKAWAY’® Wall beds come with a FULL 5 YEAR GUARANTEE. Single ‘WISKAWAY’® Wall Beds will comfortably handle loads of up to 200Kg and doubles can easily cope with up to 400Kg.\n\n'WISKAWAY'® Wall Beds are designed for heavy-duty use every night and can be made-up and folded away, complete with all the bedding, including the pillows, in literally seconds (in an emergency for instance). This leaves the space taken up by the bed during the night free for use by patients, visitors and staff and the area tidy and easy to keep clean, during the day.\n\nAt night, the bed can be folded down and ready to use in seconds and offers the same standard of comfort and convenience as a good quality conventional divan bed.\n\nOur 'Wiskaway'® 7500H Wall beds, at Alder Hey Children's Hospital, in Liverpool\n\nClick on the arrows or numbers above to see pictures of the 'Wiskaway' 7500H Wall Bed and Wardrobe/Locker 7600H, at Alder Hey Children's Hospital."
