        "text": "Little Nuala has been fitted with a new prosthetic eye after beating an extremely rare form of cancer 🤩 Back in 2023, 10-month-old Nuala was diagnosed with a very rare cancer called Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma, which affects just six people in England a year. Her tumour grew behind her left eye which is even more rare, leading to multiple surgeries here at Alder Hey 🏥 and eventually the removal of her left eye. Now 19 months old, Nuala rang the end-of-treatment bell in January and is adjusting well with her new prosthetic eye 😊 Nuala’s surgeon, Consultant in Paediatric Ophthalmology Mr Ankur Raj, said: “I had never seen this type of cancer affect the eye before. Nuala’s resilience has been truly amazing. We are working hard with Aintree University Hospital to make Nuala’s new prosthetic eye a perfect match.” 🤝 Mum Megan said: \"Nuala amazes us every day. Despite the challenges, she's thriving and has settled into nursery so well.\" 💙 To say thank you for the care Nuala has received, the family is fundraising for our Charity through various events, including the Conniston Challenge in July! #NualasJourney #sarcomaawarenessmonth #rarechildhoodcancer\n\n#FeelGoodFriday | You may recognise baby Orla (also known as The Scouse Baby) from when she went viral for her adorable scouse accent 🤩 A minute-long clip of Orla's baby talk has been viewed more than 15 million times after being posted on TikTok. Now 20 months old, Orla has been a patient at Alder Hey for half her life 🏥 She began showing signs of eczema at just four months old, and managing it became increasingly difficult. By 10 months old, Orla was scratching so much that she was drawing blood, leading to frequent infections 😔 At her first dermatology appointment, Orla was thoroughly examined and diagnosed with eczema and dermatitis. For two weeks, she had to come in every other day for fresh bandages 🤕 Mum Rhiannon said “We are incredibly grateful for the amazing care she receives at Alder Hey. Orla is doing great, and her skin is improving. While she isn't quite cured yet, with the help of the dermatology team, managing her condition has become much easier. We remain hopeful that she will outgrow her eczema one day.” 💙 #AlderHeyFamily #FGF #FridayFeeling\n\nOur latest #StaroftheMonth winner was Lisa Flannery 🌟, a Physiotherapy Assistant here at Alder Hey, for going above and beyond for a long term family. Here are some highlights from those who nominated Lisa for the award: “Lisa is an amazing member of the Long term Ventilation team. She is such an important part of the team. Her empathy, care and compassion of the patients and families go far and beyond what is expected. She has regularly stayed beyond her hours delivering equipment to the families even at her own expense to ensure that they have the equipment required for ventilation.” “Lisa embodies Alder hey values and the team functions more effectively due to her being in it.” “Lisa is so humble and would never take the credit she deserves so we feel by having this award would highlight to her what she means to the families and team.” Congratulations Lisa! 👏👏👏\n\nAlder Hey teams shortlisted for Health Service Journal Awards! 🤩 Congratulations to our Emergency Department and Respiratory Parent Champions in the Community teams, which have both been shortlisted for the HSJ Awards 🏆 Our Emergency Department has been shortlisted for the Performance Recovery Award for its 'ED at its Best' programme. This initiative delivered massive and sustained performance improvements in the department. The 'Respiratory Parent Champions in the Community' programme has been shortlisted for the Early Intervention and Prevention for Children, Young People and Families Award for its work in reducing bronchiolitis admission rates. Respiratory Parent Champions in the Community is a dynamic peer-support program launched jointly by Alder Hey and Liverpool Children's Centres in January 2022. Alder Hey employs mothers as Parent Champions, delivering essential advice and support to families in Liverpool's most deprived wards, to empower parents and reduce inequalities in bronchiolitis and early years respiratory health. The winners will be announced by HSJ in October. Best of luck to these amazing teams! 🤞 🍀\n\nCongratulations to our very own Mr Sunil Sharma, who has been appointed Training Programme Director for ENT for the entire North West region. As an Alder Hey consultant, Sunil will be leading our role in medical education at a regional level in ENT. Sunil said: “I'm hoping to develop innovative programmes in the ENT educational programme using simulation and new technology such as virtual reality. I'm also hoping to improve awareness and support for our diverse group of trainees, as well as promoting less than full time training amongst both trainees and trainers - in ENT we have some of the largest numbers of less than full time trainees amongst surgical specialties.\" Congratulations and best of luck to Sunil in his new role!\n\nStanding Together – One Alder Hey We are One Alder Hey, made up of thousands of remarkable people from hundreds of different backgrounds, cultures and faiths.
