        "text": "Homonyms, antonyms, and synonyms Hyponym can be used to learn new words and add a great deal to your diction and the way you talk about language in particular. Knowing what words are similar or opposites helps people to understand the same when it comes to ideas. Ideas are impossible without words, and words are impossible without ideas. The more you think about the interrelationships of one, the better you are able to think about the interrelationships of the other. Synonymy is the relationship between synonyms. Synonyms are words which sound different, but have the same or nearly the same meanings and therefore may often be used interchangeably. An example of synonyms is the words cat and feline. Each describes any member of the family Felidae. Similarly, if we talk about a long time or an extended time, long, and extended become synonyms. An antonym of a particular word is one that has the opposite meaning. An antonym is usually an adjective or adverb, but can include verb forms such as \"coming / going\", \"leading/ following\", and \"heeding / ignoring\". Example: • Small is an antonym of big • The antonym of smart would be unintelligent. • Walk can be an antonym of run Homonyms are different words which are pronounced the same, but have different meanings. When the same word has different meanings, we call it polysemous. Homonyms and polysemy may create ambiguity. An expression is ambiguous if more than one meaning can be assigned to it. Example: • Fish (hypernym) = lion fish, nemo, cichilds (hyponym) • Color (hypernym)= red, white, black, pink (hyponym) • Vegetable (hypernym)= watercress, lettuce, broccoli, green bean (hyponym) Hyponymy is the relationship between hyponyms. Hyponyms is the word the meaning of which may be said to be included in that of another word. For example: • Rose is a hyponym of flower • Spinster is a hyponym of woman Hyponym is transitive. Potato is a kind of vegetables, and vegetable is a kind of plant. Potato is also a hyponym of plants as we can say potato is a kind of plant. If A is a hyponym of B, then A is a kind of B."
