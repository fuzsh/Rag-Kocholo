When an employer has a 40-hour workweek, employees who are scheduled to work 40 hours per week are 1.0 FTEs. Employees scheduled to work 20 hours per week are 0.5 FTEs. — How do I calculate full-time equivalent (FTE) hours?\n\nThis is the technical term that’s used in my organization, in fact (which is why I’ve actually used fte as a variable name).\n\nI don't think there is a standardized term for exactly what you are looking for. But you could use variations instead. For example:\n\nContractual Status\n\nContractual Category\n\nEmployee Category\n\nShift Type\n\nWorking Hours\n\netc."
