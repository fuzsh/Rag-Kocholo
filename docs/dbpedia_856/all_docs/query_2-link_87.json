        "text": "What other information is available?\n\nAppendix information is available to download in the Info and downloads section.\n\nReports released prior to 2017–18 can be accessed in the Reports section.\n\nFurther information about the concepts on this page can be found in the Glossary.\n\nReferences\n\nABS (Australian Bureau of Statistics) (2023) Estimates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, ABS website, accessed 8 November 2023\n\nABS (2023 ) Regional population, ABS website, accessed 8 November 2023\n\nWhat other information is available?\n\nMore information on these data are available in the Admitted patient care 2022–23: What services were provided? data tables.\n\nDefinitions of the terms used in this section are available in the Glossary.\n\nAcute care\n\nAn episode of Acute care for an admitted patient is one in which the principal clinical intent is to do one or more of the following:\n\nmanage labour (obstetric)\n\ncure illness or provide definitive treatment of injury\n\nperform surgery\n\nrelieve symptoms of illness or injury (excluding palliative care)\n\nreduce severity of illness or injury\n\nprotect against exacerbation and/or complication of an illness and/or injury which could threaten life or normal functions\n\nperform diagnostic or therapeutic procedures\n\nRehabilitation care\n\nRehabilitation care is care in which the primary clinical purpose or treatment goal is improvement in the functioning of a patient with an impairment, activity limitation, or participation restriction due to a health condition.\n\nRehabilitation care is always:\n\ndelivered under the management of or informed by a clinician with specialised expertise in rehabilitation\n\nevidenced by an individualised multidisciplinary management plan, which is documented in the patient’s medical record, which includes negotiated goals within specified time frames and formal assessment of functional ability.\n\nPalliative care\n\nPalliative care is defined as care in which the primary clinical purpose or treatment goal is optimisation of the quality of life of a patient with an active and advanced life-limiting illness. The patient will have complex physical, psychosocial and/or spiritual needs.\n\nPalliative care is always:\n\ndelivered under the management of or informed by a clinician with specialised expertise in palliative care\n\nevidenced by an individualised multidisciplinary assessment and management plan, which is documented in the patient's medical record that covers the physical, psychological, emotional, social and spiritual needs of the patient and negotiated goals.\n\nMental health care\n\nMental health care is defined in this publication as care in which the primary clinical purpose or treatment goal is improvement in the symptoms and/or psychosocial, environmental, and physical functioning related to a patient’s mental disorder.\n\nMental health care:\n\nis delivered under the management of, or regularly informed by, a clinician with specialised expertise in mental health\n\nis evidenced by an individualised formal mental health assessment and the implementation of a documented mental health plan\n\nmay include significant psychosocial components, including family and carer support.\n\nMental health care differs from mental health-related care reported in AIHW Mental health services reports. A hospitalisation is classified as mental health-related if:\n\nit had a mental health-related principal diagnosis, which, for admitted patient care in this report, is defined as a principal diagnosis that is either:\n\na diagnosis that falls within the section on Mental and behavioural disorders (Chapter 5) in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision, Australian Modification (ICD‑10‑AM) (codes F00–F99), or\n\na number of other selected diagnoses (see the technical information for a full list of applicable diagnoses), and/or\n\nit included any specialised psychiatric care.\n\nFor 2021–22, mental health care refers to hospitalisations for which the care type was reported as Mental health. The care type Mental health was introduced from 1 July 2015. Prior to this, mental health admitted patient activity was assigned to one of the other care types.\n\n‘Qualified’ newborn\n\nA day is considered ‘qualified’ for health insurance benefits purposes when a newborn meet at least 1 of the following criteria:\n\nthe newborn is the second or subsequent live born infant of a multiple birth, whose mother is currently an admitted patient\n\nthe newborn is admitted to an intensive care facility in a hospital, being a facility approved by the Commonwealth Minister for the purpose of the provision of special care\n\nthe newborn is admitted to or remains in hospital without its mother.\n\nA newborn admission to hospital can occur at any time within the first 9 days of life, including at the time of birth.\n\n‘Unqualified’ newborn\n\nThe reporting of unqualified newborns has changed over time and varies across jurisdictions. Prior to 2017–18, newborn episodes involving unqualified care were routinely excluded from national reporting on the basis that they did not meet admission criteria for all purposes. However, due to changes in Newborn care practices (such as, care being provided to unqualified newborns on the ward rather than in a special care nursery) stakeholders have expressed interest in the reporting of all newborn episodes, regardless of qualification status.\n\nSeven states and territories met the national benchmark\n\nAll states and territories achieved rates below the current nationally-agreed performance benchmark of 1.0 case per 10,000 patient days, except Tasmania. Rates ranged from 0.56 in South Australia to 1.04 in Tasmania.\n\nTrends over time\n\nOverall, SABSI rates have decreased at the national level from 1.09 cases per 10,000 patient days in 2010–11 to 0.74 in 2022-23. Rates by state/territory fluctuate from year to year.\n\nOn 1 July 2020, the agreed national benchmark changed from no more than 2.0 cases of healthcare-associated SABSI per 10,000 days of patient care to no more than 1.0 case.\n\nSince 2010–11, rates of healthcare-associated MRSA have also declined – from 0.29 cases per 10,000 patient days to 0.12 cases in 2022–23. These cases accounted for 27% of all SABSI cases in 2010–11 compared with 16% of all cases in 2022–23.\n\nWhat other information is available?\n\nMore information about ALOS can be found in Tables 2,9 to 2.11, S2.8 and S2.9 in Admitted patient care 2022–23: How much activity was there?\n\nDefinitions of the terms used in this section are available in the Glossary.\n\nAverage length of stay\n\nThe average length of stay (ALOS) is calculated as the total number of patient days reported for the hospital (or group of hospitals), divided by the number of separations. Two measures for ALOS are presented:\n\nALOS for all separations\n\nALOS excluding same-day separations\n\nPerformance indicator: Average length of stay for selected AR-DRGs\n\nThe ALOS for selected AR-DRGs can be considered as an indicator of hospital efficiency and sustainability. The selected AR-DRGs were chosen on the basis of:\n\nhomogeneity, where variation is more likely to be attributable to the hospital’s performance rather than variations in the patients themselves\n\nrepresentativeness across clinical groups\n\ndifferences between jurisdictions and/or sectors\n\npolicy interest, as evidenced by (1) inclusion of similar groups in other tables in Australian hospital statistics, such as indicator procedures for elective surgery waiting time, (2) high volume and/or cost and (3) changes in volume over years.\n\nDue to changes in the AR-DRG classification, the data presented here are not comparable with the data presented in previous years."
