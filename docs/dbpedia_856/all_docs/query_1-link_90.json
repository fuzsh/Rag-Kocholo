        "text": "You can usually stay with your child in hospital.\n\nStaying in hospital can be frightening, particularly for children. They're suddenly in a very different place, surrounded by people they don't know.\n\nNew sights, sounds and smells can be scary for a child. Being there as much as you can will help them cope better.\n\nIf you can stay overnight, ask staff to arrange an extra bed or mattress for you.\n\nSome hospitals have accommodation nearby that you can use while your child is in hospital.\n\nTell your child what's happening\n\nIf you can stay with your child, let them know that you'll be there with them.\n\nSome people may not be able to stay with their child. For example, if:\n\nthey have other children\n\ntheir child is in hospital for a long time\n\nthey have to go to work\n\nIf you can't stay with your child or you have to go, talk to them beforehand and let them know what's happening.\n\nTell them how long you'll be gone for and make sure you're back on time.\n\nHow to prepare your child for hospital\n\nStaying in hospital will be easier for your child if they have an idea of what to expect.\n\nIf your child has been referred to hospital for planned treatment, you may have time to prepare them.\n\nExplain to your child that hospitals are a safe place to be, and that doctors and nurses are there to make them feel better.\n\nUsing a book can help your child feel at ease. There are many good children's books about hospitals. Ask at your local bookshop for ideas."
