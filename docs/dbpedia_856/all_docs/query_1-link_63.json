        "text": "We appreciate that this is an extremely stressful, worrying and upsetting time for you and your family.\n\nWe hope this booklet will help to answer some of the many questions about your child’s care and transfer. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask a member of the NWTS team.\n\nNWTS is a specialised transport team for critically ill babies and children. We provide mobile Intensive care to critically ill children anywhere in the North West and North Wales regions and transport them from local District General Hospitals to the Royal Manchester Children’s or Alder Hey Children’s Hospitals (Although for some specific medical conditions this may involve other specialised hospitals elsewhere in the UK).\n\nOur transport team is made up of a doctor, nurse and ambulance personnel.\n\nThe team has specialist training in the care and transportation of critically ill children.\n\nThe doctor and nurse are also senior members of the Paediatric Intensive Care Units (PICU) at either the Royal Manchester or Alder Hey Children’s hospitals.\n\nYour local hospital team will have telephoned NWTS for help with your child’s condition and current treatment. Our team will advise your local team on further treatment strategies and necessary procedures to help stabilise your child. When the NWTS team arrives at your local hospital, we will receive a handover of your child’s care and make a full assessment of them. Whilst working with your local hospital team, we will stabilise your child and devise a treatment plan. And then transport him/her to a PICU where on going treatment can be provided. The team will let you know which PICU your child will be taken to.\n\nAt NWTS, we have our own fully equipped ambulances which are specifically designed for the safe transport of children requiring Intensive Care. It is our policy to allow a parent to travel with their child, but sometimes this may not be possible. We will then ask your local hospital to arrange transport.\n\n• Remain seated, wear your seatbelt at all times and do not undo your seatbelt during the journey, unless otherwise instructed by the team\n\n• If you have any medical conditions please inform the team\n\n• You will be introduced to our ambulance team who will be your “Buddy”. They will support you if an emergency occurs and we need to stop the ambulance to treat your child.\n\n• The team will try to keep you updated on your child’s condition throughout the journey, but our main priority is caring for your child.\n\n• The team may have frequent discussions by telephone in the ambulance to update the accepting PICU of your child’s condition.\n\nAddress: Eaton Road, West Derby, L12 2AP\n\nSat Nav address: East Prescot Road L14 5AB\n\nSwitchboard: 0151 228 4811—Dial 1 then extension number for either:\n\nPICU Pod 1– 5850 or 2531, Pod 2– 2241 or 2242, Pod 3 2178 or 2520\n\nPHDU—2346\n\nWard 1c—0151 252 5418 / 5740 (Located on the first floor)\n\nAlder Hey is situated in West Derby, Liverpool, approximately 5 miles east of the city centre, very close to the junction of Queen’s Drive, the A5058 Ring Road and East Prescot Road (A57).\n\n• At the end of M62 motorway filter right (westbound)\n\n• Turn right onto Queens Drive and drive for approximately 1 mile\n\n• At 1st set of traffic lights (opposite the Navigator public house) turn right onto East Prescot Road\n\n• Alder Hey is approximately 0.3miles on your left.\n\n• At the traffic lights turn left and follow the road around to the multi storey car park\n\nAddress: Oxford Road, M13 9WL\n\nLocated on the first floor of Manchester Children’s Hospital.\n\nSwitchboard: 0161 276 1234 / PICU: 0161 701 8000 / PHDU: 0161 701 8200\n\nPICU & PHDU is located on the first floor.\n\nIf entering the hospital after 22:00 the Children’s Hospital entrance is closed.

This is supported by our charity.\n\nOn arrival to your designated PICU, the team will transfer your child’s care over to the receiving unit.\n\nWhilst this process takes place the team may ask you to sit in the parents room. Once your child is stable on the PICU monitors and equipment , the PICU nurse will bring you through to see your child.\n\nThe Ronald McDonald House provides free 'home away from home' accommodation for families of children being treated at the hospital for as long as the families need it.\n\nThe House can accommodate up to four people per room.\n\nRonald MacDonald House believes that every parent should be able to stay close to their child when they are admitted to hospital.\n\nWe welcome any feedback.
