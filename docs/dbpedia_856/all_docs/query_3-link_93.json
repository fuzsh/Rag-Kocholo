In Proceedings of the Terminology and Artificial Intelligence conference (TIA 2013), in press]\n\nLexical variants: lexical variants are defined as those variants that are semantically coincident but formally different, and which are mainly motivated by grammatical requirements, style (Wortklang), and linguistic economy (helping to avoid excessive denominative repetition and improving textual coherence)\n\nOrthographic variants\n\nDiatopic variants (e.g., local-ize vs. localise)\n\nDiachronic variants (e.g., different scripts for languages such as Azeri)\n\nIdeographic variants (e.g., in Japanese both “寿司” and “鮨” are used for sushi)\n\nAffixal variants\n\nDerivational variants (e.g., adjective -> adverb variation: quick vs. quickly)\n\nInflexional variants (e.g., adjective agreement: rojo, roja, rojos, rojas)\n\nMorphosyntactic variants\n\nCompounds (e.g., ecological tourism vs. eco-tourism)\n\nAbbreviations (including ac-ronyms, among others. E.g., peer to peer and p2p; WYSWYG, FAO, UNO, etc.)\n\nRephrasing variants (e.g., immigration law vs. law for regulating and controlling immigration)\n\nTerminological variants: variants that are not only formally, but also semantically different, and this difference is intentionally caused. In this type of terminological variants, the denomination or term itself is a clear indicator of the reasons or causes for variation. These reasons can be the origins of the authors, in the case of diatopic variants; the different communicative registers, in the case of diaphasic variants (also termed functional variants); the stylistic or expressive needs of the authors, as for the so-called diastratic variants; and the different conceptualizations, approaches or perspectives underlying them, in what we have termed dimensional variants.\n\nThis variation can be within one language or across languages.\n\nDiatopic (dialectal or geographical variants) (e.g., gasoline vs. petrol)\n\nDiaphasic (register) (e.g., headache and cephalalgia; swine flu and pig flu and H1N1 and Mexican pandemic flu)\n\nDiachronic (or chronological variants) (e.g., tuberculosis and phthisis)\n\nDiastratic (discursive or stylistic vari-ants) (e.g., man vs. bloke)\n\nDimensional variants: the terms point to the same concept but highlight a different property or dimension of the concept (e.g., biosanitary waste vs. hospital waste; Novel Coronavirus vs. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; obsolete technology vs. dangerous technology)\n\nTranslation variants (to maintain coherence with the classificacion of variants) or (simply) translations: variants thar are mainly caused by different conceptualization and/or motivations, usually in more than one language. We could say that these variants are semantically and formally different, as in the case of terminological variants, but they usually point to concepts which are almost equivalent or culturally equivalent.\n\nCultural equivalent translations: the two variants/translations describe entities that are pragmatically equivalent, since they describe similar situations in different cultures and languages (e.g., Prime Minister in English vs. Presidente del Gobierno in Spanish)\n\nDirect equivalent translation: the two variants describe entities that exist in both cultures and languages (e.g., payment method in English vs. medio de pago in Spanish).\n\nTranslation variants can be further considered as terminological variants. For example, surrogate mother and vientre de alquiler/madre de alquiler can be direct equivalent translations and also dimensional terminological variants. The same happens with online banking/e-banking/internet banking/virtual banking and banca electrónica/banca online.\n\n[From Elena Montiel-Ponsoda, John Mccrae, Guadalupe Aguado-De-Cea and Jorge Gracia.

We could say that these term variants are se-mantically and formally different, as in the case of terminological variants, but they usually point to two closely related, but different, ontological concepts, which means that they are also conceptually different.\n\nVertical (general-specific) variants (e.g., benign neoplasms vs. benign mouse skin tumours)\n\nCross-lingual vertical variants (e.g., river in English vs. rivière and fleuve in French; testamento in Spanish vs. testament and last will in English)\n\nHorizontal variants (counterparts or closest equivalents):\n\nCross-lingual horizontal variants (e.g., Prime Minister in English vs. Presidente del Gobierno in Spanish)\n\nSpecification of Requirements “Properties and relations of lexical entries”(revised synthesis by Elena / Lupe) 31/01/2013\n\nThe ontology-lexicon model must allow for the representation of relations between lexical entries within the same language, and relations between lexical entries in different languages.\n\nDepending on the type of relation, the ontology-lexicon model must support the representation of the following relations:\n\nRelations between lexical entries pointing to the same sense and to same concept (e.g., cat and cats; FAO and Food and Agriculture Organization)\n\nRelations between lexical entries pointing to different senses, which, in its turn, point to the same concept (e.g., man and bloke; gasoline and petrol; Panettone and bizcocho italiano; École normale and French Normal School).\n\nRelations between lexical entries pointing to different senses, which, in its turn, point to different concepts -which sometimes are in a subclassOf relation- (e.g., religious building and mosque; MRSA and hospital-acquired MRSA; river and rivière/fleuve; esquina and rincón in Spanish, and corner in English; catedrático and full professor)\n\nBy allowing all these representation possibilities, the ontology-lexicon model would cater for the following set of lexical, terminological and semantic relations:\n\nLexical variants (to represent as 1)\n\nOrthographic variants\n\nDiatopic variants (localize and localise)\n\nDiachronic variants (different scripts for Azeri)\n\nSemantic-orthographic variants (toru in Japanese)\n\nMorphological variants\n\nAffixal variants\n\nDerivational variants\n\nInflexional variants\n\nCompounds (ecological tourism and eco-tourism)\n\nAbbreviations (including acronyms, among others.

Diatopic variants (as a type of orthographic variant)\n\nhttp://wordnet.rkbexplorer.com/id/synset-theater-noun-1. This diatopic variant is not captured as such in Wordnet, but the relation between the American (theater) and the British variant (theatre) is related by means of the relation “wordnet:containsWordSense” (and the same happens between “theatre” and “house”, e.g., the house is full). And in DBpedia it is informally captured in the definition.\n\nExample in RDF:\n\n# See also: lemon cookbook examples 1, 5, 8 and 26, http://www.isocat.org/rest/dc/3669 # NOTE: we are doing the assumption here that \"en-gb\" and \"en-usa\" are the same language @base <http://www.example.org/myExampleLexicon> @prefix dbpedia: <http://dbpedia.org/page/> @prefix dbpedia-es: <http://es.dbpedia.org/page/> @prefix lemon: <http://www.monnetproject.eu/lemon#> @prefix wn: <http://wordnet.rkbexplorer.com/id/> @prefix isocat: <http://www.isocat.org/datcat/> @prefix biontology-icd: <http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/ICD9CM/> @prefix biontology-medra: <http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/MDR/> :myExampleLexicon a lemon:Lexicon ; lemon:language \"en\" ; lemon:entry :theatre . :theatre a lemon:LexicalEntry ; lemon:sense [ lemon:reference wn:synset-theater-noun-1 ] .\n\nOption 1 (same lexical entry, different language tags):\n\n:theatre lemon:canonicalForm [ lemon:writtenRep \"theater\"@en-us ; lemon:writtenRep \"theatre\"@en-gb ]\n\nOption 2 (lexical variant between lexical entries, same reference):\n\n:theatre a lemon:LexicalEntry ; lemon:sense [ lemon:reference wn:synset-theater-noun-1 ] ; lemon:form [ lemon:writtenRep \"theatre\"@en-gb ] . :theater a lemon:LexicalEntry ; lemon:sense [ lemon:reference wn:synset-theater-noun-1 ] ; lemon:form [ lemon:writtenRep \"theater\"@en-us ] . :theater lemon:lexicalVariant :theatre . :diatopicVariant rdfs:subPropertyOf lemon:lexicalVariant ; :theater :diatopicVariant :theatre .\n\nNOTE: 'diatopicVariant' does not exist in lemon.

Compounds (as a type of morphological (?) variant)\n\nhttp://dbpedia.org/page/Ecotourism. When looking for Ecological tourism in DBpedia, you are redirected to the page of Ecotourism (Turismo ecológico in Spanish). The relation between \"Ecological tourism\" and \"Ecotourism\" in DBpedia is “dbpedia-owl:wikPageRedirects”.\n\nExample in RDF:\n\n:ecotourism a lemon:LexicalEntry ; lemon:sense [ lemon:reference dbpedia:Ecotourism ] . # Lexical variant between lexical entries: :ecotourism a lemon:LexicalEntry ; lemon:sense [ lemon:reference dbpedia:Ecotourism ] ; lemon:form [ lemon:writtenRep \"Ecotourism\"@en ] ; :ecological_tourism a lemon:LexicalEntry ; lemon:sense [ lemon:reference dbpedia:Ecotourism ] ; lemon:form [ lemon:writtenRep \"Ecological tourism\"@en ] ; :compoundVariant rdfs:subPropertyOf lemon:lexicalVariant ; :ecological_tourism :compoundVariant :ecotourism .\n\nNOTE: 'compoundVariant' does not exist in lemon.\n\nComment-02\n\n3.

Diachronic variants (as a type of terminological variant)\n\nhttp://dbpedia.org/page/Tuberculosis. When looking for phthisis in DBpedia, you are redirected to the page of tuberculosis, but the relation between these two terms is not explicitly stated. In WordNet, however, there is an entry for tuberculosis (http://wordnet.rkbexplorer.com/id/synset-tuberculosis-noun-1), and another one for phthisis (http://wordnet.rkbexplorer.com/id/wordsense-phthisis-noun-1), but they are not explicitly linked. Tuberculosis is linked with TB and T.B. by means of the “wordnet:containsWordSense” relation.\n\nExample in RDF:\n\n# See also lemon cookbook example 9, http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-505, http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-506 # NOTE: in lemon, hiddenRef represents a term that is not used for various reasons (for example it is antiquated) :tuberculosis a lemon:LexicalEntry ; lemon:form [ lemon:writtenRep \"pulmonary tuberculosis\"@en ] :phthisis a lemon:LexicalEntry ; lemon:form [ lemon:writtenRep \"phthisis\"@en ]\n\nOption 1 (one lexical entry is preferred and the other hidden; this example does not work for two different references):\n\nbiontology-icd:011 lemon:prefRef :tuberculosis_sense . :tuberculosis_sense lemon:isSenseOf :tuberculosis . biontology-icd:011 lemon:hiddenRef :phthisis_sense . :phthisis_sense lemon:isSenseOf :phthisis .\n\nOption 2 (senses are related; in this example we put two different references):\n\nbiontology-icd:011 lemon:isReferenceOf :tuberculosis_sense . :tuberculosis_sense lemon:isSenseOf :tuberculosis . biontology-medra:011 lemon:isReferenceOf :phthisis_sense . :phthisis_sense lemon:isSenseOf :phthisis . :diachronicVariant rdfs:subpropertyOf lemon:senseRelation . :phthisis_sense :diachronicVariant :tuberculosis_sense .\n\nOption 3 (“obsolete” is an attribute of the sense)\n\nbiontology-icd:011 lemon:isReferenceOf :tuberculosis_sense [ lemon:isSenseOf :tuberculosis] . biontology-icd:011 lemon:isReferenceOf :phthisis_sense [ lemon:isSenseOf :phthisis] . isocat:temporalQualifier rdfs:subPropertyOf lemon:property :phthisis_sense isocat:temporalQualifier isocat:obsoleteForm .\n\nComment-04 COMMENT: Is it better to define isocat:temporalQualifier as a subclass of lemon:context ?\n\nCOMMENT: What about defining :diachronicVariant as a lemon:lexicalVariant between lexical entries? or isocat:temporalQualifier as attribute of lexical entry? (same for isocat:geographicalUsage in the next example)\n\n5. Diatopic variants (as a type of terminological variant)\n\nhttp://dbpedia.org/page/Trade_union. DBpedia has many redirects (labor union, labor unions, labor organizations, etc.) to the main page \"Sindicato\". Another example of a diatopic variant is represented by maize and corn. In AGROVOC they are related by means of the \"altLable\" relation (see http://aims.fao.org/aos/agrovoc/c_12332).\n\nExample in RDF:\n\n# See also http://www.isocat.org/datcat/DC-243 :gasoline a lemon:LexicalEntry ; lemon:form [ lemon:writtenRep \"gasoline\"@en ] . :petrol a lemon:LexicalEntry ; lemon:form [ lemon:writtenRep \"petrol\"@en ] . # 'GeographicalUsage' is created as an attribute of the sense isocat:geographicalUsage rdfs:subPropertyOf lemon:context . :gasoline_sense lemon:reference http://dbpedia.org/page/Gasoline ; lemon:isSenseOf :gasoline ; isocat:geographicalUsage “en-usa”. :petrol_sense lemon:reference http://dbpedia.org/page/Gasoline ; lemon:isSenseOf :gasoline ; isocat:geographicalUsage “en-gb”. # a relation 'diatopicVariant' is established between senses :gasoline_sense lemon:reference http://dbpedia.org/page/Gasoline ; lemon:isSenseOf :gasoline . :petrol_sense lemon:reference http://dbpedia.org/page/Gasoline ; lemon:isSenseOf :gasoline . :diatopicVariant rdfs:subpropertyOf lemon:senseRelation . :gasoline_sense :diatopicVariant :petrol_sense\n\nComment-05\n\n6. Diaphasic variants (as a type of terminological variant)\n\nhttp://dbpedia.org/page/Tuberculosis. DBpedia has many redirects (phthisis, primary tuberculosis, secondary tuberculosis, etc.) to the main page \"Tuberculosis\". The same happens with Bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The dbpedia page has many redirects mad cow disease (http://dbpedia.org/page/Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy)\n\n7.

Cultural equivalence translations (as a type of terminological variant)\n\nE.g., presidente del gobierno <-> prime minister\n\nSummary on Requirements on Properties and Relations of Entries (Synthesis by Elena / Lupe)\n\nDistinction between Multilingual + Cross-lingual\n\nMultilingual labeling approach: In a multilingual labeling approach, we have a single conceptual structure, and we provide alternative labeling information in the ontology-lexicon model for each of the languages covered (in the same language or in different languages). This is possible whenever the languages covered share a single view on a certain domain. In this case, there will always be one or several labels in each natural language for naming or terming the concepts in the ontology.\n\nCross-lingual linking or mapping approach: In this second scenario, there exist two independent monolingual ontologies, defined in different languages, but covering the same or similar subject domain. We aim at establishing links between the labels that describe the two ontologies. The establishment of these cross-lingual links could derive in cross-lingual ontology mappings. In this scenario, the conceptual structure of each ontology is modeled independently, and “linguistic links” or “mappings” can be established between the two.\n\nCross-lingual equivalence relations, as in the multilingual labeling scenario. These would establish a relation between concepts that are not exactly the same (do not have the same intension and/or extension), but are close equivalents, because no exact equivalent exists. Example: full professor in English – catedrático in Spanish – Professor in German. In order to distinguish them from the cross-lingual equivalents in the multilingual labeling scenario, we could term them: cross-lingual close equivalents? Cross-lingual near equivalents? Suggestions are welcome!!\n\nCross-lingual broad (narrow) equivalence relations. These would establish a relation between concepts with different levels of granularity. This usually happens when one culture understands a concept or phenomenon with a higher granularity than the other, i.e., one culture has two or more concepts (and in its turn, terms for naming them) to describe the same phenomenon. Example: river in English – rivière and fleuve in French; Tötung in German – asesinato and homicidio in Spanish. Here again, suggestions for better examples are welcome. In the case no equivalent exists, we could still provide a term or description, using for this a mixed scenario, i.e., providing some labels or lexical entries for the concept we do not find an equivalent term in the other ontology, as in the multilingual labeling approach. For this, we consider two options:\n\nLiteral translation relations. These are translations of terms that describe concepts that do not exist in the target language, and for which a literal or “word for word translation” is provided so that the concept is understood by the target language. Example: École normal in French– (French) Normal School in English; Presidente del Gobierno in Spanish – President of the Government in English.\n\nDescriptive translation relations. These are translations of terms that describe concepts that do not exist in the target language, and for which a description or definition (and not a term) is provided in the target language. Example: Panetone in Italian – bizcocho italiano que se consume en Nochevieja in Spanish. In this case, we could also opt for repeating the Italian Word plus the gloss.\n\nClassification of relationships\n\nAs proposed by Lupe + Elena\n\nSynomyms or terminological units that totally correspond to the same concept:\n\ngraphical and orthographical variants (localization and localisation);\n\ninflectional variants (cat and cats);\n\nmorphosyntactic variants (nitrogen fixation and fixation of nitrogen).\n\nPartial synonyms or terminological units that highlight different aspects of the same concept:\n\nstylistic or connotative variants (man and bloke)\n\ndiachronic variants (tuberculosis and phthisis)\n\ndialectal variants (gasoline vs. petrol)\n\npragmatic or register variants (headache and cephalalgia; swine flu and pig flu and H1N1 and Mexic pandemic flu)\n\nexplicative variants (immigration law and law for regulating and controlling immigration)\n\nAs proposed by John\n\nLexical variants\n\nOrthographic variants\n\nHistorical Orthographic variants. e.g., different scripts such as for Azeri (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijani_alphabet)\n\nGeo-orthographic variants. e.g., \"localize\" vs. \"localise\"\n\nSemantic-orthographics variants. e.g., \"取る\" (toru - \"to take (remove from a location)\") vs \"撮る\" (toru - \"to take (a photo)\")\n\nSingle lexeme morphological variation\n\nPluralization\n\nVerb form inflection\n\nComparatives and superlatives\n\nMulti-lexeme variation\n\nCompounds, e.g., \"wirtschaftliche Wissenschaft\" vs. \"Wirtschaftswissenschaft\"; \"ecological tourism\" -> \"eco-tourism\"\n\nRephrasing: e.g., \"cancer of the mouth\" vs. \"mouth cancer\"\n\nAffixial Derivation (e.g., Nominalization): e.g., \"lexicon\", \"lexical\", \"lexicalize\"; \"happy\" -> \"happiness\"\n\nPleonasm: \"tuna\" vs \"tuna fish\"\n\nAbbreviation: e.g., AIDS..... Philipp> Any variation has some (sight) pragmatic implication, abbreviation for me is morphosyntactic as the motivation is brevity rather than connotation.\n\nTerminological variants\n\nPragmatic Variants\n\nstylistic or connotative variants (man and bloke)\n\ndiachronic variants (tuberculosis and phthisis)\n\ndialectal variants (gasoline vs. petrol)\n\npragmatic or register variants (headache and cephalalgia; swine flu and pig flu and H1N1 and Mexic pandemic flu)\n\nCircumlocutive variants\n\nexplicative variants (immigration law and law for regulating and controlling immigration)\n\nSemantic variants\n\nNon-synonymous variants\n\nModification: \"MRSA\", vs \"hospital-acquired MRSA\"\n\nHypernym/Hyponymy/Antonymy\n\nCross-lingual narrowing/broadening: \"river\" vs \"rivière/fleuve\"\n\nCase for merging properties and relations requirement\n\nThe reasoning is that it seems that the definition of relations relies heavily on the definition of properties. i.e., to model geographical variants, register variants or diachronic variants, we need to be able to state the geographical, register or diachronic properties of the two variants. As such we can think of variation in terms of the properties that vary and those that do not. Put more clearly, variants are entries that are similar (have the same property values) except for some property, e.g., translation is variation in language, pluralization is variation in number, etc."
