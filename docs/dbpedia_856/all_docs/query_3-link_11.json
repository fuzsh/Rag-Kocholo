        "text": "Overview\n\nWhat is wordnet?\n\nUnlike a standard dictionary, which takes the word as its elementary building block, a wordnet is an online lexical reference system which is organized by concepts.\n\nThe basic building block of a wordnet is Synonym set (Synset), a group of words that can all refer to the same concept, such as shut and close or car and automobile. Words and synsets are linked by means of conceptual-semantic relations in wordnet.\n\nThe core conceptual-semantic relations among synsets are called Constitutive relations, such as:\n\nSuper-subordinate relation (hypernym and hyponym)\n\nPart-whole relation (meronym and holonym)\n\nSemantic contract and similar relation (antonym and synonym)\n\nSynsets are connected into a net framework to form the structure of wordnet, you can refer to this document for the details of Constitutive and other types of relations.\n\nCurrently, Princeton Wordnet of English is the most complete and accurate wordnet, and is commonly used as a reference for other wordnets. You can also visit Princeton Wordnet project homepage to learn more of this wordnet.\n\nOpen Multilingual Wordnet (OMW) is a collection of wordnets in a variety of languages, all linked through the Collaborative Interlingual Index (CILI), the goal is to make it easy to use wordnets across multiple languages, you can browse and search for cross-lingual matches in OMW.\n\nWhat is Global Wordnet Association?\n\nThe Global WordNet Association (GWA) is a free, public and non-commercial organization that provides a platform for discussing, sharing and connecting semantic lexicons (wordnets) for all languages in the world. Our goal is to make compatible, linked, open lexical resources useful for both humans and computers.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nRelations\n\nConstitutive (constitutive)back to top\n\n\"Core semantic relations that define synsets\"\n\napplicability (not directly applicable) example Contribute an example\n\nDefinition\n\nCore semantic relations that define synsets.\n\nWe follow the discussion in [Maziarz:Piasecki:Szpakowicz:2013]\n\n[Maziarz:Piasecki:Szpakowicz:2013]The chicken-and-egg problem in wordnet design: synonymy, synsets and constitutive relations.

Consider domestic ⇔ national ⇔ international: it does not follow that domestic ⇔ international, or sister ⇔ brother ⇔ sister does not imply sister ⇔ sister.\n\nExamples\n\nman has antonym woman\n\nsuperior has antonym inferior\n\nbuy has antonym sell\n\nnorthen has antonym southern\n\nhomosexual has antonym heterosexual\n\nsister has antonym brother\n\nTests\n\nAntonym-relation between nouns (EWN 16)\n\nyes a A and B are both a kind of C but A is the opposite of B . b the converse of (a)\n\nConditions:\n\nA and B are singular or plural nouns\n\nC is a hyperonym of both A and C and within a reasonable, competitive denotational range.\n\nAntonym-relation between verb (EWN 17)\n\nyes a If something/someone/it As then something/someone/it does not B . b If something/someone/it Bs then something/someone/it does not A)\n\nConditions:\n\nA is a synset variant in the third person singular form\n\nB is a synset variant in the third person singular form\n\nA and B are members of co-hyponym synsets\n\nthere is a hyperonym of A which is opposite to a hyperonym of B\n\nthe situation referred to by A has an addressee and the addressee is the protagonist of the situation referred to by B\n\nAntonym-relation between verbs and adjectives (or adverbs) EWN 20\n\nyes a If something/someone/it As then something/someone/it is not B . b If something/someone/it is B then something/someone/it does not A\n\nConditions:\n\nA is a verb in the third person singular form\n\nB is an adjective\n\nA and B are (XPOS) co-hyponyms\n\nComments\n\nIt is primarily a relation between senses, but sense level antonymy implies a looser synset level relation, which we automatically add to make it avaiable for wordnets that do not yet have sense level links.\n\nplWordnet distinguishes between 'conversion' which is the same relationship form different points of vie, like wife and husband and normal antonymy, (plwordnet p27), proper and complementary antonymy.\n\nXML\n\nIn the XML format for Wordnet LMF the relation should be shown like this:\n\n<Synset id=\"wn-synset-A\" ili=\"iXYZ\" partOfSpeech=\"x\"> <SynsetRelation relType=\"antonym\" target=\"wn-synset-B\"/> </Synset>\n\n<Sense id=\"wn-sense-A\" synset=\"wn-synset-A\"> <SenseRelation relType=\"antonym\" target=\"wn-sense-B\"/> </Sense>\n\nProject-specific Names\n\nPrinceton WordNet Relation Name antonym Princeton WordNet Pointer !

A classifier is a word (or often a bound morpheme) which accompanies a noun in certain grammatical contexts, typically individuation, and generally reflects some kind of conceptual classification of nouns, based principally on features of their referents. Thus a language might have one classifier for nouns representing persons, another for nouns representing flat objects, another for nouns denoting periods of time, and so on. The assignment of classifier to noun may also be to some degree unpredictable, with certain nouns taking certain classifiers by historically established convention.\n\nNote that the in a classifier language a classifier does not introduce a new referent, so we treat it as as non-referential.\n\nExamples\n\nhead classifies cattle\n\nrasher classifies bacon\n\nekor classifiers kucil (Indonesian)\n\n匹 classifies 猫 (Japanese)\n\nContribute test\n\nComments\n\nThis relation was introduced in [DaCosta:Bond:2016]\n\n[DaCosta:Bond:2016]Luis Morgado Da Costa, Francis Bond (2016) Wow!
