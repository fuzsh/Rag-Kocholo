        "text": "If I understand correctly, you are mainly interested in knowing if a given word can be mapped to a general category of Human, Organization, etc.\n\nYou should use WordNet, which provides a complete hierarchy of the general English lexicon. Try it a bit in the user interface to get of feel of how it works.\n\nWordNet encodes relations between words. One of these relation is hypernymy, a fancy word that means a relation of general-to-particular.\n\nSome examples:\n\nVehicle is a hypernym of boat.\n\nVehicle is a hypernem of car.\n\nHuman is a hypernym of worker which is a hypernym of plumber.\n\nHyponymy is the inverse relation of hypernymy:\n\nBoat is a hyponym of vehicle.\n\nCar is a hyponym of vehicle.\n\nPlumber is a hyponym of worker, itself a hyponym of human.\n\nThese relations are transitive, so in my last example plumber is also a hyponym of human. This gives you the solution to your problem: any word that has human as hypernym should be mapped to Human and have people attributes.\n\nThere are libraries to access WordNet from Java and Python, as well as from many other languages. Here is the documentation for using WordNet with the NLTK Python module.\n\nA short example to determine if a word is hyponym of \"human\""
