        "text": "Nouns\n\nThis is a major word class but, oddly, sometimes neglected on the basis that all languages have nouns so there can't be much to talk about. The first part is true, the second much more debatable.\n\nYou may have seen nouns referred to in some analyses as substantives but that is a rather old-fashioned term we will avoid.\n\nIf this is your first visit feel free to take things as they come. Alternatively, here's a guide to the contents.\n\nClicking on -top- at the end of each section will bring you back to this menu.\n\nIdentifying nouns Forming nouns Verbal nouns and gerunds The functions of nouns Classifying nouns Which classification? Count nouns Types of nouns Mass nouns Proper nouns Collective nouns Classifier nouns Compound nouns Shell nouns Mass vs. count Summary of mass and count Misleading learners Markedness in nouns Plural markers Nouns and determiners Idiomatic uses\n\nIdentifying nouns\n\nThat's easy. Nouns are labels for things, aren't they? Well, yes and no. Which of the following would you classify as a noun? Click on the table when you have an answer.\n\nAll of the above bar the word cultural can be nouns.\n\nSome can also function as verbs so, from the table above we can also have:\n\nHe is painting\n\nSmile!\n\nI wanted to capture it alive\n\nIt punctured the tyre\n\nHe's tabling a new motion\n\nSome nouns (most, in fact) can also function grammatically as a type of adjective called a classifier. The difference between a classifier and an adjective proper is that a classifier refers to the type of noun we are modifying and an adjective describes it.\n\nFrom the list in the table, we can have the following as classifiers, i.e., adjectival in some way:\n\nShe went to painting classes\n\nThis is an organisation issue\n\nWhat's the departure point?\n\nWhat's the estimated arrival time?\n\nHe's famous for his table talk\n\nat what point a noun acting to modify another noun as a classifier shades into a noun compounding with another is often unclear. For example, table talk might be considered a compound of two nouns rather than the noun table classifying the type of talk.\n\nForm is not a reliable guide. Although there are a number of suffixes which denote a noun (-ity, -ness, -ment-, -tion, -hood etc.), there are others whose function is less obvious (wishful, vs. handful, -ure and -al endings, e.g., leisure, investiture, chemical, pharmaceutical etc.). See the next section for how nouns are formed.\n\nIn addition, not all nouns inflect for their plurals and some have no plural forms.\n\nThe only reliable guide to identifying nouns is not by looking at them, it's by seeing what they do.\n\nForming nouns\n\nBecause nouns are so central to any language, it will be unsurprising to find that there are many ways in which they are formed. Some nouns, of course, most, in fact, are simple nouns, not formed from other words and having no obvious features identifying them as nouns. There is nothing, for example, about the form of words like:\n\nhouse, car, problem, screen, key, joy, sky, place\n\netc. which allows us to identify them as nouns. Only seeing what they do in the syntax of the language allows us to classify them accurately.\n\nOther nouns are, however, clearly derived from words in other classes. Here's a short list of the most frequent and obvious ways nouns are formed by suffixation in English:\n\n-age\n\nThis suffix refers to a generalised noun derived from a particular case of another. Examples are:\n\ndrainage, leafage, percentage, package, parentage etc.\n\nThe suffix is also used to form nouns from verbs, again referring to a generalised concept from the verb, as in:\n\ncarriage, assemblage, marriage, towage, passage etc.\n\nIn fact, most words ending in -age are nouns and that is a helpful guide to learners.\n\n-al\n\nThis suffix is usually one which forms adjectives but these can be converted into nouns such as:\n\nmusical, national, original, neutral, criminal etc.\n\nQuite rarely, the suffix is used to form nouns from verbs as in, e.g.:\n\ndismissal, portrayal, deferral, refusal etc.\n\nMost words ending in -al are not nouns, however. The way to bet is that they are adjectives.\n\n-an, -ant, -crat, -ee,-eer, -er, -ist, -ite, -or, -ster\n\nAll these noun-forming suffixes refer to people in favour of something, the doer of a verb or a person concerned with a field of enquiry. The most common is -er which forms new nouns readily from verbs. Others, such as -al and -or are no longer productive. For example:\n\ndisciplinarian, vegetarian, republican, historian, inhabitant, participant, democrat, technocrat, escapee, employee, engineer, mountaineer, gardener, speaker, Marxist, fascist, socialite, actor, doctor, mobster, gangster etc.\n\nThe -ite ending is widely used in geology to describe types of minerals and rocks as in dolerite, anthracite, malachite and many more.\n\n-ate\n\nThis is a rare noun-forming suffix and usually forms causal verbs such as truncate, desiccate and so on but it can be used to form a noun from another as in, e.g.:\n\ndoctorate, subordinate, graduate, sophisticate etc.\n\nIt is also frequently used to denote chemical derivatives such as:\n\nphosphate, carbonate, silicate etc.\n\n-ation, -cation, -sion, -tion\n\nThese are variations on a theme, all ending in -ion. They readily form nouns from verbs such as:\n\nreplication, organisation, deification, electrification, decision, conversion, devotion, notation etc.\n\nAlmost all words ending in -ion are nouns of some description.\n\n-ery (and -ory), -ry\n\nThese suffixes are now almost fully unproductive but are used to signal an activity or the place where an activity takes place. Examples are:\n\nbrewery, bakery, conservatory, observatory, surgery, upholstery, hostelry, colliery etc.\n\n-ese\n\nThis suffix is mostly confined to people or types of language and is sometimes used to invent new terms such as:\n\nJapanese, Maltese, computerese, managementese, bureaucratese, teacherese etc.\n\nThis suffix is sometimes replaced by -speak as in BBC-speak, IT-speak, Cambridge-speak etc.\n\n-ess\n\nThis suffix was frequently used to form female versions of male nouns so we used to have, e.g.:\n\nstewardess, hostess, manageress, actress etc.\n\nHowever, times change and the ending is now often disparaged as sexist language so all of the above, shorn of the ending can be used to describe people of either (or all) sex(es).\n\nFor non-human nouns, the suffix is still in frequent use, however, and we still encounter, e.g.:\n\ntigress, lioness, goddess etc.\n\nEven for humans, some -ess suffixes are still in common use for want of a better expression so we still encounter, e.g.:\n\nduchess, marchioness, princess, seamstress etc.\n\nA range of nouns have alternative male / female forms and they include, e.g.:\n\ngoose / gander, duck / drake, king / queen, sister / brother, uncle / aunt and a host more.\n\nSee the guide to gender, linked below, and the section in this guide on markedness, for more about sex marking on nouns.\n\n-ful\n\nThis suffix often forms adjectives but has a noun-forming function to denote quantities such as:\n\nhandful, bottleful, carful, houseful etc.\n\n-hood, -ship\n\nThese suffixes refer to a stage in life or a condition such as:\n\nboyhood, adulthood, falsehood, childhood, neighbourhood, township, friendship, comradeship, guardianship etc.\n\n-ism, -ocracy, -ology, -aphy, -apy\n\nThese are all to do with political or moral positions or fields of academia such as:\n\nMarxism, Trumpism, democracy, autocracy, sociology, biology, geography, therapy etc.\n\n-ity\n\nThis suffix is used to derive nouns from adjectives ending in -ible and -able and words are often coined for the nonce with this suffix. For example:\n\navailability, divisibility, permissibility, doability, pickupability, burnability etc.\n\n-let, -ette\n\nThese are confined to marking another noun for size such as:\n\nleaflet, eyelet, kitchenette, launderette etc.\n\n-man / -woman\n\nBoth these suffixes denote the doer of an action and are formed from verbs. Just like the -ess suffix, however, the forms are now often disparaged as sexist language so are less productive than they once were. We still encounter, e.g.:\n\nlaundryman / laundrywoman, fisherman / fisherwoman, spokesman / spokeswoman, countryman / countrywoman, businessman / businesswoman and more.\n\nSee the guide to gender, linked below, and the section in this guide on markedness, for more about sex marking on nouns.\n\n-ment, -ness\n\nBoth these are productive suffixes denoting the state of being in a position or having a quality. For example:\n\ndiscernment, management, disappointment, happiness, gratefulness, forgiveness etc.\n\n-ware\n\nThis is a suffix derived from the old word ware meaning an item for sale, now only seen in the plural. It is still productive and the term in computing of software is only attested from 1960. Other terms such as spyware, bloatware and so on are even more recent.\n\nVerbal nouns, deverbal nouns and gerunds\n\nMissing from the list above is the ubiquitous -ing suffix used to form nouns. Adding that suffix to a verb can often form words which appear to be nouns (and sometimes are) but which also retain some verbal qualities. For example, in:\n\nDriving when you are tired is dangerous\n\nwe have the gerund form driving which is operating as a noun and is the subject of the copular verb, be.\n\nIt does, however, retain some features normally associated with verbs because:\n\nIt may be followed by a direct object:\n\nDriving cars when you are tired is dangerous\n\nIt may be modified by an adverb phrase rather than an adjective:\n\nDriving too quickly is dangerous\n\nIt cannot be pluralised so we do not allow *drivings.\n\nOther formations are better described a verbal nouns or deverbal nouns because they have lost some or all verbal qualities and function grammatically just as other nouns do.\n\nVerbal nouns retain some verb-like qualities but deverbal nouns are just nouns.\n\nFor example, in:\n\nThe old buildings are dangerous\n\nwe have a noun, building, derived from the verb build which does not show any verbal qualities (in this case) so:\n\nIt cannot be used with a direct object so we do not allow:\n\n*The building the houses took a long time\n\nand need to insert an of phrase to make the connection as in:\n\nThe building of the houses took a long time\n\nIt is modified by two adjectives, one attributive and one predicative (old and dangerous) and it cannot be modified by an adverb so we can't have:\n\n*The building slowly took too long\n\nIt can be pluralised just like nearly all nouns by adding -s to the stem allowing buildings.\n\nIn the list above, there are other ways of making verbal nouns using a variety of suffixes.\n\nThe distinction, briefly, is that gerunds retain considerable verb-like features but verbal nouns operate as all other nouns and have lost any verbal characteristics.\n\nThe situation is not clear cut, however, and there is a cline from the gerund forms which retain verb-like characteristics and the pure nominal forms which are noun-like in their behaviour. The situation is:\n\nFor more on the distinction between participle verb forms, gerunds, verbal and deverbal nouns, see the guide to catenative verbs, linked below.\n\n-top-\n\nHow nouns function\n\nHere are some nouns being nouns. Can you identify the grammatical function of each word in black? Click here when you have done that.\n\nHow do you feel about it, Mary?\n\nThat's John, the boss.\n\nIt looks like a crab.\n\nThey made her the manager.\n\nThe inspector is arriving tomorrow.\n\nShe is inspecting the organisation.\n\nThe animal is a crab.\n\nWho gave the children the food?\n\nI brought it for the staff.\n\nThe window catch is broken.\n\nHere, the Proper noun, Mary, is functioning as the addressee. It's a vocative use normally only applied to people or animals but can be applied to other nouns although few of us spend any time addressing inanimate objects or abstract concepts.\n\nHere we have a noun in apposition. Functionally, John and the boss are the same thing.\n\nHere the noun a crab is the subject complement of the copular verb look like (the most common true copular verb is, of course, be).\n\nHere, the noun manager is the object complement of the verb.\n\nIn this, the inspector is the subject of verb arrive.\n\nHere, the organisation is the direct object of the verb inspect.\n\nHere the animal is the subject of the copular verb be.\n\nIn this, the children is the indirect object of the verb give.\n\nIn this, the staff is the complement of the preposition for forming a prepositional phrase. In some analyses, this is referred to as the object of the preposition but, in order not to have any confusion between verb objects and prepositional objects, we will stick with the term complement.\n\nThe word window here is acting as a classifier and tells us what sort of catch it is. The distinction between a phrase including a noun classifier (sometimes called a noun adjunct, attributive noun, qualifying noun, noun (pre)modifier, or apposite noun) and a compound noun is fuzzy.\n\nIn summary, to identify a noun we need to look at what it does in the sentence and where it comes. If a word is performing any of the above functions, the way to bet is that it's a noun or noun phrase of some kind.\n\nIf any of the terms above, such as object, subject and indirect object are unfamiliar to you, you can follow a guide to objects and subjects on this site, linked in the list of related guides at the end.\n\nHere's the cut-out-and-keep summary of what nouns do and how to identify them from their grammatical (rather than communicative) function. In the examples, the noun performing the function is in italics.\n\n-top-\n\nClassifying nouns\n\nThe traditional classification\n\nYou may have learned at some time that there are three sorts of nouns. That's a traditional way to divide them, like this:\n\nCommon nouns\n\nabstract (such as love, happiness, envy etc.)\n\nconcrete (such as table, computer, paper etc.)\n\nProper nouns (such as Birmingham, Peter, The Labour Party etc.)\n\nCollective nouns (such as army, flock, family, committee etc.)\n\nSee the note below on the difference between collective and assemblage nouns.\n\nIn summary, the old classification looks like this:\n\nThe classification was based on what we understand the notion of the noun is, not its grammatical function in a sentence.\n\nThis is a classification now considered somewhat out of date and unreliable. Can you think why? Click here when you have an answer.\n\nThe distinction between abstract and concrete nouns is not sustainable. It's clear that happiness does imply an intangible abstract quality but what about a word like smile? Is that an abstract or concrete thing? Something you can touch is clearly a concrete noun but things that you perceive in other ways are not so easily classified.\n\nNouns can slip between categories such as these.\n\nThe noun love may be an abstract in some cases\n\nAll we need is love\n\nbut in other cases, the word is clearly a concrete\n\nHe is one of the loves of her life.\n\nThe noun Jones is clearly a proper noun in, e.g.:\n\nAsk Jones to do it\n\nbut can be a concrete common noun in\n\nAsk the Jones who works in accounts to do it.\n\nThe noun Russia is a proper noun but the noun Russian behaves just like a common noun.\n\nCommon nouns do not all behave in the same way. Some are mass nouns which take no plural forms and occur with singular-form verbs, such as information, furniture, water etc. Some behave very differently and have plural forms such as house, keyboard, window etc.\n\nThis fundamental and critical distinction between count and mass nouns is not one shared by many languages. Those languages which do not make the distinction (or in which the distinction is not grammatically significant) often have simple determiner systems. Speakers of such languages encounter serious problems in this regard when learning English and, in fact, may never internalise the distinction consistently.\n\nThe determiners which work with these two distinct sorts of nouns therefore vary, so we can have, e.g.:\n\nsome milk\n\nsome dogs\n\na few houses\n\netc.\n\nbut we can't have:\n\n*a milk\n\n*a little dogs\n\n*much houses\n\netc.\n\nA more modern classification\n\nMost grammars these days classify nouns into four main categories based not on notions of meaning but on grammatical function. Like this:\n\nThere are two examples of each of the four main types in this list. Click here when you have sorted them into the 4 main categories.\n\nThe crew mutinied.\n\nDo you take milk?\n\nShe climbed Mount Snowdon in the winter.\n\nThe sheep are coming down the hillside.\n\nHe moved the pictures downstairs.\n\nI've never been to Amsterdam.\n\nThe majority were (?was) in favour.\n\nWe keep the china over there.\n\nAnswers:\n\n1 and 7 are collective nouns.\n\n2 and 8 are mass nouns.\n\n3 and 6 are proper nouns.\n\n4 and 5 are count nouns.\n\nFor a little more on how concord works with collective nouns, see the guide to the area, linked below.\n\nIn some analyses, we might add a fifth category, classifiers and partitives, because they exhibit phenomena unique to themselves. Examples are:\n\nClassifiers:\n\nHe drives a sports car\n\nHe works in a steel plant\n\nShe's a reception manager\n\nYou are a language teacher\n\nPartitives:\n\nPass me a bit of bread\n\nUse a length of rope\n\nReplace a pane of glass\n\nI have a pile of papers to get through\n\nThere are separate guides on this site, linked below, to classifiers, partitives and group nouns and to compounding.\n\n-top-\n\nChoosing which classification to use\n\nFor teaching purposes, both classifications have some utility:\n\nThe notional, old-style, classification is useful when meaning is the paramount consideration because the distinctions between common, proper and collective nouns are intuitively easy to grasp and the nouns which fall into these categories (with the exception of the dubious concrete-abstract distinction) exist in all languages and are handled similarly.\n\nThis kind of classification also sits well with communicative approaches because the focus is on notion not structure.\n\nCommon nouns are the most frequently encountered types and, if one distinguishes between mass and count noun uses, follow predictable patterns. Collocational aspects of common nouns are particularly obvious and any number of adjective + noun, verb + noun or noun + verb collocations can be the focus of teaching.\n\nProper nouns are usually subjects or objects of verbs and the only ones with which we use the vocative (addressee) case. Some languages reserve a particular inflexion on the noun to signal this.\n\nFew adjective + noun collocational patterns, bar a few predicative adjectives, are observable with proper nouns at all.\n\nBecause these nouns are nearly always applied to human agents, the range of noun + verb collocations is predictable and teachable.\n\nMost proper nouns do not take article determiners although the system is, as we shall see, frustratingly irregular.\n\nCollective nouns need to be distinguished from assemblage nouns (which are analysed in the guide to partitives and classifiers (linked below)).\n\nCollective nouns proper are those in which it is clear what the individual members are so we do not often need the of-construction. We can refer, therefore, to\n\nan army\n\na congregation\n\na committee\n\nmy family\n\nand so on.\n\nAssemblage nouns, on the other hand, follow a predictable pattern: assembly noun + of + plural common noun + singular verb as in, e.g.:\n\na bunch of bananas was on the table\n\na crowd of schoolchildren was waiting\n\na queue of customers is outside\n\na pod of whales was seen\n\netc. although, in informal, casual speech, plural verb forms are often applied. More on that later.\n\nThe more modern classification is more useful when structure (i.e., colligation) is the focus.\n\nThe same considerations apply to proper and collective nouns (because the categories are retained from the old classification).\n\nThe more modern categorisation allows the focus to be put on mass vs. count properties which is fundamental to understanding how nouns work in English. Other languages often do not handle the concepts in the same way even when the distinction between mass and count nouns is maintained.\n\nThe modern classification can also be helpful when handling meaning because the distinctions between nouns used to encode mass or count ideas can be handled more effectively once the main distinctions have been mastered.\n\n-top-\n\nTypes of nouns: salient features\n\nCount nouns\n\nThis is the largest category in English and includes\n\nmany so-called concrete nouns for people and things:\n\nchild, girl, chair, house, day, pound, piece, part, bit etc.\n\nsome slightly less concrete concepts such as\n\nevent, accident, position, tune, coincidence etc.\n\na small group which have irregular plurals, usually either taken from the language from which they come or from older forms of English:\n\nchildren, data, foci, oxen, mice etc.\n\na subset of the irregular plurals which contains those which have no plural form at all. Often these are the names of animals:\n\nsheep, trout, deer etc.\n\nsome count nouns which occur only in the plural, marked with 's' or not:\n\ncattle, people, vermin, glasses, binoculars, scales, jeans, belongings, clothes, surroundings\n\nYou may see such nouns described as uncountable or mass nouns. They are not. Grammatically, they are followed by a plural verb so, while the use of some may be slightly irregular, they are not mass nouns. Technically, nouns which only occur in the plural (or do so with a meaning distinct from the singular form such as the distinction between arms (weapons) and arm (limb)) are called pluralia tantum forms (the singular of which is plurale tantum).\n\nSome count nouns which appear in different senses as mass nouns:\n\nmade of wood\n\nvs.\n\ncycling through the woods\n\nsome cloths to wipe it with\n\nvs.\n\ncloth is not expensive\n\nSee below on pluralisation for more.\n\nMass nouns\n\nMass nouns are distinguishable because they can act as arguments (e.g., as subjects and objects) in their bare form so we allow, e.g.:\n\nShe gave advice\n\nMoney was helpful\n\nbut not\n\n*They made suggestion\n\n*Coin was heavy\n\nand, of course, because they do not occur in the plural.\n\nIn fact, with two exceptions, count nouns cannot stand without a determiner so, for example:\n\nQ: What shall I clean it with?\n\nA: Water\n\nA: *Brush\n\nThe exceptions are:\n\nThey walked arm in arm (an example of parallelism in which apparently countable nouns are used to refer not to the items themselves but to a concept or relationship in which case they are considered as mass nouns)\n\nCome here, child (a rare vocative use).\n\nMass nouns cannot occur with an indefinite article so we do not allow, e.g.:\n\n*a milk\n\n*an alcohol\n\n*a water\n\n*an oxygen\n\netc.\n\nSee below for some more examples of what is sometimes called idiomatic uses of count nouns without determiners.\n\nMass nouns form the next largest category and include:\n\nabstract qualities:\n\nanger, happiness, significance\n\nThis is not, however, a reliable rule because, for example:\n\nbelief, joy, pleasure, prejudice, suggestion, theory and virtue\n\ncan be or are conventionally used as count nouns.\n\nsubstances:\n\nsilver, iron, water, alcohol\n\nmany nouns formed from verbs (often called gerunds):\n\ntraining, teaching, running\n\n(There are many nouns derived from verbs which are countable such as\n\nkilling, furnishing, greeting, shooting, reading, sweeping, painting\n\netc., and not all nouns which end in -ing are derived directly from verbs such as\n\nouting, thing, stocking, fining, piling, ceiling etc.)\n\nmost infectious diseases\n\nmalaria, flu, pox\n\nbut, oddly, cold is a count noun when it refers to illness but a mass noun when it refers to temperature.\n\nmany mass nouns which, in most other languages, where such differences exist, are count nouns. These include:\n\naccommodation, advice, furniture, information, machinery, money\n\nand many more.\n\ngenerally mass nouns which can sometimes be pluralised in special (often poetic) senses:\n\nthe waters of the Thames\n\nthe wines of France\n\nthe peoples of the Americas\n\nIt is sometimes stated that the use of the indefinite article, a/an, with mass nouns is always prohibited in English so you cannot have, e.g.:\n\n*a water\n\n*a furniture\n\n*a knowledge\n\netc.\n\nAs far as it goes, this is a reasonable rule of thumb for teaching purposes but disguises the truth because it is certainly possible to have, e.g.:\n\na good education is important\n\na knowledge of French is helpful\n\na ridiculous behaviour which is unhelpful\n\na conduct which I can't condone\n\na blanket permission has been granted\n\na produce which is unique to the area\n\na weather which I dislike\n\nbut these are still not instances of the nouns magically becoming count nouns because the instances are quite rare and the plurals of these words are unavailable. Often, as the examples show, the use of the indefinite article is only possible when the noun has been identified as a unique example in some way.\n\nProper nouns\n\nThis is a smaller but troublesome group which includes\n\nPersons: Dr Jekyll, Mr Hyde, Uncle Tom, Mother Nature etc.\n\nPositions: The President, The Pope, The Queen etc. These are only capitalised when a unique reference is assumed.\n\nGeographical entities and buildings: Britain, Germany, Margate, London, Lake Victoria, Jamaica, The Thames, The Suez Canal, Baker Street, St Paul's Cathedral, The Tate Gallery etc.\n\nThe use or not of the article with this group of proper nouns is very irregular. It is:\n\nalmost always used with\n\nrivers, positions, mountain ranges and canals:\n\nThe Panama Canal, The Alps, The Deep South, The Nile\n\nalmost never used with\n\nlakes, countries, islands, streets and cities\n\nLake Geneva, France, Crete, Rome\n\nbut collectives do take the article: The Canaries, The Federal Republic of ... etc.\n\nvariably used with\n\nbuildings and mountains:\n\nThe Guggenheim Museum, Scotland Yard, Mont Blanc, The Eiger\n\nEllipsis of the noun frequently results in the classifier used alone with the article so we get, e.g.:\n\nThe Tate (Gallery), The National (Gallery), The Prado (Gallery), The Guggenheim (Museum) etc.\n\nSome proper nouns are used as collectives and take singular verb forms:\n\nThe Department of State has demanded\n\nThe Home Office has decided\n\netc.\n\nProper nouns may be made plural if there is more than one so we get, e.g.:\n\nWe have two Smiths working here\n\nI spoke to both the Ms Smiths\n\nWhen proper nouns lie in apposition, the genitive 's structure falls on the second part so we get, e.g.:\n\nI saw Mr Smith, my neighbour's dog in the park\n\nCompare that with:\n\nThat's Rover, my neighbour's dog in the park\n\nThe only way to disambiguate the two uses is in speaking where the tone units are, respectively:\n\nI saw Mr Smith my neighbour's | dog in the park\n\nand\n\nThat's Rover | my neighbour's dog | in the park\n\nCollective nouns\n\nThis is quite a small group including nouns like army, navy, crew, family, staff, committee etc.\n\nCollective nouns may be quite specific or operate much more generally so, for example, group may be applied to people, books, cars and a huge range of other entities and words such as crowd, batch, set and so on are equally promiscuous although even with these terms there are restrictions, usually to do with classifying the animate or inanimate.\n\nThe more specific group nouns are better referred to as assemblage nouns and they include items like:\n\npod (whales, dolphins, porpoises)\n\nflock (birds, sheep, goats)\n\nshoal (fish)\n\nsquad (soldiers, sports players)\n\nand so on.\n\nIt is tempting to teach somewhat arcane uses of assemblage nouns, especially, for animals such as:\n\na pace of asses\n\na murder of crows\n\na skulk of foxes\n\na labour of moles\n\nand so on. However, it is a temptation worth avoiding because a) they are not known to many expert and native users of English and b) they are of dubious historical validity, many having been invented by Dame Juliana Berners in the 15th century.\n\nHowever, the guide to classifiers and partitives, linked below, contains a list of the most useful ones which are in general use under its section on assemblages. That includes some specific terms such as:\n\na company of actors\n\na bunch of grapes\n\nand so on.\n\nThere is a complication with this group:\n\nIn British English these grammatically singular nouns are often used with both singular and plural verbs:\n\nthe crew are mutinous\n\nthe committee are undecided\n\nmy family are coming\n\nhis family isn't coming\n\nthe jury is unanimous\n\nthe staff are unhappy\n\nThe use of the verb often depends on how the speaker views the entity.\n\nIf we think of it as a collection of individuals, we prefer the plural verb form.\n\nWhen we are thinking of a single entity, we prefer the singular verb form.\n\nIf there is an internal conflict in the collective, the plural verb form is selected.\n\nIn US usage, a singular verb form is preferred as it is in most languages.\n\nClassifier nouns\n\nSome confusion can be caused when nouns look like adjectives so, for example, in:\n\nThis is a paperback book\n\nit appears that the word paperback is functioning as an adjective to describe the book just as splendid or good operate to describe the book in:\n\nThis is a splendid book\n\nThis is a good book\n\nThe distinction is that a word which simply describes, such as splendid or good, is an epithet but a word which categorises is a classifier and, although they seem to be doing similar jobs in the syntax, they are not.\n\nEpithets can be modified but classifiers rarely can:\n\nThis is an absolutely splendid book\n\nThis is a very good book\n\nvs.:\n\n*This is an absolutely paperback book\n\n*This is a very history book\n\nAdditionally, although epithets can usually be used predicatively as in:\n\nThis book is splendid\n\nThis book is good\n\nit is unnatural or plain wrong to use classifiers this way, usually:\n\n?This book is paperback\n\n*The book is history\n\nFinally, noun classifiers cannot be made comparative or superlative so we allow:\n\nThis is an even more splendid book\n\nThis is the best book\n\nbut we cannot have\n\n*This is a more paperback book\n\nFor more, see the guides to classifiers and adjectives linked below.\n\nCompound nouns\n\nThere is a cline from combinations in which it is clear that the first noun is acting as a classifier and true compound nouns which represent a single concept. For example, in\n\nuniversity teacher\n\nthe first noun serves to classify the second and the stress falls naturally on the second item as it would if the first were an epithet (/ËjuË.nÉª.ËvÉË.sÉª.ti.ËtiË.tÊÉ/). Compare, for example, happy teacher (/ËhÃ¦p.i.ËtiË.tÊÉ/) in which both the adjective and the noun carry stress.\n\nThe same is true for the difference between:\n\nsenior teacher\n\nand\n\nSenior Teacher\n\nin which the first simply implies age or length of service (so the stress falls on the second item) but the second, capitalised version is a job title and the stress falls on the first item (/ËsiË.nÉªÉ.ËtiË.tÊÉ/ vs. /ËsiË.nÉªÉ.ËtiË.tÊÉ/).\n\nAnd in:\n\npicture frame\n\nthe stress falls on the first element (/ËpÉªk.tÊÉ.freÉªm/) and that is an indication of a compound rather than a classifier + noun combination.\n\nAt the proper compound end of the cline we find items such as\n\nbabysitter\n\nwhich is clearly now an accepted compound noun because\n\na) the stress falls on the first element (/ËbeÉª.bi.ËsÉª.tÉ/)\n\nb) the item is written as one word (or, by some, hyphenated)\n\nEach edition of an English-language dictionary is updated regularly to include combinations of classifier + noun (or, indeed epithet + noun) which have become accepted compounds. For example, terms such as superglue, gaslight, mouseclick, compact disc, hard drive, toner cartridge and many more were originally stressed on the second element with the first acting as an epithet or classifier. As the terms became more familiar, the stress moved to the first element and the orthography often changed from two words via hyphenation to a one-word spelling.\n\nHyphenation is still variable across users of the language and between dictionaries.\n\nPlurality is sometimes an issue with compound nouns.\n\nOne obvious characteristic of compounds is that when they are plural, the plural marker usually falls on the second element so we get, e.g.:\n\nbeach huts not *beaches hut\n\nchild minders not *children minder\n\ndesk drawers not *desks drawer\n\nIn a lot of cases, of course, the first element is a mass noun which can take no plural so this makes good sense and we find:\n\nwater works\n\nsugar lumps\n\nwater board\n\netc.\n\nSome noun classifiers are, however, irregularly marked for number. We can have:\n\na saloon car\n\nbut\n\na sports car\n\na sports bag\n\nbut\n\na camera bag\n\na complaint form\n\nbut\n\na complaints department\n\nand so on.\n\nThe way to bet is that they are singular so we have\n\nmodel car collection\n\nportrait gallery\n\nlandscape photography\n\nand so on.\n\nLearners who do not have parallel structures in their first languages will often be tempted to make all noun classifiers plural.\n\nShell nouns\n\nParticularly in the field of English for Academic and English for Business areas, there has quite recently been some interest in the concepts of shell nouns. Briefly, what shell nouns do is to encapsulate ideas in a way that makes the noun itself the shell for a set of propositions. For example in:\n\nThe problem is that too many vehicles use the new bypass causing congestion at peak times so the aim is to limit the traffic by improving and extending alternative routes through the suburbs.\n\nwe have two shell nouns, problem and aim which respectively encapsulate the propositions of identifying an issue and seeking a solution.\n\nThe shell noun is usually followed by the proposition that it encapsulates linked either with a that-clause (problem) or just a simple copula such as be (aim).\n\nShell nouns are usually abstract concepts and come in different flavours (from Schmid, 2018, whose list is more detailed and longer):\n\nFactual\n\nFactual shell nouns include, e.g., fact, phenomenon, reason, result, proof, sign, difference, similarity, aspect, part, problem, advantage, drawback and so on into which clauses or very much longer stretches of text are conceptualised.\n\nMental\n\nMental shell nouns include, e.g., idea, theory, mystery, belief, knowledge, view, illusion, doubt, question, disbelief, aim, plan, solution, regret, delight, fear, worry etc.\n\nModal\n\nModal shell nouns express most kinds of modality:\n\nEpistemic (related to truth): possibility, danger, truth, reality\n\nDeontic (related to duty): permission, mission, need\n\nDynamic (related to ability and willingness): ability, capacity, opportunity\n\nIf the terms for modality do not seem familiar and you want to know more, try the guide to types of modality, linked in the list of related guides at the end.\n\nEventive\n\nThese shell nouns include: event, act, situation, attempt, effort, struggle, priority, trouble, problem, success, mistake, situation, context, position, place, time, way, procedure, provision etc.\n\nThe argument is not that the examples above are always shell nouns but that they can act as shell nouns serving to conceptualise things in a way that ordinary content nouns such as beach, happiness, hedge, fruit, money, person, teacher, train and so on cannot.\n\nThe use of shell nouns is particularly common is some kinds of academic texts in which the author is concerned to set up a series of propositions under an overall heading of, e.g., reason, problem, theory, outcome, necessity and so on.\n\nThere is a guide to teaching shell nouns in the EAP section of this site, linked below.\n\nIf you would like a list of potential shell nouns, click here.\n\n-top-\n\nMass or count?\n\nThe distinction made above between mass and count nouns is not an absolute, on-off phenomenon. Moreover, it is not a distinction which has any utility in many other languages. Few languages require their speakers to consider mass vs. count properties of a noun before attaching the grammar to it.\n\nIt has been persuasively suggested that the distinction is not a valid one in English because a large number of nouns can be used in both ways.\n\nThere are a number of related ways in which nouns may cross the borders between mass and count characteristics.\n\nThe general and the particularised\n\nWords such as hair, business, cheese, wine, beer, life, noise, (re)semblance, time etc. are often used as mass nouns but there are occasions when we can singularise the concepts and, indeed, pluralise them. Like this:\n\nMass use Singular or plural use I must get my hair cut\n\nHair loss is my problem There's a hair in my salad\n\nThe police found hairs in the man's car Business is suffering from inflation\n\nBusiness is good just now A business such as mine requires commitment\n\nOpening new businesses requires planning I have an increasingly poor memory\n\nComputer memory is getting cheaper I have a happy memory of growing up in the country\n\nMemories of early childhood are usually unreliable Cheese is an ancient dairy product\n\nCheese goes well with fruit A cheese like this should not be kept in the fridge\n\nI like to offer a range of cheeses in the shop Wine is produced in this area\n\nWine is getting stronger these days Can I offer you a German wine?\n\nWe have a choice of wines Beer is welcome on hot days\n\nBeer is a very ancient discovery I would like a cold beer\n\nThe pub sells 15 different beers Life is difficult\n\nIs there life on Mars? He had a good life\n\nHe wrote a book on the lives of famous scientists Noise is everywhere in big cities\n\nNoise frightens her The central heating is making a worrying noise\n\nShe dislikes loud noises Time is the enemy\n\nTime will tell I remember a time when life was easier\n\nThere are times when I like her She bears some resemblance to her sister\n\nWe have returned to some semblance of normality Look for any family resemblances\n\nWe have returned to a semblance of normality\n\nMany hundreds of nouns can be used in both general (mass) and particular (count) senses. For example, we can ask about the evolution of a language (and that is reference to its development) or we can ask about the evolution of language (which is reference to language as a mass concept, not a particular language).\n\nWe can also speak of the atmosphere in an mass way when making reference to the skin of gases around the earth but we can also use the word countably to refer to multiples of atmospheric pressure.\n\nDistinct meanings\n\nSome words are polysemous and exhibit different (but connected) meanings in mass- and count-noun use.\n\nFor example:\n\nMass use Singular or plural use This cloth is cheap but durable Pass me a clean cloth I enjoy walking in the country There are over 190 countries in the world Dress is formal Why not wear the red dress? The problem is that she has no experience Her experiences as a volunteer will be helpful The wood was too hard to cut easily He took a stroll in the woods Work is scarce in villages The works of Goethe are hard to access\n\nSee also the section below on plural and singular differences (whether mass or count nouns).\n\nPartitive use\n\nAll mass nouns may be made count nouns by the use of a partitive, to which there is a separate guide linked in the list at the end so only two examples of the three major sorts of partitives are given here.\n\nMass use Singular or plural use General partitives Ice is blocking the pipe There a lump of ice blocking the pipe\n\nThe boys threw pieces of concrete on the road Typical partitives The atmosphere was full of dust A cloud of dust came over the house\n\nCloud of mosquitoes followed us everywhere Restricted partitives Wheat grows here He was chewing an ear of wheat\n\nThe farmer inspected the ears of wheat\n\nIn these cases, it is the partitive which can be made plural or is singular, not the noun itself.\n\nPartitives may, of course, also be used with count nouns as in, e.g.:\n\nA pile of chairs\n\nThree heaps of books\n\netc.\n\nThe understood partitive\n\nIn colloquial uses, the partitive is often omitted and the mass noun is used as a count noun which can be singular or plural. This most frequently occurs with typical partitives which refer to the measures of the substance, such as spoonful, pint, glass, bowl, scoop, portion, cup etc., and can be retrieved by the hearer / listener without too much difficulty. For example:\n\nJust one sugar please\n\nTwo or three coffees?\n\nTwo soups, please\n\nThree teas\n\nA beer, please\n\nTwo ice-creams please\n\nThis is not reliable, however, because most mass nouns resist the omission of the partitive and, when the meaning is as a mass noun, we cannot have:\n\n*Three sauces\n\n*A salt\n\n*Three strings\n\n*Three papers\n\n*A bread\n\n*Five bacons\n\n*Two cakes\n\netc. even when the partitive is often quite predictable.\n\nWe can, naturally, use many of these as count nouns but here the focus is on their use as mass nouns.\n\nThe understood mass use\n\nWe know from our knowledge of the article system that a singular mass noun cannot stand without a determiner so while we allow:\n\nHis house was expensive\n\nThe house was sold\n\netc., we do not allow:\n\n*House was sold\n\nWe also know that this restriction does not apply to mass nouns so we allow:\n\nHousing was expensive\n\nas well as\n\nThe housing was expensive.\n\nIt follows, therefore, that if someone uses a usually count noun in the singular without an article or other determiner, the understanding is that a mass use is meant\n\nSo for example, if we say:\n\nAn apple would be a good addition to this\n\nwe are using the noun apple in its usual count-noun guise, but if we say:\n\nApple would be a good addition to this\n\nwe clearly intend that apple is understood as a mass noun.\n\nClassifiers\n\nAn alternative way in which mass nouns may be made count nouns is, instead of the use of a pluralised partitive, to use the noun as a classifier.\n\nFor example, although the words coffee, gold and water are generally considered and most frequently used as mass nouns, they can occur in the following mass-noun uses:\n\nTwo coffee cups\n\nThree gold bars\n\nA single water jug\n\nand so on.\n\nWhen count nouns act as classifiers like this they are, naturally, functioning quasi-adjectivally rather than as nominal items in their own right.\n\nHyponymy\n\nOften, superordinates or hypernyms are mass nouns while the hyponyms which they subsume are count nouns so we get, e.g.:\n\nhousing: house, flat, room, bedsit, mansion, palace, villa etc.\n\nequipment: tool, oil, pipe, saw, screwdriver etc.\n\ngear: rucksack, tent, water carrier, groundsheet etc.\n\nand so on.\n\nAlternative count nouns\n\nIt is often possible in English to select a synonymous count noun in place of a mass noun so we encounter pairs such as:\n\nMass nouns Count nouns advice\n\ncarpeting\n\nchange\n\nfauna\n\nflora\n\nsickness\n\nfoliage\n\nfootwear\n\ngear, equipment\n\nknowledge\n\nlaughter\n\nluggage\n\nmail\n\npasta\n\nsoftware\n\nwildlife suggestion\n\ncarpet\n\ncoin\n\nanimal\n\nplant\n\nillness\n\nleaf\n\nshoe, sandal etc.\n\ntool\n\nbelief\n\nlaugh\n\nsuitcase / case / bag\n\nletter\n\nnoodle\n\napp, program\n\nanimal\n\nChanges over time\n\nLanguage is not static so over time and some nouns have managed to shift from mass to count or vice versa. For example:\n\nwages was once a mass noun but the singular form is now encountered frequently and the noun is treated as a count noun (the King James Bible [circa 1611] has, Romans 6, 23, the wages of sin is death).\n\naccommodation was once a count noun with a plural in common use but now usually occurs as a mass noun. The plural form is also in use in other meanings.\n\nmathematics and physics were both count nouns originally but are now treated as mass nouns and history is now a mass noun when applied to an academic subject but still a count noun when referring to particular types or versions of history as in, e.g.:\n\nOn his bookshelf were four histories of the Crusades.\n\nHere is a list of most of the most common and troublesome mass nouns in English. It's not complete and many, such as wood, kindness, fire, work, weight, damage, travel and so on, can be used with or without different meanings as count nouns.\n\nThis list is available as a PDF document from the link at the end.\n\nadvice\n\nair\n\nanger\n\nart\n\nbread\n\ncash\n\ncheese\n\nchildhood\n\nclothing\n\ncoffee\n\ndamage\n\ndanger\n\neducation\n\nenergy\n\nequipment\n\nfire\n\nfood\n\nfreedom\n\nfriendship fun\n\nfurniture\n\ngold\n\nhair\n\nhappiness\n\nhealth\n\nheat\n\nhelp\n\nhonesty\n\nhousework\n\nhumour\n\nimagination\n\ninformation\n\nintelligence\n\nkindness\n\nknowledge\n\nlabour\n\nlaughter\n\nlove luck\n\nmanagement\n\nmetal\n\nmilk\n\nmoney\n\nmusic\n\nnews\n\npaper\n\npronunciation\n\npunctuation\n\nquality\n\nquantity\n\nrain\n\nrice\n\nrubbish\n\nsafety\n\nsand\n\nshopping\n\nsleep smoke\n\nsnow\n\nsoup\n\nsport\n\nstrength\n\nsugar\n\nsunshine\n\ntea\n\ntime\n\ntraffic\n\ntransportation\n\ntravel\n\nunderstanding\n\nwarmth\n\nwater\n\nweather\n\nweight\n\nwood\n\nwork\n\nA summary of count and mass nouns\n\n-top-\n\nMisleading learners\n\nThe terms countable and uncountable nouns are sometimes used for the categories above. While this may be helpful for some purposes, the terms are misleading.\n\nFor example, money is a mass noun we can count and almost all mass nouns can be made count nouns by the use of a partitive:\n\na slice of cake\n\na bit of cheese\n\na piece of information\n\nthree quarters of the loaf of bread\n\nor measures\n\na pound of sugar\n\na pint of ale, a kilo of oil\n\netc.\n\nAs we shall see below, the determiner and article systems for mass and count nouns are also different so it is a distortion to describe mass nouns as singular.\n\nBy the same token, it is arguably advisable to tell our learners about count and mass uses rather than count and mass nouns because, as we saw above, that's nearer the truth of the matter. We should be careful not to mislead.\n\nMarkedness: size, number and gender markers in nouns\n\nCertain forms of nouns (and other word classes such as adjectives) may be described as marked insofar as they are differentiated from the form which is usual and taken for granted. For example,\n\nkitchen and book are unmarked but kitchenette and booklet are marked for size\n\ntable and mouse are unmarked but tables and mice are marked for number (see below)\n\ngoose and chicken are unmarked but gander, cockerel and hen are marked for gender\n\nIt is unfashionable to use gender markings on many nouns so the use of, e.g., the -ess ending to denote females (manageress, stewardess etc.) and the use of specific nouns for female and male people is deprecated, so we now prefer police officer for policewoman / man etc. Sometimes, however, the gender distinction is unavoidable.\n\nThere are two types:\n\nunmarked forms\n\nIn these nouns, it is not possible by inspecting the morphology to see which sex is meant:\n\nbachelor – spinster (although bachelor girl (rather than *spinster boy) is heard with a preference now for the adjective as in single person / man / woman)\n\nsister – brother\n\nmother – father\n\naunt – uncle\n\nlady – gentleman\n\nqueen – king\n\nwoman – man\n\nnun â monk\n\nmarked forms\n\nIn these words, the marking is made morphologically, usually with the suffix -ess but not invariably, so the sex difference can be seen:\n\nbridegroom – bride (unusual in that the male form is marked)\n\nduke – duchess\n\nemperor – empress\n\ngod – goddess\n\nhero – heroine\n\nhost – hostess\n\nwidower – widow (unusual in that the male form is marked)\n\nA large group of nouns referring to people remains unmarked for gender (and the list grows as words like actress and hostess fall out of favour). There is, for example, no distinction in:\n\nartist, person, chair(man), guest, professor, criminal, speaker, child, vet, consultant, freelancer, doctor, novelist, parent, teacher and many more.\n\nOccasionally, it is necessary to insert a marker for gender if the sense requires a distinction to be made so we get:\n\nmale nurse, man servant, woman friend, girl Friday and so on.\n\nAs people become more sensitive to connotation, these terms, too, are falling out of fashion.\n\nGender marking or its absence is irrational in English (why is there not, e.g., a guestess or a criminaless?) and the suffixes are unproductive so no new forms appear.\n\ndomesticated or 'higher' animals\n\nThere are no political or social pressures acting on nouns for animals (providing they are of the higher sort) so we have, e.g.:\n\nbuck – doe\n\nbull – cow\n\ncock – hen\n\ngander – goose\n\nstallion – mare\n\ntiger – tigress\n\nlion – lioness\n\netc.\n\nnon-domesticated or 'lower' animals\n\nLower animals, i.e., those with which we feel no particular affinity or are not normally domesticated, do not usually take any kind of sex marking although terms such as dog-otter are available for people to whom it might matter.\n\nFor more, see the guides to markedness and to gender, both linked in the list of related guides at the end.\n\n-top-\n\nPlural markers in nouns\n\ncrocuses or croci?\n\nThe regular plural system in English is simple and the requires -s or -es suffixes, depending on how the singular form ends:\n\nIf it ends in -e, add -s but add -es for all other endings.\n\nThere are, however, some exceptions and issues to note:\n\nPhonemic changes, particularly the voicing of the final consonant.\n\n/t/, /p/, /f/, /k/ /Î¸/ endings All other endings cats /kÃ¦ts/\n\ncups /kÊps/\n\nkick /skÉªks/\n\nlaughs /lÉËfs/\n\nmaths /mÃ¦Î¸s/ boys /ËbÉÉªz/\n\ngirls /É¡ÉËlz/\n\nfathers /ËfÉËÃ°.Éz/\n\nhomes /hÉÊmz/\n\ncubs /kÊbz/\n\nand the right-hand list could be greatly extended.\n\nAn exception is the word house (/haÊs/ whose plural is pronounced /ËhaÊz.Éªz/.\n\nThis is a regular system to which there is a guide linked below.\n\nThe pronunciation and spelling of the plural of words ending in f is slightly irregular, so we get:\n\ncalf â calves\n\nelf â elves\n\nhalf â halves\n\nhoof â hooves\n\nleaf â leaves\n\nlife â lives\n\nloaf â loaves scarf â scarves (and derived forms)\n\nself â selves (and derived forms)\n\nsheaf â sheaves\n\nshelf â shelves (and derived forms)\n\nthief â thieves (and derived forms)\n\nwife â wives (and derived forms)\n\nwolf â wolves\n\nand in all these cases the final /f/ is replaced by /vz/\n\netc.\n\nHowever, the plural of roof is seen both as roofs and ?rooves (and differently pronounced). The word wharf also has two acceptable plural forms, wharves and wharfs, as does dwarf. The status of oaf changing to oaves is unclear.\n\nOther nouns ending in /f/ do not alter the morphology so we get, e.g.:\n\ncliff â cliffs\n\nmuff â muffs\n\nproof â proofs\n\ngulf â gulfs\n\nand so on.\n\nOlder English plurals\n\nA small number of nouns have retained older English plural forms involving a change to the vowel (ablaut) or an ending other than a simple -s or -es suffix. They include words like\n\nchild â children\n\ndie â dice\n\nfoot â feet\n\ngoose â geese\n\nlouse â lice\n\nmouse â mice man â men\n\nox â oxen\n\npenny â pence (or pennies)\n\nperson â people\n\ntooth â teeth\n\nwoman â women\n\nwhich simply have to be learned and taught individually. That is, by the way, almost a complete list.\n\nSometimes a phenomenon known as suppletion is at work here: the derivations of the singular and plural nouns are different so the words look unconnected. The word person is derived from Old French but the word people is a later derivation from a different French word.\n\nThis also accounts for the plural of cow being cattle.\n\nZero-marked plurals\n\nSome nouns have no marking in the plural (a Ø plural) but the plural still exists. These often (not always) refer to animals:\n\n(air)craft\n\nbison\n\ndeer\n\nelk\n\nfish\n\ngrouse lobster\n\nmoose\n\nsalmon\n\nsheep\n\nshrimp\n\ntrout\n\nSome of these words do take regular plurals when we are considering small numbers of identifiable entities:\n\nsix fishes\n\ntwo shrimps\n\netc.\n\nbut some resist any kind of plural marking.\n\nNote: These are all count nouns and should not be confused with mass nouns which take no plural. No plural form is not the same thing as a zero plural form.\n\nInvariable unmarked plurals\n\nA few words in English are always plural but take no inflexion to show it. Examples are:\n\ncattle\n\nclergy\n\nfolk\n\ngentry people\n\npolice\n\npoultry\n\nvermin\n\nAgain, these are unmarked plural forms of countable nouns, not mass nouns.\n\nBorrowings\n\nA much larger group of 'irregular' plurals are loan words from Latin, French, Italian and Greek (and a few from Hebrew). In many of these cases, the plural form of the original language is often preferred but there is a clear tendency to Anglicise the forms. These are often described as irregular plurals but they are not. They are simply following the regular plural-forming conventions of the languages from which they have been borrowed.\n\nThe way to bet is to impose the English plural system on imports but that is not always the safest procedure. When both the original language form and the English plural is available, the former is usually preferred in technical and formal writing.\n\nWe get, for example:\n\nFrom Latin:\n\nsingular plural antenna antennae or antennas apex apices or apexes appendix appendices or appendixes aquarium aquariums or aquaria corpus corpora or corpuses criterion criteria (only) curriculum curriculums or curricula focus focuses or foci genius geniuses or genii index indexes or indices matrix matrixes or matrices medium mediums or media nebula nebulas or nebulae radius radiuses or radii terminus terminuses or termini vertebra vertebras or vertebrae symposium symposiums or symposia virus viruses (only)\n\nA few Latin-derived words in English resist Anglicisation including:\n\nbacillus (bacilli), bacterium (bacteria), erratum (errata), genus (genera), larva (larvae), stratum (strata)\n\nTwo oddities are the words agenda and data, both of which are Latin plurals but often treated in English as singular. The singular forms are agendum and datum and rarely heard.\n\nThe word media (singular medium) is also occasionally paired with a singular verb form. (When the singular refers to a kind of spiritualist who claims to make contact with the dead, the regular plural is used.)\n\nFrom Greek:\n\nMany Greek nouns in English retain the Greek plural forms:\n\nsingular plural analysis analyses basis bases crisis crises ellipsis ellipses hypothesis hypotheses parenthesis parentheses schema schemata thesis theses\n\nbut some have been completely Anglicised:\n\nsingular plural automaton automatons (rarely automata) demon demons (never demones)\n\nFrom French:\n\nWhether the words entered English from old Norman French or Modern French matters here. The older words have taken on the English plural forms. However, we have, for example:\n\nsingular plural bureau bureaux plateau plateaux / plateaus tableau tableaux\n\nbecause those words originate in Parisian French and are more recent importations. Words originally Norman French have existed in English for so long that they are not considered loan words and have taken on English rather than the original French morphology.\n\nFrom Italian:\n\nThese are frequently musical terms and both plural forms are generally possible. For example:\n\nsingular plural libretto librettos or libretti soprano sopranos (only) tempo tempos or tempi virtuoso virtuosos or virtuosi\n\nThree oddballs from Italian are Italian plurals treated as singular in English. They are:\n\ngraffiti (singular graffito)\n\npaparazzi (singular paparazzo)\n\nspaghetti (singular spaghetto)\n\nAlmost all Italian loan words in English take their plural with a single -s ending rather than the usual -es endings.\n\nFrom Hebrew:\n\nThere are three but the third retains its Hebrew plural: cherub (cherubs or cherubim), seraph (seraphs or seraphim) and kibbutz (only (?) kibbutzim). When cherub is used to refer to an attractive child, the plural is Anglicised to cherubs.\n\nFrom other languages:\n\nEnglish has borrowed freely from other languages but in almost all cases, the words have been Anglicised to conform with the English plural system although the original language has a different way of marking plurality. For example:\n\nbananas [probably from Wolof, a West African language, via Portuguese or Spanish]\n\nblitzes and kindergartens [from German]\n\nboomerangs [from an extinct language of New South Wales]\n\nbungalows [from Gujarati]\n\nchimpanzees [from a Bantu language of Angola]\n\nchocolates [from Nahuatl (Aztecan)]\n\nkangaroos [from Guugu Yimidhirr]\n\nmoccasins and tomahawks [from Powhatan]\n\nrobots [from Czech]\n\nverandas [from Hindi]\n\netc.\n\nAgain, this list could be very greatly extended but this is not that kind of site.\n\nPlural nouns\n\nOne class of nouns appears only in the plural.\n\nPairs:\n\nSome tools and items of clothing appear in the plural because the partitive phrase a pair of is frequently omitted in English:\n\nscissors, pliers, tongs, shears, secateurs, spectacles etc.\n\nshorts, trousers, tights, flannels etc.\n\nWhen these appear as classifiers or in compound nouns, they often revert to the singular so we get, e.g.:\n\na scissor case\n\ntrouser pocket\n\nspectacle case\n\netc.\n\nPluralia tantum\n\nare nouns which only appear in the plural or are used in the plural with a particular sense. There are plenty of these and when they occur in your teaching, you need to point out their special use. Some examples will suffice (a '-' in the second column means that there is no obvious singular-noun equivalent):\n\nplural singular difference or meaning * alms - charity money amends - recompense annals - records arrears - money owed attentions attention unwelcome courtship vs. taking notice auspices - control or oversight brains brain intelligence vs. thinking organ cahoots - conspiracy clothes cloth attire vs. piece of material confines - boundaries of an area contents - amount held customs custom checking of luggage vs. usual practice * eaves - underside of roof projection fireworks firework display vs. individual device funds fund money vs. a collection of money glasses glass spectacles vs. transparent container greens - green vegetables guts gut courage vs. digestive organ heads head side of a coin vs. part of the body leftovers - remaining items loggerheads - arguing looks look appearance vs. the act of looking means - resources or implements minutes minute record of proceedings vs. time period pains pain efforts vs. unpleasant feeling remains - left overs * riches - wealth scissors - cutting instrument shenanigans - secret / dishonest activity smithereens - tiny pieces spectacles spectacle eyeglasses vs. attractive event surroundings - environment thanks - gratitude tidings - news tropics tropic warm areas of the world vs. line of latitude trousers - leg clothing wits wit intelligence vs. amusing person In the second sense, where there is one, many of the words can be plural, too.\n\n*The words alms, eaves and riches were all originally singular but have been pluralised grammatically in Modern English because of their -s ending.\n\nAgain, this list can be extended but this is not that kind of site.\n\n-top-\n\nDeterminers\n\nWhen you are teaching in this area, you need to be alert to the ways in which we use determiners and especially articles. Here's a guide.\n\nNoun category Determiners Articles Verbal concord Pronoun concord Examples Singular count nouns one, each, every, any, this, that Zero article is not (usually) possible: a/an or the must be used if no other determiner is present. singular verb form he, she, it but they is often used for nouns not marked for sex each one has\n\nany person who sees\n\nthe woman is smiling at you Plural count nouns\n\n(and pluralia tantum) many, some, several, these, those, a couple of Zero article is possible.\n\na/an is not possible.\n\nthe is possible. plural verb form they many pencils were useless\n\ntigers are dangerous\n\nthe beers are in the fridge\n\nthose clothes are dirty Mass nouns much, little, less, more, this, that Zero article is possible.\n\na/an is not possible.\n\nthe is possible. singular verb form it take less sugar\n\nthat material is beautiful\n\nthe racket was deafening Collective nouns As for count nouns (singular or plural) As for count nouns (singular or plural) * plural or singular verb forms in British English\n\nsingular verb form in US English it or they depending on notion four teams competed\n\nmy team are winning\n\nhis team is losing Proper nouns No determiners are used except when distinguishing (e.g., this Mr Smith, that River Stour) the may occasionally be used in the rare plurals (e.g., dinner with The Windsors). It is also used for plural countries, countries pre-modified with an adjective phrase and mountain ranges. plural for mountain ranges,\n\nsingular for countries (The Netherlands, The United States etc.) but plural for island countries and areas he, she, they for people\n\nit (erstwhile she) for countries\n\nthey for mountain ranges and islands unless they form a single nation\n\nThe Soviet Union was huge\n\nThis is my friend, John\n\nThe Maldives are / is beautiful\n\nThe Channel Islands are interesting\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany is represented\n\nI hiked in the Alps\n\nFor more, go to the guide to determiners or the guide to the article system, both linked in the list at the end.\n\n* Regarding the use of verbal concord with collective nouns, a major and widely respected British newspaper, The Times, sets it style guide to the effect that it:\n\n... use[s] the singular verb with corporate bodies (the company, the government, the council etc.). But we prefer the plural use for couple, family, music groups, and bands, the public and sports teams. Thus, France (the country) is a top place for holidays but France (the rugby team) are the Six Nations champions.\n\nThe Times, 26th March 2022\n\n-top-\n\nIdiomatic uses\n\non foot\n\nWhile there are certainly some irregularities and idiomatic uses of nouns with their articles and determiners much can be explained more usefully and rationally as count nouns being used as mass nouns. The easy fall-back position taken in too many grammars written for learners and some coursebooks is that these uses are 'exceptions' which must be learned individually. They are not.\n\nWhat they actually are is count nouns being conceptualised for the nature of the underlying meaning rather than their number and used, therefore, in the same way as mass nouns. We may have two feet and two hands but we come to work on foot and make things by hand. Other examples include:\n\nInstitutions:\n\ngo to / be:\n\nin: bed / church / university / school / hospital / court / prison / business etc.\n\nat: work\n\nTransport:\n\ntravel / arrive / come by:\n\nbus / plane / car / air / bicycle / sea / ship etc.\n\nTimes:\n\nhappen:\n\nby: day / night\n\nat: dawn / sunset / dusk / twilight / Christmas / Easter\n\nin: summer / autumn / winter / spring\n\nPrepositional phrases:\n\nhappen / be:\n\nat: risk\n\nby: arrangement / accident / chance / contrast / mistake\n\nin: addition / advance / case / effect / fact / favour / opposition\n\non: account / call / demand / oath\n\nBinomial idioms:\n\nday to day, door to door, heart to heart, face to face, shoulder to shoulder, arm in arm, hand in glove, hand in hand, head over heels, man and boy\n\netc.\n\nVerb + noun collocations:\n\nlose heart, make conversation, take part, pay attention, give way, talk shop, spend time, save trouble, take offence, take root, take place, catch fire, do wrong\n\netc.\n\nAll of these are simply unmarked uses of count nouns used in idiomatic expressions rather than exceptions to be learned individually.\n\nSee the guide to the article system for more in this area.\n\n-top-\n\nRelated guides the word-class map for links to guides to the other major word classes nouns: essentials for a simpler guide which includes some of the above (with small extensions especially in proper nouns and the use of articles) shell nouns for a more detailed look at these functions of certain nouns the article system for the in-service guide to the way and ways to select the right article for a noun determiners for an expansion of the table above regarding these modifiers classifiers, partitives and group nouns for the ways English makes mass nouns countable and much else pronouncing noun and verb inflexions which includes plurals of nouns mass nouns for a PDF list of common mass nouns (as above) concord for more about verb forms with nouns in English catenative verbs for more on the distinction between participles, gerunds and verbal nouns (un)countability for more on mass and count concepts in English in the initial plus section (so simpler and shorter) compounding for the guide to all areas of compounding, including noun + noun compounds idiomaticity for more on items such as binomials types of modality for a guide explaining the types of modality mentioned in the part about shell nouns above markedness for more on how marking is achieved in English (and not just for nouns) gender for the guide to gender marking in English and other languages and to efforts to remove it modification to see how noun phrases are constructed and get some ideas about how to teach them adjectives for some more on markedness and how nouns are modified subject and object the essential (i.e., simple) guide to see how nouns and verbs work together to make meanings"
