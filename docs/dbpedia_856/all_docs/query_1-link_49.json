        "text": "Alder Hey was originally created as a workhouse, providing care for the sick. By July 1914, a portion of the institution was allotted for the accommodation of sick children after concerns were raised over a serious epidemic of eye disease in young children.\n\nHere is a brief timeline of the history of Alder Hey.\n\n1910\n\nThe Board of Poor Law Guardians purchase Alder Hey, a mansion set on 25 acres of land in West Derby, Liverpool with the intention of building a new workhouse for the city’s poor. The plans include an area dedicated to caring for the paupers’ sick children.\n\n1914\n\nA new modern hospital was erected and opened its doors in October 1914. 350 children took occupancy of twelve wards, admitted from the workhouse, home or transferred from Walton Hospital.\n\nThe doors of Alder Hey were opened after the outbreak of the First World War so the building can also serve as a military hospital known as ‘Camp Hospital 40’. But the wards designed for caring for children retain their purpose. An American military camp is also established on the grounds.\n\n1918\n\nAfter World War I, the building is firmly established as a children’s hospital – Alder Hey Children’s Hospital.\n\n1924\n\nAlder Hey grew and in October 1924, a decade after opening, the nurses’ home was expanded so there were more staff to look after Liverpool’s sick children.\n\n1939\n\nDuring World War II, Alder Hey was used to care for Allied and German soldiers (guarded by US police). With accommodation at a maximum, ten extra brick huts were built at the far end of the hospital to house the military. Any soldiers well enough would help carry children to shelters during air raids.\n\n1944\n\nPenicillin was tested on a child for the first time at Alder Hey, saving a child from pneumonia.\n\n1948\n\nThe NHS was established on 5th July 1948.\n\n1953\n\nAlder Hey established the world’s first neonatal surgical intensive care unit in 1953. This unit has saved thousands of lives. During the 1950s cardiac surgery was pioneered at Alder Hey.\n\n1964\n\nAlder Hey celebrates its jubilee year with a celebration at Liverpool Cathedral.\n\n1982\n\nThree-time Grand National winner Red Rum visits Alder Hey in April of this year.\n\n1990\n\nPrincess Diana surprises children on a visit to Alder Hey on 11th September 1990.\n\n1993\n\nRonald McDonald House opens next to the hospital to provide a home away from home for the families of sick children being treated at Alder Hey.\n\n2005\n\nOur famous Tin Man was donated to Alder Hey by ducting company Senior Hargreaves. The Tin Man has become a comforting and popular attraction for many children, young people and families.\n\n2008\n\nAlder Hey becomes an NHS Foundation Trust.\n\n2012\n\nAlder Hey Children’s Charity was launched in 2012 as an independent charity, replacing the previous fundraising function for Alder Hey, the Imagine Appeal which had raised funds for the hospital for many years.\n\nCatherine, Princess of Wales (then the Duchess of Cambridge), visits the Alder Hey on 14th February 2012.\n\n2013\n\nConstruction starts on a brand-new hospital on the grounds of Springfield Park.\n\n2014\n\nAlder Hey is 100 years old and is given Freedom of the City of Liverpool in recognition of its treatment and care of children and young people for over a century. During a special celebration at the Town Hall, the City of Liverpool acknowledged Alder Hey’s contribution to making a huge difference in the lives of people in Liverpool and beyond.\n\n2015\n\nOn 14th May 2015, King Charles III (then Prince Charles), visits Alder Hey to see the construction of the new hospital.\n\nOn 1st October 2015Alder Hey unveiled their state-of-the-art new hospital – Alder Hey in the Park – to the world. The new hospital has 270 beds, including 48 critical care beds for ICU, HDU and Burns patients. There are six standard wards with 32 beds. Each ward has two four-bed bays and 24 single rooms with ensuite bathrooms. The majority of bedrooms have park views and patients have easy access to play areas on and outside their ward. There are also 16 operating theatres, four for day-case surgery and twelve inpatient theatres.\n\n2016\n\nIn March 2016, Alder Hey opened the Institute in the Park, also known as the Speakman Building – a dedicated research, innovation and education centre located next door to the hospital.\n\nAlder Hey’s new hospital was officially opened on 22nd June 2016 by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip.\n\n2020\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Alder Hey treated many adult patients to help colleagues throughout the NHS.\n\n2021\n\nIn September 2021, Alder Hey opened the Alder Centre, the UK’s only dedicated bereavement centre for child loss.\n\n2022\n\nIn October 2022, Alder Hey opened our new Catkin Centre, which is home to several outpatient clinics.\n\n2023\n\nIn April 2023, Alder Hey delivered its first gene therapy treatment as part of a Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy research study.\n\nIn May 2023, Alder Hey opened Sunflower House, our tier 4 mental health inpatient unit, replacing the Dewi Jones Unit in Waterloo. This is the latest development in Alder Hey’s evolving healthcare campus.\n\n2024\n\nIn January 2024, Alder Hey performed Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) using a new advanced device to help treat dystonia. This was the first time in the world this new technology had been used on a child."
