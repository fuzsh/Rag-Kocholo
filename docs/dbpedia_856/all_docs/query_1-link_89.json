        "text": "When are DBS Checks for children’s hospitals required?\n\nConsidering the age and the likelihood of frequent contact with the patients in a children’s hospital, DBS Checks are an important part of safeguarding protocol.\n\nHowever, in hospitals there can be a large number of different staff and roles. Which role requires which level of DBS Check? Do all of them require one?\n\nOur guide can cut through any confusion and help sort out who’s eligible for a DBS Check and what level check they might need.\n\nHow do you qualify for a DBS Check in a children’s hospital?\n\nIf an applicant is working in a children’s hospital, they may be able to obtain a higher level of check than if they were working in a general hospital due to the likelihood of them engaging in regulated activity with children.\n\nThe hospital must be a registered children’s hospital, such as Great Ormond Street or Alder Hey, in order to be eligible for a check.\n\nWhat roles qualify for a DBS Check in a children’s hospital?\n\nAnyone working in a regulated activity with the children (such as Doctors or Nurses) can obtain an enhanced DBS check with a check against the children’s barred list.\n\nProviding professional healthcare is always classed as regulated activity, regardless of how often it happens and whether the person is supervised or not.\n\nIf someone is working with patients without supervision by a healthcare professional, for example:\n\nReception staff\n\nCaterers\n\nCleaners\n\nVolunteers\n\nAny job that has access to patients on the wards\n\nThen this employee can obtain an enhanced DBS check without a check against the children’s barred list.\n\nIf the applicant is working in a children’s hospital in Wales – such as The Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospital for Wales – the applicant can have an enhanced DBS check with the children’s barred list.\n\nThis must be done frequently if the role involves working three or more times a month with children.\n\nIf an employee does not have access to the patient wards as part of their profession, then they would not be eligible for a DBS Check – for example, if you were working in a hospital gift shop or a catering assistant in the hospital restaurant.\n\nThis is because any interaction they might have with patients would be considered incidental, like any visitors to the hospital.\n\nDBS Checks for children’s hospitals: A summary\n\nSo, who requires a DBS Check in a children’s hospital?\n\nIt all depends on the likelihood of an employee engaging in regulated activity with children, as well as the contact that they have with them. If there’s no likelihood of regulated activity, then an employee is not eligible for a check.\n\nIf you’re still unsure whether your role would require a DBS Check then you can check your position against the NHS’s DBS eligibility tool."
