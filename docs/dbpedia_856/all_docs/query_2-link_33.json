The less anxious our visiting families, the more time staff have to carry out other duties.\n\nHappier children attending operating theatres will spend less time in the anaesthetic room and will then wake up relaxed in recovery.\n\nRead for Good has a significant impact throughout the hospital and throughout a patient’s journey from admission to discharge.”"
