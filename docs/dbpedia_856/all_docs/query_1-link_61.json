        "text": "Comparing COVID-19 Vaccine Schedule Combinations in Adolescents\n\nThis site/cohort is not currently recruiting - to participate in the new Cohort B for this study, click here\n\nThe Public Health Wales site is recruiting participants from the Cardiff area :\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccine Study in children\n\nWhat is the purpose of this study?\n\nThe purpose of this study is to find out how well young people (aged 12-16 years) respond to two doses of COVID-19 vaccine. It will compare immune responses to two different vaccines and two different doses of the Pfizer Vaccine.\n\nCondition Studied\n\nCOVID-19\n\nDuration of participation\n\nUp to 9 months\n\nNumber of visits\n\n5 or 6\n\nAm I eligible to participate?\n\nPlease note that we are not currently enrolling new participants into the study. It is possible that the study will start to enrol new participants in January 2022. If you think you might want to take part, you can register your interest at one of the study sites.\n\nParticipants aged 16 can give their own consent to participate in this study. Participants aged less than 16 will need consent from your parent or guardian.\n\nTo be eligible, participants must live near one of the centres running the study:\n\nOxford\n\nSt George’s University Hospital, London\n\nSouthampton\n\nBristol\n\nCardiff\n\nNottingham\n\nLeeds\n\nSheffield\n\nManchester\n\nCambridge\n\nLiverpool\n\nNewcastle\n\nParticipants should:\n\nBe aged between 12 years and 16 years (up until 17th birthday)\n\nHave no significant medical history\n\nBe willing to have their medical history discussed with their GP\n\nWhat happens in the study?\n\nThe study aims to recruit up to 270 participants. All receive a first standard dose of Pfizer vaccine, given either by the study team or in the community. Around eight weeks later they are given a second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. In the earlier part of the study, this was determined at random to be one of the following:\n\nFull standard dose Pfizer vaccine\n\nA third of a standard dose Pfizer vaccine\n\nFull dose Novavax vaccine\n\nFrom 29th November 2021, the second dose of COV-19 vaccine will be determined at random to be one of the following:\n\nFull standard dose Pfizer vaccine\n\nA third of a standard dose Pfizer vaccine\n\nParticipants will not know which of these they have received until 4 weeks after the second vaccination.\n\nThe Pfizer vaccine is licensed for emergency use. Novavax is only licensed for use in clinical studies.\n\nParticipants will have a blood test at each of the six visits, to measure immunity to COVID-19. Anaesthetic cream can be provided to minimise discomfort from the blood tests.\n\nVisits will take place at Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospital for Wales, Heath Park, Cardiff.\n\nSome participants will also have samples of nasal fluid and saliva taken. This is voluntary and will only occur at some sites.\n\nIs there any reimbursement for the study?\n\nYes. We are able to reimburse at a rate of £10 for each study visit. This may be paid in vouchers. Reimbursement may not be made at every visit (for example, a £20 voucher may be given at every other visit).\n\nWhat are the advantages of taking part?\n\nParticipants will receive two doses of COVID-19 vaccine. The results from this study will help to increase knowledge about how best to vaccinate young people.\n\nWhat are the disadvantages of taking part?\n\nNo-one likes blood tests or injections, but we will do our best to ensure they are not too unpleasant.\n\nVaccines, like all medicines, can have side effects. These are usually minor (such as a sore arm) and usually last only a few days. More serious side effects are rare, and we will discuss these with you in more detail if you might wish to participate.\n\nWhat will happen if I change my mind about taking part?\n\nParticipation is voluntary and you are free to change your mind and withdraw at any time. You do not need to provide a reason. This would not affect your subsequent medical care in any way.\n\nWho is funding this study?\n\nThis study is funded by the UK Vaccine Task Force and the National Institute of Health Research\n\nWhat do I do if I want to take part?\n\nPlease complete the screening form below\n\nWho can I contact if I have questions?\n\nE-mail us at : comcov3.hcrw@wales.nhs.uk\n\nParticipant Information Sheets & Screening Forms\n\nChild aged 12-15 : Participant Information Sheet (PDF)\n\nChild aged 16 : Participant Information Sheet (PDF)\n\nParent / Guardian : Participant Information Sheet (PDF)\n\nThis site is not currently recruiting\n\nChild aged 12-15 : Parent / Guardian Complete the Screening Form"
