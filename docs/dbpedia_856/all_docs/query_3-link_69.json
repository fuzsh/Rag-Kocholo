        "text": "Panlingua, by Chaumont Devin, May 7, 1998.\n\nChapter 2, The Foundations of Knowledge.\n\nKnowledge can be represented in Panlingua, as we have seen. In the last chapter we had a detailed look at how \"A lion killed this zebra\" could be stored. And we know that Panlingua structures are built from various kinds of synlinks and lexlinks. And as we shall see later, there is no thought that cannot be represented in Panlingua.\n\nBut is Panlingua all there is? Is there any other way in which knowledge can be stored in the thre-dimensional model we have designed? The answer is \"yes.\" Knowledge can also be stored in semlinks, which we have not implemented thus far. Semlinks link semnods to each other, and lie completely within the semantic plane.\n\nAnother name for the collection of all semlinks and semnods is \"the ontology.\" The word, \"ontology,\" comes from the Greek words, \"ontos\" and \"logos,\" and means roughly, \"the study of what IS,\" or \"words about what IS.\" As it turns out this is a very good name, because the major link types of the ontology (semlink types) correspond closely to English auxiliary verbs (recall that the main such verb is \"to be,\" which in Greek is \"ontos\").\n\nNow imagine with me that an African woman has walked down to the stream at the edge of the village with her child. The child sees a crab scurry away and hide among the rocks. \"What's that?\" she asks her mother, pointing.\n\n\"A crab,\" her mother responds.\n\n\"What is a crab,\" her daughter persists.\n\n\"A kind of animal.\"\n\n\"Do crabs bite?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Do they hurt?\"\n\n\"A little bit.\"\n\n\"Can we eat them?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nEtc.\n\nWhat is happening here is the fundamental learning of fundamental knowledge by a child. Almost all of this information can be stored in an ontology, where it is evidently more permanent and can be accessed more rapidly than if it were stored as Panlingua.\n\nI have created a computer program that serves as a lexicon and ontology. Using such a program one might enter the following:\n\ncrab sng\n\ncrabs plr * (asterisk means \"of same\")\n\ncrab isa animal\n\ncrab can bite\n\ncrab can not injure crabs are edible etc.\n\nIn this mechanized example the word in the middle is a mnemonic. In my program it is always three letters chosen to help humans remember. When refering to the ontology such link types are also sometimes called operators, and the two words they link are sometimes called operands.\n\nWhenever such ontological entries are made, either (1) A word is defined and assigned a semnod, as in:\n\ncrab sng\n\nor else (2) a semlink is forged between two previously-established semnods, as in:\n\ncrabs can bite\n\nThe properties of such ontologies have only begun to be explored, but have already proven to be quite amazing. One of the greatest strengths of ontological structures is their ability to \"grasp\" the ramifications of new information. For example, suppose an ontology is up and running, and the following entry is made:\n\nCharley is a man\n\nThen the following interactions should immediately be possible:\n\nCan Charley talk Yes\n\ncan Charley menstruate No\n\ncan Charley give_birth No\n\nhas Charley testicles YES\n\nhas Charley vagina No\n\nEtc.\n\nThis power to subsume and know many things about new items without ever being told enables massive amounts of information to be stored using minimal computational resources. In fact an ontology can ideally return relational information on all semlink types for n(n-1) word pairs, where n is the number of words in the lexicon. Thus for only 10,000 words and 10 semlink types, an ontoloty can return information about 99,990,000 * 10 = 999,900,000 combinations. The ontology is thus by far the most powerful knowledge storage medium ever known to man.\n\nBut ontological knowledge, although very fast and very massive, is limited strictly to knowledge about binary relations. Thus it is possible for an ontology to know that \"Roses are red,\" but it is not possible for an ontology to know that \"John can dance the jitterbug.\" In the ontology knowledge is organized into a sort of rough-and-ready instant reflection of the real world, but an ontology cannot be used to store specific knowledge about people, places, and events.\n\nSo ontological knowledge might be viewed as the foundation of all knowledge, because it exists within the linguistic planes but at a sublinguistic level. In other words, Panlingua is a language--indeed, the mother of all languages, but ontological information is not.\n\nDo animals possess ontologies? Almost certainly. In fact it may be that ALL animals possess minimal ontologies of some sort or another. Otherwise how could animals know that:\n\nitem_a is edible\n\nitem_b is not edible\n\nitem_c is edible\n\netc.\n\nAnd many animals can probably construct and manipulate Panlingua structures as well. As a matter of fact it has been shown that predatory insects such as spiders can carefully plan and execute their attacks. It may be that they employ something other than Panlingua, but this would not seem likely for reasons we shall later explore.\n\nBut it is important to notice that not all ontological operators (semlinks) are created equal. Certain semlink types are of crucial importance, and must be present in nearly all ontologies. The first of these is probably the hypernym link (something is a kind of something). The second is probably the holonym link (something is a part of something). Then antonym, synonym, and others. And some semlinks must be handled in special ways. For example, X is a hypernym of A if A is a B and B is a C and ... is an X. And A is a holonym of B if A has a B, A is something that has a B, or A has something that is a B.\n\nAmong other indispensable things, the hypernym link enables a great deal to be said about many words using only a relatively few entries. The holonym link also enables many questions to be answered using minimal data.\n\nTo understand how ontologies can return such powerful results, let us examine briefly how they work. Suppose we have the entries:\n\nman isa human\n\nhuman isa ape\n\nape isa simian\n\nsimian isa primate\n\nprimate isa mammal\n\nmammal isa vertebrate\n\nvertebrate isa animal\n\nanimal isa organism\n\norganism isa material_object\n\nmaterial_object isa material_thing\n\nmaterial_thing isa thing\n\nman isa male_mammal\n\nmale_mammal has testicle\n\nwoman isa human\n\nwoman isa female_mammal\n\nfemale_mammal can give_birth\n\nanimal can eat\n\nCharley isa man\n\nSuch an ontology would \"know\" that Charley can eat because:\n\nCharley isa human\n\nhuman isa ape\n\nape isa simian\n\nsimian isa primate\n\nprimate isa mammal\n\nmammal isa vertebrate\n\nvertebrate isa animal\n\nanimal can eat\n\nAnd it would know that Charley can't give birth because there is nothing above Charley in the hypernym hierarchy that can give birth. But it would know that Charley has testicle because:\n\nCharley isa man\n\nman isa male_mammal\n\nmale_mammal has testicle\n\n>From these examples it can be seen thatif A is a hypernym of B, and A can do something, then B can do that same thing also unless specifically stated otherwise. And if A is a hypernym of B, and an A has something, then a B has that something also. But if A is a holonym of B, and B is a holonym of C, then an A has a C and a B has a C. Etc.\n\nThe hypernymy hierarchy serves mainly to scramble up and down within an ontology looking for other relations. A is a hypernym of B if B is a kind of an A, and B is a hyponym of A if b is a kind of an A.\n\nFor holonymy and meronymy, on the other hand, A is a holonym of B if an A has a B, and A is a meronym of B if a B has an A. Thus \"brake\" is a meronym of \"automobile,\" and \"automobile\" is a holonym of \"brake\" (cars have brakes).\n\nSo a hypernym is the opposite of a hyponym, and a holonym is the opposite of a meronym.\n\nAn important use of the holonym/meronym relation is to discover the topic of discourse for a segment of text. Thus for a sentence like:\n\nHe adjusted the brakes and set the timing.\n\na check of the ontology might reveal the following semlinks:\n\na brake is part of a wheel\n\na wheel is part of a conveyance\n\ntiming is part of an engine\n\nan engine is part of an automobile\n\nan automobile is a conveyance\n\nThus from the ontology we might find that automobiles have both brakes and timing, and surmise correctly that the topic of discourse of this sentence is an automobile.\n\nBesides its role as a repository of world knowledge, the ontology plays a crucial role in parsing without which certain kinds of disambiguation would be virtually impossible. As an example, take the word, \"had,\" in \"Martha had a baby in the hospital.\" Does this mean that Martha possessed or that martha gave birth? Well, if the ontology \"knows\" that Martha is a woman, and if in the general Panlingua reference there exists an entry like, \"Women give birth in hospitals,\" then by traversing the general reference using the ontology the system should be able to figure out that \"Martha had a baby in the hospital\" probably means that Martha gave birth.\n\nThe ontology also plays an important role in search-match operations in which identical words are not used. For example, if a Panlingua reference says that \"Automobiles travel on roads,\" and it is searched to learn whether a chevrolet can travel on Highway 99, such a search should return \"Yes\" because the ontology says that a Chevrolet is a kind of automobile and Highway 99 is a particular road, etc.\n\nOntologies tend to differ from person to person, and multiple ontologies may exist for certain people. To illustrate what I mean, I was once fascinated by a Philippino woman who lived in California. She is surely one of the most brilliant people I have ever known. But I observed three basic personalities in her. She was a smart Philippino with a perfect command of Tagalog, and when she spoke Tagalog, her whole being went into Philippino gear, and she became a talkative Philippino lady. But in English she had two personalities. One was the very shrewd, very professional businesswoman, and another was plain Miss Everyday American. If I had to guess, I would quickly say that she must have had a separate ontology for each of these three modes. As another example, suppose that one man is a criminal. He believes that stealing is good because it brings him satisfaction. The semnod linked to \"steal\" in his ontology is linked by hypernymy to \"good thing.\" There is another man who is honest, and believes that stealing is a crime. In his ontology, the semnod that links to \"steal\" is linked by hypernymy to the semnod linked to \"bad thing.\" The two ontologies are not the same primarily because their link patterns differ.\n\nOntologies also differ from language to language. For example, in some Southeast Asian languages, green things and blue things employ the same semnod. Thus for a native speaker of such a language learning English,he/she may be crossing the street when the light is \"blue\" for many years.\n\nBut once reliable ontologies have been built for two languages, bridging relations can be forged between the semnods of the two ontologies for use in machine translation.\n\nLastly ontologies can be made to self economize by the following rules:\n\nIf A has a C and B has a C and a B is a kind of an A, then break the \"B has a C\" link.\n\nIf an A has a C and an A has a B and a B has a C, then break the \"A has a C\" link.\n\nEtc.\n\nSo to summarize, ontologies contain massive amounts of the most basic kinds of knowledge, and it is a pretty sure bet that no human language would be possible without them. However ontologies tend to differ from culture to culture and from individual to individual."
