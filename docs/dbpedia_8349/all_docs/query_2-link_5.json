        "text": "5 things semester 1 at Delhi University taught me. 1. The semester just flies by, so spend time with the people you meet, ✨ you’ll learn more that way, DU is DIVERSE TO THE T, and that makes you greatly exposed to local culture at a national scale. 2. The red bricks 🧱 of a university built more than 100 years ago have stored knowledge, listen 👂, absorb it. 3. Professors are more fascinating than your school teachers but nope, never going to be as caring, concerned or interested as your school teachers 🧑🏫 😭💕 4. It is NOT important to be a part of societies, it is NOT THE ONLY way to learn about work culture, more often than not, they are toxic, so surely try out, but seek your own way, to be or not to be, pressure mat Lena 🧚🏻 5. University is the best place for Testing out your little ideas 💡 be it related to work, studies, extra curriculars or relationships. DO IT ✨💌 #linkedingrowth #linkedinforcreators #CUET #delhiuniversity #DUtoday #linkedincommunity #linkedincreator #storytelling #contentcreation #ramjas #girlseducation #education\n\nAnd just like that, a journey spanning over half a decade was brought to its conclusion! This past Saturday, I received my official doctorate degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi and I’m trying to settle in with the “alumni” tag since. I have so much to write/speak about this journey, all these emotions welling up inside of me, so many memorable instances; that one post will never be able to cut it. Instead, I wanted to mention something from the graduation ceremony that resonated with me deeply and will stay with me for the rest of my life. So the chief guest for this year’s Graduation ceremony at IITD was Dr. (Prof.) Gagandeep Kang and in her address to the students one of the things she said was, “You owe this education to the people of this country”. Which is true, literally, as IITs receive huge subsidies and other benefits from the GoI. But that is not all. Remember everyone’s favourite line from Spiderman? With great power, comes greater responsibility. Well, we may not be spidermen/women but we sure as hell have a supercool institution behind us which nurtured us and allowed us to grow, and we do have a responsibility towards our people, our society to pay it back. We were urged to be thoughtful, relentless, and accommodating changemakers. I don’t know how much change I will be able to bring about but I’m going to continuously strive for it. ps: This was also the first time my PhD advisor, Prof. Ravikrishnan Elangovan met with my parents and it’s kind of unsettling to watch the only three people in your life whom you are not used to receiving compliments from, actually shower you with praises!😄 #iitdelhi #iitd #convocation #graduation #phd #lifeofphd #phdcareer #education #change #growth #india #indianeducation\n\nBeing yourself or adapting? A big conflict arises when we find ourselves in situations where we might have to choose- Should i stay firm to my principles? or should I change according to the demands of time? This is a tree that I saw in front of Ramjas, and what particularly attracted me was the fact that instead of cutting the tree down, the renovation project built the campus around the tree. Impressive, isnt it? Faced with challenges, much like this tree,if we stay stubborn to our roots, refusing to give in to the newer, developmental measures, we can find ourselves isoloted, and in a danger of being cut down. But at the same time, should we give up what makes us “us”?. No. The answer lies in flexibility and adaptability. This tree may have lost a few branches, but it still stands tall, having molded the wall around itself. What we need to focus on is, there are pressures in life that may force us to change our ways, or to bow down to the environment. At this time, we cannot afford to be stubborn. Maintaining our integrity, we must stay strong, and while reforming ourselves, we must seize the opportunity and make the moment ours. Who knew that a stroll around campus would ignite such insights that would compel me to face this question- to be or not to be? #du #campusmusings #fyp #linkedinengagement #delhiuniversity #change #adapt #ramjas #college #collegelife #kirorimalcollege #insights\n\nStep into a realm where learning transcends traditional boundaries!

Mahagauri Mata (8th form of Maa Durga), a form of the divine, embodies qualities that resonate with the pursuit of knowledge and personal growth. 🌺 𝗣𝘂𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗼𝗳 𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲: Just as Mahagauri's white attire symbolizes purity, let's seek authentic and ethical learning in our academic journey. 🌺 𝗜𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗿 𝗣𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗙𝗼𝗰𝘂𝘀: In the chaos of exams and assignments, remember to maintain inner peace and focus for effective learning. 🌺 𝗚𝘂𝗶𝗱𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗕𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀: Seek the guidance and blessings of mentors, teachers, and parents on your path to success. 🌺 𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗴𝘁𝗵 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: Embrace the strength and patience symbolized by Mahagauri's bull, as they are essential in overcoming academic challenges. 🌺 𝗖𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴: Like Mahagauri's purifying nature, learn to cleanse your mind and grow from your mistakes, transforming challenges into opportunities. 🌺 𝗣𝗼𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗔𝘁𝘁𝗶𝘁𝘂𝗱𝗲: Approach exams and challenges with the fear-dispelling attitude of Mahagauri, and watch your confidence soar. 🌺 𝗕𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗟𝗶𝗳𝗲𝘀𝘁𝘆𝗹𝗲: Remember to balance your academic pursuits with personal well-being for a harmonious student life. As we embrace these qualities, we can navigate our student journey with a sense of purity, peace, and strength. Let's strive to be Mahagauri in our pursuit of knowledge.

A Meagre 2% Get In. 2 lakh+ students appear for CAT every year. A Meagre 4% Get In. There is this QUESTION surrounding these institutions 🤔 – What Happens Inside? – Is The Pressure Too Much To Handle? – Do Students Only Study? – Is It Worth It? Nishant Shekhar's \"The Game Of Power And Passion\" addresses these questions for you. It is not your regular fun college book. It talks about the struggles and the thrills associated with the IIT life. It talks about politics and passion for a group and an institution. Most importantly, What I Love About It Is . . . It touches upon how learning outside of academics can shape one's personality and character for life. - What if a close friend has to repeat a year of school? How might this affect your life and relationship? - You're campaigning for a favorite candidate in a student election, but they don't get elected. How would you handle this disappointment? The book is like a modern Mahabharat - full of drama and surprises with a cast of characters, each playing their own role. Every incident connects to future events, like dominos falling. PS- If you want to learn about life, and also enjoy a fun humorous read, go for this one! PSS- Super late, But HAPPY DIWALI my LinkedIn Fam 🪔💫 PSSS- Thats my old man, He's Cool and yes we were twinning 😂 #collegelife #lifelessons #linkedinforcreators #MarketingStrategy"
