        "text": "A Daughter of Rajasthan\n\nBorn to Vishnu and Saroj Sarswat, Pooja’s upbringing was steeped in the rich traditions of Rajasthan. From the colorful festivals to the melodious folk music, Pooja embraced every aspect of her culture with pride and reverence. Her parents’ unwavering support and guidance instilled in her a deep sense of gratitude and a commitment to make them proud in all her endeavors.\n\nThe Rise of a Content Creator\n\nPooja’s foray into the world of content creation began long before the advent of TikTok. With a passion for storytelling and a penchant for humor, she found her voice through short videos that resonated with audiences across platforms. However, just as her star was beginning to rise on TikTok, the platform faced a ban in India—an unexpected setback that left Pooja at a crossroads."
