He just wants to earn money and doesn't care about the country, we strongly condemn Sharma for performing during PSL\", Sena said.

Sharma used foul language and asked the journalist his reason for writing negative and biased articles about him (Sharma). After the conversation went viral on social media, Sharma filed a police complaint against Vicky Lalwani, along with his ex-managers Preeti Simoes and Neeti Simoes, for trying to extort INR 25 lakhs from him as well as alleging in a police complaint that both sisters used to take money from the people who arrived in Film City, Mumbai to see his show and Preeti-Neeti manufactured miss understandings between him and his fellow comedians of his show and arriving guests.[52] Simoes condemned all of these allegations as false and made-up stories. Preeti Simoes also claimed she had been Sharma's girlfriend for 8 years until his engagement.[40][53] She and her sister Neeti Simoes worked in Kapil Sharma's production or with him for eight years until 2017.[54] She claimed that trouble erupted between Preeti and Kapil after he announced his engagement with Ginni Chatrath in March 2017. Sharma also abused SpotboyE and its editor Vicky Lalwani through a series of tweets, which his employees tried to cover up by saying his account was hacked until Sharma later confessed that the abusive tweets were written by himself.
