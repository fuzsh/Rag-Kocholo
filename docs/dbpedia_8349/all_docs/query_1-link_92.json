        "text": "The day was July 31 when the UPSC cancelled the candidature of Puja Manorama Dilip Khedkar, a 2023-batch IAS officer of the Maharashtra cadre, and debarred her from all future exams held by the commission. But why?\n\nThe spark of the Khedkar controversy ignited after she was allegedly found to be using a red and blue beacon on her personal car.\n\nNot just this, she also ‘occupied’ the chamber of additional collector Ajay More without permission. She reportedly removed office furniture without the officer's consent.\n\nAlso read: NBEMS rubbishes claims of NEET-PG question leak by 'unscrupulous agents', files police complaint\n\nKhedkar was later transferred after Pune collector Suhas Divase wrote a letter to the chief secretary of Maharashtra, wherein, reports suggest, “she sought special privileges, which were not allowed to an IAS probationary officer.”\n\nMoreover, the Pune Police had reportedly said action would be taken against Khedkar for the misuse of beacon lights on her private vehicle.\n\nRTI Activists claimed Khedkar’s appointment was questionable\n\nRTI activist Vijay Kumbhar had claimed amid the controversy that Puja Khedkar's appointment was questionable, as she did not fall under the OBC non-creamy layer category as opposed to her appearing in the civil services exam under the OBC and visually impaired categories. Kumbhar said Khedkar’s father had assets worth ₹40 crore.\n\nIn fact, as per news agency reports, an official had told the media that Khedkar had allegedly submitted fake disability and Other Backward Class (OBC) certificates to clear the civil services exam.\n\nAlso read: NEET UG: Delhi HC dismisses candidate's plea alleging out-of-syllabus question\n\nThe reports added that she was asked to report at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi for verification of her disability certificate in April 2022, but she did not do so, citing Covid infection.\n\nPuja Khedkar’s alleged disability:\n\nKhedkar had in 2022 reportedly obtained a 7 per cent locomotor disability certificate from Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial (YCM) Hospital, despite the physiotherapy department reporting there was no disability as such. She allegedly used the certificate to take the civil service exam more than the prescribed number of times.\n\nCandidates must have at least a 40 percent disability to qualify for reservation benefits, states the UPSC.\n\nUPSC issued official notice:\n\nOn July 19, the UPSC issued an official notice wherein the commission said it had “conducted a detailed and thorough investigation in the misdemeanour of Puja Manorama Dilip Khedkar, a provisionally recommended candidate of the Civil Services Examination-2022.”\n\nFurther informing about the investigation, the UPSC wrote, “It has been revealed that she fraudulently availed attempts beyond the permissible limit under the Examination Rules by faking her identity by way of changing her name, her father’s & mother’s name, her photograph/ signature, her email ID, mobile number and address.”\n\nSubsequently, on July 31, the UPSC issued another press statement wherein it informed that it had decided to cancel the provisional candidature of Khedkar. In the statement, the commission stated that “it has carefully considered the request of Puja Manorama Dilip Khedkar and in order to meet the ends of justice, she was granted time till 3:30 pm on 30th July 2024 so as to enable her to submit the response to the Show Cause Notice.”\n\nThe notice further added, “It was also categorically made clear to Puja Manorama Dilip Khedkar that it was the last and final opportunity for her and no further extension in time would be allowed. It was also conveyed to her in unequivocal terms that if no response was received by the aforesaid date/time, the UPSC would take further action without entertaining any further reference from her. Despite an extension in time allowed to her, she failed to submit her explanation within the prescribed time.”\n\nAlso read: NEET PG 2024 Admit Card releasing today at natboard.edu.in, here’s how to download\n\n“The UPSC has thoroughly examined the available data of more than 15,000 finally recommended candidates of the CSEs from the year 2009 to 2023 i.e. for 15 years with respect to the number of attempts availed by them. After this detailed exercise, barring the case of Ms. Puja Manorama Dilip Khedkar, no other candidate has been found to have availed more number of attempts than permitted under the CSE Rules,” the commission said.\n\nPuja Khedkar’s mother was apprehended on July 18:\n\nIt was during the same time when Manorama Khedkar, mother of Puja Khedkar, was apprehended on July 18 from a lodge in Hirkaniwadi village near Mahad in Raigad district, where she had been hiding.\n\nAn FIR was registered by the Pune Police after a video showing Manorama Khedkar threatening a group of men with a gun had gone viral, adding to the woes of Puja Khedkar. The Pune Rural Police on later Friday evening said a probe would begin to ascertain facts, including if she possessed a license for the firearm.\n\nThe Pune Rural Police has registered the FIR against Manorama, her husband Dilip Khedkar, and five others based on a complaint by a farmer who alleged that he was threatened by Manorama. The FIR under sections 323, 504, and 506 of IPC was registered at the Paud police station. Charges under the Arms Act were also been included.\n\nAfter a brief judicial custody, Manorama was granted bail and released on August 3, 2024.\n\nDelhi Court denies anticipatory bail to Puja Khedkar on August 1\n\nOn August 1, Delhi's Patiala House court had denied Puja Khedkar's anticipatory bail plea. The court had noted that the Delhi Police needed to broaden its investigation and instructed the police to determine if any UPSC insiders were involved in helping her achieve her goal.\n\nPuja Khedkar moves Delhi High Court, says didn’t receive cancellation order\n\nOn August 7, Puja Khedkar moved the Delhi High Court challenging the UPSC’s decision to cancel her candidature. She said she was yet to receive the UPSC order cancelling her candidature and only got to know the development through the media.\n\nThe UPSC, in its response, stated that it would provide Puja Khedkar with the order cancelling her candidature within two days. The high court has granted Khedkar the liberty to approach the appropriate forum to challenge the cancellation of her candidature."
