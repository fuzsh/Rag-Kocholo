        "text": "A – This is a very tricky question for me. I would say I am a fitness person, Roadies Real Hero 2019 contestant. By education, I am a civil engineer. But by profession, I am a fitness enthusiast.\n\nWas your childhood dream the same as where you are right now?\n\nA – We all have had different and variety of dreams when we were children. It’s funny to say, but as I child, I always wanted to dress up. My dream was to dress up in different clothes and go to college. I was a chubby kid and I wanted to be in shape and get fit. That was what I always dreamt of.\n\nWhat was your steppingstone to Roadies?\n\nA – It was a 15-year-old Pooja who was crazy about Roadies, who watched it regularly in a house with people who did not like Roadies much. I first went for Roadies audition with my boyfriend, Gaurab, where he got selected but not me. I was not ready to give up. Later, after two year, I gave my audition again in 2019 and that is how I got into Roadies Real Hero 2019. If you really love something, you should keep trying till you achieve it. Because one day you will succeed.\n\nHow did your family support your decision?\n\nA – It is not very normal for Indian families to accept the fact that their children want to take up fitness as their career/ profession. Same was the case with me as well. But once you prove yourself, taking up whatever you want to do, they will definitely love it and support you for what you are. Moreover, it is your life and you are the one to decide. My family is quite happy to see me where I have reached and are very proud of me.\n\nHow was the response from society?\n\nA – To be honest, it was hard in the beginning. I still get judged for wearing short clothes and posting pictures on social media. People will always judge you and not everyone is happy to see others succeed. Believe in yourself, do what you love to do and always look at the positive side. That way you will always be happy.\n\nHow does it feel to be where you are right now?\n\nA – It feels very normal, but extremely happy.\n\nWhat is success for you?\n\nA – People think success is either being rich or famous. On the other hand, at the end of the day, if you are happy and enjoying what you do in your life, that is success to me.\n\nHow do you manage your time?\n\nA – I don’t know how to answer this question. I love what I do and everything I do so I end up making time for it. So that’s just it.\n\nFavourite part of the day?\n\nA – Spending time with my family. That includes my boyfriend, Gaurab and my two dogs, Oscar and Karma.\n\nDescribe your style.\n\nA – My style is either very comfortable or just over the top. No in-between for me.\n\nHow do you relate yourself to the brand Teejh?\n\nA – Teejh is about being who you are and still holding on to the Indian values. The same way how my fitness routines are personalised. All my diet plans include Desi meals and sustainable exercises & food plans.\n\nAdvice to women who want to get fit."
