        "text": "30 Jun 2024 | 02:58am IST\n\n1 WEEK GONE. WHERE IS POOJA SHARMA?\n\nIs the investigation serious when side actors are picked up to show “progress” while Queen-pin accused is nowhere to be found\n\nTeam Herald\n\nPANJIM: A full week after the Assagao demolition and brutal kidnapping of two members of a Goan family, the first accused in the original FIR Pooja Sharma, accused of kidnapping, is still at large.\n\nSP Crime Branch Rahul Gupta told O Heraldo: “Summons will now be sent to her.”\n\nSharma is listed as the ‘owner’ of the property which was demolished where the occupant family of the Agarwadekars lived.\n\nIt may be recalled that DGP Jaspal Singh was quick off the block a day after the horrific incidents on June 22 but he himself is under a cloud with the government not yet denying the very serious allegations levelled against him by suspended Anjuna PI.\n\nMeanwhile, machine operators, bouncers and other side actors are being picked up, to show that investigators are progressing\n\nThe Crime Branch has sent search teams to multiple locations to notify Sharma under Section 41 A to join the investigation. But it’s clear that they have failed to zero in on Sharma.\n\nWhile the clamour gathers over the political and civil case, the fact of the matter is that Goa Police have drawn a complete blank on Pooja Sharma.\n\nThere is no information on Pooja Sharma. She may be an unknown name for the common man but sources in government offices mainly those who work in the Land and Survey and line departments have suggested that Pooja Sharma is a common name at least in North Goa.\n\n“The name is commonly heard in the Mamlatdar, Deputy Collector’s office. All are silent as they don’t want to get caught up in the whirlwind of the controversy,” the government source said.\n\nThe saga of demolishing the Agarwadekars’ house at Assagao took new twists and turns when the family decided to withdraw the complaint filed against land owner Pooja Sharma.\n\nAn emissary from Mumbai believed to be the representative of Sharma, arrived at Assagao and assured Agarwadekar family that the land owner would rebuild the demolished portion of the house and that the land owner would not remove them by illegal means."
