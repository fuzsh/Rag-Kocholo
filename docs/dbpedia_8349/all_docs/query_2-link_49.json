        "text": "India’s new T20I skipper Suryakumar Yadav hilariously revealed that he’s waiting to listen to Rohit Sharma’s one liners in the upcoming ODI series against Sri Lanka. Notably, Suryakumar led India to a 3-0 whitewash over Sri Lanka in his first series as full time skipper. In the third T20I, the 33-year-old even turned hero with the ball as he didn’t let Sri Lanka score six runs off the last over and ended up picking two wickets to tie the game.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIndia eventually won the game in super over with Suryakumar scoring a boundary off the first ball itself to complete a 3-0 series win. Following the game, the star batter wished good luck to India’s ODI skipper Rohit Sharma who will be leading the team in the 50-over format. Suryakumar revealed that he will be eagerly waiting to listen to his one-liners on the field.\n\n“All the best for ODIs, I will watch the complete series and will wait for your one-liners. I know you will be standing near the stump mic, there are several new guys in the team. Hopefully, we will get to listen to several more one-liners,” said Suryakumar in a video shared by the BCCI.\n\nWatch the video here:\n\nRohit-Kohli to return in Sri Lanka Odis\n\nNotably, Rohit Sharma is known for his witty remarks which are often caught on stump mic during matches. The Indian skipper is usually seen at his unfiltered best as he engages in fun banter with his teammates, opposition players and even umpires.\n\nHence, Rohit’s witty side will be once again on show in the upcoming series as he marks his return to the ODI squad after the World Cup final last year. Star batter Virat Kohli will also be featuring in the upcoming series as he also makes his return to the 50-over format after a record-breaking World Cup campaign.\n\nThe 35-year-old scored 765 runs in the tournament at an average of 95.62 with three hundreds and six fifties to his name. He will be eager to continue his form in the lead up to the Champions Trophy 2025 as Sri Lanka series begins from Friday, August 2."
