        "text": "3 mindset shifts as you get into a P&L Leader Role: The P&L Leader role (the CEO of your business/vertical) is an Operating Role where you are responsible for the Delivery of Tangible and Comprehensive Targets around profitability, cashflow, volumes, etc. However, it is also a role where you need to Identify & Drive Strategic Priorities to transform the business. The Corner Office role is more about operating in the Unknown-Unknown Zone unlike most of the roles one may have done in the run up to this role where you are generally working in the Known-Known or Known-Unknown Zone. There are 3 mindset shifts that I have found to be helpful as you get into the role: 1. Create a \"Mental Safe Zone\" for yourself on the Operating Results. The temptation to jump right in when there is a mini crisis or shortfall in operating targets is very high, and before you know, it consumes most of your time and bandwidth (as you can always make that little extra impact with your involvement!). You need to Resist this Temptation and guide the team but not jump in to participate most of the time. You need to create a Safe Zone for yourself where you don't panic and jump into the action 2. Build your External Network. While you are very familiar and comfortable with the interactions within your team (given you are the boss, they will of course give you all the \"right\" messages & feedback!!), you need to build a diverse external network (external to your team) to get a sense of what's happening in the broader company/industry/economy. While everyone is focused on the internal action, you need to keep an eye on things happening around you 3. Create \"New Dots\". While people put a lot of focus on 'connecting the dots', I feel you first need to ensure you Create New Dots - how these connect to each other in times to come you may not even realize. Serendipity is very powerful and you need to increase your chances of such serendipitous gains by ensuring you create enough new dots Try to focus on these 3 and create enough time for yourself by doing 1 to be able to spend on points 2 & 3!! #ceoinsights #campustalks #careerwars #careerdevelopment #leadership #leadershipdevelopment #CreatingDots #mentorship\n\nI had one of the most emotional days at work yesterday - I almost teared up. Not because I failed to deliver my work or faced pressure or stress. It was about leadership. Throughout my career, feedback was always focused on my work, helping me deliver good results for various organizations. However, when it came to managing people, I often received advice to be stricter and put more pressure on my team. Surprisingly, I have also had comments like I support and trust my team too much. Every time I heard such things, I would lose my confidence as a person leading and managing people. However, I still stayed true to my beliefs and observations about creating a safe, secure, and trustworthy environment for my team. Rarely have I come across people who would agree with the way I operate as a manager. Yesterday, for the first time in the last 8.5 years, I felt proud of the way I operated and managed my team. I realized that it is right to create a safe, secure, and trustworthy environment for my team. And that I was right when I thought about empowering and upskilling individuals instead of just assigning tasks. I'm proud of the way I operate and how it has allowed my team to thrive. I’d like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Robin and Jagadeesh for their invaluable insights during the leadership training workshop at Kovai.co in the last two days. To my fellow leaders and those on the path of managing teams: Trust yourself, embrace your unique approach, and, above all, lead with authenticity. Most importantly accept that everybody is different in their approach. It took me 8.5 years, but yesterday, I felt the pride of staying true to my values. Here's to many more years of fostering trust, empowerment, and success together as a team! #leadership #teambuilding\n\nMy Unpopular Opinion: Product Leaders, Stop Focusing on Low-Performers! In the last 7 years, I've worked for 15 companies across 8 industries as a Product Consultant, and I've seen Product Leaders making the same mistake over and over: 👉 They often expend excessive energy on low-performing team members at the expense of their high-performers. I get it. The instinct to bring everyone up to the same level is strong, and it feels like the fair thing to do. But let's be real—it's not fair to the people who are consistently creating and delivering value. So, how do you strike the balance? For High-Performers: 1️⃣ Prioritize Professional Development: They often crave challenges. Provide opportunities for them to grow. 2️⃣ Delegate Wisely: Assign impactful tasks that recognize their skills and frees up your time. 3️⃣ Regular Recognition: A simple thank you can go a long way in maintaining their job satisfaction. For Low-Performers: 1️⃣ Set Clear Expectations: Be explicit about what’s expected and how they can improve. 2️⃣ Structured Feedback: Use regular, but brief, check-ins to provide constructive feedback. 3️⃣ Leverage Peer Mentoring: Sometimes the best advice comes from peers. Facilitate a mentorship structure within your team. 🤔 What strategies have you employed to find the right balance between nurturing high-performers and improving low-performers?

This Monday, I'm excited to share insights on three critical areas that can transform your leadership journey and drive success: 🔹 Executive Coaching: Overcome team resistance by ensuring clear communication and building trustful relationships. When your team understands 'What's In It For Me' (WIIFM), engagement and acceptance follow naturally. 🔹 Performance Management: Address poor performance and its emotional impact by acknowledging the struggle, motivating your team with clear direction, and rebuilding confidence through support and back-to-basics coaching. 🔹 Sales Effectiveness: Craft a compelling sales change message by explaining the need for change, demonstrating market knowledge, and highlighting your team's strengths. Show them the exciting opportunities ahead with agility and proactivity. Dive into the comments for more detailed strategies and join the conversation! Let's embrace this new month with renewed energy and a commitment to excellence. 💪✨ 🚀Link in the 1st comment, 👇and let's drive our professional journeys forward together. ➕ follow me and The Agile Brain® / inoib 🔔 get notified on my posts #Leadership #ExecutiveCoaching #PerformanceManagement #SalesEffectiveness #JulyRefresh #MondayMotivation #theagilebrain #inoib\n\nWhen you can help the new joiners to cross the dreadful waters in the initial days, results will follow. Every single person who joins a new company joins with expectations along with a lot of confusion. Expecting them to deliver on the very first day is unrealistic. The results won’t start changing drastically as soon as someone joins; you have to accept that that’s not how it works. You need to give them that time and bandwidth to understand your culture, to get along with your team, to get along with you, and to feel comfortable; all of this takes some time So, as a manager/recruiter/leader, be patient with them, carry them along initially, and run with them if you have to, but become a go-to person for them. Rather than being that person who hires and forgets, be that person who can make people feel that you can change their lives. This is how you onboard - with the patience to teach, run, and help them grow along with you.

Sipping her coffee ☕, she glanced at her CliftonStrengths® profile on the noticeboard: Input, Futuristic, Harmony, Focus, Activator. These weren't just traits; they were her beacons in a challenging journey ahead 🛤️. Just a week ago, Astha felt the jitters 🦋. But then, she channels her 'Input' strength💪. Astha sought feedback from peers, consulted with senior leaders, and gathered valuable data. She wasn't alone; she had the power of collective wisdom behind her🤝. Astha's 'Futuristic' strength came to the forefront in her first appraisal meeting. She focused not just on past performances but on unlocking future potential. The discussions evolved from retrospective analysis to forward-thinking strategies💡, inspiring her team and herself. Her 'Harmony' strength eased her through different opinions and potential conflicts 🕊️. With a flair for finding common ground, she transformed challenging moments into constructive dialogues 🗣️. Astha's 'Focus' brought clarity and productivity to the forefront, setting realistic goals and clear paths forward 🎯. There was no beating around the bush; it was all about tangible targets and actionable plans. And with 'Activator' in her arsenal, Astha turned plans into action 🚀. Her enthusiasm was infectious, propelling her team towards their goals with renewed vigor 🌟. Astha realized this was more than a series of meetings as the appraisal season wrapped up. It was an enlightening journey of connection, learning, and growth 🌱. Her CliftonStrengths® didn't just guide her; they revolutionized her approach. This story echoes a powerful truth from Dr. Donald Clifton 📚. To every new manager out there, take a page from Astha's book 📘. 🔥 Your Call to Action Reflect on your CliftonStrengths®.

It’s important to recognize each individual’s strengths and areas of growth and have ongoing open channels of feedback. I’m really proud of the fact that I’ve had a hundred percent retention of my direct reports over the last two years, even with the great resignation and change brought about by bringing together four companies. And I’ve done this by building strong bonds with each person, establishing a collaborative culture, and listening. I understand what their goals are and how I can best support them, whether that’s within my team or being promoted to other teams as well.” I had the pleasure of talking with Michael Lubansky about his experience in product mangagment. Michael shares his experience working at RIA in a Box when it was acquired by COMPLY, thereby tripling total headcount and becoming five companies with four different platforms. He discusses the challenges that came with that, namely navigating new stakeholder processes and keeping the right people informed in product decisions. Michael also talks about the importance of not keeping a static view of the roadmap and adjusting the product vision based on changing circumstances.
