        "text": "Project:\n\nPooja Sharma, the founder of Bright The Soul Foundation, is a beacon of compassion and service in her community. Through her remarkable dedication, she has taken on the solemn responsibility of performing funeral rites for unidentified bodies, ensuring they receive a dignified farewell. Since 2022, Pooja has conducted final rites for more than 4000 such souls, a testament to her unwavering commitment to this noble cause.\n\nThe heart of Pooja’s service lies in the monthly rituals where she lays to rest around 400 bodies, a solemn reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of honoring every individual, regardless of their circumstances. After completing the rites, Pooja collects the ashes of these departed souls and journeys to the sacred banks of the river Ganga in Haridwar on every Amavasya, a time of spiritual significance. There, she immerses the ashes, ensuring their souls find peace in the divine waters.\n\nPooja’s journey into this compassionate service was deeply personal. The loss of her brother in a tragic accident became the catalyst for her mission to provide a dignified farewell to those who had no one else to perform their last rites. Her profound empathy and sense of duty have guided her through countless ceremonies, each one a solemn reminder of the value of every life, known or unknown.\n\nHowever, despite her unwavering dedication, Pooja faces financial challenges in continuing this vital service. The cost of performing last rites for each body, amounting to around 5000 INR, along with the logistical expenses, has placed a strain on her resources. One critical need is the acquisition of an ambulance dedicated to transporting bodies from the mortuary to the cremation site efficiently and respectfully.\n\nTo address this need, Pooja seeks support from generous donors who understand the importance of her work. The acquisition of an ambulance, which requires 25,00,000 INR, would significantly enhance the efficiency and reach of her services, ensuring that more souls receive the dignified farewell they deserve.\n\nBy supporting Pooja Sharma and Bright The Soul Foundation, donors can contribute to a cause that transcends boundaries and speaks to the universal values of compassion and dignity. Every donation brings us closer to a world where every life, regardless of circumstance, is honored and remembered with respect and empathy."
