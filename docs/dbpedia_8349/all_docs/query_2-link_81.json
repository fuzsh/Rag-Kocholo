        "text": "The protest descended into violence, resulting in a mob setting fire to a government building housing offices of the collector and superintendent of police along with more than 150 vehicles.\n\nRaising the issue during Zero Hour, former chief minister and senior Congress MLA Bhupesh Baghel said the violence and arson was a result of the poor law and order situation and intelligence failure as well as the administration not taking the vandalising of the victory pillar seriously.\n\nOther Congress legislators supported him on the issue and demanded discussion, while BJP MLAs opposed it claiming a judicial probe into the incident was already underway and, therefore, discussing it would be against the rules of the House.\n\nAssembly Speaker Raman Singh said the opposition members can keep their issue without mentioning the points being covered under the judicial probe.\n\nBaghel claimed police personnel were seen running away to save their lives during the protest, and property worth crores and very important documents in the district office, SP office and many other offices were destroyed, which had tarnished the image of peace-loving Chhattisgarh.\n\nCongress MLAs, who alleged its party workers and innocent people were being arrested in connection with the violence, demanded the resignation of CM Sai and Deputy CM Sharma.\n\nIn his reply, Sharma said it was incorrect to say the government had failed in handling the situation in Balodabazar.\n\nOn June 8, Satnami community members had informed the district administration that they wanted to organise a peaceful demonstration and 500 police personnel were deployed when some 8,000 people took out a rally on June 10, he said.\n\nHowever, anti-social elements broke the barricades and indulged in rioting and arson, Sharma told the House, adding 14 cases were registered at various police stations and several people arrested.\n\nThe collector and SP were also suspended in connection with the violence, Sharma said.\n\nAfter Sharma’s reply, the speaker disallowed the adjournment motion notice, though Congress MLAs continued demanding a discussion on the adjournment motion notice.\n\nThe speaker adjourned the House for lunch till 3pm and when it resumed, Congress legislators, demanding a discussion on the issue, trooped into the Well of the House and were automatically suspended.\n\nThe speaker then announced the suspension of opposition members and took up listed business for the day.\n\nThe opposition members remained in the Well of the House shouting slogans against the state’s BJP government and demanding the resignations of CM Sai and Deputy CM Sharma.\n\nAfter the listed business of the day was completed, speaker Raman Singh adjourned the House for the day.
