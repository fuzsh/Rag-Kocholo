Biography

Sato was born in Tokyo, Japan. He began playing piano at the age of six, and made his first composition, a piece for guitar, at the age of twelve. His first job was at Telenet Japan, where he composed the score for the action role-playing game XZR and popular side-scroller Valis II. After leaving Telenet, he joined Glodia, and together with Nobuhito Koise, composed the soundtrack to the cult Emerald Dragon. Later he would compose both Vain Dream with Abreath Nakamura and Bible Master II. After leaving Glodia, he joined Birdie Software, and produced soundtracks for four of their games. Currently, he produces music for Nippon Ichi, which is where he has gained his greatest recognition, for games such as the Marl Kingdom series, Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, La Pucelle: Tactics, and Phantom Brave.

Musical style and influence

Sato cites Queen, Claude Debussy, Ryuichi Sakamoto, and Kate Bush as major musical influences.
