        "text": "Live Recording: Episode 150\n\nTo honor the 150th episode of The Legacy Music Hour, Brent and Rob are inviting the listeners and anyone else interested to sit in on the recording. This is just like a normal free play episode where Brent and Rob pick some tracks and comment on them, except there will be some extra microphones so that anyone who attends can chime in and comment as well. Previous LMH guests will also make appearances. So think of this as a sort of listening party or like a regular episode but with a lot more guests than usual.\n\nThe recording will take place at 7pm sharp on Thursday, September 5, 2013 at the Zephyr Theatre in Los Angeles, CA. It'll take about two hours to record. If you live in the area, feel free to come and bring who ever you like, as long as they won't be bored by people listening and talking about video game music.\n\nThe Legacy Music Hour 150th Episode Recording\n\nSeptember 5th, 2013\n\n7pm - 9pm\n\nZephyr Theatre\n\n7456 Melrose Ave.\n\nLos Angeles, CA 90036\n\nEpisode 147: Golf Games\n\nGolf games have proven to be a great source of music in past episodes, so Brent and Rob finally dedicate an entire episode to golf games and really dig up some good tracks, many of which are pretty elevatory and jazzy.
