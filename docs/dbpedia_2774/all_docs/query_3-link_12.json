        "text": "Wolfteam (株)ウルフチーム Urufu Chīmu?) was a Japanese video game development company founded in 1986 as a Telenet subsidiary.The company was renamed in 2003 when Telenet Japan sold part of its stake and made Namco the majority shareholder. Namco Tales Studio continues to be the primary developer of the Tales RPG series, as they had been since the series' beginning. Wolfteam were best known for developing the Arcus series of games as well as Earnest Evans.\n\nHistory[]\n\nOriginally headed by Masahiro Akishino, Wolfteam became independent from Telenet in 1987, was reintegrated in 1990 and got merged with another Telenet subsidiary called Lasersoft, then was completely absorbed in an internal restructuring at Telenet in 1993 at which point most of the staff left together with Akishino.\n\nThe remaining staff were the then-very-young programmer Yoshiharu Gotanda, designer Masaki Norimoto, director Joe Asanuma, graphic artist Yoshiaki Inagaki, sound composer Motoi Sakuraba, and sound effect designer Ryota Furuya. Wolfteam went on to create games such as Sol Feace and Hiouden: Mamono-tachi tono Chikai, which faced weak sales due to Telenet's bad reputation. For Tale Phantasia, a game concept by Gotanda, they looked for an outside publisher with a better reputation.[2] After approaching Enix, Telenet struck a contract with Namco.\n\nNamco, however, insisted upon many changes to the game, including renaming the title to Tales of Phantasia. The conflict over these changes pushed the game's release from 1994 into late 1995. Most of the initial staff left during this dispute and founded tri-Ace in early 1995.\n\nTo continue the lucrative arrangement with Namco to develop the Tales series, Telenet re-staffed Wolf Team and retained some other staff, such as Motoi Sakuraba, on a freelance basis. They developed or co-developed nearly every game in the series until Wolf Team was renamed to Namco Tales Studio in early 2003, and Namco assumed majority ownership. In October 2007, Telenet filed for bankruptcy, and closed its doors, likely putting an end to the Wolf Team name.\n\nIn 2011, Namco Tales Studio was finally dissolved and the staff was merged with its main company, Namco-Bandai.\n\nDeveloped games[]\n\nAs Wolfteam[]\n\nAisle Lord\n\nAnett Futatabi\n\nArcus\n\nArcus II: Silent Symphony\n\nArcus III\n\nArcus Odyssey\n\nAkushu: Kagerou no Jidai wo Koe te\n\nApros: Daichi no Shou Kaze no Tankyuu Sha hen\n\nCobra Command\n\nCrystal Chaser: Tenkuu no Masuishou\n\nD: European Mirage\n\nDaitoua Mokujiroku Goh\n\nDiamond Players\n\nDigital Devil Story: Megami Tensei (MSX)\n\nDevastator\n\nDino Land\n\nEarnest Evans\n\nEl Viento\n\nFhey Area\n\nFinal Zone (FZ Senki AXIS)\n\nGaudi: Barcelona no Kaze\n\nGranada\n\nGoh 2\n\nGulf War Soukouden\n\nHiōden\n\nHiōden 2\n\nHiōden: Mamono-tachi tono Chikai\n\nJinmu Denshou\n\nMid-Garts\n\nNeugier: Umi to Kaze no Kōdō\n\nNiko^2\n\nRoad Avenger\n\nRyū: Naki no Ryū Yori\n\nShinsengumi: Bakumatsu Genshikou\n\nSol-Feace/Sol-Deace\n\nSpan of Dream\n\nSuzaku\n\nTales of Destiny\n\nTales of Destiny 2\n\nTales of Eternia\n\nTales of Phantasia\n\nTales of Phantasia: Narikiri Dungeon\n\nTales of the World: Narikiri Dungeon 2\n\nTenbu Limited / Mankan Zenseki\n\nTenbu: Sangokushi Seishi\n\nThe Grail Hunter\n\nTokyo Twilight Busters\n\nTime Gal\n\nYaksa\n\nZan: Kagerou no Toki\n\nZan: Yasha Enbukyoku\n\nZan II: Spirits\n\nZan 2: Kagerou no Jidai\n\nZan 2: Kagerou no Jidai Soshuhen\n\nZan 3: Tenun Ware ni Ari\n\nZan Gear\n\nAs Namco Tales Studio[]\n\nGame Title Release Date Platform Tales of Phantasia 1995,2003 SNES, Game Boy Advance Tales of Symphonia 2003/2004 Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2 Tales of Rebirth 2004/2008 PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable Tales of Eternia 2005 PlayStation Portable Tales of the Abyss 2005/2011 PlayStation 2, Nintendo 3DS Tales of the Tempest 2006 Nintendo DS Tales of Destiny 2 2007 PlayStation Portable Tales of Destiny (Director's Cut) 2006/2008 PlayStation 2 Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World 2008 Wii Tales of Vesperia 2008/2009 Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 Tales of Hearts 2008 Nintendo DS Tales of Graces 2009 Wii Keroro RPG: Kishi to Musha to Densetsu no Kaizoku 2010 Nintendo DS Tales of Phantasia: Narikiri Dungeon X 2010 PlayStation Portable Pac-Man Party 2010 Wii Tales of Graces F 2010 PlayStation 3 Tales of Xillia 2011 PlayStation 3 Pac-Man Party 3D 2011 Nintendo 3DS\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe most notable contributor from Wolfteam to the Valis series was Motoi Sakuraba, as he composed the music for the first game and its adaptions.\n\nExcept for the Valis series and Tales series, most of Wolfteam's games were never released outside Japan.\n\nWhen Telenet and Eants released the adult visual novel based on Valis (Valis X) in 2007, they also released another one based on Arcus (Arcus X) the same year.\n\nWolfteam is the only one of Telenet's subsidiaries that had an entire staff reforming.\n\n[]"
