        "text": "Here is a summer reading list from Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty and staff authors, including the following titles: “We’ve Got You Covered: Rebooting American Health Care” (Portfolio, 2023) by @Amy Finkelstein, professor of economics, and Liran Einav “Unmasking AI: My Mission to Protect What is Human in a World of Machines” (Random House, Penguin Random House, 2023) by Dr. Joy Buolamwini SM ’17, PhD ’22, member of the Media Lab Director’s Circle “Music and Mind: Harnessing the Arts for Health and Wellness” (Viking, Penguin Random House, 2024) Chapter by Tod Machover, the Muriel R. Cooper Professor of Music and Media; Rébecca Kleinberger SM ’14, PhD ’20; and Alexandra Rieger SM ’18, doctoral candidate in media arts and sciences “An Introduction to System Safety Engineering” (The MIT Press, 2023) by Nancy G. Leveson, professor of aeronautics and astronautics “Dare to Invent the Future: Knowledge in the Service of and Through Problem-Solving” (MIT Press, 2023) by Clapperton Chakanetsa Mavhunga, professor of science, technology, and society “Counting Feminicide: Data Feminism in Action” (MIT Press, 2024) by Catherine D’Ignazio, associate professor of urban science and planning “Data Is Everybody’s Business: The Fundamentals of Data Monetization” (MIT Press, 2023) by Barbara H. Wixom, principal research scientist at the MIT Sloan Center for Information Systems Research (MIT CISR); Leslie Owens, senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management and former executive director of MIT CISR; and Cynthia M. Beath “From Intention to Impact: A Practical Guide to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” (MIT Press, 2024) by Malia Lazu, lecturer in the MIT Sloan School of Management\n\nIn a talk at UCLA, Professor Tod Machover, head of the Media Lab’s Opera of the Future group, considered the impact of technology on music, from the Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) to generative AI. He also discussed the importance of collaboration—whether with other humans or with machines. “I’m not particularly interested, personally, in pushing a button and having a piece of music just generate on its own,” he said. “If you put some of your own personality in to shape something, it’s much more powerful. I’m really interested in using these systems to discover something, to find the sound, to find an idea, to find a relationship that’s really interesting…There’s a sweet spot, which isn’t random and which isn’t exactly copying, and it’s a different sweet spot, depending on who you are.”\n\nToday's the day! A brand-new production of Tod Machover’s VALIS—the first in nearly 30 years—premieres at the MIT Theater Arts Performance Space at 7:30pm ET! Directed by MIT Music and Theater Arts Professor Jay Scheib, the opera runs Sept. 8–10.

Based on a novel by Philip K. Dick, VALIS was Professor Machover’s first opera, premiering for the 10th Anniversary of the Centre Pompidou in Paris in December 1987. It tells the story of Horselover Fat, who has a devastating-yet-enlightening “pink light” experience, leading him to explore the blurred boundaries of reality and AI technology and consider the possibility of hope in a world where all knowledge is available but little of it is verifiable. In a society coming to grips with deepfakes and the rapid development of AI technology, the work is perhaps even more relevant today than it was when it was first produced."
