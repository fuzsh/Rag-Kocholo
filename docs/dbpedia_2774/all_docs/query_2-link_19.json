        "text": "Juan Daniel has been a fan of the Valis games since 1991. Living in Brazil the Valis games were not easy to come by, but he found ways to play the games. Now a passion of Juan's is music, so naturally Valis music had to be made! Juan has put a great deal of effort into creating these great tunes, and made them available to be exclusive to the Dark City Productions Valis pages!\n\nvalis 3 - sword evolution (visions of the future mix).mp3\n\nJuan Daniel's \"teaser.\" (he emailed this to me out of the blue)\n\nIt's a track from Valis 3. It is played when Yuko,Valna and Cham meet Nizetti.\n\nvalis 3 - stage 1.mp3link broken\n\nJuan's 2nd track, quite good!\n\nValis 2 - stage 1.mp3\n\nHe's done it again! I think this is the best Valis song from all of the games.\n\nvalis 3 stage 17.mp3 link broken\n\nWhat can I say? Juan's efforts are too cool for words, here is anther gem.\n\nvalis 3 - ending.mp3 link broken\n\nI made this remix..which is kind of a medley of the ending tune of Valis 3 and the initial tune of valis 1. I think they match....in some way! -Juan Daniel\n\nValis 2 (Dimensional Mix).mp3\n\nOk, now this is where it all changes. I suggested to Juan that he make another version of the Valis 2 stage 1 song, but \"trance style.\" He sent me this, and I was quite surprised. DOWNLOAD THIS ONE!\n\nValis 1 (Senshi Mix).mp3 link broken\n\nTrance style continues with this butt kicking track.\n\nValis 4 (Brande Mix).mp3 link broken\n\nMore of the good stuff. Trance action!\n\nvalis 2 (piano version).mp3 link broken\n\nThe 3rd version of Valis 2 level one, this time... sit back relax and enojy this nice piano piece! Now that I have actual space to store files enjoy...\n\nValis 4\n\nAll game data including ISO and music in .APE format.\n\nValis 3\n\nAll game data including ISO and music in .APE format.\n\nValis 2\n\nAll game data including ISO and music in .APE format.\n\nValis6.mid\n\nThis is music from Valis 2, forgot what level though...\n\nvalis.mid\n\nUhhh, not sure why I put this midi file up, near as I can tell it has nothing to do with Valis at all, but it resebles the name for some reason. I kind of like it!\n\nValis5.mid\n\nWell, this is the best midi I found, it's also from Valis 2."
