        "text": "@shonenjump86 The SNES version of Valis 4 sucks and the PC Engine version included is much better, as it includes extra playable characters. But the Genesis versions of Valis 1 and 2 included aren't as good as the PC Engine ones in the other collection.\n\nAlso the original MSX Valis is considered to be one of the worst games of all time - imagine stiff Castlevania 1 style jumps, constantly respawning monsters, and large but boring maze like levels.\n\nI'm definitely interested in these collections, although I agree that they've been managed horribly.\n\nThe thing is I have entries 1 and 3 on the Evercade, Mega Drive versions. Now Retro-Bit releases those and Syd of Valis on physical for the Mega Drive, yet the Switch collection has the PC Engine versions, the fourth entry and, aside from Valis 1 and Syd for the MD, also the MSX game, which is a surprise. Novelties are my soft spot.\n\nBut! In Japan they have the two collections (sadly separated also) on Switch cards, which would be my choice if those releases came translated, and it is not the case.\n\nI guess the way to go is buying these collections on a Western eShop, plus they get on sale every now and then. And you can pick individual titles too, which is a welcome possibility.\n\nA while ago I googled for lists of the best Sega Genesis games. I looked for long lists each at least 50 games long, that were ranked. I assigned points based on rank and added them all up. I was left with 16 lists, 396 unique games and 1,465 total entries.\n\nSyd of Valis didn't make the top 300 Sega Genesis games.\n\nValis: The Fantasm Soldier wasn't mentioned at all.\n\nI've googled around for top PC-Engine/TurboGrafx-16 games and the Valis series doesn't seem very popular there either.\n\nThe only Valis game I tried is the one that we all get as part of the NSO SNES app. I actually beat it all the way too. It was decently okay, but I could immediately tell the level design was not great. It had a distinct feel of a \"B-tier\" SNES game. Maybe even C-tier. It wasn't actively awful (for the most part), but it wasn't anything special by any means.\n\nI would definitely not pay so much for such an expensive collection of these games, especially when they're being extra greedy by splitting it up into two separate collections for no reason. ...And I normally LOVE retro collections on Switch!\n\nFirst collection is definitely the better one, as the PC Engine versions of Valis: The Fantasm Soldier and Valis III are actually quite good! Solid 8/10 action platformers in my book.\n\nValis IV on PCE (and in this collection) is vastly better than Super Valis IV on SNES and NSO.\n\nValis for MSX plays like absolute garbage, but I'm glad it's here nonetheless.\n\nYeah like many people have already mentioned Valis should have been one single collection not split into two. The only one worth getting in this collection is Valis 4, I'm hoping they release it as a standalone game like the previous collection did.\n\nAlso the price is way too high, the Canadian price for this is 60 dollars.\n\nI have some nostalgia for these games, having played them on TG-16 back in the day. I bought the 1st collection because it was cool to have 1-3 all in English (3 I think for the first time). I definitely missed 4 not being there, but THERE IS NO WAY I’M BUYING THIS COLLECTION JUST TO GET 4!\n\nAt first I thought this price was a joke. After considering what is offered and how much it costs, now I'm sure it is.\n\nI'm interested in this collection but I'll only get it if it gets a discount in the neighborhood of 80%.\n\nOnly 3 games is too little for that much!\n\nI can only think of another (reasonably) expensive 3 retro game collection, which is Blizzard's, but it contained much much better games and started to be considerably discounted some months after release.\n\n@John_Deacon ININ is the only other publisher that love to overprice their retro collections: Darius, Space Invaders, Turrican, Wonder Boy etc. They also have a ridiculous habit of releasing a cheaper but incomplete collection digitally, and another more complete collection for Limited Run, and release the latter digitally a few years later, screwing those who bought the cheaper collection. IIRC the last Wonder Boy collection they release cost $50 US, more than double the price of the TMNT collection where I live.\n\n@EarthboundBenjy \"Super\" Valis 4 on SNES NSO is actually heavily cut from the original PCE version, which had three playable characters, better designed levels, and whole sets of animated intros. Part of the appeal of the original is to utilise all three characters to see which fits the situation, whereas the SNES port combined them into one character and made their standard attacks into subweapons. It's pretty much comparing Castlevania Dracula X to Rondo of Blood.\n\n@PKDuckman\n\nI see. That's good to know. I may be interested in picking up the Valis collections later if they become cheaper, or combined into a single package or expanded to include more games or something. Even if the one on NSO isn't fully representative of the other games' quality, I still don't feel like the current offer is worth it."
