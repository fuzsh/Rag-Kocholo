        "text": "Go forth and fight for freedom!\n\nDeveloper: Jorudan\n\nPublisher: Vic Tokai\n\nRelease Dates: November 1992 (North America), December 14th, 1992 (Japan)\n\nAvailable On: SNES\n\nGenre: Shoot ‘Em Up (Vertical)\n\nAlso Known As: Kidou Soukou Dion (Japan)\n\nYou know, now that I think about it, there aren’t all that many shoot ’em ups on the Super Nintendo. Several of them were exclusive to Japan, not all of them were considered to be good games and/or good ports, and the majority of them utilized a horizontal layout for their gameplay. The ones that are good are really, really good, but a lot of the ones in between kind of fell off to the wayside over the years. If you use this list and include Imperium, you’ll see that there’s only 14 vertical STGs on the console! Well, as long as you don’t start lumping in run and guns and rail shooters, anyway. It’s no surprise that the genre flocked to other platforms where the hardware lent itself better to making these games really sing. The Mega Drive had the better CPU and thus didn’t have slowdown issues the way the SNES did and the PC Engine could turn these games into audiovisual feasts with the CD add-on (while also avoiding the slowdown issues), which makes tapping into the mecha anime inspirations that they were often drenched in all the easier. That makes Imperium here a slightly unusual footnote in that sense, I suppose. Not in terms of how it performs, because it sure does have some slowdown, but in terms of being a vertical game when horizontal ones seemed to be a bit more popular on the console. Compared to the genre as a whole, there’s really nothing novel about it at all, but if you compare it to its competition on the same platform, it fares a bit better and fills a niche that wasn’t overflowing with options. It is also worth mentioning, however, that it looks like an Aleste game, plays like an Aleste game, and even came out the same year on the same platform as Super Aleste, so, uh, that doesn’t help its case very much! Still, as long as you’re not expecting something exceptional or innovative, Imperium is a good time more often than not and I do think it has some interesting things going for it that make it deserve a bit more credit than it gets. And no, this game has nothing to do with the Amiga game of the same name from 1990.\n\nJorudan sure was an interesting developer! Their library worked out in such a way that you don’t exactly hear about their games often, but when you do, you’ll notice that they always had something interesting going on. Some of their games include Battle Bull, a Game Boy action puzzler that makes block pushing a competitive bloodsport (which is actually pretty similar to Planet Monsters, now that I think about it), 1 on 1, a basketball game that splits the difference with fighting games to create a clever spin on both genres, and Imadoki no Vampire: Bloody Bride, a dating sim where you play as a vampire who has to balance monster fighting with blood sucking and going on dates. All of that is extremely my jam, in case that wasn’t obvious by the strange depths of games I’ve covered here so far, so you can rest easy knowing their games have a chance at being covered here in the future. In case that isn’t interesting enough, they’re also involved in the travel industry and run a service called Japan Transit Planner that’s supposed to help you search for transit schedules and fare rates for trains and airplanes in Japan! Seems like that has been more lucrative for them than their gaming ventures, considering that their last credited game was from 2009! Imperium is one of the most tame and “normal” things they’ve done, honestly, which is probably why it’s one of their few games that was actually released outside of Japan, but what’s really interesting is that multiple sources claim it came out in North America before Japan; I wonder what the rationale behind that was?\n\nIn Japan, Imperium was called Kidou Soukou Dion, or “Mobile Armored Dion“, and along with its much better box art, the fact it was going for a Gundam or a Mazinger kind of thing was more obvious because of that title. That’s still obvious enough with the North American version thanks to the title screen clearly showing the titular giant robot, but it’s a shame the US version didn’t fully commit to the bit at the time. I can’t imagine that bizarre US box art drew too many people in! But I also say this because the game’s soundtrack had the involvement of none other than the underappreciated Tenpei Sato. As a composer who’s been doing game music since the late 80s, he’s had a hand in notable games like XZR, Valis II, Emerald Dragon, and pretty much all of NIS’ most well known RPGs over the years. Rhapsody, Disgaea, Phantom Brave, Makai Kingdom, Soul Nomad, Witch and the Hundred Knight, Labyrinth of Refrain, he’s involved with all of them and they all have great music! It’s strange to see him on the soundtrack of a shoot ’em up (he wasn’t the only person credited for sound on the game either, for reference), but if you ask me, his presence really works and elevates it into the most notable part of the game.\n\nYou see, Tenpei Sato’s music tends to have such triumphant, bombastic energy that makes it absolutely perfect for something like a Mecha anime or a tokusatsu show, so much so that it’s surprising he doesn’t appear to have worked on any of those things. The Disgaea series in particular is chock full of things you’d see in those kinds of shows – captivating character drama, a hero’s journey that sees the protagonist through highs and lows, characters that find strength in their bonds with others, and even Super Sentai teams and giant robots that are played for laughs. It’s a series that manages to make ridiculous concepts and parodies work so well by getting the player to laugh while also getting them further invested in the characters, and a big part of why that works is because of Tenpei Sato’s music. A strong emphasis on riveting guitars gives every major battle an intense vibe that encourages the player to fight for their lives, and the consistent use of vocals where it sounds like the singer is belting out notes for their very last performance can bring a man to tears with how passionate they are. Just listen to this and try not to get emotional and/or hyped during it! Because the music inspires you and pushes you to win, like an audience or a town of imperiled people cheering on their hero, you feel like you can do anything when Tenpei Sato’s music is backing you, and such intention is perfect for a shoot ’em up. This genre is the ultimate one man army story, a single, fragile machine up against nearly insurmountable odds, and knowing that the music itself compels you to keep trying until you save the day means so much when there’s no one else to support you.\n\nWhen Imperium was brought over to Japan, the content of the game was altered as well. Mechanically, everything’s the same aside from one of the weapons getting changed from a wave shot to a spherical projectile. The spherical projectile in the Japanese version actually homes in on enemies and is much more useful than the wave projectile in Imperium, so this change may have been their way of toning things down a bit based on feedback from the US version. The other change is significant; the Japanese version has a host of different backgrounds compared to the US release and they all look significantly nicer and make use of layering tricks to create more detailed and evocative environments. The first level makes this difference immediately clear – Imperium has you flying over a conventional looking city surrounded by greenery, but Kidou Soukou Dion has you flying over a gorgeous, brightly lit cityscape contrasted with the darkness of the night in the vein of something like Snatcher‘s Neo Kobe City. The former is serviceable, but the latter looks excellent, so it’s baffling that such changes were made. This extends throughout the game as well, with the second stage’s layered scaffolding being absent in Imperium. Suppose it makes for a valid reason to play through the game twice, at least!\n\nI mentioned fragility briefly two paragraphs ago, but Imperium actually tries to subvert this idea. The Dion mech is actually really sturdy for shoot ’em up standards and is capable of taking five hits before being destroyed. Still doesn’t sound like much for humanity’s only hope, but it’s a huge improvement over heroes elsewhere getting downed in a single hit! However, such a safety net comes with its downsides that serve to make this game exactly as hard as you’d expect from the genre. Your five hit points aren’t really units of health so much as they are lives, depending on how you choose to look at it, because as soon as you die once, it’s game over! Technically having five lives is still more generous than what shoot ’em ups typically do, but when you’re hit here, another penalty is incurred as well. Imperium employs an experience-based weapon system where destroying enough enemies will “level up” your mech and either grant you one of four weapons or level them up if you already have all four. This means that there aren’t conventional power-up drops (beyond the occasional extra bomb), which means you can focus on making sure no enemy gets away. Experience is granted depending on the enemy in question that you destroy – bigger and more dangerous ones are naturally going to be worth more than smaller ones. Each weapon goes up to level three and becomes tremendously powerful at that point, whereas they’re puny enough at level one that even basic enemies can take multiple salvos to destroy.\n\nIf this all sounds familiar to you, then congratulations for knowing (or reading my post) about Twinkle Tale! It’s also a similar system to that seen in Super Aleste, though that game does have more weapons available to use. Like in both of those games, taking hits causes your weapons to power-down, which can create a negative snowball effect if you get beat up quickly. It’s a cool system that I really liked in Twinkle Tale and I like it here too, especially in conjunction with the ability to adjust your speed levels at will taken straight out of Thunder Force III. Each weapon feels well suited for a variety of situations and I definitely encountered moments that became way easier once I tried a different weapon, but certain foes require both the right weapon AND the right speed. For example, some minibosses love to pull out a melee attack and pursue you around the screen, some of which are ridiculously fast. If you’re not immediately ready to switch to a higher speed, you’re gonna get smacked. It can feel cheap at times, since there’s no way to instantly select a weapon or speed level (you gotta tap the button repeatedly until it cycles to the right one), but I really appreciate when games actually expect you to use and master your entire arsenal. Every time I felt stuck and stumped, a different combination and a different approach was enough to get me through and earn my victory.\n\nWhen things are going well, Dion feels like a truly superpowered robot, capable of actually making good on the whole “one man army” thing. Your homing shot (if you’re playing the Japanese version!) is great for quickly taking out large groups of weak foes, your standard shot covers a good chunk of the screen, deals solid damage, and even covers behind you at level three, your star-shaped shot thing is good for covering you as you retreat or circle enemies, and the laser is a hugely powerful and focused way to destroy enemies directly in front of you. Just be careful with that laser because it flashes enough to probably be worthy of an epilepsy warning! If you start doing poorly, your super fighting robot becomes less and less super, though you can at least make things a little less painful by switching to the weapon that you care about the least since the one that levels down is the one you have equipped. Something tricky the game pulls on you is that once you’re maxed out, experience stops doing anything until you get hit again, which then causes the requirements for the next level to reset. This means that you can’t stockpile experience and then have it immediately level you back up if it satisfies the requirements. Understandable, but as someone who’s playing RPGs pretty much all the time, it never feels good to see experience go to waste. Should you die, the game only gives you a few continues and forces you to start at the beginning of the current level with zero power-ups, so this is the kind of game you really want to learn so that you never have to be in this situation.\n\nIf there’s one major complaint I could levy at Imperium, it’s that it doesn’t quite understand the idea that there can be too much of a good thing. There’s only six levels on offer here, taking you above that city and forest I mentioned, across an ocean base, to the moon and through space, and to a space base for a final confrontation against a golden robotic knight. That’s a perfectly good set of levels right there, but the problem here is that they go on for so incredibly long that some of them feel like they’re never going to end. The fourth level has a sequence of small, quick-firing turrets that repeats so many times that I thought I was stuck in a loop and I had to do something esoteric to break out of it! While the levels do have variety in their foes and hazards, it’s never quite enough to sustain just how long these levels are. The background loops, the music loops, you see the same enemy types crop up a bunch so some of the surprises wear off, your eyes start to burn from how much you’ve been using that laser, it’s all an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise generally solid game. Boss sometimes fall into a similar issue too; the fights against other mechs or giant hulking machines are consistently tense and flashy, but some of them fall into the trap of forcing you to wait for their entire attack routine to end before you have a brief chance of hurting them. The crab boss is a good example of this because both of its attacks take a long time and only leave a very narrow window of opportunity. If you’re in bad shape for that fight, it’s downright agonizing! Same thing with the first phase of the ninja robot fight: you’ve gotta wait for it to stop throwing shurikens before you get a handful of seconds to attack. I feel like you don’t see this kind of thing in shoot ’em ups too often and this is a good case study of why that is!\n\nI wasn’t quite sure what to expect with Imperium, but I’m glad I gave it a chance. Compile and Technosoft shoot ’em ups tend to work the best for me, so having a game that cribs from both of them felt cozy and immediately intuitive even if it’s not up to their level of quality. Even when things got difficult and I had to keep trying, Tenpei Sato’s riveting soundtrack kept pushing me forward just as it had in the past. I feel like STG fans are so hardcore and dedicated that it’s a bad sign when you don’t hear much about a game and how somebody is working on a perfect run of it (there’s a reason nobody talks about games like Deep Blue and L-Dis!), but it seems like Imperium just fell by the wayside for being good and not great. With so many top notch examples of the genre readily available, I can understand why Imperium doesn’t get much attention. But if you’ve played the heck out of the genre and want a taste of something most people aren’t familiar with, why not give this game a try? Everybody loves Compile STGs, so a look-alike’s gotta be at least worth a go, right? I sure think so! Just, uh, maybe don’t do what I did and play it late at night while tired, my eyes were seriously burning after that…\n\nMore Screenshots\n\nSources:\n\nRacketboy, Marurn, dunpeal2064, gszx1337, Tom Bordelon, G to the Next Level, & Rawblink.
