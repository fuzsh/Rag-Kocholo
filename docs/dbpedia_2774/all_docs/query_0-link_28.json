He began playing piano at the age of six, and made his first composition, a piece for guitar, at the age of twelve. His first job was at Telenet Japan, where he composed the score for the action role-playing game XZR and popular side-scroller Valis II. After leaving Telenet, he joined Glodia, and together with Nobuhito Koise, composed the soundtrack to the cult Emerald Dragon. Later he would compose both Vain Dream with Abreath Nakamura and Bible Master II. After leaving Glodia, he joined Birdie Software, and produced soundtracks for four of their games. Currently, he produces music for Nippon Ichi, which is where he has gained his greatest recognition, for games such as the Marl Kingdom series, Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, La Pucelle: Tactics, and Phantom Brave.\n\nMusical style and influence\n\nSato cites Queen, Claude Debussy, Ryuichi Sakamoto, and Kate Bush as major musical influences.\n\nWorks\n\nXZR: Hakai no Gūzō (1988) - with Shinobu Ogawa and Yujiroh\n\nXZR II: Kanketsuhen (Exile) (1988) - with Shinobu Ogawa\n\nCyber City (1989) - with Shinobu Ogawa\n\nValis II (1989) - with Shinobu Ogawa, Masahiro Kajiwara, and Jizou Kurabo\n\nEmerald Dragon (1989) - with Nobuhito Koise\n\nVain Dream (1991) - with Nobuhito Koise and Ikki Nakamura\n\nAlshark (1991)\n\nCal (1991)\n\nBeast (1991)\n\nCal II (1991)\n\nTask Force Harrier EX (1991)\n\nJoker 2 (1992)\n\nBeast 2 (1992)\n\nImperium (1992) - with Tatsuya Sato and Hiroki Uematsu\n\nBeast 3 (1993)\n\nRed: The Adventurous Sequence (1993)\n\nAlvaleak Continent (1993) - with Nobuhito Koise\n\nAlien vs. Predator (1993) - with Hisayoshi Ogura\n\nShinseiki Odysselya (1993) - with Hisayoshi Ogura\n\nBible Master II: The Chaos of Aglia (1994)\n\nEtemiburu: Tenjoumukyuu (1994)\n\nMagna Braban: Henreki no Yusha (1994) - with Tatsuya Sato\n\nAlshark (Sega CD) (1994)\n\nSuper Street Basketball 2 (1994)\n\nEko Eko Azaraku: Wizard of Darkness (1995)\n\nHard Blow (1997)\n\nCocktail Harmony (1998)\n\nRhapsody: A Musical Adventure (1998)\n\nCombat Choro Q (1999)\n\nLittle Princess: Puppet Princess of Marl Kingdom (1999)\n\nMagnetic Power Microman: Generation 2000 (1999)\n\nBrigandine: Grand Edition (2000)\n\nReal Pool (2000)\n\nPlay It Pinball (2000)\n\nAngel's Present: Chronicles of Marl Kingdom (2000)\n\nGadget Racers (2000)\n\nMarl de Jigsaw (2001)\n\nLa Pucelle: Tactics (2002)\n\nMarl Jong!!
