        "text": "As Ricky Bobby once said, \"you're either first or last.\"\n\nEpisode 476: First & Last\n\nThis is a neat little idea. Playing a track from a series first game and then from their latest. All the games here go way back. I think Kirby being the newest as the first game was from 1992 if memory serves me correctly. Well, actually I see the Bros. did not go with Street Fighter 1, but 2 instead, but a quick Wikipedia check tells me that was released in 1991. So Kirby is the babby of the group here.\n\nEpisode page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2021/7/11/episode-476-first-amp-last\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nSuper Mario Bros. - Koji Kondo - Overworld\n\nSuper Mario Odyssey - Naoto Kubo - New Donk City\n\nMega Man - Manami Matsumae - Cut Man\n\nMega Man 11 - Marika Suzuki - Dr. Wily Stage\n\nCastlevania - Kinuyo Yamashita, Satoe Terashima - Wicked Child\n\nCastlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 - Oscar Araujo - Satan\n\nKirby's Dream Land - Jun Ishikawa - Ending\n\nKirby Star Allies - Hirokazu Ando - Sudden Happy Ending\n\nSonic the Hedgehog - Masato Nakamura - Spring Yard Zone\n\nSonic Forces - Tomoya Ohtani - Network Terminal\n\nYs I: Ancient Ys Vanished - Yuzo Koshiro - Palace\n\nYs IX: Monstrum Nox - Hayato Sonoda, Takahiro Unisuga - New Life\n\nThe Legend of Zelda - Koji Kondo - Overworld\n\nThe Legend Of Zelda: Breath of The Wild - Yasuaki Iwata - Hateno Village\n\nFinal Fantasy - Nobuo Uematsu - Temple of Chaos\n\nFinal Fantasy XV - Yoko Shimomura - Valse Di Fantastica\n\nStreet Fighter II - Yoko Shimomura - Vega's Theme\n\nStreet Fighter V - Kanzuki Beach - Keiki Kobayashi - Malaysia Stage\n\nMetal Gear - Kazuki Muraoka - Jungle Infiltration\n\nMetal Gear Survive - Haruna Kubo - Do-Or-Die\n\nF@#k it! We'll do it live. WE'LL DO IT LIVE!!!!\n\nEpisode 477: Reeeemix 8: Covers\n\nThe Bros. have spoken. Live performances. Real instruments. Whatever you wanna call it. No Zircon-esque electro happening in this episode. I'm down with the constraint. The boom of live musicians covering vidya tunes has seemingly grown a lot. I know they aren't new to the game, but I've seen Bit Brigade live before (they aren't on this episode). That was 3 years or 2. Enough people came out to a small venue to watch them shred through Mega Man 3 music while a speedrunner did his thing. This episode has the right idea.\n\nEpisode page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2021/7/18/episode-477-reeeemix-8-covers\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nDr. Pez - Pokemon Trading Card Game - Normal Battle (Band Cover)\n\ninsaneintherain - Gangplank Galleon (Donkey Kong Country) Jazz Arrangement\n\nTim de Man - Zelda: Ocarina of Time - Hyrule Field Celtic Cover\n\nRu's Piano - Dragon Quest - Overture March\n\nTyler Mire - Hydrocity Zone Act II - High Octane Funk Big Band!\n\nKirby's Dream Band - Bat Out of HAL - Undertale\n\nRichaadEB & Ryan Lafford - Autumn Mountain Battle (Paper Mario: The Origami King) Cover\n\nThe Consouls - A Silly Talking Fish (Shovel Knight King of Cards) Jazz Cover\n\nSuper Guitar Bros. - Super Mario 64 - Bowser's Road - Acoustic Guitar Cover\n\nDwelling of Duels Various Artists - The Devil's Spear\n\nThe 8-Bit Big Band feat.

Points out that something got screwed up by the team implementing the track into the game:\n\nIt's interesting you mention that. I only used a DX-7 and a Roland 505 drum machine and I had everything the way I wanted it. When the game came out, somehow they managed to change some of the sounds that I had laid down. Also, the phrasing. They quantized it a bit and screwed up my original performance.\n\nBut I still have to admit it ain't exactly making my ears smile haha. Rough listen and not a track I'd show someone to convince them that even games in the olden days had worthwhile tunes based on songwriting alone.\n\nedit: By the way. I haven't added any posts from the bonus episodes the Bros. have put out the past 2 weeks. I'll just let those pass by. I'll update this thread when a regular numbered episode comes out. One of the hosts is getting married (or maybe already got married in that time) in case someone hasn't been listening to recent episodes.\n\nA beautiful chip shot from the bunker and a chance for a birdie. A marvelous shot really. We've seen others struggle with the same area on this hole.\n\nEpisode 478: Golf Games\n\nYeah plenty of games to choose from for this episode. It is pretty amusing how a sport that seems like it would be the most boring as a videogame actually is pretty fun. Heck even the Golden Tee games with the roller trackball controllers in the arcade. But usually it's more interesting when golf games put some goofy spin on the game.\n\nEpisode page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2021/8/8/episode-478-golf-games\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nFamicom Golf: US Course - Akito Nakatsuka - Title\n\nFantasy Golf PangYa Portable - nev - A Walk to the Fairyland\n\nPebble Beach Golf Links - Yumi Kinoshita, Shigekazu Kamaki - Menu\n\nNeo Turf Masters - Takushi \"HIYA!\" Hiyamuta - Baden National Golf Course\n\nHole in One Golf - Iku Mizutani - BGM 3\n\nMario Golf - Motoi Sakuraba - Best Shot Replay\n\nArnold Palmer Tournament Golf - Tokuhiko Uwabo - BGM 4 (Karl's Remix)\n\nHu PGA Tour: Power Golf 2 - Unknown - BGM\n\nBandai Golf: Challenge Pebble Beach - Akihito Hayashi - Title Screen\n\nHAL's Hole in One Golf - Hirokazu Ando - Take a Rest\n\nSuper Swing Golf - Yutaka Fujishima - Ending\n\nPebble Beach Golf Links - Yumi Kinoshita, Shigekazu Kamaki - Hole Overview\n\nVirtua Golf - Masanori Takeuchi - BGM 12\n\nJack Nicklaus Turbo Golf - Advance Communication Company - BGM 4\n\nNES Open Tournament Golf - Akito Nakatsuka - US Course\n\nTrue Golf Classics: Waialae Country Club - Yumi Kinoshita - Opening\n\nPebble Beach Golf Links - Yumi Satake - Shuryo\n\nGolf Daisuki!

May it be a light to you in dark places when all other lights go out.\n\nEpisode 479: Ori and the Blind Forest\n\nGot little to add as I never played the game and only heard maybe a track or two from it before listening to this episode. That's ok though. The Bros. basically didn't play it either (one of them played some of it.), but decided the OST was worth spotlighting.\n\nEpisode page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2021/8/15/episode-479-ori-and-the-blind-forest\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nOri and the Blind Forest - Gareth Coker - Microsoft - Xbox One/PC - 2015\n\n-Calling Out\n\n-Ori, Lost in the Storm\n\n-Naru, Embracing the Light\n\n-The Blinded Forest\n\n-Inspiriting\n\n-First Steps Into Sunken Glades\n\n-The Spirit Tree\n\n-Kuro's Tale I - Her Rage\n\n-Down the Moon Grotto\n\n-The Ancestral Trees\n\n-Gumo's Hideout\n\n-Breaking Through the Trap\n\n-Restoring Light, Facing the Dark\n\n-Escaping the Ruins\n\n-Riding the Wind\n\n-Approaching the End\n\n-The Crumbling Path\n\n-Fleeing Kuro\n\n-The Sacrifice\n\nForgot about the previous episode.\n\nEpisode 480: Hero of Legend: A Season of Shadow\n\nThe 3 Brueggemann brothers (including our two main hosts of course) have put out an album of original music.

I myself not being a sim car fan couldn't tell you much about where the tracks are featured. The Bros. assume that a lot of might be menu music or stuff not while the race is going on. I can see why that would make sense.\n\nEpisode Page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2021/8/29/episode-481-gran-turismo-grooves\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nGran Turismo 5 - Ryo Sonoda, Taroma Koshida - Sony - PS3 - 2010\n\n-Smoker's Lament\n\n-Holiday\n\n-Night Birds\n\n-Sunday\n\n-Dark Line\n\nGran Turismo 4 - Masahiro Andoh, Isamu Ohira - Sony - PS2 - 2004\n\n-Get Closer\n\n-Green Monster\n\nGran Turismo 6 - Satoshi Bando, Akimasa Yamada - Sony - PS3 - 2013\n\n-Gurney's Eagle\n\n-Red\n\n-Time to Rest\n\n-The Power of GT\n\n-Lotus in Dam\n\n-Slow Life with Sunshine\n\n-Slow on the Uptake\n\n-Dream World\n\n-Mr. Svensson's Coffeebreak in Heaven\n\n-Mesmerium\n\n-Arcade Mode\n\n-Express Way\n\nStrange horns and animals\n\nEpisode 484: Team Ico Trilogy\n\nVery nice spotlight. They kinda zip right past Ico which kinda surprised me. In a way you probably could takckle these games in a \"less tracks, but more describing\" kind of format in an individual episode. That would have been cool too. But yeah, not much Ico here. Since the Bros. haven't played any of these games, they also get some help from a few friends. I find that a welcome addition. Not only for the sake of giving some context (even if that doesn't really bother me in other episodes where they do spotlights on games they haven't played), but also just different enthusiastic voices and takes to add some more flavor to our usual 2 piece palette.\n\nEpisode page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2021/9/19/episode-484-team-ico-trilogy\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nIco - Michiru Oshima - Sony - PS2 - 2001\n\n-Heal\n\n-Castle in the Mist\n\nShadow of the Colossus - Koh Otani - Sony - PS2 - 2005\n\n-Prologue ~To the Ancient Land~\n\n-The Opened Way\n\n-The End of the Battle\n\n-Revived Power\n\n-Silence\n\n-The Farthest Land\n\n-Counterattack\n\n-Gate Watcher of the Ancient Ruins\n\n-Demise of the Ritual\n\n-The Sunlit Earth\n\nThe Last Guardian - Takeshi Furukawa - Sony - PS4 - 2016\n\n-Overture: Lore\n\n-Falling Bridge\n\n-Victorious\n\n-End Titles: The Last Guardian Suite\n\nEpisode 485: Deltarune\n\nThe second chapter of this game came out recently. I don't actually know anything about the game itself. Mainly cause I'm one of those \"cool, let me know when all the chapters are out so I can play it all at once\" people. Though I don't even know how long these chapters last. What I do know is that I enjoy Toby's music. So I'm looking forward to hearing these tracks, as I've only heard some in the past and no longer recall what they sound like.\n\nEpisode page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2021/9/26/episode-485-deltarune\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nDeltarune - Toby Fox - PC/PS4/Switch - 2018\n\n-The Legend\n\n-Lancer\n\n-Rude Buster\n\n-Empty Town\n\n-Field of Hopes and Dreams\n\n-Lantern\n\n-Scarlet Forest\n\n-Darkness Falls\n\n-Friendship\n\n-My Castle Town\n\n-A CYBER'S WORLD\n\n-Smart Race\n\n-WELCOME TO THE CITY\n\n-Pandora Palace\n\n-BIG SHOT\n\n-It's Pronounced 'Rules'\n\n-Attack of the Killer Queen\n\n-Acid Tunnel of Love\n\nLet's get together and feel alright\n\nEpisode 487: Listener Show & Tell 11\n\nAs usual I miss the memo on any upcoming show and tell episode. Maybe it's announced on Twitter or in the Discord, but I don't ever venture to see so, I guess that's on me haha. But I'm always down for these episodes. I look at the tracklist and it's all over the place which is awesome. At least half looks like stuff I haven't listened to and a few I wasn't even aware of existing.

Why not kick it of with a big hitter from last year? A nice easy going ost that some of us may have heard too much of haha. Actually, not me personally. My copy of the game is still sealed so uh... I guess I'll be hearing most o these tunes for the first time.\n\nEpisode page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2021/10/31/episode-490-animal-crossing-new-horizons\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons - Yasuaki Iwata, Yumi Takahashi, Shinobu Nagata, Sayako Doi, Masato Ohashi - Nintendo - Switch - 2020\n\n-Prologue 6 (~Sunny Weather~)\n\n-Main Theme - Welcome Horizons\n\n-1:00 a.m. (~Sunny Weather~)\n\n-10:00 a.m. (~Sunny Weather~)\n\n-Resident Services (~Upgraded~)\n\n-Noon (~Sunny Weather~)\n\n-4:00 p.m. (~Sunny Weather~)\n\n-Welcome to a Tour Island!

No Super Smash Bros. character or something more significant. I know the last game on the DS (or was it 3DS) wasn't a defining RPG for its respective system. That's the way it goes sometimes. I have fond memories of the first entry though and the music played a big part in that. Even at the time when I didn't know about the limits of the GBA sound chip compared to say the SNES sound chip. It simply sounded good to me from a 16-bit sound standpoint (It's a bit confusing to me. The GBA could output 16-bit but all the samples were 8-bit? Anyways, you know what I mean. Could do more than the regular Game Boy).\n\nEpisode page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2021/11/14/episode-492-golden-sun\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nGolden Sun - Motoi Sakuraba - Nintendo - GBA - 2001\n\n-Lighting the Mars Beacon\n\n-Main Theme\n\n-Main Menu\n\n-Suspense\n\n-Trial Road\n\n-Fanfare\n\n-Villain Theme\n\n-Enemy Battle\n\n-Vale and Vault\n\n-Sad Town\n\n-Contigo\n\n-Sol Sanctum\n\n-World Map\n\n-Tolbi Bound Ship\n\n-Babi's Lighthouse\n\n-Venus Lighthouse\n\n-Battle with Saturos\n\n-Saturos and Menardi Battle\n\n-Boss Battle\n\nSome Thanksgiving leftovers for you to take home\n\nEpisode 493: Super Mario Forgotten Mushrooms\n\nOver so many episodes and years of Nintendo months, you'd think most Mario platformer games have had their tunes featured. Well of course there were bound to be some stragglers. This episode tries to remedy that by playing tracks that never made it it to any show. I can see why too. Some pieces were just too brief and others, perhaps weren't quite as memorable or key as other tracks from their respective games.

Very bitter that it was removed from US Spotify sometime back in the fall or so. What gives? Put it back up there. https://youtu.be/hXyNp5HL-nE\n\nEpisode 494: Show & Tell 31\n\nNo theme.

Just turn on the radio.\n\nEpisode 495: Marcato Radio 28\n\nEverybody busy. No talk, just music. Notice that there is a DQ10 track here. Sugiyama passed away not too long ago. Think maybe back in September. A fairly infuriating person who did have a musical gift. Some of the stuff he did for the Dragon Quest games was all world. Nice to see some Gravity Rush 2 making this week's tracklist. Heck it was even chosen as the track of the week. 5 episodes away from 500. Dang fellas. I know the Bros. have stated that they got something special planned for it. Maybe even a big change to the podcast itself? Well, we got some regular style episodes coming out still till then.\n\nEpisode page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2021/12/5/episode-495-marcato-radio-28\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nde Blob - John Guscott - Decor\n\nAuto Modellista - Tetsuya Shibata - In the Light\n\nFront Mission: Gun Hazard - Nobuo Uematsu - Richard Millman\n\nGravity Rush 2 - Kohei Tanaka - Raven's Theme\n\nBOTB - Summer Chip XI - tree - Ultima\n\nFire Emblem: Path of Radiance - Yoshito Tomuro - Power Hungry Fool\n\nBomberman 64: The Second Attack - Yasunori Mitsuda - Lilith\n\nAnimal Crossing: Happy Home Designer - Kazumi Totaka - Staff Roll\n\nWorld of Final Fantasy - Masashi Hamauzu - World of Battle\n\nThe Little Mermaid - Yasuaki Fujita - Stage 4: Undersea Volcano\n\nSF IV - Hideyuki Fukasawa - Snowy Rail Yard Stage\n\nTokimeki Memorial 3 Moegi's Piano Collection - Shoichiro Hirata - Rallentando\n\nSonic Neo Genesis - Karl Brueggemann - City Lights Zone (Act 2)\n\nDragon Quest X - Koichi Sugiyama - World of Sky\n\nBOTB - Summer Chip XI - ko0x - A Night on Callisto\n\nFate of Atlantis - Clint Bajakian - Kerner Steals the Statue\n\nPrincess Connect Re:Dive - Cygames - Anti-Beast Trinity Battle\n\nDeltarune Chapter 2 - Toby Fox - Elegant Entrance\n\nMario Kart Live: Home Circuit - Ryo Nagamatsu - Creating/Building\n\nListen to some \"real\" music you nerrrrrrds!\n\nEpisode 498: I Can't Believe It's Not VGM\n\nLast episode of the year. The tracks that are from the late 70s to the mid 80s are ones that seem more obvious. You can see how a lot of this type of stuff would be influential to VGM composers in the 80s and 90s. It's the stuff that is earlier or later that sort of caught my eye. Mainly because, yeah VGM music is so normal now that it's kinda weird to hear something not meant to be VGM in the last 10 years, but it sounds like it could be VGM. And that track from the 60s is also one of those cool outliers.\n\nEpisode page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2021/12/26/episode-498-i-cant-believe-its-not-vgm\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nBill Wolfer - Wolf - 1982 - Nodoby Knows\n\nJimmy McGriff - Tailgunner - 1977 - Skyhawk\n\nThe Rippingtons - Tourist in Paradise - 1989 - Earthbound\n\nBrian Bennett & Alan Hawkshaw - Synthesis - 1974 - Alto Glide\n\nLim Ha Young - Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha - 2021 - Start\n\nGoblin - Phenomena - 1985 - Jennifer\n\nYasushi Akutagawa - The Village of the Eight Gravestones - 1977 - The Village of the Eight Gravestones Suite\n\nKansas - Point of No Return - 1977 - Paradox\n\nDave Valentin - Land of the Third Eye - 1980 - Land of the Third Eye\n\nCuco - Piel Canela - 2019 - Piel Canela\n\nYuji Ohno - Lupin III: The First - 2019 - Samba Temperado 2019\n\nJean-Jacques Perrey - The Amazing New Electronic Pop Sound Of Jean Jacques Perrey - 1968 - In The Heart Of A Rose\n\nGeoffrey Bastow - Flash Graphics: Entertainment 5 - 1987 - Sight & Sound\n\nOrchestra 88 - Manhattan Skyline - 1978 - Manhattan Skyline\n\nKenichiro Suehiro - Re:Zero - 2016 - Elegy for Rem\n\nManzel - 1976 - Space Funk\n\nAlain Musichini - 1984 - Thalassa\n\nDream Theater - Octavarium - 2005 - Panic Attack\n\nMild High Club - Skiptracing - 2016 - Skiptracing\n\nEDIT - Oops. Something went wrong with the post. Was missing the episode details. Now updated.\n\nFive Oh Oh\n\nEpisode 500: A Super Marcato Bros. Celebration\n\nHah. Look at that picture. It's like seeing an athlete in their rookie year and then you got where they are now in their prime. Congrats to the Bros. for getting to episode 500. 500 hundred episodes without missing a week. That's pretty wild for just two people doing this on their own. Plenty of people chime in to give their thanks and even some questions. From longtime listeners who have even been on the show to some we haven't heard from in person before (like say a few Discord people). Just good vibes all around. But there is some music too. The Bros. mention that they will be changing the style of episodes going forward. They won't even be numbering them. I maybe missed it if they mentioned it, but I don't think there was any specific kind of format that they are planning to switch to. Merely that it won't be the classic format we have been accustomed to for, well forever haha.\n\nOnce again, big props to reaching 500 episodes. And I know the 10 year anniversary is also coming up very soon. It's been impressive how the show has stayed alive, informative, enthusiastic, and fun. I can't say how many podcasts that start out with the hosts being really into the podcast and then as time goes by they either aren't as into it anymore (understandable) or even sometimes seemingly resentful lol. The Bros. keep the good vibes (even if sometimes critical, though I'd say that's pretty rare) regardless of what they cover. Thanks fellas. Looking forward to what you have in store for us.\n\nEpisode page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2022/1/8/episode-500-a-super-marcato-bros-celebration\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nMusic heard in this episode:\n\nU.N.

The Bros.do look at some music here though and also give a rundown of some tracks they felt were the best from 2021 episodes.\n\nPerhaps the most important info from this episode is that the podcast is going to release every other week. So this episode was actually from last week. No new one this Sunday, but instead next Sunday.\n\nEpisode page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2022/2/13/prelude-to-a-new-era\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nZero-G - Super Marcato Bros. - Serene\n\nMina the Hollower - Jake Kaufman - Crypt Interior\n\nRivals of Aether (Expansion) - flashygoodness - Embers of a Burning Dystopia\n\nEastward - Joel Corelitz - Heretic Frypan\n\nNyanroo - Super Marcato Bros. - Stage 2-2: Deep Waters\n\n—— SMBVGMP Greatest Hits 2021: ——\n\nFF XII - The Dalmasca Estersand\n\nPokemon Trading Card Game 2 - Ronald's Theme\n\nDave Valentin - Astro March\n\nPrincess Connect - Nagisa no Tyrant, Samekichi\n\nTrue Golf Classics: Waialae Country Club - Opening\n\nYamaYama - Vampire Killer\n\nGravity Rush 2 - Raven's Theme\n\nHeart Heat Girls - Counterattack\n\nMario Kart: Home Circuit - Title Theme\n\nChrono Trigger (PS1) - Scattering Blossoms\n\nOri and the Blind Forest - Restoring Light, Facing the Dark\n\nProtodome - Toejammin'\n\nShiobi 3 - Idaten\n\nYs V - Niena\n\nMrMinisterMaster - Super Santa Kicker\n\nArcana - Second Armageddon\n\nRay's the Dead - Party at the Graveyard\n\nJean-Jacques Perrey - In the Heart of a Rose\n\nFantasian - Great Battle\n\nSo you put the cartridge on top of the other cartridge?\n\nSeries Spotlight: Sonic the Hedgehog\n\nThe new style of the podcast is a go. There are some guests on the episodes. The discussions are different than the typical \"listen to part of track and talk about it\" style that was tradition for most of the old episodes. You still get that too, but then other parts are for example discussing a certain phase of Sonic music during a period of time and how it fit in during that time period with contemporary music. Give it a shot. I think the change up is fine and it's neat to hear from other people too. That happened in the past on the odd episode and I liked having some other voice even if the two main Bros. are great at hosting the podcast.\n\nEpisode page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2022/2/27/series-spotlight-sonic-the-hedgehog\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nSonic Generations - Masato Nakamura - Green Hill Zone Act 1\n\nSonic 3 - Tomonori Sawada & Yoshiaki Kashima - Angel Island Zone Act 1\n\nSonic 2 - Masato Nakamura - Chemical Plant Zone\n\nSonic CD - Masafumi Ogata & Spencer Nilsen - You Can Do Anything & Sonic Boom\n\nSonic Adventure - Masaru Setsumaru, Jun Senoue - Welcome to Station Square\n\nSonic Colors - Kenichi Tokoi - Planet Wisp Act 1\n\nSonic Mania - Tee Lopes - Lights, Camera, Action! (Studiopolis Zone Act 1)\n\nSonic Mania - SEGA Sound Team arr. Tee Lopes - Flying Battery Zone Act 1\n\nI haven't quite acclimated to the podcast diverting from the old format. These last two episodes I feel like I have to listen more intently. I usually play this podcast while falling asleep which the old format seemed to work well with haha. It was just, \"here's a nice tune and now we add our two cents on it.\" Now the discussion part and breakdowns and other such things demand a bit more attention. So yeah I'll have to give these two episodes a relisten.\n\nDiscord Discotheque: 90s\n\nEpisode page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2022/3/13/discord-discotheque-90s\n\nTracklist:\n\nStreets of Rage 2 - Yuzo Koshiro - Go Straight\n\nTMNT Turtles in Time - Kazuhiko Uehara, Harumi Ueko - Sewer Surfin'\n\nSuper Adventure Island - Yuzo Koshiro - Ice Groove\n\nStreet Slam - Masaaki Iwasaki, Tatsuya Kiuchi - Just 3 On 3 (Park Court)\n\nSega Rally Championship - Takenobu Mitsuyoshi - Forest Replay\n\nRidge Racer Type 4 - Kohta Takahashi, Hiroshi Okubo, Asuka Sakai - Pearl Blue Soul\n\nMega Man X - Alph Lyla - Boomer Kuwanger\n\nGinga Fukei Densetsu Sapphire - T's Music - Stage 2\n\nDragon Slayer: Eiyuu Densetsu II - Falcom Sound Team JDK - Underground Cave\n\nIntermission: Bedroth's TurboGrafx Segment\n\n-China Warrior - Unknown - In-Game Music\n\n-Valis II - Tenpei Sato, Shinobu Ogawa, & Masahiro Kajihara - Title Theme\n\n-Gate of Thunder - Nick Wood - Crown Core (Stage 7)\n\n-Ginga Fukei Densetsu Sapphire - T's Music - Boss Theme\n\n-Kishin Dōji Zenki FX: Vajra Fight - Aya Tanaka and Minoru Endo - Track 4\n\nLords of Thunder - Satoshi Miyashita - Shop Music\n\nTony Hawk's Pro Skater - Goldfinger - Superman\n\nWave Race 64 - Kazumi Totaka - Main Title\n\nSuper Metroid - Kenji Yamamoto - Upper Brinstar\n\nZero Divide 2 - Akihito Okawa - Fascination\n\nTobal No. 1 - Yasunori Mitsuda - Electrical Indian\n\nViolent Storm - Kenichiro Fukui - The Final Technique\n\nGradius III - Kazuki Muraoka, Kazuhiko Uehara, Harumi Ueko - Cosmo Plant\n\n--------------------------\n\nDeep Dive: Cold Man\n\nEpisode page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2022/3/27/deep-dive-cold-man\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nRockman & Forte - Akari Kaida - Capcom - Super Famicom - 1998 - Cold Man\n\nDouble dipping\n\nMarcato Radio: Community Showcase\n\nThis episode featured tracks from videogames, but then also tunes from the Marcato community (starting with ModalModul's track)\n\nEpisode page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2022/5/22/marcato-radio-community-showcase-edition\n\nTracklist:\n\nThe Ninja Warriors Once Again - Hiroyuki Iwatsuki - Jubei (Stage 5 Boss)\n\nOMORI - Pedro Silva - Gator Gambol\n\nIntelligent Qube - Takayuki Hattori - Ecliptic\n\nPushmo World - Shoh Murakami - Exciting World\n\nBahamut Lagoon - Noriko Matsueda - Friendship\n\nPokemon Legends: Arceus - Hitomi Sato - Crimson Mirelands 1\n\nThe Messenger - Rainbowdragoneyes - Quillshroom's Horrors\n\nTriangle Strategy - Akira Senju - Merriment\n\nTower of Heaven - flashygoodness - Luna Ascension\n\nDragon Quest II - Koichi Sugiyama - My Road My Journey\n\nAirport CEO - Anton Dromberg - JFK Cadence\n\nand the community from here on out\n\nModalModule - Hurry!

This time I'm posting so early I haven't even listened to a single second of it, but love me some oldschool Castlevania, and the tracklist does look promising. Looking forward to the breakdowns of the tracks. Did our Bros. cover the trilogy way way back in the old days? Like before even episode 50? Well maybe I should listen to find out, but yeah certainly these tracks or these games have gotten their dues before.\n\nEpisode page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2022/6/5/revisited-the-castlevania-nes-trilogy\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nCastlevania - Kinuyo Yamashita, Satoe Terashima - 1986\n\n-Stalker (Armory)\n\n-Vampire Killer (Courtyard)\n\n-Wicked Child (Upper Yard)\n\n-Walking Edge (Castle Swamp)\n\n-Out of Time (Upper Terrace)\n\n-Nightmare (Dracula's Quarters)\n\nCastlevania II: Simon's Quest - Kenichi Matsubara, Satoe Terashima, Kouji Murata - 1987\n\n-The Silence of The Daylight\n\n-Bloody Tears\n\n-Monster Dance\n\n-Dwelling of Doom\n\n-Within These Castle Walls\n\n-A Requiem\n\nCastlevania III: Dracula's Curse - Hidenori Maezawa, Jun Funahashi, Yukie Morimoto, Yoshinori Sasaki - 1989\n\n-Prelude (Intro)\n\n-Beginning (Block-1)\n\n-Clockwork (Block-2)\n\n-Mad Forest (Block-3)\n\n-Dead Beat (Block-4)\n\n-Aquarius (Block-6)\n\n-Riddle (Block-9)\n\nBro talk\n\nCatching Up: Summer Fun\n\nWait what? There was music this week. I guess that slipped my ear cause that's a pretty long tracklist. This episode is just the two Bros. talking about their lives. Like peeking in on a Skype call. So no music breakdowns or anything like that this time around. But you might want to check the tracks that are in the tracklist cause I see lots of games there with good OSTs from my memory.\n\nEpisode page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2022/6/19/catching-up-summer-fun\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklsit:\n\nEtrian Odyssey Nexus - Yuzo Koshiro - BGM Town Day\n\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe - Yasuaki Iwata, Atsuko Asahi - Tour Paris Promenade\n\nTokimeki Memorial 3: Moegino Piano - Shoichiro Hirata - Waiting at the Cafe\n\nHarvest Moon: Magical Melody - Kenichi Hirata - Fall Theme\n\nscythe - BotB Summer Chip XI - Aobadoori\n\nMrMinisterMaster - BotB Summer Chip XI - DMT on the Beach\n\nThe Secret of Monkey Island - Michael Land - The Scumm Bar\n\nMonkey Island 2 - Michael Land - Woodtick\n\nThe Curse of Monkey Island - Blood Island Map\n\nEscape from Monkey Island - Peter McConnell - Lucre Town\n\nTengai Makyou Zero - Toshiyuki Sasagawa - Let's Go to Takamagahara\n\nde Blob 2 - John Guscott - Boogaloo in Blue\n\nTengai Makyou Zero - Toshiyuki Sasagawa - A Crab!\n\nSuper Mario Odyssey - Shiho Fujii - Lake Lamode Underwater Passage\n\nYoshi's Wooly World - Tomoya Tomita - Unused Stage Theme 6\n\nNardInYourYard - BotB Spring Tracks XI - Spring's Here, Summer's Not Far\n\nMario Kart 8 Deluxe - Yasuaki Iwata, Atsuko Asahi - Tour Tokyo Blur\n\nDrum fill for two episodes\n\nDrums Part 1!\n\nContinuing the more recent trend, the Bros. take a look at some tracks, but also freshen things up by bringing another guest to have a bit.

Just wait until they get to the guy who was the composer for Sonic Chronicles. Oddly enough another game with \"Chronicles\" in it lol.\n\nWasn't expecting to see Theo Fleury as an artist popping up here. Not because the song is good. It's just standard generic country pop. It's just that, hey I didn't realize he was making music. Theo was mostly known as a great hockey player who played in the NHL for many years and even represented Canada in the Olympics. His life story is really interesting. Severely dark at times. The man has gone through some ugliness in his life. Wikipedia him to get a general understanding. On one hand I'm always rooting for him in that sense, but there's been moments where I'm like \"eh I don't really agree much with this guy on some other matters.\" But yeah, heck of a lot better as a hockey player back in the day than as a musician.\n\nEpisode Page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2022/7/31/marcato-classic-bad-music-7\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nCaptain Planet and the Planeteers - Peter Stone - Track 3\n\nJames Bond Jr. - Peter Stone - Stage 1\n\nPhantasy Star II - Tokuhiko Uwabo - Bracky News\n\nDrakengard - Nobuyoshi Sano - Chapter 4 ~ On the Ground\n\nPeter Pan: The Motion Picture Event - Rick Bradshaw - BGM 01\n\nWild Woody - Ron Thal - Treasure Caves\n\nThe Wizard of Oz - Robert Ridihalgh - Scarlet Waters\n\nRollerblade Racer - Bill Bogenreif - Title Theme\n\nAir Diver - Y.W. - South America\n\nEVO: Search For Eden - Koichi Sugiyama - Scaling Mt.

This episode pretty much promotes compositions from other students who completed the program with him. So chances are you likely haven't ever heard these tracks and hey maybe you'll find someone here might become a big name in several years. That'd be kinda cool to have originally discovered them on here.\n\nEpisode Page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2022/8/29/community-spotlight-columbia-class-of-22\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nFairy's Ball – Jiawei Zhao - www.jiaweimusician.com/\n\nTaking Flight – Kyle Waselewski - www.kylewaselewski.com/\n\nA Girl With A Tail – Hun Ouk Park - www.hunoukpark.com/\n\nThe Town Underground – Zhaohong Zhu - www.soundcloud.com/lw32nesertxt\n\nTheme and Variations – Alexander Rybak - www.alexanderrybak.com/\n\nBeckoning To The Great Beyond – William Brueggemann – www.williambmusic.com\n\nThe Moon Serpent – Dylan Harper - www.dylanvharper.com/\n\nEdges – Macy Camille - www.macycamillemusic.com/\n\nTheme For Lovers – Hun Ouk Park\n\nThe King's Theme – Macy Camille\n\nPipes and Cables – Casey Austin - www.caseyaustinmusic.com/\n\nThe Weight of You – Beryl Rosenblum & Macy Camille\n\nO Tanenbaum (Arranged) – Alexander Rybak\n\nGirl With A Tail – Theme and Variations – Hun Ouk Park\n\nInto The Great Unknown – David Neville - www.davidnevillemusic.com/\n\nThousand Flower Chau – Markus Siegel\n\nSeeking Adventure – Markus Siegel - http://markussiegel.co.uk/\n\nAir in C – Beryl Rosenblum - www.berylrosenblum.com/\n\nAt The Cool Store – Dylan Harper\n\nFade Into The Forrest – Yefan Zhang - www.yefanzhangmusic.com\n\n-----------------------------\n\nBleep bloop kshhhhh\n\nBeloved Composers: flashygoodness\n\nAwww yeah! Let's go. Haven't been this pumped for an episode in a while. Tower of Heaven ost still sounds so good. Now that game was a flash game if I remember. It's probably been preserved in some way if that was the case. Can't imagine that that game would slip through the cracks and disappear. I'm excited to hear flashy's other tunes though, which I never looked into.\n\nEpisode page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2022/9/11/beloved-composers-flashygoodness\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nTower of Heaven - flashygoodness - Luna Ascension\n\nTower of Heaven - flashygoodness - Indignant Divinity\n\nTower of Heaven - flashygoodness - Atop the World\n\nOverPowered - flashygoodness - Broken Elevator to Revelation\n\nBean Dreams - flashygoodness - Fortune Fields\n\nBean Dreams - flashygoodness - Mystic Gardens\n\nBean Dreams - flashygoodness - Bath House\n\nBean Dreams - flashygoodness - Marble Mountain\n\nBean Dreams - flashygoodness - Dungeon of Dreams\n\nRivals of Aether - flashygoodness - Main Menu\n\nRivals of Aether - flashygoodness - Lightning Pandemonium\n\nRivals of Aether - flashygoodness - Customization\n\nRivals of Aether - flashygoodness - Fire's Last Hope\n\nRivals of Aether - flashygoodness - Neon Universe EX\n\nRivals of Aether - flashygoodness - Worldbuilders\n\nRivals of Aether - flashygoodness - Embers of a Burning Dystopia\n\nRivals of Aether - flashygoodness - Forest of Nightfall\n\nOh yeah. The master has returned.\n\nMarcato Classic: Shovel Knight Dig\n\nAlways excited to see new music from Jake Kaufman. Shovel Knight is sort of the soundtrack that brought attention to Jake Kaufman on a larger scale. Though some may have already picked up on him from the Mighty Switch Force games or Double Dragon Neon, or perhaps his work on the Shantae series which goes back to the early 00s. But yeah seeing a new Shovel Knight game with a Kaufman score is like peanut butter and jelly on a sandwich. A tried and true combo.\n\nEpisode page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2022/9/26/marcato-classic-shovel-knight-dig\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nShovel Knight Dig - Jake Kaufman - Yacht Club Games - 2022\n\n-Trailer (Date Reveal)\n\n-Overground (Main Layer)\n\n-Spore Judgment (Mushroom Mines)\n\n-Thermal Vent (Lost Atlantis)\n\n-An Ambush!\n\n-Fully Furnaced (Smelt Works)\n\n-Boss - The Forger\n\n-Overground (Campfire Layer)\n\n-One Person's Trash (Magic Landfill)\n\n-Boss - The Packrat\n\n-Pest Friends (Insect Hive)\n\n-Overground (Hoofman's Shop Layer)\n\n-Beware the Depths\n\n-Who Needs Honor (Drill Knight's Castle)\n\n-Boss - The Claim Jumper\n\n-Hegemony (Crystal Core)\n\n-Rapid Ascent\n\n-End Credits\n\n------------------\n\nThoughts and trivia and odds and ends\n\nQ&A: Dream Composers, Horse-Sized Ducks, and Funyons\n\nHave not listened to this episode yet. Looks like it's mostly a chit chat kind of episode between the Bros. They also play a little VGM trivia.

I'm used to being fashionably late with updates, but unexpectedly the Bros. released a new episode today so here are the last 3 episodes.\n\nGuest Host Takeover: Ranger X\n\nAnother pair of bros. takes over in this episode.

Finally up to date with today's release. Outside of maybe the main theme I don't really have much of a strong memory of music from this series. Luigi's Mansion 3 I cleared last year with a friend. Perhaps as soon as I hear tracks from that game it will conjure up memories.\n\nEpisode page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2022/11/13/nintendo-month-22-luigis-mansion-trilogy\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nLuigi's Mansion - Kazumi Totaka & Shinobu Tanaka - Nintendo - Gamecube - 2001\n\n-Staff Credits\n\n-E.

The main thing that surprised me was that Yoko Shimomura worked on the sequel. Maybe I'll check out the music on Spotify. Shockingly it's there. Shocking because Nintendo usually doesn't understand what it means to be in the 21st century company when comes to modern conveniences. But I do see at the bottom of the Spotify page it's a copyright by Ubisoft Music, so I guess that sort of makes more sense.\n\nEpisode page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2022/11/20/nintendo-month-22-mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nMario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle - Grant Kirkhope - Ubisoft - Switch - 2017\n\n-The Adventure Begins\n\n-Hoppers!\n\n-Mid Boss Mayhem\n\n-The Lava Forge\n\nMario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope - Yoko Shimomura, Grant Kirkhope, Gareth Coker - Ubisoft - Switch - 2022\n\n-Sunny Side of the Galaxy\n\n-Prologue - On the Back of the Darkmess Manta\n\n-Dark Secrets on a Sunlit Planet\n\n-Icy Battle Ballet\n\n-Paean to Palette Prime\n\n-Beacon in the Darkmess\n\n-Cold, Dark Mask of the Mountain, Pt.

Maybe my favorite since they went into their new format. Helps too that we are dealing with Koji Kondo tracks after all. I can see myself stumbling back to relisten to this one again.\n\nEpisode page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2022/11/27/nintendo-month-22-the-koji-kondo-sound\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nI'll post the link the Bros. made since it's a bit of a longer list than usual.\n\nTune in, drop out\n\nMarcato Radio 30\n\nNo talk, just tunes.\n\nEpisode page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2022/12/7/marcato-radio-30\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nBomberman 64 - Akifumi Tada - N64 - Green Garden\n\nRocket Knight Adventures - Masanori Oouchi - Genesis - Stage 3\n\nTumbleSeed - Joel Corelitz - PC - Home Seed Home\n\nMega Man 11 - Marika Suzuki - Switch - Game Menu\n\nAoki Okami to Shiroki Mejika: Gencho Hishi - Michiru Oshima - FM Towns - Prayer\n\ncoda - Battle of the Bits - Turtle Line\n\nClover Hearts Perfect Arrange Album - Manabu Miwa - Sunlight, Running Through\n\nStardew Valley - Eric Barone - PC - Dance of the Moonlight Jellies\n\nFantasy Life - Nobuo Uematsu - 3DS - Home\n\nChrono Trigger - Yasunori Mitsuda - SNES - At the Bottom of Night\n\nPokemon Mystery Dungeon EoS - Arata Iiyoshi - DS - Goodnight\n\nProfessor Layton & The Miracle Mask - Tomohito Nishiura - 3DS - Night in Stansbury\n\nPower Rangers: Time Force - Iku Mizutani - Game Boy - Track 13\n\nRagnarok Odyssey - Kumi Tanioka - Vita - Fort Farthest\n\nDragon Ball FighterZ - Toshiyuki Kishi - PS4 - Main Menu (Alternate Ver.)\n\nPrincess Connect ReDive - Yasunori Nishiki - Mobile - Longing for Distant Days\n\nMario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope - Gareth Coker - Switch - Spout Forth\n\nYs Piano Collection - Michio Fujisawa - Fountain of Love\n\n---------\n\nBrisk and chilly\n\nGuest Host Takeover: Ice & Snow is Back Again!\n\nHaven't gotten around to listen to this episode yet. But this follows the more recent trend of the Bros. having guests not just guesting, but actually hosting the show. This would have been the Xmas episode, so it's all winter related tracks as is evident from the episode name and tunes chosen.\n\nEpisode page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2022/12/24/guest-host-takeover-ice-amp-snow-is-back-again\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nSamurai Shodown 2019 - The Light of Snow\n\nRistar - Round 5-1 - Ring Rink ~Planet Freon\n\nTobe!

Props to the podcast's discord. Very good selection of tracks that vaguely are supposed to be kid friendly in some respect. Great to see Napple Tale show up. Yoshi's Wolly World? Yes please (as opposed to Crafty World :/ ). Piranha Plant Lullaby? Yep. The discord made great pics. And Heal from Ico is... I mean as far as save point tracks go, gotta be top 5. I just get cozy thinking about it. Man, get that game on Steam and PS5. Don't even remake it. Just port that PS3 version.\n\nEpisode Page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2023/1/22/discord-discotheque-kid-friendly\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nBaba is You - Arvi Teikari - Rocket Is Dust\n\nFinal Fantasy VI - Nobuo Uematsu - Relm\n\nM.C.

Games get canned for one reason or another. Sometimes though, the music survives.

I'm usually less hyped about episodes that are low on the quantity of music, but the talk between the Bros. was great all around. The middle segment by Arthur (someone from the Discord I guess?) is an appropriate companion piece for this episode. I'm sort of halfway there with Arthur.\n\nEpisode Page - http://www.supermarcatobros.com/podcast/2023/2/19/current-events-game-music-grammys\n\nApple Podcasts - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/super-marcato-bros-video-game-music-podcast/id507835405\n\nTracklist:\n\nAliens: Fireteam Elite - Austin Wintory\n\n-UAS Endeavor, Search\n\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn Of Ragnarok - Stephanie Economou\n\n-Cracking the Vault, Svartalfheim\n\nCall Of Duty: Vanguard - Bear McCreary\n\n-Vanguard, Bombing Run\n\nMarvel's Guardians Of The Galaxy - Richard Jacques\n\n-Entering the Zone, Your Bones Are Mine\n\nOld World - Christopher Tin\n\n-Festival of Dionysus (Greece), The Augur Speaks (Rome)"
