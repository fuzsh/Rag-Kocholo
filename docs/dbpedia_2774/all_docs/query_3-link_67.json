        "text": "''RESURRECTION,'' the new work being given its premiere on Friday by the Houston Grand Opera, centers on a 19th-century Russian nobleman and the peasant girl he seduced and abandoned. The Prince is a baritone, the peasant girl a mezzo-soprano. The staging includes a courtroom scene, a party in a magnificent Moscow palace, a death march in plodding C minor in a desolate Siberian prison camp. The libretto is woven from Tolstoy's final novel, a story echoing the classic Wagnerian theme of redemption through love, culminating in a stirring prison-scene climax. There is nothing odd about any of this. And that is precisely what is so odd about it.\n\nBecause the composer is Tod Machover, who, perhaps more than anyone else, is identified with new computer-music possibilities, science-fiction opera, artificial intelligence manifested in sound. He is known for his 1988 opera, ''Valis,'' arguably the most famous achievement in operatic science fiction, which traces the story of a Philip K. Dick novel with rock beats and hallucinogenic synthesizer riffs. He is known for his ''hyperinstruments,'' like the computerized cello on which Yo-Yo Ma performed, each movement of his arm triggering great washes of sound rising through stacks of loudspeakers.\n\nMr. Machover is also known for his interactive ''Brain Opera,'' which drew thousands of audience members to Lincoln Center in 1996 to speak into microphones, push pedals and buttons, and listen through headphones to a complex artificial-intelligence music system patterned after the work of the computer maven Marvin Minsky. In the end, the venture was widely perceived as a failure.\n\nAnd now, at 45, Mr. Machover is returning to his Russian-immigrant roots to write a 19th-century operatic love story with a bad-guy baritone and a good-guy tenor. What gives? Is the ''Resurrection'' he is looking for his own?\n\nNot to hear him tell it. Like many artists, he sees the unity underlying an output that seems crazily diverse from the outside. Sitting recently in his lovely home in Belmont, Mass., which was built and decorated mostly in wood by an M.I.T. professor who predated Mr. Machover's current tenure there, he explained ''Valis'' as a seminal work that branched off in two directions, one toward ''Brain Opera,'' the other toward ''Resurrection.'' ''Valis'' was an extraterrestrial acronym for Vast Active Living Intelligent System, and the intelligent-machine aspects of the work continued in ''Brain Opera.'' For Mr. Machover, ''Resurrection'' picks up the personal-development thread of ''Valis.''\n\n'' 'Valis,' was about certain individuals' spiritual or personal journeys, their psychological development,'' Mr. Machover mused. '' 'Valis' always stayed inside its main character's head. After that, I wanted to write something about how you decide what your relationship is to the outside world. You can't wait until some hypothetical point when you're ready to start making a difference to other people. What can you actually do? At what level do you help other people or society as a whole?''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
