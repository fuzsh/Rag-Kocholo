        "text": "Libby Van Cleve\n\nOral History of American Music Archive\n\nLibby Van Cleve is a scholar and performer with a specialty in contemporary American music. As Director of Yale’s Oral History of American Music Archive, she has conducted numerous interviews with major figures in American music. She is the author of the award-winning book and CD publication Composers’ Voices from Ives to Ellington, Yale University Press as well as various articles, program notes, and liner notes, which are often generated by material from her interviews. Complementing her work at OHAM, Ms. Van Cleve is recognized as one of the foremost interpreters of contemporary and chamber music for the oboe. She has recorded dozens of CDs and is author of Oboe Unbound: Contemporary Techniques, Rowman and Littlefield Publishers.\n\nWhen not playing the oboe or interviewing composers, Libby enjoys gardening, hiking, taking zumba classes, and the challenge of raising a teenage daughter. She is actively involved at Yale’s St. Thomas More Chapel as musician and parishioner.\n\nWeb page link\n\nEmail Libby Van Cleve\n\nDayal Veneeta\n\nLinguistics\n\nVeneeta Dayal is the Dorothy R. Diebold Professor of Linguistics at Yale University. She did her Masters and M.Phil in English Literature from Delhi University (India) and taught at Jamia Millia Islamia (India) from 1980-1983. She received her Ph.D. in Linguistics from Cornell University in 1991. She taught at Rutgers University from 1990-2018 where she held the rank of Distinguished Professor of Linguistics.\n\nVeneeta Dayal’s research focuses on the semantics of natural language, and its interface with syntax and pragmatics, typically from a cross-linguistic perspective. Her primary areas of language specialization are English and Hindi-Urdu. The topics she has worked on can be classified under four broad categories: Questions and relative clauses; Bare nominals and genericity; Free choice items, Clause structure and scope in Hindi-Urdu. She has published widely in leading journals in the field of linguistics: Linguistic Inquiry, Linguistics and Philosophy, Natural Language Semantics, and Natural Language and Linguistic Theory, among others. She is the author of Locality in Wh Quantification (Kluwer Academic Publishers) and Questions (Oxford University Press) and a co-editor of Clause Structure in South Asian Languages (Kluwer Academic Publishers). She is now working on a manuscript exploring cross-linguistic variation in the morpho-syntactic expression of definiteness, indefiniteness and genericity: (In)definiteness and Genericity: A Cross-linguistic Perspective, to be published by Wiley-Blackwell. A related project, The Open Handbook of (In)definiteness: A Hitchhiker’s Guide to Interpreting Bare Arguments is under contract with MIT Open Handbooks in Linguistics. Another manuscript, Scope-taking in Questions, is slated for publication in Linguistic Inquiry Monographs. Other current projects include the relationship between clausal subordination and speech acts, the expression of epistemic uncertainty in different types of noun phrases, and the syntax and semantics of question particles.\n\nAt Rutgers, Veneeta Dayal served as the founding director of the South Asian Studies Program, Graduate Program Director of Linguistics, Undergraduate Program Director of Linguistics, Department Chair of Linguistics and Acting Dean of Humanities. She is an associate editor for the journal Linguistics and Philosophy and is on the editorial board of a number of other journals.\n\nVeneeta Dayal has been the recipient of a National Science Foundation grant, a Fulbright Senior Research Award, a Senior Research Fellowship from the American Institute of Indian Studies and a Jawaharlal Nehru Institute for Advanced Study Fellowship. She was awarded the Graduate Faculty Teaching Award in 2017 by Rutgers Graduate School, New Brunswick.\n\nEmail Dayal Veneeta\n\nKalindi Vora\n\nEthnicity, Race & Migration;Women's Gender & Sexuality Studies\n\nKalindi Vora is Professor of Ethnicity, Race, and Migration, and Women’s Gender and Sexuality Studies at Yale University. Her first book, Life Support: Biocapital and the New History of Outsourced Labor (Rachel Carson Book Prize 2018), takes up questions of technology, colonialism and raced and gendered labor under globalization. Her second book is Surrogate Humanity: Race Robotics and the Politics of Technological Futures (Duke 2019), co-authored with Neda Atanasoski, a project on the racial and gendered politics of robotics and artificial intelligence. With the Precarity Lab, she is co-author of Technoprecarious (2020), which tracks the role of digital technologies in multiplying precarity. A book of her collected work on transnational gestational surrogacy in India is forthcoming under the title, Reimagining Reproduction: Surrogacy, Labour and Technologies of Human Reproduction.\n\nShe has also edited three anthology special issues, “Whiteness and Technoscience,” in Catalyst: Feminist, Technoscience, Theory Critical Perspectives (2018) and “Postsocialist Politics and the Ends of Revolution” (2018) in Social Identities with Neda Atanasoski; and with Fouzieyha Towghi, “Bodies, Markets and the Experimental in South Asia,” in Ethnos: Journal of Anthropology (2012)\n\nHer past research has included STS and ethnographic study of information and communications technology, assisted reproductive technology, and robotics and machine learning, about which she has published in journals such as: Ethnos: Journal of Anthropology, Current Anthropology, Social Identities, The South Atlantic Quarterly, Postmodern Culture, and Catalyst: Feminism, Theory, Technoscience. She currently sits on the editorial board of Catalyst: Feminism, Theory, Technoscience and The Anthropology of Work.\n\nProfessor Vora is currently involved in several research projects. She continues writing and publishing on artificial intelligence and automation through the lens of STS and critical race and gender theories. She is also beginning a book project, supported by a National Science Foundation Science and Technology Studies award (2022-2024) tentatively titled, Autoimmune: Chronic Conditions and Care in a Time of Uncertain Medicine. It places contemporary narratives of illness by patients facing racism and sexism in their daily lives within an analysis of the history of the concept of autoimmunity and contemporary practices of healthcare self-monitoring to understand the potential for patient-physician co-production of medical knowledge. “Asking Different Questions” is a pedagogical project funded by the National Science Foundation’s “Innovations in Graduate Education” award program (2018-2021). Through modules, workshops, and Ph.D. seminars, this curriculum trains advanced STEM researchers to incorporate social (justice) impacts into their research design and practice. She is also working on the collaboratively authored book, The Science We are For: A Feminist Pocket Guide (under review), with the Star Feminist Collaboratory (K. Vora, L. Irani, C. Hanssmann, S. Varma, S. Zarate, L. Quintanilla). Intended for researchers and readers invested in technoscience of all types, this how-to guide breaks down basic concepts in gender/sexuality studies, ethnic studies, and science and technology studies for pragmatic and applied uses in a variety of learning and research contexts.\n\nPrior to Yale, she was the Director of the Feminist Research Institute and Professor of Gender, Sexuality and Women’s Studies at The University of California Davis and Associate Professor of Ethnic Studies at UC San Diego. Her research has been supported by several National Science Foundation grants, Hellman fellowships, as well as University of California Humanities Research Institute fellowships. She was a University of California President’s Postdoctoral Fellow in the Anthropology Department at UC Berkeley, and has been a visiting fellow at the Digital Cultures Research Lab at Leuphana University in Luneburg, Germany and at GEXcel at Linköping University in Sweden.\n\nEmail Kalindi Vora"
