        "text": "the intro guitar tone is just perfect. what a great sound, simple but effective. the beat comes in at 0:15 and is pretty snappy, and i noticed here that the track isn't particularly balanced from section to section (would love to hear some more compression). the melodic material is well-played by the guitar, there's a wrong note in the chord at 0:46 in the middle of the background, putting a minor third next to a major from the sound of it.\n\nthe break at 1:21 or so with the ep is again an excellent instrumentation selection, fitting the style very well. 1:55 is a bit of stylistic change, and there's a few funky notes from the altered chords used there.\n\nafter this it kind of noodles through some melodic material and then it's done.\n\nthis is pretty simple overall, but the simplicity is a feature, not a bug. it's a nice approach to an underrepresented game.\n\nYES\n\nReal nice tone to the guitar and piano to start things off. The writing is chilled out and cohesive, nothing crazy going on on any fronts but it really works as a whole!\n\nThe beat is fine for what it is, but I think there could be a lot more movement to the percussion without sacrificing the chill vibe. The hi-hat/auxiliary percussion specifically feels very static in terms of sequencing, which inhibits the groove from really flowing. The percussion is also mixed with a lot of sharpness in the high end, specifically in the snare and hats. Typically, for a lo-fi approach, you'll want to high-shelf or lowpass filter your drums to shave off some of that high end piercing frequency, since it's poking out dramatically compared to the softness of the rest of the soundscape. Not a dealbreaker in my book, but this is definitely something to improve on your next outing in this style.\n\nPretty easy pass, in spite of its simplicity. I could really see you evolving this style with future submissions but I have no major reservations about what's in front of me. Nice work!\n\nYES"
