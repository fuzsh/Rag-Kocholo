        "meta_description": "Valis II is a 1989 action-platform video game originally developed by Laser Soft, published by Telenet Japan and NEC for the PC Engine CD-ROM²/TurboGrafx-CD. A home computer version was released for PC-8801, MSX2, PC-9801 and X68000. A super deformed-style remake was also released in 1992 for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. It is the second entry in the eponymous series. It stars Yuko Asou, a Japanese schoolgirl teenager chosen to become the Valis warrior by wielding the titular mystical sword, after defeating the demon lord Rogles. The dream world Vecanti fell under the rule of emperor Megas, whose hatred towards his brother Rogles and bloodthirsty tendencies seeks to wipe out traces of the former tyrant, including his supporters. Gameplay varies between each version but all share similar elements, as the player explores and search for items and power-ups, while fighting enemies and defeat bosses.",

Gameplay varies between each version but all share similar elements, as the player explores and search for items and power-ups, while fighting enemies and defeat bosses.\n\nWork on Valis II did not start for a period of two and a half years, as the team became understaffed when several members had left after Valis: The Fantasm Soldier. Telenet began shifting their focus in order to establish themselves in the LaserDisc market when the development moved toward. It was the first title created by Laser Soft, an internal gaming division of Telenet formed specifically to explore games for the CD-ROM format, and they also cooperated with Renovation Game (Reno), which handled the home computer version. The staff hired animators for the project, as people within the anime industry were becoming interested in the video game industry. Both the TurboGrafx-CD and computer versions were made simultaneously, but each under different development lines. The Genesis remake was slated for a European release by UbiSoft, as part of a multi-game licensing deal with Telenet's North American subsidiary Renovation Products, but it was never officially released in the region. Each version of the game have since been re-released through download services for other platforms and compilations."
