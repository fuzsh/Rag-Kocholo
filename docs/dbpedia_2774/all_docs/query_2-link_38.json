I would have expected to get the SHA1's of the disks to patch.\n\nAnyway, I have found & patched disk 2, 3 & 4. But still haven't found the correct Disk 1.\n\nAxelF wrote:\n\nMy first disk has a different SHA1 after patching, maybe copy protection or Savegame ?(Sha1:f876effc6eebec063bad3417ff0fc190d5746bb9)\n\nYep... That's the same one I get. Anyway, I'll put that version up now on the downloadsite for the people that don't know how to patch.\n\nYou can also play the translated version HERE.\n\nHi Guillian,\n\nThank you very much for your work and for share this patch to everybody. Can you confirm if if this patch is compatible-acumulative with the previous FRS drum kit & enhancement patch (https://www.msx.org/news/en/valis-ii-the-fantasm-soldier-dru...) ? If the answer to my previous question is yes, which must be the order to apply them?\n\nRegards,\n\nRaul\n\nP.S.: Same question in download section - sorry\n\nOh, fantastic! I'll put it on my CF card right away, after I get the answer on raulsantacruz his question, because the R800 support (and drum kit stuff) is very useful in the game.\n\nDJANGO wrote:\n\nthe patch on disk A works well on my version on this link\n\ndisque A Valis II\n\nIt seems to work on other versions as well but the end result does not give a sha1 as mentioned in the text file (I tried the version I had, and the 2 versions on tfh/planetemu as well as yours. All end up with a different sha1.\n\nI had not started playing and was indeed wondering if this was one of the games that saves on the game disk. If so then it is likely those saves are the reason.\n\nThank you very much Victor!!\n\nYou achieved to give us the MSX2 best Valis 2 possible experience!!!! Amazing performance in Z80 and R800!. We never believed such kind of optimization was possible with this game because VDP. But you demostrated us there was still a wide room for improvements!! The MSX scene won't can to thanks enough for your works in this mythical game\n\nRaul"
