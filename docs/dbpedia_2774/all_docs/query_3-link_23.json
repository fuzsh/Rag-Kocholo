        "text": "Re-imagining the opera of the future https://ift.tt/FYMmcQz In the mid-1980s, composer Tod Machover came across a copy of Philip K. Dick’s science fiction novel “VALIS” in a Parisian bookstore. Based on a mystical vision Dick called his “pink light experience,” “VALIS” was an acronym for “vast active living intelligence system.” The metaphysical novel would become the basis for Machover’s opera of the same name, which first premiered at the Pompidou Center in 1987, and was recently re-staged at MIT for a new generation. At the time, Machover was in his 20s and the director of musical research at the renowned French Institute IRCAM, a hotbed of the avant-garde known for its pioneering research in music technology. The Pompidou, Machover says, had given him carte blanche to create a new piece for its 10th anniversary. So, throughout the summer and fall, the composer had gone about constructing an elaborate theater inside the center’s cavernous entrance hall, installing speakers and hundreds of video monitors. Creating the first computer opera Machover, who is now Muriel R. Cooper Professor of Music and Media and director of the MIT Media Lab’s Opera of the Future research group, had originally wanted to use IRCAM founder Pierre Boulez’s Ensemble Intercontemporain, but was turned down when he asked to rehearse with them for a full two months. “Like a rock band,” he says. “I went back and thought, ‘Well, what’s the smallest number of players that can make and generate the richness and layered complexity of music that I was thinking about?’” He decided his orchestra would consist of only two musicians: a keyboardist and a percussionist. With tools like personal computers, MIDI, and the DX7 newly available, the possibilities of digital sound and intelligent interaction were beginning to expand. Soon, Machover took a position as a founding faculty member of MIT’s Media Lab, shuttling back and forth between Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Paris. “That’s when we invented hyperinstruments,” says Machover. The hyperinstruments, developed at the Media Lab in collaboration with Machover’s very first graduate student RA Joe Chung, allowed the musician to control a much fuller range of sound. At the time, he says, “no serious composers were using real-time computer instruments for concert music.” Word spread at IRCAM that Machover’s opera was, to say the least, unusual. Over the course of December 1987, “VALIS” opened to packed houses in Paris, eliciting both cheers and groans of horror. “It was really controversial,” Machover says, “It really stirred people up. It was like, ‘Wow, we’ve never heard anything like this. It has melody and harmonies and driving rhythms in a way that new music isn’t supposed to.’” “VALIS” existed somewhere between an orchestra and a rock band, the purely acoustic dissolving into the electric as the opera progressed. In today’s era of the remix, audiences might be accustomed to a mélange of musical styles, but then this hy...\n\nNew on #opensheetmusicdisplay: Jianpu notation, also called Numbered Musical Notation, is a simplified musical notation that uses numbers instead of the 5 stafflines, clefs, noteheads and so on. It originated in China, but is used in many countries in the world, including Japan and the US. It is especially popular and in demand in Asian countries for education, traditional instruments or choral and folk music. OSMD now has a setting to enable Jianpu mode, in which any MusicXML file is rendered in Jianpu notation instead of classical western notation. This is now available in early access for OSMD sponsors, so please feel free to give us feedback. We have already worked with some Asian partners to improve early versions of our renderer, so we feel like it is already in a very solid state. Here is the classical version/notation: You can switch between both versions at the push of a button, basically: osmd = true; osmd(); And as on the main branch of our sponsor repository, this comes with full audio playback functionality, where the cursor moves along with the playback. This works mainly in the browser, though it’s also possible to implement it in mobile apps. OSMD-Jianpu is available now in early access for sponsors on the feat/jianpu branch in the sponsor repository. By becoming a monthly sponsor, you get access to the audio player and Jianpu display, and support the development team also for general improvements to OSMD. We could not do it without you The post Jianpu mode now in early access for Sponsors (Numbered Musical Notation)! appeared first on Open Sheet Music Display. https://lnkd.in/dD2gNGQZ\n\nKahneman wrote something like this in his introduction, in both thought processes and music composing, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms is more intricate than we often realize. We tend to believe that our thoughts follow a linear path, one conscious idea neatly leading to another. However, this is only sometimes the case. Many impressions and thoughts arise in our conscious experience seemingly out of nowhere, without a clear trace of their origin. For example, consider how you come to believe there is a lamp on your desk, how you sense irritation in someone's voice, or how you instinctively respond to a potential threat on the road before consciously processing it. Much of the mental work that generates these impressions, intuitions, and decisions occurs silently within our minds. This same complexity applies to music composing. When asked about the genesis of a musical composition, it may seem straightforward to attribute it to certain emotions or thoughts that inspired it. However, tracing the precise origins and the decision-making process behind translating those thoughts and emotions into a musical form is impossible. In this context, every musician's composition can be seen as improvisation. When the music begins to play, it takes on a life of its own, and as the composer, we should just allow it to flow and enjoy its fluidity.\n\nI Am S.Poorna Sandhiya I Am Here To Share An Article On \" Music\" Music is generally defined as the art of arranging sound to create some combination of form, harmony, melody, rhythm, or otherwise expressive content. Definitions of music vary depending on culture, though it is an aspect of all human societies and a cultural universal. While scholars agree that music is defined by a few specific elements, there is no consensus on their precise definitions. The creation of music is commonly divided into musical composition, musical improvisation, and musical performance, though the topic itself extends into academic disciplines, criticism, philosophy, psychology, and therapeutic contexts. Music may be performed or improvised using a vast range of instruments, including the human voice. some musical contexts, a performance or composition may be to some extent improvised. For instance, in Hindustani classical music, the performer plays spontaneously while following a partially defined structure and using characteristic motifs. In modal jazz, the performers may take turns leading and responding while sharing a changing set of notes. In a free jazz context, there may be no structure whatsoever, with each performer acting at their discretion. Music may be deliberately composed to be unperformable or agglomerated electronically from many performances. Music is played in public and private areas, highlighted at events such as festivals, rock concerts, and orchestra performances, and heard incidentally as part of a score or soundtrack to a film, TV show, opera, or video game. Musical playback is the primary function of an MP3 player or CD player and a universal feature of radios and smartphones. Music often plays a key role in social activities, religious rituals, rite of passage ceremonies, celebrations, and cultural activities. The music industry includes songwriters, performers, sound engineers, producers, tour organizers, distributors of instruments, accessories, and sheet music. Compositions, performances, and recordings are assessed and evaluated by music critics, music journalists, and music scholars, as well as amateurs. #snsinstitutions #snsdesignthinkers #snsdesignthinking\n\nFrom Text to Melody: Exploring the Musical Applications of Text-to-Speech Technology 🎶📚 From Text to Melody: Exploring the Musical Applications of Text-to-Speech Technology 🎶📚 Text-to-speech technology is taking the world by storm, and it's not just for accessibility anymore!

In my teens, I practised on my violin every. single. day. I studied music as an academic subject. I played in the national youth orchestra, formed my own string quartet, conducted the school chamber orchestra, and composed and premiered my own music. I thought I would go pro. Then I became a lawyer. Here is what I discovered: (1) The drafting of written arguments is composing music. As a composer, I take a short musical idea and develop it into a coherent musical piece. As a music arranger, I take a piece of pop music and arrange it for string quartet in a way that maximizes the full creative potential of the instruments. The same creative process is deployed in drafting written submissions because it is all about putting chaos into order. Just as music creation takes place within the context of the rules of music (harmony, meter, structure etc), the facts in written submissions are structured in accordance with the applicable legal principles. (2) Trial preparation is a creative process. As a trial lawyer, I would put in intense thought in writing out the questions to be asked of the witness, ordered to inexorably secure a concession from the witness. The logic in the questions has to be so compelling that all the witness has to say is “yes” to each of the entire series of questions. Every time I compose the questions, I engage the same faculties for composing music. Lots of creativity and attention to logic required. (3) The delivery of oral submissions to a judge is a violin recital. Same for cross-examination of a witness. The output of both endeavours is a polished and convincing product to the judge or musical audience. That requires intense single-minded concentration and control. The written arguments are there on the page (just as a music score). Now execute it. Communicate it. There can be improvisation, but within the confines of the musical and legal logic. (4) Working in a legal team of lawyers is playing in a string quartet. A high level of teamwork and coordination is required. Musicians come with different interpretations of the music, and we discuss to come to an agreed interpretation. Talking about interpretation, reviving music from a printed music score composed by a composer who has been dead for a few hundred years is no different from trying to decipher the intended meaning from a commercial contract or a piece of legislation based on the text and relevant context. 🎻 Perhaps it should not come as a surprise that parallels can be drawn between two sets of skills. But what surprises me is the extent to which the parallels can be drawn after having deeply engaged with both endeavours. How has your professional life been enriched by your hobbies?

Through meaningful, purposefully crafted music, Kevin brings to life his intention to share and celebrate the intangible power of music and the community that it creates. In his own words: “I began the commitment to a composing after spending a number of years as a public-school teacher, percussionist, and conductor. My background in these positions has helped me immensely to see the human side of how quality, thoughtful music can affect people. “While isolating at times, composing is also such a collaborative art form. As a composer, I have to consider the needs of the client/commissioning party, the performers, and the audience. What should the piece sound like? What makes the performers sound their best? What reaction or emotion do we want to evoke in the audience? “As a composer, I believe that I have the responsibility of creating music that is meticulously crafted and is firmly rooted in the experience of the human beings it is created for. If we are not really saying anything important as artists, what are we really doing? I want to give my listeners and collaborators something that makes them experience something meaningful; perhaps something they didn’t even know that they wanted until they hear it. “While I have worked with some incredible professional musicians and ensembles from around the world, I also leave room to work with amateur musicians on their own musical creations. This has included everything from one-on-one “private lessons,” to taking their simple melodies and creating full orchestral arrangements for them. I’ve created music as personal gifts, and have collaborated with other creatives, corporations, and nonprofits to elevate their products.” bit.ly/FFSCKevinPoelking\n\nWhat Is an Electronic Sackbut? It’s probably not what you think it isALLISON MARSH01 FEB 20247 MIN READ Photo of a crude-looking musical instrument with a keyboard and a rough wooden stand. Behold, the electronic sackbut. DON KENNEDY/NATIONAL MUSIC CENTRE PAST FORWARDELECTRONIC MUSICELECTRONIC SACKBUTHUGH LE CAINEMUSICAL SYNTHESIZERS If you, like me, think of musical synthesizers as an artifact of 1970s rock and disco, then you, like me, will be surprised to learn that the first electronic synthesizer predates those genres by several decades In 1945, Hugh Le Caine, a physicist at Canada’s National Research Council, began working in his spare time on a single-channel musical instrument he dubbed the Electronic Sackbut. He was intrigued by the fact that the three auditory sensations associated with music—namely, pitch, loudness, and timbre—had counterparts in electronics—namely, frequency, amplitude, and the harmonic spectrum obtained by Fourier analysis. To demonstrate those qualities, Le Caine created a synthesizer that mimicked, among other things, a brass horn known as the sackbut. It could also synthesize other horns, as well as string and reed instruments. He envisioned using the electronic sackbut in live performances, to play orchestral, big band, and experimental jazz music. Here’s a recording of one Le Caine composition, “The Sackbut Blues”: Short presentation of the 1948 sackbut: the sackbut bluesWWW.YOUTUBE.COM What is a sackbut? All of my friends who are into Renaissance music love the 2004 Coen brothers film The Ladykillers because it contains one of the few modern references to the sackbut. The original sackbut emerged in the 15th century, and it had a telescopic slide used to change pitch. It fell out of favor by the 18th century, only to be reborn as the modern-day trombone. Le Caine chose to name his synthesizer after a thoroughly obsolete instrument to “afford the designer a certain measure of immunity from criticism.” That is, the electronic sackbut was its own invention, not an imitation of a known sound. https://lnkd.in/gdQ3SZBJ\n\nACCIDENTALS Accidentals in music are symbols that are used to raise or lower the pitch of a note by a semitone. They are called \"accidentals\" because they are not part of the key signature and therefore are considered to be \"accidental\" to the key. The most common accidentals are: * Sharp (#): raises the pitch of the note by a semitone * Flat (b): lowers the pitch of the note by a semitone * Natural (♮): cancels out any previous sharps or flats for that note Accidentals affect all subsequent notes on the same staff line or space for the remainder of the measure in which they appear, unless cancelled by a natural sign or the start of a new measure. Accidentals can be used in a variety of ways, such as: * To indicate a chromatic note (a note that is not part of the key) * To indicate a temporary change of key or mode * To add tension or dissonance to a chord or passage * To create a smooth voice leading As a pianist, it's important to pay close attention to accidentals when reading sheet music or composing, as they can significantly change the sound and character of a piece of music. Additionally, it's important to use them appropriately and sparingly, as overuse can make a piece of music sound cluttered and confusing. ... What chord is this?
