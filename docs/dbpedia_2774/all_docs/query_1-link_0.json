        "text": "Musical artist\n\nTenpei Sato (佐藤 天平, Satō Tenpei) is a video game composer and voice actor. His most notable works are his soundtracks for Nippon Ichi Software games, such as Disgaea and Phantom Brave. He also provides voice-over for games and movies.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nSato was born in 1967 in Kawagoe, Japan and grew up in Tokyo.[1][2] He began playing piano at the age of six, and made his first composition, a piece for guitar, at the age of twelve. His first job was at Telenet Japan, where he composed the score for the action role-playing game XZR and popular side-scroller Valis II. After leaving Telenet, he joined Glodia, and together with Nobuhito Koise, composed the soundtrack to the cult classic Emerald Dragon. Later he would compose both Vain Dream with Abreath Nakamura and Bible Master II. After leaving Glodia, he joined Birdie Software, and produced soundtracks for four of their games. He has since spent much of his career working with Nippon Ichi Software, which is where his music has gained its greatest recognition. Games he has composed for include the Rhapsody series, Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, La Pucelle: Tactics, and Phantom Brave.[2]\n\nA Nippon Ichi concert by the G-Dream 21 Ladies Orchestra was held on June 23 2024 in Ginza, Tokyo. Sato composed the orchestral arrangements of his work and attended as a special guest.[3] In an interview, he commented that he was most looking forward to the orchestral arrangements of \"Determination of a Little Princess\" from the 1999 Rhapsody II, a fan favorite track, and \"Kill Real\" from the 2015 Disgaea 5, which required major revisions to make a chaotic vocal song work for an orchestra.[4]\n\nMusical style and influence\n\n[edit]\n\nSato cites Queen, Claude Debussy, Ryuichi Sakamoto, and Kate Bush as major musical influences.[5]\n\nWorks\n\n[edit]\n\nXZR: Hakai no Gūzō (1988) - with Shinobu Ogawa and Yujiroh\n\nXZR II: Kanketsuhen (Exile) (1988) - with Shinobu Ogawa\n\nCyber City (1989) - with Shinobu Ogawa\n\nValis II (1989) - with Shinobu Ogawa, Masahiro Kajiwara, and Jizou Kurabo\n\nEmerald Dragon (1989) - with Nobuhito Koise\n\nVain Dream (1991) - with Nobuhito Koise and Ikki Nakamura\n\nAlshark (1991)\n\nCal (1991)\n\nBeast (1991)\n\nCal II (1991)\n\nTask Force Harrier EX (1991)\n\nJoker 2 (1992)\n\nBeast 2 (1992)\n\nImperium (1992) - with Tatsuya Sato and Hiroki Uematsu\n\nBeast 3 (1993)\n\nRed: The Adventurous Sequence (1993)\n\nAlvaleak Continent (1993) - with Nobuhito Koise\n\nAlien vs. Predator (1993) - with Hisayoshi Ogura\n\nShinseiki Odysselya (1993) - with Hisayoshi Ogura\n\nBible Master II: The Chaos of Aglia (1994)\n\nEtemiburu: Tenjoumukyuu (1994)\n\nMagna Braban: Henreki no Yusha (1994) - with Tatsuya Sato\n\nAlshark (Sega CD) (1994)\n\nSuper Street Basketball 2 (1994)\n\nPhilip & Marlowe in Bloomland (1994)\n\nEko Eko Azaraku: Wizard of Darkness (1995)\n\nHard Blow (1997)\n\nCocktail Harmony (1998)\n\nRhapsody: A Musical Adventure (1998)\n\nCombat Choro Q (1999)\n\nRhapsody II: Ballad of the Little Princess (1999)\n\nMagnetic Power Microman: Generation 2000 (1999)\n\nBrigandine: Grand Edition (2000)\n\nReal Pool (2000)\n\nPlay It Pinball (2000)\n\nRhapsody III: Memories of Marl Kingdom (2000)\n\nGadget Racers (2000)\n\nMarl de Jigsaw (2001)\n\nLa Pucelle: Tactics (2002)\n\nMarl Jong!!
