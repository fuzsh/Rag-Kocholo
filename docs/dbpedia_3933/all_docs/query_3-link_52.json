        "text": "While I see a lot of love for Linux, it’s rare to see love for FreeBSD.\n\nI was inspired to write about my experience with FreeBSD by vynncentgm post on their unintentional 14 year Linux challenge.\n\nI started with FreeBSD back in 2004, tinkered but eventually went back to Linux. At the time it didn’t offer much in terms of satisfying my needs.\n\nMuch later on in life, I decided to build my very first FreeNAS server in 2011. From there, I grew my knowledge and eventually became a prolific forum poster in the FreeNAS forum, as well as spent a lot of time in the IRC channel (back when it was Freenode, now Libera.chat) … and still do! As my experience and knowledge with FreeNAS grew I started to branch back out to FreeBSD, now I’m more comfortable with my acquired skills.\n\nIn about 2017, I migrated my own NAS to FreeBSD. I documented my efforts and tried to replicate a number of FreeNAS features that I was accustomed to.\n\nThen in 2019, I was encouraged to submit a talk for vBSDCon about my experience migrating from FreeNAS to FreeBSD, the obstacles I faced, what I tried to replicate. My talk was accepted and can be seen on YouTube.\n\nPart of that talk I said something along the lines of “I miss the auto-snapshotting feature of the OS each time you perform an upgrade”. From that point on I was encouraged to implement this feature in FreeBSD and in late 2021, my changes were accepted into the FreeBSD base and is now available for use in FreeBSD 12.3 and eventually FreeBSD 13.1. While my submission was small, it has the potential to make a big impact. I earned my first Errata Notice on March 15th\n\nSo, do any of you have love for FreeBSD?\n\nI am quite interested in BSD! I want to ask you for some help, if I might.\n\nI looked at the official documentation for OpenBSD and it basically only describes installing the base system, also in an antiquated manner in my opinion with separate partitions for things like /var for example and so on. I have neither found any instructions how to install any BSD on a ZFS root nor any instructions like there are for Arch that explain which options I have and steps I need to take to install things like a proper desktop environment. For Arch there are pages that guide you through the installation, and then mention that it is time to install optional packages, then there is a page with things a user might like to install, like window managers, network utilities and things like that, and then there are links to pages to all of these that explain how to install and configure them.\n\nOn the other hand, as I indicated, I found only basic instructions how to install the BSD base systems, like they come from the disc but no explanations about any user space tools or which user space tools are even available or how to install and configure them.\n\nUsing a BSD distribution for a server is one thing, but to learn I would like to use it as a desktop. If you have any helpful resources in that regard I would gladly take a look at them!\n\nI do, actually\n\nAfter using OPNsense/pfSense and FreeNAS/TrueNAS for the base of my Homelab, I decided I wanted to learn more about the OS running underneath. To my surprise, they weren’t using Debian Linux, like most of the things today seem to do. At the time, I was debating whether I wanted to use Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS (rip) or some other Linux Distro for my Homelab (mostly running a Plex and Nextcloud Server).\n\nAt first, I was septic about using FreeBSD, since it’s entire user base is just as big as one of the “medium sized” Linux Distros and most software projects treate FreeBSD like a second class citizen. The fact the most software runs about 10-20% slower compared to GNU/Linux didn’t help either. But when digging a little deeper and me noticing all the “internal conflicts” in Linux land (e.g. the endless discussions about systemd, Redhat, and Lennart Poettering, all the elitism/looking down at other Linux users for using X Distro and all the Microsoft hate), I decided that I didn’t want to be part of that.\n\nSome reason why I’ve gone for FreeBSD in the end were it’s simplicity: everything is just a human readeable rc / shell script, the amazing ZFS integration (boot environments, ZFS on root by default), Jails, the separation of system and 3rd party packages (/bin or /sbin versus /usr/bin or /usr/bin), the dead simple network configuration and it’s documentation (man pages, handbook, etc).\n\nWhat really helped me switching to BSD are all the books by Michael w. Lucas. The first book of his I’ve read was SSH Mastery. After finishing it I looked for other books he had written and discovered all the OpenBSD / FreeBSD / ZFS e.g. books. I can really recommend these, even if you are a Linux user.\n\nBut especially Jails amazed me, where a container is just a directory with the FreeBSD userland installed, and an entry in /etc/jail.conf. The possibility to just tar up an existing FreeBSD install, scp it to another FreeBSD Host and then extract the tarball and continue using that as a container without any modification just blew my mind.\n\nCreating a LAG with LACP, creating a VLAN Interface on top of that, renaming it and giving it a static IPv4 and IPv6 address and setting gateways literally only takes 1-2 minutes and about 10 lines in /etc/rc.conf. I once did the same in Debian and CentOS, which was everything but fast and easy.\n\nI also like the community which because it is a lot smaller, feels a lot more personal, instead being just “one of many”. I also like the “less casual” feel of the forums and mailing lists, where most people want you to write a properly formatted problem report when asking for help, instead of just writing “X does not work”. But I must also admit that I have a heart for small “underdog” projects, which aren’t “mainstream”.\n\nOne thing why I want to use BSD is the current mono culture that is the Internet, where Linux makes up over 90% of all systems. This is exactly the reason why companies like Verisign use Linux and FreeBSD for their global DNS infrastructure, so their network won’t implode if someone finds a critical vulnerability in either os.\n\nAnother reason is that I really love (Open)ZFS which FreeBSD now uses and develops together with Linux, Apple, illumos and even Microsoft people.\n\nI have already lost all of my digital data twice, which could have easily been avoided if I had used backups and snapshots. I also lost many pictures on an old digital camera due to bitrot. ZFS protects my from all of this, which is likely the reason why I never lost a single file ever since. Another place where ZFS really shines on FreeBSD are boot environments. If there is a big update, freebsd-update(8) just takes a snapshot, creates a boot environment with bectl(8), and if something goes wrong, one can simply reboot and select the old BE and recover their system in seconds.\n\nAll in all, I really like to use, learn about and experiment with FreeBSD. It’s just a personal hobby at the moment, but all the experience I gathered still helped me with problems I encountered at work or with my Linux Desktops.\n\nIMHO, there is a place for Free/Open/NetBSD in the world, together with Linux and all the other Unix like operating systems that exist. Because if you like it or not, things like iOS/MacOS, LibreSSL and OpenSSH for example would probably not exist without BSD."
