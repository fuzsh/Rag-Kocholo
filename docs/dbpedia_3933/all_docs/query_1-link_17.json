        "text": "While it is undeniable that cloud-based services are handy, there are people who would rather do it themselves. For many of us, it is because we want what we want the way we want it. For others, it is a distrust of leaving your personal data on someone’s server you don’t control. Umbrel is a Linux distribution just for people who want to self-host popular applications like NextCloud or Home Assistant. [ItsFoss] has a good review that points out some of the plusses and minuses of the early version of Umbrel.\n\nLibreboot is free (as in freedom) boot firmware, which initializes the hardware (e.g. memory controller, CPU, peripherals) in your computer so that software can run. Libreboot then starts a bootloader to load your operating system. It replaces the proprietary BIOS/UEFI firmware typically found on a computer. Libreboot is compatible with specifical computer models that use the Intel/AMD x86 architecture. Libreboot works well with GNU+Linux and BSD operating systems.\n\nThe last Libreboot release, version 20211122, was released on November 22nd in 2021. This new release, Libreboot 20220710, is released today on July 10th, 2022. This is intended to be a stable release, with some caveats.\n\nYou can find this release in the stable directory on Libreboot release mirrors. If you check in the stable directory, you’ll still only find the 20160907 release in there, so please ensure that you check the testing directory!\n\nThis is a bug fix release, relative to 20211122. No new boards or major features have been added, but several problems that existed in the previous release have now been fixed.\n\nFinally, as the last part of the blog series we will have a look at the network traffic observed. We will do this in two sections, the first one will cover a few things useful to know if we are in the situation that Wireshark can dissect the traffic for us. The second section will look into the situation where the dissection is not nicely done by Wireshark.\n\nQmmp is a free and open-source audio player that is similar to Winamp. It is written in C++ using the Qt widget toolkit for the user interface, and it officially supports the operating systems Linux, FreeBSD, and Microsoft Windows. Qmmp has many features, including support for popular audio formats, themes, equalizer presets, Last.FM scrobbling, lyrics fetching, streaming from SHOUTcast and Icecast stations, skinned interfaces, and more.\n\nThe player also supports plugins, which allow for further customization and functionality. Overall, Qmmp is a powerful and versatile audio player that is well worth checking out for anyone in search of an excellent alternative to Winamp.\n\nDeaDBeeF is an audio player software for Linux, Android, and other Unix-like operating systems and is free and open-source software, except on Android. DeaDBeeF is small in size but big on features. Its interface is customizable and supports themes, and it can play music from CDs and files in many different formats, including MP3, FLAC, Ogg Vorbis, and WAV.\n\nSome other great features include a built-in equalizer and support for plugins. One of the best things about DeaDBeeF is that it’s not resource-intensive and can be used on older computers without any issues. If you’re looking for a lightweight but feature-rich audio player, DeaDBeeF is worth checking out.\n\nThe following tutorial will teach you how to install DeaDBeeF Player on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Jammy Jellyfish using a LaunchPAD APT PPA with the command line terminal.\n\nA sports video game is a video game that simulates the practice of sports. This genre of games is popular in part because of the fantasy element; putting yourself in the place of a top class athlete on the world stage.\n\nRacing games are not covered in this article. We’ve compiled a dedicated round up to showcase fun free and open source Racing Games.\n\nThere is an eligibility criteria that needs to be met to be included in this round up (see below).\n\nLet’s explore the 9 games. For each game we have compiled its own portal page, a full description with an in-depth analysis of its features, a screen shot of the game in action, together with links to relevant resources.\n\n[Kevin O’Connor] writes to us about his project, can2040 – adding CAN support to the RP2040. The RP2040 doesn’t have a CAN peripheral, but [Kevin] wrote code for the RP2040’s PIO engine that can receive and send CAN packets. Now we can all benefit from his work by using this openly available CAN driver. This library is written in C, so it’s a good fit for the lower-level hackers among us, and in all likelihood, it wouldn’t be hard to make a MicroPython wrapper around it.\n\nThe broader problem may be that many of us no longer know how to relate to nature, because we see ourselves as being outside of it. People are so used to experiencing wildlife through the lens of social media or a wildlife series that we’ve come to see ourselves solely as spectators rather than participants when we enter actual wild places. However, let me be clear: When we visit parks with free-roaming wild animals, we have entered a wild area. And we have no special rights or protections, other than our own common sense.\n\nThere are 2.3 million small businesses in Australia. While not all have an active or extensive online presence, digital transformation prompted by the Covid-19 pandemic has made every business increasingly dependent on the secure use of the internet.\n\nIn its latest threat assessment, the Australian Cyber Security Centre reports that small organisations, sole traders, medium-sized businesses, schools and contributors in the supply chain are among the entities most affected by cybercrime and state-sponsored cyber operations. Cybercriminals seek financial gain or sensitive business information and personal data. Even if they are not direct targets, businesses may fall victim due to the spread of ransomware or a data breach.\n\nIranian Hewa Rahimpur, 29, who was living in Ilford, east London, was arrested in May suspected of being a leading figure in a network organising human trafficking via small boats and is facing extradition proceedings to send him to Belgium.\n\nAsked how much the gang was believed to be charging migrants to cross the Channel after lining up boats, engines and life jackets for them, Mr Farrimond said a \"straight trip across the Channel\" was estimated to be charged at between 2,500 and 3,500euros.\n\nRetired radio personality Rick Emerson is one such reader. He was floored by the book in high school, but it failed to pass the smell test as an adult. In 2015, he looked into the background of the book’s mysterious copyright holder, a UCLA-trained therapist named Beatrice Sparks. The result of his seven-year investigation is “Unmask Alice” (BenBella Books), out now —the first full unraveling of the “Go Ask Alice” myth. It’s a story of ambition, deceit and a gullible public, hungry for morality tales.\n\nSadly, the baloney isn’t hard to detect.\n\nThat $500 million investment in carbon removal? It represents about 0.1 percent of Alphabet, Microsoft, and Salesforce’s collective revenues last year. And it’s dwarfed by the nearly one trillion dollars that energy companies plan to put into new oil and gas projects — so-called “carbon bombs” each blasting more than a billion tons of carbon skyward — by 2030. Likewise, the 150,000 metric tons of carbon removal promised by Swiss Re and Boston Consulting is barely a sliver (0.00002 percent) of the extra 646 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas that those carbon bomb projects are expected to spew into the atmosphere — pollution that will cook the planet for centuries, unless it can be later removed.\n\nIn the decades since the 1970s oil-price shocks sent inflation soaring and shackled economic growth, price stability was maintained even when growth was robust. Many policymakers and economists took a bow, proudly claiming that they had found the magic formula. Underpinning the so-called Great Moderation were independent central banks that could anchor inflationary expectations by credibly committing to raise interest rates whenever inflation reared its ugly head – or even act preemptively when necessary. Independence meant that central banks need not – and typically did not – worry about balancing the costs (generally lost output and jobs) against any putative benefits.\n\n\"Sometimes Twitter has ignored Mr. Musk's requests, sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified, and sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving Mr. Musk incomplete or unusable information,\" Musk's lawyer, Mike Ringler, wrote.\n\nLegal experts say this may not be sufficient grounds to break off the $44 billion deal without Musk being on the hook for a hefty fine. In response to Musk's letter, the chair of Twitter's board said it planned to sue.\n\nSailor Moon's North American syndication is a story that must be told from the separate perspectives of audiences in both America and Canada. When it came to dubbing Sailor Moon, Toei Animation (best known for Dragon Ball and One Piece) would place their trust in DiC -- a decision that would go down in infamy and nearly cost the series its Western audience. Censorship, the cutting of five episodes and changes to character backstories would go on to create a beast that only bore a slight resemblance to what came before. Poor performance with US audiences eventually led to the cancelation of its original syndication after only airing up to the first half of the second season.\n\nThankfully, Sailor Moon's cancelation would not be the nail in the coffin for Western viewers, as the show was supported by the community DiC left behind. North of the United States, Sailor Moon's popularity was substantially more pronounced, leaving Canadian fans confused at DiC's decision. In response, a group called 'Save our Sailors' (or SOS for short) was formed to revive the English dub from the ashes. On December 14, 1996, SOS embarked on a 'procott' (the opposite of a boycott) of Strawberry Frosted Pop-Tarts to court sponsors for the English version of the anime, although the effectiveness of this campaign is debatable.\n\nA Facebook friend who doesn’t seem insane regularly shares instances of where Facebook deletes or hides her content.\n\nIn many cases the reasons seem silly or arbitrary, like an AI that doesn’t really understand the content or get the joke. One shows a floating tent, captioned “Floating tent sleeps 4 and offers a cool new way to die while camping.” Other deletions seem more understandable, like the thumb with a face on it and a string tied around in a shape like a noose: it’s not explicitly about lynching, but it’s clearly intending to evoke that imagery. Poor taste, likely offensive, a bad joke, but is it censor-worthy?\n\nFacebook also often just gets it wrong...\n\nOver the last few months, we have slowly awoken to a troubling new world. The unfamiliar America that is emerging has become post-Roe, post-gun control, post-safe schools, post-Supreme Court impartiality, post-majoritarian and possibly post-fair elections (we shall see in November and in 2024). The US, which has been teetering on the edge of a cliff for some time, is now starting to tip into an abyss of \"minority rule medievalism.” €\n\nIranian authorities arrested an outspoken pro-reform activist, saying he conspired to act against state security, semi-official media in Iran reported Saturday.\n\nThe arrest is the latest in a wave of detentions against the backdrop of escalating tensions with the West and Tehran's rapid advancement of its nuclear work, while talks to revive the landmark 2015 atomic accord remain at a standstill.\n\nThe semi-official Fars news agency said activist Mostafa Tajzadeh was taken into custody on Friday afternoon and charged with \"gathering (to protest) and conspiracy to act against the country's security.\"\n\nThe Taliban’s appointments fill holes left when thousands of Afghan civil servants fled the country last year. The calibre of the replacements is often questionable. The new Taliban counterpart of the medical director at one Kabul hospital at least has a degree in medicine. But at other hospitals, staff said the new Taliban appointees were fighters or village clerics with more interest in how women dressed than in public health.\n\nNor are things much better at the highest levels of government. The cabinet is packed with ethnic-Pushtun Taliban stalwarts. Other groups are sidelined. Appointments “have favoured loyalty and seniority over competence”, notes a un report. Decision-making is unpredictable, say foreign officials who deal with the new government.\n\nAny hope that the demands of running a battered country might mellow the militants’ ideology was dashed last week, after the regime held a jirga, or grand council, of religious scholars. More than 3,000 clerics and notables—all men—were invited to Kabul for three days of confabulation. It was the biggest gabfest since the Taliban took power. Speculation was rife that the jirga would revisit the unpopular decision to stop girls going to secondary school. Marginalised ethnic groups as well as some inside the Taliban sought signs of compromise from a leadership they see as increasingly remote and autocratic.\n\nI have two text UI games which I love. I had played them once, then I was playing them many times through time, and I can always play them again. It doesn't matter if I haven't played them for some time, because I'm feeling always like I am at home. One of that games I described almost a year ago in [Dwarf Fortress]. The second one is [ADOM].\n\nI don't remember how I started to play. ADOM is so old that in my memories it's convergent with the beginning of the PC's gaming era. I must read about it in one Roguelike-games article. Why did I start to play the text UI game? Probably because I'm writing many simple text games of life in BASIC. With colorful ASCII characters. So the ADOM must had been looking very familiar to me. But all of this is unclear now. Especially that there were many games, with hi-res graphics mode, which I also want to play then. For unknown reasons, however, I played in ADOM.\n\nPart of my old computing challenge is to limit my bandwidth speed. I chose 1mb/s download and 500kb/s upload, as I can do everything I usually do, although with a bit more waiting and patience.\n\nWe are used for everything to load instantly on the internet, which facilitates the big tech corporations interests, by making it possible for them to make addictive products or use techniques like infinite scrolling. Besides, not having everything load instantly can make you grow patience and it gives you time to think think before doing something on the internet, or gives you the nostalgic feeling of the internet before the 2010s. Most web programs are so heavy they don't load with the speed caps I've put, so I suggest to you that if it a program doesn't load with this speed, it should be removed from your workflow. Not everyone has access to good internet speed, and this facilitates discriminating against those that cannot afford or don't have at all high internet speed, because they cannot load all the bloat of today's web pages. We've become entitled to having everything instantly delivered to us, which is a form of instant gratification."
