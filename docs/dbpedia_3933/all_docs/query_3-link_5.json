        "text": "Packet filtering + NAT firewall using IPFW, later adding traffic shaping using Dummynet. Later adding VPN links using OpenVPN.\n\nWeb content filtering proxy/cache server using Squid and DansGuardian.\n\nWebmail server using Postfix, Cyrus IMAP (and some with Dovecot), Cyrus SASL, Apache, and SquirrelMail.\n\n10+ TB storage servers using ZFS and Rsync.\n\nHome media server using ZFS, Samba, and NFS.\n\nDesktop system using KDE 4.3.\n\nBasically, you just need to find something you want to do, or learn about, and try it. Or find something you need to do, and see if you can do it using FreeBSD.\n\nI ran squirrelmail for my website unixhideout years ago it was nice good to hear they are still around because they deserve it. Maybe i'll run that for my self/lan just for the hell of it. I wish i had access to a static IP address, i'd run this shit all over again. Unfortunately it's not in my budget any more.\n\nThere are services out there that will provide (for free if I'm not mistaken) a subdomain of their network that resolves to whatever your home IP is. There's a small piece of software that runs on your box that periodically logs into their system so that they know if your IP changes. IIRC, there's a small amount of lag in the update process, but not bad. This was years ago I saw this - google will probably turn up something if you're interested.\n\nFor myself, I run a mail server (with squirrelmail providing webmail) at work that also masquerades our WiFi hotspot using traffic shaping to prevent wifi users from bogging it down. I've done more than a few custom scripts to tweak how it acts; posted a couple of them here in the 'useful scripts' thread. At home, I just have a server with 2 RAID-1 drives for digital pictures/documents and masquerading services for my network. I've wanted to put in a few cameras and use ZoneMinder to set up a video surveillance system (have this on slackware at work), but the machine is underpowered for that and I really just don't wanna screw with it. My DVR runs MythTV on linux, which I believe also runs on BSD.\n\ntlc337 said:\n\nAFP File server (videos, music, pics, data)\n\nHow do you like AFP? Been really curious about it.\n\nI have a home server which I use to store all my files, as well as:\n\n-ftp\n\n-local dns\n\n-house VoiP system\n\nI often ssh or ftp into it from work or my phone to get media or check on it. I also leave a tight VNC server always running on it with openbox as the WM.\n\nI also have a desktop which i used 50% of them time on freebsd.\n\nJust a custom tailored desktop with openbox and lots of other fun stuff.\n\ninurneck said:\n\nMy box is up and stable I want to do something with it as I got some time on my hands and I am bored. What are some of the useful things you were able to do with FreeBSD?\n\nI have toolbox and i want to do something with it as im bored. What are some useful things you were able to do with a HAMMER ?\n\nYou can use it. You just need a target - why you need it at all.\n\nRuler2112 said:\n\nThere are services out there that will provide (for free if I'm not mistaken) a subdomain of their network that resolves to whatever your home IP is.

This was years ago I saw this - google will probably turn up something if you're interested.\n\nDynamic DNS services, like DynDNS. Works great for getting web servers on the net. Mail used to work great too, but today it is much more painful, as most mail servers out there check the reverse dns name (for lack of a better word), and if that doesn't match the name you mailserver says it has, they don't want to talk to it.\n\nI addition to what is already mentioned in this thread, I run my MythTV backend server on FreeBSD.\n\ntingo said:\n\n... most mail servers out there check the reverse dns name (for lack of a better word), and if that doesn't match the name you mailserver says it has, they don't want to talk to it....\n\nNot entirely correct. The host/DNS name of your mailserver is not really relevant. If the connecting IP (your IP address) has a reverse DNS record of, say, 123-123-123-123.dsl-provider.com, and the A record for 123-123-123-123.dsl-provider.com does not match the IP address making the connection, some mailservers (certainly not all) will refuse to talk to you; others will just print 'may be forged' in a logfile and in the headers, and yet others will add a few points to a SpamAssassin score or something to that effect. There are, however, some mailservers that refuse to talk to an IP address that does not have any reverse DNS record. This does stop a lot of spam, but it also blocks a lot of legitimate email traffic, though if an admin wants to take that risk, it's their prerogative.\n\nartcurmudgeon said:\n\nEverything that we use that must be stable and rock solid we use FreeBSD and I wouldnt have it any other way.\n\nBack when I was in high school, a classmate's father was fired as the director of 911 services because he ditched the unix server for windoze. It's more than a little scary to think that my 911 service relies on windoze, but there's not much I can do about it either...\n\nsoupbowl said:\n\nHow do you like AFP? Been really curious about it.\n\nI've been very happy with it. I'm using netatalk and the mdnsd that comes with FreeBSD. I believe that it's the exact same one that OS X uses, as far as the man pages are to be concerned. Anecdotally, it seems to perform much better than Samba in an all OS X client environment. I've never done metrics, though. It worked well enough for me to completely eliminate Samba from my environment, though.\n\nIt worked great for Time Machine, too, when I was still using FreeBSD as the Time Machine host. I've since moved my backups to a bona fide Time Capsule, as I didn't like the idea of being unsupported. But, it worked perfectly for that. I even rebuilt a Macbook completely from the Time Machine (without installing OS X first)."
