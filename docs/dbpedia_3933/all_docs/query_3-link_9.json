FreeBSD is everywhere. In fact, there’s a good chance you’re using at least some code derived from FreeBSD in your everyday life. If you stream movies via Netflix, chat with friends on WhatsApp, or play the latest PlayStation 4 game sensation, you’re already using FreeBSD. That’s only the beginning though, take a look at just some of the companies and applications using FreeBSD.\n\nApple\n\nCisco\n\nDell/Compellent\n\nEMC/Isilon\n\nIntel/McAfee\n\niXsystems\n\nJuniper\n\nMicrosoft Azure\n\nNetApp\n\nNetgate\n\nNetflix\n\nNYI\n\nQuest KACE\n\nSony\n\nStormshield\n\nVerisign\n\nVMware\n\nWhatsApp\n\nYahoo!\n\nFlightAware\n\nA more comprehensive list can be found here.\n\nOpen Source Products from FreeBSD\n\nFreeBSD is also the basis for a number of commercial and open-source operating systems. Some of the most widely used and publicly available systems are listed below.\n\nBSD Router Project\n\nDarwin\n\nDragonFlyBSD\n\nFreeNAS\n\nGhostBSD\n\nHardenedBSD\n\nMidnightBSD\n\npfSense\n\nOPNsense\n\nXigmaNAS\n\nPlease let us know if we’ve missed a product that should be listed here.\n\nLooking for papers and presentations about FreeBSD? Check out papers.freebsd.org.\n\nGet Involved!\n\nFrom code-related tasks, to assisting with documentation, translation, and advocacy, we’re always looking for volunteers to work with an active, committed community, bringing about a better world powered by FreeBSD.
