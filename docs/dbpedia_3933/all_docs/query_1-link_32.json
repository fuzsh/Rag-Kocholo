        "text": "Download Nmap Security Scanner 7 - Discover servers and services on computer networks by sending packets and analyzing responses\n\nNmap Security Scanner:\n\nNmap Security Scanner is a useful utility for network exploration or security testing. Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in new ways to determine which servers are available on the network, what services (application names and versions) that server is providing, the operating system (and version operating) they are running, the type of packet filter/firewall being used, and dozens of other characteristics.\n\nIn addition to the classic command-line Nmap implementation, the Nmap suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer (Zenmap), a flexible debugging, redirection, and data transfer tool (Ncat), a utility to compare scan results (Ndiff) and a packet generation and response analysis tool (Nping).\n\nFeatures of Nmap Security Scanner"
