        "text": "Last Updated on September 1, 2020\n\nDo you remember Winamp? In the late nineties, Winamp version 2 was one of the most downloaded Windows applications. The software’s later releases witnessed a terminal decline in its popularity.\n\nIf you hanker for the good ol’ days, Qmmp might be of interest.\n\nQmmp is a cross-platform, open source, Qt-based multimedia player. The default user interface is similar to Winamp or xmms. But there’s also an alternative user interface.\n\nInstallation\n\nMost popular Linux distributions provide a Qmmp package in their repositories. For example, to install Qmmp in Ubuntu, type:\n\nsudo apt install qmmp\n\nI generally prefer the latest release of software, particularly if the development branch is progressing well. Using the latest software often brings more features and fixes, although the software isn’t as tested as released versions. It’s also a great way to contribute to an open source project, identifying bugs and issues that can accelerate the development process.\n\nThe following describes how to compile the development sources of Qmmp on Manjaro. This is the development branch for Qt5.\n\nsudo pacman -S svn\n\nIf you have svn installed, you can omit the above step.\n\nsvn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/qmmp-dev/code/trunk/qmmp/ qmmp-1.3\n\ncmake ./\n\nmake -j 4\n\n(the -j flag enables the compiler to use more cores, which speeds up compilation.)\n\nmake install\n\nIn operation\n\nHere’s an image of Qmmp in operation. There’s a group of three windows, with the main user interface, together with an equalizer, and a playlist.\n\nIt looks small. Well, there’s a double size option, although the volume bar acquires a strange kink. If the default skin doesn’t appeal, there’s tons of alternative skins available from qmmp.ylsoftware.com/files/skins including a convenient 12MB zip file.\n\nThe above image shows a Pioneer skin.\n\nBut Qmmp also comes with an alternative interface which looks more modern. It’s called the Qmmp Simple User Interface (QSUI). It’s based on the standard widgets set. This interface is started with the command:\n\nqmmp –ui qsui\n\nOn reflection, I prefer QSUI over the default user interface.\n\nThere’s lots of good features in Qmmp. I particularly like the ability to group tracks.\n\nFeatures:\n\nFormats supported: MPEG1 layer 2/3, Ogg Vorbis, Ogg Opus, Native FLAC/Ogg FLAC, Musepack, WavePack, tracker modules (mod, s3m, it, xm, etc), ADTS AAC, CD Audio, WMA, Monkey’s Audio (and other formats provided by FFmpeg library), PCM WAVE (and other formats provided by libsndfile library), Midi, SID, Chiptune formats (AY, GBS, GYM, HES, KSS, NSF, NSFE, SAP, SPC, VGM, VGZ, VTX)\n\nSupports m3u playlists.\n\nReplay Gain mode.\n\n10 band graphic equalizer with presets.\n\nProxy support.\n\nMMS support.\n\nMPRIS (1.0 and 2.0)\n\nRemovable device detection (via HAL or UDisks).\n\nCUE sheet support.\n\nLyrics (using lyrics.wikia.com).\n\nCover art support.\n\nEmbedded CUE support (for FLAC and WavPack)\n\nPlugins offer a good range of functionality.\n\nKeyboard shortcuts.\n\nCross-platform support – supported under Linux, Windows, and FreeBSD.\n\nInternationalization support – translations for Bulgarian, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Czech, Dutch, Finnish, French, Galician, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kazakh, Lithuanian, Polish, Portuguese, Portuguese (Brazilian), Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Turkish, and Ukrainian.\n\nSummary\n\nDo I hanker after an open source Winamp media player? Not really. While the small screen estate consumed by the app is initially appealing, the software’s default skin looks dated. But don’t forget Qmmp has an alternative user interface. And Qmmp offers support for a wide range of audio formats.\n\nI recently wrote about musikcube, a terminal-based media player that ticks all the boxes. I generally revert to using musikcube.\n\nWebsite: qmmp.ylsoftware.com\n\nSupport: SourceForge Project Page\n\nDeveloper: Qmmp Development Team\n\nLicense: GNU GPL v2"
