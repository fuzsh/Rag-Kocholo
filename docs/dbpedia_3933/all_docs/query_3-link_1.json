        "text": "Internet services. Many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) find FreeBSD ideal, running WWW, Usenet news, FTP, Email, and other services. Ready-to-run software like the NGINX or Apache web server or the ProFTPD or vsftpd FTP server make it easy to set up a business or community-centered ISP. Of course, with FreeBSDâs unbeatable networking, your users will enjoy high speed, reliable services.\n\nX Window workstation. From an inexpensive X terminal to an advanced X display, FreeBSD works quite well. Free X software (X.Org(T)) comes with the system. NVIDIA offers native drivers for their high-performance graphics hardware, and the industry standard MotifÂ® and OpenGLÂ® libraries are supported. The Xfce and LXDE products provide a desktop environment. The KDE and GNOME desktop environments also enjoy full support and provide office suite functionality, with further good functionality available in the LibreOffice, OpenOffice.Org and TextMaker products.\n\nNetworking. From packet filtering to routing to name service, FreeBSD can turn any PC into a Internet firewall, email host, print server, PC/NFS server, and more.\n\nSoftware development. A suite of development tools comes with FreeBSD, including the GNU C/C++ compiler and debugger. The LLVM-based clang suite is also provided and will eventually replace the GNU suite. JavaÂ® and Tcl/Tk development are also possible for example, and more esoteric programming languages like Icon work just fine, too. And FreeBSDâs shared libraries have always been easy to make and use. You can also choose from a wide range of popular and powerful editors, such as Emacs and Vim.\n\nNet surfing. A real UNIX workstation makes a great Internet surfboard. FreeBSD versions of Chromium and Firefox are available for serious web users. Surf the web, publish your own web pages, read Usenet news, and send and receive email with a FreeBSD system on your desktop.\n\nEducation and research. FreeBSD makes an excellent research platform because it includes complete source code. Students and researchers of operating systems or other computer science fields can benefit greatly from such an open and well-documented system."
