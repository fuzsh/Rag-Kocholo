I have no such. Instead, I use F9 for pause/resume, F10 for next track and F11 for mute/unmute Audacious. Or rather, I used to do this. Now, as mentioned in my question, I can’t find any such plugin to set the keys. Or maybe I’m being blind to something obvious.\n\nHowever, you made me aware of the keyboard shortcuts for “Media Controller” in KDE Plasma, so I was able to at least get the first two keys (the most important) set up. It works with Audacious for me now. Sadly, there is no “mute/unmute” in there, so I can no longer have such a hotkey, apparently.\n\nI should probably point out that I already do have a “global mute/unmute” button (the Pause/Break key), but this mutes ALL sounds – not just what Audacious is playing (which is usually music). It’s not the end of the world, but still somehow frustrating. Now I can’t quickly mute the music while the rest of the audio keeps playing (such as unrelated video streams, background ambiance by mpv, etc.)…"
