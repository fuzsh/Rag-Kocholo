Combination FreeBSD and Mate a great idea!\n\nIn Ubuntu has a Software Center, PC-BSD has AppCafe.\n\nIn GhostBSD have OctoPkg, But I think it would be more convenient to have a program which shows all installed programs and programs that can be installed from the repository, separated by categories.\n\nTo install the program you want at the click a button.\n\nOrdinary users is difficult to understand in the packet list.\n\nHopefully in the future, developers will add this program because it is the first thing I thought after the OS installation,\n\nRe: Software center\n\nQuote\n\nPost by kraileth » Tue Jan 17, 2017 1:15 pm\n\nHi Cybermax!\n\nGlad you like GhostBSD! Of course you're right: A lot of people are used to solutions like the \"software center\" to install their applications. I think that this would be a good thing since newcomers wouldn't have to think about packages (and dependencies and things like that) while advanced users don't lose anything if they choose to use OctoPkg (or pkg-ng on the terminal).\n\nThere's just one problem (like with most things that would be nice to have but are not essential): It'd be quite a bit of work. Still I'd like to see this happen some time in the future. We're aiming to provide our own package repo for GhostBSD 11.0 and since that will be a lot smaller compared to FreeBSD's (we'll begin with packaging things that we need and others can request additional packages), it might actually be doable.\n\nPC-BSD has used a webapp for the AppCafe which might be something to consider. Hm. There are a few things regarding this forming in my head right now. Of course somebody needs to find some spare time to do this and since there's plenty of other work to do, I cannot promise you anything. But it'd definitely be a useful feature. Thanks for suggesting it here!\n\nRe: Software center\n\nQuote\n\nPost by Cybermax » Tue Jan 17, 2017 2:56 pm\n\nI am glad that my suggestion seems useful. If possible, I will write a few programs that I would like to see the pre-installed, or at least to repository in a future release.\n\n1. Archive program with support for *.rar and *.7z formats.\n\n2. Image organizer - My favorite XnView\n\n3. XnShell - very handy program. Right mouse button-click context menu tumbnail preview.\n\nUnfortunately, this has never been release for Linux, BSD, only Windows. Also, it does not play audio and video, in contradistinction to ACDSee PicaView\n\nMaybe someone will be able to contact the developer and ask to make a version for the BSD or perhaps someone will write an analog of the program.\n\n4. Media player - Qmmp. It just looks and works as good old Winamp. I use it with this or this classic skins.\n\n5. Disc emulator - Honestly, I do not know which program is suitable for BSD. Something similar to WinCDEme is as simple and functional.\n\n6. Disc burning - something as simple and without unnecessary functions similar to Small CD Writer.\n\nI wrote a program list that I think are needed in the first place, perhaps someone of these programs may seem not very necessary. Perhaps this post is to make a separate topic, I'm not sure.\n\nLast edited by Cybermax on Tue Jan 17, 2017 2:59 pm, edited 1 time in total.\n\nRe: Software center\n\nQuote\n\nPost by ericbsd » Tue Jan 17, 2017 2:59 pm\n\nActually there is already something started, call Software Station, but since there is to much to do and not enough time I had to put break on the development of Software Station.\n\nAs soon as GhostBSD 11.0 get to beta I might continue to work on it.\n\nRe: Software center\n\nQuote\n\nPost by ASX » Tue Jan 17, 2017 5:36 pm\n\nericbsd wrote: As soon as GhostBSD 11.0 get to beta I might continue to work on it.\n\nI fixed it for you!\n\nAfter we release GhostBSD 11.0 final, I might continue to work on it\n\nRe: Software center\n\nQuote\n\nPost by ericbsd » Tue Jan 17, 2017 9:00 pm\n\nASX I did really mean BETA and not final, at beta time I should not be developing, but fixing bugs. witch give me time to work on other stuff.\n\nRe: Software center\n\nQuote\n\nPost by ASX » Tue Jan 17, 2017 9:05 pm\n\nericbsd wrote:ASX I did really mean BETA and not final, at beta time I should not be developing, but fixing bugs. witch give me time to work on other stuff.\n\nYep, I know what you wrote, that's why I fixed it. We will see.\n\nRe: Software center\n\nQuote\n\nPost by ericbsd » Tue Jan 17, 2017 9:18 pm\n\nI am always working on side project other than GhostBSD, that would not change much, but those not mean I plan to have the software station ready anytime soon.\n\nRe: Software center\n\nQuote\n\nPost by kraileth » Wed Jan 18, 2017 12:46 am\n\nericbsd wrote:Actually there is already something started, call Software Station, but since there is to much to do and not enough time I had to put break on the development of Software Station.\n\nAs soon as GhostBSD 11.0 get to beta I might continue to work on it.\n\nThat's of course even better than having to start from scratch!"
