Linux nnight seem intimidating, but you’ve come to the right place if you want to get started. Every time I come to write an introduction to one of these guides, I seem to relate a story of how I’ve ruined something by being unprepared. This guide is no different. My first experience with Linux was one of desperation: I really had to try it, being an unabashed computer nerd, and when I finally got my hands on an early copy of Mandrake Linux - in a box, on a real CD-ROM! - I set to installing it without thinking. I didn’t need that software or those documents, it seems. I also didn’t need a working computer, clearly, as Linux wasn’t particularly friendly when it came to compatibility at the time. Things have changed. Modern Linux distributions tend to work first time with whatever hardware you have. Every recent distro I’ve tried installs nicely alongside other operating systems like Windows and other flavours of Linux. You can also get by - just - without ever touching the command line, as long as you’re not looking to push your OS too far. However you want to use Linux, from GUI to command line and beyond to more practical purposes, Linux Made Simple has you covered. I’ve collected together a host of guides and tutorials from my expert colleagues at Linux Format magazine, which will get you up and running and take you further, too. And if you get hooked. I’d highly recommend subscribing to LXF (see page 144). You won’t find a better Linux magazine. Alex Cox, Editor The MADE SIMPLE Manifesto Made Simple books are designed to get you up and running quickly with a new piece of hardware or software. We won't bombard you with jargon or gloss over basic principles, but we will... / Explain everything in plain-English so you can tackle your new device or software with confidence and really get to know how to use it / Break instructions down into easy-to-follow steps so you won't be left scratching your head over what to do next / Help you discover exciting new things to do and try - exploring new technology should be fun and our guides are designed to make the learning journey as enjoyable as possible for you / Teach you new skills you can take with you through your life and apply at home or even in the workplace / Make it easy for you to take our advice everywhere with you by giving you a free digital edition of this book you can download and take with you on your tablet, smartphone or laptop - see page 146 for more details on this offer How are we doing?

It means different things to different people, from the purist who considers it to be the kernel, to the GNU advocate who sees it as a part of GNU/Linux and the new user who thinks it is another name for Ubuntu. In truth, Linux is all of these, depending on your point of view. Strictly speaking, the term Linux used alone refers to the kernel of the operating system, while GNU/Linux is the whole operating system, comprising the Linux kernel and GNU tools - either would be useless without the other (or one of its alternatives). If you then add a collection of application software, along with some tools to manage the whole thing, you have a distro, such as Ubuntu. There are lots of individual components that make up the operating system we know as Linux, but they are not that individual - they all have to fit together, so here we will try to explain how the whole is the sum of its parts, and what those parts do. What is Linux? There’s... a penguin? And something called a distro? Don’t worry: we’ve got the answers. What is an OS? What is a distro? n operating system can be defined as the software needed to enable the applications to run on the hardware - as such, it consists of several interleaved layers. At the heart we have the kernel, which interacts directly with the hardware through its drivers and allows other software to use that hardware. On top of that, we have various layers that handle things such as input devices, networking, sound and video. Normally, you don’t need to know anything about this. It can be helpful to know some of it when things go wrong, but even then it is not essential, especially if you can find someone to fix the computer for you. But if you are reading this book, there is a good chance that you are interested in what is happening ‘down below’, so we will try to give you an idea of what goes where, and what it does when it gets there. A Linux distribution is just that, a way of distributing a Linux-based operating system and accompanying software. At the start, it was just the files the OS needs and a way of installing them on your computer. Along the way, distros acquired package managers, update tools, configuration GUIs and a host of other niceties. However, underneath the user-friendly (or not if you are a Gentoo user) gloss, all distros are still Linux. 10 I Linux Made Simple The kernel The nerve centre at the heart of your Linux operating system. T he kernel is the beating heart of the system, but what is it? The kernel is the software interface to the computer’s hardware. It communicates with the CPU, memory and other devices on behalf of any software running on the computer. As such, it is the lowest-level component in the software stack, and the most important. If the kernel has a problem, every piece of software running on the computer shares in that problem. The Linux kernel is a monolithic kernel - all the main OS services run in the kernel. The alternative is a microkernel, where most of the work is done by external processes, with the kernel doing little more than co-ordinating. While a pure monolithic kernel worked well in the early days, when users compiled a kernel for their hardware, there are so many combinations of hardware nowadays that building them all into the kernel would result in a huge file. So the Linux kernel is now modular, the core functions are in the kernel file (you can see this in /boot as vmlinuz-version) while the optional drivers are built as separate modules in / lib/modules (the .ko files in this directory). For example, Ubuntu 14.04’s 64-bit kernel is SMB in size, while there are a further 3,700 modules occupying over 100MB. Only a fraction of these are needed on any particular machine, so it would be insane to try to load them all with the main kernel. Instead, the kernel detects the hardware in use and loads the relevant modules, which become part of the kernel in memory, so it is still monolithic when loaded even when spread across thousands of files. This enables a system to react to changes in hardware. Plug in a USB memory stick and the usb-storage module is loaded, along with the filesystem module needed to mount it. In a similar way, connect a 3G dongle, and the serial modem drivers are loaded. This is why it is rarely necessary to install new drivers when adding hardware: they’re all there just waiting for you to buy some new toys to plug in. Computers that are run on specific and unchanging hardware, such as servers, usually have a kernel with all the required drivers compiled in and module loading disabled, which adds a small amount of security. If you are compiling your own kernel, a good rule of thumb is to build in drivers for hardware that is always in use, such as your network interface and hard disk filesystems, and build modules for everything else. Even more modules The huge number of modules, most of which are hardware drivers, is one of the strengths of Linux in recent years - so much hardware is supported by default, with no need to download and install drivers from anywhere else. There is still some hardware not covered by in-kernel modules, usually because the code is too new or its licence prevents it being included with the kernel (yes ZFS, we’re looking at you). The drivers for Nvidia cards are the best known examples. Usually known as third-party modules, although Ubuntu also refers to ‘restricted drivers’, these are installed from your package manager if your distro supports them. Otherwise, they have to be compiled from source, which has to be done again each time you update your kernel, because they are tied to the kernel for which they were built. There have been some efforts to provide a level of automation to this, notably DKMS (Dynamic Kernel Module Support), which automatically recompiles all third-party modules when a new kernel is installed, making the process of upgrading a kernel almost as seamless as upgrading user applications. Phrases that you will see bandied about when referring to kernels are “kernel space” and “user space”. Kernel space is memory that can only be accessed by the kernel: no user programs (which means anything but the kernel and its modules) can write here, so a wayward program cannot corrupt the kernel’s operations. User space, on the other hand, can be accessed by any program with the appropriate privileges. This contributes towards the stability and security of Linux, because no program, even running as root, can directly undermine the kernel. > The number of options when building a kernel is truly staggering, and the majority of them relate to hardware device support. Aren’t you glad we have distro maintainors to work it all out for us? I “So much hardware is supported, with no need to download drivers” » Linux Made Simple | 11 Get started What is Linux? > Removing the boot splash screen shows the boot process in its entirety, including the status of the services being started. Boot sequence The mysterious sequence of flashes and beeps at startup. M ost distros go straight to a splash screen when booting, so we don’t see what is happening. In fact, there’s a lot going on both before the splash screen appears and then hidden by the screen. The BIOS starts up first, in the motherboard’s hardware. It looks for a boot device and loads code from there. In the case of a hard drive using the traditional DOS partition system, this is contained in the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the drive - just 512 bytes of storage. 64 bytes are used to hold the partition table for the drive (which is why only four primary partitions are available), leaving all of 446 bytes for the bootloader code, usually Grub. 446 bytes doesn’t give room for much in the way of features, so all this code does is load the rest of the boot code from elsewhere on the disk, from a location set when the MBR code was installed by the bootloader. The bootloader reads its configuration file, usually /boot/grub2/grub.cfg, for a list of boot options, and either displays a menu or goes straight to the default boot. Linux is not involved at this point, because there is only the bootloader code running. The configuration file tells the bootloader the location of the Linux kernel, and any initramfs “The config file tells the bootloader the location of the Linux kernel” hhArEM (ri-blu m SfcBi-ivdl knlaq 1 Lferbhii| P ftik Ihi fc Mipi feliicfcH Mrt nriLite Im m'FI fan* fenm Lai Lnljriwi nduln till.

If you want to see what happens from here on, you can disable the splash screen on most distros by pressing the [E] key to edit the Grub menu entry, removing any quiet and splash options and pressing [FIO] to continue booting. Why use a ramdisk? Most distros use an initramfs file. The main reason for this is that certain drivers have to be loaded with the kernel, particularly those needed to load anything for the disk drive (like SATA controllers and filesystem code). For a generic distro, building all possible options into the kernel would make it unworkably large, so everything is built as modules and those needed for booting are included in the initramfs. This is a type of ramdisk that is loaded with the kernel by the bootloader (using the BIOS routines to read it from the disk) containing all the files needed to mount the root partition. This is done using the kernel’s device detection to decide which to load, and then control is passed to the hard disk proper. The initramfs is also used to load any splash screens, so they appear right at the start of the boot process. Once the root partition is mounted, directly or via the initramfs, the init sequence starts in earnest. Traditionally, this involves running /sbin/init, which then runs everything else, as controlled by /etc/inittab, and is responsible for the list of service start-up messages you see scrolling up the console if you have no splash screen. This also allows you to see where the boot process is hanging or taking an unreasonable time if you experience such problems. tvkESMl DlU Blaklk^ kiiMk.

On the latest hardware, the BIOS has been replaced by UEFI, although once the bootloader is installed you won’t The GNU of GNU/Linux The GNU (Gnu’s not Unix) project predates Linux by several years. It had created most of the basic tools needed by a computer of the early 1980s - compilers, text editors, file and directory manipulation commands and much more - but did not have a usable kernel (some would say their kernel, GNU Hurd, is still not that usable). When Linus Torvalds started tinkering with his small project in 1991, he had a kernel without the tools to run on it. The two were put together and GNU/Linux was born - an operating system using the Linux kernel and the GNU toolset. It is not only the programs in /bin and /usr/bin that come from GNU; glibc is the core G library used in Linux and it also comes from GNU. So just about any time you do anything on your computer, every time you type a command or click an icon, GNU software is being run at some level. No wonder the GNU die-hards get upset when we refer to our operating system as Linux and not GNU/Linux. It is worth mentioning that no one really denies the importance of the GNU aspect: calling the OS Linux rather than GNU/Linux has far more to do with convenience and laziness than politics - the full title is just too cumbersome. > Sorry Richard, we can’t be bothered to say ‘GNU slash’ every time. » 12 I Linux Made Simple GET THE MOST FROM Technology Tips Guide GOOGLE N google ^ 468 INCREDIBLE TIPS.

There are also moves to replace the traditional SysVinit system, which has been around for many years. Ubuntu introduced Upstart, while Red Hat and Fedora are championing systemd. While they all do the same basic job - start the tasks that need to be started to get the OS running - the methods differ. The main difference is that SysVinit is sequential - each service must be started before the next is tackled: one slow starting service affects everything else. Upstartar\\6 systemd start services in parallel, avoiding such bottlenecks. Of course, there are those who argue that Linux is so stable that boot times are irrelevant - if you hibernate instead of shutting the machine down, reboots become rare. ffikMliifftf- COM)]* in high mwlatltm : 4 q not Hh fw mh IDI 57 hKil M Cxlhlfig LImlf lyMlea Intalleri wt the dlih <■> ^lj i i lwwliiw , i uC I i iltorwiKw bunwl with liwri 7 } 'Ih^lEiriletiE.-iieCi ' htarl Ihh grhffhlcal hDvhmiMqvt fll ba liat]i fnv tiah iHge frlhtttv^ %hu hrrtwl (mcwEilEI Nillh anra c4wi« .. £> Slaaiar« Mhll brail trfmu£4l ulUi aire ehalce .. ti7 hItjmMlIv* 'JRblt hfnriarJ with nw iihnie* I) AlbThailw MMi tamwl with pure rJatli*- • 1 bni Ina Mrrt haj-^ ilah «.i iMil fna» Mcmi harH lith > Grub is the most popular bootloader. Live CDs and USB sticks are more likely to use isolinux or syslinux. L inux uses libraries to share code between applications. If a program, foo, uses functions that could be useful elsewhere, it places them in libfoo. Then when another program, such as the imaginatively named bar, wants to use the same function, it has only to link to libfoo rather than reinventing the wheel. This means that there is only one copy of the code on your computer: if either project discovers a bug in the code, it will be fixed for both. It also introduces the concept of dependencies: both foo and bar depend on libfoo and are useless without it. This led to the phenomenon of ‘dependency hell’, where trying to install a program errored out with a list of unsatisfied dependencies, and trying to install those gave more dependencies. This is largely an unpleasant memory nowadays, as distro repositories became more comprehensive and package managers better at sorting things out. If you stick with your distro’s package manager and repositories, all dependencies should be taken care of without you even having to think about them. Try installing somerandom.deb or somerandom.rpm you downloaded from www.somerandomsite.com and you’ll soon discover “You can see which libraries a program is linked to with Idd’’ why you should let the package manager take ^ care of things. One solution proposed to this is j that all programs should be compiled statically. This means that instead of dynamically linking to the code in libfoo and loading when needed at run time, foo and bar each include the code in their executable programs. This means each program file is a standalone object with no dependencies: it can also make it a lot larger than it would be with dynamic linking and means that if a bug or security flaw is found in the libfoo code, both foo and bar will need to be recompiled and repackaged for your distro to fix the situation. Generally, dynamic linking is preferred on non-embedded devices, but there is one place where statically linked programs are useful: in an initramfs loaded at boot time, because it avoids the need to include libraries in the ramdisk image. If you are curious, you can see which libraries any program is linked to with the Idd command. Idd /usr/bin/someprogram shows all the libraries that program needs, and the libraries they need and so on, until you almost always end up at libc - the granddaddy of Linux libraries. Libraries The logic behind sharing functions between programs. Package managers The great flexibility of Linux distributions means that most elements can be changed. Default applications, desktops, even kernels can be swapped around, so it’s best to think of a Linux distribution such as Fedora or Ubuntu as merely a starting point for any customisation that you want to do. The one thing that can’t be changed so easily is the package manager, so the only way to try a different package manager is to try a different distro. Try comparing SUSE’s V^sf with Debian’s Synaptic, for example, and you’ll be amazed at the difference that such a fundamental tool can make to your experience of using Linux.

Graphics How your Linux box stays looking so tickety-boo. y Tools such as KDE’s monitor settings help with things like setting up dual monitors, but for a single display you shouldn’t need to configure Xat all. T he X Window System is the standard basis for providing a graphical interface. While the likes of KDE and Gnome provide the user interface and eye candy, it is through X that they communicate with the hardware. For many years, this was a mass of arcane configuration options and required a lengthy configuration file containing things such as modelines that specified the likes of pixel clock rates and sync frequencies. These days, most systems will run without any configuration file at all. Massive improvements in hardware detection mean that a system with a single video card and single display will ‘just work’. You may need to install extra drivers to get 3D acceleration if you are using, for example, an Nvidia card, but otherwise you just boot the computer and start clicking your mouse. Xhas a client/server architecture. X itself runs as the server, maintaining the display: client programs then communicate with the server, telling it what to draw and where. Legacy features This may seem excessively complex, but it uses local sockets to communicate between the clients and server, so there is no significant performance hit. One clear advantage of this method is that the client and server do not have to be running on the same computer. You can connect to another computer by SSH and, providing the configuration gives permission for this, run a program on the remote computer and have its GUI displayed on your local screen. This is different from the likes of VNC because only the one application’s window is displayed locally, and it only appears locally - not on the remote computer. A VNC connection mirrors the whole desktop on both computers. Some consider the client/server architecture to be overly complex, so there are moves to develop more simple methods of running a graphical display. The most advanced is Wayland. This takes a different approach: not only is the old client/server setup gone, but l/l/ay/anc/ leaves the rendering of windows and other display elements to the client applications, usually using OpenGL and Cairo. This simplifies Wayland: ^contains a lot of legacy rendering code that’s required by the X specification but never used. By giving control to the clients, l/l/ay/anc/ can be lighter, more efficient and future-proof. It also means your graphical software has more control over how the GUI is displayed. “These days, most systems will run without any configuration file” Daemons If you ever disable the splash screen most distros use to cover the boot messages, you will see a screen full of information about services being started. What are these services, and are they all necessary? The services are the programs that run in the background, making the computer as useful as it is. Some deal with networking, others handle hardware detection and configuration, while more are the traditional software services, or daemons, that provide functions to other programs when needed. The answer to the second part of that question is most likely to be \"no\". While some of these services are used by almost all systems, such as the syslog daemon that handles writing information to system log files, others may not be needed. There is no need to start CUPS, the printing system, if you don’t have a printer available. Similarly, the MySQL database server may not be needed, nor the SSH daemon if you have only one computer on your network. So spending half an hour experimenting could shave a second off your boot time. You may also save some resources by not starting unnecessary services, but once loaded these daemons consume almost no system resources, and even the memory that they use can be swapped out if they are not called. So only disable those services you know you will never need. Having them patiently listening on a network port or socket makes the operation of your client programs that bit more efficient. Programs don’t need to include, or load, code for opening, writing to and closing log files, they just call the syslogO function with the log text, and the daemon takes care of the rest. Syslog is an important service - when something goes wrong, this is often the first place to look, as most programs send error messages to the system log (usually at /var/log/messages). Servltn (Aunfeverf. BcrwicH > It is possible to reduce your boot time by only running the services you need. Why are background services called daemons? There are a few explanations: we prefer the story that daemons were beings in Greek mythology that handled tasks that the gods could not be bothered with. 16 I Linux Made Simple Networking How your computer talks to others. N etworking is core to Linux. Even on a standalone machine with no connection to a local network, let alone the internet, networking is still used. Many services run on a client/server model, where the server runs in the background waiting for instructions from other programs. Even something as basic as the system logger runs as a networked service, allowing other programs to write to log files. The X graphics system is also networked, with the Xserver running the desktop and programs, telling it what they want displayed. This is why it is so simple to run X programs on a remote desktop - as far as the system is concerned, there is no major difference between that and opening a window locally. Running ifconfig will always show at least one interface, called lo with an address of 127.0.0.1 - this is used by the computer for talking to itself, which is regarded as a more sane activity for computers than people. Most other networking is based on TCP/IP, either over wired Ethernet or wireless, but there are other types of network in use. All distros and desktops include good tools for configuring and maintaining TCP/IP networks, from the fairly ubiquitous NetworkManagerto individual tools such as Gnome’s network configuration tool or OpenSUSE’s Vast More recent additions to the networking scene include 3G mobile communications and PAN (Personal Area Network) technologies such as Bluetooth. Using a 3G mobile broadband dongle is usually simple, either using NetworkManageror your desktop’s PPP software. Yes, 3G modems really do work like modems using dialscripts and everything, but without the cacophony of squawks as you connect (younger readers should ignore the last statement). Most problems with 3G are caused by trying to set them up in a poor signal area rather than with either the hardware or software support in Linux. The protocol of kings Bluetooth is becoming more important as mobile devices proliferate, and the number of input and output devices using it is increasing. It’s not only phone and tablet users who benefit - a Bluetooth mouse and speakers can enhance the use of a laptop when at your desk, without having to plug everything in before you can start working. PulseAudio (see the section on sound) makes this easier, because it can switch between devices when they are detected. Storage Storing data on a hard disk can involve several layers in itself. All physical storage (as opposed to network storage) in Linux revolves around block devices, so called because disks store data in blocks. A block device like /dev/sdal does indeed refer to blocks, physical areas on the disk, and a collection of them as a disk partition. On top of that we have a filesystem, which is how the data is stored in a sensible structure of directories and files, containing both data and metadata. What’s the difference? Let’s say you save a file containing some text. The data in that file is the text, but the file has other attributes: there is the owner of the file, the time they created it, the time they last modified it, the time it was last read and who has permission to read or modify it. This is the information you see when you Is -I a file, or inspect its properties in your file manager, and this is stored by the filesystem. The standard filesystem in use nowadays is ext4, but there are alternatives such as ext3, ReiserFS, XFS, JFS and, of course, FAT and NTFS from the world of Windows. > Networking is core to the operation of a Linux system. The localhost interface is set up automatically; for the rest we have programs such as NetworkManager. Other Linuxes Everything we have covered relates to Linux running on desktops, laptops and servers - traditional computer hardware if you like, but there are other environments where Linux is used. Many embedded devices, from routers to PVRs and set-top boxes, run Linux, and in many ways it’s similar to the Linux we know and love. If your router allows SSH access, you will often feel at home as soon as you log in. There is another class of device that has seen a huge uptake in recent years and runs a rather different Linux. No prizes for guessing we are referring to the smartphone and its tablet siblings, running Android. Android is Linux, it uses a Linux kernel, but it is not GNU/Linux. The kernel may be based on the same source code, but everything running on top is different. The principles are similar in some ways, but the implementation is very different - although you will find familiar command line tools if you can get to a shell prompt on your phone. » Linux Made Simple | 17 Get started What is Linux? Desktops Gnome, KDE Cinnamon, Unity - we’ll just call it the user interface. I f you consider the kernel to be the lowest level of the system, the highest level is the user interface. Everything else, from the kernel through the drivers and hardware interfaces, is of no use until you can use the computer. This generally means a graphical desktop, and here we come across more layers. X (or maybe Wayland 'm the future) simply provides a blank canvas. You then need something to provide the niceties of a windowed interface, and that something is the window manager. In the past, window managers were standalone systems, and there are still plenty of these available, such as OpenBox or Enlightenment but nowadays they are often part of a larger desktop environment. Strictly speaking, a window manager is responsible for the handling of windows on the desktop, their opening, closing, placement and other manipulations. Over time, they grew to incorporate other features, such as taskbars and program launcher menus, until they developed into desktop environments. Software collections A desktop environment is simply a more or less integrated collection of utilities to provide the features needed to run a complete desktop. Running programs, manipulating their windows, keeping track of what is going on and enabling programs to communicate with one another are all features of desktop environments, but they still have a window manager at their heart - KWinior- KDE and Metacity \\r\\ Gnome to name but two. What sets a desktop environment apart from a window manager is the level of integration. This is > There are also plenty of lightweight window managers, like OpenBox running on CrunchBang here. particularly evident in KDE, where everything works around a common core, and programs not only communicate with one another, but an instance of one program can even be embedded in the window of another. While it may not make much sense to use KWin on Gnome, you may want to try one of the more specialist window managers that offer greater control over window handling, or use a different method of displaying them. There are tiling window managers, like awesome and xmonad, that resize windows so they all fit on the desktop (KDE has its own option to behave like this). There are also window managers designed to be controllable with the keyboard, and minimal window managers that are useful for specialist systems that run a single program in a full-screen window and don’t want any widgets cluttering up the place. > Gnome, KDE, Unity, Cinnamon, Mate - we aren’t exactly short of choice when it comes to desktop environments, but how many of you have tried more than a couple? 22:51 0 ® ‘ Q ^ Itl Apphcadons - mOff r ; ^ , & 1 FErefoM web Browser | 1 ^ • B Tenmul O Fites & Folders thunderbird IMaU Mo¥kt tcHt Editor copswrappHiMKZfiOC mfe2iodpr-ijo.z-iJi3E: cueH.waoo#rMFC2ioc mrcziDdpi^ij0.2'i.iJ« 18 I Linux Made Simple Sound A once thorny subject. T he Linux sound system has been through many changes. We had OSS (Open Sound System) for years, before ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) came along. ALSA is still with us, but we also have PulseAudio and Jack now. ALSA supports multiple sound cards, each of which may have multiple inputs and outputs. It also provides support for hardware mixing, where the hardware supports it, and software mixing where it does not. This removes the need for sound managers, as provided by KDE and Gnome in the past, to enable more than one application to play sound at the same time. ALSA works at a low level, close to the hardware, so it gives low latency. Most hardware is directly supported now, and installing a distro should result in sound working from the first boot. ALSA is a combination of kernel code and user-space applications. It also provides an API so that other programs can control it directly, like the mixer control panels included with desktop environments. PulseAudio performance PulseAudio is a newer audio framework, but it is not a replacement for ALSA. Instead, it sits on top of the kernel audio system, providing a greater amount of control. It works as a server, accepting input from sources and forwarding it to sinks (output hardware or capture software). In many cases, the sink is ALSA, and the source can be an ALSA driver, too, for applications that don’t directly support PulseAudio. Hence you can end up with an application sending output to an ALSA device, which intercepts the stream and routes it through PulseAudio back to ALSA. It is no surprise that many found PulseAudio complex. A good setup should render all of this chicanery transparent to the user, which is where we are now with distro installers and PulseAudio, so most of the time we are back at the ‘just works’ situation of ALSA, but with better support for multiple devices. ALSA supports multiple output devices, but the default is a global setting. PulseAudio allows you to direct music through speakers while using a Bluetooth headset for VOIP calls. It also allows for less complex but equally useful separation, such as separate volume settings for each application. PulseAudio is network- aware - it can be used to find other PulseAudio servers and play audio through their speakers - great for streaming music around the house. JACK (Jack Audio Connection Kit) is a sound server designed for professional audio applications. Its forte is providing low-latency real-time connections between applications, for audio and MIDI data. It is not needed for typical desktop use, only for budding musicians. > If anyone tries to tell you that PulseAudio is complicated, it’s best not to argue with them. Not that the complexity of this layout matters too much if it just works for you. Printing CUPS and drivers. W hile open source encourages choice, and therefore several programs that do the same thing but in slightly different ways, there are some areas where one program is virtually unchallenged. X.org \\s used universally to provide graphical displays, and CUPS maintains a similar position in the printing arena. If you have a printer attached to your Linux box, you need two things - CUPS and drivers for your printer. In many cases, these come together. CUPS is a server that sits in the background waiting for print requests. Just about any program that prints knows about the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) that CUPS speaks. Hit ‘Print’ in your word processor or browser, and a window pops up showing your printer, and giving a choice if you have more than one. The application only needs to send the data to be printed, usually as PostScript, to CUPS, which takes care of everything else - including waiting for you to remember to switch the printer on. CUPS does not even need to be running on the same computer: it is a networked service and a printer on one computer should be available to everyone on the same network. CUPS is useless without drivers that tell it how to speak to the printer. It includes a large number of drivers by default, and many more are available by installing the gutenprint driver package (so many that your distro may well have installed this by default). HP also provides a driver (and scanner) driver package called hplip, which you need if you use its products. However, some printer companies insist on providing their own drivers instead of having them bundled with CUPS, usually for licensing reasons. In that case, you have the choice of trawling the printer manufacturer’s website for a driver package suitable for your system and installing it separately. After that, the drivers should appear in CUPS and your distro’s printer configuration tool. The other choice is to check with linuxprinting.org before buying a printer, and stick to the more enlightened manufacturers. > Taking care of printers with CUPS is as easy as following a few links in a browser, thanks to its built-in web interface.

We’ll help you get started so you can join the growing ranks of Linux users and get a better PC to boot. T here’s never been a better time to get into Linux. It’s slicker than ever, easier to install than ever and all the big-name distros like Ubuntu have just received updates. One of the biggest impediments to “To top it all, you can do everything you can on a Windows box.” widespread Linux adoption is that you don’t get Linux on a PC from Currys. But the advantages it offers over other mainstream OSes are well worth this extra step. For starters, Linux is open source, which is to say that you can legally download a copy of Linux and install it on all your computers. It also ships with a ton of software and you can download more with a single click. Unlike proprietary OSes, a Linux flavour (or distro) is very malleable. You can swap out default apps or even its entire interface and replace it with something you choose. Choice is another hallmark of Linux with multiple options from simple components to complex suites. Furthermore, besides being compatible with all your newer hardware, Linux can also turbocharge hardware that’s past its glory days. To top it all, you can do everything you can on a Windows box. From streaming video to playing the latest games, Linux will work just as well as any other system. Ubuntu The most commonly known Linux * distribution (often abbreviated to distro), Ubuntu pays special attention to desktop usability. In the 10 years of its existence, Ubuntu has galvanised the development of Linux on the desktop and is the go-to distro for third-party developers and vendors who want to run their wares on Linux. / Fedora Red Hat’s open source offering to the world, Fedora is known for adapting and offering new technologies and software to its users. Over the years, the distro has managed to find a clever balance between offering new features and stability to its users, which makes it popular with both new and experienced Linux campaigners. Mageia Although it’s just had four releases to date, Mageia has a pedigree in usability that dates back to the 1990s. Mageia is a community project that’s supported by a non-profit organisation, which is managed by a board of elected contributors. The distro is known for its customised user-friendly tools for managing the installation.

Install Linux All you need to know to anchor Linux on your computer. T he Linux installation process is involved but it isn’t actually that cumbersome. The exact installation steps are slightly different for every distribution, but in general the distro’s graphical installer will guide you through the necessary steps pretty easily. In essence, installing Linux is very similar to installing a piece of software, albeit with a few caveats: » Disk partitioning Unlike a piece of software, installing Linux requires you to create a dedicated partition on your hard disk. This isn’t an issue if Linux will be the only OS on this computer. However, if you’re installing Linux alongside another OS, such as Windows, you’ll have to take steps to preserve the existing data. Many Linux distros will offer to partition the disk for you automatically, though you can create partitions yourself with ease from within Windows using the Disk Management tool (see Make Room for Linux, below). The advantage of manually partitioning your disk is that you get to decide how much space to allocate to Linux. When creating partitions remember to create two new partitions. The bigger one with at least 12GB of disk space is for the OS itself, which you’ll format as ext4. You’ll also need to create a second partition for what’s called swap space. In simple terms, the swap partition extends the amount of physical RAM on your computer. A general rule of thumb for computers with a small amount of RAM (one or two gigabytes) is to create a swap partition that’s twice as large as the amount of RAM on your computer. For computers with more RAM, it’s best to create a swap partition that’s the same size as the amount of RAM you have. Securing data During the installation process, many distros including Fedora and Ubuntu will give you an option to encrypt the Linux partition. This option gives you an added layer of security by insulating your data from unauthorised access. To enable this option you will need to supply a passphrase which will then act as the key to unlock the data. Another important step during installation is setting up a root account. On most distros this step is part of the user creation process where you define the login credentials of your regular user account. The regular user doesn’t have any permissions to modify the system while logging in as root gives you complete control over your system. Dual boot One software you should be familiar with when installing Linux is the bootloader. It’s a small program that tells the computer where to find the different OSes on the disk. Most Linux distros use the Grub 2 bootloader. In general, you shouldn’t have to do anything here, even when installing Linux on a Windows 8 computer that uses the UEFI BIOS with Secure Boot enabled. The latest versions of most mainstream distros, including Ubuntu and Fedora install a UEFI-compatible bootloader that will work correctly out of the box. However, since different vendors implemented UEFI differently, you might not get to the Grub bootloader screen and instead end up booting straight into Windows after installing Linux. In such a case, you should consider enabling the Legacy BIOS mode wherein the UEFI firmware functions as a standard BIOS. The option to enable Legacy BIOS is under the UEFI settings screen. 3^ Testing before installation Almost every mainstream distro, including Ubuntu, Fedora and Mageia allow you to boot into a ‘live’ environment, which lets you experience the distro without disturbing the contents of your hard disk. You can use the live environment to get familiar with the distro and also verify the compatibility of your hardware with the distro. Also note that Linux distributions are distributed as ISO images. You can burn them to a CD or DVD, depending on their size, using the option to burn ISO images. You can also transfer ISO images to a USB drive. There are tools, such as UNetbootin ar\\6 VL/m/that will create bootable USB drives with the ISO of your distro, while Mageia recommends using the Ru/l/s utility. Make room for Linux: Resize a Windows partition 0 Shrink Windows Before you can partition your disk you’ll need to squeeze your Windows partition to free up some disk space for the new partition. Head to the Disk Management tool, and right-click your main partition that is typically assigned the drive letter C. Then select the Shrink Volume option from the pop-up menu. 0 Create new partition The Shrink dialog box shows you the total size of the drive and the maximum amount of shrink space available. You cannot squeeze more space out of a drive than the size shown here. To create a new partition, specify the size of the partition in the space provided in MB and click Shrink to start the process. ' ■ V- >■- »- ■ 1 t D 'l B pV » 1 — • l'■^» I'l^ n HIBBB 0 Use the partition After the process is complete, a new partition showing the amount of free, or unallocated, space appears next to the Windows C: drive partition. You can then point your Linux distro’s installer to this free space. Remember to repeat the process and create another partition for the swap space as well. Linux Made Simple | 23 Get started Get into Linux Get started Get into Linux Distro differences Taking baby steps with Linux. » > Users of Gnome-based distros should use the Gnome Tweak Tool to tweak the behaviour of their desktop. O ne of the biggest difference that foxes users coming from proprietary OSes is the lack of a consistent ‘look and feel’ to the Linux desktop. The default desktops on Ubuntu, Fedora and Mageia distros all look and behave differently from each other. We say default because unlike other proprietary OSes, a Linux distro enables you to swap out the desktop and replace it with an entirely different one to better suit your workflow. The idea of the desktop as a separate entity from the operating system sounds foreign to users coming from Windows or Mac. But like all things Linux and open source, users are spoilt for choice when it comes to putting a face on top of their Linux distro. Unity in diversity The Ubuntu distribution uses its own home-brewed Unity desktop. The most prominent component on the desktop is the vertical Launcher which functions pretty much like a taskbar. It houses icons for the frequently used apps for quick access that you can modify as per your requirements. Also, some icons have specialised right-click context menus that give you quick access to frequently used features. The first icon on the Launcher brings up the Dash, which is Ubuntu’s take on the traditional menu-based navigation system. It features a search box at the bottom and anything you type here is used to look for matching apps, documents, music, videos, instant messages, contacts and other content. Furthermore, you can also use the Dash to install and uninstall apps and preview media files. Unity also includes the Heads Up Display (HUD), which is an innovative take on the application menus. Using HUD helps you avoid the trouble of looking for options embedded deep within nested menus. To access HUD press the Alt key from inside any app and use the Dash-like search box to perform a task. The default Unity experience is the result of extensive usability research by Canonical. But you’ll find some options to tweak the desktop from under the System Settings tool accessible via the gear & spanner icon in the Launcher. The settings are grouped into three broad categories. The Personal group houses settings for customising the look and feel of the desktop by changing the wallpaper and modifying the behaviour of the launcher. Pay attention to the Online Accounts settings which you can use to sign into several online services, such as Facebook and Google Docs, and integrate their contents with the desktop apps. For example, adding your Flickr account will integrate it with the Shotwell photo manager. Gnome thyself Gnome is another popular desktop, and the Gnome 3 desktop contains more or less the same elements as Ubuntu’s Unity but presents them in a different way. For starters the desktop is very bare. Click on the Activities button in the top-left corner to reveal the Overview which is very similar to Unity’s Dash. In this view, you also get a Launcher- like Favourites bar for accessing frequently used apps. In the centre you get a preview of all open windows. To the right is the Workspace Switcher, which always shows the current Workspace and an additional one. If you add windows Resuscitate an old workhorse One Linux speciality is infusing life into machines doubling up as paperweights because they can’t keep up with the hardware demands of modern OSes. While there are many distros that are designed to power older hardware, our all-time favourite is Puppy Linux. The distro uses one of the lightest window managers (JWM) and though it might not be pretty to look at, it’ll turn that old lethargic work horse into a galloping stallion. But the main reason for Puppy’s stellar performance on hardware with limited resources is its sheer number of lightweight custom apps. The distro has graphics apps, productivity apps. apps to playback, edit and even create multimedia. Using its custom apps, you can block website ads, grab podcasts, do internet telephony, burn optical media, and a lot more. The distro is available in different flavours. The Wary Puppy edition uses an older kernel and includes additional drivers to support peripherals like dial-up modems. There are flavours based on the recent Ubuntu releases too, such as Tahrpup based on Ubuntu 14.04 and Slacko Puppy based on Slackware Linux. These editions use a newer kernel than Wary but take advantage of Puppy’s custom apps for limited resources. > Puppy Linux has very helpful forum boards and loads of documentation written specifically for new users. y 24 I Linux Made Simple to the second Workspace, a third will automatically be added. At the top is a search box that will match any text to apps and documents on the local computer as well as online services. Gnome includes an Online Accounts app that enables you to sign into online services, such as Google Docs and Flickr. In fact, Fedora will ask you to sign into these online services when you boot into the distro for the first time. The Gnome desktop also has several custom apps of its own that can fetch information and data from the added online accounts. For example, the Gnome Contacts apps can pull in contacts from various online sources, such as Gmail. Similarly, Gnome Documents w\\\\\\ help you find documents from online repositories such as Google Docs. New users should also keep an eye out for the desktop’s peculiarities. For one, you won’t find the Minimise buttons on any of the windows in Gnome. When you want to switch to another app, head to the Activities Overview and launch a new window or select an existing open one. Another esoteric aspect is the lack of any desktop icons as well as the ability to create any shortcuts or place any folders on the desktop. However, Gnome’s redeeming aspect is its tweakability: you can add new features literally with a single click. Gnome supports a plethora of extensions that you can enable without any installation. Just head to the Gnome Extensions website (http://extensions.gnome.org), find the plugin you wish to enable and toggle the button to activate it on your desktop. Some of the popular extensions are designed to help ease the transition for users moving to Gnome from proprietary operating systems, such as Windows. Kick off with KDE Unlike the other two desktops, the layout and behaviour of the KDE desktop and the placement of its Kickoff app launcher will certainly feel familiar to users from non-Linux operating systems. But KDE is so malleable that many KDE distros look unlike each other. In many ways, KDE is the quintessential Linux desktop with its flexibility and myriad number of options. There’s literally no end to KDE’s customisation options. One of the most useful KDE features is Activities. Using this feature, you can create several context-aware activities, each with its own set of apps and desktop furniture. For example, you can create a Social activity that signs you into all your instant messaging accounts and displays updates and feeds from various social networks. Many KDE distros ship with just the default activity, called the Desktop Activity. However, you can fetch more activities from the internet and build on them to suit your workflow. Furthermore, KDE ships with multiple interfaces or Views designed to make the best of the available desktop real- estate. There are different Views for regular screens and netbook though you can use any View on any type of computer. To switch Views, right-click on the desktop and from the context-menu select the Default Desktop Settings option. In the window that opens up, select the View tab and checkout the different views from the Layout pull-down list. Many KDE distros place the Folder View widget on the desktop which displays the contents of a folder in a neat little box that you can place anywhere on your screen. Then there’s the Folder View which lets you place files and folders anywhere on the desktop. The Search and launch View is designed for devices with a small screen or a touchscreen. Each View has additional configurable elements. In addition to bundling the configuration options along with the individual elements, KDE also houses them all under the System Settings panel, alongside other system-wide configuration options to administer the underlying Linux distro. It might seem daunting, but you don’t need to set up or review each and every option before using the desktop. Gustomising KDE is an on-going process and not a one-time “Ubuntu, Fedora and Mageia are ^ available in multiple editions ' with a different desktops.” affair. The desktop is designed to grow and mutate as per your usage requirements. 31 flavours In addition to these three chief desktop environments, there are a lot more that you can put atop your distro. There are fully fledged environments, such as Ginnamon, as well as lightweight ones, such as Xfce, LXDE and Mate. In fact, most mainstream distros, including Ubuntu, Fedora and Mageia are available in multiple editions with a different desktops. For example, the Ubuntu distro has a number of officially supported spins. There’s Kubuntu which dresses Ubuntu with KDE as well as a Gnome spin, a Xfce spin and another that uses the Mate desktop. The Fedora distro, which was once known as the premier Gnome distro, now also has a wonderful KDE flavour as well. Similarly, you can also use Mageia with the Gnome desktop as well. In fact, Mageia and Fedora, also have install-only DVD images that give the user the option to install multiple desktops. » Switch desktop environments You can also install multiple desktops on top of your distribution, such as the popular Cinnamon desktop. It’s available in the official repositories of Fedora and Mageia and you can install it via their respective graphical package managers. On Ubuntu, it’s available via the ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon- stable PPA. Add this PPA to your system [as explained in the main text] and then install the desktop environment from the Software Center. Once you’ve installed multiple desktop environments you can easily switch to another one. To do this you just log out of the current desktop environment, and use the login manager and enter your login credentials. Before logging into the desktop, explore the buttons on the login manager. One of the buttons will reveal a drop-down list of all the installed desktops. Select the desktop environment you want to use and the login manager will log you into that desktop. This way you can try them out and choose one you like the best. Choice! > There are several desktop environments that you can install using your distro’s package manager. Linux Made Simple | 25 Get started Get into Linux Get started Get into Linux Install and manage apps Fleshing out your chosen distribution. » ■ ■ nlike Windows, a typical Linux desktop distribution I I is more ready-to-use right out of the box. Instead of shipping with basic apps, such as a vanilla text editor or a barebones drawing tool, your average Linux distro will include a fully fledged office suite and a comprehensive graphics editor. This is in addition to the basic set of apps for common tasks, such as browsing the Internet, checking email, instant messaging with your friends across various networks, organising photos, listening to music and watching videos. That said, since we all use our computers differently, you’ll likely want a piece of software that isn’t included by default. Your distro has specialised tools that’ll help you install gazillions of quality open source software without clicking through complex setup wizards. Linux distros use a collection of software tools, both graphical and command-line based, that are together referred to as a package management system. These tools help you install, remove, and upgrade software (also called packages) with ease. Individual pieces of software are grouped inside packages. In addition to the software itself, packages also include other information, such as a list of other packages or dependencies which are required for the app to function properly. Furthermore, the package management system relies on a database known as the repository to keep track of all the available packages. Package Management 101 The Linux world is divided broadly into two different package formats - RPM and Deb. These are precompiled binary packages that are designed to simplify the installation process for desktop users. RPM was created by Red Hat Linux, and is used by distros such as Fedora, and Mageia while Deb is used on Debian-based systems, such as Ubuntu. Additionally, almost every major distro maintains its own set of graphical tools to enable desktop users to install, upgrade and remove app. You must also be familiar with the distro ’s repository structure and how and where it houses software. Ubuntu uses the Advanced Packaging Tool or APT package > In addition to enabling repositories you can also select a different mirror for downloading software. management system. You can use the Software & Updates tool for manipulating Ubuntu’s repositories (or repos). The tool lists repos in four different tabs. By default, the four official repos under the Ubuntu Software tab are enabled. The Main repo includes officially supported software, and the Restricted repo includes software that isn’t available under a completely free license. The two interesting repos are Universe and Multiverse repos, which include software maintained by the community and software that isn’t free, respectively. Unlike Ubuntu the Fedora distro uses the RPM package management system. The distro houses repositories under the /etc/yum.repos.d directory and the main repository is named fedora. repo. Mageia uses the urpmi package which is a wrapper for the RPM package management system. The distro has three official repos. The core repository contains open source packages, the non-free repository contains closed-source apps, and the tainted repository has packages that might infringe on patents and copyright laws in some countries. Each of these repos is further divided into four sub-repos. The release repo includes stable packages, the updates repo includes packages that have been updated since the release. A backup primer Your distribution will include a tool to help you backup your data and you should take some time out to get familiar with it. Ubuntu, for instance, ships with the Deja Dup backup app which is designed for new users. You can also install it on top of Fedora and Mageia. No matter what backup tool you use, you should take a moment to consider what you should backup and where. Backing up the entire home directory might be convenient but is usually just an overkill. Instead you should just include the directories under your home directory such as Downloads and Documents. Also check with important app, such as email clients, who keep downloaded emails, attachments and address books under hidden directories (prefixed with a ./) beneath the home folder. Also, keeping the backed up data on another partition of the same disk isn’t going to be of much use, since the whole disk might fail and render the backup copy useless. One solution is to keep the backup on another separate disk or external drive. Or, if you have good Internet bandwidth, the backup app might also help you store the backups on a cloud storage service. > Deja Dup has a simple interface that shouldn’t intimidate even first time users. . ^ 26 I Linux Made Simple and the backports repo contains packages of new versions backported from the Cauldron repository, which will eventually become the stable repo for the next release. There’s also the testing repo which will contain software primary for QA purposes. To configure repos, launch the Mageia Control Center ar\\6 head to Software management > Configure media sources for install and update. To install the official online repositories, click on Add and then either on Update sources only or Full set of sources. The first choice is the minimum to keep the distro updated, while the second allows you to install new software. These options will populate the window with a list of repos. Then toggle the Enabled checkbox next to the repo you want to fetch software from. FedEx packages All major desktop distros include a graphical tool for managing packages. Ubuntu’s Software Center \\s one of the best tools for the job. You can find software by clicking on the category reflecting the type of software that you’re looking for. When you select a category, you will be shown a list of apps. There’s also a search box in the upper-right corner of the window which will look for software matching any entered keywords. Once you’ve found the software you want, click the Install button to its right. This will fetch the software as well as any required dependencies and automatically install it. All newly installed software is added to the Launcher and you can also find it from under the Dash. Fedora uses the PackageKit graphical tool that’s listed as Software in the Gnome’s Activities menu. It too lists software categories as well as a keyword-matching search box at the top to help you find software. Once you’ve found the software that you’re looking for, click on the Install button and the app will add it to your installation. The graphical package management tool for Mageia is named Drakrpm. The tool isn’t as pretty as the software centres in Ubuntu and Fedora, but is very functional and intuitive enough to get the job done. You can filter its list of available apps to show only packages with GUI, security updates, bug fix updates, and more. Applications groups are listed in the sidebar and there’s also a search box to hunt for packages based on keywords. When you find a package you wish to install, simply toggle its corresponding checkbox and click on Apply. The Repo men The larger open source community offers a lot more packages than the ones listed in your distro’s official repos tt, ■tiifjilnl 'J^iilirn 1^ E 9 - * - * - - - r U n UtwCmH EvTHfN & a Wm\\*i Vi m EMi% ik Tuu and almost every distro has a mechanism to add and install software from these third-party repos. External repos in Ubuntu are known as a Personal Package Archive or PPA. You can add a PPA repo to your distro using the Software & Updates tool. But first you need the address of the PPA. This is listed on the PPAs Launchpad site and will be something like ppa:example-ppa/example. Now fire up the tool and switch to the Other Software tab. Then click on the Add button and paste the address of the PPA in the window that opens. Ubuntu will then ask you to refresh the repos to enable the PPA. “Unlike Windows, a typical ^ Linux desktop distro is ready- to-use right out of the box.” Similarly, Mageia has a number of third-party repos as well and you’ll need their URL to add them to your distro. Once you have the URL, fire up the Mageia Control Center and head to Software management > Oonfigure media sources for install and update and click on the Add a medium option. Enter the address of the repo in the window that pops up along with its type such as HTTP or FTP. Fedora also has a number of third-party software repos but the most popular is RPMFusion. The repo is further sub- divided into two independent repos that house free and non- free software. You can install both of these repos from within the browser itself by following the instructions on the repos website (www.rpmfusion.org/configuration). » > Most desktop distros have an easy to use graphical package manager. Grabbing Google All popular Google software, such as Chrome, Earth, the audio and video plugin for Hangouts and others can be installed on Linux. But you won’t find them in the official repos of major distros because of their licensing. However, you now have all the know-how to install them with ease if we point you in the right direction. The downloads page of each supported Google app contains links to both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the software in both RPM and Deb formats. Download the package for your particular distro and double-click on the file to install it with the distro’s package manager. All official packages for Google apps will also install the appropriate external Google repository in your distribution to keep the software updated. Another popular proprietary software that you may want to install is Skype. Ubuntu users can simply enable Partner Repositories by visiting Software & Updates > Other Software. This will add the official Skype repos and you can then install the software from the Software Center as for any other software package. Mageia, on the other hand, includes the Skype package in its non-free repo. If you’ve enabled this repo, then simply search for the get-skype package which will download S/cypefrom its website. You can also head to the Linux download page on Skype's website and choose your distro and architecture from the pull-down list which will download either a Deb file or an RPM file. Double-click on the file to install it with the distro’s package manager. Linux Made Simple | 27 Get started Get into Linux Get started Get into Linux Play multimedia Turn your distro into the ultimate media centre. » A Linux distros designed for desktop users are capable of handling all types of content you I W I throw at them. But some content, especially most audio and video, is distributed in closed formats that are encumbered by patents. The distros can’t play these files straight out of the box, however, most have clearly outlined procedures to allow users to install components to play these popular non-free media formats. Ubuntu gives you the option to install the components that can play files in restricted formats, such as MP3s, during the installation itself. If you’ve already installed the distro, you should then use the package manager to install the ubuntu- restricted-extras package, which includes popular proprietary codecs and plugins. On Fedora these codecs are bundled in the third-party RPM Fusion repository. You’ll have to first enable the repo as mentioned earlier and then fire up a terminal and enter the following commands to fetch the codecs: su - yum install gstreamer{l,}-{plugin-crystalhd,ffmpeg,plugins- {good, ugly, bad{, -free, -nonfree,-freeworld,-extras}{-extras}}} ffmpeg libmpgl23 lame-libs If you’re using Mageia, you’ll find the multimedia codecs under the Tainted repository, so make sure you enable it following the procedure mentioned earlier. Then launch the Welcome app from under the Tools menu and switch to the Applications tabs. From here you can install several useful and popular packages including multimedia codecs. > Mageia’s Welcome app is a wonderful utility to setup the distro for all kinds of users. Where’s the bling? Despite the rise of the open source WebM format, many websites still require Adobe’s Flash plugin to properly stream multimedia content. Getting the Flash plugin on Linux is tricky since Adobe is no longer developing Flash for Firefox on Linux. The only way to use the latest Adobe Flash plugin on Linux is to use Google’s Chrome browser which includes the Pepper-based Flash plug-in. That said, if you don’t want to switch to Chrome you can > You can tweak Linux’s Grub bootloader with the Grub- Customizer tool (ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer). still install the out-of-date Flash plugin and continue using the F/re/bx browser. Or, you can extract the newer Pepper-based Flash plugin from the Chrome browser and use it on Chrome's open source cousin, the Chromium browser. Ubuntu users can install Flash for F/re/bxwith the sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer command. If you’re using Chromium, you can use the latest Pepper Flash plugin by installing the pepperflashplugin- nonfree package. Fedora users can download the F/re/bx plugin from Adobe’s website by adding its repo. If you are running a 64-bit installation, this command: yum -y install http://linuxdownload.adobe.com/adobe- release/adobe-release-x86_64- 1.0-1 .noarch.ipm will download and install the correct repo. You can then import the key for the repo with: rpm -import /etc/pki/ipm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-adobe-linux before installing the plugin with: yum -y install flash-plugin Mageia users can simply enable the nonfree repository which houses the Flash plugin and then install it from the Applications tab in the l/l/e/comeapp. Best multimedia apps Most distros ship with audio and video players. The popular ones are Rhythmbox which is the default on Gnome-based distros and is well integrated in Ubuntu, and KDE’s default Amarok. In addition to local tracks, both players can also stream Internet radio and podcasts. If you want more attractive looking players, fire up the package manager and look for Banshee anb Clementine. Similarly, the default video player on most Gnome-based distros is Totem (now simply called Videos). If you want something with more feature you can grab MPlayer. This is essentially a command-line media player but it has a number of frontends. Gnome users can use Gnome-Mplayer and KDE users can use KMPlayer. There’s also the popular cross- platform VLC that can handle pretty much any file format. 28 I Linux Made Simple Play games Full steam ahead. G aming has long been considered Linux’s Achilles’s heel. Over the years we’ve had several quality open source games, but they’ve lacked the mass-appeal of popular gaming titles available on proprietary desktops. All that changed in early 2013 with Valve’s announcement of Steam for Linux cWeni for its hugely popular game distribution service. You can install the proprietary client in your distro with ease. Ubuntu users should enable the Partner repo and then install the client from the Software Center. Fedora users should install the RPM Fusion repos and then install Steam using the package manager. Similarly, Mageia users should enable the non-free repo and then use the Mageia Welcome app to install the Steam client. But before you fire up the Steam client make sure you’ve got the proper drivers for your graphics hardware. This tends to be the major sticking point for users, as card manufacturers restrict distribution of their closed-source driver elements. Start by getting details about the make and model of your graphics card using the Ispci I grep VGA command. You can get more details, such as its clock speed and capabilities, with: sudo Ishw -C video Your distro will ensure you are using the most suitable open source driver as soon as you boot into the distro. The Oibaf PPA (ppa:oibaf/graphics-drivers) is popular with Ubuntu users for getting the latest bleeding edge open source drivers. However, users of Nvidia and ATI/AMD hardware should use proprietary drivers from the respective vendor for the best gaming performance. Ubuntu users should use the X-Swat PPA (ppa:ubuntu-x- swat/x- updates) for the latest stable Nvidia drivers. Once enabled fetch the drivers with: sudo apt-get install nvidia-current Fedora users will find the latest GeForce drivers in the RPM Fusion repo. After adding the repo, install the driver with User admin basics yum install kmod-nvidia xorg-xll-drv-nvidia-libs kemel- devel acpid Mageia users should first enable the non-free repo and then launch the Mageia Control Center and head to Hardware > Set up the graphical server. In the window that open click on the toggle next to the Graphic Card label which will display a list of graphics card. Browse the list and select yours. If Mageia has a proprietary driver for the card, it’ll install it. Mageia’s list also includes AMD cards, but if you are using Ubuntu or Fedora, the best source for the proprietary driver is AMD’s website (http://support.anid.com/en-us/ download). This page has several dropdown menus that you can use to pinpoint the exact driver for your graphics card. Then download the suggested driver and extract it to reveal a .run script. Before you install the driver make sure you install its dependencies with: sudo apt-get install dh-make dh-modaliases execstack Iibc6-i386 lib32gccl Cnee that’s done, you can execute the script with: sh ./amd-driver-installer-13.35. 1005-x86.x86_64.run This will launch the graphical AMD Catalyst proprietary driver installer and will also install the Catalyst Control Center GPU management software. When the installer has finished, head back to the terminal and enter /usr/bin/aticonfig -initial to configure the driver. > While distros do come with open source games in their repros, Steam offers access to AAA gaming titles like Dying Light. When Linux is installed, it’s automatically configured for use by a single user, but you can easily add separate user accounts. The superuser, root, has complete access to the CS and its configuration: it’s intended for administrative use only. Unprivileged users can use the su and sudo programs for controlled privilege escalation. Users are grouped together into a group, and inherit the group’s access privileges. Every Linux user is a member of at least one group. Now, you can control which files and folders are accessible by a user or a group. By default, a user’s files are only accessible by that user, and system files are only accessible by the root user. In Linux files and folders can be set up so that only specific users can view, modify, or run them. This allows you, for instance, to share a file with other users so they can read the file but not make any changes. Access to files is controlled via a system of ownership permissions. You can use the Is -I to list the permissions. When used without specifying a filename it will list the permissions of all files within the directory. The different characters in the output represent a file’s read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions for the owner, group, and all other users. You can alter the permissions of files and folders with the chmod command or graphically from the file manager. > The file manager of almost every distro allows you to tweak the group associated with a file or folder.

Macs are shiny and expensive, so why buy one when you can keep your existing PC and move to Linux? Gone are the days when Linux meant immersing yourself in command-line chicanery - we’ll show you how you can install a user- friendly flavour of Linux alongside your existing Windows installation without losing any data, so you can dip your toes into the free and open waters of Linux. To make the transition as smooth as possible, we’ve chosen Ubuntu 14.04 ITS (on the cover disc) as our Linux distro of choice. Ubuntu is one of the most user- friendly Linux distros out there, and 14.04 LTS has just been released. LTS stands for Long Term Support, which means it gets five years of updates and support. Here’s what you’re going to do. Firstly, we would be remiss if we didn’t instruct you about how to back up your current PC. You have two basic choices here: the back- up tools which are built into Windows itself, or SystemRescueCD, which you’ll find as part of the cover disc. Next, we’ll explain how modern PCs ship with a new system called the UEFI, which may cause minor problems. But don’t worry, because we’ll show you how to overcome any issues if they arise. Finally, we’ll step you through the installation process itself, which is a piece of cake. And we won’t leave you hanging - once you’ve booted into Ubuntu for the first time, we’ll take you on a tour of the new desktop, reveal how to access existing documents and other files, and show you how to get to grips with your brand new operating system. There’s never been a better time to make the life- changing switch to Linux, so grab our hand and take the plunge. “Microsoft has finally lost the plot - now is the perfect time to switch to a better OS” Linux Made Simple | 31 Get started Escape Windows YOUR COMPLETE GUIDE TO USING WINDOWS! be best eaide money cm bi^t OUT NOW!

Stick with us - before migrating to Linux, make a fail-safe backup. T he simplest way to back up your system is to use the built-in Windows Backup tool in Windows 7 or later - select ‘System Image Backup’ and follow the prompts. It’s not very exciting and it’s a little scary, but it is essential. For a pure Linux back-up solution, use System RescueCD, which is on the cover disc. Here’s how... Reboot your PC with the disc in your drive, access the boot menu if necessary (usually [Fll]) and choose your DVD drive, then ‘SystemRescueCD’. Problems booting could be caused by your PC’s UEFI (see over the page to fix them). Otherwise, pick the default boot options entry. Type uk when prompted for the keyboard layout, and type startx at the final command prompt to access the graphical environment. Once this loads, click the ‘Menu’ button in the bottom-left and select ‘System > Show Filesystems’ to identify each partition. The Disk entries identify each physical drive (sda, sdb and so on) and the Device identifies the partitions. In most cases, sda will be your Windows drive, so you'll need to back up sdal (a small boot partition) and sda2 (the actual Windows partition). You’ll also need to note the partition you intend to back up to and make sure it has enough free space. Now switch to the terminal window. To mount the back-up partition, type the following command, changing ntfs to FAT if your back-up drive is FAT32, and replacing sdc2 with the drive’s actual partition name: Mount -t ntfs /dev/sdc2 /mnt/backup Now re-open the menu and select ‘System > Partimage’. This tool lets you back up partitions, so start with /dev/sdal, then press [Tab]. Next, type /mnt/backup/sdal-backup.gz into the ‘Image file to create/use’ box. Leave ‘Save partition into a new image file’ selected and press [F5]. Verify ‘Gzip’ is selected under ‘Compression level’, then click [F5] again. Enter a description if you wish, then press [Tab] to select ‘OK’ and hit [Enter]. Make a note about experimental NTFS support, then click ‘OK’ twice, noting the drive statistics. If this successfully completes, repeat to back up your Windows partition, naming it sda2-backup.gz instead. To back up your computer's Master Boot Record, open a terminal window and type the following commands cd mnt/backup mkdir partition-backup cd partition-backup dd if=/dev/sda of=backup-sda.mbr count=l bs=512 to back up MBR. Now back up your partition table with: sfdisk -d /dev/sda > backup-sda.sf If you get a warning about sfdisk not supporting CRT partitions, type sgdisk \"backup=backup-sda.sg /dev/sda instead. If disaster strikes, either boot from your Windows rescue disc and follow the prompts, or boot back into SystemRescueCD. If you got as far as Ubuntu resizing your Windows partitions, you’ll first need to launch the Gparted partitioning tool from its Taskbar shortcut. It should display your main hard drive (/dev/sda), so identify the extended partition. Right-click each volume inside it and choose ‘Delete’, then right-click the extended partition and delete that too. Next, right-click your Windows partition and choose ‘Resize/ Move’. Allocate it all available space, click ‘Resize/Move’ then ‘Apply’. To complete the partition restore process, follow the step-by-step guide (below). The final step is restoring the MBR. Open another terminal window and type: cd /mnt/backup/partition-backup dd if=backup-sda.mbr of=/dev/sda If you backed up your partition using sfdisk, type sfdisk / dev/sda < backup-sda.sf into the command prompt; if you used sgdisk, type sgdisk \"load-backup=backup-sda.sg / dev/sda instead to complete the restore. 31 Restore your original setup D Select backup Boot into SystemRescueCD as before. Follow the steps in the main text (above) up to identifying your partitions. Next, mount the back-up partition in the /mnt/backup directory. Once done, open Partimage. Leave ‘sdal’ selected, type the back-up path and name from before into the ‘Image file’ box. 0 Restore boot partition Press [Tab] twice to highlight the asterisk by ‘Save partition’, then press the down arrow then [Space] to select ‘Restore partition from an image file’. Press [F5]. Note the description and press [Enter] . Press [F5] to restore the partition, working through the warnings until the files are copied back. D Restore main partition Partimage W\\\\\\ close once the partition has been restored, so launch it again but this time select your main Windows partition (typically ‘sda2’). Then it’s a case of repeating the previous steps, only this time using the first back-up file. Note: the restoration relies on your Windows partition being the same size. Linux Made Simple | 33 Get started Escape Windows Get started Escape Windows Handling UEFI & Ubuntu Get your systenn configured correctly, even Windows 8 systems. M odern PCs, particularly those with Windows 8 pre- installed, have replaced the traditional BIOS with a new system called UEFI. Both perform the same job, detecting and initialising your hardware before handing it over to your OS, but UEFI represents a quantum leap forward from the somewhat primitive capabilities of the traditional BIOS. The UEFI offers a much wider range of features than that found in the BIOS, all wrapped up in a much more user-friendly, graphically pleasing interface. There are, however, potential issues to circumvent. First, because UEFI is a newer standard, it’s not compatible with legacy hardware. This problem is circumvented by a special Compatibility Support Module (CSM), which enables you to emulate the BIOS to run older hardware and OSes. More controversially, UEFIs also ship with a Secure Boot mode, which, while making POs less susceptible to malware, were used to lock them to Windows 8. Again, this feature can - in most cases - be disabled, but the good news is that Ubuntu 14.04 ITS fully supports newer hardware and Secure Boot, so you won’t need to disable either to install it alongside “Because UEFI is a newer standard, it’s not compatible with legacy hardware” Windows. One UEFI feature you’ll need to disable, however, is FastBoot (also called QuickBoot or FastStartup). Tweak the UEFI Accessing the UEFI is the same as entering the BIOS setup. Switch on your PO, then tap the key prompted to enter setup when it appears on-screen (typically [F2] or [Del]). Verify that FastBoot has been disabled by looking for a section called Windows 8 Oonfiguration, or - if it’s not present - Boot. Once located, make sure it’s switched off or disabled. You may need to tweak the OSM and Secure Boot settings if you intend backing up your system using SystemRescueOD on the cover disc. Again, look in the Windows 8 Oonfiguration, if it exists, for Secure Boot, which may be listed as Windows 8 /ERKH UER I - -■ • > Make sure your FastBoot settings are disabled before attempting to install Ubuntu. Logo Requirement. Either way, disable it if you have problems booting SystemRescueOD. If the section isn’t present, look under Security instead. The OSM module may be part of the Windows 8 Logo Requirement screen, or it’ll be hidden away on its own (we found it buried away at the bottom of the Boot menu on our ASRock motherboard, for instance). Olick this to reveal a selection of different options covering different hardware - look for references to PXE (pre-boot environment), GOP (graphics) and Storage (or SATA), as well as USB and PS2, if applicable. This enables you to selectively switch CSM on and off for specific devices as required. Some motherboards - including our ASRock - enable you to run both modes as required. (In the case of ASRock, we set each one to ‘Do not launch’ to make this setting the norm.) If there’s no apparent options for editing the Secure Boot or CSM settings, contact your PC manufacturer to verify whether or not these can be disabled. In most cases, PCs built using off-the-shelf motherboards should have the required options intact, but some manufacturers have been known to provide hobbled boards. Upgrading a PC’s graphics card often requires enabling CSM support, so even if the controls aren’t already supported, the manufacturer may have relented under Choose the right boot option 1 J Many modern PCs now give you the option of booting either in UEFI or legacy BICS mode, with the latter mode enabling you to install older operating systems. Ubuntu works fine with both UEFI and Legacy modes, but other environments - including SystemRescueOD - require booting from a legacy option. Some PCs even support mixed-mode booting, presenting both legacy and UEFI choices direct from the boot menu, so you don’t need to wade into the UEFI shell to switch between them. If you’ve wondered why some boot options are displayed twice in the boot menu, this is why: look more closely and you’ll see one option is prefixed by UEFI. This gives you the option of choosing which mode to boot that drive in, which is a good way of testing whether or not a certain CS or bootable disc works with UEFI or not. If you’re only offered a single set of boot options, your UEFI shell will only allow you to boot in either UEFI mode or legacy. The latter requires that CSM is enabled, but once done you should be able to change boot settings - including device priority - from within the Boot section of the UEFI shell. If your PC does support mixed-mode booting, you may need to set a different default boot device, in which case take care to select the right mode when choosing which device (typically optical drive or boot hard drive) to make the default. ^ 34 I Linux Made Simple pressure from end users and provided a UEFI update on its website to enable the required options - Advent’s DT2410 PC is an example where this happened.. With your Windows system backed up and the UEFI configured correctly, it’s time to press on and install Ubuntu alongside your existing setup. One of the reasons we’ve chosen Ubuntu is that its user-friendliness is apparent from the moment you install it. The set-up process is painless and relatively straightforward to follow: pop your cover disc into the drive, start your PC and, if necessary, select your optical drive from the boot menu. When the cover disc menu appears, choose the Ubuntu option to begin. Wait for a few minutes, then after a short pause, when the screen goes grey and then red, the Welcome screen will appear. You’ll be given the option of either trying Ubuntu or installing it - select the ‘Install’ option. Next, tick both boxes: ‘Download updates while installing’ and ‘Install this third-party software’. Click ‘Continue’, then wait while the updates are downloaded in the background. Install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS The Installation Type screen should then appear. In most cases, it should seamlessly detect your Windows installation - leave ‘Install Ubuntu alongside...’ and click ‘Continue’. If Windows isn’t offered as an option, this means Ubuntu hasn’t detected it. If you’re running a newer PC with an UEFI installed in place of the traditional BIOS, you’ll need to make sure you boot from the optical disc using the same option that Windows was installed with. Reboot your PC, then choose the alternative optical disc option from the boot menu to see whether Ubuntu now detects your Windows installation. If the option doesn’t appear whether you choose UEFI or the legacy option, it could be down to your partition table containing both MBR and GPT records (see below for the step-by-step guide for a way to resolve this issue). The next screen sees Ubuntu automatically find some free space for itself - either by carving up your current Windows partition, or by locating more space on another attached drive and repartitioning that instead. If you don’t want it installing on a USB drive, power down your PC, disconnect the offending drive, then start again. Ubuntu needs a Check your UEFI shell’s boot settings to see whether Legacy, UEFI or mixed mode is selected. minimum of 6.4GB of free space, but will take up to 40-odd GB if it can. You can alter this figure by clicking and dragging the grey space between both suggested partitions. It’s smart enough to not allow you to swallow up your entire Windows partition, but if you plan to continue using it going forward, try to leave at least 10GB of free space if you can, and preferably more. In most cases, the default choice should be fine anyway, so click ‘Install Now’. Note the comment about partition resizing, and click ‘Continue’. Next you’ll be prompted to choose your region - the installer should automatically detect this - then click ‘Continue’ to select your keyboard layout. In most cases, the default UK keyboard layout is the one to pick, so click ‘Continue’ again. You’ll now be prompted to enter your name. As you enter it, Ubuntu will populate both the computer’s name and username fields based on your choice - you’re free to edit both should you choose. The final choice available to you is to pick a password. Select one that you’ll easily remember, because you’ll need this not just to log into Ubuntu but also to perform administrator-level tasks. Click ‘Continue’ again, and you can sit back and wait for Ubuntu to install itself on your PC - it really is that simple. It’s worth hanging around because the installer will reveal some useful pointers for your first steps into using Ubuntu. But turn the page and we’ll take you on your own personal tour of your shiny, new desktop and operating system. }> Fix Windows detection issues D Launch Ubuntu Live If your Windows install isn’t detected, click ‘Back’ until you return to the Welcome screen. Click ‘Try Ubuntu’ to load the live CD. When it’s loaded, press [Ctrl]-r[Alt]-r[T] to open a terminal window. Type the following command and hit [Enter]: sudo gdisk dev/sda B Verify and fix If gcf/sk says it’s found both an MBR and a GPT, then the presence of GPT is the problem - removing it will enable Ubuntu to see your Windows partition. First, select the GPT entry by typing 2 and hitting [Enter]. When prompted, type x and hit [Enter] to access Expert command mode. S Apply and reboot Type z and hit [Enter]. When prompted to wipe the GPT on /dev/sda, type y and hit [Enter]. When asked if you’d like to blank the MBR, make sure you type n, hit [Enter] and close the terminal, then reboot and try to install Ubuntu again. This time you’ll see the option to install it alongside Windows. Linux Made Simple | 35 Get started Escape Windows Get started with Ubuntu Take your first steps into the Unity desktop. Y ou’ve installed Ubuntu, removed the cover disc and rebooted your PC. The first change you’ll see is the presence of a new boot menu on startup, called GNU Grub (see ‘All about Grub’, pl9). This enables you to choose which OS to boot into, plus gives you access to a memory testing utility. The default choice is Ubuntu, but before booting into it for the first time, we recommend selecting the Windows entry.
