Raspbian comes with over 35,000 packages, or pre-compiled software bundled in a nice format for easy installation on a Raspberry Pi. The initial build was completed in June of 2012, but the distribution continues to be active developed with an emphasis on improving the stability and performance of as many Debian packages as possible. Although Debian produces a distribution for the arm architecture, it is compatible only with versions later than the one used on the Raspberry Pi (ARMv7-A CPUs and higher vs the Raspberry Pi’s ARMv6 CPU).\n\nDistributed as a Raspbian image\n\nThe Raspbian operating system is distributed as a Raspbian image, a binary file that users can download from Softpedia as deploy it onto a SD card, which can be booted on the Raspberry Pi computer. In addition, users can purchase high-quality, branded SDHC cards that contains the latest official stable release of the Raspbian operating system preinstalled on Pi Hut’s Raspberry Pi Store. The distribution is compatible with ARMv6 CPUs and higher\n\nUses the LXDE desktop environment\n\nRaspbian uses LXDE (Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment) for its default graphical session, which looks traditional and comprises of a single taskbar located on the bottom edge of the screen. The taskbar includes several applets that allow you to cycle between virtual workspaces, interact with running programs, access essential system functions, as well as to launch your favorite applications.\n\nWhat News on Raspbian 2022-02-03\n\nNew versions of applications\n\nThere are new versions of many of the standard applications.\n\nSonic Pi is now at version 2.9. A full list of changes can be found in the History section of the Info window in Sonic Pi, but the highlights include two new effects functions, a new logging system, and the inclusion of all of Sam Aaron’s articles for The Magpi magazine as part of the online tutorials.\n\nScratch is now at version 20160115. This has improved sound input capabilities, support for the CamJam EduKit 3 robotics board, basic PWM support in the GPIO server, and various improvements to the display, including font scaling.\n\nMathematica is now at version 10.3. This adds support for a larger set of the functionality detailed in Stephen Wolfram’s new “Elementary Introduction to the Wolfram Language” book. It also supports the use of the Sense HAT, adds interfacing to Arduino, and includes many new Mathematica functions.\n\nNode-RED is now at version 12.5 – this adds no significant new functionality, but fixes a number of bugs and contains some internal performance improvements.\n\nNew versions of libraries\n\nWiringPi has been updated to version 2.31, which allows GPIO pins to be accessed from applications that use the library without needing to use sudo. For more details, see the WiringPi website.\n\nThe RPi.GPIO Python library has been updated to version 0.6.1 which includes some bug fixes which affected the new GPIO Zero library.\n\nThe Java platform included has been updated to version 8, update 65.\n\nRead More release Announce\n\nDownload: 2016-02-03-raspbian-jessie.zip (1,400MB, SHA1, torrent).\n\nNvidia Linux Display Driver 361.28 Released, Install on Ubuntu / Linux Mint\n\nNvidia Linux Display Driver 361.28 Released, now you can Install on Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus, Ubuntu 15.10 Wily Werewolf, Ubuntu 15.04 vivid Vervet, ubuntu 14.10 Utopic Unicorn, Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr (LTS) and Linux Mint 17.1 Rebecca, Linux Mint 17 Qiana via PPA\n\nNvidia Linux Display Driver 64-bit is a proprietary, yet freely distributed OpenGL video driver that aims to offer support for Nvidia graphics cards on any Linux kernel-based operating system. This version has been designed to be installed only computers supporting the 64-bit architecture. For 32-bit support, see this link. It is a native Linux driver that provides users with only a command-line installer, as well as a settings panel. It’s also the number one choice for gaming users.\n\nWhat New in version 361.28 :\n\nAdded support for the following GPU: GeForce 945A\n\nAdded a legacy, non-GLVND libGL.so GLX client library to the NVIDIA Linux driver installer package, and the ability to select between a GLVND or non-GLVND GLX client library at installation time. This allows users to install the legacy non-GLVND GLX client library in order to work around compatibility issues which may arise due to GLX applications which depend upon behaviors of the NVIDIA GLX client driver which are not defined by the Linux OpenGL ABI version 1.0.\n\nBy default, nvidia-installer will install the legacy, non-GLVND GLX client libraries. The –glvnd-glx-client command line option can be used to override the default, and install the GLVND GLX client libraries instead. Please contact the vendors of any applications that are not compatible with GLVND to ensure that their applications be updated for compatibility with GLVND.\n\nThe presence of multiple GLX client libraries in the package has implications for repackagers of the NVIDIA driver; see the libGL.so entry in the “Installed Components” chapter of the README for details.\n\nThe OpenGL Vendor-Neutral Driver (GLVND) infrastructure is now included and supported by the NVIDIA GLX and OpenGL drivers. This should not cause any visible changes in behavior for end users, but some internal driver component libraries have been renamed and/or moved as a result. These changes may affect scripts that rely on the presence of NVIDIA OpenGL driver components other than those specified in the Linux OpenGL ABI version 1.0, maintainers of alternative NVIDIA driver installation packages, and applications which rely on the presence of any non- OpenGL/GLX symbols in the libGL.so.1 library and its dependencies in any way. Please see https://github.com/NVIDIA/libglvnd. For more information on the GLVND project. The Linux OpenGL ABI version 1.0 specification is available at https://www.opengl.org/registry/ABI\n\nUpdated nvidia-installer to run ldconfig(8) and depmod(8) after uninstalling an existing driver, instead of only running these two commands when installing a new driver.\n\nRemoved the VDPAU wrapper and trace libraries libvdpau.so.1 and libvdpau_trace.so.1 from the driver package. These libraries may be available via your distribution’s package management system, or can be compiled from the sources available at http://people.freedesktop.org/~aplattner/vdpau/. Please see http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/VDPAU/ for more information.\n\nFixed a bug in the EGL driver where a mutex was unlocked more than once. This triggers undefined behavior, and in particular, if lock elision is enabled in glibc, may result in a segmentation fault.\n\nHow to Install Nvidia Linux Display Driver 361.28 on Ubuntu / Linux Mint :\n\nTo Install/Update Nvidia Linux Display Driver 361.28 on Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus, Ubuntu 15.10 wily werewolf, Ubuntu 15.04 vivid Vervet, ubuntu 14.10 Utopic Unicorn, Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr (LTS), Ubuntu 13.10/13.04/12.04, Linux Mint 17.1 Rebecca, Linux Mint 17 Qiana, Linux Mint 13 Maya, Pinguy OS 14.04, Elementary OS 0.3 Freya, Elementary OS 0.2 Luna, Peppermint Five, Deepin 2014, LXLE 14.04, Linux Lite 2.0, Linux Lite 2.2 and other Ubuntu derivative systems, open a new Terminal window and bash (get it?) in the following commands:\n\nDownload File Installer 64 bit :\n\nwget http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/361.28/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-361.28.run\n\nSet Permission :\n\nsudo chmod +x NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-361.28.run\n\nInstall :\n\nsudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-361.28.run\n\nDownload File Installer 32 bit :\n\nwget http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/361.28/NVIDIA-Linux-x86-361.28.run\n\nSet Permission :\n\nsudo chmod +x NVIDIA-Linux-x86-361.28.run\n\nInstall :\n\nsudo ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86-361.28.run\n\nWhat Nvidia graphics cards are supported by this driver?\n\nOfficially, the Nvidia Linux Display Driver supports a wide range of Nvidia graphics cards, much more than the open source Nouveau driver supports.
