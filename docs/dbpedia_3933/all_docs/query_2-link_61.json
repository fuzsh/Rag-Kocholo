        "text": "I thought GNU was the (only) supplier of essential tools whose open-source code powers Linux distributions.\n\nNo. Not at all. Stallman & co do like to paint that picture as if it's \"GNU/Linux plus a sprinkle of non-GNU optional software\", but that's really not the case.\n\nThis must imply that there are versions of ls that are not provided by GNU, right?\n\nHm, the mathematical implication is not there, in the strict sense, but yeah, you're right.\n\nFirst of: all the non-Linux systems do have portable userlands, too, right? FreeBSD, OpenBSD, DragonflyBSD, Minix, MacOS… they all don't ship GNU tools. So, there has to be another dynasty of tools, at least one.\n\nSo, yeah, there's the BSD tools (which of course have various forks). Some are cooler than their GNU counterparts, some worse, some just different. I'm not aware of a Linux distro that completely relies on libbsd/BSD tools where others have gnulib/GNU coreutils, but at least I prefer bsdtar, prefer a different shell than GNU Bash… you get the idea.\n\nThen, by far the most actual physical devices that run Linux will not have GNU userlands:\n\nThere's more than 3.6 billion active Android devices out there. Android is a Linux distribution, which uses toybox (0-BSD licensed) as collection of standard tools, and a modified Korn shell.\n\nThere's a couple of billion DSL/cable/fiber \"router/access point\" boxes that run some Linux distribution. The vast majority of them are running with Busybox (GPL), and use the sh that comes with that.\n\nCompared to what I would guess are around 6 billion Linux devices with a non-GNU set of base tools, I'd argue that the couple million desktop/laptop Linuxes aren't really that prevalent.\n\nBut by far, the most instances of Linux kernels running are probably running in the data centers of the Hyperscaler cloud providers (Amazon, Alibaba, Microsoft, Oracle…). It's hard to put number to that, but it's going to be billions. What these are running – hard to guess. But especially for cloud computing, distros like Alpine Linux are popular, and that doesn't ship with GNU Coreutils, but with Busybox. But here we're counting virtual machines, not physical machines. As I'd argue that in a Google datacenter, a \"device\" is a server rack, and not a single motherboard, the number of physical devices is comparatively small.\n\n(Personal view on this: it's not great that there's less and less percentage of strong copyleft userlands, especially because vendors really haven't stopped infringing the kernel's strong copyleft requirements, and not having an FSF-stewarded code in there isn't great for discovery of that. However, FSF's GPL enforcement has not worked, targeted and worked out like I would have wished for.)\n\nGNU Coreutils in general are not the original version of most of those tools. Typically they are supplied by the operating system and since most flavors of Linux are GNU/Linux you are most familiar with GNU Coreutils. However prior to Linux even being a thing there were BSD tools and various flavors of UNIX tools that mostly still exist today on the various flavors of unix still in use. Also some versions of Linux are not GNU and may use something like Busybox (such as Alpine Linux).\n\nRegardless of who makes them it's important they follow the POSIX standard(s), which is not always the case especially in regards to GNU utilities.\n\nYou can find OpenBSD, FreeBSD, UNIX, GNU, Busybox, etc. versions of pretty much any command.\n\nMany of the UNICES in use originated in at least some way from UNIX version 6 so they may share some identical utilities, or they may have modified those utilities uniquely along the way.\n\nThis must imply that there are versions of ls that are not provided by GNU, right? What are these versions, who make them and where can I find them?\n\nYes. The original implementation of ls under the old AT&T Unix license.\n\nAs for modern implementations of ls, all the ones distributed by the various BSDs (which, unlike Linux, were actually derived from the original AT&T Unix).\n\nYou may think that BSD is a very minority OS with very few users but they exist. And also there is a distro of BSD that has a very large number of users: Apple's Mac OS.\n\nIt is worth remembering what the GNU project is. GNU is GNU's Not Unix. It is a project to make clean copies of Unix tools (such as ls) but is definitely not Unix. As such you can think of the GNU ls as a clone/copy of Unix's original ls. In reality features of GNU tools have inspired other developers to update their tools with the GNU features. Over the years there have been a lot of cross-pollination between GNU and the rest of the Unix world."
