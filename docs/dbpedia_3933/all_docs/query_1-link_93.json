        "text": "Anons I have a strange problem with RetroArch on GNU/Linux. One fine day in early December I git pulled and recompiled as usual, but accidentally forgot to test the binary before make installing. The binary I installed ran, but upon launching any core with any shader the shader compilation would fail with a bunch of [/code] [ERROR] [slang]: Invalid #pragma parameter line: \"#pragma parameter crt_gamma \"Simulated CRT Gamma\" 2.5 1.0 5.0 0.025\".[/code] in the verbose CLI output. After trying a bunch of random shaders and cores I figured some Tranny had dilated itself again and reverted the git repo to some mid-November commit which was around the time I'd last compiled RA which at that point had no problem compiling and displaying slang shaders, but perplexingly enough the \"new\" builds still had the same issue. I then tried GNOME's wayland desktop and got the same result, but on KDE and GNOME's X11 session the shaders compiled and displayed just fine. Now I normally would just the X11 session to emulate my Vidya, but unfortunately RetroArch's VSync on KDE X11 is unusable on Cores that utilize CD-ROM images, it crackles and syncs like ass and it the case of PSX cores also tanks performance for no reason while on Wayland those cores with shaders VSynced perfectly. It works on GNOME X11 but GNOME is hideous. Glancing over the slang and GLSL specs a bit the #pragma parameter lines in the shader files seem to be within spec, I considered some problem with a dependency but my last update of spirv-tools, spirv-cross and libglslang (which I suspect to be culprits but don't know) then was sometime in October back when RA ran just fine. I don't have the shekels to buy a real CRT and don't have enough computer to run Flycast at 1080p with 32-layer OIT for proper grafics, what do? Have since updated KWin, amdgpu, spirv and my Kernel but the issue still persists, though 1 in 10 boots it decides to just werk and compile shaders with no issue. Happens on both the glcore and vulkan driver backends, plain GLSL shaders under gl are also broken with some FBO issue but I haven't used that backend since the glcore merger.\n\n>>12537 >Perhaps you upgraded other related programs when you recompiled RetroArch?

It will load the page as HTTP only, with the angry red text in the address bar. This seems to have been created as a workaround for the devs to use in testing and left in. It works in some Chrome-derived browsers like Chromium but I haven't tested it in Edge, or any of the others. I'm not sure how you get around the HSTS error in Firefox. Half the time, of course, when I do this, I can see the page. The other half of the time it gives a different message, \"this instance has been rate limited, try again later.\" It always eventually works but sometimes it takes a few hours or even a day or two to reset. Sometimes I get to see the spicy post, By the time I can get through, sometimes it says \"this tweet not found.\" It's annoying, but not annoying enough for me to be willing to make a Twatter account and dox myself to the crazies who work there.\n\nReplies: >>12822\n\n>>12816 is vmware SVGA good enough these days ive just finished downloading popcap classics off IGG shady games, surprisingly enough the original exe installer is perfectly intact so far it works fine but my win7 VM screen force resizes to 800x600 as it loads >lutris cringe neofetch screencap bro i bet you have \"eastern\" femboy pictures on your secret steam profile gb2 cuckchan /g/ or nu-sleepychan /vee/ >using nvidiot drivers on wangblows back then a crash broke the realtek audio service seems pretty standard as the OS had the habit of resetting its configs to \"default low specs\" whenever its overloaded but a reboot restored my audio idk why that happens on amd integrated graphics >>12691 dunno if its just me but am i the only one with a theory that stronger \"gayming\" PCs tend to be unstable and prone to lag problems or outright crashes where as office models tend to last a rather long time without issues? are expensive \"workstation\" models even affected by this planed obsolescence maybe its just that weaker computers dont really go through that much load hence more reliable as my mini PC lasted 200 days uptime and counting while the other primary PC cant even stay up for two weeks straight EVEN while mostly idle >>12801 >thisisunsafe sauce on this easter egg? is this reddit programmer lore? >>12676 anyone had luck configuring gamepads on linux? xboxdrv barely works and xpad does not do anything i just want my chinkshit to work over bluetooth firefox cant detect my wireless controller for online testing while jstest-GTK does not move at all How exactly do you make a BIOS backup without dangerously clipping the hardware ROM chip? any specific 16 bit bootloader programs and maybe linux kernel .MODs i can use or some leaked factory specific dev flasher tool from the manufacturer itself (AMI for me) Please make this procedure as safe as possible for me im not gonna spend another hundred dollars and a month of expensive ESD covered box delivery just because chang intentionally stripped off my system identification number like all the other replacements sold online Its not really too important but i would like to extract the serial ID key from my older motherboard and transplant it on the new one without bricking either of the two other than that everything else is fully functional both tested locally and before seller shipped it to my address Although my wifi card lags a bit on this model and i just want to make my self-repair attempt look as authentic as possible im not even sure if this works considering the old one has 8gb soldered while the newer mobo is 16GB with slightly different firmware code but variants are yet STILL same (according to hardinfo)\n\n>>12260 I'm back, everything was fine until now, but a few minutes ago the computer started not responding.

It feels like all of the fucking \"big 4\" brands (Asus, Asrock, MSI, Gigabyte) are filled with shitty QA practices and/or go out of their way to disrespect the people who buy their products. But then I look up more obscure brands, and it's like.... Nobody fucking reviews or looks into them, at all. if it's not \"the big 4,\" then there is barely any reviews if there are any at all. And then there's the problem with inbuilt-wifi on motherboards nowadays. It's hard to find a motherboard now, that DOESN'T have wifi or bluetooth. I don't fucking need it, I don't fucking want it, I have an Ethernet cable attached to my router. I feel like I'm just removing the ability to airgap if I choose a motherboard with wifi, because there isn't a simple and easy way to say \"fuck off\" in case someone decides to snoop my shit. So, what motherboards out there on the market, aren't shit / run by assholes? I know that if have to pick a \"safer\" motherboard, I may need to redo my entire build from scratch, and it's so fucking hard to find a computer part manufacturer that isn't retarded or jewish, but damn.\n\n>>13406 >unplug a bit the RAM and the PC will not start That doesn't break it, I want actual damage that will need replacement. >use a water spray That will leave evidence. Water damage out of nowhere just doesn't happen. >try to break the components or something Yeah, this is what I've been doing. The NVMe SSD is hard to reach, but I beat it with a soldering iron, aiming for the flash chips under the sticker, unfortunately I just heard on the internet that flash is strongly shock resistant so that may have done nothing. I bent capacitor terminals, I felt some of them click, don't know what will be of it yet. I accidentally turned on the computer and the lights on one of the RAM sticks didn't turn on, maybe I achieved something, but it could just be that one of the mix and matched models doesn't light up immediately. The case is packed very tight and also shoved in a tight space so I don't have the time to disassemble and reassemble the computer to reach components easily when I have the chance to do something. Maybe I should craft something with a battery and some wire and see if I can zap something. Or jam something made out into a slot and see if it short circuits. I already tried stuff in previous days and it turns out computer parts aren't that fragile, you can beat a hard disk and nothing happens.\n\nReplies: >>13408 >>13409\n\nTL;DR: IS THERE A GENERAL PURPOSE \"AIMBOT\" FOR USING THE COMPUTER? WTF DOES THAT MEAN, GIVE CONTEXT: This is a weird \"Issue\"/not-really-an-issue I have, and I wonder if anyone knows any kind of software that would help with it. The basic idea is that \"clicking on things is slow, how can I make it faster?\"\" Let me use what I'm doing right now as an example. I went to move my mouse to click on \"[New Reply]\" on the top of the page. I can click \"Home\" or fly the scroll wheel up and I get right up to the top of the page, no problem. Then I move my mouse cursor to click on \"[New Reply]\". >fly my cursor towards it >overshoot by 20 pixels >go much slower to move the mouse >click on \"[New Reply]\" once I'm lined up. I then click on the textbox. Here I don't really have this \"issue\" because the text box is a rather large target. But, I then want to resize the textbox. So I did the same thing. >fly my cursor towards the corner to grab the resizing corner >overshoot by 20 pixels. >go much slower to move the mouse to grab the corner >the target area is smaller this time, so I take longer to \"line up\" >grab it and jerk the window to the correct size I'm REALLY over-exaggerating things. I don't think I really go \"super slow\" when \"lining up\" my cursor to click on links, buttons, alignment bars, etc.. But it's enough for me to notice, and I do this thousands of times throughout the course of the workday for me to notice it over time. It feels like I'm really slow using the computer. When I'm able to \"schedule\" all my work to be command line I have no issues. Everything feels lightening fast. But when I have to switch back and forth between the mouse and keyboard, and especially when I just use the mouse in general, it just feels slow. What I'd like, and I think would help, is something that kind of \"aimbots\" my mouse onto the clickable objects. Like if my mouse is going fast enough, and it's within X pixels of a hyperlink, the mouse will just SNAP right on top of the hyperlink. Does something like this exist? How else can I minimize keyboard/mouse back-and-forth and maximize keyboard use in general? Keeping in mind that using the GUI is inescapable (for those that disagree: you're on this website and I know you're not on lynx/w3m).\n\nReplies: >>13428 >>13429\n\nI am having a strange issue with Handbrake. I noticed awhile back that my Xbox 360, JVC AV-32220 monitor or both aren't playing nice and mp4s (of videos that are 4:3 and should be a perfect fit with my TV model) that I am making from handbrake seem zoomed in when I watch them on the console/monitor, to the point even subtitles spill off the screen sometimes. I decided to just add black borders around the mp4s when I make them, which has worked well and I would like to continue using this method in the future. However, I have found that only the first file of every batch encode can be read by the 360. Every video from each batch works perfectly fine on my computer. The only workaround I have found is to quit out of Handbrake entirely, re-open, encode only one file at a time, repeat. Surely there is something I am doing wrong. When I don't mess with the border dimensions at all and batch-encode, I don't have this issue, but then I will have spillover for any 4:3 file, which again makes no sense to me because my monitor is natively 4:3; I have looked through the on-screen menu thoroughly and have found no fix to this on the TV's end (nor the 360's settings menu, which is why I am being retarded and adding borders with Handbrake in the first place). I know this is a stupid, perhaps autistically specific, problem for several reasons, but I was wondering if anyone might have experienced a similar issue and found a solution. It just seems weird that the Xbox won't read the batch-encoded files when border dimensions come into play, but can read them fine if I encode the files one by one. Thought I figured out one problem and now I have another. This is gay.\n\n>>13861 I am going to try burning subtitles in with Handbrake and then going back over to add the borders in a batch with Xmedia Recode (this program is also supposed to have burning-in, but I suppose it is not available for my specific subtitle tracks or something). I will test a batch of two or three, using the queue process on both programs instead of closing between encodes, then I will try to open each one. >>13862 I realize Handbrake is just ffmpeg for retards, but I honestly wouldn't know where to begin in figuring out all the arguments I need to include in a command to achieve similar or superior results to what I can get out of Handbrake. I am willing to use it, but it seems daunting to dive into. I am not very tech-savvy, if that wasn't yet obvious. >I can write a command to do your conversion later today Almost don't want to tell you what I need because I don't know how tedious it is to write a command for ffmpeg. The settings I require (that I can think of) are: >mp4 >batch encode entire folder >adding black borders around every video, in this case something like 48x40 to 1440x1080 resulting in 1536x1080 (not sure why it continues to display 1080 for height, though it has added height borders in the files I have gotten to work as subtitles and the video below them appears correctly; unsure if it might act differently in ffmpeg) >picking audio track >burning in a specific subtitle track from a mkv that has multiple tracks I wouldn't know if I am missing any details.\n\nReplies: >>13868 >>13869"
