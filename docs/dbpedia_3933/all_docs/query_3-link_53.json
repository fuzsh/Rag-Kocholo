So, yes, FreeBSD can be made to work like PC-BSD—that's exactly what the PC-BSD team have done!\n\nIf you want a graphical desktop system to get you started learning *BSD, then I would think PC-BSD is the ideal place to start—it gets you up and running with one of several popular desktop environments from the get-go, so you can then focus on learning other aspects of the system. If, on the other hand, you want to get your hands dirty from the beginning, learning how to install FreeBSD and additional software, you can use the ports system to add the extras you want.\n\nAs for the documentation, the vast majority of documentation relevant to FreeBSD will also apply to PC-BSD without modification, so the PC-BSD team focus their efforts on documenting the differences."
