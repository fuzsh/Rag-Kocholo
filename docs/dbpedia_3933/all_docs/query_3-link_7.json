        "text": "Windows and macOS are out for me. I mention my issues with them here.\n\nAs for Linux, it is too inconsistent and hacky to be a desktop (It makes for a decent quick and dirty appliance though). In many ways systemd was actually a good thing to unify the Linux ecosystem and bring some consistency. Though for a software as terrible as systemd to be a \"good point\" of Linux speaks volumes for how horrible I find it.\n\nFor desktops, I also find a network aware display system an important factor. Quartz and Wayland are pretty much out since they can only really do VNC which is pretty much a Windows 95-era technology. Windows RDP is by far the best but X11 is actually pretty close if you don't use a ridiculous GUI toolkit. So since \"modern\" Windows is basically unusable in other critical ways, I guess FreeBSD (and OpenBSD) with X11 win by default!\n\n... I'm going to stop my ramble here. I am sure others have more succinct points\n\nOur company develops operating systems on microcontrollers (smart cards). These smart cards are used in various industrial systems. Each industrial system has its own requirements for the 'file structure of the card', the 'set of commands' and the security settings of the microcontroller OS. Therefore, our developers for each industrial system create \"their own\" application that runs on the card \"on top\" of the base OS of the microcontroller. To demonstrate how a customer's industrial system should interact with our smart card, we write \"industrial system prototype\" (I write these prototypes). The interaction of the customer's system and our card is carried out through libraries (creating/parsing APDU, cryptographic, TLV, ...), which are linked to the customer's system (I write these libraries). Various industrial systems are written in various programming languages (C, C++, Java, ...) and run on various operating systems (Windows, Linux, FreeBSD). Therefore, the prototypes are also different. But first of all, it is necessary to test the created microcontroller OS (and applications on it). To do this, I write (in ะก++) tests that test the smart card from the terminal side (from various operating systems: Windows, Linux, FreeBSD). When developing the microcontroller OS, card emulators are used. These emulators work mostly on Windows only (emulator drivers and development tools/environment are Windows only). To speed up my work, I simultaneously run several virtual machines to which emulators (with the microcontroller OS loaded in them) are connected, and several virtual machines (as well as the host itself) on which tests are run...To do this, I used to use Debian as a host, and I had virtual machines on VirtualBox. But in the spring of 2022, after some regular update of the Linux kernel, VirtualBox stopped working - virtual machines started to freeze/reboot after 15 minutes of operation. During operation, the usb-devices connected to the virtual machine began to \"fall off\". Then I switched to VMware Workstation. There are similar problems - the usb device is periodically captured either by the host or by the virtual machine (it depends on the pcscd settings on the host and the virtual machine). Virtual machines in VMware often \"lose\" VMware Tools (analogue of Guest Additions in VirtualBox). It's all little things, of course, but annoying ...\n\nIn the spring of 2022, I switched to a FreeBSD host and bhyve virtual machines. Virtual machines are reliable and fast (faster than VirtualBox and VMware). For me, this is the main thing.\n\nFor me as well, it's more of a \"why not\" question...\n\nIn fact, as far as the \"GUI layer\" is concerned, any *nix opensource desktop is the same, meaning you have more or less the same choices regarding window managers, tools like terminal emulators, compositors, completely integrated desktop environments, etc. And among all these choices, there are some I really like and prefer a lot over e.g. the GUIs of Windows or Apple. So, I certainly want a \"*nix opensource desktop\".\n\nThen, \"why FreeBSD\" is simple to answer: I use FreeBSD anyways, I like the way I can administrate that OS *), and not having to switch between different systems is a huge plus. And this just leaves the \"why not\".\n\nI didn't find anything so far. Graphics drivers are ported from Linux (using some in-kernel compatibility layer) and work just fine for me. Peripherals I want to use are supported. All the software I want to use is available on FreeBSD. The only little drawback is the state of Wifi support, but I can live with that...\n\n---\n\n*) and, lots of other things I once described here: https://sekrit.de/webdocs/freebsd/advocacy.html\n\nI use both windowmaker and kde 5 plasma as desktops on freebsd and linux. I don't use windows or mac. I'm a programmer so its good to have all the tools available. Fbsd is a bit behind linux in a few areas, bluetooth being the one I've hit recently (I wanted to drive some bt speakers, gave up after trying), another is more restricted software availability than linux. The software I use a lot, like wmaker, vim, cmus, cscope, ctags, vifm, slrn, irssi, links (browser), X11 (networked window system is a must), Perl, C compiler and toolchain, git, firefox, too many others to mention but you get the picture, is all available.\n\nFbsd wins in some areas, the ports system is nice, although code I download tends to compile easier on linux without patching whereas some hacks are often needed on bsd, probably because it was developed on linux in the first place. System updates tend to go pretty well on both o/s's nowadays, and stability of both is good.\n\nAs a desktop fbsd has all the tools I need, openoffice, the kde office suite, pdf readers (nice to see mupdf in ports), etc etc. I like the link aggregation that gives me painless failover between wifi and ethernet network connections without the need for something like network manager. I haven't tried getting my 3-in-1 HP laser printer/scanner working on freebsd yet, I still drive that from linux at the moment.\n\nI use both windowmaker and kde 5 plasma as desktops on freebsd and linux.

I want it to be MY computer (as much as any cpu with an intel ME in it can be mine). If I use a mac or windows, it's not my computer. It's a leaf node in their system, that I have a somewhat restrictive license to use. It's sending telemetry back to them about what I do with the machine, it's sticking ads in front of my eyes, it's installing all kinds of crap and on the machine in the background. In the case of apple it's telling me that my perfectly good hardware is \"no longer supported\" and they want me to buy it from them again.\n\nIn the old days a home micro or a DOS PC was yours. No telemetry, no ads, no unattended updates, no monitoring. The bsd's and linux (at least, things like slackware) are about as close to that as its possible to get in modern systems.\n\nThere is one other thing, which is kind of philosophical.
