FreeBSD has not been refined for the desktop to the extent that Linux Mint, Fedora, or Ubuntu have. That said, I have used it as a desktop operating system for a short time and it does work, but is not as user friendly as others.\n\nFreeBSD is the operating system in quite a few servers that I use everyday, such as FreeNAS and my firewalls. I find it a very stable operating system.\n\nI use Linux Mint on my desktop and laptops at work and at home. I've installed it for my son, wife and step-mother and they have also been using it for years and love it.\n\nRank: Newbie\n\nJoined: 12/5/2015\n\nPosts: 4\n\nNeurons: 2,269\n\nLocation: Como, Mississippi, United States\n\nBSD is the Berkley Software Distribution Model - The thing is, unlike many OS's of Linux architecture, native BSD code is a more UNIX \"server\" like hybrid then a Linux distro. Lots of \"techies\" get confused by this because BSD has had so many implementations over it's history and as BSD is still in development today, it is a feature rich and has a robust set of development tools and a vastly diverse support community. If I were trying to decide if I wanted to use BSD as my server platform of choice, I think I would ask myself the following questions.\n\n1.)Do I need a system that is primarily used in engineering and development environments and if so am I willing to abandon what I think I know about \"Linux\" distros to learn more about a true UNIX like OS?\n\n2.)Am I a proficient or experienced enough programmer, that in the general course of using BSD, can I make scripting or programming changes \"on the fly\" to solve problems (De-compile and recompile code as to identify and customize a fix to resolve a bug)? Sorry, no troubleshooting creature features here, it's all work, satisfying work to be sure, but nonetheless work. The other side of this second item is.. If the answer is no, can I develop and grow as an administrator and scripting/programming guy (using tools like GCC or GC+). one last note: The importance of this is if you have an issue, especially a undocumented issue and you aren't willing or are not able to do \"The fix\" it could turn into \"a long day at the office\".\n\n2.)BSD can be used also as a learning tool or a great sand-box for the enthusiast to learn and \"play around\" with. For the Linux enthusiast I would always encourage looking forward to the BSD system as a personal or professional development path and completion milepost as to becoming a well rounded student of technology or as a working professional.\n\nLearning something is fine, understanding something is priceless. - John M."
