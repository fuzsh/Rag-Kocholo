        "text": "What is FreeBSD?\n\nThe secure, stable, high-performance open source operating system\n\nFreeBSD is a modern, community-governed, open source operating system with enterprise-friendly permissive licensing. It offers superior security, performance, and stability in a single production-ready package.\n\nWHY USE FREEBSD?\n\nSecure by Design\n\nFreeBSD is renowned for security – a commitment strongly backed by the global FreeBSD community.\n\nSecurity as standard: With strong security features as standard, FreeBSD’s model aims to minimize the amount of code affecting security. Many services are designed to run with minimal privileges, to limit the damage done in the event of a security breach.\n\nThe complete core operating system is developed in a single repository by a single open source project: The FreeBSD Project develops and maintains the kernel and all the core system components, including its device drivers, userland utilities, and documentation.\n\nSecurity and Release process: Security features are incorporated into FreeBSD releases before being announced to provide an effective window against potential common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE).\n\nSecurity Team: The FreeBSD Security Team is responsible for keeping the community aware of bugs, exploits, and security risks affecting FreeBSD and promoting and distributing information needed to run FreeBSD systems safely. The team is also responsible for resolving software bugs affecting FreeBSD’s security and issuing security advisories.\n\nThe FreeBSD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy: The FreeBSD Security Officer favors full disclosure of vulnerability information after a reasonable delay to permit safe analysis and correction of a vulnerability, appropriate testing of the correction, and appropriate coordination with other affected parties. The Security Officer will notify FreeBSD Cluster Admins of vulnerabilities that put the FreeBSD Project’s resources under immediate danger\n\nFeatures:\n\nJails\n\nA unique feature of FreeBSD, increase security by creating operating system-level containerization and partitioning. This allows administrators to create isolated environments separate from the host operating system, which helps prevent security breaches from spreading to other parts of the system.\n\nCaspsicum\n\nIs a security framework that allows developers to create programs that operate within a safe sandbox environment separate and isolated from the rest of their environment to implement security policies and limit the impact of vulnerabilities.\n\nCheriBSD\n\nExtends FreeBSD to implement memory protection and software compartmentalization, making it more exploitation-resistant. FreeBSD has the most complete implementation of the CHERI framework available.\n\nImpressive Performance\n\nFreeBSD provides superior performance with a fast, lightweight, and scalable operating system.\n\nBase system: FreeBSD base system is smaller than other operating systems, with only necessary components included, giving it a performance edge.\n\nFeatures:\n\nTCP/IP\n\nFreeBSD’s TCP/IP stack is native and has less latency and faster response time. Further, FreeBSD offers consistent performance, particularly for network and I/O operations.\n\nThe Z File System (ZFS)\n\nBrings a high-capacity fault-tolerant file system with multiple performance benefits to FreeBSD, including pooled storage, end-to-end data integrity, and transactional operation.\n\nEnhanced Stability\n\nFreeBSD’s development process promotes the stability of a complete operating system, making it the choice behind some of the world’s most recognizable and well-known brands.\n\nFreeBSD is a complete operating system, including the FreeBSD kernel, its device drivers, userland utilities, and documentation. FreeBSD is an off-the-shelf package ready to go out of the box. BSD-based operating systems stand out for being complete operating systems.\n\nOpen Source Permissive Licence\n\nFreeBSD isn’t just open source; it’s a permissive license and an open governance model that fosters wide adoption and integration into commercial projects.\n\nUse of code: Permissive licenses allow extensive use and modification without imposing stringent conditions.\n\nDistribute in proprietary works: FreeBSD licensing allows using the code and distribution of proprietary products.\n\nLow risk: It’s easy to meet the BSD license reuse requirements. With FreeBSD, the license language must be on everything under the license.\n\nFREEBSD END USERS\n\nFrom Arm to Netflix, the world’s most innovative organizations and individuals trust FreeBSD for their mission-critical servers and devices.

Today, FreeBSD supports the technology crucial to modern lifestyles. From firing up Netflix to supporting the Edge with RGNets, it’s all built using FreeBSD.\n\n1993\n\nFirst open\n\ngovernance\n\nSet up a core group to provide leadership rather than having a single person in charge\n\n2000\n\nFirst container\n\nvirtualization\n\nFreeBSD Jails partitions a system into several independent mini-systems\n\n2003\n\nFirst Mandatory\n\nAccess Control\n\nFirst introduced in FreeBSD 5.0, MAC is a key security improvement used everywhere today\n\n2008\n\nFirst non-Solaris\n\nintegration of ZFS\n\nDeveloped at Sun, ZFS is an advanced file system focused on data integrity, pooled storage, and performance\n\n2012\n\nFirst OS running\n\non CHERI\n\nCHERI provides performant HW protection against memory safety vulnerabilities\n\n2022\n\nFirst to 800 Gb/s TLS on standard hardware\n\nAsync Sendfile, NUMA enhancements, and NIC kTLS promise to increase per-server throughput on COTS AMD server to 800 Gb/s\n\nFREEBSD QUOTES\n\n“Netflix picked FreeBSD 9 because it is a high-performing, low-maintenance, and reliable operating system supported by major hardware vendors. FreeBSD provides a simple but powerful solution capable of serving tens of thousands of simultaneous video streams across multiple 10Gbit fiber optic links.”\n\nDavid Fullagar\n\nDirector of Content Delivery Architecture\n\nA WELCOMING GLOBAL COMMUNITY\n\nMAILING LISTS\n\nQuestions Mailing List\n\nConnect with the FreeBSD community and find answers to issues you encounter.\n\nCurrent Mailing List\n\nParticipate in discussions on FreeBSD with the global community.\n\nJoin the conversation!\n\nFreeBSD\n\nDiscord\n\nFreeBSD Forums\n\nFreeBSD IRC Channel\n\nFreeBSD\n\nSub-Reddit\n\nFree BSD\n\nUser Groups"
