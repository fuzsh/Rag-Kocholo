I try to make Rhythmbox the default for mp3-files. But without luck.\n\nIf I right-click on an mp3-file and select Rhythmbox it opens and play the file. So I know it is there and works.\n\nWhat I did:\n\n1. I Selected the Rhythmbox as default player for Music. Did not work it opens the mp3-file in the videoplayer (selected for videofiles and is only option to select for videofiles).\n\n2. I did a right click on an mp3-file. Selected to choose default program for that file. (Even if Rhytmbox is the only app in the menu to select).\n\nAnyway, the menu opens and I choose (the selected) Rhytmbox. The mp3-file opens in Rhythmbox. I close the file and double click any mp3-file. It opens in the damn videoplayer app.\n\n3. I try to find in app Rhytmbox a way to make it default for mp3-files. Only thing I find is to set preferred format. I select mp3 (even if I don't believe it is for what I want), and it does not work.\n\nI am new to Ubuntu and Linux and used to Windows where everything works right out the box. So please be nice.. Ok!"
