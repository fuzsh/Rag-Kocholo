        "text": "FreeBSD is a popular server platform and a free and open source Unix-like operating system.\n\nFreeBSD can be used as a powerful desktop or a development machine, depending on your needs. It also supports network services such as web, mail, files, and other programs. One of FreeBSD's most well-known features is its dependability as an internet server. Netflix and Sony rely on FreeBSD to deliver dependable service for their PlayStation consoles.\n\nFreeBSD is extremely stable, and it also has a high level of security. It's lightning fast and highly responsive. FreeBSD is a free operating system that focuses on performance, networking, and storage, integrating system management and thorough documentation to let any computer realize its full potential.\n\nThis article will describe FreeBSD, a Unix-derived operating system that most of us consider a Linux operating system, and give some details pros and cons of FreeBSD.\n\nFreeBSD is a free and open-source Unix-derived operating system. It was built for desktops, laptops, servers, and embedded systems that is based on the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) and runs a variety of platforms. It focuses mostly on features, speed, and stability.\n\nWell, since when did free BSD exist, where do its roots go?\n\nIt was 1974. AT&T granted the University of California, Berkeley a Unix source license. With DARPA assistance, the Computer Systems Research Group began updating and enhancing AT&T Research Unix. This modified version was named \"Berkeley Unix\" or \"Berkeley Software Distribution\" (BSD), and it included technologies such as TCP/IP, virtual memory, and the Berkeley Fast File System. Bill Joy created the BSD project in 1976.\n\nThe first public version of BSD, \"Networking Release 1,\" or simply Net-1, was released in June 1989. \"Networking Release 2\" (Net-2) would be incomplete without those AT&T files. Net-2 launched in 1991. On June 19, 1993, the name FreeBSD was decided for the project. In November 1993, the first version of FreeBSD was released\n\nFigure 1. FreeBSD Version History\n\nFor its users, FreeBSD has a number of unique features. Here are some of FreeBSD's most notable features.\n\nModules [kernel] “loadable” dynamically. It allows new types of File System, Network Protocols, or Binary Emulators to load into the system without having to create a new kernel.\n\nFreeBSD bhyve: The FreeBSD base system now (with FreeBSD 10) includes a new BSD-licensed, legacy-free hypervisor. It can presently run all supported versions of FreeBSD, as well as OpenBSD and Linux through the grub-bhyve port.\n\nAs you may be familiar with Windows, In FreeBSD multi-user access is possible. That means a different user can perform their task simultaneously. All peripherals can be used as shared.\n\nFreeBSD can communicate with other systems thanks to the Full TCP / IP connection. Not only it can act as a Primary server but also performs critical duties such as FTP ,Firewall, email services, and Network File System\n\nThe Ports Collection is a collection of over 23,000 third-party programs that can be installed and operated on FreeBSD with ease.\n\nIf you require access to a large number of third-party programs, FreeBSD has more than four times the number of apps in the ports and packages system as OpenBSD.FreeBSD also offers a wealth of tuneable options for the kernel, filesystem, and network that OpenBSD does not.\n\nJails are a light-weight alternative to virtualization\n\nFreeBSD Firewalls: IPFW and IPFilter are included in the basic system, as well as a modified version of the popular pf with better SMP performance. IPFW also contains the dummynet function, which allows network managers to mimic undesirable network circumstances such as latency, jitter, packet loss, and bandwidth limitations.\n\nThe memory protection feature allows applications (or users) to avoid interfering with each other's tasks.\n\nThe industry standard X Window (X11R6) system provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for the most common VGA cards and monitors, including all source code.\n\nDTrace, a sophisticated event-based performance analysis and troubleshooting tool is heavily ported to FreeBSD.\n\nWell-documented and always up-to-date online documentation is available.\n\nSupport of Ultra-DMA peripherals in ISA Bus\n\nUp to now there are 13 Releases of FreeBSD.These are listed below.\n\nThe first official release. It was released in November 1993. 1.1.5.1 was released in July 1994.\n\nThe Ports Collection is a collection of port-related items feature launched with FreeBSD 1\n\nSome remaining issues from the import of 386BSD have been fixed and some ported apps have been added (XFree86, XView, InterViews, elm, nntp) were the remarkable features of FreeBSD 1.\n\nReleased on 22 Nov. 1994 FreeBSD 2.0 was the first version of FreeBSD to be legally free of AT&T Unix code, with Novell's consent. It was the first version to be extensively utilized in the early days of Internet server spread. Significant changes can be listed as in this release.\n\nBSD-Lite 4.4 was used to replace the codebase (to satisfy terms of the USL v. BSDi lawsuit settlement).\n\nThere is a new installer and a new boot manager.\n\nMore filesystems are supported by loadable filesystems (MS-DOS, unionfs, kernfs).\n\nLoadable kernel modules from NetBSD were imported.\n\nphkmalloc has been used in place of BSD malloc.\n\nELF allows for full Linux emulation.\n\nShaped traffic on the dummynet.\n\nReleased in 16 October 1998.FreeBSD 3.0 was the first branch to enable symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) systems through the use of a Giant lock, and it marked the move from a.out to ELF executables. FreeBSD 3.1 was the first to provide USB capability, while 3.2-RELEASE was the first to include support for Gigabit network adapters.\n\n4.0-RELEASE was released in March 2000, and the most recent 4-STABLE branch release was 4.11 in January 2005, which was maintained until January 31, 2007.FreeBSD 4 was praised for its reliability, was a preferred operating system for ISPs and web hosting providers during the first dot-com explosion, and is widely regarded as one of the most reliable and high-performance operating systems in the whole Unix family.\n\nThis release was launched on 14 January 2003. The FreeBSD 5.4 and 5.5 releases demonstrated that the technologies released in the FreeBSD 5.x branch would have a future in highly reliable and high-performing versions. Cryptography enabled by default in base. With this version, bluetooth started to be supported\n\nIn 1 November 2005 FreeBSD 6.x releases expanded work on SMP and threading optimization, as well as additional work on enhanced 802.11 capabilities, TrustedBSD security event auditing, substantial network stack performance increases, a fully preemptive kernel, and hardware performance counter support (HWPMC).\n\nAfter 3 years later from FreeBSD 6 on 27 February 2008 FreeBDS 7 was launched.SCTP, UFS journaling, an experimental port of Sun's ZFS file system, GCC4, improved support for the ARM architecture, jemalloc (a memory allocator optimized for parallel computation,and major network, audio, and SMP performance updates and optimizations were among the new features of FreeBSD 7 distributions\n\nFreeBSD 8 was released on 26 November 2009. A new virtualization container called \"vimage\" has been added. This is a FreeBSD jail that contains a virtualized instance of the FreeBSD network stack and is built with the jail command. The FreeBSD netisr (Kernel network dispatch service) framework has been rewritten to allow parallel threading. The FreeBSD TTY updated with a new FreeBSD TTY that supports SMP and has more robust resource handling. FreeBSD 8 started to support USB 3.0\n\nFreeBSD 9 released 12 January 2012. One bsdinstall installer has been introduced and is utilized by the ISO images included with this version.ZFS has been upgraded to version 28. Softupdates journaling is now supported by the Fast Filesystem. Highly Available Storage (HAST) framework has been implemented. The NFS subsystem has been upgraded, and the new version now supports NFSv4 in addition to NFSv3 and NFSv2.\n\nFreeBSD release date 20 January 2014.Capsicum has been enabled by default in the kernel, facilitating sandboxing of various programs that run in the \"capabilities mode.virtio support has been added.\n\nSupport for the Raspberry Pi has been added.FreeBSD Raspberry Pİ Installation can be accessed from that connection.\n\nhttps://freebsdfoundation.org/freebsd-project/resources/installing-freebsd-for-raspberry-pi/\n\nThe stable version of FreeBSD 11 was launched on October 10, 2016. The new version of NetMap introduced in this release. Parallel mounting has been added to the ZFS filesystem.Trim(8), which deletes material for blocks on flash-based storage devices that employ wear-leveling methods, has been added.64-bit ARM Architecture support became available.\n\nFreeBSD 12 released date 11 December 2018. With this release, the ext2fs(5) filesystem has been upgraded to enable full read/write functionality for the ext4 filesystem.FreeBSD has altered how graphics drivers are handled on amd64 and i386 platforms. The Ports Collection now includes graphics drivers for current ATI-AMD and Intel graphics devices.\n\nFreeBSD 13 released date 13 April 2021. FreeBSD 13 is now available, including significant improvements such as the transition to a new OpenZFS filesystem and an improved toolchain that attempts to unify FreeBSD across all platforms.Dropping support for obsolute drivers result in better performance on modern machines.Although ZFS support has been there for some time, the switch to the new OpenZFS tree guarantees that users have access to the most up-to-date capabilities.This version has prioritized codebase cleanup and performance enhancements.\n\nLet's look at the advantages of FreeBSD, which forms the infrastructure of many known systems from Netflix to Mac Os.\n\nSome of the main advantages of using FreeBSD can be listed as easy installation, being free, secure, and stable. Let’s look at these in detail.\n\nFreeBSD provides detailed installation documentation for a variety of platforms. Even if you are not familiar with other operating systems (Linux,unix) you can install it with the help of documentation.FreeBSD may be installed via a CD-ROM, DVD, or directly using FTP or NFS with the guidance of documentation.\n\nNormally, such a full-fledged operating system is thought to be paid but FreeBSD is free of charge and available with its code.\n\nSecurity is highly important to FreeBSD, and its developers are continuously trying to make the operating system as safe as possible.BSD and Unix have a well-deserved industry reputation for rock-solid (though not flawless, as misconfiguration can lead to vulnerabilities) security and stability.\n\nWhen we look at the perspective of a number of vulnerabilities that Linux and FreeBSD systems faced.FreeBSD is 7 times lower than Linux in the last 20 years (Of course, Linux is more widely used and is the target of bad actors.)\n\nFigure 2. The last 20 years of FreeBSD vs Linux Vulnerability Counts\n\nAnother factor that makes BSD safe is that it is built on a monolithic kernel.\n\nIn addition to its Security advantage over other OS, FreeBSD provides a stability edge.FreeBSD servers have been known to run for years without issue.\n\nThese are sufficient reasons for us to prefer FreeBSD over other OS.\n\nDrawbacks of FreeBSD are listed below:\n\nLess Developer Support: One of the most complaining aspects of FreeBSD is less developer support.\n\nComplex to Understand: Getting to terms with a new and sophisticated operating system is never easy, no matter how appealing the graphical user interface seems. In this regard, FreeBSD is no different. Less community support especially for newbies can lead to understanding problems.\n\nThe FreeBSD installer is available in a variety of formats, including ISO Disc Images in CD (disc1), DVD (dvd1), and Network Install (boot only) sizes, as well as normal and small USB memory stick images.\n\nYou can download the installer, VM Images, SD Card Images according to your environment and preferences\n\nhttps://www.freebsd.org/where/\n\nFigure 3. FreeBSD Download\n\nI will explain installing FreeBSD on an Oracle VM in this article\n\nFirst, you need to download the FreeBSD ISO file according to your needs and environment\n\nOr You can get the latest VM images from https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/VM-IMAGES/13.0-RELEASE/amd64/Latest/.\n\nFigure 4. VirtualBox Download\n\nTo create a virtual environment we need to have a virtualization program. In this tutorial, VirtualBox will be used.\n\nDownload VirtualBox from https://www.virtualbox.org/ according to your OS.\n\nAfter downloading it you can install it very straightforward\n\nAfter installing it we can start to configure our virtual FreeBSD 13 machine.\n\nCreate a new Virtual Machine on Virtualbox by clicking icon\n\nFigure 5.
