        "text": "It’s become a annual tradition at Datamation to publish an complete roundup of all the open source projects we’ve featured throughout the year. This year’s update includes a vast trove of open source software: 1,343 different projects, from 138 different categories, including two brand new categories.\n\nThis year’s open source list has quite a few new additions related to cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI). It also has quite a few new projects related to marketing software.\n\nPlease note that this is not a ranking. The projects are organized into categories and then listed alphabetically within the categories.\n\nAs always, if you know of additional open source software that you’d like to see us cover in future lists, feel free to note them in the Comments section below.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nGateway Security to Internet of ThingsAccessibility to Big Data Tools\n\nBitcoin to Content Management\n\nCRM to Developer Tools\n\nFitness to Document Management\n\nEducational Testing to Games\n\nInterior Design to Multi-Function Security Solutions\n\nMusic Education to Operating Systems\n\nOrganization Management to Screenplay Writing\n\nSDN to Web Servers\n\nPopular Open Source Software\n\nWindows 10\n\nSure, you’re a Windows user – in fact you’re using an up to date Windows OS. But in today’s world, it’s still entirely likely you’re looking for the best open source software for your PC. This list gathers some familiar names with lesser known apps, all with an eye toward boosting your Windows 10 machine. Which app do you think is the best open source software for Win10\n\nTop Open Source Sites\n\nThere are countless websites that offer extensive lists of open source software to download. But finding the best open source website is easier said than done. To help, we’ve compiled a list of the very best open source websites – let the downloading begin.\n\nBusiness Intelligence Software\n\nIn this aggregation of open source BI tools, you’ll certainly see some famous names: MySQL, Pentaho, along with some names that get less buzz as well. Of course in the rapidly changing business intelligence market, today’s big names could easily be surpassed over time by a little known tool – feature sets change quickly. Which open source BI tool on this list will be most popular in the years ahead?\n\nWindows XP\n\nThere’s no debate about it: Windows XP is an aging operating system. For those looking to replace it – and yes, it’s time – with an open source operating system, this is the list for you. This survey of open source operating systems includes superstars like Ubuntu along with solid players like Knoppix. Come on, replace that old Windows OS!\n\nFinancial Software\n\nIt makes perfect sense: you’re using financial software to track your expenses, so naturally you’re interested in open source financial software. Open source – much of which is a free download – is made for penny pinchers. The open source financial software in this list may save you, in some cases, hundreds of dollars. A penny saved is a penny earned.\n\nOpen Source Replacements for Expensive Apps\n\nIt’s clear that, as value propositions go, this one’s a no-brainer: replace your expensive apps with low-cost or free open source applications. Certainly there’s debate about feature sets: some commercial software partisans argue that the feature sets for open source applications do not match their commercial counterparts. Undoubtedly the other side disagrees strongly. You can be the judge – download a few open source applications and check them out. Do they compare?\n\nSmall Business Software\n\nOpen source business software is, in many cases, the ideal solution for small businesses. If you’re as cash-strapped as many SMBs, you’ll certainly want to look at this list of open source business software. Bottom line: free or low cost is better than high priced, even if that requires giving up some familiar software choices to explore options that are lesser known. If money is tight, open source business software can often be a useful option.\n\nAccessibility\n\n1. The Accessibility Project\n\nLaunched in 2013, this site aims to provide information on making other websites accessible to people with a variety of impairments, particularly those who are blind. You can read the content at the link above; if you’d like to contribute, visit the project’s GitHub page. Operating System: OS Independent\n\nAccounting\n\n2. Edoceo Imperium\n\nThis web-based accounting package was created with small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in mind. It includes CRM, work order and invoice capabilities as well as standard accounting features. Check out the online demo to see it in action. Operating System: OS Independent\n\n3. FrontAccounting\n\nAnother web-based accounting option for SMBs, FrontAccounting boasts inventory tracking and manufacturing management abilities. It’s been downloaded more than 200,000 times. Operating System: OS Independent\n\n4. GnuCash\n\nGnuCash combines personal finance software with small business accounting software, which some small business owners find helpful. It can track investments, create graphs, import financial data, set up scheduled transactions and perform standard double-entry accounting. Operating System: Windows, Linux, OS X\n\n5. LedgerSMB\n\nLedgerSMB combines ERP and accounting capabilities in a single package, and it also includes a flexible development framework for extending its features. It has been downloaded more than 86,000 times since 2006. Operating System: Windows, Linux, OS X\n\n6. TurboCASH\n\nUsed by more than 80,000 businesses, TurboCASH is a flexible accounting package that compares favorably with QuickBooks and Sage. It was created in the UK but also has a chart of accounts and currency features designed for U.S. businesses. Operating System: Windows\n\nApp Collection\n\n7. OpenDisc\n\nThe OpenDisc project collects many of the most popular open source applications for Windows into one download. You can also get the project on a CD for a donation of $10. Operating System: Windows\n\nAnti-Spam/Email Filtering\n\n8. ASSP\n\nASSP claims to be “the absolute best SPAM fighting weapon that the world has ever known!” It offers easy, browser-based setup and works with most mail servers. Operating System: OS Independent.\n\n9. MailScanner\n\nDownloaded more than 1.3 million times, MailScanner is based on SpamAssassin and works with anti-virus software like ClamAV to protect mail servers at companies or ISPs. Support is available through third-party companies. Operating System: OS Independent.\n\n10. Scrollout F1\n\nThis full-featured mail security solution incorporates anti-spam, anti-virus and other capabilities with an interface that the project creators say is as easy to use as a car radio. Paid support is available. Operating System: Windows, Linux.\n\n11. SpamAssassin\n\nThis Apache project claims to be the “#1 Enterprise Open-Source Spam Filter.” It uses a wide variety of methods to identify and block spam, and it works with nearly all mail servers. Operating System: primarily Linux and OS X, although Windows versions are available.\n\n12. SpamBayes\n\nSpamBayes uses statistical algorithms to calculate the probability that an incoming message is spam, and it adapts over time as spammers change their methods.
