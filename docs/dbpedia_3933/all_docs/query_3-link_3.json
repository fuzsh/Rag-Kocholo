Although, it's been over 10 years since I've supported any FreeBSD type installation, but I still support Linux. Maybe that says something?\n\nA BSD user should chime in and answer that question. I've never used it as a regular PC operating system before, so I can't speak intelligently on why BSD would be a user's choice over Linux.\n\nOne thing I do know about BSD is that it is the grandfather of macOS which descended from NextStep which came out of BSD.

In common parlance, however, Linux is referred to as an operating system because it's easier to say.\n\nLinux or really the GNU tools that allowed it to be built and take all the credit for was started by Richard Stallman being gaged about a password system being installed on the computers where worked with them at MIT. He set out to free the software and proceeded to replace the Unix tools he was used to, he called it the GNU Project (GNU = GNU is Not Unix). A youngster came along from Finland and used the GNU tools the compilers and editors ... to create a clone of something he had worked with called minix, a operating system kernel. He (Linus got all the credit) Richard Stallman not much at all the way it is always referred to. Linux is the kernel that boots the operating system on the computer, the GNU tools allow you to use it for a useful purpose. One without the other is useless until the GNU Project gets the kernel they have had in development for ages (HURD) to be workable as a base of their own to use for an operating system.\n\nBSD refers to Berkeley System Derivative the variant of UNIX it was based on after the shake out in that particular field left it as the only one standing and usable. Due to its licensing actually making it possible for others to use the software. The BSD licence allows use of the code unlike the others who tried to lock it down with no use except with restrictive terms and payments made. It was an interesting time in computers.\n\nOne thing I do know about BSD is that it is the grandfather of macOS which descended from NextStep which came out of BSD.

If both are \"cousins\" why do we need both if they do the same thing?\n\nAnother thing I don't get, is why Linux is so much more popular than FreeBSD although both are FOSS.\n\nAs a gross oversimplification, any changes or additions the code of to GPL software (like Linux) or programs that incorporate GPL code, become GPL themselves. Then anybody who buys or downloads a product with GPL software has to be given the GPL source code. They can then use that code in their own projects, under the terms of the GPL.\n\nThats very interesting. I never knew this, so its like a pay it forward thing. I will only let you use my code if you let others use your code. I guess I finally figured why no company sells Linux based system or a fork of it. I can see Richard Stallman with a big grin in that GPL agreement.\n\nI agree, mostly. Andy Tannenbaum(sp?) was teaching with Minix.

Linux is here, polished, and popular. Why reinvent the wheel?\n\n\"We\" don't need anything.\n\nThe linux team focused on supporting as much hardware as possible, under the GPL. NetBSD had the same goals, but with the BSD license. FreeBSD focused on being rock stable, and was very useful on the server side.\n\nAh, good luck getting any two developers happily working on the same thing. Why are you so concerned that people want to do what they want to do?\n\nThe beauty is you can use and contribute to any of them as you will, for whatever reasons you have. So can anyone else.\n\nAlso, it's not even \"both\". Here's a list of Linux distributions:\n\nFor that matter: https://www.ubuntupit.com/freebsd-vs-linux-20-things-to-know-about-both-the-system/\n\nWhat I understand from you is that FreeBSD is used as a core to build a modified/custom OS of your own? Isn't that what Google did with Linux when they created Android?\n\nI did not put that much time or energy into researching the coreOS or the purpose of the Operating System. I was simply putting in time and research into a product that fulfilled a particular need.\n\nFor myself, it began with enjoying building systems and wanting a feature rich NAS system.\n\nI had Synology systems in place but were looking for future upgrades. So the Synology's were the main backup NAS at an office, and I then made a FreeNAS backup for one office and an unRAID at another.\n\nI sold my personal Synology DS1515+ 5-Bay to my company and replaced my home NAS to a QNAP 9-Bay.\n\nI was then using Meraki Firewalls and Routers at 4 offices for operating those individual office systems as well as their super simple site to site VPN because I need to tie all of these together.\n\nI have moved on to pfSense at each location and have quite a bit of the \"features\" I was wanting.\n\nI was tired of continuously outgrowing my firewall every 1-2 years.\n\nThese were multi-thousand dollar Meraki Routers that have fairly extremely low Site-to-site VPN throughput, add in Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Prevention Systems and now it is cutting down throughput and bandwidth almost in 3rd to half.\n\nMy pfSense Router gave me my lower initial cost of purchase as well as being able to completely handle the type of workloads I throw at them for years and years to come, and with about 1/4 of the initial upfront cost.\n\nThen Meraki wants several thousand per year for them to keep the router, even working. If you didn't pay your sub, your network dies. and it is a paperweight.\n\nAnd then I mentioned how I found out pretty much all of my kids video game systems us FreeBSD as the core OS to run the system.\n\nThis is about it with me.\n\nWhen I need a solution for a problem. I find that. get it in place to take care of the problem.\n\nAfter-wards, if I am still more interested in learning more, I may dive in to a particular new solution I found to understand even more, especially if I set it up to be a \"work-horse-solution\" for the office.\n\nI just do not normally have the time for this once the solution is found. I am typically moving on to solving the next problem.\n\nSo we can all continue receiving paychecks.\n\nI apology that I am not available to fully answer your questions. I can just share my personal stories and may you can pull from it what makes sense with you."
