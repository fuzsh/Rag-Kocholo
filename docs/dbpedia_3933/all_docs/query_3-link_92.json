        "text": "FreeBSD and Linux system are two free, open supply systems. Indeed, their users can simply check and modify the ASCII text file with an absolute freedom. Linux is something you will be able to use for game servers or embedded systems or as desktop OS. FreeBSD was perpetually meant to be an extremely stable server OS.\n\nFree BSD software is same as Free BSD UNIX but not a by-product of UNIX. This software was developed by the Berkeley package Distribution in 1993. FreeBSD ASCII text source code is usually discharged under a permissive BSD license. As numerous set of server-related code is embedded in FreeBSD, it is possible to use it as a mail server, web server, FTP server and as a router.\n\nLinux is UNIX-like, open supply, and community-developed software for computers, servers, mainframes, mobile devices and embedded devices. Linux is packaged in a shape called a Linux distribution (or distro for quick) for each desktop and server use.\n\nAdvantage of FreeBSD\n\nBSD License is less restrictive and it permits distribution of the binary-only source.\n\nFreeBSD is an absolutely free software.\n\nFreeBSD is a complete operating system by itself.\n\nFreeBSD uses ipfw as the firewall.\n\nipfw -q add [rule number] allow tcp from any to any 80 in\n\nipfw -q add [rule number] allow tcp from any to any 443 in\n\nBSD systems boot and reboot faster than Linux.\n\nFreeBSD developers can manage the essential operating systems remotely and efficiently.\n\nA lot of common tools are available which are fully owned by FreeBSD Team.\n\nDisadvantage of FreeBSD\n\nLess community support especially for newbies.\n\nLack of driver support.\n\nThe file system is old.\n\nAdvantage of Linux\n\nStability: Linux doesn’t have to be compelled to be rebooted periodically to take care of performance levels. It doesn’t freeze up or bog down over time as a result of memory leaks.\n\nNetwork friendliness: Linux was developed by a bunch of programmers over the net and has thus provided robust support for network functionality; consumer and server systems are often simply started on any pc running Linux.\n\nLinux uses iptables as the firewall\n\niptables -A INPUT -s 0/0 -d 0/0 -p tcp — dport 80 -j ACCEPT\n\niptables -A INPUT -s 0/0 -d 0/0 -p tcp — dport 443 -j ACCEPT\n\nLinux is very omnipresent and it is widely supported.\n\nLinux has good community support and hardware support.\n\nDisadvantage of Linux\n\nLinux is licensed under GPL. They prevent the distribution of the binary-only source.\n\nLinux has control permission restrictions.\n\nLinux is just a kernel, thus in order to use Linux as an OS, we’d like to decide on any of flavors like RedHat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu.\n\nWith Linux, there are some difficulties while managing a system. Since the different components maintained will be from different sources, Linux developers need to assemble them into groups having the same Linux tools from GNU, due to this its usage is controlled.\n\nFreeBSD and UNIX the two free and open supply systems which share varied similarities yet they are different at some points. Both FreeBSD and UNIX, have a set of options and specifications that make them unique."
