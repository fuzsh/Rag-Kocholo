These controls are commonly depicted as widely known symbols found in a multitude of products, exemplifying what is known as dominant design. Media control symbols are commonly found on both software and physical media players, remote controls, and multimedia keyboards. Their application is described in ISO/IEC 18035. The main symbols date back to the 1960s, with the Pause symbol having reportedly been invented at Ampex during that decade for use on reel-to-reel audio recorder controls, due to the difficulty of translating the word \"pause\" into some languages used in foreign markets. The Pause symbol was designed as a combination of the existing square Stop symbol and the caesura, and was intended to evoke the concept of an interruption or \"stutter stop\".\n\nMPRIS\n\nfreedesktop.org: MPRIS D-Bus Interface Specification - The Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification is a standard D-Bus interface which aims to provide a common programmatic API for controlling media players. It provides a mechanism for discovery, querying and basic playback control of compliant media players, as well as a tracklist interface which is used to add context to the active media item.\n\nMediaPlayer2.Player — MPRIS D-Bus Interface Specification\n\nSoftware\n\nhttps://github.com/acrisci/playerctl - a command-line utility and library for controlling media players that implement the MPRIS D-Bus Interface Specification, like spotify, vlc, audacious, bmp, xmms2, and others. Playerctl makes it easy to bind player actions, such as play and pause, to media keys. For more advanced users, Playerctl provides an introspectable library available in your favorite scripting language that allows more detailed control like the ability to subscribe to media player events or get metadata such as artist and title for the playing track.\n\nPlayerctl at Version 2.0 – dubstepdish\n\nAutomatically pause music on screen lock on Linux\n\nmpris-remote - a utility that controls an MPRIS-capable music player.\n\nhttps://github.com/mackstann/mpris-remote/tree/master - command line tool for interacting with music players that support the mpris spec\n\nhttps://github.com/natsukagami/mpd-mpris - An implementation of the MPRIS protocol for MPD in Go\n\nhttps://github.com/alexdelorenzo/mpris_server - provides adapters to integrate MPRIS support in your media player or device. By supporting MPRIS in your app, you will allow Linux users to control all aspects of playback from the media controllers they already have installed. Whereas existing MPRIS libraries for Python implement clients for apps with existing MPRIS support, mpris_server is a library to implement MPRIS support in apps that don't already have it. If you want to give your media player an MPRIS interface, mpris_server is right for you. mpris_server is a fork of Mopidy-MPRIS that was extended and made into a general purpose library.\n\nhttps://github.com/hugosenari/mpris2 - Python usable definiton of MPRIS2\n\nhttps://github.com/alexdelorenzo/chromecast_mpris - tv Control Chromecasts from Linux and D-Bus\n\nhttps://github.com/cjrh/debussy - CLI emitting json when song changes on Linux.

XMMS stands for X MultiMedia System and can play media files such as MP3, MOD's, WAV and others with the use of Input plugins.XMMS is mainly targeted at music playback, but through thirdparty plugins some rudimentary video capabilities exists, but there are much better systems other than XMMS for video support.It was modeled after winamp from the Windows operating system. XMMS is not a port of Winamp but was written from scratch by Mikael and Peter Alm.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMMS\n\nXMMS2\n\nXMMS2 will: play your music. manage your music library. use collections to help you organise your music as you like. allow you to control it using a variety of clients. run on Linux, *BSD, OS X, Solaris, and Windows.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMMS2\n\nAbraca - a GTK client for the XMMS2 music player which makes managing your music a breeze.\n\nhttps://github.com/Abraca/Abraca\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/a/luminal.org/imms - adaptive playlist plugin, for XMMS, Beep Media Player, Quod Libet, Audacious, etc.\n\nhttp://palbo.github.io/ccx2/ - console player\n\nhttps://github.com/pkunavin/ncxmms2 - an ncurses xmms2 client.

The user interface is similar to winamp or xmms. Alternative user interface also is available.\n\nPotamus\n\nPotamus - a lightweight GTK-based audio player with a simple interface and an emphasis on high audio quality. It was written as a reaction to players like Rhythmbox that use a complex database to keep track of a music collection. My preference instead is to make use of the filesystem for sorting music, so Potamus knows nothing about the files it's playing other than their names, and tries to make it as easy as possible to use your file manager to locate and play music. Potamus is a successor to GNU xhippo, which was in turn inspired by HippoPlayer. It can decode FLAC, Ogg Vorbis, Opus, MPEG audio, and any format supported by the ModPlug, audiofile or FFmpeg libraries (including WAV, Shorten, and various module formats). For MPEG audio playback (including MP3), it uses libmad's high-quality decoder to produce dithered 24-bit output. It can use OSS or ALSA (via libao) for direct output, or can work with JACK, converting sample rates and formats where necessary. It supports 24-bit audio output and gapless playback.\n\n./configure --prefix=SOMEDIR; make; make install # if you've downloaded the tarball autoreconf -vfi # if you've cloned it from git, to create the configure script, etc.\n\nParlatype\n\nParlatype - a minimal audio player for manual speech transcription, written for the GNOME desktop environment.

The first time I thinked about lplayer was for listening podcasts. lplayer can set the speed. I normally listen podcasts a 1.8x. So this option was very important for me. But not only. This audio player must have to avoid silences to play podcasts.\n\nZinf\n\nZinf Audio Player - a simple, but powerful audio player for Linux and Win32. It supports MP3, Ogg/Vorbis, WAV and Audio CD playback, SHOUTcast/Icecast HTTP streaming, RTP streaming, a powerful music browser, theme support and a download manager.

On this website the old project will be referred to as FreeA*p.\n\nMeson\n\nMeson Player - a very convenient audio player if you don't need any flashy GUI to control the playback or manage playlists. You just run it and then forget about it. The player is running in a background. Switching tracks, volume control, loading and saving playlists, all of this can be done via global hotkeys. Therefore, you can control the player while working in any application.\n\nhttps://github.com/alkatrazstudio/meson-player\n\nPitchScope_Player\n\nhttps://github.com/CreativeDetectors/PitchScope_Player - a MP3 player which can also do realtime note detection.\n\nG4Music\n\nhttps://gitlab.gnome.org/neithern/g4music - A fast fluent lightweight music player written in GTK4, with a beautiful and adaptive user interface.\n\nMedium GUI\n\nLXMusic\n\nLXMusic - minimalist music player for LXDE. This is based on xmms2, which is lightweight and has server/client design. The user interface is quite simple, clean, and intuitive. At first glance, it looks similar to my favorite player on Windows – foobar 2000. LXMusic only has very few features, and it can do nothing more than just playing a list of music files. However, this is what’s lacking today, a player which doesn’t try to teach you how to listen your own music files. It just plays! That’s all.\n\nDeaDBeeF\n\nDeaDBeeF - an audio player for GNU/Linux, *BSD, OpenSolaris, Mac OS X, and other UNIX-like systems.\n\nadjacent tracks.\n\nPragha\n\nPragha Music Player - a Lightweight Music Player for GNU/Linux, based on Gtk, sqlite, and completely written in C, constructed to be fast, light, and simultaneously tries to be complete without obstructing the daily work.\n\nhttps://github.com/matiasdelellis/pragha\n\nTauon Music Box\n\nhttps://github.com/Taiko2k/tauonmb - A desktop music player for playback of local audio files.

These features, such as tagging files or burning CDs, generally have a better support in dedicated software. If you are looking for an audio player than can make coffee, then you should stay away from Decibel and give a try to other players (e.g., Amarok, Exaile).\n\nhttps://code.launchpad.net/decibel-audio-player\n\nPogo\n\nPogo - plays your music. Nothing else. It is both fast and easy-to-use. The clear interface uses the screen real-estate very efficiently.

Pogo is a fork of Decibel Audio Player and supports most common audio formats. It is written in Python and uses GTK+ and gstreamer.\n\nhttps://github.com/jendrikseipp/pogo\n\nEina\n\nEina - works like a common portable music player. Just plays what you want to listen.Apart from simplicity, today users expect more from a player than just reading files. Artwork, lyrics, network support, artist data and other music information find their right place in Eina.Plugins can take care of all the extra functionality, since Eina exposes everything from its internals. It's fairly easy to extend the player capabilities and change the way it works inside.
