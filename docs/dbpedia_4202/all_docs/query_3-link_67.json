        "text": "The social science has generally been regarded as a category of science that accommodates solely the disciplines which study Man in relation to his social environment for the purpose of formulating laws, generalisations and more importantly to make predictions on the future actions of Man. Distinct as it is from the other category of science i.e. the pure science which accommodates disciplines that study inanimate objects, the social science as one out of the two categories of science is yet to have a universally accepted number of fields of study that comprises it. But for the sake of this paper, the six major social science disciplines were identified and treated accordingly - Political Science, Economics, Sociology, Anthropology, Psychology and Geography. These fields of study as at today can arguably be said to have developed to an appreciable level. Nevertheless, their development, in particular political science, is tied to the other social science disciplines. This paper therefore takes a critical look at the origin of some of the concepts, theories, scholars etc. in political science from the five social science disciplines mentioned above, the present status of political science; as well as the pathway the discipline is following. In this research paper, it was discovered that political science indeed has its root in the other five social science disciplines. But as touching the direction of political science, the discipline, based on the dynamic nature of Man and social problems, would dwell more on the interdisciplinary approach in order to have a holistic understanding of them, be able to make predictions, solve and if possible, control and forestall the unacceptable actions and occurrence of the former and latter respectively. The historical and comparative approaches were adopted in the course of this study with secondary sources of qualitative data as part of the research methodology.\n\nPhilosophies of social science, human geography and planning introduces learners who will not have encountered university philosophy before with key ideas and debates in the philosophy of social science and critically relates them to debates and examples of human geography and planning. On completion of this course learners will be able to: (1) Recall an exciting new approach to the social and behavioural sciences including theoretical argument, methodological guidelines, and examples of practical application; (2) Understand that the strength of social sciences lies in its rich, reflexive analysis of values and power, essential to the social and economic development of any society, rather than misplaced attempts at emulation of the natural sciences; (3) Contextualize social inquiry, hinging on intellectual insights of both Aristotle and Foucault, to give new meaning to the concept of praxis, social and political relevance and inspiring how to make democracy work; and (4) Critically relate these insights to debates and discussions in human geography and planning, with reference to pertinent examples.\n\n\"Theory without practice is empty, while practice without theory is blind\" The truth of the above statement manifests itself in the value of social science's research methods to society which is the focus of this work. Therefore, the work argues the thesis that social science's methods of investigation into the social life of society remains a potent weapon in the hands of practical men in their societal re-engineering endeavours, despite its shortcoming. This means that apart from showing the main features and constraints of social science's research methods, this work also aims to bring to limelight the tremendous contributions of social science's research methods to social re-engineering.\n\nThe research in social sciences is still very much present in the academic world. This paper is another effort that tries to shed light on the methodology of research in social sciences with the detection of obstacles that interfere with its use, especially regarding values. This paper will explain the nature of research practice in social sciences as well as the difficulties regarding the research method, which would define the objective holding that a researcher has to implement. Furthering from the subject of study is, for that matter, needed especially regarding the values, because very little research in this field is of so-called \"pure nature\". For that matter, very few people explore the methodology by itself because most of the research is applied research, which is widely used in multiple disciplines. Each science uses different research methods in the areas of its research. They use the methods and procedures that were developed by the research methodologists with the goal of increment of understanding of their own sciences and further development of the base of social knowledge, as well as strengthening and improving their own science. This callback on the methodology of research is focused, primarily on, the aspect of scientific research, and that is the very methodology the scientific research follows with the goal of eliminating mistakes that quite a few researchers make, disregarding the difference between the method and the methodology. A great number of definitions of methodology confirm its complex nature but also state the fact that methodology can be observed with theoretical, technical, and organizational aspects. The theoretical aspect implies the questioning of laid-out hypotheses, theories, comprehensions, styles, terminology, etc. Technical aspects relate to the process of gathering, observing, arranging, and measuring the data, while the organizational aspect relates to securing the rational technology in implementing scientific research."
