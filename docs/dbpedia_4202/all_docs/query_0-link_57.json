Our objective was to assess the prevalence and outcomes of children admitted to pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) with acute neurological insults.\n\nDesign\n\nProspective study.\n\nSetting\n\nMulticenter (n=107 PICUs) and multinational (23 countries, 79% in North America and Europe).\n\nPatients\n\nChildren aged 7d–17y admitted to the ICU with new traumatic brain injury, stroke, cardiac arrest, central nervous system infection or inflammation, status epilepticus, spinal cord injury, hydrocephalus, or brain mass.\n\nInterventions\n\nNone.\n\nMeasurements and main results\n\nWe evaluated the prevalence and outcomes of children with pre-determined acute neurological insults. Child and center characteristics were recorded. Unfavorable outcome was defined as change in pre-post insult Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC) score ≥ 2 or death at hospital discharge or 3 months, whichever came first. Screening data yielded overall prevalence of 16.2%. Of 924 children with acute neurological insults, cardiac arrest (23%) and traumatic brain injury (19%) were the most common. All-cause mortality at hospital discharge was 12%. Cardiac arrest subjects had highest mortality (24%), and TBI subjects had the most unfavorable outcomes (49%). The most common neurological insult was infection/inflammation in South America, Asia, and the single African site but cardiac arrest in the remaining regions.\n\nConclusions\n\nNeurological insults are a significant pediatric international health issue. They are frequent and contribute substantial morbidity and mortality. These data suggest a need for an increased focus on acute critical neurological diseases in infants and children including additional research, enhanced availability of clinical resources, and the development of new therapies.\n\nKeywords: child, epidemiology, neurocritical care, outcomes, international\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAcute neurological insults due to trauma and non-traumatic cause are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children.1–3 Surviving children are at increased risk of cognitive, physical, and psychological disability, and their families suffer marked emotional, social, and financial strain.4–11 Treatment recommendations are largely based on level II or lower evidence due to the lack of high quality prospective research.12–14 Cross-sectional epidemiological data can guide allocation of resources to prevent and/or treat these conditions and optimize prospective study design of clinical investigations.15\n\nThe Prevalence of Acute critical Neurological disease in children: a Global Epidemiological Assessment (PANGEA) research program was established with an ultimate goal to provide data to inform clinical research and health care priorities that will lead to future breakthroughs in improving outcome for all children. The aim of this initial report was to describe and better understand the prevalence and outcome of children with acute neurological insults in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in largely academic and resource-rich settings.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nPANGEA research program\n\nAt the inception of the PANGEA research program ({\"type\":\"clinical-trial\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"NCT02381977\",\"term_id\":\"NCT02381977\"}}NCT02381977), an international steering committee was formed, and individual PICUs were recruited from professional networks that included: Pediatric Acute Lung Injury VEntilation (PALIVE) study from North America and Europe;16 the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigators (PALISI) and the Pediatric Neurocritical Care Research Group (PNCRG) from North America; the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group; the European Society for Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care; the Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Society; and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies. Participation was voluntary, and no remuneration was given for involvement. Investigators needed to be fluent in English and have the ability to record data using the study’s internet-based platform. Local regulatory approval was obtained at each study site. The Data Coordinating Center was accepted as an exempt protocol by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board. All centers reported to have obtained a waiver of informed consent, allowing for prevalence calculation.\n\nCase definitions\n\nThe international steering committee agreed on the case definitions for acute neurological insult in the critically ill child (Supplementary Data). The inclusion criteria were: 7 days to 17 years old on the study day; admission to the PICU; and, a primary diagnosis of traumatic brain injury, stroke, cardiac arrest, central nervous system (CNS) infection or inflammation, status epilepticus, spinal cord lesion, hydrocephalus, or brain mass. If a child had suffered a perinatal or remote (> 6 months prior to hospitalization) CNS insult without a new, acute neurological insult they did not meet the inclusion criteria.\n\nPoint prevalence study design\n\nFour study dates during a 1 year period were chosen, avoiding weekends and holidays to encourage participation: 29 November, 2011; 28 February, 2012; 22 May, 2012; and 24 July, 2012. Centers were instructed to screen all patients in their PICU at 9:00 am local time. Centers recorded the number of children meeting study inclusion criteria, and all but 10 centers provided the total number of children in their PICU on the study day. Based on feedback from study centers, hydrocephalus and brain mass categories were added at the second study date.\n\nA Case Report Form (CRF) with inclusion and exclusion criteria, study definitions, and guide to data collection was provided to centers and posted as a secure electronic-CRF on the study website (www.pangeastudy.com). CRF composition was based on prior studies, perceived needs of the research community, and input by the Steering Committee, and feedback from PALISI and PNCRG members. Professionals at the Biomedical Telematic Laboratory of the Health Respiratory Network of Fronds de Recherche Sante Quebec, University of Sherbrooke, Canada, designed and maintained the secure website and securely transferred collected study data to the DCC. Data were collected on hospital and study subject characteristics, details about the child’s acute neurological insult, monitoring used, therapies, testing, and outcomes. Details on monitoring and treatments are not included in this manuscript but will be part of secondary data analysis. Components of the Pediatric Index of Mortality-2 (PIM2) scores were embedded into the CRF to allow determination of mortality risk.17\n\nOutcomes\n\nPICU prevalence of acute neurologic insult was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, outcome status using the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC) score (unfavorable outcome = change in PCPC pre-insult to study endpoint ≥ 2 or death), lengths of hospital and ICU stay, frequency of new morbidity, and disposition at PICU and hospital discharge. The study’s endpoint was hospital discharge or 3 months after the study day, whichever came first. PCPC is a practical, gross measure of neurological status that performs well in comparison with other validated testing instruments.18 More detailed neuropsychological outcomes were not possible in this study. Centers collected information on the following a priori-specified newly acquired morbidities during this hospital stay: hypertonia, dysautonomia, and placement of a CSF shunt, surgically placed feeding tube, or tracheostomy tube. These morbidities were chosen by the PI and Steering Committee with consideration of prior literature and potential for long-term impact on patients and families, recognizing that the list is not complete and was developed prior to the availability of the Functional Status Score, recently validated in children.19,20 Cause of death was taken from the death certificate.\n\nData management\n\nData entry was performed by site ICU faculty, ICU fellows, research assistants, or study coordinators depending on resources available at the site. Primary data collection and data quality were managed by site PI. Centers were provided with the CRF that included the study protocol with written instructions, and were given opportunities to discuss questions electronically or over the phone. Centers were provided with regular study updates via email. Personnel from the Clinical Research, Investigation, and Systems Modeling of Acute illness (CRISMA) Center (Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh) assisted in secondary data quality monitoring along with the study PI and coordinator. Data were screened for missing or implausible information and queries were issued to the site.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nDescriptive statistics are presented as median (interquartile range [IQR]). Data were analyzed using Kruskall-Wallis, Mann-Whitney, Fisher’s exact, and chi-square tests as appropriate. The numerator and denominator for the prevalence calculation came from the screening form. Ten sites did not provide complete screening data (although they did submit all other forms for children who met entry criteria) and thus were excluded from prevalence calculations. Statistical analysis by region was not performed due to the small number of centers and subjects of some regions. The majority of variables had less than 10% missing data, and missing data were not imputed (thus sample sizes for variables and denominators varied slightly). All p-values were two-sided, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20 (Armonk, NY, USA) and Stata version 12 (College Station, TX, USA) were used for statistical analyses. This article was written according to the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology statement.21\n\nRESULTS\n\nStudy center characteristics\n\nOf the 107 hospitals participating in the PANGEA consortium, 79% were located in North America or Europe (see and Acknowledgments for full list of centers and site personnel). Eighty-six percent of collaborating PICU’s were affiliated with a university academic medical center, 75% were located in pediatric hospitals, and there was a wide range in the number of PICU beds and admissions per year ( ). The median number of PICU faculty was 8 (6–14), and 69% of centers provide 24-hour, in-house faculty PICU coverage. Seventy-four per cent of hospitals reported a PICU fellowship training program. Forty-eight per cent of the centers reported that they provided a dedicated neurocritical care service while 10% had a PICU follow-up clinic. Most centers were capable of intracranial pressure (93%) and continuous electroencephalography monitoring (78%), but only 14% of centers were able to invasively monitor brain tissue oxygenation.\n\nTable 1\n\nMedian (interquartile range)\n\nor n (%)\n\n(n) denotes number of\n\ncenters responding per queryNorth\n\nAmerica\n\nn=50 (47)\n\nsitesEurope\n\nn=34 (32)Oceania\n\nn=6 (6)South\n\nAmerica\n\nn=11 (10)Asia\n\nn=5 (5)Africa\n\nn=1 (1)Total\n\nn=107No. pediatric hospital beds\n\n(n=99)201 (118–\n\n296)181 (110–\n\n280)248 (189–\n\n250)46 (24–230)90 (85–170)279189 (100–\n\n289)No. pediatric ICU beds\n\n(n=101)29 (14–44)13 (10–18)14 (10–18)11 (7–16)9 (8–25)1816 (11–26)University-affiliated (n=101)40 (82)33 (100)6 (100)5 (63)3 (60)1 (100)88 (86)Pediatric-only hospital\n\n(n=96)41 (87)21 (70)6 (100)1 (14)2 (40)1 (100)72 (75)ICU admissions/yr, No.\n\ncenters (%) (n=98)1–2501 (2)4 (13)0 (0)2 (25)2 (40)-9 (9)251–5003 (6)10 (32)0 (0)5 (63)0 (0)-18 (18)501–7508 (17)7 (23)2 (33)0 (0)1 (20)-18 (18)751–10006 (13)6 (19)1 (17)1 (13)1 (20)-15 (15)1001–12506 (13)2 (7)2 (33)0 (0)1 (20)1 (100)12 (12)> 125123 (49)2 (7)1 (17)0 (0)0 (0)-26 (27)ICU PersonnelTotal pediatric ICU faculty\n\n(n=100)11 (7–17)7 (6–10)7 (5–7)18 (9–27)4 (3–5)48 (6–14)No. faculty in ICU per day\n\n(n=100)2 (1–3)2 (2–4)2 (1–2)4 (3–6)1 (1–3)12 (2–3)ICU faculty coverage 24\n\nhr/day (n=100)27 (56)25 (78)4 (67)7 (88)5 (100)1 (100)69 (65)Pediatric ICU fellowship\n\nprogram (n=97)32 (67)27 (87)5 (83)3 (43)4 (100)1 (100)72 (74)Pediatric ICU fellows (n=97)5 (0–11)2 (1–6)3 (2–12)0 (0–2)4 (2–6)63 (0–8)No. pediatric ICU fellows in\n\nICU per day (n=98)2 (0–2)1 (1–2)1 (1–3)0 (0–1)1 (1–3)51 (0–3)Pediatric residents in\n\npediatric ICU (n=99)42 (88)26 (81)2 (33)5 (71)4 (80)1 (100)80 (81)No. residents in ICU per day\n\n(n=99)3 (2–4)2 (1–4)0 (0–2)2 (0–4)1 (1–2)23 (1–4)Physician extenders in\n\npediatric ICU (n=97)32 (65)20 (65)2 (33)3 (50)3 (60)0 (0)60 (62)No. physician extenders in\n\npediatric ICU per day (n=97)1 (0–2)1 (0–3)0 (0–1)1 (0–2)1 (0–1)01 (0–2)Neurosurgeons available 24 h\n\n(n=34)12 (80)8 (73)1 (100)3 (75)2 (100)1 (100)27 (79)Neurocritical care service\n\n(n=100)17 (35)21 (66)6 (100)1 (14)2 (40)1 (100)48 (48)ICU follow-up clinic (n=72)5 (16)1 (4)0 (0)1 (25)0 (0)0 (0)7 (10)Center monitoring and\n\ntesting availability (n=101)Central venous catheter49 (100)32 (100)6 (100)8 (100)5 (100)1 (100)101 (100)Arterial catheter49 (100)31 (97)6 (100)8 (100)5 (100)1 (100)100 (99)Peripherally-inserted central\n\ncatheter49 (100)27 (84)6 (100)8 (100)4 (80)1 (100)95 (94)Intracranial pressure\n\nmonitoring48 (98)29 (91)6 (100)7 (88)3 (60)1 (100)94 (93)Continuous\n\nelectroencephalography48 (98)16 (50)5 (83)6 (75)3 (60)1 (100)79 (78)Near-infrared spectroscopy33 (69)16 (52)4 (67)2 (25)0 (0)1 (100)56 (57)Somatosensory evoked\n\npotential18 (37)14 (44)4 (67)2 (25)1 (20)0 (0)39 (39)Swan-Ganz catheter26 (53)2 (6)1 (17)3 (38)0 (0)0 (0)32 (32)Jugular venous oxygen\n\nsaturation6 (13)6 (19)0 (0)4 (50)0 (0)0 (0)16 (16)Brain tissue oxygenation13 (27)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)1 (100)14 (14)Cerebral blood flow5 (10)1 (3)0 (0)1 (13)1 (20)1 (100)9 (9)Cerebral microdialysis6 (12)0 (0)0 (0)1 (13)1 (20)0 (0)8 (8)\n\nPoint prevalence and subject characteristics\n\nParticipating centers who provided complete data (n=97) screened 5,135 children over the 4 study days and 831 met study criteria with resulting prevalence of acute neurological insults of 16.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 15.2, 17.2)). Total number of subjects enrolled from all 107 centers was 924. The number of subjects enrolled per site ranged from 0–113 over the four study dates. Thirteen centers enrolled 20 or more subjects into the study. Subjects encompassed the full age range (median [IQR] 48 [9–120] months). Females accounted for the 41% of subjects, and 51% were Caucasian, non-Hispanic ethnicity ( ). Sixty-two percent of subjects had public insurance or universal health care and 4% had no health insurance. Fifty-eight per cent of subjects had a comorbid condition with neurological being most common (29%), and 61% of subjects had normal PCPC scores before this neurological event and ICU

Children admitted after a cardiac arrest had the highest mortality (24%) and Pediatric Index of Mortality (6.6 [2.4–20.6]), both p<0.001 vs. other neurologic insults ( ). Cause of death was provided in 49 subjects who died. The most common causes of death were withdrawal of support due to poor neurological status (25%), brain death (11%), and cardiovascular failure (10%). Of subjects with a pre-ICU PCPC of 1 (no disability) with PCPC at hospital discharge or 3 months available, 211/475 (44%) remained PCPC of 1. The remainder of subjects with a pre-ICU PCPC of 1 had PCPC 2 (18%), PCPC 3 (11%), PCPC 4 (13%), PCPC 5 (4%) and PCPC 6 (9%) at the later time point. Subjects with traumatic brain injury had the highest rate of normal baseline PCPC (82%). Thirty-two percent of subjects had unfavorable outcome, which was most common in subjects with traumatic brain injury (49%) (p<0.001).\n\nHospital and PICU lengths of stay were 22 (8–55) and 13 (4–33) days, respectively, and were longest in children with cardiac arrest (both p<0.001). At the study’s end point, 58% of subjects were discharged home, and 17% were admitted to an in-patient rehabilitation center. Subjects with traumatic brain injury and spinal cord lesion had the highest frequency of rehabilitation disposition (28% and 37% respectively).\n\nThe frequency of new morbidities differed by insult. Feeding tubes were most frequently placed in children with cardiac arrest (30%), and tracheostomy tubes were most frequently placed in children with spinal cord lesion (33%).\n\nRegional data\n\nSubject and PICU characteristics varied by region, including age, type of insurance, number of PICU beds, and neurocritical care service ( , , and ). Prevalence of acute neurologic insults was highest in North America (18.0 [16.7,19.3]) and Africa (15.8 [6.0,31.3]) and lowest in Asia (9.8 [6.1,14.7]) and Europe (12.7 [10.7,14.8]). The most common acute neurological insult was cardiac arrest in North America, Europe, and Oceania while CNS infection/inflammation were most prevalent in South America, Asia, and Africa (Supplemental Figure). PIM2 scores were highest in Oceania and lowest in South America and Asia. Lengths of stay were longest in Africa and shortest in Oceania and Asia. Mortality was 10–14% except at the single center in Africa, where no subjects died, but 50% had unfavorable outcome.\n\nTable 4\n\nMedian (interquartile\n\nrange) or n (%)North\n\nAmerica\n\nn=661 (72)\n\nsubjectsEurope\n\nn=156 (17)Oceania\n\nn=42 (5)South\n\nAmerica\n\nn=37 (4)Asia\n\nn=22 (2)Africa\n\nn=6 (1)Overall\n\nn=924Prevalence (95% CI)118.0\n\n(16.7,19.3)12.7\n\n(10.7,14.8)13.9\n\n(9.4,19.6)13.5\n\n(9.0,19.2)9.8\n\n(6.1,14.7)15.8\n\n(6.0,31.3)16.2\n\n(15.2,17.2)InsultCardiac arrest155 (23)38 (24)10 (24)6 (16)6 (27)0 (0)215 (23)Traumatic brain injury120 (18)34 (22)7 (17)7 (19)2 (9)1 (17)171 (19)Status epilepticus113 (17)26 (17)8 (19)6 (16)4 (18)0 (0)157 (17)CNS infection/\n\ninflammation96 (15)21 (13)8 (19)8 (22)8 (36)3 (50)144 (16)Brain mass64 (10)9 (6)1 (2)5 (14)1 (5)1 (17)81 (9)Stroke60 (9)17 (11)6 (14)2 (5)1 (5)0 (0)86 (9)Hydrocephalus30 (5)7 (4)2 (5)3 (8)0 (0)0 (0)42 (5)Spinal cord injury23 (3)4 (3)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)1 (17)28 (3)Risk of Mortality and\n\nOutcomesPIM23.1 (1.1–6.1)3.6 (1.3–7.7)5.6 (3.3–\n\n13.5)1.9 (0.8–4.0)1.8 (0.8–4.0)3.2 (0.9–3.9)3.2 (1.1–6.4)Hospital LOS, d21 (8–54)30 (11–75)23 (9–65)27 (8–57)19 (9–22)50 (38–63)22 (8–55)ICU LOS, d13 (4–33)13 (5–40)8 (4–23)15 (2–26)11 (5–20)27 (11–42)13 (4–33)Mortality75 (12)20 (14)4 (10)4 (13)2 (11)0 (0)105 (12)Unfavorable outcome184 (32)49 (40)7 (22)5 (22)0 (0)3 (50)248 (32)\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThere are three chief findings of this study: 1) Acute neurological insults are common among PICU patients, with global hypoxia-ischemia due to cardiac arrest being the most frequent insult; 2) The consequences of acute neurological insults are serious: mortality was 4 to 6 times that of published PICU mortality rates19; subjects had long lengths of stay, and survivors frequently acquired new morbidities; and 3) Many regional differences exist among center and subject characteristics with acute neurological insults.\n\nOur study population, and therefore our findings and implications, largely reflect critically ill children admitted to ICU’s in academic pediatric hospitals in North America, Europe, and Oceania. The prevalence of acute neurological insults is consistent with an analysis of 3 million pediatric hospital discharges in 11 U.S. states by Moreau et al in which children with neurological insults prompted 10% of pediatric hospital admissions but were responsible for 3 times the proportion of pediatric ICU admissions, longer lengths of stay, higher mortality, and higher cost versus children with non-neurological diagnoses.2 Factors that may affect prevalence include the relatively long lengths of stay of children with acute neurological insults (also seen in Moreau et al), and occurrence of adverse events associated with long lengths of stay and severe illness (e.g., hospital acquired infection) or additional organ insults/injuries (e.g., renal failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome); though these were not assessed in PANGEA.2,22 The frequency of new morbidities including the need for new surgical technological supports was high, especially in children with cardiac arrest.\n\nCardiac arrest, the neurological insult with the highest mortality rate, was also the most common insult overall. Cardiac arrest causes global hypoxia-ischemia, which can lead to varying degrees of post-resuscitation syndrome in which brain injury is often the most significant organ affected long term.23 Notably, other neurological insults are associated with organ injury outside the CNS, which can affect outcome.24–26 Traumatic brain injury was the second most common insult overall in PANGEA, and unintentional injury is the leading cause of death for children aged 10–19 years worldwide.27 Although traumatic brain injury subjects had the highest frequency of unfavorable outcome, children with neurological insults often have great potential for rehabilitation, and assessment of longer-term outcomes is needed.28\n\nThe growth of pediatric neurocritical care services in PICUs and development of a pediatric neurocritical care research network reflect the specialty’s acknowledgement and commitment to improving outcomes for children with acute neurologic insults.29–31 In PANGEA, nearly half of centers reported having a neurocritical care service (of variable make-up), more than double that of a recent survey.32 Data are needed to elucidate the optimal configuration and integration of neurocritical care services that affect outcomes.29,30,33,34 Few centers reported having ICU follow-up clinics, an innovative multidisciplinary effort to address recovery from critical illness.35\n\nAlthough exploratory in this study, regional epidemiological and center differences are important to investigate before planning prospective research studies, allocating health care resources, and developing advocacy programs.36–39 For example, CNS infection/inflammation was the most frequent neurological insult in South America, Asia, and the single African site compared with cardiac arrest in the remaining regions. Overall prevalence of acute neurologic insult was highest in North America, nearly double that found in Asian centers, but not the highest length of stay. Centers in Oceania had the highest median risk of mortality scores but not the highest unadjusted mortality rate. Regions showed differences in patient age, sex, and health insurance status, variables associated with outcome40–42. Additionally, regions differed in terms of monitoring and testing capabilities and numbers of personnel providing care in the ICU and in a neurocritical care service, and hospital beds. These findings speak to the idea that the optimal delivery of health care for neurocritical care patients may differ regionally.\n\nThese findings, taken together with a dearth of efficacious neuroprotective therapies and overall lack of high quality evidence to support care, represent a compelling case for the need for increased research and healthcare resources to assist in improving outcomes for children with acute neurological insults. Transformational ideas to address these issues are critically needed.43,44\n\nStudy Limitations\n\nThe strengths and limitations of the point prevalence/cross-sectional method of study have been reviewed and limitations include: 1) findings lack cause and effect conclusiveness; rather serving as more descriptive purposes; and 2) potential underestimation of rapidly fatal disease processes and infrequently used medications and interventions.45 Centers participating in PANGEA are from middle and high-income regions. Therefore, our results are not fully representative of the global health problem of children with neurological insult in need of pediatric critical care in resource-limited settings where most child mortality occurs. PANGEA is also conducting research into the epidemiology and outcomes of acute neurological insult in these settings.46,47 Children who died prior to reaching medical care and children with milder injuries who did not require ICU resources were not included in this study. Most participating ICUs were academic, reflecting regionalization typical of pediatric critical care but may limit the generalization of findings. Unfavorable outcome was based on change in PCPC score, which may be less informative in infants than in older children. The wide range of regions and centers collecting PCPC data using the medical chart may have limited its reliability. The deliberate avoidance of choosing study dates on weekends and major holidays may increase the chance of sampling bias. This study focused on primary neurologic insults; inclusion of subjects with secondary neurologic insults, a common cause of mortality and morbidity in critically ill children, would also be valuable to inform our long term objective of improving outcomes for these children.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nChildren with acute neurological insults are common in ICUs and are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates and prolonged ICU stays, posing significant challenges to public, family, and individual health. These data suggest a vital need for resources to assist in the challenge of improving outcomes for these children throughout the span of the periods of emergency care through to rehabilitation.\n\nSupplementary Material\n\nSupplemental Data File _.doc_ .tif_ pdf_ etc.__1\n\nSupplemental figure.
