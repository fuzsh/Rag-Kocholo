        "text": "Ákos Rózmann's six hour work Tolv Stationer (12 Stations) is being released in its entirety by Editions Mego in a 7CD set. Mego released part of the work by the Hungarian-Swedish electroacoustic composer in 2012 as a 2LP set, and this collects the entire work, which he began work on in 1978 and completed in 2001.\n\nThe first phase, made between 1978–1980 was composed using traditional musique concrète techniques: speed variations and tape cutting and splicing. The last four stations, which were made between 1998–2001 use some digital technology such as processing and keyboard. The final part of the piece is called \"The Celebrators\", a title which – according to a conversation with the composer related by musician and studio director of Stockholm's EMS, Mats Lindström – Rózmann intended to communicate that \"the merriment you hear is false, it is not genuine, it is empty.” Rózmann also suggested that 12 Stations was a sonic interpretation of the Tibetan wheel of life."
