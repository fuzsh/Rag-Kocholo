        "text": "In this post I will walk through the process of integrating and using the ChatGPT-4o API to create a very simple AI-powered travel assistant. I will use python as programming language. I will be using Python as the programming language.\n\nStep 1: Initializing the OpenAI API Client\n\nFirst, ensure you have the OpenAI Python package installed. If not, you can install it via pip:\n\npip install openai\n\nNext, you‚Äôll need to import openai library and use your api key. Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual OpenAI API key, you can create it on https://platform.openai.com/api-keys:\n\nimport openai\n\n# Initialize the OpenAI API client\n\nopenai.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'\n\nStep 2: Creating the Travel Advice Function\n\nWe‚Äôll define a function get_travel_advice that takes a city name as input and returns a list of popular places to visit in that city. The function constructs a prompt for the AI and sends it to the ChatGPT-4o model.Copy code\n\ndef get_travel_advice(city_name):\n\nprompt = f\"Here is the complete list of popular places to visit in {city_name}.\"\n\nresponse = openai.chat.completions.create(\n\nmodel=\"gpt-4o\",\n\nmessages=[\n\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful AI travel assistant. You will give advices about places to visit\"},\n\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n\n]\n\n)\n\nadvice = response.choices[0].message.content\n\nreturn advice\n\nStep 3: Implementing the Main Function\n\nThe main function will prompt the user to input a city name, call get_travel_advice with this city name, and print the advice provided by the AI.\n\ndef main():\n\ncity_name = input(\"Which city would you like to know the popular places to visit: \")\n\nadvice = get_travel_advice(city_name)\n\nprint(f\"\\n{advice}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\nmain()\n\nRunning the Application\n\nWhen you run this script, the application will ask for the name of a city and then display the list of popular places to visit, as generated by the ChatGPT-4o model.\n\nHere‚Äôs a sample output when the city ‚ÄúIstanbul‚Äù is provided:\n\nWhich city would you like to know the popular places to visit: Istanbul\n\nSure, Istanbul is a city rich in history and culture, offering a plethora of interesting sites to visit.
