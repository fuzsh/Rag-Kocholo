        "text": "The history of the Gallipoli campaign has been contested in Turkey for many decades. The commemorations of the Ottoman naval victory of 18 March point to Staff Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Kemal (later Atatürk) as ‘the only man, the only commanding officer’. Yet, this official narrative contradicts Atatürk’s own almost contemporary version, where his role was minimal on that day. On the other hand, Mustafa Kemal later tried, for political and career reasons, to highlight his role in the land operations commencing 25 April. While he was fairly unsuccessful in his efforts to appoint himself to a decision-making position within the Young Turk regime, historians on the Allied side (Bean, Churchill and General Aspinall-Oglander), turned him into ‘the Man of Destiny’. The myth grew in the turbulent international relations of the early 1930s and has been consolidated since.\n\nThe Battle of Gallipoli/Çanakkale or the Dardanelles Campaign as one of the greatest catastrophe of World War I (WWI) and major Axis victory, apart from Turkey, received little attention in the history textbooks of European countries until recently. It was most likely neglected because the Allies emerged victorious of WWI in aggregate terms. The belligerents from many nations in the Battle of Çanakkale, especially from the Balkans, ended up in the camp which they fought against – the victorious Allies. The sacrifice in that battle went missing for taking part and falling for the “wrong side.” In such a vacuum, the suffering, pride and legacy of the battle remained rightly to be exploited by Turkey to the present day. The aftermath impact of the battle was the establishment of new nation states among the Allies fighting mainly under the command of British Commonwealth, then the event was silenced. Its use by Turkey due to the territory in which the battle took place for a national pride and subsequent nationalism, does not imply that the Turks had absolute or exclusive role in waging that war. Looking more closely at the evidence, events, causes, course and consequences of the time, makes it more clear that what is presented as a Turkish sacrifice and victory, was a participation of multinational defenders with German and Austro-Hungarian support. This paper aims at unfolding some crucial aspects of the Battle in Gallipoli which in modern times show a tendency of sharing the contribution by many nations, Albanians in particular, as an inspiration of alliances not for future wars, but as a common heritage for longer term perspective and peace. Keywords: Ottoman Empire, Battle of Gallipoli, Turkey, WWI, Allies, nation states.\n\nIn the twentieth century, submarines came to the forefront of naval strategy. This secret and silent weapon moved from being an experimental project into the reality of naval battles, and eventually became a symbol of deterrence. Initially given tactical duties such as coastal defence and blockade running, submarines were quick to prove their strategic significance during the First World War, especially in Gallipoli. Throughout the campaign, Allied submarines compelled Ottoman defenders increasingly to rely on land and railway transportation, which cost six times more than seaborne supplies. Disruptions to the flow of ammunition and other supplies to Ottoman troops resulted in delays to counter-offensives and contributed significantly to the heavy rates of attrition suffered by the Turkish defenders. In addition, the submarine campaign substantially contributed to food shortages in Istanbul, then the Ottoman capital. This alone was proof of the concept that submarines could effectively be employed as strategic weapons of industrial war.\n\nThe Gallipoli campaign occupies an important place in modern Turkish history, a position reinforced by the release of new publications and the construction of additional monuments to mark the centenary of the conflict. However, these are comparatively recent developments as, just decades ago, the Gallipoli campaign was not regarded as significant to the foundation of the Turkish Republic nor as a powerful source of national identity. While popular Turkish remembrance and commemoration of the campaign began with the wartime propaganda and myth-making of the period, the Turkish War of Independence proved more significant to the national consciousness, inspiring its own particular myths and legends. Yet, with the passage of time, official military histories, personal war narratives, the construction of the Dardanelles Martyrs' Memorial in the early 1950s and the official campaign of the 1980s to create a more articulated Gallipoli history proved instrumental in establishing Gallipoli as crucial to the foundation narrative. Alongside this, recent political and sociocultural developments have also seen the creation of an alternative Islamic myth (with the controversy that accompanies it) while reinforcing the omnipresence of Gallipoli in Turkish history and national consciousness. The Gallipoli campaign occupies an important place in modern Turkish history. From both the official Turkish and popular perspective, it is regarded not only as a magnificent victory, but also as signifying the birth of the new Turkish nation which emerged from the ruins of the Ottoman Empire. The centenary of the Gallipoli campaign has prompted the publication of large numbers of Turkish language books on various aspects of the campaign – a trend that would have been most unlikely just three decades ago. Indeed Gallipoli has earned its prominent position in Turkish history only after a lengthy and arduous journey, having long remained solely of interest to Turkish military officers and a small group of enthusiasts. Only official military historians and veterans produced books and articles and these were consumed by a relatively small audience. Even the construction of monuments and cemeteries was a protracted and difficult process. In contrast to Britain, Australia and New Zealand, Turkish observance and commemoration of the Gallipoli campaign was observed on a single day – 18 March – and was for many years a local affair, only becoming\n\nAnzac Battlefield explores the transformation of Gallipoli's landscape in antiquity, during the famed battles of the First World War, and in the present day. Drawing on archival, archaeological and cartographic material, this book unearths the deep history of the Gallipoli peninsula and sets the Gallipoli campaign in a broader cultural and historical context. The opening chapters explore the physical landscape of the Gallipoli peninsula and the history of the Dardanelles waterway. This is followed by an examination of trench warfare, military engineering and what remains of the Anzac battlefield. The book presents the results of an original archaeological survey, the research for which was supported by the Australian, New Zealand and Turkish governments. The survey examines materials from both sides of the battlefield, and sheds new light on the environment in which Anzac and Turkish soldiers endured the conflict. The closing chapters trace the transition of Anzac from battlefield to cemetery and connect past and present through accounts of the evolution of Turkish and Anzac commemoration. Richly illustrated with both Ottoman and Anzac archival images and maps, as well as original maps and photographs of the landscape and archaeological findings, Anzac Battlefield is an important contribution to our understanding of Gallipoli and its landscape of war and memory."
