        "text": "Participants\n\nA total of 36 female participants, between 18 and 45 years of age, were recruited for this study. The participant groups consisted of 18 healthy controls (CON) and 18 individuals with a recent history of anorexia but currently in the process of recovering from AN (RAN). The RAN participants were recruited from the Dallas, TX area. All RAN participants had maintained a minimum body mass index (BMI) >17.5 and had menstrual cycles for at least 2 months, with no reported binging or purging behaviors during the previous month. All RAN subjects had met full criteria for AN within the previous 2 years; this time period was chosen because several studies have shown that psychological recovery from anorexia lags the physical or physiological weight gain by at least 2 years (Strober et al., 1997; Bachner-Melman et al., 2006; Bardone-Cone et al., 2010). Ten of the RAN subjects had maintained a stable weight with menses and BMI > 19 for over 6 months. The other eight RAN subjects had maintained BMIs exceeding 17.5 for only 3–6 months. Eleven of the RAN subjects had the restricting subtype and seven had the binge–purge subtype of AN.\n\nSubjects provided written informed consent to participate in this study at an initial appointment. All subjects were then interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-RV) disorders to confirm the history of anorexia in the RAN group, the absence of eating disorders in the CON group and the absence of other current Axis I disorders, including a current major depressive episode (MDE), depression not otherwise specified and dysthymia, in both groups. Participants were also screened for MRI compatibility. Some of the subjects had a history of recurrent Major Depressive Disorder (1, CON; 7, RAN) but none had met symptom criteria for an MDE for at least 3 months prior to the neuroimaging studies. No participants had a current or past diagnosis of any psychotic disorders or bipolar disorder; no participants were currently taking mood-stabilizers, antipsychotics or benzodiazepines. Participants on antidepressants whose dosage had not changed for at least 3 months prior to their MRI scans were included (1 CON; 8 RAN). This study was approved by the institutional review boards of both the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and The University of Texas at Dallas.\n\nParticipants also completed the Quick Inventory of Depression, Self-Report (QIDS-SR), a self-report questionnaire consisting of 16 items to assess current symptoms of depression (Rush et al., 2003), as well as the Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26), a self-report questionnaire consisting of 26 items that relate to current eating behaviors (Berland et al., 1986). Subjects also completed the Self-Liking and Self-Competence Self-Esteem Questionnaire, a 16 item self-report questionnaire that provides two measures of self-esteem (Tafarodi and Swann, 1995).\n\nSocial and physical self-knowledge\n\nWe found that different regions of cortex were involved in the processing of social and physical self-knowledge. This was true for both for the healthy CON subjects: the social ‘I am’ contrast activated regions of the occipital lobe and the physical ‘I look’ contrast activated areas within the cingulate, and for the RAN subjects: the social ‘I am’ contrast activated many bilateral peripheral cortical regions while the physical ‘I look’ contrast significantly activated only the bilateral insula and MPFC. We also found group differences in the activation of the dACC in the social ‘Friend believes’ conditions. These data support the position that identity is a complex attribute, and also that knowledge about social descriptors is not the same as knowledge about one’s appearance. Additionally as the DSM-IV criteria describe AN as an illness with a low body weight in conjunction with physical identity disturbances (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), we were surprised that our results showed more neural differences in the comparisons related to the social task than the physical task. In sum, our results are consistent with literature proposing identity and self-esteem as core disturbances in AN (Stein and Corte, 2007, 2008), as well as studies suggesting that social cognition plays a role in AN (Zucker et al., 2007; Harrison et al., 2009; Harrison et al., 2010; Oldershaw et al., 2010; Mcadams and Krawczyk, 2011).\n\nOur social appraisal task was similar to those used to study self-knowledge and mentalization in healthy controls in other studies. The cortical regions expected to be active during the self–friend ‘I am’ contrast and reflected–self ‘I believe’ contrast include the MPFC, the dACC, the vACC and the precuneus (Northoff et al., 2006; Heatherton, 2011). We chose to use a task that included a close other, a friend of the subject, because we were particularly interested in the neural activations associated with the third person perspective condition, a condition most appropriate with known, personalized others.\n\nHowever, the use of a close other in comparison to a self-evaluation has shown inconsistent neural activations even in healthy individuals unlike those studies using a distant other or semantic comparison (Johnson et al., 2002; Kelley et al., 2002; Schmitz et al., 2004; Ochsner et al., 2005; Heatherton et al., 2006; D’Argembeau et al., 2007; Pfeifer et al., 2007; Modinos et al., 2009; Moran et al., 2009; Pfeifer et al., 2009). Four studies have used an fMRI task with a close friend as the other: two showed more activation in both anterior and posterior midline cortical structures in the self condition than the friend condition (Heatherton et al., 2006; D’Argembeau et al., 2007) and two found no differences in midline cortical structures (Schmitz et al., 2004; Ochsner et al., 2005), akin to our data. Two other studies have used the subject’s mother as the comparator; one found increased ACC for self compared with mother (Vanderwal et al., 2008) and the other (Zhu et al., 2007) found increased MPFC activation for self compared with mother in Western individuals but no differences in Chinese individuals. Together these studies have suggested that the more one perceives one’s friend to be similar to oneself, the less likely neuroimaging studies are to show differences in midline cortical structures (Heatherton, 2011). Here, the similar activation of the midline cortical structures in the self and friend conditions in the CON group suggests that these conditions elicited similar cognitive processing. This is in marked contrast to the RAN subjects for whom many clusters, including the dACC but also a number of peripheral cortical regions emerged in the social self and friend comparison.\n\nOf note, another important variable in detecting activations is the threshold set for cluster extent, and these thresholds vary in the literature. We lowered our threshold by changing the extent from a cluster-P corrected 0.05 value to a 10 voxel extent, as was more common in early fMRI studies, observing clusters in both the precuneus (47 voxels, t = 4.84) and the middle cingulate (44 voxels, t = 5.92) in the CON (but not RAN) group, akin to both the D’Argembeau and Heatherton studies consisting of healthy controls (Supplementary Figure S6). We also examined the percent signal change using these two ROIs for both the CON and RAN populations, recognizing that this is a non-standard comparison for clinical neuroimaging. In the CON group, we found increased percent signal change in both of these regions in the self condition relative to the friend condition. In the RAN group, the precuneus shows the opposite effect, and the modulation of the cingulate is reduced. These data are consistent with our other findings that the midline cortical structures are differentially activated in participants recovering from AN compared with healthy participants.\n\nThe region that emerged in the two-sample comparison between the CON and RAN groups in the social self–friend contrast was the precuneus. The precuneus is a cortical region in the parietal lobe with connections to the limbic system, the parietal cortex, the occipital lobe and the temporal lobe (Cavanna and Trimble, 2006); this region has been proposed to integrate emotional, physical and visual inputs into a view of self relevant to consciousness (Northoff et al., 2006; Cavanna, 2007). The precuneus has been divided into multiple regions, with the dorsal portion, that we observed to have lower activity in RAN subjects than the CON subjects in the social ‘I am’ contrast, involved in self-assessments, and a ventral region contiguous with the posterior cingulate activated by perspective-taking tasks, akin to our social ‘Friend believes’ contrast (Cavanna and Trimble, 2006; Northoff et al., 2006). Pfieffer and colleagues (Pfeifer et al., 2009) recently compared the neural activity associated with performing social appraisal tasks in healthy adults and adolescents and found increased activation within the posterior cingulate and precuneus in adolescents performing social appraisal tasks relative to the adults.\n\nOther neurodevelopmental and physiological information about the precuneus supports a role for this area in the pathology of AN. The precuneus is the last cortical region to myelinate, along with prefrontal cortex, typically completing myelination during adolescence (Goldman-Rakic, 1987). The connectivity between the anterior cingulate and the precuneus also increases with age in comparisons of children, adolescents and adults (Kelly et al., 2009). These studies suggest that normal neurodevelopmental processes lead to maturation of the precuneus during adolescence, the same period as the typical onset of AN (Kaye, 2008). Neuroimaging studies in healthy controls have also observed precuneus activation during set-shifting, executive-function tasks, mentalization and ToM tasks (Cavanna and Trimble, 2006); all functions reported to be impaired in AN (Gillberg et al., 2007; Harrison et al., 2009; Gillberg et al., 2010; Rothschild-Yakar et al., 2010). Finally, the precuneus is highly active in the resting state and consumes ∼35% more glucose than any other area of human cerebral cortex (Gusnard and Raichle, 2001). This high utilization of glucose suggests that this region may be particularly susceptible to degeneration in starvation. We were unable to determine whether the differences we observed in the precuneus in RAN were present before AN began and related to its pathogenesis or whether the precuneus was secondarily damaged by this illness. Further research may allow the effects of neurodevelopmental changes to be separated from possible physiological consequences from starvation, but such information may only be attainable from a larger longitudinal study.\n\nThe physical task directly examined the cognitive processes associated with evaluation of body shape. In the CON group map for the ‘I look’ contrast, we observed several clusters in the anterior and middle cingulate whereas in the RAN group map, there were clusters in the bilateral insula and dACC and no activations in the cingulate. The subgenual anterior cingulate has been previously reported to be smaller in AN, and the amount of the size reduction has even been related to the severity of the illness (Naruo et al., 2001; Muhlau et al., 2007; McCormick et al., 2008). The cingulate is often engaged in tasks involving self-regulation, such as considering one’s current physiological or emotional state (Heatherton, 2011). Alexithymia has been correlated with decreased activity in the anterior cingulate in both healthy controls and AN patients (Miyake et al., 2009), reinforcing the notion of this area as mediating self-understanding. In both a social economic game and a self-imagery paradigm, activation of the middle cingulate has been associated with directly with reflection on the consequences of one’s own behavior (Chiu et al., 2008). Interestingly, the RAN subjects, unlike the CON subjects, did show modulation of this part of the cingulate during the contrast of the physical reflected (‘Friend believes I look’) and the physical self (‘I believe I look’) conditions ( and Supplementary Figure S5). If the cingulate is considered to monitor current self-state (Northoff et al., 2006; Heatherton, 2011), then these findings are consistent with an idea that cc-dACC of the RAN subjects may have learned that their friend’s belief about their own appearance is a more accurate portrayal of current physical state than their own belief about their appearance."
