        "meta_description": "Downloadable (with restrictions)!  Sustainable development is one of the issues that many developed and developing countries focus on in the world. The sustainability of human and natural resources is of great importance for securing the world and humanity's common future. In this context, this study aims to evaluate the socio-economic structure of Erzurum with analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and digitized strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats analysis considering sustainable development goals (SDGs). The items included in the Agenda 21 report of the United Nations and 17 SDGs determined by the United Nations were taken into consideration in this endeavour. In line with expert opinions, the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats created by the sustainable development goals for Erzurum province were analysed statistically with the AHP. Priority and weighted values of each sub-criterion were calculated. According to this analysis, “the richness of natural, cultural and historical resources for tourism potential” ranks first among the strengths of the province regarding sustainable development goals. Weaknesses include “insufficient investment and entrepreneurial culture”. However, “priority region status for development” criterion stands out as the most important opportunity. Threats include “loss of labour force due to migration from agricultural areas” criterion. After the statistical analysis, the quantitative results of made for the best realization of sustainable development for the area were assessed to specify new goals and strategies. Suggestions were offered to define opportunities and strengths, threats and weaknesses with new-build strategies and to make the plans accordingly.",
