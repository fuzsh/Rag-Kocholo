        "meta_description": "Super-oxidized water is one of the broad spectrum disinfectants, which was introduced recently. There are many researches to find reliable chemicals which are effective, inexpensive, easy to obtain and use, and effective for disinfection of microorganisms leading hospital infections. Antimicrobial activity of super-oxidized water is promising. The aim of this study was to investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of different concentrations of Medilox® super-oxidized water that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as high level disinfectant. In this study, super-oxidized water obtained from Medilox® [Soosan E &amp; C, Korea] device, which had been already installed in our hospital, was used. Antimicrobial activities of different concentrations of super-oxidized water (1/1, 1/2, 1/5, 1/10, 1/20, 1/50, 1/100) at different exposure times (1, 2, 5, 10, 30&nbsp;min) against six ATCC strains, eight antibiotic resistant bacteria, yeasts and molds were evaluated using qualitative suspension test. Dey-Engley Neutralizing Broth [Sigma-Aldrich, USA] was used as neutralizing agent. Medilox® was found to be effective against all standard strains (Acinetobacter baumannii 19606, Escherichia coli 25922, Enterococcus faecalis 29212, Klebsiella pneumoniae 254988, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853, Staphylococcus aureus 29213), all clinical isolates (Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Myroides spp.), and all yeastsat 1/1 dilution in ≥ 1&nbsp;minute. It was found to be effective on Aspergillus flavus at 1/1 dilution in ≥ 2&nbsp;minutes and on certain molds in ≥ 5&nbsp;minutes. Medilox® super-oxidized water is a broad spectrum, on-site producible disinfectant, which is effective on bacteria and fungi and can be used for the control of nosocomial infection.",

        "text": "Disinfection is utmost important factor in the prevention of nosocomial infections. It has been known that failure in disinfection increases the morbidity, mortality, and treatment costs, whereas unnecessary disinfection procedures increase hospital expenses and select resistant microorganisms [15]. In order to avoid such risks, the first step in the hospital setting should be the selection of right disinfectants that have proven activity against broad spectrum of microorganisms. Relevant application method, right concentration, and required exposure time should be used [3]. Disinfection efficacy of electrolyzed water, which has been widely used on environment and water in recent years, is remarkable. It has many advantages such as not having toxic products, safety to the patients, the staff, and the environment, not harming human tissue, and low cost [8].\n\nSuper-oxidized water has been used in various industrial areas in our country in recent years. There are many international researches being performed to determine the efficacy of super-oxidized water. However, this study is one of the very few studies that will lead further studies investigating the activity of super-oxidized water on microorganisms causing nosocomial infections. Suspension tests are the most commonly used, inexpensive, easy to apply, reproducible first step tests to determine the activity of disinfectants [10]. In this study, we used suspension tests to evaluate activity of super-oxidized water against different types of bacteria and fungi causing hospital-acquired infections.\n\nA disinfectant which can be used safely in hospital settings should be effective against bacteria, fungi, viruses, tubercle bacilli, and spores [3]. In this study, bacteria and fungi that will represent this flora and some other standard strains were used. VRE can lead hospital epidemics by contaminating medical devices and patient’s environment. Fast active surface disinfectants are necessary to be able to remove these microorganisms from the environment before they spread. In the present study it has been proven that super-oxidized water inactivated VRE in one minute. Acinetobacter spp. have also become an important problem especially in intensive care units due to their ability to survive long time on inanimate surfaces and ineffective disinfection procedures in hospitals. Our results have proved that super-oxidized water inactivated A. baumannii in one minute even at a dilution of ½.\n\nAlthough fast lethal effect of super-oxidized water on bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites is promising for surfaces and water disinfection systems, due to the lack of studies about this disinfectant, there is still suspicion for its usage [9]. Nishimura et al. [16] have reported that hand disinfection using super-oxidized water is 7.5% more effective than povidone iodine. Although it has a very fast antiseptic activity on hands, it has a major disadvantage on alcoholic hand rubs due to its long drying time. At the University of California, Landa et al. [17] used pure cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, and Candida albicans to evaluate in vitro antimicrobial efficacy testing of super-oxidized water. It has been found to be active on all bacteria and C. albicans tested. Sakurai et al. [18] have compared glutaraldehyde with super-oxidized water for endoscope disinfection against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Mycobacterium avium. Endoscopes were immersed in electrolyzed water for 10 seconds and in comparison in gluteraldehyde at 5 and 10 minutes contact time. They have concluded that super-oxidized water is valuable and effective disinfectant for endoscopes. Choi et al. [19] have reported in the light of their study evaluating its activity on 25 bacterial strains and two fungi that Medilox® super-oxidized water can be used for disinfection of skin, instruments and surfaces. Choi [20], has reported that super- oxidized water is active against Bacillus, and Candida species besides various environmental flora bacteria and yeasts. Venkitanarayan et al. [21] have investigated the effectiveness of super-oxidized water against Escherichia coli O157: H7, Salmonella enteritidis and Listeria monocytogenes and reported that electrolyzed water can be used as an effective disinfectant provided that standardized application methods are used.\n\nRecently, the use of super-oxidized water has attracted great interest in Japan. Tanaka et al. [22] have compared super-oxidized water with 2% Dialox -c and 3.8% formalin and reported that super-oxidized waterwas more effective than the other disinfectants. Nakayama, et al. [23] have proven that irrigation and disinfection of burn wounds using super-oxidized water may be helpful to prevent sepsis associated with burn injury. Vorobjev et al. [24] have reported that super-oxidized water is effective on spores and vegetative forms of spore forming bacteria as well as other gram positive and negative bacteria causing nosocomial infections. Fenner et al. [25] from University of Zurich have evaluated anti-microbial activity of super-oxidized water according to Veterinary German Association (DVG) Standard by using Enterococcus faecium, Mycobacterium avium subspecies avium, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida. albicans. They have found that super-oxidized water was effective in 30 minutes on all the bacteria, and fungi tested. In the present study Medilox® super-oxidized water, was found to be effective on P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, VRE. E.coli, K. pneumoniae, and all types of ATCC bacteria, at 1/1 dilution in ≥1 minute.\n\nSterilox is another electrolyzed water which has been suggested for disinfection of dental water lines and endoscopes [26, 27]. It has not been studied as a surface disinfectant against hospital microorganisms. Moreever, Rossi-Fedele et al. [28] have reported that the stability of this product was effected by the storage conditions and exposure to the sun.\n\nAlthough there are many international studies investigating the efficacy of electrolyzed water, there are only a few studies evaluating the activity of electrolyzed water on fungi causing nosocomial infections. This study will guide further studies about the activity of super-oxidized water on fungal isolates. The incidence of Candida species has increased recently. Candida species has became the fourth most common cause of nosocomial bloodstream infection with the rate of 8 to 10%. The most commonly isolated fungal pathogen is C. albicans (59.8%), and is followed by other Candida species (18.6%) and Aspergillus species (1.3%) [4]. Different fungi isolated from different hospital environment may show different sensitivity to the most commonly used disinfectants. Therefore, determination of hospital microorganisms, and selection of relevant disinfectant active on these microorganisms is useful to prevent, and control hospital infections [29]. In our study, Medilox® super-oxidized water was found to be effective on yeast species in ≥ 1 minute; on Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger ≥ 5 minutes, and on Aspergillus flavus ≥ 2 minutes at 1/1 dilution. In the light of the results of this study, super-oxidized water is considered as a surface disinfectant to prevent nosocomial fungal infections. C. krusei, and C. parapsilosis are important nosocomial agents which are spread in hospitals by health care workers’ hands, and lead epidemics. Our results have proved that super-oxidized water inactivates C. krusei, which is resistant to antifungal drugs, and C. parapsilosis in one minute, and at a ½ dilution. Qualitative suspension test which is one of the first step tests has been used to evaluate efficacy of super-oxidized water in this study. The results of this study proving the efficiency on wide variety of microorganisms causing hospital infections will ease the second, and third step studies.\n\nIn conclusion, our findings support that super-oxidized water produced by Medilox® disinfectant generator using water, salt, and electricity provides highly efficient disinfection. In the light of our results which have proven the in-vitro activity of Medilox® super-oxidized water on bacterial, and fungal isolates with different resistance patterns, we believe that super-oxidized water can be used efficiently to prevent hospital-acquired infections provided that further efficacy studies are done, and validated application methods are used."
