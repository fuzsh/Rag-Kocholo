        "text": "Amin Bagherzadeh, a PhD candidate, conducts research focusing on sustainable manufacturing methods, including machining, additive manufacturing, modeling, and materials characterization. He has proposed innovative and eco-friendly cooling techniques in the machining of various difficult-to-cut materials, resulting in enhanced productivity and final product quality while consuming a low cooling rate. To date, his work on the novel technique CMQL (frozen oil particles) has received over 115 citations and earned the \"most cited\" status in \"Tribology International.\" Amin's publications in highly prestigious journals, such as \"Cleaner Production\" and \"Virtual and Physical Prototyping,\" showcase his achievements. He has also contributed to the field by developing methods and models to predict tool temperature based on an adaptive approach, identify coefficients of sliding friction, and modify JC models for additive/subtractive manufacturing. As a reviewer for esteemed journals like \"the Journal of Materials Processing Technology\" and \"the Journal of Manufacturing Processes,\" Amin has reviewed over 20 papers and received the \"JMPT 2021 Honorable Mention Reviewer Award.\" Overall, his research promotes sustainability and contributes to the advancement of manufacturing processes.\n\nFarzad Rokshar Talabazar, is currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Mechatronics Engineering Program at Sabanci University. His research work focuses on exploring the physics of hydrodynamic cavitation (HC) in micro-scale to control and manipulate the HC phenomenon. Cavitation on chip using microfluidic systems has enabled researchers to observe and study the formation and evolution of multiphase flows in micro-scale. His findings revealed new physics related to the phase change phenomena in multi-phase flows. He has also developed and fabricated new generation microfluidic devices for facile generation of cavitation as well as its control. His research on this field provided valuable contributions to the design and development of cavitation-on-a-chip devices. His research work resulted in a total of seven research articles, with him being the main contributor in three of them, in some of the best journals in the field such as Physics of Fluids, Chemical Engineering Journal and Microsystems and Nanoengineering. His article published in Microsystems and Nanoengineering has been selected a feature article in this journal as well as in Phys.Org. Additionally, he contributed to a total of six conference papers and one patent application on waste treatment during his PhD study.\n\nÇağatay Yılmaz’s PhD work emphasizes the development of a novel method to monitor micro level damage in fiber reinforced polymer matrix composites. These materials find use as structural components in a wide variety of applications ranging from automotive industry to aerospace mostly owing to their high strength-to-weight ratio. While their attractive properties favor them in many critical applications such as fuselages and wings of modern airliners, their complicated dual-component structure make prediction of failure in these materials a very hard task. Çağatay has been working in the direction of in-situ detection of damage inside the composites where optical detectors allow tracking of local cracks that are normally hidden from any external inspection tool. By comparing the in-situ findings with sophisticated characterization methods such as ultrasound based techniques, he and his colleagues were able to show that their approach is reliable in predicting remaining useful life of fiber reinforced polymeric composites, a very important outcome for the aerospace industry. His work led to publication of several articles in prestigious journals in this field of research and helped Sabancı University become a leading institution in the field of composite materials.\n\nEbru Demir’s research focuses on investigating low Reynolds number swimming of spherical particles and helical structures inside conduits. Low Reynolds number swimming is important for micro/nano robots that have high potential to be used in medical applications such as drug delivery and minimally invasive surgery, as well as in biological applications like cytometry. Ebru’s studies and contributions in this field cover both modeling and experimental work. She developed comprehensive models to identify the hydrodynamic interactions between helical structures and channel walls. Her models enable studying the effects of geometric parameters on the swimming performance of infinite helical structures, which provides a design guideline to achieve a certain performance goal. Her experimental work has focused on understanding the behavior of spherical particles in cylindrical conduits. She experimentally demonstrated that achiral structures can be manipulated with rotating magnetic fields to enable motion via hydrodynamic interactions between the particle and the channel walls for the first time, which is a significant contribution in the development of micro/nano robots.\n\nAhmad Motezakker worked on novel surface modifications for boiling heat transfer enhancement during his MS studies in Sabancı Univeristy. Through his experimental work, he was able to obtain enhanced heat transfer with an energy efficient and environmentally friendly approach using next generation coatings such as polymer thin film coatings, bio-coatings and 3-D graphene coatings. These futuristic coatings have high potential to be used in many applications such as heating and cooling devices, thermal-fluids systems, batteries and microfluidic and nanofluidic devices for energy efficient high heat transfer performance. During his studies, Ahmad successfully collaborated with several groups in Sabancı University in a diverse range of fields such as materials science, molecular biology, electronics and applied physics. His interdisciplinary research efforts resulted in several journal publications and one patent application.\n\nSeyyed Hamed Mousavi’s MS work first explored the ground-breaking work of Hardy, Ramanujan, and Rademacher on finding an exact formula for the partition function p(n). He then studied another problem pursuing similar ideas for another partition enumerant, and concluded with an almost complete result of his own. His original result is an exact formula for a certain class of colored partitions. He also has an alternative method to prove the second of the theorems. Hamed showed an outstanding performance and completed his MS course work and thesis in two semesters. He has submitted one journal article out of his thesis work and he has two other articles in preparation for submission. He was won five national and international medals in various venues.\n\nTolga Çağlar’s PhD work focuses on phase transitions, specifically in spin glasses and other similar systems having quenched random impurities with dimensionality dependence. He took on various original problems where he used hard-spin mean field theory and renormalization group theory to obtain phase diagrams of various degrees of ordering in these systems and their transition characteristics, a topic of deep interest among the statistical physics groups with implications for a variety of other problems including networks. The global renormalization- group calculations are stated to be of the kind that very few people in the world can perform, and Tolga has successfully made original contributions in this area. His work led to novel and interesting results, and publication of four articles in one of the most well-known and prestigious journals in his field of research.\n\nRebi Daldal, during his MS studies in Sabanci University, worked on modeling and developing algorithms for the batch testing of a series system in the sequential testing problem, a topic which has not been tackled in the existing literature. His work, which also constituted the basis for a TÜBİTAK 1001 project later on, resulted in two research articles in prestigious journals in his field. The first article focuses on the sequential testing problem when the groups of tests that can be performed together are restricted to subsets of given groups of tests. In the second article, he addressed the case where all groups of tests can be performed together. Rebi is the leading author in both articles and had significant contribution in problem modeling, the proof of their NP-hardness, algorithm design, and in particular coding and computer implementation. In addition to his thesis work, Rebi was also involved in a side project where his contribution led to a refereed international conference proceedings paper.\n\nNurşen Aydın, in her Ph.D. thesis, has made important contributions to the operations research revenue management area. She has already published two articles in a highly prestigious journal in the field of transportation and logistics. In her first paper, she studied single-leg airline revenue management problems considering overbooking and cancellation. She developed both static and dynamic stochastic programming models which are hard to solve and introduced computationally tractable models that provide tight upper and lower bounds. In her second paper, she addressed contingent commitment options in revenue management. She developed an exact dynamic programming model, which suffered from curse of dimensionality, and proposed an efficient approximation approach. Ms. Aydın also co-authored a conference paper on sensor networks which received the best paper award in the 2011 International Symposium on Performance Evaluation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems. Görevi: Öğretim Üyesi, Warwick Business School\n\nRüştü Umut Tok, in the course of his Ph.D. research, has made significant contributions to the design, manufacturing, and characterization of nanoantenna surfaces with a broadband absorption, reflection and transmission response.

Such data provide clues to the inner structure of these very rare celestial objects. In particular, by analyzing the data from the space-based Fermi gamma ray telescope and the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, she was able to obtain new results on magnetar glitches and anti-glitches, and properties of the X-ray spectrum of magnetars. She was in fact the first person in the world to use the Fermi telecope data to study magnetars. The glitches, which are sudden tiny changes in the spin rates, shed invaluable light on the inner dynamics of neutron stars, the incredibly highly compressed leftovers from supernova explosions, and, more generally, on the properties of matter under extreme conditions. This has led to her being the lead author in three articles in highly prestigious astrophysics journals. In her last paper, Ms. Muş initiated the study and successfully led a beginning graduate student to this research area.\n\nGörevi: Doktora Sonrası Araştırmacı, İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi\n\nSüleyman Kardaş, Ph.D. thesis contributes to the fields of communication security and applied cryptography, specifically considering security and privacy problems of radio frequency identification (RFID) systems. He proposed a generic privacy model using physically unclonable functions and developed two security and privacy protocols achieving highest protection, while also addressing the practical concerns of implementing them in real products. He also investigated the optimal security limits of distance bounding protocols, and security and privacy models for RFID/cloud integration. Mr. Kardaş’s works have a shaping effect to the field, since he not only solved existing problems, but he defined new problems, attack models, evaluation models and application areas for RFID security/privacy. These resulted in five published, two submitted articles in highly prestigious journals and 13 conference publications. His works have been cited over 160 times, which shows significant impact to the field.

Upon her return, she proposed a thesis on the development of high- sensitivity capacitive biosensors for the detection of cancer markers with novel nanomaterial- modified sensor platforms, and successfully demonstrated that biosensors with the improved sensitivity are very effective in detection of cancer types with multiple marker assays and have great potential for clinical use. She demonstrated the quality of her work with four published and three submitted articles in highly esteemed journals.

During her PhD studies, she visited Prof. Massimo Giulietti for a year at University of Perugia, where she enriched her research by working in new topics. Nurdagul's PhD thesis is titled \"On Algebraic Curves in Prime Characteristic\" and it consists of two parts. In the first part, for a fixed q and g, she studies the number of rational points that an algebraic curve of genus g defined over the finite field Fq can have and considerably improves the result of Elkies et al from 2004. For this she constructs explicit curves, and uses techniques from the arithmetic of function fields and towers of function fields. In the second part of the thesis, a nonsingular plane curve X over an algebraically closed field K of positive characteristic is considered. It is proved that if the automorphism group of Xhas more elements than a certain constant in terms of the genus of X then the curve must be birationally equivalent to the Hermitian curve. This result improves a result of Henn from 1978. Various methods such as the ramification theory in algebraic curves, Stohr- Voloch theory on Weierstrass points and group theory are used in the proof of this result. In addition to the results in her thesis, Ms. Anbar learned finite geometry, a topic different than the ones mentioned above, and constructed small complete caps from algebraic curves. These efforts led to four articles all of which have been submitted to very prestigious journals. Variety and depth of the techniques used and the number of articles produced, in only three years, are rare and remarkable in a field like mathematics.
