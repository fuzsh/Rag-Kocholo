        "text": "2.1. NLR relation with sarcoidosis stage\n\nIn about 85-95% of pulmonary sarcoidosis cases, abnormal radiological results are seen. Compared to thoracic computed tomography and other imaging modalities, High-Resolution CT (HRCT) is dominant at evaluating pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities. The following are the five radiographic stages of pulmonary sarcoidosis: Stage 0: Having normal Chest X-ray (CXR), Stage 1: Only hilarious plus mediastinal lymphadenopathy, Stage 2: Hilarious and mediastinal lymphadenopathy within pulmonary infiltration, Stage 3: Only pulmonary infiltration, Stage 4: Showing pulmonary fibrosis. There is no evidence of pulmonary involvement for stages 0 and 1. Anti-inflammatory medicines, usually corticosteroids, are administered, though treatment varies depending on clinical stage and organ involvement. This staging presents insight into the disease’s prognosis.\n\nAccording to recent clinical trials, NLR, as a marker of alternation revealer in both neutrophils and lymphocytes can be used as biomarker for clinical and laboratory indicators and as a beneficial prognostic agent, particularly for cellular injury caused by inflammation. Whereas a total blood count has been one of the basic sarcoidosis diagnostics, NLR does not require the patient to undergo any further invasive tests. NLR’s potential role in the inflammatory process of chronic illnesses has lately been explored. It’s a low-cost conceivable marker of inflammation with significant prognostic relevance in inflammatory diseases of the system and cancers. Despite the reality that all imaging modalities have a better success rate, some sarcoidosis cases can be missed while obtaining a definite differential diagnosis of granulomatous lung illnesses. As a result, the identification of sensitive biomarkers is critical for an accurate diagnosis of the condition. We found 8 studies investigating the relevance of NLR with the radiological scope of sarcoidosis.\n\nIn a study by Ocal et al. published in 2016, data of 122 patients were evaluated. As the patients’ Chest X-rays were examined in terms of conventional radiological stages, 12 (9.83%) of them were categorized as stage 0, 47 (38.52%) as stage 1, 38 (31.15%) as stage 2, 21 (17.21%) as stage 3, and 4 (3.27%) as stage 4. Each patient’s total HRCT score (THS) was determined by adding up the total extent score from each radiological lesion. Consequently, every radiological lesion was assigned an overall extent score ranging from 0 to 24. Following that, the THS data were used to divide the patients into four groups. THS=0 points for group 1 (without any parenchymal involvement); 1<THS<20 for group 2 (mild parenchymal extension); 21<THS<30 for group 3 (medium parenchymal extent); THS>31 for group 4 (extreme parenchymal extent). The average NLR scores were 1.28 for stage 0, 1.65 for stage 1, 2.88 for stage 2, 5.47 for stage 3, and 8.48 for stage 4; and in regard of THS divisions, average NLR values were 1.63 in THS group1, 2.01 in THS group2, 3.47 in THS group3, and 5.46 in THS group4; There were significant modifications in mean NLR levels between radiological phases and THS groups (p<0.001) and significant relevant associations were detected between values of NLR and WBC (r=0.225, p=0.013), NLR and THS (r=0.555, p<0.001), NLR and ESR (r=0.323, p<0.001) (5).\n\nIn a study by Yalniz et al. published in 2018, an overall of 310 individuals having sarcoidosis was identified histologically, and 220 normal participants were documented retrospectively. Patients having sarcoidosis were classified into two main categories: those who had stage 0 or 1 of lung parenchymal involvement and others with stages 2, 3 or 4 of radiological extent. It was determined that the NLR value in the group of sarcoidosis was higher than the control group. Patients showing pulmonary involvement in stages 2–3–4 had significantly higher NLR compared with patients in stage 1. Among the 310 participants, 220 of them were in the control group (NLR=1.80.6), 140 were in stage 1 (NLR=2.81.2), 170 were in stage 2, 3, and 4 (NLR=3.32.4). The cut-off value for NLR for identifying the diagnosis was reported as 2.4, respectively. Evaluation of the ROC curve showed an AUC of 0.79 (95% Cl: 76–83), 87% as sensitivity, and 58% as specificity. Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) for NLR were reported 64% and 85%, respectively (27).\n\nIn a study published in 2014, Dirican et al. discovered that as the stage of sarcoidosis rises, so does the ratio of NLR. The main purpose of this research was to discover novel sarcoidosis biomarkers. An overall number of 172 participants were studied in this research, comprising 116 sarcoidosis patients and 56 healthy individuals. Patients having sarcoidosis were classified into two groups based on their stage (stage 0 and 1 vs. stage 2 and 3). In addition, the study group was separated into two categories. The quantity of elevated NLR in patients having sarcoidosis was reported to be larger than those in the control group, as according to NLR [high NLR>2.0) vs. low NLR2.0)]. The outcomes of NLR were significantly different throughout all three groups (p<0.001, respectively). The number of patients with elevated NLR was shown to be more in sarcoidosis patients in comparison to control group, also as the stage progressed, so did the number of participants with high NLR. With the NLR cut-off, evaluation of the ROC curve demonstrated an AUC of 0.83 (CI 68.8–88.4), 80% sensitivity, and 59% specificity. NLR had 80% PPV and 58% NPV, respectively. At the higher stages of disease, there was a positive and statistically significant correlation across increased sedimentation and NLR (r=0.183, p=0.017) (4).\n\nIn a study by Korkmaz et al. published in 2020, 75 patients with sarcoidosis, and 92 participants as a control group with close demographic information were included. By comparing NLR values regarding to stage, no major variations were identified between stage 1, 2, 3, and 4 of sarcoidosis patients (3.26 ± 2.13). However, the NLR ratio was significantly higher than the control group (2.45 ± 2.41) (p<0.001). Since the association between NLR and C-reactive protein (CRP) was studied, it was observed that there was a little favorable correlation (r=0.31, p=0.06) without any positive correlation between NLR and ESR (p=0.11). Regarding the relation between NLR among blood CD4/CD8 and blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) CD4/CD8 ratios, a substantial positive correlation among NLR and blood CD4/CD8 was observed (r=0.558, p=0.02). A significant positive association was identified between NLR and BAL CD4/CD8 ratio (r=0.65, p=0.01). In patients having sarcoidosis, mean NLR ± SD (n=75) was 3.26±2.13 while in controls, mean NLR ± SD (n=92) was 2.45±2.41 (p-value<0.001). Also, Stage 1 and 4, mean NLR ± SD (n=23) was 2.23±0.85 and Stage 2 and 3, mean NLR ± SD (n=52) was 3.72±2.36 (p-value=0.003). However, it is important to note that there was only ONE patient with stage 4 sarcoidosis within the analysis of Stage1+4 vs. Stage 2+3. The ROC curve was drawn for the sensitivity and specificity of NLR. The cutoff point was determined as 2.07, and the sensitivity and specificity ratios were reported as 68% and 61%, respectively. The PPV and NPV of the NLR group were reported as 58% and 70%, respectively (8).\n\nIn a retrospective study published by Kerget et al. in 2020, 223 patients were included in the study; 83 had sarcoidosis, 75 had TB, and 65 had reactive LAP. NLR samples were assessed as follows: TB group=4.1±2.1, LAP group=2.4±2.1, and sarcoidosis group=3.5±2.4. NLR values in the TB and sarcoidosis groups were not statistically different (p-value=0.3) but were significantly higher than those of the reactive LAP group (p=0.001, p=0.012). In this study, 40 patients with sarcoidosis were classified as stage 1 with an NLR value of 2.8±2.2 and 43 as stage2 with an NLR value of 4.2±2.4 (p=0.01). In ROC curve analysis of NLR in patients developing granulomatous lymphadenitis and patients having reactive LAP, the AUC was 0.79, respectively (CI: 80–91, CI: 71–86). At cutoff values of 2.3 for NLR, sensitivity was 77%, and specificity was 80%, respectively. ESR of both groups was substantially associated with NLR value (r=0.499, p=0.001) (19).\n\nIn a study by Rana et al. 105 patients (IQR median age, 56 (47-63)) were incorporated retrospectively in the research. Chest X-ray score was conducted and patients who were reported to be in stages 0 and 1 of CXR were classified together, but so were those in stages 2, 3 and 4; the other adjusted parenchymal invasion. Peripheral NLR was quite higher in stages 2, 3 and 4 than those in stages 0-1 (median IQR, 1.98 (1.45-3.13) vs. 2.6 (1.89-3.86), p=0.0090). NLR ratio for each stage was calculated as stage 0 = 1.904 (1.4-2.7), stage 1 = 2.549 (1.8-3.9), stage 2 = 2.504 (1.8-3.9), stage 3 = 2.444 (1.7-3.2), stage 4 = 2.807 (1.6-3.5). (1.6-3.5). Evaluation of ROC curve categorized these two groups as per NLR with an AUC of 64% (95% CI 54-74) and a maximum cut-off point of 2.13 (54.3% specificity,70.4% sensitivity) (12).\n\nIn a retrospectively observed cohort study by Kocak et al. published in September 2017, a total of 1269 patients with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis were contained and divided into the following groups: first group: pulmonary sarcoidosis, in which the diagnosis is defined by histopathological shreds of evidence and lung parenchyma involvement; Second group: Lymph node sarcoidosis; in which the diagnosis is determined by histological features and mediastinal lymphovascular invasion; and third group: Pulmonary sarcoidosis combined with lymph node sarcoidosis; in which histological features as well as pulmonary parenchymal and mediastinal lymph node involvement are utilized to make diagnosis. Groups were evaluated as per laboratory parameters and, NLR was not varied across groups (first group= 3.3±2.5, second group=2.9±2.0 and third group=3.2±2.4; p-value=0.41) (6).\n\nTartemiz et al. enrolled 40 sarcoidosis patients and 40 healthy control participants in their study. As sarcoidosis patients in stages 2, 3, and 4 were compared to those in stage 1, the average NLR levels were significantly higher (respectively 4.82±4.05, 2.59±1.12, p=0.018) (1).\n\nFinal comment: As a conclusion of the summarized studies, NLR may be utilized to identify the radiological severity of pulmonary sarcoidosis due to mostly statistically meaningful variations in average NLR values across radiological stages. Also, elevation in NLR values may assist both sarcoidosis diagnosis and lung parenchymal involvement. In the visualizations of the disease, NLR was revealed to be a beneficial and straightforward fundamental laboratory biomarker connected to disease severity and requirement for therapy. Future studies are needed to determine a suitable cut-off value to be potentially used to differ between stages 0-1 vs. stages 2-3-4.\n\n3.1. NLR and response to treatment\n\nIt has been shown that NLR value is compromised in multiple clinical situations, including cancers, morbidities of lungs and heart and several inflammations. Also elevated rates are associated with increased morbidity, but decreased levels are correlated with better prognosis, and might be considered as components of acute inflammation. For example, chemotherapy effectiveness has been discovered to behave stronger in participants with decreased NLR in lung cancer, but participants with decreased NLR are correlated with better prognosis. We found 3 studies that specify the impact of NLR in the therapeutic response of sarcoidosis.\n\nIn a study by Yalniz et al. data from 310 patients diagnosed with sarcoidosis and 220 normal controls participants were reviewed retrospectively. Patients with sarcoidosis had substantially larger NLR than the control group, and patients having pulmonary involvement in stages 2–3–4 had significantly higher NLR vs. patients in stage 1. An overall number of 83 (26.7%) patients were administered with medicine containing steroids and/or methotrexate medication, and a majority of 72 patients out of 83 completed the treatment. NLR value before treatment was 3.38±3, after treatment was recorded 2.93±1.7 (p-value=0.258) (27).\n\nIn a study by Korkmaz et al. including 75 sarcoidosis cases and 92 individuals, spontaneous recovery was reported in 27 (36%) patients during the study, but not in the other 48 (64%). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in NLR values across both the categories with and without complete recovery (p=0.15). 33 people (44%) were chosen not to receive any medical treatment. 27 of the 33 untreated patients proceeded into spontaneous remission but six patients did not get to complete remission would just be medicated as per follow-up if recurrence presented. Despite this, 42 (56%) of our patients were on a treatment regimen that included methylprednisolone, methotrexate, infliximab, local steroids, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). There wasn’t any meaningful difference in NLR between patients receiving treatment and those who did not (p=0.12) (8).\n\nIn a study by Rana et al. 105 patients (IQR median age, 56 (47-63)) were included retrospectively. These patients were split into two groups depending on their medication status: Treated (T) versus Non-Treated (NT). 73 patients (57%) were on pharmaceutical treatment (T group) at the time of the study, containing prednisone (n=40, 53%) plus Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs, such as methotrexate, azathioprine, hydroxychloroquine) (n=33, 43%). Among the T group, a number of 47 patients (74%) had been on consistent sarcoidosis medication for an optimum of 12 months, whereas 26 (36%) received only a renewed prescription. At the time of admission, 56 patients (43%) were not obtaining any therapy (NT group). 15 of them (27%) quit medication treatment during the past 12 months owing to symptomatic, functional, and/or radiological remission. In contrast, the residual 41 (73%) demonstrated full disease remission and did not need therapy in the preceding 12 months. 42 patients (57%) who underwent treatment at the time of the previous examination were symptomatic, with the most frequent symptoms including persistent dry coughs, exhaustion, and muscle and joint pain. The T group had a more prominent NLR level than the NT category (mean IQR, 2.79 (1.78-3.84) versus 1.98 (1.51-2.67), p=0.0034). Considering an AUC of 65.3 % (% CI 55.6-74.9) and an optimum cut-off point of 2.21, evaluation of ROC analysis classified these two groups based on NLR value (specificity of 74% and sensitivity of 61%) (12).\n\nFinal comment: It is revealed that sometimes there might be a decline in NLR values in patients who benefit from treatment approach and receive the improved status of health, and NLR is demonstrated as a practical and straightforward essential laboratory marker associated with illness development and the requirement for therapy in the diverse settings of this status. Anyway, further investigation can strengthen the validity of this hypothesis."
