However, Barca's financial situation makes it hard for them to make any tangible move.\n\nLast month, sources told ESPN that Liverpool and Manchester United were interested in Veiga, who has release clause set at €40 million.\n\nManchester City could be boosted by the news that Pep Guardiola's brother, Pere, has recently pitched to represent the midfielder.

Aston Villa and Crystal Palace are also interested.\n\n- Barcelona are putting a plan together that would see Lionel Messi return to Camp Nou, according to Sport. First, they will try to get sign off from LaLiga to the viability of their plan to lower their salary limit before approaching their former captain.

According to Rudy Galetti, Messi is taking his time over an offer believed to be in the region of $400m a season.\n\n- Fiorentina are prepared to listen to offers for Morocco international Sofyan Amrabat in the summer, according to Mundo Deportivo. Amrabat was one of the stars of the World Cup but Fiorentina resisted the temptation to listen to offers for the 26-year-old in January. However, it could be a different story in the summer, at which point he'll have just one year left on his contract. Amrabat's agent has indicated that the club are now willing to engage in dialogue, and that the player is keen to move on. Manchester United and Barcelona were among the interested clubs in January."
