Standard economics resolves these challenges by constructing exotic preferences. Behavioral economics deals with them by proliferating biases. Neither unifies different phenomena effectively. An alternative strategy is to start with regularities of human cognition, such as perception, attention, and memory, and to derive how people represent problems, form beliefs, and make choices from those foundations. This approach unifies theoretically a broad range of puzzling findings, and incorporates new strategies of measurement and prediction. We illustrate the ideas of cognitive economics with examples of finance, macroeconomics, labor economics, political economy, and risk assessment using both experimental and field data.\n\nThursday 12 October 2023\n\nWorkshop | Globalization, Shipping and Trade\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Globalization Chair is glad to invite you to the \"Globalization, Shipping and Trade\" workshop at the Paris School of Economics.\n\nGo to the dedicated page\n\nRegistration (compulsory) via this link\n\nFrom 12 to 13 October 2023\n\nConference | Educational choices and transitions in secondary and higher education\n\nAbstract\n\nThe “Educational choices and transitions in secondary and higher education” conference will be organized at the Paris School of Economics on October 12-13, 2023.

However, contextual knowledge of the countries we do empirical research on remains crucial for high quality research. Our conference bringing together researchers working on India and China attempts to fill that gap. In addition, the conference encourages the comparative analysis of development processes in the world’s most populous countries.\n\nDate: July 5, 2023\n\nVenue: Paris School of Economics, room R2-01\n\nDownload the program (PDF -
