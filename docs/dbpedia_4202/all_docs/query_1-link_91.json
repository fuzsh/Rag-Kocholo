Maybe its worth updating to the 0.1 release version of RAUC in your rauc_%.bbappend file as an initial step. For reference, its sha is SRCREV = \"bce6dcefa01812653fb5b6e087db0c20d930adbe\" Could you test it with this one again and paste the output? Could you also verify that the d-bus configuration file `de.pengutronix.rauc.conf` was installed properly on your target? > Here is my system.conf: > [system] > compatible=mydevice > bootloader=barebox > mountprefix=/mnt/rauc > > [keyring] > path=/etc/rauc/openssl-ca/dev-ca.pem > > [slot.rootfs.0] > device=/dev/mmcblk0p2 > type=ext4 > bootname=A > > [slot.rootfs.1] > device=/dev/mmcblk0p3 > type=ext4 > bootname=B > > > Here is my manifest file: > [update] > compatible= mydevice > version=2017.02-1 > > [image.rootfs] > sha256=265c87e5784fb1ae93fd825f78e6aca0ecd454039019a27e038699d2af311b75 > size=935329792 > filename=rootfs.ext4 These look ok to me.

The bug that causes this issue is located in the D-Bus service file `de.pengutronix.rauc.service` and shows that we haven't used non-systemd systems for a long time... Am I right in assuming you are using a non-systemd-based system? The reason why activation is not working for the non-systemd case is that the `Exec` argument in the dbus service file lacks the required `service` argument for RAUC in order to be started properly as the background service.
