        "text": "\"Help us build a great company together today… so that our company can take care of your family tomorrow.\" - Sharran Srivatsaa, President of The Real Brokerage ...This is why I'm at Real! Most brokerages are not focused on taking care of your family tomorrow. They aren't partnering with you and sharing profits. They aren't providing equity via publicly traded stock matching purchase plans or stock awards. In summary, your use to them is strictly transactional for real estate deals. When you stop selling, the money stops and all you're left with is a bunch of certificates and glass trophy's saying you sold some homes. 🤷♂️ What will you have for retirement? What will you leave to your spouse and kids? You may have done a good job saving money and invested well, but there is no pension in this game. Father Time has never lost. Grateful to all my fellow agents at Real that share this vision that we are all building the company to take care of our families in the future. #onereal #realfamily #integrity #authenticity #realtorlife #realestatecareers #yql ...The following post was shared today on Facebook by the President of Real, Sharran Srivatsaa... \"This is not a brag, promotion, or recruiting post. 🤖This is about humanity. This is me trying to document this so that it keeps popping up in my memories for years to remind me of what it means to help change a family’s financial bloodline forever. ✔️There are a lot of marketing tag lines we work on internally… stuff that is catchy but also the truth… like my favorite “Work Hard Be Kind” But I try and come up with new ones often to help me capture the spirit of who we are and what we do. ❤️ I write what I feel. ❤️ I speak what I feel. - A Platform of Possibilities - Bigger is not better, better is better - Networks eat downlines for breakfast - You get what you celebrate - One Culture. One Network. One Real. - Nobody wants to join a Downline - Revenue Share is a symbol of seriousness - You don’t need a better commission split. You need a better business model. - Be where your feet are But… a few months ago, an agent looking to join Real asked me an amazing question: “Sharran, how does me coming to Real help you and how does it help me?” … that is a difficult question to answer without context and I said something that gave me chills that I will never forget. ❤️ I said: Help us build a great company together today… so that our company can take care of your family tomorrow. ✅ Of all the things that are important… beyond who you are, where you choose to work, who you choose to hang out with or even what you believe… 🦄 Believing in something bigger than yourself is the moment you start changing the world.\"\n\nI wasn’t planning to share this video I took on Sunday morning because discussing ‘’money’ does feel a little crass, but Ian Macbeth’s post inspired me to do so. It’s important to celebrate wins and opportunities alike. The discussion around “self-employment” can sometimes be misguided. Many brokerages offer substantial support, making sure you never feel isolated. Being part of a team can foster camaraderie similar to an office environment, without the pressure of KPIs but with all the benefits. This isn’t about which brokerage is the “best.” If you’re a great estate agent hesitant about going self-employed, or haven’t even considered it, I encourage you to talk to various brokerages. While money isn’t everything, it does provide choices, options, and freedom. When evaluating brokerages, whether it’s TAUK or another, it’s not just about the split or the monthly subscription. It’s about finding the right business partners who will help you achieve your goals. There are amazing opportunities out there. Just start the conversation. The main regret people have is wishing they’d started sooner. #estateagents TAUK Andrew Vass Kenny Bruce MBE Mark Bruce\n\nWhy do apartment investors pretend everything is just a-ok? Wouldn’t it be better to publicly confront reality and confess the operational issues at hand? Because, now is the time more than ever where transparency is vital… Yep- I saw this challenging time coming many moons ago. 🌘⚠️ But, everyone was so deal happy, while putting their so called heroic acts on display, and could care less about operational excellence. However…. ⛔️ The reality is- apartment investing is experiencing significant roadblocks. But- do we fold and walk away when times get tough? Or- do we pivot and double down in our operations and not succumb to defeat. ⚔️ I believe that this is the pivotal moment where we must come together as a community of strong asset managers. If we do, then I know we can collectively overcome this challenging moment and win. Win- like champions, where we all partake in the rewards. 🥇 We all didn’t make this far pursuing our own freedom, to then just fold like cowards and walk away did we? No! We came this far to win and win together❗️ . . . Who wants to win with me?
