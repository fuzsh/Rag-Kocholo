        "text": "Abstract\n\nObjective\n\nDiffuse chest wall invasion (DCWI) is a common finding in patients undergoing intended resection for malignant pleural mesothelioma. We sought to determine the incidence and preoperative predictors of this finding, and to test our anecdotal impression that contraction of the ipsilateral hemithorax is associated with DCWI.\n\nMethods\n\nThis was a single-institution retrospective study of 170 patients undergoing intended macroscopic complete resection for malignant pleural mesothelioma from 2014-2018. A novel metric of thoracic cage volume was calculated by preoperative chest computed tomography. Univariable analyses were performed to determine associations of preoperative variables with DCWI.\n\nResults\n\nMacroscopic complete resection was achieved by pleurectomy/decortication in 104 patients (61%) and by extrapleural pneumonectomy in 39 patients (23%). Unresectable disease was discovered at thoracotomy in 27 (16%) of patients; 24 (14%) by DCWI and 3 (2%) by intrathoracic organ invasion. In univariable analysis, decreased ipsilateral thoracic cage volume demonstrated the strongest association with unresectability by DCWI (P = .009) with >5% decrease in thoracic cage volume representing the optimal cutoff (P = .014; area under the curve, 0.67). Other preoperative variables associated with DCWI included preoperative chest pain requiring opioids (P = .028), prior pleurodesis (P = .036), decreased forced vital capacity (P = .023), decreased ipsilateral lung perfusion by ventilation/perfusion lung scan (P = .007), and magnetic resonance imaging findings of chest wall invasion (P = .035).\n\nConclusions\n\nPreoperative identification of DCWI will avoid unnecessary thoracotomy and accelerate initiation of nonsurgical therapy in malignant pleural mesothelioma. Our data suggest that contraction of thoracic cage volume has merit in predicting malignant pleural mesothelioma unresectability and should be validated in prospective studies.\n\nKey Words\n\nmesothelioma\n\npleurectomy\n\npneumonectomy\n\nunresectable\n\nAbbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n3D (3 dimensional), CT (computed tomography), DCWI (diffuse chest wall invasion), EPP (extrapleural pneumonectomy), HIOC (heated intraoperative chemotherapy), MCR (macroscopic complete resection), MPM (malignant pleural mesothelioma), MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), P/D (pleurectomy/decortication), TCV (thoracic cage volume)\n\nCentral Message\n\nPreoperative identification of unresectable MPM tumors will spare unnecessary thoracotomy and accelerate initiation of non-surgical therapy.\n\nPerspective\n\nApproximately 1 of 7 patients undergoing planned resection for MPM will be found to have diffuse, unresectable chest wall invasion at the time of thoracotomy. Preoperative factors associate with these unresectable tumors and may inform clinical decision making and expectations.\n\nSee Commentaries on pages 2520, 2522, and 2523.\n\nMacroscopic complete resection (MCR) is considered the objective of resectional surgery for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and is most commonly defined as removal of all grossly visible and palpable tumor.\n\n1\n\nRice D.\n\nRusch V.\n\nPass H.\n\nAsamura H.\n\nNakano T.\n\nEdwards J.\n\net al.\n\nRecommendations for uniform definitions of surgical techniques for malignant pleural mesothelioma: a consensus report of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer international staging committee and the international mesothelioma interest group.\n\nThis objective has been supported by expert consensus by the International Mesothelioma Interest Group\n\n2\n\nRusch V.\n\nBaldini E.H.\n\nBueno R.\n\nDe Perrot M.\n\nFlores R.\n\nHasegawa S.\n\net al.\n\nThe role of surgical cytoreduction in the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma: meeting summary of the international mesothelioma interest group congress, September 11-14, 2012, Boston, Mass.\n\nand is based predominantly on retrospective evidence that demonstrates that curative intent surgery imparts a survival benefit when compared with palliative surgery or resection that did not result in MCR.\n\n3\n\nRusch V.W.\n\nGiroux D.\n\nKennedy C.\n\nRuffini E.\n\nCangir A.K.\n\nRice D.\n\net al.\n\nInitial analysis of the international association for the study of lung cancer mesothelioma database.\n\n,\n\n4\n\nSugarbaker D.J.\n\nFlores R.M.\n\nJaklitsch M.T.\n\nRichards W.G.\n\nStrauss G.M.\n\nCorson J.M.\n\net al.\n\nResection margins, extrapleural nodal status, and cell type determine postoperative long-term survival in trimodality therapy of malignant pleural mesothelioma: results in 183 patients.\n\n,\n\n5\n\nLang-Lazdunski L.\n\nBille A.\n\nPapa S.\n\nMarshall S.\n\nLal R.\n\nGaleone C.\n\net al.\n\nPleurectomy/decortication, hyperthermic pleural lavage with povidone-iodine, prophylactic radiotherapy, and systemic chemotherapy in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma: a 10-year experience.\n\nIt is generally agreed upon that MCR can be achieved by pleurectomy and decortication (P/D), with or without resection of the pericardium and diaphragm, or extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP). Whereas disease extending into the contralateral hemithorax or abdomen is an obvious radiographic finding of inoperable disease, a clinically significant fraction of patients with disease believed to be confined to the ipsilateral hemithorax will be found to be technically unresectable at the time of resection. This determination usually requires thoracotomy, which is often performed in an extended fashion (often including rib resection and/or multilevel thoracotomies).\n\nOur review of the literature shows that the average rate of MCR is 70% (range, 20%-100%)\n\n5\n\nLang-Lazdunski L.\n\nBille A.\n\nPapa S.\n\nMarshall S.\n\nLal R.\n\nGaleone C.\n\net al.\n\nPleurectomy/decortication, hyperthermic pleural lavage with povidone-iodine, prophylactic radiotherapy, and systemic chemotherapy in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma: a 10-year experience.\n\n,\n\n6\n\nBatirel H.F.\n\nMetintas M.\n\nCaglar H.B.\n\nAk G.\n\nYumuk P.F.\n\nAhiskali R.\n\net al.\n\nMacroscopic complete resection is not associated with improved survival in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.\n\n,\n\n7\n\nBurt B.M.\n\nRichards W.G.\n\nLee H.S.\n\nBartel S.\n\nDasilva M.C.\n\nGill R.R.\n\net al.\n\nA phase I trial of surgical resection and intraoperative hyperthermic cisplatin and gemcitabine for pleural mesothelioma.\n\n,\n\n8\n\nBurt B.M.\n\nLee H.S.\n\nLenge De Rosen V.\n\nHamaji M.\n\nGroth S.S.\n\nWheeler T.M.\n\net al.\n\nSoluble mesothelin-related peptides to monitor recurrence after resection of pleural mesothelioma.\n\n,\n\n9\n\nShaikh F.\n\nZauderer M.G.\n\nvon Reibnitz D.\n\nWu A.J.\n\nYorke E.D.\n\nFoster A.\n\net al.\n\nImproved outcomes with modern lung-sparing trimodality therapy in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.\n\n,\n\n10\n\nde Perrot M.\n\nFeld R.\n\nLeighl N.B.\n\nHope A.\n\nWaddell T.K.\n\nKeshavjee S.\n\net al.\n\nAccelerated hemithoracic radiation followed by extrapleural pneumonectomy for malignant pleural mesothelioma.\n\n,\n\n11\n\nFriedberg J.S.\n\nSimone II, C.B.\n\nCulligan M.J.\n\nBarsky A.R.\n\nDoucette A.\n\nMcNulty S.\n\net al.\n\nExtended pleurectomy-decortication-based treatment for advanced stage epithelial mesothelioma yielding a median survival of nearly three years.\n\n,\n\n12\n\nRimner A.\n\nZauderer M.G.\n\nGomez D.R.\n\nAdusumilli P.S.\n\nParhar P.K.\n\nWu A.J.\n\net al.\n\nPhase II study of hemithoracic intensity-modulated pleural radiation therapy (IMPRINT) as part of lung-sparing multimodality therapy in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.\n\n,\n\n13\n\nStahel R.A.\n\nRiesterer O.\n\nXyrafas A.\n\nOpitz I.\n\nBeyeler M.\n\nOchsenbein A.\n\net al.\n\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy and extrapleural pneumonectomy of malignant pleural mesothelioma with or without hemithoracic radiotherapy (SAKK 17/04): a randomised, international, multicentre phase 2 trial.\n\n,\n\n14\n\nVan Schil P.E.\n\nBaas P.\n\nGaafar R.\n\nMaat A.P.\n\nVan de Pol M.\n\nHasan B.\n\net al.\n\nTrimodality therapy for malignant pleural mesothelioma: results from an EORTC phase II multicentre trial.\n\n,\n\n15\n\nKrug L.M.\n\nPass H.I.\n\nRusch V.W.\n\nKindler H.L.\n\nSugarbaker D.J.\n\nRosenzweig K.E.\n\net al.\n\nMulticenter phase II trial of neoadjuvant pemetrexed plus cisplatin followed by extrapleural pneumonectomy and radiation for malignant pleural mesothelioma.\n\n,\n\n16\n\nTilleman T.R.\n\nRichards W.G.\n\nZellos L.\n\nJohnson B.E.\n\nJaklitsch M.T.\n\nMueller J.\n\net al.\n\nExtrapleural pneumonectomy followed by intracavitary intraoperative hyperthermic cisplatin with pharmacologic cytoprotection for treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma: a phase II prospective study.\n\n,\n\n17\n\nZellos L.\n\nRichards W.G.\n\nCapalbo L.\n\nJaklitsch M.T.\n\nChirieac L.R.\n\nJohnson B.E.\n\net al.\n\nA phase I study of extrapleural pneumonectomy and intracavitary intraoperative hyperthermic cisplatin with amifostine cytoprotection for malignant pleural mesothelioma.\n\n,\n\n18\n\nBatirel H.F.\n\nMetintas M.\n\nCaglar H.B.\n\nYildizeli B.\n\nLacin T.\n\nBostanci K.\n\net al.\n\nTrimodality treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma.\n\n,\n\n19\n\nRea F.\n\nMarulli G.\n\nBortolotti L.\n\nBreda C.\n\nFavaretto A.G.\n\nLoreggian L.\n\net al.\n\nInduction chemotherapy, extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) and adjuvant hemi-thoracic radiation in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM): feasibility and results.\n\n,\n\n20\n\nWeder W.\n\nStahel R.A.\n\nBernhard J.\n\nBodis S.\n\nVogt P.\n\nBallabeni P.\n\net al.\n\nMulticenter trial of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by extrapleural pneumonectomy in malignant pleural mesothelioma.\n\n,\n\n21\n\nRichards W.G.\n\nZellos L.\n\nBueno R.\n\nJaklitsch M.T.\n\nJanne P.A.\n\nChirieac L.R.\n\net al.\n\nPhase I to II study of pleurectomy/decortication and intraoperative intracavitary hyperthermic cisplatin lavage for mesothelioma.\n\n,\n\n22\n\nWeder W.\n\nKestenholz P.\n\nTaverna C.\n\nBodis S.\n\nLardinois D.\n\nJerman M.\n\net al.\n\nNeoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by extrapleural pneumonectomy in malignant pleural mesothelioma.\n\n(Table 1), or reciprocally, that the average rate of incomplete resection is 30%. Patients with aborted resection typically receive alternative therapy, including systemic therapy and/or radiotherapy once they have recovered from the operative trauma of thoracotomy. We reasoned that preoperative identification of unresectable tumors would avoid unnecessary thoracotomy and accelerate initiation of nonsurgical therapy in patients with MPM. In our experience, the most common factor precluding MCR is diffuse chest wall invasion (DCWI). Further, our anecdotal observations suggest that contraction of the ipsilateral chest wall is associated with DCWI, which is tested in this study. Our objective was to determine the preoperative factors associated with DCWI, including a novel metric of thoracic cage volume.\n\nTable 1Reported rates of macroscopic complete resection (MCR) in the

an institutional review board protocol at Baylor College of Medicine. A prospectively maintained single institution database, including patients from the years 2014 to 2018 was retrospectively reviewed. Eligible patients were those with a pathologic diagnosis of MPM undergoing surgery with curative intent and for whom a preoperative chest computed tomography (CT) scan was available within 2 months of surgery.\n\nSurgical Approach\n\nPatients were evaluated preoperatively with chest CT, positron emission tomography-CT, chest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), echocardiogram, pulmonary function parameter tests, and lung perfusion scans. A staging procedure, including cervical mediastinoscopy and diagnostic laparoscopy with peritoneal washings was performed to rule out mediastinal nodal disease and intra-abdominal disease, respectively. The 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system was used for clinical and pathologic staging. MCR was defined as removal of all grossly visible and palpable tumor and is considered an R1 resection. DCWI was defined as an intraoperative finding of tumor invasion through the endothoracic fascia into more than 2 intercostal muscles or ribs and/or multifocal invasion of the chest wall that the surgeon considers to preclude MCR. Cases in which disease was found to be unresectable secondary either to DCWI or to invasion of intrathoracic organs were considered R2 resections. Extended P/D was performed by extended posterolateral thoracotomy and incorporated total visceral and parietal pleurectomy with resection of the pericardium and diaphragm.\n\n1\n\nRice D.\n\nRusch V.\n\nPass H.\n\nAsamura H.\n\nNakano T.\n\nEdwards J.\n\net al.\n\nRecommendations for uniform definitions of surgical techniques for malignant pleural mesothelioma: a consensus report of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer international staging committee and the international mesothelioma interest group.\n\nEPP was performed in cases in which MCR could not be achieved by P/D and included resection of the lung, pericardium, and diaphragm.\n\n23\n\nSugarbaker D.\n\nRichards W.\n\nBueno R.\n\nExtrapleural pneumonectomy in the treatment of epithelioid malignant pleural mesothelioma.\n\nIn both procedures, the diaphragm and pericardium were reconstructed with Gore-Tex polytetrafluorethylene patch (Gore-Tex, Flagstaff, Ariz). Heated intraoperative chemotherapy (HIOC) with a 1-hour 41°C bath of cisplatin was administered to patients with acceptable renal function (ie, estimated glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min/1.73 m2).\n\nCalculation of 3-Dimensional Thoracic Cage Volume\n\nA board-certified thoracic radiologist (CS) blinded to all clinical data reviewed preoperative CT scans for all patients and rendered 3-dimensional (3D) thoracic cage volume (TCV) for each bony thorax using the 3D volume feature of TeraRecon 4.4.13 (TeraRecon Inc, Foster City, Calif). TCV represents the volume of each hemithorax and was not significantly different between the right and left hemithorax in patients without thoracic malignancy (Figure E1). To calculate TCV, the thorax was rotated to superimpose the sternum over the thoracic spine. The thorax was then segmented down the midline from the thoracic inlet to the inferior aspect of the image dataset with 1 hemithorax removed. If CT images extended inferior to the thoracic cage, the inferior endplate of the inferior most rib-bearing vertebral body was used as the inferior boundary. The hemithorax was then rotated 90° with the sternum facing superiorly and the spine inferiorly. The chin, shoulder girdle, scapula, and computed tomography table were initially removed to prevent overlapping structures. The hemithorax was then slowly rotated, manually removing all superficial soft tissues from the thorax using the most superficial aspect of the rib as the border. Once this process was completed, the volume remaining is calculated by TeraRecon, constituting the TCV. The process was repeated for the contralateral hemithorax. The percentage change in TCV was calculated by comparing the ipsilateral (ie, tumor-bearing) and contralateral chest (Figure 1, A-D).\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nNormally distributed continuous variables are reported as mean ± standard deviation; non-normally distributed continuous variables are reported as median and interquartile range. Categorical variables are expressed as count or proportion. Student t tests were used to compare continuous variables and χ2 or Fisher exact tests were performed to analyze categorical variables. Univariable regression analysis was used to determine whether variables were associated with unresectability due to DCWI. Optimal cutoff values were determined by maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity equivalent to maximization of Youden's statistics.\n\nAll statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS version 25.0 (IBM-SPSS Inc, Armonk, NY), Stata/IC 16.0 for Windows (StataCorp LLC, College Station, Tex), and R language and software environment version 3.3.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). All tests were 2-tailed.\n\nResults\n\nApproximately 1 of 7 Patients Undergoing Thoracotomy for MPM Will Be Found Unresectable by DCWI\n\nA flow diagram detailing selection of patients in our study is detailed in Figure 2. One hundred seventy patients underwent thoracotomy with intention for MCR. This included 39 patients (22.9%) who underwent MCR by EPP, 104 patients (61.2%) who underwent MCR by P/D, and 27 patients (15.9%) who underwent exploratory thoracotomy for disease that was determined to be unresectable at the time of operation. Of these 27 unresectable cases, 24 (89%) were found to have DCWI and 3 (11%) were found to have invasion of intrathoracic organs or mediastinal structures. Given that the majority of unresectable cases were secondary to DCWI, and our anecdotal experience that radiographic or clinical chest wall contraction is a harbinger of unresectability, we further analyzed predictors of unresectability due to DCWI.\n\nCharacteristics of Patients With DCWI\n\nTable 2 displays the clinicopathologic characteristics of all patients, including patients with and without DCWI. Most patients were men (66%) and had tumors with epithelial histology (78%). The majority of patients in both the resectable (72%) and DCWI cohort (75%) had tumors identified preoperatively as clinical stage I. A total of 50 patients (29%) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and a total of 114 patients (67%) received HIOC. Compared with the resectable cohort, the DCWI cohort had worse pulmonary function, decreased TCV, more MRI findings suspicious for chest wall invasion, less receipt of HIOC, more advanced pathologic stage, and had more commonly undergone a pleurodesis procedure. Patients in the DCWI cohort were statistically more likely to present with preoperative chest pain requiring opioids. Age, gender, histology, and tumor location were not different between 2 groups.\n\nTable 2Clinicopathologic characteristics\n\nCharacteristicAll patientsMCRUnresectable by DCWI\n\n∗\n\nThis cohort represents all patients found to be unresectable by diffuse chest wall invasion.

The left panel displays a patient with right-sided MPM and minimal chest wall contraction (0.6%); this tumor underwent MCR. The right panel illustrates a patient with left-sided MPM and more severe chest wall contraction (9.2%); MCR was precluded by DCWI in this case. The magnitude of change in ipsilateral (ie, tumor-bearing) and contralateral TCV was significantly greater in patients in the DCWI cohort compared with that seen in the resectable cohort (Figure 4, A). The optimal cutoff value for percentage change in TCV as a predictor of unresectability was −5% (area under the curve, 0.67; P = .014) (Figure 4, B). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of percentage change in TCV in predicting unresectability by diffuse chest wall invasion were 75%, 57%, and 60%, respectively.\n\nDCWI Is Associated With Preoperative Factors\n\nTable 3 displays the results of univariable regression analyses performed to determine the association of preoperative factors with unresectability by DCWI. In univariable analyses, decreased ipsilateral TCV demonstrated the strongest association with DCWI (P = .009). Other preoperative variables associated with DCWI in univariable analyses included preoperative chest pain requiring opioid medications (P = .028), prior pleurodesis (P = .036), decreased forced vital capacity (P = .023), decreased ipsilateral lung perfusion by ventilation/perfusion lung scan (P = .007), and MRI findings of chest wall invasion (P = .035). Because lung perfusion is not always available for preoperative decision making, we examined the association of lung perfusion with TCV and we found that TCV was not correlated with percent ipsilateral lung perfusion (R, −0.077; P = .367) (Figure E2).\n\nTable 3Univariable regression analysis of preoperative factors for unresectability of malignant pleural mesothelioma\n\nVariableUnivariableOdds ratio (95% confidence interval)P valueMale vs female sex0.77 (0.30-1.97).582Age (y)0.98 (0.94-1.02).299Preoperative chest pain\n\n∗\n\nYes versus no.\n\n2.32 (0.93-5.81).073Preoperative chest pain requiring opioids\n\n∗\n\nYes versus no.\n\n3.12 (1.13-8.62).028Pleurodesis history\n\n∗\n\nYes versus no.\n\n2.56 (1.07-6.16).036Preoperative SMRP (nmol/L)0.94 (0.80-1.09).399Preoperative WBC count (/mm3)1.04 (0.92-1.19).522Preoperative hemoglobin (g/dL)0.84 (0.66-1.05).117Preoperative platelet count (/mm3)1.00 (0.99-1.00).565FEV1 (%)0.97 (0.95-0.99).054FVC (%)0.97 (0.94-0.99).023FEV1/FVC (%)1.01 (0.98-1.05).381% Lung perfusion (ipsilateral)0.95 (0.91-0.99).007MRI chest wall invasion2.66 (1.07-6.62).035Change in chest volume (%)0.91 (0.85-0.98).009Nonepithelioid vs epithelioid histology1.11 (0.39-3.20).847Right vs left lesion site0.76 (0.32-1.80).530Clinical T stage of 3 or 4 vs 1 or 20.88 (0.28-2.79).830Clinical N stage of 1 or 2 vs 00.85 (0.32-2.30).755Clinical TNM stage of II or III vs I0.83 (0.31-2.22).704Neoadjuvant chemotherapy\n\n∗\n\nYes versus no.\n\n0.77 (0.29-2.08).609\n\nBoldface indicates P < .05.

Among these 47 patients with MRI findings of chest wall invasion, 12 patients (26%) were found to be unresectable by DCWI at the time of surgery. In the 93 patients in whom MRI did not suggest chest wall invasion, 11 patients (12%) were found to be unresectable due to DCWI at the time of surgery, and all of these patients had decreased TCV compared with the contralateral side (9 had >5% decrease in TCV, 1 had >3.4% decrease in TCV, and 1 had >2.6% decrease in TCV). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of radiologic chest wall invasion on MRI for predicting DCWI at the time of surgery were 52%, 70%, and 67%, respectively.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe unique growth pattern of MPM along pleural surfaces and its predilection for local invasion present certain challenges for defining oncologic principles of resection. In contrast to most solid tumors in which anatomic resection can provide a microscopically free margin (ie, R0 resection), often while avoiding direct manipulation of the tumor itself (ie, no-touch technique), this is not technically possible in MPM and a R1 resection (ie, microscopic positive margins) is the optimal outcome of surgery. Thus, removal of all visible and palpable tumor (ie, MCR) has become a central tenet of surgery for MPM and its rationale is supported by retrospective evidence demonstrating a survival advantage when compared with nonmacroscopic complete resections.\n\n3\n\nRusch V.W.\n\nGiroux D.\n\nKennedy C.\n\nRuffini E.\n\nCangir A.K.\n\nRice D.\n\net al.\n\nInitial analysis of the international association for the study of lung cancer mesothelioma database.\n\n,\n\n4\n\nSugarbaker D.J.\n\nFlores R.M.\n\nJaklitsch M.T.\n\nRichards W.G.\n\nStrauss G.M.\n\nCorson J.M.\n\net al.\n\nResection margins, extrapleural nodal status, and cell type determine postoperative long-term survival in trimodality therapy of malignant pleural mesothelioma: results in 183 patients.\n\n,\n\n5\n\nLang-Lazdunski L.\n\nBille A.\n\nPapa S.\n\nMarshall S.\n\nLal R.\n\nGaleone C.\n\net al.\n\nPleurectomy/decortication, hyperthermic pleural lavage with povidone-iodine, prophylactic radiotherapy, and systemic chemotherapy in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma: a 10-year experience.\n\nOur data demonstrate that about 1 of every 7 patients with MPM who enter an operating room with intent of curative resection is found to have DCWI that precludes MCR. Further, to confidently make a determination of technically unresectable disease in MPM, exploratory thoracotomy is necessary and recovery from this procedure delays further therapy. Thus, improving the preoperative identification of disease not amenable to MCR could spare patients from futile thoracotomies, redirect oncologic care to more appropriate therapy, and thereby favorably influence progression-free and overall survival in MPM.\n\nThe primary objective of our study was to determine the preoperative factors associated with unresectability by DCWI in MPM. Whereas we have previously shown that a single site of chest wall invasion is technically resectable to MCR and my provide survival benefit in select patients,\n\n24\n\nBurt B.M.\n\nAli S.O.\n\nDaSilva M.C.\n\nYeap B.Y.\n\nRichards W.G.\n\nBaldini E.H.\n\net al.\n\nClinical indications and results after chest wall resection for recurrent mesothelioma.\n\nDCWI definitively precludes MCR. In our anecdotal experience, we have found that patients with MPM presenting with a contracted tumor-bearing chest either on physical examination or on imaging studies—a finding that may be representative of a process of malignant chest wall contraction—have higher rates of DCWI precluding MCR. To test this hypothesis, we created a novel 3D radiographic metric of TCV and demonstrated that a 5% decrease in TCV compared with the contralateral side was significantly associated with unresectability due to DCWI. An increasing likelihood of unresectability in preoperative settings provided by decreased TCV could inform clinical decision making, particularly for patients with suspected aggressive tumor biology in whom neoadjuvant therapy could be considered. Use of such a metric could also enhance expectations of surgery for both patients and surgeons. Although it is true that determination of TCV requires 3D reconstruction of chest CT images and certain calculation, our data validate the correlation of unresectability with contraction of the ipsilateral chest that can often be seen on physical exam and noted on a surgeons' review of standard radiologic imaging.\n\nPreoperative imaging plays a major role in assessing technical suitability for resection in MPM; however, the accuracy of imaging studies for predicting pathologic staging, including diffuse chest wall (ie, T4) disease in MPM is regarded as generally insufficient. CT is widely used as the primary imaging modality for the clinical evaluation of MPM, but this imaging modality tends to underestimate the occurrence of chest wall invasion.\n\n25\n\nYamamuro M.\n\nGerbaudo V.H.\n\nGill R.R.\n\nJacobson F.L.\n\nSugarbaker D.J.\n\nHatabu H.\n\nMorphologic and functional imaging of malignant pleural mesothelioma.\n\nAs a result of its improved image resolution, MRI is superior to CT for prediction of chest wall invasion, with accuracy reported at 69%, compared with 46% accuracy by CT.\n\n26\n\nHeelan R.T.\n\nRusch V.W.\n\nBegg C.B.\n\nPanicek D.M.\n\nCaravelli J.F.\n\nEisen C.\n\nStaging of malignant pleural mesothelioma: comparison of CT and MR imaging.\n\nThe sensitivity of MRI for diffuse chest wall invasion has been reported to be as low as 0% to 50%.\n\n27\n\nPatz Jr., E.F.\n\nShaffer K.\n\nPiwnica-Worms D.R.\n\nJochelson M.\n\nSarin M.\n\nSugarbaker D.J.\n\net al.\n\nMalignant pleural mesothelioma: value of CT and MR imaging in predicting resectability.\n\n,\n\n28\n\nStewart D.\n\nWaller D.\n\nEdwards J.\n\nJeyapalan K.\n\nEntwisle J.\n\nIs there a role for pre-operative contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for radical surgery in malignant pleural mesothelioma?.\n\nIn our study, MRI findings of chest wall invasion were associated with unresectable disease by DCWI with sensitivity of 52% and specificity of 70%.\n\nThe reason for the relationship between decreased lung perfusion and DCWI is not known; however, it is reasonable to suspect that increasing tumor burden in the ipsilateral chest could decrease perfusion of the lung by direction compression. Indeed, increased 3D radiographic tumor volume has been correlated with a survival disadvantage in MPM\n\n29\n\nRusch V.W.\n\nGill R.\n\nMitchell A.\n\nNaidich D.\n\nRice D.C.\n\nPass H.I.\n\net al.\n\nA multicenter study of volumetric computed tomography for staging malignant pleural mesothelioma.\n\nand it is feasible that elevated tumor burden is a marker of biologic aggressiveness that is also associated with DCWI.\n\nThe retrospective nature of our study is associated with inherent biases, including selection bias and unmeasured confounders. Our results additionally reflect those of a high-volume treatment center for patients with MPM and may not be generalizable to the population at large. There are some limitations related to TCV determination that should also be discussed. Not all preoperative CT scans were obtained on the same machine or at the same institution; some were outside studies uploaded into our system. Further, the measurement of TCV could be influenced by scoliosis, chest wall deformities, and malposition on the CT gantry, which make dividing the thorax into halves slightly more challenging. TCV was derived by 1 thoracic radiologist in our study and this calculation will require further validation and study of variability amongst radiologists.\n\nConclusions\n\nPreoperative identification of unresectable tumors will avoid unnecessary thoracotomy and accelerate initiation of nonsurgical therapy in patients with MPM. Our data suggest that contracted TCV has merit in predicting MPM unresectability and should be validated in prospective studies.\n\nConflict of Interest Statement\n\nAuthors have nothing to disclose
