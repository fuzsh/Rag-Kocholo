        "text": "Shame on some companies out there. Looking at your Christmas parties in a stale place with a bit of cheap wine thrown in. Your staff deserve better than that. Never underestimate the effect of giving your team a great night out; they work hard for you so think of as many ways as you can to show them your gratitude. It was so lovely to have everyone in Birmingham for the night, away from our normal environment, spending time in the hotel lobby together pre and post event, then having breakfast together in the morning. You shouldn't put a price on that! Increase your budget for the summer party (yes that should be a thing) and give a little love back to the people who deserve it most. #propertymanagement\n\nWhat stuck me about this conversation was how at peace Torlando is with what's happened during his journey of divorce and single parenthood. Yes, it's been challenging, but with a strong sense of what's important to him, this single parent has weathered the storm. Hear his story and his lessons that could help you in this week's episode of Single & Mighty. #podcast #singleparent #singledad #resilience #personalgrowth\n\nTriad's nationwide sales team united in St. Louis for three days of learning, laughter, and team bonding. We reflected on incredible achievements in 2023 and planned for 2024, all while having a whole lot of fun! We started off with a delicious dinner at Edera, where the dinner table turned into a comedy club - fostering an atmosphere of camaraderie and shared joy. The next day we gained insights from thought-provoking presentations by department heads across design, customer service, engineering, finance, marketing, and installation. Engaging with experts from different departments provided us with a multitude of invaluable insights, enhancing our collective knowledge. Amen (our GM of facilities and production) guided us through the factory, showcasing our ongoing projects, machines, and investments. A significant investment for us was the construction of our new storage building. Wrapping up the experience, we had a blast at Top Golf, connecting with more members of our fantastic team and revealing some impressive skills among our team members. Triad is more than a team; it's a big, supportive family. We consistently have an incredible time whenever we come together, and we hope you have the opportunity to experience working with the Triad family. Working with us means not only getting industry experts but also a team that knows how to have a good time! #WeAreTriad #ContinuousLearning #TeamExpertise #TeamEnrichment #TeamLearning #TeamSpirit #TeamCollaboration #RetailExperience #RetailFixtures #TeamBonding #Collaboration #TeamCelebration #TeamUnity #WorkCulture #WorkEnvironment #EmployeeMorale #TeamAppreciation #EmployeeOwned #WorkExperience"
