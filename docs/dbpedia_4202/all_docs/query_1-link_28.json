Since, menopause is known as a partial cause of CVD accelartion with againg among women, determining the prevalence of MetS is important in this condition. We aimed to assess critically the prevalence rate of MetS among menopaused women in the Middle East Countries in this systematic review meta-analysis study.\n\nMethods & Materials\n\nInternational webdata bases including Scopus, ISI web of Science and PubMed were systematically searched using Medical Subject Headings terms from January 2000 to February 2017. We included all cross-sectional conducted in the Middle East that reported prevalence of MetS in menopause status regardless of MetS definition. Quality assessment was considered for each included study. The pooled prevalence of MetS based on the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) was estimated using random effect method due to between-study heterogeneity by STATA software, version 11.0 (StataCorp, USA).\n\nResults\n\nWithin 60 studies, 21 and 17 studies were included in qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis respectively. The prevalence of MetS among menopaused women was estimated 54.87% (95% CI: 53.76–55.97) in the Middle East countries. In sub-group analysis based on country the prevalence rate of MetS in Iran and Turkey was estimated 58.78% (95% CI: 57.54–60.02), and 39.02% (95% CI: 36.57–41.47), respectively.\n\nConclusions\n\nMetS was highly prevalent as an alarming sign among menopaused women in the Middle East countries. Thus, it is an emergency requirement to promote healthy lifestyle. Also, early detection and treatment of women who reach menopause and are at great risk of developing MetS is necessary for prevention of diabetes and CVD in the region.\n\nKeywords: Metabolic syndrome, Menopause, Prevalence, Middle East, Systematic review\n\nIntroduction\n\nMetabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of several components including central obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia [1]. Within several definitions of MetS, National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) definition is the most widely used [2]. MetS prevalence was reported 22% in the US in 2002 with an age dependent increasing manner [2]. Its prevalence was higher in women than in men. It was shown that the prevalence has continued to increase, particularly in women [3]. Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) reported the MetS prevalence as 26.5% in women >20 years, 36.3% in aged 40–59 years, and 50.2% in aged >60 years [3]. Above figures were changed in NHANES 1999–2006 report as 34.1%, 36.3%, and 56.8%, respectively [3]. In addition to age, some other factors that are increased risk of MetS include race, weight, and menopausal condition [4]. Since, the MetS’ components are associated with five or two folds increasing in the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or cardiovascular disease (CVD), respectively [5–7], its increased prevalence is likely to lead to future increases in these disorders. Menopause is known as a partial cause of CVD accelartion among againg women [8]. Therefore, determining the prevalence of MetS is important in menopaused women. Some systematic review studies have been conducted to determine the prevalence of MetS in different population with and without considering menopause [3, 9–12]. Since the prevalence of MetS is not clear among menopaused women in the Middle East countries, we aimed to assess critically this topic in a systematic review with meta-analysis study.\n\nMethods\n\nSearch strategy\n\nTo obtain all related studies, three international webdata bases including Scopus, ISI web of Science and PubMed were systematically searched according to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guideline [13] from Janurary 2000 to February 2017. The search terms were developed concentrating on “MetS and its components”, “prevalence” and “geografical domain of the Middle East region” including Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, United Arab Emirate, Yemen, and Middle East. The search term strategy is shown in supplementary file. We searched for English published cross-sectional studies conducted in human subject. Moreover, the references of selected citations were hand-searched. We sent at least 3 e-mails to corresponding authors in case of incomplete data.\n\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\n\nWe included all cross-sectional conducted in the Middle East on prevalence of MetS in new cases of menopause regardless of MetS definition. Menopause status was defined in all women above 40 years of age who missed menstural period (spontaneous or surgical) of over 12 continous months [14, 15]. If there were found multi-publications from the study, it was included the paper that consist more complete reported data. We included studies which assessed prevalence of MetS in menopausal women with specific groups.\n\nData management\n\nThe bibliographic information of searched studies was saved on Endnote software for further reference management. Through all processes of data refinement, including titles, abstracts and full texts review were followed by two independent experts. After exclusion of duplicated articles and unrelevant articles, the full texts and reference list of remained studies were assessed. In addition, the reference lists of the included articles were assessed to find further articles. Possible disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus.\n\nQuality assessment and data extraction\n\nThe quality assessment and data extraction of eligible remained papers has been conducted independently by two independent research experts and probable discrepancy between them was resolved through referencing the third expert opinion. The strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology (STROBE) statement was used for quality assessment of each included study [16]. It was considered the following STROBE items for quality assessment; study objectives, characteristics of the participants, data collection method, statistical methods, descriptive data, and main results. Non-qualified studies were excluded.\n\nThe extracted information from literature included the name of the first author, the year of publication, the study region (country), type of study, total sample size, sampling method, urban/rural location, age groups, menopausal condition, MetS definition criteria, reported prevalence of MetS and its 95% confidence interval (CI95%).\n\nEthical considerations\n\nPresent study was approved by the ethical committee of Alborz University of Medical Sciences. All of included studies in our review would be cited in all reports and all publications of our study. Whenever we needed more information about a certain study, for obtaining required information, we contacted the corresponding author.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nHeterogeneity of reported prevalence was assessed by the Chi-square-based Q-test and was regarded to be statistically significant at P < 0.1. The degree of heterogeneity was estimated using I2 statistic [17]. In order to estimate the pooled prevalence of MetS, it was used random effect method meta-analysis (using the DerSimonian and Laird method) due to heterogeneity between studies. Finally, the pooled prevalence and its 95% CI was presented in forest plot according to country. The analyses were conducted with STATA software, version 11.0 (StataCorp, USA).\n\nResults\n\nThe number of the initial search results and included studies are shown in the Fig. . In the primary search, 60 full text articles were related to our topic. After considering inclusion and exclusion criteria, 20 articles were included to qualitative analysis [8, 15, 18–35]. In each selected study, the prevalence of MetS was reported according to different criteria; 17 reports based on NCEP ATPIII [8, 15, 18–29, 31, 33–35], 3 reports [22, 27, 32] based on IDF (2 reports were separately given prevalence data based on NCEP ATPIII and IDF criteria), 2 reports based on World Health Organization (WHO) and the other based on American Heart Association (AHA) [26, 30]. The extracted data from these studies are shown in Table .\n\nTable 1\n\nRef.CountrySampling MethodAge(yr)/ (Mean ± SD)Urban/RuralSample SizeDefinition of MetSQuality assessment scorePrevalence % (n)/(95%CI)Ainy et al. 2007 [18]IranRandom Sampling45–66U1645ATP III3366.14(1088)/(63.8–68.4)Ozdemir et al. 2009 [19]TurkeyRandomly admitted to clinic>40/53.01 ± 4.8U95ATP III3440 (38)/(30.1–50.6)Ebrahimpour et al. 2010 [20]IranSimple-stage cluster random sampling25–64/56.5 ± 5.8U285ATP III3360.0 (171)/(54.1–65.7)Eshtiaghi et al. 2010 [8]IranConsecutive recruitment20–76/57.0 ± 7.3U215ATP III3654.0 (116)/(47.0–60.8)Heidari et al. 2010 [15]IranConsecutive recruitment>45/51.5 ± 5.8U and R1220ATP III3463.07 (769)/(60.3–65.7)Nabipour et al. 2010 [21]IranRandom Sampling50–83/58. 8 ± 7.8U382ATP III3768.3 (261)/(63.4–73.0)Akbulut et al. 2011 [22]TurkeyRandom Sampling30–64 /56.2 ± 4.19U286ATP III3547.6 (136)/(41.6–53.5)IDF54.5 (156)/(48.6–60.4)Ziaei et al. 2011 [23]IranConsecutive recruitment45–75/57.98 ± 5.56U140ATP III3742.9 (60)/(34.5–51.5)Marjani et al. 2012 [24]Iran–54.1 ± 5.3_100ATP III3231.0 (31)/(22.1–41.0)Yoldemir et al. 2012 [25]TurkeyRandomly admitted to clinic50–60/57.11 ± 6.07U180ATP III3719.44 (35)/(13.9–26.0)Aydin et al. 2013 [26]TurkeyRandomly admitted to clinic57.5 ± 13.9U45WHO3626.7 (12)/(12.3–45.9)Maharlouei et al. 2013 [27]Iran_>40/58.6 ± 6.7U434ATP III3251.2 (222)/ (46.3–55.9)IDF53.2 (231)/(48.4–58.0)Sarrafzadegan et al. 2013 [28]IranMulti-stage cluster random sampling59.8 ± 0.3U and R1199ATP III3956.3 (675)/(53.4–59.1)Sunbul et al. 2013 [29]TurkeyConsecutive recruitment>50U301ATP III3560.5 (182)/(54.7–66.0)Caglar et al. 2014 [30]TurkeyRandomly admitted to clinic54.7 ± 5.3U87AHA3629.8 (26)/(20.5–40.6)Yildiz et al. 2014 [31]TurkeyConsecutive recruitment40–73/55.9 ± 8.4U310ATP III3731.3 (97)/(26.2–36.8)Terzi et al. 2015 [32]TurkeyRandomly admitted to clinic45–65_230IDF3527.4 (63)/(21.7–33.6)Abbasi et al. 2017 [33]IranNon-probability sampling39–87–143ATPIII3427.97 (40)/(20.8–36.1)Namazi et al. 2016 [34]IranRandomly admitted to clinic53.9 ± 5.6U264ATPIII3841.2 (109)/(35.3–47.5)Ozelci et al.2016 (35)TurkeyConsecutive recruitment45–71/55.6 ± 6.1–315ATPIII3729.2 (92)/(24.2–34.6)\n\nDue to report of MetS prevalence in most of studies (17 studies) was based on NCEP ATPIII criteria, meta-analysis was performed according to this criteria. Severe heterogeneity was found between-studies in reported prevalence (I2 = 97.3%, P < 0.001). Thus, data was analyzed using meta-analysis random effect models. Overall, the prevalence of MetS in 17 meta-analyzed studies with a total sample size of 7514 menopaused women were estimated 54.87% (95% CI: 53.76–55.97) in the Middle East countries. Since, the related studies were found just from two countries of the Middle East region; Iran and Turkey, sub-group analysis was performed based on these countries. Among 17 studies, 11 reports were from Iran [8, 15, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24, 27, 28, 33, 34], and others were from Turkey [19, 22, 25, 29, 31, 35]. Figure shows pooled estimate of MetS in postmenopausal women in the Middle East countries. Prevalence of MetS in postmenopaused women of Iran and Turkey was 58.78% (95% CI: 57.54–60.02) and 39.02% (95% CI: 36.57–41.47) respectively.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn our study, a relatively high prevalence rate of MetS was found in menopaused women in the Middle East countries according to NCEP ATPIII definition (54.87%). In sub-group analysis, our included studies were conducted just in two countries of the Middle East region; Iran and Turkey. However, the prevalence rate in Iran was much more than that found in Turkey; 58.78% versus 39.02%, respectively.\n\nThe observed prevalence rate of MetS in menopausal women of Middle East was noticeably different from its estimation in other countries. Our finding was higher than reports of MetS prevalence in Thailand that was 16.9% [36], in Korea as 21.8% [37], in Brazil as 22.2%–49.8% [38], in China as 37.1% [39], and in Tunis as 45.7% [40]. But our estimated prevalence rate was closer to that reported in some countries; 55.5%–65.7% in India [41], 57.8% in Nepal [42], and 61.7% in Spain [43]. Also our findings about high prevalence of Mets among menopausal women in Iran was concordant with current systematic review and meta-analysis in Iran [44]. The higher prevalence rate of MetS in our study than that estimated for other countries might be related to this fact that our participants were older (> 40–89 years old). The significant effect of age on the risk of MetS was shown from 6.7% in the third decade to 43.5% in the seventh decade [41]. In the some of our included studies, subjects were selected from outpatient clinics [25, 26, 31, 34] which were not representative of the general population. Differences in socio-environmental and genetic factors, lifestyles, type of menopause (natural/ surgical), time since menopause and criteria used for MetS definition could be some of the reasons for this variability.\n\nIn addition to the significant effect of age on the risk of MetS, urbanization was significantly associated with an increased risk of the MetS [40]. Other reasons that could be resulted in the variations in prevalence rate of MetS among menopausal women including inactivity, differences in dietary habits, abdominal obesity, rate of pregnancy, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level [39, 42, 45–47].\n\nOur estimation was based on pooling data and meta-analysis of extracted data from the Middle East countries, but most of the studies in other countries were conducted in a small area that could not be generalized as prevalence rate in its country.\n\nCVD risk is increased in menopusal women secondary to unfavorable changes during menopause. Menopausal women have prone to CVD with an unkown underlying mechanisms. Changes in body fat distribution from a gynaecoid pattern to an android pattern, abnormal lipid profiles, endothelial dysfunction, vascular inflammation, hypertension, insulin resistance, and high fasting glucose levels [38] are some of these variations. Some causes of these changes were established that included estrogen reduction secondary to ovarian failure, alteration of renin-angiotensin system due to an increased androgen/ estrogen ratio, increased endothelin levels, oxidative stress, obesity and stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system [38]. Since, it is shown that most of these components are preventable in postmenopausal women [38, 41], lifestyle modifications is recommended by moderate physical activity and consumption of a healthy diet.\n\nIn our sub-group meta-analysis, the prevalence rate of MetS in Iranian menopausal women was considerably higher than the Turkish. Part of this high prevalence rate might be explained by increasing in waist circumference values [45], high rate of lipid profile abnormalities, and growing in the mean age of Iranian population in recent years [48]. A significant changes in all components of MetS during menopausal period was observed in the most of previous studies in Iran [15, 18, 20, 27]. This finding was consistant with two systematic review studies that assessed the prevalence of lipid profiles abnormalities and mean serum level of lipid profiles in Iranian population [48, 49]. The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia (≥200 mg/dl), hypertriglyceridemia (≥150 mg/dl), high level of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C: ≥130 mg/dl) and low HDL-C level (<50 mg/dl among females) were 41.6%, 46%, 35.5%, and 43.9%, respectively in Iranian population compared to that reported in Turkish population as 37.5%, 30.4%, 44.5%, and 21.1%, respectively [48]. The reason of these findings might be related to diatery habits of Iranian population who consume more piceses of simple carbohydrates than complex carbohydrates [48]. Although the prevalence of diabetes in Iran has been reported higher than in Turkey, this difference has not been reported in hypertension prevalence. [50–52].\n\nIn a systematic review conducted in 6 countries of Persian Gulf (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates) prevalence of MetS was reported 20.7–37.2% among women based on ATPIII definition which showed that prevalence of MetS in Middle East region is higher than other countries [3, 53].\n\nOur study had some strengths and limitations. The main strength was pooling of available data in Middle East countries to perform meta-analysis. In addition, quality assessment of the most of included studies were scored as high quality by STROBE statement. Also we excluded studies which assessed prevalence of Mets in menopausal women with specific condition (diabetes, cancer,….).\n\nThe main limitation was lack of data from other countries than Iran and Turkey in the region. In addition, the lack of consensus on MetS definition was resulted in different reports of its prevalence and discrepancy in the data. Another limitation was the lack of rural/urban setting subgroup analysis in the included studies.\n\nHowever, the prevalence rate of MetS among menopausal women in Middle East countries especially in Iran was considerably higher than that estimated prevalence rate in adults worldwide as 20–25% [54].\n\nConclusions\n\nIn conclusion, our study indicated that MetS was highly prevalent as an alarming sign among menopausal women in Middle East countries. Thus, it is an emergency requirement to apply an appropriate practical stertegy for prevention of MetS through promoting healthy lifestyle, early detection and treatment of women who reaching menopause and are at great risk of developing MetS for prevention of non-communicable diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and CVD in the region.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors would like to express their appreciation to Deputy of Research and Technology, Alborz University of Medical Sciences, for financial support.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nMetSMetabolic syndromeNCEP ATP IIINational Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel IIINHANES IIINational Health and Nutrition Examination SurveyT2DMType 2 diabetes mellitusCVDCardiovascular disease\n\nFunding\n\nDeputy of Research and Technology, Alborz University of Medical Sciences.\n\nNotes\n\nEthics approval and consent to participate\n\nThe study was approved by the Research and Ethics Council of Alborz University of Medical Sciences.\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nThere are no conflicts of interest.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
