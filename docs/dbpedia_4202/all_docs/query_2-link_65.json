The Congress venue was in Harbiye Cultural Centre and Istanbul Military Museum and offered two days of unprecedented scientific, educational, and networking opportunities for all stakeholders active in the field of oncology nursing around the world. EONS is a pan-European organisation dedicated to the support and development of cancer nurses. Through individual members and national societies EONS engages in projects to help nurses develop their skills, network with each other, and raise the profile of cancer nursing across Europe. This biennial Congress brings together cancer nurses across the globe from many fields of expertise to 'Celebrate Excellence in Cancer Nursing' through interactive sessions, lectures, and collegial networking. The format was specifically designed to meet the needs of nurses working in the field of cancer care, education, and research.\n\nIstanbul, Turkey\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2001-07-21\n\nThis June 16, 2000 image of Istanbul, Turkey show a full 60 by 60 km ASTER scene in the visible and infrared channels. Vegetation appears red, and urban areas blue-green. Bustling Istanbul, with its magnificent historical heritage, has spanned the divide between Europe and Asia for more than 2,500 years. Originally called Byzantium, the city was founded in the 7th century BC on the Golden Horn, an arm of the narrow Bosporus (also spelled Bosphorus) Strait, which connects the Sea of Marmara to the south, with the Black Sea to the north. Constantine I made it his capital of the Eastern Roman Empire in AD 330. As Constantinople, the strategically located city arose as the preeminent cultural, religious, and political center of the Western world. It reached the height of its wealth and glory in the early 5th century. After centuries of decline, the city entered another period of tremendous growth and prosperity when, as Istanbul, it became the capital of the Turkish Ottoman Empire in 1457. Although Turkey moved its capital to Ankara in 1923, Istanbul remains the nation's largest city with a population of over 8 million, its commercial center, and a major port.

Three hundred eighty four blood samples of client-owned cats were used for the identification of Mycoplasma haemofelis (Mhf), Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum (CMhm) and Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis (CMt) by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) assays. Out of 384 blood samples, 74 (19.3%) were positive for one of Mycoplasma species. The total prevalence of Mhf, CMhm and CMt infections was 9.9%, 17.7% and 0.8% respectively. The most common species was CMhm. Co-infections were mostly with Mhf/CMhm and the frequency was 8.1%. Two cats were infected with three species. The current study was the first molecular prevalence study of hemotropic mycoplasmas in Istanbul, reporting the presence of CMt for the first time in Turkey. Prevalence of feline mycoplasma was notably high in Istanbul and PCR assay could be preferred rather than the microscopic examination for the diagnosis.\n\nViolence against women: A series of autopsy studies from Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nPubMed\n\nUnal, Esra Ozgun; Koc, Sermet; Unal, Volkan; Akcan, Ramazan; Javan, Gulnaz T\n\n2016-05-01\n\nDeath is the most severe consequence of violence against women. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of violence-related deaths among women and the general characteristics of fatal violence cases against women in Istanbul, Turkey. A total of 20,486 forensic autopsies performed between 2006 and 2010, in Istanbul, were retrospectively analyzed. Of these, 537 violence-related deaths among women were included in the study. The victims were investigated in terms of sociodemographic characteristics, exposed type of violence, and autopsy findings. Out of all female deaths (nÂ =Â 4165), 12.9% were due to violence against women, which comprised 2.6% of all autopsies (nÂ =Â 20,456) performed during the study period in Istanbul. The median age of the victims was 43 years, and a significant proportion of victims (49.7%) were between the ages of 21 and 40 years. The deaths occurred most commonly in private residences (51.2%, nÂ =Â 275), whereas the street was the crime scene for 14.5% (nÂ =Â 78) of cases. Firearm injuries (50.1%, nÂ =Â 269) were the most common cause of death, followed by stab wounds (28.3%, nÂ =Â 152) and strangulation (8.4%, nÂ =Â 45). Among the identified perpetrators, 52.3% were victims' spouses or boyfriends. The perpetrators were female in 4.4% (nÂ =Â 16) of cases. Istanbul is the most important and cosmopolitan city of Turkey, representing the country's cultural characteristics. Therefore, the data obtained in this study may be strong indicators of violence against women in Turkey. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd and Faculty of Forensic and Legal Medicine.

Two other patients with and ten further patients without characteristic light microscopic findings had referring diagnosis of s-IBM. As the general and the age-adjusted populations of Istanbul in 2010 were 13.255.685 and 2.347.300 respectively, the calculated corresponding 'estimated prevalences' of most suggestive s-IBM in the Istanbul area were 0.679 X 10(-6) and 3.834 X 10(-6). Since Istanbul receives heavy migration from all regions of Turkey and ours is the only muscle pathology laboratory in Istanbul, projection of these figures to the Turkish population was considered to be reasonable and an estimate of the prevalence of s-IBM in Turkey was obtained. The calculated 'estimated prevalence' of s-IBM in Turkey is lower than the previously reported rates from other countries. The wide variation in the prevalence rates of s-IBM may reflect different genetic, immunogenetic or environmental factors in different populations.\n\nClosed Mitral Commissurotomy in Istanbul, Turkey: Results in 4403 Cases\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEren, Ergin; Samilgil, Atila; Ãzler, Azmi; Ulufer, Tanju; Tulpar, Semih\n\n1986-01-01\n\nDuring the 17 years from 1962 to 1979, 4403 closed mitral commissurotomies were performed at the Istanbul Thoracic Surgery Center in Istanbul, Turkey. There were 60 hospital deaths (1.36%), 30 cerebral emboli (0.68%), 14 peripheral emboli (0.31%), five instances of severe mitral regurgitation (0.11%) and improvement of at least one New York Heart Association Class level in 92.2% of the patients available for late follow-up 1 to 17 years later (mean 4.2 years). Closed mitral commissurotomy without cardiopulmonary bypass can be a safe and effective alternative to open mitral commissurotomy where circumstances dictate its use.

It uses a binary logistic model to estimate factor effects in organic fruit and vegetable purchasing in Turkey. The results indicate that concern for human health and safety is a key factor that influences consumer preferences for organic food. Findings will help organic product suppliers understand the key factors influencing consumer purchasing and consumption behaviors.\n\nRickettsia Species in Ticks Removed from Humans in Istanbul, Turkey\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGargili, Aysen; Palomar, Ana M.; Midilli, Kenan; Portillo, ArÃ¡nzazu; Kar, SÄ±rrÄ±\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAbstract A total of 167 ticks collected from humans in Istanbul (Turkey) in 2006 were screened for Rickettsia species, and nested PCRs targeting gltA and ompA rickettsial fragment genes were carried out. Rickettsia monacensis (51), R. aeschlimannii (8), R. conorii subsp. conorii (3), R. helvetica (2), R. raoultii (1), R. africae (1), R. felis (1), and other Rickettsia spp. (2), were detected. To our knowledge, these Rickettsia species (except R. conorii) had never been reported in ticks removed from humans in Turkey. The presence of R. africae also had not been previously described, either in Hyalomma ticks or in any European tick species. In addition, R. aeschlimannii and R. felis had not been found associated with Rhipicephalus bursa specimens. The presence of human pathogenic Rickettsia in ticks removed from humans provides information about the risk of tick-borne rickettsioses in Turkey. PMID:22925016\n\nPrevalence and genotyping of Chlamydia trachomatis in symptomatic male patients from Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nPubMed\n\nKÃ¶ksal, Muammer Osman; Beka, Hayati; Demirci, Mehmet; Kadioglu, Ates; Agacfidan, Ali; AkgÃ¼l, Baki\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis study was conducted to determine the prevalence and distribution of urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis genotypes in symptomatic male patients who were referred to the clinics of the Istanbul Faculty of Medicine. Of 419 urogenital swabs, 57 samples (13.6Â %) were positive for C. trachomatis . Genotype distribution of C. trachomatis -positive samples identified five genetic variants namely genotype E as the most prevalent (36.4Â %), followed by genotype G (23.6Â %), H (21.8Â %), D (16.4Â %) and F (1.8Â %). We believe that this is the first study on distribution of genotypes of C. trachomatis genital infections in symptomatic men in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nIstanbul\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThis April 7, 2000 image of Istanbul, Turkey shows a 21 by 24 km Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) sub-scene in the visible and infrared channels.

The number of individuals with HIV/AIDS was greater than 7000 in 2014 according to data released by the Ministry of Health, and heterosexual contacts were reported to be the main transmission routes. Istanbul has the highest number of reported cases of HIV infection. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of HIV-1 drug resistance in 50 heterosexual patients from Istanbul. The most prevalent subtype was found to be subtype B (56.2 %). Resistance-associated mutations were found in 14 patients with 6/14 patients being therapy-experienced and 8/14 therapy naive at the time point of analysis. With increasing number of patients who require treatment and the rapid up-scaling of the antiretroviral therapy in Turkey, HIV-1 drug resistance testing is recommended before starting treatment in order to achieve better clinical outcomes.\n\nQuality of life of Turkish type 2 diabetics in Germany and Turkey--a comparison between Hamburg and Istanbul.\n\nPubMed\n\nKofahl, Christopher; DoÄan, Mustafa; DoÄan, GÃ¼lsÃ¼n; Mnich, Eva; von dem Knesebeck, Olaf\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe analyses address the following research questions: (1) Do Turkish diabetics in Germany and Turkey differ in terms of quality of life? (2) If yes, can these differences (in part) be explained by social factors (age, gender, education, household size), functional limitations and availability of support? (3) Are social factors, functional limitations and availability of support differently associated with quality of life among Turkish diabetics in Germany and Turkey? For this comparative cross-sectional study, 111 patients with type 2 diabetes were personally interviewed in Istanbul (Turkey) and 294 Turkish patients in Hamburg (Germany). For quality of life measurement we have used the Turkish version of the WHOQOL-Bref-26. Sociodemographics included age, sex, education and household-size. Health related functional limitations were assessed on the basis of an index of (instrumental) activities of daily living including the availability of help. Statistical analyses were conducted on group comparisons with Chi-square- and T-tests as well as linear regressions. There are no significant differences between Turkish diabetics in Germany and Turkey in the physical and the psychological dimensions of the WHOQOL-Bref. However, in the WHOQOL-domains 'social QoL' and 'environmental QoL' Turkish diabetics living in Hamburg have a significantly better quality of life than their counterparts in Istanbul. These differences cannot be explained by individual sociodemographic factors, functional limitations and availability of support. Furthermore, we found much stronger positive associations between education and quality of life in Istanbul than in Hamburg. Beyond strong similarities between the two samples in sociodemographics, physical and mental health the social and environmental quality of life was significantly assessed better by the Turkish diabetics living in Hamburg. This is most likely an effect of public investment in social security, infrastructure and health care\n\nUndergraduate nursing students' perceptions about disaster preparedness and response in Istanbul, Turkey, and Miyazaki, Japan: a cross-sectional study.\n\nPubMed\n\nÃztekin, Seher Deniz; Larson, Eric Edwin; YÃ¼ksel, Serpil; Altun UÄraÅ, GÃ¼lay\n\n2015-04-01\n\nAlthough the awareness of disasters has increased among nurses, the concept of disaster preparedness and response has not been sufficiently explored with undergraduate nursing students. The aim of this study was to assess and compare the perceptions of students regarding disaster preparedness and response that live in different earthquake-prone cities; Istanbul, Turkey and Miyazaki, Japan. A cross-sectional study employing seven questions was conducted in a final group of 1053 nursing students from Istanbul, Turkey, and Miyazaki, Japan. Most study respondents were female, aged 18-22âyears, with a high proportion of second year students in both cities. Istanbul's students had more knowledge about disaster preparedness and response in relation to age and year of university, showing statistically significant differences. Istanbul's highest rated responses to disaster characteristics were on structural elements and injuries/deaths, while Miyazaki's was \"unpredictable/sudden/disorganized\". Respondents in Istanbul identified earthquakes as the disaster most likely to occur, while respondents in Miyazaki identified typhoon/hurricane. Study participants responded that they could provide caregiver roles during a disaster event rather than triage or managerial roles as disaster responders. Disaster characteristics were not described by one third of the students. Of the two-thirds that were described, most were of events that were highly predictable because of their frequencies in the given areas. Universities need to target and then focus on high-risk factors in their areas and have disaster plans for students who can provide triage and managerial nursing roles as disaster responders.

This paper dwells on the expected building losses in terms of probable maximum and average annualized losses and discusses the results from the perspective of the compulsory earthquake insurance scheme operational in the country. The TCIP system is essentially designed to operate in Turkey with sufficient penetration to enable the accumulation of funds in the pool. Today, with only 20% national penetration, and about approximately one-half of all policies in highly earthquake prone areas (one-third in Istanbul) the system exhibits signs of adverse selection, inadequate premium structure and insufficient funding. Our findings indicate that the national compulsory earthquake insurance pool in Turkey will face difficulties in covering incurring building losses in Istanbul in the occurrence of a large earthquake. The annualized earthquake losses in Istanbul are between 140-300 million. Even if we assume that the deductible is raised to 15%, the earthquake losses that need to be paid after a large earthquake in Istanbul will be at about 2.5 Billion, somewhat above the current capacity of the TCIP. Thus, a modification to the system for the insured in Istanbul (or Marmara region) is necessary. This may mean an increase in the premia and deductible rates, purchase of larger re-insurance covers and development of a claim processing system. Also, to avoid adverse selection, the penetration rates elsewhere in Turkey need to be increased substantially. A better model would be introduction of parametric insurance for Istanbul. By such a model the losses will not be indemnified, however will be directly calculated on the basis of indexed ground motion levels and damages. The immediate improvement of a parametric insurance model over the existing one will be the elimination of the claim processing\n\nLandsat View: Istanbul, Turkey\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2017-12-08\n\nIstanbul has been a bustling trade city for thousands of years. In this 1975 image, taken by Landsat, the city centers on the Golden Horn the estuary that flows into the Bosporus Straight at the center of the scene. Shown in false color, vegetation is red, urban areas are gray, and water appears black. A bridge built in 1973 to connect the Asian and European sides of Istanbul is barely visible. By 2011, Istanbul's population had exploded from 2 to 13 million people, and the city has gone through a dramatic expansion. This Landsat 5 image shows densely packed urban areas stretching along the Sea of Marmara and up the Bosporus Straight where a second bridge built in 1988 now crosses the water. ---- NASA and the U.S. Department of the Interior through the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) jointly manage Landsat, and the USGS preserves a 40-year archive of Landsat images that is freely available over the Internet.

This rapidly growing supercell which produces large hail led to numerous injuries and damaged automobiles, houses, aircrafts, crops, and infrastructure of the city. As a result of the movement of the cut-off cyclone from Middle East to western Turkey, warm air advection penetrated over Marmara, and the land surface temperature of Istanbul reached 34 Â°C (5 Â°C above the mean). The transport of significant amount of moisture, which was caused by excessive heating of Marmara Sea surface temperatures (24.9 Â°C), to the low levels of the atmosphere by strong southwesterly winds enabled the increase of low-level moisture convergence. Both abnormal temperature differences between land and 500-hPa level (41.5 Â°C) and excessive wind shear values (20.3 m/s) between surface and 6 km above ground level (AGL) increased the thermal instability and updraft conditions of the baroclinic atmosphere. This condition resulted in thunderstorms, stormy and gale wind gusts (31.9 m/s 15:20 UTC), extreme lightning activity (totally 2696 cloud-to-ground and 5791 intracloud), large hailstones between 3-6 cm diameter and high hourly precipitation amounts (38.7, 36.2, 29.8, and 27.2 mm in Sisli, Kadikoy, Uskudar, and Fatih regions, respectively, between 14:00 and 15:00 UTC) in the urban settlements of the city. The stability indices, Showalter, K, Total of totals, SWEAT, and CAPE also showed the high probability of severe thunderstorm occurrence over Istanbul. Based on a comparison among these five indices, the SWEAT index is most appropriate to represent the atmospheric conditions over the city owing to low-level moisture, warm air advection, and low and mid-level wind speed terms in its equation.\n\nEpidemiological profile of naive HIV-1/AIDS patients in Istanbul: the largest case series from Turkey.\n\nPubMed\n\nYemisen, Mucahit; AydÄ±n, Ozlem Altuntas; Gunduz, Alper; Ozgunes, Nail; Mete, Bilgul; Ceylan, Bahadir; Karaosmanoglu, Hayat Kumbasar; Yildiz, Dilek; Sargin, Fatma; Ozaras, Resat; Tabak, Fehmi\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe aim of the study was to report the epidemiological profile of HIV-1 positive patients from, Istanbul, Turkey, which has one of the lowest HIV-1/AIDS prevalences in Europe. The patients were followed by ACTHIV-IST group which was established by the Infectious Diseases Departments of five teaching hospitals (three university hospitals and two public hospitals) in Istanbul, Turkey. The HIV-1 positive patients were added to the standard patient files in all of the centers; these files were then transferred to the ACTHIV-IST database in the Internet. A total of 829 naiv-untreated HIV-1 positive patients were chosen from the database. The number of male patients was 700 (84.4%) and the mean age of the patients was 37 years (range, 17-79). In our study group 348 (42%) of the patients were married and 318 (38.7%) of the patients were single. The probable route of transmission was heterosexual intercourse in 437 (52.7%) patients and homosexual intercourse in 256 (30.9%) patients. In 519 (62.6%) patients the diagnose was made due to a screening test and in 241 (29.1%) patients, the diagnose was made due to an HIV-related/non-related disease. The mean CD4+ T cell number in 788 of the patients was 357.8/mm(3) (Â±271.1), and the median viral load in 698 of the patients was 100,000 copies/mL (20-9,790,000). In Turkey, the number of HIV-1 positive patients is still low and to diagnose with a screening test is the most common way of diagnostic route.\n\nMunicipal solid-waste management in Istanbul.\n\nPubMed\n\nKanat, Gurdal\n\n2010-01-01\n\nIstanbul, with a population of around 13 million people, is located between Europe and Asia and is the biggest city in Turkey. Metropolitan Istanbul produces about 14,000 tons of solid waste per day. The aim of this study was to assess the situation of municipal solid-waste (MSW) management in Istanbul. This was achieved by reviewing the quantity and composition of waste produced in Istanbul. Current requirements and challenges in relation to the optimization of Istanbul's MSW collection and management system are also discussed, and several suggestions for solving the problems identified are presented. The recovery of solid waste from the landfills, as well as the amounts of landfill-generated biogas and electricity, were evaluated. In recent years, MSW management in Istanbul has improved because of strong governance and institutional involvement. However, efforts directed toward applied research are still required to enable better waste management. These efforts will greatly support decision making on the part of municipal authorities. There remains a great need to reduce the volume of MSW in Istanbul. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, at an international conference in 2012, the Prime Minister condemned abortion and announced his intent to draft restrictive abortion legislation. As a result of public outcry and protests, the law was not enacted, but media reports suggest that barriers to abortion access have since worsened. We aimed to conduct a qualitative study exploring women's recent abortion experiences in Istanbul, Turkey. In 2015, we conducted 14 semi-structured in-depth interviews with women aged 18 or older who had obtained abortion care in Istanbul on/after January 1, 2009. We employed a multimodal recruitment strategy and analyzed these interviews for content and themes using deductive and inductive techniques. Women reported on a total of 19 abortions. Although abortion care is available in private facilities, only one public hospital provides abortion services without restriction as to reason. Women who had multiple abortions in different facility types described quality of care more positively in the private sector. Unmarried women considered their marital status when making the decision to seek an abortion and reported challenges obtaining comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services. All participants were familiar with the Turkish government's antiabortion discourse and believed that this was reflective of an overarching desire to restrict women's rights. Public abortion services in Istanbul are currently limited, and private abortion services are accessible but relatively expensive to obtain. Recent antiabortion political rhetoric appears to have negatively impacted access and service quality. This is the first qualitative study exploring women's experiences obtaining abortion services in Turkey since the proposed abortion restriction in 2012. Further research exploring the experiences of unmarried women and abortion accessibility in other regions of the country is warranted.

We aimed to estimate the frequency of anaphylaxis admissions to hospitals in Istanbul. We obtained data from all 45 hospitals in Istanbul over a 12-month period and used ICD-10 codes to extract data on those admitted with a recorded primary diagnosis of anaphylaxis. Because of concerns about possible under-coding, we undertook an additional analysis to identify patients admitted with two or more clinical codes for symptoms and/or signs suggestive of, but not coded as having, anaphylaxis. A total of 114 cases (79 people with anaphylaxis codes and 35 with symptoms and signs suggestive of anaphylaxis) were identified, giving an overall estimate of 1.95 cases per 100Â 000 person-years. The novel two-stage identification approach employed suggests significant under-recording of anaphylaxis in those admitted to hospitals in Istanbul.

Therefore, investigations of air quality are increasing and supported by many institutions in recent years. Air pollution in Istanbul contains many components that originate from a wide range of industrial, heating, motor vehicle, and natural emissions sources. VOC, originating mainly from automobile exhaust, secondhand smoke and building materials, are one of these compounds containing some thousands of chemicals. In spite of the risks to human health, relatively little is known about the levels of VOC in Istanbul. In this study, ambient air quality measurements of 32 VOCs including hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons and carbonyls were conducted in KaÄÄ±thane (Golden Horn) region in Istanbul during the winter season of 2011 in order to develop the necessary scientific framework for the subsequent developments. KaÄÄ±thane creek valley is the source part of the Golden Horn and one of the most polluted locations in Istanbul due to its topographical form and pollutant sources in the region. In this valley, horizontal and vertical atmospheric motions are very weak. The target compounds most commonly found were benzene, toluene, xylene and ethyl benzene. Concentrations of total hydrocarbons ranged between 1.0 and 10.0 parts per billion, by volume (ppbv). Ambient air levels of halogenated hydrocarbons appeared to exhibit unique spatial variations and no single factor seemed to explain trends for this group of\n\nPlanning Istanbul's Public Library System.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nDokmeci, Vedia; Korca, Perver\n\n1992-01-01\n\nDiscussion of the role of public libraries in socioeconomic development focuses on an evaluation of the existing library system in Istanbul (Turkey) and proposes a plan for its balanced development with respect to population distribution and technological advances.

Eleven species of fruit, ten species of vegetable, eight species of food of animal origin, four species of grain, two species of nuts, two species of legume, and five other kinds of foods were included to this study. They were analyzed by two methods: Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) technique and carminic acid assay, and the results of two methods were also compared. Boron concentration in foods ranged between 0.06-37.2Â mg/kg. Nuts had the highest boron content while foods of animal origin had the lowest. A strong correlation was found between the results of the carminic acid assay and the ICP-MS technique (pâ=â0.0001, Pearson correlation coefficient: râ=â0.956). Bland Altman analysis also supported this correlation. ICP-MS is one of the most common, reliable, and powerful method for boron determination. The results of our study show that spectrophotometric carminic acid assay can provide similar results to ICP-MS, and the boron content in food materials can be also determined by spectrophotometric method.\n\nA system dynamics approach for healthcare waste management: a case study in Istanbul Metropolitan City, Turkey.\n\nPubMed\n\nCiplak, Nesli; Barton, John R\n\n2012-06-01\n\nHealthcare waste consists of various types of waste materials generated at hospitals, medical research centres, clinics and laboratories. Although 75-90% of this waste is classified as 'domestic' in nature, 20-25% is deemed to be hazardous, which if not disposed of appropriately, poses a risk to healthcare workers, patients, the environment and even the whole community. As long as healthcare waste is mixed with municipal waste and not segregated prior to disposal, costs will increase substantially. In this study, healthcare waste increases along with the potential to decrease the amounts by implementing effective segregation at healthcare facilities are projected to 2040. Our long-term aim is to develop a system to support selection and planning of the future treatment capacity. Istanbul in Turkey was used as the case study area. In order to identify the factors affecting healthcare waste generation in Istanbul, observations were made and interviews conducted in Istanbul over a 3 month period. A system dynamics approach was adopted to build a healthcare waste management model using a software package, Vensim Ple Plus. Based on reported analysis, the non-hazardous municipal fraction co-disposed with healthcare waste is around 65%. Using the projected waste generation flows, reducing a municipal fraction to 30% has the potential to avoid some 8000 t year(-1) of healthcare waste by 2025 and almost 10 000 t year(-1) by 2035. Furthermore, if segregation practices ensured healthcare waste requiring incineration was also selectively managed, 77% of healthcare waste could be diverted to alternative treatment technologies. As the throughput capacity of the only existing healthcare waste treatment facility in Istanbul, Kemerburgaz Incinerator, has already been exceeded, it is evident that improved management could not only reduce overall flows and costs but also permit alternative and cheaper treatment systems (e.g. autoclaving) to be adopted for the healthcare waste.\n\nTsunami Loss Assessment For Istanbul\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHancilar, Ufuk; Cakti, Eser; Zulfikar, Can; Demircioglu, Mine; Erdik, Mustafa\n\n2010-05-01\n\nTsunami risk and loss assessment incorporating with the inundation mapping in Istanbul and the Marmara Sea region are presented in this study. The city of Istanbul is under the threat of earthquakes expected to originate from the Main Marmara branch of North Anatolian Fault System. In the Marmara region the earthquake hazard reached very high levels with 2% annual probability of occurrence of a magnitude 7+ earthquake on the Main Marmara Fault. Istanbul is the biggest city of Marmara region as well as of Turkey with its almost 12 million inhabitants. It is home to 40% of the industrial facilities in Turkey and operates as the financial and trade hub of the country. Past earthquakes have evidenced that the structural reliability of residential and industrial buildings, as well as that of lifelines including port and harbor structures in the country is questionable. These facts make the management of earthquake risks imperative for the reduction of physical and socio-economic losses. The level of expected tsunami hazard in Istanbul is low as compared to earthquake hazard. Yet the assets at risk along the shores of the city make a thorough assessment of tsunami risk imperative. Important residential and industrial centres exist along the shores of the Marmara Sea. Particularly along the northern and eastern shores we see an uninterrupted settlement pattern with industries, businesses, commercial centres and ports and harbours in between. Following the inundation maps resulting from deterministic and probabilistic tsunami hazard analyses, vulnerability and risk analyses are presented and the socio-economic losses are estimated.

Methods Data were gathered from Turkish Ministry of Health and Istanbul Health Administration. The Annual Clinical Reports for 2002â2013 were reviewed and analyzed: C/Ss and maternal deaths in women who gave birth â¥20 weeks between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2013, in any hospital in Turkey and Istanbul. Results The major causes of MM were hemorrhage (20%), hypertensive disorders (18.2%), embolism (10.3%), cardiovascular conditions (9%), infection (8.5%), and other causes (10.4%). Overall, the average annual CS delivery rate was 46.4% in Istanbul and 36.6% in Turkey. There was a significant increase in the CS rates in Istanbul and Turkey from 2008 to 2013 relative to those from 2002 to 2007 (p = 0.004). There was a statistically significant and inverse relationship (97.2%) between the MMR and CS rate from 2002 to 2013 in Turkey (p = 0.001). However, no significant relationship was detected between the MMR and CS rate from 2002 to 2013 in Istanbul (p > 0.05). There was a significant inverse correlation (66.3%) between the CS rate and peripartumhemorrhage in Turkey (p = 0.019) and there was a significant inverse correlation (66.5%) between the CS rate and peripartumhemorrhage(p = 0.018) in Istanbul between 2007 to 2013. There were no significant differences in ante-intrapartum haemorrhage bleeding (p > 0.05) or postpartum hemorrhage (p > 0.05) from 2007 to 2013. Conclusions This study demonstrates that there was a inverse correlation between increased CS and maternal mortality rates during the previous decade in Turkey. Although cesarean rates increase excessively, it appears that improved health care facilities have a positive effect on MMRs in Turkey.

N. meningitidis one of the common causes of bacterial meningitis in Turkey, especially after the implementation of the national immunization program that includes conjugated pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of meningococcal carriage and determine the leading serogroup, which may help authorities to adapt appropriate meningococal vaccine into the national immunization programme. The prevalence of oropharyngeal carriage of N. meningitidis in 1,000 healthy subjects, 0-79 years of age, was investigated. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected during an 18-month period. Samples obtained were inoculated onto Thayer-Martin agar. The API-NH test and VITEK-MS system were used for identification of colonies. Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction assay was used to determine serogroups with serogroup-specific genes. N. meningitidis was isolated from 6 of 1,000 subjects (0.6%). Meningoccocal carriers were between 21 and 40 years of age. All isolates were serogrouped as B, except one that did not survive on subculture. N. lactamica was isolated from 13 of 1,000 subjects (1.3%). Carriage rate of meningococci in our study was relatively low. However, we detected that serogroup B was the leading strain in meningococcal carriage in Istanbul; choosing an appropriate meningococcal vaccine containing serogroup B should therefore be considered. High absolute humidity throughout the year in Istanbul may explain the low prevalence of carriage in our study. This should be verified with a multicenter national survey.\n\nMycological contamination in dental unit waterlines in Istanbul, Turkey\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKadaifciler, Duygu GÃ¶ksay; Ãkten, Suzan; Sen, Burhan\n\n2013-01-01\n\nStudies on dental units (DUs) are conducted either for the prevention or the reduction of the density of bacterial contamination in dental unit waterlines (DUWLs). However, the existence of fungi in the these systems requires more attention. During dental treatment, direct contact with water contaminated with fungi such as Candida, Aspergillus, or inhalation of aerosols from high-speed drill may cause various respiratory infections, such as asthma, allergies, and wounds on mucose membranes, especially on immunocompromised patients and dentists. The aims of this study are to investigate the number and colonization of fungi in DUWLs in the city of Istanbul, Turkey. Water samples were collected from air-water syringes, high-speed drills, and inlet waters from 41 DUs. The aerobic mesophilic fungi count in high- speed drills was higher than inlet waters and air-water syringes. Non-sporulating fungi were found in 7 DUs. The isolated fungi were identified as Penicillium waksmanii, Cladosporium spp., Penicillium spp., Candida famata, Cryptococcus laurentii, Candida guilliermondii, Penicillium verrucosum, Aspergillus pseudoglaucus, Penicillium decumbens, and Acremonium sp. Some of these fungal genera are known as opportunistic pathogens that led to respiratory diseases such as allergic rhinits. This study shows the importance of regular control of mycological contamination on water at DUs.

Sultan Mahmud II established the first medical school of the Ottoman Empire named as Mekteb-i Tibbiye-i Sahane to provide health services to the army in 1839 [Gok S. Tomorrow, today and yesterday of the forensic medicine. 1st ed. Istanbul: Temel printing office; 1995]. It is also accepted as an important milestone of both medical education and forensic medicine in Turkey [Gok S and Ozen C. History and organization of forensic. 1st ed. Istanbul: Istanbul University Cerrahpasa Medical School Publications; 1982]. The first lecturer of forensic medicine at Mekteb-i Tibbiye-i Sahane was Dr. Charles Ambroise Bernard (C.A.). and he was also the first to perform autopsy in the history of Ottoman Empire [Gok, 1995]. Approximately 40 years after the first forensic medicine lecture in 1879, the Department of Medical Jurisprudence was established as a division of Zabita Tababet-i Adliye (Law Enforcement Office) in Istanbul [SehsuvaroÄlu and Ozen. History and development of forensic medicine in the world and in our country. Mag Istanbul Univ Med Fac 1974;36(60)].

This study aimed to determine the risk factors of head trauma-related deaths among children younger than 5 years in Istanbul, Turkey. This study was conducted using the records of the Morgue Department of the Council of Forensic Medicine in Istanbul. The records of cases autopsied between 2008 and 2012 were retrospectively investigated. Of all preschool children deaths, 203 head trauma-related deaths were included in the study. Of all, 117 (57.6%) were males and 86 (42.4%) were females. Most cases (107, 52.70%) were between the ages of 12 and 36 months. The most common mechanism of injury was \"fall from a height\" with 97 cases (47.78%), followed by \"traffic accidents\" (67, 33%) and \"hit by falling objects\" (19, 9.35%). Skull fracture was detected in 176 cases (86.69%), of which 81 (46.02%) were characterized with linear fracture. Furthermore, skull fracture was accompanied by 1 or more skeletal bone fracture in 64 cases. Retinal hemorrhage was investigated in 5 cases of suspected physical abuse and only 2 of them showed retinal hemorrhage findings. Obtained findings revealed that fall from a height was the leading cause of death among unnatural deaths in children younger than 5 years. Domestic accident was found to be a significant risk factor in childhood deaths. Traffic fatalities were among leading causes of death in childhood in our country, likewise in all around the world. Children were found to be more vulnerable to traumas when they start to move around with incomplete motor skills. Therefore, education of parents in terms of child supervision and installing safety precautions toward preschool children will be helpful in preventing such injuries. On the contrary to some findings in the literature, more severe lesions were also prominent even in case of short-range falls from a height.\n\nFatalities caused by spherical bullets fired from blank cartridge guns in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nPubMed\n\nUzÃ¼n, Ibrahim; BÃ¼yÃ¼k, YalÃ§in; Erkol, Zerrin; AÄritmiÅ, Hasan; Kir, Ziya\n\n2009-09-01\n\nBlank cartridge guns are generally regarded as being harmless and are not considered to be firearms in the legal sense in most countries. To show the danger of these guns upon simple modifications, we report 59 fatalities resulting from these simply modified blank cartridge guns in Istanbul, Turkey. The great majority of the victims were males and the age of those ranged from 11 to 61 years. In 55.9% of these cases, homicide was the origin followed by suicide (39%). The right temporal region was detected to be the preferred region in suicidal shots by blank cartridge guns with a frequency of 56.5%. In trial shots, all these guns were detected to discharge steel or lead spherical objects, generally 4 or 5 mm in diameter, successfully. Our findings strongly suggest that these guns should also be considered as handguns in the legal sense.\n\nLow Prevalence of Hepatitis C Virus Infection Among HIV-Positive Patients: Data From a Large-Scale Cohort Study in Istanbul, Turkey\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAydin, Ozlem Altuntas; Yemisen, Mucahit; Karaosmanoglu, Hayat Kumbasar; Sargin, Fatma; Gunduz, Alper; Ceylan, Bahadir; Mete, Bilgul; Ozgunes, Nail; Sevgi, Dilek Yildiz; Ozaras, Resat; Tabak, Fehmi\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground: Rate of coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) varies in different countries. This may be attributable to common transmission routes as well as social, economic, and cultural factors. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of HCV infection among HIV-positive patients in Istanbul, Turkey. Patients and Methods: Since January 2006 to November 2013, 949 HIV-positive patients that were enrolled in this study by ACTHIV-IST (Action Against HIV in Istanbul) Study Group, which consists of five centers to follow up HIV-positive patients in Istanbul. Epidemiologic and clinical data were collected retrospectively from medical records and were transferred to an HIV database system. Results: Among 949 patients, 84% were men and the mean age was 37.92 Â± 11.54 years (range, 17-79). The most frequent route of transmission was heterosexual intercourse (48.8%), followed by men having sex with men (30.5%). Only nine patients (0.9%) had history of injection drug use (IDU). The prevalence of HIV/HCV coinfection was 0.9% (9:949). The IDU rate was 44.4% (4:9) in patients with HIV/HCV coinfection (three of them were not Turkish citizens), whereas this rate was only 0.6% (5:881) in patients with only HIV infection (P < 0.01). Genotypes 1b, 2a/2c, and 3 were determined in five, one, and two patients, respectively. Genotype could not be determined in one patient. History of residence in a foreign country (P < 0.01) and imprisonment (P < 0.01) were also considered as risk factors in terms of HIV/HCV coinfection. Conclusions: Prevalence of HIV/HCV coinfection is considerably low in Turkey. The extremely rare prevalence of IDU might have a role in this low prevalence.

This study aimed to determine whether or not state hospitals and private hospitals that accept state health insurance in Istanbul are providing abortion services and for what indications. Between October and December 2015, a mystery patient telephone survey of 154 hospitals, 43 public and 111 private, in Istanbul was conducted. 14% of the state hospitals in Istanbul perform abortions without restriction as to reason provided in the current law while 60% provide the service if there is a medical necessity. A quarter of state hospitals in Istanbul do not provide abortion services at all. 48.6% of private hospitals that accept the state health insurance also provide for abortion without restriction while 10% do not provide abortion services under any circumstances. State and private hospitals in Istanbul are not providing abortion services to the full extent allowed under the law. The low numbers of state hospitals offering abortions without restriction indicates a de facto privatization of the service. This same trend is also visible in many private hospitals partnering with the state that do not provide abortion care. While many women may choose a private provider, the lack of provision of abortion care at state hospitals and those private hospitals working with the state leaves women little option but to purchase these services from private providers at some times subtantial costs.\n\nA Preliminary Tsunami vulnerability analysis for Bakirkoy district in Istanbul\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTufekci, Duygu; Lutfi Suzen, M.; Cevdet Yalciner, Ahmet; Zaytsev, Andrey\n\n2016-04-01\n\n.

It can travel by wind over large distances before depositing on the Earth's surface. Its concentration in various matrices are limited and controlled by the regulations for causing health risks associated with environmental exposures. In this work, fluorine was determined in PM2.5 airborne samples by high-resolution continuum source electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. For these purpose, the PM2.5 airborne particulates were collected on quartz filters using high-volume samplers (500Â L/min) in Istanbul (Turkey) for 96Â h during January to June in 2Â years. Then, instrumental and experimental parameters were optimized for the analyte in airborne samples. The validity of the method for the analyte was tested using standard reference material, and certified values were found in the limits of 95Â % confidence level. The fluorine concentrations and meteorological conditions were compared statistically.\n\nHeroin overdose deaths and heroin purity between 1990 and 2000 in Istanbul, Turkey*.\n\nPubMed\n\nToprak, Sadik; Cetin, Ilhan\n\n2009-09-01\n\nTurkey has continuously experienced problems with abuse of, and addiction to, opium derivatives. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between heroin overdose deaths and the characteristics of seized opium derivatives. Data were gathered from the Council of Forensic Medicine of the Ministry of Justice in Istanbul from 1990 to 2000. There were 636 heroin-related deaths during this period, 595 of which were classified as heroin overdose deaths. Mean crude and weighted heroin purities remained relatively constant and were calculated to be 46% (57-34%) and 51% (39-59%), respectively. The weight of heroin and the number of heroin seizures, but not the heroin purity, were significantly associated with the number of heroin-related deaths. Prevention strategies are needed to reduce the number of deaths caused by overdoses in countries situated on drug trafficking routes. These strategies should focus on drug trafficking, by providing increased levels of, and support for, law enforcement, stopping the supply of precursor chemicals, and combating corruption among border officials.\n\nImprovement and modification of the routing system for the health-care waste collection and transportation in Istanbul\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAlagoez, Aylin Zeren; Kocasoy, Guenay\n\nHandling of health-care wastes is among the most important environmental problems in Turkey as it is in the whole world.

World Health Organization, Geneva). The amount of health-care waste produced in the Istanbul Metropolitan City in Turkey is 30 ton day(-1) in total. The method used for the final disposal of most of the health-care waste of Istanbul is incineration. However, a great portion of the infectious waste is disposed of with the domestic waste into the sanitary landfill because of improper segregation practices applied in the health-care institutions. Therefore the alternatives for the treatment and disposal of health-care waste were evaluated. The technical information related to the available treatment technologies including incineration, microwave irradiation, mobile or stationary sterilization, etc. were also investigated. The capital investment cost, transportation/operational costs for each alternative method and the different locations for installation were compared. When the data collected were evaluated, it was found that separate handling and disposal of health-care waste generated on the European and the Asian sides of the city was the most economic and practicable solution. As a result, it was concluded that the capacity of the Kemerburgaz-Odayeri incineration plant is enough to incinerate the health-care waste generated on the European side of Istanbul, the construction of a new incineration plant or a stationary sterilization unit for the disposal of health-care waste generated on the Asian side was the most effective alternative.\n\nAnalyzing Impact Area of Osym Offices in Istanbul by Idw Method\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKalkan, Y.; Ozturk, O.; GÃ¼lnerman, A. G.; Bilgi, S.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nOSYM is the main institute for organizing the national level large scale exams in Turkey. According to the Ministry of National Education of Turkey data, there are 17.588.958 students in the country. Therefore, OSYM has a significant role for everyone from every level of education. More than 15% of the total students are studying in Istanbul. These students have various exams throughout a year, which brings some procedures for each exam to be applied. OSYM Coordination Offices were founded to meet the demands and procedures of these exams and applicants. There are 9 Coordination Offices in Istanbul. Moreover, OSYM Application Centers were founded as support units to OSYM Coordination Offices. These units are under the high schools. There are 67 OSYM Application Centers in Istanbul. In the study, spatial distribution of OSYM Coordination Offices and OSYM Application Centers in Istanbul have been studied related to the transportation network of each district of Istanbul city. Origin Destination Cost Matrix (ODCM) and Invers Distance Weighting (IDW) Method were used to visualize the distribution of OSYM Coordination Offices and Application Centers accessibilities. ODCM measures the nearest paths along the transportation network from origins to destinations. IDW is one of the several interpolation methods allocating values to unknown points. ODCM Method was used to calculate the distances over the transportation network. The results obtained from ODCM Method were used in IDW Method to interpolate the weightings of the OSYM offices and centers. Accessibility of the OSYM Coordination Offices and Application Centers has been detected according to surrounding transportation network. Spatial distribution of existing offices and application centers were evaluated by districts of Istanbul city in conclusion of the study by the ODCM and IDW Methods.\n\nPediatric allergy and immunology in Turkey.\n\nPubMed\n\nCelik, GÃ¼lfem; Bakirtas, Arzu; Sackesen, Cansin; Reisli, Ismail; Tuncer, Ayfer\n\n2011-06-01\n\nAllergic diseases constitute a significant health problem in Turkey. According to a recent multicenter study, which used the ISAAC questionnaire, the mean prevalence of wheezing, rhinoconjunctivitis, and eczema in 10-yr-old school children during the past year was 15.8%, 23.5%, and 8.1%, respectively. A healthcare level system, regulated by Ministry of Health, is available in Turkey. Pediatric allergists and pediatric immunologists provide patient care at the tertiary level. Currently, 48 centers deliver care for allergic and immunologic diseases in children. There are 136 pediatric and 61 adult allergists/immunologists. Although the number of allergy/clinical immunology specialists is limited, these centers are capable of delivering many of the procedures required for the proper management and diagnosis of allergy/immunology. Pediatric allergy and/or immunology is a subspecialty lasting 3 yr and follows a 4-yr pediatric specialist training. Fellow training involves gaining knowledge in basic and clinical allergy and immunology as well as the performance and interpretation of laboratory procedures in the field of allergy and clinical immunology. The Turkish National Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (TNSACI) was officially established in 1989 and currently has 356 members. The society organizes a national congress annually and winter schools for fellowship training as well as training courses for patients and their relatives. TNSACI also has a strong representation in European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) and European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID) through its participation in the executive committee, consensus reports, and initiatives in the diagnosis of allergic and immunologic diseases of children. The 30th Congress of the EAACI is also due to be held in Istanbul, Turkey, between June 11 and 15, 2011.

The subjects' periodontal health was recorded by the CPI (Community Periodontal Index) method. Of the 330 patients examined, 179 (52.5%) were males and 151 (47.5%) females. The mean age of the patients was 49.2 +/- 11.7 years. The majority (61.8%) was diagnosed with schizophrenia and 30.6% diagnosed with mental retardation. The mean length of hospitalization was 16.0 +/- 10.9 years. Healthy periodontal tissues (CPI 0) were found in 8.8% of the subjects. Bleeding on probing (CPI 1) was recorded in 6.3%, and dental calculus (CPI 2) in 51.8% of the subjects. These were determined as the worst findings. Altogether, 33% of the subjects had deep periodontal pockets, 14.2% with at least one 4- to 5-mm pocket (CPI 3), and 18.8% with at least one 6-mm pocket (CPI 4). The stepwise logistic regression analysis, between the final CPI score and seven variables including age, gender, psychiatric diagnosis, length of hospitalization, degree of helplessness, tooth brushing habits and smoking, showed that irregular tooth brushing habits and male gender were significant contributors to having a final CPI score of 2 or more. The regression analysis also showed that tooth brushing habits remained as an explanatory variable in CPI 0 coded subjects; helplessness and psychiatric diagnosis (mental retardation) in CPI 2; tooth brushing habits and psychiatric diagnosis (schizophrenia) in CPI 3; and only helplessness in CPI 4. The present study underlines a considerable need for prevention and treatment of periodontal disease among chronic psychiatric patients in Istanbul. Efforts need to be focused above all on raising this population's awareness of the importance of oral hygiene and on early diagnosis of periodontal problems.\n\nExtrapulmonary tuberculosis: 7 year-experience of a tertiary center in Istanbul.\n\nPubMed\n\nSevgi, DÄ±lek YÄ±ldÄ±z; Derin, Okan; Alpay, AlÄ± SeydÄ±; GÃ¼ndÃ¼z, Alper; Konuklar, Ahmet SanlÄ±; Bayraktar, Banu; Bulut, Emin; Uzun, Nuray; Sonmez, EmÄ±ne\n\n2013-12-01\n\nAlthough a decreasing trend of tuberculosis (TB) was reported in Turkey, higher proportion of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPT) was revealed. In this retrospective study, clinical and laboratory data of 141 EPT patients were evaluated for a seven-year period by using descriptive statistics, and parametric and non-parametric tests where appropriate. The most frequent types of EPT were meningeal TB (23%) and TB lymphadenitis (21%), respectively. Other types of EPT were skeletal, miliary, peritoneal, abscess, genitourinarial, cutaneous and gastrointestinal involvement which ranged between 18% and 1%. Mean age was 42 and female/male ratio was almost equal. All patients were born in Turkey. Although all of them were permanent residents of Istanbul, 73% of the patients came from East and Southeast Region of Turkey. For the patients, being older than 40 years old (p<0.01), having miliary TB (p<0.05) and high CRP levels (p<0.05) were found to be associated with mortality. EPT still remains as a significant morbidity and mortality reason in lower income populations and developing countries. In our study, although all patients were residents of Istanbul approximately two thirds of them have migrated from East and Southeast parts of the country. The relatively high prevalence of tuberculosis cases in Istanbul may be due to the permanent migration from other parts of the country. Early diagnosis and initiation of appropriate treatment are the keys for reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with EPT, particularly in the cases of older ages.

Tevfik; Deniz, Rasim; Ozener, Haluk; Albayrak, Muge; Ulug, Rasit; Basoglu, Burak\n\n2017-04-01\n\nAstro-geodetic deflections of the vertical components provide accurate and valuable information of Earth's gravity filed. Conventional methods require considerable effort and time whereas new methods, namely digital zenith camera systems (DZCS), have been designed to eliminate drawbacks of the conventional methods, such as observer dependent errors, long observation times, and to improve the observation accuracy. The observation principle is based on capturing star images near zenithal direction to determine astronomical coordinates of the station point with the integration of CCD, telescope, tiltmeters, and GNSS devices. In Turkey a new DZCS have been designed and tested on control network located in Istanbul, of which the geoid height differences were known with the accuracy of Â±3.5 cm. Astro-geodetic Camera System (ACSYS) was used to determine the deflections of the vertical components with an accuracy of Â±0.1 - 0.3 arc seconds, and results were compared with geoid height differences using astronomical levelling procedure. The results have also been compared with the ones calculated from global geopotential models. In this study the recent results of the first digital zenith camera system of Turkey are presented and the future studies are introduced such as the current developments of the system including hardware and software upgrades as well as the new observation strategy of the ACSYS. We also discuss the contribution and integration of the astro-geodetic deflections of the vertical components to the geoid determination studies in the light of information of current ongoing projects being operated in Turkey.\n\nMegacity and Air Pollution in the Eastern Mediterranean: Istanbul Case Study\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nUnal, Alper; Kindap, Tayfun; Im, Ulas; Markakis, Kostas; Mihalopoulos, Nikos; Gerasopoulos, Evangelos; Kocak, Mustafa; Mangir, Nizamettin; Kubilay, Nilgun; Kanakidou, Maria\n\n2010-05-01\n\nTurkey, with a population of 75 million, is located at the confluence of Europe and Asia. Istanbul is at the hearth of Turkey's fast economic growth. The city has an annual growth of 3.7% and, according to a study conducted by OECD, is ranked 12th among 45 OECD metro-regions. Istanbul generates 27% of Turkey's Gross Domestic Product (GDP); 40% of tax revenues; and 38% of total industrial output (OECD, 2008). As a result, Istanbul is facing a variety of challenging environmental problems affecting more than 15 million people. Observations show that the number of days exceeding the 24-hour limit value of 50 Î¼gm-3 reached 157 in 2008, with a significant increase from previous years. The city is also a hot spot of pollutant emissions for the surrounding Eastern Mediterranean area. As part of the CityZEN project, in order to quantify the contribution of this megacity as a source of air pollution in the Eastern Mediterranean, a climatological trajectory analysis using a regional climate model output (RegCM3) and a high resolution regional modeling study were performed using the Models-3 WRF meteorological and CMAQ air quality models. Trajectory approach was used to identify the effects of Istanbul emissions on other cities in regional scale. A 30-year (1961-1990) period RegCM3 simulations were used to get a meaningful evaluation. The trajectories were computed according to a method described by Pettersen (1956) as a forward trajectory approach in a 27-km grid resolution. An air parcel was released once every 6h and a total of 42,368 air parcels (trajectories) were released during these 30 years. Long-term meteorological observations in Istanbul show northeasterly and southwesterly prevailing winds over the city. According to these prevailing winds, the distributions of trajectories were mainly observed from the north and south directions of the city. In order to run an air quality model, anthropogenic emission inventory was compiled from a number of different sources\n\nSeismic hazard communication in Istanbul\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIckert, Johanna\n\n2015-04-01\n\nConflicting societal conceptions of earthquake safety provide challenges but also opportunities for the communication of seismic hazards. This paradox is exemplified in the controversial social reactions to the ongoing 'urban renewal projects' in Istanbul. Seismologists estimate that there is a high probability that a major earthquake will strike Istanbul in the next decade or so. Detailed earthquake risk analysis, and direct experience of the losses suffered during the major earthquakes that struck Turkey in 1999 and 2011, have engendered a broad societal recognition of the need for extensive earthquake preparedness and response planning. However, there has been dissent concerning the democratic legitimation of some of Istanbul's mitigation measures, most notably the implementation of the 'Law for the Regeneration of Areas Under Disaster Risk' (Law 6306, known as the 'disaster law') in May 2012. The strong interconnections between geological 'matters of fact' and societal 'matters of concern' raise fundamental questions for geocommunication on how to deal with this societal complexity, particularly in terms of maintaining trust in the geoscientist. There is a growing recognition among geoscientists that achieving disaster resilience in Istanbul is not solely the domain of 'earthquake experts' but rather requires a shared societal responsibility. However, the question arises as to how geocommunication can be designed to respond to this increased demand for interdisciplinarity and civil participation. This research will confront this question, exploring ways to combine qualitative and quantitative analyses, values and preferred norms with facts and observations, and be organised around an interactive web-based documentary platform that integrates multiple knowledge bases and seeks to help connect different communication cultures.\n\nMultidisciplinary Geo-scientific Hazard Analyses: Istanbul Microzonation Projects\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKara, Sema; BaÅ, Mahmut; KÄ±lÄ±Ã§, Osman; Tarih, Ahmet; Yahya MenteÅe, Emin; Duran, Kemal\n\n2017-04-01\n\nIstanbul (Turkey) is located on the west edge of North Anatolia Fault and hence is an earthquake prone city with a population that exceeds 15 million people. In addition, the city is still growing as center of commerce, tourism and culture that increases the exposure more and more. During the last decade, although Istanbul grew faster than ever in its history, precautions against a possible earthquake have also increased steadily. The two big earthquakes (in Kocaeli and Duzce Provinces) occurred in 1999 alongside Istanbul and these events became the trigger events that accelerated the disaster risk reduction activities in Istanbul. Following a loss estimation study carried out by Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in 2001 and Istanbul Earthquake Master Plan prepared by four major universities' researchers in 2003; it was evaluated that understanding and analyzing the geological structure in Istanbul was the main concern. Thereafter Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality's Directorate of Earthquake and Ground Research (DEGRE) carried out two major geo-scientific studies called \"microzonation studies\" covering 650 km2 of Istanbul's urbanized areas between 2006 and 2009. The studies were called \"microzonation\" because the analysis resolution was as dense as 250m grids and included various assessments on hazards such as ground shaking, liquefaction, karstification, landslide, flooding, and surface faulting. After the evaluation of geological, geotechnical and geophysical measurements; Earthquake and Tsunami Hazard Maps for all Istanbul, slope, engineering geology, ground water level, faulting, ground shaking, inundation, shear wave velocity and soil classification maps for the project areas were obtained. In the end \"Land Suitability Maps\" are derived from the combination of inputs using multi-hazard approach. As a result, microzonation is tool for risk oriented urban planning; consisting of interdisciplinary multi-hazard risk analyses.

The association between the use of alcohol and/or drugs by drivers and the increased risk of traffic accidents with a high risk of death and injury has been well described in the literature. This study aimed to review the incidence of cases of driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) among all cases of driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol and/or other drugs involved in traffic accidents and to evaluate the type of the psychoactive drugs (with or without alcohol) detected in blood samples in Istanbul and its surrounding area. This study is the first investigation on the subject of DUID cases in Turkey. The reports of the Istanbul Toxicology Department of the Council of Forensic Medicine (Turkey) on suspected DUID cases involved in traffic accidents between 1 July 2010 and 30 June 2011 were retrospectively reviewed for alcohol and/or drug use. Alcohol analysis was requested in 4274 suspected DUI cases, whereas drug along with alcohol analysis was requested in only 91. The rate of suspected DUID cases (n = 91) among the suspected DUI cases (n = 4274) was only 2.1% and in this study, we evaluated only the DUID cases in detail. Alcohol was present in 44% of suspected DUID cases. Psychoactive drugs were present in 15.4% of cases. The incidence among 46 confirmed DUID cases was found to be 17.4% for cannabis, 8.7% for benzodiazepines, 4.3% for barbiturates, 4.3% for antidepressants, 2.2% for cocaine and 2.2% for amphetamines. Although there is a zero-tolerance approach for DUID in the Turkish regulations, it is not well recognised and not inspected by police and legal authorities who are responsible for taking measures in traffic accidents and for routine traffic controls in Turkey. It is concluded that psychoactive drugs should be checked as well as alcohol in all traffic accident cases and roadside controls.

In addition to determining prevention and treatment strategies with vaccines and antivirals, surveillance data plays an important role in combat against influenza. Surveillance provides valuable data on characteristics of influenza activity, on types, sub-types, antigenic properties and antiviral resistance profile of circulating viruses in a given region. The first influenza surveillance was initiated as a pilot study in 2003 by now named National Influenza Reference Laboratory, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine. Surveillance was launched at national level by Ministry of Health in 2004 and two National Influenza Laboratories, one in Istanbul and the other in Ankara, have been conducting surveillance in Turkey. Surveillance data obtained for nine consecutive years, 2003-2012, by National Influenza Reference Laboratory in Istanbul Faculty of Medicine have been summarized in this report. During 2003-2012 influenza surveillance seasons, a total of 11.077 nasal swabs collected in viral transport medium were sent to the National Influenza Reference Laboratory, Istanbul for analysis. Immun-capture ELISA followed by MDCK cell culture was used for detection of influenza viruses before 2009 and real-time RT-PCR was used thereafter. Antigenic characterizations were done by hemagglutination inhibition assay with the reactives supplied by World Health Organization. Analysis of the results showed that influenza B viruses have entered the circulation in 2005-2006 seasons, and have contributed to the epidemics at increasing rates every year except in the 2009 pandemic season. Influenza B Victoria and Yamagata lineages were cocirculating for two seasons. For other seasons either lineage was in circulation. Antigenic characterization revealed that circulating B viruses matched the vaccine composition either partially or totally for only\n\nAn investigation into the relationship between region specific quality of life and adverse tuberculosis treatment outcomes in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nPubMed\n\nBabalik, A; Kiziltas, S; Gencer, S; Kilicaslan, Z\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIstanbul has the highest incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in Turkey. It is also the largest city, with considerable differences in quality of life across its urban regions. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between (i) the diverse quality of life across specific urban regions, (ii) TB incidence rates, inclusive of demographic and clinical characteristics of TB patients, and (iii) adverse treatment outcomes. This retrospective study included 23,845 new TB patients (recorded in the National TB Registry between 2006 and 2010) in Istanbul. Thirty-nine urban districts of Istanbul were ranked into five groups on the basis of an urban quality of life index. Patient data were matched with these groups, and further categorized according to 'age', 'sex', 'country of birth' and 'antibiotics resistance'. Adverse treatment outcomes and TB incidence rates were extracted from official records. Logistic regression, clustered analyses, 95% CI and p values (STATA) were reported to describe the association between variables. Six per cent of total cases had 'at least one adverse treatment outcome' (default 3.8%, failure 0.5%, death 1.7% in total cases). 'An adverse treatment outcome' was found to be associated with age OR (CI 95%) (1.02 (1.01-1.03)); 'male sex' 1.65 (1.28-2.12); 'other country of birth' 4.82 (3.05-7.62); 100,000 per 'over 60' insidence goups 1.61 (1.32-1.97), the lowest quality of life index 0.65 (0.47-0.83). Patients with high tuberculosis risk factors living in high incidence regions need to be closely monitored. Patients living in lower ranking regions are more likely to have 'poor treatment outcomes'.

This study was conducted between June 2013 and June 2014 by participation of 7 medical centers in Istanbul. Candida spp strains isolated from the clinical specimens of pediatric patients were included. Clinical features were recorded on a standardized data collection sheet. A total of 134 systemic Candida infections were identified in 134 patients. The patients were admitted in pediatric and neonatal intensive care units (41.8% and 9.7%, respectively) and in pediatric wards (48.5%). Candida albicans was the most prevalent species (47%), followed by Candida parapsilosis (13.4%), Candida tropicalis (8.2%), Candida glabrata (4.5%), Candida lusitaniae (3.7%), Candida kefyr (2.2%), Candida guilliermondii (1.5%), Candida dubliniensis (0.7%), and Candida krusei (0.7%). Types of Candida infections were candidemia (50.7%), urinary tract infection (33.6%), surgical site infection (4.5%), central nervous system infection (3.7%), catheter infection (3.7%), and intra-abdominal infection (3.7%). In multivariate analysis, younger age (1-24 months) and detection of non-albicans Candida spp was found to be risk factors associated with candidemia (Pâ=â0.040; odds ratio [OR], 4.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-15.86; and Pâ=â0.02; OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.10-5.53, respectively). This study provides an update for the epidemiology of nosocomial Candida infections in Istanbul, which is important for the management of patients and implementation of appropriate infection control measures.

It was conducted at a university hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. The sample included 93 patients: 73 male, mean age 57.89 (12.13) years. Prehospital delay time ranged from 15 minutes to 10 days, with a median of 2 hours (interquartile range: 9.50). Patients waited for pain to go away (48.4%) and tried to calm down (39.8%). Most patients attributed AMI-related symptoms to a reason other than heart disease. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, the type of AMI was classified based on electrocardiography findings (odds ratio 5.18, 95% confidence interval: 1.69-15.91, P=0.004) and was independently associated with a long prehospital delay time, indicating that patients with ST segment elevation MI would seek early medical care. Misinterpretation of symptoms and misconceptions about emergency treatment during AMI cause delays in admission and may affect treatment.\n\nShaded Relief and Radar Image with Color as Height, Bosporus Strait and Istanbul, Turkey\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThe Bosporus (also spelled Bosphorus) is a strait that connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara in the center of this view of northwest Turkey, taken during the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. The water of the Black Sea at the top of the image and Sea of Marmara below the center are colored blue in this image, along with several large lakes. The largest lake, to the lower right of the Sea of Marmara, is Iznik Lake. The Bosporus (Turkish Bogazici) Strait is considered to be the boundary between Europe and Asia, and the large city of Istanbul, Turkey is located on both sides of the southern end of the strait, visible as a brighter (light green to white) area on the image due to its stronger reflection of radar. Istanbul is the modern name for a city with along history, previously called Constantinople and Byzantium. It was rebuilt as the capital of the Roman Empire in 330 A.D. by Constantine on the site of an earlier Greek city, and it was later the capital of the Byzantine and Ottoman empires until 1922. The Gulf of Izmit is the narrow gulf extending to the east (right) from the Sea of Marmara. The city of Izmit at the end of the gulf was heavily damaged by a large magnitude 7.4 earthquake on August 17,1999, often called the Izmit earthquake (also known as the Kocaeli, Turkey, earthquake), that killed at least 17,000 people. A previous earthquake under the Gulf of Izmit in 1754 killed at least 2,000people. The Izmit earthquake ruptured a long section of the North Anatolian Fault system from off the right side of this image continuing under the Gulf of Izmit. Another strand of the North Anatolian Fault system is visible as a sharp linear feature in the topography south of Iznik Lake. Bathymetric surveys show that the north Anatolian Fault system extends beneath and has formed the Sea of Marmara, in addition to the Gulf of Izmit and Iznik Lake. Scientists are studying the North Anatolian Fault system to determine the risk of a large earthquake on the\n\nThe Lice, Turkey, earthquake of September 6, 1975; a preliminary engineering investigation\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nYanev, P. I.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nThe Fifth European Conference on Earthquake Engineering was held on September 22 through 25 in Istanbul, Turkey. The opening speech by the Honorable H. E. Nurettin Ok, Minister of Reconstruction and Resettlement of Turkey, introduced the several hundred delegates to the realities of earthquake hazards in Turkey:\n\nDetermination of in-service needs of Turkish high school science teachers in Istanbul\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOgan, Feral\n\nThe purposes of this study were to identify the in-service needs of high school science teachers in Istanbul, Turkey according to the subgroups such as school type and gender and determine the priority obstacles preventing these science teachers from attendance at in-service programs. Moreover, this study aimed to find the other greatest needs of high school science teachers that are not mentioned in the survey instrument. The data for this research was gathered by conducting a survey in Istanbul, Turkey in Fall 2001 and Spring 2002 Semesters. Turkish translation of the modified version of a science teacher's needs inventory, Science Teacher Inventory of Need (STIN), entitled STIN-2 was used as the survey instrument. The subjects consisted of 75 high school science teachers who were selected from 369 high schools by using stratified random sampling in grades nine through eleven. By personally administering the survey, 422 science teachers from 75 high schools completed the survey and a 97% response rate was achieved. The results obtained in this study show that Turkish high school science teachers in Istanbul have a number of shared needs. One other indication is that they also have a number of needs, which are specific to subgroups of those science teachers.\n\nSite effects in Avcilar, West of Istanbul, Turkey, from strong- and weak-motion data\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nOzel, O.; Cranswick, E.; Meremonte, M.; Erdik, M.; Safak, E.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nApproximately 1000 people were killed in the collapse of buildings in Istanbul, Turkey, during the 17 August 1999 I??zmit earthquake, whose epicenter was roughly 90 km east of the city. Most of the fatalities and damage occurred in the suburb of Avcilar that is 20 km further west of the epicenter than the city proper. To investigate this pattern of damage, the U.S. Geologic"
