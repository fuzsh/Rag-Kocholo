        "text": "Fact check: Biden falsely claims he gained ground in post-debate New York Times poll\n\nIn his Friday interview with ABC, President Joe Biden claimed that “the New York Times had me down 10 points before the debate, nine now, or whatever the hell it is.” ABC aired the remark in an initial excerpt from the interview, which has not yet aired in full.\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claim that he gained a point in New York Times polling after the debate is false. In fact, the Times’ post-debate poll, conducted with Siena College, showed Biden doing three points worse against former President Donald Trump than he had done in the final Times/Siena poll before the debate.\n\nBiden’s specific numbers were also wrong. He was not “down 10 points before the debate” in Times/Siena polling. In fact, he was down three percentage points with likely voters and six percentage points with registered voters. In the Times/Siena poll after the debate, those margins grew to six percentage points with likely voters and nine percentage points with registered voters.\n\nBiden did acknowledge his uncertainty about the data when he said “or whatever the hell it is.” But he was wrong, nonetheless.\n\nAnalysis: Biden should undergo detailed cognitive and neurological testing and share his results\n\nWhen the 46th President of the United States took the debate stage a week ago, it became apparent, even from his first answer, that this would not be the performance he hoped for.\n\nFor me as a brain specialist, it was concerning to watch President Joe Biden, and it quickly became clear that I was not alone in my reaction. Over the past week, I received more than a dozen calls, texts and emails from medical colleagues who, like me, specialize in the brain. It wasn’t that what we noticed was necessarily new but that it was particularly pronounced, and right from the start of the debate.\n\nFrom a neurological standpoint, we were concerned with his confused rambling; sudden loss of concentration in the middle of a sentence; halting speech and absence of facial animation, resulting at times in a flat, open-mouthed expression. To be clear, these are only observations, not in any way diagnostic of something deeper, and none of these doctors wished to suggest that was the case.\n\nThe consensus from the doctors reaching out to me, however, was that the president should be encouraged to undergo detailed cognitive and movement disorder testing, and those results should be made available to the public.\n\nOver the past five years, I have reported extensively on the advances in the world of treating and reducing risk of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease, Lewy body dementia and vascular dementia. For the documentary “The Last Alzheimer’s Patient,” I even went through extensive cognitive testing to demonstrate what it entailed and determine whether I had problems with executive functioning, judgment or memory lapses, as well as blood tests to determine things like the level of abnormal proteins that may be present in my brain and my B12 levels. My sense of smell and my genetic risk factors were checked. This type of testing is not necessary for most people as a matter of routine, but every one of the brain doctors I spoke to recommended that level of examination for Biden.\n\nRead Dr. Sanjay Gupta’s full analysis\n\nCornel West campaign submits signatures to be on the ballot in Georgia\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Cornel West’s campaign announced they submitted signatures in Georgia, a key battleground state whose electorate includes a sizable coalition of Black voters — a group West has been aggressively courting.\n\nWest’s campaign announced on Friday they’ve submitted more than four times the required number of signatures necessary to gain ballot access in Georgia. Independent presidential candidates must submit 7,500 valid signatures to qualify for ballot access in the state.\n\nWest’s campaign said in a statement its signature collection effort in Georgia “reflects a strategic focus on engaging with diverse communities across the state.” The statement also said West’s campaign will focus its ballot access efforts on “other key battleground states, further solidifying its presence and impact on the national stage.”\n\nGaining ballot access in Georgia and other battleground states could allow West, a prominent Black intellectual and progressive champion, to pull some Black voters and progressive voters away from President Biden in the most critical parts of the country. Biden won the 2020 election by earning the vast majority of support from Black voters, but some polls have indicated his support has dropped.\n\nWest is currently on the ballot in four states: South Carolina, Alaska, Oregon and Colorado.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Seth Moulton officially calls for Biden to step aside\n\nDemocratic Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton is formally calling on President Joe Biden to leave the race.\n\nSydney Simon, Moulton’s communications director, told CNN it is indeed a formal call for Biden to go after Moulton had a few days to sleep on it.\n\n“The exact mechanism that we should follow in order for other leaders to rise up, whether it’s some sort of primary process, whether it goes directly to Vice President (Kamala) Harris, I’m not sure about that, that’s yet to be determined,” Moulton also told WBUR. “And that’s in many ways the substance of the deep, honest conversations that Democrats are having behind the scenes now and over the course of the past week.”\n\n“I deeply respect President Biden and all the great things he has done for America, but I have grave concerns about his ability to defeat Donald Trump,” Moulton said in a statement Tuesday. “The unfortunate reality is that the status quo will likely deliver us President Trump.”\n\nBiden says he hasn't watched his debate performance\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he has not watched a replay of his performance, but asked if he knew how badly it was going, he took ownership, saying it was “nobody’s fault but mine.”\n\nWhen asked if he has watched the debate since it took place, Biden said, “I don’t think I did, no.”\n\nAs he answered the question, Biden offered a confusing tangent on New York Times polling.\n\nPressed on his performance, he said, “Well I was just having a bad night.”\n\nThe conversation marked Biden’s first televised interview since his debate performance, a high-stakes moment for his political future as a mounting list of Democrats – lawmakers, donors, and voters – express concerns about the viability of his candidacy.\n\nWatch what Biden told ABC:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\n7c2c428e-bb48-43a3-bcee-dba221b07d2b.mp4\n\n03:53 - Source: cnn\n\nBiden downplays poor debate performance: \"I had a bad night\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Friday downplayed his poor performance in last week’s debate, offering additional excuses for the showing and adding that it was his fault alone.\n\nThe president said he was “sick” and “feeling terrible” before the debate. Asked whether it was a bad episode or a sign of a more serious condition, Biden dismissed those concerns.\n\n“It was a bad episode. No indication of any serious condition. I didn’t listen to my instincts in terms of preparing, and I had a bad night,” he said in an interview taped Friday afternoon with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos.\n\nBiden added: “Because I was sick – I was feeling terrible. As a matter of fact, the docs with me I asked if they did a Covid test, they were trying to figure out what’s wrong. They did a test to see whether or not I had some infection, you know, a virus. I didn’t. I just had a really bad cold.”\n\nJeffries calls virtual meeting Sunday for ranking members amid questions about Biden, source says\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called a virtual meeting on Sunday for Democratic committee ranking members amid questions about President Joe Biden’s viability as the 2024 standard-bearer, a Democratic lawmaker confirms.\n\nNBC first reported the meeting.\n\nBiden says he's \"completely ruling out\" getting out of the 2024 race\n\nPresident Joe Biden told reporters before boarding Air Force One that he is “completely ruling out” getting out of the 2024 race, remaining defiant in the wake of his debate performance sparking questions about his age and fitness for office.\n\n“Completely ruling that out,” Biden said from the tarmac in Madison, Wisconsin, when asked if he was going to drop out of the race.\n\nThe president also said he’s spoken to 20 members of Congress but did not name them. He said they are telling him to “stay in the race.”\n\nWhen asked about The Washington Post reporting that Sen. Mark Warner is working to get Senate Democrats to ask President Biden to step aside in the 2024 race, the president appeared to say that Warner was the “only one considering that.”\n\nBiden was also asked about Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey’s statement urging Biden to “carefully evaluate” whether he remains Democrats’ best hope to defeat Trump. Biden said that Healey “didn’t say anything when I was in the room.”\n\nBiden was also asked how his ABC News interview went, and he told reporters he “thought it was a good interview.”\n\nWatch:\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\n87220193-886c-4662-ab50-8aad5c148d16.mp4\n\n01:20 - Source: cnn\n\nSenior administration official downplays Biden debate impact on upcoming NATO summit\n\nA US senior administration official on Friday downplayed the impact of President Joe Biden’s debate performance on his interaction with leaders as part of the administration’s preview of next week’s NATO summit.\n\n“Foreign leaders have seen Joe Biden up close and personal for the last three years. They know who they’re dealing with, and they know how effective he’s been,” the official said on a call with reporters.\n\nAs CNN reported Friday, there will “certainly be a spotlight,” in the words of one former US senior diplomat, on Biden at the NATO summit after his poor debate showing last week. Biden will be under immense pressure to perform well at the high-stakes gathering and show that he is still a viable competitor to former President Donald Trump, multiple diplomats told CNN.\n\nBiden will welcome the world leaders to Washington, DC, for the 75th anniversary summit on Tuesday evening when he and first lady Jill Biden host a commemorative event at the Mellon Auditorium, where the Washington Treaty, which formed the basis for NATO, was signed.\n\nDefiant Biden pledges to stay in the 2024 race: \"I'm the nominee of this party\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden defiantly pledged to remain in the 2024 race Friday despite growing worries from within the Democratic Party in the wake of his debate performance sparking questions about his age and fitness for office.\n\nBiden also took direct aim at Donald Trump, prompting cheers as he said that he beat Trump and will “beat him again in 2020” — the president seeming to reference the last time he went head-to-head with Trump, instead of 2024.\n\nThat message was punctuated by the choice of music as the president glad-handed with some rally attendees on stage: Tom Petty’s “I Won’t Back Down.”\n\nOne voter, Jeff Martinson, told CNN after the rally that seeing Biden speak Friday changed his calculus. Martinson, a Wisconsin voter, initially had some “concerns” about the president but came away from Friday’s rally saying the president gave a “very good showing.” Biden’s speech was forceful and energetic, though he made a few verbal slip-ups.\n\nAs Biden took the stage, a rally attendee appeared to unfurl a sign reading, “Pass the torch, Joe.” The sign was visible for a few moments before someone else tried to cover part of it with a Biden-Harris sign. The sign-holder crumpled up the sign after a few moments and stayed on the stage for the remainder of the president’s remarks.\n\nRFK Jr. resubmits signatures in Nevada after inaccurate guidance jeopardized original signatures\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign announced it resubmitted signatures in Nevada on Wednesday after the Nevada Secretary of State’s office provided the campaign with inaccurate information that could have potentially made their first batch of signatures invalid.\n\nKennedy’s campaign announced on Friday they submitted 30,000 additional signatures earlier this week to the state office as they fight to qualify in the key battleground state. Independent presidential candidates must submit 10,095 signatures to qualify for Nevada’s ballot.\n\nSome background: In March, the campaign announced it had submitted 15,000 signatures to Nevada’s elections office. Later that month, Nevada Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar’s office admitted it “provided inaccurate guidance” to Kennedy’s campaign about laws governing signature collecting in the state. Presidential candidates must have their vice-presidential nominee on ballot access petitions in Nevada. Kennedy did not announce his running mate Nicole Shanahan until late March, weeks after the campaign submitted its first batch of signatures.\n\nLast month, the Kennedy campaign filed a lawsuit against Aguilar seeking an injunction to block him from enforcing the state law requiring independent candidates to name their running mate prior to collecting signatures. In a statement, Kennedy campaign senior counsel Paul Rossi made no indication they would drop the lawsuit against Aguilar despite submitting additional signatures.\n\nRFK Jr. gains ballot access in New Mexico\n\nIndependent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has qualified for the presidential ballot in New Mexico, the state’s elections office confirmed Friday, marking the eighth state where Kennedy has gained ballot access.\n\nKennedy submitted over 11,000 signatures to the New Mexico Secretary of State’s Office on Monday, well over the 3,562 valid signatures required by independent presidential candidates to gain ballot access in the state.\n\nA spokesperson for the office confirmed Kennedy’s petition is valid, pointing to a list on the secretary of state’s website of potential candidates indicating Kennedy has qualified.\n\nKennedy has previously qualified in Michigan, California, Tennessee, Utah, Oklahoma, Hawaii and Delaware. With the addition of New Mexico, he is eligible to receive 105 electoral votes.\n\nHe has also submitted petitions or completed signature gathering in several other states.\n\nSen. Mark Warner looks to align Democratic senators amid questions over Biden’s future\n\nAn effort is underway by Virginia Sen. Mark Warner to get Senate Democrats on the same page about the future of President Joe Biden’s reelection bid, sources told CNN.\n\nWarner, who is taking on a leadership role in the effort, is reaching a place where he thinks it is time for Biden to suspend his reelection campaign, a source familiar with his efforts told CNN.\n\nWarner’s meeting with his colleagues, first reported by The Washington Post, is expected to take place Monday, according to a source familiar with the planning.\n\nWarner declined CNN’s request for comment.\n\nHis spokeswoman, Rachel Cohen, neither confirmed nor denied the senator’s efforts in a statement to the Post earlier Friday.\n\n“Like many other people in Washington and across the country, Senator Warner believes these are critical days for the president’s campaign, and he has made that clear to the White House,” Cohen said.\n\nBiden at campaign rally: \"I am running and gonna win again\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden began his campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin, by wishing the crowd a happy Fourth of July and reiterating his plans to stay in the presidential race.\n\n“You probably heard we had a little debate last week,” he said. “Can’t say it was my best performance. But ever since then, there’s been a lot of speculation. ‘What’s Joe going to do? Is he going to stay in the race? Is he going to drop out? What’s he going to do?’”\n\nBiden spoke forcefully and was notably energetic throughout his speech, though he did have a couple of verbal slip-ups.\n\nSome Biden supporters attending Wisconsin rally express \"concerns\" about the president\n\nSome Biden supporters attending his Wisconsin rally say they have “concerns” about President Joe Biden leading the Democratic ticket in the wake of his debate performance – even as others say he’s up to the job.\n\nJeff Martinson, a supporter of the president in 2020, told CNN that he has “concerns” about the president’s ability to conduct a campaign. Martinson added that he hasn’t seen the president come out “forcefully enough to assert his capabilities” in past week after the president’s poor performance at CNN’s presidential debate.\n\nAnother voter CNN spoke to said she thinks Biden is the “right man for the job” and does not think that he should step aside.\n\n“I think he’s the right man for the job,” Andrea Straus told CNN.\n\nShana Verstegen from Madison, Wisconsin, told CNN that she thought the debate was “hard to watch” and made “excuses” for the president. The fitness professional, who brought her kids to Friday’s rally, conceded that if the American people are feeling nervous, then she is a “little nervous too.”\n\nDemocratic lawmaker says next week will be \"critical\" for Biden as he holds high-stakes public events\n\nDemocratic Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia said on Friday that the next week will be “critical” and “very consequential” for President Joe Biden to put to rest — or not — the questions that have arisen since his debate performance.\n\nConnolly said the next week will be “very telling,” and he thinks Biden has to show “mental acuity, mental alertness, humor, spontaneity.”\n\nWhen asked if Biden gives the party the best shot to win in November, Connolly said, “I don’t think we know that yet. I think everybody is waiting for the dust to settle from the aftermath of the debate.”\n\nHow Trump is quietly planning around Biden’s uncertain future\n\nFor much of the past year, Donald Trump and his allies have speculated that Joe Biden would not end up as the Democratic presidential nominee – suggesting without evidence that he would step down before the convention and be replaced by another candidate.\n\nNow, with Biden facing an increasingly uncertain political future amid the fallout from his shaky debate performance, Republicans are trying to determine what the Democratic incumbent stepping aside would actually mean for the Trump campaign. And some believe the path back to the White House would likely be easier with Biden at the top of the ticket.\n\nTrump and his allies have relished the extended spotlight on Biden this week, with the former president making the rare decision to lay low at his New Jersey club and allow Biden to be the story. Trump has no public events on his schedule, and his campaign surprised some aides and advisers by telling them to enjoy the Fourth of July holiday.\n\nMeanwhile, campaign advisers and key allies have been calling reporters and friendly Democrats, hunting for any clues into what might happen next should Biden ultimately walk away from his reelection bid.\n\nUntil now, the campaign and its allies have largely ignored Vice President Kamala Harris in waging their attacks against the Biden administration. But there are signs that posture is changing. On Wednesday, a super PAC aligned with Trump, MAGA, Inc., launched its opening salvo against Harris by attacking her oversight of Biden’s border policies in an email. It asked if Harris is “The Best They Got?”\n\nKeep reading here about Trump’s strategy.\n\nMassachusetts governor urges Biden to \"carefully evaluate\" whether he is the party's best hope to defeat Trump\n\nDemocratic Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey issued a statement Friday urging President Joe Biden to “carefully evaluate” whether he remains the Democratic Party’s best hope to defeat Donald Trump in the 2024 election.\n\n“The best way forward right now is a decision for the President to make. Over the coming days, I urge him to listen to the American people and carefully evaluate whether he remains our best hope to defeat Donald Trump,” she added.\n\n“Whatever President Biden decides, I am committed to doing everything in my power to defeat Donald Trump,” the governor continued.\n\nMoments ago, President Biden arrived in Madison, Wisconsin, where he will appear at a campaign event before an evening interview with ABC News.\n\nBiden met with Democratic governors at the White House earlier this week.\n\nTrump presses Judge Cannon to take up immunity question in Florida classified documents case\n\nActivity continues to swirl in the many legal battles that former President Donald Trump faces. Attorneys for Trump are now seeking to use the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity decision to help him in his criminal case in Florida over mishandling of classified documents.\n\nIn a new court filing Friday, Trump’s team said they want an updated schedule in the federal classified documents case so they can argue points related to the Supreme Court decision.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s decision directly applies to the federal case over 2020 election subversion efforts in Washington, DC, but it could impact all four of the criminal cases against the former president.\n\nIn the filing Friday, Trump’s attorneys also noted Justice Clarence Thomas’s concurrence to the decision, questioning the validity of Special Counsel Jack Smith’s appointment. His attorneys argue that Thomas “adds force” to motions Trump has filed against how Smith was appointed and funded.\n\nCNN previously reported that Trump’s legal team planned to use this week’s Supreme Court opinion to try to get key evidence in the classified documents case tossed out, and Wednesday’s filing is the first step toward that end.\n\nThe move is likely to further elongate an already convoluted and slow road to trial in Cannon’s courtroom in Fort Pierce, Florida. The judge has yet to decide a number of pretrial matters, including some motions that have been languishing on her docket for months.\n\nWhite House defends Biden’s plans to get more sleep, saying he is \"striking a balance\"\n\nThe White House defended President Joe Biden’s latest comments on his schedule, arguing that the president is trying to strike a balance.\n\nCNN previously reported that Biden told Democratic governors during a meeting at the White House this week that part of his plan going forward is to get more sleep and stop planning events after 8 p.m.\n\nBiden’s comment to the governors, which left some in the room frustrated, came as he tried to reassure allies on the heels of his halting debate performance last week. A Biden campaign aide argued that, as well as doing debate prep in the week after his two trips to Europe, Biden was engaged in hours of official work in addition to the hours of campaign work.\n\n“He said he understands about striking the right balance,” Jean-Pierre said, when pressed if there will be a change in the future. “He is human, just like we all are, but it is a 24/7 job. It is 365 days a week that doesn’t change.”\n\nAmid questions about the president’s schedule, the Biden campaign announced what it cast as an “aggressive travel schedule” in July that includes visiting battleground states.\n\nWhite House press secretary admits Biden had \"verbal check-in\" with doctor, contradicting previous statement\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Friday that President Joe Biden had a “verbal check-in” with his doctor after repeatedly saying Wednesday that the president has had no medical exams since his February physical.\n\nThe admission comes after the president contradicted her public comments in a closed-door meeting with more than 20 Democratic governors. She cast Biden’s check-in as “a conversation” with his doctor, Kevin O’Connor.\n\nJean-Pierre on Wednesday dismissed the question, telling briefing room reporters, “It’s a cold, guys. It’s a cold.” she said. “I know that it affects everybody differently. We’ve all had colds, and so no, he was not checked out by the doctor.”\n\nShe spoke broadly Friday about how Biden as president has “a medical unit around him 24/7,” as is standard procedure for all modern US presidents.\n\nAnalysis: What happened to Lyndon B. Johnson, the last president not to run for a second term\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who is dogged by questions about his acuity, has privately acknowledged that the next few days are a critical test of his reelection campaign, according to CNN’s reporting earlier this week.\n\nHe remains publicly defiant and insists he will remain in the race. But he would not be the first president to step aside rather than seek reelection if he ultimately makes that decision.\n\nMost recently, in 1968, Lyndon B. Johnson shocked the country when he made the surprise announcement that he would not run at the end of an Oval Office speech on his plan to limit US military operations in Vietnam. Here’s part of that address:\n\nWith America’s sons in the fields far away, with America’s future under challenge right here at home, with our hopes and the world’s hopes for peace in the balance every day, I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office – the Presidency of your country. Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President.\n\nNearly 60 years old when he made that speech, Johnson looked much older. He would die of a sudden heart attack in 1973 at 64, before eligibility for retirement programs like Medicare, which he signed into law, and Social Security, which he expanded.\n\nBy the time he bowed out of the race, Johnson, unlike Biden, was facing multiple challenges for the Democratic nomination in the spring of 1968. Racial strife in the US, paired with a country fractured over the war in Vietnam, hurt Johnson’s popularity. In early 1968, the Tet offensive in Vietnam showed Communist forces there to be must stronger than the US military had claimed, and American casualties in the war mounted.\n\nRead more about Johnson’s decision not to run for a second term.\n\nHere's why ABC accelerated the timing of Biden's interview to air Friday night\n\nWhen ABC News first secured its exclusive interview with President Joe Biden, the rollout plan was paint-by-numbers. But these are not normal times. So ABC accelerated its timing.\n\nAnchor George Stephanopoulos is expected to interview Biden on Friday in Wisconsin, the president’s first extended interview with a major media network since his disastrous debate performance last week that has led many in the Democratic Party to question whether Biden should be the nominee.\n\nABC had originally planned to release clips Friday evening, and the whole interview would air during Stephanopoulos’ Sunday morning show, “This Week With George Stephanopoulos.”\n\nRecognizing this extraordinary political moment, however, ABC News realized it would be uncomfortable to hold on to the interview for nearly two days, according to a source familiar with the matter. ABC may have been accused, fairly or not, of hiding something, and the news cycle is moving at a rapid pace.\n\nA network source told CNN that because the story is of “national interest,” ABC decided to make it a “primetime special” to air the same day the interview is taking place. When ABC executives agreed to a time slot for the interview on Friday evening, they notified the White House and changed course, the source said.\n\nThe interview will air in its entirety on Friday evening at 8 p.m. ET, and a full transcript will be posted as well. The interview will be a critical opportunity for voters to be able to gauge Biden’s abilities in an unscripted, high-stakes setting. It’s not clear how long the interview will end up lasting, but ABC affiliates have it slated for a 30-minute special.\n\nRead more on ABC’s interview here.\n\nBiden says he can still beat Trump\n\nPresident Joe Biden projected confidence ahead of a critical day for his political future, telling reporters, “Yes,” he can still beat former President Donald Trump in November.\n\nAsked whether he was ready for today, Biden offered a thumbs up before climbing the steps. He ignored a question about whether it was time for him to drop out.\n\nHe waved at the top.\n\nTrump claims he knows \"nothing\" about Project 2025 and that he disagrees with some of it\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Friday claimed he knew “nothing” about Project 2025, the sweeping policy plan and transition project run by the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, but also said he disagreed with some parts of it.\n\nThe Biden campaign has been taking aim at Project 2025, which is a right-wing plan to dramatically overhaul and reshape the federal government. Project 2025 is not Trump’s official policy platform, and the Trump campaign has previously distanced itself from it and said that any outside groups do not speak for Trump and his campaign.\n\nFor Vance or Rubio to become a Trump vice president pick, they need to overcome their own state governors\n\nThe two Republican senators on Donald Trump’s shortlist for potential running mates may have to overcome some political baggage in the form of their home-state governors to get the nod.\n\nIf Trump picks either Marco Rubio of Florida or JD Vance of Ohio, the senator’s successor would be chosen by a Republican governor who has engaged in high-profile clashes with the former president.\n\nIn Florida, that honor would go to Gov. Ron DeSantis, a onetime ally viewed more recently by Trump as “disloyal” for launching a rival presidential campaign. If Vance is picked, his Ohio replacement would be appointed by Gov. Mike DeWine, who has rarely seen eye-to-eye with the former president.\n\nIt’s a fact that allies of Vance and Rubio are acutely aware of in the intensifying final days leading up to Trump’s announcement — and one they are trying to mitigate against by insisting the other senator has it worse. Pro-Rubio forces have suggested to those who will listen that DeWine would likely replace Vance with someone unaligned with Trump’s MAGA movement.\n\n“It would be a step backwards for the America First agenda,” one such Rubio backer said in making the case against Vance.\n\nRead more about the hurdles potential vice president candidates face.\n\nMost Americans don’t expect Trump to concede if he loses election, according to CNN poll\n\nMost Americans think that former President Donald Trump will not concede if he loses the presidential election in November, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. And despite the vast majority of Americans agreeing that the loser of an election has an obligation to accept the results and concede, only about half of registered voters see Trump’s false claims that he won the 2020 presidential election as a reason to vote against him in 2024.\n\nA 78% majority of Americans say they think that President Joe Biden will accept the results and concede if he loses the election this November.\n\nBut roughly 7 in 10 Americans (71%) doubt that Trump will concede if he loses again in November, while only 28% believe he will. Half of Republicans now say they think Trump would concede a loss, up from 41% in a January poll taken amid the primary season. Among the public overall, doubts that Trump would concede are little changed from January, but remain heightened compared with October 2020, when a smaller 58% majority of US adults said they didn’t expect him to concede if he lost the 2020 election.\n\nIn CNN’s June presidential debate, Trump refused to state unequivocally that he would accept this year’s election results, twice deflecting the question before saying he would do so “if it’s a fair and legal and good election” and repeating claims about election fraud. There is no evidence of election fraud that would have altered the outcome of the 2020 election.\n\nRead more about the poll here.\n\nBiden is ramping up unscripted events, travel and plans $50 million ad buy amid intense scrutiny\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s team is telegraphing a strategy to put the president forth for more casual, unscripted events and an accelerated public schedule as he seeks to shift the narrative away from his poor debate performance.\n\nBiden’s reelection campaign on Friday announced an “aggressive travel schedule” this month that will take him, the vice president, the first lady and the second gentleman to every battleground state following calls from allies to ramp up campaigning and public messaging efforts. In its announcement, the campaign said the president “can also be expected to engage in frequent off-the-cuff moments over the course of the month, as he has consistently throughout this campaign.”\n\nThe president’s reelection campaign will also launch a $50 million “paid media blitz” in July, including what it is calling “strategic investments” during events likely to draw a large swath of voters, such as the 2024 Olympics and the Republican National Convention. The media buys will focus on battleground state voters and include TV, radio and digital ads that the campaign says will focus on abortion, the economy and democracy, and signal the campaign’s ongoing efforts to reach voters through conventional methods.\n\nThe campaign says it’s looking to “capitalize on pivotal high viewership and political diverse audiences,” pointing to “The Bachelorette” season premiere and the Olympic Games’ popularity with Gen Z Americans. And there is the hope and expectation that Biden’s off-the-cuff moments reach audiences on social platforms.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nHere's what voters see as important differences between Biden and Trump\n\nIf there’s one thing that American voters overwhelmingly agree on, it’s that this year’s presidential election presents a stark choice. In the latest CNN poll conducted by SSRS, 91% of registered voters say they see important differences between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, dwarfing even the 77% of voters who said last fall that there were significant divides between the Democratic and Republican parties. Even among the so-called “double haters” – those with unfavorable views of both Biden and Trump – only 20% say that the two candidates are pretty much the same.\n\nTo get a broader image of how voters view the stakes of the election, CNN asked voters to name the single most important difference they saw between the two candidates. As the results highlight, the contrasts that most stick in voters’ minds are often not about policy issues at all. While some voters mentioned the topics that often top voters’ lists this year when asked to pick their most important issues – the economy, immigration or a commitment to democracy – others were more focused on character and personal traits, with honesty, ability to handle the job and perceived motivations among the traits most mentioned as distinguishing factors.\n\nAmong those who saw significant differences between Biden and Trump, the most frequently mentioned distinctions were honesty and integrity (17%), ability to handle the job or mental fitness (15%), love for the country or patriotism (10%), perceived self-serving or egotistical motivations (10%) and effectiveness or performance in office (8%). Another 8% talked about protecting democracy or the Constitution, with 7% mentioning immigration and 6% the economy. Voters’ answers to the questions often spanned multiple topics, and a not insignificant share offered vaguer answers, with some simply noting that each candidate’s beliefs or policies were different.\n\nRead more about what the polling data shows.\n\nBiden will participate in first televised interview today since presidential debate\n\nThe ABC News interview with President Joe Biden will now air “in its entirety as a primetime special” on Friday evening at 8 p.m. ET, the network announced Wednesday evening.\n\nThe high-profile interview will be the first televised interview the president is expected to participate in since his poor showing at last week’s CNN presidential debate.\n\nThe first clip will still air on “World News Tonight” on Friday evening.\n\nBiden will be interviewed by ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on the campaign trail earlier in the day and ABC News says a transcript of the unedited interview will also be made available on Friday.\n\nCNN’s MJ Lee reported Wednesday that the president privately acknowledged the next stretch of days is critical (including the president’s interview with ABC) to whether he can save his reelection bid, making clear to an ally that he understands what would prompt him to accept: “It’s just not working.”\n\nOriginally, ABC said it would air parts of Stephanopoulos’ interview with Biden on Friday at 6:30 p.m. ET on “World News Tonight with David Muir.” The extended interview would have aired Sunday on “This Week with George Stephanopoulos.”\n\nAt last week’s debate, Biden struggled to complete sentences at times and often looked lost as former President Donald Trump pumped out falsehoods, urgently raising questions about Biden’s age and ability to serve a second term.\n\nCNN’s Hadas Gold contributed reporting to this post."
