They chronicle the adventures of two siblings, Amy and Dan Cahill, who discover that their family has been, and still is, the most influential family in history.\n\nThe first story arc concerns Dan and Amy's quest to find the 39 Clues, which are ingredients to a serum that can create the most powerful person on Earth.[1] This series' primary audience is age 9–14. Since the release of the first novel, The Maze of Bones, on September 9, 2008, the books have gained popularity, positive reception, and commercial success.

The Janus branch contains most famous artists and writers, the Ekaterina branch’s skills are science and invention, the Tomas have lots of strength, and the Lucians are master spies, strategists, and leaders. Amy and Dan pursue the Clues while evading the sabotage of other Cahills. Each book chronicles one location which Amy, Dan, and their au pair Nellie Gomez travel to and focuses on one historical character associated with a Clue.[1]\n\nThe Maze of Bones\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: The Maze of Bones\n\nThe Maze of Bones is the first book in the series, written by Rick Riordan and published on September 9, 2008.\n\nAmy and Dan's grandmother, Grace Cahill, changes her will shortly before her death. At her funeral, her lawyer, William McIntyre, gives Dan, Amy, and some of their other relatives, a choice between one million dollars and a chance to participate in the Clue hunt. Amy and Dan enter the Clue hunt, competing against more experienced Clue hunters: the Holt family, Alistair Oh, the Starling Triplets, the Kabras, Jonah Wizard, and Irina Spasky. Dan, Amy, and Alistair Oh find a hidden library in Grace's house. The mansion burns down shortly after, due to the Holts. Fortunately, the Cahills and Alistair make it out on time along with Saladin, Grace's cat. Pursuing the clue hidden in Grace's library leads to the Franklin Institute. There, the Starling Triplets are seriously injured in an explosion, set off by the Holts, who were trying to kill Amy and Dan Cahill. There, Dan and Amy discover Benjamin Franklin had hidden a clue in Paris. After convincing their au pair, Nellie, to chaperone their trip, Amy and Dan travel to Paris, where they follow a trail of cyphers and traps that lead them to the catacombs under the city. There they find the co-ordinates for an old church etched into skulls. At the church, they find a painting of the four Cahill ancestors, Luke, Jane, Katherine, and Thomas. They also find the clue wrapped around a vial of the Lucian serum. Then, Ian Kabra steals the vial. Amy manages to hide the paper with Dan. After a bit of brainstorming, Dan solves the puzzle and discovers the clue: \"iron solute\", an anagram for the word \"resolution\". There is also a secret piece of sheet music.

They go to Mozart's house and sneak down to the library to find the diary of Mozart's sister, Maria Anna \"Nannerl\" Mozart, only to discover that Jonah Wizard had stolen it. However, they steal back the diary from Jonah’s hotel room. The diary leads them to Salzburg, Mozart's birthplace, but their search there ends when an explosion causes a cave-in. Amy and Dan think it was caused by the mysterious man in black, who has been at every major disaster that has happened to them. However, they later find out that the explosion was caused by Alistair Oh. In revenge for this, they put a tracker which had been planted on Saladin into Alistair's cane, while he was sleeping. Dan, Amy, and Nellie then go to Venice, where Dan and Amy sneak into the Janus stronghold and steal a very important lead from the Janus and escape, only to be kidnapped by the Kabras later. The Kabras let them go, finding nothing on them. Luckily, Dan and Amy had hidden the lead in a pillow on a boat shortly before being kidnapped by the Kabras. They retrieve the lead and sneak into a museum. Ian and Natalie Kabra attack them and play Mozart's first harpsichord with the clue, which is a few pages from Nannerl's diary that were cut out. However, the fifth note triggers a booby trap that knocks Ian out. Natalie gets hit with a dart from her dart gun that Dan throws at her.

Rutherford Pierce meets with the Queen of the United Kingdom. However, his wife Debi Ann curtsies when Pierce told her not to, and Pierce later breaks one of the Queen's teacups while experiencing a tremor due to the serum. He tries to turn the mishap to his favor by saying that the teacup was too old and that it was time that the Queen got new china. However, the Queen is not pleased. Pierce reflects on how the Cahills are his last opponent to world domination, and vows to kill them.\n\nIn Guatemala City, Guatemala, the Cahills and Rosenblooms are at the La Aurora International Airport. However, they see paparazzi who are sent by Pierce who publicize their every move. As they escape, they hear rude remarks from the paparazzi and passengers at the airport alike. They escape to their waiting chopper, and make a close escape. They see that Pierce's soldiers are after them, too; their orders are to kill the Cahills but to make it look like an accident. The soldiers' breath smells like green kale mixed with chlorine and ammonia.\n\nAfter the chopper takes off, one of Pierce's men who had taken the serum jumped extremely high.\n\nThe chopper is on its way to Tikal, where the kids have to look for riven crystal in order to complete the antidote to the serum Pierce and his thugs have taken. Dan, Atticus, and Jake are all ignoring Amy because of how she left them behind while embarking on a dangerous mission.\n\nAmy also told Jake, her ex-boyfriend, that she had never loved him. Amy decides that she would rather have her loved ones \"angry and alive than dead\". Amy also hears the clink of the serum that Sammy Mourad had made for her, just in case. As the group discusses the riven crystal and Tikal, a national park and archaeological treasure uncovered in 1956, the chopper suddenly shakes. The pilot, who is wearing a parachute, was bribed by Pierce to jump out and crash the helicopter in an attempt to kill the Cahills.\n\nThe group fights the pilot, and Amy takes the controls. She unsteadily flies it to Tikal, where the chopper falls thirty vertical feet onto a pok-a-tok court. Miraculously, the group survives with few injuries. A ranger picks them up and tells them information about Tikal. At their hotel room, the kids ask Pony to do a search on Debi Ann, who is a Cahill.\n\nLater, Atticus uses Olivia Cahill's book to find out the location of the riven crystal. Meanwhile, in Trilon Laboratories in Delaware, Nellie Gomez, acting as Nadine Gormey, makes contact with Sammy Mourad, who is being held in the building to improve the serum for Pierce.\n\nIn Attleboro, Massachusetts, Pony works on getting information about Debi Ann, though it is difficult.\n\nMeanwhile, in Tikal, as the group is searching for the crystal, Pierce's thugs ambush them, and Dan is critically injured. Amy takes the serum in order to save Dan, but now she only has a week to live. In Delaware, Dr. Brent Bechelheimer is trying to expose Nellie as a fraud, but she uses pictures of his gnoming hobby in order to portray him as unstable.\n\nMeanwhile, Amy is experiencing side effects that will soon kill her. As events progress, Nellie discovers that Jeffrey Callendar is experimenting on Fiske Cahill. In Tikal, Hamilton, Atticus, Ian, and Jonah try to find out if Amy and Dan have recovered Olivia's book, and try to find the riven crystal.\n\nNellie tells Pony to warn Amy and Dan that they are heading into a trap.

X.\" The letter also has the Ekaterina branch symbol, which is a dragon.\n\nThe book begins with Dan Cahill, who was abducted by Cara and Galt Pierce. He thinks about the last twelve hours, in which great horrors took place.\n\nFor example, Pierce was nearly elected president, Pony was killed trying to save Dan, and Amy only has a few more days to live due to the undiluted serum she took to save Dan. Galt and Cara Pierce, the children of J. Rutherford Pierce, begin to interrogate Dan by injecting him with sodium pentothal, or truth serum. They ask him about the antidote to the serum which Dan and the others are trying to create.\n\nCara Pierce decides to leave Galt and Rutherford. Galt states how Pierce decoded Olivia Cahill's Household Book, which tells how to create the antidote. However, Dan retaliates by saying how Pierce \"figured out our secret recipe for potato salad\". By the end of the interrogation, they have confirmed that the last antidote ingredient is in Angkor, Cambodia. Angkor was one of the most developed societies of the ancient world. Dan inhales chloroform in order to pass out.\n\nGalt repeatedly wants to kill Dan, while Cara wants to keep him for further interrogation. Dan soon escapes, with the help of Cara. They plan to fly to Cambodia in order to thwart the Cahills' plans.\n\nDoublecross\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Doublecross (series)\n\nOn April 26, 2014, at the New Hampshire Worlds Collide event, Scholastic announced a fourth series titled Doublecross.[28] The series began with Jude Watson's Mission Titanic (2015),[29][30] followed by C.

In 2010, Scholastic published Agent Handbook, which explores the techniques that the clue hunters in the series use to find clues, and The Black Book of Buried Secrets, which provides more information about events in the series.[39][40] In the last week of December 2011, the Scholastic editorial team released seven short stories as part of The 39 Clues: Rapid Fire e-book series.[41] The editorial team has also released \"The Cahill Files\", which includes Operation Trinity, Spymasters, and four e-books. As part of the multimedia interactive experience to promote the series, Scholastic includes six cards in each book of the 39 Clues series. Each card leads to one online clue, which readers can unlock by entering the code on the cards on their 39 Clues account online.[42]\n\nCards\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 39 Clues uses collectible cards as an important part of the multimedia series besides the books and online game.[43] In the first series of books, The Clue Hunt, each book came with six game cards. These cards all shared the same code and once added online would unlock the clue in that book. Alongside the first series of books, Card Packs were sold. These card packs contained 16 random cards out of a total of roughly 50 that were not available in the books. The card packs were:\n\nCard Pack for books 1, 2 and 3 Card Pack 2: Branch vs. Branch for books 4, 5 and 6 Card Pack 3: Rise of the Madrigals for books 7 and 8 Ultimate Card Pack for books 9 and 10\n\nIn the second series, each book again came with six cards. However, unlike the first series, the cards were needed to unlock the online missions. Cahills vs. Vespers also had two card packs. These card packs all contained the same 16 game cards, which would unlock the online \"extreme\" missions. The card packs were:\n\nThe Marco Polo Heist released with book 1 The Magellan Heist released with book 4\n\nIn the third series Unstoppable, each book contains six game cards. These cards unlock an extra game in their corresponding online missions.\n\nIn the fourth series Doublecross, each book contains six virtual cards.\n\nPlayers on the website can only collect all the clues through the use of the cards, and in later series can only unlock the missions by having the cards. The cards in the first series often had puzzles and riddles to solve.\n\nAdditional cards have been released over the course of the series, and the cards are only virtual. Scholastic developed a game involving the cards, Doublecross, in which players physically use their cards to battle their opponents.\n\nThemes\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 39 Clues series consists of adventure novels; however, the novels also fall within the genre of historical fiction. The stories switch back and forth between different characters' points of view.[44] Each novel focuses on one historical figure and geographical location as Dan and Amy explore a clue related to a prominent Cahill family member in an exotic location.[39]\n\nOne theme of the series is the relationship between talent and success. Each branch of the Cahill family has specific talents in a certain area; for example, the Ekaterina branch specializes in inventions and technology, the Tomas branch in athleticism and strength, the Lucians in strategy and politics, and Janus in art and music. Amy and Dan's competitors' talents give them an advantage, yet Amy and Dan consistently are ahead in the hunt and are viewed as the main threats. Over the course of the books, Amy and Dan discover their own talents.[45]\n\nOrigins\n\n[edit]\n\nAn editorial team in Scholastic came up with the idea of an interactive series with online games and asked Rick Riordan to write the first book.[46] Riordan agreed because he thought it was a good idea, and as a middle school teacher he loved making history enjoyable for younger readers.[47][48] The project was kept secret for about two years.[49]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of June 11, 2010, The 39 Clues series had been on the New York Times bestseller list of Children's Series books for 48 weeks.[50] Books in the series have also appeared on the USA Today, Publishers Weekly, and Wall Street Journal bestseller lists.[39]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nA film based on the series was originally planned, to be released in 2014.[3][51][52] Steven Spielberg acquired film rights to the series in June 2008 and both Spielberg and Scholastic Media president Deborah Forte were to produce it,[53] while Brett Ratner expressed interest in directing the first film in the series, and screenwriter Jeff Nathanson was hired to write the script in September 2008.[54] Later, in May 2012, Shawn Levy, the director of the Night at the Museum movies, acquired the rights to direct the movie.[55] The movie rights were then taken by Universal in August 2013.[56]\n\nHowever, the project appears to have been abandoned, as the latest information on it dates from 2014, and production has still not yet begun.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nChildren's literature portal\n\nInfinity Ring\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
