Filling the shoes of greatness is never an easy task, but at Track, we feel we knocked this one out of the park. The new Heat X-Treme takes mid-performance to a whole new level with unimaginable traction in oil. It’s time to go X-treme!\n\nMODIFIED TRI-CORE\n\nThe Modified Tri-Core is a throw back to the core design found in the original Heat. We’ve matched the RG perfectly to the original while lowering the flare potential slightly to match up better with today’s stronger covers.\n\nQR-5 SOLID COVER\n\nWe designed the QR-5 Solid Cover specifically with this brand new Heat in mind. This cover creates maximum traction in the mid-lane, giving every player the control & predictability they desire. This ball will be great on medium to heavy oil lane conditions.\n\nSpecifications\n\nColor Red / Orange / Black Core Modified Tri-Core Core Type Symmetrical Coverstock QR-5 Solid Finish 500 / 2000 Abralon® Lane Condition Medium To Heavy Oil Weights 16-12 Pounds\n\nCore Numbers\n\nWeight RG DIFF 16 lb 2.510 0.033 15 lb 2.500 0.038 14 lb 2.490 0.045 13 lb 2.530 0.055 12 lb 2.600 0.039\n\nStay Informed"
