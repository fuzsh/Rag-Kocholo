        "text": "So, one of my favorite things to read, in the worlds I love to read about, is alternate reality. One of my favorite, and earliest, alternate realities was the Age of Apocalypse – a Marvel world created by one small, single event: the death of Charles Xavier. Xavier’s dream was so radical – was also such a reflection of the civil rights movements it was born into – that no one else would have espoused it or pulled it off as well as he did. You have to have Xavier – a fact that also breaks my suspension of disbelief in X-Men 3, and which makes me excited for X-Men: Days of Future Past.\n\nOne of my guilty pleasure comics lately has been the dimension-hopping X-Treme X-Men. It’s a plot about a team of inter-dimensional X-Men, led by Charles Xavier’s severed head in a bottle. The goal: kill ten Evil Xavier’s around the multiverse. Because combined, they would have the power to destroy everything. Again: Xavier is key. It has become an interesting truism of the Marvel Universe as a whole.\n\nThese two worlds recently mashed up in a dimension-hopping adventure that spelled the end for both the X-Treme X-Men and the Age of Apocalypse: X-Termination. Was X-Termination worth it? And what will I read now? Not sure I can answer those questions, but let’s take a look at these comics! Spoilers for the recent X-Termination crossover!\n\nX-Termination – A Review\n\nNot to start at the end, but let’s consider this recent small-time crossover comic event. With only six titles, within which ended the run of two whole comics and a number of alternate realities, there was really a need to be incredibly epic. In many ways, this was lived up to, but really, it was more of a nod to what was ending, and a beginning to future plots.\n\nThe plot was that too many dimension-crossing events had happened, and that the walls of reality were breaking down. This was actually begun outside of the comics I’ve mentioned so far, in another run that I read, and which has ended: Uncanny X-Force. Uncanny X-Force brought back the Age of Apocalypse, and spun off the short-lived run of the stand-alone Age of Apocalypse comic.\n\nSo Age of Apocalypse Nightcrawler came back with the Uncanny X-Force, and in trying to return home, he finally made one too many dimension hops. Three Evil Xaviers were working together in X-Treme X-Men, and the giant rift in the multiverse they were working on grew. And out of it pulled super evil ancient villainy guys. They ate energy and were surrounded in acid air and were basically completely invulnerable. Working on being a completely undefeatable enemy, because completely undefeatable enemies scream epic, right? And epic is always good.\n\nThe enemies are so undefeatable that all of our heroes are basically beneath notice, and a lot of time is spent with the villains ignoring them, giving the heroes time to scheme and talk about the epicness.\n\nSo the plan morphs through several attempts at stopping them, one epic plan being to turn Age of Apocalypse Jean Grey into a new Apocalypse to face them. They even promise us an epic last goodbye between Wolverine and Age of Apocalypse Jean Grey, which I don’t remember actually seeing anywhere except the cover of the comic. Some people die, Dark Beast outsmarts people all the time, all the Nightcrawlers end up dead (pissing me off to no end), and the series end. The Age of Apocalypse is sealed with the epic baddies inside, the X-Treme X-Men disband, and life moves on.\n\nOne future major plot is set up: a tiny bit of the Apocalypse Seed is planted inside Iceman. So we’re definitely going to see that come back up. Good thing he’s not one of the most powerful mutants there is, and mostly unkillable already. What could go wrong?\n\nSo what did I think? A little over the top, unfortunately. And everything is so dire that you lose some of the heroicness of the Age of Apocalypse, and the humor of the X-Treme X-Men. Everything was just so bloody epic. One of my favorite alternate storylines is closed off – the Age of Apocalypse is fully done. Although to be fair, the comic had reached that point: the heroes had won, Apocalypse – and his successor, Weapon X – had been defeated, and peace had fallen. Nightcrawler was returning for war, and found peace instead, except for bringing war with him. But really, the series could end, and the world, with a happily ever after. More concerning is the end of X-Treme X-Men, which was just so much fun.\n\nX-Treme X-Men – And what do I read next?\n\nI’m not sure what I can say about this comic. I would like to not spoil you on this comic – instead, I would recommend you read it. At this point, it was only a 12 comic run, so not too much to read. It might end up in a trade paperback at some point, though not yet.\n\nThe series combined a new location every week, with an Evil Xavier of the week, with a fun and changing cast of alternate reality characters. The only character from the main Marvel Universe is Dazzler – who grows as a character and takes the lead in this series. They have a lot of fun with the potential of this plot, and I am sad that they aren’t going to keep doing this – I would have kept reading it for years. Was it not making money? I don’t know. It started from the beginning with the idea that there were only 10 Evil Xaviers – and likely, the plan for X-Termination to happen was there all along.\n\nThis series also stands pretty well on its own. If you know even a little about the X-Men, you’ll enjoy seeing things like alternate versions of Cyclops, Sabertooth, even Dazzler – and of course, Xavier. Instead of regaling you with more words, how about a few shots from the comics? And how about the covers, which show just a little bit of the characters and different situations they end up in.\n\nIt’s like Doctor Who meets the Age of Apocalypse meets, well, Dazzler. How can you top this? Then I read the word today: Peter David’s run on X-Factor is ending later this year. Just as I have been working on getting back into comics, all the comics I am reading seem to be ending! So what do you recommend for me to read?"
