For comprehensive guidelines, please consult the APS Journals Style Guide, Frequently used Memos, and other indicated guidelines, as well as recent issues of the specific journals.\n\nArticle Types\n\nPhysical Review Letters publishes Letters, Essays, Comments, and Replies.\n\nThe scientific content of all sections of the Journal is judged by the same criteria. The sections are distinguished by the different purposes for which the papers are intended. The length limit for a Letter is 3750 words and for a Comment is 750 words, though waivers are considered for cause. For information on how to estimate length, see the Length Guide.\n\nLetters are brief, complete for the general reader, and accessible accounts of important new results. Letters may be accompanied by up to two pages of End Matter. (See information about End Matter and Length Waivers in the section on Length.)\n\nEssays are editor-commissioned articles that concisely present author visions for the future of their field.\n\nComments are one-page articles that establish a central error in a published Letter.\n\nReplies are one-page responses from the authors of the published Letter to a Comment. They can publish only coincident with an accompanying Comment.\n\nErrata notify readers about errors or omissions in previously published papers. See more details about Errata.\n\nJoint Submissions\n\nWhen submitting a Letter to PRL, authors may consider simultaneously submitting a longer version of the Letter to one of the topical Physical Review journals. That longer version should provide a substantially increased understanding of the subject; otherwise, the use of Supplemental Material may be better.\n\nThe submission of an expanded version of a PRL to a topical Physical Review journal is an established practice that provides readers with easier access to important additional information. If authors simultaneously submit a Letter to PRL and a regular paper to one of the Physical Review journals, the two manuscripts are then reviewed coherently, typically by the same referees. If both manuscripts receive favorable reviews, the journals aim to publish them at the same time, unless this leads to undue delay for one of the papers. We also ensure that the paper and the Letter cite each other.\n\nWhen submitting manuscripts for consideration as joint publications, alert the editors by mentioning the companion manuscripts in the cover letter.\n\nContent Guidelines\n\nReadability and Accessibility: Take special care to ensure that manuscripts are well organized, clearly written in scientific English, and written in a style consistent with that of the Physical Review journals. It is not possible for editors to undertake extensive corrections of manuscripts, due to time constraints and the risk that the authors’ meaning might be distorted. If your first language is not English, consider seeking help from a native English speaker when writing your manuscript.\n\nAlternatively, you could use APS Author Services to make your manuscript publication ready.\n\nDirect the manuscript text at a general readership, so as to make it understandable to a broad spectrum of researchers. Physical Review editors recommend avoiding jargon and the excessive use of acronyms, even for commonly used terms. If jargon and acronyms are necessary, please define them in the text. Also, avoid the introduction of new terminology except when needed to convey a unique or nuanced meaning.\n\nTo enhance readability, display all but the simplest equations, rather than including them as inline text. Format figures and tables such that their content and details are readable when they are sized for the journal page. The size of the smallest capital letters and numerals should be at least 2 mm.\n\nPhysical Review editors ask authors to proofread papers prior to submission, to eliminate grammatical errors, misspellings, and omission of symbols.\n\nGeneral Content: Clearly state the relation of the submitted manuscript to previously published work, including papers, meeting abstracts, and conference proceedings. (Preprints and internal laboratory reports are not considered publications.) If the results reported in the manuscript correct, supplement, or supersede previous results, state this advance. Distinguish your results from those previously obtained.\n\nJustification: A mandatory 100-word compelling justification for why your paper meets PRL’s criteria will be required at submission.\n\nLength\n\nThe length limit for Letters (3750 words) works out to about four journal pages for the core of the paper—defined as the text between the abstract and the Acknowledgements.\n\nEnd Matter: Authors can also add up to two pages of appendices or other content—called End Matter—that specialists will want or need to read. End Matter does not count against the core length limit. The idea is to have a concise writeup for a broad readership, while allowing space for essential details.\n\nLength Waivers: Authors may request a waiver for 1/2 page or more for either the core of the paper or the End Matter. In considering a waiver, editors will assess whether there is a clear need for the room and whether the result is of extreme importance or interest. In special cases, editors will consider multiple-page waivers. If you feel you need such a waiver, and can make a convincing case for one, please contact your editor. Please note that decisions on such waivers are not subject to appeal.\n\nLength limits vary among the Physical Review journals. Each journal’s length limits are indicated in the following table.\n\nArticle Length Limits PRL Letter\n\nComment/Reply 3,750 words\n\n750 words PRX Comment/Reply 3,500 words PRX Energy Perspective 3,000 words Review article\n\nTutorial\n\nComment/Reply 7,000 words\n\nNo limit\n\n3,500 words PRX Life Perspective 3,000 words Review article\n\nComment/Reply 7,000 words\n\n3,500 words PRX Quantum Perspective 7,500 words Tutorial\n\nComment/Reply 37,500 words\n\n3,500 words RMP Article\n\nColloquium 50,000 words\n\n20,000 words PRA Letter\n\nComment/Reply 4,500 words\n\n3,500 words PRB Letter\n\nComment/Reply 4,500 words\n\n3,500 words PRC Letter\n\nComment/Reply 4,500 words\n\n1,500 words PRD Letter\n\nComment/Reply 4,500 words\n\n3,500 words PRE Letter\n\nComment/Reply 4,500 words\n\n3,500 words PRResearch Letter\n\nComment/Reply 4,500 words\n\n3,500 words PRAB No limit PRApplied Review Article\n\nComment/Reply\n\nLetter 30,000 words\n\n3,500 words\n\n3,500 words PRFluids Letter\n\nComment/Reply 4,500 words\n\n3,500 words PRMaterials Review Article\n\nResearch Update\n\nLetter\n\nComment/Reply 30,000 words\n\n10,000 words\n\n4,500 words\n\n3,500 words PRPER Review Article\n\nComment/Reply No limit\n\n3,500 words\n\nThe Physical Review journals require authors to abide by the length guidelines. An automatic count of the length of each manuscript is made upon submission. If this count indicates that the manuscript’s length exceeds the journal’s limit, staff will more carefully calculate the length. Authors will be asked to shorten overlength manuscripts prior to review. The length restriction applies to all versions of a manuscript. Upon acceptance for publication, the length of a manuscript may be re-evaluated and cuts may be requested prior to production. More edits may be necessary when the article is composed into journal pages; this process may cause a delay in publication of the article.\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of length limits, please consult the journals’ Length Limit Guide.\n\nManuscript Content\n\nAll articles must meet PRL’s high standards for content and presentation as judged by rigorous review by editors and referees. The goal of PRL is to keep a broad readership of physicists and those in related fields well informed of the essential current research in all relevant areas of fundamental and applied physical science. To this end, there must be compelling reasons—some combination of impact, innovation, and interest—why a result should be published in PRL and not in a more specialized journal.\n\nValidity. Work is valid if it is free of detectable error and is presented in sufficient detail that its validity may be determined. Manuscripts that advance new theoretical views on fundamental principles or theories must contain convincing arguments that the new predictions and interpretations are distinct from existing knowledge and do not contradict experiment.\n\nImpact. Impactful results are those that substantially advance a field, open a significant new area of research, or solve—or take a crucial step toward solving—a critical outstanding problem and thus facilitate notable progress in an existing field. A new experimental or theoretical method may be a suitable basis for a Letter, but only if it has the potential to lead to the significant advances presented above. Mathematical and computational results that do not have significant physical implications are generally not suitable. Manuscripts that describe proposed experiments must provide compelling evidence that the proposal is novel and feasible, and that it will lead to valuable new research.\n\nInterest. Work will rarely qualify for PRL only on the basis of its intrinsic interest, but the broader the appeal of a paper, the more likely it will be found to meet our criteria.\n\nPresentation. The diversity of PRL’s readership places special demands on style. A Letter must begin with an introduction that states the issues it addresses and its primary achievements in language understandable across physics subfields. Each Letter should present a complete discussion within the constraints of a short communication. Letters must be clearly written, devoid of unnecessary jargon, with symbols defined, figures well drawn, and tables and figures thoroughly captioned.\n\nImportance of Introductory Paragraphs. PRL is committed to keeping broadly interested readers well informed about vital current research in all fields of physics and in closely related areas. This goal is achieved with introductory paragraphs that state the issues addressed in the manuscript and the primary achievements. These paragraphs should be clearly written and comprehensible to nonexperts. To assure compliance, the referees are instructed to pay particular attention to the introductory section. In addition, the editors will make an independent evaluation of the adequacy and clarity of the introduction.\n\nTitles\n\nTitles should be concise and informative, clearly stating the main findings of the manuscript. Avoid using new terminology, hyperboles assessing the quality of the work (“precise,” “important,” or “accurate”), proper nouns and brand names (name of equipment, people, or places), and coined words. Titles of manuscripts submitted to the Comments section have the format ‘Comment on “Title of the original paper”.’ Please consult the APS Journals Style Guide for a comprehensive reference to style and format requirements for titles.\n\nAbstracts\n\nAbstracts should concisely summarize the subjects, conclusions, and results of the manuscript. In the abstracts of experimental papers, specify the quantities measured and objects studied and clearly describe the experimental conditions. Avoid coined words and unexplained acronyms. Abstracts should be self-contained and should not include footnotes or citations to references, as abstracts are reprinted in abstracting journals and databases where such information is not useful. Note that Comments and Replies submitted to PRL do not require abstracts.\n\nAbstract Length Limits PRL ≤ 600 characters PRX About 5% of article length & < 500 words PRX Energy About 5% of article length & < 500 words PRX Quantum About 5% of article length & < 500 words RMP < one paragraph PRA About 5% of article length & < 500 words PRB About 5% of article length & < 500 words PRC About 5% of article length & < 500 words PRD About 5% of article length & < 500 words PRE About 5% of article length & < 500 words PRResearch About 5% of article length & < 500 words PRAB About 5% of article length & < 500 words PRApplied About 5% of article length & < 500 words PRFluids About 5% of article length & < 500 words PRMaterials About 5% of article length & < 500 words PRPER About 5% of article length & < 500 words\n\nSupplemental Material\n\nSupplemental Material is information that is useful to a subset of readers but is not essential to comprehend the article’s main results. The Physical Review journals archive Supplemental Material, providing permanent access to the information. Supplemental Material includes, but is not limited to, multimedia files, tables of raw or analyzed data, parameters used in or produced by calculations, and computer codes. Information regarding how the research was conducted, such as details of sample preparation, and derivations of equations, can also be included in the Supplemental Material if this information is not crucial to a reader’s understanding of the associated paper. The paper must stand on its own; it must be understandable and convincing without the Supplemental Material. These file formats are acceptable for Supplemental Material.\n\nSupplemental Material is subject to the same copyright agreement as the associated paper. Follow the guidelines in the copyright agreement for the published manuscript when replicating information included in the Supplemental Material.\n\nDo not use Supplemental Material to avoid a length limit; often, a short paper accompanied by a lengthy supplement is not appropriate. Editors use their judgment to decide if a longer manuscript with all material integrated into the main text is required. The editors may seek guidance in this decision from the referees who review the manuscript and Supplemental Material. In a longer format manuscript, it may be best to present additional material as an appendix to the main article, rather than as Supplemental Material. In general, Supplemental Material should not accompany Comments, Replies, or Errata. List all references cited in the Supplemental Material in the main text.\n\nCite the manuscript’s Supplemental Material in the reference list as follows:\n\nSee Supplemental Material at [URL will be inserted by publisher] for [give brief description of material].\n\nAll files related to a published paper are stored as a single deposit and assigned a Supplemental Material URL. This URL appears in the article’s reference list.\n\nSee Supplemental Material Instructions for more information.\n\nJoint Submissions: As an alternative to Supplemental Material, authors submitting to Physical Review Letters may simultaneously submit a longer accompanying manuscript to one of the topical Physical Review journals. The longer manuscript should provide a substantially increased understanding of the subject while keeping the overlap of figures, tables, and text material to a minimum. Joint papers provide readers with easier access to the complete account of the work. When authors submit simultaneously to Physical Review Letters and to Physical Review, the two manuscripts are reviewed coherently, typically by the same reviewers. If both papers receive favorable reviews, they are published together, unless simultaneous publication leads to undue delay for one of the papers. In Joint Submissions, the paper and the Letter cite each other.\n\nTechnical Format and Style Guidelines\n\nCombine references and footnotes to text material in a single list, and number the items consecutively in the order in which they are cited. Designate references and footnotes in the text with inline numerals in square brackets.\n\nThe full author list of cited papers should be given in the references, except when the number exceeds 10 (for Physical Review Physics Education Research the limit is 3). When citations are made to internal reports, other items not available in the published literature, or unpublished work, it is the responsibility of the author to provide sufficient information to enable the reader to obtain a copy of the cited material. Citations to papers published in peer-reviewed journals are considered primary references. Citations to e-print archives should not be used in place of primary references. Citations to classified reports or other documents with restricted circulation should be avoided. All citations, including those cited in figure and table captions, should be listed in the reference section.\n\nIt is important to confirm the accuracy of the bibliographic information in the references. Links will be added to the cited document. If reference citations are incorrect or incomplete (e.g., missing author name, or an incorrect volume number or page), the associated links may fail.\n\nPhysical Review encourages authors to include titles for all references as an aid to the reader. If this format is used, it must be applied to all references. Please note that Physical Review X, PRX Energy, PRX Life, PRX Quantum, Physical Review Research, Physical Review Applied, and Physical Review Fluids require all references to include titles.\n\nBylines: The names of authors and their professional affiliations must be given in the byline at the beginning of a manuscript. If the number of authors exceeds 40, the authors will be listed in the Table of Contents as, e.g., A. Jones et al. The author who submits the manuscript is responsible for ensuring that all listed authors approve the inclusion of their names, and for checking that each name is written in the format normally used by that author.\n\nFormatting Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Author Names: Authors with Chinese, Japanese, or Korean names can display their names in their own language alongside the English versions of their names (see Editorial: Which Wei Wang?). If this option is chosen, please include a note in the cover letter and check the appropriate box on the Submissions server when submitting or resubmitting the manuscript. Please check the PDF produced by the Submissions server to ensure the names appear correctly. Also, carefully check any production proofs you receive prior to the publication of your paper.\n\nThe following font styles are used by the Physical Review journals to typeset Chinese, Japanese, or Korean characters: SongMT (Simplified Chinese); SungMT (Traditional Chinese); MS Mincho (Japanese); Batang (Korean). To add Chinese, Japanese, and Korean author names to Microsoft Word files, add the characters in parentheses after each author’s name. Please use standard Microsoft fonts for the characters. For manuscripts prepared using TeX, use REVTeX 4 and the CJK language package for LaTeX. The Physical Review journals support the following CJK package encodings: GB, Big5, GBK, and UTF 8 (Chinese); JIS, SJIS (Shift-JIS), and UTF8 (Japanese); KS and UTF8 (Korean). Note, if using UTF-8, the \\CJKfamily macro may be needed when processing the file on a local machine. The macros are: \\CJKfamily{gbsn} (Simplified Chinese); \\CJKfamily{bsmi} (Traditional Chinese); \\CJKfamily{min} (Japanese); \\CJKfamily{mj} (Korean). If needed, it is possible to call \\CJKfamily more than once, for example, to properly typeset both a Japanese and a Korean name. Before submitting the manuscript, comment out all \\CJKfamily macro calls. The CJK markup is as follows:\n\nPut \\usepackage{CJK} after the \\documentclass line \\begin{CJK*}{}{} after the \\begin{document} line \\end{CJK*} after the \\maketitle line.\n\nFor example:\n\n\\documentclass[aps,prl,preprint]{revtex4} \\usepackage{CJK} .... \\begin{document} \\begin{CJK*}{GB}{} % Use default fonts from CJK (see below) \\title{Title of Paper} \\author{Your Name (characters)} \\affiliation{Your affiliation} ... \\maketitle \\end{CJK*}\n\nFormatting A Collaboration Author List: Collaborations of 50 or more authors are encouraged to use the SPIRES Collaboration Author Lists XML Format to submit author names. Please provide the ‘authors.xml file’ when submitting the manuscript.\n\nCollaborations may also use a TeX format for author names. In that case, use REVTeX 4 (or 4.2) for the text file, not Word or plain LaTeX, and name the files with a ‘.tex’ extension. To automatically link author names with affiliations, use the REVTeX 4 “superscriptaddress” document style as described in the REVTeX 4 sample template file. Please include the author list in the main text file of the submission (the one with the \\begin{document} command). List each author on a different line and use the “\\author” command. Only use standard LaTeX and REVTeX 4 commands in the author list. Completely remove collaboration members from the author list that are not to be listed as authors on the manuscript. The following example gives a portion of an acceptably coded TeX-format author list for a collaboration:\n\n\\author{N.~Arnaud}\n\n\\author{J.~B'equilleux}\n\n\\author{A.~D’Orazio}\n\n\\affiliation{University of California at Irvine, Irvine, California 92697, USA}\n\n\\author{M.~Davier}\n\n\\author{J.~Firmino da Costa}\n\n\\author{G.~Grosdidier}\n\n\\author{A.~H\"ocker}\n\n\\affiliation{Brunel University, Uxbridge, Middlesex UB8 3PH, United Kingdom}\n\n\\collaboration{The Sample Collaboration}\n\n\\noaffiliation\n\nAffiliations of authors should be given without abbreviation. (Use Massachusetts Institute of Technology, not MIT.) Give the city, state, and zip code for U.S. addresses; add the country for other addresses. Affiliations must be institutions, not conferences, collaborations, or temporary meeting places.\n\nIf the authors are at different institutions, author names may be grouped by institution with the name of the institution following each group. If the authors are not grouped by institution, the names of institutions may be presented in a single list following the list of authors. A variant form for listing institutions links each author to their institution(s) unambiguously via a superscript numeral: Each institution is given a number, and the relevant number is then placed after each author’s name. Group (collaboration) names can be listed in addition to author names. The group name goes in parentheses after the list of authors and before the list of institutions. Please choose the most concise presentation.\n\nFootnotes to an author’s name or address facilitate locating or communicating with an author. Footnotes giving email addresses of one or more contact authors are encouraged (Contact author: author@email). Along with email addresses, authors are also encouraged to add their preferred pronouns (he/him/his, she/her/hers and they/them/theirs). Include information concerning research support in the acknowledgments. Footnotes describing an author’s position or title are not acceptable.\n\nPlace information concerning author contributions, such as statements of equal contributions, in a paragraph after the Acknowledgment section. For example, “A.B. and C.D. contributed equally to this work.” or “A.Z. and B.Y. conceptualized the work; C.X. conducted the experiments.”\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nAcknowledgments are a simple statement of thanks that appears at the end of a manuscript. They can recognize named individuals who contributed scientifically to the research of the paper; cite the funding agencies that provided financial support for the work; and note the affiliation of institutions in the byline. Acknowledgments to people precede those of financial support.\n\nAcknowledgments may not recognize those who helped in preparing the paper; editors who handled the peer review of the paper; those who contributed general encouragement (family, friends); or those who provided services that were not directly part of the research. Acknowledgements may not include a dedication or a memorial.\n\nAcknowledge positions, titles, and awards only if they provided funding for the research and state the source of financial funding in such cases. Noting the date associated with an award is not appropriate.\n\nNotations and Mathematical Material\n\nKeep notation clear, compact, and consistent with standard usage.\n\nNeatly format, punctuate, and align equations to bring out their structure. Number equations on the right. Punctuate mathematical expressions and displayed equations as part of the sentence. Use single-letter symbols for mathematical quantities in equations and expressions, with subscript or superscript indices or labels, if necessary. Replace a frequently repeated mathematical equation with a symbol. Use bracketing as necessary to ensure clarity. Note that the solidus (/) in fractions, for example 1/2a, means 1/(2a) and not (1/2)a. Do not use a center dot to indicate multiplication except for products of vectors, dyadics, and the like.\n\nIn general, three-vectors are set in roman boldface. Four or more vectors are usually set in lightface italic, but boldface is acceptable. Ordinary type is preferable when using Greek letters. Typographically distinguish matrices, operators, and other general quantities only to avoid confusion; in such cases use boldface or a caret.\n\nThe APS Journals Style Guide includes further details on notations and mathematical expressions, along with exceptions to these conventions.\n\nSymbols and Units\n\nPhysical Review style favors the use of metric SI units, as recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Some include:\n\nCommon Abbreviations and Misuses Use Do Not Use µm µ nm mµ fm F (F is for farad) g gm A amp K °K sr Sr, ster, str u amu cm3 cc deg DEG, DEG., deg. keV KEV, KeV MeV Mev, MEV MeV/nucleon MeV/u, MeV/amu, MeV/A µN n.m. c.m. (=center of mass) CM arb. units a.u. (for atomic units)\n\nPhysical Review follows the recommendations of the S.U.N. Commission of IUPAP on the symbols to be used for nuclides and their states.\n\nPreferred Notations Notation Example Style Notes nucleon number (mass number) 14N left superscript state of ionization Ca2+ right superscript excited state 110Agm, 14N* right superscript number of atoms in a molecule 14N2 right subscript bombarding particles n, p, d, t, h, and 𝛼 𝜏 not acceptable other beam particles 6Li, 12C, ... only the usual symbols target nuclides 1H, 2H, 3H, 3He, 4He ... not D, T, … differential cross section σ(ϑ), σ(E,ϑ) i.e., angle or energy shown as argument derivative d2σ/dΩ dE d2σ by itself or dσ/dΩdE not acceptable mathematical relationship dM/dA, ds/dZ e.g., semiempirical mass formula; not acceptable for data characterization since A and Z are not continuous\n\nExceptions to these conventions and further details on Notations and Mathematical Equations are found in the APS Journals Style Guide.\n\nTables and Figures\n\nTables are numbered (with roman numerals) in the order in which they appear in text. Give each table a caption that explains the contents of the table and that includes definition of symbols. Keep column headings simple and include units in these headings. Very simple and brief tabular material may appear in the text without a number or caption.\n\nUse a single horizontal rule to separate the column headings from the entries in the table. Use horizontal space within the body of the table to separate broad groups of entries. Extra vertical space may be used between columns. Avoid vertical rules in tables. Use lower-case roman letters for footnotes placed at the bottom of a table.\n\nIf space allows, long data tables can be included directly in the manuscript, rather than in the Supplemental Material. This decision is influenced by whether readers can accurately obtain the data from a figure and by how many readers are likely to use the numbers. If experimental results are likely to be used as reference values by other authors, publication of the numbers is desirable. Extensive datasets may be deposited as Supplemental Material. If additional numerical data are available, include a statement regarding the availability of the data at the end of the manuscript, before the Acknowledgments. The statement should cite a reference that provides the information needed to access the data (e.g., name of repository, doi, etc.). See the APS Journals Style Guide for complete information regarding the proper form for data citations.\n\nFigures should have a width of a 8.6 cm or 3 3/8 in, the width of a single manuscript column. Use a width of 1.5 or 2 columns for more detailed figures. Authors are required to submit all figures electronically for production. Preferred formats are .ps, .eps, .pdf, .jpg, and .png; refer to the manuscript Submission Guidelines below for more details. Number figures in the order in which they are referred to in the text.\n\nGive each figure a caption that clearly summarizes the contents of the figure. Define figure symbols and curves either in a legend in the figure itself or in the caption. Label subfigures (a), (b), etc., and include a description of each panel given in the caption. If possible, submit figures with multiple panels as one file.\n\nFormat figures such that their content and details are readable when they are sized for the journal page. Make the height of the smallest capital letters and numerals at least 2 mm and make the diameter of each data point at least 1 mm. Make a curve’s linewidth at least 0.18 mm (0.5 point). Avoid small open symbols, shading, and cross-hatching in figures.\n\nLabel figure axes with the quantities plotted and place units in parentheses after the quantity. Keep the style of figures and text consistent. See the APS Journals Style Guide and Axis Labels and Scales on Graphs for more information on how to style figure axes.\n\nSubmit photographic images (either grayscale or color) as high-resolution .jpg or .png files. Avoid submitting prescreened (scanned) images of photographic material as they may not have sufficient resolution. If scanned images have to be used, make scans with as high a resolution as possible (preferably 600 dpi or higher) and then scale the figure to its final size.\n\nFigures should accurately present the scientific results. If adjustments to images, such as changing its brightness, are made, state the adjustment in the figure caption.\n\nFor color-online-only figures, a .ps or .eps file is required for production. Ensure color online figures are intelligible in grey scale. To achieve this goal, use colors that have clearly distinguished grey-scale values. To assist in differentiating colored curves, use different line styles (dashed, solid, etc.) and give a description of the lines in the caption. See Guide to Acceptable use of Color in Color Online Figures for more information.\n\nIf colored figures are desired in the print version of the journal, as in the online version, clearly indicate which figures are intended to be printed in color when the manuscript is submitted. Information about our pricing and payment policy for printed color figures is available via Color Figures in the Print Journal.\n\nIn order to reproduce previously published figures, tables, etc., authors must show that they have complied with the requirements of the publisher of that material. Authors can demonstrate they have permission to reproduce the material by sending a written agreement from the publisher and author of the originally published work. If the original journal is published by APS, only a written agreement from the original author is required.\n\nThe APS Journals Style Guide includes further details on formatting figures and tables.\n\nManuscript Submission and Resubmission\n\nSubmission\n\nSubmit manuscripts via our Submissions server. The Submissions server is designed to enable fast and easy uploading of the manuscript and to enable entering of information required for the peer-review process. Receipt of a submission during business hours is acknowledged by email within one business day.\n\nSpecify the Corresponding Author (the individual who represents all listed authors during the peer-review process), and give all available contact information for this individual (postal and email addresses, phone number). Specify the journal and section to which the paper is submitted, and select 2-4 PhySH (Physics Subject Headings) concepts if possible. More information about the PhySH physics classification scheme is available in PhySH Guidelines for Authors, and the full scheme is available at PhySH-Physics Subject Headings.\n\nIf an important subject of the manuscript is not classifiable by a PhySH concept, please give an appropriate keyword or phrase, and indicate approximately where in the scheme this topic would be best placed. Feedback on the PhySH scheme is welcomed.\n\nSubmissions formatted in REVTeX or MS WORD are preferred. Upload the main body of the manuscript (including figures, tables, captions, etc.) to the Submissions server as a single file. Also send a cover letter, auxiliary files and figures, and Supplemental Material via the Submissions server. Copies of the manuscript sent by regular mail are not processed.\n\nAuthors of accepted manuscripts will be directed, via email, to an online, interactive service to complete the needed “publication rights” agreement, such as the APS Transfer of Copyright agreement. Prompt completion of this process prevents unnecessary delays. Accepted manuscripts are not forwarded to the production group until the journal is in receipt of the agreement.\n\nFor further assistance with your manuscript, visit APS Author Services.\n\nThe Editorial Policies and Practices include further details on submission policies.\n\nResubmission\n\nWhen resubmitting a manuscript, please include a summary of changes made and a concise, point-by-point response to all recommendations and criticisms. The modified manuscript and figures can be uploaded using the interactive resubmission forms available on our Submissions server. These forms should also be used when a manuscript previously submitted to one Physical Review journal is transferred to another. Send the complete text file if there have been any changes.\n\nFor any resubmission, please state whether or not the figures have been modified, and supply new electronic figures if there have been changes. It is only necessary to resend figure files when the previous versions are no longer valid. Please update any other information (e.g., address and contact information) that has changed since the initial submission.\n\nThe Editorial Policies and Practices include further details on resubmission policies.\n\nAuthor Inquiries\n\nInformation regarding the status of a manuscript under consideration by the Physical Review journals is available on the following webpage. If clarification is needed, send an email message to the journal with the following subject line: Status, Manuscript ID, Corresponding Author Name.\n\nFor accepted papers, information about the production status is available via a similar service maintained by the production vendor. A link to this service is provided on the manuscript status page.\n\nReview Process\n\nThe following information provides details regarding the review process for manuscripts submitted to the Physical Review journals. For more information on our standard peer-review practices, please consult the Editorial Policies and Practices.\n\nPeer Review: Peer review by independent, anonymous referees is one of the most important reasons for the existence of a scientific journal. Journal readers benefit since at least one independent expert has judged that the manuscript is new and interesting, that it contributes to the advancement of the field, and that it is without apparent flaws. Of course, it is impossible for either the journal or the referees to guarantee the correctness or the originality of the research. Authors benefit from peer review via feedback on the research and the style of presentation. Note that the review policies and procedures vary by journal.\n\nReview Timeline: The time from receipt to publication of a manuscript depends on many factors, including the article type (Letter or Regular Article, for example), the availability of referees, and the editor’s workload. The time authors take to respond to referee comments and revise the manuscript also plays a role in the review timeline.\n\nReferee Selection: Editors choose one or more referees from a common database of thousands of potential referees. The editors base their referee choices on factors including the referee’s area of expertise and their availability (we try to avoid overburdening referees), the quality of the referee’s reports, and the referee’s typical response time.\n\nSuggesting Referees: Authors are encouraged to suggest the names of potential referees. Referee suggestions can be added during the manuscript submission process on the Editorial Info page. Click on the “Add” button and enter the name, email, and affiliation for each suggested referee. The editors consider the suggestions, but the suggested referees are not necessarily chosen. Authors should avoid listing previous coauthors and collaborators.\n\nExcluding Referees: Authors can request that certain referees are not contacted. The names of these referees can be added during the manuscript submission process on the Editorial Info page. In the text box, provide the names of a few specific people (not names of research groups, collaborations, or institutions) and include a brief explanation of why you are making the request. Although such requests are usually honored it is customary to give authors whose work is criticized in a manuscript an opportunity to respond to the criticism.\n\nNumber of Referees: The number of referees contacted to review a manuscript varies by journal. Typically, editors choose one or two referees to initially review a manuscript. In some cases, the editors may contact more than two referees, for example to gain input from referees with differing expertise or if there is uncertainty about the availability of a particular expert. If a referee is tardy, the editors may contact an additional referee, and if the tardy referee then responds, we may receive more anonymous reports than usual. If an impasse is reached between the authors and referees, the editors may consult another referee in an effort to close the review process.\n\nRejection without Review: Not all manuscripts are sent for review. Editors often reject manuscripts that they judge to be clearly unsuitable for the journal. However, no manuscript is accepted for publication without review by external referees.\n\nRounds of Review: Editors typically reach a final decision on whether to publish a manuscript after one or two rounds of review.\n\nResponding to Referee Reports: Authors should read referee reports carefully and dispassionately and approach the reports with an open mind. What may at first seem like a devastating blow is perhaps a request for more information or for a more detailed explanation. At other times the referee may indeed have found a fatal flaw in the research or logic. Put yourself in the position of a reader, which is exactly the position of the referee. Is the manuscript well written? Is the presentation clear, unambiguous, and logical? Respond to all referee comments, suggestions, and criticisms. When writing your response, please formulate it in gender-neutral terms. If unavoidable, please use the singular “they/them/theirs” in place of gender-specific pronouns. Explain which changes have been made and state your position on points of disagreement.\n\nComments are generally processed according to the following procedure.\n\nThe Comment is sent to the authors of the criticized work for their reaction. The authors of the object Letter are not asked to review the Comment as anonymous referees. Rather, they are asked to provide a written opinion on the Comment that is suitable for transmission to the Comment’s authors. Authors of the object paper may recommend that the manuscript be accepted, be accepted after revision, or be rejected. They may also submit a Reply for simultaneous consideration with the Comment.\n\nAfter suitable exchanges between the involved parties, the Comment (and Reply, if any) and relevant correspondence are sent to at least one uninvolved expert for anonymous review. If the referee recommends acceptance, and the authors of the object paper have not already submitted a Reply, these authors are given the opportunity to submit a Reply to the Comment. The Reply will also be reviewed, usually by the same uninvolved expert, but is not guaranteed acceptance for publication. If the Comment meets our criteria, it will be published whether or not a Reply is published.\n\nWhen both the Comment and Reply are accepted for publication, the authors of the Comment are sent a copy of the Reply for their information, but they should not alter the Comment unless requested to do so by the editors. The Comment and Reply are published in the same issue of the journal, with the Reply immediately following the Comment.\n\nTo be publishable, Comments and Replies must be of interest to our readers and free of detectable errors. If a Comment meets our criteria it will be published whether a Reply is published or not. The editors will not excessively delay the publication of a suitable Comment because of the lack of an adequate Reply. If a Letter generates several similar Comments, the editors may decide to publish only a subset of the Comments received.\n\nPost Acceptance\n\nPublicity\n\nIf your paper is accepted for publication in a Physical Review journal, please consider submitting a summary of the paper. The summary should include a newspaper-style headline and one paragraph explaining the main result of the paper and why it’s important. Write the summary so that it’s understandable by non-scientists. Send the plain text summary (no LaTeX or Word documents) to author-summaries@aps.org with the subject line “summary [accession code]”. When emailing the summary, consider sending one or a few low-resolution image files that illustrate the results. Preferred formats are jpeg/jpg, gif, and png. After a summary is submitted, an automatic email acknowledgment will be sent from author-summaries+noreply@aps.org.\n\nThe summaries are used by the following venues to inform decisions on what papers to cover:\n\nPhysics: Daily news stories and commentary about a selection of papers from the Physical Review journals.\n\nMedia Tip Sheet: Weekly email message distributed to journalists to promote press-worthy papers from the Physical Review journals. The tip sheet has led to news articles in publications including Science, Nature, and the New York Times.\n\nPhysics Buzz Blog: Blog covering a wide range of physics topics of interest to the general public.\n\nIn addition, the Physical Review editors occasionally consider summaries when making decisions on what papers to highlight as Editors’ Suggestions. These papers are judged to be particularly important, interesting, or well written, and are prominently displayed on the journal web pages.\n\nHints for Writing a Good Summary: Be brief. 200 words is usually enough. Shorter summaries are often better as they include fewer details that tend to distract from the main points. Try to get to the “bottom line” in the first sentence or two before stepping back to go over background information. Think of the way a newspaper article is written, with the most important points at the top. Aim the summary at non-scientists and not physicists. Using this style helps those reading the summary to visualize how the topic could be presented to a non-scientific audience. Avoid or define any jargon. State why the result is important in direct terms, even if it seems obvious. Clearly distinguish between what is new in the paper and what is merely background information.\n\nFor more assistance, visit APS Author Services.\n\nOther Publicity: The journal editors encourage authors to notify their institution’s public information or press office if the paper is accepted. The press office may want to mention the paper in their own publications or may want to inform local media. The email addresses of institutional press offices are searchable at Newswise.\n\nPublication Charges and Reprints\n\nThe Physical Review journals provide authors with an online, web-based interface, SciPris™ , to pay for various author charges, including applicable publication charges, charges for color figures, and reprints. Upon acceptance, authors will receive a unique link to the SciPris™ platform.\n\nPublication Charges: To help defray editorial and production expenses, authors of published Letters may contribute an Optional Page Charge of \\$830 (\\$310 for a Comment or Reply). Authors are not required to pay this charge to publish in Physical Review Letters (PRL) under the traditional subscription model. Charges for color figures and reprints are separate from the Optional Page Charge.\n\nColor Figures Charges: Color illustrations in the print journal should be used only when there is a clear need. The additional costs for printing illustrations are borne in full by authors and their institutions. Authors are reminded that Color Figures Online Only is a service provided in Physical Review journals without charge to authors.\n\nAuthors desiring color in print, who are willing and able to pay the associated charges, should indicate their request, preferably upon submission, and indicate which figures are intended for color in print. Full payment of the color charges is required before the article is sent to production. If payment is not received within 21 working days, the article is sent to production with the figures designated as color online only, provided those figures have been properly prepared as individual electronic files (color online only results in no charges to the author). If authors require more time to pay the charges, the article will be held until the anticipated payment date.\n\nThe charge is US \\$1060 for a single color figure in print and \\$575 for each additional color figure. Any questions or concerns regarding color in print may be directed to payments@aps.org.\n\nReprints: Authors can use SciPris™ to order reprints and obtain associated prices. For authors’ convenience and to minimize delay, the SciPris™ platform accepts payment by major credit card. For those who require invoices to make payment, the system offers this option as well. Please note that reprints are created and mailed after the journal issue has been printed.\n\nOpen Access Publishing Options\n\nThe Physical Review family offers some of the most-trusted, most-read, most-cited, and fastest-growing fully open access and hybrid journals in physics and related areas of research. Both fully open access journals and hybrid journals allow authors to publish their research immediately open access, usually upon payment of an article publication charge (APC).\n\nIn the fully gold open access journals – including Physical Review X, PRX Energy, PRX Life, PRX Quantum, PRResearch, and PRPER – all accepted articles are published open access under a CC-BY 4.0 International license, upon the payment of an APC.\n\nThe hybrid journals – including PRL, PRA, PRB, PRC, PRD, PRE, PRApplied, PRFluids, and PRMaterials – allow authors to publish at no cost under the traditional subscription model, and also provide authors the option to publish an accepted article open access under a CC-BY 4.0 International license, upon the payment of an APC.\n\nCC-BY 4.0 International is one of the most permissive Creative Commons Attribution licenses available and permits anyone to copy, distribute, transmit, and adapt work with proper attribution. Authors retain copyright to their articles under this license. Authors seeking to publish articles under the Creative Commons Attribution license should select this option when they are asked to complete the appropriate Publication Rights documentation. Accepted licensed articles will not be published until any applicable APC is paid in full.\n\nAPC pricing information for the current year, including promotional discounts, is listed here.\n\nAPCs waivers for open access publication are available for submitting authors from many lower and middle income countries. Further information is available on our support page.\n\nAuthors may also be eligible to publish open access free of charge if they are covered by one of these Institutional Open Access and Transformative agreements."
