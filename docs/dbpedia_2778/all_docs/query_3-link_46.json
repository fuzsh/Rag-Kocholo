        "text": "What Physician Assistants Do About this section\n\nPhysician assistants, also known as PAs, examine, diagnose, and treat patients under the supervision of a physician.\n\nDuties\n\nPhysician assistants typically do the following:\n\nObtain and review patients’ medical histories\n\nExamine patients\n\nOrder and interpret diagnostic tests, such as x rays or blood tests\n\nDiagnose a patient’s injury or illness\n\nProvide treatment, such as setting broken bones, stitching wounds, and immunizing patients\n\nEducate and counsel patients and their families on a variety of issues, such as treatment and self-care for asthma\n\nPrescribe medication\n\nAssess and record a patient’s progress\n\nResearch the latest treatments to ensure quality of patient care\n\nPhysician assistants are on teams with physicians or surgeons and other healthcare workers. The amount of collaboration and the extent to which they must be supervised by physicians or surgeons differ by state.\n\nPhysician assistants work in a variety of healthcare specialties, including primary care and family medicine, emergency medicine, and psychiatry. The work of physician assistants depends, in large part, on their specialty or the type of medical practice in which they work. For example, a physician assistant working in surgery may close incisions and provide care before, during, and after an operation. A physician assistant working in pediatrics may examine a child and give routine vaccinations.\n\nIn some areas, especially rural and medically underserved communities, physician assistants may be the primary care providers at clinics where a physician is present only 1 or 2 days per week. In these locations, physician assistants collaborate with the physician as needed and as required by law.\n\nSome physician assistants make house calls or visit nursing homes to treat patients.\n\nPhysician assistants differ from nurse practitioners in their training and the level of care they provide; for example, nurse practitioners cannot provide surgical care, whereas physician assistants can. They also differ from medical assistants, who do routine clinical and clerical tasks but do not practice medicine.\n\nHow to Become a Physician Assistant About this section\n\nPhysician assistants typically need a master’s degree from an accredited educational program. Applicants to these programs typically have a bachelor's degree and experience caring directly for patients. All states require physician assistants to be licensed.\n\nEducation\n\nApplicants to physician assistant education programs typically have a bachelor’s degree and some experience with patient care. Although programs vary, most require applicants to have taken undergraduate coursework with a focus in science. Bachelor's degrees are often in healthcare or a related field, such as biology. Programs also may require that applicants have experience as a medical assistant, EMT or paramedic, or another occupation that involves patient care.\n\nPhysician assistant education programs usually take at least 2 years of postbaccalaureate study. A list of accredited physician assistant programs is available from the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant, Inc. (ARC-PA).\n\nPhysician assistant education includes classroom and laboratory instruction in subjects such as human anatomy, clinical medicine, and pharmacology. The programs also include supervised clinical training in several specialties, such as family medicine, internal medicine, and emergency medicine.\n\nLicenses, Certifications, and Registrations\n\nAll states and the District of Columbia require physician assistants to be licensed. To become licensed, candidates must pass the Physician Assistant National Certifying Examination (PANCE) administered by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants (NCCPA). A physician assistant who passes the exam may use the credential “Physician Assistant-Certified (PA-C).”\n\nTo maintain their PA-C certification, physician assistants must complete continuing education and pass a recertification exam within a specified number of years.\n\nIn most states, laws require physician assistants to hold an agreement with a supervising physician. Although the physician does not need to be onsite at all times, collaboration between physicians and physician assistants is required for practice.\n\nPhysician assistant positions may require basic life support (BLS) certification.\n\nAdvancement\n\nSome physician assistants pursue additional education in a specialty. Postgraduate programs are available in specialties such as emergency medicine and psychiatry. To enter one of these programs, a physician assistant must be a graduate of an accredited program and have their PA-C. Additional certification in specialty areas is offered by the NCCPA.\n\nImportant Qualities\n\nCommunication skills. Physician assistants must explain complex medical issues in a way that patients can understand.\n\nCompassion. Physician assistants deal with patients who are sick or injured and who may be in extreme pain or distress. They must be sympathetic toward and understanding of patients and their families.\n\nDetail oriented. Physician assistants should be observant and have a strong ability to focus when evaluating and treating patients.\n\nEmotional stability. Physician assistants, particularly those working in surgery or emergency medicine, should work well under pressure. They must remain calm in stressful situations in order to provide quality care.\n\nInterpersonal skills. Physician assistants must work well as part of a team of other healthcare professionals to ensure proper patient care.\n\nProblem-solving skills. Physician assistants need to evaluate patients’ symptoms and administer the appropriate treatments. They must be diligent when investigating complicated medical issues so they can determine the best course of treatment for each patient.\n\nJob Outlook About this section\n\nPhysician Assistants\n\nPercent change in employment, projected 2022-32\n\nPhysician assistants\n\n27%\n\nHealthcare diagnosing or treating practitioners\n\n9%\n\nTotal, all occupations\n\n3%\n\nEmployment of physician assistants is projected to grow 27 percent from 2022 to 2032, much faster than the average for all occupations.\n\nAbout 12,200 openings for physician assistants are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as to retire.\n\nEmployment\n\nThe growing population will continue to increase demand for healthcare services. A rise in the number of older people, who are more likely than young people to require medical care, and of patients with chronic diseases, such as diabetes, will also increase healthcare demand. These increases, in turn, drive the need for healthcare providers such as physician assistants (PAs), who often provide preventive care and treat the sick.\n\nPAs, who can provide many of the same services as physicians, are expected to continue to expand their role in providing healthcare services for a number of reasons. They can be trained more quickly than physicians, and team-based healthcare provision models will continue to evolve and become more common. Furthermore, states continue to expand allowable procedures and autonomy, and insurance companies are extending coverage to physician assistant services.\n\nEmployment projections data for physician assistants, 2022-32 Occupational Title SOC Code Employment, 2022 Projected Employment, 2032 Change, 2022-32 Employment by Industry Percent Numeric\n\nPhysician assistants\n\n29-1071 148,000 187,300 27 39,300 Get data\n\nState & Area Data About this section\n\nOccupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS)\n\nThe Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) program produces employment and wage estimates annually for over 800 occupations. These estimates are available for the nation as a whole, for individual states, and for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. The link(s) below go to OEWS data maps for employment and wages by state and area.\n\nPhysician assistants\n\nProjections Central\n\nOccupational employment projections are developed for all states by Labor Market Information (LMI) or individual state Employment Projections offices.
