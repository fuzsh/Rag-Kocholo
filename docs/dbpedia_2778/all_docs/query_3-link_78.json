        "text": "Early Years[]\n\nOroro Munroe, also known as Storm, is the descendant of an ancient line of African priestesses, all of whom have white hair, blue eyes, and the potential to wield magic. Born Ororo Munroe, her mother, N'Daré, was the princess of a tribe in Kenya, who married the American photojournalist, David Munroe, and moved with him to Manhattan, where Ororo was born.[33]\n\nWhen Ororo was six months old, she and her parents moved to Cairo, Egypt and, at the age of five, a plane crash destroyed their home.[33] Ororo's parents were killed, but she survived, buried under rubble near her mother's body. This traumatizing effect left Ororo with the severe claustrophobia that still afflicts her today. Ororo managed to escape the rubble of her shattered home with nothing but the tattered clothes on her back and her mother's ancestral ruby.[33][46][47] Homeless and orphaned, Ororo was found by a gang of street urchins who took her to their master, Achmed El Gibár. Achmed trained Ororo in the arts of thievery and she soon became his prize pupil, excelling in picking both pockets and locks. During her time in Cairo, Ororo picked the pocket of an American tourist. The man proved no easy mark, however, as he was Charles Xavier, a powerful mutant telepath who used his abilities to stop the theft.[48][49] At that moment, Xavier was psionically attacked by another mutant, Amahl Farouk (absolute ruler of Cairo’s thieves), and Ororo used the opportunity to escape. Xavier, who acknowledged she was a mutant from her brainwaves, declined to contact Ororo at this point, not wanting to shock the young woman with the true nature of her powers.\n\nItching to prove her skills as a thief, Ororo once stole a rare ruby-colored gem, the so-called “Heart of Eternal Darkness.” She did so against Achmed El Gibár’s direct orders. Only later, it would be discovered that the stone contained the essence of the immortal mutant Candra.[50] Years later, when she was about twelve, Ororo felt a strong urge to wander south and left Cairo.[51][52][53] During her travels, Ororo naively accepted a ride from a complete stranger and was almost raped by him. Forced to defend herself, Ororo killed the man, and, from that moment, she swore never to take another human life.[54]\n\nOroro wandered for thousands of miles, almost dying during her trek across the Sahara Desert. Ororo's mutant ability to psionically control the weather emerged soon after, and she was able to use them to rescue T'Challa, a prince of the African nation of Wakanda, from his would-be kidnappers and killers after he had previously rescued her from the same men. The pair shared a romance and spent much time together, however, T'Challa's duties as a prince prevented them from further exploring their burgeoning mutual attraction.[55][56]\n\nFinally, Ororo reached her ancestors' homeland of the Kilimanjaro Valley on the Serengeti Plain in Kenya. Ororo was taken in by an elderly tribal woman named Ainet, who taught her to be responsible with her powers. Ororo soon came to be the object of worship of the local tribes, who believed her to be a goddess due to her gift.[57]\n\nX-Men[]\n\nYears later, Ororo found herself in the Savage Land and was forced to battle the threat of a mutant energy manipulator, who used Ororo's control over weather, known as Deluge, who sought revenge against humanity. With the help of the team of mutant heroes known as the X-Men, Deluge was seemingly destroyed and Ororo returned to her life among the tribal people.[58]\n\nMonths later, however, Professor Xavier was left with no choice but to recruit Storm, as he called her, and other mutants from around the world into the X-Men in order to rescue his original students from the threat of the sentient island being, known as Krakoa. Prof. Xavier explained to Ororo that she was not a \"goddess\", but a mutant and had a responsibility to use her abilities to help the world, just as she had helped the local tribes. Curious, Ororo accepted Professor Xavier's offer and was given the code name \"Storm\".[32] After most of the original team left, Ororo, along with fellow new recruits Nightcrawler, Colossus, Wolverine, Thunderbird, and Banshee stayed as members of the new X-Men. This new group of X-Men were mostly adults and trained in the use of their powers in the Danger Room.[59] Storm remained with the X-Men for years. Storm was initially very naive when it came to the customs of the modern world, but her teammate Jean Grey (Marvel Girl), helped educate her in the ways of society and the pair formed a lasting friendship. Jean was also one of the first X-Men to learn of Storm's claustrophobia, after the two women chased a thief into the subway.[60]\n\nStorm’s claustrophobia placed the entire team in danger when they battled Juggernaut and Black Tom Cassidy in Cassidy Keep. In the cellars of the ancient castle, Ororo felt entombed between the walls of solid rocks and went into shock. She could do nothing but cry while her teammates were butchered. Only after all had fallen did she find the strength to fight. However, it was only after the Juggernaut accidentally punched a hole in the wall and she could see the open sky again that she could free the team and turn the tide.[61]\n\nIn the Savage Land Storm encountered M'Rinn at a dimensional interface point in a body of water. M'Rinn and one of her people were in peril, being attacked by an aquatic dinosaur, and Storm saved them, killing the creature. Storm accompanied M'Rinn back to her own dimension for a time, where time passed more quickly than on Earth, aiding her in battle and governing her people. Storm and M'Rinn became close friends and M'Rinn called Storm 'daughter of my heart'. When Storm eventually left M'Rinn's dimension, M'Rinn gave her a Cameo Crystal that allows Storm to get to M'Rinn's dimension with the use of her lightning.[62]\n\nLeading the X-Men[]\n\nAfter serving with the team for many years, Storm was appointed the leader of the team following the departure of the former leader, Cyclops, after the apparent death of Jean Grey. Storm was initially unsure about her new role, but, with the support of her teammates, she soon became a capable leader.[63] Ororo began her friendship with Kitty first, by christening Kitty with her first code-name, Sprite, and even took her dancing at Stevie Hunter's studio.[34]\n\nWhen Cyclops eventually returned to the team, Storm found herself doubting her leadership abilities once more, after a mission she led went wrong. However, Ororo soon asserted her position, reminding Cyclops that she was now team leader.[64] After sensing that Arkon was in danger, Storm, the X-Men, and the Fantastic Four aided him in battling the Badoon. Storm and Arkon admitted their love for each other but decided that their responsibilities were more important.[65]\n\nLater, Emma Frost switched bodies with Ororo, while Sentinels attacked the X-Men. After using Emma’s telepathy, Ororo was able to gain her body back. During a coupe, Ororo helped Cyclops and his father defeat the Sidri and then battled the Brood, Deathbird, and Admiral Samédàr to restore Lilandra Neramani to the Shi'ar throne. After battling in a duel between the Grandmaster and Death, Ororo, with Wolverine, infiltrated the Pentagon, to destroy the files on the X-Men they knew Fred Duncan had and, there, she first met, and battled, Rogue. Later, Ororo was attacked and hospitalized, only to find that Dracula wanted her for his bride. With the help of Kitty and the X-Men, Ororo shed his influence.[66]\n\nNext, the X-Men were sent to the Savage Land, after Angel called and asked for assistance. In the Savage Land, the X-Men were captured, by Sauron and Zaladane, and rescued, by Angel and Ka-Zar.[67] Later, the X-Men went to Limbo, where they battled Belasco and were aided by a future version of Storm that was left in Limbo and trained in magic.[68]\n\nLater, in retaliation, the X-Men were captured and taken into space by the insectoid alien race known as the Brood, Storm fought back but her powers flared out of control. The X-Men discovered that they had been implanted with a Brood egg that would hatch and transform them into one of the aliens. Not wanting to unleash such an evil into the world, Storm attempted to commit suicide by channeling all of the surrounding stellar energy into her own body, destroying the Brood embryo, but leaving her drifting unprotected in space. Ororo would have died in the vacuum had it not been for a member of the Acanti, a race of space-faring, whale-like creatures that had been enslaved by the Brood. The Acanti that saved Storm was revealed to be the caretaker of the soul of his entire race, who had lost his mother to the Brood and needed guidance. Storm agreed to let her consciousness guide the young Acanti, whilst it healed her damaged body, and, after the Brood were defeated, a restored Storm returned home with the X-Men. The X-Men returned home to battle the Brood Queen that was inside of Prof. Xavier and saved his life by transplanting his mind into a cloned body.[69]\n\nAfter Professor X had a televised debate, with Reverend William Stryker, he, Ororo, and Scott were kidnapped, by the Purifiers. While in captivity, Ororo and Scott were tortured and hooked to machines, operated by Dr. Phillip Ramsey, that transferred their pain to Professor X. After Professor X was brainwashed, he fired mental bolts at Ororo and Scott, seemingly killing them, but Magneto and the X-Men rescued them, and Magneto resuscitated them. Professor X was taken to Madison Square Garden, where he was attached to a machine that, using his brainpower, would kill all living mutants. Magneto, with his psi-shielded helmet, was able to distract the Professor enough for the X-Men to destroy the machine. Televised, Cyclops entered into a debate with Stryker about his actions and Stryker pulled a gun, attempting to kill Kitty. Before he could fire, Stryker was shot down, by a police officer. Later at the mansion, Professor admitted that Magneto was right and began to accept his offer to join, until Scott stopped him and stated that he believed in the Professor's dream and will see it come true.[70]\n\nAfter sensing Dracula's summons, Ororo went to face him again. Storm was commanded to steal the Montesi Formula and was opposed by a possessed Kitty and Colossus. With the aid of the X-Men, Dracula was defeated.[71]\n\nDancing in the Dark[]\n\nSoon after, the X-Men encountered the underground community of mutants, known as the Morlocks, who had kidnapped one of their former members, Angel. To save her friend, Storm challenged the Morlock leader, Callisto, to a duel and bested her in hand-to-hand combat. As a result, Storm became leader of the Morlocks, and she ordered them to cease their hostilities against the surface-dwelling humans.[72]\n\nWhen the X-Men later traveled to Japan to attend the wedding of their team member Wolverine, Storm first met the ninja named Yukio and the X-Men battled Viper and Silver Samurai over control of Clan Yashida. A friend of Wolverine's, Yukio was the most carefree spirit that Ororo had ever met and the two became fast friends. Yukio influenced a major rebellious change in Storm's attitude towards life and she took to wearing leather and shaved her hair into a Mohawk.[73]\n\nThe X-Men again battled with Mastermind and then the Impossible Man. After, the team battled the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, and the Morlocks.[74]\n\nLifedeath[]\n\nStorm later had her powers accidentally neutralized by Henry Gyrich with a gun invented by the mutant machinist, named Forge, who took it upon himself to nurse Storm back to health. During her convalescence at Forge’s headquarters in Eagle Plaza in Dallas, Texas, Storm and Forge fell in love, but their relationship was cut short after Storm learned Forge had created the device that stripped her of her powers. Later, alien Dire Wraiths invaded Forge’s headquarters, since he was working on weaponry to be used against them and Naze (Forge's Shaman instructor), Amanda Sefton, and Magik joined with Forge and the X-Men in battling them. Naze faked his demise at the barbed tongue of a Dire Wraith, letting it assume his identity and then fall under the mental control of the Adversary, sparing Naze from this fate.[75] Storm subsequently quit the X-Men and returned to Africa, where she finally came to terms with losing her mutant ability.[37]\n\nWhen the Wraith home world, Wraithworld, began to approach Earth through hyperspace, the X-Men went to aid Rom and, with the help of Forge, banished them from existence. Before, returning to Cairo, Ororo battled Fenris, Andrea and Andreas von Strucker, in the Serengeti and then joined Prof. Xavier's newest team of young mutants, the New Mutants, in rescuing the body of Karma from being possessed by the Shadow King. During which time, the New Mutants met one of Storm's ancestors, Ashake, who helped the heroes return to their own time. After being briefly possessed herself, Storm and the New Mutants exhumed the Shadow King of Karma and Karma defeated him on the Astral Plane.[76]\n\nWhile vacationing with the kids later, the group was subsequently captured by the Asgardian trickster God, Loki. After witnessing her battle hordes of demons,[77] Loki sought to use Storm in one of his schemes to discredit his half-brother, the Thunder God Thor, by giving her a hammer, Stormcaster, that would restore her abilities and making her the new Goddess of Thunder. With the aid of the X-Men and the New Mutants, Storm was able to reject Loki's gifts, thus thwarting his plan.[78]\n\nStorm returned to the X-Men and defeated Fenris, then later found herself being challenged to a duel for leadership of the team by Cyclops. Despite her still being powerless, Storm won, and Cyclops quit the team.[79]\n\nFollowing this, the X-Men came into conflict with Mojo when he de-aged the team, including Storm, into children. This briefly restored Ororo's powers, and her hair was regrown to its' original appearance, though she lost her powers and went back to her mohawk after she and the others were saved from Mojo's brainwashing by the New Mutants.[80]\n\nMutant Massacre[]\n\nAfter battling Malice, Storm and Wolverine investigated the recently bombed home of Sara Bailey, Jean's sister, and Storm was abducted by Crimson Commando, Super Sabre, and Stonewall to be hunted. After defeating the Commando in combat, Storm decided that the X-Men would be more proactive and attack their enemies before they are attacked.[81] Storm suggested that she and Magneto join the Hellfire Club's Inner Circle both as the White King. The union between the Hellfire Club and the X-Men would give the X-Men access to all of the Hellfire Club's government secrets and protect the school, if the Marauders were to attack again. Storm decided that, in order to safeguard their friends and families from their many enemies, the X-Men must fake their deaths and become an underground proactive strike force. After Havok showed up to check on the X-Men, Storm ordered Psylocke to erase the event from his memory, but, due to Professor Xavier's mental defenses, he remembered and, after an initial battle, Havok asked Magneto to accept him as an X-Men and joined the team.[82]\n\nThe team was later abducted by Horde, to use as his lackeys to retrieve the Crystal of Ultimate Vision, of which he wore a shard on his forehead. The X-Men were sent to the Citadel of Light and Shadow, where the crystal was hidden. As the X-Men progressed through it, the citadel created illusions of each of their most powerful desire. Only Storm, Wolverine, and Psylocke were able to resist and, empowered to godhood, Wolverine rejected the god-like power and returned the X-Men and their friend's home.[83]\n\nUnwilling to watch her die, Magneto went to Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic) of the Fantastic Four to use a device that Mr. Fantastic had built to save Shadowcat.[84] Unsure of the outcome, Mr. Fantastic refused to help Kitty, even after the X-Men begged him, and the X-Men and Fantastic Four briefly battled, after Human Torch burned Storm's arm.[85] At that time, Dr. Doom presented his assistance and, under duress, Storm accepted.[86] At the urging of Franklin Richards, Kitty was cured by the combined efforts of Dr. Doom and Mr. Fantastic.[87]\n\nFall of the Mutants[]\n\nSoon, Storm realized that she needed her powers restored and so she sought out Forge for his help. Ororo found Forge's old mentor Naze instead, who informed her that Forge had been corrupted by his nemesis, the Adversary, and was seeking to destroy the world. Unbeknownst to Storm, the Adversary had actually corrupted the Naze look-alike after the battle with the Dire Wraiths.[88] After a Vision Quest with Naze/Adversary, Storm finally located Forge atop a mountain, seemingly opening a dimensional portal filled with demons. Storm stabbed Forge in the chest, but then realized that he had been attempting to close the portal, not open it.[89] The Adversary then trapped Storm and Forge in the other dimension and seized control of Dallas, warping time and space in order to foment chaos on Earth. Storm and Forge spent a year on an alternate Earth, during which time they made peace and admitted their love for one another. During this time, Ororo grew her hair long again. Forge used components from his cybernetic leg to fashion a new device that restored Storm's ability to use her powers, which she then used to energize a portal back to their own world.[90]\n\nOroro and Forge rejoined the X-Men and were captured in Roma's Starlight Citadel that the Adversary had taken over. Ororo was released and, with the X-Men, gave her life to imprison the Adversary, with a spell used from Forge. However, the Omniversal Guardian, named Roma, restored the X-Men to life and freed the Adversary under the notion that there could be no order without chaos. The events had been broadcast over a live television news feed and the world believed the heroes to be dead. After being resurrected, the X-Men decided to use the opportunity to go underground and keep their rebirth secret.[91]\n\nThe X-Men resurfaced in Australia, where they defeated the Reavers. Roma appeared and presented them with the Siege Perilous, a gem that created a portal which granted any person who walked through it judgment and a new chance at life, with a new career, home, and so forth and had magically made them invisible to any sort of mechanical perception. Storm made another change in her outfit, replacing her leather jacket with a black suit with a lightning bolt across her chest.[92]\n\nAfter Storm's Cameo Crystal sensed a disturbance, Storm left in the middle of the night without explanation to the Savage Land. Upon arrival, the Savage Land was scorched and barren and the X-Men followed and battled Garrok, in the armor of Terminus. After the initial battle, Longshot was lost and Storm's Cameo Crystal opened a portal to M'Rinn's dimension, where Longshot was and the Fall People escaped to. Together with M'Rinn's people, the High Evolutionary, and the Fall People, the X-Men separated Garokk from Terminus and with his sacrifice, restored the Savage Land.[93]\n\nLil 'Ro[]\n\nSoon after, the X-Men were ambushed at their hideout, by the crazed scientist known as Nanny and her partner, the Orphan-Maker. After attempting to flee, Storm chased Nanny's craft and was caught in tentacles, while Havok fired a plasma burst and downed the craft. A S.H.I.E.L.D. L.M.D. of Storm was found to ensure that the X-Men would not follow and Storm was assumed dead.[94] Storm was captured by Nanny, who sought to use Storm's abilities in her quest to liberate the world's super-powered children by making orphans of them. Nanny used her technology to de-age Storm to her pre-teens and strip her memories, so as to better sway the mutant to her cause. However, Storm fought back and overloaded Nanny's device. Once more a child with no memories of her life as an X-Man, the young Storm returned to her life as a thief. On one caper, Ororo found herself the target of the psychic being known as the Shadow King, but was saved by a fellow mutant and thief, named Gambit. The pair formed a partnership and, after Storm regained her memories, she took Gambit to meet the X-Men.[95]\n\nStorm was eventually restored to adulthood after the X-Men were captured by agents of the island nation of Genosha who used mutants as slaves. Storm underwent the mutate transformation process, however, the Genoshan Genegineer and Chief Magistrate were members of a rebel faction. They restored Storm's body and mind, and the X-Men were able to defeat their aggressors.[96]\n\nBack to Basics[]\n\nUnder Professor X's guidance, X-Men and X-Factor were united, with Storm and Cyclops leading relatively independent squads, respectively baptized Gold and Blue teams. Alerted by Nick Fury, Cyclops' team investigated Magneto's recent activities and clashed with his Acolytes.[97] Abudcted to Asteroid M with Professor X and Moira, the X-Men were mindwiped to serve Magneto's cause. Storm prepared her squad to war against Magneto and the X-Men despite all the evident odds, with Forge providing the necessary technical support for the mission.[98] As the two squads of X-Men battled each other, Cyclops and his teammates overcame the brainwashing. Together, the X-Men thwarted Magneto's plans and returned home safe and sound following Asteroid M's destruction and Magneto's apparent demise.[99]\n\nContacted by Emma Frost about the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club being targeted for assassination, Storm deployed the X-Men to help, despite the bad blood she had shared with Frost in the past. The X-Men could not prevent a massacre by the time-travelling criminal Trevor Fitzroy, whose Sentinels murdered Frost's students, the Hellions. In the tragedy, Jean Grey fell in battle.[100] Lamenting the death of her friend, Storm was informed by Professor X that Grey's psyche had survived in Frost's body, which had been claimed by Fitzroy as a trophy for his associates, the Upstarts. The X-Men came to her rescue, fighting Fitzroy's army of criminals from the future.[101] Unexpectedly, an enforcer from the future named Bishop and his colleagues from X.S.E. interrupted the battle, leading Fitzroy to escape. Storm reprimanded Bishop for his reckless actions, but was still intrigued by his existence and cause.[102] Later, Bishop hunted down Fitzroy's gang of criminals with extreme brutality, catching Storm's attention. In his war, his comrades were killed and he was subdued by the X-Men. Professor X decided to have him join the ranks of the X-Men[103] under Storm's tutelage. His acclimatization was challenging since Storm opposed to violence as the immediate solution to problems; despite this, he was open to learn from her.[104]\n\nHer obligations as a team leader deteriorated Storm's relationship with Forge, who was distant in his routine as an assistant to the X-Men. Unable to connect with Storm, Forge surprised her by asking her hand in marriage.[105] However, Forge grew uncertain of Storm's actual feelings for him and chose to leave the X-Men before she could accept his proposal. Their relationship ended tragically, even though Storm had decided to accept him as her husband.[106] It took them some time to overcome their hurtful break-up and see each other amicably again.[107]\n\nIn another mission, Storm had the X-Men assess a dangerous spatial distortion in Sakhalin. As a consequence, the team happened upon an alternate plane known as the Void.[108] Separated from the rest of her squad, Storm met Mikhail Rasputin, Colossus' long-time lost brother, who had gone missing in an operation as a cosmonaut. He informed her about the cataclysmic nature of the distortion through which the X-Men went through to access the Void.[109] With the X-Men reunited, Storm advised the traumatized Rasputin brothers to reestablish their relationship. This gave Mikhail Rasputin the inspiration to use his mutant powers to stabilize the Void access and bring himself and Storm's X-Men back to Earth.[110] Some time later, Callisto sought help in Storm and the X-Men as the leaderless and insane Morlocks tormented her to rejoin them. As a leader of the Morlocks, Storm took the responsibility of their crisis for herself.[111] The X-Men were able to stop the Morlock telepath who had triggered their chaotic behavior in the Morlock Tunnels.[101] However, an insane Callisto joined forces with Mikhail Rasputin to seize control of the Morlocks again. Rasputin flooded the Morlock Tunnels and chose to transport them to an alternate plane where they would not suffer discrimination for being different. The X-Men could not stop him, and Storm returned home to mourn the loss of her former protégés.[112]\n\nFatal Attractions[]\n\nThe machinations of the vile Stryfe involved infecting Professor Xavier with the Techno-Organic Virus and kidnapping Jean Grey and Cyclops.[113] Storm led her team to look for Apocalypse and his Horsemen, who were assumed to be responsible for the kidnappings.[114] Apocalypse was defeated,[115] and with him lied a chance to cure Xavier and confront Stryfe. Storm made the difficult choice of trusting Apocalypse[116] and ultimately thanked him for his contribution.[117] In a final strike, the X-Men triumphed.[118] However, as a consequence, the deadly Legacy Virus was released upon mutantkind by Stryfe.[119] As the Legacy Virus punished mutantkind, Storm had her team oppose the villainous actions of known adversaries in the form of the Acolytes and the Upstarts,[120] as well as new threats such as the anti-mutant X-Cutioner.[121]\n\nWhile flying the Blackbird after collecting Vibranium from the Savage Land, Storm, Cyclops and Professor Xavier were attacked by Siena Blaze, whose spatial-disruptive powers tore Storm's connection to the environment. With no control over the frigid Antarctic weather, Storm collapsed, but was assisted by Xavier in regaining control. The X-Men recuperated to defeat Siena Blaze, having secret assistance from Magneto,[122] who was revealed to be alive, but also ready to get revenge upon humanity once again. Around this period, Storm spoke on the funeral of the young Illyana Rasputin, Colossus' sister who had fallen to the Legacy Virus. During the ceremony, Magneto and his Acolytes publicly revealed their extremist plans of endangering the world and building a haven for mutants in Avalon. The disillusioned Colossus defected and turned against the X-Men much to their horror.[123] Not only Colossus fell to darker ways, but also Xavier. He assigned Storm to betray their human allies and steal cloaking technology that was crucial to gain advantage against the Magneto. Storm became frustrated with Xavier,[49] who weaponized the stolen data to brutally put an end in Magneto by mentally incapacitating him.[124]\n\nReconnecting with her loved ones brought new enemies to Storm's life. When meeting Yukio in New York City, she was ambushed by the Phalanx, anti-mutant techno-organic creatures who targeted human allies of the X-Men to incapacitate them.[125] The two dear friends overcame the Phalanx with help from Gambit, though Storm questioned the morality of taking away her enemies' artificial lives.[126] On another occasion, Storm revisited Cairo to meet a terminal Achmed El-Gibar. When sharing her feelings with her mentor and parental figure, El-Gibar was attacked by the vile Candra, who wished to incorporate El-Gibar's band of thieves to her operations. As his last wish, El-Gibar asked his former pupil Ororo to prevent his children from being corrupted, especially the young man named Jamil who Candra had seduced for her cause. Alongside the X-Men, Storm fended off Candra and her army, but Jamil was lost. Achmed El-Gibar passed away, and Storm trained the courageous Karima, whom she related to, to carry on his legacy as the leader of the young pack of thieves of Cairo.[127]\n\nGene Nation[]\n\nOn the rise of anti-mutant sentiment, Storm had the X-Men investigate odd incidents concerning mutant attacks. They were then introduced to Gene Nation, a group of extremist terrorist mutants.[128] They were descendants of the Morlocks who Mikhail Rasputin had transported to another plane. In an accelerated timeline, the younger generation of Morlocks came to age enraged at the previous world that had failed them, wishing to have revenge at humanity for the massacre caused by the Marauders. As the Gene Nation, they returned to bring terror, being led by the ruthless Marrow. A desperate Callisto followed them and asked Colossus for help, who, in turn, resorted to the X-Men. In the Morlock Tunnels, Storm led the X-Men against Gene Nation. Blaming Storm's inefficiency as the leader of the Morlocks for their tragic history, Marrow attached several human victims to explosives. The detonator was placed inside her own heart. In a hand-to-hand duel against Marrow, Storm was challenged to finish her to save the hostages. Seeing no alternative, Storm ripped Marrow's heart out of her chest.[129]\n\nFollowing this incident, Storm was tormented by thoughts of having failed the Morlocks, considering her decisions as a leader reckless for long-term consequences. In the ruins of the Morlock Tunnels, she performed the ritual known as the Ceremony of Light to honor the victimized Morlocks. This attracted the attention of Mikhail Rasputin, who abducted her to the realm he had taken the Morlocks to.[10] The X-Men were informed about her being dead by Cable, who was ultimately convinced to investigate her disappearance. In the harsh world known as the Hill, Storm struggled to tame the atmosphere, until succeeding in arriving at a fortress where Rasputin met her and offered her to guide Gene Nation at his side,[130] an opportunity she contemplated to make up for her past negligence. However, Rasputin was the real mastermind behind their terrorist acts and wished to destroy X-Factor's Headquarters.[131] Having turned against Rasputin alongside Callisto, Storm threatened to execute him if he did not transport her back to Earth, which was done as Cable performed the Ceremony of Light. All inhabitants of the Hill marched to the Morlock Tunnels, where Storm deactivated the bomb and knocked Mikhail Rasputin out. Callisto attacked Storm for her intervention, but was defeated as well, although saved by a very much alive Marrow. Rasputin ran away, afraid of displeasing his master Dark Beast. The Gene Nation ultimately demonstrated respect for Storm for her power and were granted a second chance. Rejoined to the X-Men, Storm was at peace for having solved the dire situation without resorting to murder.[132]\n\nX-Treme X-Men[]\n\nDistrusting Xavier's idealism in regards to the prophetic diaries written by the seer Destiny that mapped the future of mutants, Storm gathered a splinter group of X-Men in order to look for the missing volumes. She cut ties with the rest of the team for her operation and subjected her team to the laws of humanity by leaving the protection of the Xavier Institute.[133] As their baptism of fire, Storm's X-Men were ambushed and captured by the Spanish Guardia Civil in Valencia. This was a trap envisioned by Vargas, a rival who had also had access to Destiny's Diaries.[39] Although Storm led her team to freedom during the battle, Vargas was able to slay Psylocke and brutally maim Beast.[134]\n\nAfter this tragedy, Storm and the X-Men helped a community of Saurids to reach the Savage Land.[135] There, Storm was separated from the team during a plane crash and got kidnapped by the vengeful Brainchild of the Savage Land Mutates.[136] Brainwashed to be his emissary, Storm was devolved into a vicious and feral creature who attacked her teammates.[137] Beast defeated her and caused Brainchild's defeat. However, Storm was left scarred by such an encounter for having embraced savage aspects of her soul.[138]\n\nStill mourning their losses when searching for Destiny's Diaries, the X-Men learned that Gambit had been accused of murdering the Australian crime boss Viceroy.[139] In their investigation, the X-Men realized Viceroy had feuds with the criminal Sydney Triad. Storm and Thunderbird approached Viceroy's mutant children, Heather and Davis Cameron, who were not aware of their father's identity. Storm helped Davis Cameron survive a shark attack while he was surfing and they started a flirtatious interaction. During a date, they were attacked by the Triad.[140] After defeating the assassins, Storm and Thunderbird revealed their identities and intentions to the Camerons and joined the other X-Men in combat against Sebastian Shaw and Lady Mastermind, who had subdued Sage. Storm then coped with the weight of the recent events with her friend Jean Grey's help.[141]\n\nCleared of the charges, Gambit shared he sought to guard Storm's mother's ruby as he had learned it was part of the legendary Madripoor Set of gems. When empowered, the set could open a portal between dimensions. However, the extradimensional warrior named Shaitan suddenly attacked the X-Men, securing Gambit and the ruby. The X-Men followed them to Madripoor, being greeted by its ruling prince Viper. Using the gems and Gambit's mutant ability to empower them, Shaitan opened a portal that allowed the armies of his superior, Khan, to pass through and invade Earth.[142] The X-Men captured Khan being unaware that he was the general in charge of the invasion. Khan became infatuated with Storm, especially after she saved him from Viper. As Shaitan led a successful mission to retrieve Khan, Storm was poisoned by Viper, something that allowed Khan to turn Storm into his prisoner.[142]\n\nWarlord Khan intended for Storm to be his queen and commanded his physicians to heal her while Shaitan assumed her form to trick the X-Men. Growing to admire Khan,[143] Storm attempted to seduce him into calling off his invasion whilst her teammates fought to close the portal.[144] Unexpectedly, one of Khan's concubines, Jalene, grew jealous of Storm's advances and attempted to kill her by stabbing her with a dagger. Despite her severe injuries, Storm prevailed[145] and escaped, rejoining her teammates to destroy the interdimensional portal.[146] Following a final hand-to-hand confrontation against Khan, Storm was victorious and the X-Men saved Earth.[147]\n\nAs part of her subsequent recuperation, which required her to undertake physical therapy to heal her back and legs, Storm was confined to a wheelchair and counted with Wolverine's direct nursing. Jean Grey asked her team to move back to the core X-Men team at the Xavier Institute, but Storm declined, believing that there was still work for her team to do away from Xavier's influence.[148] Around this period, Storm's X-Men became the focus interest of the tabloid Spotlight. They were interviewed by correspondents Manoli Wetherell and Neal Conan as Spotlight's producer, Paul D'Antoni, wished to portray the X-Men as a threat to the world.[149] Unsuccessfully attempting to reason with D'Antoni, Storm learned his show had been cancelled due to the actions of the influential X-Man Archangel, head of one of Xavier's X-Corporation divisions. Storm exposed Archangel's secret actions to the public as a way to punish him for using X-Corp's privileges to operate under the radar in regards of mutant-human relations.[150]\n\nThe schism between Xavier's shady actions and Storm's mission under the human law escalated when a mutant pre-teenage teleporter named Jeffrey Garrett was framed for murder in Anchorage. Xavier Institute's headmistress Emma Frost sabotaged Storm's team's investigation to protect the suspect.[151] This allowed the real mastermind behind the murder, the mutant psychic predator Elias Bogan, to gain access to the X-Men.[152] A recovered Storm and her team took matters to their own hands by invading the Xavier Institute, where Bogan used the Danger Room in order to implement his plans of dominating Frost.[153] Storm and Frost ultimately called a truce to stop Bogan's attack. Though successful, they could not capture him.[154]\n\nAfter being contacted by and recruiting Cannonball for her team,[155] Storm learned about Reverend Stryker escaping prison.[156] While investigating the incident, the X-Men were targetted by Purifiers; Storm used her powers to incapacitate them, but her control was disrupted by Kitty Pryde's effect on Earth since Stryker had used her abilities to carry out his plans. By tracking Pryde,[157] the X-Men infiltrated a mutant community in Mount Haven, where Reverend Paul used brainwashing to keep peace.[158] Storm was initially mind-controlled, but ultimately freed by Cannonball.[159] In the end, both Stryker and Paul sacrificed themselves and the X-Men departed.[160]\n\nX.S.E.[]\n\nDuring a world summit organized by Val Cooper to address the increasing hostilities between humans and mutants, Storm and Gambit furtively attempted to influence its outcome.[161] Attracting the attention of different politicians and government agents, Storm shared her intentions of protecting mutantkind from unfair institutional prosecution and offered her X-Men's services to the United Nations as a global mutant police force.[162] The proposal was approved, and Storm became in charge of a sanctioned strike force in the form of the X-Treme Sanctions Executive, or X.S.E.[163]\n\nBefore X.S.E. was officially established, Alexei Vazhin asked Storm to dismantle a slave-trading network linked to Tullamore Voge that forced mutants to fight in gladiator-style arenas.[163] In Tokyo, Storm contacted Yukio for help. They joined the Arena Circuit and became gladiators managed by Masato Koga. Storm soon ascended as a champion of the Tokyo Arena for having defeated Musclehead.[164] She was then contacted by Guido Carosella, a fellow gladiator who wished to protect her from being corrupted by the arena battles. Fighting for Koga, Storm confronted a champion from another arena, Callisto.[165] By losing the fight, Storm became a property of Callisto's owner, the former Morlock Masque. Masque used his powers to torture Storm.[166] For weeks, Storm acted as Masque's gladiator. Ultimately, Masque forged a deal with Tullamore Voge to sell Storm and Callisto as slaves. They then rebelled against Masque with Yukio's and Carosella's help, tricking him during the trade and shipping him for Voge instead and liberating the Arena's gladiators.[167]\n\nStorm and Callisto returned to her X-Men, who at the time resisted Elias Bogan in Valle Soleada.[168] With Bogan gone, Storm and her team returned to Westchester to help rebuild the Xavier Institute following its destruction at the hands of a Magneto doppelgänger who had also murdered Jean Grey. Assembling her team, she offered them a position in the X.S.E.,[169] which some accepted. The rebranded team operated at the Xavier Institute. In one of their first assignments, X.S.E. clashed with the Weaponeers of Al-Khalad in the Central Saharan Republic.[40] In Washington, D.C., X.S.E. tended to an incident regarding a mutant teenager at a high school. Though facing adversities with local officers, Storm counted with Carol Danvers' assistance in earning credibility for X.S.E.[170]\n\nStorm and her X.S.E. faced many different opponents, such as the cybiote hunter known as the Fury at Braddock Manor,[171] a vengeful Viper in the Murderworld of London,[172] the lethal X-23 in District X,[173] and the Hellfire Club's changing leaderships.[174] Unexpectedly, the Guardia Civil informed Storm about Psylocke's resurrection at the site of her death. Soon after, when looking for a missing Wolverine, the group was kidnapped by the Hauk'ka to the Savage Land. Psylocke and X-23 went to their rescue.[175] Meanwhile, the Hauk'ka attached Storm to a mechanism that tapped into her powers in order to freeze the world and obliterate life on it.[176] As the world succumbed to a brutal ice age, the X-Men freed Storm with Brainchild's help. However, the traitorous Brainchild tampered with Storm's genome in order to maintain the global freezing effect. Storm attempted to have X-23 finish her and stop the threat. Instead, the regretful Hauk'ka decided to stop the uncontrollable Storm.[177] Back home, Storm was reunited with her recently resurrected friend Colossus.[178]\n\nQueen of Wakanda[]\n\nFollowing reports of mutant animals spawning in Niganda, the X-Men went to investigate. Storm personally interacted with locals to retrieve information and eventually ran into Black Panther.[179] They battled the mad geneticist Dr. Erich Paine, who was behind the experiments on animals and managed to capture the X-Men while Storm and Black Panther dealt with raising tensions in Niganda.[180] Black Panther was targeted by Paine's partner, the Red Ghost, but was helped by his Dora Milaje, something that caused Storm to grow jealous. Storm became divided between immediately rescuing the X-Men or following Black Panther's risky plans. Storm went for the X-Men,[181] leaving Black Panther vulnerable instead. With Paine defeated and his plans foiled, the X-Men returned home, but Storm chose to stay in Africa to reconnect with her past and assist the people in need. Sharing a passionate kiss with Black Panther, she predicted their paths might cross again.[182]\n\nFollowing the events of \"M-Day,\" when the majority of the world's mutants lost their powers at the hands of the Scarlet Witch, Storm left the X-Men to return to Africa in order to safeguard depowered mutants. With the mutant population vastly reduced, X.S.E. was dismantled.[183] In Africa, Storm came into conflict with a Colonel named Shetani, who was hunting down and killing depowered mutants in search for Storm. When she finally confronted him, he revealed to her that he was her uncle. Afterward, Shetani told Storm of a hidden village in Northwest Kenya where she met her grandmother for the first time.[184][185] This finally prompted her to accept the Black Panther's marriage proposal.[186]\n\nAt the wedding of Storm and the Black Panther, Iron Man and Captain America showed up but leaving before the ceremony because neither of them could stand the sight of each other. Earlier, Charles Xavier made an appearance, telling Storm that as the queen of Wakanda, she was now the most important mutant in the world, and the living symbol of human/mutant relations. A role he believed she was born to play. When they were married, their essences were taken to the spirit world to seek the approval of the Panther God. Storm soon found she couldn't use her power in this plane. The Panther God accepted her into T'Challa's family.[41]\n\nAfter a two-week honeymoon, Storm entered into the world of international diplomacy at her husband's side. The initial stages of their \"world tour\" brought the royal couple to Latveria, Attilan, and Atlantis, and the discussion always turned towards America, and the potential international consequences of their Superhuman Registration Act. T'Challa and Ororo requested a meeting with the president of the United States to discuss the Act. However, the president's staff refused to even meet with the royal couple until Storm signed the Registration Act. As a powered American citizen, they explained, Ororo might technically be considered in violation of the Act if she did not. Refusing to be pressured into this decision, Storm and the Black Panther left without getting their meeting. A trigger-happy Sentinel pilot initiated a skirmish with the couple outside the White House where pro- and anti-registration demonstrators had gathered, prompting T'Challa and Storm to declare something must be done about the Act.[187]\n\nOroro and T'Challa remained in New York at the Wakandan Embassy, hoping to appeal to the United Nations and foreign powers to put international pressure on America to discontinue their current path. Meanwhile, Wakanda began covertly providing support to Captain America and his \"Secret Avengers,\" fighting as unregistered vigilantes in opposition to the Act. Ororo faced off against the cyborg clone of Thor created under the Registration Act. Although not a true god, the Thor clone's power was tremendous, and his lightning strikes destroyed the Wakandan Embassy as Storm fought to buy the staff time to evacuate. The people were saved, but the building was a complete loss. When Captain America surrendered in the wake of the heroes' battle, Ororo and T'Challa were left to continue their protests against the Superhuman Registration Act alone.[188]\n\nFantastic Four[]\n\nT'Challa and Ororo temporarily joined the Fantastic Four after the Civil War ended while Reed Richards and Sue Storm reconciled their damaged relationship.[189][190] Ororo, also, helped the X-Men with settling an affair with the Morlocks. Ororo, Warpath, and Hepzibah journeyed underground to stop Masque from disfiguring humans. After being rescued by Nightcrawler and Professor Xavier, they had Masque undo all of the damage.[191] After World War Hulk and helping to repair New York City.[192][193]\n\nOroro and her husband later returned home, where the Wakandans had realized that the Skrulls had infiltrated their population. When the first ground troops arrived and were shot down, a ground battle commenced. T'Challa ordered Storm to \"stick to the plan\" and departed quickly, leaving her husband behind. The Skrulls were led to believe that they had captured Storm and her husband, when in fact that the Ororo and T'Challa they had been Skrulls. The true Storm and Black Panther killed the head of the army sent after them, K'vvvr, and sent the ship back to the Skrull homeworld, full of dead Skrulls and with a message written in blood: \"This is what happens when you invade Wakanda\".[194]\n\nSan Francisco[]\n\nAfter building a new headquarters, Graymalkin Industries, and a brief battle against Magneto and some Sentinel robots, Cyclops sent word to all the world's mutants that San Francisco, which had welcomed the X-Men with open-arms, was now a safe haven for mutantkind and that all were welcomed to join them. Ororo found herself being bored with the life of royalty and returned to the X-Men. While at Graymalkin Industries, Storm joined with Cyclops, Emma, Wolverine, Beast, and Armor and the group checked-on a mysterious death, that seemed to be mutant related. After following a trail of mysteriously genetically created mutants and death, the X-Men finally ended on Wundagore Mountain. There, they confronted Forge, who revealed his true madness. Forge endeavored to save the world from the Annexation, an invasion from a parallel world on the other side of the Ghost Boxes, trans-dimensional teleporters, and planned this by sending the X-Men to the parallel universe that was home to the Ghost Boxes, to destroy them before the Annexation could begin. After forcibly opening the Ghost Box, risking all life on Earth, Abigail Brand and Beast fired a world-destroying laser into the opening of the Ghost Box. Before everything could be destroyed, Ororo offered Forge a chance to come back with them and Forge screamed of his rejection by Ororo for marriage and she let him go. Forge remained in his complex as it was destroyed and seemingly perished in the ensuing laser blast.[195]\n\nWorlds Apart[]\n\nWhile aiding the X-Men and ruling the Nation of Wakanda, Ororo was challenged by the Shadow King to choose between the two, by controlling N'Gassi and framing Gentle for murder. After Storm released Nezhno, they were confronted outside by the Wakandan army, Black Panther, and the Dora Milaje, when T'Challa told the waiting crowd that marrying Storm was a mistake and turned to wink at her. After being drawn to the Astral Plane, Storm confronted the Shadow King and he told her of how he controlled everyone, including Cyclops back in New York to kill the X-Men. Black Panther ordered his guards to kill Storm and Gentle and she retaliated with a lightning bolt, then froze the guards and escaped with Nezhno into the forest. Storm concentrated on atmospheric disturbances in order to find Cyclops flying back to San Francisco and destroyed the Blackbird with a lightning bolt, to save the X-Men. After the Dora Milaje attacked, Gentle saved himself and Storm, but the Black Panther arrived to fight Storm. After she overcame him, T'Challa said that he was free of the Shadow King and asked Storm to help him up, but she kicked him in the face, knowing that the real T'Challa would never ask for help. After returning to the palace, Storm prayed to the Panther God to prove to the Wakandan people that Storm was the rightful ruler and several panthers come from around the city, walk through the army, and bow to Storm. The army, then, dropped their guns and bowed to their queen. Storm and Gentle traveled to San Francisco to stop Cyclops and when they arrived, the Shadow King possessed all of the X-Men to battle her. After Storm separated all of the X-Men, the Shadow King left Cyclops and entered Ororo. Unknown to the Shadow King, the Panther God, was hiding inside Storm's mind. Bast ate the Shadow King, freeing everyone from his control and Storm performed CPR to revive Cyclops. After returning briefly to Wakanda to spend time with her recuperated husband, Ororo took Gentle back to the X-Men, stating that she is cable of doing both.[196]\n\nSecond Coming[]\n\nStorm aided the team again when Kaga vowed to kill the X-Men, using bio-Sentinels of mixed X-Men friends and enemies, because he was jealous that they could appear normal with their mutations, and he could not. Storm battled the Hellfire Cult, the Red Queen's Sisterhood of Mutants and relocated on Utopia with the X-Men. After setting-up on Utopia, Storm and Iceman were responsible for the clean drinking water for all of the mutant population. After the return of the mutant messiah, Hope Summers, and Cable to the mainstream timeline, Bastion and his members of the Human Council attacked her tirelessly and Nightcrawler was killed returning her to Utopia.\n\nAfter Ororo attended Kurt's funeral, Bastion systematically eliminated all of the teleporters, except Pixie, from the X-Men's ranks and had Donald Pierce destroy all transportation off the island.[197] Bastion, then, encased the island and much of the San Francisco Bay Area in an impenetrable dome. At the center of the dome, Bastion opened a time portal to his own time where sentinels ruled, and mutants were extinct and sent a beacon to a Master Mold Sentinel to send an endless wave of Nimrods.[198][199]\n\nCurse of the Mutants[]\n\nAfter Bastion was destroyed, Storm fought with the X-Men against the Vampires that had invaded San Francisco and as asked by Cyclops to aide Warren, after Lobe unleashed his mutant plague on Utopia. Warren's small group, consisting of Northstar, Dazzler, and Pixie, safe-guarded San Francisco. The team defeated the Collective Man and captured Lobe's imitation X-Men.[200]\n\nJoining the Avengers[]\n\nLooking to replenish the ranks of the Avengers, Captain America (Steve Rogers) approached the Black Panther, who declined Steve's offer to return to the team, but recommended Storm for membership. Calling Storm to Avengers Mansion, which was swarming with the media and public supporters of the heroes, Captain America asked Storm to join the team. The new Avengers team came to consist of Storm, Captain America, Iron Man, Red Hulk (Thunderbolt Ross), The Protector (Noh-Varr), Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew), Hawkeye (Clint Barton), Quake, and Vision. The press conference was interrupted by a holographic image of Norman Osborn, who accused the Avengers of a litany of criminal offenses against him, and that H.A.M.M.E.R. would rise to challenge the Avengers. Captain America had the Avengers begin an immediate search for Osborn's whereabouts, teaming Storm up with Red Hulk, but all of them were surprised attacked and held captive by Osborn's H.A.M.M.E.R forces. They were eventually freed by Quake, and Storm and the Avengers defeated Osborn and disbanded H.A.M.M.E.R..[201]\n\nAvengers vs. X-Men[]\n\nStorm was summoned by Captain America to an Avengers meeting detailing their plans for the coming of the Phoenix Force and to prepare in case of a fight against the mutants of Utopia. Storm left in disgust,[202] siding with her fellow mutants against the Avengers.[203] After Namor attacked and almost destroyed Wakanda searching for the Avengers, T'Challa named the X-Men enemies of his country. Feeling Ororo betrayed their people by siding with the X-Men, and after Storm threw down her ring after a confrontation with her husband, T'Challa annulled their marriage as the High Priest of the Panther Cult.[204][23] Despite this, Storm still aided the Avengers to free their teammates from the Phoenix imbued X-Men, and in the final confrontation to defeat the Phoenix.[205]\n\nJean Grey School[]\n\nIn the wake of the conflict, Storm returned to the school and was immediately hired as a teacher.[206] Shortly after she arrived, Ororo was among the X-Men (Beast, Kitty, Logan, Rachel, Iceman, Warbird, herself, Doop and Toad) brainwashed by the Murder Circus to serve as performers. During that time, Ororo served as \"Windrider\", an escape artist before the team was freed by some of the students.[207] However, when Beast brought in the teenage version of the original 5 X-Men, Kitty Pryde took it upon herself to train and guide them, and asked Storm to become the Headmistress of the Jean Grey School in her stead, and Ororo accepted.[208][209]\n\nReforming X-Force[]\n\nStorm, who was dealing with anger issues after the end of her marriage to T'Challa, and Psylocke were sent an e-mail by Wolverine's old friend Puck. An e-mail that contained a tip about a drug dealer selling TAO, a drug that made people susceptible to a hive mind mentality.[210]\n\nThe two X-Women met Puck at a bar in L.A., and he led them to an old bank from the 20’s that the drug dealer – the diva of downtown LA - uses to sell drugs and dance. Storm and Psylocke quickly realized the dealer was Spiral, and Betsy quickly attacks her. Storm and Puck head to the bank vault, and find a scared little girl inside the vault, who mentally ordered the people at the club to attack Betsy.[210] Tracking Spiral and the girl, Ginny, the three heroes were attacked in Spiral's flat by a returned from the future Bishop, leaving Storm surprised to once again see her friend completely gone rogue.[211] Eventually, Bishop joined the team and after a battle with Stryfe, the team disbanded.[212]\n\nThe M-Pox Crisis[]\n\nFollowing Wolverine's death, Storm became the sole leader of the X-Men.[213] Ororo's leadership was tested when the X-Men and the entirety of mutantkind were at a crossroads once more. It was discovered the Terrigen Mists that had been released some months ago all over the world by Inhuman king Black Bolt was hazardous to mutants and caused them to develop a disease known as M-Pox.[214] With the help of Doctor Strange and other sorcerers, the entirety of the Jean Grey School was moved to the realm of Limbo,[215] in a territory that became known as X-Haven, where all mutants were welcome and safe from the Terrigen Mists. The M-Pox outbreak caused an ever-growing repression against mutantkind. Storm realized that mutants couldn't simply hide, so in order to show mutants had a place in the world, Ororo rebuilt the X-Men.[214] Around this time, Black Panther requested Storm's help in fighting a revolutionary force in Wakanda,[216] opening the doors to a reconciliation and the reignition of their romance.[217]\n\nAfter the X-Men discovered the Terrigen Mists were close to becoming fully assimilated into the atmosphere, rendering the Earth completely uninhabitable for mutants, Ororo decided to lead her people into a war against the Inhumans with the intention to neutralize them long enough to give the X-Men time to destroy the Mists, since she believed the Inhumans would refuse to do so.[218] The Inhumans and the X-Men eventually reached an understanding and the Cloud was destroyed by the Inhuman queen Medusa, putting an end to the M-Pox crisis.[219] Following the resolution of the conflict, Storm chose to pass the reins of leadership to Kitty Pryde, believing herself to be unfit to serve among the X-Men, but Kitty convinced her to remain in the team.[220]\n\nThe Return of Stormcaster[]\n\nWhen Ororo's foster mother Ainet was prosecuted by the worshippers of a new god who denounced Ororo's godhood, she prayed to the Old Gods to give her daughter the power of divinity. Before dying, her call was answered by the Stormcaster, which laid dormant in Asgard. The mystical hammer was awakened and it sought Storm in the middle of one of her adventures with the X-Men, and she regained the abilities the hammer once granted her. After learning of Ainet's death not long afterwards, Ororo travelled to Kenya and confronted the new dark god worshipped by her former village, Uovu.[221]\n\nUovu attempted to sway Ororo to his side, using his powers to resurrect her late parents. However, Ororo discovered catacombs where Uovu kept hundreds of villagers his followers had killed over the years ready to be reanimated under his command. When Ororo confronted Uovo about this revelation, he summoned his undead army, placing Ororo's parents and Ainet under his command as well.[222] Storm used Stormcaster one last time to confront Uovu in a battle of godhood. She defeated the dark god, causing Stormcaster to turn to dust. Before the people reanimated by Uovu dissolved into the wind, Ororo managed to have final words with both her parents and Ainet. Ainet comforted Ororo for her feelings that she had neglected the village when she left to join the X-Men, assuring Storm that she didn't abandon the village, but rather gave herself to the world.[223]\n\nAge of X-Man[]\n\nIn the pocket reality created by Nate Grey's Life Seed, Storm was reshaped as an X-Man in a society exclusively formed by mutant where interpersonal relationships were strongly discouraged.[224][225] The team soon came into conflict with Murshid En Sabah Nur and his X-Tracts, revolutionaries who endorsed love and community over the state-endorsed harmonious autonomy, which raised suspicions over the veracity of their reality.[226] Storm approached Magneto and they investigated the possibility of being in a illusory reality. Eventually rebelling against the deceitful Nate Grey, they were banished and had their memories erased.[227] Ultimately, by rekindling with the other X-Men, Storm revealed the cracks in Nate Grey's plan, prompting an assault against him as a team.[228] After a final confrontation, the mutants displaced by Nate Grey returned to the main reality.[229]\n\nTwo Thousand Seasons[]\n\nDuring the absence of T'Challa and the Gods of Wakanda, Storm helped Wakanda during their toughest of times. She, along with Shuri and Queen-Mother Ramonda, were able to come in contact with T'Challa, now a member of the Maroons, who informed them about the threat of the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda.[230] Following the battle between the Maroons and the Empire's Flagship, T'Challa returned to Wakanda Prime, and reunited with his loved ones.[231] T'Challa tried to rekindle his relationship with Ororo, and also told her how he was tricked and captured by the empire.[232] The Empire's Askari fighters tried to attack Wakanda Prime, but Storm, and the other Wakandan fighters were able to fend them off for the moment.[233] Storm then confronted General Nakia of the Maroons, who also felt attraction to T'Challa, and wished her luck in Nakia's possible relationship with him.[234]\n\nKrakoa[]\n\nWith Professor X founding a state on the Krakoa island's mutant environment, Storm became one of the mutants who assisted him in accomplishing his plan. Four months prior to the public revelation of the mutant nation, Storm planted Krakoan flowers on the X-Mansion grounds in Westchester. The flowers grew teleporting Gateways and Habitats, all part of the interconnected consciousness of Krakoa.[42] Through this intervention, the X-Mansion became the Graymalkin Habitat.[235]\n\nOn Krakoa itself, Storm acted as part of the support team who helped the heroes of Krakoa invade the anti-mutant Orchis Forge. In a mutant circuit, formed by Beast's and Trinary's control over technology and the Stepford Cuckoos' telepathy, Storm was crucial to make psychic contact with Jean Grey in outer space. The heroes accomplished their goal, but the entire team was killed in the attack.[236] Thanks to the Krakoan Resurrection Protocols performed by the Five, Storm heralded the return of each member to the rest of Krakoa.[237] Then, she became part of the Krakoan supreme body of government, the Quiet Council, sitting at the Summer table, which consisted of the members of Xavier's idealistic X-Men.[43]\n\nAs Emma Frost reshaped the Hellfire Club as the commercial conglomerate known as the Hellfire Trading Company to perform international transactions, one of the company's goals became exchanging Krakoan goods for mutants' safety. Although Storm rejected Frost's offer to be part of its board, she became entangled with this business regardless. Despite Krakoa was for all mutants, Kitty Pryde represented one exception for she was unable to access Krakoa through its Gateways. Witnessing her friend's struggle with being set apart from mutant haven, Storm kept watch of her, worrying for her safety. In a mission to combat Russian anti-mutant militants who counted with Forge's power-dampening technology, Storm sailed alongside Pryde, Iceman and Pyro to liberate mutants. This led Captain Kate Pryde to accept Frost's offer and form a crew of mutant pirates to act on behalf of the Hellfire Trading Company, the Marauders, which Storm was part of[238] as per Frost's suggestion in order to protect Pryde.[239]\n\nAs a powerhouse in the Marauders, Storm took part in several adventures to rescue mutants all over the world.[240] However, they were betrayed by Sebastian Shaw, the Black King of the Hellfire Trading Company who had associated himself with the Homines Verendi in Madripoor. Shaw misdirected Storm and Iceman away from Pryde in order to murder her.[241] On Island M, Storm learned about the trickery after meeting her old friend Callisto, who worked with Frost as her bodyguard, the White Knight.[242] In a uneasy exchange of emotions, Storm and Frost planned to resurrect Pryde and get revenge on Shaw.[239][243] Ultimately, Storm was able to welcome Pryde back to the living thanks to the miraculous Resurrection Protocols. In between these crisis, Storm also contacted Forge to solve his power-dampening technology being available to the enemies of Krakoa.[244]\n\nFlirting with Death[]\n\nSimultaneously to her activities as a pirate in the Marauders, Storm kept acting for Krakoa's and the Quiet Council's best interests. Alongside Cyclops, she invaded an Orchis base, where they found not only many mutants being kept captive, but also a Child of the Vault, the post-human Serafina. Storm interacted with Serafina before she vanished and escaped.[245] Serafina was tracked to Ecuador, where Storm unleashed her power in order to draw attention and allow a secret team to infiltrate the Vault. Although successful, Storm was targeted by the Vault's defenses[246] and corrupted by their technology, eventually falling into a coma. Infected by a machine virus, Storm was given one month to live after being examined and psychically rescued from her coma by Jean Grey and Emma Frost.[247]\n\nStorm refused to accept death, even with the possibility of being resurrected through the Krakoan mutant technology. Monet St. Croix studied her case and suggested that in the adapting environment of the World there could be a device to purge the virus from Storm's body. Storm led a group of mutants alongside Fantomex and A.I.M. agent Ned into the World, being able to reach a machine that decoupled her from the virus. Finally cured, Storm was once more able to balance the scales between life and death and evade a final fate.[248]\n\nStorm's close connection to life and a flirtatious dance with death was made evident when she was drafted into a contest in Otherworld by Majestrix Saturnyne, who pitted champions from Krakoa and its sister and rival mutant nation Arakko to solve their war against each other.[249][250][251] Storm was assigned a role as a swordswoman who should wield Wakanda's most sacred weapon, the Skybreaker. She initially attempted to negotiate the use of the sword with Shuri and Queen Ramonda, with no success since they could not act without T'Challa's consent. Having not enough time to wait for their decision, Storm took the difficult choice of stealing the Skybreaker for Krakoa. The theft put a strain on her relationship with Black Panther and Wakanda.[252]\n\nWielding Skybreaker, Storm joined the Swordbearers of Krakoa and marched to war in Otherworld.[253] Before the tournament, Krakoans and Arakkii enjoyed a banquet during which Storm's courage and ability to avoid death so many times caught the interest of the Horseman of Death. They waltzed and discussed their rivalry.[254] Storm's first trial turned out to be a Blightswill drinking contest against Wolverine at the Crooked Market. This was set up by the Horseman of Death,[255] who had given them the beverage from Dryador to nullify Storm's powers in time for their fight. In spite of being powerless, Storm was still able to brutally defeat the Horseman of Death in a battle for first blood in the vampire court of Sevalith.[256] After Krakoa was declared the winner, Storm returned the Skybreaker to Wakanda but the scars caused by her betrayal remained.[257]\n\nThe tournament delayed Shaw's punishment for having murdered Pryde. Back to Krakoa, Storm witnessed Pryde and Frost viciously maim Shaw, forcing him to comply to their will in the Quiet Council.[258] For being sure Pryde was finally safe, Storm decided she had no further business with the Hellfire Trading Company and decided to leave the Marauders, sharing it first to Callisto. Before she could depart, Callisto invited Storm to be her match at Crucible, the Krakoan killing ritual performed to restore the powers of mutants who had been depowered by the Scarlet Witch. In a dramatic duel, Storm mortally wounded Callisto, allowing her to be revived with full powers.[259] Storm eventually said goodbye to her fellow Marauders and respectfully shared her pleasure in assisting them in their mission for mutantkind. She wished for new winds to sail.[260]\n\nRegent of Arakko[]\n\nKrakoa was contacted by royal advisor Deathbird about the disappearance of Shi'ar Empress and Xavier's daughter Xandra in Chandilar, and Storm, Cyclops and Jean Grey travelled to look for her. Xandra had been kidnapped by rebels led by the Stygian Urr. Storm finished Urr herself, granting her the admiration, respect and gratitude of the Empress in the form of a debt to be collected.[261]\n\nFor the Hellfire Gala, mutantkind decided to integrate the defeated people of Arakko into the universe by occupying Mars. The red planet was terraformed by many Krakoan and Arakkii omega-level mutants, including Storm, who created its atmosphere and founded the Diplomatic Ring on Lake Hellas.[262] Storm then earned a position for herself in the Arakkii society by challenging the omega-level shapeshifter Nameless for the Seat of All-Around-Us at the Great Ring of Arakko. The pair fought in the Circle Perilous with Nameless taking on the form of Storm in her prime. Storm froze Nameless to prevent her movement and shapeshifting, and Nameless chose to die rather than yield. As such, Storm took the position of Regent of Arakko, being in charge of the matters of the people and the land.[44][45]\n\nThrough the influence of S.W.O.R.D.'s director Abigail Brand, Planet Arakko became the diplomatic capital of the Solar System. As the Regent of Arakko, Storm assumed the role of Voice of Sol in the Galactic Council, being a representative for negotiations with alien civilizations. One of mutantkind's main resources during this societal turn was the mines of the anti-magic mineral named Mysterium.[16] On Arakko, Storm discussed the role of Mysterium with Doctor Doom, during a dinner where he alerted her that Brand might represent a threat for their interests. Storm ultimately dismissed Doom for his arrogance.[263] Later, as part of the Great Ring of Arakko, Storm kept facing challenges to prove her worth, constantly facing opponents in the Circle Perilous. One of the combatants was Tarn the Uncaring. Storm battled the vile Tarn powerless, as he was able to genetically turn her powers off. She was victorious and gained more prestige in the Arakkii society.[44]\n\nAt Lake Hellas, a diplomatic meeting between S.W.O.R.D. and the Shi'ar Empire was interrupted by Orbis Stellaris' Lethal Legion as part of Henry Gyrich's plan. Storm intervened, attacking the Lethal Legion,[264] ensuring Empress Xandra's protection by assassinating the numerous Lethal Legion agents. However, Storm realized the S.W.O.R.D. space station had been oddly sabotaged.[265]\n\nSuspicious and uncomfortable with Brand's interventions on Arakko, Storm refused her offer to lead a team of X-Men connected to S.W.O.R.D. to act on Arakko. Instead, Storm distanced herself from the position of ruler, contacting Magneto and Sunspot to form a Brotherhood of heroes to fight for Arakko instead."
