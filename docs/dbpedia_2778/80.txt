Hullo, folks.

I'm hoping someone could help me.

I know that "In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Santi" means "In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" (at least, that's what I've been able to figure out), but, I want it to say 'unholy' instead.

I can't seem to find a word for 'unholy'. I find 'blasphemiae', but I don't think that will work, will it?

It's a title for a fic about demon possession.

Any help would be appreciated.

English: "In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Unholy Spirit"

regards,

ETA- I think I just stumbled on something that might work:

incestus, incesta, incestum = unholy (???) maybe? If so, which one would work best in the sentence's context?
