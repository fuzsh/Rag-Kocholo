Is it not a fact that, at present, there are 6,000 unemployed in the textile industry, 4,000 unemployed building workers and 2,000 unemployed in miscellaneous callings? Instead of making statements about the mythical 50,000 jobs that are awaiting workers to fill them, will the Minister supply reliable statistics to the House with respect to the labour situation in this country?\n\nMr HOLT:\n\nMinister for Immigration · HIGGINS, VICTORIA · LP\n\n– I take this opportunity to correct a misstatement that has been attributed to me in some newspapers this morning. In those journals, I am reported as having told the House yesterday that unemployment at this time is lower than at any other time in Australia’s history. What I said, as I believe honorable members will recall, was that unemployment at this time is lower than that in any other industrial country in the free world; and that is, undoubtedly a fact.\n\nThe honorable member has asked whether I can provide more accurate information on this subject than has already been released. I do not know how it would be practicable to do so. The information that is made available from my department is, I believe, much more accurate than that which was provided in - relation to this, subject in earlier years, particularly in the ‘thirties when a Labour administration was in office. At that time, the only indication that could be obtained with respect to the volume of unemployment in Australia was based upon registrations with the trade unions, and, if I remember rightly, unemployment was then recorded as having reached the peak of more than 30 per cent. Certainly, nothing like that proportion of unemployment exists in Australia to-day. I doubt whether unemployment registrations in trade unions at present would represent 1 per cent, of their total membership.\n\nMr Beazley:\n\n– And that would have been so during the regime of the Chifley Government.\n\nMr HOLT:\n\n– Yes.\n\nMr Beazley:\n\n– Why does not the Minister also make that fact clear?\n\nMr HOLT:\n\n– I have been asked whether we can supply more accurate figures with respect to unemployment, and I merely say that the figures that are now supplied are based upon applications for unemployment benefit. “We also give the number of vacancies that are registered with the department. If it were a significant figure, which it is not at this moment, we should also supply the number of unemployed persons registered with trade unions. 1 can only repeat that the Government is watching the unemployment situation closely, and can be relied upon to take appropriate measures if the need develops.\n\npage 585\n\nQUESTION\n\nCIVIL DEFENCE\n\nMr HAWORTH:\n\nISAACS, VICTORIA · LP\n\n– I ask the Minister for the “Interior whether the Government has given any consideration to the preparation of a policy of basic training in civil air defence. Also, has the Government given any consideration to informing the people of the true facts of atomic warfare? Does the Minister ti gree that there is grave public ignorance about those facts, and that such ignorance could breed a feeling of helplessness that could be of greater national danger than the actual threat of atomic warfare?\n\nMr KENT HUGHES:\n\nCHISHOLM, VICTORIA · LP\n\n– For the past two years the Government has given a great deal of consideration to the problem, that the honorable member has mentioned. Various consultations have taken place, and the Defence Council has obtained a number of appreciations of the position. I personally have been in close touch with the Minister for Defence in relation to the matter. A number of Australian representatives were sent fo. and have now returned from, a special training school in England. The question of what other action should be taken and how much expenditure would be justified are at present under consideration by the Minister for Defence and me. We are also considering the latest appreciations that we have received from the defence chiefs. I can assure the honorable member that there has been no delay of any kind in connexion with this matter. One of our difficulties is, of course, in relation to the question, which the Opposition seemed to answer last night, concerning whether Australia is as peace or at war. If the Opposition maintains the outlook on that matter that it evinced during the debate on passports last night, the Government will not have much difficulty in answering the question.\n\npage 585\n\nQUESTION\n\nPOSTAL DEPARTMENT\n\nMr GEORGE LAWSON:\n\nBRISBANE, QUEENSLAND\n\n– Is the Postmaster-General aware that four male employees of the mail branch of the Brisbane General Post Office, three of whom are ex-servicemen, have received notice of dismissal to take effect next Saturday? Is he also aware that it is likely that a further twelve employees, most of whom are ex-servicemen, will receive dismissal notices within the next two or three months ? As the men affected are all well advanced in years, most of them being about 60 years of age, will the Minister take immediate steps to rescind the dismissal notices of the four mail branch employees whose services are to terminate next Saturday, and also prevent further dismissals?\n\nMr ANTHONY:\n\nPostmaster-General · RICHMOND, NEW SOUTH WALES · CP\n\n– The Postal Department is a business organization and, like any other business organization, it is supposed to pay its way. If it did not pay its way further increases of charges or of taxes would be necessary. For that reason, the management of the internal affairs of the department is entrusted to skilled officers, directors, engineers and so on, who have the responsibility of making recommendations regarding the number of employees requisite to the amount of business to be handled. No dismissals of permanent postal employees have occurred, because permanent employees come under the provisions of the Public Service Act. Any dismissals that have occurred are of temporary employees, who enter the service of the department with the knowledge that they are not taking up a lifelong position. However, if the honorable member will supply me with particulars of individual cases I shall have them examined.\n\npage 586\n\nQUESTION\n\nZINC AND LEAD\n\nMr DRURY:\n\nRYAN, QUEENSLAND\n\n– In view of the urgent need to increase supplies of galvanized iron and piping, particularly for use in rural areas,- and of the fact that the shortage of zinc is reported to be responsible, to a large degree, for the present lack of those commodities, will the Minister for commerce and Agriculture state the steps that are being taken to obtain increased supplies of zinc? Will he also say whether there is any truth iti the assertion, made in some quartrs, that zinc producers are withholding supplies of zinc in expectation of an increase of the Australian price for that commodity?\n\nMr McEWEN:\n\nMinister for Commerce and Agriculture · MURRAY, VICTORIA · CP\n\n– There is no shortage in the production of zinc in Australia for our own essential requirements, and, in fact, there is quite a substantial surplus of that metal for export, but a problem of availability has arisen. The fixed price of zinc for local use is about one-third of the export price, and zinc producers are reluctant to supply zinc to the Australian market in quantities which they may regard as extravagant at one-third of the price for which zinc can be sold overseas. In those circumstances, it has been suggested that an embargo or limitation be placed upon exports of zinc. I have pointed out that the imposition of an embargo or a limit on the exports of zinc and lead, which is in the same category, will not, in itself, make those metals more readily available to the Australian market. Out of that position, an arrangement developed, which I negotiated with the authority of Cabinet, between the metal companies and the State Ministers in charge of prices control. That agreement provided that 50,000 tons of lead and 54,000 tons of zinc would be supplied annually to the Australian market for an agreed period on the understanding that certain prices would prevail. Those prices are in force at the present time. The agreement ran for eighteen months, and expired on the 30th December last. Some lead and zinc companies feel aggrieved that certain Australian companies alone bear the cost of supplying those metals to the Australian market at the substantially lower local price, while other companies, in which the majority, interest is held overseas, have had the benefit of exporting the whole of their production of lead and zinc concentrates at the higher overseas price. That position is the subject of controversy between the State Ministers in charge of prices control, the metal companies and myself, as the representative of the Commonwealth, and I am trying to reach an understanding with the other parties on the matter. However, the agreed quantities of 50,000 tons of lead and 54,000 tons of zinc, which, I am advised, are adequate for our essential purposes annually, are not being withheld from the Australian market during those discussions.\n\npage 586\n\nQUESTION\n\nSHIPPING\n\nMr LUCHETTI:\n\nMACQUARIE, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– I direct my question to the Minister for Labour and National Service in the absence of the Treasurer. Is the honorable gentleman aware that excessive profits are being made by overseas shipping companies engaged in the Australian trade? Has he seen the report that the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company made an operating profit of £18,850,336 last year in its vast activities? If he is satisfied that inordinate profits are being made by shipping companies, will he inform the House whether he proposes to take any steps to protect the . Australian economy? In view of the threatened sale of Commonwealth-owned steamers, does he intend to take any action to safeguard the interests of our primary producers by providing adequate shipping at fair charges?\n\nMr HOLT:\n\nLP\n\n– The report to which the honorable member for Macquarie has referred has not been brought to my notice. I can only assume that such profits, if they have been earned, are the result of trade in the ports of the world by the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company in active competition with other overseas shipping lines. The action taken by this Government in order to protect the commerce around the coast, and the general procedure in relation to the Commonwealth operated ships, are matters of policy. However, I shall bring the question to the notice of those of my colleagues who are directly involved.\n\npage 587\n\nQUESTION\n\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE\n\nMr BRIMBLECOMBE:\n\nMARANOA, QUEENSLAND\n\n– Is the Minister for External Affairs in a position to say whether the Foreign Affairs Committee has met? If so, is that committee functioning in a way that will serve the best interests of the Parliament and of the people of this country?\n\nMr CASEY:\n\nMinister for External Affairs · LP\n\n– Yes, the Foreign Affairs Committee has been in existence for a couple of months. It has met on a considerable number of occasions, and I believe that all the eleven members who compose its personnel will agree that it has started extremely well and is proving a very useful instrumentality. Information available in my department is being made most freely available to the committee, and I have attended practically all the meetings that have been held and have spoken to the members for a total of about three or four hours. I shall continue to attend the meetings of the mittee whenever I am invited to do so. I regret very much that honorable members of the Opposition are not co-operating-\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n-Order! The Minister is proceeding to deal with a matter that is not contained in the question.\n\nMr CASEY:\n\n– The committee is entirely non-political. I believe that it is achieving, or is in the course of achieving, its objective. That objective is the education of the Parliament, in particular private members who do not normally have access to departmental records and information, on one of the most important aspects of Australian affairs, that is our relationship with the outside world.\n\npage 587\n\nQUESTION\n\nARMED FORCES\n\nMr CHAMBERS:\n\nADELAIDE, SOUTH AUSTRALIA\n\n– My question is directed to the Minister for the Army. A complaint has reached me from a member of the permanent military forces to the effect that members of those forces who are domiciled in particular places and are stationed away from their places of residence are now asked to pay their own fares to such places of residence at the time of their normal annual leave. I do not know whether that procedure is being adopted or not, but during the period when I was Minister for the Army warrants were issued to servicemen for free travel to their homes when they were on leave. I ask the Minister whether such a state of affairs as I have described exists, and, if so, is it necessary for these servicemen to pay their own fares from their stations to their places of domicile when proceeding on annual leave? If the practice has been to require them to pay their fares, will the Department of the Army reconsider the matter because of the relatively great expense that would have to be borne by servicemen?\n\nMr FRANCIS:\n\nMinister for the Army · MORETON, QUEENSLAND · LP\n\n– I am pleased to be able to inform the honorable member that his fears are not founded on fact. Every member of the permanent military forces who is granted annual leave from his station to the place of his domicile, which is where his wife lives if he is married or where his parents live if he is single, provided he has declared his parents’ place as his domicile, is given a warrant to cover his fare to that place of domicile. If any soldier has complained that he has had to pay his own fare I should say that he had been absent without leave because it is the practice of the department to pay the fares of soldiers when they are proceeding on annual leave.\n\npage 587\n\nQUESTION\n\nIMPORT RESTRICTIONS\n\nMr HOLT:\n\nLP\n\n– Under the import licensing regulations irrevocable letters of credit are recognized only insofar as they relate to specific goods on firm order before the 8th March. An irrevocable letter of credit is not recognized in respect of goods which were not on firm order on the 8th March last. All goods are subject to import licensing whether or not they are covered by irrevocable letters of credit.\n\npage 588\n\nQUESTION\n\nMEAT\n\nMr CLARK:\n\nDARLING, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– In view of the serious inadequacy of meat production in Australia, will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture take action to promote the production of pig meat, as was done during “World War II., in order to remedy the acute shortage that exists?\n\nMr McEWEN:\n\nCP\n\n– The steps that may be taken to promote the production of pig meat in Australia were discussed by me with the representatives of the States at the recent meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council. The principal limiting factor in relation to pig meat production, of course, is the supply of grains. In Australia, as the honorable member knows, wheat is the principal grain used for pig feed, and there are valid reasons why wheat that is urgently needed throughout the world for human consumption should be made available only in restricted quantities for use as pig feed in Australia. I think that the final solution of the problems lies in the stimulation of the production of other coarse grains, such as grain sorghum, and the Government is conducting discussions with that end in view.\n\nLater :\n\nMr McEWEN:\n\nCP\n\n– I lay on the table the following paper : -\n\nMeat Agreement between Australia and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe paper contains the terms of the fifteen-year agreement between Australia and the United Kingdom. I had hoped that discussion of the interpretative notes on this agreement, to which I have previously referred in the House, would have been completed before the document was tabled. As they have not been completed, and as the general public has a deep interest in the matter, I have decided to table the paper without further delay.\n\nDr Evatt:\n\n– Are copies of it available ?\n\nMr McEWEN:\n\n– Yes.\n\npage 588\n\nQUESTION\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ACCOUNTS\n\nMr McCOLM:\n\nBOWMAN, QUEENSLAND\n\n– I address a question to the Minister for Labour and National Service as the senior Minister in the House for the time being. It applies to a number of departments administered by other Ministers. I have been informed that government departments which purchase goods or services from private business undertakings sometimes take more than the normal period of thirty days to make payments for such goode and services. This, I believe, is causing considerable financial embarrassment to certain companies, particularly under thipresent conditions of credit restriction. Will the Minister investigate this matter, and, if possible, have the situation rectified quickly?\n\nMr HOLT:\n\nLP\n\n– As most transactions of that character presumably come under Treasury scrutiny at some stage, I think that the most satisfactory procedure would be for me to refer the honorable member’s representations to the Treasurer and ask him to make inquiries.\n\npage 588\n\nQUESTION\n\nTOBACCO\n\nMr BRUCE:\n\nLEICHHARDT, QUEENSLAND\n\n– My question is directed to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. For the purpose of enabling Australia’s tobacco production target to be realized, will the Minister investigate the water conservation and irrigation plan for the Dimbulah-Mareeba area that has been recommended by Sir John Kemp, the Co-ordinator-General of Public Works in Queensland. The proposed undertaking would be of the first importance in any programme for the expansion of tobacco production. Will the Minister endeavour to persuade the Treasurer to advance to the Queensland Government sufficient loan money for the carrying out of the project?\n\nMr McEWEN:\n\nCP\n\n– I have studied, both in documentary form and on the spot, the proposals for the expansion of the tobacco industry in the very favorable tobaccogrowing area of Dimbulah-Mareeba, and I am familiar with the Walsh River project, the plan for the diversion of the Barron River and so forth. These matters have been discussed with representatives of the Queensland Government, at meetings of the Australian Agricultural Council, but, unhappily, the Queensland Government has not reacted favorably to the proposal by this Government that special priorities be accorded, from the resources available to the State Government, to those industries which would promote the production of additional export foodstuffs or dollar saving commodities. If the Queensland Government would indicate its good faith in the matter by diverting to the very desirable objective that the honorable member has mentioned some of the money that it proposes to expend upon the electrification of railways in Brisbane, I am sure it would receive the enthusiastic support of this Government and myself.\n\npage 589\n\nQUESTION\n\nWHEAT\n\nMr LESLIE:\n\nMOORE, WESTERN AUSTRALIA\n\n-Will the Minister for\n\nCommerce and Agriculture say whether he or the Government gave any instructions to the chairman of the Australian Wheat Board prior to his departure from this country to attend the meeting of the International Wheat Council at which a renewal of the International Wheat Agreement was discussed? Was the chairman of the board accompanied by a representative of the Australian Wheat Growers Federation? When is the chairman of the board expected to return to this country? If the Government has received interim reports from him on the proceedings of the council, will the Minister indicate to the House the nature of the reports? Will a full report of the deliberations and decisions of the council be made available eventually to honorable members ?\n\nMr McEWEN:\n\nCP\n\n– No instructions were given to Sir John Teasdale, the chairman of the Australian Wheat Board, before he went abroad to act as consultant to the principal Australian delegate at the recent conference of the International Wheat Council. The principal Australian delegate to the conference was Mr. McCarthy, the Deputy High Commissioner for Australia in London, a vice-chairman of the International Wheat Council and a former secretary of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. Sir John Teasdale acted as advisor and consultant to Mr. McCarthy, as also did Mr. Pearce, who, upon my invitation,was nominated to me by the Australian Wheat Growers Federation. For the first time in Australia’s history, arrangements were made for a direct representative of the wheatgrowers to attend an international conference of this kind. Mr. Pearce, Sir John Teasdale and Mr. McCarthy were familiar with the discussions that I had had on the subject with the Australian Wheat Growers Federation . Sir J ohn Teasdale and Mr. McCarthy were also acquainted with the Government’s view on the matter. In due course, I shall make available to honorable members a report on the deliberations of the council. I understand that Sir John Teasdale is due back in Australia to-day.\n\npage 589\n\nQUESTION\n\nARTIFICIAL LIMBS\n\nMr CREMEAN:\n\nHODDLE, VICTORIA\n\n– My question is directed to the Minister for Labour and National Service, who is at present in charge of the House. Is the honorable gentleman aware that, although artificial limbs are successfully manufactured in Australia, major parts of artificial hands and feet must be imported from outside the Commonwealth? Is he aware also that the scope of the present import restrictions covers parts of artificial hands and feet ? As the unwarranted deprivation of these articles is causing some hardship to unfortunate amputees, will he take steps to ensure that the entry of these articles into Australia will be improved immediately ?\n\nMr HOLT:\n\nLP\n\n– I have some knowledge of this matter, although it does not come within my province, because I made some representations to the Minister for Trade and Customs about a case that was brought to my notice recently. As a result of information that was supplied tome then, I can assure the honorable gentleman that cases of the kind that he. has mentioned are examined sympathetically, and that arrangements an; being made for parts of artificial limbs to be brought into this country.\n\npage 589\n\nQUESTION\n\nCIVIL AVIATION\n\nMr FAIRHALL:\n\nPATERSON, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– Will the Minister for Civil Aviation indicate whether a decision has been reached upon the proposal to establish a civil airport at\n\nHexham, New South Wales, to serve Newcastle and the Hunter River area? Will he indicate whether work upon the airport is likely to commence at an early date?\n\nMr ANTHONY:\n\nCP\n\n– There is no prospect of an early commencement of work on the Newcastle aerodrome. The project is one of considerable magnitude. In view of other commitments, it cannot possibly be undertaken at this juncture.\n\npage 590\n\nQUESTION\n\nWATERFRONT EMPLOYMENT\n\nMr OSBORNE:\n\nEVANS, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– I wish to address a question to the Minister for Labour and National Service concerning the present apparently illegal and disruptive ban on overtime on the waterfront. Is the Minister satisfied that the present state of the law relating to employment on the waterfront gives adequate power to the Stevedoring Industry Board or any other authority to maintain law and order in the industry? If not, does he contemplate introducing an amendment of the law? In particular, will he consider making provision for employees in the industry who disapprove of present tactics to form a new union, if the existing union’s defiance of the law should lead to its de-registration?\n\nMr HOLT:\n\nLP\n\n– The legal position as it affects the stevedoring industry is somewhat obscure at present because it is the subject of proceedings before the High Court and the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. Until those proceedings are determined, the Government will not have a clear knowledge of the authority available to it under the legislation. However, the Government has had under consideration for a considerable time certain suggestions for the amendment of the existing legislation which would strengthen its capacity to deal with the type of situation to which the honorable member has referred. I can assure him and the House that the Government is very conscious of the loss and inconvenience that is caused to the Australian community generally by the unsatisfactory position which has been evident on the waterfront recently. The Government is doing what it can, in a variety of ways, to cure the trouble. The final suggestion that was made by the honorable member will certainly receive consideration.\n\nMr FALKINDER:\n\nFRANKLIN, TASMANIA\n\n– On previous occasions I have drawn the attention of the Minister for Labour and National Service to the disastrous position that exists on the waterfront at Hobart where the loading of thousands of cases of apples is being held up as the result of an industrial dispute. Has he any fresh information upon that subject to give to the House?\n\nMr HOLT:\n\n– Through my department and other departments, the Government has been active in trying to improve the situation that exists at Hobart, particularly as it relates to the loading of this season’s apple crop. Unfortunately, that port has ‘ become affected, in common with other major ports throughout Australia, as the result of the ban on overtime that has been imposed by the Waterside Workers Federation. Perhaps that ban affects Hobart most seriously because of the shortage of shipping that is required to handle the apple crop. We have had discussions with the Premier of Tasmania, senior members of the Australian Council for Trades Unions and other persons who, we believed, could effectively co-operate with us in -finding a solution of this problem. Unfortunately, owing to the attitude of the federation, our efforts have not been successful. However, we shall persist in our endeavours to find a solution of the problem.\n\npage 590\n\nQUESTION\n\nMR. C. W. J. FALKINDER, M.P\n\nMr KEON:\n\nYARRA, VICTORIA\n\n– I ask the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture whether he relieved the honorable member for Franklin of his position as Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Department of Commerce and Agriculture because of that honorable member’s disagreement with Government policy in respect of various matters?\n\nMr McEWEN:\n\nCP\n\n– The answer to the honorable member’s question is in the negative. The position is that the honorable member for Franklin, for reasons which he, no doubt, will explain, and which relate directly to his electoral and domestic arrangements, asked to be relieved of the heavy duties that attach to the position of Parliamentary UnderSecretary to my department. The change was made only because he, himself, requested that it be made.\n\npage 591\n\nQUESTION\n\nHEALTH AND MEDICAL SERVICES\n\nMi. DAVIES. - My question, which ia directed to the Minister for Health, relates to the position of men in receipt; of miners’ pensions who are sick but are not entitled to receive free medicine or free medical treatment in the same way as other pensioners. Is the Minister aware that many men in receipt of miners’ pensions are suffering from industrial diseases and that, when they have paid for medicine and medical treatment, they are much worse off than ordinary pensioners, who are themselves in a bad way ? Will the Minister investigate this matter with a view to making arrangements for recipients of miners’ pensions to receive free medicine and free medical treatment ?\n\nSir EARLE PAGE:\n\nMinister for Health · COWPER, NEW SOUTH WALES · CP\n\n– I have replied to questions on this subject several times and have pointed out that because the Department of Social Services controls the payment of age pensions, the pensioners who are eligible for free medicine and medical services can be identified without difficulty. Insofar as other persons are concerned, it is impossible to do so, and as the service is a concessional one, departmental officers would need to be able to identify them as it does age pensioners. We are trying, to arrange for a simple system of insurance to cover the people to whom the honorable member has referred.\n\nMr MORGAN:\n\nREID, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– Does the Minister for Health still intend to introduce his comprehensive health scheme, as he announced some time ago he would do? If so, when does he propose to introduce it?\n\nSir EARLE PAGE:\n\n– I hope to introduce the legislation this year.\n\npage 591\n\nQUESTION\n\nSOCIAL SERVICES\n\nMr COSTA:\n\nBANKS, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– I wish to address a question to the Minister for Health regarding the recipients in Australia of British age and invalid pensions. They receive only 26s. a week plus 6s. 6d. exchange, which makes their total income from that source £1 12s. 6d. a week. Is the Minister aware that’ those people are in urgent need of some help ? Will he assist them by extending the free medicine and medical benefits to them? The matter of identifying them surely should not difficult. Eventually it will be possible to identify them by their haggard appearance. I ask him to extend the benefits to those unfortunate people who are in an even worse position than the persons who were mentioned by the honorable member for Cunningham.\n\nSir EARLE PAGE:\n\nCP\n\n– -It is 30 years since I took up first with the United Kingdom Government the question of reciprocity in the payment of pensions. During part of that time Labour governments have been in office in Australia. Neither Labour Ministers nor I have, so far, been able to negotiate a reciprocatory agreement on the matter. As soon as reciprocity can be obtained - and the Minister for .Social Services is endeavouring to obtain it - the Government will be able to deal with the matter as it has done in the case of other pensioners.\n\nMr PEARCE:\n\nCAPRICORNIA, QUEENSLAND\n\n– I refer to a reply that the Minister for Social Services gave to a question that I asked recently in which he stated that persons who possessed government bonds to the value of £1,000 are debarred from obtaining a pension. Is it a new or an old established practice ? Are such persons treated differently from persons who possess cash to the amount of £1,000? Has there been any alteration with respect to the value of government bonds that a person may possess without forfeiting the right to receive a pension?\n\nMr TOWNLEY:\n\nMinister for Social Services · DENISON, TASMANIA · LP\n\n– In reply to a question that the honorable member for Eden Monaro asked last week, I pointed out that under the means test an applicant for a pension is permitted to hold property to the value of £1,000 whether it be in the form of government bonds or in any other form. No change whatever has been made in respect of that principle except that this Government has increased the relevant property limit to £1,000 from £750.\n\npage 592\n\nQUESTION\n\nRAIL TRANSPORT\n\nMr TURNBULL:\n\nMALLEE, VICTORIA\n\n– Has the Minister for Defence been advised of a conference that will be held at Hay, New South Wales, next Saturday, the 24th MaY, Does lie know that this conference has been called to discuss the building of n rail link between Hay, New South Wales, and Ouyen, Victoria? Such a link would greatly shorten the railway journey between Sydney and Adelaide. The conference will also discuss a link between Patchewollock and Ouyen which would connect the port of Portland with this line. As the building of these railway links would be of great defence value, will the Minister endeavour to be represented at this important conference?\n\nMr McBRIDE:\n\nMinister for Defence · WAKEFIELD, SOUTH AUSTRALIA · LP\n\n– We have been advised of the conference that the honorable member has mentioned. I doubt whether it will be possible for us to be represented at it. However, I shall be pleased to obtain a report of proceedings which will receive the sympathetic consideration of my department.\n\npage 592\n\nQUESTION\n\nMERINO SHEEP\n\nMr DEAN:\n\nROBERTSON, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– I understand that the exportation of Australian pedigreed merino sheep has been prohibited for the past twenty years. Has the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture any knowledge of an application having been made for the removal of the ban? If so, will every consideration be given to the possibility that harm may be done to Australia’s wool industry if exportation of our merino strains is permitted ?\n\nMr McEWEN:\n\nCP\n\n– Representations were made to the Government about a year ago to the effect that we should lift the ban which has been in operation for a considerable time upon the exportation of merino sheep to countries other than New Zealand. The Government considered the matter and decided to take no action with respect to it. In the meantime, a further deputation waited upon me and submitted that it would be in the interests of Australia’s merino stud industry if wider markets were made avail.able to that industry. The deputation contended that if the prohibition were lifted, the numbers that would be permitted to be exported, could be strictly limited. Representations were also made to me to the effect that, in view of the fact that world production of wool was rapidly decreasing, it would be in the interests of the Australian wool industry itself if breeders were permitted to export merino stud sheep to other countries. I told the members of the deputation that they should first convince the Australian woolgrowers of the validity of that request, and that if, as a result of their action, representations were made to the Government on behalf of the great bulk of Australian wool-growers that the ban should be lifted the Government would consider the matter further.\n\npage 592\n\nQUESTION\n\nKURRI KURRI DRILL HALL\n\nMr JAMES:\n\nHUNTER, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– The Minister for the Army in reply to a question that I asked last week said that his department proposed to resume control of the drill hall at Kurri Kurri for military training purposes. As such action will involve the displacement of 70 girls, who are daughters of miners and are employed at that hall in the manufacture of clothing, will he consider using the drill hall at Abermain for the purpose that the department has in mind? The latter hall, like the camp at Greta, is now vacant. As the decision to take over the hall at Kurri Kurri will involve the dismantling of machinery now installed there, will he assist David Jones Limited, who are the manufacturers concerned, by offering to that company the use of the drill hall at Abermain; or, alternatively. make arrangements for the trainees who are called up under the national service scheme to undergo training at the Abermain hall?\n\nMr FRANCIS:\n\nLP\n\n– It is very interesting to hear the honorable member’s persistent pleas on behalf of David Jones Limited. 1 am happy to be able to say that, that company has agreed to vacate the drill hall at Kurri Kurri, which is urgently required to meet the greatly increased requirements of the Australian Army, particularly in respect of field exercise? by national service trainees.. I shall examine the alternative proposal that the honorable member has made,, not as an alternative to the department’s intention, but as a means of meeting the increasing requirements of the Army for drill hall acommodation\n\npage 593\n\nQUESTION\n\nPARLIAMENT HOUSE,\n\nMr MULLENS:\n\nGELLIBRAND, VICTORIA\n\n– I address a question co you, Mr. Speaker. Are you aware of a rumour that has emanated from Darwin,, and which impugns your honour and integrity? It is that starting price betting is taking place within the precincts of this House. Have you any profitable information to impart to honorable members? Are we to take this alleged development - I do not regard it as being a cause for levity - as a reflection upon your vigilance in the past, or will it be a spur to your activities in the future?\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– So far as I, personally, am concerned, I believe that the laws with respect to gambling in the Australian Capital Territory should be strictly observed in the precincts of this House. tn other words, the law makers should not be law breakers. Nor should honorable members connive at breaches of the law which come to their knowledge. When. I became Speaker, my attention was directed to certain things and,, so far as I know, no breach of those laws is being committed in the precincts of this House. If any honorable member has information that discloses breaches of the betting laws, it is his duty, as a sworn member of the House, to pass that knowledge on to the President of the Senate or to me. In those circumstances it will be dealt with. The idea that some honorable members seem to have, that so long as they are in. certain rooms in this House they are entitled to break the law to their hearts’” content, is one which may have rather awkward consequences before very long if certain practices are found to be in evidence.\n\npage 593\n\nQUESTION\n\nPAPUA AND NEW GUINEA\n\nMr McBRIDE:\n\nLP\n\n– by leave- On the 1.4th May the honorable member for Ryan (Mr. Drury) asked me a question about the defence of New Guinea. The importance of New Guinea to the defence of Australia is fully appreciated, and plans have been prepared for the allocation of adequate forces to the island as circumstances warrant. The facts regarding such activities reveal that, action is being taken to develop the defences of New Guinea and to employ natives in defence work, Foremost in the defence of this territory is the navaand air base at Manus Island in the Admiralty group, the establishment of which has been accorded a measure of priority in the defence programme.\n\nIn order to enable the inhabitants of our island territories to contribute to their own defence, the following measures have been taken: -\n\nNavy. - A voluntarily enlisted New Guinea division of the Royal Australian Navy, under the command of a lieutenantcommander, Royal Australian Navy, is being recruited and trained by three Royal Australian Navy Instructors ai H.M.A.S. Tarangau, the naval base at Manns Island. Those natives, when trained, will be employed primarily as seamen and stoker mechanics in the naval small craft used in New Guinea waters.\n\nArmy. - Two infantry units have been formed - (i) The PapuaNew Guinea Volunteer Rifles, which is a citizen military force unit composed of white personnel and supplemented by an Australian Regular Army cadre. The role of this unit is to provide officers and noncommissioned officers for the expansion of the Pacific Islands Regi- ment in war. (ii) The Pacific Islands Regiment, an Australian Regular Army unit with Regular Army officers and a proportion of regular noncommissioned officers and native troops.\n\nAir Force. - Proposals are now under consideration for thi’ formation, within the Royal Australian Air Force, of a native element for employmen in the Admiralty Islands. This element, to be called the Pacific\n\nIslands Plight, Royal Australian Air Force, is designed to provide a useful source of manpower, some of which would he semi-skilled, and to ensure the establishment within the Royal Australian Air Force of training techniques and the development of experience which would enable the maximum use to be made of available native manpower in war.\n\nDr Evatt:\n\n– Could the total overall figures be given?\n\nMr McBRIDE:\n\n– I shall obtain that information and convey it to the right honorable gentleman.\n\npage 594\n\nSTANDING ORDERS COMMITTEE\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n-(Hon. Archie Cameron). - I present the report of the Standing Orders Committee, dated the 21st May, on Standing Order 48.\n\npage 594\n\nHOSPITAL BENEFITS\n\nFormal Motion for Adjournment\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n-(Hon. Archie Cameron). - I have received from the honorable member for Burke (Mr. Peters) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely -\n\nThe failure of the Government to maintain adequate financial provision for hospitals and the consequent re-imposition of the means test and of fees in public wards.\n\nMr PETERS:\n\nBurke\n\n.- I move -\n\nThat the House do now adjourn.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– Is the motion supported ?\n\nEight honorable members having risen in support of the motion,\n\nMr PETERS:\n\n– In December, 1945, the Victorian Parliament passed an act to authorize and approve an agreement between the Commonwealth and Victoria in relation to hospital benefits. The schedule of that act sets out as follows : -\n\nThe agreement shall be in force for a minimum period of five years and thereafter shall be subject to determination after [hereby specify a period of notice by either party of not less than one year].\n\nThe facts in relation to this agreement were that an amount of 6s. a bed a day was to be paid in relation to every bed occupied in every public hospital in Victoria or, and this is particularly important, such other amount as should be from time to time determined. The agreement provided, furthermore, that - the State shall ensure that no means testis imposed on, and that no fees are charged to or in respect of, qualified persons occupying beds in public wards in public hospitals.\n\nThe period of that agreement has not yet expired. No notice of termination of it has been given by the Commonwealth or the State.\n\nSir Earle Page:\n\n– That is untrue.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– Order! I shall hear one case at a time.\n\nMr PETERS:\n\n– Yet, charges are now to be made for beds in public hospitals in Victoria. Yesterday the Prince Alfred Hospital in Melbourne decided to charge public ward patients a minimum of 18s. a day. The Royal Melbourne Hospital has decided to charge 25s. a day and other hospitals, such as the Eye and Ear Hospital, the Children’s Hospital and the Women’s Hospital, have decided to charge patients fees of at least 18s. a day. The Victorian Government sought information on whether it is legal, while this agreement exists, for those hospitals to make charges and to impose a means test. Although all the legal authorities apparently agree that none of the hospitals have power to charge fees, the hospitals still intend to charge them. The law is to be flouted, and the agreement is to be treated merely as a scrap of paper. I know that, when the occasion and the circumstances suit them, honorable members opposite lecture the Opposition, and sections of the community, upon the sanctity of agreements and the recognition that should be given to legalisms and the law. Yet, on this occasion they are parties to the breaking of an agreement. They are ignoring the law.\n\nHad the Government made adequate provision for the hospitals in Victoria, and increased the allowance of 6s. a bed a day in proportion to the rising costs of hospitalization, the imposition of a means test would have been unnecessary. I realize that some Government supporters say, in effect, “We have adopted this policy only because we consider that wealthy persons should pay for their hospitalization”. That point does not arise. The issue regarding the retention or the abolition of the means test was settled long ago in this country. When the hospital benefits legislation was before the Victorian Parliament, no members of the Liberal party attacked it on the ground that they were opposed to the imposition of a means test. They objected to it because the scope of its provisions was not sufficiently wide, and the allowance of 6s. a bed a day was payable only to public hospitals and not to mental hospitals and other institutions.\n\nThe Minister for Social Services (Mr. Townley) announces periodically that the means test, as applicable to age and invalid pensioners, will be abolished as soon as possible. I remind the House that a means test is not imposed in respect of child endowment, pharmaceutical and other social benefits. The majority of Government supporters appear to favour the ‘ abolition of the means test generally. If some of them consider that the means test should be retained, they should advocate its application to the distribution of Aspros, which are taken to cure headaches, as well as to wards in public hospitals.\n\nBut the rights or wrongs of the means test are not the issue at the presen time. Members of the Liberal party in the Victorian Parliament have acquiesced in the principle of the abolition of the means test. The whole problem now is the lack of funds. The costs of hospitalization have risen rapidly in Victoria in the last few years, as evidenced by the fact that the cost of administration this year exceeds last year’s figure by £1,720,000. The Government’s contribution is about £1,000,000 a year. When the hospital benefits scheme was introduced in 1946-47, the basic wage was approximately £5 3s. a week, but to-day it exceeds £10 a week. On the ground of the higher basic wage alone, the payment by the Commonwealth should be increased to 12s. 4d. a bed a day. But even that amount would not cover the increased cost of hospital administration, which has risen out of all proportion to the increase in the basic wage. In 1945, nurses received about £4 a week, and to-day they are paid between £10 and £13 a week. Those figures illustrate my contention that the cost of hospital administration has risen out of all proportion to the increase in the basic wage. Therefore, the Commonwealth grant should be considerably more than 12s. 4d. a bed a day.\n\nI know that Government supporters share with me a deep regret that the number of hospitals in Australia is insufficient to accommodate- all the sick persons in the community. Thousands of people are turned away from the doors of hospitals in every State because those institutions cannot provide beds for them. Yet, the payment of 6s. was more than adequate in 1945 to meet the daily administration charges in respect of each bed.\n\nMr CRAMER:\n\nBENNELONG, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n– Nonsense! The honorable gentleman does not know what he is talking about.\n\nMr PETERS:\n\n– If the honorable member for Bennelong (Mr. Cramer) and some other Government supporters will refrain from mumbling, I shall be in a better position to describe the exact position of hospitals.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n-Order! I ask honorable members to hear the honorable member for Burke in silence.\n\nMr PETERS:\n\n– The report of the debate in the Victorian Parliament on the bill to ratify the hospital benefits scheme shows that in 1946-47, the upkeep of a bed in a public hospital absorbed 3s. 3d. of the allowance of 6s. a day. That was due to the fact that substantial donations were made by private citizens towards the maintenance of beds. The balance of 2s. 9d. was paid into a trust fund for the purpose of meeting the building costs and capital expenditure charges. But that position no longer obtains. A payment of 12s. 4d. a day, even in conjunction with donations from private citizens, would not defray the costa of hospitals in Victoria or elsewhere. Beds in registered hospitals in Victoria number 6,300, of which approximately 1,100 are in the intermediate section. Therefore, only 5,200 beds are available to the vast majority of the people in that State who, in the main, cannot pay the charges for hospitalization in addition to the fees charged <by the medical fraternity. Patients in the public hospitals are subjected to a means test. Large numbers of people, who are admitted to intermediate wards, pay the hospital fees less the” Commonwealth’s contribution of 8s. a day.\n\nHowever, a new situation has arisen in Victoria. The suggestion has been made that the number of beds available in public hospitals free of charge to any member of the community, be reduced from 5,200 to 3,800, and beds in intermediate wards be increased to approximately 2,250. It will follow from the reduction of the number of beds that are regarded as public beds in public hospitals from 5,200 to 3,800 that if 4,000 or 5,000 people who can pay nothing at all seek admission to public hospitals, a large number of them will not be able to gain admission. [Extension of time granted.] Even after having been satisfactorily examined by the almoner or other authority, they will not be able to obtain accommodation.\n\nI favour the free medicine scheme, but I believe that it is. more important that a person who needs a life-saving operation should be able to obtain accommodation in a hospital than it is that people should be able to get free aspros or other pain-relieving medicines. Important as the free medicine scheme is, and I regard it as very important, adequate hospital accommodation is much more important. If no means test is to be imposed in connexion with the provision of free medicine, the Government should utilize the vast resources that it has built up to prevent inflation - and the sum of £100,000,000 has been mentioned in that regard - to provide free accommodation in hospitals for the public. That money would be well spent if its expenditure prevented sickness and death among the public. I suggest that it is more important to save the lives of our citizens than it is to prevent the increasing of costs which is having such a profound effect upon our economy. Inflation is not as dangerous a national disease as are many of the diseases from which human beings suffer.\n\nI appeal to the Government to be logical and not to force Victoria into imposing a means test on those who need attention in public hospitals. This Government holds the purse strings. It pays the piper and therefore it calls the tune. If a means test is to be imposed in Victoria it will be because of the actions of the Australian Government and not the Government of Victoria. I consider that public health is of the first importance, and that everything should be done to make it as easy as possible for all the people to secure the best of medical attention under the most modern conditions. The Government should ensure that the moneys it provides for all the States of the Commonwealth shall be in such proportion as to make unnecessary the imposition of a means test upon those who wish to use the facilities available at public hospitals.\n\nSir EARLE PAGE:\n\nMinister for Health · Cowper · CP\n\n– I can immediately comfort the honorable member for Burke (Mr. Peters), who moved this motion, because I can tell him that the proposals of the Government provide the only way by which the means test on patients in public hospitals can be completely abolished. In England, where no means test is imposed, the fees of patients are paid by the national health insurance scheme. That scheme provides for the abolition of the means test in regard to health services and superannuation. Under the British scheme, every British man and woman directly pays lOd. a week into the national health fund as part of the amount they pay under the general insurance scheme. The honorable member will also be glad to know that this Government’s proposal is that the amount which the various hospitals in Australia will receive under the Government scheme will be three times the original daily amount payable in respect of each bed. The original payment was 6s. and the proposed payment will be 18s. During the six or seven years since the hospital benefits scheme came into operation, the expenses of public hospitals have doubled, but this proposal will triple the benefit that they will receive under the scheme.\n\nMr Curtin:\n\n– Taxation has doubled, also.\n\nSir EARLE PAGE:\n\n– That is so, but the public gets the benefit of that. This year the States will receive £166,000,000 to pay for the capital cost of works that should be paid for out of loans. This is an extraordinarily good opportunity for me to put the true facts of the matter before the people of Australia. I think that it is affrontery on the part of the Labour party, which is practically responsible for the muddle in -which the hospital system is at the present time, to try to highlight that muddle in this Parliament. Honorable members opposite are very unwise from a party political point of view to raise the matter at this time, but very wise from a national point of view. I am astonished that an honorable member from Victoria should have introduced this discussion, because in Victoria no less than 76 organizations have rushed in to help to implement the Government’s scheme. Those organizations are representative of all sections of the people in Victoria. For instance, there is the Hospital Benefits Association of Victoria, the. Protestant Alliance Friendly Society, the Manchester Unity Independent Order of Oddfellows Benefit Society, the Hibernian Australian Catholic Benefit Society, and many others. Practically every friendly society, as well as every bush nursing hospital in Victoria, has indicated a willingness to help in the ‘Scheme. For about six months all those organizations have been enjoying the .benefits of the scheme brought in by the Government which provides an additional 12s. to the original 6s. daily, which -was previously provided for each bed occupied.\n\nMr ANDREWS:\n\nDAREBIN, VICTORIA\n\n– If insured.\n\nSir EARLE PAGE:\n\n– I am glad that the honorable member has reminded me of that, because the honorable member for Burke did not mention that the method whereby the means test could, be abolished in Australia has already been provided by this Government under its free medicine scheme which will cost about £7,000,000 this year. There are approximately 8,000,000 people in Australia. Thus, an average of 17s. 6d. a head is made available to provide free life-saving drugs for every man, woman and child in the country, from the oldest granddad to the youngest babe in arms. At present, a married man can insure hiE wife and family for a premium of 6d. a week. That amounts to 26s. a year, but he receives in return a benefit of 35s. that was not available to him when the Labour party was in power. Thus, he receives 9s. a year more than the total cost of his insurance. It is absurd to say that this scheme cannot work, because the money has been provided. It must he made to work, because the whole hospital system of Australia, which I have studied closely, is “ in the red “.\n\nOne of the reasons for that moribund condition is that . health is essentially a matter for the State governments, not for the Australian Government. When certain referendum proposals were under discussion in this House on a former occasion, I tried to induce the Parliament to ask the people to replace the existing ambiguous reference to health in the Constitution with a clear delegation of power.\n\nDr Evatt:\n\n– But not one of the right honorable gentleman’s supporters would agree to the proposal.\n\nSir EARLE PAGE:\n\n– Nevertheless, ii was a good proposal, and I did my best to have it adopted. Now I have provided a scheme that makes thi1 best of the present poor, paltry provision in the Constitution, -which does not really cover such a situation as exists in Australia to-day. What is the situation of our hospitals? As a result of the introduction of Labour’? hospital scheme, and of another action by the Chifley Government, hospital costs have increased enormously and, at the same time, there has been a tremendous diminution of ‘public support, a? distinct from governmental support, for hospitals. In 1930, only 31 per cent, of the total cost of hospitals had to be found by governments. By 194-5, that proportion has increased in New South Wales to 40 per cent. To-day, in the same State, the figure is 84 per cent. The result of thi« has been the complete destruction of the voluntary system upon which the hospitals previously relied. Formerly, donations to public hospitals in New South Wales amounted to £300.000 or £400,000 a year, but to-day receipts from subscriptions amount to only £114,000 a year. In Queensland, such contributions have decreased from a total of £88,000 to £5,000 a year. The spirit of benevolence of the Australian people is being crushed by this system.\n\nThis Government has come forward with an offer to State hospitals throughout Australia that will increase their revenue by 10s. a bed daily. There are 365 days in a year. Therefore, that contribution will increase their income by £182 a year for each bed. There are approximately 60,000 beds in public hospitals throughout Australia. The total in Victoria, to which the honorable member for Burke referred, is 10,000. Therefore, the income of public hospitals in that State alone will be increased by £1,800,000 annually. The honorable member has said that those hospitals are “ in the red “ to the tune of £1,700,000. Here is a way to make up the whole of that leeway. The hospital authorities themselves are insistent that this scheme be implemented because they contend that the sole alternative is to close down beds by the hundreds, even though shortage of beds has already reached grave proportions. When I visited a public hospital in Brisbane recently, I found 66 patients in a 40-bed ward. The situation is the same throughout Australia. There is overcrowding everywhere because there is not enough money in the hospitals system to provide for ordinary costs of maintenance. Because of this financial stringency, plans for the building of new hospitals in all parts of the country have had to be deferred. Australia’s total of 60,000 beds in public hospitals ought to be increased by 15,000 so that prompt and adequate treatment may be provided for the sick. But we cannot provide those extra beds because of the effects of the Chifley Government’s scheme and because of the introduction of the 40-hour week, another measure that the Labour Government supported. The shorter working week has done tremendous damage to the nursing and hospital systems of this country.\n\nUnder this Government’s scheme, which will provide an amount of 18s. a day for each public hospital bed by means of the government contribution and the insurance premium of 6d. a week for a married man, and less for a single man, a basic income of about £20,000,000 a year will be provided for the hospitals before even one penny is contributed by State governments.\n\nMr Andrews:\n\n– But what about the amount of 25s. a day for each bed that the right honorable gentleman mentioned earlier ?\n\nSir EARLE PAGE:\n\n– It is easy to insure for more than 18s. a day. Furthermore, the contributor already has in kitty the 9s. that he saves under the free medicine scheme. I know of dozens of members of this Parliament who, without any government aid, have insured themselves and their families for hospital benefits. In fact, not long ago, I spoke to the Labour Minister for Health in New South Wales, who told me that he had insured himself with three companies. He was not going to get only £2 2s. a week. He intended to obtain £8 8s. or £10 10s. a week from various organizations in the event of sickness in his family. Hundreds of contributors to the New South Wales Railway, Tramway, Motor Omnibus and Road Transport Hospital Fund, one of the biggest workers’ organizations of that character in Australia, have insured themselves and their families for benefits of as much as £8 8s. a week. I asked one of them why he had done so, and he told me that he wanted to be sure that, should an evil day come when his wife, the mainstay of the family, became ill, he would be able to find hospital accommodation for her even if all public wards were full.\n\nThe richest countries in the world to-day are the United States of America and Canada. The United States of America, which is able to find 8,000,000,000,000 dollars a year to help other countries, has found it absolutely necessary, even though most of its hospital costs are covered by patients’ fees, to establish a vast system of pre-paid voluntary insurance. More than half of the total of hospital fees is provided by such insurance, and 83 per cent, of the costs of hospital maintenance are provided by the fees of patients. Canada, the second richest country in the world, has introduced a similar system. I ask honorable members to consider the psychological and physical effects of the Chifley Government’s scheme, which was introduced in 1945. That scheme was called a hospital benefits scheme, but that was a misleading description. The Labour Government said to the State governments, in effect, “ If you will stop collecting money in your public hospitals, we will provide you with money “. Hospital costs-were then estimated at 6s. a day for each bed, and the States agreed to the scheme on that basis. Later they asked that the rate be increased to 8s., and that was conceded. But what did the Premiers think of that scheme? The present Governor-General, Sir William McKell, who was then the Premier of New South Wales, made this comment -\n\nShould this proposed scheme come into operation, many persons who now contribute to hospital benefit funds would discontinue their payments, so that the Commonwealth Government’s payment of (is. a day would merely be substituted for the Gs. a day now received from other sources. The view of New South Wales is that the proposed scheme would substantially interfere with voluntary contributions towards hospitals. If the sum represented by a payment of (is. a clay in respect of each hospital patient were paid to the State in order to enable it to bring its hospital system up to date by providing additional beds, that would be of more benefit to New South Wales than the proposed scheme would be.\n\nIs it advisable for us to sacrifice, the huge amount contributed voluntarily when we are so fur behind in capital expenditure on hospital facilities?\n\nI have received very strong protests, from an association which represents HO hospitals m New South Wales, against the adoption of the scheme. They express the view that it will affect the honorary medical services.\n\nHe estimated that New South Wales would lose about £1,200,000 a year in voluntary contributions and asked whether it was desirable to sacrifice such an amount when the hospital position was so difficult. The late Sir Albert Dunstan, who at that time was the Premier of Victoria, and whose government remained in power only with the support of the Labour party, spoke in similar terms. So did Mr. Willcock, who was then the Labour Premier of Western Australia. Mr. Hanlon, the Premier of Queensland, said -\n\nI maintain that the Commonwealth scheme is fundamentally unsound. It provides for the payment of so much by the Commonwealth for each patient, but no Commonwealth contribution is to be made towards the cost of those services which .prevent people from having to go to hospital. Under the proposed scheme there will be an influx into the public wards of people who would otherwise be treated at home. [Extension of time granted.]\n\nThe first thing the Hospital Benefits Act did was to substitute for the money that the hospitals had been receiving from patients in public wards an equivalent cash payment by the Commonwealth, first, of 6s. a day and, later, of 8s. a day. In return, the States abolished the means test in the public wards of their hospitals. Consequently, well-to-do people could secure beds in those wards, but, owing to the shortage of hospital beds, that meant that poor men and women were squeezed out of the public wards. Under the present state of affairs, a poor man who requires a hernia operation, or some other operation that need not be done immediately, may have to wait for eight or nine months before he can obtain admission to a hospital, while the bed that he needs is occupied by a well-to-do man, who, under the old conditions, would have paid for a bed in another place. I know of many sick people with very small means who, because they could not secure admission to a public ward of a hospital, paid for admission to an intermediate or private ward. They did so because they needed treatment urgently.\n\nAnother effect of the ill-conceived legislate . i of the Chifley Government was to damage the private hospital system and to cause many private hospitals to close. I think 3,000 or 4,000 beds in private hospitals were lost as a result of that legislation. Pressure upon the public hospitals was increased, because many people who were willing to pay for treatment in private hospitals were forced to seek treatment in public hospitals. In addition, a feeling was created in the minds of the people that the Government alone was responsible for the payment of all hospital costs. In Queensland, that is the position. The position in Victoria is not quite as bad as in New South Wales, because the Victorian Government is finding only 68 per cent, or 70 per cent, of the costs, while the New South Wales Government is finding S4 per cent. The effect of that feeling was to disperse, to a great degree, the voluntary organizations which, over scores of years, had done much to help hospital managements and to cheer patients. In New South Wales and Queensland, donations to voluntary organizations dropped considerably. The system introduced by the Chifley Government discriminated against patients who were very sick, and because they could not obtain a free bed in a hospital, they could be given only out-patient treatment, for which they were charged. Out-patient treatment is on a means test basis, but no means test is applied to in-patients.\n\nThe Chifley Government made provision for an escape clause, in that a screen can be put round a bed in a public ward and the patient charged for treatment. Workmen injured as a result of accidents suffered during the course of their employment are also made to pay when they are in hospital. Practically twothirds of the women of Australia who enter hospitals to have babies pay for treatment and attention. The hospital system in Queensland is supposed to be a free system, but I know that two out of every three women in that State who go into hospital to have babies pay while they are in the hospital. They do so because they wish to have privacy. In one -women’s hospital in Queensland, there were three public wards and one private and intermediate ward, but now the hospital has three private and intermediate wards and one public ward, because the women prefer to pay something to secure privacy. It is worth while to bear in mind that, while all that is happening, the poor old pensioner, about whom everybody is now talking, is still required to pay £2 2s. a week from his pension while he is in a rest home or a similar institution. He is told that he has to pay something for his board and lodging. Something must be done to unable the cost of maintaining hospital patients to be met. In Canberra, public servants are charged £5 or £6 a week for their board and lodging in hostels. This problem is being faced in England. The British Government realizes that, if nursing services are to be provided free, something will have to be done to provide for the actual maintenance, or the board and lodging, of hospital patients, because otherwise the British scheme will not work at all.\n\nAnother- imposition was placed upon the States by the Chifley Government becausethe Pharmaceutical Benefits Act provided that the State governments should pay for all free drugs used by patients in public wards, although everybody else in Australia was entitled to obtain drugs free of charge. I am trying to negotiate an agreement with the States under which the cost of the provision of drugs to patients in public wards will no longer be borne by the States.\n\nI turn now to the effects of the 40-hour week on hospital finance. A hospital has to deal with the physiological condition of a patient. Any nurse will explain that a 40-hour week system, in which the day is broken up into a number of shifts so that patients are attended by a number of nurses, is very difficult to work satisfactorily. In Brisbane, hospital employee? are working a 4.4-hour week regularly, and are paid for the extra four hours a week at overtime rates. That is being done also in the repatriation hospitals, because it is physiologically impossible to work satisfactorily at nursing on the basis of a 40-hour week. The effect of the 40- hour week has been to increase the working costs of hospitals considerably. If hospital staffs worked only for 40 hours each week, larger staffs would be required, and accommodation would be needed for the extra persons employed. But we have neither the money and materials nor the man-power to provide such extra accommodation. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr. Allan Fraser) know« how I have struggled during the last two or three years to secure extra accommodation at the Canberra Community Hospital, which is in the heart of the capital city. If I cannot secure extra accommodation in the Australian Capital Territory, what chance have people who are. say, 2,000 miles away from here? We must do something to off-set the effect of the 40-hour week upon hospitals. Otherwise, we shall get into a worse mess.\n\nLet me say a few words about our own scheme. It is based upon the principle that an extra payment shall be made ? > those who are prepared to help themselves. Some municipal councils have indicated that they are willing to give a quarter of their revenue from rates to hospitals in their areas. I have said that if that sum is equivalent .to a payment of 6s. a day in respect of each bed in the public hospitals in those areas, we shall regard it in the same way as insurance. All that [ am asking the States to do is to conclude an agreement that will be acceptable to this Government, under which they will receive a bigger hospital revenue.\n\nMr ALLAN FRASER:\n\nMonaro · EDEN-MONARO, NEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\n.- The Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) is a political Shylock-\n\nMr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Adermann:\n\nFISHER, QUEENSLAND\n\n– Order! That is not an acceptable term.\n\nMr ALLAN FRASER:\n\nEDEN-MONARO, NEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\n– The Minister for Health is a political Scrooge- .\n\nSir EARLE PAGE:\n\n– I object to that term.\n\nMr DEPUTY SPEAKER:\n\n-Order! The honorable gentleman must withdraw the term.\n\nMr ALLAN FRASER:\n\nEDEN-MONARO, NEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\n– I withdraw the terms. The Minister for Health is a unique character in that he is withholding from the hospitals of the States money to which they are entitled and which they need to provide services for the sick people of the community, except upon the most onerous conditions. He is directly responsible for the reestablishment in Victoria of the system of payment in public wards of private hospitals. He is directly responsible for the re-establishment of the means test in those hospitals. He is extending that system to every State of the Commonwealth. The Minister, in what, I think, must, be regarded as one of the most extraordinary statements ever made in this House, has said that he is abolishing the means test in respect of the public hospitals in Australia. That statement is well worth a moment’s examination.\n\nIn 1945, the Chifley Government established the present hospital agreement, under which it provided 6s. a day for each occupied hed, on condition, first, that payment in public wards should be no longer required ; and, secondly, that no means test should thereafter be applied to any one who was seeking admission to a public ward. In 1945, under the hospitals agreement of the Chifley Government, the means test, which had applied until then, was abolished. That position was maintained until the Minister introduced his new system which is forcing every hospital in Australia to seek and appoint officers for the sole purpose, as required by the Minister’s scheme, of examining the means of patients to determine whether or not they shall be required to pay hospital fees. The Canberra Community Hospital Board, which operates under the sole direction of the Minister himself has notified that from the 1st July, under the Minister’s directions, it will not be able to provide free treatment, in the public wards for an uninsured person, unless that person is first subjected to a means test and his poverty is established. The Minister will agree that that is a correct statement.\n\nSir Earle Page:\n\n– Patients are not subject to any test.\n\nMr ALLAN FRASER:\n\nEDEN-MONARO, NEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\n– The Minister is not doing anything in Canberra that he is not requiring to be done also in every State of Australia. That point has already been made conclusively by the honorable member for Burke (Mr. Peters) who initiated this debate. But the facts that I have given also cancel the extraordinary contention of the Minister that he is abolishing a means test when, in fact, for the first time in seven years, he is re-establishing the means test in every public hospital in Australia. The Minister sighs for a return of the days when public hospitals were chiefly financed by voluntary contributions. But no enlightened community now supports the point of view that the sick of the country should be dependent upon bazaars and button days, charity dances and balls.\n\nMr Andrews:\n\n– And on gambling.\n\nMr ALLAN FRASER:\n\nEDEN-MONARO, NEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\n– And on gambling also. For seven years, the principle that has operated in this country, with the support of all honorable members, is that the public revenues of the community should meet the cost .of treatment for patients in public wards of hospitals. I remind the Minister that the Chifley Government’s scheme, which he has seen fit to criticize, was introduced into this Parliament following the unanimous recommendation of a general committee of members of both Houses of the Parliament. The Minister for Repatriation (Senator Cooper) and the honorable member for Flinders (Mr. Ryan) were members of that committee.\n\nThe Minister made an extraordinary statement when he suggested that under the previous scheme, the well-to-do people were squeezing the poor people out of beds. He has said that he proposes to remedy that position by abolishing the means test so that there will be no longer any examination of the relative financial positions of patients. One argument destroys the other. If, according to his statement, the Minister intends to alter the position so that well-to-do patients will not squeeze poor patients out of beds, obviously he will examine the means of the patients to establish their right to go into a public ward. The fact is that no well-to-do patient has squeezed a poor person out of a hospital bed. A wealthy person can occupy only one bed, and if his medical condition requires it, he is entitled to a hospital bed whether his income is £10,000 or £500 a year. He requires only the medical and nursing services that are required by a poor patient in a public ward. A wealthy person will not make additional demands upon the hospital, medical and nursing services of the community unless, under the Minister’s scheme, he occupies a private ward and asks for special services in return for the payments that he makes.\n\nThe Minister made one other statement which ranks amongst the most extraordinary that have been made in the Parliament when he said that the Government had no money for additional hospital services. The fact is that the Government will collect in the present financial year, and pay into the National Welfare Fund, £180,000,000. In the same period it will spend from the National Welfare Fund £140,000,000. The Minister, therefore, will have a surplus of collections over expenditure in the National Welfare Fund this financial year of £40,000,000, a record figure. But he has stated that he cannot do any more for the poor of this community because the Government has no money.\n\nSir Earle Page:\n\n– What about next year?\n\nMr ALLAN FRASER:\n\nEDEN-MONARO, NEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\n-The Minister has spoken of next year and has suggested by implication that the money must be collected this year because he will be short of funds next year. May I assure him that, as he knows very well, by the 30th June this year, a credit balance of almost £200,000,000 will have accumulated in the National Welfare Fund.\n\nSir Earle Page:\n\n– The honorable member is deceiving himself.\n\nMr ALLAN FRASER:\n\nEDEN-MONARO, NEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\n– The budget papers have shown that the amount to the credit of the National Welfare Fund at. the 30th June will be just on £200,000,000, yet the Minister has said that no money is available to him. He has stated that people must insure in one of the numerous hospital benefit societies if they want free treatment. The Minister forgets that those societies exclude from their benefits all chronic cases.\n\nSir Earle Page:\n\n– That is not so. They are altering the provisions.\n\nMr ALLAN FRASER:\n\nEDEN-MONARO, NEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\n– They have not altered them yet. If the Minister examines any of those schemes to-day, he will find that people who have enrolled in those hospital benefit schemes in response to his appeals, have done so on the condition that they will not receive payment in respect of chronic diseases. The conditions are set out and they also exclude persons over the age of 65 years. The Minister cannot produce in the House the benefit lists of any society which provide benefits to-day to chronic cases or persons over 65 years of age. If he can achieve the inclusion of such cases by an alteration of the conditions, that will be all to the good, but up to the present that alteration has not been made.\n\nMr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Adermann:\n\n– Order ! The honorable member’s time has expired.\n\nDr DONALD CAMERON:\n\nOXLEY, QUEENSLAND · LP\n\n– I think that it would be as well to direct the intention of the House to the wording of the matter to which this adjournment motion refers. The purpose of the mover is to attack the Government for its alleged failure to maintain an adequate financial system to provide for hospitals. Let me point out to the House that the present scheme of finance for hospitals is totally inadequate and that it was introduced by the Chifley Labour Government. The truth is that the Chifley Government’s scheme, which honorable members are asked by the Opposition to maintain, replaced one which at that time was working more or less reasonably well and which, at any rate, provided for the number of patients relatively far more beds than are available at present. The Chifley Government replaced that scheme with one- which could not and did not provide sufficient hospital finance and is now breaking down. It is the breaking down of the Chifley Labour Government’s scheme that is involving the hospitals of Australia in their present difficulties and financial embarrassment, and not the scheme that the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) has proposed, but the Chifley Government’s scheme which is now in operation. Under this motion, the Opposition urges the Government to maintain the latter scheme although’ it has failed and, consequently, has caused the breakdown of the public hospitals system throughout Australia.\n\nThe motion also refers to a means test. The breakdown of the Labour Government’s scheme has obliged public hospitals throughout Australia, because of . insufficient finance, to ask patients who can afford to do so to pay a proportion of the cost of their treatment. But that is not a means test. A means test excludes persons from participation in benefits unless they satisfy certain conditions of the test. Nobody contends that persons with limited means will now be denied admission to hospitals. A man who has been injured in an accident, or has developed acute appendicitis will not be turned away at the hospital door because his financial means are inadequate to meet his hospital expenses. The reference in the motion to a means test is merely propaganda on the part of the Opposition which desires to discredit this Government’s scheme. The only reason why public hospitals are now imposing a charge upon persons who occupy beds is that the Chifley scheme has broken down. In support of that statement, I shall cite illustrative figures in respect of the operation of the present scheme in New South Wales. In 1945, State aid to hospitals amounted to £1,700,000. donations and subscriptions amounted to £241,000 and revenue from systematic contributory schemes, such as are now being revived under this Government’s proposal, amounted to £630,000. These are all round figures. Of the total income of hospitals in that State, 48 per cent, was provided in the form of State aid and 52 per cent, represented collections from other sources. This was the year in which the Chifley Government’s scheme was introduced. By 1950, the form was that State aid had increased to £8,600,000, whilst donations and subscriptions had decreased to £111,000, and no revenue at all was received from contributory schemes. In the latter year, 84 per cent, of hospital income in New South Wales was made available in the form of State aid and only 18 per cent, represented income from other sources. If the Government maintained the Chifley scheme, as the Opposition now contends it should, it could only do so by increased taxation. It would have to make the sky the limit. It would have to increase substantially existing taxes in order to provide free hospital treatment for every one, regardless of the fact that many persons can afford to pay for hospital treatment.\n\nA serious decline has taken place in hospital finance under the existing scheme. In 1944-45, total hospital expenditure in Australia amounted to £10,400,000, of which sum 52.9 per cent, was obtained from non-governmental sources; but by 1949-50 that expenditure had increased to £21,000,000, of which only 20 per cent, was obtained from nongovernmental sources. That means that as a result of the introduction of the existing scheme, the Australian hospitals system lost approximately 30 per cent., or £6,000,000 a year, of the revenue that it had previously obtained from nongovernmental sources. Therefore, the Opposition’s contention that the present scheme should be maintained is extremely remarkable. I shall now cite some figures with respect to another method of hospital finance of which honorable members opposite approve. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr. Allan Eraser) raised a cry about gambling. The Queensland Government conducts a lottery, which is known as the “ Golden Casket “, ostensibly for the purpose of financing the construction and equipment of public hospitals. In 1950-51, revenue from the sale of tickets in that lottery totalled £4,265,000, but, after allowing for administrative expenses and prizes, which amounted to approximately £3,000,000, and the payment of the sum of £213,000 into Consolidated Revenue, a balance of only £1,076,000 was available for the purpose for which the lottery was established. Does the Opposition say that this Government should adopt a system of that kind for the purpose of financing the operation of public hospitals throughout Australia? The figures in respect of all lotteries that are conducted throughout Australia reveal an even worse result. In 1950-51, total revenue amounted to £17,600,000, and after provision had been made for administrative expenditure and prizes amounting to £12,000,000, and the sum of £4,000,000 had. been paid into the Consolidated Revenue funds of the States concerned, the magnificent sum of £1,380,000 remained for the purpose of maintaining public hospitals. In view of those figures, it is idle for members of the Opposition to contend that this Government has, by ignoring them, failed to meet its responsibility in respect of public hospital finance.\n\nWhat is this Government doing in this matter? What the Government proposes is no that hospital accommodation shall be denied to anybody, but that persons who can afford to pay, or who have made provision to do so by joining a hospital benefits fund, shall be asked to meet a proportion of the cost of treatment. The Minister has indicated that when the present agreement with the States expires, he proposes to negotiate a new agreement, on the basis of the present level of hospital bed subsidies, in respect of all persons who are not so insured. In respect of persons who are insured, he will propose that the occupied bed benefit be raised from 8s. to 12s. a day. It is estimated that under the Government’s proposed scheme, the sum of £20,000,000 will be injected annually into the public hospitals system. Such a scheme has much more to recommend it than has the ramshackle financial method that was introduced by\n\nDr. Donald Cameron. the Labour Government. In addition, this Government has taken other measures. The Minister has instituted a pensioners’ medical service.\n\nMr DEPUTY SPEAKER:\n\n– Order ! The honorable member’s time has expired.\n\nMr ANDREWS:\n\nDarebin\n\n.- 1 emphasize that the Chifley Government’s hospital benefits scheme has not failed in any respect whatever. When that Government inaugurated social services benefits of all kinds, it established the National Welfare Fund for the purpose of financing them. That fund was described as Chifley’s nest-egg. The Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden), when he introduced his first budget, said that the National Welfare Fund had been invested in securities; but the amount to the credit of the fund has not been disclosed. He made that announcement at a time when this Government was actively engaged in abolishing the social services contribution as such. Why cannot the Government utilize that fund in order to assist hospitals that are in financial difficulties? Many hospitals in Victoria are in financial death throes.\n\nNotwithstanding what the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) has said, the fact remains that this community, like any other civilized community, is committed to the principle of providing free hospitalization for all who need hospital care. That was the basis of the scheme that the Chifley Government introduced. As health is the first plank of any scheme of public education, hospitalization must be regarded as being analagous to literacy. The Australian community accepts the principle of free education. Therefore, hospital and medical treatment also should be made available free, because the standard of health of the community is analagous in principle to that of education. For that reason, the cost of caring for the sick has for many years been properly accepted as a charge upon the community.\n\nMr Beale:\n\n– The sick poor.\n\nMr ANDREWS:\n\n– No, the care of the sick. I point out to the Minister for Supply (Mr. Beale) that even this Government accepts the principle of financing certain phases of hospitalization directly from Consolidated Revenue. I refer particularly to the treatment of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis. Therefore, the Government is not consistent when it obliges practically every person requiring hospital treatment to pay for it. No complaint is made about the fact that the treatment of persons suffering from infectious diseases and tuberculosis is financed directly and wholly by the community.\n\nWhat is taking place in Victoria at present is the result of this Government’s policy, which is deliberately designed to serve the interests of the British Medical Association. The new scheme will make it convenient for individual doctors - I have no doubt that they will soon take advantage of the opportunity - to group their patients in a hospital. As doctors can secure the admission of patients, there will be a tendency to extend intermediate wards at the expense of public wards. Consequently, many persons who are now joining hospital benefits funds will soon find that no beds will be available for them when they require hospital treatment. That position has actually arisen in Victoria, where no less than 2,000 persons are now awaiting admission to public hospitals. Regardless of what the honorable member for Oxley (Dr. Donald Cameron) has said, a number of public hospitals in the metropolitan area of Melbourne are applying a means test. The seriousness of this position should be estimated in the light of the facts that were given to the House by the honorable member for Burke (Mr. Peters). In Victoria, 6,300 beds are available in the general public hospitals. That number includes 1,100 paying beds, leaving 5,200 non-paying public ward beds. Propaganda in relation to the imposition of the means test on hospital patients has been most subtle. The Royal Melbourne Hospital has decided to charge patients in public wards a minimum of 25s. a day. Even people who have contributed for hospital benefits through friendly societies will find that they will have to pay at the rate of 7s. a day, whilst uninsured persons will be called upon to pay 17s. a day. The remarks of Sir Victor Hurley in relation to these charges are very much to the point, and I ask the Minister for Health to take particular note of them, because the\n\nMinister’s statement about the proportion of the amount of 25s. that is to be available for medicine differs from Sir Victor’s statement on the same matter. Sir Victor said that the 25s. a day fee would not include medical or nursing expenses which, he said, would be free. The fee would bc a charge for board and lodging; lodging in a dormitory, because, in effect, that is all a public hospital ward is! The secretary-manager of the hospital has stated that he hoped to ask patients to pay 17s. a day in advance because private hospitals asked for payments in advance. The charges made by the Royal Melbourne Hospital came intooperation on the 12th May. Lady Brookes, the president of the Queen Victoria Hospital, which is a women’s hospital, has stated that the hospital would seek a payment of 18s. a day, which would net it £1,000 a week. Her succeeding statement bears out my contention that the natural result of this development will be an expansion, of the number of intermediate wards and a decrease of the number of public, nonpaying beds. Lady Brookes said that it was hoped to save another £1,000 a week by the opening of a new intermediate ward. Nobody can logically say that that could be done except by a reduction of the number of non-paying beds. Queen Victoria Hospital patients were to be asked to pay 10s. a day in advance. When we recall that that hospital is largely a maternity hospital we can appreciate more fully the seriousness of the position. The Minister had something to say about the psychological effect on patients of making payments for their treatment. I should like to know what the psychological effect on patients of these charges, which the hospital authorities wish to be paid in advance, will be.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– Order ! The honorable member’s time has expired.\n\nMr HAWORTH:\n\nIsaacs\n\n.- It would be just as well to re-read to the House the text of the motion, because the honorable member for Darebin (Mr. Andrews) seems to have strayed entirely from the issue. The motion refers to -\n\n. the failure of the Government to maintain adequate financial provision for hospitals, and the consequent reimposition of the means test, and of fees in public wards.\n\nI understood from the statements of the honorable member for Burke (Mr. Peters) that he had moved the adjournment of the House for the purpose of directing attention to hospital finances, particularly in Victoria. Knowing that the debate was initiated by Victorians, and particularly by the honorable member for Burke, E am inclined to regard the motion as motivated more by propaganda than, by a desire to direct attention to the condition of hospital finances in Victoria. At present a sharp debate is in progress in Victoria about the best method of financing hospitals. The Victorian branch of the Labour party has introduced a suggestion that a State lottery would be the best means of financing hospitals. That suggestion has caused an upsurge of public indignation in Victoria. Et seems to me to be a bankrupt method of approaching the problem. We should examine closely the statements of honorable members opposite in relation to the occurrences of the last four or five years. Everybody will agree that Australian hospitals to-day are staggering on the verge of bankruptcy. That position is a reproach to governments and citizens alike, but the blame for it cannot be laid entirely at the door of this Government. When aid this bankruptcy in the financial position of our hospitals actually begin? The tangle of hospital finances in Vic- toria dates from 1945, the very year in which the Chifley Government abolished the means test and introduced the hospital subsidy of 6s. a day. Statistics show that before 1945, when the subsidy was not in operation, the means test was imposed by hospitals because they then obtained almost half their financial requirements from payments by patients and from donations. In other words, contributions by governments to hospital finances were almost entirely balanced by private gifts and payments by patients in a satisfactory way. As a result of the introduction of the subsidy, and the propaganda that accompanied it, people who had previously been benefactors to hospitals decided that there was no longer any need for them to make donations. The public was told that intending hospital patients, whether rich or poor, no longer had any i need to worry about obtaining hospital accommodation. The people were led to believe that they no longer had any responsibility in relation to charitable hospitals. That feeling grew, as the statistics regarding donations to hospitals show. As a result of the Chifley legislation, a greater responsibility has been thrown on hospital authorities at a time when the progress of science has led to a considerable increase of the cost of the maintenance of hospitals. The legislation has done incalculable harm to the whole of our hospital system. Another of its deleterious effects on the system was, as the Minister has stated, that it led to the closing down of a large number of private hospitals that had performed a useful service ancillary to that rendered by the major hospitals. The closing of those small hospitals resulted directly from the reluctance of patients to enter them when treatment was available at the charitable hospitals at no cost.\n\nI consider that the Government has displayed a constructive attitude in relation to the parlous condition of hospital finances. It introduced the Hospital Benefits Bill, which has improved the position. I know that the agencies which deal with applications for hospital insurance are dealing with many people who wish to become insured. The Government’s scheme has assured hospitals of an income of at least 19s. a day for enrolled patients. It is true that hospital authorities in Victoria have recommended that the means test should be reimposed, but it is untrue to say, as the honorable member for Burke has said, that people who cannot afford to pay for hospital accommodation will be turned away. Such statements have been denied by the secretaries and managers of charitable hospitals. I am sure that, as the Minister has said, no charitable hospital in this country will fail to keep its doors open for people who cannot afford to pay for accommodation.\n\nThe hospital benefits scheme is now well established in Victoria. Participation in friendly and other approved societies is available to all members of the public, and there has been the greatest cooperation between those organizations and doctors and chemists in order to give assistance and advice to people who wish to become insured.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n-Order ! The honorable member’s time has expired.\n\nMr J R FRASER:\n\nALP\n\n– I believe that the health and well-being of the people areproperly the responsibility of the nation as a whole. I also believe that it would be completely wrong to return to the system of haphazard charity and to the old cap-touching and “ God bless the Squire “ days of 40 years ago, for which the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) yearns so nostalgically. The Government’s decision to introduce this scheme in the Australian Capital Territory has caused great indignation among the residents. The Hospital Board of the Canberra Community Hospital has made representations to the Minister on the matter, and questions relating to the decision have been raised in the press and at meetings of public organizations. But the people have received very little satisfaction from the Minister or the senior officers of his department. The Minister a few moments ago used these words -\n\nHealth is not a federal matter. It is a State matter.\n\nLet me remind the right honorable gentleman that in the Australian Capital Territory the Australian Government has complete and unfettered authority and responsibility in all matters pertaining to its policy on health. Indeed the AustralianGovernment has no need, in the Australian Capital Territory, to seek an agreement with a State government. It is not hampered by any State administration, and no difficulty is placed in its way by any municipal administration. The Australian Government has complete authority and responsibility in the Australian Capital Territory; and I believe that it is avoiding its responsibility to the residents here.\n\nFor many years, the citizens of the Australian Capital Territory paid a hospital tax in return for which they received free treatment in the public wards of the Canberra Community Hospital. Under the instructions of the Minister, a means test has been introduced for the first time. No matter what words the right honorable gentleman or any other Government supporter may use in an endeavour to brush that aside, the fact remains that this scheme introduces a means test into the hospital system in the Australian Capital Territory. When the system of uniform income tax began to operate in 1942-43, residents of the Australian Capital Territory commenced to pay income tax at the same levels as were applied to every other person in Australia. The local hospital tax, which they had paid in order to secure and maintain their free benefits in the public wards of the Canberra Community Hospital, was absorbed in the uniform income tax. At that time an undertaking was given to the residents of the Australian Capital Territory that they would continue to receive the hospital benefits to which they had been accustomed. What is the position now? They continue to pay income tax at the same levels as are applied to everybody else throughout the Commonwealth, yet they are denied the benefit that they enjoyed for years. Indeed, they do not benefit to the same degree as citizens in the States benefit. The p"
