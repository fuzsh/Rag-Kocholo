        "text": "Australian electorate\n\nEast Moreton was an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of Queensland from 1860 to 1878, also known as Moreton from 1874 to 1878.[1]\n\nThe district took in the south-east corner of the state, south of Brisbane and Ipswich. It was a dual member electorate from 1860 to 1873 and a single member electorate from 1873 to 1878.\n\nMembers\n\n[edit]\n\nDual member electorate (1860–1873) Member 1 Party Term Member 2 Party Term George Edmondstone Unaligned 1860–1867 Henry Buckley Unaligned 1860–1860 Thomas Warry Unaligned 1860–1863 William Brookes Unaligned 1863–1863 Robert Cribb Unaligned 1863–1867 Arthur Francis Unaligned 1867–1870 James Garrick Unaligned 1867–1868 John Douglas Unaligned 1868–1868 Henry Jordan Unaligned 1868–1871 Robert Travers Atkin Unaligned 1870–1872 William Hemmant Unaligned 1871–1873 Samuel Griffith Unaligned 1872–1873 William Fryar Unaligned 1873–1877\n\nSingle member electorate\n\nJames Garrick Unaligned 1877–1878\n\n(1873–1878)\n\nBy-election in February 1870\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 17 February 1870, Arthur Francis, member for East Moreton, resigned due to insolvency, and a by-election was called. On the nomination day, 19 February 1870, there were two candidates Robert Travers Atkin and Robert Cribb (who had previously represented the electorate from 1863 to 1867). In his nomination speech, Atkin made accusations against Cribb, who replied vigorously defending himself. The somewhat unexpected outcome of this verbal exchange was that Cribb announced he would withdraw his nomination. Cribb said that if Atkin believed he could represent them so well, the best thing they could do would be to let him try, predicting that Atkin would either resign or be asked to resign within six months. Being the only remaining candidate, Atkin was declared elected.[2][3]\n\nCribb's six-month prediction did not come true. However, Atkin did not complete his term, as he resigned on 7 March 1872 due to serious ill health (pulmonary tuberculosis) from which he died a few months later on.\"The Queenslander.
