        "text": "This weekend the flagship international rugby competition in the Southern Hemisphere kicks off, with the All Blacks looking to continue their stranglehold on the tournament. However, Sir John Kirwan feels that ‚ÄúI personally believe that this is the hardest championship we‚Äôve (NZ) played for a long time,‚Äù he said on The Breakdown. ‚ÄúHow do you go to South Africa with a South Africa in such form and win twice over there?\" The thirteenth edition of The Rugby Championship kicks off with New Zealand Rugby hosting Uni√≥n Argentina de Rugby for back-to-back Tests (in Wellington and Auckland) while Rugby Australia hosts the World Champions (in Brisbane and Perth). It continues the \"mini-tour\" format which will be in place until 2025. This is perhaps the most fascinating Rugby Championship in recent memory. The All Blacks open their title defence in Wellington, where they have not won in their last four Test matches. The vastly experienced Joe Schmidt, head coach role at the Wallabies, will play in his first Rugby Championship (TRC) and will look to bring a host of trophies back to Australia, having not won the TRC since 2015, the Freedom Cup and Puma Trophy since 2022 and the Bledisloe Cup for over two decades. The Wallabies open their account at Suncorp Stadium where they have won 10 of their last 11 games. This includes three wins over the South Africans, who have beaten the Australians only once in Brisbane since 1971. Hall of fame inductee Felipe Contempomi, who played 87-Tests for Argentina, will look to continue Los Pumas strong results over the last two years, with historic wins against the All Blacks (in NZ), the Wallabies and England in 2022 and a fourth placed finish at the Rugby World Cup last season. The Springboks, four-time and current World Champions and the No.1 ranked nation in the world, will look to hold their position at the top of the rankings - hosting the All Blacks in back-to-back Tests in what will potentially decide the 2024 title. Eben Etzebeth will play his 123rd Test this weekend, leaving him four appearances away from equalling Victor Matfield‚Äôs Springbok Test record while they boast the most experienced squad in the tournament by some margin. Meanwhile Scott Robertson will seek to defend a remarkable record for the All Blacks in the competition. - They have won ten of the 12 Rugby Championships including the last four - The have not lost the Bledisloe Cup (contested against Australia) since 2003 - They have held the Freedom Cup (played against South Africa) since 2010 - All-time (Tri-Nations 1996-2011, TRC 2012-2023) the All Blacks have won 100 Tests (from 133) with an astonishing +1,525 point's difference Next year's edition will coincide with The British & Irish Lions tour to Australia and is the last before a new broadcast deal which will take place from 2026.

For now it seems Marvel Entertainment is back at the movies in a big way, with Deadpool & Wolverine on the verge of becoming the 55th movie to make $1B (USD) at the global box office. Astonishingly it will be the 11th Marvel movie in 12 years to hit the ten figure mark. It is a comeback for the biggest movie franchise in history with over $30 billion made across 34 movies? I'm not sure but as a lifetime Marvel fan I'm going to run with it. First, the movie is solid (I gave it 7/10). It is more of a fan film than a genuinely great work, but one that is so decisively not PC it will have great appeal. It also combines the comeback of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and a host of others including Wesley Snipe's Blade, the teasing of Henry Cavill as Wolverine and the return of Chris Evan's Captain America which turns out to be a ruse. This, combined with the recent drop of the fourth installment of the Captain America series (Brave New World) trailer and the mega announcement that RDJ is returning to Marvel - sets us up nicely after a combination of average movies and superhero fatigue. The reveal of Downey Jr. as 'Doctor Doom' is interesting. Will he actually play Iron Man? (Geek alert: The 2016 comic Infamous Iron Man actually sees Von Doom assume the mantle of Iron man...) Captain America: Brave New World (Feb 2025) will see Marvel throw back to the very successful pseudo real world formula that worked for the previous CA films while tying in, without being a sequel, The Incredible Hulk in 2008. Harrison Ford plays Thaddeus E. \"Thunderbolt\" Ross who is also the Red Hulk - which he became to fight Edward Norton's Hulk released the same year as Iron Man. There is also, finally, a tie in to the Eternals Movie. Which of course debuted the MCU as we know it. The next big ensemble is Thunderbolts (May 2025), which ends phase five, welcoming back key characters like Bucky Barnes and numerous players from Black Widow. The inclusion of the Winter Soldier will be interesting as it's likely we will see hints of less CGI and more character development - which made the likes of CA: Winter Soldier and Civil War such critical, and financial, successes. They are not for everyone. Martin Scorsese says they are not cinema. Even Ford, notoriously honest, took a stab, saying it was a role he took without caring. Ouch. Me? They are my childhood. Hero movies. They often talk about comebacks... ...and that you can be the hero in your own story. Chasing Nothing"
