        "text": "Podcast of Percy Smythe's WWI Diary\n\nEarly in 2016 we were approached by Phil Mannell from WWI Digger Stories asking if he could use Percy's diary for his podcast series. He had recently completed the diary of Len Jones also from the 3rd Battalion and we were delighted that he had chosen Percy's story for his second series - it adds a whole different dimension to the prose when read aloud.\n\nI think Phil has done a sterling job without professional equipment or monetary incentive so please leave a review on his iTunes page. Enjoy.\n\n6 Bob a Day WWI Digger Stories\n\nThe other very impressive element to these podcasts is that Phil researches any other diggers mentioned in the yarns and gives a brief overview of their lives and service history. The following information is courtesy of Phil.\n\nEpisode 2.1, “Build up that chest.” Listen\n\nMajor RC Dawson is Major Ross Campbell Dawson of the 1st Battalion, AIF. He suffered a bullet wound to the back of his head during the Gallipoli landing and was evacuated four days later. He was returned to Australia in January 1916., also suffering from neurasthenia (shell shock). Dawson was married and lived at Roseville, NSW. He was born 14 November, 1884 and died 22 August, 1947.\n\nLes Poyitt is probably Leslie Poyitt a postal assistant from Balmain, NSW who was born at Fitzroy in Victoria. Poyitt was in the 56th Battalion when he was wounded at Fromelles on 20 July 1916 and died five days later in hospital at Boulogne. Why I say “probably” is that the time frame does not fit, the Poyitt that died at Fromelle had already embarked for overseas, but the occupation fits. Perhaps Percy had the date or the man mixed up, or there are two Les Poyitts!\n\n“Dubbo” Sharpe is Private 2374 later Gunner Edmund Sharpe of the 3rd Artillery Brigade, a single farmer from Pine View via Dubbo. Dubbo was not born at Dubbo, he was born at Gulgong about September 1892. He is later in the 55th and 5th Pioneer Battalions.\n\nBob Avant is Private later Sergeant Robert Avant was a single clerk from Sydney and supposedly born at Cootamundra, NSW. His real name is Ulysses Grant Kibby and I suspect he was born in the United States in 1882.\n\n2nd Lieutenant Smythe is Leo Clarke Smythe born at Lismore, NSW on 28 April 1895 and was a single bank clerk from Marrickville. A reservist officer when the boys met him, he enlisted formally on 9 February, 1916 and served in the 45th Battalion. He was wounded by an accidental explosion of a grenade during a training exercise in March 1917 and again at Messines Ridge on 7 June 1917 by a machine gun bullet to the wrist. Toward the end of the war he was accepted by the AFC for pilot training. He is not related to the boys. He died in 1947.\n\nStaff McKenzie is Trooper 810 John Stafford Mackenzie , single works overseer from Wee Waa, NSW, born about 1887 at Alexandra, Victoria. He saw 5 months on Gallipoli before evacuation with gastritis. He enlisted in the Light Horse, with the 7th LHR as well as the 12th, but later was a 2nd Class Air Mechanic of the 68th and 2nd Squadrons Australian Flying Corps.

He was born at Jerilderie, NSW in October, 1889. He was a single engineer on enlistment. Alf was returned to Australia in March 1916 with a cataract in his eye before re-enlisting. It doesn’t look like he ever flew planes!\n\nWickham is 2464 Private Alexander Wickham, later of the 45th Battalion who is a single miner from Wallsend NSW and born at Mt Kembla in 1894. He was in St Patricks Hospital Malta with influenza, wounded twice during the war and returns to Australia.\n\nSergeant Hockings is Private later Corporal Albert Charles Hockings, a married painter from Canterbury, NSW.

He was born in September, 1891 and would serve in the Imperial Camel Corps. His only major injury in the war is from a camel bite on his private parts!\n\nCharlie Bruce is Private, later Lieutenant 1390 Charles John Bruce, a single plumber from Blakehurst, NSW. With reinforcements for the 19th Battalion, he embarked on the Ceramic on 25 June, 1915, a couple weeks before Percy leaves on the Orova. He was born at Glasgow, Scotland about 1880. He was later transferred to the 2nd Pioneer Battalion.\n\nNot a soldier: Jack Elliott will become Percy’s frequent correspondent through most of the diary. John Bramwell Elliott was born at Hurstville NSW on 11 September 1894. Jack was firmly against the war, a pacifist and a conscientious objector. He was living in Taree, with his address given as “Church of Christ, Taree” when he appeared before the Court for refusing to take the oath of affirmation. The case was heard on 13 November 1916 and Jack was sentenced to four months jail with hard labour. That evening in the police cells, before being transported to Maitland Jail, Jack swore the oath and was immediately released. Although Percy and Jack were extremely religious and had attended the same church, becoming very good friends, this difference of opinion on Christianity and the war came between them. Jack worked most of his life as a train driver on the NSW North Coast. He married shortly after the war and had two children. Tragically, Jack suffered a heart attack and died while swimming at Newcastle on 31 January 1950.\n\nEpisode 2.2 “Crimed for what?” Listen\n\n“Winnie Shearston’s brother” is either Arthur William or Horace Shearston of Manly, NSW.

Rather than read the citation, this is how it happened in Topsy’s own words as reported in Reveille and the 3rd Battalion history by Captain Wren;\n\n“Reaching a position about 300 metres in the rear of “Gutzer” Farm, I was required to take out my company Lewis guns and act as a covering party, while new trenches were dug. The night was slipping away fast, and we knew Fritz would attack at dawn. While scouting for gun positions in the semi-darkness, I discovered the bodies of a young woman about 25 and a girl of 8. Evidently, they had been caught by enemy gun-fire during the day. At the sight of those poor souls, I saw ‘red’ and swore to take toll of Fritz if an opportunity came. Digging operations completed just before daybreak, my guns were withdrawn to the front line. But the position at “Gutzer” Farm appealed to me as an observation post, and I received permission from Lieutenant “Dad” Jarvis to take a Lewis gun out there. Four men readily volunteered to go with me and carry ammunition. We had scarcely got into position and were gazing towards the village of Merris, over the undulating country, when we saw miles of infantry, slowly, but surely, goose-stepping towards us. Officers on grey horses were riding up and down the column. It really was a wonderful sight. I sent one of my men back to headquarters with a message, and within a few minutes the most wonderful slaughter was going on. However, in spite of terrible losses, Fritz kept coming on, and was soon within point-blank range of my gun. So I decided to present him with 1,150 rounds of SAA. It was like firing into a haystack – one could not miss. The Germans were about six deep in places. They were very much unsettled in front, but kept creeping up on both flanks. I sent the other three men back to the line while I emptied the remaining magazines. As I finished, there were “Hocks” uncomfortably close, so I grabbed the gun and bolted across No-Man’s Land, followed by a hail of bullets. I reached the trench without a scratch, though one bullet tore a hole in the back of my tunic.”\n\nMr Bishop is Lieutenant 197 Harold Mackay Bishop.

The men of the 3rd Battalion found her in late April and the men provided her with money and food. Tom Avery took her to the refugee camp in the officer’s mess cart. (Wren P292).\n\nTom was in the 7th Reinforcement of the 18th Battalion and like many of the men in that group he was taken on strength to the 3rd Battalion instead of the 18th Battalion.
