Speaker.\n\nMr RIORDAN:\n\nPhillip\n\n– I propose to the House for its Speaker,MrCope, and move:\n\nThat the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Cope) do take the Chair of this House as Speaker.\n\nMr Cross:\n\n– I second the nomination.\n\nMr Cope:\n\n– I accept the nomination.\n\nMr LYNCH:\n\nFlinders\n\n– I propose to the House for its Speaker, Mr Giles, and move:\n\nThat the honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles) do take the Chair of this House as Speaker.\n\nMr Sinclair:\n\n– I second the nomination.\n\nMr Giles:\n\n– I accept the nomination. (The time for further proposals having expired)\n\nMr RIORDAN (Phillip)- The honourable member for Sydney has been a member of this House for more than 19 years. During that time he has acquitted himself well in the important task of being Speaker of this House. Mr Cope has represented his electorate with dedication, sincerity and distinction during the whole of that period. He enjoys the massive support of the persons he represents in this place. He is, indeed, a worthy person to be proposed as the Speaker of this Parliament. He is one whose attitudes have not changed as a result of success he has achieved. He is one who has attempted to keep order in this House, particularly amongst some who do not appreciate or understand normal courtesies which are often practised in places of lesser importance in the community. He is one who has shown equal courtesy, in his application of his duties to the humble and exalted alike. Mr Cope was Speaker during the twenty-eighth Parliament and during that time he had many difficult tasks to perform. As one often looks across this chamber one often wonders where the courtesy has gone.\n\nThe office of Speaker is not an easy position to occupy. I have great confidence that Mr Cope will again exert his best influence and his best efforts to ensure that the affairs of this Parliament and this House are conducted in a manner befitting the traditions of the honour which has been bestowed and the responsibility which has been imposed on every member who is elected to this House.\n\nMr Cope occupied the position of Mr Speaker in the last Parliament with very great distinction. He showed great tolerance in many difficult situations. His knowledge of the Standing Orders and procedures of the House is beyond question. He conducted himself in the discharge of his duties in an impartial manner and was fair and just to every member from both sides of this House. In tense situations, he displayed an ability to act with firmness and good humour, his quick wit often taking the heat out of debates in this Parliament.\n\nThe task of maintaining order in this House is a very difficult one. A particular ability is required - an ability which Mr Cope possesses.\n\nThere is important work to be done in this Parliament. This House is the place where the people’s voice is to be heard; it is the cornerstone of democracy in Australia. The role of the Speaker is to ensure that rules of debate determined by this House for its own conduct are applied without fear or favour. In my view - and I believe in the collective opinion of this House - Mr Cope is the member best qualified for this important task. I unhesitatingly request this House to support the nomination made by me and seconded by my friend from Brisbane for the election of Mr Cope to be the Speaker of this House. The nomination should be carried unanimously. If it is dealt with on the basis of justice and equity it will be determined in that way.\n\nMr LYNCH (Flinders)- The office of Speaker has evolved over 600 years of British parliamentary history. The first holder of this office was officially installed in 1377. The role of the Speaker has developed through history from the status of the Crown’s nominee to its present function which is characterised by an impartial commitment to the process of democratic government. The Speakership has been correctly described as the non-political embodiment of the House as a whole. Mr Clerk, all parties and all members in the national Parliament have a right to expect objectivity, fairness and independence from the Speaker of this House.\n\nAt the commencement of the 28th Australian Parliament, the Opposition declined to put forward a nomination for the office of Speaker. We did so as a reflection of our confidence in the office of the Speakership and the precedents established by successive incumbents of that office in this Parliament. The Opposition parties today nominate the honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles) for 2 reasons. The first reason is his long and distinguished record in this House and his personal qualities which make him eminently fitted for the Speakership of this House. Secondly, Mr Clerk, we believe that the principles of impartiality and fairness have not been upheld since the commencement of the Twenty-eighth Parliament under the Speakership of the honourable member for Sydney whose nomination for Speaker of this new Parliament is now before us.\n\nMay I say that the nomination of a member for the position of Speaker was not a matter on which members on the Government benches were unanimous. This fact must reflect the concern that a number of members of the Government Party have as regards the qualifications of the nominee now proposed.\n\nThe honourable member for Angas was first elected to this House in 1964, having previously served 5 years in the Parliament of South Australia. Since that time, he has been re-elected at successive general elections in 1966, 1969, 1972 and 1974. Mr Clerk, he has given distinguished service to committees of the Parliament and on Australian parliamentary delegations in South East Asia, Europe and the United States of America. He is a former Deputy Opposition Whip and he carried out the requirements of that office in an exemplary fashion.\n\nMr Philip Laundy, an authoritative writer on the role of Speaker in Parliament has said:\n\nIt is parliamentary rather than legal experience which is the first requirement of a Speaker. The Speaker must have an intimate understanding of parliamentary life, of the problems of Members collectively and individually, of the moods and foibles of the House. This is an experience which can be acquired only from many years spent on the benches of the House itself. He must have a deep seated reverence for the institution of Parliament, an under-, standing of what lies behind the outward ceremony and a faith in democratic government.\n\nThe writer goes on to describe those inimitable qualities which must grace the incumbent of the speakership of a great national Parliament such as this. Integrity, judgment, common sense, patience, tact, a sense of humour, presence of mind, and firmness tempered with kindliness are the qualities, in addition to impartiality, which are required. I put to the House today that these qualities are held in ample measures by the honourable member for Angas. We believe that the interests of this Parliament demand a return to the impartiality and dignity of the speakership exhibited by successive previous holders of this office. The honourable member for Angas has the unanimous support of members of the Opposition parties. I commend that nomination to the House.\n\nMr CROSS:\n\nBrisbane\n\n- Mr Clerk, as the seconder of Mr Cope’s nomination I wish to speak in support of that nomination. Mr Cope, the honourable Member for Sydney, was the Speaker of this House in the last Parliament during which time he showed those qualities of impartiality and fairness to which the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Lynch) referred. The honourable member for Sydney is a man of wide parliamentary experience. He was elected to this House in 1955 as the member for Cook. On the abolition of that seat through redistribution he served as the member for Watson and again, following a further redistribution, as the member for Sydney. The Speaker, of course, not only presides over the debates in this House but also is associated, in conjunction with the Clerk, in the management of all other affairs of the House and of the Joint House Department which call for his day to day action.\n\nI think that honourable members would all agree that Mr Speaker Cope has been a very approachable person and has been assiduous in his attention to his duties. For 2 parliaments prior to his election to the high office of Speaker at the start of the last Parliament Mr Cope was a Deputy Chairman of Committees. If one looks at his record in the Parliamentary Handbook one finds reference to his attendance at conferences of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, the Inter-Parliamentary Union and parliamentary delegations to South East Asia, East Asia, and elsewhere. Attached to his experience is also an experience in local government. I think that members of this House in their wisdom will agree that these qualities well fit the honourable member for Sydney to discharge this high and important office.\n\nThe point was made that there was a ballot .within the Government party for the position of Speaker. That reflects the democratic tradition of the Australian Labor Party and is a departure from the authoritarian system in force on the other side. Mr Cope in his words and deeds in the former Parliament showed his respect for that democratic tradition. I ask the House to uphold that tradition by supporting his candidature.\n\nMr SINCLAIR:\n\nNew England\n\n– On behalf of members of the Australian Country Party I would like to join with the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party in saying that we believe that the honourable member for Angas has qualities which we see as eminently suiting him for the occupancy of the position of Speaker in this chamber. We are concerned at the fact that it is necessary, as we see it, for the Opposition parties to put up a nominee for this position. Honourable members who were here in the last Parliament will recall that after the December 1972 election the position of Speaker was not contested.\n\nBut on this occasion the qualities which my colleague the honourable member for Flinders has expressed as being necessary in the person who is the Speaker in this chamber have been demonstrated to be lacking in many instances in him who is the Labor Government’s nominee. It is interesting that within the Labor Party Caucus obviously many felt that they did not have confidence in the honourable member for Sydney. The voting within Caucus was remarkably close. Of course, not only one person contested that position; there were a number of persons, all of whom obviously believed, as they offered themselves as candidates for election as Speaker, that either they had better qualities or that the man who is the nominee of the Government is unsuited to hold the position of Speaker. So today we have the farcical representation of apparently unanimous support from Government supporters for the honourable member for Sydney.\n\nMr Snedden:\n\n– It will be interesting to see whether he has it.\n\nMr SINCLAIR:\n\n– As my Leader says, it will be interesting to see whether he has it. As Speaker the honourable member for Sydney was responsible for putting out of this chamber more honourable members than any previous Labor Government Speaker. That of itself demonstrates his incapacity to hold the position for which he has been nominated today. But, Mr Clerk, in addition - I know that the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) has some responsibility for this - as Speaker, Mr Cope has let through more guillotine motions than any previous Speaker. In other words the man who is charged with the responsibility of custodian of parliamentary practice in this place has permitted that practice to be distorted and abbreviated in a manner which is. totally unacceptable to the normal practice of parliamentary democracy.\n\nIn contrast the honourable member for Angas is a person eminently suited to exercise the wise and valid judgment which we believe is necessary in a Speaker in this chamber. He is a man with long experience in parliamentary procedures not only in the Federal Parliament but also in a State parliament. He is a man who in his attendance to the duties of Deputy Whip on our side of the Parliament, both in government and in opposition, has demonstrated a capacity to participate in parliamentary debate which puts him in a position of considerable distinction among all honourable members from both sides of the chamber. Finally, in relation to the honourable member for Angas, I refer to some qualities which Mr Philip Laundy in “The Office of Speaker’ states as being necessary in the occupant of that office. He states:\n\nThere are many times when the good Speaker deems it judicious to turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to a breach of discipline, as when an impetuous remark is made in a flash of anger without being deliberately calculated to offend. He will not invoke the letter of the law at every opportunity. He will avoid a rigid application of the Standing Orders and will not allow an over-technical interpretation of the rules of procedure to restrict debate.\n\nMr Clerk, those qualities are present in the honourable member for Angas. Regrettably they are not present in the honourable member for Sydney. I therefore have much pleasure in seconding the nomination of Mr Giles as Speaker of this chamber.\n\nMr SCHOLES:\n\nCorio\n\n– The position of Speaker of this House as of the presiding officer in the other place, where Senator O’Byrne has just been elected President, is one of great difficulty and one which requires experience in chairmanship and in Parliament. Both these facts have been stated before by other speakers. Mr Cope has been a member of this Parliament since 1954. He is a very experienced chairman within this Parliament. During the past 18 months he has occupied the chair during a very difficult period in the life of this Parliament. Many of these difficulties have been created by the fact that certain members of the Opposition have found it very difficult to live with Standing Orders which they imposed on this House in order to give Ministers certain privileges in the House. It has now become apparent to them that life in Opposition is not the same as it was in Government. The Standing Orders have not been altered by this Government. The persons who framed Standing Orders to give privileges to Ministers have found that the frustrations of Opposition, which they did not expect to experience, are not in the best interests of the Parliament. The Speaker has presided in this Parliament during periods or organised and deliberate obstruction. The fact that so few honourable members were suspended from the service of this House is a tribute to the Speaker’s tolerance.\n\nHonourable members opposite have made much of the fact that some honourable members on this side of the House also sought the nomination for the position of Speaker and contested a ballot. One of the things that we on this side of the House are entitled to do is to choose the people who will represent us in the Ministry and the people who will stand for those offices in the Parliament for which they are elected by the members of the Parliament. No honourable member opposite has said whether a ballot was conducted to decide who would be the Opposition’s nominee for Speaker or whether he is the nominee of the Leader of the Opposition, who holds a dictatorial position in nominating all those honourable members who will hold office within his Party.\n\nWith the exception of the Prime Minister and the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, every member of the Australian Labor Party who stood for office was opposed for the office for which he was a candidate. Members are entitled to stand for election to an office. It would be surprising indeed if members forwent the opportunity to contest that position in this House. A number of honourable members did that. The fact is that when the votes were counted Mr Cope was the winner, and he won quite comfortably. I think that that is the important fact. When people are excluded from running for office that means that a party does not have enough confidence in its parliamentary members to allow them to choose the people who will sit on its front bench and not enough confidence in the party. To suggest that because they propose a ‘unanimous’ nominee of their Leader, that means that that person is the unanimous choice of their Party is, I would say, utter nonsense.\n\nI can see on the other side of the House honourable members of both Opposition Parties who are far more experienced than the present nominee for the Chair and who have far better qualities - known qualities, and I do not challenge the qualities of the honourable member for Angas - of chairmanship, tolerance and experience in this House than has the Opposition’s nominee. Had the Opposition seriously sought this position and seriously sought to put forward a person as Speaker it would have chosen a person who is known to have both those, skills and not a person who has never sat in the chair of this chamber even as a Deputy Chairman. I support the nomination of Mr Cope for Speaker. I believe that this House will serve itself ill if it does not support that nomination.\n\nMr KILLEN:\n\nMoreton\n\n– I have no wish to hurt the feelings, as yet, of any honourable gentleman on the Government side, but I am bound to say to them, on behalf of the Opposition, that the Opposition cannot concede that the honourable member for Sydney is a latter day Solomon. One has only to look at his performance in the last Parliament and the manner in which the honourable gentleman summarily removed from our presence on a number of occasions members of the Opposition who had given but scant cause for offence. I can recall vividly the impeccable behaviour of my friend, the honourable member for Mackellar. He is possessed of no more than a very gentle spirit that seeks to express a point of view, and on several occasions that led to the honourable gentleman being removed from this place in a manner which hurt the feelings of us all. Also dealt with in this way was the honourable member for Barker. Who will forget the injured, the pained, look on the face of my friend, the honourable member for Barker, as he left the chamber? Another was the honourable member for Wannon.\n\nMr Lynch:\n\n– What about the honourable member for Flinders?\n\nMr KILLEN:\n\n– And the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Lynch). It is a quartet.\n\nMr Nixon:\n\n– And the honourable member for Gippsland.\n\nMr KILLEN:\n\n– And the honourable member for Gippsland. It rolls on. It is the role of melancholy behaviour; that is the only way to describe it. All of these honourable gentlemen have brought to the conduct of this Parliament a quiet, firm, insistent dignity. Another honourable member who was suspended was the honourable member for Kennedy. One only has to look at the countenance of the honourable member for Kennedy to realise that he is almost in a state of grace. Imagine him giving offence. Yet the honourable member for Sydney named him. It would hurt me, it would pain me, if I were to detail all of the blemishes that we have apprehended on the part of the honourable member for Sydney. Indeed, that would detain us in this place beyond the point of forbearance.\n\nOn the other hand, we come to the splendid, lively qualities of the honourable member for Angas. He, in his own way, has brought to this Parliament a great feel for the parliamentary institution. He brings to parliamentary activity a quiet, insinuating sense of humour, but beyond that he brings to the Parliament a very profound understanding of what Parliament is all about. This is the judgment which will be made by all honourable members. Having regard to the massive sense of impartiality that pervades the Government side, I am quite sure that a number of honourable members on that side will join the Opposition when the vote is taken.\n\nMr DALY:\n\nMinister for Services and Property and Leader of the House · Grayndler · ALP\n\n– I support the nomination of the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Cope) for the reasons that have been stated by the honourable members who proposed, seconded and supported his nomination. Undoubtedly, he is one of the outstanding Speakers that this Parliament has produced. I was interested today to hear the Deputy Leader of the Opposition go back to 1377, to the time of the choice of the first Speaker. He said that the honourable member for Angas is eminently fitted for the task of being Speaker. He said that the honourable member for Angas has judgment, tolerance, understanding and all those other abilities which are so necessary. He may have them but they are extremely well hidden. The honourable member evidently was not good enough to be promoted to the position of Whip, but the Opposition has decided that he should be the speaker. The honourable member for Lilley said in this Parliament on one occasion that he would not accept the lowly position of Deputy Whip if he had to serve under a former Prime Minister. This is the lowly position from which the honourable member from Angas has come. Now the Opposition seeks to put him in the exalted position of presiding over this House with all the tolerance, understanding and knowledge that are necessary. It would be almost ludicrous if it were not so serious.\n\nWho seconded the nomination of the honourable member for Angas? It was the most obstreperous member of the Parliament, the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party. He has broken more rules than anybody knows. He works under Rafferty’s rules exclusively and wonders why the Speaker calls him to order. I wonder whether a deal has been made. I wonder whether he will be allowed full rein should the honourable member for Angas be put in the position of\n\nSpeaker. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition blamed the honourable member for Sydney for using the guillotine. Last session I was the one who was blamed. I congratulate the honourable member on his change of front, because it shows that he was not aware of all the facts. When I heard the honourable member for Morton defending the conduct of the honourable member for Mackellar when supporting the appointment of the honourable member for Angas as against the honourable member for Sydney, I thought we had reached the very heights.\n\nAs honourable members know, the fact of the matter is that those honourable members who have been defended today - the honourable member for Sydney who is about to be appointed as Speaker of this chamber knows this - undoubtedly were the ones who caused him the most trouble in the last Parliament. Yet today they are the sponsors of the nominee whom they want to take his place. Let me remind the House that when the honourable member for Sydney was appointed as Speaker on 27 February 1973 he was appointed unanimously. He received congratulations and good wishes from members from both sides of the House, from the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country Party. The Leader of the Opposition, who will find out shortly that he lost the election - I repeat it; and in another place they reckon that is right, too - said on the occasion of the honourable member for Sydney being elected as Mr Speaker:\n\nWe know that you have served long in this Parliament; we know that you know the volatility of this House; we know your own periodic bad temper; and we know your ever ready flow of wit.\n\nWhat a compliment from the Leader of the Opposition. He went on to say:\n\nWe on this side of the House will co-operate. We will not interject while you are speaking, provided that you do not speak for too long. We will be courteous at all times . . .\n\nThe Leader of the Country Party said on that occasion:\n\nI congratulate you on your unanimous election to the position of the supreme office bearer of the House of Representatives … In the period in which you were a private member of the House of Representatives, members of the Country Party who were members of those earlier Parliaments knew you and liked you as a person.\n\nWhy has there been this change of front? The Leader of the Country Party continued:\n\nThey believed that you were a man of honour. We believe that you can fulfil the role that has been cast\n\nThese are the types of things that honourable members opposite said. Let me say to the honourable member for Sydney - Mr Speakerelect - that you possess that rare quality, so valuable in your exalted position in this House as Speaker, of being able to divorce politics from the duties and responsibilities of that onerous office. You are unbiased and impartial, and I feel that in every way you will continue your illustrious career in that office following, as you say you do, the examples of previous Speakers appointed over the last 27 years by those opposite.\n\nI feel that no comparison at all can be made between the qualities of the honourable members seeking this position. I commend Mr Cope to the House, and I base that commendation, amongst other things, on his experience and the knowledge and the dignity with which he carried out those tasks previously. He received commendations from honourable members opposite until they decided that they would not obey the rules of this place and you had to take appropriate action. The record of the Opposition in the last Parliament was one ofwhich it could not be proud. Several members from that side of the chamber were suspended from time to time because of misconduct. Not one honourable member on this side had occasion to be called to order. Therefore I suggest that the honourable member for Sydney is the one to occupy the office of Mr Speaker.\n\nMr WENTWORTH:\n\nMackellar\n\n– In some ways we have departed from the practices followed by the House of Commons, and in one way which is relevant I am not certain that the Australian Parliament has acted wisely.\n\nIt has been the custom in this Parliament for a speaker to be elected from the Government side. In the House of Commons the Speaker is believed to stand and generally does stand above the political maelstrom. I think there is a case to be made out for having a Speaker who is not elected from the Government side. In this respect perhaps we might return to the traditional wisdom of the House of Commons and adopt what has not been the Australian parliamentary practice but what does seem to be the practice in other parts of the world.\n\nIt is very invidious for a Speaker who is elected from the Government side and is be\n\nThe Speaker had invidious duties to perform in the past Parliament. When the verisimilitude of the Prime Minister was called into question and when we knew that the Prime Minister had been deliberately making false statements to this House, it was quite invidious to ask the Speaker, who came from the Government side, to bring the honourable gentleman to order. He had to defend the Prime Minister against charges of lying and use his position as Speaker in order to do\n\n**Mr Speaker** 9 July 1974 REPRESENTATIVES 11 {: #subdebate-6-0-s9 .speaker-JSU} ##### Mr BRYANT:\n\nMinister for the Capital Territory · Wills · ALP -- Honourable members from the other side told us earlier that the honourable member for Angas **(Mr Giles)** had been chosen unanimously as candidate for the Speakership of this House. Our friend, the honourable member for Mackellar **(Mr Wentworth)** has just spilled the beans: The honourable member for Angas was not chosen unanimously. We have heard a fine series of orations this morning from our friends opposite. I was not surpirsed at the tone of them because I understand that the honourable member for Angas is a noted breeder of bulls. We are here this morning to choose the man - or perhaps the woman - to preside over this House. Our friends opposite have chosen to place before us the bright product of an authoritarian system and I simply rise this morning to remind my colleagues of the parliamentary record of the honourable member for Angas. While he was Deputy Whip of the Government parties he used the guillotine and applied the gag more than anybody else in history could have done. I suggest that honourable members do as I have done and just take at random one series of the Hansard record for 1972, the last period in which the honourable member for Angas held that high and exalted office. My copy of Hansard fell open at page 2833 of 18 May, where it states: >Motion (by **Mr Giles)** put: > >That the question be now put. A flick through the pages will reveal the record of the honourable member for Angas for everybody to see. Honourable members can try it for themselves. They will see how the debate stops and is followed by lists of members voting. Let me quote from page 3005 of 24 May 1972. This was not just a weekly aberration; those who were here in 1972 will remember that it was almost an hourly aberration. This particular action was a sin of great magnitude. The Hansard record states: {: #subdebate-6-0-s10 .speaker-JSU} ##### Mr BRYANT:\n\nWills · ALP **- 'Mr Deputy Speaker-** Motion (by **Mr Giles)** agreed to: That the question be now put. {: #subdebate-6-0-s11 .speaker-K5O} ##### Mr CORBETT:\n\nMaranoa -- It is interesting to hear the treatise of the Minister for the Capital Territory **(Mr Bryant),** who just sat down, and who has a record of defying parliamentary procedure by not leaving the House when he was suspended. This is the man who got up as the great proponent of the rights of the honourable members of this House. Although suspended he sat in his place with Australian Labor Party members around him. He would not go. He would not abide by the orders of the House until the Speaker had to suspend the sitting. That is the record of the Minister for the Capital Territory. So he certainly should not be speaking about who is to be the Speaker in this House when hehimself will not obey the Speaker. As my friend the honourable member for Mackellar **(Mr Wentworth)** asked: How much notice can one take of the Minister for Services and Property **(Mr Daly)** when he has said in this House that honourable members of the Australian Country Party have never been elected on the first ballot? It was proved to him that they have been. My friend said that the Minister tried to change Hansard, but in any case the Minister has never withdrawn that allegation and it still stands to his discredit. Those 2 Ministers are the people who are backing the Government nominee. How much 12 REPRESENTATIVES 9 July 1974 **Mr Speaker** notice can be taken of them? How much worse they are by comparison with the honourable member for Angas who has done his duty as Deputy Whip of his Party and has done it well. There are times, as everyone in this House would know, when the gag has to be moved, and it is moved by the Deputy Whip on so many occasions. To accuse the honourable member for Angas of being unfair because he did something which is generally accepted and which was necessary on occasions is unfair in the extreme. I think that the Minister for Services and Property said that the Government's nominee was the most outstanding Speaker. I think that he was just slightly out. He should have said that he was the most out-sending Speaker because he sent so many people out of this Parliament in the course of his time as Speaker. On at least one occasion he did not give a warning. I believe that to be tolerant and impartial a Speaker should give a warning to an honourable member before he is suspended unless the honourable member is acting completely irresponsibly in the circumstances. That did not apply on the occasion I have in mind. So there are reasons why we on this side of the House are nominating the honourable member for Angas, who we feel is eminently suited to fill this very responsible and honourable position. The fact that the Opposition did not nominate someone on the last occasion is not any indication that we, after having served in the previous Parliament under the previous Speaker, should not now nominate someone if we are not satisfied with the impartiality of the Speaker of the last Parliament. That is our right. That is our duty if we feel that it is necessary and I believe that in the nomination of the honourable member for Angas we have chosen someone who would be impartial and who would be able to fulfil the responsible position of Speaker of this House with credit to himself and to the great advantage of this Parliament. I have very much pleasure in supporting the nomination of the honourable member for Angas. {: .speaker-10000} ##### The Clerk: -- In accordance with the Standing Orders a ballot will be taken.

When we congratulated you upon your attaining the great office of Speaker, barely 16 months ago, we scarcely thought that we would have the privilege of again electing you and of again congratulating you so shortly thereafter. You have presided over us during a momentous period in Australia's history and a stirring time in the history of this Parliament - a stirring time and, I fear, all too often, a turbulent parliament. You have been well and truly blooded. It may be - who knows - that you may soon have a larger task and that the good order of this chamber may be challenged by an infusion of others less obedient and less decorous. In such an event we look to you with confidence to preserve the same good order as you have preserved and will continue to preserve in our chamber. {: #subdebate-6-0-s14 .speaker-DQF} ##### Mr SNEDDEN:\n\nLeader of the Opposition · Bruce -- In 1973, **Mr Speaker,** I congratulated you on your unanimous appointment by this House as its speaker. At that time, I told you that we had no experience of you as a Speaker but that we admired you as a man and admired your characteristics as a man. We felt confident at that time that you would conduct the Chair in a manner which was suitable to the best traditions of Parliament. {: .speaker-SH4} ##### Dr Klugman: -- The last time you were right! {: .speaker-10000} ##### Mr SPEAKER: -- Interjections are out of order. I call the Leader of the Opposition. {: .speaker-DQF} ##### Mr SNEDDEN: -- We have now had experience of you, **Mr Speaker.** I must say to you that we would hope that in this coming parliamentary period you will be able to see that this is a volatile place, that people, on occasion, will want to defend their rights as strongly as they know how, and that you, **Mr Speaker,** have a responsibility to ensure that every member of this House has his rights assured through your agency. We look forward to your doing that. You must accept that when, in our judgment, you fail to do so we will draw your attention to it. We will use whatever means we can to redress any errors that we believe you have made in the interests of maintaining the freedom of action of the members on this side of the House. Having said that, **Mr Speaker,** I congratulate you on your return to office. It was said earlier today that there may be errors in the practice of this Parliament of selecting its Speaker from the majority of the House. I share that view. I would like to see the position of Speaker become superior to Party politics and a situation where a member with a safe seat occupying that Chair can continue uncontested and remain Speaker. That is not for tomorrow but it must be for the future if this Parliament is to have the dignity that it ought to have. I want to put that on record. The other thing that I say to you, **Mr Speaker** - I am sure you will accept it in the spirit in which it is said - is that I do hope you will be able to say that magical word 'order' with a slightly different intonation. {: .speaker-10000} ##### Mr SPEAKER: -- I say it every morning before breakfast. {: .speaker-DQF} ##### Mr SNEDDEN: -- It is good to know you practice it, **Mr Speaker.** I hope that when you do use the word 'order', as you must, you will apply it just as readily to members on the Government side of the House as to members on this side of the House. We will cooperate with you, and what we want from you, **Mr Speaker,** is your co-operation with and understanding of us and our role in this Parliament which we are determined to play and which we will play. {: #subdebate-6-0-s15 .speaker-BU4} ##### Mr ANTHONY:\n\nLeader of the Australian Country Party · Richmond -- **Mr Speaker,** on behalf of my Party I congratulate you on being re-elected to this august position, the supreme position in this House. Members of my Party along with all other members recognise the importance of maintaining law and order in this Parliament so that the proper procedures can be carried out. When you were first elected, I congratulated you. I made personal remarks about you as a person whom we liked and respected and who had a great sense of humour. I do not deviate from those remarks. It is a genuine feeling of my Party that we have a very likeable person as Speaker. I believe that you, **Mr Speaker,** have the qualities and the attributes to make a very talented Speaker of this Parliament. However, the experience of the previous 18 months did see a few lapses in your impartiality and those lapses caused considerable concern. It was this concern that caused the Opposition parties to contest the position today. You have won it, and we respect the fact that you now hold this very important position. The volatile reaction of the Opposition during the last Parliament was brought about largely by the provocative actions of the Leader of the House **(Mr Daly).** I know that it was difficult for you to give a ruling that did not discriminate against a Party colleague. There were also occasions when we felt that you had been influenced in your ruling by a previous disposition towards the Prime Minister **(Mr Whitlam),** your Party leader. We understand that Party loyalty is a necessary quality in one, but there must be no bias whatsoever in the Speaker. Provided that you can dispense rulings from that chair with completejustice and with complete impartiality you will have the complete support of the Opposition parties. I hope that there will be no occasion on which you will have to use a heavy hand against members of the Opposition. But if we see a repetition of the incidents that were created by the Leader of the House I can well imagine that there will be stirrings in our ranks and that you will find yourself in a difficult position. I hope that does not happen because the Opposition wants to see this House maintained in an orderly manner. I say again: Congratulations and best wishes in carrying out what is a very onerous and important position. {: .speaker-10000} ##### Mr SPEAKER: -- I should like to thank the Prime Minister **(Mr Whitlam),** the Leader of the Opposition **(Mr Snedden)** and the Leader of the Australian Country Party **(Mr Anthony)** for their words of eulogy and for their constructive criticism. I was the Speaker of this House for approximately 14 or 15 months during which time I served an apprenticeship. I think that I have learnt quite a lot from it. I hope to improve as all honourable members would hope to improve. That would apply even to the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. There is always room for improvement. When I was elected to the position of Speaker in the last Parliament it was my aim to emulate the deeds of **Sir John** McLeay and **Sir William** Aston, who were my two immediate predecessors and who I believe carried out their duties in an impartial manner. At times they were faced with the same problems as I was faced with in the last Parliament, although I will admit not quite so many. If the honourable members would like to go through Hansard and check the rulings of the two gentlemen I have just mentioned they would see that my rulings are in conformity with the rulings made by them. So before any destructive criticism is made about some of my rulings I ask honourable members to peruse Hansard to see the rulings that were made by my predecessors. Again I would like to say thanks very much to the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country Party for their words of eulogy and congratulation. {: .page-start } page 15 {:#debate-7} ### PRESENTATION TO GOVERNOR-GENERAL {: #debate-7-s0 .speaker-6U4} ##### Mr WHITLAM:\n\nPrime Minister · Werriwa · ALP -- I have ascertained that it will be His Excellency's pleasure to receive the Speaker in the Library of the Parliament this day at 2.42 p.m. {: #debate-7-s1 .speaker-10000} ##### Mr SPEAKER: -- Prior to my presentation to His Excellency the Governor-General this afternoon, the bells will ring for 3 minutes so that honourable members may attend in the chamber and accompany the Speaker to the Library, when they may, if they so wish, be introduced to His Excellency.

The Speech will be included in Hansard for record purposes. (The Speech read as follows) - Senators and Members of the House of Representatives: In the elections for both Houses of Parliament on 18 May 1974, the people of Australia confirmed their decision of 2 December 1972. In preparing legislation for the 29th Parliament, my advisers have taken .the view that the first responsibility of the Government is to carry out, fully and promptly, the program for change twice endorsed by the Australian people. Developments at home and abroad have created new and, in some respects, difficult economic conditions. My advisers 'believe that this in no way lessens the obligations imposed on the Australian Government to continue and complete its program but rather heightens the sense of responsibility and challenge which it should bring during the next three years to the task of leading Australia in a time of rapid change throughout the world. The legislative burden of the session must necessarily be extremely heavy. There are certain legislative provisions which lapsed at the end of June and which should have been reenacted before then. There are agreements with the States and rural assistance programs which should have been enacted before the end of June. These measures must receive prompt attention. Further, the Government will again submit important measures put forward in fulfilment of undertakings given to the electors in 1972 and repeated by the Prime Minister during the May elections. These measures include the six Bills which were twice rejected by the Senate and whose Parliamentary history provided the grounds upon which I granted a dissolution of both Houses on 11 April. Those Bills provide for electoral reform, for Senate representation of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, for the implementation of the Government's undertakings on health insurance and for a Petroleum and Minerals Authority. My Government will proceed immediately with these Bills. My Government will continue vigorous efforts against inflation. Despite the world-wide nature of this problem, the Government is confident that its measures can protect the Australian economy and the Australian people from the most harmful economic and social effects of inflation. If this is to be achieved, however, it will call for restraint and responsibility on the part of all sections of the community. My Government acknowledges its duty to provide leadership in this direction. In determining priorities and in carrying out its program while continuing the fight against inflation, my Government will be guided by certain principles. These are: protection for the weaker sections of the community; a firm, commitment to the principle of full employment; equity in sharing sacrifices as well as prosperity; and the need to ensure that any deferment of expectations shall not be made at the expense of those for whom deferment could mean a lifetime of deprivation - for example, children at school and migrants. The Government will continue its measures to strengthen and modernise the Australian economy, to improve the quality of the Australian workforce, to expand Australian resources and to promote Australian control over those resources. The Government will amend the Prices Justification Act to strengthen the Prices Justification Tribunal and make its operations more effective. The Trade Practices Bill will be re-introduced to strengthen control of restrictive trade practices and to protect customers from unfair practices. Further steps will be taken to promote customer protection. There will be legislation for a Securities and Exchange Commission and a National Companies Act to achieve uniformity. The Government intends to re-introduce legislation to examine and, where needed, regulate activities of non-banking financial corporations. The Government will establish an Australian Government Insurance Office which will compete actively in all forms of insurance and which, in particular, will provide the widest possible cover for homes at the lowest possible premiums. The recommendations of the Committee on Taxation under the chairmanship of **Mr Justice** Asprey will toe taken into account in this year's Budget when my Government will give urgent consideration to the restructuring of the taxation system. The Government intends to extend the provisions of the income taxation laws governing deductions for dependants to provide that migrants maintaining dependant relatives oversesas shall be entitled to the taxation advantages which are already available to those maintaining dependant relatives in Australia. . A Relief Board will be set up to consider requests for relief from estate duty on grounds of serious hardship. Provision is to be made for exemptions of the matrimonial home from estate duty. The home-building industry remains overstretched despite efforts by my Government to bring about a moderate abatement in the level of activity. The Government will continue to maintain the closest watch on the position, but until balance is restored between demand and supply of resources, existing restraints must be maintained. The Government is determined to provide adequate finance for an expansion in welfare housing which has suffered severely because of inflationary conditions. This will be done as soon as circumstances permit. The Housing Agreement will be amended to permit a higher proportion of funds to be .allocated to the Home Builders' Account. Most Australian home owners and home buyers will receive relief from their interest repayment burdens through the provision of tax deductibility for mortgage interest repayments. Further measures will be taken to achieve sound industrial and resource development with the maximum Australian ownership and control. They will include reintroduction of legislation to expand the activities of the Australian Industry Development Corporation and to establish a national investment fund. The Petroleum and Minerals Authority will participate in the search for resources, assist Australian interests previously relying on foreign companies for development and progressively reduce foreign ownership and control of Australia's resources. To intensify surveillance of foreign investment, new legislation will be introduced to replace the Companies (Foreign Take-Overs) Act. A Structural Adjustment Board will be set up to supervise assistance for firms and individuals adversely affected by the Government's program of structural change in industry, in cluding the reduction of tariffs and the removal of subsidies. The Government is committed to the development of a coherent manpower policy to achieve the best possible use of the national workforce in social, economic and human terms. The reports of the Kangan Committee on Technical and Further Education and the Cochrane Committee on Adult Training and Retraining provide a valuable basis for the development of an integrated manpower strategy for Australia. There will be a Technical and Further Education Commission. Existing training schemes will be amalgamated into a single national employment and training program. Amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act will be again introduced: to ensure effective observance by all parties to industrial agreements; to promote amalgamation of industrial organisations; and to rectify the problems created by conflicting and unco-ordinated Federal and State industrial laws, and urgently brought to the attention of the Australian, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australian and Western Australian Governments by the Australian Industrial Court as far back as February 1969. My Government is keenly aware of its responsibilities as Australia's largest employer. A Royal Commission has been appointed to inquire into the Australian Public Service. My Government has accepted the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Post Office to establish an Australian Postal Commission and an Australian Telecommunications Commission (incorporating the Overseas Telecommunications Commission) and to give them control over the conditions of employment of their staffs. In recognition of the need for restraint on the growth of government spending, in the present inflationary situation, a ceiling of 2.6 per cent has been imposed on the growth of the Public Service and Government Authorities. The Australian Government seeks similar restraint on the part of State Governments. Among measures to assist the States to carry out their responsibilities, the Financial Agreement will be amended to provide for the formal take over of SI, 000m of State debts and an interest-free, non-repayable capital grant of almost $3 00m will be provided for the States' works program. Australia's sound overseas trading position is to be further enhanced by legislation: to establish an export bank; to expand the overseas investment insurance scheme; and to revise the export incentive scheme for the next five years of its operation. The Government will continue to negotiate trade agreements to provide a firm and enduring basis for increased trade with other countries. . The Government recognises the fundamental importance of the farm sector to Australia's trade and to the prosperity of the whole Australian community. The report of the working group on rural policy will greatly assist the Government, the Parliament, the Australian Department of Agriculture and the community in establishing the principles which should be adopted towards a sound rural policy for Australia. Important measures on matters affecting the farm sector will cover the new wheat stabilisation plan, financial support for wool research and promotion, adjustment assistance and marketing arrangements for the dairying industry, continuing financial assistance for major water projects in Queensland and for beef roads in Queensland and Western Australia. In co-operation with the Governments of Queensland and Western Australia, the Government will press ahead with studies of the potential of important regions in northern Australia, including the Burdekin and Bowen Basin, north-western Queensland and the Pilbara and the Kimberley regions. An Australian Science Council will be established to assist the Government, the Parliament and the community to develop a coherent national role for science and technology in our modern society. Better transport is needed for the efficient development and use of Australia's resources. The Government proposes to legislate this year for the re-establishment of the Inter-State Commission. The Commission will play a major part in the reform and co-ordination of our national transport. Legislation will be introduced on the Australian National Railways and to ratify agree ments with the States for the construction of new railway lines to Alice Springs and Adelaide and, subject to completion of the agreement, for a new urban railway line radiating from Parramatta. The Government will introduce legislation for a new Roads Assistance Scheme to provide assistance to the States over the next three years. The Australian Government will in future take responsibility for constructing and maintaining a national roads system in those areas which fall within the Government's own constitutional responsibility. It is proposed to legislate for a national authority on road safety and standards. The Government intends to introduce legislation for a rationalised system of road and urban transport assistance to the States. The Government will introduce legislation to ratify agreements with all State Governments for the provision of financial assistance for selected urban public transport projects. Participation by the national Government for the first time in Australia's history in the modernisation and reconstruction of the urban transport systems is an essential part of the participation by my Government in the modernisation and reconstruction of Australia's cities. Within the broad sweep of national priorities, my Government is determined to continue its commitments to rebuild our existing cities and to build new ones so that there will be more equal opportunities for all Australians wherever they choose to live or are obliged to live. My Government will promote these opportunities by continuing commitments to develop Land Commissions and new growth centres, the national sewerage program, area improvement programs, environment impact studies, and through the constant monitoring of resource allocation within our great urban areas. Parliament will be asked to approve legislation and administrative decisions reflecting the Government's view of the significance of the Australian Capital Territory as an area for initiatives in urban affairs and public participation in community affairs. Arising from the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate, my Government proposes to establish an Australian Heritage Commission. Legislation will be introduced to establish a National Parks and Wildlife Service. My Government regards the Great Barrier Reef as a precious part not only of Australia's heritage but of the world's heritage. The Great Barrier Reef will be reserved as a marine park. Legislation will be introduced to implement the Government's policy of ensuring that needs of the environment and the views of the public are fully considered in governmental decisions particularly in relation to projects under the control of, or funded by, the Australian Government. The Government is continuing to develop, in co-operation with the State Governments, an organisation to deal with natural disasters. The legislative program and the administrative decisions of the Australian Government represent the most concerted effort in Australia's history to promote, protect and preserve Australia's resources and to use those resources for the greatest benefit of all Australians. The primacy the Australian Government gives to our most precious resource - our children - remains undiminished. This finds special expression in the national Government's involvement in education. A major initiative in education during this Parliament will be the development and implementation of programs for the care and education of pre-school children. An Inquiry will be made into the place of the languages of major migrant groups in the school curriculum. Legislation will be introduced to establish a Curriculum Development Centre. During this Parliament the Government will be considering the Universities Commission's Report on Open Tertiary Education and the development of appropriate measures in this area. An Academic Salaries Tribunal will be established. My Government will continue its reconstruction of Australia's social security system. The National Rehabilitation and Compensation Committee under the chairmanship of **Mr Justice** Woodhouse of the New Zealand Court of Appeal has completed its report and it is now under consideration. An interim report of the National Superannuation Committee of Inquiry is also being studied. The next Budget will make further increases in social security and repatriation pension rates and take the next step in the abolition of the means test. It will also provide for increased assistance for the handicapped and disabled, further assistance for organisations conducting aged persons' homes and nursing homes and help for the homeless. Under new legislation, funds will be available through the Australian Assistance Plan for every region in Australia. The Government will continue to improve the health care of Australians in keeping with its constitutional responsibilities to provide hospital benefits and medical services. In addition to the two Health Insurance Bills twice rejected by the Senate during the 28th Parliament, a Bill will be introduced to regulate private health insurance associated with the Universal Health Insurance program. The Community Health Program will be further expanded. High priority will be given to a full examination of the Report on Hospitals prepared by the Hospitals and Health Services Commission. The Australian Government must play a greater role in the planning and organising of hospitals in Australia. If necessary, the Government itself will construct and operate hospitals in areas of need. The Medical Benefits scheme will be extended to cover consultations with optometrists. Legislation will be introduced to establish a Pharmaceutical Corporation to make, market and develop drugs. The Government recognises the link between the basic health and well-being of the Australian community and the opportunities for Australians to make better use of their increasing leisure. The Government will expand its program of grants to sporting and youth organisations and increase its assistance for the creation of community centres and for building of sport, recreation and tourist facilities. Bills will be introduced: to enable the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation to insure loans for tourist accommodation; to license travel agents; to provide financial assistance for tourist development projects through the Commonwealth Development Bank; and to enable the Australian Tourist Commission to undertake domestic tourist promotion. An Australian Film Commission will be established to foster and develop Australian film and television program making. The Broadcasting and Television Act will be amended to place beyond doubt the powers of the Broadcasting Control Board to expand opportunities for Australians to make their own radio and television programs. The introduction of frequency modulation broadcasting will also enhance these opportunities. The introduction of colour television on 1 March 1975 will increase opportunities for the sale of Australian-made programs overseas. The Government will re-introduce the Australia Council Bill and will bring forward legislation to establish the Australian National Gallery and the Australian Archives. Provision will also be made for a public lending right for Australian authors. My Government will submit to the Parliament a number of measures designed to reform the laws under which Australians live and to protect the rights of all Australians under those laws. The Family Law Bill will be re-submitted. The Australian Government is convinced that the High Court of Australia must become the final court in all matters pertaining to Australia and to the legal rights and obligations of its citizens. It will proceed with legislation to abolish appeals to the British Privy Council. Legislation will be re-introduced to create a Superior Court of Australia, a proposal initiated by the previous Government more than a decade ago. Legisation will be introduced to establish the office of Australian Ombudsman, together with Deputy Ombudsmen, having special responsibilities for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, and to establish a Defence Ombudsman. Legislation will be introduced for a Freedom of Information Act to give a right of access by members of the public to official documents, subject to appropriate safeguards. The Government will appoint a judicial inquiry into the security services. The Government proposes to legislate for the disclosure of the sources of funds passing to all Australian political parties and for the limitation of campaign spending by political parties and candidates. The partly nominated Legislative Council for the Northern Territory and Advisory Council for the Capital Territory will be replaced with wholly elected Assemblies. Legislation will be re-introduced to permit Australia to ratify the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which came into force in January 1969. Legislation will also be introduced to supersede certain provisions of the Queensland Aborigines Act and Torres Strait Islanders Act which are contrary to the principles embodied in the Racial Discrimination Convention and in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Australian Government will not allow the overwhelming decision of the Australian people in the referendum of 1967 to be any longer denied or disregarded. My Government has accepted in principle the recommendations contained in the Second Report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission and following consultation with Northern Territory Aboriginals will legislate to give effect to its policy on granting land rights to these Australians. An Aboriginal Land Fund Bill will also be introduced to establish a Commission to operate the program of land purchase for or by Aboriginal communities. By these measures my Government seeks to ensure that there is no inconsistency between the principles it pursues abroad and their practice at home. In its relations with other nations, my Government will consolidate and broaden the new priorities and directions it has given to Australia's, foreign policy since December 1972. It will develop and further diversify its new links in Asia, Africa, the South Pacific and Latin America while maintaining and maturing its traditional associations. Negotiations for the proposed Treaty of Nara - a basic treaty of friendship and cooperation with our major trading partner - are proceeding harmoniously and constructively with the Government of Japan. Regional co-operation, including defence co-operation, will remain a principal objective of my Government's policies, especially in the Asian and Pacific regions. My Government is committed by the clearest pledges to continue substantial aid to a united Papua New Guinea before and after independence. Since Papua New Guinea achieved self-government in December 1973, the relationship between the governments of Australia and of Papua New Guinea has been based on the principles of equality, mutual respect and mutual co-operation. Pending the final decision of the House of Assembly to declare independence for Papua New Guinea, the Australian Government will conduct its relations with the Government of Papua New Guinea as a government of an independent nation to which Australia has certain special and inescapable obligations. The Government will encourage and support measures designed to remove tension amongst all states' and welcomes the moves by the United States and the Soviet Union to stabilise their strategic relationship. It will pursue actively the objective of nuclear disarmament. At the same time it will continue to strengthen Australia's security. Under the direction of the Minister for Defence, my Government is creating the most effective, mobile and professional defence force in Australia's peace-time history: The Services are also being equipped to play a greater role in case of emergencies and natural disasters within Australia. The Parliament will be asked to deal with legislation to complete the amalgamation of the former Service Departments. My Government will strive to ensure that its development aid programs make the highest possible contribution to raising living standards in the developing world. Legislation introduced during the last Parliament for the creation of an Australian Development Assistance Agency will be re-introduced. Australia shall continue to do its best to play the part required by her wealth and prosperity to combat the scourges of hunger, disease, poverty and illiteracy, especially in this region where history and destiny place us. {:#subdebate-15-0} #### Mr President, Senators **Mr Speaker,** Members of the House of Representatives. The Government of Australia in no way seeks to conceal from the Parliament or the people the difficulties and complexities facing Australia at home and abroad in the years ahead. My Government is confident, however, that these can be surmounted, not only through the program I have outlined but by the endeavours of a strong united people and the efforts of a Parliament dedicated to the service of that people. I now leave the Australian Parliament of which I have been a part for a quarter of a century, as a member of the House of Representatives and then as the representative of the Queen of Australia. With a confidence born of long experience that you will fulfil to the utmost of your abilities the deep responsibility the Australian people have placed upon you, I leave you to carry out your high and important duties. {: .page-start } page 22 {:#debate-16} ### ADDRESS-IN-REPLY Motion (by **Mr Whitlam)** agreed to: >That a Committee consisting of **Mr Young, Ms Child** and myself be appointed to prepare an Address-in-Reply to the Speech delivered by His Excellency the Governor-General to both Houses of the Parliament and that the Committee do report at the next sitting. Sitting suspended from 3.54 to 5 p.m. {: .page-start } page 22 {:#debate-17} ### DEATH OF HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS, THE PRINCE HENRY, DUKE OF GLOUCESTER {: #debate-17-s0 .speaker-6U4} ##### Mr WHITLAM:\n\nPrime Minister · Werriwa · ALP -- His Royal Highness, the Prince Henry William Frederick Albert, the eleventh Governor-General of Australia, died on 10 June. Prince Henry was the last surviving child of King George V and Queen Mary. Their youngest son, Prince John, died in 1919. The House of Representatives has passed motions of condolence in 1942 on the death of Prince George, who had been designated as GovernorGeneral and whose wife, elder son and daughter have since made memorable visits to Australia; in 1953 on the death of King George VI, who had opened this Parliament House; in 1965 on the death of the Princess Royal, whose elder son contributes so much to the style and fortunes of the Australian Opera; and in 1972 on the death of the eldest member of the family, King Edward VIII, the most charismatic British prince since Bonny Prince Charlie. Prince Henry was created Duke of Gloucester in 1934. For 6 centuries kings of England have created their sons Dukes of Gloucester. None of them enjoyed the length of life of the prince whom we mourn today. Only one left an heir to succeed him. Thomas of Woodstock, the youngest son of Edward III, was murdered in custody. The good Duke Humphrey, the youngest son of Henry IV, died in custody soon after his mistress and second wife, who had been imprisoned for treachery and witchcraft. Richard III, the youngest brother of Edward IV, was slain at Bosworth in his thirty-third year. Henry, the youngest son of Charles I, scarcely survived the Restoration and lies in the vault of Mary, Queen of Scots, in Westminster Abbey, William, the heir to Princess Anne of Denmark, died a few days after his eleventh birthday. William Henry, the third son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and the first Royal field marshal, was the only Duke of Gloucester to reach his sixties and the first to leave a son, also a field-marshal. How fortunate, by contrast, was the king's son who was created Duke of Gloucester in 1934, who married a direct descendant of Charles II's eldest son, and who leaves a son. His Royal Highness was a professional soldier. He was Chief Liaison Officer with the British Expeditionary Force in France until Dunkirk and was mentioned in despatches. He was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour. In 1955 he became the fifteenth and latest member of the British Royal Family to be appointed a field-marshal. The Prince's associations with Australia extended over 30 years. He represented his father at the one hundredth anniversary of the foundation of Melbourne. Through the happy inspiration of Prime Minister Curtin he served for two years as GovernorGeneral. He represented his family at the fiftieth anniversary of Anzac. The range of occasions on which he represented his father, his brothers and his niece is demonstrated by the knighthoods he received from the Emperors of Ethiopia and Japan, the Queen of the Netherlands, the Kings of the Belgians and of Norway, Denmark and Thailand and the former Kings of the Hellenes and of Romania, Egypt and Iraq. Throughout his long life he snowed a sense of duty worthy of his high station. The following message sent by Prince Henry's present successor as GovernorGeneral to the Queen on the death of her uncle will express, I am sure, the sentiments of honourable members: >On behalf of the people and Government of Australia I offer deep sympathy to your Majesty on the death of his Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester. In Australia he is honoured and remembered with respect and affection as a former Governor-General. We also recall the service he gave and the close links he found with many Australians as a soldier, as Colonel-in-Chief of the Australian Light Horse, and the Royal Australian Army Service Corps, as President of the Royal Humane Society, Scout Association and National Rifle Association, and as Grand Prior of the Order of St John of Jerusalem. The encouragement and example he gave in these and other public duties in which your Australian subjects share, have become part of the noble tradition of the Royal Family in Australia.' I move: {: #debate-17-s1 .speaker-DQF} ##### Mr SNEDDEN:\n\nLeader of the Opposition · Bruce -- The Opposition supports the motion moved by the Prime Minister **(Mr Whitlam).** The Duke of Gloucester was the first and, so far, the only Royal Governor-General of Australia. He was by nature a soldier, having chosen that career, and he devoted himself to that career in a way which is not normally associated with soldierly duties by a member of the Royal Family. In fact, he served in France in 1940. He was there wounded by a bomb explosion. After the war he came to Australia and served, so I am informed, for 25 months as GovernorGeneral of Australia. He made another visit to Australia later on in 1965 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of Anzac. He made a contribution to this country as Governor-General. He will be remembered by the older portion of the community; he will be known of by the younger. He will be remembered with respect for the contribution he made. As Governor-General he travelled in Australia very widely. He had his own aeroplane, which was called 'The Endeavour' after Cook's ship, which is a touching selection of name by a Governor-General of the Royal Family. He may not have had the charisma to which the Prime Minister referred. But amongst all the interesting pieces of history which the Prime Minister has strung together he mentioned Bonnie Prince Charlie. We might add the further bit of information that Bonnie Prince Charlie was a Jacobite who was born in Rome on 31 December 1720 and failed in a rebellion in Scotland in 1745. With those few pieces of disjointed history finding their way into the debate on the motion before this House expressing the condolences of the Australian Parliament and the people of Australia to the survivors of the Duke of Gloucester, and appreciation of the service he has given to Australia as Governor-General, I think it is appropriate that we should all concur in the motion moved by the Prime Minister. {: #debate-17-s2 .speaker-BU4} ##### Mr ANTHONY:\n\nLeader of the Australian Country Party · Richmond -- I would like to join with the Prime Minister **(Mr Whitlam)** and the Leader of the Opposition **(Mr Snedden)** in expressing the sympathy of the Australian Country Party at the death of our only Royal Governor-General. The Prime Minister is forwarding a message to Her Majesty the Queen, and I hope that mention will be made to the Duchess and Prince Richard of the sympathies of the Country Party. Prince Henry, along with the Duchess, carried out loyally his duties as GovernorGeneral during the latter part of the war and in the immediate post-ward period. He is remembered for his very exhaustive programs of meeting the Australian people. Obviously he liked the Australian people and the Australian people liked him. He managed to keep the morale of the people high and their optimism for the future bright. The Duke of Gloucester was the last surviving son of King George V, and so an era has ended with his death. He was a very uninhibited man, informal in his approach. I clearly remember when I was a schoolboy his visiting my area, meeting countless school children, going from one school to another and being happy to shake hands and to speak to as many people as possible. We express our appreciation for the loyal and dedicated way in which he fulfilled his task and we will remember him as our only Royal GovernorGeneral. {: #debate-17-s3 .speaker-MI4} ##### Mr PEACOCK:\n\nKooyong **- Mr Speaker,** I wish to be associated directly but particularly briefly and personally in supporting this motion. My wife and I were friends of the Duke of Gloucester's eldest son and heir, Prince William, who died tragically in 1972. We shared many happy times together and the Duchess of Gloucester has graciously befriended my family on more than one occasion. I wish to express my sincere condolence to her and her family. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. DEATH OF FORMER SENATOR N. E. McKENNA **Mr WHITLAM** (Werriwa- Prime Minister) - The Honourable Nicholas Edward McKenna died on 22 April. He was a senator for Tasmania for 24 years from 1944, sitting for 20 of those years on the front bench. He had been successively an Australian public servant, an accountant and the law partner of a Premier and a Chief Justice of Tasmania. He quickly justified the great reputation which he brought to the Parliament. He was Minister for Health and Social Services from June 1946 to December 1949. During that period he acted as Treasurer, Attorney-General and Minister for the Interior. All these posts he held with great distinction. Indeed, he was for long affectionately known as Labor's man of distinction. **His** period as Minister for Health and Social Services was of particular importance to the Labor Government of the time and of particular significance for the welfare of the people of Australia. He was the first Minister to operate under the new powers achieved for this Parliament by the referendum of 1946. This, perhaps the most important of the few referendums to succeed, included in the powers of the Parliament: >The provision of maternity allowances, widows' pensions, child endowment, 'Unemployment, pharmaceutical, sickness and hospital benefits, medical and dental services (but not so as to authorise any form of civil conscription), benefits to students and family allowances. Accordingly, **Senator McKenna** had a pioneering role to play and he played it with success and compassion. He sponsored the Act and made the arrangements under which tuberculosis has been eliminated in Australia. He made arrangements with every State under which hospital treatment became free throughout Australia. Only now are we returning to his grand design. For over 3 years he and I served together on the Constitutional Review Committee. We formed an abiding trust and friendship. Without his support I would not have become Deputy Leader and later Leader of the Australian Labor Party. He said of himself when he retired from the Senate in 1968 that he departed with bitterness towards none. It was a feeling towards him unanimously reciprocated by the Parliament, his colleagues and his oppenents alike. Words like 'integrity' and 'loyalty' may be thought to be the cliches of condolence motions, but they are words which come immediately and sincerely to mind when thinking about Nick McKenna. He was a senator. He had a deep respect for that institution. He had, however, a deeper respect for the Constitution which establishes that institution. Jealous as he was of the proper powers of the Senate and its proper role, he was zealous that it should not abuse its powers or its role. In particular, in a record term of 15 years as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, he acknowledged the total impropriety of action by the Senate which would have the effect of sending this House to the people without senators themselves facing re-election. He firmly opposed suggestions of such a course whenever they were made. He recognised that the Senate could only damage itself by such falsification of democracy. He was a loyal member of the party which he loved. I know of the deep happiness which he received from the return of the Australian Labor Party to office after the long years of opposition, frustration and bitterness which left him, however, without bitterness. He lived to see the Senate attempt to take the course which he had so long, firmly and consistently opposed. I deeply regret that he did not live to see the people of Australia reject that course. I move: >That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on 22 April 1974 of the Honourable Nicholas Edward McKenna a former senator for the State of Tasmania from 1944 to 1968, a Minister of the Crown from 1946 to 1949, Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from 1949 to 195 1 and Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from 1951 to 1966, places on record its appreciation of his l"
