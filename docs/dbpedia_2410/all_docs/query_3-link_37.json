propose to the House, for its Speaker, Mr Aston andI move:\n\nThat the honourable member for Phillip (Mr Aston) do take the Chair of this House as Speaker.\n\nMr Lucock:\n\n-I second the nomination.\n\nMr Aston:\n\n– I accept the nomination.\n\nThe Clerk:\n\n– Is there any further proposal?\n\nMr GRIFFITHS:\n\nShortland\n\n– I propose to the House, for its Speaker, Mr Cope and move:\n\nThat the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Cope) do take the Chair of this House as Speaker.\n\nMr Duthie:\n\n– I second the nomination.\n\nMr Cope:\n\n– I accept the nomination.\n\nThe Clerk:\n\n– Are there any further proposals? The time for proposals has expired and the matter may now be the subject of debate.\n\nMr BEAZLEY:\n\nFremantle\n\n-I wish to speak in support of the candidature of the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Cope). Now that this House is opening in an unblaze of unglory to discuss divers urgent and important matters, namely, afternoon tea this afternoon, the Opposition feels that there should be a change of Speakership. Our fundamental reason for believing this is that the Opposition has never been given the protection of the Chair that it should have been given. The repeated occasions on which defamatory questions have been allowed against the Opposition and not allowed against members of the Government has become the subject of comment in an article written by a former Serjeant-at-Arms of this House who is now a professor of political science. That has been a leading characteristic of the Speakership as we have seen it.\n\nThe honourable member for Sydney has promised to protect the Opposition from defamatory statements. He will even protect the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) from defamatory statements from behind him. So with these qualifications of impartiality we think he should be made the Speaker. He has promised other interesting ceremonies.\n\nHe has promised to discuss and possibly to make innovations in the Parliament. Sixty years ago a former honourable member for Ballaarat, Alfred Deakin, spoke about a Minister removed from office. He said that he reminded him of an ill-bred urchin dragged screaming and kicking from a tart shop. For 60 years we have had the problem of the ungraceful exit of Ministers. Our candidate for the Speakership believes that wailing could be done much better by bagpipes and that a new ceremony should be enacted for the Parliament so that a Minister rejected from office could be led in solemn procession around the lobbies with bagpipes wailing for him. This would be a more seemly method than the one we have seen in recent days. Also there might even be a ceremony for the grievances of an uninvited Assistant Whip who informs us that he cannot support the Government. Perhaps he could be piped aboard as he comes up the parliamentary steps.\n\nBut in a more serious mood, we believe that a new look has to be taken at the Speakership. Many members from the Government side have spoken about the downgrading of the Parliament one of the main features of which, we believe, has been the absence of neutrality from the Chair. That is our serious belief. The man who sits in the chair is the custodian of the rights of the House, not of the power of the Executive Government of the Commonwealth. This, we believe, has been the fundamental mistake that has been made in the Speakership over the last few years and for that reason we nominate the honourable member for Sydney.\n\nMr DRURY:\n\nRyan\n\n– I refute the allegations that have just been made, somewhat unworthily in my opinion, by the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley). I was surprised at some of the remarks he made. They were not in accordance with the facts. I know that many honourable members in the previous Parliament, from this side of the House, as well as honourable members from the other side, paid tribute to Mr Aston for the impartiality, integrity, dignity, decorum and fair mindedness which he displayed in endeavouring to carry out the onerous duties of Speaker of this House. I refute entirely the charge that there was an absence of neutrality in the exercise of his duties. On the contrary, I believe that he gave fair protection to all honourable members, including the independent members who were previously in the chamber. During his 3-year term as Speaker Mr Aston enjoyed the respect of all members of the Parliament. I assure all new members of this Parliament that in the old Parliament Mr Aston enjoyed the profound respect and admiration of honourable members from both sides of the chamber. I certainly gained the impression that he had the confidence of all honourable members. He was patient often to the nth degree, even under great provocation from some members of the Opposition. Of course, Mr Speaker must be prepared to be patient under somewhat trying circumstances. These inevitably arise in the day to day proceedings in this chamber. Mr Aston has always shown himself to be a humane, understanding and fair minded Speaker. He is a man able to be firm when the occasion demands firmness. In the old Parliament he displayed a conscientious devotion to the demands of his most important office, not only in the chamber but outside it. I can speak from personal experience of these things because I have served under him on some of the standing committees of the Parliament. I am sure that all honourable members, including honourable members opposite, who have served on committees chaired by Mr Aston, including meetings of the executive of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and of the Union itself, will agree with me. I think all who have been associated with Mr Aston will concede that he has done his job impartially, fairly and well. Not only has he performed his duties as Speaker extremely well in this chamber but on important occasions he has represented this country overseas, and from all accounts has done so with great dignity and responsibility, bringing credit not only to himself but also to this Parliament and to this country. I repeat that Mr Aston has all the qualities of mind and the humanity to fit him ably once again to hold the office of Speaker in this House.\n\nMr Clyde Cameron:\n\nHINDMARSH, SOUTH AUSTRALIA · ALP\n\n– It is not my custom to comment about candidates for the Speakership. That is a risky game, because one may have to work for the next 12 months or so under a man against whom be has levelled criticism. But it is a calculated risk. I do not think I have much to lose on this occasion because I got such a rough deal in the last Parliament. I could not get a rougher deal in this Parliament. I ask honourable members, particularly the new members of the Parliament, who were referred to by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Drury), who read his speech so ably a moment ago, to compare the jovial dignity of Mr Cope with the cruel and arrogant posture of the gentleman who has been proposed from the other side. Honourable members will observe in Mr Cope a gentleman who has the highest -regard for the Parliament and its rights as well as for the rights of honourable members who sit in the Parliament. This is the important thing. We shall have in Mr Cope as Mr Speaker one who will not be the mere lackey of the Prime Minister, one who will not be the mere servant of some political party but one who will be the servant of the people who have been chosen by the electorate of this great Commonwealth of ours to represent it. 1 would say to those gentlemen who have fallen victim of the Mushroom Club to take this opportunity now of dealing with the nominee of the Prime Minister. Unlike Mr Cope, who has been selected unanimously by Her Majesty’s Opposition to be its nominee for the office of Speaker, the person who has been nominated by the Government is the handpicked stool pigeon of the Prime Minister.\n\nDr Mackay:\n\n– Untrue.\n\nMr Clyde Cameron:\n\nHINDMARSH, SOUTH AUSTRALIA · ALP\n\n– I am glad to hear this.\n\nDr Mackay:\n\n– It is by secret, exhaustive ballot.\n\nMr Clyde Cameron:\n\nHINDMARSH, SOUTH AUSTRALIA · ALP\n\n– This is why I made the comment. I was never able to discover just how the Government candidate for the office of Speaker was selected. It puzzles me to think that a responsible body of men - this only makes the injury greater - or a body of men which claims to be responsible could have chosen such a candidate as Mr Aston.\n\nMr Jeff Bate:\n\n– You will be for it now, Clyde.\n\nMr Clyde Cameron:\n\nHINDMARSH, SOUTH AUSTRALIA · ALP\n\n– Yes, I would say that I will be in for it 1 would say also that had there been an election on the Government side to choose the nominee for this office probably men like the honourable member for Macarthur would have rated much higher in the ranks on the other side than Mr-\n\nMr Charles Jones:\n\n– Would he be staying at the Kurrajong?\n\nMr Clyde Cameron:\n\nHINDMARSH, SOUTH AUSTRALIA · ALP\n\n– Well, why would he not stop at the Kurrajong? As far as I know, he stays at the Kurrajong. I suppose that, as long as a person pays his way, he can stay wherever he likes. I call upon Mr Erwin and Mr Fairbairn, who has had such a rough deal at the hands of the Prime Minister: Here is your golden opportunity to even up your old scores with the Prime Minister and to show your Prime Minister that one of his chief campaign directors in New South Wales, Mr Aston, is not going to get away with it so easily and is not going to be given this plum of office now. I call on Mr Kelly, who was so shabbily treated by the Prime Minister-\n\nMr Daly:\n\n– That he had to sell his. suit.\n\nMr Clyde Cameron:\n\nHINDMARSH, SOUTH AUSTRALIA · ALP\n\n– Yes, he had to sell his striped pants because he has no further use for them. I call on Mr Kelly, if he is allowed to register a secret vote without somebody looking over his shoulder, to do so and to vote for Mr Cope. The honourable member will then be giving to the Parliament an excellent Speaker and, at the same time, will be telling John Grey Gorton that he cannot run this place as he has been running it in the past.\n\nI call on Mr Kevin Cairns, who is a man of extraordinary courage - usually - to do the same kind of thing. I address the same remarks to Mr McMahon who is sitting there alongside Mr McEwen. They appear to be happy enough at the moment, but I have seen times when they were not quite so happy. Mr McEwen has every reason to be happy even if Mr McMahon has not because now Mr McEwen has a secondrater in charge of the Treasury and it will be much easier for the Department of Trade and Industry to override the Treasury than it has been in the past. At the same time, I would not mind being the Minister for External Affairs. I do not know why the present Minister for External Affairs appears so upset by his demotion.\n\nDr Mackay is a gentleman who ought to even up a few scores. If anybody earned a promotion to the Ministry, it was Dr\n\nMackay. But no, he did not receive nomination even for the Speakership. I think that he has every reason to take this opportunity to appoint somebody who is not the mere lackey of John Grey Gorton. Then, Mr Howson, last but not least, who is a man who has always shown great courage-\n\nThe Clerk:\n\n– The honourable member’s time has expired.\n\nMr SNEDDEN:\n\nMinister for Labour and National Service · Bruce · LP\n\n– Mr Clerk, I regret that the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron) has taken advantage of the absence, for the one time in the life of this Parliament, of an honourable member holding the office of Mr Speaker. The honourable member has used terms which quite clearly are not only inaccurate but also vicious and unparliamentary. He has used a term in relation to Mr Aston, and I shall quote it for it ought to be repeated to reveal the calibre of the mind, the presentation and the willingness to descend to the lowest depths in debate which characterise the honourable member for Hindmarsh. The term which he used was ‘a hand-picked stool pigeon’. The honourable member for Hindmarsh can laugh about it. I welcome his laughing about it as an example to all those new members who sit on his side of the House. I hope they will reject it as a standard of performance in this national Parliament, because if they perform in the way in which the honourable member for Hindmarsh has done they will reduce this Parliament from an international standing as a house of debate to the sort of thing which the honourable member would have it - a gutter discussion. We on this side of the House will not participate in that way throughout the term of this Parliament, but on the contrary, whenever we hear from the opposite side of the House language to that effect we shall expose it and we shall use the forms of the House to have it expunged and, if necessary, to deprive the user of the language of the service of the House.\n\nThe honourable member for Phillip, whose nomination was moved by Mr Drury and seconded by Mr Lucock, has served this Parliament as Speaker. I believe that he has disclosed in that service a capacity to calm the House down at moments when it appeared that the House was about to erupt into bad humour. He has shown, I believe, impartiality. I believe that he has been fair and that indeed he has shown a judicial attitude towards the discharge of his job. All those things that I have said of Mr Aston could, I believe, be quite properly said about a man whom I regard as a friend, Mr Cope, the nominee from the other side of the House. I believe mat if he were elected to the Speakership he would discharge his job very well, with fairness and impartiality. I accept that, because I know him as a man. But I am bound to say that in my judgment Mr Aston would do the job better, and has experience to Help in a parliament which this morning’s performances quite clearly mark as not a parliament of which we will be proud, if that sort of performance continues. For those reasons I support Mr Aston, and I would ask all those people who have had the experience of serving under him to vote for him in the ballot that now follows, as I most certainly will. Mr Clerk, I move:\n\nThat the question be now put.\n\nQuestion put. The House divided. (The Clerk- Mr A. G. Turner)\n\nAYES: 64\n\nNOES: 59\n\nMajority …….. 5\n\nAYES\n\nNOES\n\nQuestion so resolved in the affirmative.\n\nMr SPEAKER (Hon W J Aston:\n\nPHILLIP, NEW SOUTH WALES\n\n-I wish to thank the House for the high honour it has conferred upon me. (Mr Speaker having seated himself in the Chair)\n\nMr GORTON:\n\nPrime Minister · Higgins · LP\n\n– Mr Speaker, I wish to offer my congratulations on your election to the office of great responsibility which you now hold. I have not the slightest doubt that you will, in this Parliament, carry out your duties with that distinction, with that fairness and with that firmness which earned universal approbation in this House during the last Parliament and which led to congratulations being offered to you from all sides on behalf of both the Opposition and the Government at the slight interregnum between your two terms of office. I have no doubt that you will, as you have in the past, be one of the Parliament’s most distinguished presiding officers.\n\nMr WHITLAM:\n\nLeader of the Opposition · Werriwa\n\n– Mr Speaker, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party I congratulate you on being re-elected to your high office. You are, Sir, accustomed to having small majorities. I hope that you will spare me from being more generous in my remarks, for after my colleagues and I were benevolent and, in fact, generous on your behalf during the valedictory at the end of the last Parliament you were good enough to quote our remarks in your campaign literature. I do not propose to give hostage to fortune on this occasion. You will have noticed, Sir, that the Opposition is disposed to scrutinise the conduct of yourself and your Party colleagues much more vigilantly than hitherto. I hope I do not have the unpleasant task, as I did in the last Parliament, of moving dissent from your rulings. You know the particular ruling which irks us, and I do not intend to repeat it. We wish you well in the chair and we congratulate you on being re-elected.\n\nMr COPE:\n\nSydney\n\n- Mr Speaker, I should like to take this opportunity of heartily congratulating you on your success. As one of your Deputies in the last Parliament 1 was honoured to serve under your orders and directions and it was a very pleasant duty indeed. Again, may I offer my hearty congratulations.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– May I thank the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and also the honourable member for Sydney for their kind remarks on my re-occupancy of the chair. I should like also to thank the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Drury) and the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) for respectively nominating me and seconding my nomination. I am deeply conscious of the high honour that has been accorded to me. During my previous term of office it was my desire to endeavour to conduct this House with the dignity and decorum it deserved and, at the same time, to do my utmost to maintain a balance and to carry out my duties with strict impartiality. I intend to do just this in the next 3 years, and I can assure honourable members that it will be without fear or favour to any person or member of this House. I again thank the House for its generosity and I hope to have the support of all honourable members from both sides of the House in my endeavours to make this democratic chamber work as it should work and not to allow it to be used for purposes of defamation or for scurrilous purposes.\n\npage 12\n\nPRESENTATION TO THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL\n\nMr GORTON:\n\nPrime Minister · Higgins · LP\n\n– I have learned that it will be the pleasure of His Excellency the Governor-General to receive you, Mr Speaker, in the Library of the Parliament this day at 2.42 p.m.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– Prior to my presentation to His Excellency the Governor-General this afternoon, the bells will be rung for three minutes so that honourable members may attend in the chamber and accompany the Speaker, when they may if they so wish, be introduced to His Excellency.\n\nSitting suspended from 12.35 to 2.41 p.m. (The House proceeded to the Library, and, being reassembled)\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– I have to report that, accompanied by honourable members, I this day proceeded to the Library of the Parliament and presented myself to His Excellency the Governor-General as the choice of the House, and that His Excellency was kind enough to congratulate me on my election as Speaker.\n\npage 12\n\nCOMMISSION TO ADMINISTER OATH\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– His Excellency the GovernorGeneral has presented to me a commission authorising me to administer to members of the House the oath or affirmation of allegiance. I now lay the commission on the table.\n\npage 13\n\nMESSAGE FROM THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL\n\nThe Usher of the Black Rod, being announced, was admitted, and delivered a message that His Excellency the GovernorGeneral desired the attendance of honourable members in the Senate chamber forthwith.

He was a man in the prime of life out campaigning for the things in which he believed. He was never a man to do things by half measure. He was throwing himself tirelessly into the election campaign and his untimely death at the age of only SO was a sad blow to his colleagues and to his many friends in this Parliament.\n\nSir, Senator Cohen was an outstanding member of the Senate. He was a man of considerable intellectual gifts and a man of principle and of integrity. He sat in the Senate from 1962 and became the Labor\n\nParty’s spokesman on matters relating to education, science, radio and television. As a senator and as Minister for Education and Science I had good cause to know at first hand his capabilities and his qualities. I developed a genuine respect and a personal regard for him. He had a deep interest in education in Australia. It was a genuine interest. He studied the matter deeply. He approached that aspect of his work with great sincerity.\n\nHe was born on 21st October 1918. After his early education at Wesley College, Melbourne, he attained the degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Master of Laws from Melbourne University. After serving in the Australian military forces during the Second World War, he was admitted to the Bar. He became a Queen’s Counsel in 1961 with a wide practice, particularly in industrial law. He was a member of the Victorian Executive of the Australian Labor Party. He entered the Senate in 1962 representing Victoria.\n\nHe was a vigorous and able debater. He took an active part in the life of the Senate, first as a member of the Senate Select Committee on the Encouragement of Australian Productions for Television and then as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. He was, as I have mentioned, Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from February 1967.\n\nHis sudden death robbed the Senate of an active and inquiring mind and of a very real talent. I may say with complete truth that I feel that he was a loss to his Party, to the Parliament and to Australia and, I think, to me as a personal friend. Most of all, of course, his death is a tragic loss to his family. On behalf of the Government, I express my deepest sympathy to his wife and children.\n\nMr WHITLAM:\n\nLeader of the Opposition · Werriwa\n\n– Mr Speaker, I support the motion that the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) has moved concerning the death of Senator Cohen. My colleagues and I particularly appreciate the fact that the Prime Minister spoke in these terms about a man whom he had been able to observe and know as a member of another place and as Minister for Education and Science. We appreciate the fact that his Government paid our late colleague the honour of a State funeral. As will appear from the record which the Prime Minister has given, Senator Cohen had been a gifted scholar, an outstanding counsel and a most public spirited citizen.\n\nOn other occasions, family and community, I have had the privilege of paying tribute to him. I should like to quote the words of Mr Clyde Holding, the Leader of the Victorian Parliamentary Labor Party at the Melbourne General Cemetery on the occasion of Senator Cohen’s funeral to bring home to honourable members the motivations of our late colleague. Mr Holding said:\n\nIt was, of course, within the Jewish community that Sam Cohen’s social attitudes and philosophy were born and nurtured. Like many young Jews who lived through the climactic horrors of Nazi persecution during the last World War, the anguish and the plight of the Jewish people throughout Europe burned deeply into his soul. It moved him into a lifelong involvement and struggle against all forms of Fascism and antiSemitism. He saw this struggle, not as negative exposure of neo-Fascist tendencies or antiSemitic attitudes within our own community, but as the creation of a positive social and political democracy in Australia - and that led him into the Labor movement.\n\nSenator Cohen’s extraordinarily rapid rise in the ranks of the Labour Party, both in the organisation outside the Parliament and in the Parliament, was not due to his faith. That was an irrelevance. It was because his colleagues outside the Parliament and in it recognised his great abilities, energies and dedication. He rose in less than 5 years in the Senate to be Deputy Leader of the Labor Party in the Senate - so chosen by members of the Labor Party in both the Houses of the Parliament.\n\nI asked him to assume particular responsibility for education and science, and for communications and the arts. He had served during the last years of the war on the original Universities Commission. In recent years he had been a member of the Australian National University Council. He had been co-opted, at the instance of the immediate past Minister for Education and Science, to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation’s Executive. He rose by the qualities I have described, and the sad truth is that he died in his prime because of them. For if ever a politician could be said to have died serving his party, it was Senator Cohen. This is profoundly as well as literally true.\n\nMy own debt to Senator Cohen is deep. I had been closely associated with him, before he was elected to the Parliament, in connection with the Crimes Act amendments of 1960. I had visited New Guinea with him in 1964. I had been closely associated with him in his position of Deputy Leader in the Senate. My own view for many years has been that the National Government must accept a measure of responsibility for all schools. I twice expressed that view in my first year in this Parliament in 1953. It is no secret that at the time I became Leader of my Party and Senator Cohen its Deputy Leader in the Senate, that was not the official policy of our Party. It now is. In securing support for that policy Senator Cohen played a crucial role. Without his support it is at least doubtful whether that view would have prevailed. To put it at its lowest, my task would have been immeasurably harder.\n\nBut, setting political considerations aside, I cannot but believe that the adoption of this policy will work mightily for the good of our children, and therefore for our country’s good, whoever may be in power. A divisive and destructive issue has, I believe, been buried for all time. If this proves so it will have been not the least of Senator Cohen’s contributions to this nation’s welfare. It was in the very act of explaining and expounding this attitude as my representative - with great verve and brilliance, I am assured by my colleagues who were at the meeting in Adelaide that night - that he died. He died in the middle of the hurly-burly of an election campaign. I was on the road from Gosford to Sydney after a meeting which was part of the campaign which has returned another Cohen to the national Parliament Thus only briefly could we pause. It had to be so, and I know that Senator Cohen would have wanted it so. The great business had to go on. Earlier this month, at the first meeting of the Parliamentary Labor Party after the election, his Party colleagues honoured him before proceeding to elect his successor for that, too, was how it had to be. Today, at the first meeting of the two Houses after the election, his parliamentary colleagues on both sides and of all views pay tribute to him. For as long as Australians honour the ideal of service to the public, Senator Cohen, who was a highly qualified man and who put all at risk for the chances of politics and the chance to serve, will have an honoured place indeed.\n\nMr McEWEN:\n\nMinister for Trade and Industry · Murray · CP\n\n– I wish to associate the members of the Parliamentary Australian Country Party with the sentiments which have been expressed by the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam). I endorse completely the remarks made by them. The late Senator Cohen was clearly a man of strong character and high intelligence. These are great qualities, but in addition Sam Cohen was a man of constant good humour. He was well liked by all members of all Parties. It is perhaps less difficult in this place to be respected than to be liked. Sam Cohen was both respected and liked. As a senator he served his Party well and his Party recognised his service by appointing him, as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate after a comparatively short period of service there. He was always conscious that as a senator he had a particular responsibility to his State of Victoria.\n\nFrom my observations, he discharged that obligation conscientiously and well. His basic integrity and honesty were obvious, as was his capacity for hard work. These qualities were revealed in his professional life as well as in his parliamentary public life. As a lawyer in private life, he was able to bring considerable knowledge and experience to bear on legislation, particularly legislation concerned with education and science and the communications industry. I understand that he was the Labor Party’s spokesman in the Senate on these matters. I happen to be a close personal friend of some people, not highly circumstanced, who also were friends of his. I have personal knowledge of his humanity and his willingness to help the ordinary people who quite frequently turned to him for help and advice. He was obviously a man of great humanity. The Australian Country Party supports the motion before the chamber and the sentiments that were expressed by the two previous speakers in extending sincere sympathy to the late Sam Cohen’s widow and family.\n\nMr Clyde Cameron:\n\nHINDMARSH, SOUTH AUSTRALIA · ALP\n\n– It is sad to have to speak to a motion of this kind. It is something which I wish I could avoid, but I do not think I can avoid it without appearing to show a lack of gratitude to a very great, very dear and very loyal friend. I particularly want to thank the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) for the generous and very kind remarks he made about our dear friend, Sam Cohen. Everything the Prime Minister said was true. The Prime Minister did not have to say what he said but he did, and it is to his credit that he said what he knew to be true about a political opponent and, I believe, a personal friend. I was touched immensely by the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam). Sam Cohen had a tremendous regard for the Leader of the Opposition and his ability and he was a very loyal Deputy Leader in the Senate. I hope I will be pardoned for using Christian names when I say that Gough Whitlam, too, has lost a very great friend. I thank the Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr McEwen) for his kind remarks. The Leader of the Country Party is noted for his generosity to his political opponents on occasions like this. He, like the Prime Minister, was not obliged to say the things that he did say but he has said them and it is to his credit that he placed on record his thoughts and knowledge of a very great member of this Parliament.\n\nOn 7th October I lost a very great, very dear and loyal friend. Australia lost a great statesman. The Australian Labor Party lost a very great leader. The Jewish people lost a very noble and gentle son. On that day his wife Judith lost a deeply devoted and very proud husband. Sam Cohen had every right to be proud because in Judith Cohen he had a wife of extraordinary charms and extraordinary intellect. As I said, he had every reason to be proud of his wife. He lived for his wife and for his two little girls, Susan and Sally. The death of Sam Cohen has taken from Susan and Sally a kind and loving father but their loss, I am sure, will be ameliorated by fond memories of the joy and happiness that he brought them in the too few years that he presided over their care and upbringing. Australian Jewry has lost one of its most worthy sons. Mr Gerald Falk, President of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, spoke for everyone who had the honour of knowing Mr Sam Cohen when he said that the Australian Jewish community was proud of his leading role in political life and his contributions to the development of Australia. As a Jew, Sam Cohen was steadfast to his religion and was loyal to all his friends. Sam Cohen just could not be disloyal to anything or anybody. He could not be disloyal to principles; he could not be disloyal to a person. They were the qualities which made him the great man that he was.\n\nSam Cohen detested violence and he fought tyranny and injustice whenever and wherever he encountered it. With his friend Ernest Platz he became prominent in the fight against war, Fascism and antisemitism. Sam Cohen loved the Jewish people and he did so with complete justification. He was proud of his race and of its achievements. The whole history of the Jewish people literally glitters with the names and records of men and women of outstanding qualities and qualifications. One has only to mention but a few of those who are more famous in more recent years. That leaves unmentioned many thousands more in earlier times. Names come to mind such as the great Einstein, Sir John Monash, the first Australian-born Governor-General, Sir Isaac Isaacs, Disraeli, Anton Rubinstein, Jacob Epstein, Julius Reuter, Sigmund Freud, Mendelssohn, Emile Zola, Henri Bergson. We can go on and on mentioning the names of very great Jewish people. It was little wonder therefore that Sam Cohen was proud of his race. I think that to the names of those illustrious men I have mentioned must now be added the name of Samuel Herbert Cohen. He will go down in history as one of the really great men in Australia’s public life. His untimely death is not only a tragic loss to his family, to the Jewish people, to the Parliament and to the Australian nation, but it is a great and irreplaceable loss to the Australian Labor movement.\n\nSenator Cohen was our deputy leader in the Senate. In that capacity he was always thorough in his work. His ability as a debater was unparalleled. The Prime Minister was kind enough to testify to his ability as a debater. His arguments were always prepared with great thoroughness and his penetrating logic was admired by his political opponents as well as by his supporters. I do not believe that Sam\n\nCohen had a personal enemy in the whole Parliament. Both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Australian Country Party made that point in their remarks to the motion. Even those who differed strongly from Sam Cohen’s politics loved his ready smile and respected him for his gentlemanly demeanour and constant courtesy. He never varied; he was always courteous. He was not courteous one day and discourteous on another.\n\nSpeaking at the graveside in Melbourne Senator Lionel Murphy summed up our late colleague’s qualities in this way, when he said:\n\nHe used bis ability in the fairest of ways. His skill in debate was never used to hurt his opponents, rather to persuade.\n\nThat was so terribly true of Sam Cohen. He just could not bring himself to hurt a person. He always tried to persuade. Perhaps it was the Leader of the Labor Party in the Victorian Parliament, Mr Clyde Holding, M.P., who best expressed the views of all of us who knew Sam Cohen and loved him when during his panegyric he made the remarks referred to by my leader a moment ago. Mr Holding made some other comments which I would like to have recorded. He said that Sam Cohen: . . brought to the Labor movement not merely his political vision and the clarity of his intellect; he brought his skills as an advocate, his great gift of eloquence. His influence on men and ideas was probably even more significant. His was a vital and, at times, turbulent personality. The great warmth that came from his love of men, their strengths and weaknesses, was an enduring asset to him and all who knew him. He knew, at times, the personal trauma extracted from all leaders who choose to follow the strength of their own intellectal conviction. The moral grandeur of his personality enabled him in such situations to understand the purposes of men and in his unfailing kindness, he could never harbour resentment against anyone. . . . For his people and his Party it is not the end - it is only the beginning. For him and his kind there can never be an end, only new beginnings.\n\nThat was the conclusion of Mr Holding’s panegyric.\n\nI have a very special reason for loving and remembering Sam Cohen. I not only admired and respected him as the model husband and father I knew him to be and as a fighter for civil rights, but I loved him for his help, then for his friendship and finally for his loyalty and for his wise counsel. I first met Sam Cohen in 1959 when I was introduced to him by Mr John\n\nRyan and his law partner, Mr Clyde Holding. Jack Ryan and Clyde Holding were my solicitors in the litigation in which I was involved at that time. I had no money but I had justice on my side and finally I had Sam Cohen on my side because when he read the brief for my case he agreed to act without so much as a passing reference to fees. This brought home to me the very truth of one comment made by Mr Clyde Holding on the occasion to which I previously referred, when he said: No man who ever appealed to his social conscience went away empty handed’. Sam Cohen acted for me in two separate cases before the full bench of the Commonwealth Industrial Court. He was my adviser when one of the cases went on appeal to the High Court of Australia and when another went on appeal to the Privy Council. The fact that I succeeded in all four cases was not only an indication of Sam Cohen’s acute sense of justice but also a tribute to his astute court craft and to his wide knowledge of the law.\n\nI have lost a dear and very good friend; the Labor movement has lost a loyal and dedicated leader; the Jewish people have lost a courageous champion of their cause; and the people of Australia and their elected Parliament have lost one of the most talented parliamentarians since federation. But great though the loss has been to those I have already mentioned, the greatest loss of all has been to his wife Judith, his daughters, Susan and Sally, and his brother. Whilst there can be no substitute for a kind, loving and honourable husband and father I hope that it will be some solace to Judith Cohen and to her two young daughters, Susan and Sally, to know that Sam’s great qualities of which they were so well aware are recognised also by those of us who served with him as friends, colleagues and opponents in this Parliament. I sincerely support the motion.\n\nMr GILES:\n\nAngas\n\n– I would like to associate myself with the words spoken by the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam), the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr McEwen) and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Clyde Cameron). With the honourable member for Kingston (Dr Gun) and the former member for Kingston, Miss\n\nBrownbill, I was involved in debate at the meeting on the night in question.\n\nI cannot say that I knew Senator Cohen very well but I would like my remarks to be associated with those already made. In particular, I would like my own expressions of very deep and sincere sympathy with his wife and family to become part of the record.\n\nDr GUN:\n\nKingston\n\n– I, too, would like to support the motion of condolence proposed by the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) and supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam). Senator Cohen’s death has meant an irreplaceable loss to the Labor movement and to this nation. As the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr McEwen) has said, Sam Cohen was a man to whom nothing was too much trouble. I always found him prepared to give me his advice, encouragement, support and friendship. As the honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles) has said, it was during a public meeting on 7th October when he was supporting my candidature for this Parliament that Senator Cohen died. I would like to place on record my sorrow that Senator Cohen is not here with us and to express my sympathy to his widow and family.\n\nQuestion resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n-I thank the House. I understand that it is the desire of the House to have the sitting suspended until 4.30 p.m. I will resume the chair at that time.\n\nSitting suspended from 3.50 to 4.30 pm\n\npage 18\n\nGOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– I have to report that the House this day attended His Excellency the Governor-General in the Senate chamber, when His Excellency was pleased to make a Speech to both Houses of the Parliament. The Speech will be included in Hansard for record purposes. (The Speech read as follows):\n\nMembers of the Senate and Members of the House of Representatives.\n\nThis, the First Session of the 27th Parliament, has been summoned, following the return of the writs for the general election of Members of the House of Representatives on 25th October.\n\nYour attendance has been required in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution which require that the Parliament should be summoned this year and for the discharge of necessary formal business.\n\nMy advisers intend to seek the prorogation of the Parliament and it is proposed that you will be called together again as soon as possible next year. At the opening of the Second Session of the 27th Parliament there will belaid before you fully for your consideration the way in which my Government will implement its policies comprising among others, matters relating to the defence and development of our country, to the education, health, housing and social welfare of our people and to the encouragement of the arts.\n\nI now leave you in the faith that Divine Providence will always guide your deliberations and further the welfare of the people of Australia.\n\npage 19\n\nADDRESS-IN-REPLY\n\nMotion (by Mr Gorton) agreed to.\n\nThat a Committee consisting of Mr Fox, Mr Corbett and the mover be appointed to prepare an Address-in-Reply to the speech delivered by His Excellency the Governor-General to both Houses of the Parliament and that the Committee do report at a later hour this day.\n\npage 19\n\nCHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES\n\nElection\n\nMr HALLETT:\n\nCanning\n\n– I move:\n\nMr Fox:\n\n– I second the motion.\n\nMr DALY:\n\nGrayndler\n\n– I move:\n\nMr L R JOHNSON:\n\nHUGHES, NEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\n– I second the motion.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– Is there any further motion? The time for motions has expired.\n\nMr DALY:\n\nGrayndler\n\n– I would like to say a few words in support of the nomination of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) for the office of Chairman of Committees. Naturally the Australian Labor Party does not take this action without very good reason and purpose. We are completely and utterly dissatisfied, as you may have gathered this morning, Mr Speaker, with the conduct of the House by yourself and by the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock), who was Chairman of Committees. When the honourable member for Lyne was elected to the position on 8th March 1961, the Minister for Trade and Industry (Mr McEwen) who was Acting Prime Minister, said:\n\nWe know that he is a master of the Standing Orders and is a man of intelligence and integrity.\n\nThe honourable member may have those qualities, but if he has they are very well hidden. Never have we seen them displayed here. You know, Mr Speaker, that the honourable member has been opposed on practically every occasion that he has been nominated for office. He gives no protection at all to Opposition members when vicious attacks are made upon them by honourable members on the Government side. As a matter of fact, he does not protect the Liberals either. When he is in the chair, if an honourable member refrains from attacking the Australian Country Party he will get a fair go, but if an honourable member mentions the Country Party he is called to order. Honourable members on the Government side should seize the opportunity now not only to get their own back on the Country Party but also to elect to this important position a man of the integrity and capacity of the honourable member for Hunter.\n\nIt is almost impossible to follow the rulings of the honourable member for Lyne. We have seen the Committee in uproar and the honourable member on his feet calling the Opposition to order when in fact the uproar was created by honourable members on the Government side. This has happened again and again. We believe that the only way to stop this happening is to replace the honourable member for Lyne with a man who will keep order with dignity and capacity. I suggest to the honourable member for Ballaarat (Mr Erwin) that he vote against the Government on this issue as he did this morning when the Speaker was elected. He should again exercise his right to do so. I appeal to those fair-minded members opposite - I admit they are extremely scarce - to do something for the nation and defeat the nomination of the honourable member for Lyne as Chairman of Committees.\n\nLet us look at the candidature of the honourable member for Hunter. He has been the member for Hunter for 10 years. His father served in this Parliament for 30 years before him and had an outstanding record of service to and achievement for the Australian Labor Party. I am reminded by the honourable member for Hunter that he is a third generation Australian of Welsh stock from the coal mining village of Tredeger in Wales. He has matured like the rich red wines of the Hunter Valley. He is free, independent and upright and, to cap it all, he is married with three children. Honourable members know that he is a warm-hearted, compassionate Christian gentleman whose frequent Biblical quotations have inspired this House on the occasions on which he has used them. There is no denying that he has an arresting personality. He enforced the law for 24 years and might be termed a social reformer. I suggest that he might bring a new approach to discipline in the Parliament if he occupies the chair. His appointment might save money in doing away with the position of Serjeant-at-Arms, because he would be able to make his own arrests.\n\nThe honourable member for Hunter is fearless, impartial, outspoken and tolerant. He has understanding in all things. He will protect both the Government and the Opposition. I believe that the honourable member would bring dignity, capacity, impartiality and understanding to the Chair in keeping with the highest ideals and traditions of this Parliament. Even you, Mr Speaker, would agree that he would be a great improvement on the former occupant. Government members and the honourable member for Ballaarat (Mr Erwin), who this morning did not have a real opportunity to do something for the Parliament, now have the chance to do so. Those Liberals who want to get their own back on the Country Party and to take full retribution have nothing to lose but the Chairman of Committees.\n\nMr GORTON:\n\nPrime Minister · Higgins · LP\n\n– I rise to support the candidature of the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock). In particular I wish to take this first opportunity to correct a statement which will appear in Hansard because it has been made unequivocally by the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Daly) without, as far as I know, any justification whatsoever. The honourable member for Grayndler, in mentioning the honourable member for Ballaarat (Mr Erwin), said that he had voted this morning in a particular way. It was a secret ballot, so there is no justification at all for this charge which should not be allowed to stand in Hansard without being corrected. I rise to correct it and to put the record straight because this is an accusation which should not be made without proof. For the rest, Mr Speaker, I said that I rose to support the candidature of the honourable member for Lyne. He needs no great support in this because all honourable members of the House have seen him in operation and know that he operates in an entirely different way from that which the honourable member for Grayndler said he operated in, and in my opinion we could not have a better Chairman of Committees.\n\nMr L R JOHNSON:\n\nHUGHES, NEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\n– I should like to take the earliest opportunity to speak in support of my colleague, the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James), who has been nominated as Chairman of Committees. I believe that if ever there were a time to put party biases aside it is in respect of the candidature of my colleague. As the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Daly) has said, our candidate is a man of stature and bearing, and he is used to command. We can say that honourable members have the opportunity to go with the strength. If honourable members have a temptation to extol the virtues of his antagonist on this occasion they should look at his performance. I have not had a chance to see it over the last 3 years. AH 1 can say is that if the Chairman of Committees has improved over that period he is the only aspect of the Government that has improved.\n\nThe honourable member for Hunter has many virtues and attributes for this job. He has had legal training and he will be able to bring it to bear here. We recall from his record that he has always been prepared to temper justice with mercy. He is one of the most widely travelled members of this Parliament and even exceeds the virtues of the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) in that regard. I contend that the confidence that I have in the honourable member for Hunter is a reflection of the massive support that he receives from the people who know him best of all - the constituents of the Hunter electorate. He is a man of great talents. I think you, Mr Speaker, will concede that he has talents very similar to yours and that he therefore would be able to work in co-operation with you, bringing great credit and dignity to the Parliament.\n\nMr HALLETT:\n\nCanning\n\n– Having already nominated the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) as Chairman of Committees it is hardly necessary for me to expand on his qualifications to hold this high office. Those honourable members who have been in the Parliament during recent years will be well aware of the way in which the honourable member has carried out the duties of Chairman of Committees. I have no doubt that if re-elected, as I am sure he will be, he will continue to perform those duties in the manner expected of him. His ability to fill the office of Chairman is widely known. It is an important position, calling on many occasions for great restraint on the part of the occupant. The honourable member for Lyne has in the past demonstrated that he has this quality. It is not an easy position to fill, with the Parliament often sitting into the early hours of the morning, but in the past the honourable member for Lyne has stood up to the strains of the office and done an admirable job. I have no doubt that if re-elected he will fulfil the obligations attaching to office.\n\nMr BRYANT:\n\nWills\n\n– The honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) is the candidate of the largest group in this House. If for no other reason than that, his nomination should be given serious consideration by all honourable members who have some regard for democratic procedures. I want to press his suit in this matter not so much on that ground but rather because in the past the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock), who has many estimable personal qualities, has, as Chairman of Committees, brought to the deliberations of this Parliament very restrictive judgments. On almost every occasion when there has been some dispute about aspects of legislation or the general procedures of the Parliament the honourable member for Lyne has been inclined to be very restrictive in his rulings. This has been bad for debate in this place. It is my opinion that his decisions have become more restrictive in the last 7 or 8 years. I believe that the judicial background and general characteristics of the honourable member for Hunter would be of greater benefit to the Parliament than would the qualifications of the honourable member for Lyne, for whom I still have great personal regard.\n\nIt is very important that the Parliament, constituted as it is, should be able to discuss freely and without inhibition any issue that comes before it. Almost invariably the honourable member for Lyne has been restrictive in his judgments. Other matters have been of concern to the Labor Party, particularly when we were so few in numbers during the last few years. I do not believe that we always had from the Chair the protection to which we were entitled. I believe that in answering questions Ministers were permitted to transgress the will of the Parliament and to infringe the rights of honourable members. The Chairman of Committees is in fact the alternative Speaker. He is a very important dignitary. He holds a distinguished place in the parliamentary system. I do not believe that any member of the Country Party is entitled to hold such an important parliamentary office as Chairman of Committees. The Country Party represents only a small minority of the Australian community. Even the Liberal Party is a minority Party. It is a rump party in Australian politics. Of the forty-six Liberal Party members who sit opposite and who will support - perhaps not unanimously - the honourable member for Lyne, only nineteen were elected to Parliament with absolute majorities. More than 50% of Liberal Party members are minority members of this Parliament. The Country Party did a little better than its Liberal Party partner. I think only 8 of the 20 members of the Country Party are minority members. There are 59 members of the Labor Party in this Parliament, 46 members of the Liberal Party and 20 members of the Country Party. If the honourable member for Lyne becomes Chairman of Committees it will mean that the fifty-nine Labor members will have been denied justice because of the combination of minorities represented by the coalition Government. That does not give the Parliament the protection to which it is entitled. The officers of the Parliament have a duty to protect the decisions of the Parliament In the last Parliament we passed the following resolution:\n\nThat the area of land bounded by King George Terrace, Commonwealth and Kings Avenues and their southerly extensions and taking in the symbolic structure on the summit of the Hill be regarded as the parliamentary zone within which all development shall be subject to the approval of the Parliament.\n\nWhen we left this Parliament, we were emitted to expect that the officers of this Parliament would protect the judgment of this Parliament in this matter. Yet, we see operations going on here at the behest no doubt of the Government or of the National Capital Development Commission in defiance of a decision of this Parliament about the authority of this Parliament and about the very site of this Parliament Neither incumbent of the offices of this Parliament raised one finger regarding that matter. Therefore, I believe that the Country Party candidate, supported as he may be by a minority Liberal Party, ought to be rejected and that the honourable member for Hunter ought to be the Chairman of Committees in this House.\n\nMr FOX:\n\nHenty\n\n- Mr Speaker, I rise to support the nomination of the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) as Chairman of Committees. I believe that the office of Chairman of Committees requires competence, dignity, understanding and impartiality. I am sure that the honourable member for Lyne possesses all these attributes. In addition, he has the experience of having acted in the capacity of Chairman of Committees in a number of previous Parliaments. He was always firm and fair in his decisions. I believe that at all times he had the confidence of the House. I know of no-one better qualified to fulfil the requirements of this office. I am sure that the honourable member for Lyne will be elected to the position and I am sure that he will discharge his duties of Chairman to the complete satisfaction of every member of the House.\n\nMr Uren:\n\n– Mr Speaker-\n\nMotion (by Mr Snedden) put-\n\nThat the question be now put.\n\nThe House divided. (Mr Speaker- Hon. W. J. Aston)\n\nAYES: 63\n\nNOES: 58\n\nMajority….. 5\n\nAYES\n\nNOES\n\nQuestion so resolved in the affirmative.\n\nMr ERWIN:\n\nBallaarat\n\n– Knowing the miserable character of some of the people in the Opposition and knowing that false accusations can now more easily be made against me I asked the honourable members on my left and on my right to witness my ballot this morning.\n\nMr DALY (Grayndler) - I, too, wish to make a personal explanation. I claim to have been misrepresented. In the course of the debate a few moments ago I appealed to the honourable member for Ballaarat (Mr Erwin) to do as he did this morning and vote for Labor’s candidate. The Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) subsequently said that he knew for a fact that the member for Ballaarat-\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– Order! The honourable member will resume his seat.\n\nMr Gorton:\n\n– I would regard that remark by the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Daly) as being a personal reflection on me. I said nothing of the kind. I take the opportunity to speak now and give the honourable member for Grayndler an opportunity to withdraw the imputation he made against the member for Ballaarat without any evidence.\n\nMr Daly:\n\n– I am delighted that the Prime Minister will now let me speak.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– Order! Is the honourable member asking for leave to make a statement, or does he claim to have been misrepresented?\n\nMr Daly:\n\n– I ask for leave to make a statement.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.\n\nMr DALY (Grayndler)- by leave- In the course of the debate on what was supposed to be a secret ballot for the election of Speaker this morning, and the subsequent one a few moments ago I made a statement. From memory, I believe I appealed to the honourable member for Ballaarat to do as he did this morning and support Labor’s candidate for the Chairmanship of Committees. Subsequently I understood the Prime Minister to say that the honourable member for Ballaarat did not vote for the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Cope). It was a secret ballot. The Prime Minister could prove that point only if he himself had defected and voted for our candidate in the secret ballot. It is a good point, is it not, Mr Speaker?\n\nLet us get it quite clear. This was a secret ballot and no-one was supposed to know how anyone else voted. The Standing Orders demand this. So how would the Prime Minister or anybody else know how another member voted, if one vote was cast for the honourable member for Sydney by a member sitting opposite, unless he himself was that party? This is a strange situation. If the Prime Minister can say that the honourable member for Ballaarat did not vote for the honourable member for Sydney am I not entitled to say that the member did, because our judgments are on the same grounds? Neither of us knows how the honourable member voted. The only way in which the Prime Minister can disprove the statement I have made is by giving an assurance to this House that he himself was the defector, in which case I will immediately withdraw any statement made against the honourable member for Ballaarat because under no circumstances do I wish to do him an injustice. I am pleased to have made this explanation. The honourable member for Ballaarat assures me that he showed his vote in a secret ballot to others around him. It is strange that those who sit with a man of integrity and standing in the community do not trust him. That would not happen on this side of the Parliament. The point I make is that no member of the Opposition showed his vote to anyone. Opposition members are trustworthy men and they respect the secrecy of the ballot. If I have done an injustice to the honourable member for Ballaarat, I withdraw the imputation in the allegation. However I would like in return an assurance from the Prime Minister that he was the defector or at least that be knows who the defector was. In that way my mind will be put completely at rest and I will be satisfied that the integrity and reputation of the honourable member for Ballaarat have been temporarily salvaged.\n\nMr LUCOCK:\n\nLyne\n\n– Briefly, because of the time factor, but nonetheless sincerely, I would like to express my appreciation to the House for having been given the privilege of continuing in the office of Chairman of Committees. I thank the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton), the mover and the seconder of my nomination for the words they spoke. As I said on a previous occasion, the dignity of the House is not only in the hands of the Speaker, the Chairman of Committees and the Deputy Chairmen; it is also in the hands of every honourable member. In this circumstance, I suggest to honourable members that we give this some earnest consideration. Sir, I again express my very warm appreciation and congratulations to you on being elected to your high office and say quite sincerely that it has been my pleasure and privilege to have served under Archie Cameron, Sir John McLeay and yourself. I look forward to being associated with you in the 3 years that lie ahead.\n\nMr GORTON:\n\nPrime Minister · Higgins · LP\n\n– I wish to extend my congratulations to the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) on his election to this important office and, if I may, to congratulate honourable members, both those on the Government side and those on the Opposition side, on having obtained the services of such an experienced, unbiased and obviously excellent Chairman of Committees as they have chosen on this occasion.\n\nMr WHITLAM:\n\nLeader of the Opposition · Werriwa\n\n– On behalf of my Party I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) on being elected again as Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker. The honourable gentleman has held this office longer than anyone has in the history of this chamber. He has had very great experience in it. If you do not mind my saying so, Mr Speaker, where his rulings differ from yours we believe he is correct I can praise him in no more warm terms.\n\nMr JAMES:\n\nHunter\n\n– I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) in congratulating the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) on being successful in the ballot for the position of Chairman of Committees. It has been pointed out that the honourable member has had considerable experience in the position. I think we all agree that he has, but there was a time when he had no experience as Chairman of Committees just as the Prime Minister before he was first elected to his office had no experience of the responsibilities he now has. The Australian Labor Party believed that the nomination of the honourable member should be challenged. He has carried out his work with a reasonable degree of efficiency. On numerous occasions he has been firmer probably harsher than you have, Mr Speaker. I do not think he has ever intended to wound, but in discharging his function as Chairman of Committees he has done considerable bruising.\n\nI assure the House that I did not challenge him for this honourable position because he prevented me from wearing a safari jacket in the House. On the occasion I wore the jacket I had a skin infection and I was acting under medical instructions to wear light clothing. Far be it from me to challenge the honourable member for the position because of what might be regarded as a minor matter, although I was inconvenienced at the time. The honourable member for Lyne won the position by a narrow majority. He is not used to winning positions or political honours by narrow majorities and I am not used to being defeated for political positions by narrow majorities. Our electorates are not far apart but his constituents follow a different political ideology to mine, probably for similar reasons. His people rise early in the morning to milk cows and my people rise early to dig coal. My people do not enjoy sufficient of the sunshine that his people get. Down through the ages my people have rightly tagged their political affiliations to the Australian Labor Party so that they will be enabled to enjoy more of God’s sunshine of which the honourable member for Lyne, as a preacher, must be aware. Hence the difference in the political ideologies of his people and mine. He represents a very rich rural area.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n-Order! The purpose of the honourable member’s speech this afternoon is to offer congratulations and I suggest that the honourable member confine himself to this purpose.\n\nMr JAMES:\n\n– As a disciplined man, Mr Speaker, I will endeavour to abide by your ruling. The honourable member for Lyne represents a rich rural area extending from Raymond Terrace, through Taree to Kempsey where cattle graze peacefully, where the ground is permeated with natural humus, where mushrooms prosper and where a very lucrative industry could be developed.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n-Order! If the honourable member transgresses again I will ask him to resume his seat.\n\nMr JAMES:\n\n– In conclusion, Mr Speaker, the votes polled by the Opposition’s candidate for the position of Chairman of Committees were greater than have been recorded in this Parliament for many years. I am grateful to those who supported me from this side and to those on the Government side who would like to have supported me.\n\nMr ANTHONY:\n\nMinister for Primary Industry · Richmond · CP\n\n– As the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr McEwen), who is the Leader of the Australian Country Party, is temporarily detained I, on behalf of the members of the Country Party, should like to congratulate the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) on being re-elected to the position that he has held in the Parliament for many years and in which he has distinguished himself. He is a man of great experience as Chairman of Committees. This appointment entails his being your deputy, Mr Speaker. I know that he would find it difficult to emulate the excellence of your performance but I must say that on the occasions when you have been overseas he has shown great experience at the commencement of the day’s sitting by the manner in which he has read the Lord’s Prayer. On behalf of the members of the Country Party I congratulate him and wish him well in his job.\n\npage 26\n\nGOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH\n\nAddress-in-Reply\n\nMrFox, for the committee appointed to prepare an Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General (vide page 19), presented the proposed Address which was read by the Clerk.\n\nMr FOX:\n\nHenty\n\n– I move:\n\nThat the following Address-in-Reply to the Speech of His Excellency the Governor-General beagreed to:\n\npage 26\n\nQUESTION\n\nMAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY:\n\nWe, the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament.\n\nMr Speaker, in proposing this motion I should like to offer you my congratulations on your election as Speaker of this House.

The Parliament therefore had to meet by 24th December 1969 at the latest.\n\nFinally, in proposing this motion I should like to be personally associated with expressions of loyalty to the Queen. I am sure all honourable members are delighted that Her Majesty will be visiting us in the New Year.\n\nMr CORBETT:\n\nMaranoa\n\n– I second the motion and in so doing I associate myself with the congratulations offered to you, Mr Speaker, and to the Chairman of Committees. I also join with the mover of this motion in expressing my loyalty to Her Majesty the Queen.\n\nQuestion resolved in the affirmative.\n\npage 26\n\nPRESENTATION OF ADDRESSINREPLY\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– I have to inform the House that I have ascertained that His Excellency the Governor-General will be pleased to receive the Address-in-Reply at Government House at 15 minutes past 6 o’clock p.m. this day. I shall be glad if the mover and seconder, together with other honourable members, will accompany me to present this Address.\n\nSitting suspended from 5.26 to 8 p.m.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– I desire to inform the House that, accompanied by honourable members, I waited today upon His Excellency the Governor-General at Government House, and presented to him the Address-in-Reply to His Excellency’s Speech on the opening of the first session of the Twenty-seventh Parliament, agreed to by the House today.\n\nHis Excellency was pleased to make the following reply:\n\nMr Speaker:\n\nThank you for your Address-in-Reply which you have just presented to me.\n\nIt will be my pleasure and my duty to convey to Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen at once the Message of Loyalty from the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia, to which the Address gives expression.\n\npage 26\n\nPUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE\n\nMotion (by Mr Snedden) - by leave - agreed to:\n\nThat in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1913-1966, the following members be appointed members of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works: Mr Corbett, Mr Fulton, Mr James, Mr L.

The motion reconstitutes the committee with powers and functions similar to those possessed by the committee at the close of the last Parliament. In addition, it gives the new committee power to consider and make use of the minutes of evidence and records of the previous committee.\n\nMr Whitlam:\n\n– The motion has not been circulated.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– The Leader of the Opposition says that the motion has not been circulated.\n\nMr SNEDDEN:\n\n– It was circulated during the day.\n\nMr Whitlam:\n\n– A copy of the motion for the appointment of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory has just been circulated. We have not yet received a copy of the motion for the appointment of the Joint Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House. Where is the motion for the appointment of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aircraft Noise?\n\nMr SNEDDEN:\n\n– It is in the same terms as the other motions, with the exception of the motion for the appointment of the Joint Select Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House which includes the Leader of the Government in the Senate, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and the Leader of the Australian Democratic Labor Party. The motion was circulated. I am afraid that I am unable to put a copy of the motion in the hands of the Leader of the Opposition.\n\nHonourable members may not have heard the passage between the Leader of the Opposition and myself. The Leader of the Opposition indicated that he had not received the papers which had been circulated in my name. I apologise to him, although I think an apology is really unnecessary, because it was not within my power to arrange for that to be done. I see that copies of the motion are now being distributed. The Leader of the Opposition may be able to take the indulgence of the House for a moment while he glances at it.\n\nMr Whitlam:\n\n– I will give leave to move the motion for the appointment of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aircraft Noise.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– The motion has already been moved. The question is, that the motion be agreed to.\n\nAmendment (by Mr Whitlam) proposed:\n\nThat the following new paragraph be added to the motion: 9 (A) That the Committee have power to inquire into and report upon the development of major airports.’\n\nMr SNEDDEN:\n\nMinister for Labour and National Service · Bruce · LP\n\n– The Government is unwilling to accept the amendment. The House of Representatives Select Committee on Aircraft Noise was set up for the purpose of inquiring into aircraft noise. It was specifically constituted for that purpose. It has been operating for more than a year - for the better part of 18 months. It has contributed some reports. It is quite clearly a committee which should be continued in the interests of the resolution of business by this Parliament. What the Leader of the Opposition now suggests is to put in an entirely new term of reference which would have no relation to noise as such but which would have relation to the question of the building and development of new airports. While that is an issue which may be pursued by the Opposition at any time it wishes to do so, quite clearly it is quite inappropriate for this committee, which is a continuing committee, to have a major new term of reference added at this stage to the terms which ought to be continued. The Government will not accept the amendment and will vote against it.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n-Is there a seconder to the amendment?\n\nMr Charles Jones:\n\n– I second the amendment.\n\nMr Whitlam:\n\n– May I have leave to speak to the amendment? I moved it only formally, previously.\n\nMr Snedden:\n\n– Yes.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– Leave is granted.\n\nMr WHITLAM:\n\nLeader of the Opposition · Werriwa\n\n– I thank honourable members. The Opposition certainly does not object to the re-establishment in this Parliament of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Aircraft Noise which was operating in the last Parliament. This Committee was set up in the last Parliament on the initiative of the Government after a private member on the Government side had moved for a select committee to be set up to inquire into and report upon the development of major city airports in Australia. After the Government had moved to set up an aircraft noise committee the private Government member who had moved for this select committee withdrew his motion. Thereupon my colleague, the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones), moved in the same terms to set up such a committee.\n\nThe Opposition believes that the work of the Aircraft Noise Committee would be more fruitful, positive and constructive if the Committee were enabled to consider this extra matter which had first occurred to a Government private member and which had then been pursued in the last "
