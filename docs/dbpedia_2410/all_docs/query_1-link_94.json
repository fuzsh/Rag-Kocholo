        "text": "The next person to live at Mersey Bank is John Hall, or more precisely John Halls IV and V. JH IV descended from a long line of John Halls, for convenience this starts with John Hall I, the son of another John Hall, JH I lived between 1712 and 1761 in Scarborough, and like his son, JH II was a mariner. JH II married Mary Atkinson at Scarborough Parish Church, and they had around ten children, the youngest of which John Hall III (1773-1834) came to Manchester and settled in Rusholme and married Mary Dobson on 4 June 1800. In 1812 John Hall III founded an iron merchants.\n\nThis firm continues to the present day as Hall and Pickles, steel stockholders and processors with a HQ in Poynton. It is the only UK steel company never to have been nationalised.\n\nJohn Hall III died in July 1834 on Cavendish Street, Manchester and was buried at the Rusholme Road Cemetery, Mary survived him by 21 years and passed away in July 1853.\n\nJohn III and Mary had eleven children John Hall IV was a resident of Mersey Bank but let’s first look at some of their other children. There were five daughters: Anne (b 1805), Mary (1809-1873), Jane (1811-1862), Sarah (b 1812) and Elizabeth (b 1816). None of these married, and they lived with their mother in and around Rusholme eventually buying a property on Park Crescent a prime location in Victoria Park, Rusholme, living amongst such luminaries as Richard Cobden, Elizabeth Gaskell, Charles Halle, and Emmeline & Richard Pankhurst.\n\nAnne perhaps came the closest to marrying, she had been courted for some time by Mr Swanwick of the Bank of Manchester, but on listening to the advice of their uncle Andrew, in July 1836 John Hall IV pointed out to Anne the impropriety of such a connection, and the relationship was abruptly terminated, why such a relationship was unsuitable we do not know, but it may have something to do with Mr Swanwick writing to JH IV the previous June and raising the heaviness of the balance against me, upwards of £5000. John went to see him the following day and noted after clearing the matter: this is the first such complaint made to me of this kind, and very much annoyed me. John Hall III also suffered losses from a bank failure, and perhaps the family generally became wary of bankers in general.\n\nWilliam Hall (1803-1864) lived in Whalley Range and married Mary Elizabeth Bancks, the daughter of a Manchester Surgeon. His brother, Robert Atkinson Hall (1807-1840) lived on Greenwood Street in Manchester and traded as a Corn Dealer, John Hall IV reported in his diary of 1835 that his business did not do well. Andrew Hall (1817-1818) died in infancy. George Dobson Hall (1820-1894) married Frances James.\n\nThe two sons of JH III that did well were Sir Charles Hall (1814-1883) who trained in Manchester as a solicitor. His brother John Hall IV arranged for him to have an allowance of £280 pa (£36,000 in 2020) to support him in his studies, and he went to London in 1835 to read for the bar, entering Middle Temple where he worked under Lewis Duval, marrying his niece Sarah, and inheriting both his practice and fortune in good time, living at Duval’s House, 8 Bayswater Hill.\n\nHe became an authority on real property law and in 1873 rose to Vice Chancellor and was knighted. On walking home in June 1882 he had a stroke and resigned his Judgeship, dying on 12 December 1883. His son, Charles, also called to the bar, became a QC in 1871 and Attorney General to the Prince of Wales between 1877 and 1892. He was MP for Chesterton, Cambridgeshire between 1885 and 1892, and Finsbury from 1895 to his death in 1900. He never married, and spoke little in parliament.\n\nFinally we come to John Hall IV. He was born on 8 April 1801 at the family residence of King Street, Salford. and baptised at Cross Street Chapel the same year.\n\nHe took a keen interest in his father’s iron trade, touring the country taking in sites and enjoying the scenery. In June 1824 he travelled to Dublin, Newry, Belfast and the Giant’s Causeway, returning via Holyhead and watching the Chain Bridge being built on the Menai straits.\n\nThe next year he travelled he attended an Iron Master’s metting in Wolverhampton.\n\nOn 17 November 1825 he married Elizabeth Byfield at the Collegiate Church in Manchester. Not only was he a keen businessman, he was an avid reader, his diaries are full of notes about the books he has read. He established a reading circle with fellow residents of his street, Bloomsbury Terrace in Rusholme, Manchester.\n\nHe entered a partnership with Joseph Yates as Iron Merchants. Joseph was his brother in law having married Elizabeth Byfield’s sister, Mary, and he and his brother William were to cause him a great deal of grief over the next few years.\n\nThis partnership was dissolved in 1830 and he carried on trading from a property at 46 Port Street Manchester, but in 1833 became interested in the purchase of a warehouse at number 64 Port Street¹ from his old partner Joseph Yates and offered him £1,100 to buy it. The offer was accepted a few days later, on the 6 December with £275 payable immediately and the balance in installments over the next year and a half. The next day Yates came round to his house asking for the money due.\n\nJohn paid him the amount owing the following week and asked him to sign for the sale of the warehouse. Four months later in April 1834 the sale had still not been completed and his solicitor Mr Aston, of Kay, Barlow & Aston of King Street, Manchester, urged him not to pay any more money until he had a signed contract.\n\nLater in June, the issue was still troubling him, and he had long conversations with his solicitors and other parties. He was still determined to get the property and bought a lease for a wharf and buildings to the canal at Port Street for £100.\n\nPerhaps the delays had made people suspect he was short of money to complete the purchase, and Mr Owen in June 1834 offered to lend him £800 at 5%, which he refused, only to have Owen’s brother James offer Whether his reputation had suffered because as he had an unsolicited offer for a further £200 from his brother James, he discussed the matter with his father, noting in his diary\n\nMr Owens offer of a loan had not been my seeking but merely to accomodate himself I felt very indignant at this way of putting the matter…. I showed the letter to my father and took several days to consider my answer as I felt aftaid of being much too intemperate.\n\nHe replied, restraining his language a few days later, and declined the offer.\n\nNevertheless he was doing well, and on 30 June 1834 he drew up his books and showed a £3,000 (£385,000 in 2020) profit for the year.\n\nOn a personal basis he had other worries at the time, as his father was ailing and on 4 July he noted that he was increasingly indisposed with little chance of recovery, by 14 July his father had been fastened to his bed, and was in a violent state of delerium, the whole family began to return to Manchester to make their farewells, and he breathed his last at 6:35 PM on 17 July 1834.\n\nAs head of the family, he now had to arrange his father’s affairs and interpret his will. He was advised to keep the money in trust until the youngest child (George) came of age.\n\nIn August the second payment on the warehouse fell due, and James resolved not to make it until the deeds were ready. Yates needed the money – he was considering buying another property on Great Bridgewater Street – however had to give up the idea because no further funds were forthcoming.\n\nStill Yates came to him with more schemes, offering him for sale, 200 tons of pig iron in October, discovering five days later that the iron did not belong to him, but Mr Higgins, Yates’ brother William’s partner in Liverpool, and furthermore the furnace was out of order until after Christmas.\n\nYates’ cheek knew little bounds, he asked John if he could help him gain employment via John’s brother in law, perhaps as a confidential clerk.\n\nJoseph Yates had some other properties on Princess Street and Union Street in Manchester that John wanted, and John offered £500 (subject to other monies already advanced, and mortgages for them) at the end of October. Yates agreed to this, and even promised to paint the premises for him. John had big plans for these buildings, including demolition of one of these buildings to improve access. Even this hit problems, as the tenant was given notice to quit, and refused as his lease had not expired.\n\nHe spent most of January in discussions with Kay, Barlow and Aston, over the Port Street Purchase, the solicitors informed him much was John’s fault as he had released funds, making Yates indifferent to progress, most of March is taken up with John in constant contact with Yates, trying in vain to get him to sign the deeds, at one point Yates suggests he lend him £500 to pay back his clerk, from whom he borrowed the same, so he could fire him and employ someone else. John notes I did not take the hint.\n\nYet in April, John paid over net balance of funds due, providing Yates use it to redeem the mortgages he had on the Princess Street properties. Again a few days later he found that the sums had not been paid over, and he called on Mr Yates, who had the funds in his pocket, and had spent the day endeavouring in vain to find Mr Robinson to whom the money was owed.\n\nThis finally worked and on 16 April 1835 the interest was paid and the conveyance signed. John’s diary has a telling note. Remember never again to pay for any purchase, before the deeds are signed.\n\nNow the purchase of the Port Street property was settled, John confided his dream of one day being rich enough to build himself a house (which he nearly did in buying Mersey Bank) He looked at properties on Nelson Street, Upper Brook Street, and even as far out as Platt, near Withington in Manchester, where he was offered the land for a peppercorn of one penny, provided that the chief rents were kept by the owner and good houses were built. This offer he took up. He leased the land the following February at £5 per acre, a significant profit.\n\nThat 30 June he once more drew up his accounts, and found himself good to the value of £4,786 16s 11d (£612,000 in 2020) a substantial increase on his wealth of a year earlier.\n\nBy October, he has managed to seal the purchase of the Princess Street properties and celebrates by buying a silver service for £160 (£20,000 today) a dozen of champagne and some sherry, and throwing a 10th wedding anniversary celebration with his relations.\n\nOn February 3rd 1836, William Yates called upon John, and gave an explanation for his treatment at the hands of his brother.\n\nMr Yates’ haughtiness (to use the mildest term for it) to those around him during his prosperity cannot be fairly attributed to any one but himself and he is now sufffering for it in the “culls direct” and scoffs of those over whom he used to tryranize. His every word shows that he now very severely feels it. He certainly spoke to and of every one of the neigbouring iron masters as very much beneath him. They are now generally returning the compliment. This was the first time in his life that he had ever treated me with civility, and in consequence of his repeated enquiries concerning my family I invited him to my house , where he slept. In the evening, he again entered into long explanations in the presence of my wife and said that his conduct to me had been entirely owing to the statements of his brother who had always accounted for his losses in the iron trade to my incapacity. He had repeatedly said I was only fit to stand behind a counter, and had notions which totally prevented the profitability of our doing anything beyond a paltry retail trade. He had, however, found immediately on the dissolution between Joseph Yates and I that I increased the business twofold and he asked Joe for an explanation of his oft repeated accusations of me. He and his brother Joe are not on terms, but he appeared to wish to make me the mediator and requested I would , if opportunity offer explain matters to Joe. He denies that Joe lost much money by his loan….. and would not have lost any had he not been grossly stupid…… Very many other things came out, which strongly corroborated any previous conviction that I had been very shamelessly misrepresented.\n\nThe works on the warehouse were completed in March and April 1836 and on 28 April 1836 he hoisted his flag upon the warehouse. Yates however has not gone away, and on 2 July he discovers he has been trying to borrow money from John’s uncle, with whom he has a quiet word not to lend the money.\n\nAs well as being successful in business, John was a cultured and travelled man with a fine sense of humour. He notes of a visit to Southport on 6 June 1833:\n\nSouthport appears to me to answer the following description of a watering place sundry barren shingly sandy spots upon the coast, disfigured with frail lash and plaster bay windowed tenements, which being supplied with scanty white dainty curtains, a few rickety chairs and tables and some knotty featherly featherbeds are considered to be furnished. Hither numbers resort during the six weeks of an English summer, to ride in an improved species of wheelbarrow, drawn by jaded donkies or ponies, to sit on the pebbles and pelt them into the sea, to catch cold by walking on wet sands, to lose money in raffles – to enjoy at least one pleasant morning – that on which they return home\n\nThat September he travelled wildly in the Peak District, visiting Chapel, Buxton and Bakewell taking particular notice of Arkwright’s home and his spinning machinery, which he considered insignificant compared to what was now in use in Manchester. He then crossed the moors over pretty scenery to visit a steel works and cutlery showrooms, and proceeding to Doncaster where he watched the St Leger, travelling on to Fountains Abbey.\n\nIn January 1834 he took the Rover to London, arriving three hours late as the wheels had caught fire at Stafford (an excuse current TOCs have not yet used).\n\nHe visited the docks tunnel and remarked on Brunel’s curious arches\n\nThat evening he attended the theatre in Covent Garden. The next day he was however disappointed with Henry VII’s chapel in Westminster, and sailed from there to London Bridge, dining at Dolly’s Chop House and visiting the theatre at Drury Lane, returning the following evening at 8pm after a 24 hour journey home.\n\nHe notes in his diary of 23 February 1834 that he saw Mr Gaskell preach at Rusholme. In June he visited his family in Scarborough, seeing his sister there. He was there for five days, perhaps it was not a good visit, as he notes on the ride back:\n\nLeft at 3pm, arrived home 6am the following day. Never so exhausted as this, rode box all way. My wife observed she never was at any town where there appeared to be so many attorneys and there were so many bad smells. Are either of these the cause of effect of the other?\n\nNevertheless he returned to Scarborough on 4 July, walking as far as he could on the rocks at Filey with Elizabeth, who fell whilst trying to keep up with him, returning on the 10th as his father was ailing.\n\nHe was back in Scarborough again in August, to shoot sea birds off Flamborough Head, who he notes were very plentiful and very easily shot.* Returning on the 16th with his daughter Elizabeth, spending a day in York, visiting the Minster.\n\nA minor family crisis arose in October when his sister Jane visited and informed him that she had converted to the Church of England, and intended attending service soon. John managed to keep this revelation secret from their mother, a staunch Presbyterian as were all the rest of the family.\n\nOn 18 November 1834 at 9pm his son John (V) was born, with Mr Cooper the surgeon, Elizabeth Lea, nurse Mrs Mayfield and Ann Brotherton in attendance, John was baptised at home by Mr Gaskell on the 23rd.\n\nIn January 1835 he read with disgust the takings at Westminster Abbey from amounts charged to visitors – upwards of £1,600 pa, which he notes is a disgrace to the nation. I dread to think what he would think of today’s charges. That May he also commented on the boy racers of the day:\n\nI saw one of those foolhardy feats which men sometimes perform from bravado in the success of which there must necessarily be much of what is called luck, although they are by the public generally, set down as marks of first rate abilities, : this was ; a stage coach drawn by eight horses, driven from the box from Rochdale through the principal streets of the town , laden with passengers, and turned into Lacy’s gateway, at the rate of at least, nine miles an hour.\n\nHis opinion on the medical profession was not much higher, writing a week later:\n\nConsulted Dr Richardson, who as far as I could see was in much to great a hurry to pocket his fee, even to know what was the complaint of his patient\n\nIn June 1835 he and Elizabeth once more set out to London, this time on the Bee Hive they once more visited Drury Lane and saw La Gazza Ladra, by Rossini. The performers were Ivanhoff, Tamburini, Lablache, Grisi, Caselli and Brambilla.\n\nThey visited Covent Garden for the Opera the next evening as well as spending the day at London Zoo and on the 9th went to see Don Feliz in the Wonder, a comedy by Susannah Centilivre at the Haymarket, with Charles Kemble in the title role.\n\nThe next day there was another visit to Drury Lane to see the same company perform Puritani. More sightseeing followed with visits to Windsor Castle and a full day in the British Museum, travelling home via Oxford and Blenheim, which he considered to be in a sad state of delapidation.\n\nIn 1836 he bought a Grand Piano Forte, which possibly went to Mersey Bank, to rival the existing instrument owned by Samuel Oldknow at Heaton House next to the Bleachworks.\n\nHis sights now started turning towards Heaton Norris and Stockport, in 1841 he became a magistrate for the town, and spoke the same hear at the opening of Stockport Unitarian Church, for which he had supplied the land. It is around now that he may have moved to Mersey Bank.\n\nUnfortunately the only mention we have of him at the house, is his will, and a death notice on 1 October 1843, he was at the time once more on his travels, and died at Great Malvern in Worcestershire, aged 42.\n\nHe left all his possessions to his wife, Elizabeth, and his estate was valued at £25,000 (£3.2m in 2020).\n\nAfter John’s death Elizabeth moved back to Brighton Place in Rusholme where she died on 21 July 1853. We have her handwritten recipe book which will have been used at Mersey Bank for cooking.\n\nIt is full of Mrs Beeton type recipes for curing a haunch of mutton, stewing beefsteak, fishcakes, mackerel au gratin, ginger pudding, toffy, soda cake and Prince Albert pudding. Her recipe for horseradish sauce is below:\n\n2 tablespoons of grated horseradish, two teaspoonfuls of mustard, one of sugar. Mix together. Two tablespoonfuls of vinegar with a little cream to make it like salad sauce.\n\nBoth John and Elizabeth were buried at Rusholme Road Cemetery.\n\nThey had four children who survived, at least one other was stillborn. Elizabeth Byfield Hall, 1826-1912, lived out her days with her sister Mary Byfield Hall (1829-1921) who married William Thomas Marriott, a colliery owner from Wakefield. They lived at Sandal Grange, Sandal Magna, Wakefield.\n\nWilliam Byfield Hall (1836-1855) died at the tender age of 18 and was buried at Rusholme Road.\n\nJohn Hall V (1834-1895) carried on the iron merchant business at Port Street. He married Katherine Heald. We have met the Healds via Robert Parker, Thomas Coates and even seen them in their home town of Chapel with Henry Kirk. For that reason we will leave them till we visit them proper in a future instalment, save for a view of their house, The Grange in Hale, and a suggestion that John V’s son, John Hall VI was a little more succesful with banks than John Hall IV.\n\nWhilst his father aspired to building his own house and only owned Mersey Bank, John Hall V had the Grange built to his specifications.\n\nWould we have as much luck as the Halls did with money. John Hall VI (1870-1930) was so trusted by the directors of the Midland Bank that this tale is recorded in the Heald Hall history as written by Charles Brehmer Heald. He relates how John Hall VI was asked about the balance against him by the directors, however, unlike with the unfortunate Mr Swanwick, the Halls came out firmly on top.\n\nGentlemen, I owe you £50,000 today, I am quite prepared to pay but would infinitely prefer to borrow an extra £50,000 from you for another twelve months.\n\nSurprisingly , perhaps, the directors agreed at once. Thus began some 30 years of the special relationship between John Hall and the Midland Bank. Until his death, he was a unique client in that they would lend him any money he asked for with no security other than his own word that he would repay. The bank, it is said, still has a copy of his last loan of £50,000, and in the column headed “security” there is only his signature.\n\nA very canny and interesting family.\n\n¹ Another accountancy related fact, is that number 64 Port Street is attended cramming courses for my exams between 1981 and 1984, that property a 1960s construct is also now demolished, being now a car park.\n\n² The quotes from diaries are © his unpublished diary and other documents held in the Heald Hall archive at John Rylands library. As there are so many iterations of John Hall, I have tried to follow the family’s regnal designations of John Hall I to VI, although I have since discovered John Halls before JHI.\n\n³ The role of Don Felix in The Wonder, was the final swansong appearance by David Garrick.\n\nYes I do know Flamborough head is today an RSPB sanctuary.\n\n© Allan Russell 2020.\n\nBrew a mug of tea, this is a long episode. we will meet Heaton Mersey’s most famous citizen, even if he is only remembered by a few here, his name lives on in Ecuador. On the way, we will also meet the father of modern aviation -the first person to engineer a successful manned flight.\n\nThe Manchester Mercury of 8 June 1790 advertised for immediate possession, the seven year remainder of a ten year lease, of a house in the possession of Abraham Illingworth, a bankrupt. This was offered either for sale or to let.\n\nAlso on offer was a cotton factory and warehouse nearby, at the time operated by the unfortunate Mr Illingworth.\n\nMr Ilingworth’s bankruptcy proceeded in 1794, and at 11 am on 18 December creditors gathered at the White Lion Inn in Stockport to prove their debts, this was a long process, invoices did exist but they were hand written, easily falsified, and both genuine and false creditors would assemble to extract money from bankrupts, the temptation for the latter was a share of any dividend, therefore some documentation had to be provided to support any claims.\n\nAnother cotton factory owned by Abraham Illingworth, the Top O’The Hill Mills, on High Street, were subsequently auctioned on the afternoon of 18 February 1795 at the Crown and Anchor.\n\nAs a testament to the far sightedness of the Georgians it was let on a 3,000 year lease which had commenced on 2 May 1756, and of which 2,982 years were unexpired subject to an annual rent of £1-2s-6d. (£1.12½) for the house and £7-5s (£7.25) payable on the factory buildings. Furthermore, there was chief annual rent on the land on which all these buildings stood (covering 1,598 square yards) of £6-13s (£6.65) payable to the land owner James Goulden or his heirs and assignees.\n\nTop Of The Hills had a stable yard, the factory was 30 yards long and five stories high with ten rooms. The other part of the factory was 25 yards long, four stories high and six yards wide. It contained four rooms, which could hold upwards of 50 Carding Machines and 40 Jennies. Adjacent to that was an engine room containing a Patent Steam Engine capable of turning up to fifty of the largest carding machines. There was also a warehouse, fifteen yards long and five yards wide.\n\nWe know a little of Abraham Illingworth. He married Mary Hunt,who was born circa 1758. Mary was the daughter of William Roger Hunt and Elizabeth Foxcroft. He lived at Parrs House between February 1786 and 1790, after that we find him in 1792 on Great Underbank in Stockport in a house and Warehouse owned by John Lingard. moving that year to 2 Wallbutts on Higher Hillgate in a house owned by the Reverend Nicholson.\n\nBetween 1793 and 1804 he owned a cotton factory along with stable and house at Top Of The Hill. In 1801 he was also occupying space at Park Mill. His businesses were valued for insurance purposes at £7,100 in 1795¹, in 1793 he was declared bankrupt and such was the extent of the newly formed Stockport Bank’s investment in his business that it collapsed as well ². He had bought the engines for his factories from Boulton and Watt (a partnership between Matthew Boulton and Engineer James Watt) and it was these debts that had forced him into bankruptcy.³\n\nThe correspondance with Boulton and Watt is interesting. Between 1792 and 1793 he purchased two engines, the second of which never worked. In 1793 the account was docketed and B&W placed it in the hands of Mr Walker, the solicitor to the commission of bankruptcy. Abraham proposed in December 1793 that he pay off the debt in instalments and by the following November he had abandoned his plans to stay in business. The smaller of his two premises was mortgaged to the Stockport Bank, and he was planning to pay off his debts by selling the larger premises.\n\nB&W wondered whether if the creditors accepted the small dividend proposed it would invalidate their claim to the remainder of the debt, and as B&W held a lien over the engines, any purchaser could not operate them until their debt was settled.\n\nIn 1793 the assignees of the debts hoped that a London Bank would step in and take the larger premises, allowing for the larger engine to be paid for, however, this would place the assignees of the smaller premises at a disadvantage. In Abraham’s proposal to creditors of January 1794, the B&W lien was mentioned, which meant that nobody was interested in taking on the smaller premises.\n\nAs often happens in cases like this (and I am sure Stockport residents may remember more recent examples) there was a convenient fire at the smaller premises in September 1794. The contents were insured, but to B&W’s dismay they were undercut on their estimates for repair, and the job went to Bateman & Sherrat.\n\nIn the end, B&W did not accept Abraham Illingworth’s proposal to pay off his debts and the matter went to bankruptcy.\n\nCreditors were asked to gather at the White Lion Inn, Stockport on 7 January 1796 to prove the debts due to them from Abraham Illingworth and on 19 July 1799 his house on St Petersgate, together with its four stalled stable, plus the two associated cotton factories, as well as his house on Chestergate were put up for auction at the White Lion.\n\nAgain, generously there was a 3,000 year lease on the property, of which 2,857 were unexpired. Dividends on his bankruptcy were paid out in 1802 and still being settled in 1816.\n\nHe and Mary had upwards of fifteen children between them, at least five of which died in infancy. The paths of some of the children suggests that there was a certain amount of wealth in the family at the height of their success.\n\nOne of their daughters, Sarah Benskin Charlotte Elizabeth Illingworth was born around 1773 in Warrington. In July 1795 she married Sir George Cayley Bart, the 6th Baronet of Brompton, Yorkshire. They lived in Hertford Street, London, and Wyedale Hall in the North Riding of Yorkshire near Scarborough.\n\nGeorge is renowned as the father of aviation. He described in 1799 the concept of an airplane as a fixed wing flying machine with separate systems for lift, propulsion and control, he was the first to understand the forces acting on heavier than air machines.\n\nModern airplane design is based on his ideas, and the Wright brothers studied his works in great detail. He invented the first flying model airplane, and the first glider that could reliably carry a human in flight, this was demonstrated at Brompton Dale infront of Wydale Hall in 1853.\n\nThe name of first pilot is not recorded, but it is reassuring to learn that not all Victorians hurled themselves in vain from clifftops in avian guise.\n\nBaroness Sarah Cayley died in 8 December 1854 in London, and Sir George three years later nearly to the day on 15 December 1857.\n\nThree of the Illingworth brothers emigrated to Ecuador, Abraham Roger Illingworth, born in 1785 became a doctor and died in Guayaquil there, as did his brother George.\n\nHowever, if Heaton Mersey ever needs to erect a blue plaque to one of its former citizens, it should start with the man who in South America is revered as Almirante Juan William Illingworth Hunt Foxcroft, Heroe De La Independencia Del Ecuador.\n\nHe was born simply as John William Illingworth on 10 March 1786 at Parr’s House, Heaton Norris, to Abraham and Mary Illingworth, and christened at St Mary in Stockport. In 1801,aged just 15, he entered the Royal Navy and his first voyage was in 1804 on the HMS Venerable. For a naval man, this was not an auspicious start, as that November 24 he was shipwrecked off Torbay in a violent storm.\n\nBy 1809 he had served on a number of ships and was posted to a ship carrying General Arthur Wellesley (the future Duke of Wellington) to Lisbon and he carried out several operations in the Bay of Biscay capturing warships and merchant ships as well as attacking coastal batteries, under the command of Captain George Collier.\n\nHe was promoted to First Lieutenant in 1811 and assigned to the HMS Cornelia commanded by Captain William Fitzwilliam Owen. Here he participated in the invasion of Java and its subsequent capture, sailing through the Philippines and the Chinese Coast\n\nBetween 1813 and 1815 he served under Captain Sir Samuel Warren, blockading the Island of Texel off the Netherlands, and then in the Mediterranean until Napoleon’s abdication in 1814.\n\nThe extensive travel put him in poor health and he was given permission by the Admiralty in 1815 to travel to the South of France and Spain where he recovered and at the time became fluent in Spanish and French. On his return to England, Captain Warren asked him to serve under him once more, but he felt that the peace now prevailing over Europe did not offer him sufficient opportunity for promotion and glory.\n\nIn 1817 José Antonio Álvarez, from the recently established Republic of Chile, asked him to help carry sailors to Chile on the Rose to serve in the Chilean Navy. He did this by the circuitous route of travelling to Prussia in the pretence of seeking immigrants for Columbia, so as not to alert Spanish spies of the plot. Having successfully duped the Spanish, he sailed back to England and on to Valparaiso in November 1818. This was his first command.\n\nIn 1819 the Chilean governement bought the Rose and renamed it La Rosa De Los Andes and John was hired to command it in operations to defeat royalist opposition. During the next few months he carried out several operations against royalist elements in Peru and Panama. On one of these sorties he met and protected Vincente Rocafuerte, the future president of Ecuador who was carrying a large fortune in gold. Rocafuerte would never forget this help.\n\nAt the same time he learned of the campaigns waged by Simon De Bolivar and resolved to collaborate with him to gain control of Gran Columbia. October 29 1819 saw him take Guapi, which was the defensive centre of the Columbian Pacific front and by December had control of most of the coast of the country. He worked with General Francisco de Paula Santander who was Bolivar’s Vice President, and with the support of Chile he defeated Spanish ships which had attacked from their Carribbean bases and was able to control much of the Panamanian and Ecuadorian coastlines.\n\nThe Spanish then came in force and in one battle he received a wound to the side of his face, which in future years was concealed with a metal plate, giving him the nickname Silver Face.\n\nIn 1821 he was made Colonel in the Columbian Army and settled in the republic of Guayaquil, who had declared independence from the Royalists the previous year. He joined General Sucre’s forces and marched on Quito which he conquered in September. However, Sucre hit trouble in Huachi and Illingworth returned to support his general and regroup. They called in forces from Peru and successfully defeated the royalist army absolutely at the Battle of Pinchincha on 24 May 1822.\n\nBolivar then appointed him Civil and Military Chief of Guayaquil and shortly after he was made mayor as well. He proceeded to found a nautical school which continues to this day as the Admiral Illingworth Naval School.\n\nIn 1823 he went native, castilianised his surname as Illingrot and married a Mexican girl, Mercedes Décima Villa y Cosío, the daughter of Spanish merchant Vicente Décima Villa and his wife Maria De Las Mercedes Cosío y Villamar. He settled down and they eventually had six children: Juana, Carolina, Juan, Carmen, Gertrudis, and Vicente. They tended a ranch, Hacienda Chonana on the river Daule.\n\nHis retirement was short lived as in December 1824 he was called up to reinstate the naval blockade of Callao which had been lifted by Rear Admiral Martin Guise of England commanding the combined Columbian and Peruvian Navy.\n\nBy 1826 he had re-established the blockade, and in gratitude he was appointed Brigadier General by the government of Columbia and Rear Admiral by the Peruvians. He was even earmarked to liberate Cuba from the Spanish, but this never came to fruition, so he returned to Guayaquil where he was once more made mayor.\n\nDuty called once more in 1828 when Bolivar declared war on Peru. His task was to defend the port of Guayaquil from Vice Admiral Guise’s navy. Guise’s flagship ran aground and Illingworth’s forces fired cannon upon it, mortally wounding Guise. However, his deputy , Captain Jose Boterin managed to blockade Guayaquil for several months, starving them of supplies, eventually forcing them to capitualate on January 19 1829. Illingworth was forced to move inland.\n\nBolivar eventually recaptured Guayaquil in September 1829. A military tribunal acquitted Illingworth of any guilt on learning the full story of the battle.\n\nFurther trouble was to come in 1830 when separatist movements lead by General Juan Jose Flores forced separation from the state of Columbia and established the Republic of Columbia. Illingworth sided with Bolivar to preserve Columbia, but after Bolivar’s death they failed and he was banished to Peru with his family, the Flores government seizing his hacienda at Chonana.\n\nHowever his old friend Rocafuerte had power in Ecuador, and he allowed Illingworth safe passage back, to recover his property. He spent the next years devoted to the cultivation of cotton, importing gins from Europe, and steered clear of military or political activity.\n\nFlores was overthrown in an 1845 revolution when Illingworth accepted general command of the Guayas province and command of the army. He was part of the powers that brokered the agreement that oversaw the end of the Flores regime.\n\nPerhaps remembering his Heaton Mersey roots he established a brickworks as well as a foundry in his adopted town. On being appointed a deputy in Congress in 1848 he made sure that he received compensation for damages caused to his estate.\n\nHe was re-appointed deputy in 1852 but by now his health was failing, and he was nearly blind, and he retired in 1853, dying on August 4 that year. He was buried in the church at Daule.\n\nAfter his death, the National Congress ordered that he be honoured with a statue in Guayaquil detailing all his victories. However, lack of funds prevented this. To add insult to injury, the bishop of Guayaquil, with whom he had never been on good terms, ordered that his remains be exhumed and buried in the town square as he was Anglican.\n\nJuan’s widow successfully won an appeal against this, and Congress ordered a mausoleum be built, but once more lack of funds prevented construction, and his remains rested in a vault in the public cemetery.\n\nThis was put right as late as 2008 when the government ordered that he be buried in a monument in the Navy Park in Guayaquil. He was finally given the full military funeral he so deserved.\n\nMaria died on 18 June 1879 in Ecuador.\n\nNot only does our Heatons Hero warrant statuary and a naval school in Ecuador, he has streets and even a school named after him. He has illustrious descendants as well, not only the gentlemen pictured above, but noted Ecuadorian poet, journalist and historian Camilo Destruge Illingworth (1863-1929).\n\nI think Juan deserves a plaque in Heaton Mersey. I hope you do too.\n\nCopyright 2020-2024 Allan Russell\n\n¹ Fixed Capital formation in the British Cotton Industry 1770-1815 -Stanley D Chapman – Economic History Review Vol 23 No 2 (Aug 1970) P 257\n\n² Urban Workers in the Early Industrial Revolution – Robert Glen 2019\n\n³ INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION: A DOCUMENTARY HISTORY Series One: The Boulton and Watt Archive and the Matthew Boulton Papers from Birmingham Central Library Part 13: Boulton & Watt Correspondence and Papers (MS 3147/3/286­404)\n\nThe life of John Illingworth:\n\nPedro Pablo Figueroa, Album Militar De Chile (1810-1879), Tomo III, pages 192 to 200 , Santiago, Chile, 1905.\n\nBenjamín Vicuña Mackenna, Relaciones Históricas, Tomo I, pages 5 to 63 , Santiago, Chile, 1877-1878\n\nAlfred Orrell left West Bank around 1846. Our next inhabitant did not live in the house for long, as on 20 May 1848 the contents are placed up for auction in the Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advertiser. The auction taking place on 25 and 26 May. The house is to be let at the same time, being in the possession of one Mortimer Lavater Tait. A full description of the contents and order of sale is given in the article below.\n\nWest Bank at that date had a drawing room with large chimney, dining room containing Spanish mahagony chairs and table, a breakfast room, entrance hall staircase and landing, again with mahagony chiffonier and tables, kitchen and scullery, butler’s pantry a dressing room and six upstairs bedrooms. In the gardens there was everything the hi tech gardener would need including a Budd’s Patent Mowing Machine (invented by Edwin Beard Budding in October 1830 who wrote in his patent Country gentlemen may find in using my machine themselves an amusing, useful and healthy exercise).\n\nMortimer Lavater Tait was not staying, possession of the house was immediate after the sale of contents. He had been bankrupted and needed the funds to pay off his creditors.\n\nMortimer Lavater Tait was the son of William Watson Tait and Jane Danson. William was a Liverpool Merchant who had been born in 1771 at the then innovative British Lying In Hospital in Holborn, London – one of the first maternity hospitals. As befits such a birth, Mortimer came from a well to do family who lived at Livesey Hall in Wavertree. This house was in what is now Newsham Park.\n\nWilliam married Jane Danson (1781-1848) in 1802 in Bolton Le Sands.\n\nWilliam was a ship owner and broker. He had many branch offices and warehouses carrying out his trade between the West Indies and the European ports of the North Sea. During the Napoleonic wars he mistakenly captured a Dutch Vessel, believing we were at war with the Netherlands. William’s mistaken belief and a subsequent case at the Prize Court in Liverpool lost him a lot of money in compensation payments. Following that there was the failure of his correspondant in Hamburg, Herr Sonntag, due to levies enforced by General Marshal Davout of Napoleon’s army during the French occupation of Hamburg. This was unfortunate also for his daughter Susan, who had been christened Susan Sonntag Tait in his honour. All of this forced the sale of Livesey Hall.\n\nThe family moved to Manchester. He was discharged from Bankruptcy in 1811 and recovered as a businessman as in 1825 was appointed secretary of the Manchester Ship Canal Company.\n\nThis was the first attempt at a Manchester Ship Canal, not the second successful one.\n\nThere had long been a desire of Manchester merchants to have an easy route to the sea. The Mersey and Irwell navigation had partially solved these problems, but in the early 19th century Liverpool was not the major port it became, and most traffic went via the Dee. Parkgate on the Dee was the major embarkation point to Dublin and Ireland, and therefore proposals were made for the first Manchester Ship Canal from Parkgate, passing along the Cheshire side of the Mersey, crossing the Wirral Canal, through Lymm and Altrincham to Didsbury and onwards to Manchester where it was to end in Hulme by the barracks. The company was to raise £1m in 100,000 shares of £10. At a meeting held in the Old Exchange in Manchester it was resolved to build a navigable ship canal capable of bearing vessels of 400 tons .. and upwards to communicate with the Irish Sea direct from Manchester.\n\nNeedless to say, Liverpool was not impressed and the Liverpool Kaleidoscope expressed their scepticism on 19 April 1825, by invoking the Monarch of the seas – Neptune – to speak on their behalf.\n\nThe Monarch, indignant at what he called treason\n\nAnd contrary too, to the dictates of reason\n\nAdvis’d them in future to stick to their Jennies\n\nAnd in aping their betters not make themself ninnies\n\n“And as for your ditch there, why take it for granted\n\nMy protection in this case will never be wanted”\n\nClearly Liverpool’s sense (or is it realisation) of inferiority to Cottonopolis goes back a long way. The bill went to Parliament, coincidentally, in the same session as the railway bill for the Liverpool Manchester route on 21 March 1825. It eventually was passed by a Commons majority of one, but failed in the Lords.\n\nHis endeavours failed him once again, and in 1828 he was once again made bankrupt in another Liverpool venture. William died in 1851 at Robert Street in Ardwick. We would have to wait nearly 70 years for another Heaton Mersey connection to put egg on firmly on the faces of our Liverpool cousins.\n\nWilliam and Jane had at least twelve children. They were both extravagantly named and many well travelled, befitting their merchant father.\n\nThe first, Augustus Danson Tait died in infancy in 1803. Jane Sonntag Tait (1804-1882), named for the Hamburg merchant, was his second child. She first set up as a milliner in Liverpool but that did not succeed and in 1834 she married William Cawkwell (1807-1897) who went on to become the General Manager of the London and North West Railway.\n\nAugustus Henry Tait (1806-1883) married Ann Hogg and they emigrated to the USA, he died in Hastings New York on 19 December 1883. His brother Ferdinand Adolphus was born in 1808 and went to Brazil where he married Clara Da Silva Barbosa and had two children by her, before parting from her and marrying Elizabeth Trevilla Richard back in England, having five more children and emigrating to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where he died in New Orleans in 1860.\n\nThe next child Dover Ashurst Tait was born in 1809 at Livesey Hall and died in 1834 in Mehattan, Mexico.\n\nMortimer Lavater Tait was born on 28 October 1810 in Bolton Le Sands. He married first Ann Hood (born 1808 in Lougborough) at St Nicholas in Liverpool on 28 September 1834, and they moved to Manchester where they lived on Broome House Lane in Eccles in 1841, before moving to George Street, Manchester (now in China Town) in 1844, where he has an interest in a cotton mill on Mosley Street as well as something intriguingly called the Mortimer Tait Railway Company.\n\nIn 1846 we find him at West Bank with Ann, and he is running Heaton Mersey Bleachworks with Samuel Stocks (who had been in business at the same factory with John Stanway Jackson).\n\nIn 1847 this business failed and a fiat in bankruptcy was ordered, this forced the sale of the possessions at West Bank and the letting of the house, and he moved to a property he called The Cottage in Heaton Mersey. Whether this is a small cottage or a nod at a house the size of Alfred Orrell’s residence in Grasmere I can’t say.\n\nHowever, by 1854 whatever the size of his residence, he has overcome his troubles and is once again at Heaton Mersey Bleachworks, and he is living on St James’ Street in Manchester. Ann died around 1851 and on 24 July 1860 he married Mary Danson in Regent’s Park, London, and they settled on New Road in Heaton Moor. Obviously once more a succesful man, by 1857 he is respected enough to serve on the Grand Jury for the January Quarter sessions at Salford.\n\nMortimer continued his association with the Heaton Mersey Bleachworks into the late 1860s before retiring to Barrow Mount in Ramsbottom and then Bold Street in Heysham near Morecambe after Mary’s death in 1872, where he died on 2 March 1893.\n\nMortimer is buried at St John in Heaton Mersey together with both of his wives.\n\nThe next child born to William Watson Tait and Jane Danson was Constantia Elizabeth Tait (1812-1891) she married Dr Joshua Rowbottom, FRCS, at the Collegiate Church in Manchester on leap year day 1848. They lived together on Union Street in Ardwick. They subsequently moved to New Zealand, where Joshua died in March 1881 and Constantina moved back to her family roots in Lancashire.\n\nAlfred John Tait was born in 1814 and married Susannah Williams in Liverpool in 1836, but he died young in Manchester in 1845 aged 31. He was buried at Ardwick Cemetery.\n\nWilliam Arthur Tait (1817-1865) married Dorothy Maria Chester and they moved to Oporto where he became partner in a Port Wine Lodge, Rawes & Tait, before running it under his own name. Dorothy died in 1863, and he married Margaret Page in the British Consulate in Oporto.\n\nThrough the years the Tait label has undergone a few mergers, but is now sold under the marque Velloso & Tait, previously it was Stormonth and Tait, and supplied the necessary port to Ernest Shackleton on his expedition to the Antarctic.\n\nWilliams oldest son, William, carried on the family trade and purchased Casa Tait in Oporto, which today houses a museum of numismatics. William Jr was a keen student of flora and fauna, and introduced many plants to Portugal.\n\nArthur Fitzwilliam Tait (1819-1905) entered the Agnew and Zanetti Art store in Manchester aged 12. Agnew and Zanetti were famous for framing paintings by well known Victorian Artists.\n\nHe soon developed an interest in art and between 1845 and 1848 he specialised in lithographs of railway subjects. There are a lot out there. It is worth searching, I especially recommend Views On The Manchester & Leeds Railway.\n\nAttending an exhibition in Paris he became aware of the Americas and emigrated to New York and established himself as a professional artist, where he attracted the attention of the lithographers Currier and Ives (who are namechecked in the popular 1948 song Sleigh Ride) In 1858 he was elected a full member of the United States National Academy of Design.\n\nHe specialised in animal pictures and illustrations of the American West.\n\nBeing an artist he married many times, firstly to Marian Cardwell in Liverpool, then to Mary Jane Polly Bortoft in 1873 and finally to Emma Hough in 1882 and He died in Yonkers in 2006 and remains popular, one of his paintings sold for $167,300 in 2006.\n\nMaria Louisa Tait (1821-1870) died in St Pancras London, and finally Sarah Tait (1827-1827) died in infancy.\n\nReturning to Mortimer Lavater Tait, he and Ann Hood had eleven children.\n\nHis first son, Mortimer Dover Tait (1836-1918) emigrated to Australia and maintained the family railway connections by becoming a Station Master in Jondarayan near Toowoomba. He married Elizabeth Anderton shortly before emigrating He died suddenly, collapsing and expiring near Goggs Street in Toowoomba on 4 September 1918.\n\nMaria Jane Tait, and Harry N Tait died in infancy. William Henry Tait served in the Indian Army, gaining a medal during the Indian Mutiny of 1857-1861 (just four years before my great grandfather served in Agra in India). He returned to the UK to become a farmer in Heaton Mersey, marrying Margaret Hull, and dying aged 40 in 1879 on the Isle of Man.\n\nThe next two child Ferdinand Morley Tait died in infancy in 1840.\n\nLouisa Ann Danson Tait (1846-1917) married Thomas Newton Pearson a Heaton Mersey merchant.\n\nThe Reverend Herbert George Danson Tait (1846-1900) studied at Lincoln College in Oxford obtaining his MA in 1881 and becoming headmaster of Rossall Preparatory School in Fleetwood. He died of a heart attack whilst returning home along the sands on 14 January 1900 after performing divine service.\n\nThere were two Emily Jane Taits. The first was born in 1842 and died in January 1844, the second Emily Jane Tait lived from 1844 to 1914, and married her cousin Edward Paget Tait in Auckland New Zealand. They had three children and he died in 1903, Emily returned to England and married Charles Knight, and died in Blackburn.\n\nCharles Lavater Cawkwell Tait (1848-1891) was another to be associated with the Railway Industry. After marrying Hannah Walker Moore in Whitehaven in 1871, he became manager of the East Midlands Railway Company and settled at the Cow and Hare in Fakenham before becoming a railway traffic manager in Liverpool and dying in 1891 in Birkenhead.\n\nFinally the youngest Tait, Arthur Christopher (1850-1892) emigrated to Buenos Aires where he married Rudecinda Fonda and became a merchant. He had six children, two of which returned to England and were to die in their great great grandmother, Jane Danson’s home of Bolton Le Sands.\n\nMortimer Tait and his second wife, Mary Danson, did not have any children.\n\nWe remember Mortimer Tait these days in Heaton Mersey in Tait Mews, where Tait’s Buildings once were, where he once housed his apprentices for the bleachworks.\n\nCopyright 2019-2024 Allan Russell\n\nJohn and Sarah Philips had thirteen children. Their eldest son and child was John Leigh Philips born on 23 November 1761 at Longsight Hall and baptised at St Ann in Manchester. He worked for a while with his brother Francis in J&N Philips. On 23 April 1787 he married Caroline Penny and in 1803 he was given command of the First Regiment of the Manchester & Salford Corps, Britains Home Guard during the Napoleonic wars.\n\nLike his onetime successor Captain George Mainwaring he had a somewhat elevated view of his rightful position and declared himself Lieutenant Colonel Commander over all Manchester Volunteer Corps. This upset the established commander Joseph Hanson of the Salford & Stockport Rifles, who had authority from the Lord Lieutenant of Derby, and Secretary of State Lord Hawkesbury.\n\nIt eventually came to blows with a duel on Kersal Moor, where both men were arrested and released under caution that they kept the peace. This did not deter Philips who entered a lengthy correspondance with Derby and Hawkesbury, which he eventually lost, resigning along with all 53 officers of his regiment in a fit of pique.\n\nOn the positive side, he was an early adopter of gas lighting, introducing it to the family firm in 1803. He was also instrumental in the construction of the Manchester Royal Infirmary in Piccadilly, and he was a keen naturalist, his entomological collection formed the basis of what became the Manchester Museum.\n\nHe died on 23 June 1814.\n\nHe and Caroline had three children, John (1791-1835), Henry (1792-1818) and Nathaniel George Philips (1795-1831) Nathaniel was a relatively successful painter who was educated at the Manchester Grammar School. He settled in Liverpool, and exhibited at the Liverpool Academy and Royal Manchester Institution. His best known work was a series of copper engravings of old halls in Lancashire and Cheshire (Views in Lancashire and Cheshire of Old Halls and Castles, Intended as Illustrations to the County Histories) , he is therefore close to my heart on old houses. He died young, at his house in Rodney Street, Liverpool after a long illness.\n\nNathaniel George Philips, Portrait Of A Young Gentleman Seated, and Cluworth Hall, Lancashire\n\nJohn Philips and Sarah Leigh’s next two children, Nathaniel (1763-1763) and Elizabeth (1764-1768) died in infancy.\n\nHenry Philips (1767-1800) emigrated to the United States and founded the town of Philipsburg Pennsylvania. He married Sophia Chew in Philadelphia PA. in 1796. Sophia was the daughter of Benjamin Chew. Henry had gone to the USA to run the Philips export business in the newly independent country.\n\nBenjamin Chew and Henry & Sophia Chew\n\nIf you want to marry power, this was the right choice. Benjamin Chew was the head of the Pennsylvania Judiciary under Colony and Commonwealth, having been trained by Andrew Hamilton. He was a close friend of George Washington, and the Penn family. George Washington is said to have treated Benjamin’s children, as if they were his own. Sophia and her sister Harriet were his favourites. She was a celebrated beauty, and it was considered social suicide not to be at home when the Chew daughters came to call. Sophia’s niece, Sophia Chew Nicklin, daughter of Juliana Chew, married George Mifflin Dallas, who was Vice President of the USA from 1845-1849.\n\nHenry died in 1800. He and Sophia had one child, Elizabeth Henrietta, born 1797.\n\nThe next child, Ann Philips, married the Reverend George Hulme, and they went to live in Arley Regis, Worcestershire. Nathaniel George Philips (1770-1793) also went to the USA, to help his elder brother, but died young in New York.\n\nWe now come to Francis Philips, who was the next inhabitant of Bank Hall. He was born on 27 September 1771 at St Ann’s Street. The Manchester Courier in 1850 said this was one of the handsomest dwellings in Manchester at the time. He moved to Longsight Hall with his father, living there when his father had Bank Hall. He married Beatrice Aspinall on 13 September 1792 at St George in Liverpool. Like his brother John Leigh Philips with whom he went for a while into business, he was a supporter of the foundation of the MRI.\n\nHe was a good employer, some of his men stayed with him for 50 years, and the average tenure was 13. On the Coronation of George IV, his workers presented him with a silver salver.\n\nFrancis was a successful businessman, and was naturally against excessive taxation. He published pamplets arguing against the power of the council to tax excessively, but also, how this led to corruption and Manchester councillors lining their own pockets.\n\nThousands may exclaim without thinking What can an individual effect against the immence population of this Parish united But a moment’s reflection will convince them that in this free and happy country the legal rights of an individual cannot be overpowered by the influence of thousands and if the present Farmer of the Tythes can prove that the law entitles him to twenty thousand pounds a year twenty thousand pounds a year will he receive Such is the case in the Manor of the present Lord rules us his vassals……\n\n….let us turn to a few that have actually occurred within the period of a few years We had a very few years ago one of the best Flesh Markets in the kingdom it was centrical free from dust and abounding with safe avenues for foot passengers this excellent market has totally disappeared and in its place we find one of inferior size in a situation remote dusty and dangerously annoyed with carts But surely some grand object some public improvement led to the change So far from this being the case the old site is crowded with newly erected warehouses a bar to all improvement and with avenues contemptible\n\nBut there must have been some advantage gained which you don’t fairly state. Very true the agents of the Lord of the Manor then a Minor sold this excellent Market for his advantage at seven shillings a yard and bought one for the Town at Two shillings a yard or less and if the Town neglect to avail itself of the present opportunity of avoiding future greater evils we may thank ourselves if the next Lord of the Manor should sell the present plot and gives us land still more remote threepence or sixpence a yard.\n\nFrancis Philips “Murder Is Out or Committee Men Fingering Cash” March 10 1809\n\nThank goodness the current council does not favour unbridled development for their own advantage.\n\nHe was a skilled road builder , and became a trustee of the Manchester and Buxton Road in 1798, and in 1826 he designed the route of Wellington Road, Stockport, of course it was named after the revered Prime Minister. We overlook and curse that road these days, but never consider what a feat of engineering it is. The old turnpike through Stockport went down Higher Hillgate (by the Blossoms pub) and then back up Lancashire Hill along to Manchester Road where it now rejoins the A6 near McVities.\n\nStockport Johnson 1819, before Wellington Road\n\nFrancis built a road that bypassed congested Stockport, thus speeding up through traffic , but still allowing it to easily access Stockport centre. A new bridge had to be built over the Mersey, Wellington Bridge, with 11 arches and a 27 metre arch over the river itself. The cost of the road and bridge was £36,000 (£3.5m 2019) and it opened on 3 July 1826.\n\nThe new road gave weight to the arguments to build the Manchester to London rail route through Stockport, and therefore gave us our most important landmark as well as a vital travel and business link, which has served us for nearly two centuries, stopping us from being at the end of a branch line, feeding from the originally proposed route near Didsbury which was mooted to avoid the insane cost of building a massive viaduct across the Mersey Valley.\n\nThe Early 1800s were a troubled time in England, there were Luddite risings and the Napoleonic Wars had caused hardship as a result of the trade embargo raised against the France.\n\nThis caused unrest and poverty in the trading towns of the North. Parliament was consequently afraid to prorogue (in 2019, plus ca change) and adjourned daily.\n\nIn May 1812 Francis Philips went to London to petition the House of Commons, most likely to gain support for further action against the Luddites.\n\nOn Monday May 11, parliament was debating the embargoes, and a Liverpool merchant, John Bellingham, entered the Commons. He was a regular visitor and his grievances were well known to Parliament. It was a fine and warm spring evening, and the Prime Minister, Spencer Perceval had decided to dispense with his carriage, and walk from 10 Downing Street to the Commons.\n\nHe was late for the debate, and this caused some impatience, and a messenger was sent to hurry him up, he therefore quickened his pace and arrived at the House at approximately quarter past five. He entered the lobby but nobody noticed Bellingham approach the PM calmly and fire his pistol from close range into the chest of Perceval.\n\nThe Prime Minister staggered forwards a few steps and fell to the ground calling out, I am murdered, murder!\n\nFrancis Philips was next to the PM at this point and rushed to him, bent down supported him on his shoulder, by this time Perceval was bleeding profusely from his wounds, and he was carried by Francis and others to the Speaker secretary’s room where very shortly later he died in Francis’ arms without having uttered a further word.\n\nFrancis Philips cradling the dying Spencer Perceval, Bellingham is at the far right\n\nBellingham was immediately arrested, tried and convicted, and on the 18 May he was hanged at Newgate. Parliament immediately awarded annuities of £2,000 pa (£140,000 in 2019) to both his widow and eldest son, and erected statues to the fallen Prime Minister, whilst quietly reversing his unpopular legislation.\n\nFrancis Philips deposition to Parliament May 1812, Public Ledger & Daily Advertiser 13 May 1812\n\nJohn Bellingham’s descendant, Sir Henry Bellingham, now sits in Parliament for North Norfolk. In a reversal of roles he lost his seat temporarily in 1997 when Roger Percival, who claimed descent from Spencer Perceval, stood for the Referendum party and allowed Labour to temporarily gain the seat.\n\nA man with Francis Philips’ manufacturing interests who was seeing the tide of revolution and dissent sweeping the country, and who had seen at first hand how government could be shaken by such anger, was clearly not one to support the protests at Peterloo, and in 1819 he published An Exposure of the Calumnies Circulated by the Enemies of Social Order…. against the magistrates and the Yeomanry Cavalry\n\nIn this he acknowledges the dangers of rebellion he has witnessed:\n\nMy Lord Once and only once I had the honour and the gratification of an interview with your Lordship it was in the Spring of 1812 at a time when the manufacturing districts were in a state similar to the present less dangerous to the nation because less systematic but the external signs of riot of public plunder the seizure of arms the demolition and the burning of houses and factories the dreadful crime of assassination had extended farther no preventive measures having been adopted\n\nAnd continuing his theme, he rails against fake news, which is stoking dissent:\n\nAmong the distress inseparable from such events the people must naturally complain &c &c Extract from the Morning Chronicle of November 4\n\nTo the Editor of the Morning Chronicle\n\nSir-In your paper of the 4th instant we observe it stated that the weavers employed by and had their wages reduced on Saturday last and this measure is supposed to be the preliminary to a general reduction throughout the town Now Sir as we have not lowered wages nor intend doing so but on the contrary have advanced them we in justice to ourselves call upon you to contradict in the same public manner such an infamous falsehood and must require from you the names of the parties who furnished you with the information in question in order that measures may be taken to prevent the public being imposed upon in future by such unjust and improper statement Relying on you giving every publicity to this letter we are Sir your most obedient servants\n\nFrom An Exposure Of Calumnies – Francis Philips 1819\n\nIn 1824, on the death of his father John, he moved to Bank Hall with Beatrice. At the age of 53 he applied himself to his estate, becoming a keen agriculturalist, and if we may return to the plans of Bank Hall we saw last time, reimagined his estate as a country home, and designed the parks and lakes we saw in the 1848 plan. Compare 1819 with 1848:\n\nJohnson 1819 and OS 1848 – the change in 30 years is significant, The hamlet is no more, there are extensive and well designed grounds\n\nHe was still actively involved in his business, Pigot’s Directory for 1829 shows Francis Philips & Sons, Cotton Spinners and Manufacturers at 32 Cross Street and King Street. However, he was by now a wealthy man, and in 1837 he purchased the Abbeycwmhir Estate in Radnorshire.\n\nThe Hall, was built in 1834 by Thomas Wilson but Francis once more applied himself to the task in hand, carrying out several improvements and doubling the size of the house.\n\nAbbycwmhir Hall – Copyright Visit Mid Wales\n\nHe built a school for the locals, when he arrived the nearest place of education was six miles away over the mountains.\n\nHis last years were more peaceful, spending time at Bank Hall and Abbeycwmhir. He became Deputy Lieutentant of Stockport in 1841, and in 1843 the Chairman of the Trustees of Stockport Infirmary. He also like his brother John Leigh Philips a keen entomologist, and his collection also went to form the nucleus of the Manchester Museum, as well as possessing one of the foremost private libraries and print collections of the time.\n\nBeatrice died in 1844, and on the 6 May 1850, he passed away, of a severe cold, still an active man, committed to outdoor pursuits. He is buried in Didsbury. His son Francis Aspinall Philips succeeded him at Bank Hall, and we shall meet him next time.\n\nJohn and Sarah Philips’ next child was James Philips (1772-1774) who died in infancy. Elizabeth Philips (1775-1843) who we briefly met last time, as patron of the Ball in support of Stockport Dispensary, married George Edward Leigh at Kings Areley in Worcestershire on 4 June 1798, to become Elizabeth Leigh Philips.\n\nJames Philips (1777-1808) as another emigrant to the USA to support his brothers in business. He spent some time exploring the new country and published a book Exploits In The Wilderness Of North America, before setting up as a Flour, Sugar, Indigo and Tea Merchant in Philadelphia. His pretty boy portrait belies a man who explored the wilderness\n\nJames Philips 1777-1808\n\nSarah Philips, born Bank Hall 1779 possibly died in infancy, as we know nothing about her. Hardman Philips (1783-1783) did expire as a baby.\n\nFinally there was Thomas Philips who was born at Bank Hall on 24 January 1781 and died young in Liverpool on 13 July 1806, aged only 25. He had embarked on a pleasure cruise on the Mersey, when at 8:00pm a violent squall hit the boat as it was tacking into the George Dock Basin. The boatman, abandoned his post, grabbing a loose board at the bottom of the boat, sinking it immediately, Thomas was amongst one of three who drowned. He is recorded as being of an amiable and generous disposition, a manly heart, and irreproachable honour (which) led him to the paths of goodness and rectitude from which he never swerved – he was an ornament to society, and beloved by all that knew him.\n\nFrancis Philips was a man whose politics may not be in line with the accepted view today, but he was someone who tackled the same political dilemnas as we face today, and took an understandable line on them, given his experiences. He also created a lasting, if unsung monument to Stockport in Wellington Road. His other great work, the grounds of Bank Hall, are alas no longer with us, but we can visit Abbeycwmhir.\n\nCopyright Allan Russell 2019-2023"
