        "text": "That is a question I have asked since Kevin Lee died a year ago. I was suspicious about the circumstances of his death because of what Kevin Lee wrote to me which I have published below. Why did it take a year for me to publish it? Kevin wrote a lot of detailed personal information about Ray King, who he felt deeply betrayed by. He wrote about his women and children and it weighed on my conscience. Do I cut it out? It’s not his children’s fault that he was a womaniser etc… I have published it because I want people to know that Kevin Lee felt scared of being killed. The emails and direct messages (DMs) he sent to me on Twitter have been published in chronological order, from when we first wrote to each other.\n\nIt weighed on my conscience – do I or don’t I – for a year, partly because his family are obviously extremely private and devout Catholics. I don’t want to cause anyone any more pain or suffering. What made me decide to publish this, is that Kevin Lee reached out to a lot of people, including journalists. He wanted us to publish what he wrote, especially if he was killed. He asked me to. So I am doing it in honour of him, his wife Josefina and daughter Michelle. If they ever come to Australia I would like to meet them.\n\nSince his death I have happened to meet people who were in his congregation at Glenmore Park, people who are involved with Opus Dei schools, whose children he baptised and christened. Everyone I’ve met speaks highly of him, with great love and fondness.\n\nThe catalyst for publishing this was two comments written on my WordPress site by Monica O’Brien and Sue, a year after his death.\n\nHonouring Father Kevin Lee\n\nQuestions remain unanswered.\n\nMay Kevin Lee rest in peace, but may we know the truth about how he died.\n\nKevin Lee’s family and friends have been silent. Two of his brothers are police officers so I hoped they would investigate the circumstances of his death. Soon after his Memorial Mass, I rang St Mary’s police to speak with Terry but he was on leave. I asked for a message to be sent to him to ring me. He didn’t ring. They told me how I can contact him but I left it, I don’t want to push anyone.\n\nWere you a friend of Kevin Lee’s on Facebook? Somehow comments from before Kevin died were apparently removed after he died, but could be recovered from Facebook.\n\nAt Kevin Lee’s Memorial Mass I sat next to a lovely woman who said she’s Kevin’s brother Terry Lee’s friend. The Lee family were on the other side of the church. I told her I published some of Kevin’s writing and that he was very scared of being killed because of who Ray King knows.\n\nShe said he didn’t die in the typhoon, he died after it.\n\nI have never seen how close NSW police and the Catholic church are until Kevin’s memorial mass. Ray King was so prominent on the news and at the church. At the Memorial Mass, Ray King was with his partner, in the middle of the church near the aisle, in a prominent position. Being seen?\n\nKevin had the inside information on all of them, having heard their confessions. He said they’d be scared of him revealing police information.\n\nI was stunned when I saw the first news story about Kevin’s death. Of all people, The ABC News story had an interview with Ray King, in which he said, “it was “fairly reckless” for Mr Lee to go swimming during the storm.” Whose idea was it to interview the man who betrayed him on ABC news? That was weird.\n\n“Kevin had a choice when he went into the surf,” he told the broadcaster.\n\nhttp://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/2013/11/10/13/44/australian-among-philippines-storm-dead\n\nThis article describes Kevin’s “falling out” with Ray King\n\nhttp://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2013/priests-prove-a-bother-for-retired-police-chief-20130906-2tal2.html\n\nKevin Lee felt deeply betrayed by Ray King, I published his writing about it on this WordPress site before he died. You can read more of Kevin’s thoughts below.\n\nAfter he died, I rang and wrote to DFAT to ask to speak to someone.\n\nFrom: Frances Jones\n\nSent: Friday, 22 November 2013 10:42 AM\n\nTo: Foreign Minister 2013\n\nSubject: Father Kevin Lee\n\nI would like to speak with someone who knows about the circumstances of Kevin Lee’s death around the time of the typhoon in the Philippines.\n\nI was in close contact with him in the months before his death, so would appreciate talking with the person who knows the most about it.\n\nKind regards,\n\nFrances Jones\n\nForeign Minister 2013\n\nTo me\n\n22 Nov 2013\n\nFrances, I have been advised this is a consular issue.\n\nJames, who is the advisor responsible for this, will not be back in the office until next week.\n\nI will ask he contact you then.\n\nJeremy Leung\n\nOffice of the Minister for Foreign Affairs\n\nThe Hon. Julie Bishop MP\n\nP: +61 (0)2 6277 7500\n\nI spoke to Jeremy Leung. A case officer was appointed from the DFAT consul staff, ‘Claire,’ and she rang me on 9 Dec. I told her that at least the embassy could request Filipino authorities to investigate Kevin’s death by interviewing eye witnesses, to put people’s minds at rest. She couldn’t give a guarantee but she said she would pass her concerns on to the Australian embassy. Her number is 02 62611111 if you want to follow up and call yourself.\n\nShe said DFAT doesn’t investigate deaths overseas, you have to raise it with authorities in the country the person died in. Consular assistance updates families. “We don’t investigate deaths overseas. We refer people to family or you can go directly to the authorities. Go to the country the person died in.”\n\nNext I wrote to journalists at 4 Corners who made a program called ‘Unholy Silence’ about Father F, based on Kevin Lee’s book, which snowballed into the Royal Commission. Kevin Lee made enemies in the Liberal Party and the Catholic Church by speaking out. I sent journalists at 4 Corners all the emails and direct messages he’d written to me.\n\nWho was Kevin Lee with when he died?\n\nBelow is an edited version of what Kevin Lee wrote to me before he died:\n\nTony Abbott is Opus Dei make no mistake. I knew him from seminary.He was close friend of Fr John Nestor whom Abbott gave character ref for.\n\n12:27 AM – 14 Jun 13\n\n14 June 2013\n\nI know Tony Abbott is connected at the hip with Opus Dei and they have money to back his campaign\n\nAs I said I was considered a good chance of being a candidate poised for pre-selection for MacMahon (invited by Sen. Bill Heffernan to apply) and then told that Opus Dei people include Clarke said, “If he gets pre-selected we will veto or withdraw funding!!”\n\nI was not selected even though I delivered a flawless speech in exactly the 8 minute limit & answered all the questions I was given in twelve minutes while the other guy who was eventually chosen (my former best mate) stammered and stumbled for 12 mins in his presentation as well as messing up 2 questions! And also he is divorced with five kids to three women and they overlook that obvious morality flaw as well as other issues that will come back to bite them. As his best friend he told me about skeletons in his past such as Police Corruption allegation and AVO charge.\n\nHe was asked the question (standard for Lib preselection) “Have you ever been charged with an AVO?” and rather than deny or lie he said, “I have charged many people with AVO breaches.. he he” He told me this himself.\n\nThe Libs didn’t dig very deeply into his past but they put mine through the tea strainer.\n\nJust proves the duplicity to me..\n\nIts not a case of spoilt grapes, its the injustice of what is going on in Australian politics that really annoys me.\n\nSomeone close to me contacted me recently (well placed in Libs echelons) and he rang to empathise with me. He said, “Look Kevin, I know you are disappointed but its good you didn’t go into politics. It would destroy your ethical compass. You will sell your soul for votes..”\n\nWhile I don’t think I would have, I know I would have needed to..\n\nBlessings!\n\nKevin Lee\n\nAnyway, innocent or guilty he is Opus Dei and Abbott stuck his neck out to support an Opus Dei priest. How many others has he personally defended who are not? That would be.. none.\n\nI am not doing this to be malicious but responding now to constant critics of Opus Dei interference in politics which I am now convinced of (whereas before I was inclined to think is was based on misinformation). Even Ray King who now is running for Libs in MacMahon told me that I missed out because I attacked Pell. Little do they know, Ray hates Opus Dei with more passion than me and he will be doing his best to undermine them once he gets in.\n\nI will write something and send it to you, and you let me know what you think.\n\nAnyway, yes Josefina wants this to be my last comment on politics.\n\nBlessings!\n\n14 Jun\n\nI agree on both points.\n\nBy the way, did you see my other comments re: John Fahey and John Marsden?\n\nTim Priest (whistle blower cop) was editing my book but he withdrew because he said he had been seconded to the Royal Commission and thought his collaboration with me might reflect some lack of impartiality but he told me some stories about John Marsden and other priests whom he had locked up which shocked me. I could not write about any of them because I did not know directly of the information he gave. All the people I wrote about, I have known personally or lived with. And all my informants were prepared to give testimony to the accounts they gave to a court should I be charged with libel (which has not yet happened!)\n\nBy the way, I need to tell you (confidentially) I am not in the country & that’s why I didn’t call. Please do not tell anyone that because I have been threatened.\n\nPolice are aware of death threats and suggested I take strict precautions as the threats are not some silly Catholic fruitcake but Bikies. The threats were not scary because I have always responded by offering to meet and talk with the person (who never responded).\n\nAnyway, I will write something and send to you soon.\n\nBlessings and thanks for believing in me.\n\nReading your blogs has helped me to feel like I know you well and I trust you more than many other people who have spoken to me in recent times expressing support. Even some of the victims sound too much like they are ‘sussing me out’ to find out what I know.. you know, “fishing for info” rather than wanting to support me. I have had heaps of Fr Arthur’s scholarship recipients who have said I am “spot on’ about his interest in them sexually but they will not go on record saying anything because they took money. One is now a lawyer whom I knew as a kid. His parents are in touch with me and said they told Bishop Manning about what they believed was happening with Father Arthur and their son and he said he would investigate… Nothing happened. Now the lawyer said he doesn’t want to do anything about it, apart from confirm I am right.\n\nSo many like that.. Anonymous comments on my blog, or just phone calls (prior to me turning off my phone).\n\n15 Jun\n\nin my opinion Iverson was pure evil. I felt like I was in the presence of the devil each time I had to speak with him. He was an arch manipulator who studied psychology and hypnosis and employed both in discussions with people he was attempting to communicate with. There is so much more to his story that I didn’t write because he had so many disciples who would never accept that he was using priesthood to function undeterred as a predatory gay. He and Marsden were close. Marsden has so many skeletons. Being in the legal profession helped protect those secrets because everyone was scared of being sued even if they had true facts on him. Arthur Bridge is also part of that network. His biggest donors are legal firms (look on ARS Musical Australis website and you will find some pretty high level homos (not that there is anything wrong with that) who fund his enterprise, particularly his regular trips to the outback where he rips off the aborigines for their art and perhaps visits a few young boys whom he attempts to entice with scholarships. You see, the predators approach vulnerable people who will not be believed should they attempt to make an accusation. Imagine accusing a priest or a lawyer of paying you for sex when you’re an alcohol dependent indigenous Australian living in Alice Springs? But they had plenty of trips to the red centre when I was in the same house at Blacktown. As did other priests from overseas whom he invited. We even had foreign men who were not priests who stayed over in our guest rooms who were generously funded by him for no apparent reason.\n\nAnyway, I sound like a person who has a vendetta against him but the true fact of the matter is that they are the reason many young men killed themselves. If you were so poor that you would accept money to suck the penis of an ugly man, you would later start to experience feelings of self-recrimination. The satanic influence that surrounds these men who use Jesus’ message of love and peace to seduce vulnerable people to pleasure them for money, reeks of evil. The fact that these innocent victims end up killing themselves, (another ruse of Satan to convince a person to hate so much that they even hate themselves).\n\nYes I do believe in satan and his influence in the church which is why I feel so much more inner peace being away from the religiousity that was based on externals (like pomp, ceremony, ritual and ‘bells & smells’) and feel greater connection with the Transcendent being alone in prayer in a place like Assisi or in the Blue Mountains.\n\nSorry for rambling Frances, but thanks for allowing me to release all this suppressed frustration that has been building up while waiting for this Royal Commission to expose all the evil that lurks in institutional religion.\n\nBlessings to you on the part you are playing.\n\n…\n\nI prefer love stories to hate and hostility. I am writing a semi-autobiographical book at the moment which explains my romances and immaturity to make the decision for a life-long commitment to celibacy and then evades completing the story all together. I think its a good read. Much better than Unholy Silence because it will leave the reader feeling all warm and happy inside.\n\nIts called, “Being Good Enough”.\n\nYes you are right. Peter Williams is the other Anglican pretending to be a Catholic. The worst gay misogynist I have encountered. You should hear the disgusting comments he made about women in the time I knew him.\n\nYou would think that even if these men disdained women, they would at least respect them since they owe their existence to one.\n\nMy story is taking me much further than I anticipated. It is now 12 A4 pages long and while its not all about Catholics & Opus Dei, it really is an insightful look at how the Liberal Party operates and why I am no longer supportive (despite my previous attempt to represent them).\n\nAnyway, I sent it earlier today from the other email address tonight I got some messages on FB that are quite revealing… serendipitously from someone who was in the pre selection and voted for me!\n\nI will send our correspondence minus his name:\n\nJust recently (16/6/13) I found a message among my Facebook messages that was unread: (in fact I was searching for another message and found I have 10 unread messages)\n\nGreat speach tonight at the preselection. Very engaging, you had my vote don’t give up mate. March 14 10:22pm\n\nThen I wrote to the person:\n\nHi xxxxxxxx, I don’t know why I only found this message today. Its amazing that so many people told me they had voted for me at the pre-selection but I only got one vote. So you must be the one who told the truth. I don’t remember seeing your name on the pre-selection list. So what did you think of Ray King’s speech? What did he say that so convinced the majority that he is the best man for the job?\n\nAnd this was his reply:\n\n“Hi Kevin. I sat in the second row on your left. I was baffled why Ray King received the winning number of votes. Your speech was without a doubt much better than Ray’s. Furthermore the other candidates speech ( jamal ) was so painful to watch I couldn’t bare it. He couldn’t even comprehend the questions that were asked of him. For example, one pre selector asked him about the proposed changes to superannuation laws, and his response to the question ( after asking to have the question repeated ) was quote “superannuation is for people to put money into for their retirement”. Completely did not understand the question. Following that response there was a muffled chatting among people in the room. Yet Jamal was closely behind Ray. The meeting was stacked with Assyrian pre selectors and they would of voted for Jamal no matter what he said. Earlier than day an sms circulated to me from an unknown number that “we all must support Jamal”.\n\nAnyway, after your speech the was a brief pause before questioning commenced, and your speech was much less scrutinized than Rays or Jamal. I thought that was an indication you were a clear winner. I was shocked when the chairperson of the meeting announced you only received one vote ( my vote ). Ray mainly discussed his time in the police and he emphasised integrity over and over. There was no smoking gun which made him the winner or better. Than your speech. He was reading a pre prepared speech also. And almost lost his cool with the questions. Whereas you were very calm and composed throughout the speech and questions. It was very well delivered, clear and precise Kevin. Even the guy sitting next to me said “you smashed it”, referring to the high calibre of your speech. Yet he voted for Jamal because he had to. I say keep trying, maybe even at a state level?”\n\nIs it worth including this too?\n\n17 Jun\n\nThanks Frances, I swear its true. And yes I know nobody who is going to be happy to have their personal conversations quoted without permission. I am trying not to make this sound like seeking sweet revenge but it does. If you can suggest edits that will not make it sound so hostile, I would appreciate them.\n\nI know this is going to be big news and I ran the idea past a friend in the Labor Party who even disagreed with publishing it. His comments, “it happens exactly like that in our party too! I don’t think the public would want to know that though”\n\nI also sent something to Ray King to see how he would react to my disclosures but he has not replied. He’s still not talking to me..\n\nwhat do you think?\n\nFrom: Kevin Michael\n\nTo: Frances Jones\n\nSent: Friday, 21 June 2013 7:02 PM\n\nSubject: Re: Scared\n\nI was told he is hot favourite for Minister for Justice. No he wont go out of his way for anyone. He is all out for himself now. I was advised that the article is defamatory and needs to be toned down. Eg. remove Tony Abbott’s comment about trouble being faithful to his wife & Ray King’s girlfriends, current one not being divorced when they moved in etc.\n\nCan I just send you what I have now & See what you can do with it?\n\nI removed those potential defamatory phrases.\n\nCan I ask where you are thinking of publishing it?\n\nIs it just on your blog or anywhere else?\n\nI am hoping it gets greater exposure than just your blog. No offence but I hope it gets more readers… You know what I mean..\n\nBlessings and thanks!\n\nKevin Lee\n\n22 Jun\n\nThe Faceless Men of the Liberal Party\n\n________________________________________\n\nFrom: Kevin Michael\n\nTo: Frances Jones\n\nSent: Saturday, 22 June 2013 5:27 PM\n\nSubject: Re: Scared\n\nI told you Ive been on Lateline twice, didn’t I?\n\nEmma is always in my ear asking questions about who to speak to and asking who she can trust.\n\nShe is Italian too you know? … She is open minded and fair.

Although I used to get 1000 hits a day since I said it was my last blog and have not added anything, I’m down to between 80 – 200 hits. I left some of the stuff about Abbott et al in there but not the highly defamatory stuff..\n\nWhat do you think? Should I take more out?\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n22 Jun\n\nWell I never want to be rich or famous Frances. I always figured myself to be a St Francis of Assisi type without the habit. I think people who aspire to recognition or rewards are sadly deluded. The world is a big place and the best we can hope for is to be big fish in a little pond.\n\nI just want my story told, I believe in the truth and want people to know it too.\n\nI used to believe the Catholic Church stood for truth and justice but now I think it stands for power and global domination. IT has strayed far from what Jesus aimed for His small community of disciples to aspire to & that leaves me sad.\n\nI know that God wants me to use the knowledge I have to show that politicians are weak people who yearn to be strong. I see Tony Abbott as a weak man looking for power. I read the signs when I met him but I put them aside in favour of seeking to be included. After they sidelined me then I looked back critically.\n\nIts like when you are in love with someone you overlook their flaws (even though you recognise them) becos you like to believe in the charade, the narcissism in us sees them as contributing to our happiness. When we finally finish eating all the icing we see that the cake is hollow.\n\nI am happy to be freed of the desire for human affection so in answer to your final comment, I knew I would never make money out of this story but some help for the family would have been good.\n\nBlessings and thanks for facilitating my message being heard. I expect it will spread pretty fast..\n\nMe\n\nTo Kevin Michael\n\n22 Jun\n\nWhat you have just written there is what I wanted to put in. Could this be the first paragraph?\n\n“I used to believe the Catholic Church stood for truth and justice but now I think it stands for power and global domination. It has strayed far from what Jesus aimed for His small community of disciples to aspire to and that leaves me sad.\n\nI just want my story told, I believe in the truth and want people to know it too.”\n\nIt’s a summary and people often want to read a summary before they wade in to the depths.\n\nCould you shape it how you want it?\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n22 Jun\n\nI think that’s what I would say Frances.. thank you..\n\nI guess if I spend too much time thinking about ways of crafting the words they look their authenticity. I would be happy for you to use that as the opening, if you think it reads properly.\n\nThank you!\n\nMe\n\nTo Kevin Michael\n\n22 Jun\n\nThe Faceless Men of the Liberal Party\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n22 Jun\n\nit was good thanks for promoting\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n23 Jun\n\nYes I notice Frances but please delete some of the opening pics of me and maybe remove the opening paragraph becos it slows down the interest for readers… I know when I read it objectively I thought the intro was too long..\n\nOtherwise I’m impressed with how many hits you have received…\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n23 Jun\n\nyes im impressed how fast it got around.\n\nno one has contacted me yet. I expect on Monday to hear from people who are not going to be ringing to congratulate.\n\nin regsrds to thd pics I was thinking just one pic of me at Mass was enough. did you read my version on my blog? I just removed opening paragraph.\n\nThank you.\n\nive enjoyed reading responses on Facebook.\n\nlots of people antagonistic towards Abbott have seized it and reposted on their fb walls..\n\nwell done.\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n23 Jun\n\nneed to correct spelling Dai Le not Di Le sorry..\n\nMe\n\nTo Kevin Michael\n\n23 Jun\n\nOK I changed Dai.\n\nThe link to your book is still there in the paragraph starting “I made a big mistake when I lived in the parish house”\n\nIf you want me to make a more obvious spiel at the beginning or end, can you write it?\n\nI’m glad we took a week to think about it and I changed typos because it’s been reblogged so many times I couldn’t have made that many corrections.\n\nI need a break from the computer but lucky I have been able to retweet etc…\n\nI can’t believe this hasn’t been investigated by the media.\n\nObeid, Thomson, all that effort spent … meanwhile the abused kids….\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n23 Jun\n\nYes I agree.. I was going to suggest to make it truly yours, why don’t you write something as an intro? Its going to get significantly more reads tomorrow when people get back to their offices and have to time to read it properly (on work time!)\n\nI am so amazed why its not picked up by the media so far.. maybe they are asking for permission to quote it, checking the facts, etc.. but it surely will get some reaction especially when Labor start digging into that allegation re Ray King’s investigation at Wood Royal Commission. He does have some things to hide…\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n25 Jun\n\nJust wondering, what is MSM? I have read it a few times on tweets.\n\nI did know about media bias, but I didn’t know it amounted to media censorship.\n\nEmma Alberici asked me to send her that story before I sent it to you.\n\nI did & she never replied (after promising to call me the next day to discuss).\n\nAlso Caroline Overington.. went silent after being a daily communicator..\n\nand, the number of followers I have from Opus Dei people has just increased amazingly.\n\nI have had 84,000 hits on my blog in one year but today was record numbers.. A thousand!\n\nNot sure why but the Bishop’s researcher just followed me today but I am already followed by the Australian Bishops Conference..\n\nWell, good night Frances. I have been so amazed how we came in touch with each other and how your blog of my story has received so much interest (apart from mainstream media!)\n\nBlessings!\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n25 Jun\n\nHi Frances, Thanks for your insights. I know Caroline was reluctant to write my story. her editor called her and said, “Find that priest and get his story’ (C.O. told me), Did you read it in the Weekend Australian? It was long too but every one read it although few commented (except those who want to destroy my credibility). But I convinced Caroline in the end and she now says, “You are one of the most beautiful people I know but I don’t want you to be destroyed by the pressure you put yourself under, nor turn into one of the people you criticise” so I try not to. She advised me NOT To publish this story (but I know she is a Lib. she gave a talk to a Liberal women’s forum last year).\n\nI know she is friends with Tony Abbott and said that what I put was highly defamatory (but I thought I took out that bit about having difficulty staying faithful to the one woman?)\n\nAnyway, I hate talking about the one topic (sexual abuse) but I keep on being contacted by new people who want to share their story, The latest today as I said on Twit.\n\nI worry that’s its an obsession so I will limit my time online.\n\nAnyway, must get the housework done. There is a pile of washing up in the sink and ants everywhere!\n\nBlessings on your day!\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n25 Jun\n\nI meant to say, the Bishop’s researcher just wants to stay abreast of what I am tweeting.. they are scared. And rightly so, especially after I alluded to the theft by a priest in the Cathedral presbytery. There is a long and great story there!!!\n\nHe is worried I am gonna tell it..\n\nI think Ray King’s credibility will rapidly wane, but no one will see it in print.\n\nI guess the days of newspapers as the preferred medium of information and opinion are coming to an end.\n\nPeople get all their news now for free on Twitter and FB. I know I do.\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n25 Jun\n\nYou are right Frances, I hate the hypocrisy. The religious right are not righteous, they are like the Pharisees who condemned Jesus. They dress up and look proper and that’s why I wanted to tell the story. There’s much more I could have said about Ray King and who is backing him but they are dangerous people… even criminals. Let me just say this, Ray has many crims that he looked after. They didn’t go to gaol and they should have. He prevented them from being arrested. They gave him things in return, make no mistake about that. There are a lot of Assyrians who were loyal to Jamal who are now loyal to Ray. There is a factional split among them however so part of the group don’t want a police man (corrupt or not) being in power, they wanted one of their own. They are a dumb lot with no real education so Ray has then all fooled that he is intelligent and will get rid of Islamics (the enemy of these Christian fundamentalists). He is a total fraud. I knew that already but I was overcome with the whole political possibility to see it. He is also a dangerous man who has dangerous friends. The cops wont protect me. They are dirty on me for a few things too. There’s so much more to this story Frances that you and others will ever find out because in having that knowledge you endanger yourself.\n\nRay is silent because he wont dare sue me.. as he knows I know so much more that will damage his whole life and family too.\n\nHe is a womaniser and one of his girlfriends is an Opus Dei girl who has been poisoning him towards me (although he denied this for a long time). She was telling him stuff I was putting on FB and he was warning me not to put it.. I used to put pictures of him and me with one or more of his girlfriends and he was scared that another gf might see it.\n\nIf I published even those pics, his career would be finished before it’s started.\n\nI am actually waiting for him to beg me to burn those pics…\n\nIts with his Filipina girlfriend, Edna Ledesma.. she is the celebrity judge on Shall we Dance which is the Philippines equivalent of “So you think you can dance”.\n\nRay has been to Phils a number of times to be with her and he had her living with him in Glenmore Park while he was ‘technically going out’ with another woman..\n\nthe Assyrian woman he is living with now.. she was not divorced at the time he moved in with her..\n\nLong story..\n\nMe\n\nTo Kevin Lee\n\n25 Jun\n\nIs that why he was before the Wood RC?\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n25 Jun\n\nAmazing coincidence, while I was writing this to you I got a call here in the Philippines from an Assyrian friend of Ray’s who begged me to stop these attacks on Ray. He said, “Ray loves you, he respects you but what you are doing is very damaging” I said, “THanks for your call and for telling me” and then he said, “Promise me you will stop these attacks on him” and I hung up.\n\nHe rang from an unknown number and would not know the number unless Ray gave it to him so I know it was Ray who put him up to it.\n\nIt scares me that they know where I am and how to contact me but I wont be answering any phone calls now from the number +00 000. I have received calls from Ray when he was working and the same encrypted number came up. (that’s a weird number don’t you think?)\n\nMe\n\nTo Kevin Lee\n\n25 Jun\n\nYou can always tweet that sort of stuff as protection. They’ll stop if you do.\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n25 Jun\n\nWhat do you mean by Tweet that stuff..?\n\nNo he was at the RC because of allegations of corruption when he was a detective. He was given free meals (and drinks) paid for by crims at the Marconi Club. That should be on the public record.\n\nHe was cleared but there was no innocence involved..\n\nBy the way, the reason he hates Opus Dei is becos that Filipina Opus Dei girlfriend who lives in Woollara wont have sex with him until he marries her but he couldn’t get married until he got an annulment by the Catholic Church so I forged one for him.. again I am telling you more than I have told anyone else but you cant publish any of it (please!!!!)\n\nUntil we get someone willing to pay for it because I am realising now, its a story someone would want to pay for and to be honest, I need the money at the moment.\n\nI have no income and the book is just not selling.. One book a week at $10 a copy doesn’t go very far (but is enough here in Philippines)..\n\nBlessings!\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n25 Jun\n\nLook, i’m a bloke so I liked Ray in a blokey way. Also he was the police commander of the area I was chaplain so he opened some very big doors for me & I got a lot of respect I appreciated. but there were character flaws I saw and commented on, but at the end of the day, I am not his Dad and I was no longer seen by him as a priest with a right to criticise. He knew what I was up to.. but I did think he was like a teenager when it came to girls. Approaching his sixties he was trying to hold onto his appeal as long as he could. The Assyrian he lives with is 35 so it makes him feel younger.. she dies his moustache and treats him like a king.. (no pun intended).\n\nBut he also wanted to have the wealthy widow who is only 49 on the side, and marrying her was just for the physical side. I don’t think he intended to live with her.. He is very childish in that regard.\n\nPeople say I am naïve too, to think a 26 year old would love a 45 year old (when we met) but I wanted to believe it so I made it happen.\n\nOK I am paranoid so I didn’t know whether you might want to publish those comments without my permission.\n\nThere were a number of things I told Caroline when I thought she was not in reporter mode and she wrote them into her story. I never got to see it before she published and I regret some things that have upset my wife and family..\n\nAnyway, I do believe in honesty and all I tell you is the truth (so help me God).\n\nI don’t think there should be protection for people who break the rules when they are in positions of authority.. no mercy, I say for the politicians. We expect a higher standard..\n\nI better stop, I am raving.\n\nBlessings!\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n25 Jun\n\nShe and Emma Alberici were the only ones I knew… I would be grateful if you could find anyone who would be interested in telling the story on MSM.. he he.. I haven’t heard from Caroline since you posted the story. She is fuming with me.. Can you speak to Hamish for me please? I don’t want to sound like I am selling myself.. if you know what I mean? Thanks Frances\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n26 Jun\n\nYes you picked it Frances, he has PTSD, he drinks a lot, paranoids, and very OCD in cleanliness area. He was shot at one time and had a shotgun pointed in his face and he often has flashbacks etc.. You made a correct assessment. Not suited to public office. Which was what he agreed with me about..\n\nShe is fuming because I didn’t follow her MSM wisdom.\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n26 Jun\n\nI will do whatever I can to stop him. I am just wishing someone would publicise the story and make it bigger so the masses would know. Sadly I have been contacted by many Labor people who say, “IT happens the same here..”\n\nI guess the big Mass for Opus Dei tonight would have been an opportunity to make some mileage on the story but its gonna get lost in the resignations .. oh and a certain footy game..\n\nI will do whatever I can though.\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n26 Jun\n\nI did. even Crikey didnt get back to me. no one did\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n26 Jun\n\nWell, interesting day in Aussie politics. I watched it all unfolding and you could pretty well see how things would work out from this morning.\n\nMaybe when the dust settles we can work on exposing these Liberal frauds.\n\nYes I knew all that about Shorten. He is weak as water, sadly. No moral fibre and that’s why he wouldn’t support a Royal COmmission. To her credit Julia did and its only going to get stronger despite the attitude of the government of the day.\n\nBlessings on your day!\n\nHello (12)\n\nMe\n\nTo Kevin Lee\n\n25 Jul\n\nHi Kevin,\n\nI was reminded about your meeting with Paul Jacobs in the past few days. Do you want to publish that section on your blog. I think it would be great to sell it to a website which would pay you for it and have a wider audience, but I have no idea who you’d sell it to.\n\nIt’s been very interesting hearing about Brian Lucas at the Inquiry.\n\nIt’s interesting how Rudd is trying to get votes in the western suburbs with the asylum seeker policy. Did you do anything about Ray King’s background?\n\nBlessings,\n\nFrances\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n26 Jul\n\nHi Frances,\n\nYes I agree in fact, the whole story of Blacktown is worth publishing in a paid format. If you can facilitate that I would be extremely grateful. We are quite poor now with only 400 pesos (approx. $10) coming in two weeks. We sell coconut oil which we make (manually) in our land. Its all we get for 3 months until the next crop comes in.\n\nAnyway, that’s my problem.\n\nI was contacted by ABC who are interested in the fact that the Magistrate at Father F’s trial mentioned that my book names Father F & she was being pressured by lawyers for him to have me charged with contempt of court. My defence is that there are several websites that name him and Ray Hadley did it already on 2GB without repercussion.\n\nI know everything about Ray King’s background..\n\nWhatever way that could be useful to publishing and making some income I am open to.\n\nSorry if that sounds mercenary. I never contemplated this in the past but now I have other mouths to feed.\n\nBlessings and thanks..\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n26 Jul\n\nYes he asked me to write an article and submit, so I will do that. No I didn’t mention Ray King because he doesn’t follow so I cant DM him. If you want to suggest it to him, it might help me. Thanks Frances!\n\nMe\n\nTo Kevin Lee\n\n26 Jul\n\nI gave him your email address, after I asked you if that was OK, didn’t he email?\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n26 Jul\n\nThanks he did. He told me a researcher named Ryan was going to contact me but he didn’t. That was over a week ago..\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n26 Jul\n\nYes IA editor said he will contact me..\n\nthanks Frances. I wish I had more expertise in this monetising but I don’t and don’t have the interest in doing it at the moment. My time is limited on internet & I have so much practical things to attend to here (like pumping water from underground bore & carting sand to build retaining wall so our house doesn’t wash away in the heavy rain we are having right now..)\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n27 Jul\n\nYou are right. I worked out how to do it on my website (which I put up myself)\n\nI suppose what I was asking was whether you knew of sites I could “sell” my story to.\n\nI wrote something for Independent Australia & hopefully David will publish.. we’ll see,,\n\nI was hoping you might be able to direct me to what section of that story about Paul Jacob you think would do a stand-alone story for my blog?\n\nBlessings and thanks!\n\nMe\n\nTo Kevin Lee\n\n27 Jul\n\nIt’s the section called Internal Investigation. p170-174. I would use ‘Father F’ to save yourself any legal contempt of court issues.\n\nYou’ve written so much in your book.\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n8 Aug\n\nI’m thinking the same thing. I was wondering when someone was going to ask me to elaborate.\n\nBut as you have discovered in relation to Prime Minister’s lap dance.. its a men’s club in there and females who dare to criticise quickly find themselves on the outer. Its like the cops. When male police are talking about their sex life, showing videos even, the woman cops dare not comment or they look like they are not “one of the boys”. The culture in the cops used to be much worse before the Wood RC but its not much better. Its a little bit better.. it probably needs a Royal Commission into political rorts (eg. the guy taking a pic of his privates and sending to his GF). If she didn’t blow the whistle no one would ever have known but you can be sure these things are known. There are audits of each person’s expenditure. And hotels know. But they wont talk because they want the business. People in the cops and close to Ray King know about his rorting of the cops and the expense account he has..and the women.. it would not be easy to find out if they placed GPSs on cop cars but the cops refuse to use them!!! That’s why I say, its not much better. I could write a book on what I saw in my life as a police chaplain but I am sure I would be killed. There are too many people with too much to lose..\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n10 Aug\n\nThanks Frances when I said I am not going to write about politics or the church any more I wrote that for my wife’s benefit because she reads all my blogs and emails.. well she doesn’t read these anymore so I can tell you honestly, this is my mission so I cant stop. She is worried because she knows the threats are real. I expect any moment to be charged with defamation although its pointless because I have nothing that they can take and defamation does not carry a gaol term (it is always relegated to community service or some lesser bond). But I know that the public outcry from victims groups would be voluminous and help my cause if the pedophiles were ever successful in lodging a defamation case against me..\n\nYes they found me thru your blog so thanks to you the message was heard. They did a simple google search on Ray King and got your article..\n\nHe doesn’t know what is going to hit him and if you stop a fraud from getting into government you have already done a good thing.\n\nDirect messages on Twitter:\n\nAlso btw Bishop Fisher appointed OD members to his new staff replacing everyone\n\n04:26 PM – 15 Aug 13\n\nYou don’t realise how many of your readers are Opus Dei membrs who are very concerned that they dispel the truth of post\n\n01:55 PM – 16 Aug 13\n\nI can’t say at the moment sorry but just be satisfied that your blog has started an avalanche.. just watch it fall..\n\n03:28 PM – 16 Aug 13\n\nI am thinner & poor but no one is offering money for the story & I’m too shy to ask. No problems I am writing another book, fiction\n\n03:25 PM – 17 Aug 13\n\nsurprising too with all those reads, only two people came to my website and only ONE bought the book! 😦\n\n03:28 PM – 17 Aug 13\n\nAll the evidence I have on King is from emails he sent me. If its unethical to use I have no proof of what I claim. So am I unable to send?\n\n03:01 PM – 18 Aug 13\n\nI do value your professional advice. Will King try to kill me when his emails become public. He has some very bad friends.\n\n03:18 PM – 18 Aug 13\n\nSent emails that show his attempt to manipulate media perception with information he fabricates from council meetings & prove his infidelity\n\n03:21 PM – 18 Aug 13\n\nDon’t worry I have other fish to fry.. tilapia & bangus..Filipino fish for lunch. Enjoy your Sunday. Blessings Frances\n\n03:42 PM – 18 Aug 13\n\nI sent you an email. my blog it is called, Hell Hath No Fury like a pre-selection candidate scorned.\n\n02:16 PM – 26 Aug 13\n\nthe AVO was by the man who was sleeping with King’s then wife. Journos are looking for it..\n\n02:17 PM – 26 Aug 13\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n26 Aug\n\nThis is the blog I have yet to finish & promised a few journos I would hold off until they’re done getting some others to confirm what I told them..\n\neg. Ray King was heard at the Candelori’s restaurant fundraiser on May 10 telling a largely Assyrian Christian crowd, “I believe that Burqa’s have no place in Australian society and that immigrant “dole bludgers” should be sent home to their country of origin…”\n\nNow I can agree with that but you don’t say it if you want to get elected!\n\nAdd to that, his womanising as I have evidenced…\n\nAnd it spells disaster for his campaign. He knows what I am planning and I have been getting some scary phone calls that hang up. People sending me spam in bucket loads and abusive emails. All swearing that I am smearing Ray King and it wont be tolerated.\n\nI know he has some scary friends and I seriously believe he has everything to lose if this gets out that I tipped off the media which will embarrass Tony Abbott because he supported King without even knowing the facts (or believing me that I have the dirt that will bring him undone..\n\nAnyway, if anything happens to me, you will know why.. please get this published if you don’t hear from me by election day.\n\nMe\n\nTo Kevin Michael\n\n27 Aug\n\nOK Kevin, I’ve read it …\n\nOne tiny correction: I assure you, its enlightening.. should be “it’s”\n\nGod help you.\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n27 Aug\n\nWhy did you say “God help you” ?\n\nMe\n\nTo Kevin Lee\n\n27 Aug\n\nBecause he obviously won’t be happy and I don’t know how he’ll react.\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n27 Aug\n\nI am certainly worried how Ray King will react. I have been informed (reliably) that Ray told the Exec that I still intended to publish my book even if I did get pre-selected and that was the reason they asked him to proceed and not pull out despite asking him questions about his corruption allegations (which are true by the way.. he did provide security services while on duty for $100 a time as well as free meals and alcohol at Marconi club). The Libs knew that and still preferred him to me because I was going to upset some senior party members (Opus Dei) by embarrassing George Pell and Anthony Fisher.\n\nOne journo has told me he also has been spreading Islamophobia among branches by telling them that the Labor Party intend domiciling a number of Islamic refugees with questionable political interests as well as some they know to be carrying infectious diseases. He said he gained that information from his role as LIACON – (Officer in charge in the event of terrorist attack or environmental emergency).. not sure of the exact words for acronym, but that is what the role involved. He was taking notes from briefing meetings with council and fabricating facts that he was supposedly privy to. But it can be disputed. None of those things were actually discussed. He is trying to prove he is the only one really interested in protecting the community..\n\nThere is also evidence that he took information off police files that implicated some serious criminals. A journalist is working to unearth the evidence. I pointed him in the right direction to some cops who know Ray is dirty and don’t like him.\n\nBut let me say, if you met Ray, you would like him. He is charismatic and smooth (especially with women). When I told Caroline Overington about Ray she refused to believe me. She fell in love with him I reckon from the few meetings she had to get his side of my earlier story. That is why he was able to have at least 5, maybe more, women going at the one time.. And that I believe is his biggest foible.. and more likely to bring him unstuck..\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n28 Aug\n\nIts funny how the more I reflect on the sort of man he is, the more I resent his ability to manipulate me and everyone else in his life..\n\nHe made me think he was doing favours for me while he was actually getting me to be his personal trainer and counsellor.. he told me about all his women but only had time for me when he didn’t have some woman to be with.. that’s why I feel so nasty towards him now.. I resent being used.. and feel stupid for believing I had a best friend.\n\nThis is why I feel so determined to stop him achieving his goal by treading on me and others.\n\nI directed so many needy people to see him in recent months (after I had left priesthood and didn’t have the same access to a support network) and he brushed them. One was a guy (old man) who had been accused of acting inappropriately with his own granddaughter by the mother who was angry with the mother in law of the child. I saw it as vindictive behaviour and asked him to give the guy some advice of his rights and maybe direct him to some legal advice. Ray King just ignored his phone calls and when I pressed him about it he was dismissive saying, “the man is a creep, I reckon he did it”.\n\nI asked him on what grounds he based his assessment and he said, “He looks like the sort of man who would rape his own grandkids”. I was shocked.\n\nIncident number two was a Vietnamese girl whose estranged husband had been arrested for drug possession & she just wanted to find out what gaol he was in because she speaks no English & wanted to get rid of some of his stuff she had in her house that she suspected might be drugs.\n\nAfter several attempts to get Ray to contact her or even send some cops around to check out the suspicious bag, he said, “Just tell her to toss it in a dumpster”.. All too hard for this political wannabe.\n\nThose situations happened and I was unable to help them and was disappointed that Ray has no time to help these people because as he would say, “They’re nobodies”.. Well, now he pretends to care about nobodies.. That’s why it gets to me..\n\nAnyway, I was contacted today by Heath Aston and he has pretty much got the proof that Mr King has been doing some very underhanded things to get himself a job in ministry. May he be successful in getting someone who can corroborate it..\n\nBlessings to you for reading all this Frances…\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n28 Aug\n\nI think you will find that they WILL tell the story when they realise the scope of the delusion that is Ray King. He has been incriminated in some activity which may end up with him being charged by his own police! It was police who have dobbed him in for fabricating evidence… should be very interesting in the coming days..\n\nMe\n\nTo Kevin Michael\n\n31 Aug\n\nHave you heard from him lately?\n\nHe must be wondering what you’ll come up with next.\n\nI’m pretty sure he would’ve scored some votes with the burqa article and today’s one.\n\nYou sure you’re not trying to help him?\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n1 Sep\n\nI was wondering myself why people took those comments so positively (although I admit I find the Islamic dress code for women very male suppressionist) but the womanising article to come should put the proverbial (and over used) nail in his coffin..\n\nI had a chat with A Brewster today who is surprised that I am miffed about why they didn’t credit me with giving them Ray Kings essay.. They told me that if they did the story would become about Kevin Lee rather than about Liberal losing the election because they have nutty candidates..\n\nApparently him and Heath discussed why they wouldn’t use my name .. lack of independent credibility of their source etc..\n\nI must say I was disappointed..\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n2 Sep\n\nI have to tell you Frances, Heath & Anthony have been hugely disappointing.\n\nI have put a lot on the line by telling those dark secrets of my former friend, but they have downplayed it & even yesterday (despite Heath claiming he had my name as a source in the original information he sent to sub-editors who cut it out) Anthony told me “We feel it best to keep your name out of this because you don’t have any credibility now that you are a disgraced priest who got married and embarrassed the profession”.\n\nI gave some suggestions about what Anthony can ask Ray eg. relationship status and he said his moral compass is not something that he as a journalist would like to dig deeply into. He worried for his family etc. if they became aware their Dad was a womaniser.. Sounds like something a person with a bit of personal guilt would say. Men don’t like to shine a light on another man’s transgressions when they live in glass houses.\n\nAs I have alluded. I knew Abbott’s marriage was in difficulty from our conversation and that is why he didn’t mind that King is living with an Iraqi refugee. He has been told I am reliably informed and doesn’t have a problem with it.\n\nBut I do. I have a problem with Ray King being rewarded for throwing more dirt into my grave of credibility. Anthony & Heath asked if Ray or I wrote the essay and he flat out lied & said he was the principal author while not disputing that I “helped”. I told Anthony :ask him a question, he wouldn’t have a clue how to answer anything in that document’s contents.\n\nBut he shied away from digging it up. He said, He will just say you are suffering from spoilt grape syndrome. If we publish it, people will all just accuse you of lying and you are already on the record as lying about being a celibate man while you were in fact married.\n\nSo that’s where its at. I don’t know what happens from now..\n\nBut it looks like Tony Abbott and his lying faceless men win Govt\n\nHow about asking Hadley if King has been calling him & giving him information about private discussions with Liverpool council (inside info)\n\n06:48 PM – 02 Sep 13\n\nask him whats his views on adultery\n\n06:49 PM – 02 Sep 13\n\nwhat about relationships with 35yr old policing students who were Iraqi refugees whose family he broke procedures to intervene to help\n\n06:49 PM – 02 Sep 13\n\nand what about his official caution for his public criticism of lesbians in the police force?\n\n06:50 PM – 02 Sep 13\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n3 Sep\n\nOK I am still wondering whether I should .. I am so hesitant about talking publicly about his personal relationships as the fall out will affect his family and his current relationship I am sure..\n\nHe has already resigned from the cops, if he loses Saturday (and its because his credibility will be shot to pieces over my blog) then his family will be shamed, his kids will feel disillusioned, he may even suicide…\n\nCan I have that on my conscience..\n\nThe alternative is he comes looking for me to kill me…\n\nvery likely scenario endings..\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n6 Sep\n\nI’m disappointed in Anthony Brewster.. and journalists in general.. he took heaps of information off me.. he has been insisting to talk to me on Skype three times each over an hour and picked my brains on heaps of things…\n\nAnd then only told me tonight after I notice nothing went into print that he has been feeding it to other journos who have made a little bit of hay with it..\n\nHe said he still intends to use it after tomorrow especially if King gets elected.\n\nIt really annoys me.. my intention was to unseat him but they only want a sensational story..\n\nYes you are right. If he was in Labor they would have crucified him.. I got other journos (feminists) asking questions about his relationships but then apologised that no one would publish the story..\n\nSo many have contacted me since reading your blog but made me promise not to tell anyone .. I can list 6 people who promised I would get a story that would advance the cause of my book but one only resulted in bringing the book’s attention to the Magistrate in Armidale who has a gag order over the publication of the pedophile priest John Farrell’s name. Now I have been told that the Magistrate intends to take action against me!\n\nJust have to wait and see what happens.\n\nI’m only telling you all this Frances in case anything happens to me, you will know why and be able to tell the story.\n\nAnthony Brewster said I was “very courageous” to take on the Catholic mafia and said, I know you’re not scared of them Kev, but you should take precautions. I aksed for clarification and he just said, Just be careful, his press secretary (Kings) insinuated that its going to get a lot more dangerous for Kevin Lee. Lots of veiled threats have been received in emails and text messages and one Assyrian friends of Ray has been abusing me in phone calls. So I wonder what is ahead. ONe of my friends who is also a friend of Ray contacted me today by Facebook to ask me where they could send me a present for the baby. I have not told anyone my address but that was really suspicious to be asking suddenly when they never indicated any interest in staying in touch with me before. I may be getting paranoid for nothing but my wife tells me its easy for them to hire a person here to kill me because it happens quite often. About 3 months back an Australian from Perth who owned a resort was shot dead by a hit man & his death wasn’t even given a proper investigation.\n\nAnyway, I am raving on a bit. But just hope you would write something to expose it all if it should happen..\n\nYou have everything now and you are in the best position to draw lines between the dots.\n\nBlessings!\n\nMe\n\nTo Kevin Michael\n\n7 Sep\n\noh well, you never know, maybe it’s for the best.\n\nMaybe he’ll lose today and you wouldn’t have exposed him\n\nwhich might be better for his kids.\n\nI don’t know if I could join all the dots – chronologically etc…\n\nbut if anything happened I’d make all your emails available to journalists.\n\nTake care and enjoy your wife and baby when it arrives.\n\nMaybe people are genuine and you could ask them to send something via a post office.\n\nBest wishes to Josefina. It’s all very complicated for her…\n\nHave a good day.\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n7 Sep\n\nThanks for your advice. I am nervous about the outcome for Australia if they stupidly elect Abbott.\n\nThey don’t know what their real agenda is.. turn back the clock and put the foxes in charge of the hen house..\n\nLooking at all the cases of pedophiles that were discovered and then released without charge ALL happened under Liberal Government..\n\nMe\n\nTo Kevin Lee\n\n7 Sep\n\nHave you spoken to Kate McC?\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n7 Sep\n\nYes but I refused to give her anything. I told her its all in my blogs. She was so evasive as to what she wanted to use information for and wouldn’t email just wanted to talk on the phone (so nothing recorded). Until I read her article I had forgotten that Tim Priest had put Ray into the Police Integrity Commission for abuse of police powers. I remember them as bitter rivals but as Liberal Party members they became suddenly reconciled. Tim Priest gives Ray King a surprising lauding in his recent book too.\n\nMe\n\nTo Kevin Michael\n\n7 Sep\n\nCongratulations. I’m sure your writing contributed towards Ray King not being elected.\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n8 Sep\n\nThat’s what Anthony Brewster messaged me to say. He said he wants to do something about the Royal Commission. Apparently no one wanted to publish what he had to say about King even after he reckons he researched him for 2 months. I get the impression that Kate is Catholic based on the way she highlighted me being defrocked and saying I became adversarial towards King because he trounced me in pre-selection rather than admitting that he played dirty ball.\n\nNone of them would be his fan if they knew his personal life but now that he lost I am glad I didn’t have to post the last blog. Keeps his family pride as he withdraws from the public gaze.\n\nMiranda Devine is a nasty piece who thinks the world wants to know her ignorant opinions.\n\nI don’t like her but she does write well…\n\nKevin Michael\n\nTo Me\n\n9 Sep\n\nThe most vehement critics of a subject were once indulgers. (e.g. strong anti-smokers used to smoke.)\n\nI’m currently writing a novel (nearly finished) which shines a light into the rugby league industry & its moral-less culture but it will be promoted by former and current players who wont even read it to know its parodying them.\n\nI have forward by Mark Geyer (Triple M) & preface by Luke Lewis and I describe real situations I saw but this time I say its a fiction story about an imaginary character (me).\n\nTrying to get the editing done as we speak. Got a great cover design and people in the industry willing to plug it so I do need to be careful who knows what I am really writing about until its ready to go into publication. I was thinking of people who might write kind reviews without giving away its sting in the tail..\n\nWell I do worry for Ray’s mental health now. As I said he suffers from PTSD & drinks heavily. Not sure what he will do now without his job, his identity, an aim in life and his former best friend whom he didn’t know how much he depended on. His political mates and backers will soon drop off.. He will realise the other side of politics is quite painful emotionally.\n\nwhat about claiming to have brought up 5 kids while never living with them?\n\n06:50 PM – 02 Sep 13\n\nsays he is a family man.. how many families?\n\n06:50 PM – 02 Sep 13\n\ntotal fraud\n\n06:51 PM – 02 Sep 13\n\nI sent you an email Frances. Told them everything. They’re men.. not a problem to be a womaniser..\n\n10:58 PM – 02 Sep 13\n\nThey followed me too. but hey get this, I feel quite flattered, I got UNFOLLOWED by Tony Abbott..\n\n07:36 PM – 03 Sep 13\n\nI watched that 60 MIns episode & reading subtle body language it looked like she was acting the doting & supportive wife ala Hillary Clinton\n\n01:04 PM – 05 Sep 13\n\nI won’t quote but I thought it already..\n\n02:25 PM – 05 Sep 13\n\nI feel sorry for Tony & Ray because I used to think a lot of them both before. I can imagine their pain…\n\n02:25 PM – 05 Sep 13\n\nI know Photias. He is a total womaniser..He left his first wife (Janice) then next wife (Mela) He is now on his 3rd wife. Just like Ray King\n\n03:33 PM – 05 Sep 13\n\nDid you like my picture I posted of me with long hair ?\n\n03:07 PM – 06 Sep 13\n\nThat’s his Filipina girlfriend\n\n04:44 PM – 06 Sep 13\n\nEdna Ledesma, a famous dance instructor in the Philippines\n\n04:49 PM – 06 Sep 13\n\nim gonna make up I accidentally put that pic there\n\n04:49 PM – 06 Sep 13\n\nthought that was the best way to do it.. can google her. she is famous in Phils. He met her in a bar called Strums. She has lived in Aust.\n\n04:50 PM – 06 Sep 13\n\nI’m convinced the journos who have his story are holding onto it in the hope that he wins & they can break a bigger story: womaniser,antiGay\n\n05:23 PM – 06 Sep 13\n\nanti-Islam, xenophobic, PTSD suffering rabid Catholic cop makes it into Govt under a very tight media radar\n\n05:24 PM – 06 Sep 13\n\nHas some very Catholic friends, Mass every week & is in SVDP. One of his gf is Opus Dei & he made me forge annulment so she’s sleep with him\n\n11:32 PM – 06 Sep 13\n\nHe’s cafeteria Catholic, chooses what he likes from the menu & rejects the rest. He rejects morality & confession (conveniently).\n\n12:40 AM – 07 Sep 13\n\nHe was sleeping with a woman who came to him for police matters while she was married. She’s the one he cohabits with now\n\n12:40 AM – 07 Sep 13\n\nbut a journo who tried to corner him at his Glenmore Park home to ask questions said the Libs have relocated him to a secret address\n\n12:41 AM – 07 Sep 13\n\nthey were anticipating me tipping off media to his irregular relationships.His public status now has hampered his philandering significantly\n\n12:42 AM – 07 Sep 13\n\nYes Iraqi refugee’s family were in a police matter and he kept on dropping over\n\n12:42 AM – 07 Sep 13\n\nnext thing he is sleeping with their daughter. She was 32\n\n12:43 AM – 07 Sep 13\n\nArranged wedding but she wanted to get into the cops so she slept with him and he wrote her application and did some assignmentsstill failed\n\n12:43 AM – 07 Sep 13\n\nPrior to that he was with another Assyrian woman who had recently separated. She dropped him & he was suicidal. enter Chaplain Lee\n\n12:44 AM – 07 Sep 13\n\nHeath didn’t know these things before he asked. He was more interested in scuttling him over the microchipping & burqua stuff.. Yes Anthony\n\n12:45 AM – 07 Sep 13\n\nI feel Anythony is holding back..\n\n12:46 AM – 07 Sep 13\n\nThat didn’t send right. I said I am no fan of Rudd’s but he came across as well coached on Q&A. Abbott was a no show. But he lied to everyon\n\n12:49 AM – 07 Sep 13\n\nsaying he would not contest again.. but I felt Gillard had to go.. she was really on the nose..\n\n12:50 AM – 07 Sep 13\n\nBlessings to you Frances. Lovely as usual to chat. So glad to have your support. Josefina is due soon so not sleeping well..\n\n12:51 AM – 07 Sep 13\n\nBe careful of Tim Priest he is in the Royal Commission as an officer and he is gunning for me. He has my manuscript. Revenge for Ray?\n\n06:35 PM – 11 Sep 13\n\nIs has been given a govt appointment. He was editing my book & suddenly pulled out saying he had to distance himself becos of new role.\n\n11:01 PM – 12 Sep 13\n\nHe was a police whistleblower who lost lots of friends including Ray when he dobbed them in for corruption at Cabra re drugs. Ray said he’s\n\n11:01 PM – 12 Sep 13\n\na sneaky dirty rat who cant be trusted (which makes his comments all the more interesting). Ray warned me don’t get on his bad side becos he\n\n11:02 PM – 12 Sep 13\n\nwill hunt you down and revenge will be painful. This was when we were still talking. Tim fobbed me off to Oz’s Peter Kelly who stuffed around\n\n11:03 PM – 12 Sep 13"
