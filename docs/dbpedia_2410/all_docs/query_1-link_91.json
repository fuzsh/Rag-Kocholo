        "text": "A600KiloBear you sound like you haev been through a lot in life. I can only imagine the pain and hardships that you have and are enduring. But ask yourself this and if you struggle with the answer that means that you still believe there is master for this complex world.\n\nIf you truely belive that there is no reward and punishment than please agree to pass to me all the rewards for your good deeds past, present and future. And in turn you will take all the sins that I have and continue to accumulate in life. Its a win win situation. I win because I will leave this world with many rewards and no sins and you will lose nothing since after all you don’t believe in this anyway.\n\nSo can you please agree to give me all your rewards and take my sins?\n\nalbert einstein used “thought experiments” as part of his methodology.\n\nheres one for you:\n\nif youre not afraid of the truth take it seriously\n\nit just takes a minute, but you have to use some effort to really feel yourself to be in the situation:\n\nyou are in a locked booth\n\nthere is a large lever\n\nyou can pull the lever towards the left, if you believe that you were formed by the random motion of atoms and their components over billions of years\n\nyou can pull the lever to the right if you believe you were created by the planning of an intelligence.\n\nif you pull the lever to the side that is false, the booth will blow up\n\nif you pull the lever the side of the truth the door of the booth will be open and you will be set free\n\nif you do nothing, in 3 minutes the booth will blow up\n\nyou have no time for rationalizing, you can only do what your heart tells you\n\nreally try to experience this, dont just think about it, try to live it and get in touch with the inner you.\n\nWe are not going to have another long debate about evolution in this thread. If anyone wants to repeat the evolution debate please start a new thread or continue in General Shmooze2. This will be the last post about evolution in this thread\n\n“Even if evolution had been completley disproven (wich it most defenitly has not been! on the contrary just about evrey expert in the natrual sciences and evrey leading authority in the natrual sciences say it has been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt)”\n\n(This was last publicly updated August 2008.

And I agree it is a terrible middah.\n\nBut that is a separate issue. That is not the core of the problem. In my limited capacity, I can’t imagine that being THE cause here…\n\nI don’t mean to be nosy (not funny), but can we take this apart?\n\n1. You are an older single\n\n2. You live somewhere in the Ukraine area\n\n3. You value your privacy- extremely\n\n4. You have big questions regarding faith\n\n5. You are an intelligent & intellectual person\n\n6. You have been in this matziv before\n\n7. There is a major (bad) influence in your life which you mentioned you’ve walked away from in the past\n\nThis is all I (think I) know- I’m sure there’s much much more.\n\nTo tackle each point:\n\n1. There is a lot of stigma and pressure regarding “older singles” in the Jewish communities. THIS REFLECTS NO FAULT OF YOURS.\n\nEvery older single goes through big nisyoinos. They don’t win every battle, some don’t win the war. But Hashem DOES give the koiyach to win. It’s up to you.\n\nA lot has to do with perspective and emunah.\n\n2 & 3. Living in a secluded close knit Jewish community is what causes this “fish bowl” you describe. There is nobody else to rely upon- you only have each other. Moving to a metropolis of Jews will ironically offer you the privacy you seek- even though it may be more “closed in” or “crowded with Jews” or “narrow minded”, you will most likely be less “bothered”. And you will also most probably be very close to major business areas.\n\n4 & 5. GET THEM ANSWERED. You are not G-d (sorry). We all have questions- don’t let them fester until explosion time. Please.\n\nIf you find it difficult having deep personal conversations with a Rov and revealing your doubts, try starting online. There are numerous websites that offer “ask the Rov”. Shoot away- ask every question you have. They will direct them to the most appropriate party. And if you are not satisfied with the answers, that does not mean there isn’t a more satisfying answer available.\n\n** If it took you all this research, knowledge and time to come up with the question- then it will take at least that much to come up with the answer!\n\n6 & 7. I’ve taken the liberty to surmise that this person still has an effect on you; and that here lies the core of the situation. I can not speak further as I don’t have any other info regarding this matter. But if I am correct, then it is high time to remove yourself from this person’s reach and influence. You are only human and as such, you’re not above influence.\n\nDo with this post as you wish.\n\nAll I know is that we care about each other- yes- kol yisroel areivim zeh lazeh. I really believe it.\n\n– areivim\n\nBS”D\n\n6 & 7 – no, the only effect he has on me is that I found out just this past Shabbos what he is still up to, and well, put it this way, I don’t envy his oilam haba. Then I found out where his major donor stands and I don’t envy his oilam hazeh either.\n\n2 & 3 – no, I prefer this to NY or EY. If I had felt this way in NY I’d have just run away to another state, changed my name and that would be it. Whatever the problems here, there are many advantages as well. As bad as this is, NY was more of a fishbowl with every storekeeper asking me who I am, where I am from, finding out I am unmarried etc. Here I get everything except what is sold on shul grounds from an anonymous supermarket where a non-Jewish cashier scans my order, takes my card, hello, goodbye. No one looks in my cart, no one looks over my shoulder.\n\n4 & 5 – all ask the rov sites I have tried have referred me to – a live rov LOL!\n\n1 – whatever happens, happens. But I will not be forced into marriage. The pool of shidduchim for me is small and not appealing and it is not as if I can’t live alone. If it happens, it happens. If I truly feel happier alone, I will probably look to work in places where I can only be alone, and well, it will be unusual if I stay frum and alone but so be it.\n\nItzik,\n\nRegarding privacy, I can’t believe what you describe not to be an exaggeration. Every store owner, cashier etc.?? Why don’t they give me so much attention 😉 You must really stand out of a crowd 😉\n\nWhy is it NY, E”Y or the Ukraine… what happened to everything in between?\n\nSo they referred you to a live Rov- why not try it out? I personally find it much easier to “spill my guts” to an anonymous person than to someone I know well.\n\nRegarding shidduchim, who is forcing you into anything? You need to find the right one, not just anyone.\n\n“If I truly feel happier alone…”- do you believe that? You do not have control over whether you get married or not, but I don’t feel that’s the correct or healthy perspective. It’s a pronounced shrug. And we all know you didn’t really give up yet.\n\n– areivim\n\nPS- if you respond to this now, do not think I am ignoring as I need to step away from the CR, most probably for the night. Hatzlocha!"
