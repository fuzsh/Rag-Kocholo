SPEAKER\n\nElection\n\nThe Clerk:\n\n– Honourable members, the next business of the House is the election of a member as Speaker.\n\nMr CHIPP:\n\nHotham\n\n-I propose to the House for its Speaker, Mr Billy Mackie Snedden, the right honourable member for Bruce, and move:\n\nThat the right honourable member for Bruce do take the Chair of this House as Speaker.\n\nMr Holten:\n\n– I second the nomination.\n\nMr Snedden:\n\n– I accept the nomination.\n\nMr E G Whitlam:\n\nWERRIWA, NEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\n-I propose to the House for its Speaker, Mr Scholes, and move:\n\nThat the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) do take the Chair of this House as Speaker.\n\nMr Beazley:\n\n– I second the nomination.\n\nMr Scholes:\n\n– I accept the nomination. (The time for further proposals having expired)\n\nMr CHIPP (Hotham)-It gives me a great deal of pleasure to move that the right honourable member for Bruce be Speaker of this House. I do so with a great sense of honour. It gives me pleasure because Mr Snedden has been a close personal friend of mine since I entered this Parliament. I hasten to add that I do not suggest for a moment that a close friendship with me necessarily leads people to high office, and I do not rely on that ground for nominating the right honourable member for Bruce. I have nominated him because I believe he has outstanding character and the experience and the personality that would make him an outstanding Speaker of this House. I think he has proven beyond any doubt that he has character. Politics is an arena wherein there are many victories and many defeats. Mr Snedden has accepted the defeats and the victories with grace and dignity. He has shown enormous courage in adversity and his integrity is respected by all throughout the nation irrespective of their political persuasion. During his time he has undergone several ballots inside and outside the party room. I believe that today, Mr Clerk, you will not have to call for a photograph to determine the result of this ballot.\n\nIn addition to being fitted for this position by his character his experience is second to none in this chamber. He was the Leader of the Liberal Party and led the Liberal Parry after its first defeat in 23 years. I say without hesitation- I think I would have unanimous support- that a great . share of the credit for the extraordinary position that the Liberal Party is in today, with the biggest majority ever in this House, can be laid at Mr Snedden ‘s door for his efforts in rebuilding the Liberal Party after that defeat. He has been leader of the House of Representatives and, as I have also occupied that role, I know that that kind of experience and training is very helpful for the holder of the position of Speaker. He knows that you cannot always manage this House, which sometimes tends to become extraordinarily difficult, through the pure legal processes of the Standing Orders. Tolerance needs to be shown and consultation is needed with the Leader of the House on this side and his counterpart on the other side. He has had a distinguished ministerial career, among his portfolios being that of Attorney-General. His legal training will give him extraordinary insight in interpreting the Standing Orders. He is a Privy Councillor.\n\nThe third thing is his personality. He has shown through the years, as a friend of mine and as a friend of many people in this House, tolerance that I think is a vital quality for a person who is to be the Speaker. He is a very approachable man and I am sure he is the sort of person to give the 34 new faces in this place, the new members, every help and encouragement. He also has a sense of humour and that is absolutely vital for a person in the position of Speaker. However I do implore him not to have his nose broken again if he plays squash any more with any Ministers because the sight of a Speaker with his nose in plaster under the wig he threatens to wear might well test our sense of humour.\n\nI believe that the Parliament needs such a man as the right honourable member for Bruce. This country is in a crisis state. The dignity of the Parliament needs to be restored and it can be restored only by a man who will command respect. Parliamentarians speak in this place and on television about the dignity of Parliament and say that politicians must be respected but that dignity and respect should be shown here. Sometimes I cringe when I see school children in the gallery during some of the behaviour that occurs in this House. Respect cannot be demanded, it must be earned, and we as members of the thirtieth Parliament have to earn that respect. There is a place in this House for interjection at the right time and sometimes our tempers become heated. Therefore the office of Speaker needs a man of tolerance, character and integrity. I suggest that Mr Snedden is such a man and I have pleasure in nominating him.\n\nMr HOLTEN:\n\nIndi\n\n-I am honoured and privileged to second this motion on behalf of the National Country Party. I also am very pleased in a personal sense to second the motion that the right honourable Bill Snedden be elected to the office of Speaker of this House, a motion so capably moved by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp). One of the main reasons it gives me pleasure is that I have always had a strong personal respect for Mr Snedden as a man. Like the honourable member for Hotham, I regard Mr Snedden as a personal friend but this will not influence him at all in any treatment that he might give when he is elected Speaker. He commands my respect for the way in which he has carried out his duties as a member of this House during the 17 years that I have had the opportunity of seeing him in action in this House. I believe that all fair-minded members of this House would agree that the right honourable Bill Snedden has conducted himself as a very able member of Parliament and has handled the hurly burly of debate in a calm, effective and dignified manner. I am sure that these qualities will be displayed in his important position as Speaker of the House. His ability cannot be questioned, as the list of the offices he has held and which were detailed by the honourable member for Hotham will show.\n\nI endorse strongly the personal tributes that were paid by the mover of the motion to the right honourable Bill Snedden. He has been an outstanding all-rounder in his lifetime. He has been a great community worker, a great member of Parliament, a great parent and a great sportsman. I am confident he will discharge his duties without fear or favour. I am sure he will always reach his decisions on the grounds of fairness and regard for the Standing Orders, and for the dignity and decorum of this House. I am sure that the right honourable Bill Snedden will be a fine Speaker. In conclusion, I offer him my personal co-operation. I am sure all members of the National Country Party will do the same and will support this motion unanimously. I formally second the motion.\n\nMr E. G. WHITLAM (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition)- It is appropriate that the first motion I move in this Parliament, like my last motion in the old Parliament should concern the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). On the last occasion I spoke he was Speaker. He was entrusted by honourable members with a task of unprecedented importance for the institution of Parliament and for the future of Australian democracy. By the manner in which he discharged that task- by the manner in which he carried out his duties, throughout his term as Speaker and during the gravest crisis ever confronted by the Parliament- the honourable member brought credit and dignity to his office, and earned, as no Speaker has before him, the right to continue in the chair. During the events of 1 1 November- momentous for the Parliament, for the strength and vitality of our democratic institutions, for Australia’s reputation in the worldthe honourable member for Corio emerged as a true and valiant defender of the rights of Parliament. No higher praise can be given to a Speaker. Mr Speaker Scholes upheld the ancient traditions of his office and discharged the primary function for which that office was created. He stood firm in defence of the people’s House against a challenge to its authority, first from the Senate, and subsequently from the representative of the Crown itself.\n\nOn the afternoon of 1 1 November Mr Scholes was directed by the House to wait upon the Governor-General and convey to him the views of this House- its want of confidence in the installed Prime Minister and its wish that the leader of the Party commanding a majority in the people’s House be called upon once more to form a Government. It is no fault of the honourable member for Corio that his message went unheeded and unheard, that the Governor-General refused to see him until after the dissolution of Parliament was proclaimed, that the Speaker was insulted by the representative of the Queen, and that the office of Speaker and all the rights and privileges it embodies were treated with contempt. After the coup d’etat Mr Speaker Scholes was the only member of this House to retain office with the approval of the House. He did not rest in his endeavours to redress the wrong that was done to this institution and to defend the rights of honourable members. He wrote promptly to the Queen expressing his concern at the events of 1 1 November. He elicited from Her Majesty a response to the effect that if the Queen’s representative chose to abuse his powers there was nothing she could do about it and nothing we could do about it. That response was proper, and doubtless, I regret to say, it was accurate.\n\nThe rights of the Australian Parliament in relation to the Crown remain unclear. The reserve powers of the representative of the Crown in Australia remain unchallenged. Powers that the American people rejected in 1776 survive in Australia in 1976. Sooner or later those powers must be curtailed if parliamentary democracy in this country is to flourish in full measure. The record will show that Mr Speaker Scholes took his stand in defence of the great central principle of our system of governmentthat the will of the people resides in this, the people’s House, and in this House alone. For the record and for the information of honourable members I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the correspondence between Her Majesty and Mr Speaker Scholes.\n\nThe Clerk:\n\n– Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. (The documents read as follows)-\n\nSpeaker’s Office\n\nHouse of Representatives\n\nCanberra 12 November 1975\n\nYour Majesty,\n\nI am compelled by events involving yourself through your representative in Australia, His Excellency the Honourable Sir John Kerr, A C, K.C.M.G., K.St.J., Q.C.. to communicate my concern at the maintenance in the office of the Prime Minister of the Hon. Malcolm Fraser, M.P. despite his lack of majority support in the House of Representatives.\n\nImmediately following the announcement of the dismissal of the former Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, and Mr Fraser ‘s appointment, the House of Representatives carried a resolution expressing want of confidence in the GovernorGeneral’s nominee and requesting the re-instatement of the former Prime Minister in whom the House expressed confidence.\n\nI am seriously concerned that the failure of the GovernorGeneral to withdraw Mr Fraser ‘s commission and his decision to delay seeing me as Speaker of the House of Representatives until after the dissolution of the Parliament had been proclaimed were acts contrary to the proper exercise of the Royal prerogative and constituted an act of contempt for the House of Representatives. It is improper that your representative should continue to impose a Prime Minister on Australia in whom the House of Representatives has expressed its lack of confidence and who has not on any substantial resolution been able to command a majority of votes on the floor of the House of Representatives.\n\nIt is my belief that to maintain in office a Prime Minister imposed on the nation by Royal prerogative rather than through parliamentary endorsement constitutes a danger to our parliamentary system and will damage the standing of your representative in Australia and even yourself.\n\nI would ask that you act in order to restore Mr Whitlam to office as Prime Minister in accordance with the expressed resolution of the House of Representatives.\n\nFor Your Majesty’s information I would point out that Supply was approved by the Senate prior to 2.25 p.m. Mr Fraser announced that he had been commissioned as Prime Minister in the House of Representatives at 2.33 p.m. The House expressed its view at 3. IS p.m. by 64 votes to 54. I sought an audience with the Governor-General immediately following the passage of that resolution. An appointment was made for me to wait on the Governor-General at 4.45 p.m. The Governor-General prorogued the Parliament at 4.30 p.m.\n\nThe House expressed its view after the passage of the Supply Bills and was and is entitled to have that view considered.\n\nYours sincerely, G.G. D. SCHOLES Speaker\n\nHer Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second\n\npage 5\n\nBUCKINGHAM PALACE\n\n17th November, 1975.\n\nDear Mr Scholes\n\nI am commanded by the Queen to acknowledge your letter of 12th November about the recent political events in\n\nAustralia. You ask that The Queen should act to restore Mr Whitlam to office as Prime Minister.\n\nAs we understand the situation here, the Australian Constitution firmly places the prerogative powers of the Crown in the hands of the Governor-General as the representative of The Queen of Australia. The only person competent to commission an Australian Prime Minister is the GovernorGeneral, and The Queen has no part in the decisions which the Governor-General must take in accordance with the Constitution. Her Majesty, as Queen of Australia, is watching events in Canberra with close interest and attention, but it would not be proper for her to intervene in person in matters which are so clearly placed within the jurisdiction of the Governor-General by the Constitution Act.\n\nI understand that you have been good enough to send a copy of your letter to the Governor-General so I am writing to His Excellency to say that the text of your letter has been received here in London and has been laid before The Queen.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to the Governor-General.\n\nYours sincerely, MARTIN CHARTERIS\n\nThe Honourable G. G. D. Scholes\n\nMr E G Whitlam:\n\nWERRIWA, NEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\n– In the last few days, when it became known that the GovernorGeneral proposed to appoint one deputy to swear in the members of both Houses, contrary to the practice and the Standing Orders of each House, Mr Speaker Scholes wrote to the Governor-General and secured the appointment of 2 deputies as usual and required. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard this further correspondence.\n\nThe CLERK-Is leave granted?\n\nMr Sinclair:\n\n– Leave is refused.\n\nMr E G Whitlam:\n\nWERRIWA, NEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\n-None of us can have any doubt about the fitness of the honourable member for Corio to carry out the duties of Speaker. He has demonstrated all the qualities of a fine Speaker- wisdom, tolerance and selfassurance, clarity and certitude in his rulings, that special blend of firmness and fairness essential to the good conduct of proceedings. When the supreme challenge came to the rights of this Parliament he bore himself with dignity and carried out his tasks with the highest conception of his duty to the institution he serves and the cause of Australian democracy. It is above all in recognition of his actions and conduct at that time that I commend him to honourable members as our Speaker.\n\nMr BEAZLEY:\n\nFremantle\n\n-In supporting the motion that the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) do take the Chair I remind the House- I am sure that all who were in the last Parliament will agree with me- of his great technical competence as a Speaker. He was a very fair Speaker. There was very great clarity in his rulings. While the turn of political fortune may mean that he will cease to have the Speaker’s chair as a result of the election in this House there is nothing in his record that deserves defeat. His last action was to vindicate the rights of this House against what was an act of very great discourtesy. Had there been only one deputy to swear in both Houses we would have been cooling our heels in this chamber waiting for the process to be finished in the Senate. I would like to know why such a discourtesy, never offered, to this House before in my 30 years in this Parliament, took place. But it is consistent with the attitudes shown towards the rights of the House by the holder of that office.\n\nThere is a great importance in the Speakership, but this importance is slurred over. No reference was made from the other side to the importance of the speakership in vindicating the rights of this Parliament. There is a tendency of mind in text books to talk about a military raid on Parliament as something done by Charles I and Cromwell. The last military raid on an English speaking parliament took place in Australia in 1917 under the orders of William Morris Hughes, who was the then Prime Minister. The Speaker of the day, although of the same political persuasion, did not co-operate; neither did the Clerks of the House. But a servile majority of the House of Representatives was prepared to vote to vindicate a military raid on itself which its own Speaker and its own Clerk did not support. So I say that in Australia the tradition of vindicating the rights of this House in the formation of a government and its rights vis-a-vis the Crown is very defective. I believe that the correspondence of the honourable member for Corio with the Governor-General, with the Queen and then with the Governor-General again will last in this country as significant documents beyond the chances and changes of any election because they are documents of the greatest significance and the principles incorporated in those documents are principles upon which proper parliamentary government in this country will have to proceed. I believe that abroad there are very few observers of the Westminister system who would not vindicate what was done by Mr Speaker Scholes.\n\nFor those reasons I have pleasure in seconding his nomination to the Chair. However, knowing of course the composition of this Parliament and the likely election result I can only say that personally I very greatly regret that the Liberal Party did not choose a much more competent man as its nominee for Speaker and one in whom we would have much more confidence. I refer to the honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles ).\n\nMr SINCLAIR:\n\nMinister for Primary Industry and Leader of the House · New England · NCP/NP\n\n– I rise to support the nomination of the right honourable Bill Snedden as Speaker. I do so and participate in this debate because of the innuendoes made and the inferences drawn by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam) and the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley), the two who have nominated Mr Scholes for the position of Speaker. There is no doubt that the Leader of the Opposition, by his innuendo and inference, demonstrates once more that he still fails to recognise the verdict of the Australian people on 13 December. Equally, I think it is a pity that he fails to recognise that the fault in many instances lies not in others but in ourselves. He should learn some humility and that the judgment of the Australian people is more important than that which he sought to impose on the previous Parliament and which he apparently still intends to endeavour to impose on this Parliament.\n\nIt seems to me that several aspects of the allegations made need to be answered. I deal first with the suggestion that in some way Mr Scholes, as Speaker, acted with the authority and the backing of the members of this Parliament when he corresponded with Her Majesty the Queen. On no occasion was the question of his correspondence with Her Majesty raised in this chamber. He wrote to Her Majesty without in any way receiving the authorisation of this Parliament. That correspondence was undertaken on his own behalf without the backing of the Parliament and in a way which ignored completely the fact that under the Australian Constitution there is not one House of Parliament but there are 2 Houses of Parliament.\n\nIn this Parliament a few moments ago the Leader of the Opposition once more stated that in his view the sooner the powers of the Senate are curtailed, as were the powers of the Senate in the United States of America, the better. Under the Australian Constitution, fortunately, the powers of changing the Constitution lie not with the members of the Opposition, not with the members of the Australian Labor Party, nor indeed even with the members of this Parliament. They lie with the Australian people. The only way in which the powers of the Australian Constitution can be changed significantly is by referendum. If the powers of the Senate are to be reduced it will not be by correspondence between the Speaker in this Chamber and Her Majesty. Neither will it be by inference that there should be a reduction in the powers of the Senate to enhance in some way the status of this House.\n\nThe importance of this election is that we on the Government side of the House are confident that in the right honourable Bill Snedden we have a man who can and will act with the authority of this Parliament, who will act in accordance with the terms of the Australian Constitution. He is a man of experience and integrity, of competence and humility, a man in whom we have complete trust. There is no doubt that as a result the Australian Constitution will be observed and the rights and interests of the Australian people protected.\n\nI believe it inappropriate at this time that there should be any doubt about the capacity or otherwise of the Governor-General to have acted as he did. Indeed, the verdict of 13 December must remain the ultimate determinant and, as my colleague the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has said, if there is any doubt I would commend to honourable members a reading of the letter from the representative of Her Majesty the Queen which completely refutes the allegation that the Governor-General acted in any way outside the powers which are his within the Australian Constitution.\n\nMr BRYANT:\n\nWills\n\n-I listened with astonishment to the remarks of the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). Honourable members should remember his action on 12 November when he speaks of Parliament and what it stands for. On 11 November in this House the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr E. G. Whitlam) was removed from office by the Governor-General and replaced by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser). The House immediately passed a resolution of no confidence in the honourable member for Wannon and the next day, to their eternal parliamentary shame and the shame of the people who supported and nominated them, members of the Liberal Party and the Australian Country Party went out to the Governor-General’s residence and were sworn in as ministers- an act of treachery and treason against the whole parliamentary system.\n\nMotion (by Mr Sinclair) agreed to:\n\nThat the question be now put.\n\nThe Clerk:\n\n– In accordance with the standing order the bells will be rung and a ballot taken. (The bells having been rung)\n\nThe Clerk:\n\n-The result of the ballot is: Mr Snedden, 90 votes; Mr Scholes, 37 votes. Mr Snedden is therefore declared elected.\n\nMr SPEAKER (Hon B M Snedden:\n\nBRUCE, VICTORIA\n\n-I wish to express my appreciation for the high honour that the House has been pleased to confer upon me. (Mr Speaker having seated himself in the Chair)\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– I call the Prime Minister.\n\nMr MALCOLM FRASER:\n\nPrime Minister · Wannon · LP\n\n- Mr Speaker, I should like to offer you the warmest congratulations on behalf of the Government and the Government Parties and my own personal warm congratulations for the high honour that this House has bestowed upon you. It is an honour that has been truly deserved. The Government and, I believe, the Parliament has complete confidence that under your Speakership the Parliament will be a place of dignity, of courtesy and of propriety, with the interests of the people we are meant to serve, the people of Australia, to the forefront of our minds.\n\nMr Speaker, in this Parliament and in the wider field around Australia you have always been a man of great courtesy, and that is a quality which has often been rare in this Parliament. I hope we will see more of it. May some of your courtesy spread its way through the rest of us who have not practised it so well. You have good relations with members on both sides of the House and I know that you will perform the task of Speaker with dedication and great concern for this Parliament, for this institution. The Government, for its part, is determined to strengthen the institution of Parliament. Policy announcements will be made where they ought to be madewhen the House is sitting in the Parliament itself. There will be proper opportunities to debate matters of major significance and debate will not be cut off as it has been on some occasions in the past. There is much room for committee reforms in the Parliament. We have had a situation in which a joint committee - (Opposition members interjecting)-\n\nMr MALCOLM FRASER:\n\n-Mr Speaker, in case the honourable gentlemen opposite did not understand me, when policy matters are introduced into this Parliament and policy announcements are made in this Parliament, there will be proper opportunity to debate them. On previous occasions there was no opportunity to debate policy in this Parliament and debate was often cut short when it should not have been. That will not occur in the future. But if an Opposition persists in tactics or approaches designed to frustrate the proper workings of the House, obviously the Leader of the House will have to take to himself the powers under the Standing Orders and use them appropriately.\n\nCommittee reforms are something which a committee of this House and of the Senate have been examining. The Government will look forward keenly to a final report from a reconstituted committee so that action can be undertaken to reform the workings of the Parliament and to enable the members of the Parliament to have a fuller and a more appropriate role in the nation’s affairs. I believe that there have been opportunities in the past when governments could have acted in this way. My Government is determined not only to assist you, Sir, in setting standards of conduct of behaviour in this Parliament, but also to do a great deal to enhance the working of the Parliament and to make private members of the Parliament feel that they have- as they have- a more significant role than has sometimes been the case in the past.\n\nThe office of Speaker is a responsible job, and this is an important time for the future of Australia. I should just like to repeat, Mr Speaker, that you have the good wishes of every person in the Government and, I believe, the good wishes of the Parliament. You have had a long and distinguished career in the Parliament and I can think of nobody who will fill this task better, with greater dignity, with more honour and, as I indicated, with greater courtesy. These are qualities the Parliament needs; they are qualities Australia needs. We thank you for taking the chair.\n\nMr E. G. WHITLAM (Werriwa-Leader of the Opposition)- Mr Speaker, I offer the sincere congratulations of the Opposition on your election to your high and ancient office. There are few members of the House indeed who have had so long and deep an experience as yourself. There are few people in the House who have been members as long as you; you have been a member for over 20 years. No one in the House has been a Minister longer than you; you have been a minister for 9 years, ranging from Attorney-General to Treasurer. You were Leader of the House on two occasions, amounting in all to 3 Vi years. You were Leader of the Opposition for 2V4 years. You represented your Party and the Parliament at many conferences and in many overseas delegations. Few people could hope to equal your record of experience as a member of Parliament, as a representative of the Parliament, as a Minister in the Parliament. Three times, when you were in my present position you tendered congratulations to the Speaker- in February 1973, July 1974 and February 1975. You would blush if I were to recall the sentiments you expressed as those required by an ideal Speaker. It is enough for me to say that I will keep them by me for ready reference.\n\nMr Speaker:\n\n– You might give me the reference.\n\nMr E G Whitlam:\n\nWERRIWA, NEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\n– My only misgivings, Sir, arise from a doubt of your willingness and capacity to assert the rights of the House. After all, you yourself abetted the first attempt by the Senate to usurp the rights of this House in April 1974. The attempt failed because you, unlike your successor, did not corral the complete conservative coalition of newspaper proprietors, Chief Justice and Governor-General. I concede that your attitude is not likely to handicap the House in this Parliament when the Senate, I expect, will be quite quiescent. Mr Speaker, there will be widespread satisfaction on both sides of the House that your Party, on one of those occasions when it conducted a secret ballot for its officers and nominees, made amends to you by nominating you to your high office. There is much personal goodwill towards you on both sides of the House. I certainly share that sentiment myself. I am most happy to convey to you the congratulations of myself and my colleagues.\n\nMr ANTHONY:\n\nMinister for National Resources and Minister for Overseas Trade · Richmond · NCP/NP\n\n- Mr Speaker, on behalf of the members of the National Country Party I extend sincere congratulations to you on being elected to the very high position of Speaker of this House. I also extend to you my own personal congratulations. You have been a friend and colleague of mine for many years and it is indeed fitting to see this distinction bestowed upon you. You have held many responsible positions in this chamber and you understand the forms of the House and its mood. I am sure that in your position you will do all possible to maintain the decorum, dignity and propriety that go with the responsibilities of your office. You are a person who has had misfortunes but one of your greatest attributes has been your ability to show no bias, no bitterness and no retaliation. As a Speaker must show impartiality and no bias, you are a fitting person to hold the position. I wish you many years of service in the office.\n\nI should like to commend the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), who has experienced disappointment today in not being elected as Speaker, for the service he gave in the previous Parliament. His misfortune was not of his own making but was due to those in his own Party who wanted to abuse the forms of the House and to reject the Constitution.\n\nMr SCHOLES:\n\nCorio\n\n-Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your assumption of a very important and high office not only in this Parliament but also in our community. You take this office at a time when some of the problems which beset myself and my predecessor do not exist within this Parliament. The governing party has a majority in both Houses and therefore it is less likely that conflict between the Houses will exist. You also take office at a time when this House is at what I must say is its lowest position with regard to government and administration. This House has had removed from it its pre-eminent right over the finances of the Commonwealth. It has had removed from it rights which people’s houses, including the House of Commons, have had for 700 years.\n\nMr Sinclair:\n\n– Nonsense.\n\nMr SCHOLES:\n\n– The Leader of the House expressed his opinion in an earlier debate. His opinion is that a man who robs a bank and gets away with it is properly and legally entitled to the funds he collects. Having robbed the bank of integrity and obtained a majority in this House does not make the actions which preceded the election proper any more than the verdict of the Australian people in 1966 reflected what was proper and subsequently proved correct in those days. Mr Speaker, I have been diverted by an interjection and I am sorry.\n\nMr Donald Cameron:\n\nGRIFFITH, QUEENSLAND · LP\n\n– You are out of order.\n\nMr SCHOLES:\n\n-That decision is the Presiding Officer’s responsibility and not the responsibility of the honourable member. I am sure the Speaker can carry out his duties far better than the honourable member. That is why the honourable member was not selected yesterday. Sir, you assume responsibilities also outside this chamber. You are responsible for this Parliament and every person who enters and works within it. The people who work within this Parliament are the people most neglected by this Commonwealth of ours and least thought about by those who exercise power. You, Sir, have a responsibility which will bring you in conflict with your executive and rarely bring you satisfaction. The conditions under which people work in this Parliament are below sub-standard and this Parliament, under its laws, would not allow other people to work under similar conditions. Sir, I congratulate you and I say to you with all the goodwill in the world that I trust that your service to Parliament this House of the Parliament as its Speaker will be such that it will place your name high in the list of the people who have occupied that chair and that it will bring to this Parliament and, more importantly, to this House of the Parliament, the respect and the position to which I think the Government of this country is entitled.\n\nMr GILES:\n\nAngas\n\n– It is not only appropriate but certainly it is also my wish that I be allowed one or two moments to congratulate you, Mr Speaker, most sincerely on your elevation to the office you now hold. In passing may I also pay my compliments to the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). I was a trifle astounded to hear him refer to banks as storehouses of integrity. I have no doubt that that statement, if I heard it correctly , will be noticed in high places. I know that all sorts of banks store commodities, sometimes of great importance, but probably nothing of greater importance than integrity. I was interested in the honourable member’s use of that term.\n\nMr Speaker, my purpose in rising is to congratulate you and I request you to pass on my best wishes, and the best wishes of honourable members of this side of the House, to your wife. In times of adversity men come forward- and in this case I would spell Men with a capital. I think you have succeeded in attracting the admiration of the people of Australia for the fine way in which you and your wife have coped with adversity. In many ways adversity is a major requirement in forming character, and character is what is needed to control this House in a dignified and proper fashion. I personally wish you well and I hope you have a long, successful and happy sojourn in your present office.\n\nMr HAYDEN:\n\nOxley\n\n-I would like to congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on assuming this high office. The honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) was unkind enough to refer to a nose injury of yours which goes back so many decades that it must be embarrassing to consider the lapse of time. I would like to join him in saying that I hope we do not have the misfortune of seeing you taking the chair on any future occasion with your nose out of joint. I feel certain that you were reassured today to have the expression from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that he stands firmly behind you. Some people would be unkind enough to make some pointed comments about that remark. It is not the first time that he has given you assurances of complete and loyal support to you but I think he means it this time. I found the principle firmly enunciated this morning by the Prime Minister a rather novel one, that there would be a completely free flow of debate in this chamber- except when it was embarrassing and then, of course, the matter would be put to the vote.\n\nMr Speaker, you bring the breadth of experience to this chair which should allow you to discharge your duties with dignity and to attract great respect to this House. I sincerely trust that you display the depth of personal qualities which must also go with this. I believe you will and I wish you well in the future.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– I thank the House and I thank the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) for the words he has spoken. There has been some departure from practice today in that issues of debate have been raised when really they should not have been raised. However, it was for the information of honourable gentlemen. I add that I think it will be in the interests of the House if we can have as many questions as possible in question time. I think the proposal put by the Prime Minister will contribute to that. I thank the Prime Minister for what he said. I thank the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. Whitlam). All of them customarily congratulate the Speaker, but I felt in the congratulations a real sense of meaning. I appreciate that. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) may, I hope, understand that I felt that he contributed very greatly as a Speaker in the period that he served. I appreciate the kindness of the gesture of the honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles) in speaking as he did. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that there is in the chamber today the longest serving Speaker in our history, Sir John McLeay. (Opposition members interjecting)\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– Order! That is the first time I have said it. I hope it will not be said very often. I hope I will have no need to repeat it. The office of Speaker has a great tradition. In many ways it is the fulcrum of parliamentary democracy. I am greatly honoured to occupy the position. I will be most alert to my responsibility to protect the dignity, the decorum and authority of the House. I will expect all honourable members to conduct themselves and to make their contribution to proceedings appropriately. I look forward to retaining the camaraderie of my old colleagues of the House and to building that camaraderie with my new colleagues. I thank the House.\n\npage 11\n\nPRESENTATION TO GOVERNOR-GENERAL\n\nMr MALCOLM FRASER:\n\nPrime Minister · Wannon · LP\n\n– I have ascertained that it will be His Excellency the Governor-General’s pleasure to receive the Speaker in the Library of the Parliament this day at 2.42 p.m.\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– Prior to my presentation to His Excellency this afternoon, the bells will ring for 3 minutes so that honourable members may attend in the chamber and accompany the Speaker to the Library, when they may, if they so wish, be introduced to His Excellency.\n\nSitting suspended from 12.47 to 2.41 p.m. (The House proceeded to the Library, and, being reassembled)\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– I have to report that, accompanied by honourable members, I this day proceeded to the Library of the Parliament and presented myself to His Excellency the Governor-General as the choice of the House, and that His Excellency was kind enough to congratulate me on my election as Speaker.\n\npage 11\n\nCOMMISSION TO ADMINISTER OATH\n\nMr SPEAKER:\n\n– His Excellency also presented to me his commission authorising me to administer to members the oath of affirmation of allegiance.

The Speech will be included in Hansard for record purposes. (The Speech read as follows)-\n\nSenators, Members of the House of Representatives:\n\nWe assemble at a time when large areas of New South Wales and Queensland are being devastated by severe flooding. It is a terrible experience for those affected and my Government expresses its deepest concern for their plight. The Government is consulting with the States in taking action to ensure that all proper assistance is available. The Natural Disasters Organisation is operating smoothly.\n\nFollowing the decision of the Australian people in the elections last December for both Houses of Parliament, my Government believes that the Australian people have given it a strong directive to bring under control the highest unemployment for forty years and the worst prolonged inflation in the nation’s history. The Government believes that excessive government intervention in the life of the nation is a major factor in economic instability.\n\nMy Government’s immediate objective is to bring inflation under control so that there can again be jobs for all who want to work.\n\nThe Government’s long term objective is to prevent the growth of centralised bureaucratic domination in Australia, the increasing dependence of individuals on the state. It is to encourage the development of an Australia in which people have- maximum freedom and independence to achieve their own goals in life, in ways which they decide.\n\nAs part of this approach the Government will place great emphasis on directing welfare assistance to those in real need. Unless there is a concentration on those in real need, schemes of assistance do not provide maximum possible assistance to the disadvantaged and become excessively costly. The Government does not believe that the poor and disadvantaged can be best helped by increasing the dependence of everyone on what the Government chooses to provide.\n\nMy Government believes that adequate opportunities for the disadvantaged as well as the most rapid improvement in social service provision, are dependent on people being free and encouraged to achieve their best. The disadvantaged must be helped in ways which leave them the maximum independence.\n\nAt the root of the economic crisis is a steadily increasing tax burden required to finance, at the expense of the private sector, an ever-growing public sector. Measures to deal with this crisis will advance Australia towards the long-term goal of a society based on freedom and on the mutual respect freedom makes possible.\n\nThe Government’s strategy to achieve its objectives can be summarised as follows:\n\nThere will be a major direction of resources away from Government towards individuals and private enterprise;\n\nThe internal structure of the Government is being made more economical and effective; a responsible Cabinet system has been instituted which will permit effective and co-ordinated decisions to be taken and implemented;\n\nMajor reforms will be implemented to protect individuals from being subjected to massive unlegislated tax increases;\n\nHistoric reforms will be made to reverse the concentration of power in the Federal Government and increase the autonomy and responsibilities of Local and State Governments. The Government believes that there must be more scope for community and individual initiative if people are to solve their problems sensitively and with a rational use of resources;\n\nThe total wealth of Australians will be expanded by the encouragement of enterprise, and by the reassertion of the Government’s role in establishing an appropriate legal framework for economic life;\n\nIn all policy areas the Government will be alert to opportunities to increase the freedom of Australians to choosewithout exploitation- the kinds of goods, services, and styles of life they want, and to minimise direction by Government and the unnecessary redirection of resources through the Government’s bureaucracy.\n\nControl of inflation is the Government’s first consideration. Unless inflation is brought under control there will be no adequate employment opportunities, no soundly based return to prosperity.\n\nThe Government has already begun to implement its economic program to achieve this objective. It is a full three year program.\n\nThe budget deficit must be lowered, otherwise inflationary pressures will intensify. The very rapid growth in government expenditure in recent times has been accompanied by enormous waste. The Government has taken a number of actions to reduce expenditure and inefficiency.\n\nImmediate economies have been made in administrative expenses. These affect, among other things, overtime, travel and subsistence expenses, advertising, consultancy work, the activities of commissions, boards of inquiry, and so on, as well as expenditure by Ministers and other members of Parliament.\n\nThe growth of the Federal bureaucracy has been halted by the announcement of revised staff ceilings. Further revisions to these ceilings to reduce the size of the service were announced last week.\n\nThere has been an initial review of the Government’s spending programs and, with the other measures taken, expenditure reductions worth about $360m in the current year have been achieved. Savings from these decisions in later years will be considerably greater.\n\nThe Government has also appointed an Administrative Review Committee to review administrative expenditure, achieve maximum administrative efficiency, and eliminate waste and duplication within and between Government Departments, and between Commonwealth and States. The committee will report progressively.\n\nThe Government has been forced to examine all expenditures in terms of their priority. Choices have to be made. It will be necessary to economise on some worthwhile projects which are not urgent, in addition to continued action against waste and duplication, to effect the necessary transfer of resources to the private sector. Only if this is done can prosperity and productive job opportunities be restored.\n\nWhile the Government in these ways is seeking to cut the costs of public administration, it also seeks to promote worthwhile innovation in the Public Service. The Government will give close attention to the Report of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration when it is received.\n\nConcurrent with action to bring the deficit under control, the Government has announced a number of measures to further restrain inflation, encourage investment in plant and equipment and expand job opportunities in the private sector.\n\nThese measures include the new 40 per cent investment allowance and the relaxation of conditions applying to the interest deductibility of convertible note issues.\n\nThe Government has introduced a major set of monetary measures to take up excess liquidity and encourage investment. The package included a special new security, the Australian Savings Bond, which was outstandingly successful in supporting the February loan raisings.\n\nThe Government will continue the suspension of the quarterly tax instalments for the three instalments that would have been payable for the 1976-77 financial year.\n\nAlongside its assistance to manufacturing and other industries, the Government has taken action to assist the rural community to overcome its present crisis. Rural industries will not be neglected as they have been in the past\n\nGovernment support for industry- primary as well as secondary- will be based on reports of the Industries Assistance Commission. The Government, of course, makes policy in this area. The Government is pursuing energetically proposals for a Rural Bank and a Farm Income Reserve Fund.\n\nAn important contribution to economic revival and the expansion of job opportunities will be made by the Government’s policy for Australia ‘s resources. The prime objective of the Government’s national resources policy is to return resource development to its proper role in the nation’s economy and to restore overseas user’s confidence in the Australian mining industry’s long term reliability.\n\nThe Government seeks to assure its overseas trading partners, including Japan, that we will be a stable and steady trading partner. Reliable access to overseas markets for a range of Australian products will be sought.\n\nThe development of the North- West Shelf is a high priority and the Government is working closely with the Western Australian Government and private enterprise to bring the gas on-stream at the earliest possible date.\n\nThe Government will energetically promote overseas trade and participate actively in the discussion of trade problems in the Conference on International Economic Cooperation and the forthcoming UNCTAD Ministerial Conference, as well as in the Multilateral Trade Negotiations being conducted under the auspices of G ATT.\n\nThe Government will encourage measures aimed at improving the efficiency, economy, and adequacy of our transport services. In achieving these objectives it will work through Commonwealth, State and industry advisory bodies and it will review means of strengthening the Australian Shippers’ Council.\n\nAction will be taken to give effect to the Government’s commitment to develop a relative freight equalisation scheme for Bass Strait traffic.\n\nThe Government will ensure that business activity is regulated by law to prevent exploitation of consumers. It will also review existing regulations to ensure that they are in the public interest and do not needlessly hamper business efficiency. The Government will review the operation of the Trade Practices Act and closely cooperate with the States in protecting the consumer.\n\nAustralia will not return to a soundly based prosperity without understanding and cooperation between all sections of the community. The Government needs broadly based advice from the community and in this regard will be looking to such bodies as the Economic Consultative Group and the proposed tripartite national consultative council in the industrial relations area. With this in mind the Government has established the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs to develop and maintain close contact with consumers and business. In the field of transport, improved communication and cooperation with the States will be undertaken through the Australian Transport Advisory Council, the Marine and Ports Council and the Transport Industries Advisory Council.\n\nTalks are to be held with union and employer groups on the future role and operations of the Prices Justification Tribunal.\n\nA major step in the Government’s strategy and an important support for community cooperation will be the introduction of tax indexation.\n\nIn the next Budget, the Government will begin implementing its tax indexation policy. The greater the support given to the Government’s economic program, the greater the first step can be. This reform will compel Governments to be honest- if they want more money, they must legislate for it. It will protect the average Australian and the low income earner against higher tax levels caused by inflation. It will check Government-induced inflation. It will be more effective in protecting the incomes of wage and salary earners than any other single measure.\n\nThe Government intends to increase the capacity of Australian workers and employers to decide the leadership of their organisations. Legislation will be introduced providing for officially conducted secret ballots in elections for officials in organisations registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The Government is also proposing to ensure that members receive each year a report on the activities of their organisation and its finances. These measures will be discussed with the trade union movement before legislation is introduced.\n\nTo re-establish a pattern of cooperation in national affairs and reverse the excessive centralising of power in Australia, the Government proposes to make the most important reform of the Federal system since Federation. Its core will be the principle of tax sharing. The possibilities of this new approach to Federalism are demonstrated by the recent Premiers’ Conference. The working of our governmental system has been corroded by the absence of reasonable financial autonomy for the States. Under this Government, the States will have access to a secure proportion of personal income tax revenue. This will both make possible more effective community participation in State and Local Government and a more rational use of the Government’s resources.\n\nIn making these reforms, particular care will be taken over the special circumstances of the less populous States to ensure that they are in no way disadvantaged.\n\nTo assist in achieving cooperation between the various spheres of government, an Advisory Council on Inter-governmental Relations will be established.\n\nIn line with its policy of developing governmental authority, the Government will progressively act to confer executive responsibility on the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory with the objective of advancing the Territory to Statehood. A joint Federal and Northern Territory Legislative Assembly committee will be set up to work on arrangements for the transition to Statehood.\n\nFor the A.C.T. the Government will propose legislation to ensure that the A.C.T. Legislative Assembly has responsibility for the financial management and decision-making related to Canberra’s local affairs, although the Parliament will retain a reserve power of disallowance. A task force has been established to make recommendations on the framework for the transfer of appropriate authority to the Assembly.\n\nAction to restore Australia’s economic well being and decentralise Government decision making is essential to the Government’s ability to provide better and more effective assistance to the disadvantaged. The Government will not permit economic recovery to take place at the expense of those who are less well off.\n\nThe Government proposes to introduce to the Parliament amending legislation to increase social service pensions and benefit rates every six months in accordance with movements in the Consumer Price Index. Similar legislation will be introduced to increase repatriation compensation payments.\n\nThe Government will proceed with a review of the income security system as a whole, including the effectiveness of guaranteed minimum income proposals in overcoming poverty.\n\nThe possibility of expanding the area of choice in services available to the disadvantaged and those in real need, while fully maintaining support, will be investigated by the Government.\n\nIt is believed by the Government that voluntary welfare organisations are a critically important part of the Australian welfare system. Accordingly, financial assistance to them will continue. In addition, the Government will assist voluntary bodies by placing public service resources at their disposal through improving opportunities for transferability of staff between the Government and the non-government sector.\n\nMedibank will be retained and the Government will ensure it operates efficiently. The Medibank Review Committee has been established to examine the program in this respect.\n\nMeasures have been taken to ensure that only those genuinely eligible receive unemployment benefit. The Government will do everything in its power to ensure that these measures are applied with a sensitivity and understanding that respects the dignity of the unemployed, and that there is a simple, understandable and effective appeals system to protect applicants for benefits against arbitrary action by officials.\n\nThe Government believes that education is a prime means for individual self development. An education system to achieve this end must be based on equality of opportunity and the pursuit of excellence.\n\nLegislation will be presented to Parliament early in the session to provide assistance to the States for education in 1976. This legislation will authorise funds for the programs of the Schools Commission, Universities Commission, Commission on Advanced Education and the Technical and Further Education Commission, which are now proceeding.\n\nThe Government has requested reports from these Commissions on the triennium 1977-79 by the end of March.\n\nThe relevant Commissions will be asked to give close attention to measures designed to achieve greater equality in teaching and facilities, and in particular to giving effective educational opportunities to the disadvantagedhandicapped, Aboriginal, isolated and migrant children.\n\nThe functions of the Commissions and how they relate to State programs and responsibilities will be examined by the Government. Proposals are being considered for a single Tertiary Education Commission to perform the functions currently undertaken by the Universities Commission and the Commission on Advanced Education.\n\nThe Government intends to proceed with the establishment of the maritime college at Launceston.\n\nThe Government gives high priority to the provision of trade union training. It is particu- l arly concerned that training opportunities, and the composition of National and State Trade Union Training Councils recognise the important position of women in Australian employment.\n\nThe Government’s foreign policy will reflect a greater self-reliance, and willingness to develop friendly and cooperative relations with all countries. The Government will continue fully to support international initiatives for the reduction of world tensions.\n\nWithin South East Asia Australia has particularly good relations with the ASEAN group of countries. The Government will seek ways of expanding cooperation with them both individually and as a group as well as maintaining and developing substantive communications with all the countries in the Asia-Pacific area.\n\nMy Government’s diplomatic effort will give greater emphasis to the Asia-Pacific region. It will seek to extend and deepen Australia’s relations with Japan. In response to messages from the Prime Minister of Japan, expressing the wish for the early conclusion of a treaty of friendship and cooperation between the two countries, the\n\nGovernment has made decisions which will enable the negotiations delayed last year to proceed. Bilateral relations with China will be further developed.\n\nThe Government believes there is a need to pay more attention to relations with countries with which we share common philosophical commitments.\n\nPriority will be given to the protection of Australian interests in areas adjacent to our continent. In the Indian Ocean the Government supports United States efforts to balance the Soviet presence while hoping mutual restraint will keep the balance of forces at the lowest practicable level. Conscious of the steady and systematic development since 1968 of Soviet naval capabilities in the Indian Ocean area and its use of facilities there, and given the need of the United States to have adequate logistical back-up in an area where developments could affect global stability, the Government supports the United States development of Diego Garcia facilities.\n\nThe Government believes Australia has a continuing responsibility to assist in the progress of Papua New Guinea and will, therefore, continue a comprehensive program for cooperation and development. The Government looks forward to the visit of Papua New Guinea’s Prime Minister and to having early discussions with him. The Government also accepts that it has a responsibility to assist with the economic advancement of developing countries.\n\nThe nation’s security is a prime concern of the Government. The Government will watch the international situation closely to ensure timely warning of any changes adverse to the nation’s security interests. It will maintain and foster the valuable defence relations with Australia’s allies and other friends, including close associates in the neighbouring region.\n\nThe Government will ensure that the nation has at its disposal an adequate defence force that is properly trained, equipped and supported.\n\nThorough assessments of equipment needs are being undertaken as part of the review of the Defence Program. Once the priorities are determined my Government will act without delay to acquire the chosen equipment. An order for medium range transport aircraft for the RAAF is expected to be placed within the next few months.\n\nA plan for a new cadet system is being drawn up. The new style cadet corps will retain the essential virtues of cadet training, but will seek to rely more heavily on voluntary support from the community.\n\nThe Government places importance on improving the Defence infrastructure, and has directed that a number of studies be undertaken in relation to our Western seaboard. These include an examination to expedite completion of HMAS Stirling in Cockburn Sound, and the early establishment of a Joint Services training area at Yampi Sound.\n\nThe new Defence organisation established by the Defence Reorganisation Act will facilitate the development of a Defence Force in keeping with Australia’s needs. A Defence Council has been established to facilitate the access by the Minister for Defence to all relevant advice and information concerning the control and administration of the Armed Services and to ensure that the views of the services are reviewed by an appropriate body.\n\nThe Government is firmly committed to furthering equality of opportunity for women in education, employment, and in public life. It will encourage the full participation of women in all aspects of Australian life to ensure that their contribution of skills and talents is used to the full. The Commonwealth Public Service Superannuation Scheme to be introduced shortly has been amended to make better provision for women employed by the Government.\n\nThe Government recognises the major contribution that migrants have made to Australia. It will intensify action to meet the needs of migrant and ethnic communities in Australia.\n\nIn order to consult adequately with migrant communities, the Government will see that consultative committees are established in every State.\n\nIt will cooperate with the States and migrant communities in disseminating ethnic languages and cultures.\n\nIt favours the provision of migrant advisory services and assistance schemes in industry and will encourage industry to take a greater responsibility for the welfare of migrant workers.\n\nThe Government will make available adequate numbers of bilingual staff in public hospitals and government departments.\n\nThe thrust of the Government’s policy in Aboriginal Affairs is to promote self-management and self-sufficiency for Aboriginals. To this end the Government will be considering ways of providing opportunities for Aboriginals to play a significant role in setting their long term goals and objectives, priorities for expenditure, and in evaluating existing programs and formulating new ones.\n\nThe Government will introduce legislation to establish a new Home Savings Grant Scheme. The Government will review the Housing Loans Insurance Scheme.\n\nThe Government is conscious of the need to protect and improve the nature of the environment.\n\nTo provide a coherent national approach to pollution control, the Government will discuss national environmental standards and criteria with the States. As soon as those discussions have been concluded, legislation will be introduced.\n\nThe implications of the affirmation by theHigh Court that the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973 is valid for the administration of all offshore operations, are now under close study and appropriate revised arrangements are being worked out in cooperation with the States. In these consultations the Government will seek to work out an appropriate basis of cooperation with the States not only in relation to particular industries but in particular for the protection of the marine environment.\n\nThe subject of privacy will be referred to the Law Reform Commission. The terms of reference will be settled after consultation with State Attorneys-General. After consideration of the Commission’s report the Government will introduce appropriate legislation.\n\nThe Government will continue to implement the Family Law Act.\n\nAustralia has a fine record of achievement in the creative and performing arts.\n\nIt is the Government’s intention to encourage their continued growth and development, and to emphasise the development of young talent. The Government also believes that the States and private interests can play a crucial part in the healthy and vigorous growth of the arts.\n\nThe Government will give effect to the National Gallery’s policy of giving first priority to purchasing Australian Art. Australia’s National Gallery should hold the very finest work of Australian artists of all periods.\n\nThe Government will support a more vigorous sponsorship of exhibitions which will give more Australians ready access to the art and culture of other countries.\n\nThe Government will continue to encourage the rapidly growing Australian Film and Television Industry.\n\nFurther development of the creative and performing arts will add greatly to the depth and value of life in Australia.\n\nSenators and Members,\n\nThe purpose my Government has set itself is not merely to give Australia prosperity, predictability and stability. It is also to develop in a rational and sensible fashion a new and exciting role for government- one which places more reliance on the commonsense and reason of the Australian people.\n\nAustralians are increasingly well educated, they have a high capacity to participate in and shape the decisions that determine their future. My Government is determined to develop these possibilities in the process of government in a manner never before undertaken.\n\nWe have a unique opportunity to establish in Australia a truly liberal and humane society- to demonstrate that independence and freedom are not only compatible with action to assist the disadvantaged but inseparable from it.\n\nThe Government is not concerned with power for itself. It is the servant of the Australian people. Its purpose is to work with the people to create an Australian democracy which will be an example to the world of what a free people can achieve.\n\nI now leave you in the faith that Divine Providence will always guide your deliberations and further the welfare of the people of Australia.\n\npage 18\n\nADDRESS-IN-REPLY\n\nMotion (by Mr Malcolm Fraser) agreed to:\n\nThat a Committee consisting of Mr Groom, Mr Braithwaite and myself be appointed to prepare an AddressinReply to the Speech delivered by His Excellency the Governor-General to both Houses of the Parliament and that the Committee do report at the next sitting.\n\nSitting suspended from 3.54 to 5 p.m.\n\npage 18\n\nDEATH OF TUN ABDUL RAZAK\n\nMr MALCOLM FRASER:\n\nPrime Minister · Wannon · LP\n\n– A short while ago Tun Abdul Razak died. It is appropriate that the House pay its respects to his memory and to what he did in the service of his country and of the region in which he lived. Tun Abdul Razak ‘s death is a great loss to the people of Malaysia, South East Asia and the world. In his death Australia itself has lost a dear and good friend. Tun Razak had a sustained and close contact with leaders of the Australian Government, of both sides of politics, for many years. He was greatly respected by all Australians and especially by those who came to know him. He was respected for his depth of feeling, his sense of purpose and his dedication.\n\nTun Razak ‘s career was one of achievement. During the war he joined the Malayan resistance. He had a brilliant academic record in England where he was admitted to the Bar. He held high administrative posts in Malaya’s preindependence period while seeking Malaya’s national independence. It was one of those countries that moved from an old regime to a proper and dignified independence through co-operation, common sense and reason. In 1955 he was Education Minister and there laid the basis for Malaya’s national education system. In 1957, on Malayan independence, Tun Razak became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence and National Security. He spearheaded the antiinsurgency campaign. In 1960 he also became Minister for National and Rural Development, a post he held for 10 years, which he used to achieve rapid progress in the development of rural areas and which did much to raise the standard of life throughout rural Malaysia.\n\nIn 1970 Tun Razak became Prime Minister and Defence and Foreign Affairs Minister. He made a significant contribution to the development of Malaysia both domestically and internationally. He was a skilled administrator and conducted Malaysian affairs with great dignity, calmness and sense of purpose. His statesmanship and his contribution to peace and stability in South East Asia will long be remembered. He helped to establish some notable and worthy goals not only for his own country but also for the region and he was not deterred by the fact that their achievement in the immediate present seemed difficult. I knew Tun Razak for a long period and I will mourn his loss personally. I therefore move:\n\nThat this House records its sincere regret at the death of Tun Abdul Razak, Prime Minister of Malaysia, and expresses to the people of Malaysia profound regret and to his family tenders sympathy in their bereavement.\n\nMr E G Whitlam:\n\nLeader of the Opposition · WERRIWA, NEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\n– The Australian Labor Party supports the motion which the Prime Minister has moved. Only 4 months ago Tun Razak was the guest of the Parliament. He was returning a visit which I made 2 years ago. He was South East Asia’s longest serving and one of its most dedicated national leaders. He had been a Minister since Malaysia was created. For the past 5 years he had been its Prime Minister. Before Malaysia was formed he had served as a Minister in the State of Pahang, of which his family were the hereditary rulers. He had devoted his whole adult life to equipping his nation for selfgovernment and asserting its independence. One of the most revealing things I learned from him was that when he was 10 years of age the coronation occurred of his grandfather as Sultan of Pehang. He said: ‘A very big hall was built for the occasion and all the chiefs, nicely dressed, stood in the hall. The British Governor and his officers were there too. Everyone was standing except them. That picture has stayed in my mind. The British put us on the stage but with no part to play. This was our country but they sat there and ruled it, and all we could do was to stand by and watch. I remember that occasion very well ‘.\n\nTun Razak was known as a very quiet person. He pursued a low profile in public life at home and abroad. Nevertheless, I believe that one needs to understand the man’s background and his earliest impressions to understand, to appreciate, to applaud his consistency of purpose and his persistence in achieving it, and his achievements were remarkable. Malaysia is not the easiest country to rule- constitutionally, ethnically, culturally- yet he brought it together, he helped to bring it to independence, he preserved its independence and he gave it a leadership role in the region, not least in ASEAN, such as no other person could have done so well. He played a leading role in the creation of the concept of a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality in South East Asia, a concept which, as the whole of ASEAN recognises, offers our best hope for the future of our region.\n\nI had been his guest on 9 visits to Malaysia since 1962. My wife and I had formed a close friendship with him and his wife. The new Prime Minister of Malaysia is, of course, a brotherinlaw of the late Tun Razak. They married sisters. Many of us have lost a good neighbour and a good friend in Tun Razak. We can at least be happy that a man who was brought into public life from the professions, where he enjoyed a very high standing indeed and an outstanding reputation, is the new Prime Minister of Malaysia. To Tun Razak ‘s family, to the people of Malaysia, to the Government of Malaysia all Australians can say that they have lost a good neighbour and a good friend. We will remember the contribution that this man and those associated with him made to steady progress and proper aspirations in our region.\n\nQuestion resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places.\n\npage 19\n\nDEATH OF CHOU EN-LAI\n\nMr MALCOLM FRASER:\n\nPrime Minister · Wannon · LP\n\n– During the period when the House was not sitting Chou En-lai also died. With his death China lost one of her great leaders and the world lost one of this century’s outstanding men. His death will be sadly felt not only by the Chinese people but also by people throughout the world. Chou’s career spanned more than SO years, a record that few could equal. A determined revolutionary, he was a major figure in the turbulence of China’s revolutionary period and beyond, playing the roles of party organiser, military leader and intellectual, combining those qualities and characteristics with rare skill and a rare capacity. He was second only to Mao Tsetung in his influence on contemporary China. As Premier, Chou En-lai stood willing to discuss with candour his country’s position with visitors and other dignitaries. These explanations of China’s role made a significant contribution to world understanding and in particular to an understanding of modern China. A committed believer in the Marxist-Leninist perspective in the world, he applied this perspective through the established canons of international relations. History will remember Chou En-lai as a major figure of his era who served his country with sacrifice and dedication over a span of years that has few parallels. In his last years, gravely ill, he worked with grace and composure to maintain and enhance China’s internal stability and position in the world. I therefore move:\n\nThat this House records its sincere regret at the death of Chou En-lai, Premier of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China, and expresses to the people of China profound regret and to his family tenders sympathy in their bereavement.\n\nMr E G Whitlam:\n\nLeader of the Opposition · WERRIWA, NEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\n– The Australian Labor Party supports the motion of condolence of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on the death of Premier Chou En-lai. His death has been lamented not only by the people of China, for whom it was an occasion of profound national grief, but also by statesmen and people the world over. With his great compatriot Mao Tse-tung, Chou En-lai embodied and expressed the aspirations of the people of China for national unity and international dignity. His death has removed the last but one of the giants of modern history. In the eyes of the world he represented the authentic spirit of the new China and her people. At the same time he remained a figure of world stature, of universal renown. While serving always the interests of his own people he was never remote from the wider concerns of humanity. He had an instinctive familiarity with nations and people everywhere, with the arts of diplomacy and the workings of governments. It was this which made him over half a century a supremely skilled and eloquent spokesman for his country, the supreme internationalist amongst statesmen and the chief interpreter to the world of the ideals and aspirations of his people.\n\nHis great achievement was to restore to a quarter of the world’s people their proper place in the community of nations. He won for his country by slow degrees the trust and respect of other nations. For too long in that task he met grudging response from Australia and her allies. Only in recent years have all Australian governments and parties come to accept the place of China in our region and in the world and the legitimate claims of her people to recognition and full membership in the world community. I believe the judgment of history wm confirm that on all momentous issues affecting the peace and security of our region China has been proved right and the Western nations paid a heavy and tragic price for their folly and short-sightedness.\n\nPremier Chou En-lai worked tirelessly to better the living standards of his people. He was both a product and an architect of the tumultuous events of the revolution whose effects have transformed his country and its relations with the world. People everywhere admired his valiant participation in the Long March. Modern China owes much of its strength and confidence as well as its growing industrial development to the ideals he formulated and the inspiration he provided to his people.\n\nI made 2 visits to his country, the second as Prime Minister. During my visits I spent some 20 hours in discussion with him and was profoundly impressed by his charm, his humanity, his vigour and his vision. It was a vision which encompassed the world, a world where China would neither dominate nor be dominated. If the world now better understands China and the people of China it is chiefly because of this extraordinary man. He worked passionately for peace. He saw peace as the indispensable condition for the progress of mankind and the realisation of the aspirations of his country. He deepened and extended China’s contacts with the world in culture and trade. More than anyone else he helped break down the ancient fears and suspicions of his country that prevailed abroad. His per.sonality embodied both the spirit of contemporary China and the values of its ancient civilisation, the longest civilisation to occupy one part of the earth’s surface. In time I believe the world will come to see the full dimensions of its debt to this wise, patient, cultured and, in the highest sense, aristocratic representative of his people.\n\nMr YOUNG:\n\nPort Adelaide\n\n-I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the\n\nLeader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) in support of this motion of condolence in respect of the death of the Premier of the People’s Republic of China. Like so many people holding office in the parliaments throughout the world I have joined with the throng that has gone to China in recent years and have had the great privilege of meeting with Premier Chou En-lai. In speaking of this man one must of course reconcile his history with the torment of China up to 1949 and the great achievements of China since 1949. It has been an unfortunate aspect of Australian politics that the exploitation of foreign affairs during the 1950s and 1960s and the plight of Asia during that period clouded both the achievement of China and the ability and achievements of the individuals in the Government of China, one of whom was the Premier, Chou En-lai. The responsibility of the Government of China in 1949 to tackle the problems of some 600 million people, to get the industries going, to overcome the illiteracy, to overcome the enormous health problems, to overcome the poverty, then to face the trade embargoes, the hostility of much of the Western world, was a responsibility that fell very largely on the person of Chou En-lai. The internal problems of the cultural revolution took toll of his health and he came through that revolution in the same position as Premier of that country. In personal relations with Australia, he had much to do with the very important visit of the Australian Labor Party delegation to that country in 1971. He had a great deal to do with the exchange of representatives between the Labor Government of Australia in 1973 and his own country. The greatness of China in 1976 can be very directly associated with his ability and with his contribution to his own country. He was, by any political standards, a great man and he goes to his grave knowing that over 100 countries recognise his country.\n\nQuestion resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places.\n\npage 20\n\nDEATH OF GENERAL MURTALA RUFAI MOHAMMED\n\nMr MALCOLM FRASER:\n\nPrime Minister · Wannon · LP\n\n– General Mohammed, Nigerian Head of State and Commander of the Armed Forces, met his death on 13 February 1976. General Mohammed had served with the United Nations peace-keeping force in the Congo. He was a prominent leader of the Nigerian Federal Forces and was Minister for Communications. He became Nigerian Head of State and Commander of the Armed Forces in July 1975. His Government introduced a number of significant changes, I therefore move:\n\nThat this House records its sincere regret at the death of General Murtala Rufai Mohammed, Head of State and Commander of the Armed Forces of Nigeria and expresses to the people of Nigeria profound regret and to his family sympathy in their bereavement.\n\nMr E G Whitlam:\n\nLeader of the Opposition · WERRIWA, NEW SOUTH WALES · ALP\n\n– On behalf of the Opposition I join the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in expressing regret at the death of General Mohammed. He had been Nigerian Head of State and Commander in Chief since July last year. Just 10 years ago in this House, on 8 March 1966, Prime Minister Holt moved a motion of condolence upon the death, also by assassination, of a former Prime Minister of Nigeria, Sir Abubakar Balewa. It is a tragic blow for the Nigerian people that domestic upheaval has again deprived the nation of its leadership. General Mohammed had served in the armed forces of his country during the civil war and also with the United Nations. He had launched many programs at home in the difficult ethnic and economic situation facing his country- the most populous and perhaps the most vital and bestendowed nation in Africa. He gave his support, as his country has consistently, to the Commonwealth. We extend our sympathy to his family and our good wishes to the Government and people of his country.\n\nQuestion resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places.\n\npage 21\n\nCHAIRMAN OF COMMITTEES\n\nMr O’KEEFE:\n\nPaterson\n\n-I move:\n\nThat Mr Lucock, the honourable member for Lyne, be appointed Chairman of Committees of this House.\n\nMr Giles:\n\n– I second the motion.\n\nMr SCHOLES:\n\nCorio\n\n-I move:\n\nThat Dr Jenkins, the honourable member for Scullin, be appointed Chairman of Committees of this House.\n\nMr Bryant:\n\n– I second the motion.\n\nMr O’KEEFE (Paterson)-Mr Speaker, I commend to you and to the House the appointment of Mr Philip Ernest Lucock, C.B.E., the honourable member for Lyne, as Chairman of Committees of this House. The honourable member has had a distinguished parliamentary career, having been elected as honourable member for Lyne in a by-election on 22 March 1952. He has been re-elected on all subsequent occasions. During his membership of the House of Representatives he has demonstrated great ability and a knowledge and capacity which qualify him for the appointment which this\n\nHouse is considering. During his parliamentary terms he occupied the position of Temporary Chairman of Committees from 28 February 1956 to 20 February 1961 and served as Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees from 8 March 1961 to 27 February 1973. He has been Acting Speaker on occasions. Indeed, the honourable member’s service as Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker in previous parliaments constitutes a parliamentary record.\n\nThe position of Chairman of Committees of this House is extremely important because the occupant serves not only as Chairman of Committees but also as first deputy to the Speaker. Mr Lucock brings to the House a vast experience of parliamentary procedure. Over the years as an occupant of this important post he exhibited great tolerance, wisdom, dignity and fairness on all occasions. Mr Lucock has represented Australia on many overseas delegations, and represented this country in a most distinguished manner. In 1957 he was a member of the Australian delegation to the 12th Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York. Mr Lucock is regarded by parliamentarians in this country as an outstanding chairman who will bring great credit to this Parliament and to the position for which he is nominated. I have much pleasure in commending to the House Mr Philip Lucock as a member exhibiting the best qualities required for the position of Chairman of Committees of the House of Representatives.\n\nMr GILES:\n\nAngas\n\n– I take much pleasure from being allowed to second the motion that Mr Lucock, the honourable member for Lyne, be appointed Chairman of Committees. My friend, the honourable member for Paterson (Mr O’Keefe), has already mentioned that the honourable member for Lyne has established a record of service in this particular position in this Parliament. I go further by saying that the honourable member for Lyne has actually served as Chairman of Committees, and therefore as Deputy Speaker, under 3 Speakers to my knowledge- Speaker Cameron, Speaker Sir John McLeay, who was with us earlier today, and Speaker Sir William Aston. When the parties to which he and I belong occupied the Opposition benches, Mr Lucock served this House well as the senior Deputy Chairman of Committees. I am satisfied that he will be elected to this important position today. Perhaps he will allow me to say that this will be a proper return to the position in that it is almost a parliamentary tradition that he should occupy it. I hope I do not magnify any facet of Mr Lucock ‘s makeup by saying that.\n\nWith you, Mr Speaker, Mr Lucock will bear a heavy responsibility for the proper conduct of this House. Long may intelligent and informed chairmanship allow rational debate to be the method by which issues are decided in this House. There have been times when signs of rowdyism did occur, as you, Mr Speaker, will be well aware. In pointing out to both you, Mr Speaker, and Mr Lucock the heavy responsibility that you bear, I would like to say very sincerely that "
