        "text": "Roger Cohen\n\nPh.D. Physics\n\nCo-Founder of the CO2 Coalition, Roger W. Cohen was a highly regarded physicist with major contributions to materials science and industrial management. He passed away on September 10, 2016.\n\nAfter receiving his B.S. in Physics from MIT, Roger Cohen obtained MS and PhD in Physics from Rutgers and completed the Executive Program at the Harvard Business School.\n\nDr. Cohen spent 16 years at GE (originally the RCA) Laboratories in Princeton where he successfully demonstrated the first germanium-silicon thermoelectric power generator. This technology subsequently powered a series of outer solar system exploration spacecraft: Voyager (launched 1977), Galileo (launched 1989), Cassini (launched 1999), and New Horizons Pluto Mission (launched 2006). The oldest power units in these spacecraft are approaching their 40th year of service. He was a member of the team that successfully developed and commercialized the world’s first commercial 100,000+ Gauss superconducting magnet, a major breakthrough in the industrial application of superconductivity. Collaborating with Dr. Curtis R. Carlson, he developed an information theoretic description of the human visual system and associated software that simulates the human ability to perceive differences in displayed images. This work led to many commercial pattern recognition and image quality applications, and several awards, including the first Otto Schade Prize for an outstanding scientific achievement in the advancement of functional performance and image quality of information displays, and a special Emmy award for improved high definition television.\n\nMoving to Exxon Corporate Research Laboratories in 1978, Dr. Cohen organized and built the first research laboratory in theory and modeling at Exxon Corporation. He became Laboratory Director and then Senior Director of Exxon Corporate Research in 1984, with responsibility for half of the basic research activities in the corporation.\n\nIn the late 1980s Dr. Cohen turned to technology development. He formed and led an Innovation Group to develop and commercialize technology ideas for retail marketing. His team demonstrated the world’s first vehicle recognition/payment technology in a retail fuel setting, evolving into the current SpeedPass® system. Becoming Manager of Research Planning and Programs, Dr. Cohen initiated and deployed new strategies for key technology assets in energy, leading to the development of new high strength steels for gas pipelines, inter-corporate partnerships to advance fuel cells for transportation applications, novel technologies to find and produce hydrocarbon resources, and technologies for environmental bioremediation. He established and led the first-in-industry competitive technology intelligence function and developed and implemented program-planning systems for new science knowledge assets. While at Exxon, Dr. Cohen initiated and led the only industrial research activity in basic research on climate change. His Exxon team participated in the worldwide scientific efforts to understand climate better, and they were lead authors of key chapters of major IPCC reports. Having more time to study details of climate science after retirement, he became increasingly skeptical that increasing CO2 levels from human activities would be harmful. In the last few years of his life Dr. Cohen was convinced that more CO2 would benefit the Earth. He was a founding member of the CO2 Coalition and served on its Board.\n\nDr. Cohen was a founding member of the APS Topical Group on the Physics of Climate (GPC). His work, as a member of GPC, demonstrated that he was a force for getting at the truth. A source of tremendous integrity, he was an uncompromising believer in the principle that “Honesty must be regarded as the cornerstone of ethics in science.” http://www.aps.org/policy/statements/02_2.cfm)\n\nDr. Cohen had approximately 50 publications and five US patents in the areas of materials, electronic devices, energy, the human visual system, and technology management. He was a Fellow of the American Physical Society. He has served on Visiting Committees in the physics departments at the University of California at San Diego and the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nWilliam Happer — Chair\n\nPh.D.\n\nCo-Founder and Chair of the CO2 Coalition, Dr. William Happer, Professor Emeritus in the Department of Physics at Princeton University, is a specialist in modern optics, optical and radiofrequency spectroscopy of atoms and molecules, radiation propagation in the atmosphere, and spin-polarized atoms and nuclei.\n\nDr. Happer received a B.S. degree in Physics from the University of North Carolina in 1960 and a Ph.D. degree in Physics from Princeton University in 1964.

While serving as a Professor of Physics, he also served as Co-Director of the Columbia Radiation Laboratory from 1971 to 1976, and Director from 1976 to 1979. In 1980 he joined the faculty at Princeton University. On August 5, 1991, he was appointed Director of Energy Research in the Department of Energy by President George Bush. While serving in that capacity under Secretary of Energy James Watkins, he oversaw a basic research budget of some $3 billion, which included much of the federal funding for high energy and nuclear physics, materials science, magnetic confinement fusion, environmental and climate science, the human genome project, and other areas.\n\nHe remained at the DOE until May 31, 1993, to help the Clinton Administration during the transition period. He was reappointed Professor of Physics at Princeton University on June 1, 1993, and named Eugene Higgens Professor of Physics and Chair of the University Research Board from 1995 to 2005. From 2003 until his retirement in 2014, he held the Cyrus Fogg Brackett Chair of Physics.\n\nFrom 1987 to 1990 he served as Chairman of the Steering Committee of JASON, a group of scientists and engineers who advise agencies of the Federal Government on matters of defense, intelligence, energy policy and other technical problems. He was a trustee of the MITRE Corporation from 1993 to 2011, he is the Chair of the Board of the Richard Lounsbery Foundation, and the Chair of the Board of the Marshall Institute. From 2002 to 2006 he chaired of the National Research Council’s Standing Committee on Improvised Explosive Devices that supported the Joint Improvised Explosive Devices Defeat Organization of the Department of Defense. He was a co-founder in 1994 of Magnetic Imaging Technologies Incorporated (MITI), a small company specializing in the use of laser polarized noble gases for magnetic resonance imaging. He invented the sodium guide star that is used in astronomical adaptive optics to correct for the degrading effects of atmospheric turbulence.\n\nFrom September 2018 to September 2019, Dr. Happer served as Deputy Assistant to the President and Senior Director of Emerging Technologies on the National Security Council.\n\nHe has published over 200 peer-reviewed scientific papers. He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

Sloan Fellowship in 1966, an Alexander von Humboldt Award in 1976, the 1997 Broida Prize and the 1999 Davisson-Germer Prize of the American Physical Society, and the Thomas Alva Edison Patent Award in 2000.\n\nHugh Kendrick\n\nPh.D.\n\nDr. Kendrick has degrees in mechanical and nuclear engineering from the Imperial College of Science and Technology, the California Institute of Technology, and the University of Michigan. Later, he qualified as a Professional Engineer in the State of California.\n\nHis interest in aircraft and engineering led him to become apprenticed to Vickers-Armstrongs (aircraft) where he helped build Scimitars—single-seat, twin-engine aircraft—for the Royal Navy. He realized a boyhood dream to learn to fly by joining the Royal Air Force (RAF) Volunteer Reserve from which, incidentally, the RAF drew many of its pilots for the Battle of Britain in WWII.\n\nHis career later included conducting and managing research programs in pure and applied sciences in academia, the private sector, as well as service in the US Department of Energy. For example, research in condensed matter physics led to the co-discovery of the first order magnetic phase change in chromium.\n\nAs senior manager at SAIC and while Director of Plans and Analysis in DOE’s Nuclear Reactor Research Programs, he developed innovative methods applied to nuclear materials safeguards and nuclear non- and counter-proliferation. He acted as point in USG for assessment of proliferation resistance of alternative nuclear fuel cycles, both in international meetings, and in the US. In the 10-volume report that he managed, pulling together results from research programs at 35 institutions including the National Laboratories and private companies, he wrote the volumes dealing with proliferation resistance and counter proliferation assessments. For example, one of his programs at Lawrence Livermore laboratory resulted in the conclusion that “there is no non weapons-usable plutonium.”\n\nHis multi-disciplinary teams at SAIC conducted environmental impact, economic and cost-risk benefit analyses for many USG Agencies, including some that involved nuclear materials safeguards and proliferation risk assessment. For example, his team’s assessment of the DOE’s Light Water Breeder Program was published as Volume IV of ERDA-1541. He was a member of the Atomic Industrial Forum’s Safeguards Policy Committee.\n\nAfter his service in USG, he returned to SAIC, by then a multi-billion dollar corporation, as a member of the Executive Management team, where he held various positions, including Deputy Chief Operating Officer, that focused generally on all aspects of risk management. In addition, he managed the selection and conduct of a portfolio typically of 30-50 annual internal research programs in applied sciences.\n\nAt Imperial College in London, he was awarded a First Class Honours degree, the Associateship of the City and Guilds of London Institute, and the Henrici Medal for mathematics.\n\nHe won scholarships and fellowships throughout his academic career, and outstanding achievement awards and certificates during his USG service.\n\nHe was a member of the Nuclear Safety Committee of the National Research Council, and of the Selection Committee for DOE’s Ernest O. Lawrence Award. He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS), a member of the American Nuclear Society (ANS), and the American Chemical Society (ACS), a past member of the Institute for Nuclear Materials Management (INMM) and of the American Society for the Advancement of Science.\n\nHe has authored and co-authored papers in refereed journals that include Physical Review Letters, Physical Review, Journal of Applied Physics, Nuclear Instruments and Methods, and publications of ANS and INMM. He has been an invited author, speaker, and panelist before public, professional, industry, and academic audiences. His subjects included energy alternatives and energy policy, the prospects for nuclear energy, US energy programs, the relationship between nuclear energy and international security, nuclear safety research, and nuclear non- and counter-proliferation.\n\nPatrick Baeuerle\n\nPh.D.\n\nPatrick A. Baeuerle studied biology at the universities of Konstanz and Munich (LMU), Germany, and holds a M.Sc. from the University of Konstanz and a Ph.D. summa cum laude from the LMU. He trained at the Max-Planck Institute for Neurochemistry in Martinsried and at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany) with Prof. Wieland Huttner. Patrick’s graduate work was on tyrosine sulfation of proteins. From 1987-1989, he performed post-doctoral training with Nobel laureate Dr. David Baltimore at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA) where he discovered IkappaB and RelA (p65) subunits of transcription factor NF-kappaB, a key regular of inflammation and immune defense.\n\nBack in Germany, Patrick led an independent research group at the GeneCenter of the LMU in Martinsried (Director: Prof. Ernst-Ludwig Winnacker) where he deciphered the canonical pathway of NF-kappaB activation and novel functions of the transcription factor. His habilitation at the LMU was in 1992. At the age of 34, Patrick was called as full Professor and Chairman of Biochemistry to the Medical Faculty of the University of Freiburg, Germany. After less than three years in Freiburg, he moved to California to head up small molecule drug discovery at Tularik, a biopharmaceutical start-up company based in South San Francisco.\n\nFrom California, Patrick moved back in 1998 to Martinsried, Germany, where he became Chief Scientific Officer of Micromet, a biopharmaceutical company at the Institute for Immunology of the LMU. Over the years, Micromet became a pioneer in the industry in the development of so-called T cell-engaging bispecific (BiTE) antibodies for cancer therapy. Its CD19/CD3-bispecific BiTE antibody blinatumomab and drug pipeline led to the acquisition of Micromet by AMGEN in 2012 for $1.12B. Blinatumomab was approved by the FDA in 2014 in less than three months as Blincyto®, a therapy for treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Patrick served for the following three years as Vice President of Research and General Manager of AMGEN Research Munich GmbH.\n\nIn 2015, Patrick joined the Boston-based venture capital firm MPM Capital LLC as an Executive Partner. Since then, Patrick has co-founded at MPM a total of eight biotech companies developing novel cancer therapies: Harpoon, iOmx, Maverick, TCR², Werewolf, Aktis, Cullinan and Crossbow. At Cullinan, he currently serves as Chief Scientific Advisor and Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board. Patrick is also a scientific advisor to iOmx, Aktis and Crossbow. Four of Patrick’s companies went public on NASDAQ (TCR2, Harpoon, Cullinan and Werewolf), and three companies were acquired (Maverick, TCR2 and Harpoon). Two are still private (Aktis and Crossbow).\n\nPatrick is the recipient of Xconomy’s 2019 “Entrepreneur (“X”) of the Year” award, and of EMBL’s 2019 Lennart Philipson Award in recognition of his many contributions to the development of cancer immunotherapies. In 2021, he was elected by Endpoints News to be among the 20 most influential R&D executives in the US. To date, he has published 257 PubMed-listed papers that have been cited more than 87,000 times. He currently has a Hirsh index of 143 and was rated to be among the top 0.01% of most frequently cited scientists (Ioannides et al., 2019). Patrick Baeuerle is a member of the Leopoldina, Germany’s National Academy of Sciences.\n\nPatrick is a passionate scientist, which made him critically look at the current narrative and science behind climate change, the ensuing political actions and the highly biased depiction of climate change in the media.\n\nRobert Bauman\n\nMechanical Engineering\n\nMr. Bauman earned a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Wisconsin in 1969 and started with GE as programmer and sales engineer in process computers, eventually specializing in telecommunications and teleprinters. In 1973 he joined Hazeltine, a pioneer in video display terminals. After 8 years in Silicon Valley as their top salesman and regional manager, he left to start a rep and systems integration firm in Phoenix. His business expanded into distributed networks becoming a VAR for Sun Microsystems. In 1986, Mr. Bauman invented the “computer safe” for closed-door operation of online electronic devices. To promote the concept, he founded Trusted Systems, Inc., and in 1992 received the first Government approval for protecting classified networks.\n\nSince then, Mr. Bauman secured several patents while expanding Trusted Systems’ product line to incorporate a defense in-depth strategy to protect against kinetic attack, insider threat, and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) intrusion for Military, Intelligence, and Executive branch agencies, especially the Department of Energy. His focus on threats from an EMP attack drew his attention to the vulnerability of the power grid that could damage or destroy all electronics, such as HV transformers and SCADA systems in its path. Mr. Bauman’s response was to expand his company’s product line to include EMP-hardened shelters to shield critical electronics for classified networks or critical infrastructures like the power grid. His collaboration in the industry includes membership in the FBI-sponsored INFRAGARD and its EMP Special Interest Group and the Save-the-Grid Coalition. In addition, he was appointed as a technical advisor to the Congressional EMP Caucus Task Force on National and Homeland Security.\n\nConcurrent with his sense of urgency for protecting the grid from an EMP attack, Mr. Bauman turned his attention to grid resiliency as he recognized an EMP event is not the only threat. A self-inflicted threat exists from the demonization of fossil fuels and CO2 emissions, a naïve overindulgence in wind and solar, and the dismissal of the optimal long-term, base load power alternative, nuclear power. Mr. Bauman entered the arena of the climate debate by participating in the Heartland Institute’s 2011 ICCC-6 Conference, and subsequently, each conference since. In 2012, Mr. Bauman was invited to join The Right Climate Stuff (TRCS), an independent climate research group made up of retired NASA Apollo engineers. He is a strong supporter of the CO2 Coalition, CFACT, and other like organizations, to promote climate realism to counteract the religious fervor and misrepresentation of climate alarmists.\n\nFrom his early days as a programmer at GE working on process control systems for their Mark 40 nuclear reactor, Mr. Bauman applied his engineering skills and growing knowledge to advocate for advancing the next generation small modular reactors (SMRs) on Capitol Hill. His expertise and solutions-based approach was recognized in the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster, where he was called on as a Congressional technical advisor to senior leaders from Japan to explore explosion-proof alternatives. Mr. Bauman is a passionate proponent for educating Congress and the public on nuclear power, the fallacies of the climate change agenda, and the threats posed by an EMP attack that warrant a priority focus on grid resiliency.\n\nSamit Bhattacharyya\n\nPh.D.\n\nAbout The Member\n\nDr. Samit K. Bhattacharyya is President of RENMAR Enterprises, Inc, a Technical and Management Consulting Services Company. The company serves a broad portfolio of government and private sector clients in the area of advanced nuclear technology and applications.

He has published widely (over 200 publications) and participated in national and international conferences as organizer, speaker and keynote presenter. During this period, he also earned a master’s degree in Business Administration from the University of Chicago as well as the Professional Engineer registration.\n\nBhattacharyya left ANL in 2003 to operate RENMAR Enterprises, Inc. A highlight of his work was as the nuclear lead and one of the identified Key personnel for the Northrop Grumman team that won the major NASA contract (Project Prometheus) on the development of a nuclear powered probe to the moons of Jupiter. Bhattacharyya was recruited in 2007 to join the Savannah River Nuclear Solutions, LLC team that bid for and won the operating contract for the DOE’s Savannah River Site. Bhattacharyya was one of the two Key personnel required in that proposal, and assumed the directorship of the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) located at the Savannah River Site. SRNL is one of DOE’s twelve National Laboratories, and is the Corporate Laboratory of the DOE’s Environmental Management Office. In this position, Bhattacharyya was responsible for the management, operations and planned growth of the Laboratory. The Laboratory had ~ 1000 employees and conducted R&D on a diversified portfolio of projects in the Environmental Management, National Security and Energy Security areas. Bhattacharyya served as Laboratory Director for two years, after which he returned to running RENMAR Enterprises.\n\nDr. Bhattacharyya is a fellow of the American Nuclear Society and has won a number of Awards for his work.

He also serves on a number of technical, corporate and civic boards.\n\nEdward Bohn\n\nPh.D.\n\nAbout The Member\n\nDr. Bohn’s early interest in science led him to a career first, as a research scientist, and later, as a technology entrepreneur. He attended the University of Illinois 1959-1968 receiving a BS in Engineering Physics and a Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering. He was a member of the Sigma Tau engineering honor society.\n\nFor his Ph.D. thesis, Dr. Bohn was the first to make a three parameter measurement of the nuclear fission of Uranium-235 simultaneously recording the mass, energy and charge of the two particles in the splitting of the nucleus. This led to a more complete understanding of the nuclear fission process. Throughout his graduate studies he maintained his qualifications as an Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) licensed nuclear reactor operator.\n\nDr. Bohn began his career as a nuclear reactor research scientist at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) where he gained international recognition for his work in reactor physics. He led the group conducting experimental studies of commercial scale, plutonium-fueled breeder reactors at the ANL Chicago site. Dr. Bohn was chosen by the AEC to chair the National Cross Section Working Evaluation Group, 1974-1976. This group, made up of nuclear scientists from the national laboratories and universities, was responsible for reviewing the latest basic nuclear reaction data and certifying its use for the design of both commercial and defense nuclear devices. I this capacity, he delivered the keynote presentation at the International Conference on Nuclear Cross Sections and Technology in Washington, D.C., 1975. He was selected as the outstanding engineering graduate by the University of Illinois Nuclear Engineering Department in 1977.\n\nDr. Bohn had a keen interest in the field of economics especially as it applied to energy technologies and strategies. He enrolled in the University of Chicago evening program to pursue this interest, earning an MBA with majors in finance and economics in 1976. He qualified for University honors and was named to Beta Gamma Sigma business honor society. While at Chicago, he studied and worked closely with Professor Merton Miller (1990 Nobel Prize winner in Economics) to develop a macroeconomic computer simulation of energy use in the U.S. economy. This interest led to his appointment as Director, Energy Conservation programs at ANL (1977-1979) entailing the development of more efficient energy systems and technologies.\n\nDr. Bohn followed his entrepreneurial bent when he joined TRW, Inc. in 1979 to participate in the start-up of their energy technology business. He became the Director, Company Planning and Director, New Business Venture for TRW’s $3.5 billion Space and Defense Sector. In this capacity, he supported the Sector’s operating units in the development of strategic business plans.\n\nIn 1990, Dr. Bohn was recruited to run QUEST Integrated, Inc. of Kent, Washington, formerly the Flow Research Company. As President, he led the revival of the company, more than doubling its size and returning the company to a healthy, profitable enterprise with the development of advanced, high-pressure waterjet systems and laser-based measurement technologies for the government and commercial markets. In 1996, Dr. Bohn left QUEST to pursue his own interests. He taught a course in Strategic Business Planning to second-year MBA students at the University of Washington while developing plans for a start-up company.\n\nIn 1997, with the backing of local investors, Dr. Bohn co-founded Tempress Technologies, Inc. (TTI) and served as its first President. TTI develops and produces high-pressure hydraulic drilling tools for the oil and gas industry. These tools proved to be highly efficient for hydrofracturing in shale formations. TTI was acquired by Oil States International of Houston, Texas, and operates today as a wholly-owned subsidiary.\n\nDr. Bohn was recruited by the venture capital group of Battelle Memorial Institute to turn around Plasma Technology, Inc. (PTI). PTI was engaged in the development of large-scale, induction-coupled plasma reactors for conversion of wastes into clean energy fuels. As CEO, Dr. Bohn relocated the company to Seattle, renamed PTI to Thermal Conversion Corp. (TCC), acquired full-scale demonstration facilities and completed operational testing at which point TCC was acquired by Novatec.\n\nDr. Bohn served on the Board of Directors for Quest, TTI and TTC.\n\nHoward Thomas Brady\n\nPh.D.\n\nAbout The Member\n\nMemberships: Explorers Club New York; Australian Academy of Forensic Sciences\n\nAwards: Distinquished Alumnus Scientist of the Year, Northern Illinois University in 2011, for his contributions to Antarctic science and the community\n\nDr Howard Thomas Brady has had a diverse career. Apart from his scientific degrees (M.Sc and Ph.D in Antarctic science), Howard has Diplomas in Philosophy and Theology. Howard was a Catholic priest with an interest in science and, after a short teaching career, was involved with the United States Office of Polar Programs as a scientist for two summers as the US Navy Chaplain to McMurdo Station and the South Pole Station. In the 1970s, Howard was on 4 mainland Antarctic expeditions and one short expedition to Macquarie Island. He specialised in using microscopic diatom fossils to trace the climate and geological history of Antarctica. He was involved in the first ever holes drilled: in rock on the Antarctic mainland: off the pack ice into the Ocean Floor of McMurdo Sound (The Dry Valley Drilling Project); and through the Ross Ice Shelf (The Ross Ice Shelf Project).\n\nIn 1980, Howard entered ordinary life and the business world. In 1987, he co-founded a listed public oil company called Mosaic Oil. The Company explored for oil and gas in Papua New Guinea and Queensland, Australia. Between 1998 to 2000 Howard also managed a company with contracts from the Sydney City Council to repave the main plazas of Sydney in preparation for the 2000 Olympic Games. Howard returned to Academia in 2005 and was an Honorary Associate of Macquarie University until 2011. During this period he examined coastal processes and sea level rise along the south coast of New South Wales, Australia. This led to his interest in the broader subject of climate change, and in 2016 Howard published a book ‘Mirrors and Mazes: a guide through the climate debate’. The first edition sold out quickly, and in 2017 the 2nd edition was released. The book is available from the website in Australia and overseas through Amazon. The book was written in a popular style, so ordinary people would be given a framework to generally understand the climate debate. The book was also designed to be an introductory climate reader for students.\n\nHobbies: Howard has had a long-term interests in cryptology and also in understanding human error in major accidents. Other interests include the piano and golf.\n\nWebsite: http://www.mirrorsandmazes.com.au/\n\nJim Buell\n\nPhD\n\nI received my B.A. (Biology) from Occidental College in 1966, and my Ph.D. (Biology; comparative physiology / biochemistry) from the University of Oregon in 1973. I have focused on the biology and ecology of salmonid and other freshwater and estuarine fishes. I worked for a private consulting firm from 1974 to 1977, when I left to start my own environmental consulting business. I am now mostly retired and reside in Portland, Oregon.\n\nAlmost all my work has been in western North America: California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, British Columbia and Alaska. Clients have included large and small projects in the private sector (ports/marinas, small hydro, energy facility siting, timber interests, mills, large pipelines, mines, agricultural interests, permitting, etc.); various state and federal (US and Canadian) agencies; environmental groups and private individuals. For a few years in the mid-‘80s I was heavily involved in Bonneville Power Administration's Fish and Wildlife Program (emphasis on large and small energy development mitigation projects and aquatic habitat rehabilitation and enhancement); between 1995 and 2003 about a third of my time involved the California \"water wars\" and several other projects in Northern California. Since the early '80s, however, most of my consulting work has been in Alaska, and has mostly involved large projects (mines, ports, mills, pipelines, etc.). As an environmental consultant, I have had extensive (and mostly cordial) interactions with the regulatory world; these have nearly always been constructive and oriented toward problem-solving rather than problem perpetuation.\n\nHaving specialized in anadromous fishes, I have long had an interest in climate systems and both shorter- and longer-term variations. When Al Gore first came out with his preposterous book, I immediately knew he had taken a wrong turn, and was engaged in a political, not a scientific campaign. Consequently, when climate hysteria became a very big business, I have found fellowship with the other side... this side.\n\nNaturally, the subject of marine systems' interactions with atmospheric systems is of particular interest to me, including the carbonate cycle and some of the kinetics of carbonate equilibria, and how these factors tend to help explain \"rates, routes and reservoirs\" of CO2 flux. Paleoclimatology is also of great interest to me. I try to keep up with the technical nature of the \"climate debate\" to the best of my abilities, but I'm not a physicist, nor a trained meteorologist, so I leave the very technical aspects to those who excel in these areas.\n\nFrits Buningh\n\nB.S. Computer Science\n\nFrits Buningh trained in the 1970s at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) to become a mining engineer, specializing in ventilation. After working in a German coal mine in 1974, he worked in a Canadian copper mine in 1976-77—the Kid Creek Mine near Timmins, Ontario, one of the deepest underground mines in the world. Kid Creek’s #2 mine shaft was almost two miles deep (9800 feet = 1.85 Miles), and he experienced going down that deep when it was being developed. These experiences gave him a profound appreciation for geological time scales, something that seems lost amid the climate crisis hysteria of today.\n\nLater in life Mr. Buningh embarked on a successful career in data management for various US publishers, including the Washington Times Corporation, United Communications Group (UCG) and the Military Times Publishing/Gannett Company. Along the way he graduated cum laude with a BS in computer science from the University of Maryland. At Military Times he spent two years overhauling a COBOL program written in the early 1990s for a complicated co-palletization scheme for the four military titles—Army Times, Air Force Times, Navy Times, and Marine Times—translating it into the then (2009) newer SQL-DTS language. This work gave him the experience in data modeling that is useful for his recent focus on analyzing the Antarctica temperature data presentations—or rather, misrepresentation by the Climate Change Institute of the University of Maine.\n\nIn the publishing industry, it is common to be subjected to rigorous audits for advertising purposes (conducted by the ABC or BPA audit bureaus) in order to justify ad rates, as well as postal audits to qualify for substantial discounts like second class postage or what is now called magazine rates. None of this auditing is present in the climate data claims realm. To provide accountability to their audiences, the data presented by the Climate Change Institute of the University of Maine, the NOAA Models (CFS and others), the UN IPCC, and the Copernicus Institute, ought to be subjected to a similar rigorous auditing procedure by an independent body. Mr. Buningh aims to make a contribution by helping to establish some accountability in this area, which is currently entirely lacking.\n\nMr. Buningh as of October 2023 became a signatory to the There is No Climate Emergency petition by the Dutch CLINTEL foundation; he is listed under the USA as #56. Frits Buningh, Data Research Specialist.\n\nEdward C. Clukey\n\nPh.D.\n\nEdward C. Clukey earned his master's and bachelor's degrees from Worcester Polytechnic Institute and his doctorate from Cornell University. He is a registered professional engineer in California and Texas, a member of the Society of Underwater Technology and a Fellow in the American Society of Civil Engineering (ASCE) and a Diplomate (retired) in ASCE for both Geotechnical and Ocean Engineering.\n\nFor the past 45 years, Dr. Clukey has focused on offshore geotechnical engineering for the development of oil and gas reserves. His research at Cornell and in the early part of his professional career addressed problems on wave-seafloor interaction. He was Geotechnical Advisor at BP America (1998-2015) and worked on deepwater foundations, geotechnical aspects of pipelines and risers, as well as geotechnical problems related to earthquake and arctic engineering. Previously, he helped initiate the marine geotechnical program for the U. S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park California (1976-78). Prior to his BP experience he worked for McClelland Engineers (1983-1985) and Exxon Production Research (1985-1998). During his time with Exxon, he was involved as a technical analyst during the Exxon Valdez litigation (1994-1995). He won an award for preparing the technical basis for the best cross examination during the trial.\n\nSince 1991 he has been actively involved with the development of suction caisson technology for deepwater applications. This work resulted in over ten publications on the topic and the installation of over hundreds of suction caissons throughout the world for BP. He chaired the API task group which developed industry guidelines for geotechnical aspects of conductors, risers and pipelines (2007-2019), now currently in both in API and ISO design documents. Throughout his career he has championed the use of centrifuge model testing and advanced numerical models to address complex offshore geotechnical technical issues. He managed ten centrifuge programs for problems related to ice gouging of the seafloor, suction caisson technology, piles capacity in Angolan soils, conductor and SCR fatigue, and the seismic response of steel jacket structures and subsea manifolds. Since his retirement from BP he formed his own company (GeoMaxEd), become an active committee member in ASCE’s COPRI division developing a standard practice for renewable energy as well as a member of the ASCE Geo-Institute developing guidelines for the risk and reliability of geotechnical structures and foundations. He was an invited lecturer at MIT from 2016 to 2019. Dr. Clukey is the author of 55 technical publications and his experience covers many regions of the world. He was selected and gave the distinguished fifth McClelland lecture in August 2022.\n\nDuring the past few years, he has become interested in the science behind climate change and has investigated the potential risks that will impact society regarding policy decisions on this issue. He has compiled a presentation that summarizes the impact of human activity on global warming and climate change, potential outcomes regarding policy decisions and costs for the proposed solutions. He has given this presentation to over 100 individual and several professional societies including C-CORE, SUT and the ASCE leadership committee. Recently he has been invited by the ASCE Energy Division to submit a paper summarizing his views on climate change.\n\nRaphael D’Alonzo\n\nPh.D. Analytical Chemistry\n\nRaphael (Ray) P. D'Alonzo is retired from the Procter & Gamble Company (P&G) and a former University of Massachusetts Amherst visiting and adjunct professor and former University of Cincinnati Evening College instructor.\n\nDr. D'Alonzo obtained a B.Sc. in chemistry with honors in 1974 from the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy & Science (acquired by St. Joseph's University in 2022) and his Ph.D. in analytical chemistry in 1977 from the University of Massachusetts Amherst where he studied and developed a variety of atomic absorption and emission spectroscopic methods for quantifying trace organic compounds in food, pharmaceutical and environmental samples under Prof. Sidney Siggia.\n\nAfter receiving his Ph.D., he joined P&G's Foods Division where he applied a variety of chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques for the determination of trace organics in food products and packaging materials. In 1982, he was appointed Director of Analytical Chemistry in P&G's Bar Soap & Household Cleaning Products Division and in 1983 was elected Chair of P&G's Worldwide Analytical Coordinating Committee, a body composed of 23 analytical organization leaders from around the world managing more than 200 Ph.D. analytical chemists. In 1984, he was transferred to P&G Pharmaceuticals where he managed the research program that discovered risedronate which successfully progressed to become Actonel®, a 1.7 billion dollar osteoporosis drug. He was appointed Senior Director in 1986 where he managed a variety of clinical research and operational departments for the next 22 years. Under his leadership, P&G Pharmaceuticals received patents for novel potent and broad-spectrum anti-infective compounds, regulatory approval for the first non-steroidal osteoporosis drug in the world (etidronate in France) and became the first pharmaceutical company in the world to implement a system for harvesting and validating clinical data using the Internet as documented in Harvard Business School case study #9-606-033. In 2006, he was appointed Senior Manager in P&G's R&D Administration organization with responsibility for worldwide university technical relations until he retired in 2008.\n\nDr. D'Alonzo has been active in several professional organizations including the American Chemical Society (ACS), the Society for Applied Spectroscopy, the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research, and the Chiari & Syringomyelia Patient Education Foundation. He has served as Chair of the ACS Cincinnati Section composed of 1,600 members and as President of the Cincinnati Section of the Society for Applied Spectroscopy.\n\nDr. D'Alonzo's publications are diverse ranging from various topics in analytical chemistry to pharmacoeconomics. He has been invited to speak on various topics of analytical chemistry and drug research and development at over a dozen colleges and universities.\n\nIn 1995, Dr. D'Alonzo was honored as the recipient of the University of Massachusetts Distinguished Alumni Award and later in 2000 with the University's highest award, the Chancellor's Medal.\n\nSince retirement, Dr. D'Alonzo has become the owner of several successful small startup businesses and has served on the board of directors of the Northern Cincinnati Community Foundation and the Joint Economic Development District I of Liberty Township, Ohio.\n\nDavid L.

He obtained a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MB,ChB., or MD equivalent) from the University of Cape Town. He was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship and proceeded to study at Oxford (Exeter College, South-Africa-at-Large, 1972). He completed his Doctor of Philosophy (D.Phil.) in fluid dynamics/hemodynamics as well as his physician specialist degree (MRCP) in three years and returned to Cape Town where he began his cardiology training at the famed Groote Schuur Hospital. He married his Irish wife Margaret and emigrated to the USA where he served as a Professor of Medicine (Cardiology), Director of the Coronary Care Unit, Director of the Cardiology Fellowship training program, and Associate Director of the Division of Cardiology at the University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas TX. He retired from this position in 1990 as a tenured full Professor of Medicine. During that period, he was elected a Fellow of the American College of Cardiology, a Fellow of the American Heart Association, a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, and also obtained an MBA. He also served on the National Council of the American Federation for Clinical Research and chaired the Public Policy committee.\n\nFrom 1990-1992 he was Executive Director for Worldwide Cardiovascular Strategic Product Planning at Bristol Myers Squibb, and from 1992-1995 Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice President, of GH Besselaar Associates, the largest worldwide Contract Research organization, with 650 employees at 4 locations in the US as well as Sydney, Australia. He joined Johnson and Johnson Interventional Systems in 1995 prior to its merger with Cordis Corporation. During the next 13 years he was directed clinical trials of the original coronary and peripheral arterial Palmaz stents, development and clinical trials of their successors, and ultimately development of the world’s first drug-eluting coronary stent, the CYPHER™ sirolimus eluting-stent. He served successively as Worldwide Vice President of Research and Development, Clinical Research, Health Economics and Reimbursement and played a central role in court over 10 years in defending the stent patents held by Johnson & Johnson (J&J), resulting in $3.6 billion cumulative payments to J&J. The clinical trials performed with these stents dramatically changed the treatment of coronary artery disease, and especially acute myocardial infarction (MI) or “heart attacks”, the leading cause of death in western societies. There are now estimated to be over 50 million people with stents worldwide.\n\nAfter retiring from J&J in 2008, he spent the next 9 years serving on multiple non-profit Boards, including Heritage Conservancy, a not-for-profit organization in Bucks County, Pennsylvania that specializes in land conservation and natural resource protection. From 2017 until early this year, he served on the Board and as Chief Scientific Officer for Thrombolex Inc. He was the Principal Investigator on an NIH grant that funded the pivotal RESCUE clinical trial for the treatment of patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE), using the BASHIR™ Endovascular Catheter. This trial showed best in class efficacy and safety with a device that has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of PE, as happened with coronary stents in the treatment of patients with acute MIs. PE is the third leading cause of cardiovascular death after acute MI and stroke worldwide.\n\nMichael Hogan\n\nPh.D.\n\nC. Michael Hogan is a physicist with a B.S. from Princeton University and Ph.D. from Stanford University. An explorer at heart, he has conducted environmental research in 68 different countries. Hogan held graduate faculty positions at Santa Clara University and UC Davis. Early work at Princeton included the research team that published the first decoding of a Messenger RNA (sea urchin). He founded and led Earth Metrics Inc., a United States-based environmental science think tank that conducted over 3,600 original research studies for the U.S. EPA, FAA, US Army Corps of Engineers, USGS and 17 different State governmental agencies. With the CIA, he led teams for design of hardware and software for satellite foreign surveillance. His research is centered on atmospheric physics and chemistry, including such aspects as the urban heat island, greenhouse gas effects, and ocean dynamics.\n\nDr. Hogan held a position with the National Academy of Sciences advising the U.S. President and Congress on environmental issues, notably in air and noise pollution, as well as water quality. In Hogan’s early work he led the design team for the NASA Apollo re-entry heat shield, and later focused on ferromagnetic spin-wave quantum mechanics, which is the basis of present day silicon chip manufacture. He also was project manager for the CIA first satellite system to attain high resolution video imagery that could be transmitted back to Earth in real time.\n\nHe is currently conducting research on U.S. national energy policy and climate. Recent work includes a series of 90 publications developed in conjunction with the World Wildlife Fund on the forests of the world. Previously served a term as Editor-in-Chief of the Encyclopedia of Earth, a platform where 554 scientists published peer-reviewed articles on a global perspective. Hogan has served as Chairman and CEO of Earth Metrics Inc., the Humane Society of San Mateo County, and the California Arts and Sciences Institute. He has also served on the Board of the Encyclopedia of Earth, the California Association of Environmental Professionals, and the Monterey Museum of Art. Hogan has authored over 1210 scientific books and peer-reviewed articles in atmospheric physics, historic climate eras (e.g. Little Ice Age, Medieval Warm Period) terrestrial ecosystems, and U.S. energy policy. Example publications are agriculture environmental impacts in the Cengage Encyclopedia; development of the first line source model for air pollution dispersal (EPA); the first statistical model for meteorological prediction of thermal pollution from nuclear power plants (EPA); acoustical analyses for eight major U.S.A. airports (FAA); all cetacean profiles for the Encyclopedia of Earth (in conjunction with the World Wildlife Fund); new over the horizon electromagnetic missile detection hardware system (CIA); and the first pesticide runoff model for the U.S. EPA (Southeast Water Laboratory).\n\nCharles Hohenberg\n\nPh.D.\n\nAbout this Member\n\nCharles Hohenberg has been a Professor of Physics at Washington University for 45 years. He received his BS in Physics from Princeton in 1962 and his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1967. He is an experimental physicist who designs and builds his own equipment, utilizing the sensitivity of noble gas mass spectrometry in a number of different fields. During the course of his research he developed new high-precision ion-counting noble gas mass\n\nspectrometer systems, and the associated ultra-low-blank auxiliary systems, capable of measuring noble gas isotope ratios at the thousand atom level. Studying the abundances of now extinct 129 I and 244 Pu, he developed early self-consistent models for galactic nucleosynthesis. Through a large, multi-year effort, he developed 129 I into a refined I-Xe dating method suitable for delineating early Solar System evolution with a resolution of 100,000 years or less. Necessary in his work was development of pulsed and CW laser systems for the extraction of noble gases from individual micron-sized grains. The precision of I-Xe dating and laser excision allows determination of cooling rates of iron meteorites. He discovered the first hard evidence for an early active (T-Tauri) sun by observing quantities of spallation-produced 21 Ne in individual meteoritic olivine grains which contained cosmogenic 21 Ne far in excess of that due to contemporary sources of energetic particles (solar and galactic cosmic rays and secondaries). Measured  decay half-lives by the accumulation of heavy noble gas daughter products, including the longest half-life ever experimentally measured (8.0 x 10 24 years for 128 Te, measured in 2 billion year old native Te). He refined the 81 Kr-Kr exposure age dating method and established the ages of many prominent lunar features (Tyco, North Ray crater and South Ray crater to precisions of a few percent), and studied meteorite exposure ages and lunar surface dynamics by the same method. He investigated the ancient natural spontaneous chain reactions in old uranium deposits Oklo (Gabon), a natural reactor) deposits. Recent work for the Stardust Mission led to the documentation of “anomalous adsorption” of heavy noble gases, a new mechanism for incorporation of heavy noble gases onto 2-D surfaces involving chemical rather than Van der Waals bonds. As a member of the Genesis and Stardust mission science teams, much recent activity has been in construction of multiple multiplier noble gas mass spectrometers in house, and collaborative design efforts with two commercial manufacturers: Nu-Instruments and GV Instruments. Results from the Genesis Mission has led to the highest precision determination of Kr and Xe isotope ratios in the solar wind, by inference the Sun, the starting composition of the solar system. He has been fully supported by NASA for all of his research activities.\n\nDr. Hohenberg remained at Berkeley for two and a half years after receiving his PhD in 1967 to study the Apollo 11 samples. He then joined the Washington University Physics Department as an Assistant Professor in 1970, becoming Full Professor in 1978, where he was an active researcher for all Apollo Missions. However, he but spent much of his time studying noble gases in meteorites, the best preserved samples of the early solar system, where I-Xe dating has helped understand its early evolution. He has published approximately 320 reviewed publications, produced a dozen PhD physicists many are actively pursuing their own exciting work (5 university faculty, 4 national laboratories).\n\nDr. Hohenberg is married to Victoria Marshall Hohenberg, the father of 4 children, and lives in St. Louis Missouri.\n\nJohn W. Jenkins\n\nMBA Finance & Marketing\n\nTexas A & M University 1952-1956 – BS Civil Engineering\n\nUnited States Air Force – 1956-1959 - Upon graduation from Texas A & M with his lieutenant’s commission, Jenkins entered the U.S. Air Force serving on active duty for three years.

(IMA). The company obtained a contract to set up a data center for the over thirty Texas Rural Electric Cooperatives in Austin and set up a second data center in Dallas. From this base, IMA expanded its business to provide software for clients of a growing international computer company. For that company, IMA established and managed a programming shop in Paris, France, to modify the software to European Common Market standards and the required language translations. IMA software was installed in companies on all six continents.\n\nOther Major Activities and Companies\n\nClini-Therm Corporation, Inc., Dallas, Texas - After a successful sale of IMA, when recommended by a HBS classmate, Jenkins was approached by the Directors of development stage, public, high tech medical equipment company in Dallas to become its president and CEO replacing its founder. At Clini-Therm Corporation, Inc., Jenkins redesigned and enlarged the product line, obtained FDA approval in record time, completed a private placement of stock with United Kingdom institutional investors, and broadened the use of the technology into new medical uses.\n\nJumpking Trampolines, Inc. – Dallas, Texas - A former IBM associate of Jenkins headed Jumpking Trampolines, a major Dallas division of Icon Health and Fitness, Inc. of Logan, Utah. Looking for growth opportunities beyond his U.S. market, he asked John to become Jumpking’s Director of International Sales. Jenkins established European dealers in Netherlands, Germany, Norway, Scandinavia, and England. He sold their product internationally to big box retailers Walmart, Sam’s Club, and Costco. Jenkins’ international sales provided Jumpking with 80 percent of its profit with just 20 percent of the company’s total sales volume.\n\nGSM International, Inc. – Dallas, Texas - The above years with Jumpking occurred from 1991 through 2004 when China was being welcomed into the world economy. China used this opportunity to destroy the profitability of Jumpking’s U.S. sales along with thousands of other American manufacturers. Icon shut down its Jumpking division in 2004. Following Jumpking’s closure, Jenkins started GSM International, Inc. For the next eighteen years, Jenkins became intimately involved with numerous Chinese manufacturing companies traveling there during China’s major expansion period. On various occasions, he represented them, competing against them, and even contracted with them to manufacture a patented, proprietary GSM product designed by Jenkins.\n\nAuthor – After selling his business operations in 2022, Jenkins finished writing “The Blessed Generation: Fifty Years on the Cutting Edge of Rapid Change”, recently published and now available on Amazon and Barnes & Noble. His new book, “Looking Through a Class Darkly: Divided America and the Gathering Storm”, should be available in September 2023.\n\nPayne Kilbourn\n\nCertified Nuclear Engineer\n\nPayne Kilbourn is now an independent consultant and writer after 28 years in the U.S. Navy Submarine Service and eight years in business.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2012 he was the CEO of Unmanned Ocean Vehicles.
