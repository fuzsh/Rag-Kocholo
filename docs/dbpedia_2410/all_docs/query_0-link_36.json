She recreated in this way the dark or glowing atmosphere of the piece, always within the pulse of the waltz, root of all colorful “Raveliana”. An excellent result, one that the audience rewarded both the orchestra and the conductor enthusiastically …not less deserving of the ovation was the outstanding work of the conductor Freeman obtaining a great number of nuances and exact synchronization…” [Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto]. (EL MERCURIO, Santiago, Chile)\n\n“Beginning the program with Beethoven’s Symphony No. 4 we noticed in Ms. Freeman Brown a great number of virtues and talents. From the detail and moderation we got a reading as neat as it was clean, careful in all its details … The climax, without a doubt, was the performance of Ravel’s La Valse, closing the program. This great symphonic poem … so appropriate to measure orchestras and conductors, was confronted by Ms. Freeman Brown with the same detailed work … a magnificent result. In all, the great orchestral mass responded in magnificent shape to a fine baton, flawless and without any histrionics”.

During his undergraduate years, he was active as a New York critic for the Musical Leader of Chicago; he also attended rehearsals of the National Orchestral Association conducted by Leon Barzin, from whom he acquired his conducting technique.

At the end of the war he found himself in Shanghai where he took over the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra for a season. After returning briefly to the USA, Sternberg moved to Vienna, making his debut with the Vienna Symphony Orchestra In 1947. He worked closely with the Haydn scholar H.C. Robbins Landon, scouring the libraries, monasteries and churches of Austria for lost manuscripts, until Robbins Landon set up the Haydn Society, for which Sternberg made a series of pioneering recordings, initially of Haydn and Mozart, not least the ‘Nelson Mass’, ‘Posthorn’ Serenade and some dozen Haydn symphonies. Other recording premieres under Sternberg included Schubert’s Second Symphony, Rossini’s Stabat mater, Prokofiev’s Fifth Piano Concerto, Milhaud’s Fantaisie Pastorale and Charles Ives’s Set of Pieces.\n\nHe also began to present modem American music to European audiences that had heard little of such repertory.

With other orchestras, Sternberg conducted the first European performances of works by Barber, Copland, Diamond and Benjamin Lees. He was also responsible for a number of world premieres, including Rorem’s First Symphony (1951) and Laszlo Lajtha’s Sixth (1961).\n\nAfter Atlanta he took up a visiting professorship of conducting at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York. On leaving he took up a similar position at Temple University, Philadelphia, where he taught and conducted for 20 years. Here, too, he conducted a number of world premieres, including Music for Chamber Orchestra by David Diamond (1976), A Lincoln Address and Night Dances by Vincent Persichetti (1977) and Stanislaw Skrowaczewski’s Ricercari notturni for three saxophones and orchestra (1978)."
