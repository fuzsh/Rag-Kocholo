This page is provided for informational purposes and reflects information available in public USPTO records.\n\nUpdated:\n\nJuly 17, 2024\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies are the only professional sports team based in Memphis, Tennessee, and they play in the NBA Western Conference Southwest Division. Originally named the Vancouver Grizzlies at their founding in 1995, the team kept the name when they moved to Memphis in 2001. The Grizzlies name was based on a “name the team” contest, and luckily the Grizzlies beat out the Mounties, or the team would have been called the Memphis Mounties. Regardless of their name before the move, in 2001, FedEx was prepared to offer the team $100 million to change the name to the “Express,” but the NBA rejected the proposal.\n\nAs such a young team, they have fewer trademarks and less logo evolution than larger teams. The first registered trademark of the “modern” Grizzlies logo was filed in 2006. It has since been modified by straightening the word Grizzlies, adding a grey outline, and tweaking the color of blue used.\n\nSimilar to many young teams, they were not successful in their early years. In 2011, the team had yet to win a playoff game, and after an injury riddled season, they began using the phrase “Believe Memphis” to inspire fans who were beginning to waver. They went on to beat the number 1 seeded Spurs in the first round of the playoffs. In addition to these phrases, in 2016 the team filed a trademark for a second playoff phrase – We Don’t Bluff – which was said by a player one time and evolved into the rally towel phrase.\n\nOne of the most interesting trademarks that the Grizzlies have filed is described as “three vertical columns with each column consisting of two shaded bars, followed by three horizontal columns with each column consisting of two shaded bars, which is followed, on the right, by three vertical columns with each column consisting of two shaded bars.” The mark is filed for a logo on clothing, but it has not been produced yet.\n\nPlease note: While we make every effort to ensure that the information provided is accurate and up-to-date, we cannot be held responsible for its accuracy or completeness.
