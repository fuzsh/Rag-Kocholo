        "text": "The first summer league game of the season didn’t go as Bronny James would have hoped for. Yet, some critics had hoped for this kind of performance and they weren’t disappointed. Shooting 0% from the 3-point line and 0% from FT, he also suffered an injury that sidelined him from the second game. Bronny’s debut display was enough for Kwame Brown to form an opinion as he remarked, “Bronny James don’t seem to have that dog in him.”\n\nThe overall #1 pick in the 2001 draft said, “If you draft me, you’ll never regret it.” Being a rookie, his underperformance was overlooked but throughout his 12-year career, Kwame Brown wasn’t able to match his hype. So much so that many people called him “Bust”, and he owned the monicker and named his YouTube channel Kwame Brown Bust Life. The 42-year-old probably knows about the heavy expectations on the shoulder and expected Bronny to play with a certain personality.\n\n“‘I’m Bronny James, that’s the attitude you supposed to have. You coming in here with this nice guy bullsh** that ain’t going to work.” Brown said on Kwame Brown Bust Life and continued that his father’s statement made it difficult for Bronny. “Your daddy talked a lot of stuff, Bronny. And unfortunately because of what your daddy said, we in the media going to be critiquing you.” Brown pointed out LeBron’s statement that Bronny was ready to play for the Lakers after a disappointing collegiate season.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nKwame Brown wants the Los Angeles Lakers #9 to play freely and take more shots. In his first game, Bronny scored 2 but attempted only 9 shots to the disliking of Brown. He wants Bronny to establish himself on the court with his domination and earn people’s respect.\n\nKwame Brown wants Bronny to display more passion on the ball and not just smile. According to him that makes LeBron’s son feel privileged in comparison to others. He also went on to compare the father-son duo to America’s most loved superhero.\n\nKwame Brown’s heroic comparison of Bronny and LeBron\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nWhile many look to draw out similarities to previous players, Brown felt it necessary to compare LeBron to Homelander. Name-dropping the infamous character from the series The Boys. But why did he make such an absurd yet popular reference? Well, simply because according to him LeBron has achieved everything and is trying too hard for his son.\n\n“I think your poor dear daddy set your a** up because he’s so busy chasing legacy that he don’t know he going to destroy you.” Furthering his domination point, Brown feels LeBron had the killer mentality Bronny lacks. This is similar to the show, where Homelander chooses to eradicate his opponents easily, and yet his son chooses compassion and avoids using his power to the full extent.\n\n“LeBron trying to force him to have it, giving him everything he need to have it. He got a four-year plan but he just don’t got it.” Unless Kwame Brown sees Bronny dominating the court, he isn’t going to change his opinion. But is it fair to judge a player by only 21 minutes of action?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nStay tuned for more such updates, and to follow what Shaq’s ex-agent, Leonard Armato, has to say about the infamous Shaq-Kobe feud, Caitlin Clark’s Olympic snub, and more, watch this video."
