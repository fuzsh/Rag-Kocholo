        "text": "ATLANTA – The Lakers fired the opening salvo when they acquired 7-foot center Pau Gasol from the Memphis Grizzlies last Friday for the low, low price of Kwame Brown and Javaris Crittenton.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns returned fire when they traded Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks to the Miami Heat for 7-1 center Shaquille O’Neal on Wednesday.\n\n“I don’t know if they just felt the need to do it or whether it was a plan to help themselves out,” coach Phil Jackson said when asked if the Pacific Division-leading Suns felt compelled to make a deal after the second-place Lakers’ traded for Gasol.\n\n“The reality is that it just changed the complexities of our division a little bit, and our conference, too,” Jackson added. “This might be one of those situations where people have to scramble a bit to keep in the bidding.”"
