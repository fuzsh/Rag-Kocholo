Ja Morant has been the heart of their unbeaten run with his incredible performances this season.\n\nThe 2020 Rookie of the Year, Ja Morant, has been insane since joining the NBA. He powered the Grizzlies to the playoffs last season for the first time in four years. And that too he did in style with 35 points against the Warriors in the newly established play-in format. However, the Grizzlies lost in the first round and were eliminated by the Jazz in five games.\n\nBut Morant didn’t stop and came back stronger this season. In his 2021-22 season opener against the Cavaliers, Morant scored 37 points in the Grizzlies victory. However, former NBA star Kwame Brown recently sparked controversy by calling him a ‘bust’.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nKwame Brown calls Ja Morant a ‘bust’\n\nFormer NBA star Kwame Brown recently expressed his opinion on Grizzlies star Ja Morant.

Don’t be confused by the title that I’m gonna put because I’m definitely gonna call you a bust cause you, my friend, are a bust… And some people don’t like that word. But I know what it means.
