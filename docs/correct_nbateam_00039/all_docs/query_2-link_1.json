        "text": "Drops triple-double in semifinals\n\nPippen had arguably his best game of Summer League, doling out 10 assists while turning the ball over only three times. The point guard is entering his third NBA season and, after showing out in Las Vegas, could be a candidate to have his two-way contract converted into a standard deal. Pippen and the Grizzlies will face the winner of Golden State vs Miami in the Summer League Championship on Monday.\n\nWon't play Sunday\n\nLaRavia is dealing with a minor ankle sprain but will likely miss the remainder of Summer League, along with rookies Zach Edey (ankle) and Cam Spencer (ankle). LaRavia, a 2022 first-round pick, has appeared in 70 regular-season games (six starts) over the last two seasons but needs to earn a roster spot during training camp.\n\nDealing with minor ankle sprain\n\nZach Edey (ankle) has also been shut down, but both rookies are expected to be 100 percent healthy for training camp. Spencer, a second-round pick in the 2024 NBA Draft, was a sharpshooter in college at UConn but will have an uphill battle to make Memphis' initial rotation as a rookie."
