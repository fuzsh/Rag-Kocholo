        "text": "Editor's note: The Grizzlies don't own a pick in the June 22 NBA draft. That could change, but there is no rewriting the team's draft history. We'll take a look back and analyze the the Grizzlies' participation in the past 16 drafts.\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies are lousy at drafting. That is a given at this point, isn’t it? They pick the wrong players.\n\nOr they pick the right players and then they turn around and deal them.\n\nThe Grizzlies spent lottery picks on Hasheem Thabeet and Xavier Henry. They drafted Kevin Love then swapped him for O.J. Mayo.\n\nBut as the Grizzlies begin to prepare for their 17th draft in Memphis — one in which they won’t have a single draft pick unless they manage to buy or trade for one — it is worth remembering that they weren’t always terrible at drafting.\n\nWhat went down\n\nIndeed, in their first draft in Memphis, the organization absolutely nailed it.\n\nThe brilliance started less than 24 hours before the draft, when the Grizzlies traded Shareef Abdur-Rahim to Atlanta in exchange for the Hawks' No. 3 overall pick as well as former University of Memphis center Lorenzen Wright and guard Brevin Knight.\n\n“We thought it was time for a change,” said Billy Knight, the general manager at the time. “It was time for the chemistry to go in a different direction.”\n\nOn draft night, the Grizzlies then spent that No. 3 pick on a 20-year-old power forward from Spain named Pau Gasol. With their own pick — No. 6 overall — the Grizzlies wanted Michigan State guard Jason Richardson. When Golden State took Richardson at No. 5, Knight walked into the makeshift media room at the Peabody Hotel, where the Grizzlies (who didn’t even have offices in Memphis yet) had set up their draft headquarters.\n\n\"You want me to tell you who we're taking?\" Knight said. \"Shane Battier is the guy we picked. We knew as soon as Golden State said they were taking Jason Richardson.\"\n\nBut the Grizzlies weren’t close to done at that point. They spent second-round picks on Clemson guard Will Solomon and Greek forward Antonis Fotsis. Then they finished the night with a flourish, sending guards Mike Bibby and Brent Price to the Sacramento Kings for guards Jason Williams and Nick Anderson.\n\nSo in one 48-hour period, the Grizzlies acquired five players who would — in one way or another — become first-name favorites for the new Memphis franchise: Pau, Shane, J-Will, Lorenzen and Brevin.\n\n“It’s called striking while the iron’s hot,” said Billy Knight. “I don’t know if we could be happier.”\n\nDraft grade: A\n\nDraft analysis\n\nThe Grizzlies have never had a better draft day. They selected a future Hall-of-Famer in Gasol. They drafted the first real face of the franchise in Battier. They brought Wright home, acquired a dazzling diversion in J-Will, and added another point guard in Brevin Knight who would, years later, turn out to be a beloved color analyst. All that, in a draft that included such lottery busts as Kwame Brown (No. 1), Eddy Curry (No 4), Eddie Griffin (No. 7) and DeSagna Diop (No. 8).\n\nIf you want to quibble, you could say the Grizzlies missed on Joe Johnson, who went No. 10, and Tony Parker, who went No. 28. And the Grizzlies started their tradition of taking second-round picks who never amounted to anything. Both Solomon and Fotsis were gone after a single season. But by dealing for the pick that became Gasol, the Grizzlies acquired their first real star, set themselves up for their first three playoff forays, and ultimately led to the Gasol-for-Gasol swap with the Lakers that has produced seven more playoff forays (and counting).\n\nOne other interesting aspect of that 2001 draft: Six other players who were drafted that night ultimately wound up in Memphis. Brown (No. 1 to Washington), Jason Collins (No. 18 to Houston), Jamaal Tinsley (No. 18 to Indiana), Gilbert Arenas (No. 31 to Golden State) and Earl Watson (No. 40 to Seattle) all spent time with the Grizzlies. And one Zach Randolph (No. 19 to Portland) would be acquired from the Clippers in a trade and become the franchise’s greatest player.\n\nWhere are they now?\n\nPau Gasol wept on Feb. 1, 2008 upon learning that he had been traded from Memphis to the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nImagine that — the 7-footer was sad even though he earlier asked to be moved and that he would join Kobe Bryant for a chance to win championships.\n\nIndeed, Gasol got over his hurt soon after and happily won two NBA championships with the Lakers.\n\nFast forward to today and Gasol is chasing another ring with the San Antonio Spurs. He just completed his first season in San Antonio after signing there last summer as a free agent. His younger brother, Marc, famously acknowledged that he would advise Pau to join the Spurs before the deal happened.\n\nPau Gasol’s decision seemed perfect until injuries to Parker and MVP candidate Kawhi Leonard in the postseason derailed the Spurs’ title hopes. Gasol, though, will get a shot at another ring next season as he inked a two-year, $30 million deal with San Antonio.\n\nHis two seasons with the Spurs figure to end better than the two years he spent with the Chicago Bulls (2014-16) after leaving Los Angeles as a free agent.\n\nBut don’t let the bouncing around fool you. Gasol’s put together a Hall-of-Fame career.\n\nHe is a six-time NBA All-Star and four-time All-NBA selection. And don’t forget that Gasol’s career got off to a bright start when he was the NBA Rookie of the Year in 2002 with the Grizzlies.\n\nLate Grizzlies owner Michael Heisley never wanted to trade Gasol. But Chris Wallace was the second Grizzlies general manager — after Jerry West — who pushed to move the Spaniard.\n\nWallace wanted assets.\n\nRemember the widely criticized haul?\n\nThe Grizzlies’ fetched Kwame Brown, Javaris Crittenton, Aaron McKie, the rights to Marc Gasol, and first-round draft picks in 2008 and 2010. After his departure, Pau Gasol said “Memphis will never win a championship.” He also left with 12 franchise records.\n\nBattier wasn’t as prolific in a Grizzlies uniform even though he’s regarded as one of the more beloved players. Perhaps it’s now time for Memphis to stop romanticizing about Battier’s relationship with the city.\n\nBattier has taken his retirement talent to South Beach.\n\nThe former Duke star is now a member of the Miami Heat front office, assuming a newly created role of director of basketball development and analytics.\n\n“My goal, as is the entire organization's, is to bring another championship back to Miami,” Battier said in February when the news was announced.\n\nTake that for data.\n\nBattier played 13 seasons in the NBA, including his last three in Miami, and helped the Heat win championships in 2012 and 2013. Many Memphians always dreamed about Battier someday returning to town after his playing days were over.\n\nA dose of reality: Battier was also enormously popular among fans and teammates during his tenure with the Heat.\n\nPerhaps he needed the sunshine after a brief and painfully awkward spell as an announcer with ESPN."
