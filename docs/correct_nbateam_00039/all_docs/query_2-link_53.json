        "text": "The Grizzlies are a professional basketball team based in Memphis, Tenn. They play in the Western Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Established in 1995, the team played six seasons in Vancouver, B.C., before moving to Memphis.\n\nThe Grizzlies were founded as one of the two Canadian expansion franchises (alongside the Toronto Raptors) to join the NBA in 1995. They were immediately one of the worst teams in the league, winning no more than 19 games in each of their first four seasons and finishing at the bottom of their division in five of the six years they spent in Vancouver. This poor play took its toll on the Grizzlies’ attendance numbers and profitability, and the team’s ownership moved the franchise to Memphis in 2001 in an attempt to increase revenue.\n\nIn the newly relocated team’s first draft, it added Spanish forward Pau Gasol, who would become the Grizzlies’ first All-Star player. In 2002 the team hired basketball icon Jerry West to serve as general manager. He quickly turned the team’s fortunes around, and in 2003–04 Memphis won 50 games (a 22-win improvement from the previous season) to make the play-offs for the first time in franchise history. The Grizzlies lost in their opening postseason series that year and did the same in both 2004–05 and 2005–06. Memphis’s successful run was short-lived, and the team fell to a last-place finish in 2006–07. West left the Grizzlies in 2007, and Gasol was traded in 2008 as the team began a rebuilding effort. Memphis returned to the play-offs in 2010–11, but they were defeated in the Western Conference semifinals."
