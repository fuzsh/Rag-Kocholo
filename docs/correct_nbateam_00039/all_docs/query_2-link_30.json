        "text": "Desmond Bane didn’t hesitate.\n\nWhen the Memphis Grizzlies wing was asked during exit interviews after the season if GG Jackson should make the NBA All-Rookie team, Bane said yes, then added that the 6-foot-9 forward would have made the first team if he played more than 48 games.\n\nBane was the last of a three-year stretch of Grizzlies players making the all-rookie team. Ziaire Williams and Jake LaRavia are among the recent first-round picks for Memphis, but injuries and slower development than the likes of Bane, Ja Morant, Brandon Clarke and Jaren Jackson Jr. have created questions.\n\nThe 2024 offseason will be a big internal developmental period for the Grizzlies, who currently have two roster spots open for the NBA draft and free agency — which means there could be limited roster movement.\n\nThe NBA summer league is the time of the offseason when signs of growth or concerns can be highlighted. Memphis has multiple key players who are planning to participate, including Scotty Pippen Jr., Trey Jemison and GG Jackson.\n\nGG Jackson headlines summer league Grizzlies\n\nGG Jackson will be challenged to be better on the ball offensively. He excelled as one of the best scoring rookies in the NBA, but his game will blossom when he can be a better distributor and playmaker. In 48 games, he had only three games with his career high of four assists. He finished the season with 65 turnovers and 59 assists.\n\nJackson's other main goals include getting more consistency out of his 3-point shot, adding a floater to his in-between game and making himself more valuable around players like Morant, Jaren Jackson Jr. and Bane.\n\n“I know that’s how I’m going to stay on the floor next year a lot,” Jackson said. “With those high-caliber guys coming back, they’re obviously going to work on defense, but we need them to put the basketball in the basket for us.”\n\nJA MORANT: Everything Ja Morant said during Memphis Grizzlies' end of season media availability\n\nScotty Pippen Jr. vying for backup minutes\n\nPippen will have the chance to be a steady force on a summer squad with a bunch of youthful moving pieces. With the Grizzlies, he got his first extended playing time of his two-year NBA career. He looked like a player who can potentially work his way into a rotational point guard role when the Grizzlies are healthy.\n\nPippen shot 41.7% on 3-pointers and 53.4% on 2-pointers. With players like Kennedy Chandler and Jacob Gilyard the past couple of seasons, Memphis had searched for quality depth options behind Morant. Pippen looks to be the best of that bunch.\n\nTrey Jemison's offseason goals\n\nJemison's 250-pound chiseled frame has often helped him be the strongest player on the floor. In the NBA, he realized he wasn't as strong as he thought he was.\n\nJemison wants to work on his pick-and-roll ability, defending and setting ball screens. He understands that his role in Memphis will be centered on his ability as a rebounder and defender more than his scoring ability.\n\n\"I'm super excited for that opportunity,\" he said of summer league. \"Just to keep growing and developing as a player. It's going to be big-time for me.\"\n\nWhat's next for Jordan Goodwin?\n\nThe third two-way contract player's situation is a little different. Goodwin stood out defensively and with his tenaciousness as a rebounder, but his future in Memphis is uncertain.\n\n\"We haven't talked about it yet,\" Goodwin told The Commercial Appeal after the final regular-season game. \" . . . I do want to go, be there for the team, be with everybody.\"\n\nROSTER UPDATE: Yuta Watanabe declines player option with Grizzlies. What does it mean for Memphis?\n\nJake LaRavia’s offseason focus\n\nLaRavia has already played in two summer leagues. First-round picks don’t usually return to summer league in their third season, but he has played a total of 70 games through two years in the NBA.\n\nSummer league or not, this is an important offseason for LaRavia. The reality is Memphis traded David Roddy, its other first-round pick from LaRavia’s 2022 draft class, so the urgency to produce has grown. The 6-7 forward averaged 10.8 points per game, but his 38.9% field goal percentage must improve.\n\n“I don’t think my percentages were that great since the All-Star break, but once I fix my finishing, it’ll be scary,” LaRavia said."
