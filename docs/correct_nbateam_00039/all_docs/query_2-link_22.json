        "text": "Pippen logged 23 points (5-15 FG, 3-5 3Pt, 10-10 FT), 10 rebounds, 10 assists, two steals and a block during 33 minutes of Sunday's Summer League semifinals game against the Clippers.\n\nPippen had arguably his best game of Summer League, doling out 10 assists while turning the ball over only three times. The point guard is entering his third NBA season and, after showing out in Las Vegas, could be a candidate to have his two-way contract converted into a standard deal. Pippen and the Grizzlies will face the winner of Golden State vs Miami in the Summer League Championship on Monday.\n\nLaRavia (ankle) has been ruled out for Sunday's Summer League semifinal matchup against the Clippers, Drew Hill of The Daily Memphian reports.\n\nLaRavia is dealing with a minor ankle sprain but will likely miss the remainder of Summer League, along with rookies Zach Edey (ankle) and Cam Spencer (ankle). LaRavia, a 2022 first-round pick, has appeared in 70 regular-season games (six starts) over the last two seasons but needs to earn a roster spot during training camp.\n\nSpencer has been shut down for the remainder of Summer League due to a minor ankle sprain, Drew Hill of The Daily Memphian reports.\n\nZach Edey (ankle) has also been shut down, but both rookies are expected to be 100 percent healthy for training camp. Spencer, a second-round pick in the 2024 NBA Draft, was a sharpshooter in college at UConn but will have an uphill battle to make Memphis' initial rotation as a rookie.\n\nEdey (ankle) has been shut down for the remainder of Summer League, Drew Hill of The Daily Memphian reports.\n\nEdey tweaked his right ankle during Thursday's win over the Pelicans. While the issue is expected to be minor, it's unsurprising to see Memphis proceed with caution. Edey, the No. 9 overall pick in the 2024 NBA Draft, is expected to compete for a rotational role in Memphis' frontcourt as a rookie.\n\nThe Nets traded Diakite to the Grizzlies in exchange for Ziaire Williams (back/hip), a 2030 second-round pick and the draft rights to Nemanja Dangubic on Friday, Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN reports.\n\nDiakite will change addresses for the second time this offseason, as he was previously traded to the Nets on July 6 as part of the deal that sent Mikal Bridges to the Knicks. The 27-year-old Diakite made just six NBA appearances in 2023-24 for the Knicks and Spurs, averaging 2.0 points in 4.0 minutes. After ultimately landing in Memphis, Diakite will likely operate as a deep reserve and likely won't be included in the Grizzlies rotation most nights.\n\nJackson dished out six assists over 32 minutes of play Thursday, adding 17 points (4-14 FG, 7-8 FT), seven rebounds, two triples and one steal in an 88-77 win over the Pelicans in Las Vegas.\n\nJackson's season high in dimes last season was four, but he had some impressive assists during Thursday's contest, so it appears that's a part of his game that he's been working on. Scotty Pippen Jr. also showed some impressive playmaking skills during Thursday's win, handing out 11 assists to go with 17 points (6-11 FG, 4-5 FT), six rebounds, one triple, three steals and just one turnover across 29 minutes. Both players have been great in Las Vegas, but if the Grizzlies are healthy next season, it'll be tough for either to earn enough minutes to make an impact in most 12-team fantasy leagues.\n\nLaRavia will not return to Thursday's Summer League game due to knee soreness, Drew Hill of The Daily Memphian reports.\n\nIt's not all that common for a third-year player to suit up for Summer League in Las Vegas, so it's not surprising to see LaRavia hit the sidelines with a minor injury. He's fine, but don't be surprised if he sits out Memphis' next exhibition as well.\n\nEdey went back to the locker room after tweaking his right ankle during Thursday's exhibition in Las Vegas, and he will not return.\n\nEdey landed on another player's foot after attempting to block a shot and rolled his ankle, although he was able to walk off the court under his own power. He may have been able to return had this been a regular-season game, but there's no reason to push it during an exhibition contest. Edey looked solid while on the court, hitting all three of his shots on his way to six points, three rebounds and one block over nine minutes.\n\nEdey (ankle) is in the starting lineup for Thursday's Summer League matchup against New Orleans.\n\nEdey hasn't played since tweaking his ankle at the Salt Lake Summer League, but he'll be making his Las Vegas debut Thursday. He shouldn't have any minutes restrictions, and the fact that he's suiting up for an exhibition game suggests that his ankle is fine.\n\nPippen recorded 25 points (9-14 FG, 1-4 3Pt, 6-7 FT), nine assists, four rebounds and a steal during Wednesday's 104-98 win over the Magic in Summer League.\n\nPippen has turned some heads during his third Summer League stint and is certainly making a case to be the Grizzlies' backup point guard behind Ja Morant. Pippen and GG Jackson combined for 52 of Memphis' 104 points, while Pippen's nine assists led the team.\n\nEdey (ankle) didn't play in Wednesday's 104-98 win over the Magic but is expected to return before the end of Summer League, Drew Hill of The Daily Memphian reports.\n\nEdey sprained his ankle during Salt Lake City Summer League and hasn't suited up in a little over one week. The Grizzlies have indicated the injury is minor, and they're just being cautious with the ninth overall pick. Still, the expectation is that he'll be back before Summer League ends. Edey's next chance to play will be Thursday against New Orleans.\n\nEdey (ankle) won't play in Monday's Summer League game against the Mavericks, Drew Hill of The Daily Memphian reports.\n\nEdey will miss another contest while tending to an ankle issue, as there's no reason to rush him back into action for Summer League. His next chance to suit up will arrive Wednesday against the Magic.\n\nEdey won't play in Friday's Summer League contest against the Kings due to an ankle sprain, Michael Wallace of the Grizzlies' official site reports.\n\nThe big man missed Memphis' final game in the Salt Lake City Summer League and is now set to miss the opener in Las Vegas, but the injury is not expected to be a long-term concern. Edey is expected to return at some point during the Las Vegas circuit, with the Grizzlies' next game being Monday against the Mavericks.\n\nJackson hit 7-of-14 shots (3-7 3Pt) and made 1-of-2 free throws for 18 points, eight rebounds, two assists, three triples and three steals across 33 minutes during Wednesday's Summer League loss to the Thunder.\n\nWhile most of Jackson's stat line was great, his six turnovers were less than stellar. Jackson posted some solid stat lines last season while logging big minutes for a team that was missing most of its key guys, but it'll be tough for him to replicate that success in Year 2 if Jaren Jackson Jr. and Brandon Clarke are healthy.\n\nLaRavia has been ruled out for Wednesday's Summer League game against the Thunder due to minor ankle soreness, Michael Wallace of the Grizzlies' official site reports.\n\nLaRavia is entering his third NBA season, so it's a bit surprising that he's played in any Summer League games. His ankle is fine, but he'll likely be deployed sparsely during these summer exhibition contests.\n\nEdey will sit out Wednesday's Summer League contest due to minor ankle soreness, Michael Wallace of the Grizzlies' official site reports.\n\nThe Grizzlies are wrapping up their time at the Salt Lake Summer League with their third game in as many nights, so Memphis will take some precautions with their lottery pick. He should be back in action for Friday's Summer League game in Las Vegas, though.\n\nWells posted 27 points (9-23 FG, 3-7 3Pt, 6-7 FT), six rebounds, three assists and one steal across 34 minutes in Tuesday's win over the 76ers in the Salt Lake City Summer League.\n\nWells bounced back from a 1-for-9 performance in the club's Summer League opener Monday by scoring 27 points and hitting the game-winning buzzer-beater Tuesday. While the 20-year-old struggled from the field, he was efficient from beyond the arc and displayed his ability to rack up rebounds. Wells is on a two-way pact with the Grizzlies this upcoming season, and he spent one year at Washington State, during which he averaged 12.6 points, 4.6 rebounds and 1.2 assists while shooting 41.7 percent from three.\n\nMorant underwent shoulder surgery in January, but he is fully cleared for all basketball activities this summer, CBSSports.com reports.\n\nDue to a 25-game suspension and a major shoulder surgery, Morant appeared in just nine games last season, during which he averaged 25.1 points, 8.1 assists, 5.6 rebounds, 1.4 blocks and 1.4 steals across 35.3 minutes. The 24-year-old had successful surgery on his right shoulder in mid-January, and he is now officially cleared to resume all basketball activities ahead of training camp in the fall. Morant will aim to lead the Grizzlies back to the playoffs after a year ruined by a litany of injuries saw them finish with a 27-55 record."
