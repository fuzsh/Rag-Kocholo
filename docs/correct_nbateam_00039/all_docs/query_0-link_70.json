        "text": "STEPHEN A. Smith went on a rant back in 2008 after the Los Angeles Lakers traded former No. 1 overall pick Kwame Brown to the Memphis Grizzlies for Marc Gasol.\n\nAt the time, Smith blasted Brown and praised the Lakers, but in 2023, he seemed to have a different tune.\n\nWhat did Stephen A. Smith say about Kwame Brown?\n\nBrown was selected by the Washington Wizards as the first overall pick of the 2001 NBA Draft and went on to spend 12 seasons in the league before retiring in 2013.\n\nDuring that time, he had stints with the Lakers, Grizzlies, Detroit Pistons, Charlotte Bobcats, Golden State Warriors, and Philadelphia 76ers, but never lived up to the hype.\n\nOften regarded as one of the biggest busts of all time, Smith did not hold back in 2008 when the Lakers decided to trade him for Gasol, a three-time NBA All-Star.\n\n\"[The Lakers] gave up Kwame Brown, who cares,\" Smith said after his co-host asked him if the Lakers gave away too much in the trade.\n\n\"I could care less. First of all, understand something, when you're giving up a first-round pick, if you are a quality team in playoff contention, it really doesn't mean that much, that's number one.\n\n\"Number two, and more importantly, Kwame Brown is gone. The city of angels, Hollywood just should be celebrating. Throw a parade already.\n\n\"Whether you win a championship or not this man was a bonafide scrub. He can't play. No disrespect whatsoever but I'm sorry they can't tell everybody the truth. The man cannot play the game of basketball,\" Smith continued.\n\n\"He has small hands, he can't catch the ball, he's got bad feet, he can't really move... He has no game whatsoever, plays no defense, doesn't have the heart, the passion, or anything that comes with it and you're asking me if they gave up too much? Please the Los Angeles Lakers knew exactly what they were doing. They should be celebrating right now.\"\n\nWhile Smith might've seemed sure of his feelings back then, he revealed in an August 2023 podcast appearance that if he had the chance, he would've handled the situation better.\n\n\"I know what I said. I did mean it. I ain't gonna sit here and tell you I ain't mean that s*** I said but I didn't know it was gonna be like this,\" he said on Paul George's Podcast P.\n\n\"Remember I said it before Twitter, Facebook. I didn't know 15 years later they gonna have memes and videos and when I see what he says, I realize how hurt he is.\"\n\nAt this time, Brown has not addressed Smith's podcast comments.\n\nWhat is the Stephen A. Smith and Kwame Brown beef?\n\nNeedless to say, Smith and Brown were far from friends after his ESPN comments were made, but the feud did not stop there.\n\nIn May 2021, Brown took to Instagram Live to call out people he believe disrespected him, including Smith.\n\nIn an explicit rant, Brown invited Smith to “meet me in Seattle, where you can have mutual combat\" after calling out his \"bald forehead.\"\n\nBrown's clip instantly went viral, but it didn't seem to phase the sportscaster.\n\n\"The only negative thing anybody has ever said about Kwame Brown is that he couldn’t play a lick of basketball,\" Smith said during an episode of his ESPN+ show, Stephen A.’s World, via Sports Illustrated.\n\n\"Newsflash! That wasn’t a lie!”\n\nSmith then proceeded to play over a minute's worth of \"Brown bloopers\" while commentating on each error.\n\nWhere is Kwame Brown now?\n\nAfter Brown's controversial basketball career came to an end, he stepped out of the spotlight.\n\nNot much is known about his life now, but he can often be found masking posts on Instagram to almost 200,000 followers."
