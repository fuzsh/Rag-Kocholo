        "text": "WASHINGTON – Pau Gasol said he would not make his Lakers’ debut today against the Washington Wizards.\n\nA whirlwind day in which he traveled from Memphis to LosAngeles to Washington meant he couldn’t practice Saturday.\n\nOn the day after he was traded from the Memphis Grizzlies to the Lakers, Gasol traveled from Memphis to L.A. to undergo a physical exam by the Lakers’ team doctors.\n\nAfter meeting excited fans who recognized him and wished him well at LAX and also at a nearby fast-food restaurant, he boarded another airplane bound for Washington. He didn’t arrive at the team’s hotel until after 11:30 p.m. EST.\n\nGasol, who was sidelined for several games last week, hopes to play Tuesday night against the New Jersey Nets.\n\n“I was shocked when I got the news after practice, I think it was (Friday), right?” he said during a late-night meeting with beat reporters.\n\n“I’m surprised, but at the same time I’m thankful, grateful and I’m ready to put my best into this opportunity and this team. I’m happy to be a Laker.”\n\nGasol said it was difficult to leave Memphis because of the many friends he made there in seven seasons with the Grizzlies.\n\nProfessionally, it was a different story. The Grizzlies are not a contending team this season.\n\nMany have suggested the Lakers are now a legitimate contender for the NBA championship after dealing Kwame Brown and Javaris Crittenton to get Gasol.\n\n“It’s a huge improvement and a huge step for me.” Gasol said. “I had a taste of people’s reaction (Saturday) in L.A. We went to In-N-Out Burger next to the airport. People were really crazy. They were excited. They were pulling for me and for the team.\n\n“Expectations are really high, and that’s also really exciting.”\n\nGasol said he would be comfortable playing either center or power forward, although he’s likely to be slotted for the center position until Andrew Bynum returns from his left kneecap injury.\n\nBynum was hurt Jan. 13 against the Grizzlies.\n\nInstant contenders\n\nIt’s not just fans and media members speculating that the Lakers have become title contenders with the addition of Gasol.\n\nJose Calderon of the Toronto Raptors, Gasol’s teammate on the Spanish national team, also said that would be the case.\n\n“He’s going to a team that can win a championship,” Calderon said after the Lakers defeated the Raptors on Friday night in Toronto.\n\n“They’re one of the best teams in the West. … I’m happy for him. … I think it’s a really good trade.”\n\nTrade fallout\n\nKobe Bryant went on record Friday as saying he was pleased by Lakers’ acquisition of Gasol. He also said the trade was the sort of move that might keep him in purple and gold beyond his contract’s opt-out date after the 2008-09 season.\n\nAsked if he believed the deal pacified Bryant, Lakers coach Phil Jackson said, “I would assume it would, but that’s his bailiwick. He’s got to work through that.\n\n“When the time comes, if we have success, I’m sure he’ll want to be a part of it. If we continue to have injuries, he may think there’s a black cloud hanging over our heads.”"
