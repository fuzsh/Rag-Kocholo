This time around Morant flashed his gun on his friends Instagram live session.\n\nThis is now the second time that Ja Morant has encountered consequences from the NBA regarding his actions with a gun.\n\nPreviously, Morant was suspended for eight games due to showing a gun in a Colorado nightclub, during the regular season.\n\nThe first overall pick in the 2001 draft, Kwame Brown, hasn’t hesitated in holding back his thoughts on the 2019 second overall pick, Ja Morant, and his actions.\n\nIn nearly a five minute video, Brown, unleashes his thoughts on Morant….Brown begins the video stating that “so Ja Morant, you like to play with guns huh?”\n\nBrown referred the fact that this incident happened twice and claims that Morant could be in his house doing this off camera but instead he is out in the public eye and gave a “bullshit apology” then proceed to shortly after showing a gun on Instagram live.\n\nBrown also stated that he heard of NBA YoungBoy but Ja is NBA DumbBoy.\n\nThe whole video is posted below (*NSFW*) :\n\nWill Ja Morant be the next Gilbert Arenas? Or will Morant learn from his actions finally?\n\n-We Like Sportz Staff\n\n*Photo Courtesy of JayRossy*"
