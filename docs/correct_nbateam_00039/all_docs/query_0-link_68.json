Vote below and help decide the greatest Grizzlies big man of all time!\n\nMost divisive: Hasheem Thabeet\n\nOver 200 Ranker voters have come together to rank this list of The 35+ Best NBA Memphis Grizzlies Centers\n\nBirthplace : Barcelona, Spain\n\nNationality : Spanish\n\nTeam : Los Angeles Lakers\n\nPosition : Center\n\nMemphis Grizzlies: 2008–2019\n\nA cornerstone of the Memphis Grizzlies franchise, Marc Gasol joined the team in 2008 through a trade that sent his brother Pau to the Los Angeles Lakers. With a versatile skill set, exceptional passing ability, and elite defense, Marc became the defensive anchor for the renowned \"Grit and Grind\" Grizzlies era. A three-time NBA All-Star and 2013 Defensive Player of the Year, his talents were instrumental in leading the Grizzlies to multiple playoff appearances and a Western Conference Finals berth.\n\nBirthplace : Barcelona, Spain\n\nNationality : Spain\n\nTeam : Portland Trail Blazers, Los Angeles Lakers, Chicago Bulls, San Antonio Spurs\n\nPosition : Power forward, Center\n\nMemphis Grizzlies: 2001–2008\n\nThe elder Gasol brother, Pau was drafted by the Atlanta Hawks in 2001 but was soon traded to the Memphis Grizzlies on draft night, where he began his illustrious NBA career. As a versatile big man with deft scoring touch and remarkable court vision, Pau made an immediate impact as the franchise's first-ever All-Star selection in 2006. Over his seven seasons with the Grizzlies, he garnered Rookie of the Year honors and two All-Star selections, solidifying his place in the pantheon of Memphis Grizzlies greats.\n\nBirthplace : Rotorua, New Zealand\n\nNationality : New Zealand\n\nTeam : Memphis Grizzlies\n\nPosition : Center\n\nMemphis Grizzlies: 2021-2022\n\nArriving in Memphis via a trade in 2021, Steven Adams has quickly asserted himself as a vital presence in the Grizzlies' frontcourt. Known for his tenacious rebounding, imposing physicality, and gritty pick-setting, Adams is the quintessential blue-collar player. While he may not possess eye-popping statistics or awards, his contributions to team success and on-court leadership make him an invaluable asset to the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nBirthplace : Utena, Lithuania\n\nNationality : Lithuanian\n\nTeam : New Orleans Pelicans\n\nPosition : Center\n\nMemphis Grizzlies: 2018–2021\n\nAcquired in a trade from the Toronto Raptors during the 2019 season, Jonas Valančiūnas made an immediate impact on the Grizzlies' roster with his bruising low-post play and impressive rebounding prowess. Featuring a soft shooting touch from mid-range and an innate ability to create second-chance opportunities, Valančiūnas was a nightly double-double threat during his tenure in Memphis. Although his time with the Grizzlies was relatively brief, he left an indelible mark on the franchise's ascent back to NBA relevance.\n\nBirthplace : New York City, USA, New York\n\nTeam : Chicago Bulls, New York Knicks, Memphis Grizzlies, Los Angeles Clippers\n\nPosition : Center\n\nMemphis Grizzlies: 2018–2019\n\nThough his stint with the Grizzlies was brief, Joakim Noah brought his trademark energy and defensive intensity to Memphis when he signed as a free agent in December 2018. An excellent rebounder and playmaker for his size, Noah's veteran presence bolstered the Grizzlies' frontcourt rotation. While he did not achieve significant accolades during his time in Memphis, Noah's relentless hustle and passion resonated with the Grizzlies' faithful.\n\nBirthplace : Fort Smith, Arkansas\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : Vancouver Grizzlies\n\nPosition : Center\n\nMemphis Grizzlies: 1995–2001\n\nSelected as the inaugural draft pick for the Vancouver Grizzlies in 1995, Bryant \"Big Country\" Reeves served as the face of the franchise during its early years. A talented scorer with an array of low-post moves and a soft touch around the rim, Reeves provided a consistent offensive presence inside. While his career was hampered and eventually cut short by injuries, his importance to the nascent Grizzlies organization remains undeniable."
