        "text": "Over the past 19 seasons since relocating from Vancouver, the Grizzlies have become part of the Memphis fabric.\n\nThey turned FedExForum into the Grindhouse. They went from expansion team laughingstock to a respectable franchise where players become beloved and respected.\n\nSo which Grizzlies are the best to wear each number? The only rule is these are only players from the Memphis era, not Vancouver. And what they did in Memphis is what counts, not overall career achievements: Sorry Allen Iverson and Gilbert Arenas.\n\n00\n\nDarrell Arthur (2008-13)\n\nArthur only averaged 6.7 points but he didn't need the ball to be effective. He was a tough defender off the bench who could guard multiple positions and do a little bit of everything. He played a small but key role in helping establish the Grit and Grind era.\n\nBest of the rest: JaMychal Green, Avery Bradley\n\n1\n\nKyle Lowry (2006-09)\n\nLowry wasn't the All-Star in Memphis he became in Toronto but was mildly productive with the Grizzlies to begin his career. After a broken wrist ended his rookie year after 10 games, he had a solid second season before being traded to Houston during the 2008-09 season. He averaged 8.6 points while in Memphis and split time with Mike Conley his final two seasons.\n\nBest of the rest: Lance Stephenson, Wesley Person, Kyle Anderson\n\n2\n\nJason Williams (2001-05)\n\nWilliams arrived in Memphis when the Grizzlies did, and his career found a reboot under Hubie Brown. Twice he averaged more than eight assists and, most importantly, he helped the Grizzlies reach the playoffs for the first time in 2003-04. His time in Memphis might not be as remembered as much as his three years in Sacramento, but Williams became a more refined player here before winning an NBA championship with the Miami Heat. He wore No. 3 in 2010-11.\n\nBest of the rest: Juan Carlos Navarro, Delon Wright\n\n3\n\nChucky Atkins (2006-07)\n\nAtkins switched from No. 32 to No. 3 in his second year in Memphis and improved his numbers as a high-scoring reserve. He averaged 13.2 points and 4.6 assists in 75 games with 23 starts. It ended up being his last NBA season scoring in double figures.\n\nBest of the rest: James Johnson, Allen Iverson, Wayne Ellington\n\n4\n\nStromile Swift (2001-05, 2006-08)\n\nSwift's high-flying dunks made him a fan favorite during his first stint in Memphis. In those first five seasons, he twice averaged double figures in scoring. He may not have lived up to the hype of being the No. 2 overall pick, but he ranks among the most athletic players in franchise history.\n\nBest of the rest: Sam Young, Jordan Farmar\n\n5\n\nCourtney Lee (2013-16)\n\nLee is the Grizzlies' all-time leader in free throw percentage (.862). He averaged 10.3 points in three seasons but raised his game in the 2015 playoffs, when he averaged 17.2 points in the Grizzlies' first-round win over the Trail Blazers.\n\nBest of the rest: Marreese Speights, Andrew Harrison\n\n6\n\nMario Chalmers (2015-16, 2017-18)\n\nChalmers still triggers bad memories in Memphis for his game-tying 3-pointer for Kansas against the Tigers in the 2008 national championship game. But he earned respect as a Grizzlies player by showing up big in the clutch, including a game-winner to defeat the Pistons. He averaged 9.1 points in two seasons.\n\nBest of the rest: Bonzi Wells, Shelvin Mack, Eddie Jones\n\n7\n\nJerryd Bayless (2012-14)\n\nBayless gets the nod here for his tenure (111 games) and for how he upped his scoring in the postseason. He averaged 8.5 points over two seasons, but in the 2013 playoffs averaged 9.3 points as the Grizzlies reached the Western Conference Finals.\n\nBest of the rest: Tarence Kinsey, Justin Holiday, Wayne Selden\n\n8\n\nJames Ennis III (2015-18)\n\nAfter being waived by the Grizzlies in March 2016, he signed a multi-year deal with the team four months later. Over three seasons, Ennis averaged 6.3 points and 3.6 rebounds in 119 games.\n\nBest of the rest: MarShon Brooks, Bryce Cotton, Quincy Pondexter\n\n9\n\nTony Allen (2010-17)\n\nFour words describe Allen's impact: First. Team. All. Defense. That's Allen's famous rallying cry against the Warriors in the 2015 playoffs. He brought a championship work ethic to Memphis and made six All-Defensive teams during the Grit and Grind Era. He may have won a ring in Boston but as part of the Core Four, he became a Memphis legend.\n\nBest of the rest: Ronnie Brewer, Isaac Austin\n\n10\n\nGordan Giricek (2002-03)\n\nGiricek appeared in 49 games during his rookie season before being traded to the Magic. While in Memphis, he played in the NBA Rookie Challenge and is still listed among the Grizzlies' All-Rookie team selections.\n\nBest of the rest: Troy Williams, Ivan Rabb, Jarell Martin\n\n11\n\nMike Conley (2007-19)\n\nConley's status as beloved Grizzlies point guard and community ambassador made him a Memphis legend. It's fitting he's the only Memphis player to wear No. 11 as the franchise's leader in points, assists and steals. Conley's Mask Game against the Warriors in the 2015 playoffs won't be forgotten.\n\n12\n\nJa Morant (2019-20)\n\nMorant's rookie season is already one of the best in team history. From his dunks, passes and \"Ja-ggles\" celebration to his short stint at \"Headband 12,\" he's become a spark since the day he arrived. The sky is the limit for what Morant can do, but for now, he's off to a great start as one of the most dynamic young players in the NBA.\n\nBest of the rest: Tyreke Evans, Nick Calathes\n\n13\n\nJaren Jackson Jr. (2018-20)\n\nJackson's gifts as a 3-point shooter and rim protector make him a rare player in Grizzlies lore. His 43-point game earlier this season made him the youngest NBA player since 2009 to have a 40-point game. Like Morant, he's quickly made a mark helping lead the franchise's next generation while being one of the most engaging Grizzlies in the community.\n\nBest of the rest: Xavier Henry, Mike Miller\n\n14\n\nXavier Munford (2015-16)\n\nThis hasn't been a number for long-term Grizzlies. Five have worn it in Memphis and only Munford appeared in more than 10 games. Munford's 14-game stint came on two 10-day contracts in 2016, when he averaged 5.7 points in 17.4 minutes per game.\n\nBest of the rest: Lester Hudson, Omari Johnson, Brice Johnson\n\n15\n\nVince Carter (2014-17)\n\nCarter wasn't the All-Star in Memphis that he was with the Raptors and Nets, but at times he was a productive veteran in three seasons and earned respect as a teammate and professional. It explains why in his final NBA game in Memphis this season, he received two standing ovations from the FedExForum crowd.\n\nBest of the rest: Hamed Haddadi, Cezary Trybanski\n\n16\n\nPau Gasol (2001-08)\n\nThe first Grizzlies player to win an individual NBA award. The first to win Rookie of the Year and be an All-Star. Gasol was one of the first Grizzlies stars in Memphis as he led the team to the playoffs for the first time. While the Core Four will be remembered for the Grit and Grind era, Gasol is just as important to the Grizzlies franchise as anybody.\n\nBest of the rest: Toney Douglas\n\n17\n\nJonas Valanciunas (2018-20)\n\nValanciunas arrived last February in the Marc Gasol trade and in 19 games he averaged a double-double last season. But the big man took an even bigger leap this season. On a fast-paced Grizzlies team, he found his place as the low-post anchor and a double-double machine.\n\nBest of the rest: Garret Temple\n\n18\n\nOmri Casspi (2018-19)\n\nCasspi was one of two to wear No. 18 in Memphis, so he's the best by default. He played 36 games and averaged 6.3 points before suffering a torn meniscus and being waived by the team.\n\nBest of the rest: Josh Davis\n\n19\n\nBeno Udrih (2014-16)\n\nUdrih played most of his 97 games during the 2014-15 season when he appeared in 79 games with 12 starts. His best moments came in the 2015 playoffs when he averaged 11.8 points in the first-round series win over the Trail Blazers.\n\nBest of the rest: PJ Hairston\n\n20\n\nDamon Stoudamire (2006-08)\n\nStoudamire's Memphis ties run deeper than just his time as an assistant with the Grizzlies and Tigers. Near the end of his career, he was a bridge from Jason Williams to Mike Conley as the Grizzlies' point guard. In 118 games, he had 107 starts and averaged 8.4 points and 4.6 assists.\n\nBest of the rest: Quincy Pondexter\n\n21\n\nTayshaun Prince (2012-15)\n\nHakim Warrick played in more games and averaged more points. But the edge goes to Prince because he contributed to the Grit and Grind era's best playoff success. After being traded to the Grizzlies during the 2012-13 season, he helped them reach the Western Conference Finals. He brought a winning, defensive-minded reputation from Detroit and it paid off with a team creating a similar attitude.\n\nBest of the rest: Hakim Warrick, Greivis Vasquez\n\n22\n\nRudy Gay (2006-13)\n\nRudy Gay got buckets during his time in Memphis. He has the third-highest scoring average in franchise history (17.9 ppg) and ranks fourth in games played (479). Gay's highlights include finishing third in Rookie of the Year voting and a buzzer-beater over LeBron James in 2010.\n\nBest of the rest: Brevin Knight, Matt Barnes\n\n23\n\nBen McLemore (2017-18)\n\nMcLemore's lone year in Memphis saw him average 7.5 points in 56 games. Unfortunately, his year was such a disappointment that he was traded that summer to Sacramento, where he began his career.\n\nBest of the rest: Casey Jacobsen, Deyonta Davis\n\n24\n\nDillon Brooks (2017-20)\n\nBrooks is one of only two players to wear No. 24 in Memphis. He became a fan favorite in his third season. His fearless shooting touch and his attitude are matched by his improvement as a defender. With a three-year, $35 million contract signed in February, Brooks has entrenched himself as part as the Grizzlies' young core.\n\nBest of the rest: Bobby Jackson\n\n25\n\nEarl Watson (2002-05)\n\nChandler Parsons might be the infamous No. 25 to Grizzlies fans due to bad injury luck, but on the court Watson was the best to wear it. While backing up Jason Williams, he averaged 4.1 assists over three seasons. It set a tone for Watson being a reliable, steady guard for the rest of his carer.\n\nBest of the rest: Elliot Williams, John Thomas\n\n26\n\nLester Hudson (2009-10)\n\nHudson is the only player to wear the number in Memphis and did so for nine games, averaging four points. He wore No. 14 for three games in 2011-12.\n\n27\n\nKalin Lucas (2014-15)\n\nLucas played two games in his NBA career and one was in Memphis. He only played six minutes and missed his lone field goal attempt, but he remains the only person to wear No. 27 in Memphis history.\n\n30\n\nTroy Daniels (2016-17)\n\nDaniels could score quickly and often off the bench. He still shares the team record for most points in a quarter with 22 against the Thunder. He also had a 31-point game against the Lakers. He had seven games with 20 or more points as a reserve but in his three starts, he scored in single digits.\n\nBest of the rest: Dahntay Jones, Adonal Foyle, Jon Leuer\n\n31\n\nShane Battier (2001-06, 2010-11)\n\nBattier started the team's first game in Memphis on his way to an All-Rookie first-team season. He also played a key role on the Grizzlies' first playoff teams, which set him up to become an NBA champion in Miami. There's an argument that Battier is perhaps the most underrated great player in Memphis Grizzles history as he's still top five in blocks and steals.\n\nBest of the rest: Darko Milicic\n\n32\n\nOJ Mayo (2008-12)\n\nMayo finished second in Rookie of the Year voting to Derrick Rose and was a high-scoring threat the minute he came to Memphis. He averaged 18.5 and 17.5 points per game in his first two seasons before he fell out of the starting lineup in his third year. His career didn't match his hot start, but Mayo's Grizzlies tenure was among the highlights of his NBA career.\n\nBest of the rest: Jeff Green, Chucky Atkins\n\n33\n\nMarc Gasol (2008-19)\n\nMemphis watched Gasol grow up from his teen years and he paid it back in his 11 seasons. He's part of the Core Four that led the Grizzlies to their first series win and a trip to the Western Conference Finals. A Defensive Player of the Year and three-time All-Star, Gasol's impact goes beyond awards as he became one of the most memorable players in franchise history.\n\nBest of the rest: Mike Miller\n\n34\n\nBrandan Wright (2015-18)\n\nIn three seasons in Memphis, Wright appeared in 67 games and averaged 6.1 points and 3.2 rebounds mostly coming off the bench. His first year was cut short due to a season-ending injury. Wright fared better than perhaps the most famous No. 34 in team history — Hasheem Thabeet, who flopped after being the No. 2 pick.\n\nBest of the rest: Jason Collins, Scott Padgett\n\n35\n\nBrian Cardinal (2004-08)\n\nCardinal remains second all-time in franchise history in free throw percentage (.847). In 2004-05, he led the Grizzlies in free throw percentage (.873) and steals per game. Cardinal played 159 games and averaged 5.6 points.\n\nBest of the rest: Alex Stepheson\n\n40\n\nRyan Humphrey (2002-05)\n\nHumphrey is the only player to wear No. 40 in Memphis and did so in 50 games, all off the bench. He played 35 games in 2004-05 and averaged 2.9 points.\n\n41\n\nJames Posey (2003-05)\n\nBefore Posey became a two-time NBA champion, he had two productive seasons in Memphis. He started every game in 2003-04 and averaged 13.7 points while leading the team in steals and free throw percentage (.830)\n\nBest of the rest: Kosta Koufos\n\n42\n\nLorenzen Wright (2001-06)\n\nWright returned home to Memphis for five seasons and didn't disappoint. He led the team in rebounding average twice and still holds the franchise record with 26 rebounds in a game. It's rare when you can play high school, college and pro basketball in the same city, so it's fitting Wright is the only player to wear 42 in franchise history.\n\n43\n\nGrant Long (2001-02)\n\nLong joined the Grizzlies in 1999 but only played in Memphis one year. As the only person to wear 43 in franchise history, he started 56 of 66 games and averaged 6.3 points before playing one more season in the NBA.\n\n44\n\nDante Cunningham (2011-12)\n\nCunningham played 64 games and averaged 5.2 points in his only season in Memphis.\n\nBest of the rest: Andre Brown, Lawrence Roberts\n\n45\n\nBo Outlaw (2003-04)\n\nOutlaw appeared in all 82 games with one start in his lone year in Memphis. That start was the 352nd and final one of his 15-year career.\n\nBest of the rest: Steven Hunter, Dexter Pittman\n\n50\n\nZach Randolph (2009-17)\n\nThere's only one Z-Bo, and Memphis loved him as much as any sports figure this century. He embodied the Grit and Grind era with his low-post play and became a two-time All-Star. He's the only player to wear No. 50 in Memphis team history and likely the last assuming his number eventually gets retired.\n\n54\n\nKwame Brown (2007-08)\n\nBrown's Grizzlies tenure was unremarkable in 15 games, but he's the only player in Memphis who wore the number. The best thing about Brown is that he's a footnote in the trade that sent Pau Gasol to the Lakers and brought Marc Gasol to the Grizzlies.\n\n55\n\nJoakim Noah (2018-19)\n\nNoah's lone year in Memphis was fun as the veteran reinvigorated his career. He provided a spark off the bench and his work ethic endeared himself to Grizzlies fans. For 42 games, it was a perfect match.\n\nBest of the rest: Marko Jaric, Keyon Dooling\n\nWant to stay informed on the latest Memphis Grizzlies news?
