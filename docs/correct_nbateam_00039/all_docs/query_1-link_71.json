        "text": "TORONTO — Kobe Bryant need wait no longer for the Lakers’ bold move for championship immediacy.\n\nPower forward Pau Gasol, a 2006 All-Star, arrived in trade Friday from the Memphis Grizzlies with a second-round pick for Kwame Brown, Javaris Crittenton and two future first-round draft picks. It is a deal that catapults the Lakers into championship contention both now and later.\n\nAnd it moved Bryant to offer his strongest affirmation about perhaps again staying a Laker for life.\n\n“It shows a level of commitment that I questioned over the summer,” said Bryant, whose 46 points led the short-handed Lakers to a 121-101 victory Friday over the Toronto Raptors. “I have to take my hat off to (Jerry) Buss and Mitch (Kupchak) for going forward with this. Now it’s on us.”\n\nThe 7-foot Gasol, 27, has averaged 19 points and 9 rebounds amid rampant trade speculation once Memphis concluded he could not anchor its rebuilding team. The Lakers expect by sometime in March — they insist Andrew Bynum’s knee injury should not cost him the rest of this season — to plug Gasol into a skyscraping, skilled frontcourt with Bynum and Lamar Odom. That would give them three top-shelf interior players — all 6-foot-10 or taller — to go with Bryant.\n\n“It’s amazing to be on a team full of history as the Lakers,” Gasol said on his Web site. “But not only because of their past, mainly because of the present: playing along with Kobe Bryant is a privilege, which is not easy for most of the players in this league. And there will be lots of opportunities to be in the playoffs and do great things in this league, as I always wished … winning and fighting.”\n\nIf Gasol, tournament MVP when Spain won the 2006 FIBA World Championship, helps the Lakers make a renewed push in the Western Conference, Buss and Kupchak might have just helped Bryant secure his first NBA MVP trophy, too.\n\n“Now it’s just time to put the work in,” Bryant said, “and work on the chemistry.”\n\nSaid Toronto All-Star Chris Bosh of the refashioned Lakers: “They will be tough to match.”\n\nLakers coach Phil Jackson welcomed Gasol by leaving a playful voice message with some spotty spoken Spanish. But Jackson already issued a few public caveats about the success of the deal hinging on Gasol firming up his fundamental defense.\n\nThe Lakers lose some defense but little else in the mistake- and injury-prone Brown, whose expiring $9.1 million contract provides salary-cap relief to Memphis. The 13-33 Grizzlies, who saw Jerry West retire after last season and replaced him with Chris Wallace, wanted out from under the remaining $63.1 million over four years of Gasol’s contract (counting this season). Crittenton, the Lakers’ 2007 No. 1 pick, has huge upside but no spot in Jackson’s rotation — and the Lakers already have a point guard of the future in Jordan Farmar.\n\nThe Lakers also gave up cash and protected first-round picks in 2008 and ’10 but get back Memphis’ 2010 second-rounder. They included Aaron McKie, who re-signed to help the salaries match, and the draft rights to 2007 second-round pick Marc Gasol, Pau’s younger brother.\n\nJackson said there was discussion about Pau Gasol for about a year — meaning former Lakers executive West was at least aware of such a scenario before leaving Memphis — with trade talks intensifying in recent weeks. And now the Lakers have three of the NBA’s 27 highest-salaried players in Bryant ($19.5 million, ninth), Gasol ($13.7 million, 25th) and Odom ($13.3 million, 27th) — with Bynum set to ascend with a big-time salary in 2009-10 once he gets his hefty extension this summer.\n\nIn sharp contrast to the rejected-by-Minnesota offseason proposal of Bynum and Odom for Kevin Garnett, the Lakers didn’t have to yield any core pieces. Even if Odom doesn’t have the ideal quickness to defend opposing small forwards, the Lakers still have Luke Walton and Trevor Ariza or Bryant to pick up that burden. The depth is evident in Farmar and Sasha Vujacic remaining potent backup guards for Derek Fisher and Bryant, and Ronny Turiaf, Vladimir Radmanovic and Chris Mihm offering other options inside.\n\n“We can do multiple things with this team,” Jackson said.\n\nAlthough the Lakers could have chased available New Jersey point guard Jason Kidd, he turns 35 next month and doesn’t play as great of a need position. Jackson said after he agreed to his contract extension in December that the missing piece was an inside force. Gasol isn’t necessarily the most physical big man, but he is a big man who can be physical — and fill in for Bynum now.\n\nThere is an outside chance that all three active players in the trade pass physicals in time for Gasol to play Sunday in Washington. Gasol has missed time lately with a sore back, but that shouldn’t be a major problem.\n\nThe 2002 NBA Rookie of the Year, Gasol has a gentle, ambidextrous touch around the basket and a mid-range jumper ideal for the power-forward slot in the triangle offense. He is adept as a shot blocker, having averaged 1.8 blocks per game for his NBA career — which includes an 0-12 postseason record. Gasol is not considered a clutch player and will be willing to defer to Bryant.\n\n“He’s extremely talented,” Bryant said.\n\nThe move goes a long way toward ending talk of Bryant wanting to be traded. Even though some of his issues with individuals in the organization remain, Bryant’s desire to win more championships stands at the fore. Asked if the trade helps ensure Bryant won’t opt out of his contract after next season, he said: “It doesn’t hurt, absolutely not.”"
