        "text": "Kwame Brown children are Kwame Jr Brown, Lauren Brown and Kwameeri Brown. Kwame has kids from two different relationships.\n\nHe has three daughters with his ex-girlfriend, Jocelyn Vaughn. Following his divorce from her, Brown tied the knot with another woman named Marcia Brown.\n\nFurther, he has two kids with Marcia, a boy named Kwame Jr. and a girl named Lauren.\n\nBrown is a former basketball player from Charleston, South Carolina. After completing high school in Glynn Academy, Georgia, the Washington Wizards picked him in the 2001 NBA Draft.\n\nLater he joined the Los Angeles Lakers in 2005, followed by Memphis Grizzlies in 2008, and ended his career with the Philadelphia 76ers in 2013.\n\nAdditionally, the 40-year-old athlete runs a Youtube Channel, \"Kwame Brown Bust Life,\" with a significant following of 388K subscribers.\n\nKwame Brown Kids\n\nBrown has altogether five kids from two partners. His relationship with Jayeln gave birth to three daughters while he has a son and a daughter with Maria.\n\nKwame Jr. Brown\n\nIn July 2021, the former NBA standout went on Instagram a posted a picture with his young man Kwame II. Brown penned a wish on Jr's 17th birthday and also expressed he is glad to be his dad.\n\nLauren Brown\n\nIn February 2021, Brown shared a video capturing his baby girl Lauren Brown as they hung out for a nice meal in a local restaurant. Lauren was excited to go out with her dad after a very long time, and she was tapping both hands on the diner.\n\nSimilarly, in June 2020, Kwame uploaded a picture with Lauren as they walked in a park. She boasts a massive smile as Maria takes a picture of the two. Lauren was carrying a cute little pink backpack.\n\nKwameeri Brown\n\nOn the other hand, Kwame is having difficulty getting full custody of his three little princesses from Jayeln.\n\nDespite the legal battle, he remained committed to his family from a distance. He did what he could support Joselyn and their daughters, including Kwameeri, even though he was not physically present.\n\nEventually, the retired Los Angeles Lakers center decided to fight for custody of the children in 2019, hoping to have a more active role in their lives.\n\nKwame and Joselyn remain focused on what is best for their children through all the challenges and legal battles. Keeping their differences aside, they share a deep love for their girls and will continue to do everything possible to ensure their well-being.\n\nKwame Brown Wife\n\nKwame Brown married his wife Marcia Brown in June 1989. Marcia is an elementary school teacher from the United States.\n\nThe two have been together since they exchanged vows in the late 80s. She prefers a low-key life and has made rare public appearances with the former NBA star.\n\nMoreover, to respect her privacy, Kwame has not shared any of Marcia's pictures on his social media. Simply put, his social media platforms lack familial touches or personal nuances.\n\nApart from a few pictures of his son and daughter, his Instagram feed is all about him and NBA.\n\nOn the other hand, Brown was romantically involved with his former partner, Joselyn Vaughn. As stated on his Wikipedia page, Joselyn relocated to his Virginia residence in 2002.\n\nBrown and Joselyn have a long dating history, having started their relationship while attending Glynn Academy in Brunswick, Georgia, as a high school couple.\n\nTheir union gave birth to three kids, all daughters. However, Joselyn faced the daunting task of raising three kids alone after the breakup.\n\nShe turned to Kwame for help, but unfortunately, he could not support her. As a result, Joselyn decided to take legal action and filed a case against him for child support.\n\nKwame Brown Family Life\n\nKwame Brown grew up in a colossal family with ten members. His parents Joyce and Willis James Brown raised eight offspring in Charleston.\n\nA wealthy political heritage, including a close affiliation with Martin Luther King Jr, characterizes Kwame's lineage. His father, Willis James, played a considerable part during the civil rights movements led by King in the 50s and 60s.\n\nWhen Kwame turned seven, Joyce and Willis had a divorce, and her mother took custody of raising all eight of their kids. In comparison, his dad escaped parental responsibility and had another girlfriend shortly after the split.\n\nOne year later, in 1990, Willis was put behind bars for the heinous crime of taking his girlfriend's life.\n\nJoyce brought him up with great care and attention even though she was not his birth mother. After Kwame rose to stardom and money followed, he bought a beautiful home for Joyce in Washington.\n\nHowever, after living there for a few years, she preferred to live in serene settings because she never liked the hustle and bustle of modern metropolises. Joyce then moved back to her old place.\n\nDespite being apart, Kwame and Joyce maintained a constant connection through regular phone calls, speaking to each other daily.\n\nUnfortunately, Joyce passed away in August 2009 at the age of 61. She suffered from several illnesses before her demise.\n\nncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2Ftb%2FLrqOuZpOkunC31pqknmWSp7y4uoycn6KklKeyrw%3D%3D"
