        "text": "More Rumors in this Storyline\n\nThe vehicle’s driver, Ivy Mcgeil Cash, 48, was arrested for driving without a license, the report said. As Brown was being arrested, Cash allegedly “started yelling that the bag belonged to him,” the report said. Brown then also said the marijuana products belonged to Cash, the report said. The 7-foot-tall Brown could not be transported to the county jail in a standard patrol vehicle, “and we had to wait for a larger one to transport,” the report said.\n\n76ers re-sign Jeff Dowtin to a two-way contract\n\nShams Charania: The Philadelphia 76ers are signing guard Jeff Dowtin Jr. on a two-way NBA contract, sources tell @TheAthletic @Stadium. Dowtin averaged 17.1 points and 5.7 assists across NBA Summer League for 76ers this season after playing 12 games for Philadelphia in 2023-24."
