On this Bob Corritore interview: Years and years of honing his craft and serving the blues, releasing his first solo LP at age 46, the incredible relationships he forged with blues legends like Louisiana Red, John Primer, Jimmy Rogers, Koko Taylor and others… Being willing to try new things (production, club ownership, band leader) and how this created new music and business opportunities, quitting drinking at age 24, his Top 3 music experiences, moving in a more positive direction, the best decision he’s ever made, why he’s no longer looking to prove himself, why “He’s the best me he can be,” and loads more cool stuff.

Bob Corritore is one of the most active and highly regarded blues harmonica players on the scene today. He developed his style from listening to many of the original pioneers of Chicago Blues. Between his own releases and as a sideman for other artists, Bob has performed on over 100 LPs. Bob’s worked with loads of guests we’ve had here on Everyone Loves Guitar including Bob Margolin, Dave Mason, Kid Ramos, Sugaray, and others. Many of the albums Bob has play on were nominated for or winners of various Handy, Grammy, Living Blues, Blues Music Awards and Blues Blast Music Awards. Bob is a non-singing blues harmonica player and the things he’s accomplished are a testament to his sense of hustle and his work ethic.
