De cela et de tant et plus, je vous suis infiniment reconnaissante\n\nEn 1991, La France reconnaissant en vous une figure essentielle de la culture vous faisait Officier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Aujourd’hui, nous, gens de cinéma, des arts, des lettres, de la culture de France et d’ailleurs sommes consternés à l’annonce de votre licenciement quand les cinéastes et le public ont plus que jamais besoin de votre enthousiasme sans pareil, de votre irremplaçable expertise.\n\nJe ne saurais me résoudre a accepter votre licenciement et je tiens à vous assurer ici de mon plus sincère soutien et vous témoigner ma plus entière reconnaissance pour votre dévouement exemplaire.\n\nMa gratitude comme mon amitié vous sont acquises\n\nEva Truffaut\n\nParis le 30 octobre 2014\n\nCher monsieur Kleiman,\n\nJ’apprends avec étonnement et indignation que vos fonctions ont été suspendues et je tiens à vous faire part de mon soutien le plus total et de ma solidarité absolue.\n\nOn connaît votre travail, votre dévouement, votre talent sans faille au service du cinéma. Il est consternant et même impensable que, de même que pour Henri Langlois, le fil royal du destin d’une vie soit ainsi coupé net par des envieux ou des incapables. Lève-toi, François Truffaut, qui t’était levé à l’époque pour protester et faire rétablir Langlois avec fougue, levez-vous nombreux tous les petits François Truffaut de la terre et soyez prêts à vous battre pour que le cher Kleiman retrouve sans délai ses fonctions pleines et entières. Ceux qui idiotement et anticinematographiquement veulent le bâillonner ignorent que dans bâillonner il y a baïonnette: elle est déjà au bout de ma plume en attendant mieux ou pire.\n\nJe vous conjure de tenir bon.\n\nAvec mon admiration fidèle et mon amitié,\n\nGilles Jacob\n\nPresident, Cannes Film Festival\n\nDear Naum,\n\nI’ve heard what’s happening in Moscow and I’m simply stunned.\n\nIf one was ever to pick an ideal archive director that would be you; if one was ever to chose, in the world, a true place for the soul and for those who love and care about cinema, its past and future, that would be the Film Museum in Moscow.\n\nBy its own DNA cinema is an art form that goes beyond the very idea of nationality. What you did for the preservation, the dissemination and research of cinema was extremely important for a whole international community of cinema lovers. What you did was not only crucial for a better and deeper understanding of Russian culture, but also allowed us to have a better grasp of world cinema history, and of the human beings who made it.\n\nThe threat of your eviction from the Film Museum is a threat to all institutions working to safeguard the memory of cinema.\n\nThis is why we are going to share this e-mail to all the artists, archivists, scholars and followers of Il Cinema Ritrovato, so that each of them can send his/her support to the BFI address and do anything possible so that the experience and activity of the Moscow Film Museum can carry on.\n\nWith most grateful regards,\n\nGian Luca Farinelli\n\nDirector Cineteca di Bologna\n\nGentili operatori del cinema e appassionati,\n\nl’Associazione Culturale Tonino Guerra, che è composta anche da due musei dedicati all’opera del Maestro Tonino Guerra, certamente con grande amarezza ha reagito alle notizie arrivate fin qui.\n\nConosciamo personalmente Naum Klejman, legato da amicizia a Tonino Guerra, è un grande uomo, specialista del cinema in tutto il mondo. Un uomo come lui è riuscito a creare un museo unico al mondo con pochi mezzi a disposizione dando vita al centro luminoso della memoria per il cinema e anche per il suo futuro.\n\nNessuno è profeta nella propria patria, però a noi pare che l’unione con il Museo d’arti figurative Pushkin darà nuova forza al Museo che avrà finalmente il suo reparto del cinema come il Louvre e il Musée d’Orsay ecc., anche lo staff con il suo glorioso presidente Naum Klejman finalmente potrà lavorare indisturbato per conservare la storia del cinema perché il nostro Maestro Tonino Guerra diceva: “Senza passato non potrebbe essere il futuro”.\n\nIl Presidente Carlo Sancisi\n\nIl Vicepresidente Eleonora Guerra\n\nLuigi Mattei Gentili\n\nMartina Lorenzi, Maddalena Mattei Gentili, Valentina Galli\n\nDear Naoum Kleiman,\n\nAs director of the Cinémathèque suisse – National film archive, I am very sad of the decisions taken by the authority and send you all our support.\n\nThrough our former founder and director, Freddy Buache, we know how important is your work for national and international cinema.\n\nWe hope that it will be possible for you and all your team to come back and continue your effort to defend independent and free cinema.\n\nLet us know if we can do something to help you.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nFrédéric Maire\n\nDirector, Cinémathèque suisse — National Film Archive\n\nLe Festival International du Film de La Rochelle soutient Naoum Kleiman et son équipe.\n\nIls font preuve d’un amour fidèle, désintéressé et généreux pour le cinéma russe et international.\n\nLeur travail est précieux, nécessaire et admirable.\n\nLe musée national du cinéma de Moscou est un exemple pour les cinémathèques du monde entier et pour tous ceux qui oeuvrent, au quotidien, à la conservation des archives du patrimoine cinématographique, à la diffusion obstinée des films, à la circulation de trésors inestimables, afin que ceux-ci soient accessibles au plaisir et à la réflexion de chacun.\n\nIl est indispensable de protéger cet outil merveilleux -qui est une chance inouîe pour le cinéma russe- en lui restituant des conditions de fonctionnement pérennes et bienveillantes.\n\nMerci de prendre en compte les appels venus du monde entier pour que se perpétue, à sa manière à lui car elle a fait ses preuves, l’oeuvre de Naoum Kleiman.\n\nElle importe à tous ceux, innombrables, pour qui le cinéma est un message vital transmis de générations en générations et ceci depuis plus d’un siècle grâce aux passeurs tels que Naoum Kleiman.\n\nPrune Engler et toute l’équipe du Festival\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nWe write you as the board of directors of Apordoc – the Portuguese Documentary Association, with more than 200 members, responsible for events such as DocLisboa film festival, Doc’s Kingdom Seminar, Lisbon Docs pitching forum, among many other things.\n\nWe would like Apordoc, as an institution, to feature among the signatories of the letter of support of the Moscow Cinema Museum.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nInês Sapeta Dias, president\n\nAmarante Abramocivi, vice-president\n\nPedro Fernandes Duarte, treasurer\n\nMiguel Clara Vasconcelos\n\nMargarida Leitão\n\nNaum Kleiman and the Moscow Filmmuseum are as important to film history as Russian Cinema is important to the history of cinema.\n\nTo endanger the long tradition, the unparalleled competence, the unquenchable passion, the wonderful collections and the endless expertise of the Filmmuseum and of its staff, first of all Naum Kleiman — the first and most important scholar of Russian cinema — is an unjustified insult to all of Russian film history. The Filmmuseum has been, is and must continue being, the reference for the study of Russian cinema.\n\nNaum Kleiman and his staff are invaluable colleagues with whom the whole community of film archives and film archivists across the globe collaborate on a daily basis. They are an example for all of us who had the privilege to come to know them and work with them.\n\nOn behalf of the whole community of European Archives as President of their Association, it is with disbelief, despair, deep concern and anger that I hear that this outstanding institution is endangered.\n\nThere is no justification, no sense and no meaning in any decision that goes against the Filmmusuem, its staff and Naum Kleimann.\n\nWe are all confident that this situation will be rectified immediately, that Naum and the Filmmuseum’s staff reintegrated in their roles, and the Filmmuseum’s future will be secured.\n\nNicola Mazzanti\n\nDirector, Royal Film Archive of Belgium\n\nPresident, Association des Cinémathèques Européennes\n\nTo Prime Minister of Russian Government. Dmitry Medvedev,\n\nLet me join the international community of cinema professionals and share my disbelief and indignation at the danger of the eviction of Mr Naum Kleiman from the post of the leader of The Russian Museum of Cinema. I am deeply concemed about this alarming situation that has arisen.\n\nUnder the leadership of Mr Kleiman the Museum became a major institution of international recognition. What Naum Kleiman did for the preservation, dissemination and research is extremely important not merely for the Russians but for a whole international community of cinema lovers.\n\nWhat is more, the conflict in the Russian Museum of Cinema is a threat to all institutions working to saveguard the memory of cinema in Russia.\n\nTherefore, in respect to Mr. Kleiman’s knowledge and expertise, I would like to protest, in the strongest possibile terms, against the ill-adviced changes in the leadership of the film policy in Russia.\n\nRegards,\n\nTadeusz Kowalski\n\nDirector of The National Film Archive\n\nWarsaw, Poland\n\nThe team of Bulgarska Nacionalna Filmoteka (Bulgarian National Film Archive) joins the international efforts in support of Naum Kleiman and the professional staff of Moscow Cinema Museum. We strongly appeal to the Russian authorities to reconsider their politics towards the Cinema Museum and its director for over 25 years.\n\nBulgarian National Film Archive supports also the plan of The Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts to create a cinema department and to make Cinema Museum part of its structure.\n\nAntonia Kovacheva\n\nDirector of Bulgarska Nacionalna Filmoteka\n\n​Dear Sir,\n\nWe feel ​seriously ​concerned about the future of the Moscow Filmmuseum after Mr Kleiman had been removed from his office. The work of Mr Kleiman and his staff has full support of the academic and archival community around the globe and therefore we ask you to reconsider the situation in the Moscow Filmmuseum and find a reasonable solution which would lead to reintegration of Naum Kleiman and his staff in their roles.\n\n​Respectfully, ​\n\nMichal Bregant\n\n​​General director\n\nNational Film Archive\n\nPrague, Czech Republic\n\nI would like to add my name to the letter of support for the Museum of Cinema in Moscow and its staff which you have written. I received the Prix Jean Mitry in the same year as Naum and as one of the co-founders of the Museum of the Moving Image on the South Bank have a heart-felt sympathy for the predicament he and his staff face.\n\nSincerely\n\nDavid Francis OBE\n\nFormer Curator of the National Film Archive and former Chief of the Motion Picture, Broadcasting and\n\nRecorded Sound Division at the Library of Congress\n\nEn tant qu’historien et archiviste du cinéma pour près de 40 ans à la Cinémathèque québécoise, je ne peux qu’être inquiet de menaces qui mettent en péril une institution centrale pour la connaissance du cinéma russe et soviétique. Je souscris tout à fait à la démarche de mes collègues.\n\nPierre Véronneau\n\nMontréal, Qc\n\nCanada\n\nDear colleagues,\n\nthe international arts & film festival “I mille occhi” in Trieste (Italy) wants to add his support to Naum Kleiman and his staff.\n\nWe know how it is important that one of the greatest film scholars and passionate professionals in the field of film researches and archives, can continue his work in the interest of all people who admire the history of Russian and Soviet cinema.\n\nSergio M. Germani\n\nfestival director\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nGreetings from India!\n\nI would like add my name to the list of signatories to this open letter to Dmitry Medvedev concerning Naum Kleiman. I would also like to share my views on the importance of Naum Kleiman, with other signatories of this letter.\n\nI learnt Russian in the ‘80s to read the writings of Eisenstein, as most of the contents of the six volumes Russian edition were available only in Russian. Subsequently, during my Homi Bhabha Fellowship, I was fortunate to work with Naum Kleiman, in Pera Atasheva’s apartment, which housed the Eisenstein Archives, for five weeks, which changed my life. I owe the best of my writing and filmmaking to this bond, which continues till today.\n\nI have also read the new five volumes of Eisenstein’s volumes in Russian published under the guidance of Naum Kleiman. They contain some of the most important writings on not only cinema, but also on aesthetics published, published from any part of the world. The unflagging spirit of total devotion and impeccable scholarship that Naum Kleiman has shown for over nearly half a century made this monumental task possible He is a man of immense wealth of knowledge and wisdom and has great tasks ahead of him, as my continued correspondence with him has made me understand.\n\nTo deprive him and his colleagues of this opportunity to serve not only Russia but the whole world is an event of immense magnitude. I am sure that a country and culture that has given the world some of the finest artists and thinkers in the world, cannot do such injustice to a man who is a legend in his lifetime.\n\nI have interacted with many filmmakers and scholars, from Jay Leyda, Kevin Brownlow, Bernard Eisenschitz, Annette Michelson, Peter Wollen, Laura Mulvey, late Mani Kaul and our colleague Kumar Shahani, to mention only a few. Each of them have only the highest praise for for Naum Kleiman as a great human being and an exceptionally brilliant mind.\n\nI would request the authorities and the powers be not to do so much harm to a great cause, by preventing Naum Kleiman from continuing his great work. I write this with a heavy heart and give my full support to Naum Kleiman and to my colleagues from the British Film Institute, where I had worked for six months in the late eighties.\n\nWith regards,\n\nArun Khopkar\n\nMumbai, India 400012\n\nDear Friends,\n\nThank you to Sight and Sound and the BFI to publish this letter.\n\nI would be very eager to add my name to support Naum Kleiman’s remarkable work. His incredible knowledge of world, Soviet and Russian cinema, his generosity in sharing this made me one the numerous lucky spectators who discovered thanks to him and his team some unknown films by Igor Savchenko, Friedrich Ermler, Ivan Pyriev, Yuli Rayzman, Marlen Khutsiev, and many others…\n\nNaum Kleiman’s Museum of Cinema is a place of freedom, invention, intelligence, beauty. This cannot vanish just because of a political decision.\n\nVladimir Léon\n\nfilmmaker, producer, Paris\n\nNaum Kleiman, without a doubt, is the most important film preservation specialist and authority on Russian cinema, who has done more to preserve it and make it available to the world than anyone else. No one can replace him.\n\nJonas Mekas\n\nfilmmaker and director of Anthology Film Archives, New York City\n\nGreetings from Bombay!\n\nNaum Kleiman’s contribution to the preservation and documentation of Soviet cinema has been invaluable; to dismiss him in this cavalier fashion is to insult and derogate the work of a tireless and selfless custodian of an important part of the world’s cultural heritage.\n\nWith very best wishes,\n\nRanjit Hoskote\n\npoet, cultural theorist and curator\n\nI sign this letter! Naum Kleinman is a genius who opened our eyes and our heart to a treasure, Russian humanity and art! For me so important!\n\nYolande Zauberman\n\nGolden Fish Moscow Festival for Ivan and Abraham\n\nPlease add my name to the list of signatories to the letter protesting the disastrous dismissal of Naum Kleiman from the Moscow Cinema Museum. Kleiman being at the head of the museum is essential to preserving the heritage of Russian and Soviet Cinema for the world.\n\nKeith Sanborn\n\nFilmmaker, translator, film scholar\n\nI am French and went through the Soviet and Russian Academy of VGIK in the 1970 when Naum Kleiman was already for us, students from all the Soviet republics and from so many different foreign countries an “intelligent and generously minded KEY” to the patrimonial Russian and Soviet cinema. He helped me several times personally to develop projects about the History of Russian Cinema and VGIK for French Television. The Museum and the Centre of Cinema in Moscow is a warm so organically linked to the intelligence and artistic eternal Russian understanding of the world that the work of Naum Kleiman, his team and his followers should be encouraged and given good supports as this investments means a lot of different profits back from all the world.\n\nIrène Tenèze\n\nTo Whom It May Concern\n\nAs a film teacher and author, I would like to add my name to the list of signatories appealing to Dmitry Medvedev to not remove Naum Kleiman from his post at the Moscow Film Museum. On two occasions in the 1990s I lectured on film at the Musuem and have first hand knowledge of Mr. Kleiman’s knowledge of and passionate dedication to the art and history of the cinema. Such a man should be celebrated and cherished, not removed.\n\nYours truly\n\nTony Pipolo, professor emeritus, the Graduate School of the City University of New York\n\nGreetings from Paraguay!\n\nI would like to add my name to the list of signatories to this open letter to Dmitry Medvedev.\n\nNaum Kleiman being at the head of the museum is essential to preserving the heritage of Russian and Soviet Cinema for the world.\n\nI had the unique opportunity to work with Naum Klejman and his staff at the Musej Kino and at Ejzenshtejn’s apartment, which housed the Eisenstein Archives, for some years, and I must recognize that this changed my way of thinking and watching cinema.\n\nNaum Kleiman’s contribution to the preservation and documentation of Soviet and Russian cinema has been invaluable; to dismiss him and his staff would mean to loose an important part of the world’s cultural heritage.\n\n“Musej Kino isn’t only yours, it’s ours too”\n\nBeatrice Albertazzi\n\nProfessor of Teory and Analysis of Film\n\nUnversidad Columbia, Paraguay\n\nDear Monsieur Medvedev,\n\nMy name is Clemence Lhomme, i am an author-composer, grand daughter of Dmitry Kharitonov (Odessa’s studio 1916) and live in Paris, France. I endorse Naum Kleiman’s fight to save the priceless Cinema Museum in Moscow.\n\nJe vous prie d’agréer, monsieur Medvedev, l’expression de mes respectueuses salutations.\n\nClemence Lhomme\n\nTo who it may concern,\n\nPlease add my name to the list of signatories in support of Naum Kleiman if possible. I had the pleasure to meet him both at Musei Kino in Moscow and in Karlovy Vary and worked with him in a minor capacity to organise a catalogue and exhibition of Eisenstein drawings in the Czech Republic.\n\nAs a filmmaker I was also very impressed by the efforts at preserving and presenting cinema heritage at Musei Kino and visited there several times in the previous decade.\n\nKeith Jones\n\ndocumentary filmmaker, former program director MOFFOM Festival, Prague\n\nCzech Republic — South Africa\n\nGreetings!\n\nI do believe that the world of cinema as we know it today would be unfruitful in possibilities without the impassioned contributions of Naum Kleiman. I appeal to all who have learned to live a little more affirmatively from the sound and images of the cinematic art that we keep this light burning in our conscience and our world.\n\nPlease do add my name to the list of signatories to this open letter to Dmitry Medvedev.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAnup Singh\n\nWriter, Filmmaker\n\nI fully endorse the appeal for Naum Kleiman who is one of the greatest human beings on this planet.\n\nKumar Shahani\n\nThanks to all the dear colleagues from all over the world for being with Naum and his team these hard days. We all hope that the situation can’t getting worse than it is right now. ‎This time it’s point of no return.\n\nIt’s hardly possible to imagine anyone in the Russian film industry who deserves more respect than Naum Kleiman for his lifetime of invaluable work and unspotted reputation.\n\nKatya Mtsitouridze\n\nHead of Roskino\n\nEditor-in-chief, Variety Russia\n\nGeneral producer of St. Petersburg International Media Forum\n\nDear Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nI had the privilege to meet Mr. Naum Klejman a couple of times during the Berlinale.\n\nFilm work has much to do with morals and character. The quality of the work is the better the more humanistic a personality is, which is very true with Mr. Klejman. Knowledge, expertise and the respect for the work of others and finding solutions for the rising problems not looking for private advantages but for the best of the given task is so very necessary for good results, for which the Museum was famous under the guide of Mr. Klejman.\n\nI would be honoured if my name could be set under the letter to Mr. Dmitry Medvedev,\n\nSincerely,\n\nAngela Haardt\n\ncurator, Berlin\n\nPlease include my support for Naum Kleiman. With my wife, Florence, we met him in 1986 when we went from Berlin (I had a DAAD filmmaker residency) to Moscow. We carried books to him from the Gregors and carried back a letter to them from Naum, pasted in a book so it did not fall out during inspection by a guard on our return. He could not have been more available, more insightful or more feelingful about the Eisenstein apartment he protected.\n\nThis is a great and courageous man and should not be foolishly insulted now.\n\nKen Jacobs\n\nfilmmaker and retired Distinguished Professor of Cinema, State University of New York at Binghamton\n\nDear Naum,\n\nI am shocked and deeply saddened to hear of the troubles at the Film Museum in Moscow. It was a privilege and a pleasure to have had your precious assistance in the preparation of the English edition of the writings of Sergei Eisenstein. Your knowledge and enthusiasm have been and remain an inspiration to us all.\n\nIn friendship and solidarity,\n\nGeoffrey Nowell-Smith\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI would like to add my name to the letter to Dmitry Medvedev as signatory asking him to allow Naum Kleiman to continue his great work at the Museum. Naum has been an inspiration and has opened many gates to the understanding of Eisenstein and his milieu. Apart from his publications, I particularly remember a wonderful lecture he gave in Stockholm some years ago on Eisenstein in Central Asia, which was absolutely fascinating and prompted me to work further on this topic. Needless to say, Kleiman was very generous in helping me with material.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRashmi Doraiswamy\n\nAs a film teacher, I would like to add my name to the list of signatories appealing to Dmitry Medvedev to not remove Naum Kleiman and his staff from the Moscow Film Museum. I knew Kleiman’s remarkable work of archivist and scholar by my husband Fernaldo Di Giammatteo who spent in Moscow several months in different years analyzing the precious movies of the Moscow Film Museum. European cinema can’t miss this heritage and its custodians.\n\nCristina Bragaglia\n\nProfessor, Alma Mater University of Bologna\n\nPer noi che frequentiamo il Museo da vent’anni, per gli studiosi di cinema e per tutti coloro che hanno avuto anche solo la minima opportunità di incontrare il direttore Naum Klejman e il suo staff, la perdita di un luogo così prezioso e straordinario, frutto di un’esperienza raccolta nel corso di venticinque anni, sarebbe davvero grave. E naturalmente, in quanto patrimonio cinematografico di tutta l’umanità, costituirebbe un forte segno di degrado per la cultura in generale.\n\nViviana del Bianco, Direttore\n\nGrazia Santini, Direttore esecutivo\n\nSabina Viti, segreteria\n\nCristina Pucci, ufficio Stampa\n\nEugenia Gaglianone, Specialista cinema russo e sovietico\n\nOlga Strada, corrispondente\n\nN.I.C.E. New Italian Cinena Event, Firenze, Italy\n\nNaum is not only a national treasure as one of the most eminent Russian scholars of international film, he is a great soul in the world family, and deserves to continue doing what he has done so thoughtfully and with such expertise for so many years. Dismissing him is a terrible, callous act and can only have the worst consequences for the film community in Russia.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDonald Sosin & Joanna Seaton, film composers/musicians, New York\n\nNaum Klejman is and has always been a bridge between cultures and nations. We need him and his Muzej kino in Moscow, where I have been treated with amazing friendliness by his great staff and himself. I hope the authorities in Russia will recognise that as well!\n\nAdelheid Heftberger\n\nCurator at the Austrian Film Museum, Vienna\n\nGreetings !\n\nI am really hurt to know that Russian Govt has decided to dismiss Naum Kleiman’s works, which is a treasure house for us filmmakers and academicians. We don’t understand the regional complexities, again we are the citizens of this World and it is our responsibility too, to protect the treasures of our history, time and culture.\n\nI strongly oppose the idea of this kind of an dismissal and request the Russian Govt. to look back in justice.\n\nPlease do add my name to the list of signatories to this open letter to Dmitry Medvedev.\n\nAnamika Bandopadhyay, Filmmaker, Author, Lecturer in Film-Studies\n\nUSA, Salt Lake City\n\nNo doubt I sign the letter to Medinskij — it was a shame to lay Naum Iyekhilyevich Kleiman off in the first place. After the tragic loss of Vladimir Yurevich Dmitriev last year Kleiman arguably is THE Russian film historian and theorist. Getting rid of cultural traditions is not just a national question, film culture is international and, after all, it was emigrants from Russia building what we now call Hollywood.\n\nIra Kormannshaus\n\nDear sir,\n\nA film archive, by definition, holds and includes a variety of works reflecting the diversity of ideas and standpoints – both political and artistic – that have influenced their creation.\n\nWhat is popular and politic one day can become its opposite another: history shows us that with sometimes violent clarity.\n\nFor these reasons many feel that the same grace once accorded to the King’s jester be allowed also to organisations that safeguard cultural work, museums and film archives, so as to preserve works whose importance and value has not yet come to be fully appreciated.\n\nTo silence or allow too firm a control over the Moscow Cinema Museum would be to deprive the rest of the world access to the riches, (both recognised and as yet, unappreciated) that the Russian cinema has to offer.\n\nThat would be a shame. I give my support to Naum Klejman and his team.\n\nAgnès Torrens, Cinémathèque de Tours Henri Langlois, Tours France\n\nI’m Anita Kravos, Italian actress, honorary president of the N.I.C.E. New Italian Cinema Events.\n\nDuring the last 20 years our international Festival has benefit a lot of the specific qualities of the Moscow Cinema Museum.\n\nBoth United States and Europe look at the Russian Moscow Cinema Museum as an inspiration for creativity in industry system.\n\nNaum Kleinman deservs your support.\n\nWith respect,\n\nAnita Kravos, N.I.C.E. New Italian Cinena Event, Firenze, Italy\n\nEvery archive makes a unique contribution to safeguarding the world’s cultural heritage. The Moscow Cinema Museum — with Naum and his wonderful colleagues — has long been a crucial part of a much larger whole. Removing their immense knowledge and expertise will only serve to devalue the position of the Cinema Museum within that wider community.\n\nElaine Burrows, former archivist at BFI/NFTVA\n\nI was lucky enough to be entertained by Naum Kleiman in Eisenstein’s flat four years ago, which turned out to be one of the most curious and profound experiences of my adult life. He truly is the keeper of the flame, without which we are surely in darkness. People of his stature are rare indeed, and must be cherished.\n\nRhidian Davis\n\nCultural Programme Manager\n\nBFI Programme Dept.\n\nBritish Film Institute\n\nA qui de droit\n\nJe mène depuis plusieurs années des recherches sur le cinéaste Sergueï Eisenstein. Sans le patient et long travail accompli par Naoum Kleiman, sans sa passion et sa grande connaissance du cinéma, sans sa ferme conviction, envers et contre tout, qu’il est nécessaire que la Russie dispose d’un Musée du cinéma qui permette de conserver, de faire connaître et d’étudier le riche patrimoine cinématographique russe et soviétique, sans donc Naoum Kleiman et son équipe, sans l’existence du Musée du cinéma, jamais je n’aurais pu mener mes recherches et mes travaux. Je leur en suis infiniment reconnaissante.\n\nC’est donc avec tristesse et consternation que j’ai suivi les dernières nouvelles relatives à l’équipe de Naoum Kleiman et à la défiance que leur a exprimée le Ministère de la Culture de la Fédération de Russie. La perspective que le Musée du cinéma de Moscou soit aujourd’hui menacé est effrayante. Cela signifie que le riche patrimoine qu’il contient, un patrimoine précieux et unique de l’histoire mondiale du cinéma, est donc menacé également. Il est urgent et indispensable que les collections du Musée du cinéma continuent à être scientifiquement archivées et valorisées mais aussi à être continuellement enrichies par une équipe sérieuse et compétente, comme cela a toujours été le cas sous la direction de Naoum Kleiman, afin de pouvoir être accessibles et étudiées par les chercheurs et cinéphiles d’aujourd’hui et de demain.\n\nDans ce cadre, je soutiens totalement et inconditionnellement Naum Kleiman et son équipe, en espérant que la mobilisation internationale permettra de rétablir la situation.\n\nParis, le 1er novembre,\n\nAda Ackerman\n\nChargée de recherches au CNRS\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nThe fact of being far from Russia, far more from Moscow’s Museum and far more from being close to Mr. Naum Kleiman, shouldn’t stop me from expressing myself in this particularly concerning moment.\n\nSometimes distance helps to see clear. And, the more I stare at Mr. Kleiman portrait (posted all over again and again) the more I see a gentle, kind, loving man. Filmmaking teaches a little about reading people’s faces.\n\nI have closely assisted to previous situations where arrogance – arrogant people are non-learners – wanted to display those we so call ‘Masters’. I recall the affair of Henri Langlois, and more recently the case João Bénard da Costa (at the Cinemateca Portuguesa). Reading statements posted from everywhere in the world, I can’t avoid establishing a parallel to the present situation.\n\nThe fact of thinking to send home a man whose knowledge, love and dedication are an enormous gift to Culture and History seams to me a presumptuous mistake too difficult to accept and impossible to repair.\n\nSo, from my humble chair, I deeply thank to Mr. Naum Kleiman and I still hope previous examples can be good ones, for all of us helping to prevent such injustice fault.\n\nRita Azevedo Gomes\n\nFilmmaker\n\nProgrammer at the Cinemateca Portuguesa-Museu do Cinemateca\n\nTo Prime-Minister of Russian Government, Dmitry Medvedev\n\nWith great concern we have heard that a fellow film archivist and historian, Naum Kleijman, whom we regard as one of the most important figures in the world in our field, has been put out of office and has been replaced with someone else, who by all accounts seems to be unable to cope with the task. Consequently, the entire team at the Filmmuseum in Mosvow has resigned, and one of the most important repositories of knowledge about Russian and international cinema is rendered without brain, without head, and without heart.\n\nThis is only the last blow in a longer chain of administrative decisions that have made it difficult for the Filmmuseum to continue its valuable work over the last few years.\n\nWe wonder, why your government does not stop all the attempts to darken the days Mr. Kleijman — a man of world-wide recognition. We do not believe that ridiculous allegations and bureaucratic actions to make his life and work more difficult are the intention of the Russian government. We strongly believe it should be expected from competent authorities that they would do everything possible to help the fantastic institution that the Moscow Filmmuseum is.\n\nWe urge you to step in and stop the destruction of the Filmmuseum, reinstate Naum Klejman and his team and support the famous Filmmusem corresponding to its worldwide reputation. It goes without saying that this reputation was mainly gained by Naum Klejman’s efforts during the last decades.\n\nDr. Rainer Rother\n\nDeutsche Kinemathek — Museum für Film und Fernsehen\n\nBerlin\n\nI adamantly support re-instating Naum Kleiman and his staff at the Russian Cinematheque in Moscow. Anyone who loves world cinema understands the value of Russian films and their significant contribution to world culture. One cannot under-estimate the necessity of a stewardship that can best maintain and continue to cultivate that rich and meaningful legacy. Other than the late Henril Langois in France, I cannot think of a more qualified leader than Naum Kleiman. To dismiss him is to deprive us all of what’s essential and at the core of any movie of true value: The need to keep us awake to the moment while engaging our hearts and minds in questioning who we are, where we’ve been and where we’re going. I feel that to stand by his dismissal would be a tragedy and respectfully hope that re-instating him be given profound consideration.\n\nClark Middleton\n\nactor, director, writer, teacher New York City, NY, USA\n\nUn art ne peut pas exister sans sa mémoire. Les cinémathèques sont les mémoires du cinéma, elles doivent être protégées et dirigées par des gens compétents et attentifs au respect des oeuvres.\n\nLuc Beraud, réalisateur-scénariste, France\n\nI have met Mr. Kleiman in 2005 during Europalia.Russia in Brussels.\n\nWe organised masterclasses and screenings with him around and about the film art of Sergueï M. Eisenstein.\n\nThese events were as successful as the were inspiring for me, my colleagues and my students. I want to express my wish that Mr. Kleiman needs to stay director of the Moscow Cinema Museum.\n\nWouter Hessels, Lecturer Film & Media Studies, RITS School of Arts, Brussels, Belgium"
