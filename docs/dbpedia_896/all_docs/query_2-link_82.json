        "text": "Louisiana Red and Bob Corritore met in Chicago in 1981 at Delta Fish Market where they played together for the first time. The following year Bob settled in Phoenix, Arizona and soon Red traveled there. Together they played at city clubs and surrounding area until Red was booked for a tour in Europe where he met his wife Dora and decided to settle in Germany. However, their friendship between these two blues masters remained and, since year 2000, Red traveled once a year for a tour in USA and he always stopped in Arizona to play or recording with his good friend Bob Corritore, something he did until he passed away in February 2012.\n\nThe album includes eleven songs recorded by Red and Corritore from seven different sessions between 2000 and 2009. Both musicians’ deep connection and chemistry becomes evident if you listen carefully to the eleven Red’s own compositions album songs, he performs with his immense feeling surrounded by Corritore’s harmonica which sounds totally inspired always giving the right support and filling the silence spots with a total flexibility and an amazing good taste.\n\nThe album also features some deluxe collaborations coming from artists like Chico Chism, David Maxwell, Bob Margolin, Little Victor’s Juke Joint, Buddy Reed, Johnny Rapp, Chris James, Patrick Rynn and Brian Fahey among others. What you will listen can be simply defined as old style Chicago blues, but the true thing is it totally fills me because I deeply love it."
