        "text": "Bob Corritore & Friends – Somebody Put Bad Luck On Me\n\nVizzTone Label Group\n\nhttp://www.bobcorritore.com\n\n16 Tracks – 69 minutes\n\nHarmonica master Bob Corritore has delivered a large quantity of top-notch recordings over the last few years, most of which fall into his “From the Vaults” series that involves recordings of artists he played with over the years at his famous Phoenix, Arizona night club, The Rhythm Room. But unlike those recordings, this latest collection is all freshly recorded songs with a vast array of his friends. The friends being many of the top blues artists playing in today’s music scene. And while Bob’s harp is certainly a major portion of every recording he releases, he blends his harmonica into the style of music presented by each of his friends. Jimi “Primetime” Smith also plays guitar on thirteen of the tracks on the album and takes the lead vocals on one.\n\nJohn Primer kicks things off on vocals and guitar on A.C. Reeds’ “This Little Voice”, a pure blast of Chicago blues with Anthony Geraci on piano. Thornetta Davis proclaims “I Need a Whole Lotta Lovin'” with Johnny Burgin taking the guitar lead and David Keyes on piano on a rockin’ number. Johnny Rawls on vocals slows things down with the powerful, moody “Midnight Love” with Shea Marshall on organ, while Bob’s harp cries and Doug James accents on sax. The title song “Somebody Put Bad Luck On Me” was written and first recorded by Baby Boy Warren in 1954. Oscar Wilson takes on the vocals for this one with Ben Levin providing the piano on another Chicago blues number and Billy Flynn on guitar.\n\nBobby Rush tells the tale of the woman who broke his heart on “I’m Good as Gone”. with Dexter Allen and Chester Thompson on organ. This is the first single release from the album. “Stranded” is credited as having been written by Deadric Malone, which is the pseudonym for Don Robey. The song was originally recorded by Clarence “Gatesmouth” Brown. Carl Weathersby does the vocals and guitar on this one with Anthony Geraci again on piano. Thornetta Davis returns to plea to her lover to “Remember Me” “when I’m buried in the cold, cold ground.” The song was originally written and recorded by Alberta Adams. Johnny Burgin provides the guitar lead with David Keyes on piano. Tia Carroll is the vocalist on Willie Dixon’s “I Want to Be Loved” with Sid Morris on piano.\n\nEugene “Hideaway” Bridges plays guitar and the vocals on a smooth R&B “If You Don’t Want to Love Me”. Sugaray Rayford announces that he is “Goin’ Fishin'”, on a funky track that notes “I don’t need no rod and reel… my newly printed dollar bills and my big Lincoln seals the deal.” with Kid Ramos and Johnny Mann on the guitar. Lurie Bell plays guitar and growls on Jimmy Rogers’ “Act Like You Love Me” with Bob Margolin adding guitar. Francine Reed begs him to “Draw Me Closer” in a R&B number originally written and performed by Doris Payne in the early 1960’s. Kid Ramos again joins on guitar with Shea Marshall on organ. Jimi “Primetime” Smith takes on the vocal duties on “Tough Enough” with Johnny Rapp on guitar. Carl Weathersby plays guitar and is the vocalist on Sonny Boy Williamson’s “I Don’t Know” with Anthony Geraci on piano. Diunna Greenleaf begs everyone to “Help the Poor” on a song first recorded by B.B. King in 1964. Frad Kaplan plays organ and piano with Doug James on sax and Jeff “Doc” Chandonhouse on a jazzy trumpet. Willie Buck closes the album with William Crawford’s “Let Me Find Out Your Name” with Billy Flynn on guitar and Ben Levin on piano.\n\nThe rhythm section for the songs also includes a vast array of well-known friends. On bass, Bob Stroger performs on seven of the cuts with Yahni Riley, Kedar Roy, Troy Sandow, Mike King and Bill Stove filling out the remainder. Drummers include Wes Starr, Brian Fahey, Steve Ferrone, June Core, Stephen Hodges, and Andrew Gutterman. James “Jamaldi” Anderson also adds percussion.\n\nAs always, every track is a masterpiece featuring Bob’s sharp production and amazing harmonica work. His albums have been one that I look forward to for every release and he certainly has a lot of very talented friends. Keep them coming Bob."
