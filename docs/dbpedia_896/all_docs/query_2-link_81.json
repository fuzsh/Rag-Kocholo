        "text": "By Mike O’Cull\n\nHarp ace Bob Corritore and Chicago blues guitar master John Primer team up for a smoking hot new album called The Gypsy Woman Told Me that hits the street May 1st, 2020 thanks to the VizzTone Label Group. Both men are modern-day legends who have invested their lives into playing real take-no-mess Chicago blues music that honors the giants of decades past while also breathing new life into this important American cultural institution.\n\nProduced by Bob Corritore, Clarke Rigsby, and Kid Andersen, The Gypsy Woman Told Me is Primer and Corritore’s third combined effort and proudly displays both player’s talents and commitment to this world-renowned style that has influenced so many. In addition, special guests including Billy Flynn, Jimi “Primetime” Smith, Kid Andersen, Bob Welsh, Ben Levin, Kedar Roy, Troy Sandow, Mike Hightower, June Core, and Brian Fahey pop in to turn these tracks up even further and make this one of this year’s best new albums.\n\nJohn Primer is a familiar face to anyone who has followed Chicago’s blues scene over the last 30-some years. He has worked with Muddy Waters, Magic Slim and Junior Wells as well as leading his own hardcore blues group. Bob Corritore is a Blues Music Award winner who has appeared with Louisiana Red, Bo Diddley, Pinetop Perkins, Ike Turner, Nappy Brown and Eddy Clearwater. Both musicians have credibility to spare and resumes any blues player would love to call their own. Their combined horsepower and reverence for the blues form give The Gypsy Woman Told Me the kind of musical mojo needed to capture the ears of blues aficionados near and far.\n\nThe record gets underway with the Elmore James-inspired “Keep A-Driving.” It’s an upbeat shuffle that features Primer’s impassioned vocals and guitar licks and Corritore blowing the daylights out of his harmonica. This is the sound blues fans love to dance to and this crew lays it down as well as anyone ever has. The rhythm section grooves exquisitely and rubs the pocket just right. Up next is the title cut “The Gypsy Woman Told Me,” which is a mid-speed slow burner that rocks nicely and brings us Corritore getting down with a magnificently gritty harp tone that comes across loud and clear. Primer again commands the vocal mic with authority and does fine work on lead and rhythm guitar.\n\n“Gambling Blues” is a back porch-style acoustic guitar and harmonica track that strips down to the bare essentials. It tells a hard luck tale of the gambling and drinking path and how that sporting part of that life had to come to an end, even if the boozing didn’t. Consider it a statement of a lesson learned. J.J. Cale’s “Same Old Blues” gets a funky, lowdown treatment that again lets Corritore’s dark-toned harp shine brightly. Primer’s smooth, economical guitar style fits the song perfectly and enhances its swampy attitude.\n\n“My Imagination” is another righteous shuffle that hits the sweet spot dead on. “It was just my imagination, what my baby had on her mind” sings Primer and the pain in the lyric is obvious despite the joyous beat the band cranks out. It’s a dance floor filler, without a doubt. “Left Me With A Broken Heart” is heavy and emotive like brown liquor in a dirty glass. Primer tells a tale of love gone south and makes it authentic and true. He captures the “good man feeling bad” essence of the blues and makes everyone within earshot understand it in their soul. Every bit of The Gypsy Woman Told Me is more than worth your listening time and will make lovers of the real Chicago sound extremely happy. Primer and Corritore are an unbeatable pair and this set deserves a spot in all of our record collections.\n\nJohn Primer and Bob Corritore Online\n\nJohn Primer"
