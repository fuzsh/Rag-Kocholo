CD Release Party on Friday at The Rhythm Room!\n\nToday is the official release date for The Henry Gray / Bob Corritore Sessions / Vol. 1 Blues Won’t Let Me Take My Rest on Delta Groove Music. Henry Gray will be coming to Phoenix to join Bob Corritore at his nightclub, The Rhythm Room, for a CD Release party this Friday, June 19th!\n\nAt 90-years young, Louisiana native Henry Gray has amassed an incredibly prolific career in American music. With a history of performing that spans more than seven decades, the acclaimed blues pianist is probably best known for his 12-year tenure, beginning in 1956, with the legendary vocalist Howlin’ Wolf. Gray’s role as a highly in-demand session player has graced such revered labels as Chess, Vee-Jay and United, whereby he was featured on a multitude of iconic recordings including those by Bo Diddley, Jimmy Reed, Jimmy Rogers, Morris Pejoe and Little Walter.\n\nMore recently, some of Gray’s further notable accomplishments include; a 1998 Grammy Award nomination for his work on the album, A Tribute to Howlin’ Wolf; a featured segment in Martin Scorsese’s seven part series, The Blues, which aired nationally on PBS; a guest appearance on the live recording, Time Brings About a Change… A Floyd Dixon Celebration, featuring Floyd Dixon, Pinetop Perkins and Fred Kaplan; as well as becoming a recipient of the National Heritage Fellowship Award by the National Endowment for the Arts in 2006.\n\nGray’s association with harmonica ace Bob Corritore was first established in 1996. Their visceral cohesiveness and long standing musical bond has produced a consistent body of work that’s steeped in purity and tradition. Past collaborative efforts by this formidable pair include the 1999 release of Corritore’s All-Star Blues Sessions, Gray’s Plays Chicago Blues, which received Blues Music Award nominations in 2002 for both Comeback Blues Album of the Year and Traditional Album of the year, and a pair of Corritore’s Delta Groove outings including, Longtime Friends in the Blues, featuring veteran Chicago blues vocalist Tail Dragger, as well as Harmonica Blues, which took the BMA’s top honor for Historical Album of the Year in 2011.\n\nWith Gray’s recent 90th birthday (born January 19, 1925), Corritore has taken it upon himself to share more of this truly valuable musical partnership by liberating another treasure trove of melodious gems from his seemingly infinite recording vaults. This first volume presents a 14-song selection recorded over a 19-year period, in which all but four tracks are previously unissued. Gray handles the lion’s share of the vocal duties on ten of these selections, with Robert Lockwood, Jr., John Brim, Nappy Brown, Tail Dragger and Dave Riley providing one vocal each. At the core of these songs are the Gray and Corritore team, who effectively demonstrate their robust musical prowess and understated taste. They are joined on the proceedings by a rotating lineup of some of the blues’ finest musicians for a program of fully-realized songs that alternate between rollicking, partying jumps and shuffles, to the deepest of blues!\n\nJune 8, 2015 – Bob Corritore Appears In Chicago This Week!\n\nBob Corritore returns to his hometown to play the Chicago Blues Festival and a few extra cool club dates!

In the last few years, Sugaray Rayford has emerged as one of the greatest forces in the blues with his powerful gospel-infused vocals, his 6’4′ stature, his animated stage show, and his great band-leading and fronting. He has had simultaneous success as both the lead singer of The Mannish Boys, and fronting his own powerful horn driven R&B band. His new CD, Southside, just out this week on Nimoy Sue Records, is an example of the later. This is a contemporary soul/blues masterpiece with 9 beautifully written orignal compositions. Sugaray’s band includes Gino Matteo, Ralph Carter (who also co-wrote most of the songs), Lavell Jones, Allan Walker, Gary Bivona, Leo Dombecki and Jade Bennett with additional album guest appearances by Zara Davis, Rachelle Quiogue, John Thomas, Bob Corritore (guest on one song), George Pandis and Bill Bixler.

The YouTube description: “An interview with the legendary American blues musician Muddy Waters. Considered one of the foremost artists in blues history. Muddy was in Jersey, Channel Islands performing a concert at Fort Regent leisure centre. First broadcast on Channel Television on the 24th June 1981.” Click here to see.\n\nThe Aces play “Off The Wall” on YouTube! The Aces were considered by many to be the consummate backing group in Chicago blues. They consisted of drummer Fred Below on drums, and brothers Louis and Dave Myers. Louis played guitar as a primary instrument, but would play part of each show on harmonica (he played both brilliantly), and Dave played both bass and guitar (depending on the time period). This video from 1970 shows Louis on harmonica playing a song that he and the Aces played behind Little Walter on the original hit record of 1953. No wonder why Louis Myers plays the song “Off The Wall” like he owns it! Below is killing it on the drums, Dave Myers is solid as a rock on the bass and an unidentified and unseen guitarist (Eddie Taylor?) is playing all the right stuff Click here to see.\n\nMay 15, 2015 – R.I.P.
