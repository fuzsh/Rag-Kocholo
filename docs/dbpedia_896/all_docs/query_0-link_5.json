        "text": "Kelly’s Lot — “The Blues Remind Me” — PK Entertainment\n\nKelly Zirbes, the Kelly of Kelly’s Lot, is celebrating her 30th year making Americana, folk and blues music with her 17th album, and first in three years, “The Blues Remind Me.”\n\nThe Lot is a great mix of talented musicians; for this session that includes guitarist Perry Robertson, who produced and shared the songwriting with Zirbes on all ten tracks, Mike Sauer on drums and Matt McFadden on bass. Keyboard player Mo Beeks appears on most songs, and duets with Zirbes on a song he also co-wrote, “Gotta Sing the Blues.” Longtime Lot saxman Bill Johnston arranged the horns, including Paulie Cerra, Didier Reyes, Chip Tingle and Aviva Maloney. Special guests are Rob Zucca, guitar; Gary Bivona, flugel horn; and Frank Hinojosa and Tomislav Goluban on harp. That’s quite a band-full, but everyone comes together at the right place and time to create a masterful musical backing.\n\nThe album gets itself under way with that gorgeous duet between Zirbes and Beeks, with her sultry vocals paired with Beeks’ down-home grit, explaining how they “Gotta Sing the Blues.” It’s one of the most enjoyable songs in the session, throbbing with soulful blues. “Boogie Bus” follows, a rollicking party song that invites everyone to join the fun, and “boogie woogie all night long.”\n\n“Mama’s Blues” is an eloquent tribute to Zirbes’ mother’s singing: “What else would I do/If I couldn’t keep singing her blues/It’s my way of healing.” Zirbes’ poignant vocals are enhanced by an elegant horn section, making this tender ballad an album highlight. The horns keep flowing, kicking up their heels on the energetic “It Ain’t Always,” another track full of musical fun.\n\n“Man In The Moon” takes a jazzy turn, carried along by Beeks on keys in a lovely, lilting airing from Zirbes. “Without You” pounds home an insistent political message about coming together, framing contemporary politics. “Just Tell Me the Truth” follows, with its bouncy plea for hope and honesty changing the mood to one of healing differences.\n\n“Blessings (are born from tears)” includes Beeks working the Hammond organ behind Zirbes’ passionate blues that soar from whispers to shouting and back again: “Life can hurt you so bad that it’s good….”\n\nGoluban steps up with sparkling harp on the rhythmic “Aces,” a fund-raising trip to the tables in Vegas. The closer is the upbeat theme and music of “Love and Understanding,” with light-hearted keys and lyrical sensibility: “Without love and understanding, we’ll never win.”\n\nKelly Zirbes and her Los Angeles-based Lot have been creating their music for 30 years now, always with a blues presence, but this time with a stronger focus throughout the album. She’s an outstanding singer, creating moods that flow effortlessly from tough to tender. And it’s easy to say a lot about the Lot, who complete the package with sharp songwriting and music that elevates but never intrudes.\n\n“I Gotta Sing the Blues” from the album:\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. Gotta Sing The Blues (feat. Mo Beeks)\n\n02. Boogie Bus\n\n03. Mama’s blues\n\n04. It Ain’t Always\n\n05. Man In The Moon\n\n06. Without You\n\n07. Just Tell Me The Truth\n\n08. Blessings\n\n09. Aces\n\n10. Love And Understanding\n\nChristopher Wyze — “Stuck in the Mud” — Big Radio Records\n\nIf the blues knows how to sing life’s song, then singer/songwriter Christopher Wyze has learned that lesson well. The 13 original songs on his very first album, “Stuck in the Mud,” are steeped in that storied tradition, as Wyze blends the world of his fertile story-telling imagination into the essence of the blues.\n\nWyze has been soaking up that essence for the better part of two decades, visiting its primeval sources in the Mississippi Delta and letting his own thoughts flow into his songs. Those chops earned him a “One to Watch” songwriter award from the Nashville Songwriters Association International in December 2023.\n\nWyze and his band, the Tellers, recorded “Stuck in the Mud” in two musically historic places – ten tracks in Muscle Shoals, Ala., and three in Clarksdale, Miss. His inspiration for the songs, however, was pure Clarksdale, where he wrote them all – each with a co-writer. “In the Delta,” Wyze says, “songs seems to write themselves.” Wyze also gives each song a voice, in his own flowing, distinctive vocal style that shifts gears easily from old blues to rhythmic rock and gentle folk.\n\nThe story-telling begins with the open-road feel of the first cut, “Three Hours From Memphis,” where Wyze introduces his blues journey: “Three hours from Memphis / A million miles from home / Fifteen years of paying dues, I did it on my own.” Frustrations with the hard times show up in the bluesy “Stuck in the Mud,” though: “Tried and tried, ain’t nothin’ brewin’ / Nothin’ to show, but my undoin’.”\n\n“Cotton Ain’t King” is a deeply sung, dirge-like tribute to a new southern “king” – “Songs of blue, restoring life / Crying from the soul. / Cotton ain’t king / Blues is the king.” Sung as a traditional narrative, “Soul on the Road” examines the solitude of the lonesome traveler: “Met a fella, he lived his days, collecting miles and not friends / No wife, no kids, just a road that never ends.”\n\n“Back to Clarksdale” is a hard-driving visit to the source – “When I pay my dues / My life is what I lose / Just lay me down in those muddy shoes / Down in Clarksdale, play the blues!” An easy-loping shuffle, “Money Spent Blues” laments a different kind of worldly loss, cleverly phrased over tough blues guitar lines – “When you make a proposition, you know I can’t refuse / Got them money spent blues.”\n\nA touch of funk introduces the fatalistic “Caution to the Wind,” with a high-energy guitar solo — “Future, up ahead / But can we change instead? / What is it that we dread? / All gonna, all gonna end up dead.” But what’s the use anyway, as the hard-edged “Hard Work Don’t Pay” mourns: “Well I done cashed me may last paycheck / Sat down and wrote this song.”\n\n“Life Behind Bars” is another profoundly sad tale of a different kind of confinement: “When it’s music, we call the bars measures / When he’s drinking, he calls the bars home / So he’s locked up and calls the bars walls that surround him / All it’s earned him, is life lived alone.”\n\n“Looking for My Baby” turns hopefully upbeat, bouncing along with a rollicking honky-tonk piano break – “I search both night and day, but there’s no girl that got away / I’m looking for my baby, cause I ain’t never had a girl, hey, hey.” The punchy, chant-like refrain of “Wake Up” encourages an enthusiastic activism – “People! Enter the fray! / People! Live for today! / Wake up!”\n\nAlthough it’s musically flavored with classic hypnotic North Mississippi Hill Country blues riffs, the lyrics of “Good Friend Gone” tell a more modern tale: “Those teenage blues, they drove us crazy / We didn’t do the things we should / Didn’t do the things we supposed to / But we sure did the things we could.” The closer is the gently swinging “Someday,” filled with the hopeful optimism of this musical journey – “Day after tomorrow, gonna be a go-getter / Someday, someday I’ll win the big game.”\n\nChristopher Wyze is anything but “Stuck in the Mud” on this compelling debut album. He’s a lyrically literate delight, a smartly articulate teller of original tales filled with all the pain and pleasure of the blues. He’s already a winner at that “big game.”\n\n“Stuck in the Mud” from the album:\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. Three Hours from Memphis\n\n02. Stuck in the Mud (feat. Cary Hudson)\n\n03. Cotton Ain’t King\n\n04. Soul on the Road (feat. Cary Hudson)\n\n05. Back to Clarksdale\n\n06. Money Spent Blues\n\n07. Caution to the Wind\n\n08. Hard Work Don’t Pay (feat. Cary Hudson)\n\n09. Life Behind Bars\n\n10. Looking for My Baby\n\n11. Wake Up\n\n12. Good Friend Gone\n\n13. Someday\n\nChris Cain — “Good Intentions Gone Bad” — Alligator Records\n\nFairly often in this blog, I write about artists who may not be well-known nationally, but who definitely deserve a wider stage.\n\nToday’s choice, Chris Cain, is a good example of another kind of performer — one who has been on the national scene for decades, with fifteen acclaimed albums and multiple awards to his credit, and much praise from his peers. With all those accolades, it seems odd, but he still appears to be criminally under-recognized as a major talent when blues guitar gods are catalogued as household names. Cain is a topflight singer and songwriter, as well as a wickedly sharp blues guitar player, and assuredly deserves a higher ranking in that pantheon.\n\n“Good Intentions Gone Bad” should be the album that helps boost Cain’s ratings in that universe. It’s his 16th album and second for Alligator Records, recorded at Kid Andersen’s Greaseland Studio, with Andersen producing. The thirteen original songs reflect Cain’s sharpness as a tunesmith, and his music reflects his strong, tough guitar chops honed over his decades of work. And Andersen’s addition of a horn section on seven tracks gives Cain’s songs an added, swinging, dimension.\n\nThose horns help kick off the first three tracks: The bouncy “Too Little Too Late” opens with Cain’s gritty vocals and stinging guitar riffs that set the tone for what’s to come. Cain favors big fat guitar notes, sparingly played, filled with intensity from what they don’t say, as much as what they do. “Fear Is My New Roommate” is up next, with world-weary vocals adding heft to the thought he is “not sure what is going to happen to the world.” The title track shows up next, favoring with a little New Orleans swing behind clever lyrical tales of how his good intentions don’t always work out.\n\n“Waiting For the Sun to Rise” drops the horns and focuses on Cain’s soulful vocal plea in this steamy ballad. “I Was Wrong” jumps back in with an upbeat apology, then the bluesy “Time to Cry” wails his frustration with time for nothing but “time to cry.”\n\nCain’s ode to aging (he’s approaching 70), “Still Drinking Straight Tequila,” explains that he hasn’t quite given up everything that gives him pleasure. “Bad Dream” is a torchy blues, with Cain showing off his piano licks. “Had About All I Can Take” shuffles in with its self-explanatory title and a fierce guitar solo.\n\n“Blues for My Dad” is softly lyrical with jazz overtones, a heartfelt tribute to how his Dad introduced him to music. It’s a touching musical memory. On “TGIF,” takes to both piano and Wurlitzer as he celebrates the coming weekend with Lisa Andersen joining in with background vocals. “Never let You Break My Heart” is another torchy blues, wringing the sadness from blue notes. The closer is a romp through “Thankful,” with Tommy Castro helping on vocals. It’s a fitting upbeat finale to this outstanding session.\n\n“Good Intentions Gone Bad” is one of Chris Cain’s best. It showcases all the talents of a veteran bluesman whose musical maturity sings loud and clear. And it’s full of great blues. Enjoy it soon and often.

The current band is Kim Wilson on vocals and harmonica, Johnny Moeller on guitar, Bob Welsh on keyboards and guitar, Rudy Albin on drums and Steve Kirsty on bass.\n\nAnd co-founder Wilson, the only original T-Bird still in the band, says, “I think “Struck Down” is my best album with The Fabulous Thunderbirds…by far.” It’s hard to disagree. It’s filled with great songs, fine performances and a stellar musical cast.\n\nSpecial guests include Bonnie Raitt, Taj Mahal, Keb’ Mo’ and Mick Fleetwood on the album’s lone cover song, Memphis Minnie’s “Nothing in Rambling.” Other guests are Elvin Bishop, Terrance Simien and Canadian guitar whiz Steve Strongman, who with Wilson wrote nine of the album’s ten tracks.\n\nStrongman leads off the opener, “Struck Down With the Blues,” wrapping a torrid guitar around Wilson’s vocals, which after 50 years are as strong as ever, having aged to vintage quality. Simien leads with his accordion on “Don’t Make No Sense,” adding a Cajun flair, with a little help from Wilson’s harp.\n\n“Payback Time” is tough, rocking blues with Gibbons on guitar and backup vocals. That’s followed by the gorgeous acoustic cover version of the Memphis Minnie classic, “Nothing in Rambling,” on which Bonnie Raitt, Taj Mahal and Keb’ Mo’ trade vocals, with Mick Fleetwood handling drums and percussion. It’s a classic in its own way and an album highlight.\n\n“Won’t Give Up” is another tough rocker with Wilson adding furious harp lines, and lyrical nod to one of his first big hits: “Don’t tell me I’m not tough enough.” A gently swinging harp opens the acoustic ballad, “The Hard Way,” with a soulful Wilson vocal turn. “Whatcha Do To Me” shuffles in with Elvin Bishop on guitar and more fine Wilson harp.\n\n“I’ve Got Eyes” opens with a percussive beat charged with the blues, and a stinging guitar solo chasing Wilson’s razor-sharp harp. “That’s Cold” keeps the tempo high in a frantic tale of a lover’s distress. The closer is another highlight, the luxurious ballad “Sideline,” with Chris Ayries’ eloquent harmonizing, and a sensuous sax solo from Kirsty.\n\n“Struck Down” is an excellent album. It’s just the right mix of styles and tempos, showing off Wilson’s accumulated musical wisdom and lyrical strength, a half-century into the Thunderbirds’ long and spirited career. They are still tuff enuff!\n\nA live performance of the T-Birds big 1986 hit, “Tuff Enuff”:\n\n“Payback Time” from the album:\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.

I’ve seen him on blues cruises and at festivals, and he never fails to deliver honest, soulful music that seems to come from deep inside him, where the spirit of his music lives.\n\nNow, on his brand-new album, “Fine By Me,” Salgado is once again delivering a palette of songs that reflect his musical sensibilities — which indeed run wide and deep. But sometimes the artist says it best, and here’s how Salgado describes this session in the album notes:\n\n“Hello Music Lover, What you are holding in your hand is my latest batch of songs. When I write a song, it is made from all the musical influences that I grew up with, so it’s American music. Gospel is the mothership, and the rest of it follows: blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, funk, soul, rock ‘n’ roll. I love and respect ALL of it. The music on this recording was created with the help of my friends and musicians. I admire them all greatly and I am blessed to have them in my life. The heart of my life is music; it has the power to break through the daily absurdities of our world.”\n\nNow I really like what he says there at the end, how music has the “power to break through the absurdities of the world.” And that can definitely make those absurdities a little easier to deal with, if only for a little while. “Fine By Me” reflects that, with nine of eleven songs that bear Salgado’s name, and two sturdy covers that share those sensibilities.\n\nAs if to demonstrate his musical eclecticism right from the start, Salgado opens the session with the whimsical “My Girl’s A Nut,” with its near-country twang and loping rhythm. A kicky horn section brings in “Better Things to Lie About,” with its clever lyrical wordplay and sizzling Salgado harp work, plus vocals that step up and out front.\n\n“I’m Gonna Forget About You,” the first cover, is classic O.V. Wright soul. Salgado and Robert Cray reprise their 1980 hookup on Cray’s first album with Salgado backup vocals. This time Salgado takes the lead, while Cray adds guitar and harmonizing vocals. It’s a soul brothers’ tour de force. It’s damn good, too!\n\nThe title track pushes out with a tough rocking backbeat and a lyric built around a Salgado dream about having lunch with Jackie Onassis. It’s another magical tale from Salgado’s seemingly endless lyrical wizardry. “Niki Hoeky” is another cover, a lighthearted Cajun-flavored rocker with more clever wordplay and Salgado’s falsetto getting a workout.\n\nSalgado’s original gospel-styled “Hear the Lonely Hearts” is richly backed by the powerful harmonies and call and response of The Sons of the Soul Revivers (brothers James, Walter, and Dwayne Morgan), standouts on many other Little Village albums. “Safe At Home” touts the virtues of being — safe at home after worldly travels.\n\n“The Big Chagrin” shuffles in on a New Orleans beat with a hearty dose of honky-tonk piano, blazing horns and Salgado harp. “The Only Way Out” tries out a little Latin rhythm, and “Cheap Stuff” is an unusual riff on thrift.\n\nThe two final cuts both feature stinging guitar by Anson Funderburgh. “You Give The Blues A Bad Name” is down-home blues that showcases Salgado’s wickedly soulful vocals, wrapped around a deep-blue, scorching guitar break. “Under New Management” is a rugged blues shuffle with more Funderburgh fun.\n\nThe album was recorded at eight different studios, with what seems like a cast of thousands joining in (complete list of musicians below). The result is a superb Salgado production (he produced), and great listening for the rest of us not invited to all those studios.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine that anyone in the blues listening world has not heard of Curtis Salgado. If you have, this is must-hear music. If you haven’t, it’s even more important that you must hear this delightful cornucopia of his music.\n\nI first heard Curtis sing this song on the 2017 Legendary Rhythm & Blues Cruise, where it was an instant hit. It’s an example of how he can masterfully mine a gem of a song from a simple premise. It’s titled “The Greatest Wish,” or as it came to be known on that cruise, “the dog song.”\n\nFrom the album: “You Give the Blues a Bad Name”\n\nTracks and many, many credits:\n\n1.

It’s a gorgeous little session of just nine songs, all original material from Brent and her musician/producer husband Bob Dowell.\n\nBut size doesn’t really matter here, with sparkling music that travels smoothly from barrelhouse boogie to bluesy ballads, all firmly in the grasp of Eden’s piano and vocals, Dowell’s bass work, Rob Updegraff on guitar, and Pat Levett on drums. It’s Brent’s first album since her 2018 holiday album, and her first studio release of new material since 2014’s “Jigsaw Heart.” It was recorded in London, far from her Greenville, Miss., roots, and very nicely turned out in just a couple of days. But everybody knows the roots of the blues are wide and deep.\n\nThe set opens with the rousing title track, driven hard by Brent’s rollicking barrelhouse piano intro and sassy vocals as she sets her sights on the open road at the end of a broken romance, all highlighted by a nicely stinging guitar break from Updegraff (the first of many in the set).\n\nAn album highlight is the 61/2-minute languorous blues of “Watch the World Go By,” a torchy ode to lost love powered by a duet of sumptuous piano and sultry vocals as Brent laments: “Let me pour a little whiskey/And watch the world go by.” It’s a perfect late-night, slow-burning blues, with more elegant guitar notes.\n\n“What You Want” bounces eagerly back with the slyly salacious “I’ll give you anything and everything/Baby, tell me what you want” with its percussive rhythms and still more dancing guitar. “You On My Mind,” another passionate ballad follows, this time it’s a love poem written by Dowell featuring Brent’s moving vocals accentuated by a lovely lyrical guitar: “Nothing else matters as long as you’re around.”\n\n“He Talks About You” follows, an upbeat, rhythmic tale whose bubbly feel underlines the idea that “I am resigned to be the other woman” who “Can not lose what I ain’t got,” and then a New Orleans piano vibe introduces the lilting melody of “Just Because I Love You.”\n\n“Mississippi River Got Me Crying” is a sweetly sung ballad flowing around Brent’s dusky vocals before “Rust” takes a slow-burning blues turn where rust can’t stop a freight train, but has a more metaphorical power: “My man don’t ever leave me / sticks to me just like rust.” The closer is the slinky, auto-erotic “Gas Pumping Man,” fueled by a razor-sharp guitar solo, in praise of “my high-octane baby.”\n\nWith the effervescent “Getaway Blues,” Eden Brent has taken us down home with music that’s not really a getaway, but a step back into the spirited world of piano blues and earthy vocals.\n\nWhat you’ll want while you listen, and you should, is another pour of whiskey to listen to this fine music roll on.\n\n“Getaway Blues”\n\nTrack List\n\nGetaway Blues\n\nWatch The World Go By\n\nWhat You Want\n\nYou On My Mind\n\nHe Talks About You\n\nJust Because I Love You\n\nMississippi River Got Me Crying\n\nRust\n\nGas Pumping Man\n\nRev. Freakchild — “Bare Bones” — Treated and Released Records\n\nThe most Reverend Freakchild opens his latest and 18th album, “Bare Bones,” by offering the philosophical track “All I Got Is Now,” with a lyric that sets the tone for the musical thoughts that follow – an exercise in bluesy Buddhism and other mystical delights:\n\n“Yesterdays are history / Tomorrows are a mystery / All I got is now / But I keep forgetting that somehow.”\n\nBut that’s just a fraction of the lyrical output on “Bare Bones,” all of which springs from the fertile Freakchild mind, which seems unceasingly occupied by erudite elucidations of the mysteries of life through music. The magical mystery tours of his lyrics easily flow from the delicate to the desolate, but never fail to fascinate.\n\nThe Rev has said that he’s a Buddhist, but considers music his religion. Both the blues and Buddhism, he says, can be seen as ways of confronting reality and the truth of human suffering: “I seek transcendence through song.” If you add that the blues is a healer, you might have just the right medicine for the hole in your soul.\n\nFor this “Bare Bones” transcendence, the Rev has reprised the nine tracks on his 2023 album, “Songs Of Beauty For Ashes Of Realization,” and pared back its more experimental musical vibe to a solo acoustic effort. The session was recorded live with no edits at the Chattanooga Public Library Studios, making it as close as possible to a musical stream of consciousness.\n\nFollowing the opening track, “Dial It In” takes us on the road, humming with song: “Gonna drive ’til I get lost and found again / Gonna turn on the radio and dial it in.” The Rev’s raspy vocals add a world-weary elegance here and everywhere, fueled by his sharp acoustic work, all nicely flavored with the blues.\n\nThe introspective “All Across America” asks: “Is that me in the mirror, oh lord, what have I become / Yes I do believe that’s the dude that I’ve been running from.” The shuffling whimsy of “Hippy Bluesman Blues” laments a bad Frisco trip: “There ain’t no problems only solutions / I think I’m gonna join the revolution / I got the Hippie Bluesman Blues.”\n\n“Amsterdam Blues” is twice reprised, having first appeared on the Rev’s 2001 debut album, “Blues & Spirituals.” He makes a spiritual journey for secular pleasures: “Just grooving there in Amsterdam, trying to get my senses satisfied / Sex and smoke everywhere, think you went to heaven and died.” The guitar work could easily just have arrived from the Delta.\n\n“Tears Of Fire” offers a melancholy message to rhythmic guitar: “She got words in her hand / Well it seems like she’s always got her tongue wrapped around the name of another man.” “Skyflower” is as delicate as its name: “Now I’m secretly sending magic mettā with my mind / The wind blows around the edges of the wise and the kind.”\n\nFor Freakchild fans and would-be aficionados, there’s a second album in this package, aptly titled “Odds, Ends & Interviews,” filled precisely with odds, ends and interviews that may help expand your awareness of the consciousness of the Reverend Freakchild.\n\nAnd by the way: Just who is the Reverend Freakchild? Just ask him:\n\n“When folks ask me if I’m a real reverend I often say that the Reverend Freakchild character is really a philosophical investigation of the American experience through the music of the blues and spirituals.”\n\nSay amen, somebody.\n\n“All I Got Is Now” from the album:\n\nCD 1 (The music)\n\n01.
