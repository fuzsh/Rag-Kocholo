        "text": "Ms. Jody –A Night To Remember (ECKO)– Ms. Jody “Joanne Vertie Delapaz”, daughter of a Minister, grew up singing in her father’s Church. After her Father passed away, Ms. Jody gave up singing until 2006 when she was pushed by a friend to make a demo CD and presented it to ECKO Records where she was welcomed with open arms. She has such an amazing voice! She has now put out 10 albums for ECKO and tours regularly through out the US. I would consider this more Soul than Blues, would love to hear her sing a classic Blues song. The closest for me to this is “The Best Cat Won”, a slow ballad in the vein of Etta James. Her writing is really good, with funny/sassy lyrics like her masterpiece “Burger King”. Lots of good stuff here, but I think my favorite is the last song on this CD “I’d Rather Wait Till He’s Hittin’ It”. listen here. I will probably give this a 7 on Blues Content and a 9 on Music Content.\n\nChickenbone Slim – Damn Good And Ready (Vizztone)– Chickenbone Slim is an original Blues/American international touring artist based in San Diego, California. Signed in 2021 to blues label Vizztone Records, Chickenbone garnered wide attention with his release “Serve It To Me Hot”, which reached #4 on the Living Blues Charts and won the 2022 San Diego Music Award for “Best Jazz/Blues Recording”. Slim goes from Country in “High Ballin’ Train” to West Coast Jazz “Let’s Go Lindy” to “Drink Me”, a high energy Texas Blues feel, and that is the first 3 songs!! His band, The Biscuits, are a four piece band, featuring Laura Chavez (Candy Kane), the 2023 winner for Best Blues Guitarist at the Blues Music Awards (nominated 5 times), Marty Dodson (Kim Wilson, Mark Hummel) on drums and 21 year old prodigy Justice Guevera on bass to round out the lineup, with Chickenbone on guitar and vocals. This is a fun album to drive to, great backup band and good lyrics through out. I think my favorite is the title song “Damn Good and Ready”, reminds me of Jimmy Vaughan. listen here. I will probably give this a 9 on Blues Content and a 9 on Music Content.\n\nBob Corritone – Somebody Put Bad Luck On Me (Vizztone)–Somebody Put Bad Luck On Me is Bob Corritore’s latest masterpiece collection of newly recorded songs featuring a spectacular offering of today’s top blues artists. Bob’s brilliant harmonica work is the connecting thread, always serving the song. Guest vocalists include Bobby Rush, Thornetta Davis, John Primer, Carl Weathersby, Johnny Rawls, Francine Reed, Oscar Wilson, Eugene Hideaway Bridges, Tia Carroll, Diunna Greenleaf, Willie Buck, Jimi Primetime Smith, Sugaray Rayford, and Lurrie Bell. Just a splended collection of Blue that already feels like a classic album. First song on the album is featuring John Primer on vocals, “This Little Voice”, so good. The two songs that Thornetta Davis are amazing, “I need A Whole Lotta Lovin’ and “Remember Me”. “I’m Good As Gone” has Bobby Rush singing some super down home Blues. I think my favorite on this CD is “I Want To Be Loved” with Tia Carroll on vocals. I couldn’t find any of this album on Youtube yet, so here is a great song live with Henry Gray, Bob Corritore & Bob Margolin, listen here. I will probably give this a 10+ on Blues Content and a 10+ on Music Content.\n\nLittle G Weevile – If I May Greaseland (Gee Wee)– Little G Weevil was the solo winner of the Blues Foundation`s International Blues Challenge in 2013, and has been nominated for USA Blues Music Award, Blues Blast Music Award and Independent Blues Award. He has released nine internationally acclaimed albums and performed across the US, Canada and Europe. Little G was born with a soul for adventure. Growing up in the suburb of Budapest, Hungary during the Soviet occupation, his approach to life was always slightly different from others around him. His lyrics are solid and his Blues is filled with energy and feeling. Little G Weevil is on guitar and Vocals, KC Brown on Blues Harp, Csaba Pengo on Upright Bass, Mr. Jambalya on Piano and Tom Kiss on Drums. “Spy Balloon Blues” is a great piano tune and “One Last Time” a cool syncopated tune with strong vocal and lead guitar sprinkled through out. “Doctor Hay” is a great swing tune, followed by “Tribal Affairs” a strong guitar riff setting the pace through out the song. I think my favorite on this CD “Scam me, Scam Me Not”. listen here. I will probably give this a 10 on Blues Content and a 10 on Music Content."
