Featuring performances by his musical friends and heroes Bob Margolin, Bob Corritore, and Phillip Paul (King Records drummer).  Listening to this album, you start to think that Levin is the product of decades of long nights in dark clubs and smoky juke joints.  He has that sound, a mature perspective that comes from totally immersing yourself in the music until it permeates the deepest recesses of your soul. The reality is that Ben is just finishing his first year of college. But, make no mistake his musical apprenticeship is over. The joy he feels for the music radiates from every track, and his skillful presentation will keep you coming back for more.",
