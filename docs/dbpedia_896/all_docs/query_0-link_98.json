The Blues Brothers went on to release a \"Briefcase Full of Blues\" in 1978. The \"Blues Brothers\" movie was released in 1980.\n\n\"The Blues Brothers\" now joins \"The Passion of Christ\" and \"The Ten Commandments,\" as being a movie with the Catholic seal of approval.\n\nIH MISSISSIPPI VALLEY BLUES FESTIVAL\n\nAre you attending the 26th annual IH Mississippi Valley Blues Festival over the Fourth of July weekend?

Jackson, a Tupelo, Miss., native, grew up inspired by Elvis songs and comic books, according to his website. Jackson's unique style of writing, recording and performing portrays songs about romance and broken hearts.

He is currently working on his Roadrunner/Loud & Proud debut projects, which include his first live album and a new studio album.\n\nKenny Wayne is a special artist stated Loud & Proud President Tom Lipsky. He is passionate about his songwriting, his musicianship and he values the relationship that he has with his fans.\n\nShepherd himself said, I am both excited and proud to be a part of the Roadrunner/Loud & Proud family. We have some very exciting music coming for our fans, and I couldnt think of a better home for my music. Ive been playing it loud and proud for years.\n\nWidely regarded as a guitar hero before that term exploded into pop culture with the video game, the self-taught Shepherd learned to play at the tender age of seven-years-old, learning Muddy Waters licks while listening to his fathers record collection. At 13, he was invited onstage and performed with New Orleans bluesman Bryan Lee. Signed to Giant Records at 16, Shepherd recorded his first album while a senior in high school.\n\nIn 1997, Kenny was ranked third in Guitar Worlds list of favorite blues artists behind legends B.B. King and Eric Clapton. He has enjoyed two platinum and one gold albums, six Top 10 singles and his album Trouble Is holds the distinction of being the longest running album on the Billboard Blues Charts. It held strong at #1 for 20 weeks including 15 weeks consecutively. The hit single Blue on Black was also a record-breaker, #1 for 17 consecutive weeks at rock radio.\n\nShepherds decorated career includes four Grammy nominations, two Billboard Music Awards, two Orville Gibson Awards, the Blues Foundations Keeping the Blues Alive Award and a Blues Music Award. In September 2008 Fender released the Kenny Wayne Shepherd Signature Series Stratocaster, designed exclusively by Shepherd. The inimitable James Brown referred to him as one of the wonders of the world.\n\nHis most recent release, 2007s #1 selling Blues Album 10 Days Out: Blues from the Backroads, documents Shepherd as he travels the country to jam with and interview the last of the authentic blues musicians. This full length CD/DVD documentary was nominated for two Grammys, aired on PBS television nationwide and has been certified RIAA Gold as a Long Form Video.\n\nBlues Rule in Hill Country\n\nFor the past five years, a desolate field in Potts Camp has been the location of one the rawest and purest blues festivals in the South - the North Mississippi Hill Country Picnic.\n\nPacked with 22 performers over two days, the festival begins Friday.\n\nAnd once again, the spirit of the world-famous Hill Country Blues will come alive with performers such as DuWayne Burnside, Kenny Brown, Robert Belfour, Jimbo Mathus, North Mississippi Allstars, Cedric Burnside and Lightnin' Malcolm, T Model Ford and Rising Star Fife and Drum Band.\n\nAll of the performers have some kind of connection to the legendary Hill Country musical roots, and many have a family tie to legendary Hill Country musicians R.L. Burnside, Junior Kimbrough and Otha Turner.\n\nFestival director and co-founder Sarah Davis started the picnic with her husband, bluesman and festival performer Kenny Brown.\n\n\"Since Kenny plays all over the world, we never get to see the performers that live close to home, so we came up with the idea of having a festival here that was totally devoted to North Mississippi Hill Country Blues,\" Davis said.\n\nIt has since turned into a Southern tradition for some, and a musical pilgrimage for others.\n\n\"We have over 30 people from Norway coming. We have people from 31 different states and seven different countries,\" Davis said.\n\nThe Hill Country music made famous by musicians such as R.L. Burnside, Junior Kimbrough and Otha Turner is now carried on by their children and grandchildren.\n\n\"The thing that makes it special to me is that it's more of a family reunion than a festival,\" Davis said. \"All the families are there; the musicians all know each other and spend the weekend together. There are set times but somebody will always wind up playing with one another, and the fans have now become family also.\"\n\nFestival performer and fellow Mississippi bluesman Jimbo Mathus agrees.\n\n\"It's really like a reunion, like those picnics were supposed to be in the Hill Country,\" Mathus said. \"It really brings all of us musicians together and even people in the audience. I see people at the picnic that I see all over the country, so it really has a reunion feel. Just bring plenty of ice.\"\n\nThe location in itself is an experience; the sweltering heat in the middle of nowhere depicts a true representation of Mississippi blues.\n\nA small stream runs to the left side of the stage, where there is a shaded area for the audience, and with on-site camping available for today through Saturday night, the picnic can double as a mini vacation.\n\n\"It really keeps alive the spirit of the Hill Country blues that was really personified by guys like R.L. Burnside, Junior Kimbrough and Otha Turner,\" said Blue Mountain guitarist and festival performer Cary Hudson. \"It's reminiscent of the picnics Otha Turner would have. With their kids playing there, it really keeps alive the spirit of the juke joint and it gives those families a place to come together and honor their ancestors.\"\n\nTickets are $25 per day, and camping is $25.

(Josh Rogosin/Marketplace)\n\nTess Vigeland sits down with Bruce Iglauer, founder of Alligator Records, and talks about blues music that talks about unemployment.\n\nAnd finally as we wrap up our week in Chicago, we couldn't leave without a nod to one of this city's greatest cultural contributions: The blues, and what that music might say about our subject of job loss. So we made a pilgrimage to Alligator Records, an independent recording label that's released more than 250 blues and blues/rock albums, from such legends as Koko Taylor, Robert Cray and Buddy Guy. We caught up with the label's founder in the midst of a busy week.\n\nVigeland: Bruce Iglauer, so nice to be chat with you. Thanks for inviting us into your office here.\n\nIglauer: I'm glad to have you. Thanks.\n\nVigeland: Now, we asked you to send us some blues songs in preparation for this conversation. And I'd like to start with a Chicago native, John Brim and his song \"Tough Times.\"\n\nJohn Brim, singing:I'm broke and disgustin' and in misery. Can't find a part-time job, nothing in my house to eat. Tough times...\n\nVigeland: So there you go, right there. You don't have a job. It was pretty common to be out of work in the 40s, 50s and 60s, especially if you were a black man in America. This song is a reflection of that?\n\nIglauer: This was actually recorded in 1953, which was one of the many recessions we had during the 1950s. And yeah, a lot of black people in Chicago, and of course, elsewhere, were working hard labor jobs, some of them for cash, which would mean no benefits, no unemployment. So when the economy got tight, jobs got lost and people were scared.\n\nVigeland: And that's something fairly easy to make music out of, isn't it? Misery?\n\nIglauer: You know, the blues isn't all about misery. The blues is really designed to help you get through your misery. They say in Chicago, you listen to the blues to get rid of the blues.\n\nVigeland: Now there were obviously a lot of prominent women blues singers and musicians. I think this is one that a lot of folks have heard of, Bessie Smith recorded this song, \"Nobody knows you when you're down and out\" in the 1920s.\n\nBessie Smith, singing:In my pocket, not one penny. And my friends, I haven't any...\n\nVigeland: So she's talking there about \"in my pocket, one penny.\" That's tough.\n\nIglauer: You know, a lot of blues artists really still live kind of day-to-day and week-to-week. You know, playing for cash, living in rental places, because they can't get credit to buy a house. Being a blues artist is a hard life, but it's also something you do to avoid being unemployed. Unemployment in the black community is a huge problem, obviously much bigger than in the white community, and it continues.\n\nVigeland: Was it something that musicians talked about outside of the music that they were making?\n\nIglauer: In the black community, amongst the musicians and amongst the fans, unemployment was so common that it wasn't always talked about. But you know, everybody had a hustle, everybody had a way of putting cash in their pocket. In fact, there's another song that we picked for this show from the early 50s, T-Bone Walker's \"The Hustle is on,\" which is exactly about that subject.\n\nVigeland: Let's take a listen to that.\n\nT-Bone Walker, singing:Yes, time is hard, baby. And hustlin' is really on. Prices are high, darlin', all the good jobs are gone.\n\nVigeland: Well, that's an awfully upbeat job loss song, unemployment song.\n\nIglauer: Well, you're going to have to dance your unemployment away.\n\nVigeland: I want to ask you how this is playing out now. Obviously, blues artists must be watching and experiencing what's going on in our economy right now. What are they singing about?\n\nIglauer: When President Obama was elected to office, there was a great deal of excitement. But when the economy kept turning sour, there've been artists who have been complaining very clearly about that subject and feeling like many of us that maybe some of the government help should be going not just to banks, but to the average working man or working woman. So, Guitar Shorty recently cut a song on exactly that subject.\n\nGuitar Shorty, singing: Please, Mr. President, lay some stimulus on me, 'cause I'm just a workin' man trying to feed my family.\n\nVigeland: Wow, yeah, he's really asking for his own financial bail out there and speaking to the president from right here in this city.\n\nIglauer: Yeah, and I think he's feeling the president oughta be listening.\n\nVigeland: Bruce Iglauer is the president and founder of Alligator Records, the for 40-year-old, Chicago-based independent blues record label. It's been awfully fun having a chat with you. Thanks so much.\n\nIglauer: Thank you. Thanks for inviting me.\n\nSARASOTA BLUES FESTIVAL\n\nThe 20th ANNUAL\n\nSarasota Bluesfest\n\nCOME FOOL AROUND & FALL IN LOVE with\n\nELVIN BISHOP\n\nSATURDAY * NOVEMBER 6TH\n\nED SMITH STADIUM\n\nTROMBONE SHORTY & ORLEANS AVENUE\n\nTHE TOMMY CASTRO BAND\n\nMORELAND & ARBUCKLE\n\nALLSTARS * JAKE HALDENWANG\n\nGates: 11AM * Food, Beer & Wine, Refreshments * Crafts * Rain or Shine\n\nBlankets & Lawn Chairs Welcome * No Coolers, Pets, Glass, Video Cameras, Refunds\n\nTickets On Sale July 31st:\n\nwww.sarasotabluesfest.com/ * Five OClock Club (941 366-5555)\n\nRossiter's & Manatee River Harley-Davidson (941 951-6103), (941 745-2429)\n\n$22 Advance * $27 Day of Show * FREE PARKING * ALL KIDS FREE WITH ADULT\n\nPartial Proceeds to Benefit All Faiths Food Bank\n\nPINETOP PERKINS FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES FIRST ANNUAL YOUTH WORKSHOP SERIES AND CONCERT\n\nPINETOP PERKINS TO MAKE SPECIAL APPEARANCE\n\nANN RABSON, EDEN BRENT & BOB MARGOLIN\n\nTO PARTICIPATE\n\nThe Pinetop Perkins Foundation is pleased to announce the first Annual Youth Workshop Series: Piano Master Class to be held August 3, 2010 - Aug 4, 2010 at the historic Shack Up Inn and Hopson Plantation in Clarksdale, Mississippi.
