        "text": "Blues Underground Network (March 2012)\n\nTail Dragger & Bob Corritore’s first meeting was on January 11, 1976, which took place at the 1815 Club in Chicago. They both performed that night as part of a tribute to the Legendary Howlin’ Wolf, whom had passed away the day before. That meeting forged, from that day on, both a lifetime friendship and a great musical collaboration.\n\nBob Corritore has been “a lifelong advocate of the blues who continues to play an active role in promoting the music by helping it flourish into the 21st century through his many endeavors“. Of his critically acclaimed hailed release, “Harmonica Blues”, I wrote, “Their are Blues Albums out their that are absolutely essential to have in one’s collection, and Bob Corritore And Friends “Harmonica Blues” is certainly one of them“. Bob is a Club Owner, Record Producer, Band Leader, and Radio Host, and with each year that passes, his ascent to Legendary status becomes that much shorter.\n\nThe fact that Tail Dragger, who’s real name is James Yancy Jones, was at Howlin’ Wolf’s Tribute, should come as no surprise, as for more than 20 years he followed Wolf from club to club, watching and getting pointers from the larger-then-life Legend. Besides letting Tail Dragger perform his blues in between sets on the weekends, Howlin Wolf also gave Tail Dragger his moniker, which was due to “his reputation of showing up late for gigs“. Many still feel that Tail Dragger’s delivery is quite reminiscent of Howlin’ Wolf, something that is abundantly clear after only listening to his and Bob Corritore’s new release “Longtime Friends In The Blues”, for just a few seconds. In fact Howlin’ Wolf once said “One day this boy (Tail Dragger) will take my place .”\n\nIn addition to Tail Dragger (Vocals) & Bob Corritore (Harmonica), “Longtime Friends In The Blues” features Kirk Fletcher (Guitar), Chris James (Guitar), Patrick Rynn (Bass), Brian Fahey (Drums) and Henry Gray (Piano/Vocals on Track 2/Comments on Track 9 & 10). “In 1956, Howlin’ Wolf asked Henry to join his band. Henry did and remained Wolf’s main piano player until 1968 .”\n\nHowlin’ Wolf’s influence becomes apparent on “Longtime Friends In The Blues”, after only a few short seconds into the album, as Tail Dragger blasts out the words, “I’m Worried, Babe I’m Worried About You”. From that moment on the band jumps in and takes us for one heck of a great Chicago Style Blues ride.\n\nTrack 2 is the John Lee Williamson (Sonny Boy Williamson) cover ‘Sugar Mama’ which is introduced via Bob Corritore on Harmonica, of which he wails on throughout this great interpretation. Henry Gray steps in with Vocals on this Track, as Tail Dragger and him share lyrics and although it was still early in the Album, I had a feeling this was going to be one of my favorites.\n\nAnother early favorite was Track 3 ‘Birthday Blues’, which was one of a half dozen Tracks of the up tempo nature. This was a great Track with everyone noticeable giving their all.\n\nTrack 6 ‘So Ezee’, is exactly that, So Ezee to listen to. Lots of Corritore once again driving thru this one on his Harp, along with great Guitar work from James and Fletcher, as Henry pounded away on the Piano. A great Track indeed.\n\nSpeaking of pounding the Piano, Henry Gray, takes center stage and goes all Boogie Woogie Blues on the keys on Track 9 ‘Boogie Woogie Ball’ and certainly shows us that even at the young age of 87, he is still second to none with performers half his age.\n\n“Longtime Friends In The Blues” finishes off with the longest Track on the album, ‘Please Mr. Jailer’, a song that has Tail Dragger begging the jailer to please have mercy on his girl. Another great performance by all especially Tail Dragger and Bob Corritore and a nice song to end “Longtime Friends In The Blues”.\n\n“Longtime Friends In The Blues” is yet another rock solid Chicago Style Blues Album, but really, when you consider who was involved on this one, it could not have come out any other way. Great Vocal work from Tail Dragger, second to none Harp from Bob Corritore, plus the outstanding performances from Henry, Kirk, Chris, Patrick, and Brian, make “Longtime Friends In The Blues” a real winner.\n\nLots of great stuff on this one…"
