        "text": "Description\n\nThis very special installment of Bob Corritores From the Vaults series features great recordings from spectacular blues women from a wide geographic and stylistic spectrum. Featured vocalists include: hit making Gulf Coast legends Barbara Lynn and Carol Fran; Chicago Blues legend Koko Taylor, well known as the Queen Of The Blues; Phoenixs soul/blues/gospel diva Francine Reed; vocal powerhouse Diunna Greenleaf from Houston Texas; the gentle wonderment of Tennessees rising Americana star Valerie June; Mississippis Shy Perry whose deceptive name and stature deliver a powerhouse Wang Dang Doodle; and Aliya Primer, the daughter of Chicago blues great John Primer, with her very first recording done with great authority at age 17!\n\nBob Corritore has recorded all these wonderful woman artists with great sensitivity to their stylistic and personal indivuality! Behold a collection of spectacular female voices, which collectively demonstrate both the undeniable power and empowering vulnerability of the feminine voice."
