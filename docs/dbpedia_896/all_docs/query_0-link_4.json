        "text": "Welcome to the 2022 version of Daveâs Top Ten List of Top Ten Lists.\n\nHere as part of our annual âBest ofâ¦â edition of BLUES JUNCTION, we continue our tradition of bringing you the top ten blues albums of the year, as submitted by ten individuals who have been part of the blues scene for many years.\n\nThis feature remains one of my favorite projects that I work on each year. In pulling together this annual celebration of achievement in the blues recording field, I get a chance to interact with other like-minded individuals who share my love and passion for this music.\n\nThe one thing each has in common with the others is that they are true listeners, connoisseurs, and lovers of the music.\n\nWe have participants coming from four separate continents and as many countries. In the U.S. we have participants from all over this country. I canât think of a better testimonial to the long-held notion that blues is an international language.\n\nMy question to them was simple: âWhat are your ten favorite blues albums of 2022?â\n\nHow we do things around here is pretty simple. The only criteria for these recordings are that they must be made up of new recordings which was released in the calendar year of 2022. They also must be available in a physical format. CD and/or vinylâ¦The lists are presented in alphabetical order.\n\nNow, the fun part is hearing from you, our readers, and your thoughts on any or all of this. What is your favorite blues album(s) of 2022?ï»¿\n\nDerral Alexander Campbell - Redding, California (USA)\n\nLetâs let Derral tell his own story. âI got the blues bug when I saw Junior Wells at the Fillmore in December of '66, with Buddy Guy, Otis Spann, Jack Myers, Fred Below and A.C. Reed.â Yeah, that would do it. Derral goes on to say, âI went to the first San Francisco Blues Festival in 1973 to hear my eventual namesake, L.C. \"Good Rockin\" Robinson, but I became a logger and didn't come back to the city until 1982, when Little Charlie and the Nightcats knocked me out. By '86 I was back at Humboldt State and on the air for KHSU. I've been steady at it since then, in Humboldt and Shasta Counties, on commercial and public radio. I'm very thankful to be able to share the music that resonates with me and proud to have this connection to the blues.â After years of correspondence from either end of California, Derral and I finally crossed paths in person last fall when I attended the Redwood Coast Music Festival in his hometown of Eureka, California.\n\nDiunna Greenleaf - I Ain't Playin'\n\nTrudy Lynn - Golden Girl\n\nLovelight Orchestra - Leave the Light On\n\nCharlie Musselwhite - Mississippi Son\n\nAnthony Geraci - Blues Called My Name\n\nThe Phantom Blues Band - Blues for Breakfast\n\nSilent Partners - Changing Times\n\nBob Corritore & Friends - You Shocked Me\n\nJohn Primer - The Hard Way\n\nGary Smith Blues Band - Live at the Poor House Bistro\n\nÂ\n\nChico Blues - Sao Paulo, Brazil Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nI first became aware of Chico in 2007, when Lynwood Slim told me about this cat from Brazil who was hip to the blues. Even though I donât speak Portuguese, Chicoâs native tongue, we speak the same language of music. He was interviewed here in BLUES JUNCTION way back in 2011, with the help of his daughter. We first met in person a couple of years later when he joined The Igor Prado Band on a tour of Southern California where they backed up Lynwood Slim. Chico is the founder and president ofÂ Chico Blues RecordsÂ out of Sao Paulo, Brazil. He is widely recognized as the leading blues authority in South America. His label and extensive roster of artists has continued to produce some of the finest blues recordings in recent years. Some of the most renowned blues musicians in the world have traveled to Brazil to record with the numerous world class blues players on his own label.\n\nBob Corritore & Friends - You Shocked Me Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nDiunna Greenleaf - I Ain't Playin'Â\n\nBuddy Guy - The Blues Don't Lie\n\nMartin Lang & Rusty Zinn - Mr. Blues, Mr. Blues\n\nLarry McCray - Blues Without You\n\nTaj Mahal & Ry Cooder â Get On The Board\n\nCharlie Musselwhite - Mississippi Son\n\nJohn NÃ©meth - May Be the Last Time\n\nJohn Primer -Hard Times\n\nBob Stroger & The Headcutters - That's My Name\n\nÂ\n\nDon âT- Boneâ Erickson - Des Moines, Iowa (USA)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nDon is a long-time blues journalist. Back in the early 2000s he was a founding editor of one of the first online blues journals entitledÂ BluesWax. It is where I first became aware of his work in the blues field. Â He is the former editor for the Central Iowa Blues Society Newsletter and author of 76 monthly feature articles entitled Legends of the Blues. Don is the host ofÂ T-Bone's House Rockin' Blues PartyÂ andÂ The Groove ZoneÂ at KFMG 98.9 FM, Des Moines (see our links page). His program is featured on the station rated âBest Radio Stationâ in Cityviewâs âBest of Des Moinesâ reader's survey for the last several years. T-Bone continues to garner recognition for his broadcasts. Don also served as the Chairman of the Iowa Blues Hall of Fame for 15 years. He has been an occasional contributor to BLUES JUNCTION and has participated with this feature since its inception a few years ago.\n\nBig Creek Slim & Rodrigo Mantovani - Stone In My Heart\n\nBlue Moon Marquee - Scream, Holler & Howl\n\nNathan James - I May Crawl\n\nRon Kraemer Trio w/the Nashville Cats - Sarasota Swing\n\nLil' Red & the Rooster - Keep On!\n\nYates McKendree - Buchanan Lane\n\nMikey Junior - Mikey Junior's South Philly Blues Party Live!\n\nJohn Nemeth - May Be The Last Time\n\nThe Duke Robillard Band - They Called it Rhythm & Blues\n\nThe Wicked Lo-Down - We Hot\n\nÂ\n\nJeff Scott Fleenor - Garden Grove, California (USA)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nI first met Jeff when I returned to California after living abroad (Texas) for twelve years. This was in the mid-90âs and by then he was already developing a fairly sophisticated aural palette. In those intervening twenty-five years Jeff has become a blues historian and archivist of the highest order and is universally recognized as the worldâs leading authority on the international blues scene. He spent a decade employed by the Virgin Megastore as a Southern California Specialty Music Buyer and hosted his own radio show The Blues Disease on KUCI 88.9 FM for 15 years (1996-2011). From 2000-2003 he was involved as the talent buyer and M.C. for the prestigious Blues on the Bay Festival in Newport Beach, California, and has held a role as talent adviserÂ to the Doheny Blues Festival for 20 years. Additionally, he has written liner notes for dozens of albums, as well as produced numerous projects for Delta Groove Music, including the Mannish Boys'Â Double Dynamite, BMA winner for Traditional Blues Album of the Year. Jeff has become an invaluable resource to me, as we discuss this music for hours at a time every week of the year.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nBig Creek Slim & Rodrigo Mantovani - Stone in My Heart\n\nAl Blake - Dr. Blakeâs Magic Soul Elixir No. 2\n\nBalta Bordoy & the Bad Boys - Rock My Blues Away\n\nKurt Crandall - Starts on the Stops\n\nRick Holmstrom - Get It!\n\nNathan James - I May Crawl\n\nThe Love Light Orchestra - Leave the Light On\n\nYates McKendree - Buchanan Lane\n\nThe Duke Robillard Band - They Call It Rhythm & Blues\n\nSven Zetterberg - Rain On\n\nÂ\n\nLee âEast Side Slimâ Howland - Saint Louis, Missouri (USA)\n\nLee is a former South Dakota resident who moved to Saint Louis in 1989. It was in the historic blues hot bed of the Gateway City where he fell for the blues hard. Lee is a DJ and Programmer at KDHX 88.1 FM in Saint Louis and world-wide at kdhx.org. East Side Slim hosts a program entitledÂ Rhythm Highways. Tune in to hear blues, soul, rock ânâ rollâ¦jazz, swing and everything, including a weekly gospel set and even the occasional honky tonk and western swing (see our links page). Thanks Lee for returning to Daveâs Top Ten List of Top Ten Lists.\n\nBig Creek Slim & Rodgrigo Mantovani - Stone In My Heart\n\nBob Corritore and Friends - You Shocked Me\n\nThe Dig 3 â The Dig 3\n\nKirk Fletcher - Heartache By The Pound\n\nDiunna Greenleaf - I Ain't Playin'\n\nHowell Devine - Strange Time Blues\n\nLily Locksmith - Lily Locksmith\n\nDoug MacLeod - A Soul To Claim\n\nLarry McCray - Blues Without You\n\nVaneese Thomas - Fight The Good Fight Â\n\nÂ\n\nKen Johnson - Washington Township, New Jersey (USA) Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nI first met Ken Johnson and his wife Linda a few years ago in a coffee shop in Dana Point, California. We were directly across the street from the site of the Doheny Blues Festival which was scheduled to take place in a few hours. I was having breakfast with David Kiefer aka San Pedro Slim who was singing and blowing harp with Mark Mumea (g/v) and Jerry Carega (b) of the Silver Kings at the festival. Â Ken walked by our table and introduced himself and knew David, Mark and Jerry by name. He told us he was from Baltimore (his home at the time) and was in California to attend the festival. I reached out my hand to introduce myself. Ken interrupted me and with a broad smile said âI know you Dave and know these guys because of you and BLUES JUNCTIONâ. Needless to say, Ken, his wife Linda and myself remain friends. They have since gotten to know Tracy and we get together when they come to California. Ken remains a loyal subscriber to BLUES JUNCTION and is a true friend of the blues.\n\nBig Creek Slim & Rodrigo Mantovani - Stone In My Heart\n\nBob Corritore & Friends â You Shocked Me\n\nRick Holmstrom â Get It!\n\nMartin Lang & Rusty Zinn â Mr. Blues, Mr. Blues\n\nTomi Leino â Play That Thing\n\nMike Morgan & The Crawl â The Lights Went Out in Dallas\n\nCharlie Musselwhite â Mississippi Sun\n\nJohn Nemeth â May be the Last Time\n\nJohn Primer â Hard Times\n\nDuke Robillard â They Called It Rhythm & Blues\n\nÂ\n\nMichael Kinsman - Memphis, Tennessee (USA) Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nI first met Michael at a private event for which he was largely responsible. He assembled young music students from the San Diego area who wanted to learn to play blues music. He put together a band with Scottie Blinn who lent his home to host this tutorial. Guitarist Anson Funderburgh flew out from Texas to perform, visit with the kids and share with them some pointers he has accumulated in a lifetime of playing blues music at the highest level. For more than three decades, Michael has written about blues and roots music for various publications, including the San Diego Union-Tribune newspaper, Blues Revue Magazine, Blues Music Magazine and VH1.com. He has interviewed more than 500 roots and blues music artists and written more than 800 hundred CD reviews. He is the founder and producer of theÂ San Diego Blues Festival, which had emerged as one of the premier blues festivals in the country. He now resides in Memphis. Michael and I remain good friends. I cherish those evenings after his San Diego Blues Festival where after parties included kicking back with Michael (a world class raconteur) in a hotel room. Those stories would go on âtil all hours of the morning.\n\nKirk Fletcher - Heartache By The Pound\n\nGA-20 - Crackdown\n\nDiunna Greenleaf -I Ain't Playin'\n\nDashawn Hickman - Drums, Roots & Steel\n\nDave Keyes - Rhythm Blues & Boogie\n\nDoug MacLeod - A Soul To Claim\n\nCharlie Musselwhite - Mississippi Son\n\nJohn Nemeth - May Be The Last Time\n\nJohnny Sansone - Into Your Blues\n\nSilent Partners - Changing Times\n\nÂ\n\nCraig Lawrence - Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nCraig is a native of Perth.
