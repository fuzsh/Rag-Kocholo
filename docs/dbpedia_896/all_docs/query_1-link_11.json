        "text": "Sonny Boy Williamson II\n\nPerhaps capitalizing on the earlier fame of John Lee “Sonny Boy” Williamson, there emerged Alec “Rice” Miller who also used the moniker Sonny Boy Williamson. To differentiate people will often refer to Miller as Sonny Boy Williamson II. Sonny Boy II was no cheap imitator, he was also a brilliant and trendsetting harmonica player with a style and phrasing all his own. He also possessed a poetic quality of songwriting filled with rich imagery and catchy, folksy sayings and an emotion-laden voice with which to deliver those songs. Early in his career he made daily broadcasts with KFFA for King Biscuit Flour which pioneered blues music onto the radio. His early recordings with Mississippi’s Trumpet Records were followed by a prolific hit making run with Chicago’s famed Chess Records. In the later years Sonny Boy Williamson II found a great audience in Europe and recorded as a free-agent for numerous Euro labels and often comingled with British rock bands including the Yardbirds featuring a young Eric Clapton. These great photos come to us courtesy of Sonny Burnett, a true enthusiast on the subject of Sonny Boy Williamson II.\n\nThe earliest known image of Alex or Aleck ”Rice” Miller (né Ford, prior to his Sonny Boy Williamson II name) as ”Little Boy Blue” his stage name at the time in probably 1938 or 1939. The radio station WEBQ was a 50,000 watt clear channel station in Harrisburg IL (Southern IL NE of Cairo) the home of The Baptist Hour. He also had a home in Harrisburg in 1938. Note him wearing his Derby or Bowler hat around 25 years before he toured the UK and Europe.\n\nSonny Boy circa 1956. This publicity photograph was taken at the Hooks Brothers photography studio on Beale street, Memphis the very same studio that took the famous Robert Johnson with guitar sitting crossed legged photograph. Sonny Boy wears a WDIA radio station pin but it has never been proven if he had actually worked for them.\n\nSonny Boy Williamson studio portrait, 1955. Lillian McMurry arranged for Sonny Boy to be represented by Universal Artists toward the end of his Trumpet contract. It appears that he did at least one tour of the TOBA circuit and played the Apollo Theater in Harlem. The first tour was probably in the mid-1950s and that latter in the 1963/64 when he was home from London.\n\nSonny Boy Williamson II and Robert Lockwood Jr. 1941 By Max Moore.\n\nSonny Boy and Robert Jr Lockwood pose for a King Biscuit Time publicity shot.

Photograph by Val Wilmer.\n\nSonny Boy Williamson from early 1965 likely from backstage at the Ready Steady Go TV show. Photo by Val Wilmer.\n\nRecorded August 5, 1951 in Jackson, MS Sonny Boy his Harmonica and House Rockers (in this case the House Rockers being Willie Love or David Cambell on piano, the guitars of Elmore James and Joe Willie Wilkins, bass player Leonard Ware and an unknown drummer) produced many killer sides on their return to the studio for Trumpet Records in this one session including ”Cool, Cool Blues” which is another early example of his lyrical mastery and genius. For a man who did not want to give away details of his life, he tells all in his lyrics and Cool,Cool Blues is no exception of Sonny Boy’s fondness for getting out of his home or town and looking for some other cool, cool place to go!\n\nRecorded on the 11th Jan, 1963 in Chicago, “Help Me” would become one of the most covered and loved blues anthems and would spawn a blues harmonica phrase still widely used and loved by harmonica players today. It would also be a surprise hit for Sonny Boy on the UK Pye label the following year in Europe and would endear an already popular Sonny Boy to the UK ”Mod” scene. Sonny Boy would also claim the famous riff was his originally and not Booker T & The MG’s!\n\nPhoto by George Mitchell.\n\nSonny Boy Williamson and club compère Bob Wooler at the Cavern Club, Liverpool, UK, January 22, 1964.

Sonny Boy was paid $12.50 a week for doing the King Biscuit Time/KFFA radio show but through Max Moore setting up gigs at Juke Joints and special events as they toured the South doing their King Biscuit Time roadshow Sonny Boy could earn hundreds of dollars a week from these extra night time gigs, often playing all night and roadshow gigs during the day…so this might even have been his own car at some point.\n\nJames Cotton, Sonny Boy Williamson, Jimmy Rogers, Muddy Waters and Otis Spann in Muddy’s basement at 4339 South Lake Park Avenue, Chicago, IL in 1959.

Upon their next meeting Elmore whacked Sonny Boy over the head with a mic stand for his $50 loss…they still remained friends after.
