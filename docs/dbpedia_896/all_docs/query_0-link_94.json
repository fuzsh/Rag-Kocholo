        "text": "Hey Blues Fans,\n\nWe found lots of Blues in our own Back Yard. In Peoria, Illinois last weekend we heard three great Blues bands! (2 at different venues in the very same building.)\n\nFirst we stopped in to see local Peoria favorites Blueskillet at a weekly event called Live at the Five Spot. This gig is held in an art gallery and the show starts right after work on Fridays (5:30pm).\n\nThe gallery allows folks to bring their own food and beverages so lots of people in P-Town jump in their cars after work and grab a six pack or a bottle of wine and maybe some fruit and cheese or a subway sandwich. Then they settle in for 2 hours unwinding the work week to the music of the best Central Illinois bands.\n\nBlueskillet Band (Tadd Swanson guitar, Monica Swanson vocals, Justin Mooney drums and Dan Carroll bass) provided great fun this night playing Blues classics and a few original tunes. Don't miss them if you get to Peoria!\n\nSee all the pictures of this great event CLICK HERE\n\nWe are not usually ready to call it a night at 7:30 on Friday so we headed down one flight of stairs to the Rhythm Kitchen Restaurant which has live music starting right at 7:30pm. (How convenient is that?)\n\nAnd we were in luck this night as they were having Blues too! We finally got a chance to see a group called The Governor.\n\nGovernor Forman (Yes his name is Governor), is someone we have known as a great singer and bass player for quite some time. He formed a new trio many months ago with guitar player Randy Roth and drummer Butch Carroll.\n\nMany folks have been telling us \"you gotta see with this guitar player!\" They were right. Randy Roth is really impressive. Get out to hear them if you can!\n\nYou can check out more pictures CLICK HERE\n\nLast but not least we made it out to another Peoria event on Saturday put on By the River City Blues Society and Southside Cindy and the Sliptones. Southside Cindy (Cindy Youngren) is one of the best performers around anywhere.\n\nShe sang her heart out to a very appreciative crowd as she helped raise money for the local Blues society. Thanks for being such a huge Blues supporter Cindy! CLICK HERE to see all the fun!\n\nSean Costello April 16, 1979 - April 15, 2008 Rest in Peace\n\nWe are very sad to hear of the unexpected death of Blues rising star Sean Costello. Sean was found dead in his hotel room yesterday. Cause of death is not known at present but details will posted on the Piedmont Talent website as they are revealed. The note below is from Steve Hecht at Piedmont Talent.\n\nRemembering Sean Costello - Tuesday, April 15, 2008\n\nSean Costello was a person I was so looking forward to get to know better. He exuded positive energy every time I was with him. I cherished the opportunity to work with him over the coming years and being a part of his growth as an artist and as a person. Man, his latest cd was his best ever. The tone he coaxed out of that guitar was incredible. Every song had that Sean Costello stamp on it. Any Time You Want or Hard Luck Woman can easily be the song of the year! His guitar along with voice was never better than it has been recently. I got to see him about a month ago in Atlanta and he was firing on all cylinders despite having just finished a long grueling tour and having a new bassist that night. He was producing some of his best work ever. It just kept you longing for whatever he would do next. I will miss Sean and his youthful exuberance. His energy inspired me. He left us a great musical legacy.\n\nSteve Hecht April 15, 2008\n\nSean's Latest CD \"We Can Get Together\" was reviewed in the February 13th issue of the Blues Blast magazine. To read the review CLICK HERE Check the links below for more information as it becomes available.\n\nwww.piedmonttalent.com www.deltagrooveproductions.com\n\nLittle Arthur Duncan Hospitalized\n\nFrom the Bob Corritore Blues Newsletter - Chicago blues harmonica great Little Arthur Duncan was hospitalized on Friday, April 11, 2008. This email was sent via Rick Kreher: \"I just wanted to send you all an email to let you know that Little Arthur Duncan was rushed to the hospital earlier today and had emergency brain surgery. He is in intensive care at the University of Illinois Hospital on the West Side.\" On Saturday, www.jbcobb.net reported that \"Little Arthur Duncan underwent emergency brain surgery last night to remove a growth the size of a golf ball.\" On Sunday, Twist Turner got news from Arthur's sister that Little Arthur had opened his eyes briefly, but is still not talking. More news on this as it comes in.\n\nMORE Blues Reviews\n\nJames Walker reviews the new CD by Eden Brent. Ben Cox sends us a review of the new a CD by the Ty Curtis Band and an interview with Robin and Tony Rogers, 2005 winners of the Best Self-Produced CD from the International Blues Challenge.\n\nRob Paullin sends us a review from the Glendale Arizona Jazz and Blues Festival and Mike CATHEAD Nunn & Gary WINGMAN Weeks tell us of a great show by Chicago's own Nick Moss performing in the State of Georgia.

SCROLL DOWN!\n\nEden Brent - Mississippi Number One\n\nYellow Dog Records\n\nwww.edenbrent.com\n\n15 songs; 57:32 minutes; Suggested\n\nGenre: Piano Blues, Jazz, Rhythm & Blues, and Soul\n\nDear Skyy,\n\nWhats a guy to do? Ive got rocking pneumonia, but no boogie-woogie blues! Late last night as I was trying to get my baby comfortable, I put on a new CD that was supposed to be blues. But, it was just more rock being passed off as blues. You know, one ponderous screaming guitar solo after another just didnt strike the mood for which I was desperately searching. I was looking for...well, never mind what I was looking for. Rest assured, I didnt find it. Can you help?\n\nSincerely,\n\nLance Hardwood\n\nLance,\n\nToo bad you did not have Eden Brents debut release (second overall) on Yellow Dog Records, Mississippi Number One. Here you can find piano in the lead with nary a harsh note from accompanying guitars, harmonica, and horns. Eden Brents singing voice ranges from melancholic whisper to sultry sexy to soul wailing, and the songs vary from slow blues to jazzy bounce to gospel soul to flat out boogie-woogie. Get this CD, and youll get in the groove.\n\nSkyy\n\nMississippi born and bred (a native of Greenville MS), Eden Brent has proven her merit over and over from performing internationally to sharing a bill with BB King at the 2005 Presidential Inauguration to winning the 2006 International Blues Challenge Solo/Duo division. She is a self-described \"song interpreter,\" and her interpretations of jazz, blues, soul and pop are expressive and memorable. This album reveals she is also a gifted songwriter of her own originals. In a heady move, Dawn Hopkins of Blue Eyed Bitches Productions fame was brought in to co-produce with Brent.\n\nBrent enjoyed a sixteen-year apprenticeship with duo partner, the late Abie Boogaloo Ames (1918 - 2002), who dubbed her \"Little Boogaloo.\" Although she achieved a Bachelor of Music from the University of North Texas, Brent credits Ames with teaching her to play piano. \"Music school taught me to think, but Boogaloo taught me to boogie-woogie,\" she says. Together with Ames, Brent starred in the 1999 television documentary, Boogaloo & Eden: Sustaining the Sound. The award-winning feature, which aired nationally on PBS affiliates, explored the bond between mentor and protégé.\n\nOf the title track (and album), Brent writes, Mississippi Number One began as a solo record in April 2006 and is a tribute to my home and its blues highway, Mississippi State Highway 1, which is less traveled but follows the original blues highway, the Mississippi River, much more devotedly than its parallel neighbor, US Highway 61. Over the trio of piano, bass, and drums, she sings, Its the last of the blues highways / I recommend it if you have the time / It wont get you there in a hurry / But youre sure to have a lot of fun.\n\nThe CD kicks off with an energetic two fisted keyboard workout backed by Jimmi Kinard on bass and James Robertson on drums. The music is ironically rousing in wake of the theme of economic loss in the delta region written by her mother Carole Brent. That despair has appeared in more than one artists song, but the pain is no less. I got the Washington County / My factory done shut down blues, Eden sings with first hand knowledge.\n\nStandouts include Brent solo on piano breathily singing Why Dont You Do Right popularized by Peggy Lee, the bouncy Fried Chicken by Greenvilles Jimmy Phillips accompanied only by Rick Chanceys guitar and harmonica, the silky smooth song - another penned by her mother Carole Brent - love Me Til Dawn, and Edens own powerful Gospel closer with full choir (including Reba Russell), Until I Die.\n\nThe only misstep I found is an attempt to make-it-her-own on the song Trouble In Mind. Artists often arrange a cover song to give it a fresh sound, but here the pacing is disjointed. This has always been one of my favorite songs, but while the music sounds great, the vocal delivery has the lines coming out stutter spaced instead of smoothly read.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed seeing Eden Brent live at the Mississippi Valley Blues Festival where she proved to be a first class entertainer. This CD is a clear reflection of her well developed live talent and a showcase of an expert growth into her own songwriting.\n\nReviewer James Skyy Dobro Walker is a noted Blues writer, DJ and Blues Blast contributor.

Do you remember how hungry and how much mainstream crowds embraced them? Ty Curtis and his band of young fellows help me to remember that time. Curtis Stratocaster coupled with his baby-faced voice hearkens to what contemporary blues and traditional rock (or as we sometimes call blues-rock). The album was also chosen to go to Memphis for Best Self-Produced Release this year. Recorded last year when the band had only been together for about a year and with two of the members being all of 19 years old, they have a solid base from which to jump to a long, fruitful career.\n\nThe album presents mostly rock infused guitar chops that come straight out of any blues-rockers standard playing list. However, give the kid a break, he wrote most of the songs himself, so I give him a solid B for being original. The first track is about as much blues as youll get on the album from a traditional point of view, hearkening to the Texas shuffles made popular with the Fabulous Thunderbirds. The song, entitled Come On has some decent harp chops by Jeff Grechney over top of some of Curtis most tasteful straight-ahead playing on the album coupled with the slow-blues on What Kind of Fool.\n\nCurtis has a little way to go vocally. Hes young and sounds like it. I dont hear the nuance yet that some of the more seasoned guys have. To put it in perspective, I dont like Jonny Lang or Kenny Wayne Shepherds vocals either. Curtis, though has some great rock guitar stylings conjuring thoughts of Johnny Winter, Robin Trower, and Rick Derringer at times. Hes definitely has a blues base surrounding him and, as stated before has a great spring board to leap from and learn form. The song that best fits Curtis vocally is the rock-like No She Dont, leaning on the ballad side a bit.\n\nCurtis and Company has already had a line-up change since this release, as Grechney has went on and the incomparable Hank Shreve has been added on harmonica. With undoubtedly a bit more of traditional blues infused into his recorded work and then adding the rock edge, a la Buddy Guy, Curtis will definitely be a head turner on the national scene. Give him time, hes only 19 and has plenty of blues to sing and live ahead of him.\n\nVisit Ty Curtis on the web at his website: http://tycurtisband.com/ or on MySpace. This album is also available from Pacific Blues.\n\nBen Cox is a Blues Songwriter, Musician, DJ and Journalist.\n\nFor other reviews and interviews on our website CLICK HERE.\n\nCity of Glendale Gibson Jazz and Blues Festival - April 12-13, 2008\n\nReview and Photos By Rob Paullin\n\nYes, Virginia, there is a blues festival in the Sonora Desert. Its called the City of Glendale Gibson Guitar Jazz and Blues Festival, and Blues Blast was there for much of the 25th anniversary event this past weekend in suburban Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nThe mid-April weatherbetween what passes for winter in the Valley of the Sun and the upcoming monsoon and heat seasonwas perfect for the two day, two stage event in what the locals describe as historic downtown Glendale. Historic apparently is in the eye and mind of the beholder as Glendale is only a few dozen years old, but the city has built a beautiful outdoor amphitheater combined into the steps of a sunken entrance to one of the public buildings included in their downtown square and park. Several nice restaurants surround the square and trees abound, so even the dry heat of an Arizona spring was no problem for the many thousands of blues and jazz fans--and the curious--who attended. With a quarter century of experience at this, the organizers have learned how to do it right.\n\nAnd that includes knowing how to blend a perfect mix of national touring blues acts like Tommy Castro and Roomful of Blues, with an eclectic menu of new and established home-grown Arizona-based performers. The line-up included Arizona Blues Hall of Fame inductees Hans Olson, Big Pete Peterson, and Bob Corritore, among the dozen-plus others scheduled to appear on the blues stage.\n\nWell focus on a couple of the Arizona acts to help tell the story of the Glendale Gibson Jazz and Blues Festival. And since Blues Blast focuses on, well, the blues, our apologies to the many fine jazz performers who graced the second stage in downtown Glendale.\n\nBig Daddy D Darryl Portas and his Dynamites were among the first to catch the Blues Blasts roving eye, with Anton Teschner belting out some sold sax work together with Steven Ayres on bass and Drew Hall on backing guitar, all in front of Carlos Jones on drums. The highlight was when vocalist and guitarist Big Daddy D stepped off the stage to play slide guitar with the obligatory beer bottle, then even a lawn chair and finally one of those old fashioned record albums. This performance drew the audience in for the Prescott, Arizona, based band, and helped set the stage for nightfall and eventually, headliner Tommy Castro.\n\nIt also made for a tough act to follow for Phoenix-based all-girl blues band, Sistah Blue. But the 13-year Phoenix blues veterans followed brilliantly, behind the searing harmonica work of Rochelle Raya, the stand-out instrumental stylings of guitarist and song-writer Nancy Dalessandro, the driving rhythms of drummer Janet Daniels and the soulful vocals of Lila Sherman. The songsmostly written by Arizona Blues Hall of Famer Dalessadroand the performance, had the bands large local fan base up on their feet and dancing for the entire set. And a sad note for our Arizona Blues Blast readers: Sistah Blue is retiring after hundreds of performances and several CDs over their dozen-plus years: Their last public performance will be May 22 at Phoenix Rhythm Room, if you want to say Good bye and good luck.\n\nWell note one other performance in brief, not because they were not goodthey werebut because they are from San Francisco and not the Phoenix area. Thats Mark Hummel and The Blues Survivors. The highlight of their show was their original song, The Big Easy Aint Easy No More, a protest song over the way the current administration is dealing with the post Katrina crisis in New Orleans. Regrettably, the powerful song drew only a smattering of polite applause from the huge audience. Ill say no more on that .\n\nWith 25 years of experience, the promoters and organizers of the Glendale Gibson Jazz and Blues festival know how to do it right! Put it on your list for next spring in the Valley of the Sun. And as if you needed any more incentives to attend next April .its FREE!!!\n\nTwo Lone Peak bottles up for the Glendale Gibson Jazz and Blues Festival!\n\nReviewer, journalist and educator Rob Paullin has worked and sampled the blues everywhere from Chicago, New Orleans and Memphis to Kyiv, Beijing and Venice.\n\nFor other reviews and interviews on our website CLICK HERE.\n\nNick Moss Helps Darwins In Marietta, Georgia To Evolve...\n\nEVOLUTION, Can Be X-tremely Cruel...\n\nOn the other hand, when you and your Blues posse of good buds are sitting locked into a stellar Blues groove in Marietta GAs Darwins with Nick Moss and The Flip Tops, the absolute very best in imported Chicago Blues, evolution can just ROCK your little ole world !\n\nAs some of you may know. I live in the mountains of North Georgia. Where there are just too dang many live choices for Bluegrass or Kountry music up thar in the Ga hills, but every now and then I simply need a live & tasty Blues fix, in addition to something good to eat and lots of choices on very cold, Adult style beverages. Darwins is located on 120 near The Big Chicken on Highway 41 has a very long history of providing all of the above in a very consistent & professional manner with absolute top-shelf Blues Joint ambiance!\n\nOn Friday April 4th, I was thrilled to be in the audience to review Nick Moss and band. I was a little shocked however. that there was an opening band. Gene Owens & the Easy Hearts, are a self described, Alternative Country Rock band, & seemed to be a large. reverberating, clashing, CLANG-Cha-wang... in a die-hard, Blues club. Clearly, this was a mis-step, backwards toward the hillbilly swamp in the EVOLUTION of Darwin'sBlues. They pulled themselves together and seemed adequate, yet they REALLY needed a Country venue, to persecute with country tunes!\n\nFinally, the TRUE CHICAGO Blusers Swat Team & Killer Quartet consisting of: Nick Moss - lead guitar vocals, & harp, Willie Oshawny on keyboards, Gerry Hunt on bass & on slide electric mandolin, and Vince Span on drums arrived to save the evening from Kountry-fried, ear, nose, throat & Soul pollution!\n\nThe Moss rhythm section, just sits firmly in the pocket and smokes it behind this Grrreat Chicago axe man blazing, & phrasing in his signature marinated in Muddy Waters vs. Mike Bloomfield, infused, electric Blues, authenticity. I have to say that I felt like CATHEAD Nunn had died and gone to Blues heaven on earth, yall!\n\nBy Mike CATHEAD Nunn & Gary WINGMAN Weeks Photos by CATHEAD Nunn\n\nVisit Mike's Web Site at : www.nunnandassoc.com"
