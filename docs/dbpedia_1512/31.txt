INTRODUCTION

Baldwin Directory Company, Inc., publishers of your city directory, takes pleasure in presenting the 1949 edition to the general public. A large force of trained enumerators and solicitors worked diligently in the preparation of this volume and we are confident that the result is an authentic and useful city directory.

We have faith in the continued growth of your city and we believe that our directory will take its place as one of the vital instruments for the advancement of your community. Subsequent editions will be issued promptly and regularly.

This volume is an example of the ABCD type of city directory as originated and developed by the Baldwin Directory Company, Inc. In the modern business world with its greatly changed sales and credit systems, the old type of directory has become completely obsolete. In adapting the directory to modern conditions the Baldwin organization is the pioneer. The excellent city directory which your city now has is the result of the progressive spirit of this company and its accurate interpretation of modern business requirements.

SIX DIVISIONS OF THE BOOK

The principal parts of the Baldwin Directory are as follows:

1. The Buyer's Guide and Civic Section js made up of the advertisements of the leading business firms of the city, announcements of churches, clubs, lodges, associations and schools, and professional cards of public-spirited lawyers, physicians and dentists. The display spaces have been carefully grouped and indexed under headings which are descriptive of the business engaged in by each firm. The Buyer's Guide, when properly arranged and distributed, is of tremendous value in the building of business in the community.

2. The Resident Directory contains most of the data concerning the individual. The wife's name is given in parenthesis, and the number of dependents under 16 is shown as well as the ownership of homes. This is followed by position, place qf^?fgfc3SS*eB and home address.

INTRODUCTION

' CJ

3. The Householders' Directory contains a complete directory of streets and avenues, properly located, gives the names of all householders arranged as they come upon the streets and avenues, indicates ownership of property.

4. The Business Directory and List of Nationally Advertised Brands contains the names of all business firms, professional people and nonprofit organizations, properly classified. In this division are also listed the names of nationally advertised brands of merchandise, with the name of the local agents or distributors.

5. The Numerical Telephone Directory contains telephone numbers arranged in numerical sequence.

6. Rural Route Directory contains names of all rural residents.

SPECIAL ABCD FEATURES

The following valuable information which appears in the ABCD type of directory is not to be found in the old-style city directory:

Number of dependents under sixteen;

Designation of home ownership;

Nationally Advertised Brands;

Numerical Telephone Directory;

Telephone Numbers on Street Guide.

In addition to these valuable features, the ABCD type of directory is more conservatively styled, printed on better paper and more beautifully bound, arranged for more convenient use and contains a much more complete civic section. Directory stands are maintained in the business district for the use of the general public.

THE HOUSEHOLDERS' SUPPLEMENT

After including every conceivable feature which would tend to make the directory as useful and attractive as possible, the originators of the ABCD type of directory made one more bold stroke they established a guaranteed HOME circulation for advertising matter by issuing the Householders' Supplement and delivering it to the homes of the community. Every advertisement which appears in a Baldwin Directory also appears in the Householders' Supplement, making the Baldwin Directory "America's greatest dollar-for-dollar advertising medium" today.

BALDWIN DIRECTORY CO., INC.

Ath ens Georgia

IN CLARKE COUNTY

Athens, Northeast Georgia's principal city and Clarke County, Georgia's smallest county in area, were founded in 1801, at the time of the selection of the present site of the University of Georgia, the oldest state university in the nation. Athens, Clarke County and the University have all grown steadily, until the City of Athens now has a total population of more than 35,000, including a year round enrollment in excess of 7,000 students in the University. Clarke County's population is estimated at 40,000 with 70 percent white and more than 99 percent American born. Athens is located among gently rolling hills, overlooking the Oconee river, seventy miles east of Georgia's state capital.

In the early years of Athens' existence it was almost entirely dependent on the University, but through a combination of agricultural, commercial, educational and industrial leadership it has developed into a city of thriving and constantly increasing importance not only as a center of education, but of distribution, manufacturing, marketing, processing and trade, while agricultural production has shown steady annual increases from fertile soil and the constant application of improved methods and mechanization in farming.

Today Athens has more than a hundred manufacturing and processing plants, but even prior to the Civil War the city's industrial importance was recognized. Early settlers quickly made use of available water power and by 1830 the textile industry had been started, followed soon thereafter by factories making wagons, carriages, harness, saddles, furniture, boots, shoes, guns, pistols, wool-carding machines, farm machinery, tin ware and iron castings. There were also tanneries, watch and clock factories and fabricators of jewelry. Some of these industrial units, most of them necessarily small, were forced out of business during and immediately following the Civil War, but others have been established to take their places and the number of persons employed in Clarke county industries has increased steadily year by year as old plants grew or new industries began operations.

Progress, however, has destroyed none of the picturesque beauty and charm of points of historic interest. Antebellum show places still mingle and blend with newer architectural designs and much of the flavor and atmosphere of the Old South still exists even in this thriving, modern city, rich in culture, steeped in tradition, revering its heritage, yet progressive in the outlook and leadership of its friendly people who constantly seek further growth and expansion.

Accessibility: Athens is served by two airports, one airline, five railroads, seven bus lines, nine motor freight lines, four Federal highways and six state highways, all paved. It is on the trunk line of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad between Birmingham and Atlanta and Washington, Boston, Philadelphia and New York, with overnight service to the principal markets of the East. It is also a terminal of the Central of Georgia, operating from Macon. The Southern Railway's main line extension comes from Lula, Georgia, and the Athens division of the Georgia Railroad and the Gainesviile Midland Railroad have terminals. Athens has sixty-eight regular bus schedules, twelve passenger trains daily and nineteen freights. It is on Federal Highways 29, 78, 129 and 441 and is easily accessible for passengers, express and freight in all directions.

Agriculture: Cotton, corn, potatoes, small grains, poultry, trucking, livestock and dairy production are Clarke County's principal agricultural products. Most products, except those grown in tropical climates, can be grown in the Athens area, with its average growing season of 217 days. Livestock production is constantly increasing, with annual sales, through the weekly auction of the Northeast Georgia Livestock Marketing Association in Athens, exceeding $2,000,000.00 annually, and dairy products rapidly approaching a similar figure. Land has already been acquired for a large state farmers market, on which construction is soon to begin. Nearly a thousand freezer lockers are available for lease.

Banks: Athens has three banks with total available resources in excess of $320,000,000.00. One Building and Loan Association has total resources approaching $4,000,000.00.

Climate: Athens altitude varies from 600 to 800 feet. The City Hall is 771 feet. Its climate is mild and free from, extremes in either winter or summer. The average summer temperature is 61.9, varying from a monthly mean of 43.5 in January, to 79.6 in July. The relative humidity is 69 and the average annual rainfall is 49.7 inches.

Clubs: In addition to its Country Club, Athens also has units of most of the better known and larger national civic, social, cultural, patriotic and fraternal organizations for men and women, as well as many purely local organizations with similar aims and purposes. Athens is also the home of the first Garden Club organized in America.

Education: The University of Georgia, with a student enrollment in excess of 7,000 and nearly 500 faculty members, is the city's chief source of pride and its principal single industry. However, the city and county both have excellent, highly-rated public school systems for white and negro children with two high schools, one junior high school and nine grade schools conveniently located throughout the city and seventeen public schools in the county. Athens also has three business colleges, and the city has its public library in addition to the University General Library.

Government: Athens is efficiently and democratically governed by a Mayor and ten city councilmen, two from each of five wards in the city. The county has three commissioners.

Health: The Athens area is generally regarded as one of the most healthful sections in the entire State, but when needed, Athens has two excellent hospitals for the general public. Experienced general practitioners and specialists practice in both of them. The city and county also jointly maintain a full time medical director and well-staffed health department and the Athens Junior Assembly, an organization of young women, operates free medical and dental clinics for those unable to pay fully for such services.

Hotels: Athens has four hotels, with a total of SOO rooms. Another hotel is now being remodeled for reopening at an early date. In addition, Athens has tourist homes, trailer camps and innumerable good restaurants and eating places.

Industry: Athens and Clarke County have more than a hundred manufacturing and processing plants. The textile industry is the largest, and cotton is processed into yarns, sheeting, flannel, upholstery and curtain material, tire fabric, rope, bands, elastic braid, rugs and many other cotton products. Other important plants and products are cottonseed oil refineries, fertilizer, garments, veneer, cooperage, canned meats and vegetables, dairy products, bakeries, candy, foundry and machine works, corn and flour milling, mattress making, blankets, etc. These industries and a number of wholesale and brokerage houses distribute from Athens into adjoining states, although many products made in Athens have nationwide distribution. Loyal, intelligent, labor is available not only for industries already operating, but for other desirable ones which may wish to locate in the Athens area.

Newspaper and Radios: Athens and Clarke County are served by the Banner-Herald, published daily and Sunday, and by Radio Stations WGAU and WRFC. All of these units of communication extend throughout the Athens trade area, providing not only news, but entertainment features to more than 200,000 people.

Recreation: Facilities for entertainment and recreation are plentiful. The city has five motion picture theatres, one 18-hole, Donald Ross golf course, seven playgrounds, one teen-age center, one park of 56 acres, a community recreation house, the largest municipal, tile swimming pool in the South, riding academies, tennis courts, the highest class concerts, lectures and other cultural attractions, baseball, hunting, fishing, bowling, skeet, etc., and last but not least, the University of Georgia football team, the "Bulldogs", which too frequently for other major colleges and universities is of championship caliber.

Religion: Active churches of practically all of the leading denominations are to be found in Athens, with 23 for white people and 20 for negroes.

Streets: Athens proudly boasts of some of the most beautiful residential streets in the nation, and more than one hundred miles of city streets are paved.

Taxes: City and county assessments are made at approximately 60 percent of real values. Tax rates are reasonable for the services citizens desire.

Trade: More than two hundred retail establishments in Athens, well-staffed and well-stocked with style and staple merchandise, serve a trading area of approximately forty miles with a population in excess of 200,000 people, who come to Athens regularly on paved highways radiating in every direction.

Utilities: Abundant electric power for all purposes is available from the Georgia Power Company throughout the Athens area. Southern Bell operates the telephone system, and the city supplies excellent water for domestic, commercial and industrial purposes through its own water system. Natural gas is not yet available in Athens, but artificial gas is supplied by mains to most sections of the city.
