INTRODUCTION

Nelsons' Directory Company, Inc., publishers of your city directory, takes pleasure in presenting the 1956 edition to .the general public. A large force of trained enumerators and solicitors worked diligently in the preparation of this volume and we are confident that the result is an authentic and useful city directory.

We have faith in the continued growth of your city and we believe that our directory will take its-place as one of the vital instruments for the advancement of your community. Subsequent editions will be issued promptly and regularly.

This volume is an example of the LARN type of city directory as originated and developed by the Nelsons' Directory Company, Inc. In the modern business world with its greatly changed sales and credit systems, the old type of directory has become completely obsolete. In adopting the directory to modern conditions the Nelson organization is the pioneer. The excellent city directory which your city now has is the result of the progressive spirit of this company and its accurate interpretation of modern business requirements.

SIX DIVISIONS OF THE BOOK

The principal parts of the Nelsons' Directory are as follows:

1. The Buyer's Guide and Civic Section is made up of the advertisements of the leading business firms of the city, announcements of churches, clubs, lodges, associations and schools, and professional cards of public-spirited lawyers, physicians and dentists. The display spaces have been carefully grouped and indexed under headings which are descriptive of the business engaged in by each firm. The Buyer's Guide, when properly arranged and distributed, is of tremendous value in the building of business in the community.

2. The Resident Directory contains most of the data concerning the individual. The wife's name is given in parenthesis, and the number of dependents under 16 is shown as well as the ownership of homes. This is followed by position, place of employment and home address.

3. The Householders' Directory contains a complete directory of streets and avenues, properly located, gives the names of all householders arranged as they come upon the streets and avenues, indicates ownership of property.

4. The Business Directory and List of Nationally Advertised Brands contains the names of all business firms, professional people and non-profit organizations, properly classified. In this division are also listed the names of nationally advertised brands of merchandise, with the name of the local agents or distributors.

INTRODUCTION

5. The Numerical Telephone Directory contains telephone numbers arranged in numerical sequence.

6. Rural Route Directory contains names of all rural residents.

SPECIAL LARN FEATURES

The following valuable information which appears in the LARN type of directory is not to be found in the old-style city directory:

Number of dependents under sixteen;

'; ; Designation of home ownership;

Nationally Advertised Brands;

Numerical Telephone Directory;

Telephone Numbers on Street Guide.

Rural Route Directory

In addition to these valuable features, the LARN type of directory is more conservatively styled, printed on better paper and more beautifully bound, arranged for more convenient use and contains a much more complete civic section.

THE HOUSEHOLDERS' SUPPLEMENT

After including every conceivable feature which would tend to make the directory as useful and attractive as possible, the originators of the LARN type of directory made one more bold stroke they established a guaranteed HOME circulation for advertising matter by issuing the Householders' Supplement and delivering it to the homes of the community. Every advertisement which appears in Nelsons' Directory also appears in the Householder's Supplement, making the Nelsons' Directory "America's greatest dollar-for-dollar advertising medium" today.

Athens, the principal city in Northeast Georgia, was founded in 1801. The city's population in 1956 exceeds 36,000, with an additional year-round student body at the University of Georgia of approximately 6,000. Clarke County (Georgia's smallest county in area, of which Athens is the county seat) has an estimated 1956 population of 42,000, with 75 percent white and more than 99 percent American born. Athens is located among gently rolling hills, on the banks of the Oconee River, seventy miles east of Atlanta.

Originally Athens was almost entirely dependent on the University of Georgia, the oldest state university in America, but through combined agricultural, commercial, industrial and educational leadership it has developed into a city of thriving and steadily increasing importance not only as a center of education, but of manufacturing, marketing, wholesale distribution, retail trade and processing, with agricultural production showing annual increases from fertile soil and the constant application of improve methods and mechinization in farming.

Today Athens has more than a hundred manufacturing and processing plants, but even prior to the Civil War the city's industrial importance was recognized. Early settlers quickly made use of available water power and by 1830 the textile industry had been started, follcwed soon thereafter by factories making wagons, carriages, har-

ness, saddles, furniture, boots, shoes, guns, pistols, wool-carding machines, farm machinery, tin ware and iron castings.

There were also tanneries, watch and clock factories and fabricators of jewelry. Some of these industrial units, most of them necessarily small, were forced out of business during and immediately following the Civil War, but others have been established to take their places and the number of persons employed in Clarke County industries has increased steadily year by year as old plants grew or new industries began operations.

Progress, however, has destroyed none of the picturesque beauty and charm of points of historic interest. Antebellum show places still mingle and blend with newer architectural designs and much of the flavor and atmosphere of the Old South still exists even in this thriving, modern city, rich in culture, steeped in tradition, revering its heritage, yet progressive in the outlook and leadership of its friendly people who constantly seek further growth and expansion.

ACCESSIBILITY: Athens is served by one airline, five railroads, seven bus lines, fourteen motor freight lines, four Federal highways and six state highways, all paved. It is on the trunk line of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad between Birmingham and Atlanta and Washington, Boston, Philadelphia and New York, with overnight service to the principal markets of the East. It is also a terminal of the Central of Georgia, operating from Macon. The Southern Railway's main line extension comes from Lula, Georgia, and the Athens division of the Georgia Railroad and the Gainesville Midland Railroad have terminals. Athens has sixty-eight regular bus schedules, twelve passenger trains daily and nineteen freights. It is on Federal Highways 29, 78,129,441 and is easily accessible for passengers, express and freight in all directions.

AGRICULTURE: Cotton, corn, potatoes, small grains, poultry, trucking, livestock and dairy production are Clarke County's principal agricultural products. Most products, except those grown in tropical

climates, can be grown in the Athens area, with its average growing season of 217 days. Livestock production is constantly increasing, with annual sales, through the weekly auction of the Northeast Georgia Livestock Marketing Association in Athens, exceeding $2,500,000.00 annually, and dairy products rapidly approaching a similar figure. One of the state's large farmers' markets is located in Athens.

BANKS: Athens has three banks with total available resources in excess of $400,000,000.00. One Building and Loan Association has total resources approaching $10,000,000.00.

CLIMATE: Athens altitude varies from 600 to 800 feet. The City Hall is 771 feet. Its climate is mild and from free extremes in either winter or summer. The average summer temperature is 61.9, varying from a monthly mean of 43.5 in January, to 79.6 in July. The relative humidity is 69 and the average rainfall is 49.7 inches.

CLUBS: In addition to its Country Club, Athens also has units of most of the better known and larger national civic, social, cultural, patriotic and fraternal organizations for men and women, as well as many purely local organizations with similar aims and purposes. Athens is also the home of the first Garden Club organized in America.

EDUCATION: The University of Georgia, with a student enrollment of approximately 6,000 and nearly 500 faculty members, is the city's chief source of pride and its principal single industry. However, the combined city and county public school system is highly-rated for white and negro children, with two high schools, and fifteen grade schools conveniently located throughout the city and county. Athens also has three business colleges, and the city has its public library in addition to the University General Library.

GOVERNMENT: Athens is efficiently and democratically governed by a Mayor and ten city councilmen, two from each of five wards in the city. The county has three commissioners.

HEALTH: The Athens area is generally regarded as one of the most healthful sections in the entire State, but when needed, Athens has two excellent hospitals for the general public. Experienced general practitioners and specialists practice in both of them. The city and county also jointly maintain a full time medical director and wellstaffed health department and the Athens Junior Assembly, an organization of young women, operates free medical and dental clinics for for those unable to pay fully for such services.

HOTELS: Athens has five hotels, with a total of 350 rooms. In addition, Athens has five motor courts, tourist homes, trailer camps and innumerable good restaurants and eating places.

INDUSTRY: Athens and Clarke County have more than a hundred

manufacturing and processing plants. The textile industry is the

largest. Other important plants and products are transformers (West-

inghouse), clocks (Westclox), paper milk cartons, baseball bats, rubber,

cottonseed oil refineries, fertilizer, garments, veneer, cooperage,

canned meats and vegetables, dairy products, bakeries, candy, foun-

dry and machine works, corn and flour milling, mattress making,

hosiery, etc. These industries and a number of wholesale and brok-

erage houses distribute from Athens into adjoining states, although

many products made in Athens have nationwide distribution. Loyal,

intelligent labor is available not only for industries already operating,

but for other desirable ones which may wish to locate in the Athens

area

'

.

NEWSPAPER AND RADIOS: Athens and Clarke County are served by the Banner-Herald, published daily and Sunday, and by Radio Stations WGAU and WRFC. All of these units of communication extend throughout the Athens trade area, providing not only news, but entertainment features to more than 250,000 people.

RECREATION: Facilities for entertainment and recreation are plentiful. The city has six motion picture theatres, one 1 8-ho!e Donald Ross golf course, seven playgrounds, one teen-age center, two public

parks, a community recreation house, the largest municipal tile swimming pool in the South, riding academies, tennis courts, the highest class concerts, lectures and other cultural attractions, baseball, hunting, fishing, bowling, skeet, etc., and last but not least, the University of Georgia football team, the "Bulldogs", which too frequently for other major colleges and universities is of championship caliber.

RELIGION: Active churches of practically all of the leading denominations are to be found in Athens, with 25 for white peolpe and 22 for negroes.

STREETS: Athens proudly boasts of some of the most beautiful residential streets in the nation, and more than one hundred miles of city streets are paved.

TAXES: City and county assessments are made at approximately 50 percent of real values. Tax rates are reasonable for the services citizens derive.

TRADE: More than three hundred retail establishments in Athens, well-staffed, and well-stocked with style and staple merchandise, serve a trading area of approximately forty miles with a population in excess of 250,000 people, who come to Athens regularly on paved highways radiating in every direction.

UTILITIES: Abundant electric power and natural gas for all purposes are available. Southern Bell operates the telephone system, and the city supplies excellent water for domestic, commercial and industrial purposes through its own water system.

14. In the Compton House, the stone building at the front entrance to Connor Hall, Agricultural College Campus, lived Martha Atlanta Compton, for whom Atlanta was twice named once when it was called "AAarthasville", and again when the name was changed to "Atlanta."

15. The University Chapel, built in 1832. Many legends cling to it. The Sun Dial stands on the spot where the "Toombs Oak" grew. In the Chapel is a painting of St. Peter's Cathedral in Rome, one of the largest mounted oil paintings in America, and a most remarkable work of art.

16. Beautiful ante-bellum homes mingled with the modern, on lovely tree-shaded streets.

17. Eighteen miles east of Athens, on U. S. Highway 29, is the home of Dr. Crawford W. Long, discoverer of anaesthesia. Eighteen miles north on U. S. 129, scene of the first operation using general anaesthetic by Dr. Crawford W. Long.
