The work embodies a complete epitome of the civic, commercial, social and industrial interests and activities of the municipality. It is a modern Directory in all its parts and includes all of the essential features which have been proven so satisfactory to our patrons in previous issues; these have been retained and amplified, and improvements have been added as suggested by experience in order to add to the value and usefulness of the Directory, thus fully meeting the requirements of patrons; the approbation and continued patronage accorded the work are constant incentives to better service.\n\nThe publication has had the benefit and advantage of the complete organization of the publishers, of the skill and experience of their corps of enumerators and compilers and of the co-operation of citizens in the production of the volume.\n\nThe statistical review following this introduction and interspersed with cuts is impressive as indicating the wealth, industry and culture of the city and of the territory of which Columbus is the center.\n\nThe several departments of the Directory are set forth in the order following:\n\nTHE MISCELLANEOUS DEPARTMENT, pages 27 to 36 include data concerning city and county officials, public and private institutions, banks, cemeteries, churches, courts, hospitals and homes, libraries, miscellaneous schools and colleges, societies, newspapers, parks, public buildings, halls, postoffice data, railroads, secret and benevolent societies, etc.\n\nTHE BUYERS' GUIDE occupies pages 37 to 76.

Columbus was established in 1827 by an act of the\n\nGeorgia Legislature which appointed commissioners ana gave them authority to select a site and lay out the town. The commissioners selected a site on the East Bank of the Chattahoochee River at the head of navigation, 275 miles from the G'ulf of Mexico, and at the foot of the falls. The growth of the city has followed railroad and industrial development. Columbus is the county seat of Muscogee County.\n\nINTRODUCTION GOVERNMENT Columbus has the Commission form of Government. The success of this system is shown on every hand in municipal improvement, in paving, lighting and sewerage. This movement in governmental economy is the result of a wide-spread change in civic sentiment throughout the country. The Commission feels the obligation of making Columbus a model of healthfulness and civic beauty, thus making it an ideal place in which to live and rear families. FINANCIAL STRENGTH Columbus has three National banks and six State banks and trust companies. Figures as of March, 1925: capital, $1,789,000; surplus and profits, $1,581,000; deposits, $12,576,000; loans, $12,324,000; clearings, year ended Sept. 30, 1924, $46,679,000. INDUSTRIAL CENTER The great hydro-electric power obtainable at Columbus which is the furthest-south great waterpower in the United States, has resulted in many successful plants locating in and near Columbus. There is an abundance of potential power. Surrounded by Columbus on two sides and bounded on another side by the river, Bibb City, an incorporated city, boasts of the largest textile mill under one roof in America, probably in the world. Bibb City begins in the thickly populated section where the city lines\n\nGViIirsEaWrodn,ePAAolfaR.,sTeovnOeeFraolCf OftuwLrUnoiMsbhBriiUdnggSe--spNomwotaeekribntrogid1tgh0e0e cmtohanrneneuecfcatiicnttigeusrCinaosgluopmnlaeb.nustsAwmditaahkmiFnbhgednoJiWwX The widveiewstroefetCpolaurmksb,usa.s well as some of the public squares, may be seen\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nCthHeACThTaAttHahOoOoCchHeEeErivReIrV, EaRnd SthTeEAfaMrtEhRes--t-CSooluutmhbgurseaits watatethrepohweaedr iosf tnhaavtigfuatrinoinsheodn I wbyiththirsegriuvlearr aptasCsoelnugmebr uasn..dTfhreeitgrhipt sfreorvmiceC.olumbus, Georgia, to the gulf is! 360 miles\n\nstop and the Columbus street cars run beyond the incorporated city. Bibb City is really a city within a city due to its being practically surrounded by Columbus. While the textile industry, employing 9,500 men and women, is the largest industry; there are a variety of industries in Columbus and suburbs.\n\nOther manufacturing plants are brick and tile, lumber plant including the South's largest fixture and commercial furniture plant in the South, agricultural machinery, including several large cotton gin manufacturing plants selling their products in foreign countries as well as America, bottling plants, being the home of Chero-Cola and Ricco and the city where the formula for Coca-Cola was compounded, brooms, brushes, clothing, fertilizer, flour, food products, creamery and others. The textile mills produce a variety of goods, including hosiery, towels, sheeting, tire fabric, yarns, cotton suitings, sateens, ducks, tickings, bedspreads and other products. Many of the textile products are exported. Machine shops and foundries supply parts and castings for cotton mills and other manufacturing plants right at home. The nearness of vast stores of lumber and brick and tile plants provide building materials in easy reach of those desiring to erect plants or residences.\n\n10\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRAIL AND WATER TRANSPORTATION\n\nColumbus is served by five lines of the Central of Georgia Railway, one line of the Seaboard Airline and one of the Southern Railway. It also has the advantage of water transportation to the gulf, 360 miles away, the boats passing through vast lumber regions and cotton plantations. The rail lines carry Columbus products in all directions. A trolley system affords transportation about the city and to the suburbs. A belt line of a railroad provides local freight deliveries and connects with the steamboat line at the terminal, giving rail to boat shipping facilities.\n\nLABOR RESOURCES\n\nTo estimate the labor resources of the Columbus district, it is necessary to understand the characteristics of the population of the four counties of which Columbus is the center and only important industrial community. These counties are: Muscogee County, Georgia; Chattahoochee County, Georgia; Lee County, Alabama; Russell County, Alabama.\n\nAcross the river from Columbus in Alabama, the towns of Phenix and Girard are connected with Columbus by bridges and are really a part of the same community, many residents of both places being employed in Columbus.\n\nThe total population of the four counties mentioned above was 109,730 in 1920. There has been an increase since 1920 but the Government census figures of that date will serve to show the characteristics of the population.\n\nThe total white population of the district in 1920 was 51,785 and the total colored population, 57,945.\n\n%i> FEDERAL BUILDING--PostinOtfhfiicse satnrducFtuerdee.ral Court provided quarters\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nANOTHER STREET SCENE--Upper Broad street.\n\nproaches her one hundredth birthday the streets and special square for churches, court house and other p'ublic purposes have not been encroached upon. Pageants depicting the industrial and commercial progress and growth in all lines of endeavor will move through the broad and beautiful thoroughfares in 1928 when Columbus, Georgia, will have a great centennial celebration.\n\nStately trees line the avenues and streets while the public squares are made more beautiful by a great number of magnificent trees.\n\nSCHOOLS AND CHUBCHES\n\nColumbus schools are complete and have attracted the eyes of European and Japanese leaders and have received commendation in publications of Europe. The first public school system in the South was established in Columbus, as was the first municipally operated vocational school. Several modern grammar school buildings have been constructed recently and civic bodies are seeking a new high school building. Two high schools are a part of the public school system. In addition there is the Chase Conservatory of Music, Lorena Hall, a girls school and a parochial school.\n\nPractically every denomination is represented in the churches to be found in Columb'us. The Church Square, one of the spacious public plots laid off by the state engineers, affords beautiful surroundings for two of the churches.\n\nINTRODUCTION TAXABLE VALUES $36,011,541.00 in 1922, compared with $22,428,445.00 in 1915 and $17,417,847.00 in 1910. 1923, $36,679,513; 1924, 39,485,051; 1925, $44,923,176 (Est.)\n\nTAX BATE $1.80 per $100.

The Chamber of Commerce is the guide, philosopher and friend of the home town and the community. With this background in mind any community must thoroughly realize that the efforts of community upbuilding tend toward evolution.
