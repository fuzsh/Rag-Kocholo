Spellings are corrected where information is available, but otherwise spellings are from the source. Some individuals may be duplicated due to spelling and given name variation. The list is by no means complete since each source has omissions and new data continuously has come to light over the years. Individuals of similar name who were listed as deserters, discharged or still on active duty from rosters of the 3rd, 4th or 6th US Infantry prior to or during the battle and are also on archival land bounty lists and/or later verified to have served in Republic of Texas units are noted in red below the name (Source: Walraven’s The Magnificent Barbarians)\n\nFor more biographical information:\n\nSee The San Jacinto Museum: Veterans\n\nSearch Handbook of Texas Online"
