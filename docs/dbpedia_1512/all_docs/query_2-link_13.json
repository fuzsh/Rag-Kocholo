        "text": "For the second year in a row, Lake Land College’s Phi Theta Kappa (PTK) chapter reached Five Star Chapter status. The Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society is an international organization that ranks campus chapters on a five star system. Completion of an Honors in Action project addressing a need in the community and on campus is required as a final step in advancing to five star status distinction.\n\nPTK Vice President and Chair of Honors in Action and College Project Trevor Elder, Sullivan, explained Phi Theta Kappa’s sense of obligation to examine the Lake Land College student body’s mental health, increase mental health awareness and availability of mental health related resources on campus.\n\n“In response to a college student’s post on Twitter regarding college student mental health, PTK created an Honors in Action project that captured the mental health concerns of the student body at Lake Land College. Throughout the fall semester of 2019, our Honors in Action team researched and conducted surveys on multiple platforms that were distributed across campus, and full reports were shared with college administration,” Elder said.\n\nMembers of the Honors in Action team also presented their project research to the Illinois Community College Trustees Association (ICCTA) at the ICCTA East Central Regional Meeting held at Lake Land College on Thursday, Feb. 20.\n\nOne of several requirements for recognition as a five star status chapter is the submission of at least three entries in the Hallmark Awards Program including the Honors in Action Project Award, College Project Award and at least one other individual award. PTK Advisor and Academic Counselor Krista Burrell also submitted an individual award for the Distinguished Chapter Officer Team Award.\n\n“With each new academic year, we have a new set of students, which means that reaching five stars is not permanent,” Burrell said. “This year, PTK was intentional about making a positive impact on campus through the Honors in Action and college projects first, then meeting submission requirements for five star status second.”\n\nReaching five star status also includes recognizing academic excellence by creating awareness of PTK among the college community, establishing chapter leadership and engagement, developing an Honors in Action project and a college project such as maintaining a chapter Facebook page, increasing the PTK presence on campus and increasing engagement in the region, and submitting three entries in the Hallmark Awards Program. To top it off, chapters are encouraged to attend the annual catalyst. The Lake Land College PTK chapter will attend the National PTK Catalyst Convention in Grapevine, Texas in early April.\n\nAt the national level, the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society is divided into geographic regions. The Illinois Region is a Five Star Region and nominations were sent in to the Regional Awards for Excellence in three categories: Fellowship; Chapter Engagement; and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Regional award finalists will be announced at the PTK Catalyst Convention.\n\n“Earning five-star status and attending the catalyst convention is not the end of our efforts. We will still be collaborating with SGA and other students to address mental health needs on our campus, namely through the promotion of the upcoming Active Minds chapter,” PTK President Tanner Clark, Strasburg, said.\n\nCoincidently, several student organizations on campus, including the Student Activity Board (SAB) and the Student Government Association (SGA), also focused on the mental health of Lake Land students during the fall semester. SAB coordinated a therapy dog event during finals week for students to decompress between their final exams. Additionally, SGA is currently working toward establishing an Active Minds chapter at Lake Land College. Active Minds is a nonprofit organization that promotes mental health awareness within high schools and college campuses across the nation.\n\n“It’s serendipitous that the U.S. House of Representatives authorized The Higher Education Mental Health Act shortly after PTK had the idea to do the Honors in Action project on college student mental health,” Burrell said. “The students identified the concern concurrently with the lawmakers.”\n\n“I speak for all of my fellow PTK officers when I say that we want to leave a positive impact on this campus. Our chapter wants to set up students for success at Lake Land College, and promoting a healthy mental well-being is key to that success,” Clark said.\n\nPTK sends invitations each year to students who have completed 12 credit hours at the collegiate level with a 3.25 GPA or exceptional high school students passing with a 3.5 GPA.\n\nMembers of the Honors in Action team are PTK President Clark, Strasburg; PTK Vice President and Chair of Honors in Action and College Project Elder, Sullivan; PTK Secretary Kyra Jackson, Findlay; PTK Treasurer Macy Vogt, Teutopolis; Tim Lawyer, Mattoon; Lucas Duduit, Pana; and Lauren Hendershot, Windsor.\n\nIn an effort to expose young students to a variety of career and occupational choices, more than 2,000 local junior high students will assemble in the Lake Land College Field House on Thursday, April 2 and Friday, April 3 for the annual 8th Grade Career Conference.\n\nTogether, Lake Land College and Eastern Illinois Education for Employment System will co-sponsor the conference—an event in which more than 60,000 students have participated throughout the years.\n\nThe career conference will provide participants career exploration through communication and contact with local professionals representing sixteen career clusters, or employment fields. Students will also experience the motivation and enthusiasm showcased by the event’s featured speaker, Brooks Harper, author of 7 Skills to Make Mill$ and Why Should We Hire YOU?\n\n“The conference is an important annual event for local 8th grade students. It provides them with information about career pathways and motivates them to focus on their future,” Sally Shawver, project manager for Eastern Illinois Education for Employment System, said.\n\n“The wonderful thing about this conference is how it benefits everyone. The students have this fun experience to get their career questions answered and local businesses have the early advantage to guide their future talents on the right path. The business partners who participate this year may see these same faces again during interviewing processes six to eight years from now. It’s an exciting and valuable event,” Jamie Corda Hadjaoui, Perkins specialist, said.\n\nStudents from the following schools will participate at the career conference:\n\nAltamont, Altamont Luther Interparish School, Arcola, Arthur-Lovington/Atwood-Hammond CUSD #305, Beecher City, Brownstown, Casey-Westfield, Charleston, Chrisman-Scottland, Cowden-Herrick, Crestwood-Paris, Cumberland, Dieterich, Effingham, Fresh Start TLC, Humboldt TLC, Kansas, Kansas TLC, Lerna Bridges, Marshall, Martinsville, Mattoon-Blue, Mattoon-Gold, Moulton-Shelbyville, Neoga, Oakland, Okaw-Valley, Paris Mayo, Ramsey, Sacred Heart, Shelbyville Bridges, Shiloh, South-Central, St. Anthony, St. Elmo, St. John’s-Mattoon, St. Michael, Stew-Stras and Sullivan.\n\nFor more information about the conference, contact Corda Hadjaoui at 217-234-5032 or Shawver at 217-258-6283.\n\nWhat happens when you take some of the most brilliant minds from area high schools and put them under one roof? Nothing other than an academic face off, where teams are pitted against each other in seven subject areas in order to take home the regional Academic Challenge (ACES) championship title.\n\nThe regional Academic Challenge was recently held at Lake Land College and 22 schools, registering 318 students came together to battle in biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering graphics, English, mathematics and physics.\n\nParis, St. Anthony and Mattoon high schools were victorious in their divisions and took home the regional championship titles.

The organization also named Lake Land College as the fourth best vocational school in the state.\n\nThe ranking of vocational schools and programs was formed using the National Center for Education Statistics’ Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) and the U.S. Department of Education’s College Scorecard. Lake Land College and the Medical Billing and Coding program exceeded several institutions by means of affordability, high retention and graduation rates, flexibility and employment upon completion.\n\n“What’s so noteworthy about our program is that it is entirely online. We have had students from all over the country enrolled in our program,” Kathleen Daugherty, coordinator of office professional-medical programs/business instructor, said. “Coders will always be in demand throughout the world. Their work is the basis of payment in all health organizations, and the universal health system relies on them for everything from tracking diseases and surgical techniques to annual check-ups.”\n\nLake Land College students can choose from a short-term certificate or a degree program in this field. The Medical Coding Specialist Certificate prepares students to enter the workforce and take on coding specialist positions in hospitals, clinics, insurance companies and many other facilities. The Medical Coding & Health Information degree program prepares students for management positions in health information. Both the certificate and degree program are offered completely online.\n\nUpon graduation, students are equipped to pass coding exams offered by the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) and the American Academy of Professional Coders (AAPC) to receive the CPC and CCA certification credentials.\n\nAlong with the Medical Billing and Coding program, Lake Land College overall was recognized as a top vocational school in Illinois.\n\n“Receiving recognition as a top vocational school is a testament to the importance Lake Land College places on experiential learning with more than 40 labs on campus, providing students with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in the workforce upon graduation,” Jon Althaus, vice president for academic services, said.\n\nFor more information about the Medical Billing and Coding program, contact Daugherty at 217-234-5355 or kdaugherty@lakelandcollege.edu.\n\nFor more information regarding Lake Land College and the classes and programs offered, visit lakelandcollege.edu."
