        "text": "Generously contributed to me by Linda Kaye Cope Lanier. What a wonderful documentation! Thank you so much Linda!\n\nBe sure to view the Egleston Family pictures page listed below. Viewers may contact Linda by clicking on her name below.\n\nBy Linda Kaye (Cope) Lanier\n\nThe Eggleston Family of Pendleton County\n\nPart I: The Children of Amos Eggleston Sr. & Patience Bennett\n\nBy Linda Kaye (Cope) Lanier\n\nMy great-grandmother, Mary Elizabeth Mollie Egelston was born in Pendleton County and lived there for 20 years before moving to Menifee County, Kentucky where she married my great-grandfather, Alfred Buckner Buck Cope. The family surname has undergone several changes in the spelling over the years from its original spelling in England of Eggleston to the more common spelling by most of my family of Egelston. It seems that after the family migrated west to Kentucky that the change in the spelling became more common. However, there are many family members who still use the original English spelling. But, no matter how the name is spelled, the family is still the same.\n\nThe first Egglestons to settle in Pendleton County Kentucky were Patience Eggleston, widow of Amos Eggleston Sr. and several of her children. They came to Kentucky from Steuben County, New York about 1815. Amos Eggleston Sr. was the gg-grandson of Bygod Eggleston, our immigrant ancestor who came to America from England in 1630 along with the Puritan leader, John Winthrop. Bygod was one of the founders of the town of Windsor, Connecticut. In my research I have found that every generation of Egglestons has several ministers, the first of whom were Puritans, but soon after coming to America they became some of the first Baptist preachers. Amos Eggleston Sr. founded one of the first Baptist churches in frontier New York and his widow and son, Amos Eggleston Jr. were two of the founders of Short Creek Baptist Church in Pendleton County. It is a legacy that all of us who are Eggleston descendants can be very proud.\n\nMy history on the Eggleston/Egelston family is several hundred pages, so to make it manageable for the website, I have broken it down into several parts. The following is a listing of the children of Amos Eggleston Sr. and his wife Patience Bennett. Some of their children never lived in Pendleton County, but I have left them in this part of the history so as to have a complete picture of this remarkable family.\n\nFirst Generation\n\n1. Amos EGGLESTON Sr. Born on 20 Nov 1751 in E. Middletown, Middlesex Co CT. Amos died in Bath, Steuben, NY on 20 Nov 1813, he was 62. In 1769 when Amos was 17, he married Patience BENNETT, in NY. Born abt 1755 in E. Middletown, Middlesex Co CT. Patience died in Pendleton Co KY aft 1839, she was 84. Buried in Pendleton Co KY, but the exact location has not been found. They had the following children:\n\n2 i. Samuel (1770-1815)\n\n3 ii. Rachel (1776-1857)\n\n4 iii. Benjamin (1781-1846)\n\n5 iv. Ephriam (1784->1864)\n\n6 v. Abigail \"Abbie\" (1788-1852)\n\n7 vi. Deborah (1790-1864)\n\n8 vii. Sarah Sally (~1791-)\n\n9 viii. Amos Jr. (1794-1853)\n\n10 ix. Jonathan (1798-1832)\n\n11 x. Joseph (~1799-)\n\nAmos was a veteran of the American Revolutionary War, serving in the Orange Co. NY Militia. This information is recorded in \"New York in the Revolution\" Vol I, page 164.\n\nIt is not known exactly when Amos and Patience moved to Stueben Co. NY. They are listed on the 1810 Steuben Co. NY Census, but some other records indicate they moved there before 1800. It is known that Steuben County came into being about 1788. Recorded in \"Pioneer History of Steuben co. NY, page 25 is the following: \"On the first day of Nov. 1788, the State of Mass. for securities of that state for $100 was conveyed to Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham all rights, title, and interest in the western New York, which now constitutes the counties of Steuben, Yates, Ontario, part of Wayne, most of Monroe, and also a small part of Genesee, Livingston and about one half of Allegany counties, containing about 2,600,000 acres.\" On page 124 is recorded the following: \"Judge Dow settled near the present site of Reading Centre.\" Recorded also are these words of Judge Dow, \"I think it was in the fall of 1791, I went to view a land in township, No 2nd range, and there were two families there.. I went back to the same place in 1794 and learned that Solomon Wixon, with a large family, two families of the name of Silbee, two or three Sandfords, and others had settled there.\" It is not known if one of these \"other\" families included the family of Amos and Patience Eggleston, but it is known that two of their daughters, Rachel and Abigail, married two of the sons of Solomon Wixon, namely Joshua and John. Rachel's marriage to Joshua Wixon has been recorded as taking place 14 Oct 1798, so it is presumed that Amos and Patience settled in Steuben County previous to that time.\n\nAmos Sr. was instrumental in helping organize the Chemung Baptist Association at Elmire, Chemung County, New York in November 1796. One of the churches in this association was the First Baptist Church of Bath, Steuben County, New York, which joined the association in 1802. According to information recorded in \"Historical Statement of the Bath Baptist Church, Bath, New York, prepared by and presented to the church Sunday morning, March 15, 1942 by the pastor, Rev. Harland K. Tuttle, D.D., the church was organized in 1798 and was located on a hill four or five miles south of the village. The first pastor of the church was Brother Amos Eggleston. The church was received into the Steuben Association in 1802. Amos' name appears in the minutes of the Chemung Baptist Association at the 1802 meeting in Romulus. Church records also indicate that Amos Eggleston, minister of the church was one of 23 representatives of the church who attended the annual meeting of the Chemung Baptist Association on Wednesday the 3rd and Thursday the 4th of November, 1808. In the church minutes of 1813, it is noted that \"Our Brother in the ministry, Amos Eggleston, died in the past year.\n\nAbout one year after the death of her husband, Amos Sr., in New York, Patience and her sons, Amos Jr., Jonathan, and Ephriam, and her daughter Deborah, with their families joined her eldest son, Samuel, and his family in Kentucky and lived for a short while in Campbell and Kenton Counties. They traveled to Kentucky on land, by ox cart, from Bath, Steuben Co. NY, through Pennsylvania, until they reached the Ohio River. They rafted down the Ohio River to Covington, Campbell Co. KY (later Kenton Co. KY). Ephriah moved on to Schyler Co. Illinois, Samuel remained in Kenton County, while Patience, Amos Jr., Jonathan, and Deborah, with their families finally settled in Pendleton County. One of the first orders of business for the family was the organization of a church in their community. Patience, her daughter Deborah Jaynes, her son Amos Jr. and his wife Amanda joined Alexander and Anna Monroe in the founding of Short Creek Baptist Church in 1833. The first minutes of the church have been preserved and a copy of them can be found on this Pendleton County website.\n\nAmos Sr. died intestate and a rather messy division of his property in New York took several years to settle. Amos Sr. owned 50 acres of land in Steuben Co. NY, near Bath at the time of his death. In 1836, Patience, his widow, executed a power of attorney to Ebeneazer Jayne, husband of her daughter, Deborah, who took it to New York and made some disposition of the 50 acres there. He also took power of attorney to transact some business for his step-daughter, Rebecca Tomlin, \"to settle the estate of her father, Abraham Covenhaven\", who was the former husband of Deborah.\n\nAccording to a law suit filed in Pendleton Co. KY, April 4, 1838, \"Patience Eggleston vs Ebenezer Jayne,\" which is recorded in the Barton Papers, a dispute arose about the disbursement of the money from the sale of the estate. In the law suit, Patience stated, \"Being desirous to have the affairs of the estate finally adjusted, she authorized and empowered Ebenezer Jaynes to go to New York, adjust said estate, collect money due her as widow, sell the lands, and bring to her in this county, the money due her as widow, and that portion which was due her as heir of her son, Jonathan, now deceased. That, Ebenezer Jaynes left in 1836 or 37, went to New York, sold her interest in her husband's lands, and collected other moneys to amount, not exceeding $800, and since his return refused to account to her or pay her the money.\"\n\nIn a paper filed in Pendleton County, April 6, 1839, Ebenezer Jaynes stated, \"He found nothing except the widows dower of 50 acres of land which he sold for $50 for her interest; he also drew $100 for the heirs of Jonathan Eggleston, now deceased, which he is ready to pay to the heirs after deducting their proportion of expenses and money laid out by this respondent (Jaynes) in going to collect same; denies that Patience is the legal heir of Jonathan Eggleston. She refuses to allow respondent anything for his trouble and money laid out.\" His items of expense were listed as: Attorney and clerk preparing and authenticating power of attorney, $800; F. Howell, attorney, $25; $64 laid out in traveling. He further stated that Patience was \"old and insolvent, that at great expense he removed her from Campbell County to Pendleton County, and furnished her with necessaries for some time under the promise that she would pay when she drew the money.\"\n\nAfter many depositions taken from family and neighbors over the next few months, there was never an order filed that could be found in records to show that Patience ever received any of the money from the estate of her late husband.\n\nSecond Generation\n\nFamily of Amos EGGLESTON Sr (1) & Patience BENNETT\n\n2. Samuel EGELSTON. Born in 1770 in Steuben, NY. Samuel died in Kenton Co KY in 1815, he was 45. Buried in Campbell Co. KY. In 1792 when Samuel was 22, he married Hannah TRIPP, in PA. They had the following children:\n\ni. Hannah (1794-)\n\nii. Lydia (1799-1856)\n\niii. Benjamin (1799-)\n\niv. Jacob Warner (1802-)\n\nv. Charles Martin (1807-1872)\n\nvi. William (~1808-)\n\nvii. Silas Wheeler (1809-)\n\nviii. Sarah (~1810-)\n\nix. Amos I. (~1811-1852)\n\nx. Mary (>1811-)\n\nxi. Clarissa (1815-1906)\n\nSamuel and Hannah were married in Pennsylvania but settled in Stueben Co. NY where his parents lived. They are listed on the 1810 Stueben Co. NY Census Records living in Bath Township. They are also listed in the Steuben County Court Records involving the following land transactions: (1) 20 Aug 1802, Samuel purchased 50 acres of land from Nicholas and Alice Lowe in Township 5, lot 10, Crooked Lake, Steuben Co. NY. Witness to the transaction was Thomas Cooper. (2) 24 Mar 1813, Samuel sold his land to David A. Bailey. Witness to the sale was Amos Egleston and Abraham Covenhagen. Signed by George McClure, Judge of the Court of Common Law, Steuben Co. NY. They emigrated to Campbell Co. KY soon after that. About six months later, Samuel's father died in NY and his widowed mother and several of his siblings soon joined him and his family in KY. The area where they settled later became a part of Kenton Co. KY when it was created in 1840. Samuel died two years later.\n\nMuch of the information on the family of Samuel was provided by Janet Egelston Haddock who published a book entitled \"Pioneer Voices\" in 1979 which traces the family line of Samuel, her gg-grandfather. She generously loaned me her book so that I could copy it, which I greatly appreciate. It is well written and beautifully prepared with a lot of pictures, letters, and other documents.\n\n3. Rachel EGGLESTON. Born on 4 Jul 1776 in PA. Rachel died in Sanilac Co. MI on 7 Jun 1857, she was 80. Buried in Wixson Cemetery, Worth Township, Sanilac Co. MI. On 14 Oct 1798 when Rachel was 22, she married Joshua E. WIXSON, son of Solomon WIXSON (10 Aug 1752-11 Apr 1813) & Mary RANDALL (abt 1752-9 Oct 1837), in NY. Born on 8 Sep 1780 in Dutchess Co. NY. Joshua E. died in Pickering, Ontario Canada on 31 Dec 1850, he was 70. Buried in Claremont Baptist Church Yard, Claremont, Pickering Co. Ontario, Canada. They had the following children:\n\ni. Amos (1799-1882)\n\nii. Asa (1801-1870)\n\niii. Joel (1803-1883)\n\niv. Azor (1805-1864)\n\nv. Ruth (1807-1900)\n\nvi. John (1808-1858)\n\nvii. Joshua E. (1810-)\n\nviii. Rachel (1813-1813)\n\nix. Rachel E. (1814-)\n\nx. Solomon (1817-)\n\nxi. Benjamin (1820-1876)\n\nThe following information is from the book \"Places in Ontario\" by Nick and Helma Mika, page 426: \"Pioneers of the area were the Wixson brothers, Joseph and Joshua, Americans who came from Steuben County at the close of the 18th century. Closely involved with the Baptist Church, the brothers took an active roll in the political and religious life of the community. Joshua was voted Elder of the first Baptist Church of Christ in the township and services were held in his house. A Baptist church was built at Claremont in 1851, a year after Joshua Wixson's death. It was replaced in 1866 and this house of worship is still being used today.\"\n\nAccording to a tradition of the family, Joshua moved to Canada under peculiar circumstances. He aided in the escape of a person fleeing the State of New York to avoid payment of debt by carrying the passenger in his wagon several miles. The law at the time was such that a person lending assistance, even though innocent in so doing, which enabled a person to escape from his debts then became responsible for the debts. It then became necessary for Joshua to also flee from the State of New York because he did not have the means to take care of the indebted obligation placed upon him because of his act of kindness. Many years later he returned from Canada with small sacks of gold coin which were hidden in different parts of his clothing, and paid the debts, thereby clearing his name and his conscience.\n\nIn 1804, Joshua and his family arrived in Canada and settled on the land cleared by his brother Joseph who had received a land grant in Pickering Township in 1802. Joshua and his family attended the First Baptist Church in Markham, formed around 1816.\n\nJoshua was a deeply religious person, and having been a minister in his native home, subscribed to the Baptists' belief that only an adult has the ability to choose the Church through baptism. His views were also fundamental and his was a Biblical literalist. Even all of his children bore Biblical names. He held to his beliefs steadfastly and was a natural leader and orator.\n\nThe Baptists did not have an easy time in the early years in Upper Canada. Since their separation from the Church of England two hundred years earlier, Baptists had fled religious oppression often. Refuge was found in the Netherlands, and then in the North American colonies. In Upper Canada though, there was distrust among the ruling British families of the immigrant \"Americans\" and their non-Anglican ways. Not until 1799 were the first non-Anglican ministers legally allowed to perform marriages. In religious circles there was also conflict. The leader of the First Anglican Parish in York, John Strachan, often sided against non-Anglicans on religious and political issues. When war broke out between the British and the United States in 1812, Strachan even suspected non-Anglicans of sedition and disloyalty. The Baptists often felt pressure, struggling to define themselves in the colonial culture. Joshua dealt with these pressures by espousing strict adherence to Biblical doctrine, putting him at odds with his parish pastor in Markham. During the summer of 1821, one of the members of the Markham church was excommunicated for some wrongdoing. According to the church records, the man repented and made confession of his fault, but to no avail. Many members of the church agreed that the man should be readmitted into the church, and so Joshua pleaded on the man's behalf. Trouble had actually been brewing between Joshua and the pastor for some time because Joshua claimed the paster should not receive a salary because it is unscriptual. The pastor waited until Joshua was not present at a meeting and then excluded him from the defence of the former church brother. He also excluded Joshua's wife Rachel and son Amos for supporting Joshua on the salary issue. The church record actually reads as follows: \"Saturday, August 4th, 1821, were separated from the First Baptist Church, Markham, Three: Joshua Wixon, Rachel Wixon, and Amos Wixon for the crime of Heresy, causing confusion in the church, and disorderly walk.\" The parish was in an uproar. None of the three were present to respond to the charges. Contrary to Baptist principles, no committee was appointed to interview them, and no forum for defense was provided. The pastor declared Amos and Rachel to be \"ignorant persons, and at length ordered to a total silence.\" By the next meeting for services in September, 16 others were excluded for not voting for the expulsion of the former three. The church had been torn apart. In all, 20 persons left the Markham Church - eight were Wixsons: Joushua and Rachel, their children Amos, Asa, Joel, and Ruth, his brother Joseph's wife Deborah, and nephew Randal. Amos' wife Elizabeth also joined them.\n\nSo the group of twenty formed a new church called the First Baptist Church of Christ in Pickering on 27 Oct 1821. Their meetings were conducted in each other homes, as it was still a sparsely populated area. At first, their petition to form a new parish was denied, yet they continued to meet. Eventually the group settled on two elders - Joshua Wixson and his nephew Randal, and two deacons - Cornelius Johnson and Johaua's son Joel Wixson, with Joshua's wife Rachel as the clerk. The parish in the wilderness administered to its members as any full Baptist church would. Adults were baptized into membership upon a profession of faith. They practiced full immersion during baptism, and the washing of feet before Communion. Members were censured or excluded for acting against the church. One of the original members, Casper Kile, was excluded within the first year for drunkenness and allowing frolicking in his house. For a time the church met in a school house in Whitechurch Township, and also in the town of Uxbridge. Usually they were to be found at Joshua's house or in the nearby school house, depending on the size of the gathering.\n\nJoshua continued to acquire land in the area, receiving grants or making purchases about every two years, mostly within the 7th and 8th concessions of Pickering Township, but there was one property he owned in Brock.\n\nIn March of 1850, Joshua and the church members agreed to purchase three-quarters of an acre of land at seven pounds, ten shillings from Joseph Wixson. They would build a plank chapel 28 feet wide and 34 feet long. Construction of the new church was begin, but in December of that year, Joshua died and never saw completion of his parish's church which became known as Claremont Baptist Church. He was buried beside the church.\n\nAfter the death of her husband, Rachel moved to Sanilac Co. Michigan. Minutes of the Clarement Baptist Church of Pickering, Ontario, Canada, Rachel was \"removed\" from the church in June 1851, meaning she as moved away from the community.\n\n4. Benjamin EGLESTON. Born on 13 Jan 1781 in NY. Benjamin died in Steuben Co. NY on 14 Mar 1846, he was 65. Buried in Shuart Cemetery, Pulteney, Steuben Co NY. On 7 Sep 1805 when Benjamin was 24, he married Sally HYATT, in Steuben Co. NY. Born on 2 May 1788 in NJ. Sally died in Steuben Co. NY on 2 Nov 1879, she was 91. Buried in Shuart Cemetery, Pulteney, Steuben Co NY. They had the following children:\n\ni. Jehiel Charles (1806-1879)\n\nii. Mary (1808-1846)\n\niii. Patience (1810-1854)\n\niv. Amos (1810-1901)\n\nv. Thomas (1814-1877)\n\nvi. Stephen N. (1816-1887)\n\nvii. Ira Hyatt (1818-1892)\n\nviii. Joshua (1820-1890)\n\nix. David (1822-1895)\n\nx. James K. (1825-1846)\n\nxi. Louisa (1827-1873)\n\nxii. Esther (1830-1874)\n\nSome of the information for Benjamin's family comes from Steuben Co. NY Census Records and from Cemetery Records recorded for Shuart Cemetery located in Steuben Co. NY. In February, 2004, Dean Gilbert, a descendant of Benjamin sent me a much more detailed record of Benjamin's family. The information was compiled by Dean's cousin, Elaine McKeen. Benjamin's birthdate is calculated by using the inscription on his gravestone which reads: \"Benjamin Eggleston, died March 14, 1864, aged 65 years, 2 months, 1 day.\" Benjamin and Sarah are listed on the 1810 Steuben Co. NY Census Rcords living near his parents in Pulteney Township. They are listed with 2 females under 10 years of age and 1 male under 10 years of age. When his mother moved west to Kentucky with several of her children after the death of her husband, Benjamin and his family stayed in Steuben Co. NY.\n\nSally's birthdate is calculated from the inscription on her tomestone which reads: \"Sally, wife of Benjamin, died Nov. 2, 1879, aged 91 years, 6 months.\" Sally is listed as the head of the household on the 1850 Steuben Co. NY Census Records. Her birth place on that census is listed as NJ. Living with her is a female, Hetty Eggleston, age 20.\n\n5. Ephriam EGGLESTON. Born in 1784 in NY or CT. Ephriam died in probably in Schyler Co. IL aft 8 Mar 1864, he was 80.\n\nEphriam's name appears in \" History of Steuben County, New York\" , by Guy McMasters, published in 1853, Chapter VII, as one of the earliest settlers in the town of Pulteney. He moved to Kentucky with his mother after the death of his father in Steuben Co. NY in 1813. He paid taxes in Campbell Co. KY in 1815. He and his second wife, Clarissa, moved to Schyler Co. IL in the spring of 1823. They are listed on the 1850 Schyler Co. IL Census, Camden Township. The listing includes the following: Ephriam Eggleston, age 66, born in PA; Clarissa Eggleston, age 59, born in PA; Willie Eggleston, age 28; born in IL; and Eliza Eggleston, age 19, born in IL.\n\nEphriam first married Sally KNAPP. They had the following children:\n\ni. Unknown (1824-)\n\nii. Unknown\n\nBefore 1823 when Ephriam was 39, he second married Clarisa [BLACK], in Campbell Co. KY. Born in 1791 in PA. They had the following children:\n\ni. William (1824-)\n\nii. Eliza (~1831-)\n\n6. Abigail \"Abbie\" EGGLESTON. Born on 3 Jul 1788 in Steuben, NY. Abigail \"Abbie\" died in Sanilac Co. MI on 22 Mar 1852, she was 63. Buried in Wixson Cemetery, Worth Township, Sanilac Co. MI. About 1807 when Abigail \"Abbie\" was 18, she married John WIXSON, son of Solomon WIXSON (10 Aug 1752-11 Apr 1813) & Mary RANDALL (abt 1752-9 Oct 1837), in Steuben Co. NY. Born on 4 Jul 1784 in Dutchess Co. NY. John died in Washington Township, Sanilac Co. MI on 8 Apr 1867, he was 82. Buried in Wixson Cemetery, Worth Township, Sanilac Co. MI. They had the following children:\n\ni. Dorcas (1808-1895)\n\nii. Joseph (1810-1857)\n\niii. John (1812-1899)\n\niv. Solomon (1815-1816)\n\nv. Mary (1817-1892)\n\nvi. Elizabeth (1819-1898)\n\nvii. Daniel (1822-1891)\n\nviii. Benjamin (1824->1900)\n\nix. Rachel (1827-1904)\n\nx. Abigail (1829-1908)\n\nThis family first settled in Wayne Township, Steuban Co. NY. They moved, first to Canada , then to Sanilac Co. Michigan They are listed on the 1850 Sanilac Co. MI Census, Worth Township, household # 291. The listing includes the following: John Wickson, age 67, born in NY; Abigail Wickson, age 62, born in PA; and Rachel Wickson, age 22, born in NY. John was a Baptist minister like his brothers Joshua. and Solomon.\n\n7. Deborah EGGLESTON. Born in 1790 in Steuben, NY. Deborah died in Morgan, Pendleton Co KY on 25 Nov 1864, she was 74. Buried in Morgan, Pendleton Co KY. Deborah first married Abraham COVENHAVEN. They had the following children:\n\ni. UNNAMED\n\nii. Rebecca Ann\n\nDeborah second married Ebenezer JAYNE, son of David JAYNE & Elizabeth [JAYNE]. Born abt 1787. Ebenezer died in Pendleton Co. KY in 1860, he was 73. They had the following children:\n\ni. Samuel Egelston (1816-)\n\nii. Alexander (1819-)\n\niii. Deborah Melvina (1821-)\n\niv. Amos Dewitt (1831-)\n\nEbenezer went to NY in 1837 with a power of attorney from his mother-in-law, Patience Eggleston, and his brother-in-law, Amos Eggleston Jr. to settle the estate of Amos Eggleston Sr. He sold the Eggleston family land in Steuben, NY to Henry Schoonhaven for $250. He was also representing his stepdaughter Rebecca Ann Tomlin in the estate of her late father. He was gone almost a year and when he returned, he refused to turn the money over to Patience, instead, he sued her for \"her keep and that of her son, Jonathan,\" when they first arrived in Kentucky. Patience sued him in 1839 to recover the money, but she never received any. (See Barton Papers) The date of Ebenezer's death is recorded in a biography of his son, Samuel, that appeared in the \"History of Scotland Co. Missouri\"\n\n8. Sarah Sally EGGLESTON. Born abt 1791 in Steuben, NY. Between 1810-1815 when Sarah Sally was 19, she married Samuel LOWE, in Steuben Co. NY. Born abt 1780. The marriage date for Sarah and Samuel is calculated from the 1810 Steuben Co. NY Census records which list Sarah as still living in the household with her parents and a court document dated 17 Apr 1815 recorded in the Steuben Co. NY Court Records dealing with the estate of Amos Eggleston, Dec. This document was signed by Samuel Lowe and his wife Sarah.\n\nI've never been able to find any conclusive information about the children of Sarah and Samuel. Since they \"disappeared\" from the New York area about the same time as Sarah's mother, Patience, and some of her siblings moved west to Kentucky, it is believed that Sarah and Samuel may have also moved west too. There are several Lowes in Pendleton County in the early 1830s to 1850s who could be their children, but I can find no proof of that.\n\n9. Amos EGGLESTON/EGELSTON. Born on 25 Nov 1794 in Steuben Co. NY. Amos died in Pendleton Co. KY on 13 Jan 1853, he was 58. Buried in Pendleton Co KY, but the exact location has not been found. On 24 Sep 1817 when Amos was 22, he married Amanda STREETER, daughter of Jonathan STREETER (abt 1766-20 Aug 1826) & Hannah BARRETT (1776-15 Mar 1851), in Campbell Co. KY. Born on 31 Mar 1799 in Armstrong Co PA. Amanda died in Pendleton Co KY bef 17 Mar 1863, she was 63. Buried in Pendleton Co KY, but the exact location has not been found. They had the following children:\n\ni. Asa Baret (1818-1897)\n\nii. Patience (1820-<1849)\n\niii. Jonathan Streeter (1822-1876)\n\niv. Ebenezar Jayne (1823-1909)\n\nv. James (1828-1851)\n\nvi. Samuel Lowe (1829-1880)\n\nvii. Hannah Jane (1833-1849)\n\nviii. Amos Nelson (1835-<1853)\n\nix. George Washington (1836-1923)\n\nx. Joseph (1837-<1853)\n\nxi. John William (1839->1872)\n\nxii. Amanda Elizabeth (1844-1919)\n\nIn the early years of his life, Amos used the traditional spelling of \"Eggleston\" for his last name. However, in the later years he changed the spelling to \"Egelston\". Amos and Amanda are listed in the 1830 Campbell Co. KY Census. They are listed in the 1840 and 1850 Pendleton Co. KY Census records.\n\nAmos and Amanda along with his mother Patience and his sister, Deborah Jaynes were four of the six persons who were founders of the Short Creek Baptist Church in Pendelton Co. KY, Oct. 4, 1833. They met in a log school house for 7 years before they were able to build a church on land donated by Amos. The cost of building the new church was about $15 with most of the material and labor being donated. Amos was the first deacon of the church being ordained in 1837, and later served as pastor from 1849 to 1852. Short Creek Baptist Church has been in continuous service to the rural community since its formation in 1832. The present church is located a few miles away from the first church.\n\nThe disposition of the estate of Amos Egelston Jr. is recorded in the Barton Papers. Amanda signed a document stating: This is to certify that I do not wish to administer on the estate of my husband Amos Egelston, Decd, but wish the court to appoint one of my sons, either Asa B. Egelston, Ebenezer J. Egelston, or Samuel L. Egelston admr as it may suit them best. Given my hand Feb. 7, 1853. (Signed) Amanda Egelston Witness: Wm Green Samuel L. Egelston On March 7, 1853, the court appointed Ebenezer J. Egelston as Admr of the estate of Amos Egelston, deceased.\n\nAmanda is listed in the 1860 Pendleton Co. KY Census with her two children, John H. age 19, and Amanda E. age 15. She is listed in household # 401. Living in household #400 is her son, Ebenezer and Louisa Egelston and family; living in household #402 is her son, George W. and Nancy Jane Egelston and family; living in household #403 is her nephew, Alexander and Sophonia Jaynes; and living in household #404 is her sister-in-law, Deborah Jaynes.\n\nThe disposition of the estate of Amanda Streeter Egelston is recorded in the Barton Papers with her son, Jonathan Streeter Egelston as Administrator. An appraisement was made by J.W.A. Monroe and Wm Gulick and presented by Jonathan S. Egelston, Admr. on March 17, 1863. The household goods, a bee stand, and livestock including hogs, sheep, a mare, a dozen chickens, were offered for sale. A report on the sale was made on Oct. 1, 1863 with the items sold for $145.05. On Dec. 17, 1863, expenses against the estate were turned in to the court. They included F. W. Minturn, $20.30 for coffin & box and trimmings for same; J. W. Monroe, $1.00 for appraisal; Lonzo DeCoursey, $1.44 for thrashing 24 bushel of wheat; Milton Ewing, $2.00 for altering two colts; J. M. Curry, $9.55 for Pendleton County taxes for 1859, 1860, 1861, and 1862; M. K. Applegate, $6.52 for 1863 and 1864 Pendleton County taxes; John E. Records, $5.00 for atty fee; Henry D. Hauser, $3.95 for Clerk fees for Court Order appointing Admn; Dr. J.B.A. Rusk $10.75 for five visits and medicine; Allowance to Admn, $20.00; Judges fee $1.50; for a total expenses against the estate of $91.17. Subtracting the expenses from the amount of the sale of goods left a balance of $53.88 for distribution. The land belonging to Amos and Amanda located along a bend in Short Creek was surveyed on Sept. 20, 1869 by A.E. Ames and divided into 5 lots. A map of the division of Land is included in the Barton Papers. Lot 1 contained 50 acres and was to be divided between Asa B. Eggleston, Jonathan S. Eggleston, Samuel L. Eggleston, Amanda Bellew, and Patience Paynes heirs. Lot 2 contained 15 acres and was given to George W. Eggleston. Lot 3 contained 15 acres and was given to Sarah J. Eggleston, daughter of the deceased James Eggleston. Lot 4 contained 15 acres and was given to William W. Eggleston. Lot 5 contained 15 acres and was given to Ebenezer Eggleston. A Petition for division of the property was filed in Pendleton County Court on Sept. 6, 1869 by W. J. Perrin, Atty.\n\n10. Jonathan EGGLESTON. Born in 1798 in Steuben, NY. Jonathan died in Pendleton Co. KY in 1832, he was 34. Buried in Pendleton Co KY, exact location not known.\n\nJonathan never married, however he bacame the center of attention, after his death, in the law suit, \"Patience Eggleston vs Ebenezer Jaynes,\" filed in Pendleton County in 1838, where a claim was made that he was married at the time of his death and was the father of 2 or 3 children. The issue was of importance because of the dispositon of $100 collected on behalf of Jonathan from the estate of his late father by Ebenezer Jaynes. Amos Jr. stated in his deposition in the case that \"I asked him (Jonathan) about it (whether he had a wife and children), but he denied ever being married to her; that he lived with a woman a while and she had a child, but he said it was none of his.\" (It is never stated in the Barton Papers who the woman was that Jonathan was supposed to have married).\n\n11. Joseph EGGLESTON. Born abt 1799 in Steuben, NY. Joseph died. Joseph married Nancy [EGGLESTON]. Born abt 1800 in OH. Nancy died. They had the following children:\n\ni. John L. (~1828-)\n\nii. Benjamin (~1832-)\n\niii. William (~1834-)\n\niv. Joseph (~1836-)\n\nv. Henry H. (~1841-)\n\nNOTE: I am not absolutely certain that this Joseph Eggleston is the son of Amos and Patience (Bennett) Eggleston, but his age and place of birth fit, as well as the fact that earlier research indicates that \"Joseph Eggleston went west\" also fits. LKLC\n\nThe Eggleston Family of Pendleton County Kentucky\n\nPart II: Descendants of Amos Egelston & Amanda Streeter\n\nBy Linda Kaye (Cope) Lanier\n\nAmos and Amanda (Streeter) Egelston were my gg-grandparents.

MO Census living in Lyon Township with their son George. Their son William is living nearby in another household.\n\n4. Jonathan Streeter EGELSTON. Born in 1822 in Short Creek, Pendleton Co. KY. Jonathan Streeter died in Coles Co. IL on 1 Dec 1876, he was 54. On 16 Jan 1843 when Jonathan Streeter was 21, he married Lucy MONROE, daughter of Alexander MONROE (1794-1833) & Anna [MONROE], in Pendleton Co. KY. Born abt 1822 in KY.

Jonathan's parents and Lucy's parents were four of the six charter members of the church. The other two charter members were Jonathan's grandmother, Patience Eggleston, and his aunt, Deborah Jaynes.\n\nJonathan and his family moved to Illinois in 1868. He is listed on the 1870 Coles Co. IL Census in Charleston Township, p. 30b.\n\n5. Ebenezar Jayne EGELSTON. Born on 14 Nov 1823 in Short Creek, Pendleton Co. KY. Ebenezar Jayne died in Pendleton Co KY in 1909, he was 85. Buried in Gardenersville Cemetery, Pendleton Co KY. On 5 Aug 1848 when Ebenezar Jayne was 24, he married Louisa PAYNE, daughter of Gaius PAYNE & Mary \"Polly\" GLAVES, in Pendleton Co KY.

(1857-)\n\n34 iv. Mary B. \"Mollie\" (~1860-)\n\n35 v. Martha (~1863-)\n\nA bond for the marriage of Ebenezer J. Egelston to marry Louisa Payne, daughter of Mary Payne, was filed in Pendleton County, KY Jan. 18, 1848. Security for the marriage bond was made by Ebenezer J. Egelston and Uriel S. Payne. Urial Payne is Louisa's brother. Her father, Gaius Payne died in 1846, and he appointed Urial Payne as executor of his estate, whereby he was instructed to care for \"my wife and two youngest daughters, Louisa and Elvira.\" Urial Payne was also Ebenezer J. Egelston's brother-in-law, having married Ebenezer's sister, Patience Egelston, in 1844. Ebenezer is listed on the 1880 Census on page 449 living next to his sister, Amanda Elizabeth Egelston and her husband William Belew. Living with Ebenezer is his son, James; and his daughters, Mary \"Mollie\" with her husband, T. P. Mullins; and Martha, with her husband, Thomas Wiley.\n\nEbenezer lived in Pendleton Co. KY his entire life. He and Louisa are listed on the 1850 Census with no children. They are listed on 1860 Census with 4 children, William S., age 7; Julia A., age 5; James C.B., age 3; and Mary B., age 9 months. They are listed on the 1870 Census with 4 children, Julia, James, Mary, & Martha.\n\nEbenezer's name is mentioned numerous times in the Barton Papers. (1) Feb. 25, 1851, Ebenezer signed a note with his father to pay to John Ambler, $300 for 250 acres of land. He gave 25 acres to his brother, Jonathan Egelston, and 50 acres to his father, Amos Egelston. The note was to be paid by March 1, 1854. (2) He was appointed by the Pendleton Co. KY Courts to be the administrator of his father's estate on March 7, 1853. (3) He was bondsman for the marriage certificate for his brother, George Washington Egelston, to Nancy (Riley) Egelston. Nancy was the widow of James Egelston, brother of Ebenezer and George. (4) From a single page entitled \"Ebenezer Eggelston\" is the listing for his four children, Julia, James, Mollie, and Martha with the names of their spouses. This information was provided to Mr. Barton by Wm. Alvin Reed of Sterling, Colorado, on June 4, 1938. (5) From a page entitled, \"Egelston Gravestones in Gardnersville Cemetery\", listed is the following information: \"Ebenezer Egelston, lived in Pendleton Co., daughter Julia married Wm. Reed, born near Falmouth.\"\n\n6. James EGELSTON. Born in 1828 in Short Creek, Pendleton Co. KY. James died in Pendleton Co KY in 1851, he was 23. On 5 Nov 1850 when James was 22, he married Nancy Jane RILEY, daughter of Alfred E. RILEY (29 Mar 1807-15 Jan 1877) & Rachel WIGGINS (7 Jan 1811-13 Jul 1890), in Pendleton Co KY. Born on 22 Oct 1835 in Riley's Incline, Campbell Co. KY. Nancy Jane died in Tarr Ridge, Menifee Co. KY on 27 Aug 1903, she was 67. Buried in Egelston Cemetery, Tarr Ridge, Menifee Co. KY. They had one child:\n\n36 i. Sarah J. (1851-1898)\n\nA consent bond from Alfred Riley for James Egelston to marry his daughter was filed in Pendleton County, KY on Nov. 5, 1850. It reads as follows: To the honorable clerk of Pendleton County, this is to certify I am willing for James Egelston to marry my daughter Nancy Jane Riley. Witnesses: A.B. Egelston and Amos Egelston\" James died just one year after his marriage to Nancy Jane. Six years later Nancy Jane married James brother, George Washington Egelston.\n\n7. Samuel Lowe EGELSTON. Born on 5 Dec 1829 in Short Creek, Pendleton Co. KY. Samuel Lowe died in Monroe Co. MO on 29 Apr 1880, he was 50. Buried in Meals Cemetery, located 4 miles west of Madison on Highway 24 and one half mile south, Monroe Co. MO. On 20 Jan 1853 when Samuel Lowe was 23, he first married Louisa E. GREEN, daughter of Nathaniel GREEN (1797-bef 1860) & Nancy COLLINS (1801-), in Pendleton Co KY. Born in 1835 in Grant Co. KY. Louisa E. died in Monroe Co. MO on 17 Feb 1876, she was 41. Buried in Meals Cemetery, located 4 miles west of Madison on Highway 24 and one half mile south, Monroe Co. MO. They had the following children:\n\n37 i. Josiah Franklin (1853-1912)\n\n38 ii. Louisa J. (1856-)\n\n39 iii. Robert Jefferson (1858-1906)\n\n40 iv. James A. (~1867-)\n\n41 v. Rosetta (1869-)\n\n42 vi. Walter S. (1871-)\n\nAbout 1877 when Samuel Lowe was 47, he second married Miranda Ann JAMES, in Monroe Co. MO. Born in 1841 in KY. They had one child:\n\n43 i. Asa Baret (1878-1946)\n\nNo absolute proof has yet been found to support this marriage; however, other records do indicate that Miranda was the second wife of Samuel Egelston. The 1870 Monroe Co. MO Census lists Samuel and his wife Louisa with 5 children ranging in age from 3-18. The 1880 Monroe Co. MO Census lists James A. Egelston, age 14, living in the household of Asmond Brownfield, and then lists Miranda Egelston, age 39, a widow born in KY, with a son Asa, age 2, born in MO. Samuel's other two sons, Josiah and Jeff, ages 25 and 22, are listed in nearby Marion Co. MO living in the household of L.F. Watts where they are listed as laborers. Family history of Asa indicates he was the youngest of six children and that his father died when he was very young. So this seems like a possible situation. Research is still being done to validate this. NOTE: 2 Mar 2004, This writer found a record in the LDS file on the family of Josiah Franklin Egelston submitted by two of his descendants. In the record is the listing that Josiah's father, Samuel Egelston, married a second time to Miranda Ann James. No date is given for the marriage, but since his first wife, Louisa died in 1876 and since Asa Baret was born in 1878, then the marriage was probably about 1877. Research needs to be done to try to determine who Miranda married a second time (the step-father with whom Asa Baret told his children he could not get along with).\n\nSamuel is listed on the 1850 Pendleton Co. KY Census with his parents. This witer is still searching for Samuel on the 1860 Census. He must have been living somewhere in Missouri at that time because all succeeding census records for the third child of Samuel and Louisa, Robert Jefferson Egelston, is listed as having been born in Missouri in 1858. Samuel and Louisa are listed on the 1870 Monroe Co. MO Census record, p. 712 with five children, Josiah 16, born in KY; Louisa J. 14, born in KY; Jeff 12, born in MO; James A. 3, born in MO; and Rosetta 7 months, born in MO.\n\nSamuel's name is recorded in Pendleton Co. KY Court Records in the following:\n\n1) February 22, 1853, page 26, Samuel signed a note with his brother, James, and his father, Amos, for $20.13 to B. Lancaster.\n\n2) March 7, 1853, Samuel and his brother-in-law, William Green, witnessed a statement made by his mother, Amanda, that she did not wish to be administrator of her husband's estate and ask that the court appoint one of her sons, either, Asa, Ebenezer, or Samuel as Administrator. The court appointed Ebenezer.\n\n3) October 3, 1853, page 26, in the matter of the settlement of the estate of James Egelston, Samuel signed as a witness to the transaction of the payment of bills owed by James and some money that was paid to the estate on outstanding notes.\n\n4) April 22, 1863, Jonathan S. Egelston, whom the court had appointed as \"committee\" to care for his brother J.W. M. Egelston, a lunitic, filed suit against his siblings, including Samuel, for a distribution of the property of the estate of Amos and Amanda Egelston to include a 1/9 portion for their brother, J.W.M. Egelston, so that he could get him committed to an asylum.\n\n5) April 30, 1868, page 373, in the matter of the settlement of J.W.M. Egelston, (brother of Samuel) into an asylum in Hopkinsville, KY by A. B. Egelston, the document states that his brothers, Jonathan Streeter Egelston and Samuel Lowe Egelston, whose names were mentioned in 1863 legal suit had since moved \"out-of-state\", and that A.B. Egelston and his brother George Washington Egelston had taken over the matter of caring of J.W.M. Egelston and his settlement into an asylum.\n\nFrom the 1860 and 1870 Census records this writer discovered that several siblings of Louisa (Green) Egelston had moved from Kentucky to Missouri, and it would appear that Samuel and Louisa decided to make to move \"west\" along with her siblings. That is one reason that not much info on Samuel had been discovered for many years, because back in Kentucky, family information did not mention where Samuel and Louisa had moved to, it simply said, \"they went west.\"\n\nSadly, both Samuel and Louisa died at fairly young ages, leaving young children to make their on way in life. Their three oldest sons, Josiah, age 26; Robert, age 22; and James, age 14 became farm laborers and lived in the households of their employers; their daughter, Louisa, age 25, was probably married but as yet nothing has been discovered about her since the 1870 Census; their daughter, Rosetta, is still also a mystery. Samuel married for a second time after the death of Louisa to Miranda James and they had child, Asa Baret. It appears that Asa Baret, an infant of two years old when his father died, and his half-brother, Walter, (youngest child of Samuel and Louisa who was four years old when his mother died) were raised by Samuel's second wife, Miranda.\n\n8. Hannah Jane EGELSTON. Born in 1833. Hannah Jane died in 1849, she was 16.\n\n9. Amos Nelson EGELSTON. Born in 1835. Amos Nelson died bef 1853, he was 18.\n\n10. George Washington EGELSTON. Born on 17 Nov 1836 in Short Creek, Pendleton Co. KY. George Washington died in Keifer, Creek Co. OK on 18 Sep 1923, he was 86. Buried in Egelston Cemetery, Tarr Ridge, Menifee Co. KY. On 29 Aug 1856 when George Washington was 19, he first married Nancy Jane RILEY, daughter of Alfred E. RILEY (29 Mar 1807-15 Jan 1877) & Rachel WIGGINS (7 Jan 1811-13 Jul 1890), in Pendleton Co. KY. Born on 22 Oct 1835 in Riley's Incline, Campbell Co. KY. Nancy Jane died in Tarr Ridge, Menifee Co. KY on 27 Aug 1903, she was 67. Buried in Egelston Cemetery, Tarr Ridge, Menifee Co. KY. They had the following children:\n\n44 i. Rachel A. (1857-)\n\n45 ii. Amos Frank (1858-1941)\n\n46 iii. Alfred (1863-1913)\n\n47 iv. Mary Elizabeth \"Molly\" (1864-1951)\n\n48 v. Robert L. (1866->1930)\n\n49 vi. Louis (1868-1942)\n\n50 vii. Rosetta Ellen (1873-1961)\n\n51 viii. Edwin (1876-1943)\n\nOn 12 Jun 1907 when George Washington was 70, he second married Nancy RADER, in Menifee Co. KY. Born abt 1846 in KY.\n\nGeorge and Nancy are listed on the 1850-1870 Census records of Pendleton Co. KY. Sometime between 1870 and 1876 they moved to Menfee Co. KY. This is evident by two facts - (1) that they were listed on the 1870 Pendleton Co. KY Census, (2) the birth of their son, Edwin, born 8 Oct 1876, is listed in the Menifee Co. KY Birth Records. They are listed on the 1880 and 1900 Census records of Menifee Co. KY. On the 1900 Menifee Co. KY Census, it shows that they were the parents of 11 children, 8 of them living. I have no record of the three children who had died before 1900. It is presumed that they probably died at birth.\n\nGeorge is listed numerous times in the Index To Deeds in Menifee County, KY. His land purchases include the following transactions:\n\n1) 12 Aug 1879, 100 acres on Indian Creek from James P. Magowan\n\n2) 16 Aug 1879, 67 acres on Dry Fork from Levi Hale\n\n3) 30 Jan 1892, 75 acres on Clifton Creek from Shelby Cannoy\n\n4) 27 Jan 1904, 70 acres on Fletcher Ridge from Edgar L. Smallwood\n\n5) 1 Apr 1904, 46 acres on Fletcher Ridge from John Hale\n\n6) 24 Feb 1906, 40 acres on E. Fork of Indian Creek from E.E. Cope\n\n7) 24 Feb 1906, 100 acres on Indian Creek from William Branham\n\n8) 10 Aug 1908, 40 acres on Macausey Ridge from W.M. Stull & wife\n\n9) 11 Oct 1907, 45 acres on Adams Branch from G.W. McCormick & wife\n\nOther records in the Index to Deeds, Menifee County, KY indicate that he sold the following property:\n\n1) 5 Dec 1890, 67 acres on Glady Creek sold to Alfred Egelston\n\n2) 28 Aug 1905, 46 acres on Fletcher Ridge to E.S. Egelston\n\nNancy and George were active members of Short Creek Baptist Church in Pendleton County. Nancy's father Alfred was the third deacon ordained by the church and he served the church as church clerk for 25 years. George and Nancy Jane and their children moved from Pendleton County to Menifee Co. KY. In 1876. In Menifee County, Jane and George they were active members of the Laurel Springs Baptist Church. The three people who attended the Greenville Association representing Laurel Springs Baptist Church in 1903 were G.W. Egelston (George), Wm. Gipson (William Gibson), and W.E.

We extend our sympathy to the bereaved family. Our loss is her gain.\"\n\nSometime after 1910, George's health began to fail and, he first went to live with his daughter Rosetta and her husband Charlie Clark, then he went to Oklahoma to live with his daughter Mollie Cope.\n\n11.

George Thomas died in 1919, he was 68. They had the following children:\n\n103 i. Ida M. (1879-1963)\n\n104 ii. Lessley (1890-)\n\nAccording to family stories, Sarah and Thomas had other children, but I have never found the names of any other children. If we only had the 1890 Census it would give us the names of other children.\n\nA memo in the Barton Papers dated 11 Apr 1870 by A. Riley, Guardian for Sarah J. Egelston (his granddaughter) stating that 'nothing has come to his hands except the possession of about 15 acres of land about Sept 1869.' Another memo dated 18 May 1872 by Alfred Riley Gdn. for Sarah J. Eggleston states ' His ward has no property except 15 acres of land inherited from her grandfather Eggleston. Asa Eggleston now has it in possession and Gdn will collect a reasonable rent.'\n\nThomas and Sarah are listed on the 1880 Pendleton County, Kentucky Census with their daughter Ida. Thomas lists his occupation as a carpenter. They may have moved to Menifee County shortly after her mother and stepfather did, as she was living there when she died. Thomas and Sarahs son, Lessley, is listed on the 1900 Menifee Co.

Josiah Franklin died in Hannibal, Marion Co. MO on 31 Mar 1912, he was 58. On 25 May 1886 when Josiah Franklin was 32, he first married Helena Louise DE LA PORTE, daughter of August DE LA PORT (abt 1822-) & Marguerite \"Margaret\" MARSNEUF (abt 1835-), in Hannibal, Marion Co. MO. Born on 6 Sep 1863 in Hannibal, Marion Co. MO. Helena Louise died in Audrain Co. MO on 26 Jul 1895, she was 31. Buried in Mt. Olivet Cemetery, Audrain Co. MO. They had the following children:\n\n105 i. Ester Rose (1887-1957)\n\n106 ii. Margie L. (1889-1892)\n\n107 iii. Eva R. (1892-1974)\n\n108 iv. Clara (1894-1960)\n\n109 v. George\n\n110 vi. J. C.\n\nOn 21 Jul 1897 when Josiah Franklin was 43, he second married Augusta KOCH, in Audrain Co. MO. Born in Jan 1873 in MO. They had the following children:\n\n111 i. George D. (1898-1941)\n\n112 ii. Everett Francis (1900-)\n\n113 iii. Hazal (1904-1971)\n\nThe death record for Josiahs first wife, Helena, is recorded in Audrain Co. MO records. The record also states \"Mother of George and J.C. Eggleston.\" NOTE: I haven't found any other record of George and J.C. Eggleston. I did find that Josiah named a child by his second wife \"George\", so perhaps the George and J.C. Eggleston died as newborns or as small infants. This theory seems plausable especially since records recently found by this writer in the LDS files that were submitted by Robert William Stevens and Frank Chester Stevens who are descendants of Esther, daughter of Josiah and Helena, list four daughters born to them, but no mention of any sons. This needs further research.\n\nJosiah is listed on the 1870 Monore Co. MO Census records living in the household with his parents. He is listed on the 1880 Marion Co. MO Census with his brother Jeff, living in the household with L.F. Watts, where they are listed as laborers. He is listed on the 1900 Marion Co. MO Census records, living in Ward 4 of Hannibal with his second wife and five children. The record indicates that he has been married to his second wife for three years. His occupation is listed as a blacksmith. He is listed on the 1910 Marion Co. Mo Census as \"Frank Eggleston\" with his wife second wife and six children, Ester 22, Eva 18, Clara 16, George 11, Everett 10, and Hazel 6.\n\n38. Louisa J. EGELSTON. Born on 23 Jul 1856 in Pendleton Co KY. Louisa is listed on the 1870 Monroe Co. MO Census records living with her parents. She is 14 years old. This writer has found nothing on Louisa since 1870. It is presumed that she was married before 1880 and this has made the search for her more difficult, but is continuing.\n\n39. Robert Jefferson EGELSTON. Born on 9 Mar 1858 in MO or KY ? Robert Jefferson died in Hannibal, Marion Co. MO on 3 Nov 1906, he was 48. In 1892 when Robert Jefferson was 33, he married Charlotte Emma \"Augusta\" BODE, in Hannibal, Marion Co. MO. Born in Oct 1855 in Germany. They had the following children:\n\n114 i. Edgar Denman (1892-)\n\n115 ii. Helen E. (1893-1981)\n\n116 iii. Gladys Martha (1897-1970)\n\nJeff is listed on the 1870 Monroe Co. MO Census with his parents. He is listed on the 1880 Marion Co. MO Census at Hannibal, with his brother Josiah, living in the household of L.F. Watts where they are listed as laborers. Marion Co. borders Monroe Co. on the east. He is listed on the 1900 Marion Co. MO Census record with his wife and three children, living in Mason Township, Ward 3, Hannibal. The record indicates that he has been married 8 years. The 1900 Marion Co. MO Census record indicates that Augusta emigrated to America in 1858. The record also indicates that Augusta was the mother of three children, all of them living.\n\n40. James A. EGELSTON. Born abt 1867 in MO. James is listed on the 1870 Monroe Co. MO Census records living with his parents. He is listed on the 1880 Monroe Co. MO Census records living in the household of Osmond Brownfield where he is listed as a laborer. This writer has found nothing on James after 1880, but research is still continuing on him.\n\n41. Rosetta EGELSTON. Born in Nov 1869 in MO. Rosetta is listed on the 1870 Monroe Co. MO Census records living with her parents. She is 7 months old. On the census record it says she was born in Nov. This writer has been seaching census records for 1880 and have found no mention of Rosetta. More research is needed on her.\n\n42. Walter S. EGELSTON. Born in May 1871 in MO. Walter S. married Daisy WARD. Born in 1871 in Mongomery Co. KY. Daisy died in Moberly, Randolph Co. MO in 1932, she was 61. Buried in Antioch Cemetery, located 3 1/2 miles east of Moberly, off HWY 24, Randolph Co. MO. They had no children.\n\nThe only information I have for placing Walter in the family of Samuel and Louisa is the story told by Asa Baret Eggleston of Grant Co. OK to his children and grandchildren about a brother named Walter. Walter is listed on the 1900 Randolph Co. MO Census records living at Sugar Creek Township in Moberly with his wife Daisy. The Census indicates he was born May 1871 in MO. They are also listed on the 1920 Randolph Co. MO Census records living at Moberly. There are no children listed on either census for this couple. The age of Walter would indicate that he was the son of Samuel and Louisa, since he is only 1 year younger than Rosetta. The fact that he lived his entire adult life in Moberly, Randolph Co. MO, which joins Monroe Co. on the west, and that I have not found any other Egelston family anywhere in the area except for Samuel, I feel safe in placing him in this family. Another known fact is that his brothers, Josiah Franklin Egelston and Robert Jefferson Egelston lived their entire adult lives not too many miles away in Hannibal, Marion Co. MO and in Audrain Co. MO.\n\nFamily of Samuel Lowe EGELSTON (7) & Miranda Ann JAMES\n\n43. Asa Baret EGELSTON. Born on 10 Apr 1878 in Madison, Monore Co. MO. Asa Baret died in Pond Creek, Grant Co. OK on 4 Aug 1946, he was 68. Buried in Pond Creek, Grant Co. OK. About 1903 when Asa Baret was 24, he married Gertrude Minnie TINGLER. Born in 1884 in MO. They had the following children:\n\n117 i. Allen Lewis (1905-)\n\n118 ii. Maurietta Elsie (1907-)\n\n119 iii. Leonard E. (1912-)\n\n120 iv. Glen Ivan (1915-)\n\n121 v. Harold Dale \"Jim\" (~1921-)\n\nAsa Baret always told his children and grandchildren that he was the youngest of six children, (it would appear from census records that he was the youngest of seven children; perhaps he actually meant that he was the youngest child and had six siblings), that his father died when he was very young and that his mother remarried. He said that his childhood was a very unhappy one because he had a step-father with whom he could not get along. He said that after he left home that he did not keep in contact with any family other than a brother named Walter. This information was provided by Ron Goldy, great-grandson of Asa Baret. I found Walter Egelston listed on the 1900 Randolph Co. MO Census. (Randolph County borders Monroe County on the west. He was listed as born in MO in 1871. He is also on the 1920 Randolph Co. MO. With this information, it seems likely (1) that Walter was the son of Samuel and Louisa, since he is only 1 year younger than Rosetta and 7 years older than Asa Baret, (2) that Louisa probably died shortly after the birth of Walter, (3) that Samuel married a second time to Miranda and they are the parents of Asa Baret, (4) that Samuel died shortly after the birth of Asa Baret, (5) that Samuel's three older sons left the home of their step-mother and went out on their own to work as laborers for neighboring farmers, and finally (6) that Miranda married a second time to the \"step-father with whom Asa Baret could not get along with\".\n\nAsa Baret is listed on the 1900 Grant Co., Oklahoma Territory Census records as a single man, age 22. He and his wife Gertie are listed on the 1910, 1920, and 1930 Grant Co. OK Census Records, living in Rock Island Township. The 1920 census lists them with four children, Allen born in 1905, Maurietta born in 1907, Leonard E. born in 1912, and Glen born in 1915. The record indicates that all four children were born in Oklahoma. The 1930 census lists a fifth child, Jimmie, age 9. which would indicate that he was born about 1921.\n\nFamily of George Washington EGELSTON (10) & Nancy Jane RILEY\n\n44. Rachel A. EGELSTON. Born on 17 Jun 1857 in Pendleton Co KY. Rachel A. died in Rising Sun, Dearborn Co. Michigan. On 13 Jun 1876 when Rachel A. was 18, she married John L. WADSWORTH, in Pendleton Co KY. Born in Feb 1855.
