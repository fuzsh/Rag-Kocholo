        "text": "AN OUTLINE OF THE EARLY RANSDELLS IN VIRGINIA AND KENTUCKY\n\nRobert P. Moore [e-mail: [email protected]], 176 Valley Rd., Lexington, Ky.40503\n\n[In order to shorten the text below, abbreviations will be used in referring toWestmoreland Co., Va. documents. The early Westmoreland records have beentranscribed, abstracted and published by John F. Dorman and by Sam and RuthSparacio. Dorman has done the earliest deeds and wills and some order books,while the Sparacios have continued the transcription of the deed and will bookswhere Dorman left off. It will be noted that in the early years WestmorelandCo. deeds and wills are all in the same books. These are the abbreviations thatwill be used for the original document books: D&W = Westmoreland Co. Deedsand Wills; WOB = Westmoreland Co. Order Book Transcriptions by Dorman will beabbreviated WDWD and WOBD plus the appropriate book numbers or inclusive years,while the Sparacio transcriptions will be designated by WDWS plus theappropriate years. For those who wish to look for these publishedtranscriptions, Dorman's transcriptions of the order books are calledWestmoreland County, Virginia Order Book plus the inclusive dates, and the deedand will transcriptions are called Westmoreland County, Virginia Deeds and Willsplus the book number and dates, while the Sparacio transcriptions through 1742are called Deed & Will Abstracts of Westmoreland County, Virginia, and fromthat point on they are called Westmoreland County, Virginia Deed & WillAbstracts. The Sparacio transcriptions are identified by inclusive years, whileDorman uses the original book numbers but also includes the years. The Sparaciotranscriptions are published at The Antient Press, 1320 Mayflower Drive,McLean, Va. 22101, while Dorman's were published under his own name inWashington, D.C. The place of publication will not be repeated in thereferences to follow, but the years will. The early Orange Co. records havealso been transcribed by Dorman and the Sparacios.]\n\n[Asterisks mean that I do not yet have an adequate reference to the publishedtranscription of the document.]\n\nThere are two frequent major mistakes regarding the Ransdells. EdwardRansdell's widow was not Amy Wharton, there being no such person. Nor can it beproved that the first wife was Mary Gorham, although that is possible. Hiswidow Amy was Mrs. Amy Kelly when he married her. So far as I know, her maidenname is not known, although Ed Ransdell thinks it might have been Doniphan.There certainly was an Alexander Doniphan, and Amy named a Kelly childAlexander. She is not the mother of any of Edward's children. See more abouther below.\n\nThe second major error is that William Ransdell, settler in Mercer Co., Ky. wasNOT the son of William Ransdell and Mary Chilton of Fauquier Co. Do not rely,for this and other questions, on the research of E. Porter Ransdell, which Ifound in a little booklet at the library of the Kentucky Historical Society.Some of his claims are impossible. He may have been relying on the work ofJames L. Kendall of Jeffersonville, Indiana, whose perhaps preliminarymanuscript I have seen at the Filson Club in Louisville. E.P. Ransdell,however, did not think in the way a genealogist should and made some seriousmisinterpretations. Kendall speculated that it was possible that WilliamRansdell who came to Mercer Co., Ky. was the son of William Ransdell and MaryChilton of Fauquier Co. E.P. Ransdell apparently took this as a fact. Inpublished form later on, though, Kendall called William the son of JohnRansdell, which is much more likely. Also risky in some areas is the publishedresearch of Ron Donaldson. As with most of us, he is most capable in the areaof most direct interest. See \"Thornton of Richmond County, Virginia\"by Dr. B. C. Holtzclaw in Historical Southern Families, vol. 12, 1968,published by J.B. Boddie for a well-researched article as it regards theRansdells of Orange Co., Va., the family of John and his probable son, Williamof Mercer Co. Dr. Holtzclaw also gives some documentation for the generations ofEdward and his children. There is also good research in the typescript ofWilliam K. Ransdell at the Kentucky Historical Society library.\n\nWilliam of Mercer Co., Ky. came from Orange Co., Va., not Fauquier, whereWilliam Ransdell and Mary Chilton lived. William of Mercer was married no laterthan 1760-61, since his son Wharton was born in 1763, according to a familyBible, and Wharton had a brother William who appeared in the Orange Co.tithables before Wharton did. (For these Bible records, see NSDAR Magazine,Feb. 1981, p. 109.) If William of Mercer was married in the early 1760s, whileall the recorded marriages of children of William of Fauquier took place in thelate 1780s and 1790s, there was certainly a large gap between the marriage ofWilliam of Mercer (m. Ann Petty) and those that some researchers have wanted tomake his siblings in Fauquier Co. From these dates, one would conclude thatWilliam of Orange and Mercer was nearer to being a contemporary of William ofFauquier and Mary Chilton rather than their son. All dealings of William ofMercer have been found to be with the other Orange Co. Ransdells and not withthose of Fauquier. This argues that William of Mercer was the son of JohnRansdell (son of Edward who died in 1724 in Westmoreland Co.) of Orange Co.\n\nOne finds that the Fauquier Co. Ransdells settled in fairly great number in theShelby Co.-Henry Co. area of Kentucky as well as in Owen, Franklin, Fayette andScott, while the Orange Co. group settled in Mercer Co., Ky. I am not wellinformed about any except the Mercer group, which includes, though, FoxallRansdell, son of William of Mercer Co., who moved to the Shelby-Henry area.\n\nSee here below some of my notes on this family. I am not immune to mistakeseither. I would be very grateful to have any pointed out to me that can bedocumented as being erroneous. And if one finds records on the early Ransdellsthat can add to our knowledge of them, please let me and all researchers knowabout it. I am hoping to write an extensive article on the family sometime.\n\n* * * * *\n\nAn Edward Ransdell is mentioned in the records of St. Mary's Co., Md. asreproduced in Archives of Maryland, vol. 53, p. 631 (1661) and vol. 57 p. 283(1666). The latter document also mentions a \"Mr. Foxall,\" who couldbe from the Westmoreland family referred to later. The land referred to is inSt. Clement's Manor. [These volumes may be available on the Archives ofMaryland web site.]\n\nA PROBABLE son of the above is the Edward Ransdell who appears first inWestmoreland Co., Va. on 22 Oct. 1696, pp. 82a-83a of Westmoreland Co. Deedsand Wills Book 2 (p. 33, Westmoreland County, Virginia Deeds and Wills, No. 2,1691-1699, John Frederick Dorman, Washington, 1965). In this document, RichardOmohundro of Cople Parish assigns his right to 192Â½ acres between theRappahannock and Nomini Creek adjoining Peirce, Jacob Remey, Nicholas Spencer\"to EDWARD RANSDELL of same, carpenter and cooper.\" [There areseveral records in this county telling of people apprenticed to Edward Ransdellto learn his trade.] This land had gone through these hands: 28 Jan. 1683/4,Thomas Collinsworth to William Moxley; 12 Feb. and 12 March, same year,Collinsworth's wife acknowledges relinquishment of right of dower; 8 Sept.1696, William Moxley assigns to Richard Omohundro.\n\nEDWARD appears with a wife MARY in a Westmoreland deed of 30 and 31 May 1699(D&W 2, pp. 186-186a, as transcribed on p. 89, WDWD 2, 1965). EdwardRansdell of Cople Parish, carpenter, to Jacob Ramy Junr., 30 acres adjoiningNicholas Spencer, Jacob Remey Senr., Thos. Collinsworth. On 31 May 1699, MaryRansdell, wife, relinquishes dower right to this land. He appears with a wifeAMY in a deed of gift to son WHARTON on 24 Jan 1720/1, D&W 7, p. 87 (asmentioned in Holtzclaw's Thornton article on p. 13, which was cited above) andwithout Amy's being mentioned on 26 Feb. 1723, D&W 8, p. 7a (WDWS,1723-1726, p. 11, 1994), a deed of gift to sons EDWARD and JOHN. Amy, as willbe seen in Edward Ransdell's will, was the widow of Capt. John Kelly. John Kellydied sometime in 1715. His will, written 7 Oct. 1714 and proved 4 May 1715 ison p. 208, Richmond Co. Wills and Inventories, 1709-1717, as transcribed on p.29, Wills of Richmond County, Virginia, 1699-1800, comp. by Robert K. HeadleyJr., publ. Genealogical Publishing Company, Baltimore, 1983. Amy's will,written 17 Jan. 1729/30, pr. 4 Feb. 1729/30 is transcribed on p. 65 of the samepublication She mentions dau. Mary Moxley; sons John Kelly, Matthew Kelly, andAlexander Kelly, exr. friend James Wilson. Witn. Anne Wilson, James Williams,William Jordan. It is obvious from the date of death of John Kelly and theabsence of Ransdell children in Amy's will that she had no children by EdwardRansdell.\n\nIn 1706 Edward Ransdell received a grant of 141 acres in Westmoreland Co.adjoining land formerly that of Col. William Pearce deceased & NicholasSpencer Esq., deceased and James Burns. It was on Rappahannock Creek, a branchof Nomini. The warrant was dated 29 June 1706 and the survey was made by ThomasThompson on 22 Nov. 1706. This is recorded in Northern Neck Grants, 1690-1784,Book 3, p. 138, as transcribed on p. 34 by Gertrude E. Gray and published in1988 by the Genealogical Publishing Co. of Baltimore under the title VirginiaNorthern Neck Land Grants, 1694-1742. Page 42 of this publication shows a grantto John Garner of Westmoreland in Book 3, p. 239. This tract of 390 acresadjoins that of Edward Ransdell.\n\nThe first wife of Edward Ransdell MAY HAVE BEEN Mary Gorham, daughter of Milesand Susannah Gorham. Mary was the ward of Henry and Elizabeth Wharton, and itis possible that she wished to honor them by naming a child after them. Thepossible identity of Edward's wife is explained in the Holtzclaw Thorntonarticle cited earlier. Dr. Holtzclaw for the most part gives completedocumentation of his facts in this article. As far as the Ransdells areconcerned, he concentrates on those who moved from Westmoreland Co. to OrangeCo., Va. because of their close ties with the Thorntons. Those who want to geta few more details on the Ransdells, as well as a brief mention of ties withSanfords, should read this article. Most of the Ransdell information is onpages 12 to 16. Hereafter references to this article will appear as Holtzclaw,plus the page number\n\nEdward Ransdell died sometime in 1724, since his will was written on 1 May 1724and probate took place on 24 June 1724, D&W 8, pp. 23a-24 (WDWS, 1723-1726,pp. 38-40, 1994). To sons WHARTON, EDWARD; and JOHN, personal property; to wifeAMY and her children by Capt. John Kelly, personal property and whatever estatehe had by virtue of his marriage to her; sons Edward and John to be underguardianship of Wharton until they reach age of 21; to Elizabeth Jeffries, acow; to daughter-in-law [= step daughter] Mary Kelly, a heifer; to NicholasStephens, clothing; to slave Will, a box; to daughters ELIZABETH TALBOT andMILESENT LONGWORTH, residue of estate; and to William Longworth, my best suitof clothes.

We have here a mention of Wharton who m.Ursula Presley, his son Wm. who m. Mary Chilton (and of Mary herself) and ofWm. and Mary's son, here called Wharton Jr. There is not, however, any explicitidentification of John Ransdell. The Dorman article in the Virginia Genealogiston the Chilton family above indicates, by mentioning no such person, thatWilliam and Mary did not have a son John, so we might SPECULATE that this Johnis the son of William's brother Wharton.

The use of \"said\" in suchdocuments means \"aforementioned,\" but in the abstract, at least, noWilliam has been previously mentioned. This is why one wants to see originaldocuments. Was William mentioned in the original? And which Wharton is this? Itcould be the son of William, called Wharton Jr. in the deed above of 1782. Thisseems especially likely, because the owners of the lands adjoining includePettit and Stewart, as well as Digges, as in the deed in Book 7, pp. 509-12.Did the whole text of the deed again mention William, the father of WhartonJr.? If so, then this tells us that William DID INDEED have a son John who isnot listed in the Dorman article above on the Chiltons. Could this be thesolution to the mystery of the identity of the John Ransdell who married LucyChilton? And note another (or the same?) John to follow in Stafford Co.

Mary Chilton was dead by this time, theWilliam in Fauquier in 1787 must be either their son or Wharton and Margaret'sby that name. (Many have MISTAKENLY made William of Orange Co., Va. and MercerCo., Ky. the son of William Ransdell and Mary Chilton of Fauquier Co.) One ofthese two cousins named William may have died already. From the index ofFauquier records compiled by John P. Alcock, it would appear that the Williamof Fauquier in 1787 may have died in 1788. Alcock's index does not providesufficient information to determine which William this was, but the dates ofbirth and marriage of the children of William of Mercer make it extremelyunlikely that he was the son William of either Wharton or William of Fauquier.\n\n[The 1800 tax lists of Mercer Co.

It is very difficult to determine which belongsto which father in a number of cases.]\n\n1. Wharton Ransdell, b. by 1696, d.ca. 1758, Westmoreland Co. The date of his birth is explained by his serving ona grand jury in 1717, at which time he was probably 21 or older (WestmorelandCo. Order Book 1705-21, p. 315a, as cited on p. 13, Holtzclaw). His will(D&W 13, pp. 143-44) was written on 10 June 1755 and probated 25 Apr. 1758.He married first Ursula Presly, widow of Daniel Neale and daughter of PeterPresly and Elizabeth Thompson (see articles on Preslys of Northumberland Co. byMrs. O.A. Keach in Tyler's Quarterly, vol. 9, pp. 265-70, and Virginia Magazineof History and Biography, vol. 34, pp. 92-93, 187-92, and 287-92). Ursula hadan interesting grandmother, Ursula Bysshe, who married Richard Thompson, JohnMottrom, and George Colclough and seemed to hold her own quite well in themen's world of her day. Other publications and documents not cited here bearout what is to follow about her. She was a niece of William Claiborne,secretary of the colony of Virginia at an early day and a man quite disliked inMaryland for his opposition to the ownership of Kent Island by Maryland insteadof Virginia. Ursula Bysshe had a brother who was the ancestor of the poet PercyBysshe Shelley. [It is probably a mistake that Ursula was the daughter of aPhilip Bish of Bristol, England. If any researcher should want to pursueUrsula's ancestry, I will be glad to furnish the references.] Wharton Ransdellm. second Mrs. Sarah (Elliott) Sturman, widow of William Sturman, d. 1732, andthe daughter of John Elliott and Sarah Foxall, who was probably the daughter ofJohn Foxall. This John could possibly be the \"Mr. Foxall\" with whomthe earlier Edward Ransdell was associated in Maryland. Sarah Ransdell wroteher will in Westmoreland Co. in 1778 and it was proved in 1781. In her will,Sarah named a grandson Elliott Sturman, her dau. Sarah Elliott Pierce,granddaughter Martha Pierce, and son-in-law Joseph Pierce (p. 73, William A.Crozier, Virginia County Record Publications, New Series, vol. 1, WestmorelandCounty, 1913, reprinted by Genealogical Publishing Co., Baltimore, 1971). [Seebelow also the will of her remarried mother, Sarah Monroe.] The six below areWharton's children, who had to have been born no earlier than 1715, sinceDaniel Neale, Ursula's first husband died in March 1714.\n\na. ElizabethRansdell, probably died sometime after August 1727, when she is mentioned in adeed (transcribed above) of her parents (D&W 8, p. 88) and before the writingof her father's will in 1755, where her name does not appear.\n\nb. EdwardRansdell, m. Elizabeth Sturman, apparently his step sister. Edward is mentionedfirst in his father's will and received the home plantation. He left a will in1773 in Westmoreland Co. naming wife Elizabeth, dau. Elizabeth who m. JamesDavenport, and nephews Presley [which proves which Edward he is], son ofbrother Wharton, and Edward, son of brother William [another proof](Fothergill, Wills, p. 187). This Edward may be the Edward Ransdell who signedthe Westmoreland Resolutions protesting English policies.\n\nIfwe assume that Edward's father and mother married fairly soon after the deathof Daniel Neale, then we can assume Elizabeth was born about 1716 and herbrother Edward in about 1718. This would mean that Edward became 21 in about1739. On that basis we might judge that 1736 and 1738 documents involving anEdward Ransdell applied to this Edward's uncle by that name. Those dates,however, are probably too near his theoretical maturity to absolutely rule thisEdward out.\n\nThefollowing is written about this family on p. 107 of the second installment of\"Sturman Family Notes\" by Mary Hope West and Juliet Fauntleroy, asfound in William and Mary Quarterly, vol. 16, 2nd series (1936), pp. 635-49 andvol. 17, 2nd series (1937), pp. 99-115: \"Elizabeth Sturman, dau. ofWilliam and Sarah (Elliott) Sturman, named in the will of her grandfather JohnSturman II as 'William's girl Betty,' md. her step-brother Edward Ransdell, sonof Wharton Ransdell and his first wife, Ursula Pressly, wid. of DanielNeale\" [See Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, July 1926, p.290]. They had at least one child:\n\n\"ElizabethRansdell, md. May 1769, James Davenport, Clerk of Westmoreland Court. Thismarriage was listed as an event of much interest. James Davenport was a warmfriend of Richard Henry Lee. Davenport died in 1777, and she md. 2nd, herkinsman, Dr. George Steptoe, and lived at Windsor. Her second husband was half brotherto the wife of Thomas Ludwell Lee and to Mrs. Philip Ludwell Lee of Stratford,and to Mrs. Samuel Washington, wife of the brother of Gen. George Washington.Her second husband died in 1784, also her two children.\"\n\n[Noteby Robert P. Moore: One notices here, perhaps with surprise, the association ofthis family with some of the famous names of Westmoreland Co. If one recalls,though, the size of these places in the early 1700s, he should not besurprised. Thirty-odd years later at the time of the first census (1790) of theU.S., Westmoreland Co. still had a population of only a little over 7,000. Itis probable that many of the citizens of the county knew each other. Even todayWestmoreland Co. is still a rural area, there being only 15,000 inhabitants inthe 1990 census.]\n\nc. WhartonRansdell, m. by 3 Dec. 1744, Margaret Barrow, daughter of Edward Barrow andElizabeth Minor (dau. of Nicholas Minor, d. 1744, Westmoreland Co.). His willis in Fauquier Co. Will Book 2, pp. 92-93, wr. 27 Jan. 1786, pr. 26 June 1786.(For marriage of Margaret and her ancestry, see pp. 166 and 11, Marriages ofRichmond County, Virginia, 1668-1853, compiled and published by George H.S.King, Fredericksburg, 1964, and p. 170, Fauquier County, Virginia Wills,Inventories and Accounts, 1759-1800, compiled and published by John K. Gott,1976, henceforth cited as Gott, Wills.) King cannot give a specific date ofmarriage, but refers to documents, including Richmond Co. Account Book 1, p.209, that show that they were already married by 3 Dec. 1744. The children arelisted here, following as closely as possibly the order in Wharton's will,which seems NOT to be an indication of their order of birth. This Wharton andhis brother William below both had children named William, Sarah, Thomas,Elizabeth, Edward, and Wharton. It is, therefore very risky to make a hard andfast assignment of the people by these names to one or the other of thefathers, so the researcher should realize that I do not commit myself to myspeculations regarding Ransdells of that generation by those identical names.The Elizabeth who married Cadwallader Slaughter is an exception. She is clearlythe daughter of Wharton, as indicated by Wharton's will. The same is true ofWilliam's daughter Sarah. She is the one who married Nathaniel Gray. Thegreatest problems are with distinguishing the Thomases and Williams. A thoroughsearch of Fauquier Co. records might resolve some of the questions. Someavailable Ransdell documents in Fauquier Co. are listed in pages 289 and 290 ofFauquier Families, 1759-1799, John P. Alcock, Iberian Publishing Co., Athens,Ga., 1994. However, Alcock seems not to have listed all essential Ransdelldocuments in Fauquier records. This is probably the Wharton who was calledCapt. Wharton Ransdell in the inventory of his estate in Fauquier Will Book 2,p. 118, taken on 14 Sept. 1786 and returned 25 June 1787 by Ambrose Barnett,James Hathaway, and George Carter, who gave an appraisal of Â£891.8.11 (Gott,Wills, p. 178).\n\n(1) WilliamRansdell. See comments here under his brother Thomas. See also Thomas, son ofWilliam and Mary Chilton.\n\n(2) AnnRansdell, m. 14 June 1779, Fauquier Co., Va., Turner Morehead. Their childrencan be found in the Morehead work cited below after Presley Ransdell.\n\n(3) MargaretRansdell\n\n(4) SarahRansdell\n\n(5) ThomasRansdell Possibly the one called \"Sr.\" See Thomas Ransdell below, sonof William Ransdell and Mary Chilton. It is not yet clear which of these is theone called Thomas Ransdell and which Thomas Ransdell Jr. Schreiner-Yantis'stranscription of the Fauquier Co. personal property tax list of 1787 containstwo Thomas Ransdells, one identified as \"Sr.\" The other Thomas is theresponsibility of William Ransdell, probably a brother. At present it is notpossible to determine whether these two are the sons of Wharton or of William(and Mary Chilton). If dates of listing in that census are significant, thesetwo seem to be living close to some of the Moreheads. Wharton Ransdell (m.Margaret Barrow) appears to be older than his brother William, so it ispossible that his son Thomas was born before William's son Thomas. If that isthe case, then the Thomas Sr. in 1787 is probably Wharton's son, while theWilliam and Thomas listed together are probably sons of William Ransdell andMary Chilton. Thomas may have died ca. Oct. 1793 (see p. 290 of theabove-mentioned Fauquier Families, John P. Alcock) when his estate wasadministered by William Ball, but see his cousin Thomas below. The inventory ofthe estate administered by William Ball is in Will Book 2, p. 320, dated 8 Jan.1794, taken by David McNish, William Hunton Jr., Thomas Hunton and Daniel Gray(Gott, Wills, p. 233). The estate was appraised at Â£237.7.9.\n\n(6) ElizabethRansdell, b. 6 Apr. 1746, Overwharton Parish, Stafford Co., Va., m. 17 Dec.1762, Fauquier Co., Va., Cadwallader Slaughter. Elizabeth's and the two otherbirth dates of Wharton's children are from p. 99, The Register of OverwhartonParish, Stafford County, Virginia, 1723-1758, comp. and publ. by George H.S.King, Fredericksburg, 1961. Cadwallader and Elizabeth moved to Jefferson Co.,Ky.\n\n(7) EdwardRansdell, b. 10 June 1748, Overwharton Parish, Stafford Co., Va.\n\n(8) JohnRansdell m. Elizabeth Chinn and moved to Kentucky. [Her identity was given meby William K. Ransdell, Louisville, Ky., in doing so, contradicting theopinions of those who say she was Elizabeth Moore. See his typescript historyof his branch of the Ransdells Sifted From the Ashes, published 1988, in theholdings of the library of the Kentucky Historical Society, Frankfort.] Thefollowing remnants of a will from Fayette Co., Ky. burnt records may beapplicable.

Debts which cannotbe recovered in Va. courts. Elizabeth Chinn of Loudoun Co., Va., debt due withinterest from 1773, 13 shillings, 1 pence.

Lucy Chilton, b. ca. 1773, and moved toHenry Co., Ky. Lucy was the dau. of John Chilton, b. 1739, d. bef. 24 Nov.1777, killed at the battle of Brandywine in the Revolution. Lucy's parents wereJohn Chilton and Letitia Blackwell. [See Dorman's history of the Chilton familyin the Virginia Genealogist as referred to below under the section onWilliamRansdell and Mary Chilton.])\n\n(9) WhartonRansdell, b. 28 Jan. 1750, Overwharton Parish, Stafford Co., Va. See theWharton below, son of William Ransdell and Mary Chilton. It is still difficultto distinguish the two cousins. This Wharton, son of Wharton, is probably theone who m. Mary Morehead on 16 Jan. 1782, bondsman Turner Morehead (see Gott,Fauquier Co. Marriages, p. 164). Since a Wharton (not the grandfather above)had an inventory (total Â£240.7.0) returned by William Norris, George Carter andTurner Morehead on 23 Oct. 1786 in Fauquier Co., he probably died earlier thatyear. His administrator was Turner Morehead. (See p. 178, Gott, Wills, fromFauquier Co. Will Book 2, p. 109). It is not impossible that his wife MaryMorehead is the Mary Ransdell who m. 18 Nov. 1786, Fauquier Co., Va., ThomasRansdell Jr. (son of William and Mary Chilton??), bondsman Thomas Ransdell (seeGott, Fauquier Co. Marriages, p. 164). It would be logical for this Wharton'sfather Wharton (see his will) to provide for the two grandsons (WhartonRansdell and Charles Morehead Ransdell) because their father had died or wasill when they were still children. This Wharton may be the one mentioned in theAlcock index whose estate was sold in 1792 to pay his debts. Could the MargaretRansdell who was bound out to Robert Hunton in 1792 be a part of this family?(See Alford index.)\n\n(10) PresleyRansdell, probably d. before his father, who did not name him in his will.Mentioned by Wharton's brother Edward, d. 1773, above.\n\nMoreheadinformation was obtained from a typescript in the library of the Kentucky HistoricalSociety entitled Kentucky Families Descended from Charles and Mary (Turner)Morehead, comp. Lola Herron Jaques, Nov. 1979. Their son Turner Morehead issaid to have m. (1) Ann Ransdell, dau. of Wharton, who died sometime betweenAug. 1795 and Jan. 1798. Turner and Ann had nine children, born between Jan.1780 and Aug. 1795. Two of them, Peggy and Polly, married Charles MoreheadRansdell and Wharton Ransdell IV, apparently their cousins, in Nelson Co., Ky.on 23 June 1806 (p. 122, Marriage Bond & Consent Book of Nelson County,1801-1816, publ. by Nelson County Genealogists, Bardstown, Ky., no date.). Thisgrandson Wharton appears as a baker at age 65 (b. ca. 1785) with his wife Mary,also 65, in the 1850 census of Sangamon Co., Illinois. His sons (or grandsons?)Wharton, Presley and James B., all b. Ky., were carpenters or cabinet makers.There was also a Walter Ransdell, b. ca. 1824, Ky., in the same census with hisown family.\n\nd. WilliamRansdell, d. 1776, m. Mary Chilton, d. ca. 1788, dau. of Thomas Chilton andJemima Cooke. Information given here for this family is chiefly from John F.Dorman's series of articles on \"The Chilton Families of Virginia andMaryland,\" in the Virginia Genealogist. The applicable installment is onpp. 15-18 of vol. 14, No. 1 (Jan.-March, 1970). His will in Fauquier Co. WillBook 1, pp. 289-90, wr. 3 July 1776 and pr. 29 Oct. 1776 (Gott, Wills, p. 74),mentions only his sons Wharton, Thomas, William, Edward and Chilton, but afamily Bible cited by Mark A. Chilton in a letter to Robert Hall Chilton, lateraide to Robert E. Lee, gives the remaining children on the list. William andMary may have had another son John. Note that Fauquier Co. Deed Book 8, pp.138-40 (1784), mentions a John Ransdell, son of William. (Recall that Williamdid not name all his children in his will.) Perhaps he is the unidentified JohnRansdell who married Nov. 1792, Fauquier Co., Lucy Chilton and went to HenryCo., Ky. If some researchers are correct, however, that the John who m. LucyChilton was born ca. 1769 (proof not given), then he may be too young to havebeen the one living independently in 1784.\n\n(1) ThomasRansdell. Probably the Thomas Ransdell who d. ca. Sept. 1796 with his estateadministered by Chilton Ransdell with Orrick Chilton and William Ball Jr. asChilton's securities (see again Alcock's Fauquier Families). No matter whichThomas was called Jr., the Thomas, son of William and Mary, is more likely tobe the one who d. in 1796, since Orrick and Chilton Ransdell are his brothers.See also below where Chilton Ransdell is appointed guardian in 1796 of John andMaria, orphans of Thomas. He is POSSIBLY the one called Thomas Ransdell\"Jr.,\" and thus is perhaps the Thomas Ransdell Jr. who m. 18 Nov.1786, Fauquier Co., Va., Mary Ransdell. (Probably junior to his cousin Thomasabove.) The inventory of the estate of Major Thomas Ransdell is in Wills, Gott,p. 265, which indicates that it was in Fauquier Co. Will Book 3, pp. 32-34, 21Oct. 1796. The appraisal was made by Samuel Steele, George Rogers, and JosephHale, with the estate evaluated at Â£669.4.6.\n\n(2) WilliamRansdell. He could be the one who d. ca. 1788, Fauquier Co. (See, p. 290,Fauquier Families, 1759-1799, where Turner Morehead was granted administrationof that William's estate. It is not impossible, of course, that this was theson of Wharton and Margaret Barrow, especially with a Morehead administeringthe estate. I am inclined to think that the William listed in the 1787 Fauquierproperty tax list (who must be the one who d. in 1788) is this one, the son ofWilliam and Mary Chilton. See reasons under Thomas, son of Wharton above. SeeWills, Gott, p. 182, which shows the inventory taken by Ambrose Barnett, DavidMcNish, and Thomas Saunders and appraised at Â£168.18.0. It may be a mistake onmy part to attribute too much importance to assocations with Moreheads indeciding whether a given person is a child of Wharton or of William Ransdell.\n\n(3) WhartonRansdell, living 1790, apparently died unm. See p. 290, Alcock's FauquierFamilies, where there is mention in June 1792 of the selling of the estate ofWharton, son of William and Mary to pay debts. Turner Morehead wasadministrator. The Morehead administration could, however, indicate a son ofWharton rather than William. In Schreiner-Yantis's transcription of the 1787personal property tax list of Fauquier Co., Wharton is probably living with hismother, since Mary Ransdell is stated to be responsible for Wharton's tax.\n\n(4) ChiltonRansdell, d. 1808 Fauquier Co., Va. (see Fauquier Will Book 4, pp. 516-17), m.13 Jan. 1792, Fauquier Co., Va., cousin Susanna Chilton, dau. of WilliamChilton (Mary Chilton Ransdell's brother) and Sarah Orrick. He owned land inKentucky, according to p. 289, Fauquier Families. Alcock.\n\n(5) StephenRansdell. Resided in Fauquier. Left an only heir John Ransdell (Chilton articleby Dorman), although this would not necessarily be a son of his. Alcock's indexindicates that Chilton Ransdell was guardian of a John and Maria, orphans ofThomas in 1796. This index shows Stephen listed on Fauquier Co. tithable listswith Mary Ransdell in 1788 and 1789 and with Wharton in 1791. He appears onsuch lists as late as 1799.\n\n(6) MaryRansdell, apparently m. 5 Jan. 1789, Fauquier Co., Va., John Clarke.\n\n(7) UrsulaRansdell. Found only in letter from Mark A. Chilton to Robert H.

TheFothergill transcription of Wharton's will has her as ELIZABETH Elliott Peirce.I have a xerox copy of the will from the will book, and twice it reads clearlySARAH Elliott Peirce. Their son Ransdell Peirce was b. ca. 1770 and d. 1853,leaving descendants in Lancaster Co., Va., one of whom I have correspondedwith. Joseph Peirce was the son of William Peirce, d. 1733, Westmoreland Co.,and Sibella_____ (p. 251, King, Richmond Co. Marriages).\n\n(1) MarthaPeirce\n\n(2) RansdellPeirce, b. 1775, d. 1853. A descendant, Harman Chilton Treakle, says that he m.(1) 17 Nov. 1794, Lancaster Co., Va., Ann Graham, dau. of John Graham andElizabeth., and (2) on 28 Apr. 1847, Westmoreland Co., Nancy G. Barnes. All hischildren were by his first wife.\n\n(3) FannyPeirce, m. _____ Larue. Her will is in Richmond Co., Va., Will Book 11, p. 18,wr. 3 Feb. 1846, pr. 7 Sept. 1846. Her heirs were niece Mary E.H. Mitchell;Margaret E. Herndon, dau. of Richard N. Herndon; brother Ransdell Pierce; andhis children Joseph Pierce, Graham C. Pierce, William G. Pierce, Ann S. H.Brooke, Mary E.H. Mitchell. Apparently she left nothing to the families of herother siblings.\n\n(4) IsabellaPeirce, m. (1) Thomas Chilton, son of Thomas Chilton and Jemima Cooke (John F.Dorman, \"The Chilton Families,\" Virginia Genalogist, vol. 14, No. 1,pp. 19-20), who d. by 1781, (2) Samuel Templeman, b. 1758, Westmoreland Co.,Va., a merchant and Baptist minister.\n\n2. Elizabeth Ransdell m. (1) by 1724(see father Edward's will above) Samuel Talbot, d. 1727 (Richmond Co. Will Book5, p. 32) and (2) in Richmond Co. on 10 Aug. 1727 (North Farnham ParishRegister), William Thornton, son of Luke Thornton and Margaret James[?]. Dr.Holtzclaw says they had an only son Jesse Thornton. William Thornton d. in 1741in Richmond Co. (inventory ordered 3 Aug. 1741, see Richmond Co. Will Book 5,p. 389 and Order Book 11, p. 197). Elizabeth wrote her will on 6 Apr. 1742 andit was probated on 3 May 1742 (Richmond Co. Will Book 5, p. 397, WhartonRansdell, witn. [p. 84, Headley, Richmond Co. Wills]). The whole estate wasleft to her son Jesse Thornton. (The references to documents concerningElizabeth and Millicent are on pp. 12-13 and 16, Holtzclaw.)\n\n3. Millicent Ransdell m. (1) WilliamLongworth, who d. in 1724 (see the administration of his estate in WestmorelandCo. Order Book 1721-31, p. 76) and had two children by him. She m. (2) LukeThornton, brother of her sister's second husband, and by 1734 the Thorntons andMillicent's brother John Ransdell had moved to the part of Spotsylvania Co.that was soon to become Orange Co. (see Spotsylvania Co. deed below). Dr.Holtzclaw discusses this family on pp. 23-26 of his Thornton article. He namesthe Thornton children with some uncertainty.\n\na. WilliamLongworth, b. 1721, d. 9 Nov. 1726, according to North Farnham Parish records.\n\nb. JemimaLongworth, b. Sept. 1724, m. ca. 1740/4, Orange Co., Va., her stepfather'scousin John Thornton.\n\nc. PossiblyWilliam Thornton (who may have been a son of Luke's brother James)\n\nd. Almostcertainly John Thornton, d. Orange Co., 1781, who may have been the youngestson. Three of his children moved to Culpeper Co., Va. Some descendants moved toOhio.\n\ne. PresleyThornton of Orange Co., b. ca. 1735/6, d. 1815, Pittsylvania Co., Va.\n\n4. Edward Ransdell Jr., b. after 1703(minor in 1724). It is POSSIBLE he was the executor in 1736 of the will ofWilliam Shaw. (See Fothergill, Wills, p. 101. Will of William Shaw, 7 June1736-29 June 1736. To Elizabeth Sturman, to Edward Ransdell Jr. (one horse),Joseph Stone, sisters Sarah and Jane Shaw. Edward Ransdell, exr. The will seemsto mention two different Edward Ransdells.\n\n5. John Ransdell, b. after 1703 (minorin 1724). It is POSSIBLE, since he appears to have had a son and laterdescendants named Sanford Ransdell, that his wife was a Sanford. No mention hasyet been found in any of the records of Orange or Westmoreland Co. that wouldsuggest who this wife was. Among the Sanfords of Mercer Co., Kentucky was aYouell/Uel Sanford, associated there with the Ransdells, so this possible wifeof John's could be from the same line. See some speculation on Uel/YouellSanford's b0eing a descendant of Youell Sanford of Westmoreland Co., son ofThomas, d. 1770, on p. 160 in an account of the Westmoreland Sanfords byRosemary Corley Neal, pp. 93-166, Southern Sojourners, published in 1991 by theauthor. This book does not, however, come to any conclusions about the Sanfordsof Kentucky, nor does it discuss the possibility of John Ransdell's having aSanford wife. John Ransdell moved to Spotsylvania Co. in 1734, to the part thatbecame Orange Co. in 1735. It is interesting to note that on 26 March 1734,John Ransdell and Luke Thornton witnessed a deed in Westmoreland Co. asrecorded in D&W8, pp. 233-34 (WDWS 1732-1734, pp. 78-80, 1995) from WilliamRice to William Templeman, while in November of that year they appear in aSpotsylvania Co. deed of 30 Nov. 1734 (see more complete reference to this deedin section on Orange Co. Ransdells), so they could have moved in the interval.THIS JOHN RANSDELL IS ALMOST CERTAINLY THE FATHER OF WILLIAM RANSDELL, D. CA.1801-2, MERCER CO., KY., WHO M. ANN PETTY. At this point there are manyuncertainties about how many children John Ransdell had. Those that are rathercertain are John, William, Jesse, Sanford, Elizabeth, possibly Molly Ford, andpossibly George. John, William, and Sanford moved to Mercer Co., Ky. Molly andhusband Absalom Ford moved to Woodford Co., Ky., Jesse died in Orange Co., andElizabeth and George appear very briefly in Orange Co., Va. See Robert P.Moore's separate study of this family for further details. The order of thepossible children below does not imply order of birth.\n\na.

The same is true of his son William Jr. Note that William's wife Annbecomes responsible for the taxes in 1802 and that she last appears in 1818.Notice that when William Sr.'s probable brother John disappears from the taxlists in 1804, the 50 acres he had passes to Edward, a possible son, and whenEdward disappears in 1806, the tax on the 50 acres is paid by John's wifeCatherine. John and Catherine had also appeared together in deeds in Orange Co.before the move to Ky. It could be that the 50 acres passed into the hands ofJohn, William's son in 1807, since his holdings increased from 100 to 150acres. Zachariah appears to have moved out of the county between 1813 and 1815,and Foxall is gone by 1809. Although the land does not appear in the taxes ofany Ransdell after Ann's disappearance, it was still in the hands of the estateuntil the division among heirs was made some years later in 1830. Notice thatJohn, son of Wm., evidently died sometime after 1815. His widow Elizabeth paidthe taxes after that."
