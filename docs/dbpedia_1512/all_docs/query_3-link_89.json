Reflecting back on my childhood, I can remember that we would travel to Jeffersonville, IN (across the river from Louisville) to visit family, each time we would make that trip WSGS was the radio station which was on in the car and the signal was just as strong in Jeffersonvillle, IN as it was in Hazard, KY. Since WSGS has been the occupant of button number 1 on my car radio for years it's comforting to know that there are real people that do take the time to respond to there audience.\" Ryan Adams, Morehead, KY\n\n\"It so nice to listen to WSGS on the Internet and get the news from my home town.

Omega Chamberlain, Edwards Air Force Base CA\n\n\"I am a daily listener to WSGSFM and enjoy your newscasts very much. Just to let you know that a friend of mine lives in Los Banos, California and she called me and told me that the San Francisco news had picked up the OxyContin Bust and she wanted to let me know that Hazard had hit the big time news. I think what PAD has in mind is great and other counties should follow suite. Keep up keeping me up on Hazard and its news.

So far I've listened to the Perry County Central Girls basketball team while I was in Denver, Colorado and to the news by accessing it on the Internet from WSGS.com.\" Ryan Adams, Richmond, Virginia\n\n\"As a former Hazard resident, it's nice to be able to log on and catch up on the events in the area. Keep up the great work!\" Mel Sayers, Coeburn, Virginia\n\n\"I'm glad to have found this site. I've missed WSGS's news since moving to Louisville.\" Blanche Caudill, Louisville, KY\n\n\"Gee it sure is nice to hear my home town radio station. The drug bust was no surprise. It should have happened about five years ago. One problem that Hazard has is arresting the drug dealers and users, then they get out after a few hours or as soon as they can pull strings or raise bail. They go right back to using and selling. I think the only thing that is going to help is to put them in a good drug rehab and keep them there until they are clean and cured. When they have completed the rehab of 6 weeks, make it mandatory that they see a psychiatrist when called at random to take a urine or blood test to see if they are still using. I am ashamed to hear on WBBM radio here in Chicago about the drug users and the crooked police force and other officials stealing drugs out of the jail lockers. Chicago is a big city and Hazard is about even with this city when it comes to drugs. I say cure them even if they don't want it and if that don't work, hurry with the new jail and make it big enough to hold half of Hazard and the surrounding cities. I will be listening to you on the Internet since I keep my computer on all day 24,7.\" Kathleen (Turner) Mchugh Chicago, IL. northwest side\n\n\"WSGS, I have been waiting for you to get the 'live' broadcast back on the Internet. I love to listen to my home town music and news. I was born and raised in around Hazard. I have been in Chicago now since 1956. I get back to visit my son who lives there once a year at least. I would love to hear the music again. Sure do miss it.\" Laura Gayhart, Chicago, Illinois\n\n\"I think this site is an excellent tool of communication means. It's easier for me to keep up with my home town and happenings. Thanks a lot.\" Denise Stacy Pensacola, FL\n\n\"Love to hear about what's going on down home.\" James Evans, Xenia, Ohio\n\n\"Born and raised in the mountains and love listening to the local news in Hazard from the Internet.\" Alex Gayheart, Chicago, Illinois\n\n\"It is about time the police are stopping the drug dealers and abusers. Drug use is destroying the lives of our children and our children's children.\" Phyllis Mcintosh, Versailles KY\n\n\"I do enjoy your listening to your broadcast so please keep up the good work. Thank you for it.\" Alfred Fugate, Cincinnati, Ohio\n\n\"I always seem to miss the news on the radio. This is a great idea. I listened for the first time yesterday and will continue to go to the Internet for the news in the future.\" Tammy Caywood, Hazard, KY\n\n\"Listened for the first time today. Very good.

We are so anxious to get the music from there. We also would like to know is the daily news is available? Thanks.\" Jim and Nell Hollon, Ft.Myers, FL\n\n\"I really enjoy listening to WSGS FM.\" Alvin Ritchie, Happy, KY\n\n\"We are still trying to get connected so that we can get the news like we do when we are at home in Wolfe County (May--October). When do you broadcast Bluegrass Music?\" Nell and Jim Hollon, Punta Gorda, FL\n\n\"WSGS is my favorite radio station.
