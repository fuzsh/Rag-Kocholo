As I listened to the\n\nconcerns of Symphony Orchestra Leagues, I realized they are struggling with\n\nmany of the same issues that are facing AOII— and the entire Greek community. These issues include:\n\n• Retaining and recmiting volunteers;\n\n• Utilizing the talents of our volunteers in a productive, time efficient manner;\n\n• Maintaining fiscal responsibility during tight economic conditions;\n\n• Adapting the organizational structure to meet the needs of societal changes;\n\n• Retaining the heritage and history of our organizations;\n\n• Recognizing the Age Wave (the increase in the population over 50 years old) and utilizing their talents; • Identifying our audience and speaking directly to them; and\n\n• Programming for the future, looking toward the 21st century.\n\nIn AOII we recognize the issues and continue to plan for the future. AOIXs Executive Board and Adminis- trative Committee met in August to plan— together — the future direction of the Fraternity. We had the opportunity to share our concerns, our dreams, and our ideas. After a brainstonning session, we decided on our priorities. AOII will be involved in implementing the following by 1995:\n\nPROGRAMMING\n\nAOITs programming is directed at increasing self-esteem and building self-confidence in every member. AOII plans new programming for alumnae, pledges, chapter relations, creating awareness in diversity and non- traditional membership selection, crisis management and personal accountability.\n\nMARKETING\n\nOur Mission Statement tells AOITs story completely— the benefits of membership, the values of member- ship, the modeling of membership— for a lifetime commitment. All we do, say, and share with sisters reflects the image of excellence.\n\nRITUAL\n\nThe one constant in the lives of AOIIs is our Ritual. It need not change, for it gives us direction, guidance and inspiration which will endure forever. No matter what happens around us, we can depend upon the words of our Founders to bring order and steadfastness to our lives. AOII encourages members to study, perform, and live our Ritual.\n\nYes, there are many challenges ahead for our Fraternity. I came away from the meeting realizing that our chal- lenges can— and will— be met. We will accomplish our goals because we are all committed to the same mission— working together to support what we create and supporting the work of our sisters.\n\nW e have the unique opportunity to make significant headway in the Greek community by being leaders. W e can lead by: programming for diversity and nontraditional women students; standing for alcohol-free environ- ments; supporting and encouraging our chapters to adhere to National Panhellenic Conference rush recommendations on ALL campuses; finding ways for more alumnae to participate in the Fraternity process; and studying the structure of our organization to find better ways to accomplish AOITs goals.\n\nThe Executive Board and Administrative Committee have defined the issues and are developing the programs, but the real responsibility of implementing these programs is in your hands. You can help AOITs vision to become a reality by Accepting the Challenge! .\n\nRecently I had the opportunity to attend the American Symphony Orchestra League National Conference in Washington, D.C. Over 1500 delegates from across the country attended the four day convention.\n\nPUBLISHEDSINCEJANUARY, 1905BY\n\nALPHA OMICRON PI FRATERNITY, INC.\n\nALPHA OMICRON PI FRATERNITY FOUNDED AT BARNARD COLLEGE, JANUARY 2, 1897\n\n•FOUNDERS\n\nJESSIE WALLACE HUGHAN HELEN ST.

Some are candidates, while others help with fund raising, stuffing envelopes, making calls, or working the polls.\n\nTeresa Smith Lubbers, Beta Phi (Indiana U.),isrunningforthe statesen- ate in Indiana where she won a hotly contested primary earlier this year. The owner of a public relations firm, Teresa successfully challenged the county Republican organization to win the nomination from her home district.\n\nJudy Howard McCarty, Beta Phi (Indiana U.),who has been a San Diego City Councilwoman since 1985, is run- ning for the post o f county supervisor.\n\nKathy Ashworth, Tau Delta (Birmingham Southern College), lost a primary race for mayor of Lafayette, LA, earlier this year, but she vows she'll run again. She is not new to campaigning— she has been a parish (county) commis- sioner for eight years.\n\nOn the east coast, another AOFI is in her 20th year as a representative in the Connecticut State Legislature. Dorothy (Dottie) Karstaedt Osier, Omega (Miami U.), says she would like to see more young women in state legislatures.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Diane Sekura Snyder, Alpha Tau (Denison U.), is the first woman to be elected to the West Whiteland Board of Supervisors in Chester County. She won that post in a close election last November.\n\nOut west, Patricia McDermott, Iota Alpha (Idaho State U.), is running for her second term as a state senator in\n\nIdaho. She is also\n\nbeing considered\n\nfor an appoint-\n\nment to a\n\nvacancy on the\n\nstate Supreme\n\nCourt. Prior to\n\nbeing elected to\n\nthe state senate campaigners in California. in 1990, Patricia served 11 terms as a\n\nstate representative for a total of 22 years. She is a Democrat.\n\nThree AOIls who were college friends are active in campaigns for Republican candidates in California. Heathet Scott, Tracy Emper, and Barbara (Bobbe) Chilcote, all alumnae of the Lambda Iota Chapter (U. of California- San Diego), worked together on the tecent Uke for Congress campaign. Heather and her sister Diane own a cam- paign consulting firm which has hired Tracy and Bobbe to work on various campaigns. Tracy is still employed by the\n\ncompany. Bobbe had hoped to work for the Perot for President campaign. As To Dragma went to press, she was consider- ing her options and planning to remain active in Republican politics.\n\nOn the other side of the country, Jacque Struble Dinwidde, Epsilon Alpha (Penn State U.), is working in the Washington, D.C. office of the Clinton/Gote campaign. Jacque has been active in politics since the 1960s when she worked in the Reagan cam- paign for governor of California. Later, the Agnew fiasco, Watergate, and the Nixon pardon led Jacque to switch par- ties. She was one of the early volunteers in the D.C. area to work for Jimmy Carter. When Carter won, Jacque became part of the transition govern- ment in the Office of Management and Budget and then worked in the White House as staff assistant to the President's\n\ncounsel.\n\n\"The day after the inauguration I walked through the White House gates for the first time,\" Jacque tecalled.\n\nShe was responsible for reviewing all persons being considered for appoint- ments and screening all guests of the President, social and personal. She had daily contact with the Secret Service, the\n\nFrom left, Heather Scott, Tracy Emper, and Bobbe Chilcote, veteran\n\n4\n\nTo Dragma\n\nKathy Ashworth, unsuccessful candidate for mayor of Lafayette, LA, vows she'll try again.\n\nFBI, and the CIA. Jacque was responsi- ble for files so sensitive that her office had an alarm and access to it was limited.\n\n\"I also maintained the security vault and for a time was the keeper of the Nixon tapes and the much publicized paper shredder!\" she said.\n\nSeveral o f these politically active women commented that their A 0 I 1 experience has helped them in politics. For instance, Jacque said that AOI1 had helped her \"to better meet new and dif- ferent situations wherever I found them.\"\n\n\"AOI1 and my many A0I1 sisters gave me the confidence to be all that I can be. In my case, this took me to the White House! What else could I aspire to?\" she said.\n\nAnother veteran campaigner com- mented that her rush experience has been a great help in politics.\n\n\"A political campaign is like a long, big rush. Voters are the rush guests, the candidate is the sorority, the campaign manager is the rush chairman!\" said Bobbe Chilcote.\n\n\"On my last campaign I worked with two other AOIls. Believe me, while decorating campaign headquarters for our grand opening party or talking to voters at events, we often talked about\n\nTeresa Lubbers, candidate for the Indiana State Senate.\n\nhow AOIl had prepared us forour cam- paign duties,\" she added.\n\nTracy Emper echoed Bobbe's com- ments.\n\n\"It is amazing how the skills I devel- opedforrushhavebeenusedinmyjobs in politics. Meeting new people, patty planning, and interpersonal skills are vital to a good campaign and AOIl was great training,\" she said.\n\nKathy Ashworth, whose first race for mayor in Lafayette, Louisiana, won't be her last, said that her A O I l experi- ence had taught her skills such as how to network and how to build support groups.\n\n\"Being in the mayot's race got me back into the sorority.. .AOIl sisters got in touch with me— my campaign helped us find each other again,\" she said.\n\nKathy said that a commitment to service was instilled in het as an AOIl in college.\n\nTeresa Lubbers, who defied local political bosses by challenging the slated Republican candidate for state represen- tative, received needed financial support from AOIl alumnae in central Indiana. Teresa won the Republican primary, which is considered tantamount to win- ning the election because the district is 70 percent Republican.\n\nJudy McCarty, who is running for county supervisor in San Diego, California, traces her interest i n politics back to the 1960 presidential campaign.\n\n\"Our chapter was very much into the Nixon-Kennedy campaign in 1960. The two Kennedy supporters were gra- cious winners. Our members were also involved in campus politics,\" she said.\n\nJudy did not run for office while a college student, but enjoyed managing the campaigns of others.\n\n\"Political decisions affect us in important ways. It is therefore important that good, dedicated people get involved. The values taught in our sorority are\n\n4f\n\nDorothy Osier, member of the Connecticut House ofRepresentatives.\n\nwith me still and guide my decisions,\" she said.\n\nPatricia McDermott, who is run- ning for the Idaho State Senate, said that her A O I l experience helped her \"devel- op an empathy forpeople and respect for divergent views.\"\n\nDorothy Oslet, who has been a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives for 20 years, credits A O I l with teaching skills that have been helpful in political life.\n\nShe said that as a collegiate chapter president, she learned how to present herself before groups and how to speak extemporaneously in an otganized way. She also learned to be a mediator, to lis- ten to both sides of an issue, and then propose a compromise.\n\nDorothy also credits her AOIl experience with teaching her how to otganize a meeting agenda and to listen to varied opinions without letting the discussion get out of hand.\n\nThe November elections will no doubt bring victory for some AOIls and defeat fot others. They all agree, howev- er, that being in politics is worthwhile.\n\nPerhaps Jacque Dinwidde said it best:\n\n\"Working in a political campaign is not everyone's cup of tea. However, it is probably the most exhilarating experi- ence a person can have.\" $S\n\nFall 1992\n\n5\n\nAmy Jo Douglas\n\nAmy Jo Douglas, Alpha Chi (Western Kentucky U.), received the 1992 Perry Award which is given annually to Alpha Omicron Pi's most outstanding collegiate chapter president.\n\nKaren Towell, Alpha Chi's chapter adviser, presented the award at the Region V Leadership Conference in Knoxville in June.\n\n\"Amy is honest, forthright, enthusi- astic, idealistic, ethical and loving. All of these qualities are freely given to the world about her—but are given in extra large doses to her sisters,\" Karen said.\n\nShe added that she was greatly imptessed by the comments of Amy's sis- ters:\n\n\"One simply said, 'She was the best roommate I ever had.' A new initiate was touched by Amy's personal interest and was inspired to become a chapter officer. A transfer student recounted the welcome and encouragement that A m y gave her.\"\n\nKaren said that A m y truly treated her like a sister.\n\n\"She treated me as a friend and an AOI1 equal and this is no easy task because I am older than her mother and our differences are easy to see. But she dealt with our similarities. . .We freely gave each other advice and counsel and exchanged ideas at our weekly meetings. M y respect for her is limitless,\n\nas is my admiration and love,\" Karen said. She recalled that Amy's term as pres- ident had not been \"all sugar and spice and everything nice.\" She praised Amy's ability to find solutions to problems and help her chapter understand and accept\n\nAOIT policy.\n\n\"I was particularly touched, however,\n\nby the relationship this chapter president fostered between the chapter and its Re- gional Director and two very ill alumnae,\" Karen said.\n\n\"Her guidance of the chapter in help- ing these women— in providing them comfort, cheer, and support— clearly showed her appreciation of AOITs lifelong commitment. A m y recognizes the strength of the bond between all members of AOI1 regardless of initiation date or chapter.\"\n\nKaren said that the chapter had this loving experience because Amywas able to communicate the needs of these alum- nae to Alpha Chi collegians.\n\nAnother challenge Amy faced was the\n\nmanagement of a large, award winning chapter. (Alpha Chi Chapter won the Jesse Wallace Hughan Cup at the 1991 Convention in a tie with Gamma Delta, U. o f South Alabama.) A m y used this award as an opportunity to inspire her officers and sisters to even greater efforts— to always be worthy and to con- tinue to bring credir ro AOI1 and Alpha Chi alumnae.\n\n\"And, of course she succeeded. I have truly valued her judgment, advice and friendship,\" Karen concluded as she pre- sented the award.\n\nAmy's parents, Sylvia and Gary Dou- glas, attended the Rose Banquet. Arriving in time to see A m y receive the award were her brother, Jason, and boyfriend, Mark Spader. Karen had informed them in advance that A m y would receive the award.\n\nThe Perry Award is the highest dis- tinction given to a collegiate member of Alpha Omicron Pi. It is presented annual- ly to one collegiate president who has given outstanding service to her chapter, provided exceptional inspiration to chap- ter members, and received recognition by administration and/or fellow students at her college or university. In short, the recipient typifiesthe high ideals of AOU which was so beloved by the award's namesake, Stella George Stern Perry.\n\nThe Perry Award is administered by three Past International Presidents appointed by the Executive Board, each servingastaggered termofsixyears. Serv- ing in these positions this past year were Ginger Banks, Joan Deathe MacCallum, and Eleanore Dietrich MacCurdy. ^\n\nDrawing from her own experience,\n\nAmy Douglas wins the 1992 Perry Award\n\nTo Dragma\n\nBy Marilyn Haugen Tau (U.ofMinnesota)\n\nShe was the last one left standing in Dallas in 1991, signifying that she had attended more AOII Conventions than\n\nanyone else present. A n d that was the last time she will stand to be recognized at a Rose Banquet. Wilma Smith Leland (Tau '24) died on July 19, 1992, oflymphoma. She had been ill only five weeks.\n\nAs a Past International President, Wilma Leland's faithful attendance at Convention does not begin to tell of her role in AOII.\n\nyou, Wilma Leland!'\"\n\nIn 1956 Wilma became a member of\n\nthe Rituals, Traditions and Jewelry Com- mittee. A t the time, this was a lifetime appointment, and it proved to be so, for Wilma remained an active member until her demise. She served twice as chairman.\n\nWilma was elected International Pres- identofAOIIforthetermof1959-1961. Later, she routinely complained of \"mak- ing a fool of herself in the Past Interna- tional Presidents' skits at Convention. However, she always joined with good spirits in the antics of the august group known as \"The PIPs.\" She specially enjoyed Storytelling where she could share her memories of the Founders and her early years in AOII.\n\nRecognition of Wilma's service to the Fraternity continued in the '70s and '80s. In 1973 she received the Helen St. Clair Mullan Award in honor of her loyal, faith- ful and devoted commitment to AOII. Wilma was listed in the World's Who i Who of Women in 1981. In 1985 she received the Rose Award in honor of her devotion to AOITs ideals. Wilma was a Diamond Jubilee Foundation board member from\n\n1964 to 1986 when she was named as the first Trustee Emeritus of DJF. In 1987, the Diamond Jubilee Foundation awarded $1000 for a scholarship fund in recogni- tion of the 75th anniversary of Tau Chap- ter and in honor of Wilma Smith Leland.\n\nThe aforementioned are facts; but Wilma was much more than facts to each of us whose lives she touched. As one alumna said, \"She made all of us better people.. .whether we wanted to be or not!\"\n\nShe gave her best and expected and\n\ndemanded the best from each of us. Wilma experienced both joy and heartache in her many AOTI ventures, but she always rose above petty feelings and displayed steadfast loyalty to AOTI.\n\nWe AOTIs tended to assume that Wilma was \"all ours\" when she actually contributed gready to other endeavors as well. In 1937, during her tenure as editor of To Dragma, and in the midst of the Great Depression, she and her husband, Leland F. Leland, founded Leland Pub- lishers, Inc., in St. Paul, Minnesota. She handled the business side of the company which they sold in 1969.\n\nWhen she was not traveling through- out the world, Wilma was reading or writ- ing. This House Remembers is Wilma's unfinished memoir. She authored a biog- raphy of Harcourt A. Morgan, environ- mentalist and former chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority. She con- tributed articles to the University of Min- nesota daily newspaper and to Antiques Magazine. She was a charter member of the Hennepin County Historical Society. The Minneapolis Public Library benefit- ted from her donation of the \"Wilma Smith Leland Collection\" of children's books, including a first-edition Alice in\n\nWonderland novel.\n\nMentor, scholar, career woman, role model, collector, writer, friend to all ages, traveler, mother of two AOTI daughters (Nancy Poland of Bethesda, Maryland, and Paula Douthett of Milborne St. Andrew, England), grandmother, great grandmother, godparent: Wilma Smith Leland was allofthese and more.\n\nShe will be dearly missed.\n\nWilma graduated from the University of Minnesota magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1925, and she became edi- tor o f To Dragma the following year. Serv- ing as the elected (not an appointed posi- tion at that time) editor of To Dragma from 1926 to 1946, Wilma added graph- ics, headlines, and a double column layout. She also encouraged correspondence and photographs. She was elected president o f the Sorority Editors of National Panhel- lenic (the forerunner of the National Pan- hellenic Editors Conference) and served in that position from 1936-1943.\n\nA O I I Founder Stella George Stern Perry paid tribute to Wilma in the 1955 Golden Anniversary edition of To Dragma: \".. .In every best sense for 19 years, Wilma has remained young herself, kept the mag- azine young while steadily injecting into it all the qualities of firm and wise maturity. We have been enriched by her experience and the fraternity world's high esteem for her. Let me say for us all, fervently, 'Thank\n\nFall 1992\n\n7\n\nWilma Smith Leland\n\n1904 - 1992\n\nTo Dragma editor for 20 years,\n\nshe later became International President.\n\nLeadership Conference awards announce\n\nLast June, hundreds of AOIJs met at Leadership Conferences for a weekend of sisterhood, training, and fun.

This merger is the culmination of over four years of hard work and negotia- tions between the two Foundations.\n\nAt the 1991 International Conven- tion, the members of the Alpha Omicron Pi Foundation agreed to all stipulations in the merger documents. A few weeks earlier the members of the Diamond\n\nJubilee Foundation also voted to approve the documents. Upon completion of the final vote at Convention, all trustees of the Diamond Jubilee Foundation were called forward to receive the recognition they so greatly deserved for their dedica- tion to DJF throughout the years. For the merger to be official, both the Secretary of State of California, where DJF was incorporated, and the Secretary of State of Tennessee, where the A O n Founda- tion is incorporated, had to authorize the merger. Final approval was received from both states on May 6, 1992.\n\nThe AOII Foundation will carry on the work begun by the Diamond Jubilee Foundation in 1957 when DJF was formed to solicit contributions for an endowment, the interest of which would be used for scholarships for AOIIs. Through the years, DJF has awarded hun- dreds of scholarships based on academic merit, financial need, and AOFI involve- ment.

The AOII Founda- tion will also become responsible for soliciting further contributions to raise the principal in the Diamond Jubilee Scholarship Fund. As the principal increases, rhe number of scholarships dis- tributed each year will also increase. The AOII Foundation currently has four staff members who have over 12 years of\n\nfund raising experience which will be beneficial as they lend their expertise to fund raising activities for the Diamond Jubilee Scholarship Fund.\n\nRosalie Barber and Pat Mottweiler, two former trustees of the Diamond Jubilee Foundation, have joined the Alpha Omicron Pi Foundation Board of Directors. Rosalie will also serve as Chair- man of the Scholarship Selection Com- mittee. This committee will not only select recipients for Diamond Jubilee scholarships, it will also select recipients for additional scholarships held in the Endowment Fund of the Foundation.\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Alpha Omicron Pi Foundation are grateful for the trust placed in them by the members of the Diamond Jubilee Foundation and look forward to continuing the tradition of excellence begun by the Diamond Jubilee Foundation. -64\n\n<\n\nALUMNAE CHAPTER NEWS\n\nAnn Arbor\n\nLisa Aupperle reports that the Ann Arbor Alumnae Chapter had a busy spring.
