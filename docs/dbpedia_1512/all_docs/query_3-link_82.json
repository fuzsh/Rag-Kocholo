        "text": "Weimar Masonic &\n\nOdd Fellows Cemeteries\n\nWEIMAR, COLORADO COUNTY, TEXAS\n\nA HISTORIC TEXAS CEMETERY\n\nThe Weimar Masonic Cemetery is that portion nearest Hwy 90 and the eastern end. While the Odd Fellows Cemetery is basically the southwest corner with its eastern boundary being a grass-covered drive that leads to the old gazebo.\n\nThese two cemeteries have been surveyed as of June 2006 and a Directory has been erected onsite. There is a notebook within the kiosk which alphabetically lists the name of each person known to have been buried in the cemeteries along with the lot number and the grave space and any other information which is known about the person. The unmarked graves of persons known to have been buried here are also listed. On the inside walls are maps of the cemeteries to show you where to locate the lots. The survey was made by Dorothy Albrecht, Elliott Koehn, Jacklyn Bartosh, and others with Eunice Bittner, Harold Matthews, Wilton and Silva Leppin, Doris Beken, and Elsie Kahlden helping with verifying the information.\n\nPhoto of Historic Texas Cemetery marker courtesy of Joye Johnson\n\nIf you have any corrections, additions or obituaries pertaining to these cemeteries, please contact the volunteer county coordinator.\n\nText from the Historic Texas Cemetery marker dedicated on April 22, 2012:\n\nWeimar Masonic Cemetery\n\nOn February 28, 1877, Masonic Lodge No. 423 of Weimar, which had been established two years before, purchased two acres for the creation of a lodge cemetery. The property was purchased from D. W. Jackson, who had sold two adjacent acres in 1875 to Lodge 201 of the Independent Order of Odd Feloows for and I.O.O.F. Burial site. The Masonic Cemetery was enlarged in 1916 and 1944. On May 7, 1959, the I.O.O.F. Cemetery was deeded to the Weimar Cemetery Trust, legally combining the two sites into one cemetery under the Masonic name. A \"Ladies Cemetery Association\" was first established to care for the site in 1891, and Weimar Cemetery, Inc. continues today as the entity with oversight of the burial ground.\n\nHistoric Texas Cemetery — 2010\n\nThe Cemetery Directory and Dorothy Albrecht who gathered, recorded and verified the information and encouraged the construction of the kiosk during her tenure as president of Weimar Cemetery, Inc.\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nG\n\nH\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nK\n\nL\n\nM\n\nN\n\nO\n\nP\n\nQ\n\nR\n\nS\n\nT\n\nU\n\nV\n\nW\n\nY\n\nZ\n\nGo to Page Two\n\nGo to Page Three\n\nA\n\nAdams, Jewell Lois; born: Sep 12, 1910; died: Jan 27, 1985; Masonic; Lot # 415; Grave Space 2\n\nDaughter of Louis Joseph and Ora (Kister) Burger, married William Ayers \"Bill\" Adams in 1934\n\nAdams, Thomas J.; born: Dec 2, 1838; died: Jan 23, 1914; Odd Fellows; Lot # 015; Grave Space 4\n\nConfederate veteran\n\nAdams, William Ayers.; born: Jul 9, 1907; died: Jan 29, 1977; Masonic; Lot # 415; Grave Space 1\n\nAddicks, Antonia; born: Jun 23, 1913; died: Oct 4, 1975; Masonic; Lot # 071; Grave Space 5\n\nDaughter of Bohumil and Eliska (Foytik) Pokorny, married Oscar Hugo Addicks, Nov 20, 1933\n\nAddicks, Oscar Hugo; born: May 14, 1907; died: Dec 9, 1994; Masonic; Lot # 071; Grave Space 6.5\n\nSon of Albert and Bertha (Pawelek) Addicks\n\nAdkins, Elizabeth; born:Feb 13, 1933; died: Aug 14, 1999; Masonic; Lot # 161; Grave Space 2\n\nDaughter of Paul E. and Marjorie (McLeary) Grey, married D.
