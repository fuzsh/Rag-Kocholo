        "text": "From the Dean\n\nThis past year has been one of continued excellence for Alabama Law. To be sure, we have faced challenges: navigating the sea of uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, recruiting students and faculty in an increasingly competitive environment, and even recovering from extensive flooding in the Law Center following a brutal rainstorm. Still, our students, faculty, and staff have adapted commendably at every turn.\n\nWe began the new academic year ranked in the Top 25 among all law schools in the nation – number eight among publicly supported institutions. And while we continue to build a program of national stature, we remain committed to our mission to serve the people of the State of Alabama. Two-thirds of our JD students (across all three classes) qualify for in-state tuition, and in 2021, we enrolled the largest number of Alabama residents in more than seven years.\n\nAt the same time, the 1L class is remarkably diverse, hailing from 29 different states, from every region of the country. Members of Alabama Law’s new 1L class attended 65 different colleges and universities, had a median GP of 3.94 (which is among the highest in the country), and studied, lived, or worked in 43 countries outside of the U.S. I am confident that they will flourish as they expand their horizons through a legal education at Alabama Law.\n\nOur strength as an institution is also evidenced through the fruits of our program. According to data provided by U.S. News & World Report, students in the Class of 2020 who took on loans to study law graduated with the lowest average debt of any school in the Top 25. This is important because debt can influence graduates’ professional choices and opportunities. Also, as you’ll see later in this magazine, data from the ABA rank Alabama Law in the Top 10 nationally for the percentage of graduates who secured federal judicial clerkships. Additionally, 96% of the Class\n\nof 2020 are meaningfully employed or pursuing further graduate studies within 10 months of graduation. Each of these points confirms that, even in an employment market that’s been riddled with uncertainty, our graduates are prepared and are succeeding as they enter the profession.\n\nI can assure you that none of our success would be possible without the ongoing support of our alumni and friends. It is you who have built a foundation for these rising students to succeed. It is your donations that help to keep their debt within limits. And it is you who are hiring our students, providing them opportunities to build upon the legacy that you yourselves have created.\n\nI hope that you take satisfaction in the part you have played in making Alabama Law all that it is today. I extend my sincerest thanks for your support and for choosing to be a continuing part of our community.\n\nAll good wishes,\n\nMark E. Brandon\n\nDean and Thomas E. McMillan Professor of Law\n\nNews and Events from Around the Law School\n\nAlabama Law Alumna Earns Supreme Court Clerkship with Justice Thomas\n\nCaroline Stephens Milner (’18) has been selected to clerk for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas during a soon-to-be determined term.\n\nMilner is the first Alabama Law graduate to earn a SCOTUS clerkship since Charles Cooper, founding member and the chairman of Cooper & Kirk in Washington D.C., who clerked for Justice William H. Rehnquist from 1978-1979.\n\nLooking forward to her clerkship, Milner shared, “I’m truly honored by this opportunity, and I’m going to work very hard to do whatever I can to assist Justice Thomas.”\n\nUntil her clerkship begins, Milner will be working for Kirkland and Ellis in Washington D.C. Previously, she clerked for Chief Judge William H. Pryor, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, served as an associate at Bass, Berry & Sims in Nashville, TN, and clerked for Judge Neomi Rao, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nWhen asked about working with Milner, Judge Pryor said, “She is a delightful person and a great example of the high-caliber students who attend Alabama Law. They can compete with the best from any elite school. When Caroline clerked for me, her co-clerks (who were also excellent clerks) came from Yale and Chicago—and she was every bit as able as they were.”\n\nJudge Pryor also expressed his excitement for Milner’s family —specifically referencing her father Harold Stephens (‘80) and sister Jordan Hennig (‘15) who both are Alabama Law alumni and work for major law firms in Huntsville, AL.\n\nAlabama Law Student Secures Big Win for The Elder Law Clinic\n\nAs a 2L Alabama Law student, Halle Diaz represented an elderly, disabled woman at risk of being evicted from her long-term care facility due to confusion over whether she was eligible for assisted living. After months of tireless advocacy, Diaz successfully appealed the insurance termination which allowed her client to remain in their home and recoup over $25,000 in back pay.\n\nWhile Diaz’s experience is remarkable, she is just one of many Alabama Law students who are gaining experience representing clients while still in school. Alabama Law boasts six specialized clinics in which students provide free legal assistance to low-income individuals under the supervision of a practicing attorney. These clinics focus on a variety of substantive areas and cases such as civil litigation, entrepreneurship, non-profits, children’s rights, and domestic violence law.\n\nDiaz doesn’t know exactly what direction she will go post-graduation. However, she shared that her experience working this case will benefit her long-term career pursuits.\n\n“UA is an incredible law school that gives you hands-on experience. Alabama has great professors who care about who you are and what you want out of law school and try to help you get there,” Diaz explained.\n\nProfessor Dillbary Honored with Dukeminier Awards’ Stu Walter Prize\n\nProfessor Shahar Dillbary of The University of Alabama School of Law and Professor Griffin Edwards of the Collat School of Business at The University of Alabama, Birmingham were named the Dukeminier Awards’ Stu Walter Prize winners for their co-authored article, An Empirical Analysis of Sexual Orientation Discrimination, 86 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1 (2019). The Dukeminier Awards are bestowed annually by The Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law in recognition of the best law review articles concerning sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nThe study produced by Dillbary and Edwards is the first to empirically demonstrate widespread discrimination across the United States based on perceived sexual orientation, sex, and race in the mortgage lending process. From an analysis of more than five million mortgage applications, their findings reveal that any FHA loan application filed by same-sex male co-applicants is significantly less likely to be approved when compared with the white heterosexual baseline (holding lending risk constant). Dillbary and Griffin trace this pattern to sexual orientation-based discrimination despite the fact that FHA loans are the only type of loan in which discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is prohibited.\n\nProfessor Grove Selected for SCOTUS Presidential Commission\n\nIn April 2021, Alabama Law’s Charles E. Tweedy, Jr., Endowed Chairholder of Law and Director of the Program in Constitutional Studies, Tara Leigh Grove, was selected as a Commissioner for the Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court of the United States—which was formed by an executive order issued by President Biden.\n\nServing as a bipartisan group of experts on the Court and the debate over reforming the Court, the Commission consists of top legal and academic scholars from across the country, former federal judges, and leading legal practitioners.\n\nAccording to The White House, “the Commission’s purpose is to provide an analysis of the principal arguments in the contemporary public debate for and against Supreme Court reform—including an appraisal of the merits and legality of particular reform proposals. The topics it is examining include the genesis of the reform debate; the Court’s role in the constitutional system; the length of service and turnover of justices on the Court; the membership and size of the Court; and the Court’s case selection, rules, and practices.”\n\nProfessor Grove joined the University of Alabama School of Law in June of 2020. She graduated summa cum laude from Duke University and magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, where she served as the Supreme Court Chair of the Harvard Law Review. Grove clerked for Judge Emilio Garza on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and\n\nthen spent four years as an attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Appellate Staff, where she argued fifteen cases in the courts of appeals. Grove has served as a visiting professor at both Harvard Law School and Northwestern Pritzker School of Law.\n\nMilitary Veteran and Alabama Law Graduate Receives Equal Justice Works Fellowship\n\nRecent Alabama Law graduate, Scott Sloss, was inducted into the 2021 Equal Justice Works Initiative Class of Fellows. Joining a talented group of awardees among an initial pool of more than 450 applicants, Scott was one of the few students from across the nation to receive this award.\n\nRecipients of the Equal Justice Works (EJW) Fellowship can choose between joining an existing EJW program or creating a fellowship of their own that benefits an underserved community. Considering his military career and several years working with the VA,\n\nScott elected to dedicate his own fellowship to offer legal assistance to Tuscaloosa County veterans.\n\nThrough the life of the two-year fellowship, Scott will be sponsored by global companies Shearman and Sterling LLP and Thompson Reuters as he serves the nearly 10,000 veterans living in Tuscaloosa County. He will offer direct representation and legal advice for these individuals and their families and host legal clinics in the Tuscaloosa County area. Upon completion of his fellowship, Scott hopes to create a long-term clinic at Alabama Law.\n\nAlabama Law 1L Student Selected as Co-Host on “Third Degree” Podcast\n\nAs a 1L student, Kyra Perkins was selected to join Elie Honig, CNN legal analyst, as a co-host on the Café Studios Podcast “Third Degree.” Perkins was the only 1L and one of\n\njust three law students from across the country who was selected for this honor—the other two selectees being Harvard and NYU Law students.\n\nPerkins’ first appearance on the podcast was in February 2021, and she will continue to join\n\nHonig, on a monthly basis, as a co-host through February of 2022.\n\nOriginally from Birmingham, Perkins received her undergraduate degree from Emory University in economics. She chose to attend The University of Alabama School of Law after participating in the annual “Diversity Matters Open House” where she was impressed by the vast array of opportunities, including clinical experience, offered to the Law School’s students. Upon graduation, Perkins is interested in working in entertainment and media law, focusing on contracts and IP.\n\nProfessor Donovan Appointed to the Alabama Supreme Court Commission on Dispute Resolution\n\nIn February, Professor Susan Donovan was appointed to the Alabama Supreme Court Commission on Dispute Resolution. In this position, Donovan helps lead the development of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) in Alabama. Her service will run through December of 2023.\n\nAt the Law School, Donovan is the director the Mediation Law Clinic—which offers free mediation services to help families reduce the emotional trauma associated with prolonged family court litigation. In this clinic, Alabama Law students receive professional training, as they assume the role of mediator, which gives them real-world experience and prepares them for careers as lawyers and mediators.\n\nProfessor Daiquiri Steele Rejoins Alabama Law\n\nAlabama Law is proud to announce that Professor Daiquiri Steele has rejoined the School of Law as an Assistant Professor. Her research examines whether and how anti-discrimination laws help ensure equal access to employment and education—both of which are crucial determinants of socioeconomic mobility.\n\nProfessor Steele originally joined The University of Alabama School of Law in 2016 through a hybrid administrative/faculty role as Director of Diversity & Inclusion and Assistant Professor of Law in Residence. From 2019-2021, she served as a Forrester Fellow at Tulane University Law School before rejoining the Alabama Law faculty. Professor Steele formerly served as a Civil Rights Attorney with the U.S. Department of Education, where she provided legal counsel relating to federal investigations of discrimination involving the nation’s school districts, colleges, universities, and state educational agencies. Professor Steele’s scholarship has been published or is forthcoming in the Washington Law Review, Berkeley Journal of Employment and Labor Law, and Boston University Law Review, and her recent projects focus on retaliation and whistleblower statutes.\n\nAlabama Law Hosts Top Constitutional Law Professors for First Amendment Roundtable Discussion\n\nIn September, the Alabama Law Program in Constitutional Studies hosted an academic\n\nroundtable event to discuss the new book Saving the News: Why the Constitution Calls for Government Action to Preserve Freedom of Speech written by Harvard Law Professor, Martha Minow.\n\nModerated by Professor Tara Grove, director of the Program in Constitutional Studies at Alabama Law, the roundtable included a strong lineup of scholars including Martha Minow (Harvard Law School), Jack Balkin (Yale Law School), Jane Roberta Bambauer (University of Arizona Law), Leslie Kendrick (University of Virginia School of Law), Genevieve Lakier (University of Chicago Law School), Helen Norton (Colorado Law), Robert Post (Yale Law School), Geoffrey Stone (University of Chicago Law School), Nadine Strossen (New York Law School), Eugene Volokh (UCLA Law), and Jeremy Waldron (NYU School of Law).\n\nBased on the content in Professor Minow’s book, this group discussed the importance of the First Amendment and what role the government can and should play at a time when our culture has transitioned from relying on traditional fact-checked publications to consuming news through social and online media platforms.\n\nCivic Engagement: Coming Together Across Ideological Lines\n\nOne of the main purposes of the First Amendment Roundtable was to offer an experience that supports the Program’s in Constitutional Studies’ larger Civic Engagement Initiative. In this case, the roundtable created a space for a diverse group of legal scholars, who hold differing opinions and come from various backgrounds, the opportunity to work together to discuss the government’s potential role in regulating the private enterprises whose platforms facilitate the spread of information and, in some cases, misinformation.\n\nAccording to Professor Grove, “The Civic Engagement Initiative aims to facilitate meaningful conversations across political and ideological lines. That can be more challenging when people disagree about the ‘facts on the ground.’ So, it’s important to think about where people are getting their information. This event was one opportunity to consider the role of the media in our society.”\n\nUpcoming Events\n\nThe September Roundtable was just one of several Civic Engagement Initiative events the Alabama Law Program in Constitutional Studies plans to host. On January 18, 2022, the Program will be holding a panel featuring free speech experts Nadine Strossen—professor at New York Law School and former president of the ACLU, and Keith Whittington—professor of politics at Princeton University. The panel will be moderated by Professor Bryan Fair of Alabama Law, and the event will be open to the public. Additional details about this event are forthcoming. If you are interested in learning more about this panel or about the Program in Constitutional Studies, please reach out to media@law.ua.edu.\n\nClass Notes\n\nNewsworthy items of interest for alumni\n\nRashad Blossom (’05) of Charlotte, NC recently released his new book Crush Debt, End Stress: An Insider’s Guide to Bankruptcy in North Carolina.\n\nDavid R.

For the immigration bureaucracy, comprised of principally of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the challenge is substantial. Since the 1990s, Congress has expanded the grounds for deportation, rendering millions of noncitizens deportable: long- term residents and recent entrants alike. But the government cannot deport more than a small fraction of the deportable population in any given year due to insufficient resources and logistical challenges— in addition to humanitarian considerations. Accordingly, the immigration bureaucracy must select whom to pursue. Congress assigns the responsibility of setting enforcement priorities to the DHS Secretary, but the President has a key role in shaping enforcement priorities, which the DHS Secretary communicates in the form of a guidance memorandum to the DHS rank and file.\n\nMy research focuses on the role of the President in structuring immigration enforcement discretion and how different conceptions of the immigration system shape enforcement policy. Under Article II of the Constitution, the President must “take care the laws be faithfully executed.” This generally means that the President cannot suspend valid statutes, and a President who refuses to enforce the law abdicates this constitutional duty. But the Take Care Clause also empowers the President to exercise prosecutorial discretion, to decide not to pursue some offenders due to resource constraints or other considerations.\n\nThe Obama Administration: DACA and DAPA Amid Record Deportations\n\nWe saw a surge in discussion of the President’s duty of faithful execution in immigration law when former President Obama announced a program called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA), which was ultimately never implemented. A counterpart to the better-known Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, DAPA would have temporarily shielded additional deportable noncitizens from deportation based on being parents of U.S. citizens or permanent residents.\n\nThe State of Texas successfully sued to enjoin the implementation of DAPA. Raising statutory and constitutional claims, Texas argued that a policy shielding some deportable noncitizens from deportation, even temporarily, amounted to “abdication” of the duty to execute immigration law. Although the federal courts decided the case on statutory grounds rather than the Take Care Clause, scholars have debated whether DAPA amounted to presidential “abdication” instead of a more ordinary exercise of prosecutorial discretion.\n\nObama’s immigration bureaucracy implemented both targeted lenience and heightened enforcement. Known in some circles as the “deporter-in-chief” for the record number of deportations during his administration, Obama characterized his enforcement philosophy as focusing on “felons not families.” In a nutshell, he took the view that not all deportable noncitizens are the same.\n\nThe Trump Administration: The “Gloves Are Off”\n\nSince Obama left office, his successors have taken radically different approaches to enforcement discretion. For example, former President Trump took a maximalist approach to immigration enforcement. Disavowing Obama’s approach of protecting some while deporting many, Trump announced that everyone was a target. By adopting unusually broad enforcement priorities, he made virtually every deportable noncitizen a priority. But because only some can be apprehended in any given year, this approach effectively delegated to DHS’s rank and file the decision of whom to pursue. Rather than guide these officers’ exercise of discretion, Trump and his DHS leadership took the view that it didn’t matter which deportable noncitizens were apprehended—they were all equally worthy of deportation.\n\nThe total devolution of discretion to low-level officers raises questions about adequate supervision. As supervisor of the bureaucracy, does the President have the responsibility to draw lines among deportable noncitizens, given the impossibility of full enforcement? Or is it appropriate to assign rank and file officers the responsibility for deciding who stays and who’s deported?\n\nThe Biden Administration: A Thwarted Deportation Moratorium\n\nThese questions continue to dominate immigration debates in the new administration. Consider litigation over President Biden’s temporary moratorium on deportations. On January 22, 2021, Acting DHS Secretary David Pekoske issued agency guidance imposing a 100-day moratorium on most deportations. The moratorium excluded four categories of deportable noncitizens, including recent entrants and those suspected of terrorism or espionage. The Administration justified the moratorium as enabling DHS to focus its “resources where they are most needed.”\n\nThe State of Texas sued to enjoin the moratorium, citing irreparable monetary harm of not executing all final orders of removal. The federal government argued that the governing statute, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), contemplates throughgoing discretion on the front end and the back end of the removal process. For a new administration seeking to reset immigration policy and undo the predecessor’s legacy, it argued, a 100-day “pause” was a permissible exercise of discretion.\n\nThe district court sided with Texas and issued an injunction on statutory grounds. But it would be a mistake to view the district court’s decision as purely a matter of statutory interpretation. The court’s conclusion follows what some view to be the purpose of immigration enforcement, namely, maximizing the number of deportations. Through this perspective, any policy that impedes the removal of deportable noncitizens frustrates the purpose of enforcement.\n\nBut that has not always been how federal courts, or even the immigration bureaucracy itself, characterize the purposes of the immigration system and of enforcement specifically. In\n\na 2011 case, the Supreme Court emphasized the immigration bureaucracy’s need to consider a deportable noncitizen’s “fitness to remain” in the country when granting relief, gauged with reference to family ties, service in the Armed Forces, and other traditional equities. DHS’s enforcement arm also characterizes its mission not merely as deporting the deportable, but as advancing national security, public safety, and economic welfare through enforcement of the nation’s immigration laws. Not every deportation advances the agency’s mission. Not all noncitizens compete for jobs citizens would otherwise take, and few have criminal convictions or threaten national security. In some instances, deportation threatens these objectives. But if that’s true, then it becomes difficult to justify a maximalist strategy that refuses to acknowledge relevant differences across deportable noncitizens.\n\nAlthough the district court decided Texas’s challenge to the moratorium ostensibly on statutory grounds, Texas had raised a Take Care Clause claim as well. The contours of the President’s duty of faithful execution in immigration law remains an open question. In the near term, the Supreme Court may be called upon to provide answers.\n\nAlabama Law Ranks Top 10 in Federal Clerkships\n\nWritten and compiled by: Josh Bird and Heather Gann\n\nThe most recent ABA Employment Report data shows that the Alabama Law Class of 2020 ranks 10th in the nation for federal clerkship placements*. While this may be surprising to some, this standing is not unprecedented—over the past five years, Alabama Law’s aggregate clerkship ranking is, in fact, 13th nationally.\n\nThe credit for this incredible success belongs to our students for their hard work and diligence in earning these opportunities. However, their collective success does not stand in isolation. It takes intensive recruiting from an admissions office that is committed to bringing in increasingly impressive classes of first-year students year-over-year; dedicated mentorship from a talented pool of professors, many of whom have performed their own clerkships in years past; and a very proactive Career Services Office that is continually helping our students find and prepare for these opportunities. And none of this would be possible without the generous donations provided by our Law School alumni and friends. To steal from the proverbial phrase, it has taken a village to come this far.\n\nIn total, Alabama Law’s Class of 2020 had 15 students who earned federal clerkships and eight additional students who landed state clerkships. Below, a few of these students share their experiences:\n\nAnne-Miles Golson | Clerked for Circuit Judge Andrew Brasher | U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit\n\n“Whether I was analyzing briefs, observing seasoned advocates during oral arguments, or reading the Judge’s work, I was constantly learning from some of the best legal minds. I cannot overemphasize the impact that experience has already had or the confidence it has given me as I transition into private practice.”\n\nShontel Stewart | Clerked for Associate Justice Sarah Stewart, Alabama Supreme Court\n\n“I really enjoy clerking because of the relationships that are formed in close-knit chambers. I am grateful that, because of my experiences as a clerk, I will have a tool belt that is fully-equipped for legal practice. Nothing compares to the feeling of seeing a published opinion that you drafted quoted and relied upon in future cases.”\n\nAtticus DeProspo | Clerked for Judge L. Scott Coogler, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama | Clerked Judge Steven Menashi, U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit\n\n“My clerkship experiences provided me with great institutional knowledge that will be helpful as I pursue a career as a litigator—which will require me to leverage these experiences when serving as an advocate for clients. Most importantly, I gained two great mentors and role models who have supported and advised me as I make decisions about my legal career moving forward.”\n\nStephanie Avant | Clerked for Judge Madeline H. Haikala, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama\n\n“Not having to do the same thing day in and day out is undersold, because it makes you and outside-the-box thinker and that is what will set you apart from others who graduated with you or even before you.”\n\nMcGavinn Brown | Clerked for United States District Judge L. Scott Coogler, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama| Clerked for Judge Eugene Siler, U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit\n\nClerking has been useful for at least two reasons. For one, it’s given me confidence. I think most new lawyers, me included, have a healthy (or unhealthy) dose of imposter syndrome. Clerking can be a Wizard-of-Oz-like experience; you see that most lawyers—young and old—encounter difficult questions every day, and everyone is just doing their best to figure it out. Second, clerking has given me a chance to improve my writing and research skills. I’m excited to finish this second term and start working with clients of my own. I thank Alabama Law for all of the opportunities it’s afforded me.\n\nLeading With Experience\n\nMany of the professors and staff members at Alabama Law performed clerkships as well. In doing so, they understand the importance of these experiences and they are able to help prepare the next generation of students to qualify for these most prestigious positions.\n\nHeather Elliott, Alumni, Class of ’36 Professor of Law & Chair of Alabama Law Clerkship Program | Clerked for Judge Merrick Garland, U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit | Clerked for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Supreme Court of the United States\n\nAs the chair of the Law School’s Clerkship Committee, I am lucky enough to help students find post-graduate clerkships with federal and state judges at all levels. I work closely with Dean Megan Walsh of the Career Services Office and with other faculty to ensure that students are aware of clerkship opportunities and know how best to seek them.\n\nI understand how valuable these experiences are, because I was a law clerk: I clerked for then-Judge Merrick Garland of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and for the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court. Both expected a great deal, but neither sought anything from their clerks that they didn’t demand in triplicate from themselves. Serving as a law clerk taught me how to be a better thinker, a better communicator, and a better person. I delight in helping our law students find opportunities for similar experiences.\n\nRonald Krotoszynski, John S. Stone Chairholder of Law & Director of Faculty Research | Clerked for Judge Frank M. Johnson Jr., United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit\n\nAt Alabama Law, we can teach students the legal rules of the road—but we cannot teach them practical judgment about how those rules work in the real world. In a federal judicial clerkship, a law clerk learns how legal rules, many of which contain more than a little play in the joints, actually map on to particular facts and circumstances. The kind of practical wisdom that a law clerk obtains from working with a federal judge is something that we just cannot replicate in a classroom; it’s a particularly useful, and valuable, way of learning by doing.\n\nTo learn more about the Alabama Law Clerkship Program, please contact Heather Elliott (helliott@law.ua.edu).\n\nDid you know?\n\nCaroline Stephens Milner, a member of the Alabama Law Class of 2018, was recently selected for a clerkship on the Supreme Court of the United States with the Honorable Justice Clarence Thomas.

Gold\n\nWhen we think of prosecutors, we typically think of full-time, salaried, government employees. But those who watched the murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin saw another model on display—volunteer prosecutors. Volunteer prosecutors are in fact surprisingly common, albeit not in murder cases. They exist in state and federal prosecutors’ offices in urban, suburban, and rural areas. Some cities have large volunteer prosecutor programs. Until last year, a large Minneapolis-based law firm provided a steady stream of pro bono attorneys to the local prosecutor’s office—prosecuting hundreds of misdemeanor cases each year against disproportionately Black defendants. That program lasted for 42 years. Other volunteer prosecution occurs outside a formal program, whether as full-time unpaid employment or part-time pro bono practice. To gain a better understanding of volunteer prosecution, I examined news coverage and interviewed law school career services employees. I wanted to understand why people volunteer as prosecutors, why prosecutors’ offices hire volunteers, and how we should think as a society about volunteer prosecution.\n\nWhy Do We Have Volunteer Prosecutors?\n\nThe primary reason that prosecutors’ offices hire volunteers is straightforward: to bring more prosecutions than they otherwise could with their limited budgets. The Los Angeles City Attorney, for instance, was transparent about the benefit of volunteers: “If it wasn’t for this [volunteer prosecutor] program, we wouldn’t have a criminal division.” The U.S. Attorney in Nashville explained that volunteer prosecutors allowed his office to “do more cases.” Houston partnered with local law firms to launch its volunteer prosecutor program when the county refused the District Attorney’s request to hire more paid prosecutors.\n\nThe more complex question, perhaps, is why would someone prosecute for free? One important reason is to gain an employment advantage. Some recent law school graduates volunteer as prosecutors because they hope to get a paying job in that prosecutors’ office or elsewhere. Perhaps the DA’s office in their home county does not have an opening when they graduate but expects to have one soon—come work here until we have an opening, the DA might say, and then you’ll have a leg up for that position. Other graduates cannot find paid employment, so they gain work experience and the resume boost of working in the DA’s office. Some law schools subsidize that volunteering to help their alumni get a foothold. Volunteer prosecution is not limited to recent graduates though. Later in their careers lawyers may volunteer as prosecutors (and sometimes as their full-time jobs); one reason is to pave a path to political or judicial office.\n\nPeople prosecute for free not only to gain employment advantage. Some want to serve their communities and promote public safety. We could think of this as altruism. At least for some, however, locking up members of an outgroup might be what sates that desire to promote public safety, whether consciously or not. It is tempting to say that lawyers giving their time to gain valuable case experience and supplement the government’s scarce resources is noble and good; it is a “win-win,” as one U.S. Attorney put it. My point is that we should not jump to that conclusion so quickly.\n\nTempering Enthusiasm\n\nVolunteer prosecution should give us some pause when we reflect from a critical distance. Criminal codes are vast, and prosecutors have sweeping discretion about how to implement them. The most important constraint on prosecutorial discretion is limited budgets and the ensuing need to prioritize some cases over others. Yet volunteer prosecution allows the government to evade that constraint to bring more low-level cases than elected officials have been willing to pay for. In this way, volunteer prosecution—much like other criminal law practices such as asset forfeiture or fines and fees—allows prosecutors to cast a wider net than their budgets would otherwise permit.\n\nLast year saw sweeping protests in many parts of the country advocating a smaller footprint for criminal law. Aggrandizing prosecutors’ labor force so that they may cast wider nets does the opposite. That most volunteer prosecutors focus on misdemeanor and petty offense cases raises substantial racial justice concerns too. Misdemeanor defendants are even more disproportionately people of color than are felony defendants. Volunteers thus allow prosecutors’ offices to bring more cases disproportionately ensnaring people of color than they otherwise could. Those concerns led a Minneapolis law firm to cancel its volunteer prosecutor program in the wake of George Floyd’s murder.\n\nParting Thoughts\n\nIn closing, I want to briefly raise another concern: perhaps volunteer prosecution, like unpaid work in other economic sectors, favors those with wealth. Who can afford to work for free after law school, sometimes for several years? One answer is people whose families will pay their expenses. Skewing the prosecutor workforce toward those with familial wealth would be troubling. Prosecutors wield massive discretion against largely poor defendants. Prosecutors from wealthier families may have a harder time identifying with largely poor defendants and may thus be overly punitive because they view the defendants as “other” rather than as people like themselves who made a mistake.\n\nI do not seek to besmirch those who volunteer as prosecutors because that is the most promising route to their dream job or because it allows them to gain skills while seeking paid employment in other types of law practice. And I believe that many people prosecute for free out of a desire to serve the public. But I seek to temper enthusiasm for such programs by analyzing systemic concerns that are easy to overlook amidst the desire to praise volunteer work; I question whether expanding the reach of criminal law to sweep in more low-level offenses actually serves the public well.\n\nIn sum, volunteer prosecutors represent a complex phenomenon that offers important benefits to the volunteers. But volunteer prosecutors are not the win-win that some have publicly claimed them to be.\n\nRising Tide Capital Campaign\n\nThis Fall, the University of Alabama kicked off The Rising Tide Capital Campaign—which is scheduled to run through September 2026. Joining the University’s efforts to raise $1.5 billion during the campaign, the School of Law has set a goal of $30 million—all of which will directly benefit the next generation of students and faculty at Alabama Law.\n\nTo acknowledge the many donors who are supporting the Law School’s fundraising effort, Dean Brandon introduced The 50 |150 Capital Alliance. The name of the Alliance is linked to two important anniversaries, each of which Alabama Law will celebrate in 2022: the 50th Anniversary of the graduation of the first African American students at Alabama Law and the 150th Anniversary of the founding of the School of Law. The 50 | 150 Capital Alliance consists of a community of alumni, students, and friends who have chosen to invest in the Law School’s future by making financial contributions to the Law School during the Rising Tide Capital Campaign.\n\nOur Competitive Edge\n\nAs a Top-25 Law School – Top 10 among publicly supported law schools – Alabama Law has established itself as a long-standing institution that is committed to serving the state of Alabama while simultaneously building a nationally renowned program. However, this momentum forward cannot continue without the ongoing financial support of alumni and friends.\n\nPaula Hinton, Chair of the Law School Capital Campaign Committee, urges alumni to give back to the law school that “set each of us on our course.”\n\n“Every donation matters—large or small—in helping the students who have followed after us. We owe it to the legal community and to Alabama Law,” said Hinton.\n\nShe explained that donors can request how they want their dollars to be used. This offers the satisfaction of knowing what specific student, faculty member, program or other aspect of the law school has been helped and/or enhanced through each gift.\n\n“Each of us has the responsibility,” says Hinton, “to do what we can to support the next generation of students at Alabama Law and to make our legal profession better.”\n\nMaking an Impact\n\nEvery year, one fortunate and hard-working Alabama Law student is awarded the Frank M. Johnson, Jr. Memorial Endowed Scholarship—a fund that was formed in memory of Judge and Mrs. Johnson by his former law clerks.\n\nTyler Smoot, a 2021 Alabama Law graduate who was the recipient of this scholarship during the final two years of his law school, credits the financial support of this endowment for providing the means to allow him to earn his law degree.\n\n“I never would have been able to go to law school in the first place without my tuition being covered. I have a wife and two kids and because of this scholarship my kids are able to have food on the table and go to daycare while I earn my degree,” Smoot explained.\n\nUpon graduation, Smoot began a federal clerkship with Judge Karen Bowdre in Birmingham and he hopes to lead a career in civil rights law.\n\nWhen reflecting on how the Frank M. Johnson, Jr. scholarship has helped set the stage for his career, Smoot shared, “Because of this scholarship, I can actually find a job in something I’m passionate about instead of settling for the first one I’m offered because I’m worried about my debt. I can focus on creating some positive change and I’m just really glad that someone, somewhere believed in me.”\n\nWe need you help\n\nExperiences like Tyler’s are not possible without generous donations from alumni and friends.
