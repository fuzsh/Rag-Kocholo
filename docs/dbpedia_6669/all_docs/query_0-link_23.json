        "text": "There is First class. There is simple class. There is no class. Then there is David Portnoy. The man behind \"Barstool Sports\" issued a self-aggrandizing and pathetically zero class video to celebrate the latest demise of the website, \"Deadspin\". Sure, there's something to be said for healthy competition. But when a multi-millionaire takes great delight in seeing real journalists, (something of which he has never employed in the life of his often-insulting juvenile web products), fired and without work in a difficult time for media employment, then it takes on a new and bottom-feeding level. Portnoy has become wealthy from shoveling to the lowest common denominator, so this is nothing surprising. I know. I was there when he started his company. It is possible to be a winner and have class. It is also possible to not be a raging jerk in denigrating people when they are at their lowest point. It is possible to communicate a level of professionalism and to rise above every fray. Think about taking that better road should something like this cross your path. Portnoy will just mock them for nothing more than frat boy social media gratification. Be better than Dave Portnoy. It's not difficult at all. #class #socialmedia #communications #corporate #personal #professional #image #integrity #leadership #dontbeajerk #CEO #CFO #humanrelations\n\nWhat drives you? One of my supposed-to-be most embarrassing professional moments keeps me going today. In 2019, I was pitching an unusual PR stunt to media ‚Äì my dryer vent cleaning + maintenance client was attempting to compile the largest ball of lint, then to be set on fire to illustrate its danger in homes. Odd? Yep. Out of the ordinary? Yep. Newsworthy, too? I thought so. The attempt was hopefully going to be a Guinness World Record, and a licensed adjudicator agreed to attend. I pitched dozens of reporters across all mediums leading up to the big day (TV, radio, written). One national reporter took exception to my pitch, and she let that be known. She politely passed via email reply to me, and then on a big radio program ‚Äì she laughed at the pitch‚Äôs merit, naming me, my client and the laughable pitch idea. Related (I thought) she wrote about strange successes, weird stories and funny businesses. A big ball of lint seemed in this vein, at least to me. I first learned about my new radio spotlight when I came into work the morning after it aired, as us PR folks track mentions of clients + such across media. Believe it or not, I saved the audio clip. I sent it to my boss. It motivated me. In the coming days, I kept pitching the ball of lint. And it hit ‚Äì really well. It was discussed on CNN, written about on CBS, Yahoo, MSN; ball-of-lint TV segments syndicated across more than 200 local channels. It was so successful that (after the fact) Guinness asked if they could showcase the media results as a case study for future businesses considering record attempts. Here that is below, and needless to say, the record was broken: https://lnkd.in/dTScvJ8N\n\nWell, Ancient Crunch Inc. didn‚Äôt get mad when I offered some unsolicited advice. Neither did Toto or Bold Bean Co. So let‚Äôs see what happens when I apply my way of writing to this Jenny Craig ad. The headline I‚Äôd try if I could: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre reading this ad, you‚Äôve already started.‚Äù Why? When I worked on the account a few years ago, the client told us, people who come to Jenny Craig have tried six or so major diets. So after all that, what do you think the subconscious mind (whose job is to protect us from pain and ultimately keep us alive) would say to this ad? ‚ÄúNOT AGAIN.‚Äù So my headline might (let‚Äôs test it Jenny) help give that reluctant reader enough credit for what they‚Äôre doing well (the cornerstone of my writing philosophy) to click, where the copy would continue in a caring, human, understanding way to continue the empathy and only then offer a discount. I‚Äôm not saying this ad doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm asking, is it leaving a whole bunch of clicks on the table ‚Äî representing a bunch of people this program could help? Thanks! #brandpositioning #subconsciousmarketing\n\nWhy is Aaron Rudman-Hawkins moving his arms with such vigor you ask? üëê Well it's another week and another visit to one of our awesome clients! üôå No matter how many times I watch this man work, it never fails to impress me! I wasn't sure what this post would be when I started writing but I guess it's now an Aaron appreciation post üòÖ But seriously, this man knows his stuff! The first time I watched him pitch, it took him 5 minutes to know more about the business than the potential client did! ü§Ø Every time he talks to our clients, his commercial led approach speaks volumes and makes so much sense! üìà And of course, as Aaron often says Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS), and that's what we do. We only do things that make sense at The Evergreen Agency. ü§î We don't put the cart before the horse üêé We use data to inform our decisions üìä We take things step by step, making sure the people we work with understand everything along the way (so many don't do this!). That's the Evergreen way üòâ #evergreen #agency #video #commercials #inspire\n\nHow do you fold in the cheese?!?! When it comes to the difference between brand voice and content tone, nothing illustrates it better than this classic scene from Schitt‚Äôs Creek. David and Moira have two distinct personalities. As characters, they‚Äôre VOICES are completely different. Even if you were reading instead of listening or watching, you would be able to tell the difference. David is quick-witted, dry, neurotic, and opinionated. Moira is flowery, critical, formal, and flighty. But notice how, in this scene, their tones are very similar. They‚Äôre both aggravated, tense, pessimistic, and a little sarcastic. As a brand, your voice is the core of who you are and should stay consistent. On the other hand, your tone can change with the situation. #brandidentity #toneofvoice #brandedcontent #contenttips #technicalstorytelling"
