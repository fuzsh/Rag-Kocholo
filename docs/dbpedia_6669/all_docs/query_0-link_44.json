This deeper analysis of our work will transfer to a more engaged stage application that we will discover through investigative practice. Using technology that meets each students’ requirements, the student will create a language and story for their compositions that will develop throughout the semester and eventually follow from the studio to the stage (and vice versa). This is a class where the student will become comfortable with their work, from a variety of angles and magnifications, so that they have more clarity of their capacity as artists, songwriters, and producers. Not only have the lines blurred for producers, but between the role of the artist, songwriter and musician alike. We are in an era where we have the opportunity to become self-sufficient in our practice, and take charge of our sound from a deeper perspective. The relationship we have to the production, as well as the technical and aesthetic control of that production, will help us to maintain a better communication with our practice.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nREMU-UT 1013 Surround & Immersive Sound Recording: A Mixed Reality (2 Credits)\n\nTypically offered Fall of even numbered years\n\nThis class builds upon the techniques of the recording studio and the techniques of producing recorded music begun in Engineering the Record I, IIand Producing the Record Side A and B and will explore advanced techniques used in surround and immersive sound recording and mixing.

Over the course of the class, through the utilization and knowledge of these various skills, students will learn how to create Original Music Compositions & Productions. The primary DAW platform for the course is Ableton. While a Beatmaker / Composer / Producer must be well versed in the application of various software and hardware tools, as well as the many Production skills & techniques, they must also have artistic vision and creative efficacy. So while the course is about Music / Beat Construction and the tools involved, there will also be a strong emphasis on innovative envision, inventive mobility, and how to think / strategize like a Music Producer.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1017 The Virtual Producer: Live Performance with Laptops & Software (2 Credits)\n\nWe are currently in the midst of a generational shift in the fundamental instrumentation of the live performance of many styles of music. As in the 1950’s when live groups shifted from woodwind and brass lead instruments to the electric guitar, today live groups are increasingly moving away from electric guitars and other traditional rock/pop instruments toward digital instruments. Today’s performer in many styles of music will often find themselves either performing with or alongside a laptop/computer, usually running Ableton Live. The “laptop” person in a band has become an integral part of live groups and having the skills to fill this increasingly important role will make our graduates more in demand in live performance roles, particularly if they are also accomplished instrumentalists and/or vocalists. People who know and understand techniques for synching computers with live performers and visuals are also in demand as designers and engineers for large scale concert tours and spectacles like Cirque du Soleil. Having visited the set of Broadway musicals, it is clear that programming and running laptops to coordinate music, visuals and lights is becoming integral to musical theater performances as well. This course will teach some of the techniques required to utilize laptops in live performance, integrate the technology into bands with live instruments and vocalists, as well as multi media applications (i.e sync to visuals, lighting, etc.). It will focus on using the Ableton Live software which has become the industry standard for live performance tasks. This course will culminate in a live performance at the end of the semester in which students will be required to do a performance incorporating live instruments and vocalists, laptops, MIDI controllers and visuals.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1020 Digital Audio Workstations: ProTools (2 Credits)\n\nTypically offered Fall, Summer, and January terms\n\nDuring this course, students will acquire an in-depth, theoretical and practical knowledge of Digital Audio Workstations using the industry standard Pro Tools software through a weekly, lab-based workshop.

One of the most versatile of today’s platforms which can be used in production, live performance, and even as a visual tool is Ableton Live. Ableton is unique amongst the contemporary software programs making music in that it is the only one that was created by working musicians who were looking for a tool that allowed for both the seamless creation of ideas and could also serve as a performance instrument. In the past 15 years, Ableton has played an important role in creating countless tracks and records in numerous genres and the go-to software for live performance, whether for vocalists and bands or for massive spectacles like Cirque du Soleil. In this course, we will cover Ableton's unique abilities to manipulate audio which make it the preferred platform for remixing and mash-ups. We will cover the fundamentals of the software, explore techniques to program beats, chordal and melodic ideas, as well as cover creative workflow - how to use Ableton to quickly generate ideas for producers and songwriters. Finally, we will discuss its use as a live performance tool for use with live instrumentalists and vocalists, as a DJ tool and even as a VJing tool.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1037 Professional Development: Internship (1-4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered Fall, Spring, and Summer terms\n\nAll Recorded Music majors are required to complete at least one internship for a minimum of 2 credits in order to graduate.

Intuitive software design, plus short-cut “how to” videos and websites can make for rewarding early experiences for the DIY engineer, but those resources may only tell part of the story. A producer or engineer’s versatility and efficiency are often limited without a deeper understanding of the processes. This course aims to help students understand fundamental principles that form the basis of tried and true recording techniques, allowing them to make informed decisions in each stage of the recording process and, ultimately, make better recordings. Through a series of discussions, hands-on exercises, recording sessions, and projects, students will learn about the propagation of sound, microphone design and implementation, signal flow, basic signal processing, and fundamental recording and mixing techniques. Emphasis is placed on critical listening, preparation, class participation, professionalism, and teamwork.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1041 Engineering The Record II (2 Credits)\n\nTypically offered Spring and Summer\n\nEngineering The Record II builds upon the fundamentals of sound recording established in ETR I. Through a series of discussions, hands-on exercises, and recording sessions, students will refine their skills in the recording studio from the organizational, technical, and creative/artistic points of view. Integrating skills from Critical Listening for The Recording Studio and Writing the Hit Song, student teams will reverse-engineer a well-known recording and reproduce it as a “sound-alike.” Emphasis will be placed on critical listening, preparation, class participation, and teamwork.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1052 Mix Intensive (2 Credits)\n\nTypically offered Spring\n\nAs with literally every facet of music production, mixing audio had been hugely impacted by the paradigm shift created by digital technologies. That said, the architecture and function of virtually all digital software and hardware is based on the models developed through analog hardware and processing. The objective of this seven-week intensive course is - using the best and most appropriate of both the digital and analog tools - to refine our mixing skills and expand our repertory of techniques. This will include both digital in-the-box processing and analog processing ? console (via SSL and API) and outboard equipment, and combinations of the two.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nREMU-UT 1061 Mastering the Record (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered Fall\n\nMastering is the last creative step of production and the first technical step of manufacturing, broadcast, or distribution. Artists, producers, and record labels demand proper mastering to insure that their product holds its own in the marketplace and insist that none but the most qualified ears master their music. Now, with the rise of music downloads, Internet radio, high-resolution discs, streaming and many other forms of distribution, a solid understanding of mastering techniques and new media is vital to the music professional. The course provides an in-depth exploration of the tools and techniques involved in professional mastering. The course will endeavor to illustrate the powers of mastering as well as its limitations. A wide range of processing techniques and advanced editing methods will be demonstrated and compared. Tools of the trade will be surveyed with emphasis on what distinguishes hardware and software as truly \"mastering grade.\" Critical listening and the psychoacoustics of decision-making will be explored. Students are taught how to better master their own productions, as well as to recognize when to turn to a mastering professional. Emphasis will be on listening and objective comparison in guiding the mastering approach and in judging its success. Ample real-world case studies will be used to demonstrate approaches and results. Students will do their own mastering on material supplied by the instructor, as well as on each other's music, for critiques and comparisons. Attention will be given to how to prepare for a professional mastering session and how to interact with the mastering engineer. Assignments are drawn from the instructor’s day-to-day work as a mastering engineer. For the final assignment, students will be grouped into two-person teams. Team members will trade positions as “client” and “mastering engineer,” each mastering the other’s production. Students will visit the instructor’s commercial mastering studio to hear their work and to observe the instructor’s approach to some of their productions.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1070 The Art of Recording Classic Drums (2 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nDrum sounds have the potential to exhibit as much personality on a recording as a vocalist or soloist but we seem to have lost the 'art' part of realizing great drum sounds. Drum sounds can be difficult to obtain if the engineer has not done some 'great master' engineer archaeology. Through this course with Drummer/Producer Rich Pagano, the creative student will learn the techniques necessary to expand their acoustic drum-sound \"library.\" This hands-on studio course covers techniques of drum and head selection, micing, tuning, 'room' sound beauty and phase while recording and recreating the \"classic\" drum sounds typified by Led Zeppelin, Abbey Road, Motown, Blue Note Jazz, punchy '70s and more. In the end, we will apply it all to a 'modern' drum sound realm.The workshop will be complemented with extensive historical documentation culled from personal interviews with engineering legends, session set-up sheets and studio photos.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1087 New Perspectives in Latin Music: The North (2 Credits)\n\nIntegrating aspects of music appreciation and rhythmic training, this class will explore the broad stylistic diversity of Latin American music today by tracing the roots of some of its most impactful styles and connecting them with its newest manifestations.

From monaural sound to stereophonic sound, analogue to digital audio, or NTSC and high definition television to virtual reality, the audience is now provided with a natural, life-like three-dimensional aural experience. Unlike anything heard before, immersive audio creates the sensation of height all around the listener, transporting them into a more thrilling and deeper audio experience. Surround sound works because of the four ways humans perceive sound: audible, binaural, spatial, and cognitive. A surround sound mix often allows for more intimate, quieter overall sound as there are more point sources to deliver unique sounds for the ear to perceive. Compared with two-speaker, conventional stereo, surround sound offers better perception of object and sound location. Listeners more readily identify the general direction from which sounds are initiated with more accurate perception of tone due to the additional placement options of sound sources. There is also a significantly greater perception of ambience, since the listener can be more immersed in the listening field. But, what does all of this mean? Only by listening with a tuned and critical ear can one make critical evaluations.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1102 Critical Listening for the Recording Studio (2 Credits)\n\nTypically offered Spring\n\nIn order for the budding producer to realize their potential in the studio, the ability to describe what is being heard and the skill to articulate possible audio issues is a necessity. Critical listening skills take years to develop and this course is designed to speed up the process of creating ?Golden Ears? and give the student a head start. Through listening exercises, students will develop critical listening skills. Using pink noise, students will learn to identify frequency ranges, boosts and cuts in the theoretical as well as in the practical using music. Weekly drill sets will include: A/B Drills, comparing original recordings with altered versions, identification of time delay, and the onset of reverberation. The course will use the David Moulton?s Golden Ears CD?s and The Producer as Composer ? Shaping the Sounds of Popular Music by Virgil Moorefield as texts. Note: There is a lab fee for this class.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1104 CDI Music Incubator (4 Credits)\n\nThis course is an independently funded incubator where enrolled students will serve as the support structure for selected Clive Davis Institute artist projects. By augmenting or acting as the selected artist’s team, students work closely with the instructor, the artist and invited music industry collaborators to provide real time support which may include management, label services, marketing and promotion, publicity, A&R, creative direction, branding and vision, social media, business planning, content creation and day-to-day logistics. Students will be given a budget to coordinate and execute agreed and defined strategies and plans created in conjunction with the artist, with the goal of furthering the artist's career development.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1105 Writing The Hit Song (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered Fall\n\nThis course introduces students to the art of crafting hit songs. We study the ?great? writers of popular music, from Irving Berlin to Babyface, and we make practical applications of that knowledge as we craft songs both collaboratively and individually. Students gain a rudimentary knowledge of musicianship, as well as an overview of the pragmatic aspects of commercial songwriting, including copyrighting and publishing. Note: There is a lab fee for this class.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1106 Musicianship: Music Theory & Construction. (2 Credits)\n\nTypically offered Fall\n\nThis course emphasizes a no-nonsense and demystifying presentation of the three elements of music — rhythm, melody, and harmony. You will review and analyze a variety of musical examples — written and recorded — to demonstrate these concepts with a focus on contemporary western music (everything from the Beatles and Stevie Wonder to Wilco, Radiohead, and Katy Perry). The second half of the course is a practical application of the tools. You will learn how to transcribe rhythms, hear chord progressions, and arrange and compose at a basic level. The goal of the course is to enable you to break down a song competently and have a fuller appreciation of what producers/arrangers/composers/songwriters do — skills you will undoubtedly need for a career in the music industry.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1107 Topics: Punk Rock (2 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nIn this course we'll look at how punk exploded in both London and New York in the 1970s, and how the two scenes, though widely divergent in ideals and sound, nonetheless helped shape one another. Discover the tactics that shook up a complacent music industry, overthrowing 1960s rock gods with the raucous, amphetamine punk revolution that still resonates in the sound and style of bands today. The proliferation of independent labels, spearheaded by Rough Trade, became a DIY (do it yourself) model that would be followed round the world and is particularly relevant today as musicians increasingly turn to the Internet as the most immediately effective outlet. Music we'll listen to may include The Sex Pistols, the Clash, and the Slits; film screenings may include The Great Rock 'n Roll Swindle and Rude Boy; and readings may be culled from books by Steve Blush and others.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1109 Podcasting: Crafting Narrative in Audio (2 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nScripted podcasting has emerged as a powerful cultural force, and has created its own brand of storytelling. This 7-week course, taught by award-winning producer Chris Morrow (“Mogul,” “Summer of ’85”) takes students through the research, construction and scripting of narrative podcasts, with a special emphasis on stories related to music and the arts.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1114 Topics in Recorded Music: Fela Kuti (2 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nEnhanced by multiple samplings by hip-hop artists, a successful international musical and an upcoming Hollywood feature film, Fela Anikulapo-Kuti's popularity has exploded since his passing in 1997. Now Fela's fame and authority has ascended to its rightful place in the pantheon of inspirational activist artists like Bob Marley and John Lennon; the first and - so far - only artist from Africa to attain that level of recognition. In this course we examine a number of topics related to Fela and his music and politics: the history of colonial and post-colonial Nigeria; Nigerian traditional and indigenous popular music and their relationship to global pop; Yoruba arts, culture and spiritual beliefs; the intertwining connections between African and African-American music that underpin Fela's sound, Afrobeat; Fela's family history; his unique trajectory as an activist artist who evolved his own sound, Afrobeat; the formative phases of his musical and political development in Nigeria, London and Los Angeles; his role as bandleader and the opening of his club, the Shrine and his state-within--a-state, the Kalakuta Republic; the truth behind the sensational aspects of his lifestyle; Fela's provocative defiance of a series of military dictatorships and frequent incarcerations; Fela's music and lyrics and their co-relation to his times; his relationship to the African and global music business; Fela's relationship with women. Afrobeat Aesthetics; Fela's visual representation of his message; his and the Queens' fashion and dance style.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1115 Topics: Led Zeppelin (2 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nIn name alone, Led Zeppelin carries mountains of meaning: the most successful and arguably the most influential rock band of all time. The creators of a mythic, mystical, guitar-based style that gave birth to the sounds and iconography of heavy metal. Song-crafters whose studio mastery, utilizing recording technology of the day, generated some of the most enduring rock recordings of their era, establishing standards that still define a stylistic and emotional extreme of popular music. The four British musicians who came out of the electric blues scene of the late ‘60s, recording and touring as a unit for a mere twelve years, together achieved a legendary stature that requires much study to fully appreciate more than thirty years after their demise. This course will consider the history of Led Zeppelin from a variety of perspectives: social and stylistic context; the nuts and bolts of their music—live and in the studio; the hows and whys of the band as a business. Using books, articles, videos, and a generous sampling of music, the course will follow their arrival in the final, psychedelic heyday of swingin’ London of the ‘60s; through their roots in folk and acoustic blues and later experimentations with Indian and North African music, and their rise in an era that was hungry for a heavier, more bombastic sound. The course will include special focus on the group’s technical leader and visionary, guitarist Jimmy Page, who came with prior credits as a sessionman and guitarist in the blues-rock band the Yardbirds, as well as other major players in the Zeppelin story—engineer Glyn Johns, manager Pater Grant—who helped build the sonic and popular juggernaut that the band became. In-class guest speakers will be featured, many who participated or witnessed the Led Zeppelin phenomenon, as well as a screening of the group’s concert film The Song Remains The Same.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1116 Topics in Recorded Music: Aretha Franklin (2 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nIn the world of popular music, the word ?soul? has come to mean so many things ? a style, a sound, an attitude, a way of singing, a way of belonging. And a way of categorizing music for the sake of bringing it to market. Yet, there was a time that ?soul? referred to a very specific kind of music in a very specific time and place. This course will trace the exciting history of soul music and the enduring culture that sprang from it, beginning with the rise of rhythm and blues in the ?50s, through the turbulent ?60s, to its crowning moment in 1967 with the arrival of its best-known avatar, the Queen of Soul -- Aretha Franklin. Through reading, discussion, listening sessions, guest speakers and video presentations, we will consider: the various definitions of ?soul?, the roots of soul music and the stars of the style. How the music reflected the social and political spirit of the ?60s, and predicted the triumphant future of black music in America. How the consideration of soul music necessarily raises issues of racial identity, conflict, and dialogue. How the continuing dialogue between white and black America takes place in a musical arena that we still label ?soul?. We will also trace the gospel birth, ?pop? musical development, and explosive arrival of Aretha Franklin ? the ?Natural Woman? whose voice delivered Soul into mainstream popularity and brought African American authenticity into the popular realm. We will look at the many ways that soul music morphed after the ?60s,giving rise to black musical styles like funk, disco, and hip hop, and focus on the evolving relationship of soul music and American race relations as well. This path of inquiry will offer a means to understanding the continuing impact of the music and culture of the soul era, as well as Ms. Franklin?s continuing reign.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1119 Topics in Recorded Music: Bob Marley & Postcolonial Music (2 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nOften described as “a prophet,” the pioneer Bob Marley transcended the genre he helped develop, Jamaican reggae, to become a musical and revolutionary leader of the 20th Century. On the way, the bi-racial Marley smashed restrictions of race and class imposed on his generation by the colonial system. How did Marley, an effectively fatherless child from a tiny village, achieve his rise to global authority and influence, musically, socio-politically, spiritually, personally and in terms of the industry? Vivien Goldman was Bob Marley’s trusted chronicler and has written two books about him. We will examine the history of Jamaica, its culture and connection with Britain; Marley’s evolution as a writer and musician; his creative partnerships with artists like The Wailers and dubmaster Lee Perry; his lifelong battle to control the business of his music; and his commitment to pan-Africanism and Rasta as a way of life. There will be Special Guests and Screenings. Experience this rare opportunity to learn about Bob Marley from someone who first worked with him at his record company, Island, then wrote about him at home, on the road and in the studio.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1122 Topics: Diasporic Sounds (2 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nIn the early modern era, the movement, migration, and dispossession of Europeans and Africans to the “New World” encouraged the transmission of diverse cultural practices within new contexts. In particular, the “African Diaspora” was forged, as multiple tribes and ethnicities were forcibly transported throughout the Americas during the Atlantic slave trade. In the Americas, varied forms of traditional African life and culture were both preserved and transformed within the confines of enslavement, while distinct ethnic practices converged in newly formed communities and settings, as well as in relation to (ethnic) European Diasporic practices. The topics of this course will travel across the Atlantic and three centuries, as we explore how the sounds of the African Diaspora have been (per)formed, transmitted, circulated, and commodified within the development of popular sounds in the Americas. Diasporic Sounds will begin by engaging the spiritual, improvisatory, rhythmic, and corporeal aspects of how sounds of the African Diaspora were (re)created throughout the New World. Focusing on the United States, the Caribbean, and Brazil, this course will continue to explore the ways in which these diasporic sounds both related and differed across regions and contexts, reflecting the diversity implicit within how we investigate (Africa’s) Diaspora. While the course considers the specific contexts of Africans throughout the Americas, students will gain an understanding of the relationship between identity and popular sound by considering how sounds of the African Diaspora became thematized, commodified, and circulated in the context of an increasingly industrial and globalized world economy during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. As we explore the range, singularity, and hybridity of (African) Diasporic sounds, we will also cover a number of genres and their performers, including (but not limited to) the folk spiritual of the U.S., Haitian Compas, blackface minstrelsy, samba, Hip Hop, Bomba, Cuban jazz, and reggaeton, in addition to styles such as bluegrass, techno, and British soul.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1124 Topics in Recorded Music: John Coltrane (2 Credits)\n\nFifty years after his death at the age of 40, John Coltrane still stands as one of the most legendary and celebrated cultural heroes of the 20th century. He’s revered as a patron saint of creative discipline and artistic commitment far beyond the realm of modern jazz, the musical arena in which he excelled. His compositions are widely known and his saxophone sound often imitated, and instantly recognizable: brittle, dark, and deeply searching—a sonic signature that has become a standard for the ideals of musical freedom, personal expression, and spiritual priority in popular music. Today, Coltrane’s influence stretches throughout the musical sphere—from rock and hip hop to classical and electronica—pushing a sense of individual identity and political stance. Yet, despite universal adoration, Coltrane’s life and music remain an enigma: more praised than examined, more acknowledged than fully understood. Offered to NYU students as a means to understanding and learning from John Coltrane’ story—and applying those lessons of his career to their own music—each session in this ambitious seven-class course offers twin components. One part focuses on historical-critical studies: while completing focused readings, and undertaking listening and viewing assignments, students investigate the social, cultural, musical and business aspects of Coltrane’s recordings and other accomplishments. The other portion of the course deals with musicianship, performance, composition, and production: listening closely to Coltrane’s music and completing in-class and out-of-class assignments under careful mentorship, deconstructing Coltrane’s compositional and studio choices, and working collaboratively to create, refine and produce original musical works.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1129 Topics:The Motown Legacy (2 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nStarted in 1959 in Detroit by songwriter and then budding entrepreneur Berry Gordy, Motown quickly became dubbed \"Hitsville USA,\" as it served as home to artists like The Supremes, The Temptations, Mary Wells, Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder, Martha and the Vandellas, Michael Jackson and the Four Tops, to name a few. Motown literally changed the concept of the record label and redefined the very idea of entrepreneurship in recorded music, serving as core inspiration to artists from The Beatles to Beyonce. Motown's incredible legacy of success served a crucial role in helping to integrate popular music and thereby helped to rewrite the narrative of race and class in America. One of the greatest examples of an artist expanding the boundaries of his art, of his company?s limitations, of the public?s expectations, and subsequently of what it meant to be a pop artist, is the album What?s Going On by Marvin Gaye, issued by Motown in spring 1971. As we narrow our focus to study this album its roots, its creation, the difficulty with its release, its astonishing success students will be introduced to the legacy of Motown Records. Readings, class lectures, guest speakers, video and audio clips will answer the questions, Who was Marvin Gaye? How did he get to a place where felt he needed to create this album? Why was it difficult for him to get the song and the album released? What was Motown doing politically the years before? What was company policy that created an issue around the album content? What did it mean to be an artist and a producer at Motown or not?\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1143 Topics in Recorded Music: David Bowie (2 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nDavid Bowie’s life and work offer a template for how to survive and continue to evolve as a musical artist. David Bowie has kept the music industry, his fans and the world guessing throughout a career that spans over four decades. Bowie himself put his secret best in his prophetic 1972 song, “Ch-ch-ch-ch Changes”; a multi-talented performer, writer and visual artist, Bowie has played his career like an instrument, selecting trends of every generation to process, absorb and adapt into successive phases of his ever-evolving chameleon persona. In this day of ceaseless multiple media, Bowie’s most recent, and typically perverse, coup was keeping secret the recording of his 2013 album, The Next Day, over a two-year recording period. The manipulative bravado of knowing when and how to keep a star’s inaccessibility and mystery, or to expose oneself, as Bowie did on TV in his own darkest days, has given David Bowie a singular, enduring mystique, glamour and respect. Examining the arc of his work is a window into significant scenes of every decade since the 1950s, and offers insight into: the British Blues scene that produced the Beatles and the Rolling Stones; the hippy free festival counter-culture; r’n’b; futurism; electronica;glam and gender games, improvisation; soul; funk; dance; disco; minimalism; ambient; avant-garde theater; and above all, the endlessly evolving sound of US and UK young clubland, including recent jungle and garage, to which Bowie consistently returns to recharge and find a new direction to make his own.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1144 Topics in Recorded Music: (2 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nRarely does one group capture the sound and spirit of an era, then expand their original music concept—through songs, film, and even the business of music itself—to a degree that their echoes can be clearly heard forty years later. The Talking Heads, the New York foursome that were born in the cultural maelstrom of New York’s punk scene of the 1970s, achieved all of that and much more in their fifteen year history. Led by forward-thinking frontman David Byrne, the group were the apotheosis of what an “art band” should sound like, driven by musical curiosity while rocking hard and maintaining popular embrace. The band’s timeline encompasses the musical development of popular American music from the ‘70s until now, touching upon groundbreaking trends (punk, disco, World Music and hip-hop), technologies (synthesizers, sampling), musical approaches (song constructionism, lateral thinking), themes and arguments (artist-as-producer, musical imperialism.) That Byrne’s own career continues to produce singular music is further proof that the enduring impact of the Talking Heads is due for serious academic study.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1145 Topics in Recorded Music: Prince (2 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nOne of the top-selling and most gifted and musically versatile artists in the history of popular music, Prince remains an enigmatic and visionary multi-talented performer, songwriter and producer. Prince’s unique history is worth deconstructing: when the 19-year-old shopped his music to recording companies in 1977, he demanded creative control. In a striking move Warner Brothers Records, with no precedent, gave it to him, kicking off a longstanding, groundbreaking, genre-straddling career that continues to this day. To this day, Prince’s music addresses sexuality, politics, social issues and personal identity in a way unseen in previous generations of popular music. He confounded his core R&B audience with New Wave experiments; angered his rock following with gender-bending displays; caused the government to force the recording industry into parental advisory labeling; frustrated his label with non-commercial choices, challenging the notion of what is commercial; established his own label; melded the live and recording business with unique delivery systems of his output, and much more. Prince’s trailblazing path was a prime example of the strength of a new generation of Midwestern, baby boomer performers who carried a bold “Gen X” attitude: Prince (from Minnesota) was born in the same three-month period as Madonna (Michigan) and Michael Jackson (Indiana). This class, through readings, music listening, video clips, film screenings, special guests and performances, will explore the joys and contradictions of Prince’s music and business practices.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1147 Topics in Recorded Music: Sound Studies & Pop Music (2 Credits)\n\nTypically offered occasionally\n\nIn the past few decades, “sound studies” has emerged as an official field of critical inquiry: it is best defined as the study of the production, circulation, and materiality of sound and its historical, social, cultural and political effects. Investigating sound — beyond investigating music alone — is a fascinating and rich way to engage in the power and politics of pop music performed by artists as wide ranging as the The Velvet Underground, The Smiths, Nina Simone, Sun Ra, Kendrick Lamar, and FKA twigs, and to delve into the powerful writing of scholars like Daphne A. Brooks, Alexandra T. Vazquez, Gayle Wald, and Alexander G. Weheliye. This course offers an overview of the sound studies with a focus on how the burgeoning interdisciplinary field’s diverse range of issues and methodological questions contribute to ways of writing music criticism on popular music. Students will specifically consider how becoming more aware of our relationship to sound in its various forms creates new ways of understanding how race, gender, and sexuality are heard, felt, and experienced in popular music. Topics and approaches to sound studies discussed in the course include the following: how theories and concepts of listening, of the voice, of noise, and of affect and/or emotion relate to the formation and production of racial, gender, and sexual difference and vice versa; understanding sound reproduction in relation to technology and audiovisual media; and how sound or soundscapes structure everyday life. Students will be asked to experiment with their writing in weekly response papers on music that both students and the instructor will share with the class as well as with critical karaoke presentations. At the end of the course, weekly response papers will be collected into a portfolio, which will include an introduction by students that summarizes their writing for the course. Additionally, students will have the opportunity to create their own experimental sound pieces as well as attend a music performance in New York City, for which students will write reviews that incorporate sound studies theories and concepts.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1153 Race in American Popular Music: From Blackface Minstrelsy to Hip Hop (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered Fall of even numbered years\n\nThe history of popular sound in the United States illuminates how music, movement, and performance are key to a contemporary understanding of how individual and group identity has been composed throughout the nation’s history. Unpacking this sonic history reveals how identity is connected to how race is heard, both historically and at present. In this course, we explore how race is constructed in the development of global popular music and the culture of sound in and before the 20th century in the United States. This course, in particular, will especially focus on music of the global African Diaspora from the late nineteenth century until the 1960s. We will examine how the sounds and performance of blackface minstrelsy—the first native form of popular music in the U.S.—became the basis of contemporary popular sound, ranging from Tin Pan Alley to blues and jazz, as well as to country and rock ‘n roll. Irving Berlin, Big Momma Thornton, Elvis Presley, The Supremes, Johnny Cash, Mick Jagger, Tina Turner, and Jimi Hendrix are but a few of the many artists who will be considered in relation to the history of American popular music and (racialized) sound. Students will consider critical race theories, primary and secondary accounts of popular performance, as well as selected audio and visual material to investigate how race ties into various ideas about individual and community identity, nationalism, and imperialism. In addition, students will gain a nuanced understanding of the relationship between sound, race, and American Music, as they develop critical listening skills to deconstruct how music is performed, heard, and embodied in more contemporary contexts through lectures, discussion, as well as multimedia and written projects. While racial identity will remain central to how we deconstruct the sounds and performance of popular music, aspects of identity such as gender, class, and sexuality will also be closely considered.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1155 Topics in Recorded Music: Gaming (2 Credits)\n\nTypically offered Summer term\n\nFortnite’s concerts with Marshmello and Travis Scott. Open Pit’s DIY music festivals in Minecraft. League of Legends’ K-pop and hip-hop groups. Indie label Monstercat’s deals with Rocket League and Roblox. Sony Music’s gaming imprint Lost Rings. Grand Theft Auto’s 75 billion minutes of in-game music listening. “Fantasy record label” apps like FanLabel that allow fans to assemble their own “brackets” of artists that they think will do best on the charts. These are just a handful of examples of how music and games are increasingly overlapping as industries, experiences and cultures. There are strong mutual incentives at play: Game developers are blooming into full-fledged media brands and are looking to the music business for both financial and cultural capital, while music companies are looking to diversify their revenue, experiment with more interactive technologies and tap into the power of highly engaged communities online. In the process, this merging of entertainment worlds is also rewriting conventional wisdom of what it means to be an artist, a performer, gamer and especially a fan. This course will give students the critical frameworks and vocabulary to dissect how games are being incorporated into every corner of the music industry — from the moment music is created, to the strategies that inform how music is then disseminated, marketed, monetized and performed. We will draw from a combination of theoretical readings and real-world case studies to dissect video games that center music in their player experience on the one hand, and musical projects that draw direct inspiration from games in their approaches to design, marketing, business and fan engagement on the other hand. Because this field is relatively new, many of these case studies may emerge in real time as the course unfolds. This course will be reading-, writing- and play-intensive, with required and suggested games and soundtracks for students to play, watch or listen to every week. Throughout the course, students will have the opportunity to workshop their own creative, marketing and/or business strategies for hybrid music/game projects, walking away with a concrete plan of action for incorporating the fast-paced gaming industry into their own careers.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1157 Popular Music and Protest in the 21st Century (4 Credits)\n\nThe aim of this course is to explore how popular music has been used as an instrument of protest, with a special focus on twenty-first century developments. Although the 1960s is often regarded as the “golden era” of protest music in the United States, many events that have occurred in and outside the nation since 9/11 have led contemporary pop musicians to accept the charge left by musician and activist, Nina Simone: “An artist’s duty, as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times.” Thinking through significant American events—including, but not limited to, September 11th 2001 (“9/11”), the re-election of George W. Bush in 2004, Hurricane Katrina, the 2008 financial crisis, same-sex marriage debates, global warming debates, the Presidential election(s) of Barack Obama, the #BlackLivesMatter movement, the nomination of Donald Trump as the 2016 Republican Presidential candidate, and—this course will consider the following questions: What constitutes “protest music” in contemporary popular culture? How do artists create music that inspires others to resist, exist within, or even recognize structures and systems that limit the freedoms of individuals and communities throughout society? How are “isms” and “phobias,” such as racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, Islamophobia, etc., addressed in popular music, and what are the aesthetic, lyrical, and performative characteristics that contribute to the creation and reception of that music? How have technological developments (i.e., the Internet, social media, streaming music, etc.) impacted the way in which artists, producers, and consumers use music as a tool for social activism and protest? What are the possibilities and limitations of protest music within the global capitalist economy in which popular music circulates? After a brief introduction to the history of protest and music in the U.S. at least since the 1960s, each week will focus on a significant moment of crisis or significance in the history of politics and popular music between 2000 and the present. We will consider how these moments were reflected in or sparked by musical and communal protests, as we engage in close readings of selected songs, albums, and video recordings by artists such as Beyoncé, The Dixie Chicks, Lady Gaga, John Mayer, M.I.A., TV on the Radio, John Mellencamp, Pink, Frank Ocean, Kanye West, Hoozier, Erykah Badu, PJ Harvey, J. Cole, Tom Waits, and Kendrick Lamar. In addition to these close readings of performances, we will consider both journalistic and scholarly writings that inform the week’s topics and musical analysis.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1159 Recycling Pop Music: Innovation and Originality (4 Credits)\n\nTypically offered Spring term of even numbered years\n\nIn music, is anything really original? The cry of “All music sounds the same these days!” is not just a contemporary critique; it has been a perennial complaint throughout the history of pop music. This class – a collaboration between the History, Writing & Emergent Media and Performance and Songwriting areas of the Clive Davis Institute – will grapple with the vital role that recycling plays in the creation of music, and thus offer divergent and often counterintuitive perspectives on creativity and originality. Through the course of 14 weeks, we'll look at the nature of creation and creativity, and also the way that ideas are reused and renewed; from classical interpolation of folk songs; to basic chord progressions; to cover songs; to the rise of remix; to the cultural thunderclap of digital sampling and its legal implications; to technological trends and fads. Each class will work through a pertinent cultural case study. Part history, part songwriting and production course, the work will be both mental and physical, philosophical and creative, as students will be asked to not only read, write, and debate, but also to complete several music and media composition and production exercises. By exploring the real nature of musical influence and innovation from historical example and through personal practice, students will discover liberating notions of authorship and artistry, enabling them to relinquish the quest for the new, and empowered with techniques to create the good and the vital.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1160 Queer/Popular/Music (4 Credits)\n\nQueer theory is a scholarly field that might be applied to the study of popular music to illuminate how queerness shapes and is shaped by popular culture. This scholarly field emerged out of LBTQ and queer studies to destabilize normative categories of gender (male/female), sexuality (heterosexual/homosexual), and their power relations that have structured American society. Even though queer identities, experiences, and lives have become more accepted in contemporary culture, queer performers still remain largely marginalized in popular music. However, queer performers and queer performances have always been central to popular music and culture, contributing to the destabilization of systematic gender and sexuality norms. This course will explore the relationship between queer theory and popular music, as we consider ways that the spectrum of queer identities has been articulated, constructed, performed, and consumed within popular music and society at large. In addition to introducing students to foundational texts in queer theory and identity studies, we will critically consider how the lives, performance, music, and reception of selected musical figures have contributed to the conversation of queer identity and sexuality in popular culture—from the blues of the 1920s to trap music of the contemporary era. While the class will focus on specific eras of popular music and selected artists, each class will concentrate on a topic that considers queer theories, reading practices, and performances to explore the myriad ways queer identities are central to and impacted by popular culture and society at large. We will also consider how queer identities in and out of popular music are mediated by culture and societal norms, and how these identities are further impacted by race, class, gender, and religion. Bessie Smith, Rosetta Tharpe, Billy Strayhorn, Little Richard, Fanny, Sylvester, Annie Lenox, George Michael, Prince, Meshell Ndegeocello, Ru Paul, Frank Ocean, Lady Gaga, Young Thug, Azalea Banks, and Tyler the Creator are but a few of the artists and cases we will consider within our application of queer theory to the analysis of popular music, sound, and culture in this course.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1161 Activism, Identity and Sound: 21st Century Jazz (2 Credits)\n\nThis course will engage with the contemporary and changing jazz scene — including the work of dynamic artists like Esperanza Spalding, Ambrose Akinmusire, Nicole Mitchell and Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah — as a means of telling “new” stories about jazz (with a special focus on identity, activism and the representation of traditionally marginalized voices). Conventionally, the story of jazz has often been upheld in terms of cultural triumph, as a transcendent response to African-American struggle. Jazz has also usually been presented as a story of succession, a chain of creative genius passing from one ‘Great Man’ to the next. These have been persuasive frameworks that define the art form by a canon and a fixed set of values, inscribing a kind of perimeter. What happens outside that borderline — the legacies of multiple avant-gardes, the work of cultural or commercial hybridists, and all too frequently the voices and vantages of women — is by this definition marginal, almost literally an outside concern. This class seeks to correct that marginalization by focusing on issues of intersectional identity and activism (including the #metoo and #blacklivesmatter movements and much more) as they relate to the evolving nature of 21st century jazz. Over the years, jazz has evolved with its circumstances through every station of its history—whether that meant tailoring performances to the length of a 78-rpm record or holding up a mirror to the moral and political turbulence of the 1960s. So the complicated cultural and technological landscape of the early 21st Century provides us with an exciting model for reconfiguring jazz history. In this course, students can expect to learn more about jazz music, as well as issues of identity, intersectionality, and activism, and to read pertinent cultural theory. We’ll also discuss how changes in the music refract and absorb our current political climate. By way of lectures, readings, guests and more, we’ll explore how the music we (mostly) call jazz can still engender a pointed expression of identity and culture. This class is held in conjunction with Winter JazzFest NYC.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1163 Topics in Recorded Music: The 1980s (2 Credits)\n\nThis class will analyze how specific changes in the way popular music was produced, distributed, promoted and categorized during the 1980s led to the economic and legal challenges which began to erode existing business models within the entire multinational music industry from the 1990s on. We will often look beyond major label hits to see the profound influence underground dance clubs and emerging trends had on the mainstream. As we listen to songs like Blondie's \"Rapture\"(1981), The Clash's \"The Magnificent Dance,\" (1981), \"Sweet Dreams\" by the Eurythmics (1982), Talking Heads's \"Slippery People\" (1983), Run DMC's \" It's Like That\" (1983), Shannon's \"Let the Music Play\" (1983), Dhar Braxton's \"Jump Back\" (1986) and Keith Sweat's \"I Want Her\" (1986), students are expected to become familiar with the pivotal changes in musical taste and production techniques that occurred during that landmark decade. This will include the innovative role that specific digital drum machines and sampling keyboards (Linn, Juno, Casio, Roland) played on breakthrough singles like Devo's \"Whip It\" (1980), D Train's \"You’re the One for Me\" (1981), Soul Sonic Force's \"Looking for the Perfect Beat\" (1983),) and Janet Jackson's \"What Have You Done for Me Lately\" (1986). Digital instrumentation and storage mediums comprehensively transformed the dominant sound of '80s studio recordings and remixes. Students are expected to assess how bedroom MIDI studios, affordable sampling technology, and the cost of commercial CDs vs. rampant bootlegging would later bring troubling new legal concerns to bear upon record companies during the 1990s. We’ll consider how these intellectual property issues culminated in battles over the paradigm-shifting file sharing software that prefigured today's music streaming systems. From a business perspective, students will also learn about the significance of shifting regional and national trends in music radio through the 1980s (as measured by “R&R” magazine ratings and ad rates). This will lead to a better understanding of how music video outlets, major label promotion strategies, and multiple recording formats (vinyl, cassette, CD,) popularized new artists. (Hello, mixtape culture!) A major aim of the class — which will focus on changes in R&B and rap music due to dance clubs and remix culture— is for students to develop a greater understanding of the impact of socioeconomic factors on '80s pop music trends. By the end of the class, students should also have a greater general recognition of the volatile dynamic of systemic racism on national chart position, radio formats, and record sales. Feminist initiatives will be viewed through a more culturally inclusive Post-Colonial Womanist lens. The rising popularity of reggae and other “world music” will see us discuss issues of cultural imperialism, authenticity and appropriation. We’ll also look at the impact British post-punk and new wave artists like The Clash, The Specials, Joy Division, Art of Noise, Soft Cell and Adam Ant had on both classic and college rock radio in the U.S., as well as how AIDS and multiple drug epidemics reshaped the American dance music market. Students should be able to trace how multimedia documentation and corporate sponsorship by companies like Swatch Watches (Fresh Fest) and Budweiser (Superfest) helped mainstream the hip hop underground. Students will recognize and appreciate how a sudden pivotal influx of black music executives facilitated more artist-owned imprints and more artist rights.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1164 Advanced Workshop for Music Journalists, Writers, and Curators (2 Credits)\n\nIn this independent study, students with a demonstrated interest in music writing, journalism and/or curation will have the opportunity to pitch a long-form project or several smaller pieces (reviews, blog or vlog posts, podcasts, artist profiles, interviews, etc.); draft, write and rewrite; and have their work edited by one or more professional instructors culled from the Institute’s Writing, History & Emergent Media Studies full-time faculty. This course serves as a companion and contributor to students’ Professional Development coursework and is relevant for entrepreneurial writers, journalists and curators who are in the process of launching writing- or reporting-centric business ventures (including, but not limited to: ad-supported blogs, online music hubs, documentary video projects, audio or visual podcasts or album box sets with a strong written / liner notes component). This course is repeatable for credit, and is open only to Recorded Music majors.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: Yes\n\nREMU-UT 1166 Topics in Recorded Music: The Hip-Hop/Jazz Continuum (2 Credits)\n\nOn the surface, hip-hop and jazz might seem to be different genres, born of different histories. Jazz emerged in the 1920s and prioritizes traditional musicianship; hip-hop emerged in the 1970s and favors non-traditional approaches, such as its inaugural trope of two turntables and a microphone. But it’s more progressive to consider jazz and hip-hop as two interrelated personas of black music, connected by a shared interest in black aesthetics—including improvisation, flow, groove, vibe, antiphony/call and response, emotionalism/feeling and percussive attack. This unique course sheds a light on the ongoing and intertwined historical relationship between jazz and hip hop: early 70s artists like The Last Poets and Gil Scot Heron broke new group by conducting early prototype rapping over jazz grooves; by the late 1980s, intrepid hip-hoppers like Stetsasonic, Jungle Brothers, A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, and Public Enemy crafted original rhythm tracks drawing on jazz samples from the likes of Maceo Parker and Lonnie Liston Smith. The alternative hip hop movement known as Native Tongues—groups like ATCQ, De La Soul, Gang Starr, Black Sheep, and Digable Planets) forged new bohemian ground, toying with low-end rhythm and sonics. R&B visionaries of the 1990s like D’Angelo, Erykah Badu, The Roots, Slum Village and J Dilla, and Lauryn Hill fused R&B, soul, hip-hop aesthetics and jazz into a seamless ‘neo-soul’ movement, paving ground for today’s music leaders operating at the nexus of jazz and hip-hop like Anderson.Paak, Badbadnotgood, Robert Glasper (and his various bands), Kendrick Lamar and Chance the Rapper. Each class is divided into two components: the first half of each session focuses on historical-critical studies about the relationship between jazz and hip-hop. While completing focused readings, and undertaking listening and viewing assignments, students investigate the social, cultural, musical and business aspects of the relationships between hip-hop and jazz. The second half focuses on musicianship, performance, composition and production. Listening closely to music and completing in-class and out-of-class assignments under careful mentorship, students investigate compositional and studio choices at the nexus of hip hop and jazz, and work collaboratively to create, refine and produce their own original musical works.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1167 Topics in Recorded Music: TDE, SZA, Kendrick & the Power of Collectives (2 Credits)\n\nIn our industry’s history, a select few record companies were more than mere mechanisms for the production and distribution of popular music. From early Atlantic, Motown, and Stax; to Philadelphia International; to Def Jam, SST, and Roc-a-Fella, some record labels have been artistic collectives of true believers with an aesthetic and cultural mission that altered the pop landscape. In this 7-week course, we explore one of the most impactful production collectives of the past two decades, Top Dawg Entertainment, founded in 2004 in Southern California by Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith; and which launched the careers of the singer SZA, the rappers Jay Rock, Kendrick Lamar, ScHoolboy Q and Ab-Soul, and sound technicians MixedByAli and Sounwave. In so doing, TDE revitalized West Coast hip-hop and American R&B, creating a platform for a group of esoteric Black creators from marginalized communities that ended up not only dominating the pop charts, but scored a Pulitzer Prize. This class puts the work of TDE in the context of post civil-rights, post-9/11 and post-2008 economic crash pop culture and criticism. In particular, students can expect to address topics like: the rise of resurgent radical Black politics (Black Lives Matter, NFL football protest, etc.), the growing popularity of Black existentialism, as well as burgeoning interest in Black power aesthetics and other cultural initiatives. We’ll also look at TDE’s blending of past and present, specifically, how the group’s synthesis of ‘90s Los Angeles rap, Southern psych-rap and New York rap and R&B catered to older and younger listeners, music nerds and casual observers. We'll think about the larger context in which TDE’s music exists: that includes unpacking how its music has unfolded in different ways through the Bush, Obama and Trump presidencies; the 21st century impact of technology and social media on popular music; musical and sonic changes revolving around jazz, rap, soul, and electronic dance; and it includes thinking about TDE’s work in relation to the work of peers like Odd Future, Dr. Dre, Nicki Minaj, Snoop Dogg, OutKast, the Roots, Drake, Kanye West, Common, Wu-Tang Clan, Three 6 Mafia and Jay-Z. Each session will include readings, listening, multimedia presentations and performances to help explore the music of TDE from a variety of perspectives.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1168 Topics in Recorded Music: Amy Winehouse/Erykah Badu (2 Credits)\n\nBritish singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse had a relatively short musical career in the 2000s and 2010s before her passing — only two studio albums in total — but the impact she left on global popular culture remains revelatory. Merging vintage jazz and old school R&B with contemporary trends in pop, and hip-hop songwriting and production, vocalist Winehouse broke provocative new ground as a fledgling songwriter on her first album Frank (perhaps most notably on the genius single “ Fuck Me Pumps” co-written by producer Salaam Remi); then rose to prominence on the heels of her Mark Ronson produced 2007 Back to Black, a Grammy-winning album featuring trenchant autobiography, Motown and Phil Spector era girl-group sounds, insouciant dance tunes, and stark heart-torn balladry, delivered with Brit-punk irreverence. Though her life was cut tragically short by addiction issues, Winehouse is emblematic of several trends coming together at once: the Brit-pop resurgence of the late 2000s (Lily Allen, Corinne Bailey Rae, Adele, Duffy, etc.), the decade’s retromania for nostalgic sounds, the return of a neo Ronnie Spector ‘bad girl’ culture in pop music, a post-feminist appropriation of punk rock arrogance, and the insurgence of a stylized all-genres approach to pop consistent with the “anything goes” rise of YouTube and streaming service culture. However, Winehouse did not rise to popularity in a vacuum. Though jazz songstresses like Billie Holiday are often cited as Winehouse’s influences, she herself has cited Mahalia Jackson, Dinah Washington, and Texas-born Young Disciple expat Carleen Anderson, as singers she admired; moreover, the so-called “neo-soul” and black bohemian artists of the late 1980s and 1990s created the immediate template that made space for the ascent of Winehouse in the 2000s. In particular, Dallas-reared singer-songwriter Erykah Badu deserves significant recognition for fusing together jazz, R&B, and hip-hop in the late 1990s around old-school solutions. Late 1990s and early 2000s classic albums like Baduizm and Mama’s Gun created the stylistic arena in which those aforementioned singers of the late 2000s would experiment, and Badu’s underappreciated late 2000s New Amerykah sets — to say nothing of her iconic fashion and boho-spiritual Soulquarian style — would provide the template for Black Lives Matter informed, art-as-activism, albums which would arrive in the next decade by artists like Solange, Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar. From different sides of the pond, and born of different eras, Badu and Winehouse can be seen as symbolic sister rebels cut from the same punky, irreverent, revolutionary spirit. This class primarily juxtaposes the two icons, illuminating the historical tensions between whiteness and blackness; between vaudeville and the black chitlin’ circuit, between Tin Pan Alley and the Brill Building, between an individualistic, anarchic British Jewish woman and a collective-minded, post-Hip Hop Dallas-born African-American “race woman.” Each session in this two-credit, seven-class course will include readings, listening, multimedia presentations and performances, plus a variety of special guests, to help explore the music and life of both of these icons, and where they intersect, from a variety of perspectives.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1170 Women as Entrepreneurs in Popular Music (2 Credits)\n\nTypically offered Fall of even numbered years\n\nWomen are making significant contributions as creative and business leaders in all areas of the music industry. In this course, students will learn about entrepreneurship as a process that can be applied to launching and sustaining a successful creative business enterprise in the music industry. Students will first engage in a historical and critical examination of the role that women have played, and the skills that have enables them to succeed, as creative and business leaders in popular music. Class discussions will focus on helping students identify and develop the skills and strengths they need to become future artistic and business entrepreneurs. Guest speakers will include women entrepreneurs who are leading companies and who have successfully started their own business ventures in the music industry. Students will learn the circumstances and strategies behind their success. By the end of the course, students will put together an individual short term and long term plan to advance their careers as future executives and leaders in the music industry.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1171 Reimagining the Music Industry: Black Power, Control and Equity (4 Credits)\n\nThis 14-week colloquium puts students in direct conversation with executives, entrepreneurs, and artists to answer the question: What would a truly equitable music business look like for Black Americans? The music business was founded in the early 1900s, in the midst of the Jim Crow era, and the modern industry still retains its contours. Segmented into market sectors which segregate both artists and executives by race and ethnicity, the business of music — by structure and design — continues to place white executives in charge of marketing a culture largely derived from Black Americans, while placing artists and executives of color in marginalized positions. And yet, the narrative of the music business has not been one of constant defeat for Black Americans. In fact, most of the progress out of Jim Crow has been the result of a succession of Black entrepreneurial successes and victories; and these strategies give us also a great sense of possibility. The American music industry, like so many other institutions, is currently being challenged by coalitions and initiatives, as never before, to confront and overcome its deep structural inequities. Racism is far from the only problem: There is the systematic diminishment and exclusion of women; patriarchy and sexism are twinned with and reinforce white dominance. Instead of incremental reform, what actions could we take, both inside and outside the business, to create more radical models that no longer disenfranchise Black people, diminish women, and center whiteness? The final projects will put these ideas into the forms of actionable proposals and business plans.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1172 Radical Experiments in Music Producing: Theory, Philosophy, Practice (4 Credits)\n\nMany modern music legends achieved their level of singular greatness by instinctively or intuitively making radical, left-curve artistic decisions. Think of James Brown staying on the \"One\"; John Cage closing the piano lid and sitting still for 4'33\"; David Bowie creating lyrics through a random text generator. Miles Davis committing jazz heresy with cut-n-paste post-production techniques. In some cases, these creative decisions were so galvanizing that they irrevocably shifted entire worlds of music-making and they altered the very possibilities of artistic discourse. Many achieved this not merely by breaking convention or habit, but by some alternative philosophical stance and strategy (often called radical thinking): reimagining creative approaches and musical concepts; avoiding rules by creating new ones; embracing mistakes and inviting happenchance. This hybrid course blends writing/history/emergent media studies and production studies. The dual purpose is to serve as an introduction to a liberating creative strategy based on a philosophical stance, and an invitation to apply that philosophy to actual music-making. The course will familiarize students with a wide stylistic range of music-makers who employed radical-thinking approaches as a means to creating music, engaging with disruptive theories and/or experimenting with technologies and ideologies, from Oliver Messiaen, John Cage, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Ornette Coleman, Miles Davis, Archie Shepp, The Art Ensemble of Chicago, Yoko Ono, Anthony Braxton, Henry Threadgill, Brian Eno, Sun Ra, Laurie Anderson, Meshell Ndegeocello, Oneohtrix Point Never, Blood Orange, and Kanye West. Students delve into diverse histories of artistic improvisation, chance, intuition, free expression, stream of consciousness, and other approaches. Students will read work on musical freedom and risk by writers like David Borgo, David Toop, and others, as well as investigating anti-normative movements like Dadaism and Fluxus, as well as artistic practices like oblique strategies, generative music, free jazz, and the habitorium. Then—with direct guidance from the production co-instructor, a radical music creator in their own right—students will divide into teams, and the co-instructor will interact with the student teams for 3 or 4 weeks, guiding and helping to develop specific project ideas. Furthering upper-level studies in REMU classes like Experiments in the Future of Performing and Experiments in the Future of Producing, students will be encouraged to explore risky, alternative, and radically experimental avenues of artistic creation. By the end of the course, each team will have produced two or three projects—recordings, multimedia presentations, and/or performances—incorporating ideas and strategies that reflect the historical and cultural avant-garde principles they have been studying. Students will discover a vocabulary and establish a foundational understanding of the concepts and history of the topic. The final week may include a class presentation of the top project from each team, with musicians and/or industry guests commenting on each. The ultimate course goal is for students to break out of routine and create outside the box through exposure to new frameworks, through the shattering of norms and habits, and through an embrace of the unconventional, weird, the out-there.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1173 Topics in Recorded Music: Mariah Carey (2 Credits)\n\nIn the 1990s, Billboard named singer-songwriter-producer Mariah Carey the most commercially successful artist of that decade. Today, she remains the eleventh top-selling artist in music history. Though her commercial relevance is undeniable, there has been minimal scholarly investigation into Carey's cultural importance, and the widespread influence of her musicianship and artistry. That neglect is profound, because few artists have had as much impact on vocal style as Mariah Carey, and her inspirational ballads and dance tracks have transformed the sound and feel of pop. Her massive success across styles like pop, R&B, and hip-hop has also changed the industrial business of superstar-oriented popular music. This first-of-its-kind course proposes to deconstruct Mariah Carey's legacy, with a special focus on issues of race, gender, celebrity, globalization and spectacle. Among topics we'll consider: Mariah Carey's use of melisma; the politics of camp, diva-dom and flamboyance; bi-racial identity and passing; changing 90s definitions of the mainstream and alternative; femininity, control and freedom (economic, vocal, etc.); Carey's outsize success at making Christmas music; how and why women of color tend to become marginalized in pop even as they remain at the center of its very construction.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1174 Topics in Recorded Music: Taylor Swift (2 Credits)\n\nThe name “Taylor Swift” has become synonymous with a number of big ideas. To some in the music industry, the eleven-time Grammy winner (including three Album of the Year awards) defines 21st century country music’s pivot to pop radio. To others, Taylor Swift is the pop star of the 2010s (with the album sales and chart history to back it up— With sales of over 200 million records worldwide, Swift is one of the best-selling music artists of all time). When deployed pejoratively, however, the name “Taylor Swift” can signal anything from white privilege to white feminism to white taste in an era of intersectionality and Black Lives Matter conscientiousness. Taylor Swift may be a loaded phrase for some, but the career of Taylor Swift is more simply an embodiment of music’s American Dream. Raised on a Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania, teenage Swift would move to Nashville and become one of the most lauded young songwriters in history. Her music was infatuated with love, innocence and romantic fantasias that would sour in the natural way those fairy tales do as a young woman grows up. By her early twenties, she was a full-fledged pop icon, having ditched Music Row for producers like Max Martin and Jack Antonoff, and tabloid fame. Along the way, there were feuds, squads and political discourses aplenty. Swift has encountered the type of controversies that would destroy most pop stars’ careers and acclaim. But at age 31, she has never been more awarded or acclaimed as a singer-songwriter. Meanwhile, her impact is felt in the success and style of younger singers/songwriters like Olivia Rodrigo, Conan Gray, Phoebe Bridgers and Clairo. This course proposes to deconstruct both the appeal and aversions to Taylor Swift through close readings of her music and public discourse as it relates to her own growth as an artist and a celebrity. Through readings, lectures and more, the class delves into analyses of the culture and politics of teen girlhood in pop music, fandom, media studies, whiteness and power as it relates to her image and the images of those who have both preceded and succeeded her. We’ll also consider topics like copyright and ownership, American nationalism and the ongoing impact of social media on the pop music industry.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1175 Topics in Recorded Music: Indigenous Pop Around the World (2 Credits)\n\nIn 2021, New Zealand pop star / singer-songwriter Lorde released a five-song EP of tracks from her Solar Power album, rerecorded in the indigenous Māori language. Five years prior, pop stars like Pharrell Williams, Dave Matthews, Radiohead, and Sia raised their voices at Standing Rock, North Dakota in support of the protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline—one of many increasing threats to the sovereignty of Indigenous Nations. Their celebrity presence was key to attracting mainstream media coverage. However, those artists were largely following the lead of Native hip-hoppers like Supaman, Snotty Nose Rez Kids, and Prolific, who’d already been at Standing Rock since the start of the protests, rallying their own communities. This course will engage students around the growing globalization of Indigenous Peoples movements that intersects culture, politics, and economics. These days, Indigenous musicians like Aboriginal Australian rapper Baker Boy and Canadian First Nations vocalist Jeremy Dutcher are gaining in visibility, topping critics’ year-end Best-Of lists and taking home awards. This “Creative Natives” wave is being felt far outside of music, too: Tzotzil fashion designer Alberto López Gomez from Chiapas, Mexico was featured in New York Fashion Week; Māori filmmaker Taika Waititi won an Oscar for JoJo Rabbit; influential art critics heralded White Mountain Apache music performance artist and film scorer Laura Ortman at the 2020 Whitney Biennial, and Seminole/Muscogee Creek showrunner Sterling Harjo’s Reservation Dogs is the new hit on FX/Hulu. Over the course of seven weeks, students will engage with a wide range of international Indigenous performers and music(s) they may have never heard before—from Māori metal to Saami yoik-rap, Quechua huanyo-pop, Inuit throatsinging, Maasai hip-hop, Hawaiian reggae, Tokelauan dance-pop, and even Tuareg rock. Meanwhile, they will discover how Indigenous artists have not only achieved national, even international, acclaim in popular mainstream music genres, they are increasingly “indigenizing” them with languages, instruments, and vocal techniques from their own cultural traditions. We will also look at some Indigenous stars who broke barriers to achieve mainstream fame as singular personalities and cultural ambassadors: artists like Yma Sumac, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Israel Kamakawiwo’ole, and more. And also, we’ll survey the impact of Indigenous artists and music on the both the mainstream recording industry, as well as the growth of Indigenous-directed business entities doing things on their own terms. Through readings, lectures, and class discussions, students will be introduced to important scholarship on Indigenous identity, (de-)colonization, cultural appropriation, aesthetics, and so on. Any student interested in socio-cultural movements, roots music trends, arts-centered activism, and the ways in which music introduces audiences to the messages within each of these—especially regarding themes like climate justice, human rights, social inclusion, and sovereignty issues—will benefit from taking this class. Students can also expect to leave the course with a greater awareness of, and hopefully appreciation for, the growing global presence and popularity of Indigenous sounds, voices, and views.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1176 Music and Spirituality Across the World (2 Credits)\n\nMusic is a spiritual practice. Music and spirituality are intricately related, with spirituality often being the inspiration for the creation of music, and music so often creating the desired atmosphere for a spiritual occasion. This course will explore the relationship between the two by investigating the role of spirituality in music and the role of music in spiritual practices around the world throughout history. All creators of art eventually must reconcile with the spiritual nature of living life as an artist. Whether they reject the notion entirely or look at their artistic practice as lifelong meditative practice – this course will help them find answers. By exploring the history of the relationship between spirituality and religion in music as well as the role of ritual, students will contextualize and articulate their own spiritual paths with a sense of confidence. Through weekly readings, listenings and creative assignments, students will explore all rhythmic, harmonic and melodic aspects, as well as the historic significance of sonic information as it relates to spirituality, mysticism and self-reflection. Basic understanding of and access to a Digital Audio Workstation (Garage Band, ProTools, Logic, Ableton etc) is a requirement as students will be given access to recorded music stems in order to create their own sonic collages within the given parameters of each genre. Students will complete a library of their own works throughout the semester to accompany their reflective writing on each musical style and the culture from which it comes.\n\nGrading: Ugrd Tisch Graded\n\nRepeatable for additional credit: No\n\nREMU-UT 1177 Topics in Recorded Music: What is \"Indie\" (2 Credits)\n\nIn today’s music industry, it has never been easier for DIY artists to self-produce, self-release and self-promote their own music. This has led to a golden age for so-called “independent artists” operating outside of traditional label structures. But as opportunities have emerged for independents, so has a whole industry of middlemen, services and self-appointed experts selling solutions for indie success in the streaming era, as well as mainstream co-optation of indie aesthetics. It all begs the enormous, difficult, hard-to-pin-down question: What is indie? What has"
