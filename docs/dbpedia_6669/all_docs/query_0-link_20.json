        "text": "MUS 101(F) LEC Listening to Music\n\nThe goals of this course are 1) to encourage active, critical, and comparative listening practices, and 2) to consider the functions of music as an embodied, social, and context-dependent phenomenon. We will encounter music from across history and the globe, engaging with examples from a wide range of musicians and musical traditions. Topics will include: political protest music, music in religious contexts, the relationship between music and text, performing gender in music, the meaning of authenticity in musical contexts, and the ethics of musical listening. Through a variety of specific case studies, we will seek to become discerning listeners while also thinking critically about music's capacities and limitations. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Sonja Wermager\n\nCatalog details\n\nMUS 102(F, S) LEC Introduction to Music Theory\n\nThe course presents an introduction to the materials and structures of music. Through a variety of applied and theoretical exercises and projects, students will develop an understanding of the elements of music (e.g. pitch, scales, triads, rhythm, meter, and their notation) and explore their combination and interaction in the larger-scale organization of works of classical, jazz and popular music (i.e. harmony, counterpoint, form, rhetoric). Practical musicianship skills will be developed through singing, keyboard, and rhythmic exercises in lecture, and through dictation and sight-singing exercises in a weekly aural-skills lab. [ more ]\n\nMUS 103(F) LEC Music Theory and Musicianship I\n\nStudents in MUS 103 study some materials, structures, and procedures of tonal music, with a particular emphasis on subjects like tertian harmony, voice leading, counterpoint, rhythm, and form. Baroque chorales will serve as a central resource for this study, as will musical examples from a variety of times and places. Through a combination of keyboard harmony exercises, sight singing, dictation, analysis of musical scores, written exercises, and emulation composition projects, students will develop an intellectual, aural, and embodied understanding of tonal music. MUS 103 is designed for potential music majors and for students with prior experience interacting with notated music. Students should consult the music department website for information about music theory placement. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Zachary Wadsworth\n\nCatalog details\n\nMUS 104(S) LEC Music Theory and Musicianship I\n\nMusic 104 continues and expands the study of tonal music begun in Music 103, focusing particularly on counterpoint, seventh and ninth chords, larger musical forms, and chromatic harmony. The study of these topics is reinforced by musical analysis, written exercises, and emulation composition projects, as well as by applied musicianship work that includes exercises in sight singing, dictation, and keyboard harmony. MUS 104 is designed for potential music majors and for students with prior experience interacting with notated music. Students should consult the music department website for information about music theory placement.

Students will be given an introduction to vocal technique and physiology through vocalises, repertoire, analysis, and studio class sessions. They will engage in group singing and solo presentation in a collaborative, master-class setting. They will also build knowledge of western music notation through basic music theory, score-reading, and sight-singing. Upon completion of the class, interested students will have established the foundational skills necessary to sing more confidently in both solo and ensemble environments. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Anna Lenti\n\nCatalog details\n\nMUS 110 SEM Electronic Music Genres, a Creative Approach\n\nLast offered Spring 2024\n\nIn this course, students will study the theoretical and practical fundamentals of audio technology, MIDI production, sound design, and interactive composition. Students are not required to have any background in Music Technology. We will start by covering the basics of Electronic Music but the class will move at a fast pace covering more advance subjects in a short period of time. We will go over concepts of Physics acoustic, MIDI (sequencing, etc), Sound editing, Digital Signal Processing Effects, Sound Synthesis, and Interactive electronic music composition using Ableton Live, Max4Live, as well as Max MSP for students to learn how to program their own virtual synthesizers and/ or algorithmic composition to create interactive music in real time. Electronic Music Composition is a central part of the class. Students can choose any aesthetic of their choice for the composition projects, since the the focus of the class is on teaching students the technological tools to create the music of their choice. Students will be encouraged to mix different styles of music creating fusion. [ more ]\n\nMUS 111 LEC Music in Global Circulation\n\nLast offered Fall 2023\n\nThis course introduces a variety of musical genres and practices from around the world, alongside a discussion of the processes and politics of their global circulation. Through learning about a combination of contemporary styles and longstanding musical traditions spanning a broad geographical range, students will develop a working knowledge of musical terms, concepts, and influential musicians. Beyond engaging with music's sound and structure, we will address its capacity to express personal and group identity, and its ability to both reflect and shape broader social ideas and circumstances. In particular, we will consider music's global circulation, and how its contents and meanings reflect those processes. Genres covered in the course vary intermittently but often include: \"throat singing\" genres in Tuva and Sardinia, Zimbabwean mbira and Chimurenga music, Argentine Tango, Ghanaian azonto and highlife, Balinese gamelan, and North Indian classical music. No prior musical training is required. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Corinna Campbell\n\nCatalog details\n\nMUS 112(S) LEC Musics of Asia\n\nThis course offers an introduction to the great diversity of Asian music. Our survey will span from East Asia (China, Korea, and Japan) to Southeast Asia (Thailand and Indonesia) to the Indian subcontinent, Central Asia (Tibet and Afghanistan), to the Middle East (Iran and the Arabian peninsula), and will end with the extension of Asian music across North Africa and into Eastern Europe. Within this broad survey, we will focus on selected and representative musical cultures and genres. In each section of the course, aspects of cultural context (including music's function in religious life and its relationship to the other arts), will be emphasized. While our focus will be on the traditional and classical musics of these cultures, we will also consider the current musical scene. Encounters with this music will include attendance at live performances when possible. [ more ]\n\nMUS 118 LEC Hearing Race in America, 1890-1955\n\nLast offered Spring 2022\n\nThe rise of Rock 'n' Roll in the mid-1950s has typically been viewed as a temporary confluence in American culture, suggesting possibilities for musical and racial integration even as various forms of appropriation and exclusion were perpetuated. This course will explore the earlier multiple musical streams that merged at this moment. We will start by engaging with contemporary and historical perspectives on race, adopting a radically interdisciplinary approach. Our focus will then be on several of the most prominent vernacular and commercial forms of American music during this period: ragtime, blues, early jazz, rhythm and blues, Tin Pan Alley, country and western, bluegrass, Tex-Mex/Tejano conjunto, \"Latin jazz,\" and Cajun/zydeco. Prior to the 1950s, these musical styles were segregated, at least in terms of production and marketing. How did racial assumptions and histories shape the creation, dissemination, and reception of this music? Can we hear the multiple ways in which race played out in American music in the first half of the twentieth century? [ more ]\n\nMUS 119(F) LEC Rock and Roll Revolutions, 1950-1999\n\nThis course will trace the history of rock music from the 1950s to the end of the 20th century, focusing on those musicians who revolutionized the genre in various periods. Such \"revolutions\" are discovered in the use of new sounds and musical forms, in the relationship between lyrics and musical setting, and in the conception of rock's role in society. Three objectives will underpin our studies: to develop listening skills with music that one often hears, but perhaps rarely listens to intently; to determine in what ways popular music can be interpreted as reflecting and shaping its cultural context, particularly in terms of race and gender; and to encounter the work of several of the more innovative musicians in the history of rock. [ more ]\n\nMUS 120 LEC Musics of Africa\n\nLast offered Fall 2023\n\nThis course introduces musical traditions spanning the geographical breadth of continental Africa. We will prioritize hands-on experience and musical practice, critical listening, and deep social and political contextualization as strategies of musical engagement. Following an introductory exploration of overarching aesthetic and social trends in African musical practice, the course will then focus on 3-4 geographically rooted case studies, allowing us to discuss how different musical practices and subcultures (featuring traditional, contemporary, and popular forms) interrelate in a musical soundscape. The geographical focus of the case studies may vary but previous case studies have included: Ghana, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Egypt, Mali and the Democratic Republic of Congo. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Corinna Campbell\n\nCatalog details\n\nMUS 125(F) SEM Music and Social Dance in Latin America\n\nThis course offers a full-spectrum introduction to a number of Latin American social dance forms, including samba, salsa, tango, and the Suriname Maroon genre, awasa. Through critical listening and viewing assignments, performance workshops, and readings from disciplines spanning ethnomusicology, anthropology, dance studies, Latin American studies and history, students will combine a technical understanding of the musical and choreographic features of these genres with a consideration of their broader contexts and social impact. Among the questions that will drive class discussions are: How do sound and movement interrelate? What aspects of gender, sexuality, class, race and ethnicity arise in the performance and consumption of Latin American genres of social dance? How do high political, economic, and personal stakes emerge through activities more commonly associated with play and leisure? This class is driven by academic inquiry into these various social dance practices; it does not prioritize gaining performance skills in the genres discussed. While there will be experiential components included throughout the course (for instance music or dance workshops), the majority of the class will be conducted in a discussion/seminar format. While the ability to read musical notation is helpful, it is not required. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Corinna Campbell\n\nCatalog details\n\nMUS 133(S) SEM Musics of the Spanish Colonial Empire, ca. 1500-1800\n\nWith territories around the globe from the Americas to the Philippines to portions of Western Europe, the Spanish colonial empire was, at its height, one of the largest and most expansive in history. This course explores the myriad ways in which Spanish colonial powers influenced, interacted with, and reacted to the musical cultures of the colonized and how indigenous and/or colonized peoples persisted in asserting their musical voices over the course of several centuries--from the time of the Spanish arrival in the Americas (as well as southern Italy and the East Indies) during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries to the empire's eventual decline in the nineteenth century. We will begin by defining the concepts of \"colonialism\" and \"imperialism\" in order to understand how such political and socio-economic power structures developed and attempted to exert control and influence over subjugated populations--and consequently over their music. From there, we will investigate some of the musical developments and repertories that resulted from these efforts through a series of modules on various territories colonized by Spain, including the Spanish territories of Naples/southern Italy, New Spain, and the Philippines. Coursework will include discussion-based and written responses to weekly readings and listening assignments and small group presentations on a Spanish colonized space not covered in one of the central course modules. The ability to read musical notation is not required. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Elizabeth Elmi\n\nCatalog details\n\nMUS 141 LEC Opera\n\nLast offered Fall 2023\n\nAn introduction to the history of opera, from the genre's birth c. 1600 to the present. At various points in its 400-year development, opera has been considered the highest synthesis of the arts, a vehicle for the social elite, or a form of popular entertainment. Opera's position in European cultural history will be a primary focus of our inquiry. We will also study the intriguing relationship between text and music, aspects of performance and production, and the artistic and social conventions of the operatic world. The multidimensional nature of opera invites a variety of analytical and critical perspectives, including those of music analysis, literary studies, feminist interpretations, and political and sociological approaches. Works to be considered include operas by Monteverdi, Lully, Charpentier, Handel, Gluck, Mozart, Rossini, Donizetti, Verdi, Wagner, Bizet, Puccini, Strauss, Berg, Britten, Glass, and Adams. [ more ]\n\nMUS 143 LEC The Symphony\n\nLast offered Fall 2022\n\nThis course traces the European symphonic tradition from the late eighteenth century through the mid-twentieth century, focusing on works by Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Berlioz, Liszt, Mendelssohn, Schumann, Brahms, Dvorak, Mahler, Strauss, and Shostakovich. We will examine developments in musical form and harmony, social contexts for listening, and contemporary aesthetic debates about the nature of genius, the idea of musical tradition, and the narrative capacity of instrumental music. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Benjamin Ory\n\nCatalog details\n\nMUS 146 LEC The Concerto: Dialogue and Discord\n\nLast offered Spring 2016\n\nThe concerto is the musical genre most akin to the novel, and like the novel, explores the individual's relationship to society. A musical protagonist--a solo instrumentalist or a group of individual players--engages the larger orchestral ensemble, and a story unfolds in a dramatic narrative told in sound. This course will trace the history of the concerto from its beginning in the Baroque period to today. We will explore the spirited exchanges of Bach's Brandenburg Concerti, the urbane conversations of Mozart's piano concerti, the impassioned struggles of the Brahms violin concerto, the ferocious arguments of the Shostakovitch cello concerto, the polyglot discussions of John Adam's clarinet concerto, and many more. Along the way we will also investigate transformations in patronage and performance contexts, the cult of the virtuoso, and aspects of musical form and style. Students will experience the excitement of hearing concerti performed on campus by the Berkshire Symphony and student winners of the Department of Music's Concerto Competition. [ more ]\n\nMUS 149(F) LEC The Language of Film Music\n\nFilmmakers have relied on music from the earliest days of silent movies (often accompanied by live musical performance) to our present age of slickly-produced online video. Along the way, trends have arisen (and have been artfully thwarted) in countless film scores, whether constructed from preexisting works or specially crafted by composers like Max Steiner, Duke Ellington, Bernard Herrmann, John Williams, James Horner, Mica Levi, or Björk. In this class, we will look at and listen to films from different times and places, observing which techniques evolved, which have changed very little, and considering when an idea is borrowed and when it might actually be new. We will also discuss the impact this language has on the experience of the viewer, and how film music functions in the wider culture. Assignments will consist of listening/viewing, responding in writing, and re-interpreting film clips with music you will compose or borrow. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Zachary Wadsworth\n\nCatalog details\n\nMUS 150 LEC The Broadway Musical\n\nLast offered Spring 2024\n\nNamed for a specific road but enjoying a global impact, the Broadway musical has intersected with multiple styles and societal concerns over the past century. In this course, we explore the American musical theater's roots and relationship to opera, operetta, vaudeville, minstrelsy, and Tin Pan Alley. Traveling through the genre's history, we will encounter a wide range of musical styles, including ragtime, jazz, rock, and hip hop, and will explore several genre transformations, such as movies made into musicals and musicals into movies. We will develop a range of analytical skills as we investigate connections between choreography, lyrics, music, staging, and production. Throughout the semester, we will consider the genre's representations and reflections of ethnicity, race, sexuality, and class. The syllabus includes representative works by Gilbert and Sullivan, Cohan, Gershwin, Kern, Weill, Rodgers and Hammerstein, Lerner and Loewe, Bernstein, Sondheim, Lloyd Webber, Tesori, and Miranda, with particular focus on such works as Showboat, Oklahoma!, Guys and Dolls, West Side Story, Hair, Rent, and Hamilton. [ more ]\n\nMUS 151(S) LEC History of Jazz\n\n\"There are only three things that America will be remembered for 200 years from now when they study the civilization: The Constitution, Jazz Music and Baseball. These are the three most beautiful things this culture's ever created.\"--(Gerald Early) Jazz is the most common name for a great African American Art form that still defies definition. Over the past century this elastic tradition has laid down firm roots for numerous other American and World musics, while itself in the throes of a seemingly permanent identity crisis. Jazz is perennially declared dead or dying yet consistently summoned by advertisers to lend vitality and sex appeal to liquor or automobiles. By any name and regardless of its health status, jazz has a rich history of conservative innovators, at once restless and reverent, who made fascinating leaps of creativity out of inspiration or necessity. This \"listening intensive\" class will look at the past century of jazz music through ideas, \"what-if\" questions and movements that changed the way the music was created, presented and perceived. Both musical concepts (such as syncopation and cross instrumental-influence) and cultural connections (racial, technological and economic) will be examined, giving us freedom to link similar kinds of musical thought across disparate settings and decades. Our inquiry will include (but not be limited to) the lives and music of Louis Armstrong, Fletcher Henderson, Mary Lou Williams, Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Dizzy Gillespie, Art Blakey, John Lewis, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and Wayne Shorter. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Kris Allen\n\nCatalog details\n\nMUS 165 LEC Mozart\n\nLast offered Fall 2023\n\nThis course will examine the extraordinary life and musical genius of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Through lectures, discussion, readings, and guided listening, students will gain appreciation of Mozart's classical compositional style and familiarity with many of his greatest works. Among the topics we will explore are Mozart's pivotal position as a musician in Viennese society; his childlike nature and exquisite artistry; his relationship with his domineering father Leopold; his ties to Haydn and Beethoven; and the myths about Mozart, including that he was murdered by Salieri, that arose in the over two centuries since his death. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Marjorie Hirsch\n\nCatalog details\n\nMUS 166 LEC Beethoven\n\nLast offered Spring 2022\n\nThis course provides an introduction to the life and music of Ludwig van Beethoven. The composer's difficult childhood, loss of hearing, secret affair with his \"Immortal Beloved,\" tempestuous relationship with his suicidal nephew, along with political, philosophical, social, and cultural developments of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, will provide context for our study of his artistic achievements. Students will listen to a broad selection of Beethoven's music, including sonatas, string quartets, symphonies, overtures, concertos, choral works, and opera. Some of the topics we will discuss include the nature of his genius, his compositional methods, his influence on later composers such as Schubert, Wagner, and Brahms, Beethoven in popular culture, and the continuing impact of his music around the globe. [ more ]\n\nMUS 172 SEM Early Modern Music and Spectacle\n\nLast offered Fall 2023\n\nNuns, shepherds, demi-gods, tyrants, warriors, angels, and saints. No matter what story you tell, spectacle is never just spectacle. Whether in an opera, a pageant, or a comic play, the costumes, stage machinery, and visual effects are deeply encoded with political, religious, and cultural meanings. In this course, we will explore how music and spectacle worked together to create complex layers of meaning in various cultural contexts throughout the late medieval and early modern world (ca. 1400-1750). In doing so, we will consider how the magnificent representations of aristocratic, imperial, and colonial power central to such dramatic performances reveal wider cultural issues of gender, race, and religion. The course structure will follow a series of thematic modules, each addressing several case studies, on topics such as colonial power, women and madness, religious fervor, political propaganda, and patronage. Each week, students will take an active role in analyzing, discussing, and presenting on these topics and their related case studies both in and outside of class. For the final project, students will work in groups to develop fictional podcast interviews between historical spectators of an early modern musical-dramatic performance of their choosing. The ability to read musical notation is not required [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Elizabeth Elmi\n\nCatalog details\n\nMUS 173(S) LEC Music, Medicine, and Madness\n\nThis class will explore intersections between medicine and music in Europe and the United States between 1750 and 1900, with particular attention to constructions of \"madness\" as a condition that could be triggered, treated, or expressed by music. Through focused readings, analysis of musical examples, and discussion, we will examine historical discourses concerning music's ability to influence the mind and body--and through this examination gain perspective on current discussions of both mental and physical health. Topics will include the \"mad scene\" trope in 19th-century opera, the idea of the suffering genius composer, the history of music as medical treatment, and how factors like race, gender, and ability shaped understandings of musical achievement and medical diagnosis. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Sonja Wermager\n\nCatalog details\n\nMUS 176(F) LEC Protest Song\n\nWhat's in a song? And how might it connect to our disparate cultures, politics, and identities? Throughout history, the genre of song has been a compelling mode of self-expression. It encodes specific elements of identity, emotion, history, and culture by combining the power of lyric poetry with that of the human voice. It is no wonder, then, that it has also functioned as a primary vehicle for expressions of political resistance, protest, and dissent within a range of socio-cultural movements around the world. In this course, we will consider the fundamental question of what makes a song a protest song. We will begin by defining key ideas of resistance and protest within music more broadly. We will then go on to consider what kinds of socio-political meaning can be encoded within a song through its lyrics, musical composition, and performance style. To that end, the class will spend the semester investigating a series of case studies from around the world in historical context, including examples from southern Italy, Mexico, South Korea, Egypt, Ireland, South Africa, and the United States. Examples will include songs by well-known figures such as Big Mama Thornton, Janis Joplin, Kendrick Lamar, Bob Dylan, Umm Kulthum, and Roberto Murolo, as well as anonymous examples from traditions like the Mexican son jarocho, African American spiritual, Irish rebel song, classic Neapolitan song, and South Korean protest song. In addition to weekly reading and listening assignments, students will spend the semester creating curated playlists of songs associated with socio-cultural movements of political protest, resistance, and/or dissent to be presented and discussed during the final week of class. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Elizabeth Elmi\n\nCatalog details\n\nMUS 177 SEM Gender and Sexuality in Music\n\nLast offered Spring 2024\n\nThis course explores key themes in the expression of gender and sexuality through music. It draws from primarily 21st century examples, across cultures and genres, ranging from pop boy bands to Indian bhangra dance to the musical avant-garde. Themes will include: communicating gendered ideals, dance and embodiment, transgressive performances, biography and subjectivity, intersectionality, music and sexual violence, and marketing. We will explore the ways that ideas and identities related to sex and gender are formulated and mobilized in music's performance and consumption. Inevitably, issues of sound and stagecraft intersect with factors such as race, age, and class, further informing these experiences. Students will consider their own processes of identifying and interpreting expressions of gender and sexuality in sound and movement, and contemplate the role of culture and society in informing those interpretations. [ more ]\n\nTaught by: Corinna Campbell\n\nCatalog details\n\nMUS 178 TUT Music and Politics\n\nLast offered Fall 2016\n\nThis course examines how musical sound and musical discourse change, enable, and inhibit citizen formation and the functioning of a well-ordered society. We will take a very wide definition of \"politics,\" as music can have political meaning and effects far beyond national anthems and propaganda. For instance, musical sound is often read as a metaphor for political structures: eighteenth-century commenters pointed out that string quartets mirrored reasoned, democratic discourse, and twentieth-century critics made similar arguments about free jazz. Beliefs about music can serve as a barometer for a society's non-musical anxieties: Viennese fin-de-siècle critics worried that the sounds and stories of Strauss's operas were causing moral decline, an argument that should be familiar to anyone who reads criticism of American popular music. Finally, a pervasive strand of Romantic thought holds that (good) music, by its nature, is apolitical-what might it mean to deny social relevance to an entire field of human expression? We will read classic philosophical texts on art and politics by Schiller, Kant, Schopenhauer, Marx, Adorno, and others, and pair them with contextual studies of works of Western classical music from the last two hundred years and popular music of the last hundred years. [ more ]\n\nMUS 179(S) TUT James Baldwin's Song\n\n\"It is only in his music [. . .] that the Negro in America has been able to tell his story. It is a story which otherwise has yet to be told and which no American is prepared to hear,\" wrote James Baldwin in Notes of a Native Son in 1955. In this course, we strive to listen more closely to racialized experience through James Baldwin's musical literature. Through analysis and creation of music, we hope to better understand cultural difference and collective humanity. In this course, we closely analyze James Baldwin's use of song names, creation of musician characters, and replication of musical elements in his writing. Baldwin's musical word play crosses historical and genre boundaries. So we will explore texts from his early to late career, such as the gospel music of his youth in the semi-autobiographical novel Go Tell It on the Mountain, the metaphor of the blues in the play written during the civil-rights movement Blues for Mr. Charlie, the jazz musician protagonist in \"Sonny's Blues\" written after World War II in Paris, and his only musical recording in A Lover's Question set down near the end of his life. In addition to closely analyzing James Baldwin's attention to music throughout his literature, students will learn basic music writing and production skills. The tutorial will draw on a range of musical resources, including playlists, music workshops, guest lectures and performances. All of these resources will guide students to a more attuned hearing not only of music but also of the African American experience it reflects. By the end of the course, students will have written several short 1-2 page close analysis essays and song lyrics. For their final project, students will produce an original song based on key insights from the course. No musical experience is required, though an openness to learn and practice songwriting is expected.

Students will develop an understanding of the basic principles of design and the process necessary for developing an approach to directing a production. They will explore the work of stage directors whose output has been particularly influential and learn about a variety of approaches to process and rehearsal technique. Repertoire studied will include a range of opera and musical theatre from the beginning of the form to its current trends and a broad variety of directorial approaches from traditional to concept productions. Students will complete the process of developing a concept/approach for a production with a title of their choosing. [ more ]\n\nMUS 201(F) LEC Music Theory and Musicianship II\n\nMusic 201 continues to greater degrees the study of music techniques from the common practice period by means of analysis, composition, written exercises, sightsinging, and dictation. We will expand our understanding of chromaticism. We will learn how chromaticism is used as a voice-leading tool, and how it participates in music even at deeper levels of the structure. We will learn about innovations that occurred from the19th century through the beginning of the 20th century and will trace the origins for these new harmonic tendencies. We will also learn how composers create larger formal structures. [ more ]\n\nMUS 202(S) LEC Music Theory and Musicianship II\n\nMusic 202 examines the materials and structures of atonal and post-tonal music from the 20th and 21st centuries, and it develops musicianship skills to aid in the perception and performance of these materials and structures. Topics include set theory, serial techniques, referential collections, post-tonal pitch centricity, new rhythmic and metric techniques, new formal structures, and the intersection of tonal and contextual structure.

Topics include acoustics, MIDI sequencing, digital recording and editing, sampling, analog and digital synthesis, digital signal processing, and instrument design. Lectures will provide technical explanations on those topics covered in class and an historical overview of electronic music. [ more ]\n\nMUS 211(F) SEM Music, Nationalism, and Popular Culture\n\nThis course surveys the manner, function, and contexts through which sound and ideas of national belonging are linked. We will consider influential and iconic musicians (e.g. Umm Kalthoum, Amalia Rodriguez, Bob Marley, Carlos Gardel), international forums for the expression of national sentiment (the Olympics, World Cup, and Eurovision competitions), and a wide range of instruments, genres, and anthems that are strong conduits for national sentiment. Drawing on the work of critical theorists including Benedict Anderson, Michael Herzfeld, and Homi K. Bhabha, we will pursue a number of analytical questions: What parallels exist between musical and political structure? How do nations adjust as their policies and demographics change? How are cultural forms implicated in postcolonial nation building projects? What marginal populations or expressive forms are included, excluded, or appropriated in the formation of national identity? Finally, what differences emerge as we change our focus from a national to an international perspective, or from officially endorsed representations of national culture to unofficial popular forms of entertainment?

This is especially audible in the modern era, when new technologies and institutions began to record, amplify, and broadcast the region's sounds, preserving centuries-old traditions while also producing new forms of popular music. This course introduces students to Arab musical genres and practices as they developed from the late nineteenth century. We will cover a broad geographical range, exploring the classical Andalusian repertoires of Algeria, ecstatic dervish chants in Egypt, patriotic pop tunes from Lebanon, and other topics. To highlight connections between musical traditions as well as their unique local features, we will ask questions such as: What can music tell us about interactions between sacred and secular life? How is music used to define social groups and negotiate identity, gender, and class? Which musical characteristics are associated with Arab \"heritage\" and \"modernity,\" and how are these performed? In what ways does music shape everyday life in the Arab world? Class sessions and discussion will be based on academic readings and at-home listening assignments. No previous knowledge of Arabic or Arab music are required. [ more ]\n\nMUS 217(S) SEM Hip Hop Culture\n\nThe course examines how young people of color created hip hop culture in the postindustrial ruins of New York City, a movement that would eventually grow into a global cultural industry. Hip hop music producers have long practiced \"diggin' in the crates\"--a phrase that denotes searching through record collections to find material to sample. In this course, we will examine the material and technological history of hip hop culture, with particular attention to hip hop's tendency to sample, remix, mash-up, and repurpose existing media artifacts to create new works or art. We will use a media archaeological approach to examine the precise material conditions that first gave rise to graffiti art, deejaying, rapping, and breakdancing, and to analyze hip hop songs, videos, and films. Media archaeology is a critical and artistic practice that seeks to interpret the layers of significance embedded in cultural artifacts. How does hip hop archaeology remix the past, the present, and the future? How do the historical, political, and cultural coding of hip hop artifacts change as they increasingly become part of institutional collections, from newly established hip hop archives at Cornell and Harvard to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture?

Lamban was created by the Djeli, popularly called Griots served many roles in the kingdoms of Ghana and Old Mali from the 12th century to current times. This dance and music form continues as folklore in modern day Guinea, Senegal, Mali and The Gambia where it is practiced by the Mandinka people. Bira is an ancient and contemporary spiritual practice of Zimbabwe's Shona people. While these forms are enduring cultural practices, Kpanlogo from the modern West African state of Ghana represents the post-colonial identity of this nation's youth and their aspirations for independence at the end of the 1950s. We will also consider the introduction of these forms outside of their origin. This course can be taken for academic and/or PE credit. [ more ]\n\nMUS 221(S) STU African Dance and Percussion\n\nBefore the 20th century, the African continent was the source of dance and music that influenced new forms rooted on and off the continent. These forms are shaped by the impact of religion, colonialism, national political movements, travel, immigration, and the continuing emergence of technology. In South Africa, the labor conditions of miners instigated the creation of Isicathulo, Gum boots, and in Brazil the history of colonialism is a factor that anchors Samba as a sustaining cultural and socioeconomic force. The birth of Hip Hop in the 20th century finds populations across the globe using its music, dance, lyrics, and swagger as a vehicle for individual and group voice. Hip Hop thrives as a cultural presence in most countries of the African continent and in the Americas. We will examine the factors that moved this form from the Bronx, New York, to Johannesburg, South Africa, and Rio, Brazil. We will examine at least two of these forms learning dance and music technique and composition material that will inform their practice. Each of these genres generated physical practices, new and enduring communities while continuing to embody specific histories that have moved beyond their place of origin. What is their status in this century? [ more ]\n\nMUS 222 SEM Politics of Performance/Performing Politics in Contemporary Africa\n\nLast offered Fall 2019\n\nUsing select examples from throughout Africa, this course highlights genres, artists, and works that engage with social and ideological change. Students practice critical listening and performance analysis, while also considering the social contexts that render these performances meaningful and provocative. Topics include: challenges to mass mediated stereotypes of African populations, the social and economic impact of cultural tourism, music as a form of social critique, changing attitudes toward women and the LGBTQIA community, music and global aid organizations, issues of migration and displacement, and the changing roles of traditional musical occupations. Popular genres-among them Afrobeat, kwaito, soukous, raï, mbalax, Chimurenga music, and a variety of rap and hip-hop styles-are discussed alongside numerous traditional and ceremonial genres, national/political anthems, and concert pieces. Active participation in class discussion is an important component of this course.

This course serves as an introduction to a wide spectrum of Caribbean music in its broader social and historical context. Through engaging with audio and video sources, readings, performance exercises and workshops, students will learn to identify distinguishing features associated with particular countries and regions, while also exploring the sounds and musical structures that are shared between them. Featured genres include reggae, steel pan, calypso, zouk, Maroon music from Suriname and Jamaica, chutney, salsa, merengue and music from Haitian Vodu and Cuban Santería religions. Interlaced with discussion of musical genres and innovative musicians are a number of central questions about the social role of music within the region: How has slavery and colonial enterprise shaped the musical landscape of the Caribbean? How do the realms of sacred and secular performance relate to each other? What role does tourism and global circulation play in influencing musical tastes and practices? Finally, how do music and dance interconnect? [ more ]\n\nMUS 230 LEC Musical Ethnography\n\nLast offered Spring 2016\n\nMusic provides a constant accompaniment to most of our lives, from mundane activities to personal or collective moments of celebration and grief. Often, we experience music's impact on us without fully considering how it shapes our ideas and experiences. Drawing on ethnomusicology, anthropology, and related fields, this course explores how music can illuminate people's practices of being-in-the-world. Musical ethnography describes both the means by which scholars pursue this line of questioning, and also the written work that results from such an investigation. This course features a hands-on approach to musical ethnography. Students will each conduct ethnographic fieldwork in a musical community within Williamstown and the surrounding area. Coursework will survey approaches to methodology (modes and degrees of researcher involvement, practical skills related to documentation), issues of ethics, and social and musical analysis. [ more ]\n\nMUS 231(F) LEC Music in History I: Music and Culture from Antiquity to 1750\n\nThis course explores over 1500 years of music-making in (and around) Europe and the Americas from antiquity to 1750 through an investigation of significant musical styles, forms, and theories in cultural and historical context. Our primary inquiry will be to consider how and why these musical styles and forms were created and circulated--through both oral performance and the written medium--by considering the major historical, cultural, technological, and aesthetic issues surrounding them. We will further contextualize these developments within a deeper consideration of the political, religious, racial, and gender-based interactions and divisions throughout history. In doing so, the course introduces the modern study of music history, sampling a broad range of recent scholarship reflecting an array of critical approaches to the study of early music in our own day. Weekly coursework will include readings on music historical topics, as well as listening and score analysis of key repertory in modern transcription. Assessments will take place throughout the semester through listening/score quizzes, exams, primary source presentations, and a research-based essay project focused on repertories and practices outside of the traditional musical canon.

Through listening, reading, and score analysis, we will study a broad range of composers and genres, Classical and Romantic aesthetics, and connections between music and political, philosophical, social, and cultural developments of the period. Composers include Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Robert Schumann, Clara Schumann, Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel, Berlioz, Chopin, Liszt, Verdi, Wagner, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Mahler, and others. Some of the topics we will discuss include the changing role of composers in society, music's relationship to the other arts, challenges faced by female composers, controversies surrounding music and meaning, the interaction of music and drama in opera, and musical nationalism.

Encounters with this music often challenge our ears and musical minds and require us to reconsider fundamental conceptions of music itself. Throughout the course, we will pursue a contextual approach and will investigate this music in relation to contemporary developments in the other arts, to popular musical styles, and to global intersections. We will carefully consider the ways in which evolving conceptions of race, ethnicity, and gender shaped this music history. Topics and styles will include: modernism (atonal expressionism, twelve-tone techniques, neoclassicism); new technologies (electronic, multimedia, digital); the impact of jazz at home and abroad; American experimentalism; postmodernism (minimalism, neoromanticism); nationalism (Eastern European, Latin American, East Asian); and the impact of geopolitics on musical composition (totalitarianism; World War II; Cold War). [ more ]\n\nMUS 234 LEC Soundscapes of Renaissance Europe\n\nLast offered Fall 2022\n\nWhat was the sonic experience of living in late-medieval and early-modern Europe? This course will explore the sights and sounds of daily life for cultural elites as well as the average urban resident. Although it is often vocal polyphony that first comes to mind when thinking about Renaissance music, acoustic environments were complex, noisy, and diverse. This course aims to reflect that heterogeneity: topics include bells, processions, music and architecture, instrumental music, plainchant, visual depictions of music-making, and uses of music to project power, as well as sacred and secular vocal polyphony. Students will zoom in on cities, courts, and churches, especially the musical centers of Bruges, Florence, Ferrara, the Imperial Court of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, and Bavaria. The course will examine music by some of the most important composers of the era, including Guillaume Du Fay, Josquin des Prez, Philippe Verdelot, Nicolas Gombert, and Orlando di Lasso.

From economic expansions to developing trade routes and from violent religious crusades to flourishing universities, cities, and courts, opportunities for cultural investment and exchange among regions in Western Europe, North Africa, and Central and East Asia were plentiful, if not always peaceful. In this seminar, we will consider how a global historical perspective shifts our understanding of music in the Middle Ages from one based on hegemonic European progress in isolation to one that reveals a multitude of influences, interactions, and interconnections among people of various cultures, races, and religions both within and outside of the European continent. In this tutorial, we will investigate a series of case studies in order to address how and where these global interconnections took place and what musical practices flourished as a result. We will give special consideration to the following topics: orality and literacy, race and difference, the politics of religion, economic power, and manuscript culture. In grappling with these topics, students will engage in weekly readings on musical and broader historical topics, listening and score analysis of key repertory in modern transcription, and study of original notation through manuscript facsimiles.

Seeking either to realize Wagner's \"total work of art\" in the theater, or to uncover the more general correspondences celebrated by Baudelaire, modernists consistently looked beyond their own media. Collaborations on works of \"total theater\" were common: Satie, Cocteau, Massine, Picasso; Brecht, Hindemith, Weill; Stravinsky, Nijinsky, Bakst; Claudel, Honegger, Rubinstein. Modernists explored new connections between music and color (Scriabin, Kandinsky), music and literature (Joyce, Mann), and music and dance (Duncan, Graham). Occasionally, modernists attempted to unite the arts on their own: Schoenberg painted, Pound composed, and Kokoschka wrote. Our focus will be on those works of music, art, dance, and literature that explored new relationships between the arts. One goal will be to investigate whether specific equivalents exist between techniques of modernist painting, poetics, choreography, and composition. Aware of the risks and rewards of interdisciplinary study, we will attempt our own theories of artistic synthesis. This course is designed to bring multiple perspectives to the study of music in modernism. [ more ]\n\nMUS 239 LEC Music in the Global Cold War\n\nLast offered Spring 2024\n\nThroughout the Cold War (1947-1991), music was deployed as a weapon, as a source of nationalist and ideological inspiration, as a form of political protest and resistance, and as propaganda. Music both echoed and helped shape political views and, therefore, prompted various forms of regulation and censorship (McCarthyism in the U.S.; the Union of Soviet Composers). To counter Soviet claims of American cultural inferiority and racism, the U.S. sponsored numerous musical diplomacy efforts showcasing both jazz (Armstrong; Ellington; Brubeck) and classical musicians and composers (Bernstein; American orchestras). Cold War politics and the threat of nuclear war influenced musical styles (Copland; Soviet Socialist Realism; the popular American folk music revival; serialism; rock behind the Iron Curtain), specific musical events (Tokyo East West Music Encounter; concerts celebrating the fall of the Berlin Wall), and individual careers (Shostakovich; Robeson; Van Cliburn). To investigate music's political roles and capacity for expressing communist and democratic capitalist ideologies, we will adopt a case study approach. The Cold War was a global political and, frequently, militaristic struggle. Though our focus will be on music in the U.S.S.R. and U.S.A., we will also consider musical developments impacted by the Cold War throughout Western and Eastern Europe, in Latin America, and in East Asia. [ more ]\n\nMUS 241(F) LEC German Romantic Song\n\nAn emblem of Romanticism. A mainstay of recitals. A public performance of interior feeling. Why is it that the Lied, a short song for piano and solo voice, remains such an enduring musical genre? This course explores this question by focusing on the key repertoire and the history of German Romantic Lieder. We will begin by studying some of the most influential composers of German Lieder during the nineteenth century (including Franz Schubert, Clara and Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms, Hugo Wolf, and Gustav Mahler), analyzing how these composers experimented with the interplay of music and text. We will also examine the social contexts in which Lieder were composed and performed, with particular attention to factors like gender and class. Finally, we will explore varied approaches to Lieder in contemporary performance culture in order to consider what the genre means for performers and audiences today.

Arguably the most historically important musician in American and modern world history, Armstrong is widely credited as being responsible for popularizing the concept of the jazz \"solo,\" as well as marrying the materials and performance traditions of the Blues and American popular song, and forever changing the aesthetic of vocal performance across a wide swath of Black American genres. By virtue of being so studied and imitated, his personal musical vocabulary as a trumpeter and vocalist can be seen to have informed all jazz music that followed in his wake, from stride piano and early big band arrangements to Parker, Davis, Coltrane etc. More than any other individual, his rhythmic language exemplifies the popular but definition-resistant language of \"Swing.\" This listening and performance intensive seminar will be an opportunity for committed students of jazz music to absorb this language in a focused way. Seminar meetings are anchored by weekly transcription projects sung and played individually and collectively, informed by occasional lectures and readings from biographical, but also and especially Armstrong's own voluminous autobiographical writings. We will focus in particular on the \"Rosetta Stone\" of jazz recordings, the Hot Fives and Hot Sevens sessions of 1925-29, and in so doing also study the work of selected Armstrong collaborators of the period including Earl Hines, Johnny Dodds, Lil Hardin Armstrong and Kid Ory. We will also cover earlier periods of his career, with ensembles led by King Oliver and Fletcher Henderson, and study the work of other significant early jazz soloists who performed with and mutually evidenced influence on/by Armstrong including Sidney Bechet, Bessie Smith, Fats Waller, and Coleman Hawkins.

The course traces the evolution of Coltrane's compositional and performance styles in the context of the musical and cultural environment in which they developed. Emphasis placed on Coltrane's musical style, representing a unique synthesis of influences, including jazz, world, and European Classical music and spirituality. Substantial listening and reading assignments, including a biography and related criticism, as well as detailed score analysis and study, are required.

The practitioners of this new sub-genre were seen not as showmen or entertainers, but (in the words of poet Ralph Ellison) as \"frozen faced introverts, dedicated to chaos.\" This music was simultaneously old and new, a musical evolution interpreted through the lens of cultural revolution. This class will survey the lives, music and continuing impact of bebop's most pivotal figures: Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Dizzy Gillespie, Bud Powell and Kenny Clarke among many others. Through score study, guided listening and performance, the class will examine the melodic, harmonic and rhythmic innovations associated with this pivotal era in jazz history. We will evaluate, compare and contrast examples of contemporary theoretical scholarship concerning this musical vocabulary and it's evolution. Intersections between the music and parallel artistic, social and political movements will also be addressed.

Without the help of words, this largely non-referential art presents special challenges to interpretation. While most would agree that musical sounds can do such things as mimic the rumbling of thunder, evoke the countryside, suggest the act of chasing, or express rage, the capacity of music to convey meaning remains controversial among scholars, performers, and listeners. Some, following music critic Eduard Hanslick, assert that musical works are essentially \"tonally moving forms\"--patterns of sound with no reference to the world outside themselves; a work's meaning derives solely from the interplay of musical elements. Others counter that music can signify aspects of human experience, its sounds and structures not merely referring to the outside world but even relating complex narratives. Certain writers have argued that, without the assistance of language, what music signifies remains vague, while others insist that the meaning of music is actually more precise than that of words. In this tutorial course, we will explore a range of questions regarding musical meaning. How can combinations of pitches, rhythms, and instrumental timbres signify something beyond themselves? Is the subject of musical meaning more relevant to some historical styles or genres than others? How can we determine the meaning(s) of a work? Should we concentrate on formal processes within the music? Consider socially constructed meanings? Seek the composer's intentions? Emphasize our personal responses? What makes some interpretations more convincing than others? In grappling with these questions, students will engage with writings by Agawu, Cone, Hanslick, Kramer, Langer, Lewin, Newcomb, and Schopenhauer, among others. Music to be studied includes works by Beethoven, Schubert, Chopin, Brahms, Mahler, Tchaikovsky, Ravel, Stravinsky, Glass, and Adams. [ more ]\n\nMUS 273 TUT Dangerous Music\n\nLast offered Fall 2021\n\nAs a largely non-referential art whose meanings are far from transparent, music might seem to pose little danger. How could mere sounds represent a threat? Yet precisely because its meanings can be obscure, enabling it to achieve its ends surreptitiously, music has intertwined with danger throughout history. With its power to stir the emotions, stimulate bodily movement, encode messages, and foment rebellion, music has often been perceived as an agent of harm. Plato claimed that too much music could make a man effeminate or neurotic, and warned that certain musical modes, melodies, and rhythms promote licentious behavior and anarchic societies. Puritans, Victorians, and totalitarians, as well as opponents of ragtime, rock 'n roll, and rap, have also accused certain musical genres or styles of exerting dangerous influences, and sought to limit or suppress them. In Afghanistan, the Taliban banned music altogether. While music has often been unfairly accused, its potential for placing people in actual danger is undeniable. Works that are played at ear-splitting decibel levels, that call upon performers to injure themselves, that are used as a form of psychological torture, or that incite violence demand reconsideration of the widely shared view that music is fundamentally a form of entertainment. [ more ]\n\nMUS 276 LEC Music and the Internet\n\nLast offered Fall 2017\n\nSince the release of Napster in 1999, the Internet's relationship with music has been sometimes elevating and sometimes adversarial. While it has granted listeners access to broad music libraries and musicians access to large audiences, the Internet has also exposed listeners to legal action, taxed artists with dwindling royalties, and disrupted and reshaped the recording and publishing industries. This course examines how the Internet has affected music at every level, from its creation to its distribution and consumption. Topics will include music written for online spaces, musical performances that take place online, music and online gaming, live music that refers to the Internet, the financial and philosophical background of music file formats, changing notions of musical ownership, censorship of music online, music's place in memes, and the user experience in (and attitudes toward music projected by) services like iTunes, YouTube, Spotify, and musically. [ more ]\n\nMUS 279 TUT American Pop Orientalism\n\nLast offered Fall 2020\n\nThis tutorial will investigate the representation of Asians and Asian Americans in American popular culture since the late nineteenth century. Our focus will be on music's role in Orientalist representation in a wide variety of media and genres, including Hollywood film, television, popular song, music videos, Broadway musicals, hip hop, and novels. We will begin with major texts in cultural theory (Said, Bhabha) and will attempt throughout the semester to revise and refine their tenets. Can American Orientalism be distinguished in any fundamental way from nineteenth-century European imperialist thought? How does Orientalist representation calibrate when the \"exotic others\" being represented are themselves Americans? Our own critical thought will be sharpened through analysis and interpretation of specific works, such as Madame Butterfly, \"Chinatown, My Chinatown,\" Sayonara, Flower Drum Song, Miss Saigon, Rising Sun, M. Butterfly, Aladdin, and Weezer's Pinkerton. We will end the semester by considering the current state of Orientalism in American popular culture. [ more ]\n\nMUS 280 TUT Dancing the Score/Scoring the Dance\n\nLast offered Spring 2019\n\nThis course is designed for students interested in intensive collaborative composition work in dance and music. Students in dance will be paired with students in music; both students will be supported in creating in collaboration by practicing composition in their respective disciplines while working closely with each other in a structured, intimate setting. Any genre or style of music or dance may be explored. Projects will allow students to practice methodologies of collaboration and creation. Groups will evolve, and document procedures unique to their group. Students are expected to rigorously build upon and revise their work(s) by making active use of feedback sessions. Studying historic and contemporary dance and music collaborations in a variety of genres will give further context to our work. Weekly presentation of assignments, active participation in feedback sessions, identifying to the group what the next steps are, written reflection on sessions, and final showing will be required. Creating in collaboration trains students to articulate vision and intention while enabling the instructors to differentiate their aesthetic values from those of the students. It also trains students to collaborate with other disciplines during the creative process. The format allows class members to receive undivided focus on their processes, while also challenging them to assess their own abilities, create their own next steps, and discover how movement can inspire music as well as music inspiring dance. This tutorial provides a crucial central aspect of the creative arts: a space for ongoing feedback driven by the questions arising for the students, rather than specific aesthetic preferences or working practices. Investment in the work of one's group is central, sharing responsibility for the development of others' as well as one's own work.

Counterpoint was taught by Mozart, studied by Beethoven, and to this day remains an integral part of compositional training. The course will introduce students to species counterpoint in two and three voices--exercises that develop discipline in polyphonic writing, hearing, and thinking. The exercises will focus on the constraints of sixteenth-century vocal polyphony (music of Palestrina and Lassus) but will illustrate how such contrapuntal discipline is also manifest in music of Corelli, Bach, Brahms and Debussy.

This course embraces all three definitions and the full diversity of Asian American musical experience. We will study the historical soundscapes of immigrant communities (Chinese opera in North America; Southeast Asian war refugees) and how specific traumatic political events shaped musical life (Japanese American internment camps). We will encounter works by major classical composers (Chou Wen-Chung; Chen Yi; Tan Dun; Bright Sheng) and will investigate the careers and reception of prominent classical musicians (Midori; Seiji Ozawa; Yo-Yo Ma). Afro-Asian fusions, inspired by civil rights protest movements, manifested in jazz (Jon Jang; Fred Ho; Anthony Brown; Hiroshima; Vijay Iyer) and hip hop (MC Jin; Awkwafina; Desi rappers). Asian Americans have been active in popular music at home and abroad (Don Ho; Yoko Ono; Wang Leehom; Mitski). Finally, we will investigate communal forms of Asian American music making that have crossed racialized and gendered boundaries (taiko drumming; Indonesian gamelan; belly dance; Suzuki method). This seminar is designed to develop research skills, as we pursue original fieldwork, archival research, and oral history interviews.

Drawing from a number of case studies from throughout Africa and the African Diaspora, we will first endeavor to understand and contextualize issues related to education, social uplift, the environment, and the economy as they relate to specific communities. We will then examine how a series of organizations (from grassroots campaigns to multinational initiatives) utilize the performing arts in response to those issues. Among the issues we will discuss at length are: -How do performers and organizations navigate the interplay between showcasing the performance talents of individuals and groups and foregrounding an issue or cause? More broadly, what dilemmas emerge as social and aesthetic imperatives intermingle? -What are the dynamics between people acting on a local level within their communities and their various international partnerships and audiences? -How can government or NGO sponsorship help and/or hinder systemic change? By the end of the semester, students will be equipped with conceptual frameworks and critical vocabularies that can help them ascertain the functions of performance within larger organizations and in service to complex societal issues. Throughout the course, we will watch and listen to a variety of performances from traditional genres to hip-hop, however this class is less about learning to perform or analyze any particular genre than it is about thinking through how performance is used as a vehicle for social change. Case studies will include youth outreach and uplift in Tanzania through the United African Alliance, campaigns to promote girls' education in Benin and Zimbabwe, community-wide decolonizing initiatives through the Yole!Africa Center in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the cultural reclamation of a mining town in Suriname through the arts organization, Stichting Kibii.

Modern folklore in present Africa is as authentic as the Africa of old.\" --Keita Fodeba, founding Artistic Director of Les Ballet Africain, Guinea, West Africa. This course will involve intensive dance and musical practice that is rooted in traditional and contemporary/forms from the African continent and the Diaspora. We will examine the international impact of countries who achieved independence from Europe in the late 1950's-1990s such as Les Ballets Africain, National Dance Company of Senegal, Bembeya Jazz, Ghana Dance Ensemble, and the national dance and music companies of Zimbabwe, Jamaica, and Cuba. Our study will include the impact of artists such as James Brown, Miriam Makeba, Michael Jackson, and Youssou N'Dour, as well as Hip Hop culture and the emergence of new forms of music and dance or modern folklore.

Using the class as the primary practice choir, students will learn to express specific musical ideas and concepts through conducting patterns and body language, and will develop fluency and ease in these mediums through the study of varied repertoire and techniques. Regular videotaping of conducting sessions will provide opportunities for students to study themselves. Repertoire will include a broad survey of works from the early Renaissance to early 21st century, accompanied and a cappella, and issues of conducting ensembles at various skill levels will be addressed.

However, timbre is not commonly discussed in detail since our technical vocabulary for describing this musical element has been comparatively limited. Our work in this seminar will involve readings in music theory and history, ethnomusicology, and cognitive studies as well as in the emerging field of sound studies as we attempt to define timbre, explore its manifestations in a wide variety of music, and develop an analytical approach and descriptive vocabulary tooled specifically to this musical element. We will consider how composers and performers of both art and popular musics have wielded timbre as an expressive device and how technology may allow us to analyze details of timbral performance and perception. We will investigate the relationship between timbre and orchestration, from the rise of Haydn's orchestra to the Klangfarbenmelodie of Schoenberg. We will consider extremes of timbral distortion in both vocal and electric guitar effects in rock music as well in such traditions as Korean p'ansori and will explore various forms of speech music and the work of composers of spectral music to expand our case studies. Finally, our own experiments with timbral effects will bring our seminar to bear on our musical performance.

This seminar will trace the course of the Classical and early Romantic period \"Bach Revival\" through Mozart, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, and Clara and Robert Schumann, and explore how he was venerated in the later Romantic era by Brahms and Busoni. Our main focus, however, will be on how composers of the modern era have viewed him and used his music. We will test critical conceptual frameworks offered by David Lowenthal's \"The Past is a Foreign Country\" and Harold Bloom's \"The Anxiety of Influence,\" using them as lenses through which to view contemporary classical composers' Bach-inspired creations, ranging from Schoenberg and Webern through Sophia Gubaidulina, George Crumb, and David Lang. Finally, we will consider both the musical techniques and meanings of reworkings and quotations of Bach's music in film, jazz and popular music. [ more ]\n\nMUS 473 SEM Process Music\n\nLast offered Spring 2018\n\nThe course explores process music--music organized by the unfolding of various mathematical or mechanistic procedures--as defined by Steve Reich's \"Music as Gradual Process.\" The seminar centers upon Reich's process music, placing it in the context of its intellectual and musical precursors, the process and minimalist music of his contemporaries, and the subsequent generations of composers who built on Reich's foundation. The course will develop analytical tools to both define the processes that composers use in their music and to explore the particular relation between the musical materials (melodic, rhythmic) a composer chooses and the processes to which those material are subject. Reich's process music and its techniques will serve as both a lens and mirror to examine and reflect upon precursor repertoires, including the contrapuntal music of Bach, isorhythmic motets of the middle ages and their cyclic counterparts in the music of Messiaen, serial procedures of the 1950s, and Ghanaian ensemble drumming. Contemporary musicians/composers to be explored as lecture topics and student projects will include Riley, Glass, Tenney, Lang, Tom Johnson, and Radiohead. [ more ]\n\nMUS 474 SEM Music and Corporeality\n\nLast offered Spring 2022\n\nMusic is often said to derive its own special quality from the fact that it exists outside of visual representation and is not contained within a physical form, yet musical sound and practice are created through and act upon bodies in numerous ways. This course aims to address how music and bodies shape and respond to one another. Drawing from sources across musical sub-disciplines and extending to fields including cognitive science, sound studies, performance studies, and anthropology, we will follow four lines of inquiry related to music and corporeality: 1.) Embodied practices: techniques and pedagogies in performance and in listening (including praxis [Bourdieu], Deep Listening [Oliveros, Becker], Alexander Technique); 2.) Music's physical effects and affects: pleasure and pain, the vocalic body [Bonefant, Connor, Barthes], cognitive processes; 3.) Ideological moves: questioning the universality of music and of bodies and Cartesian dualism; 4.) Music and bodies at their limits: cyberfeminism, futurism, disembodiment, ecstasy, questions of artificiality/virtuality. Musical examples will be drawn from classical and popular sources from Euro/American idioms and beyond, predominantly from the late 20th and 21st centuries. [ more ]\n\nMUS 475 SEM Hearing Through Seeing: Music and Visuality\n\nLast offered Spring 2024\n\nWe hear music, but seldom is the experience purely aural -- the visual also plays a crucial role. Sound and sight converge when we observe musicians performing in concert venues, patterns of notes and rhythms on the musical score, pictures and text on album and sheet music covers, moving images on screens in films, music videos, and video games. A programmatic work conjures specific images, even whole narratives, in our \"mind's eye,\" or imagination. A work of absolute music, such as a fugue or symphony, can do so as well, although what we envision here may be largely abstract. With hybrid genres, such as opera, musical theater, and dance, the musical and the visual jointly command our attention, often in a spectacular display. This seminar explores myriad ways that \"seeing\" mediates our experience of hearing, making, and understanding music. We will examine a broad range of topics, including synesthesia; visuality in performance and interpretation; visual metaphors such as line, color, and space in music analysis and criticism; music and representation; intersections between music and painting, sculpture, and architecture; operatic staging; illuminated music manuscripts; eye music and graphic notation; and sound and image in digital media.

Music history is reliant upon, and tends to privilege, its symbolic rendering in fixed notation. Yet, notated music--described by musicologist Nino Pirrotta as \"the visible tip of an iceberg... seven-eighths of [which] remain submerged\"--tells only a fraction of the story we seek to understand when studying musics of the past. In this seminar, we will address the unique challenges of studying the relationship between orality and literacy in historical musical practice. We will begin by considering the creative role of memory and embodied ritual in oral musical performance and transmission, as well as the ways in which various cultures have attempted to preserve such practices and the inherently transformative process they undergo when fixed in notation. We will then explore the range of theories and methodologies that scholars and performers have taken in approaching oral musical practices of the past in relation to varying levels of textual and musical literacy. Topics may include studies of epic poetry, jazz improvisation, medieval plainchant, troubadour song, improvised counterpoint, son mexicano, Neapolitan lyric song and dance, Ethiopian Christian chant, medieval and early modern instrumental music practices, Arab-Andalusian music, music in the commedia dell'arte, and various examples of contrafacture. Over the course of the semester, students will develop and present their own independent research aimed at producing a collaborative mock conference/performance as a final project for the class.
