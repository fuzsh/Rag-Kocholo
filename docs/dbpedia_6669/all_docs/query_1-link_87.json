        "text": "You probably already know that displaying photos and artwork around your home is a great way to up the personality of your space—but how you hang said photos on your walls can also upgrade the pieces themselves, turning flea market finds and iPhone shots into museum-worthy magic. Check out these 30 creative ways to display your family photos and artwork collections, from vintage-inspired picture rails to modern ledges and everything in between, you're sure to find a display and composition you love ahead.\n\nA hammer and nails aren't a prerequisite to a beautiful photo display—in fact, you don't need them at all! Take a hint from designer Sarah Magness' handbook and use any available surface to lean your artwork instead. Just make sure the pieces aren't too precious or at risk of being plowed over by kids or pets.\n\nWhen it comes to hanging treasured pieces of artwork, you want to put them somewhere you can really enjoy them every day. And if that spot happens to be the ceiling of your bedroom? Well, so be it! The creative locale can actually be a great spot for a one-of-a-kind display, as seen in this dramatic primary suite designed by Krystal Matthews.\n\nTo make a photo or art collection feel cohesive, stick to a general theme (don't worry, it doesn't have to be too prescriptive!), like the loosely nautical display seen here in the home of designer Jeffrey Alan Marks. Not only will it visually tie together your arrangement, but a common thread will allow you to be more playful with your other elements, like framing or matting, without skewing too eclectic.\n\nMany homes—especially older ones—often have puzzling nooks or walls that just need a little something to make them come alive. (Hint: Art is that little something.) The next time you've got a sloped wall that has you stumped, try using it as an opportunity for a uniquely-shaped gallery wall display. Here, designer Phillip Smith leaned into the charm of his 1716 Hudson Valley home with an eccentric display of frames, sketches, and photographs.\n\nIf you're the indecisive type that wants to take pictures down almost as quickly as you put them up, a photo ledge could be the perfect solution for you. Instead of committing to a permanent gallery wall display (with real nails and lots of measurements), photo ledges—like this angular display in a home by Laura Hodges—allow you more flexibility to rearrange your photos on a whim.\n\nIf your home boasts particularly tall walls, carrying a gallery-style arrangement only halfway up them may look unfinished. Instead, lean into the drama and go floor-to-ceiling with your display, as designer Andrew Brown did here. Sure, you won't be able to have those top pieces in your sightline every day, but the end result will be impactful enough to make it worth it.\n\nFiguring out the right way to display your photos or artwork is as much about listening to your chosen pieces as it is listening to your home. You want to strike a symbiotic balance with all elements—from the framing and matting to the layout—to find the right \"look\" for your pieces. Here, a bold collection of pieces marries seamlessly with the room's color palette thanks to a streamlined display and simple white framing."
