        "text": "POP CONFERENCE 2024\n\nLegacy! Legacy! Music, Collections and Archives\n\nMarch 7 - 9 2024\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\nPresented by USC Thornton School of Music\n\nWith USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism\n\nNow in its 22nd year, the annual Pop Conference is the premier music writing and pop music event. Every year, we feature leading scholars, journalists, writers, and musicians engaging in insightful dialogues around a wealth of pop music topics. This year’s conference theme, “Legacy! Legacy! Music, Collections, and Archives,” invites us to explore a wide range of ideas and concepts related to the idea of legacy in popular music, and the transforming meaning of music archives and collections. Among the questions the conference will consider: What do musicians, bands, critics and fans leave behind once they’ve exited the building? How do we remember, or forget, music scenes? What is left to remember of the different ways they’ve shaped and moved worlds? What do we do with a multitude of legacies living in the present…and how do we shape the legacies we hope to leave behind?\n\nAll of the events are scheduled on USC’s Los Angeles University Park campus. All times listed are PST. Some events may be recorded/livestreamed. On-site registration begins at 12 pm on Thursday March 7 and at 8 am on Friday March 8 and Saturday March 9.\n\nOpen to the Public and Free Admission with Conference Registration.\n\nCLICK HERE TO PRE-REGISTER.\n\nConference Produced by Michelle Habell-Pallán and Jason King\n\nAssociate Producers: madison moore, Karen Tongson, and Oliver Wang. 2024 Program Committee: Eddy Francisco Alvarez Jr., Jessica Bisset Perea, Bettina Judd, Oscar Garza, Amy Linden, madison moore, Sonnet Retman, Justin Sayles, Audrey Silvestre, RJ Smith, Melissa A. Weber, Cristina Verán, and Deborah Wong.\n\nArtwork by Sharolyn Hagen; Design by Unincorporated\n\nPop Conference is supported by Critical Minded, a grantmaking and learning initiative cofounded by the Nathan Cummings and Ford foundations to support cultural critics of color in the United States."
