Despite his success during his life, he fell into nearly complete obscurity after his death. This volume offers a timely and critical reevaluation of this versatile and innovative Renaissance artist, featuring paintings and drawings by Foschi and his contemporaries along with decorative arts objects that provide insight into the world of wealthy 16th-century Florentines. It includes essays by Nelda Damiano, Pierre Daura Curator of European Art, Georgia Museum of Art, and the organizing curator for the exhibition; Simone Giordani, professor of art history at “Aurelio Saffi” Institute, Florence; David Franklin, curator with the Archive of Modern Conflict, Thomson Collection, Toronto and London, UK; and Elizabeth Currie, freelance lecturer and author specializing in the history of fashion and textiles. Each image in the exhibition is illustrated full page with numerous comparatives. Damiano, Giordano, Franklin, Currie, Philippe Costamagna, Dale L. Couch, Ian Hicks, Amanda Hilliam, Robert G. La France, Amanda Mikolic and Perri Lee Roberts.\n\nPublishing Date: April 2023\n\n240 pages; $50.00 (hardcover)\n\nISBN: 978-0-915977-581\n\nReckonings and Reconstructions: Southern Photography from the Do Good Fund\n\n“Reckonings and Reconstructions” is a visual and textual investigation of southern photography since World War II. The book (co-published with the University of Georgia Press) and its partner exhibition present 125 color photographs from the Do Good Fund by a wide-ranging group of 77 photographers, diverse in gender, race, ethnicity and region. W. Ralph Eubanks addresses southern memory and the ethics of photography. Grace Elizabeth Hale considers the role of Athens, Georgia — with its vibrant community of photographers, renowned photography program at the University of Georgia and celebrated alternative art and music scene — within the history of southern photography. Essays by Jasmine Amussen, Rosalind Bentley, Lauren Henkin, Jeffrey Richmond-Moll, RaMell Ross and Jeff Whetstone examine expansive and internally paradoxical themes: land, labor, law and protest, migration, food, ritual and kin. Together, these themes link disparate works in the Do Good collection and capture southern history, culture and identity in all its complexity and contradictions. With the photographs as their backbone, these essays help construct and deconstruct each thematic category, resisting notions of the South as a retrograde region and instead presenting the ever-changing qualities of the place and its people. A region where despair and hope, terror and beauty, pain and joy, and trauma and dignity coexist and commingle. A place seeking reconciliation and restoration, captured by photographers with a vision of a “Better South.”\n\nPublishing Date: September 2022\n\n242 pages; $49.95 (hardcover)\n\nISBN: 978-1946657-14-5\n\nGraphic Eloquence: American Modernism on Paper from the Collection of Michael T. Ricker\n\nAccompanying an exhibition of the same name on view at the Georgia Museum of Art, University of Georgia, “Graphic Eloquence: American Modernism on Paper from the Collection of Michael T. Ricker” documents an expansive collection and a gift to the museum. American modernism in the visual arts has garnered sustained interest among scholars and general audiences in recent years, though typically with a focus on modernist painting. This exhibition and publication seek to expand that narrow emphasis, highlighting an array of techniques and a range of artists who explored modernism’s myriad forms through paper-based media. Artists working in modernist modes shared challenges regardless of location, and this volume brings out these commonalities as it focuses on regional centers that embraced and supported modernist trends. Unlike more exclusive accounts of modernist painting, the story of modernist works on paper provides a broader, more democratic view of American modernism that highlights the contributions of many lesser-known artists to this important twentieth-century history. The catalogue includes an introduction by curator of American art Jeffrey Richmond-Moll and an essay and catalogue entries by Michael T. Ricker and is thoroughly illustrated in color.\n\nPublishing Date: March 2022\n\n360 pages; $60 (hardcover)\n\nISBN: 978-1946657-13-8\n\nGeorgia Matters: Celebrating Two Decades of Scholarship: The 10th Henry D.

Vanessa Helder, Patsy Santo, Gertrude Abercrombie, Honoré Sharrer, Eldzier Cortor, Hughie Lee-Smith, Everett Spruce, Patrick Sullivan and many others.

Born in Atlanta, Georgia, Emma Amos (1937 – 2020) was a distinguished painter and printmaker. She is best known for her bold and colorful mixed-media paintings that create visual tapestries in which she examines the intersection of race, class, gender and privilege in both the art world and society at large. The catalogue includes essays by Shawnya Harris, Larry D. and Brenda A. Thompson Curator of African American and African Diasporic Art at the Georgia Museum of Art, the curator of the exhibition and the editor of the catalogue; Lisa Farrington of Howard University; artist LaToya Ruby Frazier; Laurel Garber, Park Family Assistant Curator of Prints and Drawings at the Philadelphia Museum of Art; artist Kay Walkingstick; and Phoebe Wolfskill, associate professor in the departments of American studies and African American and African Diaspora studies at Indiana University.

Its extraordinary assembly of objects dating from the 3rd to the 8th century CE belongs to Emanuel and Anna Nadler of New York City and Palm Beach. The Nadler family has long been one of the most important collectors of Coptic art. Emanuel’s father, Maurice Nadler (1885–1941), a prominent industrialist from Alexandria who made art acquisitions in Egypt and Germany, originally put this collection together between 1920 and 1941.\n\nCoptic art was made by and for native Egyptians, Greeks and Romans who favored both classical pagan and Christian themes. The exhibition includes more than 50 objects in marble, tapestry, bronze, bone, ivory, pottery and stone, which have not been seen by the public in nearly 40 years. Both it and the catalogue focus on the history of the collection and on changing perceptions of late antique art from Egypt, with extensive full-page, full-color illustrations and an essay by curator Asen Kirin.\n\n208 pages; $60 (hardcover)\n\nISBN: 978-0915977-43-7\n\nPublishing Date: November 2020\n\nMaster, Pupil, Follower: 16th- to 18th-Century Italian Works on Paper\n\nThis catalogue accompanied the exhibition of the same name, on view at and organized by the Georgia Museum of Art at the University of Georgia from December 21, 2019, to March 8, 2020. Co-curators Robert Randolf Coleman (professor emeritus of Renaissance and baroque art history, University of Notre Dame), Nelda Damiano (Pierre Daura Curator of European Art, Georgia Museum of Art) and Benedetta Spadaccini (Biblioteca Ambrosiana, Milano) contributed entries on each of the 32 works in the exhibition, all of which are illustrated full page and in color. Coleman provided an introductory essay and museum director William Underwood Eiland wrote both a preface and a brief essay on collector Giuliano Ceseri, from whose collection many of these works come.\n\nCurators selected drawings and prints by artists including Giulio Benso, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione, Salvatore Rosa and followers of Veronese and Tintoretto to represent specific artistic styles and Italian regional schools, and the catalogue is organized by region. An examination of the drawings revealed some previously erroneous assumptions, resulting in new attributions in some cases. Drawings by Giulio Romano, Claudio Ridolfi, Palma il Giovane and Guercino are published here for the first time.\n\n138 pages; $30 (softcover)\n\nISBN: 978-091597718-5\n\nPublishing Date: August 2020\n\nBelonging: Georgia and Region in the National Fabric: The 9th Henry D.

Green Center for the Study of the Decorative Arts, the Georgia Museum of Art at the University of Georgia organized the exhibition “Material Georgia 1733 – 1900: Two Decades of Scholarship,” on which this heavily illustrated catalogue expands. It takes a comprehensive look at Georgia’s diverse contributions to early decorative arts and summarizes the scholarship of the past 20 years. It focuses on revealing new discoveries made in the field, pointing a way forward and making the case Georgia can hold its own against any other state in terms of the quality of its decorative arts. “Material Georgia” surveys Georgia decorative art in media including furniture, silver, pottery, textiles, basketry and portraits. Georgia has had a troubled history, shaped by the system of slavery and widespread inequality, but its diverse material culture tells about the lives of all its people.\n\nDale L. Couch, editor and author of much of this catalogue, is curator of decorative arts at the Georgia Museum of Art and directs the Henry D. Green Center for the Study of the Decorative Arts there. Other authors include Linda Chesnut, chair of the museum’s Decorative Arts Advisory Committee; Daniel Chamberlin, independent scholar and former Green Center intern; silver expert Charlotte Morley Crabtree; graduate intern Ashlyn Davis; early Georgia furniture expert Jeff Finch; Jenny Garwood, adjunct curator of textiles and curatorial and administrative associate at MESDA; Brenda Hornsby Heindl, independent scholar and practicing potter; Maryellen Higginbotham, retired curator of the Root House Museum in Marietta, Georgia; Robert Leath, chief curator and vice president at MESDA; Joseph Litts, master’s student at the University of Delaware and former Green Center intern; Keith M. McCurry, an authority on early furniture from the upstate of South Carolina; Caroline Rainey, an independent scholar focused on early American material culture and former Green Center intern; James Rooks, master’s candidate in the UGA historic preservation program and Green Center intern; and Kathleen Staples, independent scholar in the social and cultural history of England and the Americas as expressed through textiles and related craft.\n\n240 pages; $60 (hardcover)\n\nISBN: 978-194665711-4\n\nPublishing Date: December 2019\n\nDeborah Roberts: The Evolution of Mimi\n\nThis catalogue was published with Spelman College Museum of Fine Art with generous support from the Wish Foundation, Inc., and accompanies the exhibition of the same name, on view at Spelman from January 25 to May 19, 2018. It is edited by Andrea Barnwell Brownlee, PhD, director of the Spelman College Museum of Fine Art, and features contributions by Kirsten Pai Buick, PhD; Erin J. Gilbert; Beverly Guy-Sheftall, PhD; Antwaun Sargent; and Franklin Sirmans; a foreword by Mary Schmidt Campbell, PhD, and an interview between Deborah Roberts and Valerie Cassel Oliver. Additional support was provided by Susanne Vielmetter Los Angeles Projects, Los Angeles, and Stephen Friedman Gallery, London. It includes full-page, full-color illustrations of the 80-plus works that were on view in the exhibition as well as installation photographs. It is the first major publication on Roberts’ work and includes some of her early work as well as her more recent collages and text-based images. This book is out of print.\n\n160 pages; $40 (hardcover)\n\nISBN: 978-1946657107\n\nPublishing Date: August 2019\n\nRichard Hunt: Synthesis\n\nThis exhibition catalogue focuses on formative periods in the career of American sculptor Richard Hunt, whose 130-plus public commissions in more than 24 states have made him a legendary figure in modern and contemporary sculpture. Hunt, whose career has spanned six decades, has also been a formidable presence in redefining the role of public sculpture in the late 20th and early 21st century. His parallel studio career shows his experimentation with a variety of media, methods and formal considerations, but has been underexplored critically as an essential aspect of his later success. The catalogue features full-color full-page illustrations of every work in the exhibition, including welded and cast sculpture dating from the 1950s to the present, models he made after his transition to large-scale public commissions in the late 1960s and lithographs and other works on paper. Curator Shawnya Harris supplies a long essay. The book also includes a detailed chronology of Hunt’s career and historic photos.\n\nThis book is out of print.\n\nPublishing Date: October 2018\n\n120 pages; $40\n\nISBN: 978-1946657091\n\nVernacular Modernism: The Photography of Doris Ulmann\n\nThis is the first complete retrospective of the work of photographer Doris Ulmann (1882 – 1934), treating the full scope of her production, including her early pictorialist photographs, her studio portrait production, her focus on the rural craftsmen and women of Appalachia and her work on the African American and Gullah communities of coastal South Carolina and Georgia.\n\nUlmann created studio portraits in her native New York of literary and artistic celebrities but also traveled to Appalachia, the rural South and the Gullah coastal region to photograph locals and their crafts. Because of her variety of subjects, her work is difficult to categorize, but it has elements of pictorialism (fine art photography that often blurred its subjects to emphasize atmosphere) and documentary photography. It focuses on preservation of the American past and shows an interest in some of modernism’s concerns: a priority on form, sharper tonal contrast and quality of line, and unmanipulated prints.\n\nPublishing Date: August 2018\n\n200 pages; $50\n\nISBN: 978-1946657084\n\nBloom Where You're Planted: The Collection of Deen Day Sanders\n\nThis catalogue accompanies the exhibition of the same name, on view at the Georgia Museum of Art from May 19 to July 29, 2018. Drawn from one of the most important Georgia-based collections of American art, the catalogue features furniture and porcelain as well as paintings in a unique opportunity to see the exceptional collection from Bellmere, the home of Jim and Deen Day Sanders. Essays discuss a wide range of topics including the American West, depictions of reading in late 19th and early 20th century portraiture, creating a home out of the best decorative arts, and interpretations of Florida flora and fauna in an Ernest Lawson painting. The authors of this collection are diverse and include conservation botanist Linda Chafin, State Botanical Garden of Georgia special events coordinator Connie Cottingham, curator of decorative arts Dale L. Couch, director William U. Eiland, curator of American art Sarah Kate Gillespie, associate professor of language and literacy education Jennifer Graff, curator of American paintings Donald D. Keyes, associate professor of history Akela Reason, graduate student Courtney Shimek, and former president of the Friends of the State Botanical Garden Mike Sikes.\n\nPublishing Date: May 2018\n\n136 pages; $50 (hardcover)\n\nISBN: 978-1946657077\n\nClinton Hill\n\nClinton Hill was a multitalented artist who was a Renaissance man of the abstract. Neither cubist, futurist, minimalist, abstractionist, or constructivist, he was all at once. This book and the exhibition it accompanies (on view at the Georgia Museum of Art at the University of Georgia January 6 March 19, 2018) constitute a survey of his career, from printmaker to painter, from pulp-paper pioneer to lyrical wall constructions. Hill s biographer Susan Larsen referred to his effortless fluency of craft, from which his distinctive visual vocabulary takes voice and which these works demonstrate. William U. Eiland is the curator of the exhibition, the author of this book, and the director of the Georgia Museum of Art.\n\nPublishing Date: April 2018\n\n124 pages; $40 (softcover)\n\nISBN: 978-1946657060\n\nFolk and Folks: Variations on the Vernacular: The 8th Henry D.

This book (which accompanies the exhibition of the same name, on view at the museum February 1 - April 29, 2018) tells the story of a small department that began in home economics under the direction of women interested in practical applications of art and design, and now exists in the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences as the Lamar Dodd School of Art, named for its long-time director. It features work by more than 30 faculty members who contributed to craft education at UGA (including Earl McCutchen, Frances Stewart Higgins, Glen Kaufman, Robert Ebendorf, Gary Noffke, Ron Meyers, Andy Nasisse and Ed Lambert). Through their work, it traces the history of studio craft in the United States and the cultural forces that shaped it. Authors Ashley Callahan, Annelies Mondi and Mary Hallam Pearse contribute nine chapters that trace the history of the program from the 1920s to the present, copiously illustrated in color.\n\nPublishing Date: February 2018\n\n372 pages; $40\n\nISBN: 978-1946657046"
