My parents gave me an electric guitar and I got to channel my raw energies through it. Little did I know then that music was gonna be part of my everyday life, in the ups and downs…\n\nAfter graduating Berklee College of Music and studying piano, guitar, songwriting, and music business with the most amazing musicians and friends, I worked as TV Producer in Miami and Mexico, then as member of the band Numasbala in NYC, then as founder of the music project “Manguito” in Guatemala, yet what remained constant those years was my passion to share and teach music to others, whether in a classroom, in a birthday celebration, or even in a hospital…\n\nIn struggling with developing my own voice as singer, I kept searching and searching, studying and struggling, until I found Justin Stoney and NYVC. This experience has changed my life as a person, musician, and teacher, and I am now living, sharing, and teaching in my beautiful home country: Guatemala (you are invited to come!).\n\nAnd now I’m working on new music that searches deeply into Beauty, Truth, and Goodness, and to discover other people through music.\n\n“To sing is to pray twice.” St. Augustine of Canterbury\n\n“As long as my heart beats rhythmically and my voice sings melodically, then my soul shall speak musically.” Javi Sames\n\nA good music instructor goes beyond just showing a student how to use an instrument -- she also inspires a love and appreciation for music and challenges her students to believe and understand that they, too, can become great! This job is one that Jeseth Griffith does not take lightly and one that humbles her each day. A native of Guyana, South America with an upbringing in Antigua, West Indies, Jeseth's pursuit of a musical education began early in her life. At the age of seven, Jeseth asked the pianist at her church in Antigua to teach her how to play the piano. Since that day, her hunger for learning and experiencing music has never been satisfied. Her family later emigrated and moved to the United States. As she grew, she developed a natural passion for singing, taking every opportunity to exercise that gift, particularly at her church. She would later train with Karen Walker and Venus Asai and credits them both for inspiring her to teach. Her training in those formidable years paid off as she became a young adult. She began a fruitful career as a studio session singer, professional background singer and corporate band frontline performer. Throughout her 10+ year career, she has worked with various artists in the Gospel, Jazz, R&B, and Pop genres, both in recording sessions and in live performances. As a vocalist, Jeseth's professional demeanor and distinct sound breed versatility and make her a true in-demand jewel who stands out among her peers around the world. Currently, Jeseth travels regularly with wedding/corporate event bands in the Southeast and is also a passionate worship leader at Grace Church, Intl in Atlanta, GA.\n\nThrough her work in the music industry, Jeseth noticed that not every singer was privy to the type of quality vocal education that she was afforded.

In 2014, she completed the Vocal Teacher Training Course at New York Vocal Coaching in New York, NY under world renowned voice trainer, Justin Stoney.
