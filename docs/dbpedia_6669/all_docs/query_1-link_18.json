        "text": "The 2018 Outsider Art Fair arrives this weekend at a time when the very concept of outsider art — work made by self-taught or developmentally impaired artists — has never seemed more capacious or in flux. At the moment, “The Beautiful Mind: The Drawings of Santiago Ramón y Cajal,” at Grey Art Gallery presents renderings by a Spanish neuroanatomist that revolutionized understanding of the brain but increasingly hold their own as modernist drawings. And “Murder Is Her Hobby: Frances Glessner Lee and the Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death,” at the Smithsonian’s Renwick Gallery in Washington, contains tiny dioramas originally used as forensic aids by police, that also presage setup photography of the 1970s and ’80s.\n\nOther changes include the increasing presence of outsider artists in galleries where you’d least expect them. David Lewis, who oversees a large, pristine and hip gallery on the Lower East Side, is working with the Souls Grown Deep Foundation on a show of the work of Thornton Dial, a towering figure among outsiders of the South, known for his startlingly rough-hewed paintings whose surfaces can include basically anything: rugs, tree branches and wire. On Jan. 25 Mr. Lewis’s gallery will inaugurate its representation of the artist with a show intriguingly titled “Mr. Dial’s America.” Until Sunday, there’s a big Dial front and center at the fair: “A Bird Will Always Try to Fly” (1991), an avian creature with the markings of a tiger pursued by two figures, at Fred Giampietro.\n\nTwo major museum exhibitions signal greater inclusion in the art historical scheme. On Jan. 28, the National Gallery of Art in Washington will unveil “Outliers and American Vanguard Art,” an exhibition of some 300 works by about 90 artists trained and self-taught. It will examine how attention to folk and outsider art — from artists, collectors and museums — has ebbed and flowed through the 20th century. And in May the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which has a large collection of mostly 19th-century American folk art will take the plunge with a show centering on the 57 works by black Southern outsiders — including Dial — it recently received from the Souls Grown Deep Foundation. It’s inspiring title: “History Refused to Die.” That refusal rings loud and clear in this year’s Outsider Art Fair. Some of the supporting evidence:\n\nRICCO/MARESCA If you want to start with some masterpieces, go for a drawing here by the great and prolific Martín Ramírez that is unlike any I’ve ever seen. In it, his radiating architectural motifs frame an uncharacteristically soft Edenic landscape that includes several trees, one spouting a rainbow of leaves.\n\nFLEISHER/OLLMAN Also in the masterpiece range: two extremely rare drawings by P. M. Wentworth, a contemporary of Ramírez. His “Imagination: Jupiter=Planet” from around 1953 provides a typically Wentworthian worldview. We see the Earth curve: God in her kingdom and varied landscapes alive with meandering stone walls.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
