        "text": "I have to confess, I booked my ticket for David Hare’s The Judas Kiss solely for Freddie Fox related reasons, but he certainly didn’t disappoint (Oh man, did he not disappoint *fans face*).\n\nI’ve never been to the Hampstead Theatre before and I did rather like it. I was at the far end of the fourth row of the stalls and it was a very good view. It’s a nice modern venue and it looks like they have some interesting shows in the pipeline so I may well be back again before the year is out.\n\nI though it was an interesting play. I previously knew very little about Oscar Wilde beyond the fact that he was punished harshly for his homosexuality (and obviously that he was a fabulous writer, but that was somewhat irrelevant to the plot). The play was split between two important moments in his life (Note; From here on, this post contains spoilers, although they’re more on the subject of Wilde’s life than specifics of the play). Act one was set in an English hotel room where Oscar debates his situation and ultimately, despite his friend Robbie’s pleas, he listens to Lord Alfred; Bosie, the boy he loves and chooses to stay and fight his case. Several years later, act two finds Wilde in Naples, living with Bosie after having served his prison sentence. Over the course of a day or so, we see the end to their relationship in a rather miserable sort of way.\n\nFreddie has always reminded me of Draco Malfoy (this gets relevant, trust me!), perhaps inevitably, given that he’s so very pale, blond and really rather posh (I adore the way he speaks!). The fact that I’m currently reading a novel length fic in which, so far, Draco has been far more real and in-keeping with his character as JK wrote him (not very nice and horribly prejudiced, still living in his father’s shadow and weighing his every action by Lucius’s standards) seemed to bring the parallel to an extra level. Not that Bosie was prejudiced, at least not in the way Draco is, but he was an arrogant posh boy who cared far more about himself and his own perceived victories (in this case over his father, but hey, give that father the name Harry and we’re talking). He annoyed the hell out of me throughout the first act and it irritated me even further that I knew Oscar would ultimately listen to him and give in. Robbie, by contrast, spoke many of the words I’d have chosen if I’d been in his position, but the fact he was unable to truly make himself heard, or rather, he was heard but ignored, bugged me almost as much as the rest of the characters did. I liked the serving staff though! And Arthur (played by Ben Hardy) did have a very nice arse – which was on full display at the very start of the play ;). Small as their parts were, I liked the comic relief they provided from the more serious aspects of the first act.\n\nBosie annoyed me far less in the second act, or at least, I much preferred him in the earlier part. Believe it or not, my reasons were not even (entirely :P) based on the fact that he started off completely naked and spent much of the rest of his opening scenes wearing nothing but a sheet tied around his waist, leaving his chest bare and flashing a dangerous amount of leg. In fact I found him really quite distracting (big surprise there, I find him distracting fully dressed!). Of course the tanned, muscled Adonis, Galileo (played by Tom Colley), who didn’t even bother with a sheet… and then made a brief appearance dripping wet, really didn’t help my concentration either (I’m awful, I know, but lusting after pretty, yet completely unattainable boys is such fun…)!\n\nUnfortunately the sexiness couldn’t last and with the return of clothing came the return of Bosie’s more irritating characteristics. He was an arrogant little twerp in the end and he made me rather mad by the time he finally made his departure. He came across as completely self serving and with no real principles save the ones that most suited his cause at that given moment. His cause, however, was not love or honesty or gay rights or anything so noble. His cause was himself and screw anyone who no longer fit with what he felt to be best for him at that specific time. Can you tell he bugged me?! I think it was his ranting and raving about fighting for gay rights – which is very much at the forefront of my mind what with Adam Lambert and Gavin Creel and all – followed not long after by his pronouncement that he wasn’t really one of them, he wasn’t really like that and so on and so forth that really annoyed me. With that final speech he almost seemed worse than the people who condemned Wilde to jail in the first place. (Having flicked through the programme after the fact, it does seem that Lord Alfred was a world class git through most of his life).\n\nAnyhoo, I’m not really sure what to say of my overall opinions. It was a good play, certainly; well acted and well presented. It was enlightening and on an artistic level I could appreciate its greatness. My only criticism really was that the characters bugged me, but then that was evidently how they were written. They weren’t especially nice people, though that was true of some more than others, and they definitely weren’t heroes, but that made them far more real. Personally, I like the fantasy of perfection, whether that be happily ever after, or the perfect tragedy doesn’t matter overly much, but this was real and wonderful as the play was, I can never quite like it as much as I’d have liked a fantasy.\n\nThe cast were fabulous though, doing a truly magnificent job of bringing those irritatingly flawed characters to life. Admittedly, I couldn’t quite take Rupert Everett seriously, although that’s almost entirely my own fault. My constant Freddie/Draco comparison, along with the drawl in his tone and the hair style often summoned up images of Professor Snape, whilst the character (and I suppose the knowledge that he once played him in a film) and also the hair, I suppose, reminded me often of Stephen Fry. Mostly, however, I found myself recalling Rupert’s role in St. Trinians (I only saw it last weekend, having had no idea what to expect and was totally bewildered by it), which really wasn’t in-keeping with the character he was supposed to be playing and I found slightly distracting at first. That said, he did a fabulous job and by the second act I’d completely bought into the character. I think there may still have been the occasional Stephen Fry comparison, but I think that’s understandable in the circumstances. Freddie Fox was also fabulous as Bosie (or to give him his full title, Lord Alfred Douglas), no matter how much he made me grind my teeth! He was full of (self-)righteous indignation and shouted speeches, but there was a soft childishness to him that managed to break through every so often that really showcased his talent as an actor. (And he looked very nice naked as well :P). Finally Cal MacAninch played Robbie Ross, full of a quiet passion. Of all the characters in the play, I felt he was the most emotionally entangled with the whole situation. He really cared, more so than Oscar who seemed to make light of everything, and certainly more so than Bosie. In every one of his speeches and movements, he made his underlying feelings clear and I enjoyed the subtlety of that a good deal.\n\nThe stage door was a success, granting a full house of autographs and photos with the three leading cast members. Freddie was wearing his hat again, of course, and my delightfully crap back-up camera left me with a faintly blurred photo, but he still looks pretty and I’ve met him before, so I can deal. Rupert was lovely, which was unexpected though I’m not sure why. I suppose I was expecting movie star divaness, but it didn’t happen. There was one professional autograph hunter who I spent most of the wait for the cast disparaging in my head whilst trying to justify why they annoy me so much. They’re not hurting anyone really and I suppose most of them watch the actors they chase in their TV or film careers so it’s not as though they aren’t supporting the performer’s career in some way. Perhaps my dislike stems from the knowledge that there are enough actors now who refuse to do anything because of people like that, but generally it’s not really a problem for me. I always compliment the actors on their performances, so they know that I was there at least (plus I’ll primarily get a programme signed, which generally suggests attendance at the theatre) and it’s rare that there are enough professionals to prevent me from getting what I want in term of autographs and photos, so why do I get so irritated with them?\n\nAnyhoo, I’m actually free next week, as in, I have NOTHING booked… *gasp*, so I have no idea when I’ll next be back. I’ve got a vague intention to try and see Jumpy and/or Hedda Gabbler, plus the hope of day tickets for (finally) the new Rock Of Ages cast a week on Sunday, but I suppose we’ll have to see. I’ll definitely end up at something though. It’s been two years, give or take, since I went a week without a single show and I don’t mean to start breaking that record now!\n\nPeace, loVe loVe and pretty naked blond boys *sigh*,\n\nK xx\n\nPS. I found out today that Oliver Thornton is playing Frank N Furter in next year’s 40th anniversary tour of Rocky Horror. There’s a teaser video on youtube, but I don’t think the news was meant to be announced until next week. After several people located my blog via the search terms ‘Oliver Thornton Rocky Horror’, however, I decided to do a bit of digging, having more than a passing interest in the subject myself (I have one ticket already, but had every intention of purchasing more dependent on casting). It seems that the Priscilla Facebook page leaked the news early and with that in mind, the video does seem to back it up. Of course, I await an official announcement, but it does look as though that may be the case. I’m not actually sure how I feel about it. I could see him as Brad, or even Rocky, but Frank? The idea is certainly growing on me, helped I’m sure by the anticipation of watching him in knickers and suspenders (the video also added to the excitement – lots of shots of toned thighs in fishnet stockings ;)), but initially I must confess I was a little doubtful. I know he can do drag, he was fabulous as Felicia, but he just seems a bit young and pretty to play Frank. He also seems a bit to sweet, in a weird way, even though my second favourite memory of him (the first being that pink sequinned thong *swoon*) was his opening number in Priscilla, complete with leather and whips… I do wish I’d managed to justify seeing him play that role one last time *sigh*. Anyhoo, still can’t wait to find out who the rest of the cast are, but honestly, no matter what my initial reaction was, I can’t wait to see Ollie back on stage.\n\nPPS. Interestingly, or perhaps not very interestingly, but I’m going to say it anyway, the Draco Malfoy in my head when I read fanfic changes depending on what’s going on in my life at any given time. Very occasionally he looks something like Tom Felton, usually after I’ve watched one of the films, and often he’s simply a random blond boy/man that I’ve conjured up with my own imagination. For a long time that image had more than a passing resemblance to Tommy Joe Ratliff and, more recently, during and immediately following my Rock Of Ages marathon, the Draco in my head had more was essentially Dylan Turner with blond hair. Tonight, however, Draco Malfoy is Freddie Fox. Between the character he played in the Judas Kiss and the version of Malfoy in the fic I’m reading, I really can’t see how he could be anyone else!\n\nSo today I decided it was about time I finally organised my programmes rather than just continuing to throw them into a haphazard heap under my bed while praying they don’t end up completely destroyed. Once I started, however, I thought it might be fun to flick through some of them and it turns out I’ve seen a lot of people I now adore in some old shows back when they would have meant nothing to me. I doubt anyone is all that interested in this, but I found it quite fascinating, so I thought I’d blog about it anyway. Of course, I have no guarantees that some of these people were even on the night that I went, but still…. I also have the problem of recognising people in old programmes but not knowing what I’ve seen them in more recently. But anyhoo, here goes nothing:\n\n(This will mostly be an annotated list in no particular order as I put this together whilst going through random piles with no ordering whatsoever except that glossy brochures and programmes were separate due to shelf size issues)\n\nSo to begin, I was busy drooling over old pictures of Liam as Link Larkin in Hairspray and who did I find? David McMullan, the guy I recognised (well it looked a hell of a lot like him anyway and he had a very ‘musical theatre’ sort of manner!) sitting in my row at the Ladykillers last week! It’s just now occurred to me that the reason I recognised him was because I also saw him in Ragtime at the Landor (which was confirmed on finding that programme which also assisted me with working out that the guy I recognised at something – Jingle Balls, maybe? was Alexander Evans). I somehow missed the fact he was also in the ensemble of Love Never Dies though – this is what happens when Ramin is on the stage :P. I think I’ve already mentioned the fact that Aki Omoshayabi was in it Hairspray, but I thought I’d say it again anyway. Woot, hippies :D.\n\nSpeaking of hippies, Holly James was in Starlight Express when I saw it on tour at the New Wimbledon Theatre back in ‘06, with Oliver Thornton as Rusty (wow I wish I remembered that better) and another familiar face; Tim Driesen (from Never Forget).\n\nSpeaking of Never Forget, with the new cast though also in Wimbledon… Scott Garnham played Jose and I’ve even got his autograph to prove he was on that night. What I wouldn’t give to see that again now!\n\nLes Mis, 2004, my first two trips and there was another hippie in the cast – Gemma Baird. Apparently Ollie Thornton was also playing Enjolras back then! Wish I remembered that even more than Starlight.\n\nMark Evans was Brad in Rocky Horror on the last tour but I didn’t know who he was back then :(. It wasn’t even all that long ago, but he was just this gorgeous man to drool over then. I didn’t ‘discover him’, so to speak, until Bobby Cronin’s gig when he completely blew me away.\n\nStuart Matthew Price was a vocalist at Strictly Gershwin when it first opened.\n\nAlastair Brookshaw (who I saw as Leo Frank in Parade at the Southwark Playhouse) was a vocalist the first time I saw Shoes at Sadler’s Wells. Jared Hageman was also one of the dancers. I’ve seen him in Matthew Bourne’s Dorian Grey, but far more importantly, he was one of Take That’s dancers on the Progress Tour. I think I spotted him on X-Factor too.\n\nChris Passey as Benjamin in the Joseph tour 2007 at the Birmingham Hippodrome!\n\nI knew this already, but Zoe Birkett, who I loved on Pop Idol 2002 and who should have been playing Dionne on the UK tour of Hair (she’s still playing the role in Munich) was in Respect La Diva and I even got her autograph, despite not realising who she was until the Hair tour was announced!\n\nBurn the Floor starring Brian Fortuna and Ali Bastian apparently also featured Artem Chigvintsev and Robin Windsor, before either joined Strictly. Obviously I didn’t have a clue who they were at the time, but somehow managed to get autographs off both of them anyway, even though I only got signatures from six out of twenty+ dancers (and two of those were the ‘stars’). Shame I didn’t bother with pictures (at least I don’t think I did, I should probably check that)!\n\nMany years ago, well, six, but it feels like longer, I saw a play called As You Desire Me which for some reason really stood out for me and I still remember the story, or at least the gist of it, to this day. Turns out it starred Kristin Scott Thomas and Bob Hoskins. Unfortunately, this pre-dated my regular stage door activity, but it’s still kinda funky. Especially since I never could remember the name of that play and it’s rather useful to have rediscovered the programme.\n\nEven more years ago than that, back in 1994, I went to see Joseph and the Technicolor Dreamcoat at the Palace Theatre, Manchester, for the very first time and I guess my love of musical theatre was probably born around then. I still remember that show so clearly, it’s weird, especially since I’ve seen it a fair few times since then, yet it’s that first performance that’s always stayed with me. Darren Day starred and the theatre trip was the culmination of months of constantly singing the songs. For whatever reason, my parents wouldn’t take me to see it, but then my Grandma treated me when I went to visit her and apparently I beamed throughout the whole show!\n\nAnd then in 1998, also in Manchester, I saw Oliver starring Gary Wilmot as Fagin. Turns out Michael Cotton was in the cast too. Wonder what I’d have thought back then if I’d known all these years later I’d see him dancing around in the buff in Naked Boys Singing :P. I suspect I’d have been shocked and appalled given I was only about 13 and I was oh so sweet and innocent back then!\n\nBack into the noughties and I went to see Ewan McGregor in Guys and Dolls in 2005. All I really remember was being stuck right up at the back and not getting to see Ewan at the stage door afterwards, but turns out the show also featured a rather young looking Summer Strallen.\n\nOne of my bigger ‘ wow, really?!’ moments came when I found the programme for The Pirates of Penzance at the Savoy in 2004. I remember the show and remember being rather excited about Anthony Head playing the Pirate King. What I obviously wouldn’t have been excited about at the time but would so love to see now, was Hadley Fraser as Fredric!\n\nAdam Pearce (who I know from Love Never Dies) was one of the brothers in Joseph when Lee Mead was starring. Stephen John Davis (who I saw as Emile in South Pacific) was Reuben too.\n\nI’ve no idea when I saw Beauty and the Beast, but given that it was on at the Dominion, it must have been a fair few years ago since We Will Rock You has been on there for the past decade. According to the programme it premiered in 1997, so I’d guess at the date being sometime around then. Anyhoo, a quick flick through the programme produced the info that Barry James (Firmin in Phantom) played Cogsworth and Earl Carpenter was in the ensemble!\n\nOne particular programme I’ve been looking for for a while, is the Far Pavilions. I don’t think it was much of a success, but I remember enjoying it. Obviously I don’t remember Hadley Fraser in this either, but I’ve known for a while that he was in it so it was kinda nice to finally find the programme and see the picture with my own eyes.\n\nSpamalot starring Tim Curry was an interesting find. Mark Evans was a swing, so there’s a good chance I didn’t see him and Craige Els (Never Forget) was a walking understudy, so I’m almost certain I wouldn’t have seen him either, but Hannah Waddingham was the Lady of the Lake and I’m pretty sure I saw her at least!\n\nI’m loving these old programmes too, the head shots are so dated – all those massive perms on the women and boyband curtains on the men! Anyhoo, another trip to the Manchester Opera House some time around 1996 and Alexis Owen-Hobbs was playing Cha-Cha. (Shane Richie was starring as Danny, but he was off when I went to see it. I have no clue how I still remember that fact though!).\n\nOliver Thornton was also in Chicago back when I saw it. Who knew I’d seen him in so much!\n\nThe weirdest by far is actually a concert programme, from Party in the Park 2000. It’s in rather horrific condition as I can still remember the way it poured down for most of the day (which resulted in my programme getting completely sodden through and all the pages getting stuck together. I remember the concert and even the nightmare of getting tickets, what I’d forgotten were the acts. I remember Ronan Keating and I remember being very disappointed when Stephen Gateley didn’t perform despite being on the bill. I remember that the only time I sat down all day was during Moloko because I didn’t much like them and I remember Lionel Richie (though he’s not actually on the programme, so I’m wondering if I imagined that or if he replaced someone else (like Gary Barlow replaced him at the BBC gig in Hyde Park that I missed last summer). I also have a vague recollection of Five performing with Queen – mostly cos I liked Five :P. The thing is, I saw some seriously cool acts that day. Perhaps some of them weren’t as famous then as they are now, but even so. Amongst others, assuming the programme is correct, I saw: Bon Jovi, Bryan Adams, All Saints, Christina Aguilera (I think I actually remember her singing Genie in A Bottle), Elton John with the Backstreet Boys (man I wish I remembered that!), Kylie, Destiny’s Child (when there were still four of them!), Craig David, Steps, Westlife and Billie Piper!\n\nI guess the most melancholy (at least based on programme findings plus the fact I was looking through the glossy brochure too and sulking about not getting to see it again) was from Hair in the West End. For some stupid reason I only bought the one, back when I first saw it and Will Swenson was still playing Berger. I did get Steel’s autograph and a fair chunk of the named cast, but I’m missing so many tribe members, it’s really rather sad. It was also before Liam joined the show, so he’s not in it either. I’m kicking myself now for not buying a second one later in the run and I did actually try to get my hands on one through various sources after the show closed and I realised how stupid I’d been, but nothing came of it. Such a shame :(. Still, I suppose I had an incredible summer (of love) with my beloved hippies and I’ll always have those fabulous memories plus the ones from Boston even if I don’t get another chance to see Hair again anytime soon. (I’ve also listened to the album the whole way through today, which didn’t help! – Let the sun shine in)\n\nAnd finally on a slightly chirpier note, I apparently saw Michael Barrymore as Wishee Washee in Aladdin at the Manchester Opera House all the way back in 1992 :P. I think that’s the oldest one I found, except perhaps Rainbow which I saw live on stage when I was very very small, but I don’t know what year it was.\n\nAnyhoo, in case you were wondering what that many programmes look like (or if you were wondering why it took me FIVE hours to go through them all), this is the whole lot of them:\n\nOn average I’d guestimate that there are about 20 per stack, maybe a few more. Of course there are shows I didn’t get programmes for, either because it was many years ago when £3 was just too much to spend or because they simply weren’t available. There are also shows I have several versions of; Phantom, Les Mis, etc. etc.. It’s a good collection though and I’m pretty proud of it. At least next time I lament the fact that life always seems to pass by far too quickly, I can look at this lot and think ‘Well at least I’m not wasting it’.\n\nAnyways, there were countless other names that appeared time and time again, but the above were the ones that really stood out and made me go ‘oooh, cool’. I gotta say, it’s just another reason I love theatre, following careers from the early days. I think that’s even part of the reason I’m so fond of Liam, having seen (possibly) every show he’s been in since he started out. I still see big things in his future and I love watching that ascension from nobody to universally acknowledged star. One day I’ll be watching him play some massive part *cough*Phantom*cough* and I’ll be able to look back and say ‘look how far he’s come’ and know I’ve been there since the beginning.\n\nPeace, loVe loVe and happiness,\n\nK xx\n\nPS. And now I get to do some serious tagging :P. Overkill, thy name is random posts about 2 decades of theatre trips and deciding to tag every single person/show/theatre mentioned!\n\nPPS. I have a multitude of almost finished reviews, so fingers crossed I’ll get at least some of them posted in the next few weeks.\n\nIf West End Bares has taught me anything, it’s that if I’m ever fortunate enough to get married, I DEFINITELY want a stripper at my hen-do! Tonight marked the first time I’ve ever stuffed money (admittedly fake MAD Trust money, but that’s entirely beside the point) into hot men’s underpants and it is certainly an experience I would like to repeat. One of them even blew me a kiss! I didn’t manage to get near Oliver Thornton (aka the owner of the nicest arse in Theatreland) but I still had an absolute blast. Cafe de Paris is a gorgeous venue as well and I may have to investigate the possibility of going out there one night depending on what they have on.\n\nI wasn’t really sure what to expect, but it turned out to be rather like a burlesque cabaret show with a theatresque spin. There were a variety of choreographed numbers interspersed with chatter from the presenters (the lovely Sheridan Smith and the less lovely but also less annoying than I’d expected Gok Wan) and a musical performance by the delectable Ramin Karimloo who sang Sex On Fire.\n\nI actually didn’t recognise most of the performers (clearly something I need to rectify ASAP) but obviously I knew Ramin and Oliver, plus there were appearances by Summer Strallen who I think is absolutely wonderful and Holly James (an ex-hippy). There was plenty of bare flesh, with many performers stripping off completely, though admittedly with carefully placed props and/or hands.\n\nOverall, it was fabulous fun. One girl (actually, I think it was her mother on her behalf!) donated £35 to snog Oliver – more than fair I thought and, let’s face it, I’d have done it too if I thought I could have actually gone through with it! As I said, I shoved about four notes into various incredibly hot men’s tight and often barely-there pants and did plenty of ogling. Needless to say I will definitely be back next year! *fans face in an attempt to cool down*. I also have a more pressing desire to go off and book tickets for Naked Boys Singing, something I’ve been meaning to do for a while.\n\nIn other news, I went to see a couple of other shows this week, but since I’m so behind I’ll just add them here. First off was Top Girls at Trafalgar Studios, which was a complete impulse decision. I’d actually intended to see Crazy For You but by the time I made it to Tkts they no longer had the tickets, so I had to choose something else. I did, however, find out from the helpful box office man that the show is moving to the West End, which means I can now wait and see it in a nice warm theatre with a roof instead.\n\nSo, I didn’t know all that much about Top Girls, which turned out to be a bit of a shame. The first act was what appealed to me when I read the blurb; a dinner party for women from across the ages, but the second and third acts were more gritty drama and far less up my street. Both parts of the story are centred around Marlene and the play begins with her celebrating her promotion before moving to focus on her family. I enjoyed it to a point, but I found that a lot of the dialogue involved people speaking over each other and at times I found it very difficult to follow. Not one of my best impulse decisions, but I’m not sure I had many other alternatives really and it was better than a night at home.\n\nAll of that said, the cast were superb. Suranne Jones played Marlene, the lead and the only person to play a single character. I thought she was absolutely brilliant (and have finally managed to work out where I recognise her from – she played the TARDIS in an episode of Dr Who). I also enjoyed Lisa Kerr as Kit and Olivia Poulet as Angie, though they both played other parts as well. They were incredibly believable as the young characters they were playing. Lucy Briers as Pope Joan was another impressive performance and finally, props to Stella Gonet as Joyce.\n\nI felt a bit funny going to the stage door afterwards, mostly in case I bumped into Stevie Webb, since I wouldn’t have been there to see him. Presumably he wouldn’t have recognised me anyway, but I think I might have just missed him. Either way, it wasn’t a problem and I managed to get autographs off of most of the cast and was on my way home fifteen minutes after leaving the theatre – not bad going really!\n\nAnyhoo, I also went to the Bete Noire cabaret at Madame Jojo’s, which was good fun (and probably put me even more in the mood for tonight’s spectacle). There were a variety of acts, some better than others, but particular favourites were the compare, Ophelia Bitz, Abigail something or other, a comedian, and Piff the Magic Dragon who was part comedian, part magician and very entertaining. My absolute favourite act of the night, however, was Matt Hennem, a juggler who did a routine with one of those large crystal balls. I’ve seen street performers doing that sort of thing before, but this was something else. I think my jaw actually dropped a few times it was so well done. Unfortunately, I wasn’t overly impressed with the burlesque dancer, but I think I’ve been spoiled by some of the girls I saw in Edinburgh who were spectacular.\n\nIt was a bit different to what I usually go for, but it only cost £5 thanks to an offer from Time Out and I’m glad I went (even if it then cost me another fiver for ONE bottle of Corona substitute – I remember when that was 99p on Monday’s in Lloyds on Broadstreet in Brummieland. Admittedly it was seven years ago and in Birmingham, but still!). It was also rather nice spending an evening with my baby sister before she goes off to university (ok, so she’s not exactly a baby anymore… *sob*).\n\nSo plenty of bare flesh in the last few days, but back to normal this week with a bit of straight theatre and a fringe musical… bit of a shame really!\n\nAnyhoo, until next time…\n\nPeace, loVe loVe and happiness,\n\nK xx\n\nIt’s official. Oliver Thornton has the nicest arse in Theatre Land, possibly the world.\n\nSo, Priscilla, Queen of the Desert at the Palace Theatre (incidentally, not only did I work directly opposite for several months early last year (I could even see into the wig room when they left the window open), it’s also one of the most stunningly ornate theatres that I’ve ever visited)… I’m not even sure where to start. It was absolutely spectacular in every way and I loved it. I saw the film a few months ago and really enjoyed it; the cheese, the glitz, the glam, it’s simply fabulous, darling. The show is everything the film is and more.\n\nThe costumes were brilliant (the kind I’d love to try designing), with a mix of old favourites from the film and sparkly new numbers. The sets were reasonably understated, as one would expect given that the majority of the show takes place in the outback, which just added to the effect of the costumes. Though Priscilla herself, was perfectly OTT, of course. As for the music, it was pure unadulterated cheese and almost every song had me wanting to jump up and dance.\n\nThe cast were top notch. I saw the understudy for Bernadette which I didn’t realise until I asked for Don Gallagher at the stage door (nice and embarrassing, of course), and I have to admit I wasn’t overly impressed. I’m not sure which understudy I saw, and he was good, he just wasn’t as fabulous as the rest of them. Ben Richards, by contrast, well deserved the part of Tick/Mitzi. His voice is lovely, his body is luscious and his acting was totally believable. I’ll admit I wasn’t overly excited about the prospect of seeing Ray Meagher as Bob, having only ever had a brief fling with Home & Away in my youth (back in the Vinnie and Justine days), but he played the role well, so fair play to him.\n\nAnd then there was Adam/Felicia, played by Oliver Thornton, who deserves a paragraph all to himself. I’ll admit I was a little biased towards him before the show even started, but I could barely take my eyes off of him whenever he so much as set a stiletto clad foot on the stage. His acting was wonderful, making me laugh out loud and nearly bringing me to tears at all the right moments. His voice is lovely and then there’s his body… His legs are just… And his chest… And never mind the fact that facially he’s absolutely beautiful… And then there’s his arse… Dear G-d that tuchus is perfectly formed. I could probably write a whole post just raving about it. I won’t, but I could. Anyways, I laughed when someone tweeted Oliver to say that their West End Bares calendar was going to get stuck on February (Oliver’s month), but I think mine actually will!\n\nMoving on, however, well, sort of… My favourite scene had to be the one where Adam gets all dolled up and drugged up before almost getting beaten up by a gang. I can’t say I was expecting it to be my favourite scene, but it started with Oliver in a pink sparkly thong (and matching bra), rolling on his hold-ups and ended with him all emotional and vulnerable. Then there was the bit in between, featuring a weird seductiveness that was pure sex no matter how off his head he was acting. I think my tongue may have actually fallen out of my mouth when he showed off his arse in that thong, though. I mean, DAMN!\n\nOther than the sexy Oliver scenes (don’t even get me started on the bondage gear in his opening number), I really enjoyed the interplay between the three main characters, particularly when they were on the bus. The big dance numbers were also great, particularly as they had such a talented cast. And of course, I loved the big shoe on top of the bus with the blaring opera music and not just because it was Oliver in skin tight glitter (though of course, that helped).\n\nSo, needless to say; I loved it, now have a desperate urge to glam it up and go dancing (which I shall unfortunately have to suppress for the moment), will definitely see it on Broadway so long as I get the chance to see it with the delectable Will Swenson and have officially added Oliver ‘Sex on a Stick’ Thornton to the ‘To Stalk’ list.\n\nAnyways, Love Never Dies on Thursday, which probably won’t get a proper review as I’ve already done it to death, but I’m sure I’ll be back between now and the Flamenco show I impulsively booked for next week at the Peacock Theatre (I missed the one I went to in Edinburgh as I somehow managed to fall asleep in the middle of it (no, I don’t know how that happened), so I thought I’d have another go).\n\nSo until then, keep it glitzy,\n\nK xx"
