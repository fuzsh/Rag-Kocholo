        "text": "Noble Marine Marlow Ropes RS200 National Championship at Mount's Bay Sailing Club - Day 3\n\nby Lorna Glen 7 Aug 13:45 PDT\n\nDay 3 of the Noble Marine Marlow Ropes RS200 UK Nationals started with conditions of similar strength & direction to the previous day but without the sunshine.\n\nThe first beat of the first race started with the left looking good, Tom Goodey and Richard Thomas capitalised on this. However, a huge right shift towards the top third of the beat saw those who had dug in to the right towards the mount looking golden. Rob Henderson and Alex Warren (who went right from the start) rounded first, followed by Ed and Thomas Whitehead, then Andrew and Jill Peters.\n\nGoing downwind, the pressure was still in the same area of the course, hence the left paying, Rob and Alex lead the way, Ed and Thomas still in 2nd, then Ben Whaley and Lorna Glen. The front pack of 4 stayed much the same as a game of 'protect what you have' seemed the game plan for the next 2 legs. In the end Ed and Thomas took their 3rd win of the week, followed by Ben and Lorna, then Rob and Alex taking 3rd.\n\nBetween races there was a slight pause to proceedings as the wind shifted further round to the west. Whilst the race team were busy moving the windward and gate marks, the fleet were entertained by an RAF Hercules flyover. Banking around the mount & over the fleet - not something you see everyday!\n\nRace 2 had James and Daniel Whitehead as pathfinder, they headed far right when much of the fleet went for the left. However, being completely honest, my attention was focused on the 5 dolphins swimming around our bow. I had never seen a dolphin before (apologies to Ben & the boats around us as I was screaming with excitement). Mounts Bay has truly delivered some spectacles this week. Around the windward mark attention did have to return to the racing, as there were a number of boats coming in on the port lay.\n\nOllie Evans and Zoe Nieven led at the first mark, followed by Jeremy and Becca Stephens, then Owen Bowerman and Annabelle Orme also looking good coming in from the left. With so many boats coming in from the port lay there are a number of protests so results may change. The next 2 legs saw a decrease in wind, it was a case of finding the gusts and playing the shifts. Ben and Lorna did this and took the lead, closely followed by Jeremy and Becca Stephens. Left paid on the final downwind with more pressure at the bottom of the course. Ed and Thomas gained but couldn't catch the front two boats, so stayed behind Jeremy and Becca in 2nd with Ben and Lorna finding some nice waves to extend their lead by the finish.\n\nTonight sees the big Wild West themed fancy dress party with band & chilli. We expect to see lots of cowboys and cowgirls, cacti, horses and more.\n\nResults after Day 3:"
