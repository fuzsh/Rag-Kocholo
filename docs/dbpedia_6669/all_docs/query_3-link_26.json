        "text": "by Steven Lipman\n\nIf you’re one of the up-and-coming songbirds of the world, you may be asking yourself, “What is the best school at which to study voice?”\n\nFor singers, studying vocal performance in college is the chance to develop both a larger “vocabulary” if you will, and a more practiced technique. And for many, their vocal performance program of choice is where passionate singers discover their voice. Surrounded by other serious, like-minded, and complimentary musicians – both vocal majors and otherwise – you can find lasting and valuable inspiration.\n\nBut let’s face it. You’re a creative person who needs the right environment to flourish. With enough hard work and fortitude there’s no doubt you can make the most of a vocal performance program anywhere. You can even strive for the “best” music school, but you’ll never have the same experience as attending the “right” school for you.\n\nAnd the right school – or a selection of top schools – for you will have specific criteria for auditions, portfolios, and experience. Some schools are more rigorous and disciplined, while others offer experimental paths to explore your creativity. You might also want to know whether your favorite singer or composer is an alumni of one of your top choices, which you might find out below.\n\nInside Music Schools has put together a list of the top 32 vocal performance bachelors programs to shed some light and offer guidance. For singers, preparing for the next step to serious vocal study is crucial, and that’s where we can help.\n\nWe are educators who know music schools inside and out. Informed by over 40 years of experience in music school admissions, we offer students audition preparation, portfolio development, and a personalized list of schools to submit applications to based on your career goals and creative aspirations.\n\nIf you want some quick facts on schools you may already have in mind, take a look at this list. You’ll find some information about the school and program, top faculty, and notable alumni. Looking forward to hearing from you!\n\nCLASSICAL / OPERA VOICE PROGRAMS:\n\n1.
