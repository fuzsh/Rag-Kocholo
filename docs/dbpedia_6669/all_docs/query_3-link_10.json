A humorous tribute to various B movies associated with the science fiction and horror genres from the 1930s to the early 1960s, the musical tells the story of a newly engaged couple getting caught in a storm and coming to the home of a mad transvestite scientist, Dr Frank-N-Furter, unveiling his new creation, Rocky, a sort of Frankenstein-style monster in the form of an artificially made, fully grown, physically perfect muscle man complete \"with blond hair and a tan\".\n\nThe show was produced and directed by Jim Sharman. The original London production of the musical was premièred at the Royal Court Theatre (Upstairs) on 19 June 1973 (after two previews on 16 and 18 June 1973). It later moved to several other locations in London and closed on 13 September 1980. The show ran for a total of 2,960 performances and won the 1973 Evening Standard Theatre Award for Best Musical. Songs in the musical include \"Time Warp\" (co-written by O'Brien and Richard Hartley), while the costumes were designed by Sue Blane. Its 1974 debut in the US in Los Angeles had a successful nine-month run, but its 1975 Broadway debut at the Belasco Theatre lasted only three previews and forty-five showings, despite earning one Tony nomination and three Drama Desk nominations. Various international productions have since spanned across six continents as well as West End and Broadway revivals and eight UK tours. In 1991 it was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Musical Revival. Actor Tim Curry, who originated the role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter in the original London production, became particularly associated with the musical.\n\nThe musical was adapted into the 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show, starring O'Brien as Riff Raff, with Curry also reprising his role; the film has the longest-running release in film history. In 2016, it was adapted into the television film The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's Do the Time Warp Again. The musical was ranked eighth in a BBC Radio 2 listener poll of the \"Nation's Number One Essential Musicals\", and it featured on a commemorative stamp issued by the Royal Mail in 2011.\n\nBeyond its cult status, The Rocky Horror Show is also widely said to have been an influence on countercultural and sexual liberation movements that followed on from the 1960s. It was one of the first popular musicals to depict fluid sexuality during a time of division between generations and a lack of sexual difference acceptance. Like the film adaptation, the musical is noted for a long-running tradition of audience participation through call-back lines and attending dressed up as characters from the show.[1] On the 50th anniversary of the musical in 2023, BBC News states that since debuting in London in 1973 the \"production has been performed in 20 different languages\" and been \"seen by 30 million people globally\".[1]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nAs an out-of-work actor in London in the early 1970s, Richard O'Brien wrote The Rocky Horror Show to keep himself busy on winter evenings. Since his youth, he had developed a passion for science fiction and B horror movies; he wanted to combine elements of the unintentional humour of B horror movies, portentous dialogue of schlock-horror, Steve Reeves muscle films, and fifties rock and roll into The Rocky Horror Show.[2] A major theme running throughout the musical is transvestism, which according to O'Brien was not originally meant to be as prominent as it ended up being. He conceived and wrote the play set against the backdrop of the glam era that had manifested itself throughout British popular culture in the early 1970s;[3] he has stated \"glam rock allowed me to be myself more\", allowing his concept to come into being.[4]\n\nO'Brien took a small amount of his unfinished Rocky Horror to Australian director Jim Sharman, who decided he wanted to direct it at the small experimental space Upstairs at the Royal Court Theatre in Sloane Square, Chelsea, London, which was used as a project space for new work.[5] Sharman had received considerable local acclaim as the director of the original Australian productions of Hair and Jesus Christ Superstar. He went to London to direct the first British stage production of Superstar, during which he met O'Brien, who had played King Herod for just one performance. Sharman brought fellow Australians Nell Campbell and long-time scenic designer partner Brian Thomson into the production.\n\nStar Tim Curry recalled his first encounter with the script:\n\nI'd heard about the play because I lived on Paddington Street, off Baker Street, and there was an old gym a few doors away. I saw Richard O'Brien in the street, and he said he'd just been to the gym to see if he could find a muscleman who could sing. I said, \"Why do you need him to sing?\" [laughs] And he told me that his musical was going to be done, and I should talk to Jim Sharman. He gave me the script, and I thought, \"Boy, if this works, it's going to be a smash.\"[6]\n\nThe original creative team was then rounded out by costume designer Sue Blane[7] and musical director Richard Hartley, although Pete Moss would later take over as musical director. Michael White was also brought in to produce Rocky Horror. As the musical went into rehearsal, the working title for it became They Came from Denton High, but it was changed just before previews at the suggestion of Sharman to The Rocky Horror Show.[5][8]\n\nAfter two previews, the show was premièred—without an interval—at the Royal Court's 63-seat Theatre Upstairs on 19 June 1973, and ran until 20 July 1973.[9][10] The cast included Tim Curry, who had decided that Dr Frank-N-Furter should not just be a queen, he should speak like the Queen of the United Kingdom, extravagantly posh,[4] Patricia Quinn, Nell Campbell (billed as Little Nell), Julie Covington, Christopher Malcolm (who would subsequently be the originator of the revival and tours in the 1990's) and O'Brien, with each performing in an all-out camp style.[11][12][13] It was a creative triumph and a critical and commercial success.[14] A reviewer at the premiere for The Guardian wrote \"it achieves the rare feat of being witty and erotic at the same time\", and Curry gives a \"garishly Bowiesque performance as the ambisextrous doctor.\"[9] Record producer Jonathan King saw it on the second night and signed the cast to make the original cast recording over a long weekend—The Rocky Horror Show Original London Cast—that was rushed out on his UK Records label.[15][16] King was involved heavily in the initial promotion for the show, as well as being the minority backer of it financially with White having a majority share.[16][17]\n\nThe impact at the Royal Court Upstairs allowed the production be transferred to the 230-seat Chelsea Classic Cinema nearby on Kings Road from 14 August 1973 to 20 October 1973.[18] Rocky Horror found a quasi-permanent home at the 500-seat King's Road Theatre—another cinema house, even further down Kings Road—from 3 November 1973. The show received critical praise and won the 1973 Evening Standard Award for Best Musical. When Richard O'Brien played Riff Raff in the original Broadway production of Rocky Horror in 1975 Robert Longden took over the role in London.\n\nThe show's run at the King's Road Theatre ended on 31 March 1979; it then transferred to the Comedy Theatre (now the Harold Pinter Theatre) to begin performances on 6 April 1979. At the new venue, Rocky Horror required some restaging, for the Comedy was the first theatre at which the musical had played that possessed a traditional proscenium arch stage. For the first time, the musical was also broken into two acts with an interval. It finished its run there on 13 September 1980.\n\nSynopsis\n\n[edit]\n\nAct I\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Usherette, sometimes referred to as \"Trixie\", who works in a derelict cinema, introduces tonight's \"film\" in a song (\"Science Fiction/Double Feature\"), with masked Phantoms providing the backing vocals.\n\nAfter attending the wedding of his best friend since high school (Ralph Hapschatt, now married to Janet Weiss' friend Betty Munroe), Brad Majors confesses his love to Janet Weiss (\"Dammit Janet\") and the two become engaged. The Narrator appears and explains that Brad and Janet are leaving Denton to visit Dr. Everett Scott, their former science tutor, while driving into a rainstorm. During the trip, their car has a flat tire and they are forced to walk through the rain to seek a telephone in an old castle (\"Over at the Frankenstein Place\").\n\nThe Narrator explains that Brad and Janet are feeling \"apprehensive and uneasy\", but must accept any help that they are offered. As Brad and Janet arrive, Riff Raff, the hunchbacked handyman and live-in butler, greets them, and his sister Magenta, the maid, appears. Riff Raff, Magenta and Columbia (a groupie) speak briefly of an unlucky delivery boy named Eddie who fell victim to unfortunate circumstances because he botched a delivery, before performing the show's signature dance number (\"Time Warp\"). Brad and Janet try to leave at this point, but are stopped when Dr Frank-N-Furter, a pansexual, cross-dressing mad scientist, arrives. He introduces himself as \"a sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania\" and invites Brad and Janet up to his laboratory (\"Sweet Transvestite\"). As he goes up, Brad and Janet are stripped to their underwear to dry off.\n\nBrad and Janet enter the laboratory, where Frank-N-Furter gives them laboratory coats to wear. Frank announces that he has discovered the secret to life itself. He unveils his creation, a blond, well-built man named Rocky, who is brought to life. As his bandages are removed, Rocky worries about his predicament (\"The Sword of Damocles\"). Frank admires Rocky's physique by singing a tribute to muscle builders (\"Charles Atlas Song\"/\"I Can Make You a Man\"). A Coca-Cola freezer in the laboratory opens to reveal Frank and Columbia's former lover, Eddie, a biker covered in surgical scars, who has been rendered a (slightly more) brain-damaged zombie, intent on rescuing Columbia, and escaping the castle while successfully causing large amounts of damage to Frank's laboratory, exhibiting signs of partially returning memory of the way he lived life in the past (\"Hot Patootie – Bless My Soul\"). Frank panics, forces Eddie back into the freezer and hacks him to death (his weapon of choice typically being a pick axe or chainsaw). Frank tells Rocky — the recipient of the other half of Eddie's brain — that he prefers him over Eddie (\"Charles Atlas Song (Reprise)\"/\"I Can Make You a Man (Reprise)\"), as although he and Eddie had a strong mental relationship, he had no muscle, and therefore, had to go. Brad and Janet, somewhat flustered after witnessing the re-murdering of Eddie, are then ushered to separate bedrooms for the night.\n\nAct II\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Narrator foreshadows that Brad and Janet may be unsafe. Janet enjoys Brad's advances in her darkened bedroom before realizing that it is Frank in disguise. He convinces Janet that pleasure is no crime, and after she asks him to promise not to tell Brad, they resume their lovemaking. The scene changes to Brad's darkened bedroom, where Brad makes love to Janet before discovering that, once again, it is Frank in disguise. Frank promises not to tell Janet, but as they resume, Riff Raff interrupts on the television monitor with the message that Rocky has escaped. Janet searches for Brad in the laboratory and discovers Rocky hiding there. Checking the television monitor, Janet sees Brad in bed with Frank and seduces Rocky (\"Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me\"). While searching the television monitor for Rocky, the rest of the group discovers that Janet has slept with him and Brad becomes hurt and angry (\"Once in a While\"). Riff Raff then notifies Frank that there is another visitor entering the castle: Dr. Everett Scott, the paraplegic science tutor whom Brad and Janet intended to visit.\n\nDr. Scott in a wheelchair is wheeled into the laboratory by Columbia, where Frank accuses him and Brad of trying to investigate his castle, knowing that Dr. Scott has connections with the FBI. Dr Scott assures him that he has come in search of Eddie, who is revealed to be his nephew (\"Eddie's Teddy\"). Frank displays Eddie's corpse to the group and then uses a device to electronically restrain the three visitors and a rebellious Rocky to the floor (\"Planet Schmanet Janet\"); the inhabitants of the castle are revealed to be space aliens led by Frank, who abandoned their original mission in order to engage in kinky sex with Earthlings and work on Rocky. Magenta insists that they return to their home planet now that they have been found out; Frank refuses and, instead, declares his intentions to put on a \"floor show\".\n\nUnder Frank's influence, Columbia, Rocky, Brad, and Janet perform song and dance routines while clad in lingerie (\"Rose Tint My World (Floor Show)\"). After, Frank entices them to lose all inhibition and give in to their natural carnal instincts, resulting in everyone beginning to engage in orgiastic sex (\"Don't Dream It – Be It\") before Frank leads them into the rousing concluding number of the floor show (\"Wild and Untamed Thing\"). The show comes to an abrupt end when Riff Raff and Magenta enter, wearing spacesuits and carrying ray guns. Riff Raff declares that he is usurping Frank's authority and taking them all back to their home planet (\"Transit Beam\"). Frank makes a final plea for sympathy from Riff Raff, trying to make him understand his desire to spend the rest of his life having sex with Earthlings (\"I'm Going Home\"). Riff Raff is unmoved and guns down Columbia, Frank, and Rocky before ordering Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott to leave.\n\nAs the trio evacuates the castle, Riff Raff and Magenta express their excitement to return to their world and do the \"Time Warp\" again with their fellow Transylvanians (\"Spaceship\"). Brad and Janet watch as the castle blasts off into outer space, confused about the implications of their sexual escapades (\"Super Heroes\"). To conclude his tale, the Narrator says \"and crawling on the planet's face, insects called the human race, lost in time, and lost in space – and meaning.\" As the show ends, The Usherette returns to recount the night's events (\"Science Fiction/Double Feature (Reprise)\").\n\nIn the original London and Los Angeles productions, \"Sweet Transvestite\" came before \"Time Warp\". This was changed for the film version and was subsequently updated for the stage version when O'Brien revised the script for the 1990 West End revival.\n\n\"Charles Atlas Song\" was replaced by a reworked version of the song, \"I Can Make You a Man\", for the film version. O'Brien's revision of the script in 1990 featured a hybrid of the two songs under the title \"I Can Make You a Man\", in the 1999 revised script this song was replaced by the film version, which continues to be used in all major productions. The reprise remains unchanged except for the title.\n\nOther productions\n\n[edit]\n\nOriginal Los Angeles production (American premiere)\n\n[edit]\n\nLou Adler had made millions with risky ventures such as Monterey Pop. His record label, Ode Records, was becoming known for harvesting experimental talent.[19] In the late winter of 1973, Adler was in London and attended a performance of the show with Britt Ekland. Acting on impulse and seeing a hit, he met backstage with producers and within 36 hours had secured the American theatrical rights.[20]\n\nThe show premiered at the Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles on 24 March 1974, running for nine months.[21] The cast was all new except for Tim Curry.[22] The rest of the cast consisted of Abigail Haness as Janet, Bill Miller as Brad, Bruce Scott as Riff-Raff, Jamie Donnelly as Magenta/Trixie, Boni Enten as Columbia, Meat Loaf as Eddie/Dr. Scott, Kim Milford as Rocky Horror, and Graham Jarvis as the Narrator. Paul Jabara played Dr. Frank-N-Furter when Curry left to film the movie.\n\nThe show played to a full house and a deal was made with 20th Century Fox for a film.[23] Fox executive Gordon Stulberg saw the show at the Roxy and agreed to invest $1 million in the film project.[24] Adler's attempt to turn his club into a playhouse was successful. Meat Loaf remembered different celebrities who would come to the show, resulting in him meeting Elvis Presley at a performance.[20]\n\nOriginal Sydney production (Australian premiere)\n\n[edit]\n\nHarry M. Miller produced the original Sydney production of Rocky Horror, which opened on 19 April 1974 at the New Arts Cinema (formerly The Astor, later The Valhalla and now an office building) in Glebe. It starred Reg Livermore as Frank-N-Furter, Jane Harders as Janet Weiss, Kate Fitzpatrick as Usherette and Magenta, Arthur Dignam as Narrator, Sal Sharah as Riff-Raff, John Paramor as Brad Majors, Graham Matters as Rocky, Maureen Elkner as Columbia, David Cameron as Eddie and Dr. Scott with Bob Hudson and Piero Von Arnam and Julie McGregor.\n\nOriginal Melbourne/Adelaide production\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter eighteen-month run in Sydney, Harry M. Miller's production moved to Melbourne, with Max Phipps taking over the star role. It opened at the Regent Palace Theatre on 24 October 1975 and ran through 19 months and 458 performances, finally closing on 28 May 1977.[25]\n\nThe Melbourne production included Max Phipps - Frank-N-Furter; Gregory Apps - Brad (later Stephen Clark); Paula Maxwell - Janet (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Diana Greentree); Tommy Dysart - narrator; Sal Sharah - Riff-Raff; Robyn Moase - Magenta (later Joan Brockenshire); Sue Smithers - Columbia (later Shirley-Anne Kear, Joan Millar); Graham Matters - Rocky (later Grant Whiteman, Clive Blackie); Terry Bader - Eddie/Dr Scott (later David Cameron, William Gluth).[26] When Paula Maxwell left, resident stage director, Roland Rocchiccioli, moved Kear (at her request) into the role of Janet, and Joan Miller, who was an understudy, took over from Kear as Columbia. It was in Melbourne, during the Sword of Damocles number, that Grant Whiteman fell while swinging on ladder and being pursued by Max Phipps. Fortunately, there was a Doctor in the house. Without missing a beat, Rocchiccioli told Clive Blackie to get into the costume: \"This is your big chance. You're on!\" he said. The show picked up from where Whiteman had fallen and went-on without further hitch. Soon after that Whiteman left, and, to Blackie's surprise, Rocchiccioli put him into the role - without hesitation. He said to him: \"You're the understudy. Of course you take over. That's what you're here for!\" He proved a very popular Rocky. What he lacked in height he made-up for in muscle. The show then transferred to Adelaide, where it opened on 12 August 1977 at The Warner Theatre. Max Phipps, Diana Greentree, Joan Millar, Tommy Dysart and Joan Brockenshire went on to reprise their roles from the Melbourne production. Staged by Roland Rocchiccioli, the Adelaide production – which was a transfer of Jim Sharman's original Sydney and Melbourne productions, and adapted for the new theatre, was not a success, and closed after only two months. As Rocchiccioli said on ABC Television in Adelaide, talking with Clive Hale: \"It is the same Jim Sharman production as Melbourne. It is Brian Thomson's design, except the set has been altered slightly because this is not a television theatre in the last days of its existence!\" Rocchiccioli later said he was astonished that it did not work in Adelaide after playing in Melbourne for the two years previous. Some weeks the company did ten performances, so great was the demand for tickets. It would have gone on running - possibly for another year - if Max Phipps had not decided to leave. He was exhausted. In the final months Harry M. Miller was selling standing-room at the back of the theatre for up to 50-patrons per performance.\n\nAfter several weeks in Adelaide, Jon Finlayson replaced Max Phipps as Frank-N-Furter. Max had come-in to the production at the last moment, after Darrell Hilton and Rocchiccioli agreed on a parting of the ways, just days before the opening night. Other cast members included Tony Preece as Brad; Keith Reid (who was the Melbourne understudy) as Riff-Raff; Bill Binks as Eddie/Dr. Scott; and Shane Bourne as Rocky. The Adelaide reviews were savage, and killed the production. Everyone was taken by surprise, including Max Phipps, who was brilliant in the role. Rocchiccioli said at the time: \"It's baffling. Nothing has changed from Melbourne, and it's difficult to know why they hate it so much\". It is the only time the Rocky Horror Show has not been critically applauded in Australia.[26][27] The show closed after two months, after running from 12 August to October 1977.[28]\n\nOriginal New York City (Broadway) production\n\n[edit]\n\nIn early 1975, Adler closed the show at the Roxy Theatre after a ten-month run. This gave actors time to return to the UK for the film version's shooting. Adler planned to open on Broadway just before the film's release. It was anticipated that this production would be as successful as Jesus Christ Superstar and serve as a public vehicle for the film version.[29] It was unsuccessful and closed after 45 performances.[30] The cast was identical to that of the Roxy cast but with O'Brien in place of Scott as Riff-Raff.\n\nOriginal San Francisco production\n\n[edit]\n\nThe third U.S. production opened at the Montgomery Playhouse[31] in San Francisco on 3 February 1976[32][33][34] and played 103 performances, closing on 30 May.[35] The San Francisco production was directed by A. Michael Amarino,[33] with musical direction and arrangements by Michael Reno.[33][36] The production had a new cast and starred David James as Frank.[36][33] The opening night cast included Roslyn Roseman as Trixie/Usherette/Magenta, Needa Greene as Janet, Robert Reynolds as Brad, Richard Gee as the Narrator, Buddy King as Riff Raff, Paula Desmond as Columbia, Bob Dulaney as Rocky, and Emil Borelli as Eddie/Dr Scott, with back-up vocals by Vikki D'Orazi, William J. Tacke, and Kelly St. John.[32][33]\n\nSecond London (West End) production\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Rocky Horror Show transferred to the 820-seat Comedy Theatre on Panton Street in the West End, running from 6 April 1979 until 13 September 1980, closing the play's initial run of 2,960 performances. After occasional productions in the early 1980s, the play was revived for the Theatre Royal, Hanley tour in 1984 and still is performed regularly in the UK.[37]\n\nThe Haymarket Production, Leicester\n\n[edit]\n\nOn Wednesday 8 August 1979 The Haymarket Production of The Rocky Horror Show, presented in association with Cameron Mackintosh and Michael White, began a month-long run at the Leicester Haymarket Theatre.[38] After its Haymarket run followed a major national tour to Wolverhampton, Norwich, Leeds, Bristol, Newcastle, Birmingham, Brighton, York, Lincoln, Southsea, Oxford, and ending at Cork, Ireland in December 1979.[39]\n\nThe lead part of Frank-N-Furter was played by Daniel Abineri.

The cast included Terry O'Connell as Frank-N-Furter (reprising his role from the 1978 production), Annie Stanford as Janet, Paul Minifie as The Narrator, Bob Baines (another former member of the 1978 production) as Riff Raff, and Wayne Pygram as Rocky Horror.[47]\n\n1981-1982 Tour\n\n[edit]\n\nWilton Morley's new production of The Rocky Horror Show opened 6 October 1981 at the Theatre Royal, Sydney.

Although Abineri did play the role for the majority of the run, at the beginning of the tour Garry Scale took the lead.[52] Later, at the Rialto Theatre in Brisbane, set designer Geoff Bieleseld [53] used different stage levels to give the impression of space, which was an adaptation based on original designs by Brian Thomson. In Brisbane and Sydney Reg Livermore, the show's original Frank-N-Furter, was cast in the same role.[54]\n\nThe cast featured Anne Looby as Janet Weiss, David Garrett as Brad Majors (later Graeme McKeachie during the Brisbane/Sydney seasons), David Wheeler as Riff Raff, Suzanne Dudley as Magenta/Usherette (later Nataly Mosco during the Brisbane/Sydney seasons), Jill Watt as Columbia (later Cassandra Webb, Gina Mendoza), Wayne Pygram as Eddie/Dr. Scott, Ray Coughlin as Rocky Horror, and Stuart Wagstaff as Narrator (early in the tour David Clendinning).[52][55]\n\n1985 Rural Tour\n\n[edit]\n\nPeter Batey directed the new all-star revival-production, which starred Joe Daniels in the central role of Frank-N-Furter. The show was mounted for limited engagements from August till November 1985 in Townsville, Cairns, Mount Isa, Mackay, Gladstone, Rockhampton, Tweed Heads, Newcastle, Burnie, Launceston, Hobart, Canberra, Wagga Wagga, Albury, Wangaratta, Shepparton, Warragul, and Ballarat.[56][48]\n\nThe production boasted a cast of popular music and television stars, such as Somebody's Image vocalist Russell Morris as Riff Raff, soap stars Maria Mercedes as Magenta, Ken James as Brad and Victoria Nicolls as Janet, singer-songwriter Glenn Shorrock as Eddie/Dr. Scott, Margaret Coyne as Columbia and Matthew Watters as Rocky.[57]\n\n1986–1988 Australasia Tour\n\n[edit]\n\nMorley's production was re-launched yet again in 1986, with Daniel Abineri both as director and in the lead role of Frank-N-Furter. This time the tour commenced in New Zealand, where its cast included local actors Andrew Binns as Brad, Ann Wilson as Janet, Andrea Cunningham as Magenta/Usherette, Rachel King as Columbia and Russell Crowe as Eddie/Dr. Scott. For a brief stint, former New Zealand Prime Minister Robert Muldoon appeared as the Narrator.\n\nThe following year, the production transferred to the Princess Theatre (and later the Comedy Theatre) in Melbourne, Australia for an eight-month run, and toured Australia for several years visiting Sydney, Perth, Tweed Heads, Brisbane (where it was staged as part of the World Expo 88), Parramatta, Newcastle and Canberra.\n\nThe cast featured Daniel Abineri as Frank-N-Furter, Megan Shapcott as Janet Weiss, Simon Westaway as Brad Majors, David Wheeler as Riff Raff, Lyn Shakespeare as Magenta/Usherette, Michelle Argue as Columbia (later Gina Mendoza), Steve Bastoni as Rocky Horror, and The Narrator variously was played by Gordon Chater, Stuart Wagstaff and others.[58]\n\nBy the time the tour reached Brisbane, Daniel Abineri had retired as director and star and – based on Abineri's original production, Wilton Morley took over duties, with Simon Westaway (who had played previously Brad in the Australian tour) as Frank-N-Furter. Other cast changes included: Ann Wilson and Andrew Binns as Janet and Brad (reprising their roles from the New Zealand tour), Bob Baines (and later Greg Parke) as Riff Raff, Luz Yeomans as Magenta/Usherette, Walter Grkovic as Eddie /Dr. Scott, Anthony Russell as Rocky Horror, and Bernard King as Narrator.[59]\n\nThe production ended with a second New Zealand tour, which was directed by Terry O'Connell (late of the Riverina Trucking Company productions) with Simon Westaway as Frank-N-Furter. The rest of the cast mainly comprised New Zealand talent, including actor/director John Banas and comedian Billy T. James alternating as the Narrator. The tour visited Wellington, Auckland, Palmerston North, Christchurch, Dunedin and officially came to an end in December 1988.\n\nIt has been noted for being the last production based on the original show's script and set design, before readaptation for the 1990 UK West End revival.\n\n1992 Tour\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1992, a revival production was launched by producer Paul Dainty under the title The New Rocky Horror Show.

Production by Jean-Pierre Reyes in association with Michael White. Original text and music booklet by Richard O'Brien; adapted into French by Javier Arroyuelo and Rafael Lopez Sanchez, the song's lyrics were translated by Alain Boublil; directed by Pierre Spivakoff; sets and costumes by Elisabeth Saurel and choreography by Victor Upshaw.\n\nThe cast featured Pierre Spivakoff as Dr. Frank-N-Furter, Nathalie Brehal as Janet Weiss, Roger Mirmont as Brad Majors (renamed Paul in the production), Gérard Surugue as Riff-Raff, Myriam Mézières [fr] as Magenta/The Usherette, Celia Booth as Columbia, Ticky Holgado as Eddie/Dr. Scott, Jeffrey Kime as Rocky Horror, Geoffrey Carey as The Narrator.[87]\n\nGerman productions\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1980, two different interpretations of the musical were staged in Germany.\n\nIn 1980 director Walter Bockmayer, released The Rocky Horror Show in Essen as a German premiere, which opened on 20 January 1980 at the Grillo-Theater. This production deviated greatly from the original London productions in regards to characterisation, costuming and set design. Instead of the morbid castle Bockmayer's extravagant design set his lustful Transylvanians in a sterile hospital on time travel.[88]\n\nFrank-N-Furter was played by the American guest star Decoven C. Washington, who thus became the first black man to embody the main antagonist.[89] The cast also featured Rotraut Rieger as Janet Weiss, Detlev Greisner as Brad Majors, Fritz Brieserheister as Riff-Raff, Jutta Bryde as Magenta, Sue Hürzeler as Columbia, Yoyo Petit as Eddie, Manfried Hilbig as Dr. Scott, Till Krabbe as Rocky Horror, Siegfried Wittig as Narrator, and Helmut Fülberth as Usherette.[90]\n\nThe second was a production imported from England by producer Cameron Mackintosh, which ran briefly in October/November. The show was supposed to have an extensive run, but a lack of co-operation from the German producers saw Mackintosh pull the show after only a few weeks.[91] Mackintosh's production primarily featured a cast of English actors, which included Jeff Shankley as Frank-N-Furter, Philip Bretherton as Brad, Perry Bedden (a cast member from the film adaptation of Rocky Horror) as Riff-Raff, Trevor Byfield as Eddie/Dr. Scott, and Nicholas Courtney as The Narrator.\n\nNorwegian production\n\n[edit]\n\nThe musical premiered on 11 October 1977 at the Oslo Nye Centralteatret in Oslo, Norway, boasting a cast of both established actors and popular names from the music industry. The production was directed by David Toguri (with assistance from Brian Thomson), while Richard O'Brien's original script was translated into Norwegian by actor Johan Fillinger and musician Ole Paus.[92] The show generated heated controversy in the press, with newspapers and commentators declaring that the show signified the decline of morality in the country. But despite the press' hostility, the show performed a total of 129 times, before officially closing 18 March 1978.\n\nThe cast featured Knut Husebø as Dr. Frank-N-Furter, Kari Ann Grønsund as Janet Weiss (renamed \"Janee\" in the production), Ivar Nørve as Brad Majors (renamed \"Jan\"), Jahn Teigen as Riff-Raff, Gro Anita Schønn as Magenta and The Usherette, Julie Ege as Columbia, Per Elvis Granberg as Eddie, Egil Åsman as Dr. Scott, Zakhir Helge Linaae as Rocky Horror, and Bjarne Bø as The Narrator.[93]\n\nSpanish productions\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first Spanish staging of the musical was performed in Madrid, Spain from September 1974 to July 1975, which was presented as \"a sexual satirical musical\" directed by Gil Carretero. The libretto was translated and adapted by Juan José Plans and Roberto Estevez, who toned down the original script's profanity an approach in response to censorship during the Franco regime.[94]\n\nThe cast featured Alfonso Nadal as Frank-N-Furter (renamed Frank-Burguesa), Flora Maria Alvaro as Janet Weiss (renamed Sibilia Cooley), Miguel Angel Godo as Brad Majors (renamed Thiero Smith), Alberto Berco as The Narrator, Pedro Mari Sanchez as Rocky Horror, Ricardo Zabala as Riff Raff, Raquel Ramirez as Columbia, Adolfo Rodriguez as Eddie/Dr. Scott and Mayra Gómez Kemp in the double role as Magenta/ Usherette.[94]\n\nThe show opened Cerebro Music Hall, playing every weeknight as an adults-only event at 11:00 pm to standing room only. Saturday nights would also include a second show that played at 1:00 am. The show received considerable media attention, due to its boundary-pushing themes being considered as a personal attack towards the Franco Regime that was ruling the country at that time.\n\nAfter completing its run at the La Discoteca Cerebro, the show reopened at the Teatro Valle-Inclán, where it played from August to October 1975.[95][96]\n\nIn 1977, a Catalan-language version of the musical directed by Ventura Pons and produced by Jordi Morell, with the slogan \"L'espectacle més desmadrat del segle\" (The most riotous show of the century), premiered on 4 March 1977 at Teatro Romea in Barcelona.

The musical was co-directed by Lee Mikeska Gardner (CST's Artistic Director) and Jo Michael Rezes for the 50th anniversary of the musical's London debut at the Royal Court Theatre's Theatre Upstairs: \"This production is attempting to get back to the roots of the radical nature of the 1973 show by giving it a 2023, 50-year anniversary twist by having five trans and non-binary actors in major roles in the production...trying to bring it back to the root of what the show was originally, as transgressive and radical and shocking.\"[112] Rezes is the first openly nonbinary director to stage Rocky Horror regionally in the United States, with their version of the show emphasizing gender rehearsal,[113] phobias of transmedicalism, and transgender representation on US stages.[114]\n\nCanadian Productions\n\n[edit]\n\n1976 Toronto\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1976, the musical, in a production by The Actors' Stage Company, received its Canadian premiere at the Ryerson Theatre in Toronto.

The libretto was translated and adapted by Jorge Mautner, Joe Rodrix and Kao Rossman, in whose hands saw a great deal of Richard O'Brien's original script adapted to suit Brazilian audiences.[119] As the Hollywood horror and sci-fi films that the musical references were not that well known in Brazil at that time, references to the local culture was instead incorporated into the show. (For example: The lyric \"What ever happened to Faye Wray\" in the floor show sequence was changed to reference popular Brazilian samba singer Carmen Miranda.)\n\nThe cast featured Eduardo Conde as Dr. Frank-N-Furter, Diana Strella as Janet Weiss, Wolf Maia as Brad Majors, Tom Zé as Riff-Raff, Betina Viany as Magenta, Vera Setta as Columbia, Zé Rodrix as Eddie and Dr. Scott, Acácio Gonçalves as Rocky Horror, Nildo Parente as The Narrator, and Lucélia Santos as Baleira (a character possibly based on The Usherette from the original show).[119]\n\n1975 Argentinian production\n\n[edit]\n\nIn July 1975, Héctor Cavallero and Leonardo Barujel staged Gil Carretero's vision of The Rocky Horror Show at Teatro Pigalle in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

A few days after the premiere, unknown assailants threw a Molotov cocktail at the theater, which aimed to cause casualties. There was a minor fire that did not damage the hall, some functions were suspended, but the show continued and ran for three months. Triple A was believed to have been responsible, employing violent tactics against suspected dissidents and subversives.[120] Due to political persecutions, frequent threats and censorship, the company was disbanded.[26]\n\n1976 Mexican production\n\n[edit]\n\nRichard O'Brien's musical first came to Mexico in 1976 through the pioneering efforts of Julissa, Mexican actress, producer and singer. \"El Show de Terror de Rocky\", premiered on 11 March in a novel concept of cabaret theater, in the Versailles hall of the now defunct Hotel of the Prado.

In his words:\n\nGuys, this sort of thing [being trans] is spreading because the parents do not hit their kids anymore. But if a father hits a LaverME [here, he makes a pun with Laverne Cox and the word \"worm\" in Portuguese], a fagot rights entity say that she is a woman trapped inside the body of a man. Well, I'm a blue-eyed blonde soul lost in a body of a bumpkin for fifty years and nobody ever defended me. Don't I have human rights? Like I said: if the father hits them, they will know it's wrong and will have sex with their guy friend from school, they will not say they are trans people, they will try to find a man to them and will stop searching for the spotlight. The spotlight is for Judy, Barbra and Rogéria [a very famous Brazilian trans actress], the rest is a bunch of junkie fagot from rave parties.[citation needed]\n\nFollowing the event, many Facebook users have expressed outrage at Botelho's claims. In his defense, the director said that the comments were nothing more than a joke and that they were taken out of context. According to him, it was just a discussion about the casting of actress Laverne Cox for the then-upcoming television film.\n\nThe production was still highly successful, especially for the large number of cosplayers who, at the end of very show, were invited to dance the \"Time Warp\" on stage with the cast.\n\nNew Zealand\n\n[edit]\n\nThe musical had its New Zealand premiere in 1978, where it went on a national tour. The cast featured controversial rocker Gary Glitter as Dr. Frank-N-Furter, Jenni Anderson as Janet Weiss, John Collingwood-Smith as Brad Majors, Sal Sharah as Riff-Raff (reprising his role from the original Australian premiere), Sharron Skelton as Magenta/Usherette, Suburban Reptiles vocalist Clare Elliott (under the stage name \"Zero\") as Columbia, Paul Johnstone (a former understudy from the original Australian premiere) as Eddie/Dr. Scott, Rayner Bourton as Rocky Horror (later Graham Matters), and Keith Richardson as The Narrator.[126]\n\nAsian productions\n\n[edit]\n\nJapanese productions\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first Japan performances of the Rocky Horror Show, presented by Walking Elephants Ltd., was scheduled from 23 June through 9 September 1975 in Tokyo and Osaka,[127] and opened at the Rocky Horror Theatre (more commonly known as the Miyakezaka Hall) in Akasaka, Tokyo.[128] Directed for Japan by Christie Dickason with an all-English cast including Trevor Byfield as Frank-N-Furter, Christopher Malcolm and Belinda Sinclair as Brad and Janet, Rayner Bourton as Rocky (reprising their roles from the original London run), and Peter Bayliss as The Narrator.

Ltd. presented an encore tour directed by David Toguri,[133] which saw the show visit 16 cities in three and a half months.
