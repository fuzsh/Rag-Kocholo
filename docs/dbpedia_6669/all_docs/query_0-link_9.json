        "text": "First of all, kudos for being one of the few people left in our business willing to have an opinion! It‚Äôs interesting that we saw the Kate Hudson performance on the Howard Stern show. Although I maintain he is still the best to ever sit behind a radio mic, now that he has essentially become accepted as a mainstream celebrity, he has gone from the ultimate example of not giving a sh*t, to often kissing the ass of his fellow celebrity club members. Now to Kate Husdon, the rock star. As an actress, she was good in Almost Famous which I attribute largely to her being quite young and Cameron Crowe doing an excellent job. But because I travel a lot, and refuse to watch good movies on crappy airplane screens, I have had the dubious pleasure of watching some of ‚ÄúBride Wars‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow to Lose a Guy in 10 Days‚Äù. It would be hard to be more annoying than she was in those films. And now she has to bring that same mediocre acting talent to music. (I can only assume that Chris Robinson feels he dodged a bullet). So for people who are exclaiming that she can sing ‚Ä¶ yes, perhaps compared to someone who is tone deaf. I have spent a career coaching and producing young singers. There is a real giveaway as to who is imitating a performance, and who is the real thing. Undeveloped singers have what I call ‚Äúvocal ticks‚Äù, little mannerisms they think sound cool but they overuse because they don‚Äôt really know what they are doing. Kate Hudson dips the pitch at the end of EVER SINGLE NOTE! Once you realize this, you can‚Äôt unhear it. Listen to a great singer like Bonnie Raitt, sometimes when it is emotionally effective, she will dip a note, but it has impact because she only does it sometimes! It is the same thing with all the ridiculous flourishes & melismas you hear on American Idol ‚Ä¶ did Aretha or Stevie do it, yes, when it counted, not constantly. That is certainly not my only complaint with the superfluous new music from yet another famous person ‚Ä¶ but it is a start.Thanks again for being willing to call this trifle out.\n\nSteve Postell\n\n___________________________________\n\nYou have truly turned into the old man yelling, ‚ÄúGet off my lawn!‚Äù Why you needed to do a hatchet job on this woman‚Äôs work is beyond me. The world you live in is one I no longer want to be a part of. Wading through your narcissistic pablum daily is a chore rather than an informative read. Please insert Lefsetz for Hudson in the sentence you wrote,‚ÄúI mean who gives a crap what Hudson has to say.‚Äù\n\nPlease take me off your list.\n\nTerry Lowe\n\n___________________________________\n\nShe has 18 million followers on instagram alone. You are getting angrier by the day. Your rants are all over the place. You keep saying nobody cares and you are right Bob nobody cares. Light one up, have a drink or get a prescription for something.\n\nRon Maiorino\n\n___________________________________\n\nWell at least she didn‚Äôt try to make a movie and a documentary with it.\n\nBrian Martin\n\n___________________________________\n\nOn celebrities or actors doing albums I‚Äôd say the end year was 2010.\n\nI signed Hugh Laurie to Warners when I ran Warner Music Entertainment. Hugh is a blues pianist and vocalist and he can really play!\n\nWe made a beautiful New Orleans inspired album ‚ÄúLet Them Talk‚Äù with Joe Henry, a PBS ‚ÄúGreat Performances‚Äù special and sold close to 2m copies globally (across that album and the follow up).\n\nBut it was a different time.\n\nTV still sold albums. Retail still sold albums.\n\nIt was the year YouTube started to really make traction with Spotify hard on its heels. Times were changing.\n\nMany, many labels copied what we‚Äôd done with Hugh in subsequent years and almost without exception they failed.\n\nNow I‚Äôm indie and running a label doing the modern equivalent. We sign artists with fan bases growing fast on socials. It‚Äôs the same thing as I did at WMG, but re-cut for the 2020s. Go where the audience is and amplify.\n\nWe do 200m streams a month and 90% of our signings are profitable.\n\n#movewiththetimes\n\nLove your work!\n\nConrad Withey\n\nCEO\n\nFRTYFVE.com\n\n___________________________________\n\nBenson Boone and Zach Bryan are two recent acts that come to mind that built completely from the ground up, created huge followings, and didn‚Äôt have leading hit singles ‚Ä¶ not saying that‚Äôs par for the course these days, but there are a few cases here and there.\n\nMichael Pukownik\n\n___________________________________\n\nWait, did you just call her an idiot? Seems a bit harsh, no? Maybe I missed context down the page. I stopped reading right there. Do better, Bob.\n\nTim Fricke\n\n___________________________________\n\nYEP AGREE re Kate Hudson.\n\nHolly Knight\n\n___________________________________\n\nMarvelous!!!!\n\nSent from Peter Noone\n\n___________________________________\n\nI like listening to Kate speak. She has that very likable, upbeat quality to her personality. She sounds fun. Like her mom. And her voice was surprisingly good. That girl can really sing.\n\nHoward tried to sound enthusiastic, but her songwriting was nothing. And her cover of Voices Carry was karaoke.\n\nHope she‚Äôs having fun. On to the next.\n\nPaul Gigante\n\n___________________________________\n\nI love, admire, and respect Howard Stern. The non-stop classic rock worship and drum beat ‚Äì hilarious coming from any boomer ‚Äì is over the top. ‚ÄúBilly Corgan has one of the best voices in music.‚Äù He said that in a serious manner! And more documentaries about sidemen nobody knows please!\n\nRob Warden\n\n___________________________________\n\nHer music has merit. It‚Äôs her thing. She told Howard Stern it‚Äôs been her thing her whole life but the family machine channeled her into a career that bestowed her a massive following. I see the Black Crowes and Stevie Nicks in her presentation. She‚Äôs got a slamming drummer, knows show biz, has 18 million followers on instagram, 260 thousand follows on Spotify. And now Bob Lefsetz bringing her to a whole new audience. All to help feed her family. She‚Äôs doing what she can. I respect that.\n\nKind regards,\n\nRob Whittaker\n\nP.S. I can hear Taylor Swift saying ‚ÄòKate ‚Äì this could be the best thing for your career!‚Äô\n\nüôÇ\n\n___________________________________\n\nYou‚Äôre right about one thing, we‚Äôre all looking for artistry. But are you kidding me? Actors are two dimensional?? Like you have any idea how difficult it is to create a character from the text on the page and bring it to life and make people feel something? Sometimes your thoughts are insightful, and sometimes your head is shoved so far up your own ass its laughable. Please quote me and include me in your ‚Äòmailbag‚Äô.\n\nBenjy Dobrin\n\n___________________________________\n\nWell‚Ä¶you just gave her a bump. There‚Äôs no such thing as bad publicity.\n\nBilly Chapin\n\n___________________________________\n\nCrickets. Right up there with a new Eric Estrada album.\n\nJohn Brodey\n\n___________________________________\n\nI haven‚Äôt even read your whole post below, but I happened to be up the other night and Kate was on The Tonight Show. Probably like you, my expectations were *very* low, but I was pretty taken aback at her vocal talent. She nailed it! I was somewhat shocked.\n\nI can‚Äôt imagine who her audience would be, but it definitely wasn‚Äôt the lame performance I was expecting.\n\nGood for her‚Ä¶\n\nJohn Van Nest\n\n___________________________________\n\nThe Kate Hudson thing is the epitome of modern day, good ol‚Äô USA. Her money and celebrity let her cut to the front of the line. So boring, but round and round we go.\n\nI‚Äôve run a record label (Royal Potato Family) for 15 years. I‚Äôve put out countless amazing, supremely inspired, enduring records. I‚Äôve never looked at all the indicators. I‚Äôve always signed artists and released records by my gut, what I hear, how it makes me feel and my belief that it can bring something sustinent to others. But aside from a small loyal audience, it‚Äôs impossible to get any attention or traction ‚Äì even our distributor doesn‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs only about numbers and $$. Nobody even listens ‚Äì people in fancy offices, making lots of money and all they can say is get a TikTok page, get more likes on social media. I have to always be working four or five other jobs ‚Äì PR, management, consulting, etc. to keep the dream alive. Everyday, wake up, roll the stone back up hill.\n\nI‚Äôm sure most people would respond by saying I suck, my artists suck, play the game better, stop whining. Release something that masses want and the masses will come. Fair enough. I get it. We‚Äôre not entitled to anything. Live by the sword, die by the sword. We‚Äôll keep pushing. That small community of people who care will be enough. There are some brilliant artists, with pure artistic expression, who still break through. But it‚Äôs getting tougher everyday. I can‚Äôt help but think collectively we‚Äôd be doing a little better if quality mattered as much as the fastest path to money. I‚Äôm not sure how much longer those of us who embrace that notion can financially sustain without more reach. Never mind the mental health aspect. Speaking for myself, I‚Äôll keep going. Maybe I completely burn out and have to take a job as a barista. At least I went for it.\n\nI‚Äôm not even sure what point I‚Äôm trying to make anymore other than there are still some of us out here for whom artists who‚Äôve toiled over their craft, write songs that speak to our human condition, get in a room together and create music that vibrates with both the trials and beauty of life, is everything. We put on records and we feel better for 22 minutes. It makes the world a richer, more vibrant place and is a bridge for soulful people with open hearts in their day to day lives.\n\nThis leads me back to Kate Hudson. She has every right to make a record and put her artistic vision into the world. But it‚Äôs the access, the dumb f*cking corporate hacks who care about nothing but money and celebrity, who amplify her at the expense of those way more compelling who should be getting that opportunity. Again, I get it. It‚Äôs the way of the world, nothing my bitching is gonna do to change it. But it‚Äôs heartbreaking.\n\nListen to this Chris Kasper record we put out today. If it was 1973, it might stand a chance.\n\nKevin Calabro\n\nRoyal Potato Family\n\nPS ‚Äì I was Chris Robinson‚Äôs publicist for five years.\n\n___________________________________\n\nI don‚Äôt know Bob. I think you might have missed the boat here. I stumbled across Kate‚Äôs performance on Howard‚Äôs show on social media and heard an amazing performance of one of my favorite songs from the 80‚Äôs. I thought she took on a tough song to sing live and absolutely owned it! Moreover, she seemed to be really enjoying the moment and obviously loves to sing. So she‚Äôs happy, and I‚Äôm happy to have heard it. Isn‚Äôt that how music is supposed to work? What‚Äôs wrong with that??\n\nNeil Barry\n\n___________________________________\n\nYou‚Äôre burying the lead here. The fault, dear Brutus, lies not in Kate Hudson‚Ä¶but Howard putting her on?? Baba-boring. (Love Howard still but‚Ä¶oof).\n\nKevin Berntson\n\n___________________________________\n\nI‚Äôve got no time for a Kate Hudson album..I‚Äôm too busy listening to Rita Wilson deep cuts..The box set of demos is out, on colored vinyl! SO glad I bought that Dolby Atmos setup!\n\nCelebrities get to skip the line at Disneyland..They also get good tables at restaurants, and when you‚Äôre famous you can just walk up and grab em‚Äô by the pussy..\n\nAnd they get some oxygen for their vanity projects..Music, children‚Äôs books, cook books, charities, and other such claptrap..It counts as content on the daytime TV talk circuit..Are there even any housewives/stay at home moms that watch network/syndicated TV? Maybe some rest home residents? Do they consume new music?\n\nI‚Äôd conjecture that the audience for a Kate Hudson album overlaps with the people who listen to Dr. Phil‚Äôs WIFE‚ÄôS podcast..(Not making that sh*t up!) (Of course, rock stars hawking their paintings isn‚Äôt ‚Äúcringe‚Äù.)\n\nI can‚Äôt believe Stern allowed this..His musical guests have always been top-notch.. Someone called in their last favor.. Hudson‚Äôs exes (Chris Robinson, Matt Bellamy) wisely refuse to indulge their wife in her fantasy..I‚Äôd have been LIVID seeing a Muse featuring Kate Hudson video!\n\nSome stars WERE so hot, a single WAS a way to capitalize..David Soul, Jack Wagner, Patrick Swayze, John Travolta, Eddie Murphy,etc..But Jeff Bridges, Juliet Lewis, Kevin Bacon, Keanu, Steven Segal, Kevin Costner, Billy Bob Thornton,etc., etc.? Of course, they can play the fly-over circuit, and people will come, just to say they saw a celebrity..\n\nThe Ryan Gosling movie? I had to look it up You can‚Äôt open a summer with a non sequel/superhero flick! Warner Bros lost $200 million on the ‚ÄúSuicide Squad‚Äù video game..The manosphere is claiming it was ‚Äútoo woke‚Äù..\n\nThe #1 Repugnantc*nt talking point, from Kelly Ann Conway to Joe Facebook to Kid Rock is now, ‚ÄúWell Trump didn‚Äôt start any NEW wars.‚Äù To be blurted out, when asked ‚Äútough‚Äù questions..\n\nHuh? He continued the war he RAN on stopping..It‚Äôs like a fireman who brags about not starting any NEW fires..(While failing to put out the one he was hired to.) THAT‚ÄôS their silver bullet? They‚Äôre peacenicks now?\n\nWhat‚Äôs next? The Biden Tornado Cabal? ‚ÄúI caint recall Trump having sew mini tornadys! And why come we never sea nary nun of them twisters in the blew states?‚Äù\n\nP.S. Letterman and Petty laughing about Jennifer Love Hewitt‚Äôs tour, on national TV was hilarious! She was still in the green room!\n\nJames Spencer"
