        "text": "Background\n\nA systematic review (SR) provides an accurate summary of studies addressing a clear and specific question through an objective and explicit method employed in the whole research process. A meta-analysis (MA) refers to both the statistical procedure that combines multiple studies’ data and an SR that includes this procedure [1].\n\nA typical SR follows these steps: (i) determining a specific and often narrowed-down review question, a search strategy, inclusion and exclusion criteria, a synthesis approach, and preparing a structured protocol; (ii) conducting a systematic search to retrieve original studies; (iii) screening the retrieved studies by checking their titles, abstracts and then full texts, as well as using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria; (iv) critically appraising the included studies and characterizing them by certain features (e.g., research design); (v) extracting the relevant quantitative and/or qualitative data; (vi) synthesizing the data. Subsequently, depending on the question and the available literature, and also the nature of the data, MA can be employed [1].\n\nIn clinical medicine (CM), the concept of SR is well recognized, especially after introducing evidence-based medicine (EBM); The SR of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) is considered the highest level of evidence on the effectiveness of treatment options. Moreover, the recommendations provided by SRs for clinical practice as well as the degree of factual uncertainty (about those recommendations) determined by SRs are valuable for both implementation in clinical practice as well as for future research to address those factual uncertainties [2].\n\nThe terms “systematic review” and “meta-analysis” are extensively used in the current healthcare literature; and, the publication rate of SRs has increasingly grown in recent decades. According to Ioannidis et al., among PubMed-indexed articles between 1986 and 2015, 266,782 records were tagged as “systematic review” and 58,611 records as “systematic review and meta-analysis” [3]. Moreover, a comparison between the articles published in 1991 and those published in 2014 demonstrates an increase in the publication rate of SRs and MAs by 2728% and 2635%, respectively; while this rate is only 153% for all other publication types [3].\n\nOn the other hand, some criticisms have been made about the concept of SR [3–7]. These criticisms fall into two main categories. The first category includes the proper criticisms. For instance, Ioannidis et al. discussed that despite the increasing number of SRs in clinical biomedicine, many SRs have limitations such as little value, wide redundancy, misleading claims, and/or vested interests. They have argued that many authors consider SR as a straightforward way to publish highly cited articles, rather than to clarify the evidence to promote evidence-based practice [3]. In this category, the criticisms are centered on how existing SRs have deviated from the original philosophy and rationale behind the concept of SR. Another category includes fallacious and ill-founded criticisms about SRs which are in fact misconceptions about SR, as Petticrew discussed [7]. For example, SRs have been criticized that they cannot provide easily digestible summaries of the evidence for decision-makers (while it is a common misconception as discussed later) [8].\n\nMoreover, other areas of healthcare research (e.g., public health, medical education, health policy, and even biomedical ethics as a discipline mainly based on philosophical theories) have gradually initiated to develop their customized conceptions of SR. Although they have adjusted the original concept for their fields, these new conceptualizations still originate from the SR concept in CM [9–13]. Consequently, misconceptions about SR in CM could be transferred to these areas of research.\n\nTherefore, critical reflection on the rationale behind the concept of SR in CM and its misconceptions can be valuable, yet again. Furthermore, despite the long establishment of the rationale behind SR in the literature such as Petticrew’s or Mulrow’s work [5, 14], an overall picture of ideas that are behind developing SR is needed to clarify the ideas and facilitate the understanding of the rationale behind SR especially in CM. Providing a conceptual framework, the value added by this review article to the current literature on the rationale behind SR, is useful to organize ideas, make conceptual distinctions, and map out concepts and the presumed relations among them.\n\nThe article can serve as a useful reference for learning and reflecting on the concept of SR in CM as defining the concept of SR, reviewing the history of the concept, clarifying the rationale behind SR through a conceptual framework, and reviewing the common misconceptions about SR in CM, all together. As conceptual maps are employed in medical education to organize and present the knowledge as well as promote meaningful learning [15], this article provides a conceptual map that is useful to teach and learn the above-mentioned concepts.\n\nThe history of systematic reviews\n\nIn the 1930s, the term “systematic review” was originally introduced in social sciences to summarize the previous studies conducted for testing a hypothesis. Gradually, new elements are added to the concept of SR; the reviewers started to appraise the results obtained through the literature search to provide an answer to a specific question; Statistical pooling of the individual studies’ results to synthesize a pooled result (i.e., MA) was initially introduced in the late 1970s. Then, healthcare systems started to employ this method. Cochrane Collaboration and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) were established in the UK in 1993 and 1994, respectively [5]. These pioneers aimed to promote evidence-based practice via preparing, maintaining, and disseminating SRs addressing the efficacy of various healthcare interventions (i.e., SRs of RCTs) [1].\n\nHowever, the concept of SR was not exclusive to RCTs. SRs gradually appeared in other areas of science (e.g., public health) as well as for various clinical questions. For example, six different types of Cochrane reviews have been introduced so far: (i) Intervention reviews, evaluating the harms and benefits of the interventions used in healthcare and health policy; (ii) Diagnostic test accuracy reviews, evaluating the diagnostic value of diagnostic tests in the detection of a particular disease; (iii) Methodology reviews, addressing how SRs and RCTs are performed and how their results are reported; (iv) Qualitative reviews, addressing questions on the aspects other than the effectiveness by reviewing and synthesizing both qualitative and quantitative studies; (v) Prognosis reviews, addressing the probable natural course of patients with a particular disease; and (vi) Overviews of the Reviews (OoRs), compiling from the results of several SRs into a single article to be accessible, easily understandable, and useful for facilitating healthcare decision-makings. The Cochrane Library includes both Cochrane SRs and non-Cochrane SRs in The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and CRD databases, respectively [1].\n\nOver time, other institutes have gradually joined the research synthesis movement in healthcare including SRs and MAs, promoted the relevant methods, published and collected SRs on various subjects (e.g., Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)) [16, 17].\n\nThe importance of SRs in healthcare and the rapid expansion of biomedical literature, as well as the demanding and time-consuming processes of generating the SRs, require the assistance of information technology advances. Currently, various platforms are available to help researchers conduct an SR (e.g., Review Manager (Rev Man)) [18]. Since 2015, the International Collaboration for the Automation of Systematic Reviews (ICASR) has initiated activities to employ the recent advances in natural language processing, data mining (especially text mining), and machine learning to produce algorithms that are capable of a more accurate, rapid, and low-cost simulation of human work in SRs. The vision that the collaboration attempts to turn into reality is to develop such technology enabling the researchers to edit, test, and then implement an SR protocol “at the push of a button” [19]."
