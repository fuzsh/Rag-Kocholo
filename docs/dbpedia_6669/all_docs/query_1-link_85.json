Tuesday was the Lakes Mortgages ice cream day with all competitors getting a very welcome hard earned ice cream when they came off the water.\n\nThe well-oiled superb Royal Torbay Yacht Club race team have set excellent course with spot on race lengths and some very nifty work laying new replacement windward marks during races to cope with some variable directions.\n\nSunday saw 8-12 knot southerly with Ed and Andy Connellan laying down an early marker leading race 1 throughout just ahead of a fast finishing Joanthan and Louisa Ching with Ollie Groves/Esther Parkhurst 3rd. Ollie/Esther were the form team in the second race to win from Pete Vincent/Sophie Bentley who just got the better of Jaye Whitehead/Alice Moore on the final run.\n\nMonday saw 10-14 knots from the SW and Ollie/Esther were well clear in race 3 from the Connellan's and Pete/Sophie. Race 4 in more pressure saw Adrian/Ros Stell be a tiny dot right in Torquay have a massive lead at the first mark to win from Ollie/Esther and the Chings.\n\nTuesday was held in a variable wind strength Westerly. The Connellans scored another impressive win in race 5 with a starbar result from Juliet Barnes/Steve Long in 2nd and Ollie/Esther.\n\nRace 6 was very eventful with Ollie/Esther literally tied up with the pin end boat. Matt Sargent/Zak Mitchell sailed an excellent first beat to have a good lead but half way down the first run the breeze went very soft as the leading group wallowed in the middle of the course rather frantically looking at boats on both edges coming down in new breeze. Somehow Matt/Zak got to the leeward gate 3rd and then sailed a top race to score a well deserved win from Jaye/Alice with the Connellans thirds as boats finished full speed spray everywhere plains.\n\nWith crews now on a well deserved lay day the Championships are wide open particularly with the promise of fairly fruity breezy conditions tomorrow.\n\nResults after 6 races:"
