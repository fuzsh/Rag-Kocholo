        "text": "Ever heard Big Mama Thornton’s recording of “Hound Dog”? Great song. Would recommend.\n\nWe bring it up because, near the end, a musician is heard barking.\n\nWhen asked about this seemingly inspired moment during an interview, the backup man reportedly said: “I was going to meow, but that was too hip for them.”\n\nAnd therein lies the secret to clients surviving in today’s ever-crowded landscape.\n\nTo bark at the end of a song called “Hound Dog” is clever, but not necessarily genius or unpredictable. It’s just clever enough for people to think they are buying into something creative. It’s the safe side of risky.\n\nBut to meow is inspired.\n\nMeowing has edge, a backstory. It stays with you after the music has left.\n\nWe as an industry are often too tempted by the bark––the safe one.\n\nMischief meows."
