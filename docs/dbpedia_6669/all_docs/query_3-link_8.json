        "text": "Shakespeare Theatre Company presents The Taming of the Shrew\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:\n\nApril 18, 2016\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nMichael Porto\n\n202.547.3230 ext. 2315\n\nPress@ShakespeareTheatre.org\n\nUP NEXT AT SHAKESPEARE THEATRE COMPANY:\n\nMAULIK PANCHOLY AND PETER GADIOT TO LEAD CAST OF\n\nTHE TAMING OF THE SHREW, DIRECTED BY ED SYLVANUS ISKANDAR\n\nFEATURING THE MUSIC OF DUNCAN SHEIK\n\nWashington, D.C.—Next at Shakespeare Theatre Company (STC), stage and screen actors Maulik Pancholy (Weeds, 30 Rock) and Peter Gadiot (Once Upon a Time in Wonderland) will be seen playing Katherina and Petruchio respectively in Ed Sylvanus Iskandar’s bold new interpretation of Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew. Iskandar, known for his striking and immersive directorial style, completes STC’s 2015–2016 season with this production, playing in Sidney Harman Hall from May 17 to June 26, 2016.\n\nSpilling from the stage into the lobbies and the street, director Ed Sylvanus Iskandar’s production presents a provocative new approach to The Taming of the Shrew and an utterly unique audience experience. Iskandar will use an all-male cast to examine the fluidity of identity, the authenticity of self-performance and the economics of love in one of Shakespeare’s most notorious texts. Set in the arena of high fashion with influences from both Renaissance and 1950s Italy, Iskandar is working to craft a spectacular world for STC audiences.\n\nFounding Artistic Director of the theatre collective Exit, Pursued by a Bear and an emerging artist noted for his innovative interpretation of classic texts, Iskandar creates performances that shift beyond the proscenium, reconnecting audiences and artists and working to establish a thriving social community within the theatre. Iskandar’s previous projects include the 2014 Drama Desk Award-winners The Golden Dragon and The Mysteries—a collaboration with 50 playwrights that reimagined the stories of The Bible over six hours—as well as These Seven Sicknesses, a five-hour adaptation of all seven of Sophocles’ plays, and Restoration Comedy, both Drama Desk Award-nominated.\n\nPerforming the lead role of Katherina in The Taming of the Shrew, Maulik Pancholy makes his STC debut, having recently starred opposite Martin Short and Matthew Broderick in the Broadway hit It’s Only a Play. Pancholy is best known for playing Jonathan on the Golden Globe® and Screen Actors Guild® Award-winning NBC comedy 30 Rock and for playing Sanjay on Showtime’s award-winning dramedy Weeds. Playing opposite Pancholy as Petruchio is screen and stage actor Peter Gadiot, known for his work in the films The Forbidden Girl, Night Wolf and 13 Hours, in addition to his extensive television credits, including Cyrus on Once Upon a Time in Wonderland and his forthcoming leading role in USA Network’s Queen of the South, which is set to air in the summer of 2016.\n\nSpeaking about his concept for Shrew, Iskandar explains, “Shakespeare’s central narrative is about Kate, an ‘other’ who chooses to transform and rejoin society on her own terms. I want to create a world in which otherness can manifest in as visible a way as possible. I am interested in using a widely diverse canvas to express universality: the world will be specific, but the story no less universal.” Regarding his all-male cast, Iskandar continues, “With an all-male cast, we are attempting to shift the focus from the war of the sexes to the war within the self. The Public Theater has just announced an all-female production of Shrew in the Park with exactly the same running date as ours, which I can’t wait to see.” He concludes, “It seems a single-gender cast allows us to unlock this play in an important new way.”\n\nNoted for his epic and immersive style, Iskandar will extend the world of the production beyond the stage, creating a deeply engaging experience for audience members. In line with this vision, STC will invoke the atmosphere of an Italian piazza (the Piazza d’Amore) in the Harman lobbies and will offer audience and community members the opportunity to engage with the performers of The Taming of the Shrew off-stage. Supporting Iskandar’s desire to create a community with theatre, STC has also invited local artists, makers and restaurants to lead a series of make-and-take workshops, life-hack seminars and tastings and demonstrations in STC lobbies during the run of the show. The workshop series, called The Padua Finishing School, is open to the public and can serve as a standalone event or can accompany a ticket to The Taming of the Shrew. Workshop fees range from $12–$65.\n\nThe exciting off-stage elements of this production echo Iskandar’s distinctive artistic approach to Shakespeare’s comedy on stage. “I use three major elements to tell the story, of which text is the primary one,” Iskandar explains. “Music and dance will also play major roles to create a richer world where each character in the show is treated as an individual with a full dramatic arc.” Incorporating contemporary pop music by Tony® and Grammy® Award-winner Duncan Sheik, Iskandar’s long-time collaborator, the production will use songs as the soliloquies denied to Kate, Bianca and other characters in the play. Sheik’s music, primarily performed live, will function as momentary reveries through which audiences may gain a deeper understanding of the characters. Sheik is best known for Spring Awakening, which won him Tony Awards® for Original Score and Orchestrations and a Grammy Award® for Best Musical Theater Album. He also composed the musical adaptation of American Psycho, currently on Broadway.\n\nThis production will also include a 30-minute musical intermezzo of Sheik’s compositions during the intermission. However, Shakespeare’s text will remain the show’s driving force. Iskandar explains, “Above all, we are filling and shaping the contours of the story as it lands for us, today. I was working with Duncan on a workshop for a musical while beginning my process on Taming. I started to imagine a world where I could give voice to characters without the agency to express their inner lives, and because Duncan’s work is so pure, full of sincere desire, need and love, I realized that his songbook would provide the perfect soliloquies.”\n\nIskandar joins STC as the first director in the Clarice Smith Series: New Directors for the Classics, having been invited by STC Artistic Director Michael Kahn after Kahn saw Iskandar’s production of The Mysteries (The Flea, NYC). “I found his style appealing, profound and very moving,” Kahn explains. “His artistic choices, paired with STC’s engagement and outreach activities, will further humanize the characters on stage for our audiences—and I also believe his choices will create a dialogue about authenticity and identity, something which is particularly relevant in our times.”\n\nThe Taming of the Shrew begins preview performances on May 17, celebrates Opening Night on Tuesday, May 24, and continues through June 26 at STC’s Sidney Harman Hall (610 F Street NW). To purchase tickets or to learn more, patrons can call the Box Office at 202.547.1122 or visit ShakespeareTheatre.org.\n\nDirector Ed Sylvanus Iskandar and The Taming of the Shrew are underwritten by the Clarice Smith Series: New Directors for the Classics. Additional support for this production comes from the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nTHE CAST\n\nThe Taming of the Shrew, Shakespeare’s notorious comedy about courtship, marriage and individuality, last seen on STC stages in the 2007–2008 Season, stars Maulik Pancholy as Katherina and Peter Gadiot as Petruchio.
