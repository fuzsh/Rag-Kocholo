This year’s keynote speakers are:\n\nJessica Sansom, Huel: The manifestations of climate change - rising to the challenge and adapting to a new normal\n\nThe food industry is responsible for more than a quarter of all global greenhouse gas emissions. Without significant change in this industry, it will be impossible to limit global warming to under 2 degrees.\n\n134 countries at COP 28 signed a declaration on sustainable food systems, meaning that they must now include food in their national climate action plans, including a commitment to shift from higher greenhouse gas-emitting practices to more sustainable production and consumption approaches.\n\nJessica’s presentation explores what needs to happen in the processing equipment and packaging machinery sector in order to meet those targets.\n\nStefan Casey, Nestlé: The digital transformation of FMCG industry: How digital technology is bringing both challenges and opportunities in packaging across the whole value chain\n\nStefan’s talk will focus on affordable personalisation and customisation in packaging design through to production. His presentation will cover points such as the needs for more flexible packaging production solutions, cost effective solutions by optimising end-to-end from design through to manufacturing, and quality control and safety.\n\nVisitors will also have an opportunity to hear from leading industry speakers including Matt Androsiuk - Cobots and Machinery Safety Ltd, Dr Martin Kidman – SICK UK Ltd, Adam Dickins - AD Frameworks Ltd, and Chris Whyborn - Thornton Tomasetti. The seminars provide a wealth of valuable insights covering a wide range of topics, such as industry standards, CE and UKCA marking, automation to reduce carbon footprint, and many more inspiring subjects.\n\nIn addition to the seminars UK Automation Forum will be hosting a panel discussion on ‘What would make UK food businesses adopt more robots?’. The panel is hosted and facilitated by Gail Hunt from Automate UK, who will be joined by industry experts including Mike Loughran - Rockwell Automation, Chris Rooum - MTC - Manufacturing Technology Centre (MTC), Mike Wilson - Manufacturing Technology Centre (MTC), Prof Phil Webb - Cranfield University, and Oliver Selby - FANUC UK. The discussion will focus on the positive impact that adopting automation can have on the sector as well as sharing advice and learnings that can help to deliver successful outcomes.\n\nIn addition to discovering and exploring various innovations and solutions, experiencing live demonstrations, seeing product launches first-hand and learning at seminars, visitors will have plenty of opportunities to make new business connections and network with industry peers.\n\nAutomate UK wants to ensure that visitors have a standout show experience; one of the new features at this year’s show is the free PPMA Show app. This will allow visitors to plan their day, have easy access to their entry ticket and discover all aspects of the show, from exhibitors and products through to a complete list of seminars and speakers.\n\nScott McKenna, Chief Operating Officer at Automate UK, said: “We’ve been working hard to ensure that the PPMA Show continues to live up to its reputation as the UK’s largest event showcasing innovative technology from the processing and packaging industry.
