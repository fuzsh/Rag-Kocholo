Alice is comparatively extravagant for alternating between thin lines and large barber pole stripes, and details in the others eventually start to catch the eye like the mottling in Emily Dickinson or the green outlines of the dark blue bars in Gertrude Stein. Still, they're undeniably a little dull. With the exercise of naming paintings after authors and the formal pretexts it's clear she was using metaphor and iteration to explore ways of staying interested in painting 40+ years in. Keeping invested is one of the great challenges of making art, and I think it was working for her even if it takes an effort for the viewer to share her interest. Plus .5 with the addendum of the slight but charming collection of her drawings from the late '50s of their pet bird Morgan (named after J.P.) on the third floor.\n\nSusan Cianciolo - Light Workers - RUN 15 - Game of Life - (Thank You Pine Trees) - Bridget Donahue - ***.5\n\nI was on Instagram in 2014, so I remember vividly when Susan was the hottest thing on the block. She's still got it with the hippie spiritual/Romanian peasant patchwork thing, and the watercolors and wall hangings are nice, but this feels a little withholding if only because her work used to seem like it was bubbling up endlessly from an infinite wellspring. I really like the sculpture in the front made out of wood blocks on some tables and chairs, but my reservation is with the clothes themselves. Even though she was a (the?) progenitor of scrap fashion and a lot of the outfits on display were made before that style got completely, utterly done to death, random junk and little bits of fabric attached to scrappy cheap clothing just doesn't hit like it used to even if it's not her fault.\n\nNate Boyce - Discipline - Lomex - N/A\n\nI've spoken too much with Nate about this body of work to judge it with adequate critical distance, but the video (and projection setup) looks great in person, and the Webern by Gould sounds great.\n\nRaphael Egil - Ground Speed - Yve Yang - **.5\n\nHe's hitting all the painterly notes: Classically-informed Cézanne reference, self-portrait, landscape, still life, loose, gestural abstraction, willful inconsistencies of style, large canvases next to very small canvases, etc. He's not untalented, but his self-aware sifting through different modes as modes is so transparent, all so many disinterested decisions that can be exchanged equally with any other, that he throttles any possibility of doing anything with his paintings outside of articulating that he's aware of what he's doing. Very Swiss, I think. Intelligent, but managerial and a little bloodless, every decision thoroughly catalogued and considered but fundamentally incapable of any real risk-taking. Selbst 2 comes the closest to overcoming that feeling of distance, but I'd guess the general impression is an accurate reflection of the artist.\n\n6/13/2024\n\nLiz Magic Laser - Art Handling: An Installation Play - Luxembourg & Co. - ***.5\n\nThis whole thing is weird from every angle; the ostensible content is a play that occurred in the space in May, documented in security camera footage that is projected in the space, but it's also a group show with an Oldenburg (a fantastic soft light switch), a Rauschenberg (a screen door with inner tube, railroad track, and electrical cord from his Venetian series), a couple artworks about gold, some vases, the permit forms for the performance, a table of power tools and art handling supplies, shipping crates, a glass cube on a pedestal, an \"invisible cube\" (a square on the floor), two older Laser films, and a couple spiky metal things. The spiky things are by Lygia Clark and I think the gold pieces are by Gino De Dominicis, but I'm not sure which did the invisible cube or the vases because the press release, a pamphlet imitating Playbill, doesn't list the works and artists together. In spite of the work by other artists there's nothing to suggest this should be categorized as a group show, because it's actually a play. The play itself seems to have taken place from 11am to 7pm on May 11th, but the footage I saw mostly consisted of the regular mingling at an opening, I guess during an intermission, until the performers started listing their art handling credentials and removing the painter's tape from the invisible cube. The classic recursive conceit of \"a play about making a play\" being transposed to the drudgery of installing art is lightly funny and it successfully destabilizes the clean categorization of what the show \"is,\" but the tongue-in-cheek theatrics of the performers pretending to fret over the details of the installation or standing around with a clipboard self-seriously is all a little too pointless to amount to much more than a gag. Still, even if it's meta performance art by rote, it does serve as a welcome reminder that deconstructing the conventions of art installations is an exercise that's fruitful and all too rare.\n\nMaria Lassnig - Drawings - Petzel - ****\n\nEverybody loves Lassnig so there's not much that needs saying, but what's striking in these is the persistent singularity of her figures and forms. Every cartooned hand and mangled face is unburdened by any stylistic referentiality to the point that they feel entirely self-sufficient and autonomous. That quality makes me think of Picasso, although there's not really any resemblance and he doesn't subvert history as much as he pummels it into submission. Rather it's the apparent outpouring of \"style,\" the inimitable quality of form that occurred whenever either of them started drawing. Her formal singularity makes the drawings too consistent to meaningfully differentiate between them, which isn't to say they're repetitive, just that she's always good. But you already knew that.\n\nKer-Xavier Roussel - Michael Werner - ***\n\nUnlike the better known Nabis, you can immediately detect that Roussel's sensibility was old-fashioned and a little reactionary for his time, sort of like the untimeliness of Puvis de Chavannes; whereas Bonnard maintained an Impressionist sensibility through the 1940s, Roussel seems to have had more of a taste for academic neoclassicism that was already dated circa 1900. That affection didn't extend to technique, though, so his worn-out woodland nymphs are counterbalanced by an impulsive indifference to finish and an experimental approach to handling and color that stops them from becoming complete kitsch. In a few moments his fantasized classicism and technical roughness produces an uncanny anticipation of the kind of painting you see from contemporary artists that want to revive the premodern without forfeiting the modern (i.e. more than a couple Werner artists), but for the most part he's a forgotten European painter that's a second-rate artist and a first-rate curiosity. A footnote that doesn't deserve more or less attention than he's received, but peculiar enough that his work is worth seeing.\n\nRobert Cottingham - Robert Cottingham's Americana (Works from 1965-2018) - Fleiss-Vallois - **\n\nHm, no, boring. Photorealism often tends towards a stifled verisimilitude that renders it more stiff and airless than a photograph of the same, which is to say I'd prefer photos of old signage. That he puts so much work into painting such an invariant subject just emphasizes that there's no real point in him going to all of this trouble, but I guess that used to be considered interesting at one point?\n\nJean Dubuffet & Allan McCollum - Galerie 1900-2000 - ***.5\n\nVery funny, the two go blow-for-blow with works that consist almost entirely of dots and texture. These Dubuffets are far from him at his best, but the stubborn insistence on pure granularity is beneficial to both parties by doubling down on the mutual absurdity of each.\n\nDavid Ostrowksi - Parliament - Sprüth Magers - ***.5\n\nI dismissed his Ramiken show out of hand, but there's a lot more going on in each of these than there was in any of those. I assume, due to the relative stature of the galleries, that he put more work into this one. The flat variations between realistic and cartoonish, sparse and dense, the interactions between each figure in each instance, etc., succeeds in evincing an eager levity that suggests the work was fun to make. More importantly, owls are always fun to look at.\n\nRay Yoshida, Christina Ramberg, Deborah Druick - Bodies - David Nolan - ***\n\nRamberg and Yoshida's sketches and occasional paintings of bodies are lively by way of stoner doodles, one of Nolan's key stylistic preoccupations. Druick fits in by the metric of surface signifiers but she's the ugly duckling: actual ugliness is fine in this wheelhouse, but her figures are stiff and repetitive instead of iterative and exploratory, which is not fine in this wheelhouse.\n\nJutta Koether - 1982, 1983, 1984 - Galerie Buchholz - ***.5\n\nThis early work is very scrappy, even borderline crude and indistinct, and it isn't a high point of an artist's brilliant burst onto the scene but the great expectations of a promising artistic long game. They're interesting to see within the context of her later paintings, but aside from the one in the press materials and the relatively large one on a muddled cream background with an inscrutable composition of a black v-shape and three vertical lines (there's also a drawing of the same but upside down) they aren't particularly compelling. The press release emphasizes her relationship to the music magazine SPEX at the time, and the DIY countercultural context is clarifying. Approaching painting as an elemental, stripped-down procedure, like the \"bare bones\" of punk or folk music, making small paintings in her room, building her artistic sensibility from the ground up, operating off of little more than instinct and hard work. This sets the stage for a daunting task of artistic development, of laboring to find a way of making art when the tools haven't been handed to you. The threat of immediate success is hitting on a shallow trick and being shackled to that limited methodology forever; it's far better to take your time developing a mature approach to making art that enables perpetual depth of development and variation. A long time ago I realized that a number of my favorite artists didn't land on their personal style until later in life: Susan Howe didn't become a poet until she was nearly 40, Robert Ashley was over 50 by the time he finished Perfect Lives, I don't think Godard really hit his stride until the '80s, I think there were more that I can't remember. The tragic problem of this is the impossibility of surviving as a difficult artist today without cultural forces to encourage that difficulty, let alone a long-term development that takes decades to come to fruition. Artists barely even have immature periods in the first place these days because self-marketing is so central that an artist's sensibility has to be prepackaged and readymade from the first, and then it's not allowed to change lest a collector feel alienated by the new work looking different from the old work. Sad!\n\n6/9/2024\n\nSabina Maria van der Linden - Das Letzte/The Latest - Gandt - ****\n\nVan der Linden is a cool older Euro woman interested in aesthetic and technological futurism, in the vein of Isa Genzken or Lynn Hershman Leeson, but with a \"career\" more in the mold of a Chelsea Hotel eccentric, sort of like Bettina if you swapped out the '70s NYC minimalism influence for '00s Berlin digital art and fashion. The physical objects in the show (looping calligraphic drawings, bits of text in strange fonts, goofy Photoshop fantasies, drawings of a six-fingered hand, polka dot orbs) suggest only the vaguest outline of her mental universe. The main content is in her videos, which are available on YouTube and Vimeo links on the gallery website. In particular PERFECTLY YOU, a series of 50 videos mostly made in 2007 and uploaded to YouTube in 2008, posits a distinct aesthetic environment of ribbons, frilly leotards, bossa nova, artificial and idealized poses and gestures, fashion signifiers and advertisements as a language, etc. Camp, in short, but '00s camp from a middle-aged woman in Berlin, a fantasy of clean, modish '60s counterculture, of hippies as a London pop marketing strategy instead of dirty kids in Golden Gate Park. The Vimeo series THOUGHTS, CELLPHONE MONOLOGUES, AND CONVERSATIONS (or something like that, the title is inconsistent) from 2010-11 is less expansive but exaggerates the strangeness by featuring a model in fetish heels and a wig that covers her face, wearing a speaker as an accessory and writhing on a leather couch. I don't like falling back on the phrase, but the effect is surrealist, or, even worse, Lynchian, although of course the word only signifies the sense of a malevolent dream that Lynch is an easy point of reference for. Anyways, their shared creepiness is also a common effect of early DV cameras. Her own website is fun to click around on, a relic of a better time online, and all the combined rabbit holes never coalesce into something that makes sense, presumably by design. All in all a document of a true weirdo, a species that's tragically endangered, if not extinct, these days. As neither an outsider artist nor a professional, the work inhabits an interstitial space of authentic engagement of a kind that's almost impossible to imagine now. Most glaringly, why did she make this stuff? For the pleasure of it, of course, but how did she have the time and resources? The world hasn't always been so hostile to people who don't want a career.\n\n6/7/2024\n\nRita Ackermann - Splits: Printing | Painting - Hauser & Wirth - ***.5\n\nThese look a lot like mid-period de Kooning if you blended his drawings and paintings together. Her signature figures are a lot more modeled, obviously, but they're mostly so obscured and scrawled that the comparison holds. The flattened translation of thick paint texture in the prints is interesting, and as far as 2024 AbEx goes the paintings are classically dynamic in a way that most contemporary painters don't have a prayer of achieving. They're also AbEx in 2024 so they're not particularly exciting or groundbreaking, but the \"landscape\" of abstraction breaking through the figural passages creates an effective density and motion. I don't really know her work, we'll see if her main show builds on this in any particular direction.\n\nMelissa Cody - Power Up - Garth Greenan - **\n\nWhen I looked the show up beforehand I thought the reappropriation of the swastika could have been a kind of interesting element (as it is in historical Navajo weaving), and I like the figure, but I was really just attracted to the traditional motifs; none of the contemporary digressions she introduces to express her artistic subjectivity improve upon the basic model. I was trying to get into it but I gave up when I noticed that one of the pieces reads \"I am Navajo Barbie.\"\n\nMichele Abeles, Sarah Charlesworth, Talia Chetrit, Aria Dean, Liz Deschenes, Sam Durant, Lucy Charlesworth Freeman, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Douglas Huebler, Larry Johnson, Mike Kelley, Joseph Kosuth, Deana Lawson, Glenn Ligon, Tony Oursler, Hirsch Perlman, Luciano Perna, Stephen Prina, Laurie Simmons, Liu Shiyuan, Sara VanDerBeek, James Welling, Christopher Williams - Tabula Rasa - Paula Cooper - ***\n\nYes yes, tabula rasa, conceptual photography as reinventing art from the ground up, I get it. The problem I have with this work is its air of unmet aspirations, the innocence in believing that history can be broken with, or that the invention of new artistic signifiers will circumvent the inevitable reduction of style to commodifiable aesthetic signifiers, which isn't to say that it ruins the work. A lot of it is good, like Lawson, Huebler, Williams, Johnson, Oursler. Much of the rest consists of aesthetically pleasing photographs, like Perna or Shiyuan, but then again much of the rest is concerned with Architecture and Photography in ways that feel pretentious and impotent, at least in retrospect. Philosophical and political radicality in art is often conditional to the social context it came from, and the work of this kind that ages well more often than not does so because it succeeds aesthetically, which is to say that it doesn't break with history. I've never seen a Kosuth that made me interested enough to take the ramifications of his work seriously, for instance.\n\nMatthew Barney - SECONDARY: object replay - Gladstone - *.5\n\n\"Muscle man stuns audiences in latest death-defying feat: smearing shit-like substance on wall, using only his own head!\" I guess the Colosseum/skyline/clouds painting thing upstairs is mildly engaging, at least in comparison to the entirely uninteresting pipes and weights. God he's so fucking annoying...\n\nEva Hesse - Five Sculptures - Hauser & Wirth - ***.5\n\nI was kind of confused when I saw this; of course I know that her work was groundbreaking in its time and that she died young, but I was curious to find someone writing about her work that framed her not in terms of material innovation or mythologizing. I read Robert Pincus-Witten's Artforum article that came out a year-and-a-half after her death, and even then the writing was full-blown hagiography, rapturously poring over her notebooks and scrupulously recounting each phase of her embattled life. Her life and personality was certainly fascinating and deeply fraught: A Jew born in Germany in 1936, she described the central influence of Carl Andre's floor squares as her \"concentration camp;\" she knew the materials she worked with would degrade but was at peace with their mortality, and the toxicity of those materials is what killed her. But there's also a sense that this obsession with biographical information is on some level a desire to compensate for her art. She didn't leave behind enough work to constitute more than a suggestion of her artistic vision; arriving at a personal style by 1965, finding maturity within it in 1968-69 before dying in 1970 of a brain tumor, she really only had two or three good years of output in a labor-intensive medium (compare van Gogh, whose mature period also spanned only five years), so it makes sense to take recourse to every ephemeral detail to fill out her picture. I'm not faulting this, just pointing out the truism that we would see her work very differently if she had lived to work for another 30 years. Anyway, the show consists of a series of pot-like sculptures from 1967, sheets of latex laying on the floor, sheets of latex on the wall, and a latex construction that looks sort of like an unfurled tank tread climbing up the wall, all from 1968, and Expanded Expansion from 1969, which looks a lot like curtains made from latex and cheesecloth. The aged fragility of the work is interesting and adds yet another later of myth and preciousness, but ultimately it's a bunch of crinkly latex. Maybe Hauser's insurance-minded austerity undercuts the biomorphic quality of the work and the selection itself is held back by being inevitably limited, but I suspect my own relative inability to see the work as more than the material qualities of the things they're made of is primarily a historical problem. The difficulty of minimalism and postminimalism in the present isn't the sophistication of the theory underpinning the art, but the impossibility of grasping the conditions of what made the work radical at the time. Putting sculptures directly on the floor instead of on plinths was a groundbreaking step for minimalists and came along with an insistence on the clean logic of industrial polish and the \"grid,\" then Robert Smithson had his own elaboration beyond that outside the gallery with maps and geology, and Robert Morris could write impassioned pronouncements about using soft materials, etc. Fifty years on it's easy to take all of this for granted, and we have no sculptural conventions to resist or ideological manifestos to believe in. Anything can be sculpture, there's no boundaries to push, we can't be surprised or scandalized by anything, so now it's self-evident, even quaint, that artists were once so stimulated by poking around the stores on Canal that sold industrial materials. This is basically my problem with the Paula Cooper show, that the radicality of an artwork is relative to a temporal condition and is not at all inherent or guaranteed. This applies just as readily to minimalists like Judd, or, more glaringly, Andre and Buren, both of whom ran their ideas into the ground decades ago by refusing to do anything new with the ideas they had in the '60s. The real test of an artist is their ability to develop their work over time, not by slavishly adopting every fashion but by pursuing the logic of their work in different directions to avoid complacent repetition. Hesse didn't get the chance to do that, sadly, but it's easy enough to imagine she would have risen to the challenge if she had, which is part of the reason for her enduring interest. As it is these works are more interesting as a time capsule, which, to be fair, is far from nothing.\n\nRita Ackermann - Splits - Hauser & Wirth - ***.5\n\nYeah, this follows from the show at H&W Editions with no surprises, it's just more elaborated. I think they work better when the figures are less rendered, but from a purely painterly perspective they're hard to fault, particularly Noisy Feet, Shutters, and Shut Eye.\n\nKwoma artist, Wifredo Lam, Max Ernst, Ramu River artist, Elema artist, Abelam artist, New Ireland artist, Joan Miró, Man Ray, Yves Tanguy, Salvador Dalí, New Georgia Islands artist, Pablo Picasso, André Masson, Roberto Matta, Master of the Double Pillow (attrib.), Dorothea Tanning, René Magritte, Hans Bellmer, Valentine Hugo, Marcel Jean, Sepik artist, Kurt Seligmann, Giorgio de Chirico, Jacques Villon (after Marcel Duchamp), Turamarubi artist, Victor Brauner, Karawari River artist, Yimam artist - From the World of Dreams: Melanesian Art and a small retrospective of Important Surrealist Prints curated by Timothy Baum - Pace African & Oceanic Art - ****\n\nAs the above information implies, this a baroque little group show. I look in here out of habit so I didn't actually check what the show was and wasn't expecting a collection of Surrealist prints, which, considering this seems to be the most neglected alcove of the Pace empire, is surprisingly substantial; a solid selection of Ernsts and Mirós dominate, but none of it feels chosen at random. I guess these prints are Baum's stock in trade so it makes sense that he's something of a connoisseur, but curatorial expertise is too rare to ever be shrugged at these days. If that weren't enough, the native masks are even better than usual, particularly the towering New Ireland masks and figures.\n\nNeil Jenney - Idealism Is Unavoidable - Gagosian - ***.5\n\nJenney's Good Paintings are no less tongue-in-cheek than his Bad Paintings, but the nature of their ironic detachment is somewhat harder to pin down. The presentation is already self-consciously stylized, for the most part on panels that are extremely short and wide, in exaggeratedly lavish frames with obliquely natural words and often the letters \"N\" and \"A\" (for North America) painted on them. The paintings themselves are closeups of stumps, trees, streams, clouds, and so on. An extreme depth of field is often at play due to the tight cropping of the scenes, but there's also an odd flatness created by the rigid detailing that's applied equally to foreground and background. All these elements of distanced self-awareness combine into a strangeness that's reminiscent of nothing so much as good children's books, like something by Chris Van Allsburg. That's interesting, even distinctive, but in the end it comes down to an illustrative preponderance of style that reduces its natural subjects to arbitrariness instead of the specificity of painting from life.\n\nAdam Pendleton - An Abstraction - Pace - *\n\nThese wouldn't look out of place if someone was hawking them on the sidewalk down the street from the Whitney. The imposing black walls try, unsuccessfully, to obscure that.\n\nTara Donovan - Stratagems - Pace - *.5\n\nRecycling, yay!\n\nteamLab - The World of Irreversible Change - Pace - *\n\nAre you fucking kidding me? This belongs in a Midwestern airport, not a gallery. I thought this might be amusingly bad but it's actually a full-on indictment of art and society that any money was put into making this, let alone that it's (I assume) for sale.\n\nJoanne Greenbaum - Scaffold - Mitchell-Innes & Nash - ***\n\nOn the surface these clashing colors drawn with markers are self-evidently ugly, but I guess she's mainly interested in the \"scaffolding\" of form. They are structurally more convincing than the documentation might lead you to believe, which isn't to say they're not ugly.\n\n6/5/2024\n\nMike Kelley - Singles' Mixer - Brant Foundation - ****\n\nThis is one of those rare artworks that doesn't posit genius as some high-minded, profound, \"ennobling\" force, but as something obvious and enjoyable, almost commonsensical. In other words, this is incredibly dumb, but also very funny in a way that makes you wonder why nothing is this fun anymore. Like a Fassbinder film or Paul McCarthy's Painter, it caricatures the deathly serious realities of life like masculinity, sexuality, morality, pop culture, society, entropy, etc., and subjects it to a gleeful parody without resorting to ironic condescension or mockery. I mean, it takes a deep knowledge of life to come up with a singles' mixer populated by a nerd, a hillbilly, a Kiss fan, a witch, and four black women, who proceed to discuss the sex appeal of Gene Simmons, R. Kelly, Kobe Bryant, Garth Brooks, and Brandon Lee (each represented in a kitschy painting, with Brooks, in a stroke of brilliance, staring at a single boob in profile), before the Kiss fan and hillbilly get into a fight as grindcore plays in the background. It sounds funny and it's actually funnier, because it's not playing for laughs as much as it manages to turn life itself into an existential joke. I think culture at the time was experiencing one of its last blooms before the internet ate us alive, so these things could still be invoked without immediately collapsing into the cynical self-perpetuation of empty signifiers. I mean, isn't the use of these celebrities infinitely more subtle, funny, interesting, ambivalent, and edifying of their star power than that new Charli XCX video?\n\nPeter Hujar - Rialto - Ukranian Museum - ****\n\nEven his earliest photos have a miraculous precision, which is most impressive in his impromptu images. The ones of farm animals are particularly striking for coming off perfectly staged and composed, and for imbuing them with all the pathos and psychology of his street photography of New Yorkers, which is his dominant mode here and where he seems most in his element. The portraits of celebrities and images shot in a studio are comparatively less impressive because that focus is more predictable and less extemporaneous, and his pictures that don't show living creatures lack the charge of those that do, although all of it is far from unappealing. I get that photos of famous people used to be more exciting when we weren't bombarded with them all the time, and I'm sure he was interested in exploring things in the studio that aren't as interesting to me, but without people (or animals) even his photos of the Palermo catacombs mostly come off like tourist snapshots.\n\n5/25/2024\n\nMel Bochner - All Sales Final! - Totah - ***\n\nI've never really gotten the whole \"painting text\" thing that Bochner and Wool are known for, I get the feeling that whatever once made these paintings of words radical or interesting is invisible in our current context. I mean, I like Gene Beery but he's more focused on textual humor and metaphysics, and Ed Ruscha has a more complex visual language; Bochner and Wool seem more interested in generic turns of phrase as elements in painting-as-painting while also resisting the painterly so I'm not sure what to take from it. The edifice of art in general and painting in particular has been so exploded that just about any position of obstinacy or negation now reads as a self-evident gesture instead of the critical/intellectual stance it once was. That's just to say I don't particularly see the punctum of his method, but I do like the misery and vitriol expressed in the text. \"Lost Our Lease!\" is a proper motto for our times.\n\nCarl Theodor Dreyer, Ken Gonzales-Day, David Howe, Sigmar Polke, Zoe Pettijohn Schade, Rosemarie Trockel, Weegee - The Madness of Crowds - Carriage Trade - ****.5\n\nCarriage Trade at it again with another edition of the best group show in town. Sure, The Passion of Joan of Arc is hard to beat, but for one thing, who else would put it in a group show, and, for two, who else could curate a group show that adequately fits it into the show's thesis and not just riding on Dreyer's coattails? Certainly no one else would put it next to an episode of The Twilight Zone (\"The Monsters are Due on Maple Street\"). But why not? It's a tragedy that only Carriage Trade would, because such leaps of associative logic are exactly what good curation consists of. Namely, bringing the apparently unlike together into something that suggests correlations that aren't readily apparent. It's not even that hard to make those connections if you're aided by a good idea, as this show is with the subject of the crowd, specifically mob rule and the vindictive retribution of a mass that has perceived a real or imagined persecution. Thus we get Joan of Arc and suburban paranoia, but also student protests (a student film featuring Martin Scorsese and Harvey Keitel, police manuals on riots), the edifices of state and authority (Pettijohn Schade's crumbling monuments, Trockel's left side of her diptych of people climbing the walls of the Capitol), the unreality of digital life (Howe's North Korean propaganda-style painting of Mark Zuckerberg, Trockel's right side of the diptych of a woman in a VR sci-fi headset), murder (Weegee's photo of a crowd after a shooting), and lynchings (Ken Gonzales-Day's unbelievable collection of lynching postcards with the victims edited out, excising the violence-porn spectacle but retaining all the horror that such things actually existed). The show presents real-life phenomena without flat didactics, which is what separates something like Trockel's painting, a measured reflection on our contemporary condition of mass hysteria and distantiation, from the insipid tut-tutting of all that anti-Drumpf art that mistakes hysterical virtue-signaling for praxis. To the extent that art is political at all it does so by representing the nuance and complexity of life instead of mere sloganeering, and it's a difficult task to articulate that. By nature it's far more ambiguous than most people are comfortable with in these times where social polarization demands constant affirmations of whichever camp one belongs to, but, like curation, if you cut corners and go for the obvious you're not likely to end up accomplishing very much.\n\nDoris Guo, Matthew Langan-Peck, Isabelle Frances McGuire, Ruben Ulises Rodriguez Montoya - Artists Space - ****\n\nThis reminds me of nothing so much as the first Artists Space show in this space way back in late 2019 (the sixth Kritic's Korner review and the first four star review), which is sort of weird because they haven't had any comparable group shows (four \"relevant\" artists put together without any stared curatorial theme) in the intervening four and a half years. There's a literal resemblance because Jason Hirata and Doris Guo both dominated the same room with projectors, but there's also some correlations of content. For reference, my earlier review in its entirety: \"Post-conceptual lazy appropriation art is funny, Lomex 'tweaker with glue' art isn't. .5 bonus for anti-curation.\" Montoya definitely inhabits the \"tweaker with glue\" camp, assembling found objects (cheekily enumerated with diaristic details in each work's list of materials) into wannabe Giger spiky things, and it's still not funny. The attempt at imbuing significance in the objects by noting where he got them is obnoxious, and he sticks out like a sore thumb for going for a gothy surface aesthetic where the other three artists are canny enough to avoid a gauche invocation of style. The other three are thus more on the post-conceptual side, although they aren't appropriations. You could call the work lazy, in a sense, but I didn't mean that term negatively then or now; I just mean that the artists know that art has moved beyond the need to legitimate itself through craft. Maybe tweaker art implies that as well by exaggerating pointless handiwork? I don't know, that's probably a generous reading, whatever. Peck's boxes, eggs, and audio pieces (I particularly like the \"song\" Small Clip 1, you can listen here) repeat the forms he used at Gandt and been working with for a while now, but that's a self-conscious decision and he has the ingenuity to iterate without coming off as complacent. McGuire has three large pink banners with stars on them hanging from the ceiling and a naked \"giant\" made of foam lying on the ground that seems to be an overt copping of Charles Ray's style, which is nowhere near as unfortunate as Maurizio Cattelan's budget ripoff of Ray that's up right now and unfortunately near to Ray's show that's up right now, but it seems like a bad idea to step on Ray's toes lest you be judged against him. On the website there's a photo of Death of Napoleon, another sculpture by McGuire that's similar but doesn't look like a Ray and seems like it would have been more interesting, but regardless the disjunct between the dead giant and the banners is still oblique enough to work against any facile aesthetics. Last but not least are Guo's opaque projectors, wrapped or enclosed in decorated boxes and projecting inscrutable little object compositions. The gold rings and flower buds projected onto the back was seem to be the show's favorite work by a wide margin, judging by the number of Instagram stories I saw of it after the opening, and it is a beautiful image. I joked to someone that it looks like something out of a Pinterest wedding moodboard from 2010, which I didn't mean seriously, but it does convey something about what makes these projections captivating. Just about any evocation of beauty today is wrapped up in its own derivation from an aesthetic \"elsewhere,\" a mass of signifiers that point to an idea of something else instead of to itself. That's why fashion is boring now, it's all so many references slapped on top of each other that there's no content undergirding any of it. Guo's projectors and the tableaux inside of them manage to simply be visually precious with enough distance from any point of reference that they can stand on their own without baggage, although my comment underscores that complete autonomy is never possible. The show succeeds in general on this same logic, three of the four artists are sufficiently indifferent to the trap of stylistic surface that their work manages to exist on its own.\n\nOlivia Rodrigo & Conan Gray, Monique Mouton, Sarah Rapson, Tony Oursler, Mia Madison, ANOHNI, Charles Atlas, Clay Hapaz, Jesse Murry - she sleeps in light / we WILL save his soul - Loong Mah - ****\n\nOkay I'm tired of writing, I think this is probably the longest update I've ever done. I went to Carriage Trade, Artists Space, and Loong Mah with a friend so I didn't take any notes which makes reviewing a lot harder, especially when the shows are good. The show is entirely eclectic and cracked, Clay Hapaz (whose painting in the show is charming) curated the show and he spent three months installing it, which is crazy on the level of logistics, willingness on the part of the gallery, dedication on his part, and probably a few more levels I'm not thinking of. It's suitably packed with ideas and earnestly eclectic; aside from the Olivia Rodrigo and Mia Madison covers of a Katy Perry song playing on iPhones, there's newspaper clippings and old news broadcasts about child abductions, Bible verses, and those great Tony Oursler face projections onto dummies, not to mention Rapson and Atlas. Anyway, I've been working on this update for almost a week and I just remembered I don't get paid for them. Please consider donating!\n\n5/24/2024\n\nMatthew Gasda - Morning Journal - The Brooklyn Center for Theatre Research - ***\n\nI know next to nothing about theater, much less contemporary theater. I've read some books by Richard Maxwell and I think he's great, but I only saw one play of his in a hotel room in Portland almost a decade ago and watched a couple of his plays when they were available online during the lockdowns, but the old camcorder recordings weren't very digestible. Other than that I like Shakespeare, I've read some Beckett, Wilde, Brecht, I liked the movie version of A Long Day's Journey Into Night, and a couple other things here or there, but I wouldn't pretend any familiarity with the medium. I was offered a press ticket to this and accepted mainly because my boredom with galleries has been getting excruciating lately, which isn't to say I had low expectations, just few. I know Gasda's name, I heard about Dimes Square like everyone else, I vaguely recall hearing about Zoomers, and I've glanced at his Twitter and Substack, but fundamentally I didn't have any real notion of what his plays were like except for the on-the-nose topicality and the presumption that there was some ideological connection to the Dimes Square social world. But Morning Journal isn't particularly topical and it doesn't have any discernible interest in scenester posturing that I associate with Dimes Square, which is a relief, but it also begs the question of what it actually is concerned with. The play is structured as a series of seven vignettes with six separate pairs of actors (the first pair returns for the seventh scene) that cycle through various interpersonal dynamics. The opening scene consists of a woman coming to catsit for another woman who's taking a trip for her father's funeral; their interaction fluctuates from tense to confessional and back because the latter's ex-boyfriend recently left her for the former. The second pair consists of female friends navigating their drunken hookup from the night before, the third is a straight couple having an argument, the fourth female friends that smoke weed and argue about their poorly matched personalities, bickering sisters in the fifth, and the sixth is a straight pair that hooked up the night before (the man is implied to be the same man discussed by the first pair, but it's years later). There are recurrent lines, props, and subjects that crop up in different arrangements throughout: yoga, smoking, sitting on a fire escape, hiccups, a cat, classical music and piano playing, a coffee table book of Medieval art, the titular journal, coffee, the idea of being someone else, and the general themes of sex and intimacy. More importantly, by the second scene, aided by the large zodiac wheel prop in the background and the twelve actors, I realized that each character's personality corresponded to an astrological sign. I tried to guess who was what (I'm from California) but it's never overtly acknowledged and I'm not certain if there's a clear sequence or not, although I'd bet money that the bickering sisters are a Leo and a Virgo. All of this is to say that the play feels like a formalist exercise, almost à la Oulipo, perhaps as a strategy to move away from the overt timeliness of Gasda's earlier plays and, while I'm all for formal experimentation, the conceit feels less like a means for literary inquiry than a pretext for writing a play without a subject. The astrology archetypes standing in for characters and the brevity of each scene makes the self-consciousness of the construction explicit, so there's not much to grasp aside from the form. The duo from the first and last scene aren't as reducible to types as the rest, but the format is so elliptical that they only start to suggest fleshed-out characters before they disappear. This is an ungenerous complaint, to be sure. I'm well aware of how hard it is to get out of the pit of literary self-reflexiveness to write something that \"means something,\" and also firsthand the difficulties of developing your practice from the ground up outside of an institutional framework/tradition. I should hasten to add that the play was perfectly competent; the actors were well-practiced as far as I could tell and the dialogue never made me cringe or roll my eyes, which is impressive for contemporary writing. But the moments of humor were mainly derived from imitations of generational patterns of speech that didn't amuse me as much as it did the rest of the audience (saying \"damn\" as an anticlimactic expression of sympathetic attentiveness, glib statements about behaving badly in romantic relationships), and, similarly, the general objective seemed to be not much more than a sense of semi-autofictional verity to life in Brooklyn. It did that reasonably well, but none of the scenes engaged me as much as my own mental exercise of guessing everyone's signs. Unlike Maxwell's New York City Players or the Wooster Group, Gasda's approach has no experimental or modernist pretensions, which isn't something I'm demanding, although I do think some engagement with more adventurous drama could be productive. If directly engaging with Beckett would be pretentious and daunting, then how about a consideration of what's going on with Maxwell's writing, or Robert Ashley's operas? Again, this is like telling someone they should simply become a brilliant genius, and in general I don't believe in telling artists how to do their jobs so I'm embarrassed to critique in these terms. Still, Gasda described the play as \"crazy\" in his introduction, which makes me wonder how straight-laced his influences are. As it stands, what I took to be the true focus of the whole undertaking was simply the practicalities of writing a play, assembling a theater troupe, and staging it, sort of like an ambitious thesis project in theater school. By that standard it definitely succeeds, and it's no mean feat to coordinate the participation of a dozen actors, a crew, even alternate actors, and to practice enough for a plausible air of professionalism. I mentioned the difficulty of working outside of an institutional framework because all of that would be comparatively streamlined if this was done within a conventional structure, leaving more room for the playwright to focus on his writing. There doesn't seem to be an existing system that generates any great playwrights so he's going it alone, and it's a lot of work to do it at all, let alone to do it with polish, much less profundity. I feel similarly about my relationship to criticism, and close to five years in I still think my own writing is sloppy and mostly dilettantish. In other words, I know how hard-won artistic maturity is in a world that no longer values it.\n\n5/22/2024\n\nWill Stovall - Kant Crisis - Ulrik - ***.5\n\nThese funny little cartoon figures bring me back to when my friend showed me Kramers Ergot in my freshman year of college, which felt groundbreaking and more or less was at the time, I think, although it got real worn out from all the Paper Rad biting over the next few years. People really liked drawing a simplified line profile of a dog wearing a baseball cap for a few years there... Anyway, in an art gallery context this style might qualify as a bit naive (and Stovall, coming from an academic background, has never shown his art publicly before), which isn't disqualifying; the benefit of an illustrative style is that it can be used as a modular vessel for ideas not strictly related to the style itself, which usually isn't the case in painting, where the form usually determines, or is, the content. The ideas in question here revolve around Heinrich von Kleist's Kant-induced existential crisis on the mediated nature of perception and another observation of his about how all the stones in an archway hold each other up. To be honest I have no idea how either relates to the artworks, except that the arch is a recurrent symbol, but in the more detailed works the lines that fill the space have an consistent rigor that feels related to the granular systems of a rationalist ontology, or even of a kind of antiquarian cosmological view like you find in Bosch, albeit on a smaller scale. All the miniaturized details have a crystallized clarity that's engrossing in the manner of airtight logical reasoning, so in that sense the work succeeds in rendering a sense of philosophy by artistic means. I think the Kleist stuff is too abstract to have any chance of translating directly into the art. I'm comparatively less sure of what to make of the works not dominated by horror vacui, but as diagrammatic compositions of simplified figures in obscure situations they're at least not beholden to any the various conventions that so many contemporary artists like utilize while telling themselves that they're unique.\n\nJoanne Robertson - Field - Company - ***\n\nI've noted before that I've always been confused by her paintings; they're such shameless imitations of late Joan Mitchell (there's even a diptych!) that it strains credulity to imagine that anyone sees them as anything else, and yet people seem to love her. Well, it's not really that confusing, people are friends with her and fans of her music, and earnest passion for someone's art practice is very low on the list of the most likely reasons someone shows support for another artist on social media. That's not to say they're bad imitations, they're pretty good, and in spite of the resemblance I'd buy that she simply landed on a process of decidedly no-frills gestural abstraction that therefore looks a lot like late Joan Mitchell. Maybe the color palate's too close for such a generous reading, but her relationship to Mitchell is beside the point. Robertson has a decent grasp of form and lacks the uncomfortable self-consciousness of the more academic young retro abstractionists that get shows at small Chelsea galleries, but the fact of the matter is that art is a deeply contextual medium and this attempt at pure painting can't shrug off its historical baggage no matter how indifferent the artist may be to it being read that way. The problem isn't how directly derivative it is of a single artist but that it nakedly assumes an artistic logic that's already been fully canonized and validated. There's no stakes and no risk in making an abstract painting in 2024 that could have been made any time in the last 40 years. Of course, artists are uniquely unable to find stakes and risk in their art these days, but that's no excuse. Art is hard.\n\nQuay Quinn Wolf, K.R.M. Mooney, SoiL Thornton, Park McArthur, Jason Hirata - plus one - ensemble - **\n\nExcept for Wolf, whose work I'm not familiar with, this looks like a promising show on paper, but in this \"ensemble\" they're pretty insufferable. There's just almost nothing in here and the combination of all these works isn't mutually reinforcing, it's pretentious. Wolf's piece is a patch of quilted leather hanging on a stand, Mooney has two small balls used for making jewelery, I think, on the floor with ambiguous art/jewelery objects on the top, Thornton's piece is a dress made of wire and bells, McArthur's is a framed series of photos of a blank blue sign of the same dimensions of a handicapped parking spot sign placed in various locations, and Hirata's piece, Mural of a cockroach's eye, consists of two little dots kind of shaped like commas on each side of the pillar in the room. In another context I can easily imagine any of these working well, except maybe Wolf's, but here less is less because all these intersecting planes of competing intellectual art practices cancel each other out. None are contextualized enough to make their intended functions clear, and the presentation is so unremittingly hermetic that it's more likely to provoke a roll of the eyes than further investigation.\n\nLauren Quin - Logopanic - 125 Newbury - **\n\nI guess I sort of get her market appeal, or at least I get it more than I thought I would. There's a formal dynamism that does feel somewhat akin to Pollock, almost to a literal degree on the top-level splatters, and the density of layering operates on a similar level of optical confusion. But it's all a garish, commercial post-digital Pollock that proliferates all these techniques of monoprinting and scraping and whatever else to appear new on the surface to deny the fact of its recapitulation of pure visuality that panders to the market and doesn't challenge anything, no matter how fucking ugly these paintings may be. And that's the thing; once you stop poring over the chaotic little details and thinking about the techniques and step back to look at the whole, they're absolutely, gut-wrenchingly hideous!\n\nTarwuk - Good night, Ernst Toller! - Matthew Brown - ***\n\nThese two are certainly good at mining their particular vein of Euro whimsy eclecticism, and the scale of the big paintings connected by a frieze in the back is pretty impressive. I could rattle off a list of a dozen artists that wish they could do this fantasy world escapism stuff half as well, but I only appreciate this relative to them because the whole notion is still nostalgic and juvenile. It's a decadent pileup of signifiers, Baroque Deco Surrealist Nouveau Renaissance Giger Balthus Grosz Dix, etc., like an overpriced sandwich that justifies the price by stuffing it with fancy ingredients that it doesn't need. I'd prefer some fresh bread with good salami and butter.\n\nTrey Abdella, Rita Ackermann, Barbara Bloom, John Cage, John Currin, Nancy Dwyer, John Currin, Louis Eisner, Tomás Esson, Ravi Jackson, Lisa Jo, Martin Kippenberger, Colette Lumiere, Mathieu Malouf, Charles Mayton, Jeanette Mundt, Francis Picabia, Phillip Pearlstein, Jason Rhoades, Anita Steckel, Marika Thunder, Kyle Thurman, Christopher Williams, Lisa Yuskavage, Leah Ke Yi Zheng, Claire Lehmann - Everyone Loves Picabia - David Lewis - ***.5\n\nI could be totally wrong, but I get the sense that everyone loving Picabia is a relatively new thing. His brutal nihilism is something harder to swallow, or harder to intellectualize, valorize, and utilize than Duchamp, but, now that the world is in such a slump that it's essentially impossible to wholeheartedly believe in anything his indiscriminate love of chaos fits us like a glove. The handful of his own works are a well-chosen sampling of the wilder side of his range (I like the big shadowy one in the back a lot, which isn't in the web documentation for some reason) and is actually shockingly successful at laying the ground for an erratic and otherwise middling group show synthesizing into a logically illogical whole. On the one hand the resolutely austere and polished artists like Williams and Pearlstein are recontextualized to emphasize the surreal and comical sides of their work that are usually quietly subtextual, and on the other hand even the work that I'd usually hate like Trey Abdella's sloppy-photorealistic icicles and fingernails or Lisa Jo's exceptionally mediocre abstraction get swept up into Picabia's gleeful morass and make me accept them as welcome components of the churn. Barbara Bloom's corner photo is particularly appealing, the Kippenberger isn't great, and Ravi Jackson's Lil' Kim piece is still so blunt that it sticks out to bad effect, but in general I'm stunned at how infectious Picabia's amused indifference is. His influence is definitely infernal, and not to be taken lightly.\n\nMorgan Fisher - Three New Paintings, I Mean Six - Bortolami - ***\n\nYou've gotta respect an old guy still clinging to formalist/structuralist modernism today, and his \"innovation\" of see-through reversible paintings is mostly impressive for implying the extent of his own stubborn insistence on negation because they're rigorously avoidant of any pictorial interest. I've seen most of his films so I know his whole thing is approaching his work so self-reflexively that it approaches tautology, and I find his OCD endearing even if the work isn't \"enjoyable.\" Turning Over is all but impossible to see but I caught a screening of it over a decade ago and it was one of my favorite in-theater film experiences, it reorients all his absurd rigor from an alienating intellectualism to a charming neuroticism. It consists of him driving in circles around Twin Peaks in San Francisco with the camera focused on the dashboard while he excitedly rants about his fixation on making a film of his car's odometer turning over from 99,999 miles to 100,000, how worried he was that it would turn over while he was driving up from Los Angeles, scrambling to find a camera he could borrow in the city, how disappointed he was when he couldn't film when his last car turned over, etc., until it turns over. It's funny.\n\nSoiL Thornton - Painting, The Shorter of the Longest (The Journal) - The Journal Gallery - *.5\n\nA painting of two flowers, a painting of a black clownfish, a grid of wood blocks, and a painting of some concentric circles. It's clear that SoiL plays with the medium of painting for their own pleasure, but it's less clear why anyone should care. It occurs to me that what separates SoiL's old work from their newer mode is that there's now no sense of searching, struggle, or even plain exertion involved in their ongoing exploration of freedom in art. Clearly, they consider such effortlessness to be a positive attribute, which probably has something to do with concurrently being in two group shows here and two solo shows on each coast, but backtracking to painting after a transition into sculpture only to put out your most unimaginative paintings to date doesn't suggest a progressive inquiry or art's intrinsic plenitude. It suggests the self-satisfied decadence of an artist who has started to take their own brilliance for granted, which is one of the surest ways to lose track of what's good in your work. Schnabel comes to mind.\n\nErnie Barnes - In Rapture - Ortuzar Projects - ***\n\nHis hyper-mannerist exaggerations of motion and posture, mostly oriented around sports and dance, are certainly done in a style all his own, although he's so zeroed-in on the rendering of muscular activity that you could fairly accuse him of having a limited scope. Still, I'd much rather a one-trick pony to all the no-trick ponies in the world. It's funny that they took down de Jong's billiards paintings and put up Barnes' billiard paintings in the exact same place after I called it a neglected genre.\n\nJulian Kent - Drama of Silence - Kerry Schuss - ***.5\n\nHis figures look a lot like those old Squigglevision TV characters used towards modest and surprisingly literary ends, as a supplementary text clarifies the quotidian scenes of a man sitting at a piano is Glenn Gould from Bernhard's The Loser and a couple with red boots comes from The Brothers Karamazov. Other pieces are titled after songs by Nico, Swans, and Slowdive, which is all pretty good for a self-taught 22-year-old these days, although that background only serves to clarify that, at least to Kent, there's more going underneath the surface. The people are painted with thick stripes of impasto, which may not be strictly necessary except as a signature move, although they're surprisingly evocative considering their aforementioned cartoonishness and their blank facial expressions. The really winning attribute is the vivid, almost tactile solidity of his objects and details, like the thick outlines delimiting clothes, or a lamp, or a reflection of an object in a mirror. The first impression of humble, unadventurous figurative painting isn't wrong, but there's an earnest directness and simple imbuement of feeling throughout that only comes from the kind of talent that can't be taught.\n\n5/11/2024\n\nYves Klein - Yves Klein and the Tangible World - Lévy Gorvy Dayan - ***.5\n\nMy instinct going in was that I wouldn't like this; Klein's blunt force approach makes him into nothing so much as the first street art hypebeast, i.e. someone who mistakes their stupidity for profundity. Blue, women, spray paint, fire, rinse, repeat. It's certainly pretty idiotic, but it's also startling; his crudity and his \"manual screenprints\" of women at first seem to anticipate Warhol, but it leapfrogs over that and feels closer to something like the knowingly overbearing insistence of someone like Kippenberger. The spray paint in particular feels a good two decades ahead of the curve, and when he's trying to use the female form to capture the female form on canvas it's mostly effective. But then the purely abstract ones are just bad automatic paintings, the interactive sculpture has the misfortune of being an interactive sculpture, and the fire ones kind of suck. He may have been far ahead of his time, but that doesn't mean he was a genius. Being this far beyond your peers is most often a sign of being a really obnoxious person, or worse. Carlo Gesualdo pioneered chromatic composition two centuries before anyone else, but he was also, you know, a psychopath and a murderer...\n\nRichard Diebenkorn - Figures and Faces - Van Doren Waxter - ***\n\nMostly early Dieb in his figurative mode, Two Nudes, the nude in a room, and the two of his studio are engrossing, but other than that they're pretty conventional studies. Studies by a talented artist, to be sure, but they're studies. I saw some of his better-known works at Sotheby's earlier and that puts these in a desultory light.\n\nAnselm Kiefer - Punctum - Gagosian - **.5\n\nI can't take Kiefer's heavy-handedness seriously. Ooh, it kind of looks like the rubble of Germany after the war, I'm so scared!! His photography doesn't lighten him up, it just forfeits his use and abuse of scale which is his main strength and his main self-indulgence. The PR tries to make a big deal of this being an unseen element of his practice, but when an artist this pervasive has a body of work he hasn't exhibited it's probably for a reason. And for god's sake, leave Barthes out of it, I like him fine but it's 2024, stop talking about Camera Lucida, please... I was preemptively going to complain that they left out Kiefer's Occupations series (photographs of him doing the Nazi salute), but what do you know, they didn't.\n\nStanley Whitney - By the Love of Those Unloved - Gagosian - ***.5\n\nHe's definitely a good colorist, but the square format is so monotonous that I have a hard time believing that anyone is really passionate about these. I prefer the smaller ones, but the devout repetitiveness I see as the downfall of many minimal artists (I've had similar reactions to Judd and Marden and probably some others in this same space) seems to be his intended starting point.\n\nJean Dubuffet, Alberto Giacometti - Dubuffet x Giacometti - Nahmad - ***.5\n\nThe tiny Giacomettis are fun and the Dubuffets are mostly strong early pieces, particularly the sculptures, but it's far from an inspiring survey.\n\nCarl Andre, Alexander Calder, John Chamberlain, Beauford Delaney, Sam Francis, Philip Guston, David Hammons, Hans Hofmann, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Jeff Koons, Lee Krasner, Joan Miró, Joan Mitchell, Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Kazuo Shiraga, Frank Stella, Sturtevant, Mark Tobey, Bradley Walker Tomlin, Andy Warhol - Spring Fever - Mnuchin - ***\n\nTwo of the three de Koonings are great, the Warhol self-portrait is eye-catching, and the Pollock with cut-out figures is a mind-bender. I can't believe a work that unique in his oeuvre is sitting around on the market?? If I'm indifferent to the rest it's because I've seen most of it here already. Even if I haven't seen that specific Kline or Tobey, in this setting it feels like I have.\n\nWayne Thiebaud - Summer Days - Acquavella - ***.5\n\nWayne has to be the most sumptuous painter of surface of all time, his cakes and ice creams are just undeniable. It's basically impossible to find paintings anywhere that are this decadent, but his Greatest Hits really are his greatest hits. Everything else is second string or third, the towering beach hotels and cabana bars are interesting but they're dwarfed by the perfect flatness of the surfaces of his diner counters, the vivid peek of color in their shadows, etc. He's far from bad otherwise, but the food was his only moment of genius as far as I'm aware.\n\nEnrico Baj, with additional works by Richard Artschwager, Hans Bellmer, Kerstin Brätsch, William Copley, Jean Dubuffet, Marcel Duchamp, Nicole Eisenman, Asger Jorn, Martin Kippenberger, Jonathan Meese, Francis Picabia, Man Ray, and others - David Nolan - ****\n\nBaj seems to have been a weird guy with some cool friends; his felt generals and tasseled ladies are very funny but the show is definitively bolstered by everyone else, which is fine. Aside from being a lot of good work by more famous artists, it also conveys the enviable social world he moved in and contextualizes the logic he worked under. He knew Jorn so he knew about the Modifications overpainting series so he riffed on it, etc. I was surprised that the Eisenman had caught my eye when I looked at the checklist to see who made it, but really I liked everything on display. There's a collective feeling of inventiveness and an actually convincing sense of fun running throughout the selection that discourages any acute criticism. I'll take that wherever I can get it.\n\nMoyra Davey, Justine Kurland, Shala Miller, Alix Cléo Roubaud, Carla Williams, Francesca Woodman - Forks and Spoons - Galerie Buchholz - ***.5\n\nThis is a curatorial project by Davey tying together these confessional proto-selfie female photographers, and the continuity between them all is impressive. Moyra's poet-adjacent vocal affect in the video is hard for me to take, doubly so because everything she says is straightforward narration that doesn't go in-depth enough to make it feel truly informative, but the video seems more intended to frame the photography than to be seen as an artwork in its own right. The photographs are all pretty good, although to be honest I think a Woodman-Roubaud duo show would have been better. If all these artists converge on a certain methodology and investigation of embodiment that seems mainly due to the fact that it was a pretty easy format to fall into given the context of a shared gender, medium, and broad era (everyone was born in the fifties or sixties except for Miller), and Woodman and Roubaud are definitely the visionaries of the group that pioneered what is now an identifiable style. Then again, I inevitably can't pretend to relate to these images or find them psychologically accessible to my perspective, and if I did I might relate differently to the cumulative point of view shared between them. Woodman's photos are naturally overshadowed by her far larger Gagosian show but that's a coincidence, not a criticism. Speaking of coincidence, I recently saw Jean Eustache's Alix's Pictures, which I thought was pretentiously French even by my standards, but I like Eustache enough in general that the connection is edifying and I was impressed by Roubaud's photos before I realized she was the same Alix.\n\n5/4/2024\n\nAllen Ruppersberg - 25 Ways to Start Over - Greene Naftali - ***.5\n\nA nostalgist letting it all hang out, a guy who \"was there\" showing off that he was there without gloating because he cares more about poring over his own precious memories than trying to convince others that things were different back in his day. The jigsaw pieces with pulp novels, Allen Ginsberg, Rimbaud, Avalanche, etc., are forthright enough that you have to respect him cutting through the crap and just scrapbooking stuff he likes, but the wall print of the VHS boxes is what makes it for me. Take for instance The Birth of a Nation over Jesus Christ Superstar with Pi underneath it and A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 not far off, the whole creates a free play of high and low culture alongside the inevitable humor of apparently random juxtaposition that's infectious beyond any pretension or nostalgia or cultural grandstanding. What it really replicates is the now-extinct feeling of looking for a movie at Blockbuster, where you had to judge a movie by its cover and you could wind up walking out with just about anything, a sense of bountiful possibility of cultural discovery at your fingertips that you really can't get online. It's hard to imagine anyone not having a good time looking this over and recognizing everything they know or don't, though I guess this is foreign territory to people who grew up in the digital era.\n\nMartin Eder - DETOX - Marlborough - **\n\nUm, wow, okay, this is an interesting note for Marlborough to end on. I knew this was going to suck, but I wasn't prepared for this level of self-indulgent stupid obscenity which, to be clear, makes it better than I was expecting. Well, \"better.\" I guess budget digital clouds and graphics that might have come off as novel in a rap video a decade ago (like the title and artist's name on the wall) might be aesthetically pleasing to someone, and the kittens, Suicide Girls-ish smutty nudes, and camp Jesus imagery might be considered epically ironic to someone else, or maybe the same person. But my guess would be that he's attempting to go beyond that into a meta-irony where its own badness and social depravity become the subject matter, but there doesn't seem to be enough going on beneath the surface to pull that off. I'll admit that the one of a woman unzipping a man's pants to reveal an erect kitten is witty, but the rest is just porn-brained abjection.\n\nFrancis Bacon, Lucien Freud - Bacon and Freud: Conversations - Marlborough - ***\n\nYeah I dunno, a bunch of prints from each in their respective idioms that they churned-out like dutiful workhorses, nothing special. I like Freud's copy of Chardin and Bacon's piece after Ingres, but that's because they needed to copy another artist to introduce some compositional intrigue. Nothing against the talents of either artist, it's just these Marlborough upstairs shows always tended towards minor artworks by major artists.\n\nSherron Francis - Splash of Serenity, 1973-77 - Lincoln Glenn - ***\n\nPost-Rothko color field-y, toning back the heroic brushstroke materiality of the previous generation but still not quite composing images in any conventional sense. Some are successfully quasi-Rothko (where, for instance, many artists have failed to be quasi-Mondrian) and a couple have a slightly neon palate that I imagine was futuristic at the time, but a few more are palpably just some splatters on canvas.\n\nJohn Bradford - All The World's A Stage - Anna Zorina - ***\n\nTheater-goer classicism brought out of the cobwebbed pantry of history into the present by an extravagantly wasteful impasto. The rendering of the spotlighting in some of the stage scenes is surprisingly delicate and the painting of the full orchestra introduces a formal complexity by the practical fact of its density, but the rest land somewhere between inoffensively pleasant and boring.\n\nWilliam Eric Brown, Sophia Chai, Kevin Landers, Brittany Nelson, Shaun Pierson, Gonzalo Reyes Rodriguez, Sheida Soleimani - Tiptoeing Through the Kitchen, Recent Photography - Luhring Augustine - **.5\n\nMostly hyperreal contemporary photography, apparently motivated mainly by the urge to convey a sense of digital unreality by non-digital means. As such the byproducts are technically impressive, but since their effects end up in the familiar realm of digital artifice anyways the impressiveness is only technical, not artistic.\n\nTerry Winters - Point Cloud Pictures - Matthew Marks - ****\n\nWinters is sticking to his bitmap vortices, or whatever you call them, surprising no one. He's not going for surprise, though, because his scientific map (but not quite) impulse meets his spiritual mandala (but not quite) impulse at the crossroads of his rough but exactingly intentional technique to end up at the point of something that feels timeless. The blobs and bulges activate the eye, as they say, in a way that's neither new nor old, it just manipulates the fundamentals of the experience of looking at a painting to force you into paying attention. As he says in the press release, his painting has the objective of \"opening a fictive space or a lyrical dimension,\" which is exactly right and plenty of content for him to keep exploring indefinitely, and for us to keep looking at them. He's definitely refined the three-dimensional quality of his dots in comparison to his 2021 show, but, if I had to quibble, that show had a little more compositional piquancy.\n\nAmy Sillman - To Be Other-Wise - Gladstone - ***\n\nI saw a bunch of photos from the opening on Instagram the night before and wondered what my misgiving was, but as soon as I walked in I figured it out; this feels like student art. I don't mean that as an insult but as a designation of a particular tendency, specifically that the pedagogy of contemporary painting (when it's worthwhile, which is seldom) consists of breaking down and systematically thinking through all the requisite components of the act of painting, which demands so much thought on the artistic process that it's creatively paralyzing. To generalize, artists need to develop a competence and familiarity with their working methods so that they can focus on the end result of what they're doing. I think art school is an important part of the dialectical process of developing competence: you go to school because you like making art, you learn stuff and get too caught up in your head and lose touch with what you like about making art, then, hopefully, you find a way to integrate what you learn with what you like after you graduate. These paintings feel to me like they're caught up in the breaking down of painting without the building back up, I assume because her career as an educator has brought that tendency to the forefront. Her painterly inputs are so diffuse that there's no clear output, no fictive space or lyrical dimension, like spinning the wheels of the aimlessness of painting as its own virtue, which results in, of course, something like Cubism without the edge. The first two paintings that you see as you enter the space have some formal heft behind them, but the rest mostly deflates into the purely academic.\n\nCharles Ray - Matthew Marks - ****.5\n\nTwo dead guys is Ray doing what's expected of him, which is fine. 8FLU100 (a shockingly detailed small paper sculpture of a crashed station wagon) and Everyone takes off their pants at least once a day (a giant woman putting her pants on made of handmade paper) are exquisite, jaw-dropping sculptures with a kind of potency that's easy to forget art can provide these days. These are easily the best new artworks I've seen this year; brilliantly conceived as naturalistic, contemporary, and lightly novel subjects, sublimely technical, and visually captivating. I'm almost at a loss to say what it is that makes these so impressive, but it seems to come from the perfect calibration of the subject matter. The car is wrecked, the woman is caught in the middle of dressing in a banal, unsexualized way, they're not too literal nor too classical nor too much of anything at all, they just are. It's exceedingly difficult to find a way to present images without any pretexts or references in their own plenitude, but these manage to be something with the near-complete vibrancy of things in themselves. I even find myself rethinking my response to his Met show from a couple years ago where I dismissed the humanism of the wall texts and emphasized the cold artifice of his sculptures. Much of his older work does have an uncanny distance, but his late work has, if not a warmth, a radiant specificity that's much more complex and inscrutable than the weirdness of mannequins. I don't feel capable of articulating what it is that makes these so good, and if that's rare it's only because art is seldom as powerful as it can be. One of the very few modern masters.\n\nJordan Belson - Hidden Formation - Matthew Marks - ***\n\nPsychedelic-symbolic images that I'm sure were much more entrancing in the '60s, let alone the early '50s, but now they're mostly quaint in their overblown \"sun-moon\" gravitas, a lot like Harry Smith with less drug-induced erratic behavior. Perfectly nice, but these are also part of a historical lineage that died out for a reason.\n\nKimsooja - Meta-Painting - Tanya Bonakdar - *\n\nSort of like The Museum of Ice Cream if it was pretentious. I gather that's this gallery's wheelhouse, which is why I've never been here before.\n\nTerry Adkins, Carl Andre, Lynda Benglis, Bill Bollinger, Luciano Fabro, Robert Grosvenor, Justin Matherly, Joel Shapiro, Jackie Winsor - Disparity - Paula Cooper - **\n\nI like the Bollinger and the Grosvenor, but the crassness of the later work mostly succeeds in trivializing the seriousness of its forebears.\n\nMaurizio Catellan - Sunday - Gagosian - *.5\n\nLest someone find my championing of Ray undeserved, overblown, or underarticulated, here we have a very helpful counterexample of a shit impression of Ray by a much less talented artist. The marble \"fountain\" is of someone, presumably homeless, sleeping on a bench and pissing. It has none of Ray's characteristic technical vividness and I imagine Catellan doesn't care about the execution at all because he's concerned with the commentary which is, I guess, supposed to be taken as subversively political, but just strikes me as crass and unfeeling. Catellan picks his subject with all the acuity of someone who shows with Taglialatella Galleries, mistaking a dick or a needle in the arm for an incisive critique of society. All the gold pieces he shot with a gun are, similarly, supposed to be saying something about something by selling for a lot of money, but self-implication doesn't work as a critique if you're just as stupid as what you're critiquing. The nicest thing I can say is that I like this space when they take out all the walls.\n\nKarl Blossfeldt, Erwin Blumenfeld, Bill Brandt, Harry Callahan, Bill Cuninham, František Drtikol, Walker Evans, Lois Field, Philippe Halsman, Lotte Jacobi, György Kepes, André Kertész, Dorothea Lange, Lisette Model, Paul Outerbridge, Sigmar Polke, Man Ray, Larry Silver, Victor Vasarely, Edward Weston, Francesca Woodman - An Outsider's Eye - Ricco/Maresca - ****\n\nA fantastic collection of surreal/weirdo/erotic photography where the pervasive historical distance of black and white is sufficient to make everything pictured into something alien. I'm sure the artists also had to try very hard to find that strangeness too, and the curation makes that quality seamless. The photos themselves are too various and visually appealing to warrant description, it's just a bunch of very nice pictures. Don't miss the little Man Ray show around the corner at the photography gallery where all of this came from.\n\nJorge Alberto Cadi, Le Fétichiste, Miroslav Tichý - Fetish - Ricco/Maresca - ***.5\n\nCadi's goth stitching is dumb, but the other two are pretty amazing archival documents that only just avoid being totally quotidian by being grouped together and \"activated\" by the underlying suggestion of perversity. Le Fétichiste is basically a budget hobbyist Helmut Newton, and Tichý's stand out for the crudity of the handmade cameras he shot the photos on.\n\nPaul Klee - Psychic Improvisation - David Zwirner - ****\n\nWoo yeah! This is far from a top survey of Klee, but One-eyed mask, Beat carpet orient (talk about a great title), and The policeman in front of his house are all phenomenal. Actually, the whole room to the right of the stairs is incredible, and it's not like he was ever outright bad, even if some phases are better than others. Great frames.\n\nJoe Bradley - Vom Abend - David Zwirner - ***.5\n\nIt's interesting to see these after Winters and Sillman; in spite of his cartoonish elements, they all share a love of dots and grapple with the burden of freedom in contemporary painting. Winters has a specific purview, Sillman has intentionally avoided specificity, and Bradley has a clear style but it's so catholic in its modes and influences that it's more of a deconstruction of all the possible modes of post-virtuosity painting put through a blender, and it's only come out as a mode through its own insistent repetition. Weirdly, some of the moments of \"figuration,\" like in Angel's Trumpet, remind me of nothing so much as Cumwizard69420 if his scatological nudes were turned inside out and exploded. I don't much like the moments of overt figures/symbols like eyes or sailboats, which upsets the pure placelessness of the prevailing effect, but outside of that it's hard to come to a decisive conclusion on the success or failure of these paintings. They seem caught between expression and negation, like he's stuck at an impasse where he's trying to indulge in something that he has a hard time believing isn't a bad thing. Certain passages of Easy Death and Occident make me wonder for a moment if these are great, but after mulling it over for a while I decided fleeting impressions of greatness mean they can't be great because it wouldn't be fleeting if they were. Instead, they're pretty good.\n\nJulian Schnabel - Paintings from 1978 to 1987 - Vito Schnabel - ***.5\n\nThese old plate paintings make me see for the first time the overt ridiculousness of the technique as it was originally received, instead of as a dull kitsch cliché from the near-comatose imagination of an artist far too rich and famous for his own good. I mean I'm sure he's quite content, but it's made his work suffer. I'm still not that swayed by the plates in general, although Australia is a truly insane painting, but they start to work when put in tandem with all his other working methods as a testament to his hubris. Hubris isn't everything, or even all that much, but it does lead to stuff that is distinctively outrageous in retrospect, viz. Alas. The '80s death of painting was, clearly, a more fertile death than the our undead zombified present.\n\n4/26/2024\n\nLynn Hershman Leeson - Anti-Aging - Bridget Donahue - ***\n\nI'm a bit biased against Lynn Hershman Leeson because we once got into a pretty contentious argument in a Q&A maybe seven years ago; I asked a question about the disintegration of the art scene because artists were getting priced out of San Francisco (where we were) and she brushed it off with a Boomerism about how art happens if you try hard and believe in yourself or whatever, which was pretty curt especially considering how she'd just been talking about her Floating Museum project, which included Michael Asher getting a National Endowment for the Arts to put some pieces of wood on a staircase. I said so, one of her collaborators quipped back that, actually, paint was more expensive in the '70s and you had to mix it yourself, so, obviously, no one can possibly say if things are better or worse now... Anyway, credit where it's due, her interest in tech, AI, digital identity, gender identity, etc., should be something I can't stand on paper, but she's much less braindead than most purveyors of those signifiers these days. Her drawings and prints in particular play with the skewed distance between one's internal sense of self and the presentation/representation of oneself through media, which is actually how things are, i.e. fucked up and nonsensical, unlike the contemporary trend of affirming categorical identities as uncomplicated and fully coextensive with interiority. This certainly isn't my kind of art and the sci-fi narrative of the video work got an eyeroll, but she's intentionally messy and ridiculous in a way that avoids most of what I really can't stand from most work enveloped in these concerns.\n\nMelvin Way - CO2 Blues: The Art of Melvin Way (1989-2024) - Andrew Edlin - ***.5\n\nAs usual for Edlin, an outsider artist scrawling on bits of paper, in this case sprawling chemical equations that occasionally expand to the point of turning into images but mostly don't. What's more engaging are his cumulative procedures, whether in the entropic well-worn quality of all these fragments, folded and packed into his bags and pockets and suitcases (of which there's examples on display), taped to each other or just to stop them from falling apart, or the Xerox reproductions of old drawings reincorporated into new ones. The lived-in, labored-over quality of it all is appealing and enveloping even if, of course, it's all incomprehensible.\n\nGeneviève Asse, Anna-Eva Bergman, Terry Haass, Hans Hartung, Georges Mathieu, Serge Poliakoff, Gérard Schneider, Pierre Soulages, Maria Helena Vieira da Silva, Wols, Zao Wou-Ki - The New School of Paris Through Its Pioneering Women (1945-1964) - Perrotin - **\n\nOh okay, this is like if you took all the worst tendencies of midcentury abstraction and discarded all the good ones. These are too stiff and too decorative, tentative but also arrogantly overconfident, squandering the opportunity to indulge in color, structurally lazy and unadventurous. No wonder it's at Perrotin!\n\nFlorian Pumhösl - Lithosphere - Miguel Abreu - *.5\n\nAh Florian, my second review ever and my first negative one. He's changed up from his top-down views of canals, but these might be even worse. All I see are stacks of boutique handmade paper or, at best, piles of flagstones. Come on man...\n\nPaul Pagk - Recent Works on Paper - Miguel Abreu - ***.5\n\nInventive and kind of cute, almost funny, even. These drawings are more dynamic than his paintings because the messiness takes center stage and pushes against his tendency towards polish and restraint. That begs the question, why are his paintings more restrained? Who told him he has to be intellectual and austere? I guess that's always my question with Miguel Abreu, is any of this rational philosophy helping the art? In my experience it rarely does, if ever.\n\nStephen Willats, SoiL Thornton, Heji Shin, Coumba Samba, Charline von Heyl, John Duff, Nicolas Ceccaldi, Merlin Carpenter - Zone - Reena Spaulings - **.75\n\nWillats: Pretentious but not terrible fake science textbook illustrations, Dan Walsh at Paula Cooper was doing a similar visual directionality thing but much more forcefully and appealingly (Note: he takes up most of the show.) - ***\n\nThornton: SoiL's ego trip overdose continues unabated, I'm getting flashbacks to the Simon Denny show. Embarrassing. The glow-in-the-dark paint just adds to the insult. - *\n\nShin: Pretty picture. - ***\n\nSamba: They feel out of place and overly innocuous but aren't outright heinous. - **.5\n\nvon Heyl: Just enough combined layers of dumb to work well together. - ***.5\n\nDuff: I like these more than most of his solo show, the industrial ad-hoc construction combines with the nearly non-composition to hover perfectly in the \"zone\" of not quite an artwork but not not an artwork either. - ***.5\n\nCeccaldi: God, I'm going to puke, and he did it three times? - *.5\n\nCarpenter: Brilliantly stupid, if only because I know he has some Marxist interpretation that goes along with it to triple down on its stupid negativity to such a degree that it approaches ingenuity in spite of itself. They look good too, weirdly. - ****\n\nTotal: 3 + 1 + 3 + 2.5 + 3.5 + 3.5 + 1.5 + 4 = 22 / 8 = 2.75.\n\nMichelle Grabner and B. Wurtz - Laurel Gitlen - **.5\n\nBoth artists are quaint and, again, almost funny, although I wish Wurtz took it a lot further. My favorite part is that I can't tell if there's an Op Art effect in Grabner's ginghams or if it's just my eyes. I guess it's there? My least favorite part is that that's the only thing that interested me.\n\n4/25/2024\n\nMartin Wong, Paul P. - The Midnight Sea, A Little Dash of LSD - PPOW - **.5\n\nI like Martin Wong's paintings. I know, I know, call me crazy! These drawings just remind me of bad acid trips though, and I don't appreciate being reminded of that feeling where everything starts looking like that and you know you're going to be stuck with it for another 8-10 hours. It is interesting how they have no resemblance to his paintings, so I appreciate their contrast within his body of work. No such luck with Paul, whose sketchbooking is positively wimpy by comparison. The lithographs are casually enjoyable scenes of nature, but pretty much everything else is just bracingly dull. I mean, really, if the show wasn't narrativized as an intergenerational dialogue of two queer makers, wouldn't his work just be a collection of ineffectual sketches by an unexceptional traditionalist artist?\n\nAndrew Wyeth - Enter Andrew Wyeth - Schoelkopf - ***.5\n\nWyeth is, of course, an exceptional traditionalist artist. As someone who never marvels at the precision of virtuosic details, I found myself marveling at the details. The two tempera paintings are particularly impressive, like the two stick sprouting out and casting their shadow on the boulder in Far from Needham. It's not anywhere near a major survey but Wyeth is pretty undeniable as far as reactionary conservative figuration goes.\n\nArthur Jafa - BLACK POWER TOOL AND DIE TRYNIG - 52 Walker - **\n\nI'm sure he has a reason for making most of these prints extremely low-res, but they're not helping to convince me of anything. Sure, these pictures \"look cool,\" but the overt formal copycatting of Cady Noland and Richard Prince is essentially just namedropping, to say nothing of the literal namedrop function of photos of Foucault, Adrian Piper, Jimi Hendrix, Miles Davis, etc. The press release asserts that this work approaches art from a \"decidedly Black, non-Western perspective\" but I don't see how except on the level of surface aesthetics. The actual content is completely ensconced in Western art traditions, to the point of being naked derivative. Even the design aesthetic is flashy and luxurious, which are not qualities I think of as non-Western. It pains me to have to keep complaining about Tumblr art, but I can't see this work as more than an aesthetic blog plus a production budget to make it physical. To be honest I almost like Jafa's work, there's a blunt negativity that does remind me of Prince and Noland in a good way, but it's spoiled by all this ostentation over this work being meaningful and important, how it's somehow doing the work of addressing race relations in the United States. I'm not saying that race in America isn't a problem or that it shouldn't be addressed, just that I'm irritated by the pretension. \"Ah yes, but of course this cutout of a famous person in a dark room is changing the world before our very eyes!\" If people were basically literate about the history of modernism they'd realize that the avant-garde drive to reinvent society is one of the most fraught and least readily granted forces on earth, even in revolutionary eras, let alone our dissolute present. But then what would the curators at all the institutions do if they realized that?\n\nNoel Neri - Visual Koans: Sculpture and Works on Paper - George Adams - *.5\n\nGeneric minimalism trying to convince itself that it's not contrived by tacking on a bunch of Buddhist titles, but it's not fooling me. I'm as big a fan of Buddhism as anyone else but the ecstatic hippie brain is at odds with the artistic temperament, it's too easily satisfied. If you're already blissed out on life then art isn't for you, and, if the Buddhism here is an attempt at compensation for being very much not blissed out, that just makes the work sadder.\n\nJoe Hoyt, Chase Wilson - Disappearance of the Spokes - Galerie Timonier - ***.5\n\nWilson's paintings are refreshingly hard to pin down, his shapes are apparently influenced by lace and ornament but they mainly remind me of abstracted saxophones, I guess because of all the yellow. Hoyt's are precious and procedural, perhaps they're less immediately captivating but they do achieve a unique effect. Their moodiness isn't too interesting to me, but then his tiny sketches are surprisingly divergent and suggest a fertility of imagination that improves the impression I have of the paintings. To be honest, I got caught into talking with the gallerist because they'd run out of checklists, which I usually don't do because it distracts me from thinking about the art. As such my impression of the show is kind of unsettled, but it was a pleasant surprise of something different, if not exactly new.\n\nSonya Rapoport - Digital Mudra (1986-89) - Bibeau Krueger - ***\n\nA feminist index of hand gestures combined with the Eastern inflection of mudras. As social critique quasi-sociology art there's not much depth to the inquiry in comparison to someone like Marianne Wex but, thankfully, the vintage photos layered with painted mudras on plexi plus the image captions layered with the poem on the plexi is lightly humorous, not too affectated by spirituality like Neri and not too self-serious either. It's actually kind of fun, as is reinforced by the slideshow of newspaper clippings of comics and photos of politicians.\n\n4/19/2024\n\nAlighiero Boetti - Insecure Unconcerned - Sprüth Magers - ***.5\n\nI've seen a few Boettis here and there, mostly the rug pieces, and although the work made a favorable impression I didn't know anything about him outside of obvious inference that he's a quirky Italian. This show tidily contexualizes him as an arch randomcore conceptualist, and the show's central work, a portfolio of eighty-one extremely various works on paper, quite accurately anticipates a certain kind of Tumblr aesthetic. That's usually a less than positive reference point in my book, but, instead of the usual Tumblr stereotype of merely recapitulating an obvious surface style, Boetti does the good Tumblr move where style is systematically resisted until that eventually carves out a distinct sensibility by negating established sensibilities. A lot of the work would be ephemeral or boring on its own but the cumulative inconsistency adds up to something far more interesting to the sum of the parts; all these goofy non-drawings only manage to look cool in the company of all the other goofy non-drawings. I don't know what to make of the artworks bleeding seamlessly into the ephemera in the back room. Maybe that's a good thing?\n\nAlexander Calder - Calder - Gray - ***\n\nI enjoy Calder, who doesn't? He's one of the few sculptors of his generation where what he was working through remains immediate and undiminished with time, an accessible entry point to modern sculpture that for once articulates its concerns obviously. The thing is that the space is dominated by Clouds over Mountains, a huge, angular floor piece, and I don't like it. It's sleek and comparatively simplistic, and I assume it was commissioned to outside fabricators. Even if it wasn't, it feels that way. His other works have a handmade delicacy and lack of polish that adds to their elegance, an almost organic warmth that makes their lilypad/constellation forms more convincing, and as they get smaller they get proportionally more precious. I distinctly remember seeing video of his Circus my freshman year of college where a miniature acrobat jumped onto a horse or something (it doesn't seem to be in the clips I could find online) that impressed on me almost for the first time that artists can sometimes do things that seem impossible. I don't really care about what I thought when I was 18, but the finesse of Calder's touch seems integral to what I like about his work. I didn't know he did the terrazzo in front of the building, which is a nice little bit of urbanist trivia.\n\nPer Kirkeby - Paintings on Masonite and Bronzes - Michael Werner - ****\n\nThese Masonite paintings force me to think of a passage from T. J. Clark's Farewell to an Idea where he contrasts Asger Jorn to American abstractionists, its substance being that European painters are incapable of escaping the condition of painting as \"refinement.\" No matter how garish or ridiculous his paintings became, it was impossible for him to achieve the brute vulgarity of his American counterparts. The same observation applies exactly to Kirkeby, and as a case in point, Kirkeby's crudeness has no crudity, his attempts at being unhinged are shrewd and controlled, his clashing forms and colors retain a tastefulness, etc. That's not a value judgment; I don't prefer refined crudity over vulgar crudity or vice versa, they're just different. Even Clark, who refers to Jorn as the greatest painter of the 1950s, comes off equivocal by adding a paragraph later that he had very few good paintings, let alone great ones. What's interesting about this exhibition is the clear consistency across four decades; the chalkboard works from the '70s and others from the '10s don't suggest any datedness in the former or any particular stylistic developments in the latter. They're the product of a formal system and a language in spite of the apparent chaos, it just so happens to be a particularly loose system. That surface freedom, approached with his inborn sophistication, creates a consistent inconsistency that's subtle and unburdened, and where many American abstractionists eventually found themselves trapped in the blunt repetition of their signature style, these feel comparatively inexhaustible. I'm not particularly drawn to the sculptures but they don't bother me, their alternating phallic/yonic forms are so unformed that, except for the one nearest to the front windows with a funny conehead face, I can't find a way into considering them.\n\nRay Johnson - Paintings and Collages 1950-66 - Craig Starr - ***\n\nEarly Johnson works on his mandala shit, which look like tasteful 90s greeting cards from a distance but turn out to be so intricate and meticulous up close that they mostly overcome that first impression. Some of the more overtly assembled work in the back flirts with some of the sillier elements of Surrealism, like Ernst's collages, and for some reason makes me think of David Lynch's art, which is to say it totters on the edge of cheesiness. These never quite cross the line, but they're still very far from the distinctions of his best-known work.\n\nAmadeo Luciano Lorenzato - David Zwirner - **.5\n\nPleasant but too schematic, there's nothing to chew on.\n\nMadeline Bach, Isabelle Brourman, Sedrick Chisom, Steve DiBenedetto, Louis Eisner, Georgia Gardner Gray, Dan Herschlein, Madeleine Hines, Bradford Kessler, Tarwuk, Olivia Van Kuiken, Hans Bellmer, Lee Bontecou, Arshile Gorky, Unica Zürn, Cy Twombly - Manic Pixie Nightmare Drawings - Adler Beatty - **\n\nI suppose we're supposed to gather something from the juxtaposition of long-dead canonical artists and these contemporary up-and-comers, but the only successful nightmare drawings are the old ones. That is, unless you count the Trump piece which is, naturally, a nightmare of a faux pas. The rest of the young artists seem to think they're far more adventurous and cultivated and interesting than they are, which is only emphasized by how neatly they've been outdone by their elders. If any of them had any of the sprawling energy of Bontecou or Twombly, let alone Gorky, that would be one thing, but...\n\nFrançoise Gilot - Rosenberg & Co. - **.5\n\nIn one of the great upsets of the century, it turns out that Picasso's lover was not Picasso's artistic equal. The '40s works like White and Red Still Life or Joy VIII have moments of exuberance, but her portraits are forced caricatures and most of her abstractions are stiff and withdrawn, although August Stillness has a nicely alien compositional sense. She's decently talented in a casual way when she's not trying too hard, but considering her natural anxiety of influence it's not surprising that that wasn't very often. Picasso's outsize stature ruined whole generations of painters, what hope did she have after living with him for a decade?\n\nLarry Poons - One For Baby - Yares Art - ***.5\n\nThe man stays busy for an 86-year-old! Hell, this much painting in the span of a year is impressive at any age. On the other hand, these are almost one-note, but that note has plenty enough going on in it to bear repeating. Between Augustine and Lenny Burma are particular standouts, where the bleed between color and shape approaches a totalizing psychedelic indulgence you get in the better late Richters, but others like Four Wall Around Me beg the question of whether the world really needs another giant splattered abstract painting, which seems to be the consequence whenever he dials back the colorism. Brand new paintings this good are scarce, to say the least, but in comparison to the retrospective he had here a year"
