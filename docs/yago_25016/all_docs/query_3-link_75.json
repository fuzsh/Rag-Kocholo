I have been watching for over 30 years as my grandmother watched it and it was on when I stayed at her house after school.\n\nWho are your favorite characters?\n\nWhich is your favorite couple?\n\nWhich character would you like to wring their neck?\n\nMy favorite characters are Harley, Gus, Michelle, Tony, Danny, Marina, Buzz, Alexandra, Jonathon and Sandy.\n\nMy favorite couples are Gus and Harley, Michelle and Tony and Marina and Danny, and Edmund and Cassie.\n\nThe character I would most like to knock some sense into is Cassie. I cheer everytime Jonathon or Dinah pull something on her.\n\nSo, anyone else want to comment, complain, etc. Join in the fun!\n\neeyore0062 said:\n\nHow many here watch Guiding Light?

Since when are Michelle/Tony and Marina/Danny couples?? I'm sorry but I have to say YUCK! Marina must be about 12. Okay, not really but I watched all the struggles between Danny and Michelle and I hate the way they changed her character after the explosion and memory loss.\n\nFavorite character is no more I'm sorry to say - Phillip, who was killed off by an yet unnamed person (my guess is Lizzy - also hate her).\n\nI got disgusted with GL and have only watched intermittently. I had trouble buying that Cassie could fall for Edmund considering he caused her to lose her baby, kidnapped her and tried to kill her, etc. What a crock!\n\nMy one nagging question is why they wrote off Richard if the actor wanted to stay and now he's playing Geoffrey (Jeffrey?) who is the spitting image of Richard. That is a stupid storyline.\n\nI miss the Bauer's. Ed, Mike, Rick (don't see him enough). I miss the Reardon's of years past. Tony and Anabelle - now that was a storyline. How about Nola? Kelly & Morgan? Ahhh, the good old days!\n\nI love the GL and have been a fan for many years. I don't get to see it everyday, but try to catch 30 minutes here and there.\n\nI like Reva and Buzz alot. My favorite couple is Gus and Harley. I really don't like Lizzie and would like to reach through the TV and give her what she deserves. I also don't like Jonathon or Dinah either.\n\nI like Cassie and would like to see her finally get her life straightened out and normal (is that possiblei n the soaps??) and have the baby she is truly wanting with Edmond.\n\nI'm also ready for them to reveal who killed Phillip and get back to a good story with Rick and some of the others that aren't in the spot light right now.\n\nI am LOVING the Phillip storyline and the whodunit. I think they have done a great job bringing in the entire town in this umbrella story.\n\nI love Michelle and Tony together... she is so much freer and cuter with him. I never liked Michelle and Danny since Nancy St Alban took the part after Joie Lenz left. Nancy just didn't have the spark. However, the new Marina (who is about 20 now) looks and has the same characteristics as Joie Lenz's Michelle. She and Danny ROCK! His face just LIGHTS UP with he sees her, just like he did with Joie's Michelle.\n\nLove Jeffrey and am so glad they wrote out Richard. Could never stand he and Cassie, and as far as Cassie is concerned, I love that Dinah and Jonathon are bringing her down a peg or 2. Also, love that Reva is standing by her evil son... the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, as Reva was pretty bad when she 1st came to town. Tom Pelphrey, who plays Jonathon is one of the finest actors around.\n\nGlad they killed Phillip.... there was little more they could do with that character after he destroyed Harley's house and kidnapped everyone's kids. There was nothing of the old Phillip left by that point.\n\nI love Gus and Harley and hope that they can get back together.\n\nNot too fond of Sebastian and Holly... but would LOVE to see Sebastian and Dinah together... would that not FREAK Blake out?\n\nI think that Guiding Light is better than it has been since the early 90's when it was winning all of those Emmys and hope that this year will be a banner year for them. They certainly do have quite a wealth of talent and are using everyone pretty evenly lately. May the LIGHT continue to burn!\n\nWho are your favorite characters? Love Reva (although my husband is always complaining that she looks old - give the lady a break!) Buzz is fabulous. I still miss Michael Zazlow. There really hasn't been such a multi-faceted villian since Roger.\n\nWhich is your favorite couple? Harley and Gus\n\nWhich character would you like to wring their neck? Holly is awfully whiny lately - hope they give her something exciting soon.\n\nI've been watching Guiding Light since the early 80s. I graduated with Bess and Rick and Mindy and Phillip. Why am I now 40 and they are still so dang young???\n\nI'm confused again, lol. I thought I caught a piece of Harley's trial earlier this week or last and Lizzie was on the stand confessing to killing her dad but now I see Harley still on trial??? Was that a dream sequence? I was hoping Lizzie did kill Phillip so she can go to jail and leave - I'm sick of her character.\n\nI looked up the bio on Nancy St Alban (Michelle Santos) and sure enough she is pg with #2 and due in May or June. I figured from the way they're showing/not showing her. Anyway, while I was researching I came across a cast list and Reva is listed as Reva Shayne Lewis Lewis Spaulding Lewis Cooper Lewis Lewis - I don't remember several of those but I couldn't help but laugh!\n\nGlad to hear Matt and Vanessa are returning. I can't remember, was Vanessa fully recovered when they left town?\n\nLizzie was confessing to Carl's murder...because she figured they wanted her to confess to something so she would. It was pretty stupid.\n\nMaybe it was Jeffrey that killed Philip. That would be a plot twist!\n\nI wasn't watching when Matt & Vanessa left. I saw up to when Vanessa was in Switzerland or wherever at the hospital, but must have gone back to work right after that. There's a lot that I've missed over the years due to work -- darn work! I've been taping it again for about 4 years though...\n\nHmmm, who would I bring back? Maybe Mindy. Maybe Dylan. Maybe AC Mallett.\n\noK, I am one of those guys who likes soaps. GL is my favorite. Grew up watching it with my grandmother after school and snuck back to the dorms to watch it in college. Now, my whole family is hooked!'\n\nWho are my favorite characters... well, most are trouble makers (does that surprise you?) I like Jonathon (especially when he causes problems for Josh and Cassie), Edmund, Jeffrey, Tony and Michelle (don't want her to go back to being good... much more interesting now!), Harley, Gus, Marina, Blake, Sandy, Buzz, Alex and Reva. oh and Danny as long as he ISN'T with Michelle--- then he reverts to my least favorite list.\n\nLeast favorite characters: Holly, Ross, Alan, Josh, Cassie and Frank (all too high and mighty for words-- at least in their minds)\n\nWould most like to strangle: Alan (for destroying all of his kids), Lizzie (for letting Alan and Phillip destroy her), Dinah (she needs a real life), Cassie (can anyone be more self righteous and stupid at the same time?) and Holly (what a coo coo clock!)\n\nFavorite couples: Harley and Gus, Edmund and Cassie (as long as he keeps her from being to almighty righteous), Marina and Danny, Tony and Michelle, Sandy and Tammy and Lizzie and Coop.\n\nMost missed characters: Dylan and Bridget, Matt Reardon, Nola Reardon, Mindy Lewis, Roger, Drew and Jesse\n\nLeast missed characters: Vanessa, Phillip, Pilar, Carmen, Maureen, Ed, Prince Richard (ugh.... what a pretty boy cardboard cutout!)\n\nGlad to see there are still a few Guiding Light fans out here!\n\nI love Guiding Light! I have been watching it for almost 30 years also! This is the one hour of TV that I claim each day!\n\nI would have to say my favorite characters are Gus, Harley, Danny, Cassie (I know - I'm probably one of the few who likes her), Reva, and Sandy.\n\nLeast favorite characters would have to be - first and foremost - Lizzie (UGH!), Jonathan, Edmund, Tony, Alan, and Dinah.\n\nMy favorite couples at this time would have to be Gus and Harley and Tammy and Sandy. I have to say that I really miss Danny and Michelle. I think he loved her so much. I can't stand to see Cassie and Edmund together!\n\nI am thrilled to hear that Vanessa and Matt will be coming back. I also miss Tony and Annabelle."
