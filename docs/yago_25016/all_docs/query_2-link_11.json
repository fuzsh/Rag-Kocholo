        "text": "Quote sonia022: Okay, this is long but it's Susan/Daisy's history...read what you want (just gleam it)\n\nBrief Character History\n\nSusan was born in 1987 and given the name “Daisy” by her biological parents, Harley Cooper and her estranged boyfriend, Dylan. Unable to care for her daughter, Harley agreed to give her up for adoption to the LeMay family. In 1994, while still a child, Susan was diagnosed with a rare form of diabetes, so her natural father, Dylan Lewis, underwent surgery to donate part of his pancreas. Though the Lemays were grateful, they still refused to allow Dylan to see Susan.\n\nIn late 1998, Susan’s adoptive mother passed away and she was left alone with her father, Jim. Desperately wanting a mother in her life, she ran away to Springfield to find Harley. Harley and her husband, Phillip Spaulding, welcomed Susan, but called her father to let him know that she was o.k. When Jim arrived to bring her home, Susan begged him to let her stay and get to know her family. So in 1999, a reluctant Jim agreed and Susan stayed with the Spauldings. Susan manipulated the situation often, even faking sickness in order to stay with her mother longer. Susan was thrilled to have her mother in her life and relished in her new extended family. She even had the opportunity to meet Dylan at her grandmother, Reva’s, wedding. She had ALMOST everything she wanted. The only thing that could make her life perfect was if Harley and Jim were together. Susan made every attempt to create a romance between the two, but it was useless. Susan was forced to throw in the towel when Harley announced that she was pregnant with Phillip’s child. An angry Susan chose took off. Eventually, she came back and called Harley from the bus station. When Harley came to get her, the two were mugged and thankfully Jim saved them. Susan’s desire to have things the way she wanted had definitely gone too far.\n\nHarley understood why Susan didn’t want to stay with them, but still wanted her in town despite everything. To make his wife happy, Phillip, despite his own reservations about Susan, offered Jim a position as an accountant at Spaulding so that they could remain in Springfield. Jim refused at first, not wanting to take a handout, but Phillip eventually convinced him that it was the best option for everyone involved. Once settled in Springfield, Jim began dating Beth Raines Spaulding, Phillip’s ex-wife. Susan was not happy at all and went back to her manipulative ways to try to break them up. Luckily, Susan had made one friend that seemed to understand her. His name was Max Evans, an orphan that was staing with Drew Jacobs. The two formed a special friendship and even flirted a bit. Susan had a huge crush on the teen, but, in the end, he just wanted to remain friends. The two began spending all of their time together… usually getting into trouble. One night Susan and Max were hanging out at Company, the restaurant owned by her grandfather, Buzz Cooper. The two began smoking and ended up starting a fire and getting trapped inside. They were both rescued, but not before the restaurant was destroyed. Deciding that things had gone to far, Jim took Beth’s advice and sent Susan away to camp to straighten her out. Susan was furious and hated Beth even more than before. After time, Jim came to get her and she agreed to settle down.\n\nSusan held to her end of the bargain, but was still reluctant to accept Beth. She traveled to San Cristobel with her father, Beth, Phillip, Harley and Zach to spend Thanksgiving with Harley’s friend Cassie Layne and her fiancé, Prince Richard Winslow. Phillip and Beth were called back to Springfield on business and Jim agreed to fly them in a private jet that had been tampered with by Richard’s evil brother, Edmund. The plane crashed, leaving all three stranded. Jim was able to get help and they were rescued. When the returned to their families, Susan took on a whole new attitude. The experience of nearly losing her father left Susan realizing that she was wasting precious time by remaining angry about Beth. She told Jim that she would accept their relationship without anymore interference. An elated Jim proposed to Beth and things began to look up. There was a minor snag when Susan found out that Beth was pregnant. She was furious at first, but quickly got over it and stood by while the couple married. After settling into her new family and finally accepting Beth as her stepmother, Susan’s world was torn apart when she learned that the child Beth gave birth to wasn’t Jim’s, but Phillip’s! Angry that her stepparents cheated on her mother and father, Susan lashed out at everyone. Susan quickly forgave Beth, supporting her reconciliation with Jim, but never understood why Harley took Phillip back. That winter, Susan participated in Sam Spencer’s plan to make pirated CD’s of the band Nu Ground (on Phillip’s company computer no less), and nearly faced FBI charges before the band dropped the matter. Also around this time, she and Max drifted apart, with Max joining Drew in NYC.\n\nShortly before Christmas 2000, Jim died saving Lizzie and baby James in a fire. Susan was devastated. The wedge between mother and daughter grew even wider as she was unable to let Harley share her grief. Susan’s only sources of comfort were Beth, Lizzie, and Prince Edmund Winslow, who had befriended Beth months earlier. The three joined Edmund in San Cristobel, where Susan cautiously gave her approval to Edmund wooing her stepmother. Susan returned to Springfield, angry at anyone who criticized Edmund. In February, she and Harley finally made headway, with Susan admitting she knew Harley loved her, and only wanted what was best for her. But Susan felt out of place, unsure of where her life was. With Harley’s permission, she left for a boarding school focused on performing arts. Miraculously, she managed to mend fences with Phillip before she left. In May, Susan briefly returned to San Cristobel for Edmund’s coronation, wishing him the best. After spending summer break with Harley in Florida, Susan returned to boarding school in Europe. At some point, Susan went to New York to attend college."
