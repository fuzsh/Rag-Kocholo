        "text": "Guiding Light\n\nGuiding Light is the best soap on television, and one of my favorite shows. There is a reason that Soap Opera Digest and TV Guide picked it as the best soap of 1997. I've watched Guiding Light since I was eight years old. My mom used to watch it, so it was on when I got home from school. I've always been a huge fan of the show, and I watched it during the depressing, bad years of Tangie, Brent/Marian, Reva's ghost/Reva's Amish. There have been some good storylines, and there have been some really bad ones. There have been some characters that we loved and didn't want to leave (Mallet!!) and some characters that we've wanted to kill ourselves (Jesse, anyone?) But GL has been on through all the years, delivering quality entertainment to daytime television. One of my friends, who will remain nameless, gave up watching GL for General Hospital. Besides the obvious flaws in his personality, his reasoning behind the decision was this: GL is too mature; the storylines are aimed at grownups; when I watch a soap, I want it to be juvenile (he does watch Days...) He is right, GL is a mature soap. I could go on forever about the differences between GL and Days, but one of the main ones is character development - GL has lots of it and Days has practically none. All the characters on GL have good and bad personality traits. No one is perfect, and no one is irredeemably evil. (This is very unlike Days, in which the characters are entirely one-dimensional and have one motivation.) Take Dinah, played to nasty, humanistic perfection by Wendy Moniz. Dinah is a bitch; she's mean and vindictive. But, you also see the good Dinah at Vanessa's bedside hoping for her mother's return to the land of the living. And Reva, the fabulous (once) harlot with a heart of gold is no saint. (BTW, isn't it a little ironic that now Reva has a sister who's the stripper with a heart of gold?) Reva makes stupid mistakes sometimes. Like the Hart incident which occurred today, for example. But she's a good person most of the time, although definitely not all the time. So, here's the rundown on some of my fav couples and characters.\n\nMy Favorite Couples\n\nPhillip Spaulding (Grant Aleksander) and Harley Cooper (Beth Ehlers)\n\nI love Phillip and Harley together, so I guess that you would call me one of those Pharley people. Their relationship is so realistic, unlike most soap romances. I can't tell you how many times I have watched a soap (not GL) and wanted to slit my wrists watching some stupid couple proclaiming their undying love, while looking deeply into each other's eyes. Please! Phillip and Harley have passion, romance, and normal squabbles, misunderstanding, and laughs. They are everything a supercouple should be, and I really hope that they get the chance, since Beth has her sights (and other various portions of her anatomy) set on Phillip. I think one of the things that really works with them is that they are just so damn cute together. Both of them are just coming off of a bad breakup, both were betrayed by the one they loved, and both are quite scarred. Naturally, they wanted to take things slow (after they did it, of course.) But, you could tell that they were falling for each other, which was one of the most endearing things I have seen on a soap in a long time. I loved watching them fall in love, and I hope that now-bitch Beth doesn't break up this fabulous couple! One of the most ironic things about the Phillip/Harley pairing is that both of them were each a part of two of the most popular couples on GL: Phillip with Beth and Harley with Mallet. Amazingly, though, I like these two together much more that either couple before, though Harley/Mallet is a close call. Harley is definitely one of the best characters on GL, and Beth Ehlers is an outstanding actress, even on this soap, which has consistently excellent acting. Harley seems like one of your friends; she's down to earth, sometimes a little neurotic, but very sensitive and friendly inside. She fiercely loves her friends, and lets her enemies have it. Phillip, too, is an interesting character. I feel bad for his situation, because it is not one that I would ever want to be in. He is being torn in three different directions by three people that he loves in three different ways. Beth, his ex, he feels obligated to after the car incident, and also because she is the mother of his child. Lizzie, obviously, Phillip is very protective of and he needs to support her. And then there's Harley, the woman with whom Phillip is madly in love. The problem is that as he is being torn is all these directions, he usually puts Harley at the end of his list. This is understandably why Harley got so mad at him, though I would have to say that she was a little irrational ripping up the lease, but that's Harley for you. All in all, these two make a great pairing, and I hope to see a lot more of them in the future.\n\nBlake (Liz Keifer) and Ross (Jerry ver Dorn) Marler\n\nBlake and Ross are so much fun! They have been one of the best couples on GL for a long time. Unfortunately, they haven't been featured as the sexy, happy, fun couple that they are, recently. Blake's little obsession with Ben certainly isn't helping matters any. I can kind of see why Blake is drawn to Ben Warren (Hunt Block.) Ben is tall, handsome, and he is a real bad boy. Blake has always been drawn to the bad boys -- Alan Michael Spaudling case in point. Blake has really changed a lot since she has been involved with Ross. Of course, she started dating Ross to screw with her mom, Holly, whom I've never liked much anyway. I was hoping for Ross and Blake to get together. They were very passionate about each other, but they were also very tender with each other. I bet Blake didn't guess that she would be falling in love with Ross when she started this whole thing! Blake's one fall, was of course, sleeping with Rick. Actually, technically that whole thing was date rape, since Blake was drunk, and Rick did know that, but hey, no one really seemed to care. I'm going to posit a little theory here. I believe that Ross is actually the father of both the twins, and Annie changed the test results to get Blake on her team. I felt bad for Blake during that ordeal. Annie was such a bitch blackmailing Blake, but Blake loved Ross so much that she would have done anything to hold on to him. Thankfully, Ross did finally understand that, and forgave Blake after a long separation. All Blake wants now is to be happy with her husband, after he has given her a second chance, and now she is plagued with thoughts of Ben. Hopefully, Blake won't succumb to her temptations. I would be really mad if she did, because I seriously doubt that she would do that after finally getting him back.\n\nCassie Layne (Laura Wright) and Hart Jessup Thorpe (Frank Grillo)\n\nMy Favorite Characters\n\nAnnie Dutton (Cynthia Watros)"
