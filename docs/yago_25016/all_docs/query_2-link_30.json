I _heard_ he went to Ellen about\n\nhis problems of the story when the changeover happened. Ellen heard him,\n\nbut getting out of the maze of what they had done to the story, well, it\n\ndidn't happen. Grant kept asking, pestering, talking about what makes\n\nsense for Phillip regarding Olivia, Zach, Harley, Gus, etc. I also heard\n\nthis was really frustrating for Ellen, but I have heard nothing that\n\nimplies she wasn't sympathetic, she just felt she didn't need it, Grant\n\ngave her no time to get her bearings (although to be fair, don't take\n\nthe job if you can't immediately handle it IMO).\n\nSo basically Grant wasn't willing to keep waiting for things to pick up\n\nand make some darn sense again (and then the stories got even more\n\nridiculous which really cut into his patience) and other cast members\n\nare. It created an obvious difference between he and the rest of the\n\ncast and he was taken to slaughter.\n\nThere MAY be more to it I haven't heard, but what was reported here\n\nseems about right.\n\n> >Another source, however, says that it\n\n> >wasn't Ellen's decision and the choice came from the top brass.\n\n>\n\n> This would be less surprising to me, if the above story is true.

It's up to TPTB to decide whether or not the\n\nenvironment on set is important enough to release an actor (and usually,\n\nthey don't).

Michael to my knowledge, despite liking his job, has rarely\n\nhesistated to speak his mind, even to soap press about his storylines\n\nand his job.

It really doesn't matter to me how you would describe him,\n\njust that is how it came across in your comments thus far based on some\n\nof the subsequent questions and replies from fellow posters.\n\n> This image that he's getting this punishment because he has integrity & the\n\n> other actors do not, by comparison, or even that the creative team doesn't,\n\n> since they're his foes, it just doesn't wash.\n\nI'm not sure anyone really has that impression here. I _do_ think people\n\nthink that complaining about his storylines, his lines, his character's\n\nmotivations, etc., isn't really a severe enough crime to get him fired,\n\nbut I doubt anyone thinks his complaints are altruistic and only for the\n\ngood of daytime.\n\n> He'd be doing this if he were doing Shakespeare in the Park.\n\nYeah, well, actors like Grant naturally gravitate to SITP, it's there\n\ntype of environment, constantly nitpicking how Shakespeare would want\n\neach moment interpreted, it's a snooty acting fest over there :)\n\n\n\nDonna B <shall...@optonline.net> wrote:\n\n: > What Donna said about Judi I would completely agree with.

Of course it was cancelled early on.\n\nGILMORE GIRLS^ - I loved it when it began. Last year I loved maybe half or\n\nless of it. No idea how it will be this year. Not optimistic.\n\nTRU CALLING won't even be on till midseason, if then, because of unexpected\n\nproblems. I'm going to check out CSI/NY because of Sinise.

And, it's very worthwhile, too. It brings Shakespeare with great\n\nplayers & makes it accessible to people it otherwise wouldn't.\n\nPersonally, I honestly think that GA & many other NY veteran soap actors\n\nhave brought a wealth of goodies to soaps.\n\nIn rec.arts.tv.soaps.cbs on Tue, 14 Sep 2004 00:40:56 GMT in Msg.#\n\n> Donna B wrote:\n\n> >\n\n> > In rec.arts.tv.soaps.cbs on Sun, 12 Sep 2004 02:12:34 GMT in Msg.#\n\n> > <4143AD...@pacbell.net>, Sarah <sar...@pacbell.net> wrote:\n\n> >\n\n> > > Donna B wrote:\n\n> > > >\n\n> > > > On Sat, 11 Sep 2004 in Msg.#<oXI0d.174728$mD.105083@attbi_s02>, Dana Carpender\n\n> > > > <dcar...@kivanospam.net> wrote:\n\n> > > > > Yell at them?\n\n...\n\n> Well the question was asked, and I tried to answer it based on what I\n\n> knew, that's all.\n\nI get that, too, completely. As an actor, I think Grant knows that at times\n\nhe has thrown tantrums, or hissy fits, or whatever we want to call them,\n\nbut, I don't think any of this is about his shouting at a co-worker. NOT at\n\nall. Ever. If there is tension involved with working with him because of\n\ndiffering styles or because of things he's taking issue with where it\n\ncreated tension for people involved in stories with him, that is very\n\ndifferent from his making any kind of direct abuse of his co-workers. I do\n\nnot think the latter applies & I don't think it would even if his vocal\n\nchords didn't matter to him, if you see what I mean.\n\nI've done a very poor job in this whole discussion of trying to make\n\nproactive statements about what I thought instead of trying to react to\n\nother people's words. And, I became very dissatisfied with what it sounded\n\nlike I meant. Maybe this is one little bit that makes that better.\n\nNow, I've been trying to find out a little bit more out about GL [and ATWT\n\ntaping practices] ... and stuff. And, I've learned that, as a general rule,\n\nproduction is not stopped, period, once taping has begun *for* a veteran\n\nactor, that they are all too professional for that. Sure, it might get\n\nstopped, even though we know they don't stop much, re-tape extremely rarely\n\nif at all. Maybe the booth needs to stop tape for some reason - but very\n\ndifferent from what was described here, if you see what I mean.\n\nI got the impression that the P&G soaps tolerate much less of what I'm going\n\nto call 'actor stuff' than ABC does. And, that they tolerate less than the\n\nWest Coast soaps do, too.\n\nRight now both ATWT & GL have rehearsals of a sort in the morning. Not on\n\nset, in the rehearsal hall, with the director of the day, they go over\n\nscenes & get blocking. Offset they run lines together, either in that same\n\nrehearsal hall or some place else. On set they rehearse but just for tech,\n\nfor the booth, for the lights to be set, for anything to be changed in\n\nblocking if it doesn't look right once they're actually on the set space &\n\nthe lights are there. Then, they tape. They used to have a rather full\n\nrehearsal after the tech rehearsal but some years back they cut it out. [ABC\n\nstill does that rehearsal & that's apparently the rehearsal Sarah Joy Brown\n\nspoke of missing with ATWT going so fast & having to get used to it.]\n\nGiven this stuff I've learned I have now begun to doubt that what WEEKLY\n\nreported was true. Lessons, there are always new lessons for me to learn.\n\nMeanwhile I'm just going to doubt, period, for now.\n\n--\n\nDonna B 8^> Yahoo Messenger: shallotpeel <*>"
