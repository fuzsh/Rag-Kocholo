        "text": "When I check to see what searches bring people to this site, one of the frequent search is about Harley Cooper’s walls. What happened was this – when Phillip first came back from Arizona determined to get revenge on whatever family member (he wasn’t sure for a long while who – it was Alan) that had arranged his exile and reclaim his rightful place. Beth was frightened that this would turn him in the Alan-clone that he sometimes could be and so filed for divorce to try to force his hand to give it up and return for her. When he instead allowed the divorce to proceed Beth felt that the worst had already happened and Phillip was lost. Cut ahead almost a year and Phillip had found first friendship and then love with his once and future sister-in-law Harley Cooper. Then Beth returned and she tried to win him back. Harley felt that despite the storied Pheth history that Harley herself understood Phillip better than Beth and that they belonged together. Phillip temporarily chose Harley and they eloped and then bought a new house. This new house was multi-storied and very southwestern complete with a red tile roof and adobe walls.\n\nFlash forward a few more years when Harley found out that Beth shockingly enough really HAD understood Phillip better than she did, all along. Harley decided then that Phillip had become evil incarnate and treated him accordingly helping to propel his descent to madness. When Gus and Harley’s efforts to stop Phillip from recreating Springfield according to his new all Spaulding design, Phillip got his revenge by knocking down the house that he had bought for Harley and still retained legal ownership to. Harley couldn’t stop him, but did get legal ownership of the now empty lot.\n\nGus and Harley slowly began to rebuild the house which at first seemed to be about the same size as the one they lost, but then turned into what seemed to be a sort of modified ranch on a much more modest scale. It was not finished for years. As their portrayers said in an interview “Harley and Gus seemed to run out of money about the same time the show did.” This lead them to having obviously unfinished walls for a long time – years in fact. Actually the unfinished walls outlasted the marriage. It wasn’t until Gus died in a tragic motorcycle accident (that lead to his heart being transplanted into Olivia Spencer saving her life and ultimately spawning Otalia) that the Cooper family was spurred to finish off the house in a sort of barn raising type family gathering. Shortly after that Harley also left the show and Marina and Mallet purchased the now finished house.\n\nUPDATED July 30 2016: I did some light editing, fixing a few minor points, and adding a better description of the Pharley house before it was knocked down. I also added my current signature block.\n\nUPDATED August 2 2017: I noticed two typos and fixed them.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.
