        "text": "Q: Jeffrey looks identical to Richard, but there’s still confusion regarding how and why they look alike. What’s the deal?A: Jeffrey came to Springfield in 2003. It was later revealed that he was a teenage criminal who made an agreement with the CIA to work for the agency if they got him out of prison. After his face was severely damaged in a fight, the agency offered to reconstruct it to look exactly like Richard’s so he could work undercover in San Cristobel to impersonate Richard at events during his reign as prince.\n\nQ: Who are the fathers of Harley’s children?A: Harley’s three children have three different fathers. She conceived daughter Susan (who now goes by the name Daisy) with then-boyfriend Dylan Lewis while still a teenager, but Harley gave the baby up for adoption to the Lemay family.She since moved back in with Harley. Harley’s ex-husband Phillip Spaulding is son Zach’s (full name Alan Cooper Spaulding) dad, while son Jude is the product of Harley’s one-night stand with Phillip’s best friend Rick Bauer.\n\nQ: Since they are both Alan Spaulding’s sons, how is it that Phillip and Gus aren’t biologically related?\n\nA: Both Phillip and Gus are adopted. Phillip was bought as an infant by Alan Spaulding when Alan’s child with wife Elizabeth was stillborn (Alan felt Elizabeth couldn’t handle the truth of the death of their child). When the Spauldings later divorced, Alan wed Phillip’s biological mother Jackie Scott, and Elizabeth married Phillip’s biological father, Justin Marler. The marital merry-go-round was short-lived, and Jackie and Justin reunited. When Elizabeth suddenly left Springfield, Phillip was sent to live with Jackie and Justin — without being told that they were actually his biological parents. Phillip eventually learned his true parentage as a teen. Gus was raised by Joe and Angela Augustino, but his birth mother was Phillip’s nanny, Regina Tessori, who had an affair with Spaulding patriarch Alan. Alan’s sister Alex arranged for Gus to be adopted by the Augustinos, and Gus did not learn the truth about his birth until he was an adult.Q: Billy and Reva used to be married? What’s the story behind that?A: Reva sure likes to keep it in the family…. This tale began off-screen. Reva’s mother Sarah was the Lewis family housekeeper back in Tulsa, and Reva and Josh became childhood sweethearts. However, the duo broke off their relationship when he left for college. Reva then married Josh’s brother, Billy, as revenge. They divorced after eight years. In 1983 Reva was paid by Alan Spaulding to come to Springfield and break up Billy and Vanessa by claiming her divorce to Billy was invalid. The scheme went bust when Billy found the legal divorce papers. Reva then married Josh and Billy’s father, H.B., before reuniting with her Bud. And if that’s not enough drama, it was later revealed that Billy and Reva had a son together! After his adoptive parents died in a car crash ex-convict Dylan arrived in Springfield in search of his biological parents. When Billy accidentally hit Dylan with his car, he and Reva took him in. It was then that Reva noticed the birthmark on Dylan’s knee, realizing that he was the infant she gave up for adoption.\n\nQ: Dinah was a carny?A: Believe it or not, it’s true. The cunning business woman you see now once traveled the country with the bearded lady. It all started when Dinah was put up for adoption by her biological mother, Vanessa, and adopted by the Carter family. When Mr. and Mrs. Carter were tragically killed in a car accident, Dinah was placed with The Little Angels founding home. She was later taken in by the Morgan family and although she became quite close to the other young girl the family took in, Adele, Dinah fled, thinking the Morgans didn’t want her. Soon Dinah met up with the Kowalskis, a carny family. Dinah and the Kowalski family traveled the country with the carnival, but Dinah eventually tired of the venue. In 1986 a teenaged Dinah arrived in Springfield in search of her sister, Adele, and ran into happy couple Phillip Spaulding and Beth Raines. The rest, as they say, is homicidal history.\n\nQ: Why were Josh and Reva back together for such a short period of time?A: Head Writer David Kreizman says: “We wanted Reva’s cancer diagnosis to hit her like a bolt of lightning. She’s just putting her life back together, finally reunited with the man she loves and then suddenly everything changes. A time that should’ve been one of her happiest suddenly becomes something very different. We chose to make her cancer diagnosis a Wednesday episode for the same reason — so that the viewers might experience this upsetting jolt right along with Reva.”\n\nQ: Why was Rick not punished for his role in Ross’s death? Kreizman explains, “Well, because what he did caused the crash, but it wasn’t actually illegal. It was supposed to keep the plane grounded and it got out of hand, so he didn’t actually do anything that was punishable by law.”\n\nQ: What’s the deal with Dinah and Cassie?A: Hart and Dinah were a couple when Cassie came to town. Hart dallied with Cassie and broke up with Dinah to be with his new love. Soon, Dinah guilted Hart into marrying her. Although they tied the knot, Cassie was secretly pregnant with Hart’s child. When he found out, he left Dinah. Cassie gave birth to his son, RJ, in 1999. Early that year, completely jealous and obsessed with Hart and Cassie’s relationship, Dinah went to the farm, intent on shooting Cassie. Hart took the bullet for Cassie and later died.\n\nQ: Why is Blake sometimes called Chrissy?A: Blake was born Christina Blake Bauer in 1975. Her mother, Holly, was married to Ed at the time, but Roger was her biological father. As a girl, the tot was called Chrissy. In 1988, an adult Chrissy returned to town and went by her middle name so that people would not know to whom she was connected.\n\nQ: How many children does Reva have?A: Four: Dylan, Marah, Shayne and Jonathan. As a young adult, Reva and Billy had Dylan, but she gave the baby up for adoption. Reva was reunited with him — and Billy learned of his existence — in 1989. Reva gave birth to Marah in 1987 and Shayne in 1990 (her kids with Josh). After Shayne’s birth, she experienced severe post-partum depression. She drove off a bridge and was presumed dead. In actuality, she had amnesia and married Prince Richard. Together, they had Jonathan, who eventually was adopted because Reva (then called Catherine) feared for the boy’s life (Edmund wasn’t too fond of the tot). Jonathan turned up in Springfield to shake the family tree in 2004.\n\nQ: How many wives did Phillip have?A: Six: Mindy (1984), India (1984), Blake (1989), Beth (1991), Harley (1998) and Olivia (2004).\n\nQ: How many adult characters on the show were born on GL?A: Five. Rick (1970), Blake (1975), Alan-Michael (1981), Lizzie (1990) and Marina (1993). Jenna brought baby Coop to Springfield in 1996. Rick’s daughter Leah was born in 2004 and brought back as a rapidly-aged teenager in 2006. Daisy (then Susan) was born in 1987 and should be about 20 but in 2007 she was shown as still in high school."
