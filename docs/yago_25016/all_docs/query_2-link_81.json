        "text": "Cliff Hodges passed away peacefully at his daughter’s residence in Columbus, MS on Sunday, October 8, 2023, after a brief illness of Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nVisitation will be Wednesday, October 11, 2023, from 10 AM – 11 AM at Verona United Methodist Church, Verona, MS. A funeral service will follow at 11 AM with Bro. Jim McClurken officiating. A graveside will be Wednesday, October 11, 2023, at 3 PM at Community Baptist Church Cemetery, Columbus, MS with Lowndes Funeral Home, Columbus, MS directing.\n\nHe was born on February 18, 1932, to Steve Ellison “Eddie” and Mada West Hodges. He attended Itawamba Agricultural High School and Itawamba Junior College. He married Jennie Beth Ray Hodges on February 24, 1951. He was an active member of Verona United Methodist Church while living in Verona. At VUMC, he was a charter member of the Challenger Sunday School class. He and Beth lived in Verona for over 65 years, only moving to Columbus with their daughter when their health required it. After the death of his wife, he attended Community Baptist Church with his family.\n\nCliff served from 1952 to 1954 with the United States Army Signal Corp. He was stationed in Germany as a cryptographic repairman during the Korean Conflict. He worked for TKE Drug Store for 12 years before moving to Long’s Uniform Rental Service, which later became White Rose Rental Laundry. He worked there for 33 years, with the last 13 being as Branch Manager of the Tupelo Branch before retiring in May of 1997.\n\nHe always had a servant’s heart and truly enjoyed doing for others. He loved his church and served in many capacities over the years, some of which included local Lay Leader, Sunday School teacher, United Methodist Men President, Chairman of the Board, and Chairman of the PPR committee. He enjoyed helping maintain the churchyard. On the district level, he served as Lay Leader for the Tupelo-New Albany District and on the Conference Leadership team. He was a certified Lay Speaker and a member of the Annual Conference.\n\nHe was instrumental in getting a route for Meals on Wheels established in Verona. He coordinated the volunteer effort for this route for many years, as well as he and Beth helped deliver meals as well. He was a member of the Tupelo Luncheon Civitan Club where he and Beth volunteered as ushers at the Bancorp South Coliseum, as well as helping with fish cookings that the Civitan group cooked for. He served on the Flag team to display flags throughout town for holidays. When his grandson Nick would visit, they always included him in these activities. Cliff was one who taught his daughter and family to serve by example. He loved his family and was always available to help in any way that he could. He insisted on carrying his load as he grew older and lived with Debbie. Until June of 2023, he would run the weed-eater and keep limbs and debris picked up from the yard.\n\nHe is survived by one daughter, Debbie (Larry) Taylor; one grandson, Chris (Amanda); and two great-grandchildren, Madison and Clay Taylor. He was preceded in death by his parents, his brother Troy Hodges, his sister Georgie Young, his grandson Nick Taylor, and his wife of 70 years, Beth.\n\nThe family would like to say a special thank you to the team that helped provide for his care in recent weeks – his sitters – Sandra Bush and Nettie Harkins, and our Legacy Hospice family – Ashley Yarbrough, Tameika Williams, Karen Barrett, Trae Miller, and all other Legacy employees. You all have been a true blessing!\n\nIn lieu of flowers, contributions are encouraged to Verona United Methodist Church, PO Box 370, Verona, MS 38879; Meals on Wheels, c/o Methodist Senior Services, 2800 W. Main Street, Tupelo, MS 38801 or to the church or charity of the donor’s choice."
