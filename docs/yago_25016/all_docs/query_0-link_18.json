        "text": "Below is The Rustle of the Sheets storyline summary from Danny first walking into Millennium through the end of Reva Rescue Rangers Storyline during the Indian Summer.\n\nRepublisher’s Note: I fixed obvious typos, but did not edit actual content even though there are several mistakes in the summary apparently from how they were described before shooting. There are also in [brackets] some notes of descriptions of some scenes that weren’t included in the final versions of the episodes. Do a find control for a left hand bracket [ to find just these cut scenes. I had heard about the famous missing Psychology class scene, but not the others. The Michelle telling Danny about being blind was an especially important one to the story. Someone *Hint, Hint* should take a hand at writing them up as lost scenes. Not sure of where they got the synposes from. I wish I did.\n\nFind the original post:\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20120407081911/http://members.fortunecity.com/rustlingsheets/dmhistory.html\n\nDanny and Michelle’s Story\n\n[Author’s Note: The synposes are written before the airing and several times all of the scenes described don’t make it onto the air. Any scenes that I know of that didn’t, I will make a note of in square brackets.]\n\nNovember 11, 1998 . . . Mick’s brother Danny comes to Millennium, looking for answers to his brother’s death. His visit leaves the foursome unnerved — Jesse, Drew, Michelle and Bill –, especially Michelle.\n\nAt Millennium, Jesse asks Drew if there has been any sign of Danny. Drew tells him no and wonders why there should be. Jesse is sure that Danny isn’t through with them yet. Michelle tries to study but finds that she has trouble concentrating as she relives hitting Mick on the back of the head with a rock. Jesse sneaks up behind her and asks how she is doing. Michelle thinks that her dream of saving lives (medically) has been ruined by taking Mick’s life. Drew’s bartender quits on short notice; Danny walks in and offers to do the job. Drew is impressed with his knowledge of drinks and reluctantly hires him.\n\nNew barkeep Danny tells Drew that even though brother Mick was older, Danny played the “man of the house” after their father died. Jesse and Michelle discuss how she feels about killing a man. Jesse tells Michelle that Danny is out for revenge and that no one must ever know what really happened. Drew informs Michelle and Jesse that she hired Danny and they must play it cool. She is going to make Danny fall in love with her.\n\nDrew is in a drop dead gorgeous dress. She tells Bill, Jesse and Michelle about her plans to seduce Danny in order to distract him from finding out they killed Mick. She comes on to Danny. Danny brushes off Drew who only tries harder. He says he is only here to find Mick’s killer and that’s it. Drew is crestfallen. She lies to Jesse that Danny is attracted to her, but after Jesse keeps pushing her, she admits that Danny brushed her off. She adds that Danny scared her because he was so cold.\n\nLater, Danny questions Michelle. Drew is crying brokenheartedly to Jesse. She goes back to the “I killed someone” rant and Jesse hugs her. Danny continues to quiz Michelle and only succeeds in unnerving her. She tells him to leave her alone and walks away.\n\nAt the diner, Michelle speaks with Mick’s angry brother Danny, who is incensed that Michelle and her pals hadn’t bothered to attend Mick’s funeral. She asks if there is any way she can make it up to him. Danny snarks, yeah — she could help him find his brother’s killer.\n\nMichelle and Drew are up to their usual bickering, but when Danny comes in, they team up, deciding that Michelle should stick close and keep tabs on him. Michelle invites him to stay for Thanksgiving dinner and suggests that she might be able to help him find his brother’s killer.\n\nAs she spouts off false information to send him on a wild goose chase, he calls her bluff. He finds what she is saying interesting, but says he doesn’t believe a word of it. He continues to insist that he doesn’t believe what Michelle has told him, he thinks she knows more than she is offering. Michelle claims that she is ready to tell him the truth — no one is sorry that Mick is dead. Mick was a bad guy who’d been dealing drugs in the club and that’s why no one came to his funeral.\n\nJesse isn’t pleased to find Michelle alone with Danny. He tells him to get out, but Danny says that he had been invited to dinner. Jesse uninvites him. Once alone, Jesse warns Michelle not to try to take this guy on, he wants Danny to stay away from her.\n\nJenna realizes that her two charges, Marina and Lizzie, are no longer with her. She frantically starts looking for them, but to no avail. Jesse and Michelle fear that Danny might have taken them. Danny finds Lizzie and Marina hiding and returns them safe and sound. Everyone apologizes for suspecting him. Michelle spins out and Danny follows her.\n\nThe four teenagers argue because Jesse threw Danny out and now Michelle is missing. The four are still arguing as Selena enters, back from her trip to California. Bill and Jesse leave. The two women are alone. Selena guesses that the kids are involved in Mick’s death. Selena warns Drew that, according to word on the street, even though Danny looks and sounds good, he is much more dangerous than Mick. She adds that if they get in his way, they are dead.\n\nMichelle, meanwhile, is on the beach by herself remembering the scene with Mick and Drew. Danny comes up and confronts her. He presses her because he believes she knows something about Mick’s death. He clearly unnerves Michelle. Danny reveals that before he died, Mick told him that he had a crush on Michelle and they used to flirt all the time. Danny’s theory is that Jesse killed Mick in a jealous rage. He adds that he is going to make Jesse pay for killing Mick.\n\nMichelle denies that Jesse killed Mick. Danny keeps pushing. He starts manhandling her. She screams. At this point, Michelle drops the bomb that when he died, Mick was attacking her. Jesse arrives at the beach and pushes Danny down while yelling “get away.”\n\nJesse threatens Danny and keeps screaming at him and pummeling him. Jesse says if Danny goes near Michelle again, he will kill him. Danny leaves with the cryptic message, “I have learned a lot tonight. It’s been a real education.”\n\nMichelle and Jesse talk about their difficulties regarding Mick at the diner. She is finally able to share how Danny has been coming on to her. Jesse asks her to please tell him the next time that Danny starts making her feel uncomfortable. After Michelle gets a hug from Frank outside the diner and tells him to say ‘hi’ to Marina for her, Danny intercepts her and kisses her passionately on the lips.\n\nDrew and Jesse talk about the pain of losing someone, as Michelle finds out there is a new student in her class — Danny. Michelle is ready to blow a gasket! She vents to Drew that Danny Santos has annoyingly shown up in her psychology class, claiming he is there to audit the lectures. She feels like he is really there to stalk her. He has even signed up to be her study partner, but does he really want to study? — no; he just wants to sit there and torture her.\n\nWhen the assignment is analyzing ink blots, Danny had insisted that each one looked like two people making love — Michelle and himself. Michelle replied curtly that the ink blots looked more like pictures of Danny getting hauled off to jail for harassing her.\n\n[Note: these scenes were not filmed, only related to Drew. Paul Anthony Stewart had pneumonia. Thank God, they didn’t have someone fill in for him that day!]\n\nDrew suggests that Michelle might consider chilling a bit. After all, as long as Danny keeps sniffing around Michelle romantically, he’d probably forget all about trying to investigate his brother’s death. But Michelle get her dander up all over again, when a sheaf of ink blots — a little gift from Danny — arrives in the mail. She phones him and sets up an urgent meeting.\n\nAt the mall, Michelle spells things out for Danny in plain English: no more calls, no more packages in the mail, no more auditing her college classes and no more intimidation tactics, period. A kinder and gentler Danny tries to explain that his only intention here is romantic. He’d even decided that his brother’s death was an accident, so he was closing up shop on his one-man investigation. Michelle, however, doesn’t soften a bit. She tells him firmly that they are not a couple and will never become one; she loves Jesse.\n\nAfter Michelle turns on her heels and leaves, Danny confers by cell phone with an unidentified collaborator. He reports that things are taking a little longer than anticipated, but he remains as determined as ever to find his brother’s killer.\n\nMichelle stops by Holly’s and suggests that Holly come to the Bauer house for a holiday meal. Her response is, “What kind of mother would I be if I weren’t here when my Meg got home?” She offers Michelle some egg nog in hopes of changing the subject and Michelle was shocked to taste alcohol in Holly’s drink. Holly agrees that drinking is a bad idea and rushes Michelle off, promising to come for dinner after Meg arrives. Michelle exits only to find Danny waiting for her with a Christmas gift. It is a picture of Michelle alone in the park, a reminder that he is always around.\n\nDanny arrives just as Michelle, Drew, Jesse and Bill are arguing, and the tension changes to rage when he walks in and kisses Michelle. Jesse goes after Danny with all of his might, but is pulled back by the news that Michelle and Danny are partners in a class at school.\n\nDrew pulls Danny outside to see what is really going on with him. Danny suggests that if Jesse got this angry over a kiss, he may have had similar rage if Mick had ever hit on Michelle. Maybe Jesse killed Mick, he wonders and Drew suggests that Danny no longer cares about Mick’s murder. She thinks that Danny has developed a thing for Michelle.\n\nWhen Michelle lets it slip that things had happened with Danny lately, Jesse pushes for more information from her. When she tells him about the first kiss from Danny at the diner, Jesse’s anger is palpable. Simultaneously, Danny admits to Drew that he does have a thing for Michelle. He says that if he could take Michelle away from Jesse and pin Mick’s murder on him at the same time, then all the better.\n\nJesse shares his plan to save Michelle with Bill. He plans to leave town throwing suspicion totally his way. Jesse covers his plan by telling Michelle that he had been called to New York by an art dealer. Meanwhile, Danny is told that he only has 48 more hours to wrap up Mick’s murder. If he can’t do it, all four under suspicion would die.\n\nDrew overhears Jesse telling Bill his plan to leave town and his request for Bill to watch over Michelle. Drew can’t bear the thought of Jesse leaving and wants to send Michelle away instead. Jesse not only asks Drew to understand, but asks an even bigger favor … tell Danny that Jesse is the one who killed Mick. An upset Drew goes to Danny and blurts that Michelle killed his brother.\n\nDanny accosts Drew, demanding to know who killed Mick. Drew says it was Michelle. Danny does not believe this; he thinks Jesse did it. She also reveals that Jesse is leaving town to throw Danny off the trail. Upstairs, Michelle and Jesse are saying good-bye. She asks to go with him. Jesse says no.\n\nDanny doesn’t believe that Michelle killed Mick. Through tears, Drew tells Danny that Mick was hurting Michelle and the death was an accident. Selena interrupts. Danny drags Drew upstairs to confront Michelle. Danny tells Drew someone will have to pay because his family wants revenge.\n\nDanny is racing upstairs to find Michelle and encounters Dietz on his way to find Michelle. She and Jesse are outside saying good-bye. Jesse tells her he will never forget her. He rides off on his motorcycle, leaving Michelle alone just as Danny comes up angrily behind her. He confronts her and yells, “there is only one way to finish this!” She is terrified.\n\nDanny is devastated to learn that Michelle was the one who had killed his brother. As she begs him not to kill her, he drags her out of the alley. Danny brings Michelle to the beach where is brother had died. He wants to know exactly how she killed Mick. Michelle desperately tells him the story of what happened as it related to her, leaving out Drew’s involvement. Danny says that he believes her, but unfortunately her confession isn’t really in her best interest.\n\nHe asks who else was there that night, saying that his brother was twice Michelle’s size. He doesn’t believe that Michelle could have done it alone. She insists that it was only her. He says that he knows what kind of person his brother was and that he believes her. Michelle collapses into his arms with relief, but he pulls away, saying that no matter what, he can’t excuse her killing his brother.\n\nSince Danny is being watched by one of his father’s men, he tells Michelle that if he doesn’t take care of her, someone else will. Sirens rng out in the distance, heading toward the beach. Michelle begs him to run and save himself. He looks back to see that he is still being watched. Desperate, he pulls Michelle further down the beach. As the sirens grow closer, the beach is left empty.\n\nMichelle tries to convince Danny that she had acted in self defense and that his brother’s death was an accident. Danny tells her it does not matter. Dietz shows up and wonders why Danny has not killed Michelle yet. Danny sends him to check if there are any cops around. Then, Danny points his gun and orders Michelle to turn around. She refuses and he forcibly turns her around … Suddenly, there is a gunshot and Michelle is face down in the river.\n\nDietz returns and seems pleased. After he leaves, Danny helps Michelle out of the water. She asks why he had ordered her to jump in. Danny says he’s done it because he believes her story, and she thanks him for not killing her. He says it isn’t that easy. He wonders if she is worth the fact that he is risking his life. He says that in order to remain safe, she absolutely has to follow his instructions.\n\nDanny and Michelle argue over Danny’s plan. She isn’t sure it’s any better than the alternative of being dead and doesn’t think “the boss” will believe their story. Danny says “the boss” better believe it, for her sake. Michelle panics and realizes that she isn’t as safe as Danny had told her she’d be. The boss agrees to see them, and Michelle is surprised to find out that the boss is a woman and Danny’s mother. Michelle explains that killing Mick was an accident; she did it in self-defense because he was attacking her. Danny’s mother doesn’t care and says that Michelle must pay for killing her son. Danny stops her and tells his mom she can’t kill her because Michelle is his wife.\n\nAfter Danny drops this bomb, Carmen is clearly upset as she points a gun at Michelle. Carmen is still threatening Michelle. When Michelle finally talks back to her, Carmen slaps her face. Meanwhile, Jesse is positive Michelle is not dead. He tells Drew that if she were, he would feel it. He figures out that the Santos family is hiding Danny and Michelle. He goes off to find them and refuses Drew’s offer to come with him, but she does so anyway. Carmen is still angry. Jesse and Drew enter and spot Danny. As Carmen goes to the door, Danny tells Michelle to make the marriage look real or else.\n\nJesse speaks in Spanish to Carmen, which seems to impress her. He says he has information about Mick. Inside, Danny warns Michelle that her friends’ lives depend on her making their involvement look real. He sees Carmen enter the room and draws Michelle into a passionate kiss. In walk Drew and Jesse, interrupting the kiss. Jesse runs over and hugs Michelle. In front of Mama, Danny and Drew, Jesse tells her that she doesn’t have to pretend anymore. She can come with him. Michelle shocks everyone by saying no — she is staying with Danny.\n\nMichelle is heartbroken as Jesse stands before her, pleading to take her home. He explains that the police know everything now. Carmen blames Danny for bringing trouble into her home by marrying Michelle. Michelle then has to turn to Jesse and break the news of her marriage to Danny. Jesse blows past this news as if she never said it. Carmen leaves, giving Danny the task of removing Jesse and Drew from her home.\n\nDanny reminds Michelle that their marriage has saved the lives of her loved ones. She turns to Jesse and claims to love Danny in a way she had never loved him. Jesse refuses to believe that. Danny warns Jesse that it is time for his departure. Michelle is forced to go farther, pointing out all the problems that she and Jesse had endured in their troubled relationship, and adding that she was happy to be past that now. As a distraught Jesse exits, followed by a not so distraught Drew, Danny moves to comfort Michelle. She pushed him away as Carmen looks on. Carmen steps in, asking Michelle to call her mother. She says that she is making plans for a proper church ceremony.\n\nThe Bauers are summoned by Dietz to meet Carmen. They are relieved to hear that Michelle is alive, but shocked to learn about her marriage to Danny. Jesse tries to explain the situation, but they don’t completely believe him. Once at the country club, Rick tries to convince Michelle that what she is doing was wrong. Michelle tells her brother that she has no choice.\n\nJesse crashes the party and pleads with Michelle. He says if you tell me that you don’t love me anymore I will leave you and Danny alone. Michelle tries, but she can’t say those words and they kiss. Mrs. Santos sees this and informs her son that Michelle is welcoming a guest in the hallway.\n\nMichelle tells Jesse that they are over with and her life is with Danny. In response to his mother’s newsflash, Danny interrupts and orders Jesse to leave. Jesse believes that Danny is holding something over Michelle and tells him to let her go. The two men end up fighting, and Dietz throws Jesse out. Danny and Michelle argue over her kissing Jesse goodbye. Danny warns her to be careful because his mother is filing away everything she does for future reference.\n\nMrs. Santos whispers in Michelle’s ear that Danny is having second thoughts about the marriage and that is very bad for her. Later, Mrs. Santos has Jesse brought by for a little chat. She wants his help in breaking up Danny and Michelle. Jesse refuses to go along with her. Michelle is upset to find the bedroom she is supposed to share with Danny lighted with candles and decorated with flowers like a bridal suite.\n\nUpon entering their bedroom, Michelle is stunned. The room is decorated as a bridal suite with flowers and champagne. Michelle tells Danny that she wouldn’t sleep with him if her life depended on it. It does, Danny reminds her. He adds that she could be a little bit grateful. Carmen enters and asks if they like the room, reminding them that she wants grandchildren, as she stares at Michelle who just looks sick. Carmen asks Michelle how many children she wants. Carmenthen recites a blessing in Spanish asking God to make Michelle very fertile. Once she leaves, Danny admits to Michelle that he will do whatever it takes to keep Michelle safe. He says it’s not about his brother anymore or revenge; it’s just about her and him.\n\nMichelle says there is no “them” and she doesn’t love Danny. He says she is stuck with him and she should try to make the best of it. He insists there is something between them if Michelle would only admit it. He rubs her shoulders. She breaks away and tells him it will never happen. Michelle repeats her mantra: there is nothing between her and Danny, and she will find a way out of this mess without anyone she loves getting hurt. She adds that she will never sleep with Danny. He tells her that she can’t get away from his mother. He begins to undress for bed. He informs her that he wears nothing to bed. As Michelle slips into a pretty negligee, she tells him that tonight he will wear something to bed. “Touche” is his answer. They are now both in the same bed. Michelle has her back turned; grinning, Danny says good night.\n\nMichelle is looking for Danny and finds his mother who tells her Danny has gone out. They have a heated conversation and Michelle tels Mrs. Santos that she is aware that she does not believe her marriage is real.\n\nMrs. Santos receives a phone call and speaks in Spanish. She tells Michelle to get used to it and snidely tells her to let her know when she felt left out. Abby arrives and she and Michelle use sign language. Mrs. Santos is visibly angry and Michelle tells Abby that because she doesn’t sign she is feeling left out, taking an opportunity to throw Carmen’s words back in her face. Michelle lets her know she expects privacy and as she leaves the room, Mrs. Santos says she will spare no expense at the wedding and that Michelle would get all she deserved.\n\nAbby wants to know what is going on and she lets Michelle know her family was worried. She tells her they would fix everything. Michelle tells her she has made both a choice and a committment and asks her to accept this. She also asks Abby to help her convince Rick and Jesse. She tells Abby that she needs them to give her some space. Abby sayes it seems she is a prisoner. Michelle admits that she and Mrs. Santos don’t like each other, but they are adjusting. She tells her again that this is the life she wants. Abby doesn’t believe her and Michelle tells her not to come back. As she leaves, Michelle asks her to tell everyone “Hi” and that she is fine.\n\nMichelle wakes up wondering where Danny has gone to. When she calls for him, he jumps up from the floor at the foot of the bed. He says that he decided that it would be easier to sleep on the floor than worry about accidentally brushing against her. He quickly joins her in the bed when his mother knocks on the door, but forget to take the blankets with him. Michelle explains the blankets away saying that she had gotten hot during the night and thrown them off. Danny insists that his mother honor his and Michelle’s privacy.\n\nOnce alone again, Danny asks Michelle to meet his grandmother. She declines. The afternoon brings a meeting with the priest, where they have to prove that they are ready for marriage. Michelle assures Danny that she would ace their test with the Father, and she would do it by thinking about Jesse when answering every question. Her test proves successful, however, Michelle is a little surprised to hear how compatible the priest finds them.\n\nIt is brought home for her when Danny reads the answer on his questionnaire about what he hoped for in a marriage and it is almost the same as hers. She says that she had never realized until then how much Danny had given up by marrying her. She had only thought of what this marriage had cost her. She asks Danny to help her find a way for both of them to be happy. Danny says that the difference between the two of them is that he doesn’t expect life to be perfect.\n\nCarmen explains to Dietz that Jesse is her only real hope of breaking up Michelle and Danny. Jesse comes in with reservations, still not understanding why Carmen would want to work with him. She says that she wants Jesse to help show Danny that he is making a mistake. Jesse is willing to hear her plan. When Danny and Michelle arrive home from their meeting with the priest, Carmen is very excited for the two of them to meet her newest employee. She pulls them into the dining room and says, “I think you know Jesse Blue.”\n\nCarmen informs Danny and Michelle that Jesse is now working for the family. Michelle looks green. Danny turns crimson with anger. Privately, Danny tries to argue Carmen out of putting Mr. Blue on the family payroll. She bluntly reminds her rebellious son that she is the boss, her word is sacrosanct, and if at any time Danny gets bored with this foolish marriage and divorces Ms. Bauer, Carmen is quite ready to put a contract out on the infuriating interloper.\n\nCarmen remains staunchly convinced that Michelle will only wind up breaking Danny boy’s heart. Later, Carmen gives Jesse a personal tour of the mansion and takes particular delight in showing him the newlywed’s much-rumpled bedroom. She cunningly points out that the bed sheets were in such disarray, because Danny and Michelle couldn’t keep their hands off each other. Jesse listens politely to Carmen’s beaming comments, all the while vowing to find a way somehow to rescue Michelle from this elegant snake pit.\n\nThen, while Carmen and Michelle go off to huddle over invitations (for Danny and Michelle’s big church wedding), Mr. Blue and Mr. Santos lock horns. Danny wants Jesse to quit. Jesse insists that he isn’t ditching his new job at the Santos compound until he can take Michelle with him.\n\nLater, when they’re alone, Danny tells Michelle there is only one way to get Jesse to leave the premises for good. They have to convince him that they are really in love. Jesse will have to catch them in bed together. Michelle and Danny have it out in their bedroom. He declares that she isn’t the only prisoner in this marriage and they have to make their domestic situation look as real as possible.\n\nDanny leaves angrily to speak with Jesse, and Drew comes over to see Michelle. Danny and Jesse have a tense confrontation. Danny threatens Jesse’s life when Jesse refuses to quit working for Carmen. Drew is compelled to tell Michelle the truth: Jesse is still carrying a torch for Michelle — and it could all get them killed. Drew thinks there is only one way to convince Jesse that Michelle and Danny are happily married. He has to catch them in the act of making love.\n\nMichelle wonders how she can go through with it. Jesse knocks on her door and tells her they have to talk. Michelle insists that he needs to stay away from her as Drew listens from behind a curtain. Jesse reminds her of the past — how they’d once taken wedding vows in the lighthouse — but Michelle tells him that it’s over between them. Nevertheless, she doesn’t resist kissing him. Then she asks him to leave, even though she breaks down and cries when he does. Afterwards, Michelle makes a decision and asks for Drew’s help.\n\nIn the meantime, Danny goes to confession and tells the priest that he may have to kill someone in order to save his wife’s life. The priest prays that he won’t have to do it and warns him that if he commits murder, his soul could be in mortal danger. Michelle calls Danny on his cellphone and informs him she has a way to get rid of Jesse without killing him. He needs to meet her at the lighthouse.\n\nMichelle tells Danny that they have to make love at the lighthouse in order to convince Jesse that she doesn’t love him anymore. Danny wonders if she can go through with it. Michelle answers by kissing him. The newlyweds undress and climb into bed. But suddenly Michelle can’t go through with it, after all. When Jesse arrives, she tries to keep him out of the lighthouse, but he pushes his way in and finds Danny in bed.\n\nDanny and Michelle are in bed. Danny starts to take off her negligee saying, “We have to do this.” Michelle backs away screaming, “No, there has to be another way.” Jesse is outside knocking on the door while all this is going on. She runs to the door with Danny’s jacket covering her negligee crying, “No, Jesse, I don’t want to see you.” Jesse keeps pushing to come in. He forces the door open, sees her and Danny scantily clad and asks, “Why?” Michelle just looks guilty. Jesse is very hurt.\n\nMichelle apologizes to Jesse for the scene he just walked in on. Jesse is incredulous as well as hurt. Danny sits quietly in the background as Michelle tells Jesse in a teary voice that it’s over. Jesse finally relents by telling her he won’t bother her anymore. He leaves and Michelle cries bitterly in front of Danny. Danny expresses his concern to Michelle. He tries to comfort her as well as offer his sympathy and help. Michelle rejects it all. She tells Danny to stay away from her. This angers Danny. Michelle reminds Danny he will never have her love.\n\nDanny and Michelle get dressed while he lectures her. She says she would rather be dead than be with him. He reminds her that unless she acts like she loves him, she and Jesse will be dead. To this, she reiterates that she will never love him. Danny thinks that just as his grandparents met for the first time on their wedding day and had a happy life, so too, there may be hope for him and Michelle. Nevertheless, Danny denies having feelings for Michelle in response to her statements.\n\nDanny orders Michelle to pull herself together, because Carmen should not see that she has been crying. Danny tells Carmen that Jesse is gone; and furthermore, he and Michelle are tired of jumping through Mama’s hoops. He adds that it’s time for her to show Michelle the respect due his wife.\n\nAt this point, Michelle comes in and asks for a private chat with Carmen. She asks Michelle what happened. Michelle says she wants Drew to be her maid of honor and she wants white roses at her wedding. Carmen replies that a big wedding is not really necessary. Michelle insists that a big wedding is what she wants — in fact, “the bigger the better.” Carmen says a big shindig would be in questionable taste because Michelle killed Mick. Michelle then announces that that she will go all through their family rituals and she will earn their respect and trust; she wants Carmen to be proud of her. She adds that she sincerely wants to be part of the Santos family and feels that a big wedding with all the relatives on hand is a good way to start. Carmen says, “I’ll consider it” (through clenched teeth) as she leaves the room.\n\nAfter Carmen leaves, Michelle tells herself that she will get in as deep as she can, infiltrate herself into the Santos clan, find out all their weaknesses and then use that to “as God is my witness, bring this family down.” She finishes the speech by saying “I will get my life back!”\n\nMichelle informs Drew of her plan to bring down the Santos family. Drew thinks Michelle’s going to get herself killed trying to get Jesse back, but an impassioned Michelle tells her that it’s not about Jesse, it’s about Michelle getting her life back. Things get honest between the two, as Michelle advises Drew to make sure Jesse’s what she really wants and not to settle for someone who doesn’t want you as much as you want them. Later, Jesse thanks Drew for comforting him last night and asks to take her out in return. Drew makes a decision to lie that she already has a date, and we know Michelle’s words have had an effect on her. Michelle returns to the Santos home, and tries to press Danny for information regarding his family and business. Wary off Carmen’s warning that Michelle is up to something, Danny becomes defensive.\n\nMichelle and Drew meet and talk about Michelle’s plan to bring down the Santos family. Drew tells Michelle that she turned down a date with Jesse because she doesn’t want to be the “next best thing.” The two share a warm moment.\n\nDanny doesn’t really want to go into Michelle’s house. He gets the idea that Michelle is trying to pull something over on him. She suggested Danny accept that she might actually like him. While she didn’t love him, she suggests that maybe that would come in time. When they go inside and tell Rick and Meta that a wedding is set for the day after tomorrow, they are met with less than a happy welcome. Rick says that if Danny is going to marry his little sister, it is time for them to have a talk. Meta confronts Michelle, saying that she knows she isn’t in love with Danny.\n\nMeanwhile, Rick is upstairs showing Danny the real Michelle in her old bedroom. Rick says to Danny, “you’re destroying my sister’s spirit.” He adds, “the greatest gift you could give my sister is to let her go.”\n\nMichelle asks her family to be at the wedding to support her. She rushes upstairs when she realizes that Danny hasn’t come down with Rick. She finds Danny looking at the nude drawing Jesse had sketched of her. Danny says that Jesse had a beautiful subject and that the drawing doesn’t do her justice.\n\nRick says it is time for them to love Michelle and support this marriage. Meta hopes that he is right. Michelle asks for a few minutes alone in her own room to collect a few things. Alone, she calls the FBI offering to help them get the Santos family. As she is offering her help, Danny walks back in. Danny walks in on Michelle on the phone with the FBI, but assumes that Michelle was trying to call Jesse. She covers, and is relieved he doesn’t know who she was really talking too. Then Danny informs Michelle that he wants them to consummate the marriage after the ceremony. Michelle is floored, and tries to tell him she needs to take things slowly.\n\nLater back at Casa Santos, Michelle is trying in vain to take a nap. She tosses and turns. Danny enters carrying the box of souvenirs that Jesse sent over. Michelle insists she does not want it; he can toss it. Danny says it’s okay for her to have memories — she can keep the box. She stubbornly maintains that she does not want it. Danny leaves and Mama Santos watches in the wings as Michelle poignantly goes through the contents of the box. Michelle is reading Romeo and Juliet. Carmen comes in with her own wedding dress and mantilla. Carmen says it would mean a lot to Daniel’s grandmother if Michelle wore the dress instead of the new one she bought. Michelle replies that she would be honored to wear it. Michelle tries on the beautiful lace mantilla. Carmen remarks that Michelle may have fooled Danny, but she knows that Michelle does not love him, and she is not fooled.\n\nMichelle continues to insist that she loves Danny. Drew enters. When Carmen leaves, Michelle and Drew laughingly refer to her as “Morticia.” The two young women commiserate. Michelle reveals that she phoned the FBI about the Santos family.\n\nJesse opens the door to Danny. Danny tells Jesse to back off and to leave Michelle alone. The two men argue. Danny tells Jesse to stay away from the Santos compound. He warns that if Jesse comes to the wedding, he is a dead man. After Danny leaves, Jesse calls Mark Endicott and cancels the show because of the wedding.\n\nDrew counsels Michelle to earn the trust of the Santos family. She tells Michelle about Jesse’s upcoming art show tomorrow. Carmen tries one last time to talk Danny out of the marriage. Danny chillingly says if she doesn’t stop, he will leave the family forever.\n\nCarmen tells Danny that she won’t stand in his way regarding Michelle. Rick, Abby and Meta arrives to witness an event that they know to be a charade. Drew coachs Michelle in the bride’s dressing room to make this wedding look real. Danny greets his family and tells his cousin that Michelle is truly special. As his grandmother takes her place next to Carmen, her first time out of her room since Mick’s death, the wedding gets underway. Rick apologizes for not doing a good enough job stepping in when their dad went away. He says that he would do anything for her, even right at that moment. Michelle just says, “please Rick, it’s time to give me away.”\n\nHe does as asked and walks her down the aisle. As the priest gets to the part of the vows asking anyone to speak now or forever hold their peace, Jesse stands in the back looking on. He imagines stepping forward and asking Michelle to tell everyone that he was the one she loved. In his mind, she tells Danny that Jesse is the only man for her and runs out with him. But in reality, the wedding moves forward. Michelle and Danny shares their vows with one another and become husband and wife in the eyes of God.\n\nMichelle is surprised Danny has planned a honeymoon. Drew assures Michelle she’ll be her go-between with the FBI and comments on how genuine her and Danny’s kiss seemed. Nervous but determined to go through with everything, Michelle approaches Danny and, at her suggestion, they head upstairs. Michelle is surprised by the gifts of money they were given. When Danny asks Michelle if there’s anything she wants, she drops her dress and moves toward him. Clad only in her trousseau, she tries to be passionate with Danny, but her feelings of guilt prevent her from consummating her marriage vows. Danny then tries to make Michelle comfortable by giving her a massage and whispering sweet nothings in her ear, but it doesn’t work.\n\nThey are interrupted by the FBI, thanks to Drew having contacted them. Danny is livid that FBI agents burst in on his wedding night. Carmen is sure Michelle’s behind it, but Danny defends his wife and does not want her harassed. Michelle says it’s OK, she can handle it, as one agent questions her while the other questions Danny and Carmen. Michelle talks to him about bringing Carmen down, but the agent makes it clear that if Carmen goes down, Danny goes down with her. When Michelle defends Danny, the agent reminds her she must choose between saving herself or Danny. Once alone, Danny embraces Michelle, promising to protect her and telling her she is his life.\n\nMichelle is grilled by the Santos family’s lawyer about her conversation with the FBI. Danny defends Michelle to Carmen and the attorney. Carmen speaks with Rick about her son’s death at Michelle’s hands, and Rick advises her to allow Danny to run his own life.\n\n[This was probably a great scene between Rick and Carmen, but alas, it is on the cutting room floor and we never saw it.]\n\nLater, Michelle secretly gives money to a woman threatened by the Santos family, in exchange for information about their illicit operations.\n\nMichelle contacts the FBI to let them know about her speaking with Mrs. Silva. At church, she runs into Mrs. Silva, who wants to tell Danny about the money Michelle gave her. At Michelle’s request, Mrs. Silva reluctantly agrees not to. Michelle insists that she wants to help Danny get out of the crime business, but she needs Mrs. Silva to tell her all she knows. Ray overhears Mrs. Silva thanking Michelle, and later assures Michelle that Danny would never harm her for being generous to Mrs. Silva.\n\nDanny, meanwhile, is having dinner with Carmen, who continues to relay her suspicions about Michelle. Danny wants to earn an honest living for Michelle and their future family. Carmen, disturbed, tells of their family history, explaining that his grandfather and father had dreams of building the Santos family to be a force to reckon with in the community. Though touched, Danny remains firm about wanting to go legit. Carmen offers to accept Michelle only if she passes a test of her loyalty, but Danny refuses, and vows that Carmen will lose him if she acts against Michelle. Still, he assures Carmen that if Michelle or anyone else betrayed his family, he would exact revenge against them. Soon after this, he’s shocked when Ray tells him that Michelle gave Mrs. Silva the money.\n\nMichelle tells a suspicious Danny that she didn’t know Mrs. Silva was a “client,” and was just helping a poor woman out. Danny learns that Dietz is still following Michelle, and orders him to stop. He also tells Michelle that his mother had better not be right about Michelle’s working against the family. Reminding him that she’s his wife, Michelle kisses him. Danny takes her into their bedroom, and the two begin to make love. But Danny picks up on her hesitation. Aghast that he nearly forced her to do something she doesn’t want to do, he storms out.\n\nDanny brings Michelle flowers to apologize for last night. Michelle tells him they need to trust each other. She and Danny tell each other of their first heartbreaks. Michelle discusses losing her eyesight, and then presses Danny to tell her about his family’s crime business. Danny questions whether she’s ready to take his life in her hands. He describes a litany of criminal activities — including a shipment of Cuban cigars arriving tomorrow night.\n\n[While Danny did tell Michelle about the Cuban cigars, we did not see the scene where Michelle told him about losing her eyesight, nor did Danny talk about anything other than the cigars.]\n\nHe makes her promise she won’t tell anyone about this, since he could be arrested. She promises, but knows she must call the FBI. Danny privately hopes his wife won’t betray him.\n\nMichelle privately tells Drew to call the FBI about the info she obtained from Danny. Drew presses Michelle for her feelings about Danny. She warns Michelle that Danny will come after her if he finds out. Danny, meanwhile, makes a call to guard against the possibility of an FBI raid, hoping he’s wrong about Michelle. Michelle overhears him telling his grandmother that he loves Michelle. Changing her mind, she calls Drew to tell her not to go through with calling the FBI. But it’s too late. Danny tells Carmen about the setup to test Michelle’s loyalty. He implies that if Michelle fails his test he’ll kill her. Later, Carmen tells Dietz make his girlfriend call the FBI posing as Michelle.\n\nMichelle, having discovered she was too late to stop Drew from calling off the FBI, pretends she’s losing her eyesight again. Danny takes Michelle to the hospital. Rick examines her and privately asks her why she’s faking blindness. Drew and Jesse rush to the hospital, worried that Danny’s done something to Michelle. Jesse enters Michelle’s room and vows to help her. Danny orders Jesse to leave, since he can take care of his wife. Rick pushes both men out. Privately, Drew tells Michelle she knows Michelle is faking. Danny later comforts Michelle and promises he’ll stay by her side. Dietz then appears, secretly showing Danny pictures that prove the FBI showed up at the docks … at Michelle’s request.\n\nThe next day at Millennium, Michelle tells Drew she won’t involve her anymore in the plan to bring down the Santos family. Michelle unconvincingly denies being in love with Danny. Changing the subject, she comments on a box of artifacts from Drew’s past, which Drew plans to use in an interview about Millennium. While looking through the box, Michelle finds a letter that reveals Drew was adopted. Horrified, Drew rushes out.\n\nCarmen, glad that Danny believes Michelle’s guilty of calling the FBI, reminds her son that he must punish Michelle for her betrayal. She wonders if Michelle also lied about Mick’s death, and if she’s still seeing Jesse. Danny’s doubts increase, especially when he later finds Michelle packing her bags. Michelle claims she’s spending time with Rick because of her eyesight. Danny calls her a liar.\n\nDanny and Michelle are arguing. Michelle denies that she called the FBI. Danny puts his hands around her throat and says if she really did something so stupid as calling the FBI, he does not know if he would be able to forgive her. Michelle tells Danny that she overheard him talking with his grandmother and admitting he has feelings for her. She adds that hearing that made her feel good. She tells him he needs to trust his feelings for her. Danny talks softly to Michelle but places his hands around her throat again. Danny tells her he will protect her and take care of her. Michelle replies that she is glad he wasn’t there when the FBI showed up. Michelle is going to Rick’s house for a couple of days. Danny gets very emotional saying goodbye to her.\n\nDanny tells Carmen he’s ready to avenge Michelle’s betrayal. Believing Michelle’s days are numbered, Carmen feigns sympathy for Michelle’s blindness, and cruelly tells her that life’s too short for animosity. Michelle doesn’t buy the sympathy act, and sticks up for herself. Danny overhears Dietz thanking his girlfriend for making the call to the FBI, as ordered by Carmen. He confronts his mother about the revelation, and embraces Michelle, now sure of her honesty. He tells Michelle he’ll come with her to Rick’s, to take care of her.\n\nJesse reveals to Drew that he called Rita, the woman who wrote the letter implying Drew was adopted. Drew is stunned when Rita appears, explaining that she lied about the letter. She describes Drew’s adoption, and Drew’s father’s decision to keep it a secret. Drew is devastated and angry with Jesse for going behind her back. Jesse begs for forgiveness, but she goes off to drink alone. Jesse goes to Selena to tell her Drew knows the truth.\n\nCarmen talks with Dietz, and after playing a cat-and-mouse game with him, threatens him for his stupidity in letting Danny find out Dietz’s girlfriend called the FBI at Carmen’s request. Frightened, Dietz apologizes. Carmen acknowledges that he’s been a loyal employee for some time, but reminds him of the Santos need for vengeance.\n\nDanny and Michelle go out to dinner with Rick and Abby. Privately, Abigail tells Michelle that it’s obvious Michelle has true feelings for Danny.\n\n[Unfortunately, this is another scene that didn’t make it to the air. I would have loved to have seen it.]\n\nLater, the newlyweds dance together in a moment heavy with sexual tension. Michelle — touched by his affection and encouraged by her growing feelings towards him — admits that she faked the blindness. She then learns that Danny gave her false info to test her. She realizes that she’s failed the test, and hesitantly admits as much to Danny.\n\n[Another scene gone … Although we did see Michelle confess to faking her blindness and calling the FBI, we did not see Danny tell her that it was a test.]\n\nEnraged at her for betraying him, Danny tells Rick and Abby to take Michelle home — he can’t even look at her right now. Later, a distraught Drew joins Danny for a drink at the bar.\n\nRick urges Michelle to tell him what happened with Danny. She refuses to admit the truth, just saying she married Danny to prevent Carmen from having her prosecuted. Meta privately confronts Michelle for omitting the truth — that Michelle’s life is in danger. Meta wants Michelle to leave town, but Michelle trusts Danny loves her… and admits she’s drawn to him.\n\nBack at Millennium, Danny and Drew continue to drown their sorrows. Wanting to get away from everyone, Drew grabs a bottle and starts to leave. Danny asks her if she wants company. Drew takes Danny to the loft, where they bond over their mutual betrayals. Drew says she’s not afraid of Danny, despite his tough act. They continue to drink and bitterly damn everyone who hurt them. Soon their angry feelings lead them to passion. But after they had sex, Drew is horrified that she’s slept with Michelle’s husband. Just as she asks Danny to keep their night together a secret, Jesse arrives home.\n\nMichelle is pouring out her heart to Meta as she tries to sort out her feelings for Danny. She admits to Meta that she cares for Danny for real now and wants to tell him so. Meanwhile, Danny and Drew are in bed together. Drew is expressing regret over having made love to him a few minutes ago. Danny tries to calm her down. Jesse unlocks the door, and as he struggles with the chain, she puts on a robe and Danny hides.\n\nJesse apologizes for inviting Rita over. Drew tells Jesse to leave and won’t open the door. By this time Danny has gotten dressed. With a guilty look on his face, he nods to Drew to open the door. They make the bed together. Danny hides in the bathroom while Drew opens the door to Jesse. He apologizes again for inviting Rita over. Drew insists she is okay. Jesse sees the rumpled bed, finds a man’s wallet and realizes that Drew did not sleep alone. He becomes angry and walks out. Drew cries. Danny comes out and apologizes. Danny notes that Jesse sounded jealous. Even though Danny denies it, Drew forces him to admit that he loves Michelle. But he adds that Michelle betrayed him and he is clearly furious about that.\n\nMeta tells Michelle not to go and talk to Danny. She warns Michelle that no matter how nice, polite and polished he is, Danny was raised to be ruthless. He was also groomed for a certain type of lifestyle. Michelle insists he can change. After Meta leaves, she hears her voice in her head telling her not to go to Danny as she toys with her car keys. She calls Drew not knowing that Danny is still there. Drew simply says she can’t talk now. Once off the phone, Drew refers to herself as a slut. Danny jumps to her defense. They agree to keep what happened strictly between the two of them. Danny leaves, but his wallet is still on the floor.\n\nMichelle has her head down on the kitchen table, asleep. She dreams that there is a knock on the door. It’s Danny and they passionately kiss and make up; but at the end of this beautiful scene he pulls a gun out, loads it and says, “You leave me no choice.” She wakes up, hears a knock at the door for real and goes to open it. Danny stands there looking dark, brooding and dangerous. This time it is not a dream.\n\nDanny shoves his way past Michelle into the Bauer kitchen. She brandishes a knife and shrieks, “I know you came here to kill me!” Danny can’t believe his ears; she drops the knife. He thought they had gotten past their initial misgivings about each other, but he was wrong. He has made the only decision he can, and declares their marriage over. A desperate Michelle insists that she’s ready to be his wife and won’t do anything to make him unhappy; by severing their relationship, he’s giving her a death sentence. He gives his word that she’ll be safe from his mother’s wrath. He kisses her goodbye and places his wedding ring in her palm.\n\n[Note: This scene was a hell of a lot more emotional than this description makes it sound. Danny could not leave without holding her in his arms one more time and Michelle clung to him as if her life depended on it, sobbing openly. And when he kissed her, Michelle kissed him right back. In fact, this was the first true kiss between the two of them. It was so beautiful, but so heartbreaking.]\n\nDanny tells Carmen at Towers about breaking up with Michelle, and orders her not to hurt Michelle. Carmen maintains he’ll soon be a widower. Danny threatens to turn a ledger detailing Carmen’s illegal activities over to the FBI if she hurts Michelle… even if it means he goes to prison too. Later, Carmen fires her lawyer for allowing Danny to obtain the ledger, and asks Ben to join her team of lawyers. He refuses… but she’s still impressed with him.\n\nAt Jesse’s loft with Drew, Michelle spots Danny’s wallet, which he’d left the other day. Drew makes up a lie to explain why the wallet’s there. Jesse arrives, and Michelle reveals that her marriage is over. Wanting her old life back, she asks him to forgive her. She invites him to dinner, but he has to think about it. Michelle leaves and sees Danny in the hallway. She returns Danny’s wallet. Jesse, seeing them together, accepts Michelle’s dinner invitation.\n\nDrew and Danny commiserate at Millennium on Michelle and Jesse’s apparent reunion. Danny admits he’s miserable but is convinced his marriage is over. They agree to keep their night together a secret. Jesse and Michelle arrive, and Michelle is distressed to see Danny. When she goes to the restroom, Jesse notices Drew and Danny’s closeness, and realizes Danny was the man in Drew’s bed last night. As he confronts them, Michelle appears and asks what’s going on.\n\nCarmen meets Ben again to convince him to accept her job offer, and says he’d be working for her, not Danny. They make plans to meet tomorrow night.\n\nJesse confronts Danny and Drew about their night together when Michelle enters. Jesse privately challenges Danny to tell Michelle, saying he won’t be the person to hurt Michelle. He blasts Danny for taking advantage of Drew.\n\n[This exchange between Danny and TWV (The Walking Vegetable) was cut. Damn, probably had some fabulous Danny reaction shots.]\n\nLater, he warns Drew not to tell Michelle the truth, and warns her about Danny. Drew claims at least Danny could offer her what Jesse can’t — physical affection. Danny urges Michelle to reunite with Jesse, saying he only pretended to love Michelle. Michelle agrees she pretended as well. However, after she walks out, in anguish, Danny whispers to himself, “I do love you.”\n\nLater, she talks with Meta about Jesse and Danny, claiming that she wants to start her life with Jesse over again.\n\n[Argh, another great scene where Michelle talks about Danny, and is totally in denial about Jesse, on the cutting room floor. Again, may I say, arrggghhh!!!]\n\nJesse arrives, and asks Michelle why she really married Danny. She reveals she married Danny so he wouldn’t have to avenge Mick’s death — and that she never slept with Danny. Later, Michelle gets a phone call and agrees to meet someone. Jesse thinks he knows where she’s going, and starts to head out. Meanwhile, Danny talks with Ray and asks for an annulment. Ray says as long as he loves Michelle, an annulment would be wrong. Michelle arrives, and Ray challenges her to swear she doesn’t love Danny.\n\nJesse guesses that Michelle is with Danny, since she lied about being with Meta. Meta defends Danny to him, but Jesse later leaves to find Michelle. Michelle can’t tell Ray decisively that she doesn’t love Danny. Danny asks her why she’s prolonging this, reminding her that she’s the one who wanted out of their marriage, and storms out. Ray reveals that Danny threatened to turn Carmen in to the FBI in order to save Michelle. When Michelle runs to stop Danny from leaving, Jesse arrives and sees them together.\n\nAt Carmen’s home for dinner, Ben and Carmen discuss the terms of Ben’s employment. Carmen explains she’d have to “terminate” him if he wanted to dissolve their partnership. Ben tries to seduce Carmen but she says she’s not impressed. He counters that he’s not impressed by her threats either. With the two at a mutual understanding, Ben leaves.\n\nAt Millennium, Danny and Drew discuss their drunken night together. He reveals he’s seeing a woman tonight following a business meeting. Danny tells Juan to make a “delivery” without Carmen’s knowledge.\n\nMichelle prepares a romantic dinner for her and Jesse, but calls Jesse by Danny’s name. She apologizes profusely and he accepts. The evening continues with a few mishaps, but they toast their relationship. Jesse asks her why she’s still wearing Danny’s ring. She removes it, and they start off to Jesse’s apartment. They go to the Millennium, where Michelle is shocked to see Danny with a pretty young girl.\n\nAt Millennium, upset about Danny’s closeness to this pretty young girl (Pilar), Michelle leaves with Jesse. Pilar wonders why Danny didn’t tell Michelle that Pilar is Danny’s sister. Danny gives Pilar a very brief, censored version of his and Michelle’s marriage, avoiding mention of their family’s threat to Michelle’s life.\n\nMeanwhile, Michelle and Jesse head to Jesse’s loft, where Jesse feels she’s forcing herself to get close to Jesse. She assures him this isn’t true, that she wants to recapture their life together. Drew walks in and orders them out, and tells Jesse he has to move out altogether. Jesse apologizes to Drew, and she warns him to be careful of Michelle, considering her feelings for Danny. Jesse agrees to look for another place to live.\n\nCarmen is both thrilled and annoyed to find Pilar in Springfield. Pilar maintains that she wants to stay in town, but Carmen refuses, saying she has to go back to Barcelona to school. Privately, Carmen asks Danny if he brought Pilar here as vengeance for what Carmen did to Michelle. She doesn’t want Pilar to learn the nature of their business.\n\nMichelle asks Rick if Jesse can move in with her, claiming that she and Jesse belong together. Rick asks her if she has feelings for Danny, and she says she doesn’t. He vows to give her independence, but later expresses his concern about Michelle’s welfare to Abigail.\n\nJesse and Drew argue, and Jesse admits he cares for her — he doesn’t want her to get hurt again. Hurt, Drew says she doesn’t need a brother, and tells him to move out so she can pursue a social life without being judged. Jesse warns her off Danny. Drew packs Jesse’s things and throws them out the door, telling him she doesn’t want to see him until he looks at her as if she’s the only woman for him. Jesse pulls her close to him, just as Michelle appears.\n\nDrew tells Jesse to choose between her and Michelle. Jesse reveals to Michelle he’s moving out of Drew’s place, and Drew storms off. Michelle notes the passion of his argument with Drew, asks him if he has feelings for Drew. Jesse avoids the question, reminding her that he witnessed her marriage to Danny, and says he needs time to think. Michelle leaves just as Drew returns. Drew tells Jesse to leave as well, but Jesse says he’s staying. A fuming Drew tosses him out anyway.\n\nPilar announces she plans to stay in Springfield. Carmen privately warns Danny to fix this situation and leaves. Danny and Pilar talk about Michelle and his feelings for her. Pilar urges him to tell Michelle of his love for her. But he claims his marriage is over. Pilar sees Michelle on the phone with her father planning a visit. The young girl goes to Michelle and introduces herself, correcting Michelle’s assumption that she’s Danny’s girlfriend. When Danny tells Michelle they need to meet with a priest for an annulment, Michelle reveals she’s leaving town.\n\nDanny orders another “shipment” from a supplier, and argues with Carmen, who doesn’t want him taking on more business while Pilar is in town. He’s acting recklessly because of Michelle, Carmen warns. Danny leaves to attend to business in an alley — where he and a worker are discovered by David and another cop! The cop insults Danny, and they end up fighting. David arrests Danny for attacking a police officer.\n\nFrank questions Danny about being caught stealing electronics. Pilar arrives and, to Danny’s dismay, Frank tells her about the charges against the Santos “mob family.” Carmen appears with Ben, who produces proof that the electronics were the property of the Santos family. Frank reluctantly agrees to release Danny, who reasserts to Pilar that the family isn’t involved in crime. Carmen is impressed with Ben, and tells him he’s proven himself — he’s earned a place working for her.\n\nJesse and Drew talk about Michelle, and Drew assures Jesse Michelle will call him. He admits feeling reluctant about moving out of the loft, saying he’ll miss Drew.\n\nPilar confronts Danny with newspaper listings about the family’s criminal activities. He claims their business is legitimate. Pilar then asks Danny to tell her the truth about Mick’s death. When she mentions asking Michelle, Danny decides to send Pilar back to school. He leaves her alone. Pilar spots Bill, and pretends to him that Danny has been hitting on her. He agrees to help her, and by the time Danny returns, Pilar and Bill have left.\n\nPilar lies to Bill about who she is, and presses him to tell her what he knows about Danny. Bill describes how Michelle was forced to marry Danny in order to prevent Carmen from having her killed. He refers to the Santoses as a family of killers. Pilar is devastated, and Bill is surprised by her reaction. Danny finds them together and orders Bill to get his hands off his sister.\n\nWhen Danny tries to take Pilar home by force, Bill punches him. Danny learns that Bill told Pilar about the Santos family’s criminal nature — in particular, the hit Carmen placed on Michelle’s life. When Pilar states her disgust at Carmen, Danny is forced to explain that Michelle killed their brother, Mick. Pilar wants revenge. Dismayed, Danny doesn’t want Pilar to end up like Carmen — or like himself — and asks her to return to school. Later, Danny threatens Bill, warning him to stay away from his sister.\n\nBill tells Danny how much suffering Michelle has done because of Danny. Danny acknowledges this and vows that their relationship is over. Bill adds that Danny should keep away from both Michelle and Pilar. Danny drives off, distraught, meanwhile Pilar confronts Carmen, demanding more information about the crime business. Carmen tries to defend everything that has been done, and says she’s only wanted to protect Pilar. Pilar doesn’t accept any of Carmen’s explanations, even when her mother starts to weep. The girl proclaims that she’s no longer a part of the family, and leaves to call Bill. Carmen assumes Pilar called a cab, and Pilar defiantly claims she called for her lover!\n\nDanny drives to the lighthouse, and remembers the night he and Michelle pretended to make love for Jesse’s benefit. Michelle appears, to his surprise. She explains that she needed time alone, and has been staying here rather than visiting her father. Michelle wonders why Danny is here ….\n\nBill arrives at Carmen’s house, and Carmen unleashes her wrath at him — thinking that he’s Pilar’s lover. Bill protests that this isn’t true, and Pilar defends Bill. She lashes out at her mother, saying she hates her — and Carmen slaps her. Apologizing for losing control, Carmen begs for forgiveness, but Pilar rushes off with Bill. Bill is worried that Pilar’s a danger to him, but is concerned that Pilar doesn’t have any place to live. Pilar ends up falling asleep at his place.\n\nJesse tells Drew that he knows now he belongs with her … he loves her. Drew’s elated, but makes Jesse promise to talk to Michelle before they pursue their relationship further.\n\nDanny tells Michelle he was out driving and ended up at the lighthouse. He starts to leave, but Michelle tells him not to go. She admits she came here to think about Jesse, but can’t stop thinking about Danny. At long last she admits that she has feelings for him that she can’t deny. She kisses him, and he responds. Michelle tells him he can get away from his family and they can live together. But Danny knows he can’t leave his family… he can’t be with Michelle if she wants to change him. He leaves, despite Michelle’s protests.\n\nCarmen laments Pilar’s hatred for her. She blasts Danny for bringing Pilar home, but Danny tells her that Carmen’s the one who destroyed their family. After Carmen rushes out, upset, Ray gives Danny the annulment papers. Carmen later tells a henchman to do whatever it takes to convince Bill to turn his back on Pilar, giving Pilar no choice but to return home.\n\nAt Millennium, Michelle tells Drew that Danny made it clear he doesn’t want her. Drew responds that it’s too late for Michelle to return to Jesse. Drew admits that she and Jesse are in limbo while Michelle tries to work out her feelings. Michelle protests that she’s chosen Danny, but he refused her. Danny enters the restaurant, and Michelle goes to his side, hoping for a reunion. But instead, Danny hands her the annulment papers.\n\nMichelle insists to Danny that she wants to continue with the marriage, and even tears up the annulment papers. But Danny purposely acts cruel: he describes the family legacy of deceit and crime, and claims that he only feels lust for Michelle. He describes how she’d be destroyed by his way of life, and wonders how she’d feel if he brought their children into the family business. Devastated, Michelle leaves, telling him to send her new annulment papers. Later, Michelle is shocked when she discovers Jesse and Drew in bed.\n\nMichelle enters Jesse’s loft and discovers Drew and Jesse in bed. She lashes into Drew for chasing after Jesse, but Jesse defends Drew and calls Michelle a hypocrite. Drew leaves, certain Jesse and Michelle will reunite. But Michelle calms down and tells Jesse she wants him to be happy, and leaves, devastated. Drew returns and Jesse assures her that he only wants Drew.\n\nPilar and Danny are shocked when a battered Bill arrives at Millennium. Bill accuses Danny of having him beaten up, but Pilar guesses that Carmen was responsible. She tells Bill to stay away from her world. Bill says he wants to help her.\n\nDanny confronts Carmen in fury, and chokes the thug who attacked Bill. He vows to help Pilar get away from Carmen. Carmen asks if he’ll ever stop punishing her for Michelle, and Danny storms off.\n\nMichelle returns to live at home with Rick and Abby. She talks with a concerned Abby, who doesn’t believe Michelle’s protests that she’s ready to start a life without Danny.\n\nAt Millennium, Danny gets drunk and claims to Pilar that, thanks to Carmen, his life is over.

Pilar begs him not to accept the deal, but Danny does — making the condition that Carmen agrees not to interfere in Pilar’s life.\n\nMichelle learns that Bill was beaten up, and Bill assures her Danny wasn’t responsible. Michelle warns him to stay away from Pilar, but Bill focuses on Michelle’s love for Danny.\n\nCarmen talks to Ben and asks him to help her with her financial records, citing Danny’s threat to expose the family’s crimes to the IRS.

He kisses Carmen and leaves. Carmen calls her henchman and tells him that Michelle is “as good as dead …”\n\nPilar is upset that Danny gave up his life with Michelle in order to help her. Danny insists that he’s not right for Michelle, but Pilar doesn’t believe him. Bill arrives and Danny asks him to look after Pilar when he leaves for California.

Later, she gets a call from Carmen saying that Danny wants to see her.\n\nDanny calls Carmen from his car phone to remind her that if Michelle is hurt, he’s prepared to use Carmen’s bookkeeping ledgers to bring down the family.

Michelle claims her bond with Danny is unbreakable, but Carmen reveals that Danny slept with Drew. Danny tries to explain what happened, but heartbroken Michelle doesn’t think their relationship can be salvaged.\n\nDanny pleads with Michelle to understand that his sleeping with Drew meant nothing, but Michelle remains wounded. Michelle reminds him that he told her that he never really loved her. Danny reveals that he was just trying to protect her, and tells her to fight for their marriage.\n\nMeanwhile, Danny admits to Pilar that he slept with Drew. Pilar can’t imagine how Danny could love one woman and sleep with another. She rails against all men, and pushes Bill aside as she passes him and Vanessa.\n\nMichelle lashes into Drew for sleeping with Danny. Drew apologizes and tells Michelle that Danny loves Michelle, but Michelle is too hurt to believe her. Things get worse when Jesse arrives and defends Drew.

As she drunkenly accepts, Danny enters.\n\nDanny spots a drunk Michelle acting up with the frat boys, and refuses to let her leave with them. He takes her home despite her protests, and takes her shoes and car keys so that she can’t leave. She blasts him for trying to help her when he’s the one who hurt her in the first place. He pledges to keep her here until she sobers up. Demanding a party, Michelle draws Danny into a kiss.\n\nCarmen reveals her misery to Ben over the widening rift between her and her children.

She starts to tug off her clothes, challenging him to sleep with her. Danny scoops her up and dumps her into a cold shower. He tries to break through her barriers, promising to stay away from his family. Affected, she’s about to respond when Ben calls, revealing that an attempt has been made on Carmen’s life.\n\nPilar apologizes to Bill for treating him badly the other day, and they decide to go dancing. Needing some clothes from her mother’s house, Pilar gets Bill to help her sneak inside. Once within the darkened, empty house, they start to kiss. At that moment, outside, Carmen’s thug loads his gun and prepares to open fire….\n\nBill successfully pushes Pilar away from the spray of bullets as Carmen’s thug shoots up the house. Carmen, Ben, Danny and Michelle arrive, and Carmen is horrified to see that her plan nearly got her daughter killed. Michelle is suspicious at Carmen’s obvious guilty response, but Ben explains it’s normal maternal instinct.\n\nDanny pledges to find out who’s responsible for the “attempt on Carmen’s life,” but also assures Michelle he won’t break his promise to leave the family when possible. Michelle tells him she’ll stick by him. Carmen privately thanks Ben for helping her, and kisses him.\n\nDanny tells Carmen he’ll stay in the family only as long as necessary to find out who set up the shooting of Carmen’s house. Carmen decides that in order to keep Danny within the family, she needs to get him to focus on an outside enemy.\n\nMichelle warns Bill about getting involved with Pilar and her family. She guesses that Carmen set up the shooting, but Bill convinces her that Carmen wouldn’t put her own daughter’s life in jeopardy.\n\nBill invites Pilar to the wedding.

Later, he visits Michelle in her bedroom, where they kiss passionately.\n\nPilar surprises Michelle by warning her that Danny belongs with Carmen, and that Michelle and Danny can never be together. Michelle presses her for the real reason for her change of heart, and Pilar mentions Vanessa’s harsh reaction to the idea that Bill and Pilar are together.\n\nBen warns Carmen that her schemes to bring her family together are going to backfire. Concerned about the near-deaths of Pilar and Bill thanks to the shooting, Ben announces that he’s decided against being Carmen’s attorney. Carmen, furious, decides to make Ben the fall guy for the shooting. She shocks Danny by informing him that Ben was responsible for the attempt on her life. Danny, enraged, promises to take care of Ben. Meanwhile, Ben leads Blake into an elevator and presses the “stop” button. Outside, Danny crosses to the elevator, out for revenge.\n\nFinding Danny at Towers, Michelle tries to tell him that Carmen was behind the shooting, but Danny doesn’t believe her. Distracted by his desire for revenge, he tells Michelle to keep away from him, that he doesn’t want her to be in danger.

When he leaves Ben alone, Ben realizes at once that Carmen is setting him up.\n\nAt the hospital, Michelle tells Rick about the shooting at Carmen’s, but says Carmen was behind it. Rick worries that she’s putting her life in danger by trying to find out the truth.\n\nBen confronts Carmen and tells her that Danny seems to think Ben was behind the shooting. He acts desperate, begging her to set Danny straight. Carmen agrees, but warns Ben against telling Danny that she was responsible for the fake attempt on her life. When she leaves, Ben privately makes sure he got everything on his tape recorder.\n\nCarmen and Danny walk in on Bill and Pilar kissing. Danny stops Carmen from chastising Pilar and sends the young couple out. Carmen tells Danny about her confrontation with Ben – and says she’s now sure Ben tried to kill her! Ben arrives and Carmen pretends she’s afraid of him. Danny searches Ben and finds the tape recorder. Ben challenges Carmen to tell Danny what’s on the tape.\n\nBen threatens to play the tape recording of Carmen incriminating herself for the shooting, but Carmen promises to clear things up. Realizing he’s in the power seat, Ben also demands money and power – including a company so he can go up against Alan. Agreeing, Carmen tells Danny that she lied about Ben because he turned her down romantically.\n\nMichelle tells Danny they should be together, danger or no danger. Being apart is driving her crazy! Danny firmly shuts her out of his life, for her own good.\n\nMichelle interrupts Bill’s date with Pilar in order to reconstruct the events of the shooting. She learns there was a time discrepancy that could point the finger towards Carmen.\n\nBen teases Carmen, wondering why the story she used with Danny happened to include being in love with Ben. A phone call interrupts them, and Carmen rushes out, claiming that Danny’s taken a step that could put all their lives at risk.\n\nMichelle steals into the house to get the clock, which stopped as a result of the shooting, but is forced to hide when Ben and Carmen enter the room … followed by Danny, who vows to take a dangerous step to get back with the woman he loves.\n\nDanny has called a meeting of the local crime families in order to learn who was behind the attempt on Carmen’s life. He announces that the Santos family is going legit! Carmen covers in public, but privately tells Ben she has no intention of making the business legitimate.\n\nAnother crime boss, Nino, shows contempt at Danny’s plans. Privately with a colleague, he expresses his mistrust of Carmen. Nino mutters to himself that he’s not going to sit around waiting to be killed.\n\nDanny calls a family meeting to discuss taking the Santos business legit. Pilar is overjoyed at the news. Ray announces that he’s going to be ordained on Friday, and everyone’s invited to the mass. Privately, Ben tells Carmen he knows her desire for power will prevent her from allowing the family to go legit. Carmen accuses him of the same ambition.\n\nCarmen’s henchman Dietz secretly calls Nino, the member of a rival crime family, and tells him that the entire Santos clan will be in church on Friday…it’ll be a perfect time to “take care of them.” Later, Danny visits Michelle and proposes that they remarry in church on Friday after Ray’s ordination. Michelle, on Bill’s advice, doesn’t tell Danny about Carmen’s setting up the shooting.\n\nprepare for their secret wedding ceremony after Ray’s ordination later this afternoon. Danny asks Rick for Michelle’s hand in marriage, promising to take care of her. Michelle shares Abigail’s joy at the success of her operation.\n\nCarmen admits to Ben that she’s determined to keep the Santoses in the crime business because of the vow she made to her dying husband. She decides to meet secretly with her rivals after Ray’s ordination ceremony to announce that she’s still in business.\n\nDietz, meanwhile, plots with Nino to kill off the Santos family. As everyone arrives at the church for Ray’s mass, it’s revealed that Dietz and Nino have planted a bomb.\n\nThe Santos family gathers for Ray’s first mass, along with Michelle, Bill, Rick and Abigail. As Ray speaks, Abigail hears a sound she doesn’t recognize. Rick reminds her that the doctor warned her there might be some trouble with the implants, but she’s still troubled.\n\nBen notes that Dietz has left the church, but Carmen says Dietz is just checking to make sure everything is safe. Ben remains uneasy, especially when Abigail exclaims that she hears a strange sound. She searches for the source of the noise, and she and Danny discover the bomb!\n\nEveryone tries to leave the church, but the door is locked. Ben realizes that whoever did this wants the Santos family dead, and probably barred all the exits to the church. Bill, using his computer knowledge, tries to disarm the bomb. Afraid to pull the wrong wire, he hesitates as the clock ticks down. Danny takes over, reaching in as he prepares to pull one of the wires with less than twenty seconds to go!\n\nAs the seconds tick away, Danny manages to cut the right wire to defuse the bomb. Dietz lies and says some stranger left the bomb. Carmen orders Dietz to tell the other crime families that the Santos family is back.\n\nRick tries to take Michelle home, where she can be safe. Danny agrees, but Michelle refuses to leave with her brother. When Carmen insults Michelle for bringing Danny down, Michelle at last tells Danny that she can prove Carmen was behind the shooting at the Santos house.\n\nRick’s concerns about Michelle are growing thanks to the bomb scare. Abigail attempts to calm him down, but he can’t help but worry about his sister, as long as she stays with Danny.\n\nMichelle again demands that Carmen confess to being behind the shooting. At last Carmen admits that it was her doing, but that she did it for her family. She warns that Danny can’t leave the family now – he’ll put them all at risk. Danny is disgusted and calls her a monster. Michelle announces that if Danny must stay with the family, she will stay by his side.\n\nRick and Phillip talk about Michelle, and how to protect her from the Santos family. Phillip mentions that if necessary, they can force her to stay at home – or Rick can talk to Danny and convince him that Michelle is safer away from him.\n\nDanny tells Michelle that he wants her and Pilar to stay at the family’s home in San Cristobel for a while. Michelle refuses, claiming that she’d rather die than leave Danny’s side. They kiss, and she says she wants to make love to him. But Rick arrives, and tells Danny to send Michelle home to her family!\n\nRick makes an impassioned pitch to Danny, saying that if Danny really loves Michelle, he’ll send her home. Danny claims that he is responsible for Michelle now. Rick leaves, and shares his frustrations with a sympathetic Phillip.\n\nMeanwhile, Danny secrets Michelle in the lighthouse to get her away from the turmoil…and so they can finally have their first true night as husband and wife. Danny gets a call about a bomb threat at the Santos home, and he hurries off.\n\nMeanwhile, Carmen gets a call from Bernard, the head of a rival family, who admits his son was behind the bomb. She tells him he can make up for his son’s mistake by doing her a favor. When Danny arrives at the house, he realizes he’s been tricked into leaving Michelle alone. He threatens Carmen, telling her that he’ll kill her if anything happens to Michelle. But it’s too late – Michelle is abducted from the lighthouse by two shadowy figures!\n\nDanny accuses Carmen of hurting Michelle. She denies it, and Ben defends her. Danny leaves and, at the lighthouse, sees the sign of Michelle’s struggle. Deciding against Carmen’s involvement, Danny tracks down the true culprit ….\n\nCarmen thanks Ben for sticking up for her, though he wryly states that he doesn’t think she’s innocent. She rewards Ben by making him president of Sancorp, her late husband’s first company in Springfield. Ben’s thrilled, knowing he can finally go up against Alan.\n\nLocked in a hospital room, Michelle is aghast to find Rick is her captor! Rick explains that to protect her, he’s authorized a 72-hour psychiatric watch on her. Michelle blasts him for frightening her and Danny. She vows to return to Danny.\n\nDanny arrives at the hospital and argues with Rick. He asserts that he and Michelle will one day have a safe future together. Rick is unconvinced, and says that he’s responsible for Michelle’s safety. As Michelle pounds on the door, Danny promises to find a way to free her.\n\nMichelle yells at Rick for not respecting her choices. She vows she’ll never see Rick again once Danny gets her released. Rick tries to defend himself to no avail. Dr. Bradford visits Michelle and grows concerned when Michelle claims Carmen has made attempts on her life.\n\nRick allows Danny to visit Michelle as long as Abigail stays to chaperone them. Michelle and Danny profess their love, and Abigail is greatly affected. She tells Rick that if he continues to separate Danny and Michelle, he risks a great deal…including Michelle’s love.\n\nAt dinner with Abigail, Rick realizes that Danny has followed them to the restaurant. He complains to Abigail that Danny’s been following him all day, and goes to have it out with Danny. Rick harshly tells Danny that he won’t be intimidated.\n\nAbigail tries to make Rick understand that Michelle and Danny belong together. Rick dismisses her feelings and leaves for a phone call. When he returns, Abigail is missing – and he finds a note on the table: “Your wife’s with me – now you know what it feels like.”\n\nRick learns that Abigail was seen leaving the restaurant with Danny. He races to confront Danny, accusing him of kidnapping Abigail. Danny pretends sympathy and advises Rick to go look for his wife. When Rick becomes agitated, Danny’s bodyguard throws him out. Abigail emerges from hiding, distraught that her plan to change Rick’s mind didn’t work ….\n\nCarmen visits Michelle in the hospital, sincerely attempting a truce. Michelle doesn’t believe her and orders her out. Offended, Carmen lies and claims that she’s here to sabotage Michelle. Michelle lunges at Carmen, and orderlies hold her back.

Ben warns her that Danny will blame Carmen if Michelle’s not let out of the hospital because of their argument.\n\nAbigail shares her worries with Danny, afraid that she’s ruined her marriage by trying to show Rick what it’s like to lose a loved one. Danny agrees to take Abigail to Rick. They arrive at the hospital and Rick is overjoyed, but furious with Danny. Abigail reluctantly admits that the “kidnapping” was her idea.\n\nDr. Bradford fails to calm Michelle, and orders a nurse to give Michelle a sedative. After a talk with Phillip, Rick apologizes to Michelle, thinking she’s asleep. When he learns she’s been drugged, he goes ballistic and demands her release. Dr. Bradford refuses, saying that Michelle has to stay another two weeks.\n\nWhen an emergency sends the doctors and orderlies away from Michelle’s room, Danny sneaks in and carries his sleeping wife out of the hospital.\n\nAbigail apologizes to a stunned Rick for planning the fake kidnapping. Rick’s devastated that she’d frighten him this way. They learn that Danny has taken Michelle from the hospital.\n\nDanny takes Michelle to his home, planning to send her to San Cristobel. They bump into Ben and Carmen, who are on their way to the bedroom. Danny blasts Carmen for threatening Michelle, but Carmen claims she wanted to make peace – and Michelle confirms this. Michelle says she’s willing to start again with Carmen in order to have a life with Danny. Danny still doesn’t forgive his mother.\n\nRick and Abigail find Danny and Michelle, and Danny challenges Rick to call the police.

And then they make love again.\n\nReturning to Carmen’s house, Danny tells Michelle about their home in San Cristobel. Carmen tries to get Danny to postpone his honeymoon, claiming that the family is still in danger. Danny refuses, and leaves to pack.\n\nMichelle talks with Carmen, trying to forge an understanding. Carmen pretends to agree to a truce, and gives Michelle the San Cristobel villa as a present. At Carmen’s request, Michelle agrees to bring a box to a banker friend in San Cristobel. This box turns out to contain chocolates. But Carmen privately tells Dietz that next time, Michelle will be bringing more than candy overseas ….\n\nArriving at the Santos home in San Cristobel, Michelle is awestruck at the beautiful house.

The next package will consist of bearer bonds.\n\nIn San Cristobel, Michelle tricks Danny into going to the jewelry store to retrieve Reva’s ring, though he didn’t want her to get involved.

Josh is dubious, and Cassie leaves with Michelle, vowing she’ll save her sister’s life.\n\nCassie tries unsuccessfully to reach Reva at the palace, hoping to prevent Josh and Billy from carrying out their drastic secret plans. Michelle wonders if she’d have more success, considering the Santoses’ relationship with the royal family. Cassie’s afraid Reva is in danger but won’t leave the island because of her lost son. Michelle realizes that Reva’s family means everything to her…so maybe if Cassie pretends to be ill, Reva would return home! Cassie agrees.\n\nAt the ER with Michelle, Cassie pretends to faint in front of Lillian. Blake arrives, and figures out that Cassie and Michelle are plotting something. Cassie explains the plan, and Blake helps, telling Lillian about Cassie’s “symptoms.” A doctor admits Cassie for examination.

He advises against trying to hurt Michelle, since it would mean losing Danny. Carmen vows to have Michelle arrested if she visits San Cristobel again. Ben isn’t certain that her plan is a good one, but Carmen is determined.\n\nWhen Danny learns Michelle was at the hospital earlier, he wonders if she’s pregnant. Michelle assures him she’s not, explaining that she was only checking on Cassie. She reveals that she couldn’t be pregnant, since she’s on the Pill.

They agree to wait until the family is safe before starting a family … but they can still “practice.” The two begin to make love.\n\nHoping to help Reva, Michelle asks Danny if they can attend the masked ball in San Cristobel.

Danny embraces her, but shocks Michelle by still refusing to let her go.\n\n[Oh give me a break! Talk about totally understating scenes. They had their first REAL fight as a married couple …oh, and Michelle’s comparison between Maureen and Reva was left on the cutting room floor. Typical.]\n\nJosh reveals his plans to rescue Reva, and asks Danny to take Michelle back to San Cristobel as a cover to get Josh, Matt and Jim into the country. Danny doesn’t want to put Michelle in danger, but he is reluctantly convinced. Cassie is outraged to learn that the men are making plans to free her sister and are not including her.\n\nWhile Michelle is over at Drew’s place trying on dresses for the ball in San Cristobel, Jesse arrives and announces to Drew that he’s accepting a job in an art gallery…in New York. Drew is upset, and Michelle wonders why they’ve broken up before leaving.\n\nCarmen confronts Danny about his wanting to use the family yacht to rescue Reva. Danny tries to figure out what kind of partnership Carmen and Edmund have, aside from the Santos family’s using San Cristobel to launder money. Carmen wants Danny to take bearer bonds with him when he returns to San Cristobel, and threatens to ruin his rescue plans if he doesn’t comply. Danny reluctantly agrees.
