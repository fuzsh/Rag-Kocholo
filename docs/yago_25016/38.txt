With that in mind, here’s the response to a pressing Guiding Light inquiry:

Q: Who are the fathers of Harley’s children?

A: Harley’s three children have three different fathers. She conceived daughter Susan (who now goes by the name Daisy) with then-boyfriend Dylan Lewis while still a teenager, but Harley gave the baby up for adoption to the Lemay family.

Sh’s since moved back in with Harley. Harley’s ex-husband Phillip Spaulding is son Zach’s (full name Alan Cooper Spaulding) dad, while son Jude is the product of Harley’s one-night stand with Phillip’s best friend Rick Bauer.
