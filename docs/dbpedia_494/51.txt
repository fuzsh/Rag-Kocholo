Presentation of Bukhara

The Emirate of Bukhara was a Central Asian state that existed from 1785 to 1920. It occupied the land between the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers, known formerly as Transoxiana. Its core territory was the land along the lower Zarafshan River, and its urban centres were the ancient cities of Samarkand and the emirate's capital, Bukhara. It was contemporaneous with the Khanate of Khiva to the west, in Khwarezm, and the Khanate of Kokand to the east, in Fergana. It is now within the boundaries of Uzbekistan.

Emirate of Bukhara Flag

by William Garrison

The Emirate of Bukhara declared its independence from Russia following the Revolution of 1917. The national flag (if any) remains elusive, but here is the flag of Emir of that period (drawing after Prof. Trembicki's in the The Flag Bulletin)
