        "text": "During the emigration period (1918–1920), the Young Bukharans split. One group created the Bukhara Communist Party on September 25, 1918, in Tashkent. Its goal was to overthrow the Emir’s power and establish a democratic republic based on the Soviets. In the spring of 1919, the power in the Central Committee of the Bukhara Communist Party was in the hands of the Young Bukharan Usman Khodzhayev, who in 1918 joined the Left Socialist Revolutionary Party and formed the Left Socialist Revolutionary wing of the Young Bukharans. In June 1919, he was expelled from the Bukhara Communist Party. At the 3rd Congress of the Bukhara Communist Party in December 1919, a new Central Committee was elected, which set the goal of decomposing the Emir’s army and helping the Young Khivans establish the Communist Party of Khorezm.\n\nThe second group of Young Bukharans was led by Fayzulla Khodzhayev, who in 1918 fled to Russia, worked in the People’s Commissariat of Foreign Affairs of the Russian SFSR, met with Vladimir Lenin, and organized a branch of the Young Bukharan Party in Moscow. Upon returning to Tashkent in 1920, he headed the Turkestan Central Bureau of the Young Bukharans Revolutionaries. The Bureau sent a letter to Vladimir Lenin with a request to accept the party in the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) – RCP(b). The Bolsheviks rejected the request but decided to provide the organization with all possible assistance. August 3, 1920, the Turkestan Commission of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and the Council of People’s Commissars of the Russian SFSR approved the formation of the Turkestan Central Bureau of the Young Bukharan Revolutionaries with the Bukhara Communist Party based on their recognition of the RCP(b) program. This alliance was consolidated in Chardzhou at the 4th Congress of the Bukhara Communist Party, where it was decided to revolt and overthrow the power of Emir Alim Khan.\n\nOn September 2, 1920, Bukhara was taken by units of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Red Army of the Turkestan Front under the command of Mikhail Frunze with the support of the Young Bukharans and the Bukhara Communist Party. The Emir’s regime was overthrown. On September 11, the Young Bukharan Revolutionaries joined the Bukhara Communist Party. After the Bukharan People’s Soviet Republic was proclaimed in October 1920, the Young Bukharans leaders took important state positions. In particular, Fayzulla Khodzhayev became the chairman of the Government of the Republic (the Council of People’s Nazirs). At the same time, some of the Young Bukharans eventually moved into opposition to the Bolsheviks, advocating full independence of the Bukharan People’s Soviet Republic. In November 1921, as an extraordinary plenipotentiary of the Republic, chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets of the Bukharan People’s Soviet Republic Usman Khodzhayev was sent to Dushanbe to coordinate actions against the Basmachi but joined them. After an unsuccessful attempt to take Dushanbe over in December 1921, he fled to Afghanistan and then to Turkey.\n\nAs a result of the national-state demarcation of Central Asia in 1924, the Bukharan Communist Party, the Khorezm Communist Party, and the Communist Party of Turkestan, which included former representatives of the Young Bukharans, were dissolved, with the Communist Parties of Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan created on their basis."
