Yet how new is this phenomenon really? This article illustrates migrations between Central Asia and Russia from the early years of the Soviet period until the beginning of a new era marked by the fall of the USSR. It explains the opportunities for and constraints on population mobility during the Soviet period. Strict control of population movements and forced resettlement programs which took place especially during the Stalinist period influenced the ethnic composition in the region. This article also elaborates on the party-state’s management of labor force in the late 1970s and early 1980s especially state-supported migration to Russia to enhance production through the cultivation of virgin lands.",

        "text": "1Central Asia is a region with strong migratory dynamics. Migration patterns from Central Asia have their roots in the policies of the Soviet state on mobility and labor. As this volume comprises a number of interesting country-specific cases, it is important to bear in mind that the region as a whole has for the past century witnessed various flows of in − and out − migrations including state-forced resettlements during the Soviet people. The present article has the objective to describe on the one hand state-forced migration movements during the Soviet period, and on the other hand, the opportunities for and restrictions on mobility that influenced the migration patterns during this time. These migration-related historical developments should be drawn to the attention of scholars studying the current migration flows within the region as well as between the region as the place of origin and other countries of migrant destination.\n\n2Central Asia is also home to people who represent various ethnic groups and languages. For example, there are ethnic Uzbeks, Russians, Koreans and Tatars in Kyrgyzstan or Tajikistan or a Tajik-speaking population in some parts of Uzbekistan, ethnic Russians, Uigurs and many other minorities in Kazakhstan, Uzbeks and Russians in Turkmenistan. Scholars dealing with migration from Central Asia to Russia, a major point of destination, to Kazakhstan or beyond the post-Soviet territory are often confronted with this ethnic heterogeneity. This article also sheds light on movements of people in the context of state nationality policies during the Soviet period. Finally, this contribution shows that labor-induced migration as seen on the post-Soviet territory had begun prior to the dissolution of the USSR.\n\nThe Early Years of Mobility Control in Pre-soviet Russia\n\n3Any person travelling nowadays to Russia or to some countries of the former Soviet Union has been confronted with a mandatory registration of residence, known in Russian as propiska or registraciia. Researchers of post-Soviet migrations have without a doubt heard from both internal migrants within Central Asian countries or in the Russian Federation about their difficulties obtaining legal documents of which propiska is an important part. Resident registration has an interesting history. Some scholars hold Tsar Peter the Great responsible for the initial concept of registering population in order to engage more recruitees for his reformed army, collect taxes, and rule with more law and order than his predecessors (Garcelon, 2001: 90). Others argue that as early as the end of the 16th century the tsars kept a systematic registration of peasants who were bound to work for the feudal lords (Matthews, 1993: 1).\n\n4Under the regulations of the Russian tsars, the individual choice for mobility, particularly among the peasants, was limited. Movements of people took place for commercial or professional reasons whereas personal travels were highly restricted. However, subjects of higher ranks such as nobles and higher military personnel were issued permanent passports and enjoyed freedom of movement. The lower the rank, the more constrained the subjects were in their mobility. In cities, especially in St. Petersburg and Moscow, the subjects who were registered temporarily received address tickets that they were demanded to retain until their departure (Matthews, 1993: 10-12).\n\n5By the mid-19th century, strict control over population mobility became a hindrance as the demand for blue collar manpower increased together with industrialization of the urban areas. Issuance of passports became expensive for the impoverished, and consequently residents became increasingly reluctant to abide by the rules. In 1894, when the Statute on Residence Certificates was adopted under Alexander III, it was no longer demanded that urban residents obtain a permanent permit. When Central Asia was annexed to the Russian Empire in the 1860s, the statute loosened control over travels of subjects even more.\n\nControl of Movement through Labor in the Period after the 1917 Revolution\n\n6After the toppling of the tsarist regime and the establishment of the Bolshevik power, management of migration, settlement, and employment gained importance in the newly founded socialist state’s policies towards forming a large multiethnic state − one in which every member would work to contribute to the favor of the socialist society. Following the October revolution, Bolsheviks who had been vigorously criticizing and intending to abolish the tsars’ oppressive policies towards the exploited class soon established full control over the entire population with the same firmness. What is remarkable is that with a similar attitude as the tsars had had towards peasants whose movement they had restricted, the Bolsheviks demanded that all former members of bourgeoisie and upper classes obtain residence registrations. In doing so, the Bolsheviks compelled the former “exploiters” to participate in the military service and socially beneficial labor such as construction and maintenance. Holders of registration cards, who were adult men aged 18 to 45, were obliged to have their employment information entered into their documents by their employers and trade unions. This procedure was followed by the policy of “labor books” implemented in October 1918 (Matthews, 1993: 16-19). The regulation initially applied to all people who had previously belonged to upper classes. Labor books were to substitute identity documents and passports. They contained personal data and all information on jobs assumed by the holder, who had to update it on a monthly basis at the local administrative or police offices. Most importantly, labor books had a special entry on the holder’s place of residence (Matthews, 1993: 16-19). Propiska, the term for “residence registration” that emerged initially as an entry in these labor books, was a tit-for-tat instrument of control in the onset of the Bolshevik power. This practice would survive decades of state migration policies during and after the Soviet period and would be widely used in the ex-Soviet countries.\n\nManaging Migration and Institutionalizing Restriction on Movement of People under Stalin\n\n8When considering the institutional constraints imposed on the movements of people during the Soviet period, it is important to keep in mind the Soviet state’s construction of nationalities in the 1920s and 1930s. It is during this period that allocation of geographical territories of the Soviet republics took place. One of the most important historical milestones is the year 1922, which marked the establishment of the Soviet power in Turkestan − the region which later became known as Central Asia – as well as the foundation of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Two years later, in 1924, when the delimitation of administrative borders in Central Asia resulted in the creation of the Turkmen SSR and the Uzbek SSR, the latter first included the Tajik ASSR into its territory. Tajik ASSR then became Tajik SSR in 1929. Kazakhstan was known as Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic of the RSFSR. To RSFSR belonged also Kara-Kyrgyz Autonomous Oblast’ (Province). In 1936, these administrative unites were renamed Kazakh SSR and Kyrgyz SSR, respectively.\n\n12In the midst of the border demarcation process and creation of nations, the party-state was especially responsible for controlling rural out-migration and managing mobility of the population. The establishment of the Soviet power resulted in emigration of thousands of people who opposed the communists. In the Central Asian republics, the former upper class people were marginalized and driven from urban to rural areas. The formation of socialist collective farms led thousands of better-off peasants to flee from the Soviet regime into exile. Particularly in the 1930s, the so-called kulaks, or rich peasants/entrepreneurs, were taken under state scrutiny. Repression and execution of the kulaks forced a great number of people to seek refuge in Afghanistan, Iran, China, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and in Western European countries (Kocaoğlu, 2000). In nomadic regions of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan, collectivization was used as a tool to bring about a sedentary lifestyle. As Edgar argues, nomads were perceived by the Soviet administration as people difficult to control, who were opposed to the Soviet power and prone to cross the Soviet border to flee. According to Soviet understanding, only those who possessed a great deal of wealth were able to afford to lead a nomadic life, as any change of place of residence with family and household would require considerable means (Edgar, 2004: 195).\n\n14In 1932, Stalin issued a decree according to which internal passports were to be issued − allegedly − not only in order to gain more precise statistical information from urban areas, but also “in order to secure the deportation from these places of persons who are not connected with industry or with work in offices and schools, and who are not engaged in socially useful labor (with the exception of infirm persons and pensioners), and also in order to cleanse these places of kulak, criminal and other anti-social elements finding refuge there…” (Matthews, 1993: 28).\n\n16In light of the Soviet efforts to develop industry and cotton monoculture in Central Asia, arid oases in the south were to be cultivated. Due to a great deficit of manpower in these parts of the region, groups of population were relocated involuntarily from the Ferghana Valley to these areas. During the period from 1929 until the mid-1950s, in accordance with Stalin's oppressive attitude toward kulaks and other ‘undesired’ minority population in Central Russia and Siberia, “special settlements” (spetsposelenie) were established in the region where these forced settlers had to reside (Shigabdinov and Nikitenko, 2000: 103). A typical example is the deportation of 171,781 Koreans to Kazak and Uzbek SSR in the late 1930s, which occurred due to increased Soviet suspicion of ethnic Koreans residing in the frontier territories of the Far East. The Soviets feared that ethnic Koreans might establish close ties to Korean nationals and Japanese intelligence agents with Korean nationality (Shigabdinov and Nikitenko, 2000: 104).\n\n17The period during World War II and the years immediately after witnessed, despite the strict control on movement, different migration flows including rural-to-urban movements due to the increase of industrialization and expansion of urban areas. Migration of Slavic population to Central Asia increased during and after World War II, partly related to the evacuation of population from Russian territories under the German occupation, but also as a result of the transfer of plants, construction of military infrastructure, provision of clothing and food supplies, and redistribution of resources during the war (Shigabdinov and Nikitenko, 2000: 104). Among the Central Asian republics, Kyrgyz SSR and Kazakh SSR had the largest inflow of Russian-speaking migrants in the decades after World War II (Islamov, 2000: 181-182).\n\n18The onset of World War II and the invasion of the Nazi troops marked the deportation of Germans from the Volga Region to Central Asia, their overall number in 1941-1942 amounting to 1,209,430. Forced relocation of minorities in the USSR was not confined only to Germans, however. The number of “special settlements” grew as Chechens, Ingushes, Crimean Tatars, Kurds and Greek political migrants were resettled forcefully into various regions of Central Asia (Polyan, 2001; Berdinskikh, 2005). For instance, a relatively large group of around 60,000 Meskhetian Turks was resettled from Georgia to the Ferghana Valley in Central Asia in 1944 (Rubin and Lubin, 2000: 177). Almost 40,000 Greeks were relocated from the Black Sea region, mainly to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan during the same period (Bugai and Kotsonis, 1999: 55, 117).\n\n19Notwithstanding the adoption of strict policies such as the introduction of mandatory registration at the place of residence and the internal passport system, there seems to have been some difference between policy and practice. Lewis and Rowland as Buckley state that in reality, those wishing to change their place of residence succeeded in doing so by using informal channels. Lewis and Rowland argue that despite the common understanding in the West that Stalinist policies severely restricted mobility, one should contextualize the migration regulations of that time. The decline of the economy, extreme poverty, starvation and collectivization of the 1920s and 1930s led the population to move to urban areas. Between 1926 and 1939, as Soviet statistics states, 18.7 million people migrated from rural areas into urban areas (Lewis and Rowland, 1979: 25). In spite of the limitations imposed on the cities that were officially “closed” to migrants from outside through the notorious propiska (residence permit) regulation, many potential migrants sought different alternatives such as informal practices to attain their goals and eventually succeeded in settling. An elaborate study conducted by Buckley shows that in reality, the restrictive measures of the Soviets to control the vast growth of the cities were quite unsuccessful (Buckley, 1995).\n\nMigration Patterns in the 1960’s and 1980’s\n\nThe Presence of the Slavic Population in Central Asia\n\n20During this period the Central Asian republics experienced a sharp increase of demographic growth. The population of the RSFSR slightly declined, with the exception of some industrial regions (Gibson, 1991: 152). The statistical data on the changes of residence of individuals within the USSR show that the population of the Central Asian republics remained relatively immobile, whereas in RSFSR people showed more mobility and moved between different regions (Lubin, 1984: 41; Gibson, 1991). For the period of 1959-1979, the Central Asian republics report the following data on the increase of the population among the titular nationalities: Uzbekistan (6.7%), Kyrgyzstan (7.5%), and Tajikistan (5.8%) (Islamov, 2000: 182).\n\n21With Khrushchev's arrival to power in 1956 and his policy of de-Stalinization, control over workers’ mobility was loosened. Through the orgnabors (the aforementioned organized labor recruiting service), the government continued to administer the distribution of labor force, relocating 28 million people in the period between 1930 and 1970. This organized recruitment was not mandatory, however. From 1951 until 1970, the number of resettled workers decreased, totaling merely 573,100 in the period of 1966-1970 (Lewis and Rowland, 1979: 19; Lubin, 1984: 42-43).\n\n22By the mid-1970s collective farmers that reached the age of 15 were permitted to obtain internal passports with which they were able to travel longer distances. The sources provided by Islamov (2000) suggest that in the time period of 1959-1979, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan saw an increase of 13.1%, 8.5%, and 10.9% of ethnic Russians, respectively. By 1970, around 30 million Russians were residing in areas primarily inhabited by non-Russians that were located beyond the administrative borders of the RSFSR. This number constituted 23 percent of the overall Russian population. Between 1979 and 1989, however, more Russians were reported to have left Central Asia than to have arrived (Shigabdinov and Nikitenko, 2000: 104). Gibson notes that the number of migrants from RSFSR to Central Asia dropped by 50% during the period of 1971-1980 (Gibson, 1991: 153). The post-Stalinist period was marked by the redistribution of power and education and employment opportunities among Russian-speaking professionals and representatives of the so-called titular nationality. As argued by Korobkov (2008: 71), with regional governing bodies in Central Asia promoting more employment and education opportunities for the titular nationality, Russian speakers were pushed to take lower-level jobs which in turn led them to leave the region.\n\nEmigration of the Jewish Population\n\n25The second approach is related to social changes occurring within the confines of the USSR, and shifts the external factors to the background. The extent to which the Jewish out-migration took place is explained in terms of the Soviet preventive policy of a sudden deficit in labor force, particularly in the technical and scientific spheres. A further reason is argued to have been individual decision making: some had merely no desire to abandon the society in which they had been brought up, whereas others were induced to emigrate by having heard the stories of their friends and relatives.\n\n27Although Western scholars working on this subject claim that, due to the anti-Semitism that was present during the Soviet Union, the overall percentage of Jews who obtained higher education was only 1% in the entire USSR, having lived in the vicinity of a Jewish district, I cannot confirm the accuracy of such a low percentage in Central Asia. What became easily noticeable throughout the last two decades of the Soviet era was the absence of Jewish academicians, university professors, teachers, medical doctors, and scientists. In addition to brain-drain, the emigration of Jews meant the ultimate loss of a culture which was unique in its own, that had been developed and passed on through generations. Inherent to it were architecture, artisanship, music, and art of which almost no traces are left, and to which scholars focusing on emigration generally tend to pay too little attention.\n\n“Friendship of Nations” and Construction of a Multiethnic Soviet Society: Education Migration, Internationalization of the Division of Labor and Solidarity among Nations\n\n28In 1966, an earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale devastated the city of Tashkent, the capital of Uzbek SSR. Immediately, it became a major incentive for the Soviet authorities to reconstruct a new modern city that would embody the Soviet rhetoric of the “friendship of nations”. The Soviet urban planners took necessary advantage of the damage caused by this natural disaster. They wiped out the majority of the residential buildings in the old town of Tashkent. The reconstruction efforts involved construction of multi-storied concrete residential buildings, schools, and hospitals, as well as creation of new industries and measures to develop infrastructure. This resulted in the inflow of thousands of migrants, particularly from the Slavic regions of the USSR. Around 30,000 people are estimated to have settled yearly during the early 1970s, all of them set to design Tashkent as a multicultural city epitomizing the “friendship of nations” (Lubin, 1984: 42; Roman, 2002; Sahadeo, 2007).\n\n29What is interesting and has been neglected in the research is that immediately after the earthquake, some higher education institutions in Tashkent evacuated their students and transferred them to the RSFSR. Despite scarce research which has been done particularly on the issue of outmigration after the earthquake, empirical data for the present study has indicated that some students among this generation settled in their new locations in Russia permanently. During my field research I encountered a case in which one of the former students had meanwhile become an important person in a patronage network of Central Asian migrants.\n\n30Along with the Russification policies and the efforts to raise the level of education in the less-developed peripheries of the USSR such as the Caucasus and Central Asia, the late 1960s through early 1980s was a period during which the educated youth, often the children of the party cadres and education elites, went to Russia to study at higher education institutions. Many of them came back to their region of origin as expected and pursued promising careers; some, however, chose to settle in Russia. From 2004-2007, Sahadeo conducted a survey with this precise category of migrants who had lived in the cities of Leningrad and Moscow during the Soviet era, who serve as evidence for the existence of an entire generation of education migrants in Russia and who recount different attitudes they received in their Slavic host societies (Sahadeo, 2007).\n\n31Research conducted by Lubin in late 1970s, which focuses mainly on Soviet Uzbekistan, brings two further aspects into the foreground, whose are of great significance for the present study: firstly, according to Lubin, the Central Asian (specifically Uzbek SSR) workable population migrated to the RSFSR for vocational, professional, and educational purposes. Secondly, she mentions that the Soviet Army served as a channel through which male migrants from Central Asia were allocated to different Russian cities. Lubin states that no data had been published on those migrants who had chosen not to return to Uzbekistan and that the individuals she had interviewed showed strong willingness to return to Uzbekistan (Lubin, 1984: 43). However, we do know in the meantime that some migrants did opt to stay permanently in Russia. Indeed, census data indicates that in 1959, 42,000 Uzbeks were residing outside the territory of the Central Asian region. In 1979 the number of such migrants doubled, but considering that the number of the Uzbeks in the entire USSR was 12.5 million, 91,000 residing outside Uzbek SSR, seems miniscule (Lubin, 1984: 43).\n\nRussia’s First Central Asian Labor Migrants?\n\n33Military service and education were not the sole purposes for Central Asians to migrate to Russia for longer terms. Contrary to the common impression that the current mass labor migration from the Central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union to the Russian Federation commenced in the late 1990s, sufficient data has been found that implies the phenomenon of labor force movement from Central Asia to Russia is not characteristic of the post-Soviet period. While I argue that the dynamics of labor migration has represented a new challenge to the newly independent states, there was a period not too long before 1991 when the Soviet state encouraged the able-bodied population of Central Asia to settle in the regions of Russia that had labor deficit for the sake of resource allocation and production.\n\n34During the 1970s together with urbanization and industrialization in the RSFSR, the party-state staged efforts to cultivate the virgin land to increase food supplies, which of course required labor force. Soviet demographers criticized and complained about the absolute reluctance of Central Asia’s workable population to migrate to different regions of the USSR to work. They stated that it was firstly due to a lack of education of Central Asians and secondly because the regions in Russia with severe labor deficit were not appealing to Central Asians in cultural, social, and material terms. The third argument was that the potential migrants were fairly satisfied with the environment in which they were living, regardless of the economic challenges of the period (Wimbush and Ponomareff, 1979: 11).\n\n35It goes without saying that the vast mobility of labor from Central Asian countries to Russia since the end of 1990s described in this volume has refuted these statements. What should be made clear is that there is significant historical data about movements of people from Central Asia to RSFSR during the Soviet period. In the second half of the 1970s, the Soviets expanded their agricultural development projects in the grey and brown earth zones of Moscow and Novgorod (known as the non-black earth zone, Rus. nechernozem) that extend to the north and the east of Russia, the territory covering Murmansk and the Urals (Wimbush and Ponomareff, 1979). It was planned that by 1980, the non-black earth zone would produce one-sixth of the overall agricultural production of the whole USSR (Wimbush and Ponomareff, 1979: 18-19). Development of agriculture in the non-black earth zone, the lower Volga, and Siberia, as well the establishment of Baikal-Amur Railroad, entailed engaging manpower from the regions with more labor force (Lubin, 1984: 43, 256; Gibson, 1991: 149). In 1978 the first group consisting of 1,200 Uzbeks was sent, and a year later as many as 3,900 were sent to the non-black earth zone to contribute to the development of agriculture (Lubin, 1986: 43). While both Lubin and Gibson provide us with marginal information on this topic and treat it within a broad macro-level study, I was able to explore some details of this phenomenon from newspaper articles published in the early 1980s.\n\n38Lubin's findings about Central Asian workers’ definite plans to return to their native regions resulted from her fieldwork which she had carried out in the late 1970s, i.e. shortly after these projects started. We can see from sources dating to several years later though, that a considerable number of these migrants did opt to stay. The scarcity of data on Kyrgyzstan does not mean that its population was not affected by organized interregional labor. As far as this country is concerned, only one source mentions that in the 1980s approximately 30,000-40,000 workers were engaged from Kyrgyzstan in other Soviet republics, among their 6,000-9,000 are reported as students from the Kyrgyz SSR. They were involved mostly in construction sites, in groups known as stroiotriads (Abazov, 2000: 231).\n\n40These examples describe that, firstly, the Soviet state made efforts to design a multicultural society and promoted cooperation between different republics. Secondly, by creating facilities for Central Asian youths to study outside of their region of origin, especially in the RSFSR and by sending young recruitees from the region to serve in the Soviet Army, the ‘merger of nations’ was sponsored further. Thirdly, through shifting different skilled human resources between the regions within the USSR, the Soviet state supported its own development through migration strategy that should be addressed as characteristic in its own way. Ultimately, studies conducted by Sahadeo, Roman, and Hirsch contend that the Soviet ideology of internationalization privileged Russians over non-Russians and thus engendered more ethnic discrimination towards the non-Slavic population in Russia.\n\nMigrations in the Late 1980’s and the Demise of the USSR: Wither “Friendship of Nations” and “Brotherhood of Peoples”?\n\n41In June 1989, when the USSR was facing a major economic crisis, interethnic clashes took place in the Ferghana Valley of Uzbek SSR between Uzbeks and the Meskhetian Turks who had been resettled during the Stalinist period. A fight that started at a small market kindled major violence against Meskhetian Turks in the cities of Ferghna, Kokand, Marilan, and Namangan. According to official reports, 171 people died as a result of the violent clashes and the vast majority of them were Meskhetian Turks. (Rubin and Lubin, 2000: 45-46; Megoran, 2002: 243). As a reaction to these clashes, the Soviet government relocated almost all 15,000 Meskhetians out of Uzbekistan (Rubin and Lubin, 2000: 45-45, 177).\n\n43In 1989, approximately 25.3 million Russians were residing beyond the borders of the RSFSR, which corresponded to 18.5% of all Russians living in the USSR (Zaionchkovskaya, 1999: 11). The late 1980s marked the period during which Gorbachev’s liberal policies and reforms had corollaries such as the rise of national self-consciousness, the declaration of Central Asian republics of their respective titular language as the official language, and the replacement of Russian party cadres by representatives of the titular nations. The latest waves of the Jewish emigration became concatenated with the permanent move of the Russian speaking population toward the RSFSR or the regions where Russian was still an official language, such as Kazakhstan. Towards the last years of perestroika and the beginning of independence, emigration of ethnic Russians to Russia increased rapidly. According to some sources, the number Russians living in Kazakhstan decreased from 6 million to 4.5 between 1989 and 1990. For the same period, the Kyrgyzstan lost around 34% of its ethnic Russian population. In Turkmenistan, where the percentage of Russians had reached 9.4 of the entire population in 1989, there are currently two percent of Russians residing (Peyrouse, 2007: 246-247). Additional incentives for Russian outmigration were the economic crisis in the USSR that resulted in wage differences between Russia and Central Asia as well as ethnic clashes that broke out in the region, which in turn bore discriminatory attitudes towards Russians that had until then been treated with privilege.\n\n44Towards the last years of the perestroika period, the USSR’s emigration procedures became less strict, its relations with the Western countries improved, and reunified Germany started welcoming ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union. Ethnic Germans who had been resettled during the Stalinist period in the Central Asian region and had started emigrating in fairly small numbers already during the 1970s began leaving in masses in 1990. The remaining Jews emigrated as well, switching their destination from Israel to the USA, then in addition to Western Europe, making Germany their primary destination in the 1990s.\n\nMigration Patterns in Central Asia and Russia in the 1990’s: The Fall of the Soviet Union and Further Increase of Emigration and Mobility Rate\n\n45Between 1990 and 1999, Germany received 1.63 million ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union in the framework of the German repatriation program (Spätaussiedler). Approximately 120,000 Jews emigrated from the ex-Soviet countries to Germany as well (Dietz, 2000: 1). The majority of these emigrants belonged to families who had been resettled forcefully during the Stalinist period to the Central Asian region, mainly to Kazakhstan. According to the data provided by the Statistical Committee of the Commonwealth of Independent States, 49,505 ethnic Germans left Kazakhstan in 1997 (IOM 1999: 76). From Kyrgyzstan, 2,183 ethnic Germans emigrated to their historical homeland within the same year (IOM, 1999: 91). The statistical information indicates that the number of ethnic Germans tended to be much smaller for other Central Asian countries for 1997. Uzbekistan, for instance, recorded the emigration of 917 ethnic Germans, Turkmenistan recorded 345, and Tajikistan, only 247. The reason for this stark difference is not only the large proportion of forced settlement of ethnic Germans primarily in Kazakhstan, but also the fact that many ethnic Germans emigrated already in the earliest years of the independence of their countries of residence and at a time when Germany did not yet require language proficiency for entry into Germany, i.e. prior to 1996. This is particularly true for Tajikistan where the outbreak of ethnic clashes and the Civil War in 1992 resulted in massive emigration and a sharp decline in the number of ethnic Germans. Whilst in 1989 33,000 ethnic Germans were registered as residing in Tajikistan (IOM, 1999: 139), the number of ethnic Germans and Jews that left Tajikistan between 1990 and 1992 amounted to 230,000, taken together (Bushkov, 2000: 155).\n\n46The emigration of ethnic Germans was not the only migratory consequence of the Civil War in Tajikistan. The violent clashes of 1992-1997 led other ethnic minorities as well thousands of Tajikistanis to leave the country. During this period 697,653 Tajikistanis were registered as internally displaced, however the majority returned to their place of origin in 1997. Thousands fled to Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Russia. The Russian Federal Migration Service reported in 1998 that 50,192 refugees and 126,625 forced migrants were residing in the Russian Federation. The majority of those who had fled to countries other than Russia had repatriated to Tajikistan when the conflicting parties signed a peace treaty in 1997. Those Tajiks who had been granted refugee status in Russia stayed permanently and have meanwhile obtained Russian citizenship. In 1997-1998, together with half of the 60,000 Tajiks who had fled to Afghanistan from the Civil War, Tajikistan received approximately 2,500 Afghans who had fled from the armed conflicts in Afghanistan. These people have meanwhile obtained refugee status in Tajikistan (IOM, 1999: 139-140).\n\n47The Russian-speaking population continued emigrating from all the Central Asian republics. Kazakhstan, while experiencing a major outflow of population, allowed all persons with Kazakh ancestry residing outside the borders of the republic to return to their historic homeland. By the mid-1990s, notwithstanding the repatriation of approximately 160,000 ethnic Kazakhs from the neighboring countries and due to large-scale emigration of ethnic minorities, the population of this country dropped from 17 million to 15 million. In 1998, the Government of Kazakhstan implemented a state-sponsored repatriation program in order to alleviate the demographic crisis. The program was conceptualized to facilitate the settlement of repatriates (oralman) by offering assistance to employment, access to a number of social benefits, and support of repatriates through integration programs (Darieva, 2005).\n\n48Similar to Kazakhstan, albeit on a much smaller scale, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan also allowed ethnic Kyrgyz and Turkmen migrants to return to their respective historic homelands from neighboring countries, although the governments have not yet opted to provide the returnees with financial means. The International Organization for Migration is currently working together with NGOs and the Kyrgyz government to promote the development of a legal framework for a return project of ethnic Kyrgyz called kairylman (returnee).\n\nConclusion\n\n50We have seen in this article that labor migration from Central Asia to Russia as it exists today has been structured by a complex array of political, economic and social factors. Through the historical trajectory of migrations from the earliest days of the Soviet Union until its demise in 1991, it has been illustrated that the population of the Soviet Union not only had strict constraints to movement but also was subject to forced relocations between different regions. Nonetheless, Soviet citizens increasingly engaged themselves in rural-to-urban migrations which expanded the urban population to a considerable extent. As far as Central Asia is concerned, it has been shown that the region continuously experienced as much in-migration as out-migration of people.\n\n51It has been illustrated in this article that labor migrants from Central Asia to Russia started to arrive already during the Soviet period. The current flow of labor force is therefore not an entirely new phenomenon. The party-state managed labor migration of Central Asia’s workable population to Russia in the late 1970s and early 1980s was to enhance production through the cultivation of virgin lands. Together with Central Asian recruitees in the Soviet Army in Russia and Central Asian students at Russian higher education institutions, this generation of pioneer labor migrants may have played a significant role in the formation of migrant networks.\n\n52In studying the current patterns of migration and, in particular, increased labor migration, we should bear in mind the ethnic heterogeneity of the population in this region. The three countries of origin (Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) share a common Soviet past: it started with the annexation of their historical territories to the Russian Empire, the process of administrative territorial border demarcation in the 1920s and 1930s and the creation of nationalities by the Soviet state, and it continued as the states underwent the Sovietization processes, including the ideological project of ‘friendship and brotherhood of nations’ that gradually molded the society in the region."
