The first people's republics were Ukraine (1917) and Belarus (1918). In the process of civil war, Russia conquered them, but it was impossible to conquer them by a brute force only, a compromise had to be found. And this compromise was a federal state consisting of \"people's republics\".\n\nanswered May 31, 2022 at 12:41\n\nAlexAlex\n\n38.6k22 gold badges8383 silver badges162162 bronze badges"
