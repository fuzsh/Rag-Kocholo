        "text": "Someone I know wondered why the Soviets included Samarkand and Bukhara in the Uzbek SSR despite them being Tajik cities.\n\nThat they were indeed Tajik cities--and may still be so demographically in spite of official Soviet and Uzbek statisitcs--seems clear.\n\n\"According to official reports, a majority of Samarkand's inhabitants are Uzbeks, while many sources refer to the city as majority Tajik,[70][71][72][73] up to 70 percent of the city's population.[74] Tajiks are especially concentrated in the eastern part of the city, where the main architectural landmarks are.\n\n\"According to various independent sources, Tajiks are Samarkand's majority ethnic group. Ethnic Uzbeks are the second-largest group[75] and are most concentrated in the west of Samarkand. Exact demographic figures are difficult to obtain since some people in Uzbekistan identify as \"Uzbek\" even though they speak Tajiki as their first language, often because they are registered as Uzbeks by the central government despite their Tajiki language and identity. As explained by Paul Bergne:\n\n'During the census of 1926 a significant part of the Tajik population was registered as Uzbek. Thus, for example, in the 1920 census in Samarkand city the Tajiks were recorded as numbering 44,758 and the Uzbeks only 3301. According to the 1926 census, the number of Uzbeks was recorded as 43,364 and the Tajiks as only 10,716. In a series of kishlaks [villages] in the Khojand Okrug, whose population was registered as Tajik in 1920 e.g. in Asht, Kalacha, Akjar i Tajik and others, in the 1926 census they were registered as Uzbeks. Similar facts can be adduced also with regard to Ferghana, Samarkand, and especially the Bukhara oblasts.[75]'\"\n\n\"According to the official statistics, the city's [Bukhara's] population is 82% Uzbeks, 6% Russians, 4% Tajiks, 3% Tatars, 1% Koreans, 1% Turkmens, 1% Ukrainians, 2% of other ethnicities.[43] However, official Uzbek numbers have for long been criticized and refuted by various observers and Western sources[44][45] and it is widely assumed that the population of the city consists mainly of Tajik-speaking Tajiks, with ethnic Uzbeks forming a growing minority.\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukhara#Demographics\n\nOn why the Tajiks were (at least in their own opinion) shortchanged, there is an interesting discussion in Richard Folz, *A History of the Tajiks: Iranians of the East*. I.B. Tauris, 2019, pp. 118-120\n\n\"But there was more to the weakening of Tajik cultural identity than merely severing the language from its broad Iranian heritage. In the initial structuring of the Soviet Union into constituent national republics in 1924,the Tajik ‘nation’ was left out entirely. Instead, Tajiks were accorded a mere administrative subdivision called the ‘Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic’ within the newly created Uzbek SSR. This arrangement left the Tajiks entirely under Uzbek control, giving them nominal autonomy over a much truncated territory consisting largely of mountainous, marginally productive lands that were sparsely populated. None of the regional urban centres –including Bukhara, Samarkand, Tirmiz, Qarshi and Khujand – was included in the areas allotted to Tajiks, despite their historical character as Tajik cities and the fact that most of them still had strong Tajik-speaking majorities. Instead, Dushanbe, then no more than a mountain village of some 1,000 inhabitants, was made the administrative capital.\n\n\"It is easy to imagine that this extraordinary marginalization of the Tajiks to the benefit of the Uzbeks was the result of a calculated policy on the part of Soviet decision-makers. In a 1997 book the Tajik academician Muhammadjon Shakurī (1925–2012) argued that the Russians preferred to give Samarkand and Bukhara to the Uzbeks because ‘the Tajiks were too religious’; that is, they possessed a system of traditional institutions – considered as threatening as they were ‘obsolete’ – that the Uzbeks did not:\n\n'Russian colonialists … viewed the Turkification of the population as being in their own interest, because Tajiks were more religious and the majority of the Ulema of Islam were Tajiks … whereas, among the Turks – especially the Turks of the steppes – religiosity was weak … [And thus] the Turkization of the Tajiks could serve this purpose, that little by little amongst them as well Islam would grow weaker.5\n\n\"Shakurī’s fellow academician Rahim Masov, meanwhile, in a series of very angrily written books on the subject, places the blame not so much on the Moscow-based Russian party cadres but more on the machinations of ‘Tajik traitors’ such as Faizullo Khujaev, Abdurauf Fitrat and Mahmudkhoja Behbudī, abetted by an overly passive and apolitical Tajik population.6\n\n\"\n\n\"Adeeb Khalid, a specialist in Uzbek history, attempts to clarify the matter by arguing that that ‘While the Jadids were discovering the Turkic roots of Central Asia and an affinity with Turkic populations elsewhere, there was no parallel discovery of Iranian roots or an affinity with Iran, and Persian never became a locus of national mobilization’. Khalid therefore suggests that ‘Tajikistan emerged the way it did because there was no Tajik nation in 1924. Persian speaking intellectuals and political actors did not identify themselves as Tajiks and did not therefore seek rights for a Tajik nation.’7\n\n\"But MuhammadjonShakurī contests this view, stating, ‘It is completely wrong to say that, in the1920s, the Tajiks had no national leader, that the intellectuals failed to shoulderthe responsibilities of national leadership, and so on. No, it was never so!’ He goes on to mention Sadriddin Ainī, Abdulqodir Muhiddinov, NusratulloLutfulloev and Abdurrahim Hojiboev as examples of intellectuals who claimed and defended Tajik identity.8\n\n\"Either way, ‘Tajik’ voices were largely absent from the discussions on national delimitation despite the fact that in the now-defunct Bukharan People’s Soviet Republic Persian-speakers had made up 31 per cent of the total population. Their exclusion is not surprising when one considers that Tajiks constituteda mere 0.7 per cent of the membership of the Bukharan Communist Party –formed by Jadidists in 1918 – as opposed to 49 per cent who identified as Uzbeks.9\n\nIronically the strongest and most effective voice demanding political recognition for Tajiks was himself a Shughni-speaking Pamiri, a young activist by the name of Shirinsho Shotemur who is heralded today as a ‘Tajik’ national hero even as the Pamiris seek to assert their own distinct identity.10 It was largely through Shotemur’s continuous lobbying throughout the 1920s that the Tajik ASSR was elevated to a full union republic in 1929. (He later served as head of the Tajik Soviet but fell victim to Stalin’s purges in 1937.) Not only was the Tajik ASSR in 1924 deprived of an important urban centre, about half of all Tajiks – including most of the educated urban professionals – actually lived within the territory of the Uzbek SSR proper outside the boundaries of their own nominally ‘autonomous’ republic. During the next few years many Tajiks living in the Uzbek Republic began to complain about this, until eventually a committee was formed to look into a possible redrawing of borders. The ‘Tajik Project Commission’ concluded with the recommendation that the northern province of Sughd (including the city of Khujand), plus Samarkand, Bukhara and the districts of Surkhondaryo and Qashqadaryo, all be added to the Tajik ASSR. But in the end, only Sughd was added.11 The Tajik polity was elevated to a full union republic in 1929, with Dushanbe being renamed ‘Stalinobod’ to mark the occasion (Khujand was renamed ‘Leninobod’ in 1936). Even after the inclusion of Sughd the Tajik SSR was the smallest in Central Asia....\"\n\nA friend of mine who has worked for some years in Tajikstan, exlained the \"Tajik persepective\" as follows:\n\n\"Unsurprisingly, it is that the Soviets were a bit nervous of the relatively civilized / organized Tajiks and wanted to keep them weak and divided. So they clawed off the two great Tajik cities and gave them to the Uzbeks, leaving a \"Tajikistan\" that was a mountainous rump state with few resources.\n\n\"There are no maps of \"greater Tajikistan) in the way that Hungarians or Serbs have maps of their historical / aspirational boundaries -- probably because such a country would plausibly be part of a Greater Iran! That said, there's definitely a consciousness that large chunks of Uzbekistan are inhabited by Tajiks, and a certain amount of lingering resentment about this.\n\n\"Now on one hand, there's a certain superficial plausibility to this. The Tajiks of the early Soviet period /were/ somewhat more urbanized than their Kyrgyz or Kazakh neighbors. And the Iranian connection might have been threatening in a way that the Turkish connection to the Turkic-speaking groups was not -- Ataturks's Turkey was friendly-ish to the USSR, while contemporary early-Pahlavi Iran was much less so. but on the other hand, Tajik national consciousness -- either as Tajiks or as Persians / Iranians -- seems to have been very weak in this period. (Indeed, it doesn't seem to have been an issue throughout the Soviet period at all.)\n\n\"Also -- and this is a thing that gets missed or overlooked -- under both Imperial Russia and the Soviets, the distinction between \"Tajik\" and \"Uzbek\" was very weak. Culturally the two groups were very very similar -- this is still true today. They practiced the same sort of Islam in much the same way. Intermarriage was so common as to be entirely unremarkable, and millions of people were comfortably bilingual. The distinction was still there, and it never disappeared, but there were times and places where it wasn't much more important than (say) the difference between two white hyphenated-American ethnic groups in the modern US.\"\n\n***\n\nSo, is there any way the Tajiks could have gotten more favorable borders with Uzbekistan? One possibility, as indicated above, would be for the Soviets to have had more hostile relations with Turkey in the 1920s and freindlier realtions with Iran. I suppose another would be for Stalin for some personal reason to be more pro-Tajuk. Stalin did in fact pay a handsome tribute to the Tajiks at a reception om hoor of Takjik art at the Kremlin in April 1941:\n\n\"I want to say a few words about the Tajiks. Tajiks are a special people. These are not Uzbeks, not Kazakhs, not Kyrgyz, these are Tajiks, the most ancient people of Central Asia. Tajik means the bearer of the crown, as the Iranians called them, and the Tajiks justified this name.\n\n\"Of all the non-Russian Muslim peoples on the territory of the USSR, the Tajiks are the only non-Turkic, Iranian people. Tajiks are a people whose intelligentsia gave birth to the great poet Ferdowsi, and it is not for nothing that they, the Tajiks, derive their cultural traditions from him. You must have felt during the decade that they, the Tajiks, have a finer artistic flair, their ancient culture and special artistic taste are manifested in music, song and dance.\n\n\"Sometimes our Russian comrades mix everyone up: a Tajik with an Uzbek, an Uzbek with a Turkmen, an Armenian with a Georgian. This, of course, is wrong. Tajiks are a special people, with an ancient great culture, and in our Soviet conditions they have a great future. And the entire Soviet Union should help them in this. I would like their art to be surrounded by everyone's attention.\n\n\"I raise a toast to the flourishing of Tajik art, the Tajik people, for us, Muscovites, to be always ready to help them in everything that is necessary.\"\n\nhttp://grachev62.narod.ru/stalin/t18/t18_092.htm\n\nAlso, see Stalin and Voroshilov in what apparently were Tajik national costumes in 1935:\n\nAs sometimes happened, though, Stalin's praise of the Tajiks was not entirely consistent with his actual policies...\n\nSomeone I know wondered why the Soviets included Samarkand and Bukhara in the Uzbek SSR despite them being Tajik cities.\n\nThat they were indeed Tajik cities--and may still be so demographically in spite of official Soviet and Uzbek statisitcs--seems clear.\n\n\"According to official reports, a majority of Samarkand's inhabitants are Uzbeks, while many sources refer to the city as majority Tajik,[70][71][72][73] up to 70 percent of the city's population.[74] Tajiks are especially concentrated in the eastern part of the city, where the main architectural landmarks are.\n\n\"According to various independent sources, Tajiks are Samarkand's majority ethnic group.

It was applied by others to the people in question, and not by the ‘Tajiks’ to themselves. From the tenth century onwards and up to the Soviet period, the term was most commonly used by Turkic-speakers whose intention was to distinguish the settled, ‘soft’ Iranians from their own nobler, braver selves. Central Asia’s Persophones, meanwhile, who became increasingly bilingual in Fārsī/Darī and Turkī over time, identified themselves primarily by other, non-linguistic criteria, such as religion, family, profession or place of origin. While urban merchants, bureaucrats and religious scholars wrote in Persian and can be assumed in most cases to have had Persian as their mother tongue, their ability to function just as comfortably in Turkī when circumstances called for it meant that language alone could not be their primary marker of identity. Most of Central Asia’s Persian-speakers at the dawn of the Soviet Union do not appear to have had in their minds such a thing as a ‘Tajik national identity’; this was constructed for them by others.\n\n\"This fact is essential to understanding how national identity formation worked so devastatingly against the Tajiks at the beginning of the Soviet period. The literate urbanites who succeeded in transforming themselves into the new Central Asian ruling elite in the wake of the Bolshevik Revolution would appear in hindsight to have been mostly ‘Tajiks’ (at least *potential* Tajiks, since we are talking about invented identities) in terms of their social class and education. Yet in the event, many of these same emerging political and intellectual leaders instead made the choice to identify themselves as ‘Uzbeks’ – once a derogatory term, now rehabilitated by Bolshevik ideologues to designate a newly imagined ‘nation’ – and to promote the development of ‘Uzbek’ identity and national interests, with catastrophic consequences for those who accepted to be labelled as ‘Tajiks’...\" Richard Folz, *A History of the Tajiks: Iranians of the East*.
