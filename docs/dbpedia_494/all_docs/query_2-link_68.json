In one legend tells that the son of an Iranian king Siyavush arrived in Bukhara, married the daughter of King Afrasiab and built a Ark fortress.\n\nThe natural wealth of the oasis of Bukhara attracted the attention of neighboring states and foreign invaders.

In 709 the Arabs after the bloody assault took the city of Bukhara.\n\nThe Arab domination led to popular uprisings. One of the largest uprisings of the time - under the leadership of Hashim ibn Hakim (Mukanna). This uprising became known as \"The movement of people in white robes\". It took a wide sweep and embraced the territory between the Amu Darya and Syr Darya. But despite the courage of the rebels, the rebellion was suppressed. However, after the uprising the local aristocracy became involved in public administration.\n\nWith the advent of the Arabs spread Islam in Bukhara.
