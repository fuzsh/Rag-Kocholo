They have remained independent until about 1924-5. But if I recall correctely the Khans were deposed already in the late 10s / early 20ies. After that they became the People’s Republic of Bukhara and the People’s Soviet Republic of Khwarizm (Khorezmian PSR). Eventually they were merged into a Soviet Turkestan which in the 30ies was divided into Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kirgizstan. By the way, there was another city Khanate in the same region (present Uzbekistan), Khoqand, which lost its independence already in 1876, during Czarist times.\n\nMark Sensen, 17 Apr 1996\n\nFlag of 1920\n\nimage by Jaume Ollé, 08 Oct 1996\n\nThe Khan of Bukhara went out of his country in 1919. Sokolov does not mention of the period (1919-20) but in other sources I read that the red flag with crescent and star was used. In 1920 the flag was adopted oficially.\n\nJaume Ollé, 08 Oct 1996\n\nFlag of 1921\n\nimage by Mark Sensen, 17 Apr 1996\n\nGreen over red.

In the upper hoist yellow cyrillic initials (BNSR) in sanserif.\n\nJaume Ollé, 08 Oct 1996\n\nVariation\n\nimage by António Martins, 08 Sep 2003\n\nA spanish vexillological magazine (Banderas [ban], perhaps?) shows a slightly different version: No hammer and sickle inside the star, “more closed” crescent and 2:3 ratio.\n\nAntónio Martins, 15 Nov 2002\n\nFlag of 1923\n\nimage by Jaume Ollé, 08 Oct 1996"
