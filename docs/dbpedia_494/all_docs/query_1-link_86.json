        "text": "Introduction\n\nBukharan Jews (also known as Bukharian Jews or Bokharan Jews) are from the territory in Central Asia that is today demarcated by the independent states of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Some folk tales assert that ancestors of these Jews were among the Lost Tribes, who arrived in this region after the Assyrian exile in 722 BCE. Most scholarship, however, suggests that the first to arrive were among those who were exiled (or whose ancestors were exiled) from the Land of Israel at the hands of the Babylonians in 586 BCE. They traveled eastward on trade routes, settling in Bukhara and Samarkand, Silk Route cities located in the region then known as Transoxiana. In the 16th century, the area was divided by Uzbek dynasts into two khanates: Bukhara and Khworizm (later Khiva). While Jews could be found across the region encompassed by these two khanates (and later a third, Kokand), they clustered primarily in the Bukharan Khanate; hence their name “Bukharan.” In 1924, the Soviets redrew the boundaries creating the republics of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, which became independent states in 1991. In 1989 these two republics were home to some fifty thousand Bukharan Jews. Mass migration—primarily to the United States and Israel—began on the eve of the dissolution of the USSR. In 2015 only a few hundred remained in Uzbekistan and far fewer in Tajikistan. With migration and new ease of travel in and out of the region, the once sparse collection of publications on Bukharan Jews has become numerous. Popular representations tend to highlight the group’s historical isolation from their Muslim neighbors, and from other Jewish communities. By contrast, interesting scholarship attests to the group’s longstanding cultural ties with the Uzbeks and Tajiks among whom they lived, and with Jews across the globe (through itinerant teachers, fundraisers, travelers, merchants, pilgrims, migrants, and book circulation). Because Bukharan Jews lived through major geopolitical shifts throughout their history, and because those who emigrated since the late 19th century have had varied migration experiences, comprehensive study of the group’s historical and contemporary situation requires competency in several unrelated languages (Hebrew, Russian, Judeo-Tajik, as well as English and German for those interested in migration experiences), as well as expertise in various seemingly disconnected historical processes. As a result, the body of scholarship is highly fragmented. Publications tend to examine the group through a variety of non-overlapping lenses: the study of Zionism (with a focus on ties to and settlement in pre-state Israel), Russian colonialism, the Soviet and post-Soviet experience, the history of Jews of Muslim Lands, Mizrahi Jewish culture, and the immigrant experience. Work to synthesize these aspects of Bukharan Jews’ experiences is still waiting to be done."
