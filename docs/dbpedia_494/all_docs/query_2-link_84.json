        "text": "I‘d\n\nI’d\n\nput money on the fact that you haven’t been to Uzbekistan\n\nand probably couldn’t point to it on a map without a little\n\nhead-scratching. One of only two doubly landlocked countries in the\n\nworld (the other is Liechtenstein), the storied cities scattered\n\nacross the grasslands, deserts and valleys that make up Uzbekistan\n\nwere once the beating heart of the ancient Silk Road\n\ntrade route connecting\n\nChina with the Middle East and the Mediterranean. Today,\n\nhowever, the country receives only a handful of foreign visitors,\n\nwhile most citizens don’t even have a passport.\n\nReactions to my trip range from the somewhat depressing “Is that\n\nwhere Borat’s from?!” (nope, that’s Kazakhstan, and he’s not a real\n\nperson FYI) to the blinkered yet not uncommon “why on earth would\n\nyou want to visit a ‘Stan’?!”. Despite being Central Asia’s most\n\npopulous country and one of the world’s richest nations in terms of\n\nresources (large oil and gas reserves mean Uzbekistan is entirely\n\nself-sufficient in terms of energy, while it’s also among the top\n\nproducers of cotton and gold), Uzbekistan occupies a thin slice of\n\nmy own knowledge, limited to vague allusions in my school history\n\nsyllabus that skated over the country in reference to the Persian\n\nEmpire and Soviet Union.\n\nThis cloak of mystery is gradually being lifted, however, as a\n\nnew government has relaxed visa requirements in a bid to attract\n\nmore tourism, and Uzbekistan doubled its intake of visitors in\n\n2018. Regardless, tourist numbers remain low; I can count the\n\nnumber of British accents I hear on one hand, despite following the\n\nstandard route tracing the Silk Road cities of Tashkent (the\n\ncapital), Bukhara and Samarkand. In Uzbekistan, you are off the\n\nbeaten track simply by being here, and in a week of constant\n\nsurprises, I glimpse oxymorons that both puzzle and delight as the\n\ncountry seeks to navigate a new path between an exoticised,\n\nreligious past and a modern, cosmopolitan future.\n\nA trip to this “land of a thousand shrines” largely revolves\n\naround religious sightseeing, paying homage to the spectacular\n\nmosques, madrassas (religious schools), minarets and mausoleums\n\nthat I had previously associated with Iran. These\n\nsacred places offer an opportunity for tourism following decades of\n\nauthoritarian, isolationist rule, and the country’s attitude of\n\ntolerance towards other cultures and religions will no doubt serve\n\nthis well. This happy coexistence of liberality with deep-rooted\n\nreligious beliefs makes sense; Uzbekistan is and always has been a\n\nmelting pot. For centuries, thousands of merchants of diverse\n\norigins traversed the country trading ideas, values and beliefs as\n\nmuch as they did goods.\n\nTashkent\n\nWe begin our pilgrimage in Tashkent, where this diversity is\n\nreflected in architecture that is a bewitching mishmash of ancient,\n\ncolonial and soviet buildings, jostling alongside one another in a\n\nbricks-and-mortar personification of the nation’s multifarious\n\nhistory. We spend a day gawping at towering, sand-coloured\n\nmonuments covered in a kaleidoscope of blue mosaics and tiles,\n\ntopped by voluptuous aquamarine domes that glimmer in sunlight that\n\nshines over 300 days a year. At nightfall we jump on the metro – a\n\nsubterranean contrast to these sky-high edifices, it’s a\n\nmagnificent labyrinth of palaces built under the Soviets, each\n\nstation individually designed by local artists and architects.\n\nOrnately constructed out of metal, granite, marble, glass, ceramics\n\nand carved alabaster, the aesthetic down here would make\n\nWes Anderson weak at the knees.\n\nWhile Lenin may have attempted to stamp out local creativity and\n\nculture in a bid to secure control, traditional artistry is\n\ncurrently seeing a renaissance. In a quiet Tashkent neighbourhood\n\nwe drink spiced tea in the fruit tree-filled garden of ceramicist\n\nAkbar Rakhimov, who modestly brushes away our guide’s assertion\n\nthat he’s the most celebrated potter in Uzbekistan. Instead he\n\npoints to his father, whose dream it was to start a ceramics school\n\n– an aspiration that Akbar has recently realised. Today, his\n\ngrandchildren are getting their hands dirty, deftly moulding clay\n\ninto figurines impressive beyond their years. It’s a nod to an\n\nentrepreneurial younger generation that is embracing modernity\n\nwhile trying to revive long-standing cultural traditions.\n\nI am surprised by present-day attitudes towards the era of\n\nSoviet rule. While my schoolgirl conception is largely one of\n\nsuffering under the iron fist of communism, the Uzbeks I meet are\n\nquick to point out positives such as the abolishment of sharia law,\n\ncompulsory education and a world-class intelligence system, the\n\nKGB, to whom many attribute the country’s internal security today\n\n(unlike Afghanistan, Uzbekistan has largely managed to quash\n\nfactions such as Isis). The impressive power of the old KGB can be\n\nseen in its behemoth headquarters in the town centre, an\n\nintimidating, modernist building that has now been nostalgically\n\nreimagined as the grand Hotel Uzbekistan.\n\nFamily remains central to Uzbek life, with girls marrying young\n\n– brightly lit wedding shops seem to crop up on every corner, while\n\nheavily made-up teenaged brides pouting for extended photoshoots in\n\nfront of various landmarks make for excellent people-watching. This\n\nfamily orientation means that, in a country where tourism is still\n\nin its genesis, it can be tricky to experience local life, as the\n\nmajority of people still spend their leisure time at home rather\n\nthan spilling out of restaurants, shops and bars.\n\nBukhara\n\nKnown as the “fairy-tale town” or “the Eastern dome of Islam”,\n\nBukhara is a holy relic with more than 140 historical monuments\n\ndotted across its new and old town. The crumbling remnants of a\n\ncity wall and a hulking fortress dating from the fifth century are\n\nan ode to the legendary emirs that ruled these lands for\n\ncenturies.\n\nThe focal point of the town is Lyab-i-Khauz, where a tranquil\n\n17th-century pond draped with weeping willows makes Udaipur\n\nspring to mind. It is surrounded by three of the most striking\n\nbuildings in Central Asia – Kukeldash Madrasah, Nadir Divan-Begi\n\nKhanaka and Nadir Divan-Begi Madrasah – each a mind-bogglingly\n\nimpressive example of medieval Islamic architecture. Our necks\n\nseize from craning our heads upwards to look at their vertiginous\n\npillars of ornately carved wood and inlaid mosaics.\n\nBukhara is also a city of artisans, a womb that has for\n\ncenturies given lifeblood to over 100 different crafts including\n\nmetal chasing, suzani embroidery, miniature painting and\n\ncalligraphy. The current government is making efforts to propagate\n\nthese traditions and we pay a visit to the home of Davlat Toshev, a\n\nseventh-generation miniature painter whose artworks sell\n\ninternationally for thousands of dollars. Bent over handmade silk\n\npaper, microscope in one hand, paintbrush in the other, he\n\npainstakingly daubs intricate depictions of ancient life using\n\nnatural paint, tempura and gold leaf while earnestly speaking of\n\nhis wish to reinstate Bukhara as the centre of miniature painting.\n\nBefore I leave, he places his hand on his heart and bows – the\n\ntraditional Uzbek way for men to greet or bid farewell to women –\n\nthanking me for visiting his country and urging me to spread the\n\nword about Uzbekistan in my own.\n\nIt’s a similar story when we knock on the door of his brother,\n\nRakhmon, a master of suzani embroidery whose cool, characterful\n\nhouse is like an Aladdin’s cave of Silk Road curios. Every surface\n\nis draped in technicolour tapestries and priceless antiques. Plates\n\npiled high with homemade plov – the hearty national dish comprised\n\nof rice, meat and boiled vegetables, scattered with raisins and\n\nlaced with cumin, cardamom and turmeric, this one topped with quail\n\neggs – Rakhmon explains that suzani remains an important part of an\n\nUzbek bride’s dowry, the meticulous needlework depicting flowers,\n\nalmonds, pomegranates and snakes not only symbolising love, wealth,\n\nhealth and wisdom but also demonstrating her patience. His children\n\nare taking the baton and becoming expert embroiders, and just that\n\nweek he’s sold several silken tapestries to a US art collector.\n\nFrom these celebrated brothers to the humble artisans that line\n\nthe streets of the old town and the workers we meet on an impromptu\n\nvisit to a silk factory, there is a profound dedication to seeing\n\ncraftsmanship thrive. As we peer through the turrets of the\n\namber-hued Ark fort that evening, it occurs to me that Bukhara’s\n\ncityscape is its own tapestry telling this story; the skyline is\n\npopulated by mosques and minarets which stand as proud relics of\n\nthe past, while cranes and ferris wheels point to its rapid\n\ndevelopment along an as yet unknown trajectory.\n\nToday, Samarkand is the cultural capital of Uzbekistan, and yet\n\nagain I lose Joel as he snaps endless pictures of grandiose facades\n\nand tiled domes. The gargantuan magnificence of these monuments\n\nnever wears thin, and I sit quietly in the shade and watch a group\n\nof impeccably dressed septuagenarians engaged in a high-spirited\n\ngame of chess, their periwinkle-blue shirts, navy trousers and saxe\n\nskull caps reflecting the hues of the mosaics. I steal a\n\nclandestine photograph of them and, at dinner that evening, Joel\n\nand I pour over our reams of images as we sip vodka (a Russian\n\nintroduction) and tackle a table that groans under the weight of\n\nfresh salads, herb-laden yoghurt soup, mutton-stuffed dumplings and\n\ndeep-fried cheese in a balmy whitewashed courtyard.\n\nIt’s only when I return to London and visit my parents for\n\nsupper on a decidedly less balmy terrace a few weeks later that I\n\ndiscover my mother visited Uzbekistan over 40 years ago. After some\n\nextensive bookshelf rummaging she pulls out a gloriously 1970s\n\nfloral-patterned photo album that I leap upon and eagerly begin to\n\nflick through. I skip past grinning portraits of retro outfits and\n\nquestionable haircuts and soon begin to see domes and minarets I\n\nrecognise. Not only that, I am stunned when I come across one, two,\n\nthree, four images where, upon laying the bright screen of my\n\niPhone alongside her faded snaps, we realise we must’ve been stood\n\non the same spot, down to the very inch. I flip over another page,\n\nand it’s then I see a group of impeccably dressed elderly gentlemen\n\ngathered around a chess table in Registan Square. They can’t be the\n\nsame group, but I like to think that the men that I saw were their\n\nsons, and that their sons will gather around the same table, and\n\ntheir sons after that."
