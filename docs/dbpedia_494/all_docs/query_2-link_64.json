        "text": "An architectural ensemble built around one of the city’s few remaining pools, shaded by mulberry trees that date back to the 17th century when it was built, this is one of the most pleasant sites in Bukhara. The plaza is framed by two madrassas and a khanaka - a lodging house. By the pond sits a statue of Nasruddin Hodja, a character who appears in many children’s folk tales in central Asia.\n\nSamani Park is home to two of the city’s most interesting mausoleums. Ismail Samani Mausoleum was built in the 9th century and, as the resting place of the Samanids - the last Persian dynasty to hold power, is an important Islamic landmark. Nearby is the mausoleum of Chashma-Ayub in which there is a natural spring reputed to have been brought forth by Job when he struck his staff on the spot. The waters are said to have healing properties.\n\nThis historical architectural complex was built in the 16th century around the base of Kalyan Minaret, which dates back to the 12th century. It includes the Mir-i Arab Madrasa and the Kalan Mosque, through which visitors can access the 105 steps that lead to the top of the Minaret. The Kalyan Minaret was at one time the tallest in central Asia. Sometimes known as the Tower of Death, in medieval times it was the site for criminal executions.\n\nBuilt in the 5th century AD both for military purposes and as royal living quarters, the dramatic and imposing Ark was a mini town within the city, which housed the various courts who held power over Bukhara right up until it was bombed by Russia in 1920. Now its ruins are home to various mosques and museums that chart the city’s history.\n\nBuilt in 2006, this 96-room hotel in central Bukhara allows guests easy access to the city’s main historic attractions. Part of a respected hotel chain within Uzbekistan, the Asia Bukhara Hotel is built in the style of a traditional madrasa and offers travelers welcoming three-star service, with facilities that include an outdoor swimming pool, business center with conference rooms and fitness center. The hotel also offers massage services to help travelers recuperate after a day exploring Bukhara’s ancient sites. Guest rooms include a modern bathroom with tub and shower, a minibar, air conditioning, satellite TV, and in the deluxe rooms, a safe. The on-site restaurant serves up national and international dishes and a bar and nightclub gives visitors the chance to socialize with fellow travelers and locals after hours. The Asia Bukhara Hotel is located in the heart of the ancient city, and guests will find many historic sites of note within walking distance.\n\nPositioned in the heart of the Old City, Lyabi Khauz Hotel provides warm Uzbek hospitality in a beautifully restored 19th-century house. All 40 rooms have been refurbished in a comfortable, modern manner with traditional Uzbek accents and mod-cons such as satellite TV, air conditioning, fridge, work desk and full bathroom. Accommodation is available as single, twin or triple rooms with the option of a Junior Suite for travelers who require more space. Among the highlights of this beautiful hotel are its original facade and a central dining room and hall with ornate tiles and antique decorations. The place was designed and built by architect Usta Shirin Murad, whose other works include the Summer Palace of the Emir of Bukhara and the Ballet Theatre. Not only is the hotel a valuable part of Bukhara heritage itself, it’s located in the historic center of town, within steps of the 16th-century Silk Road marketplace where travelers can pick up souvenirs and handicrafts. The Lyabi Khauz Hotel is also equipped with a business center, bar, 24-hour room service and laundry service. The restaurant serves up more than 100 local Uzbek dishes, plus international favorites and vegetarian fare.\n\nNamed after the legendary philosopher, astronomer, mathematician and poet, the Omar Khayyam Hotel offers guests an authentic experience in the heart of ancient Bukhara. With 22 rooms, including one apartment-style studio and several deluxe suites, this property features ornate stucco arches and balconies that overlook a central courtyard. In-room amenities include satellite TV, air-conditioning, fridge, work desk and modern bathroom with hairdryer. The restaurant serves up traditional Uzbek meals as well as European dishes, vegetarian fare and Korean cuisine. In the summertime, the courtyard sets the scene for an open-air bar and cafe, providing a wide range of drinks and a taste of local sweets. For the executive traveler, there’s a business center with internet access and safety boxes. The hotel also provides laundry services and access to medical care, if required. Many of this UNESCO city’s major historic attractions - the Po-i-Kalyan complex and the 5th-century Ark-Citadel, for instance - are within walking distance of the hotel."
