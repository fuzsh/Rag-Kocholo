        "text": "Land and Climate\n\nMost of Tajikistan is mountainous. In the Pamir system, which covers much of the southeast, there are several mountains more than 20,000 feet (6,100 meters) high. Among them are Lenin Peak at 23,405 feet (7,134 meters) and Imeni Ismail Samani Peak (formerly Communism Peak), the highest mountain in Tajikistan, at 24,590 feet (7,495 meters). To the south of this peak is Fedchenko Glacier. At some 45 miles (70 kilometers) in length, it is the largest glacier outside the world’s polar regions. In the north lies part of the Trans-Alay range, a component of the Tien Shan mountain system. Part of the southern Tien Shan—principally the Turkestan, Zeravshan, and Gissar ranges—covers east-central Tajikistan. Along with the other countries of south Central Asia, Tajikistan lies in an area with significant seismic activity, thus earthquakes—some of which cause severe damage—are common.\n\nThe chief rivers of the republic are the Zeravshan as well as the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya, two of the longest rivers in Central Asia. There are few lakes, some of which were formed by glaciers or avalanches that blocked existing streams. Largest of the glacier-formed lakes is Karakul.\n\nTajikistan has a continental climate, with hot, dry summers and very cold winters. The lowlands are hot and dry in summer, with an average annual rainfall of less than 10 inches (25 centimeters). Summer temperatures in these regions average slightly over 80° F (27° C), while winter temperatures hover around freezing. In the foothills it is cooler and there is more rain. In the high mountains the average winter temperature frequently dips below 0° F (–18° C), and in some places it can drop to –50° F (–45° C). Precipitation is scant in the high mountains, averaging roughly 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 centimeters) per year. However, moist air moving up into the mountains from the valleys can produce locally heavy precipitation, with an annual snow accumulation of 30 to 60 inches (76 to 152 centimeters).\n\nHistory\n\nLike much of Central Asia, the area that is now Tajikistan was settled by Iranian peoples by about the 6th century bc. Central Asia comprised various kingdoms and countries populated by merchant cultures and nomadic clans. Much of modern-day Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan were part of the ancient country of Bactria. Between about 600 bc and ad 600, Bactria’s location on the Silk Road—an important route for the exchange of goods between Europe, the Middle East, and eastern Asia—not only made it prosperous, but also encouraged the growth of a culture open to the exchange of ideas.\n\nIn the mid-7th century much of Central Asia was conquered by Arab invaders, who brought their culture and religion—Islam—to the region. By the mid-800s the region was brought under the rule of the Saminids, an Iranian dynasty that had wrested control of much of the region. In 999 the area, including what had been Bactria, was seized by Turkic invaders, whose culture and language strongly influenced much of the population. The name Tajik was eventually applied to those members of the population who clung to their ancient cultures and continued to speak Iranian languages.\n\nOver the next eight centuries, the Tajik people and lands were ruled by the emir of Bukhara (in what is now Uzbekistan). In the mid-1800s the lands were conquered first by the Afghans and then by Russia, which made the emirate of Bukhara a Russian protectorate in 1868. In the years after the Russian Revolution of October 1917, the region was incorporated into the Soviet Union. Many Tajiks were included in the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, which was established in 1918. By the fall of 1920 the Russian revolutionaries had extended their control to include the Bukhara region that encompassed much of what is now Tajikistan, declaring it as the Bukharan People’s Soviet Republic. Over the next decade the region endured numerous revolts by groups who did not welcome Soviet rule. The revolts were crushed by Soviet forces. Borders were frequently recarved, leading to changing designations of the lands as autonomous regions and republics. In 1924 the Soviets created the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic (S.S.R.) and designated a region within its borders as the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1929 the latter was detached from the Uzbek S.S.R. and elevated in status as the Tajik S.S.R.\n\nDuring the next 60 years, the Tajik S.S.R. underwent remarkable social and economic changes. What had been a fairly secluded society became the home to a significant, albeit small, industrial base. The cultivation of cotton was emphasized; large collective farms were established. A large portion of the population was unhappy with collectivization, though attempts at resistance were met with brutality. As was the case in other countries under Soviet control at the time, purges during the 1930s were not uncommon. (See also Stalin, Joseph.)\n\nDespite the hardships imposed by collectivization and other facets of the Soviet regime, the welfare of the people improved, particularly after World War II. The centralized economy and government brought expanded irrigation for agriculture and increased industrial development, as well as improved health care and educational opportunities. A strong sense of nationalist pride began to grow among the Tajik people, fostered in particular by Bobojon Gafurov, an internationally respected historian who served as secretary of the Tajik Communist party from 1946 to 1956.\n\nAs the Soviet Union crumbled in the early 1990s, some Tajik groups agitated for independence, while others voiced support for continued unity with Moscow. On Sept. 9, 1991, Tajikistan declared its independence. Two months later Rahman Nabiyev, a leading member of the old Communist party, won the country’s first presidential elections. Tajikistan joined the United Nations (UN) in 1992.\n\nAlmost immediately after gaining independence, Tajikistan was plunged into turmoil. Fighting broke out in April 1992 between government forces and an opposition composed mostly of Islamic fundamentalists as well as some pro-democracy groups. It soon evolved into a civil war. The opposition took power in September 1992 and forced Nabiyev to resign, but pro-communist forces led by Imomali Rakhmonov regained control of the country with support from Russian troops by November 1992. In November 1994 voters approved a new constitution and elected Rakhmonov (who changed his name in 2007 to Emomalii Rakhmon) president. By the mid-1990s tens of thousands of people had been killed and more than a half million had been displaced. The war was finally ended in 1997 when a peace agreement was effected by the UN, Russia, and Iran. Rakhmonov was reelected president in 1999 and 2006.\n\nThe civil war had devastated the country’s economy, and poverty levels remained high in the 2000s. Another problem the government faced was the difficulty of controlling the border with Afghanistan, across which large amounts of illegal drugs were sent from Afghanistan to Tajikistan and from there to Russia and Europe."
