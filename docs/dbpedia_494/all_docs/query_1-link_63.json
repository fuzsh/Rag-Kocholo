        "text": "Introduction / History\n\nBukharan Jews are an indigenous group within Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. They are known as \"Bukharan\" because they settled primarily in Bukhara, Uzbekistan but they prefer to be known as \"Israel\" or \"Yahudi.\" They claim descent from the ten tribes of Israel who were exiled to Persia in the fifth century. They speak Bokhara, a Jewish dialect of Tajik.\n\nWhat Are Their Lives Like?\n\nThe Jews of Ashkenazic descent have lifestyles that are very much like those of other Jews in the former Soviet Union. However, they were allowed greater freedoms than the Jews in other parts of the Soviet Union, and they tenaciously clung to their Judaism. While some of them work as peddlers, shoemakers, or barbers many have become factory laborers or workers on farms. In recent years, large numbers of Bukharan Jewish people have left Uzbekistan due to economic hardship and fear of a nationalistic trend in the government.\n\nIn past centuries, the Bukharan Jewish people have experienced much discrimination from the predominant Muslim population. They were forced to live in isolated parts of the cities, called mahallas, to wear special signs on their clothing which marked them as Jews, and to pay special taxes. Only in the last ten years have Bukharan Jews been able to give cultural expression openly without fear of persecution. Today, several Hebrew study groups have been organized and are growing stronger.\n\nDuring Soviet rule, both Bukharan men and women worked in factories that produced butter, bricks or textiles. Recently, they have returned to many of their traditional crafts such as shoemaking, hairdressing, tailoring and photography. The women are particularly known for their dancing at both Jewish and Muslim weddings. There are also many well-educated Bukharan Jews working as engineers, doctors, teachers and musicians.\n\nBukharan Jewish males were the heads of their patrilineal (descent traced through the males) extended families. Now, a pattern of separate nuclear families is becoming predominant. Bukharan Jews nearly always marry other Bukharan Jews. The parents of the groom send a matchmaker to the parents of the bride, and both dowry and bride-price must be settled prior to the engagement. They permit divorce and they have their own custom regarding the remarriage of widows.\n\nMost Bukharan Jewish families are typical nuclear families. That is, they are composed of a man, a woman and their dependents. To keep wealth and prestige within the family, the Bukharan Jews have traditionally preferred marriage between cousins.\n\nWhat Are Their Beliefs?\n\nBukharan Jews adhere to all traditional Jewish beliefs. They follow the Law of Moses by observing strict dietary laws, circumcising all male children, and observing the Sabbath. They also celebrate Jewish festivals like Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement), and Passover.\n\nWhat Are Their Needs?\n\nThe Bukharan Jews of Uzbekistan are uncertain about the direction of their nation. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Uzbekistan has been going through rapid and drastic changes. Anti-Semitism (persecution of Jews) is a possible result of the rise in nationalism.\n\nEach of these Jewish communities needs to be introduced to Jesus, their Messiah. They need prayer to understand their need for him.\n\nPrayer Points\n\nAsk the Lord of the harvest to send forth loving Christians to work among the Jewish communities.\n\nPray that the Jewish people will understand that Jesus is the long-awaited Messiah.\n\nAsk the Lord to soften the hearts of the Jews towards Christians so that they might hear and receive the message of salvation.\n\nPray that God will grant Jewish believers favor as they share their faith in Christ with their own people.\n\nPray that strong local churches will be raised up among the Bukharan Jews of Uzbekistan.\n\nScripture Prayers for the Jewish, Bukharan in Uzbekistan."
