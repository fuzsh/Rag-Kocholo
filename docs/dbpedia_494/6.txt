Introduction

Bukhara, the capital of the former khanate or emirate of the same name, is located between the rivers Amu-Daria and Syr-Daria. Its dominion was bounded by Russia, Afghanistan, and India. After the Russian conquest of Central Asia (1866) Bukhara became a tributary of Russia and a large portion of its territory was incorporated in the newly created government of Russian Turkestan (1868), In ancient times this region was part of the Persian and Bactrian empire. It was conquered by the Arabs in the eighth century and became the residence of the Samanid empire in the ninth century. The invading Mongols devastated the area at the beginning of the thirteenth century, but at the end of the fourteenth century it flourished under Timur with Samarkand as the capital.

After the Russian revolution of 1917 Bukhara remained a semi-independent emirate until the flight of its last ruler, Mir Alim Khan (1910-20). His regime was replaced by the Bukharan People's Republic (Bukharskaya Narodnaya Respublika) until it was integrated into the Soviet Union as the Bukharan People's Soviet Republic (Bukharskaya Narodnaya Sovetskaya Respublika) in 1924. Toward the end of 1924 it was transformed into the Bukharskij oblast' of the Uzbek SSR, including the city of Bukhara, while the Turkmen SSR and the Tadzhik SSR (until 1929 the Tadzhik ASSR) absorbed portions of Bukhara's former territory.
