It rolls out starting January 20th, 2023 in theaters across the country, and later worldwide, with upcoming premieres in London, Lisbon, Berlin and Durban.\n\nTo find a theater near you go to www.groundswellfilm.com\n\n“Ground Swell: The Other Side of Fear” is a feature documentary that takes you on a cinematic thrill ride as the best big wave surfers in the world tackle the biggest, most fearsome waves on the planet. Directed, written, and produced by multiple Emmy award-winning filmmaker Paul Taublieb, “Ground Swell” is narrated and Executive Produced by Academy Award-nominated actor Josh Brolin, and features Nic Von Rupp, Matt Bromley, Kai Lenny, Makua Rothman, and Bianca Valenti, along with a special appearance by Vini Dos Santos and what might be the legendary 100 foot wave ridden in Nazare, Portugal!\n\nSee the theatrical trailer here! Theatrical Trailer\n\nRave reviews are coming in for “Ground Swell.” Matt Warshaw, legendary surf historian said, \"Paul Taublieb has been producing top-quality work for years and years, and ‘Ground Swell’ is his best to date. As satisfying as it is terrifying!\"\n\nSam George, director of the Emmy-winning documentary “Hawaiian: The Legend of Eddie Aikau,” wrote, “The big wave surfing in ‘Ground Swell’ is so spectacular, so immersive, and so scary, that while watching you find yourself holding your breath and wondering how the heavy water surfers can possibly hold theirs in, around, and under five and six-story tall waves.”\n\nChas Smith, head of Beach Grit, the biggest surf website in the world, wrote “Giant waves and incredible storytelling…dare not to be moved.”\n\nThe film was filmed on location on an all-time monster day at Nazare, Portugal, and also at fearsome Jaws on Maui, the fabled Pipeline on the North Shore of Hawaii, and the sometimes deadly Mavericks in Northern California. With insightful, in-depth interviews, combined with bleeding-edge visuals, the film is an exploration of how big wave surfers battle fear in search of the ultimate thrill – and how what they experience can be an inspiration for everyone. “You’ll find the best times of your life on the other side of fear,” explained featured surfer, South African Matt Bromley.\n\nBromley and Taublieb also recently had a chance to sit down with legendary CBS Sports Reporter, Jim Hill, to talk about the film and Brolin's role as narrator. See the interview HERE\n\n“Big waves were meant to be seen on the big screen, and ‘Ground Swell’ harkens back to the days when surf movies were four-walled and played in theaters,” said Taublieb. “And it’s the first time ever the monsters at Nazare will be shown in a big-screen theatrical setting!” Taublieb’s other work includes producing the Emmy-winning ESPN 30 for 30 “Hawaiian: The Legend of Eddie Aikau,” and other work he's directed, written and produced include the Emmy-winning “Unchained: The Untold Story of Freestyle Motocross” and the acclaimed NASCAR-related documentary, “Blink of an Eye,” as well as producing the feature film, “The Vow,” starring Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams.
