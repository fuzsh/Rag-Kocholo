        "text": "'The Magnificent Seven' to begin filming in New Mexico\n\n'The Magnificent Seven' to begin filming in New Mexico\n\nNew Mexico Film Office Director Nick Maniatis announced today that the feature film \"The Magnificent Seven,\" produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures and Sony Pictures Entertainment in association with LStar Capital and Village Roadshow Pictures, will be filmed throughout the state.\n\nThe film stars Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio, Byung-hun Lee, and Peter Sarsgaard. The production will employ approximately 275 New Mexico crew members, nine New Mexico actors and approximately 60 New Mexico background talent.\n\n\"New Mexico is the perfect backdrop for this film and our facilities, crew and talent will help this incredible lineup of stars tell a great western story,\" Maniatis said.\n\nFrom a screenplay by Nic Pizzolatto and Richard Wenk, based on the 1960 theatrical motion picture of the same name by William Roberts, \"The Magnificent Seven\" is directed by Antoine Fuqua (\"Southpaw\") and produced by Roger Birnbaum (\"RoboCop\") and Todd Black (\"Southpaw\" and \"The Equalizer\").\n\nThe film follows the story of seven outlaws and gunslingers who band together to defend people from the killer who owns most of their town."
