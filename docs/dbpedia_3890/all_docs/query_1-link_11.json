        "text": "Movie Review: The Hustle (2019)\n\nMovie Reviews\n\nInterestingly, it is the audience who seems to be the ones getting hustled in director Chris Addison’s forgettable feminine con-artist comedy, The Hustle. In it, Oscar winner Anne Hathaway (“Les Misérables”) and funny fireball Rebel Wilson (“Isn’t It Romantic”) are paired as a couple of cute scammers looking to manipulate the finances out of clueless…\n\nMovie Review: Death Wish (2018)\n\nMovie Reviews\n\nInterestingly Death Wish, the millennial-era remake of the gritty mid 70’s crime thriller of the same name, notoriously arrives in theaters at an increasingly awkward moment in a divisive national climate (particularly in the aftermath of the most recent high school shooting) where the political stakes regarding gun violence in America are at an all-time…\n\nMovie Review: The Magnificent Seven (2016)\n\nMovie Reviews\n\n6 responses\n\nAntoine Fuqua’s The Magnificent Seven is set in a world where even having a drink requires vigilance. The film opens with Bartholomew Bogue’s (Peter Sarsgaard, “Black Mass”) hostile takeover of Rose Creek, a small mining community. This results in the deaths of countless settlers — most notably Matthew Cullen (Matt Bomer, “The Nice Guys”), whose…\n\nMovie Review: G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013)\n\nMovie Reviews\n\n20 responses\n\nLoud, confusing, pointless and plotless are not exactly words one likes to use in a film review, but in this case, these terms are more than an apt description of G.I. Joe: Retaliation, the second G.I. Joe movie (the Hasbro Studio generation, not the classic 1945 picture starring Robert Mitchum). And like the company’s last…\n\nMovie Review: The Vow (2012)\n\nMovie Reviews\n\nNo responses\n\nAlthough I got a review out of it (making the experience a humanitarian effort), I take great pride in knowing I’m one of the few men comfortable enough with my masculinity to see a movie like The Vow. If its premise — the “true (at least by Hollywood’s standards) story” of love and the lengths…\n\nMovie Trailer: G.I. Joe: Retaliation (2013)\n\nMovie Trailers\n\n4 responses\n\nBecause I was a big fan of Cobra Command in my youth, I smiled at the trailer for G.I. Joe: Retaliation when a large portion of the G.I. Joe team are shot to hell up. The smile faded shortly thereafter. Best as I can tell, this sequel (of the less than stellar “G.I. Joe: The…\n\nMovie Trailer: The Vow (2012)\n\nMovie Trailers\n\nOne response\n\nWhat good is Valentine’s Day without a nice big helping of sappy romance? Generally the answer is “none,” but today Screen Gems released the first trailer for The Vow, effectively telling the world that they’re doing their part to ensure there is tear-inducing romance ready for next year. Enlisting the aid of Hollywood’s favorite girl-next-door…"
