        "text": "The March 2-4 weekend wasn’t kind to movies not titled Black Panther.\n\nThe Marvel Studios film, in its third weekend release in the U.S., is generating an estimated box office of $65.7 million, according to Box Office Mojo.\n\nBlack Panther is nearing the $900 million mark globally, according to the website.\n\nA distant second is Red Sparrow, a spy movie with Jennifer Lawrence, at an estimated $17 million.\n\nThird is a remake of Death Wish, with Bruce Willis subbing for Charles Bronson. It’s estimated to bring home $13 million for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.\n\nIt’s the first film to be released through a new joint venture between MGM and Annapurna Pictures. That joint venture will release films for both MGM and Annapurna under their respective company names.\n\nThe producer of Death Wish is Roger Birnbaum. He and Gary Barber became co-CEOs after MGM initially came out of bankruptcy in 2010. But Birnbaum later dropped out and accepted a producer’s deal at the studio. Since then, Barber has been the sole CEO at MGM, which controls half of the 007 film franchise.\n\nFiled under: Comic book movies, The Other Spies | Tagged: Black Panther, Bruce Willis, Death Wish, Jennifer Lawrence, Marvel Studios, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Red Sparrow, Roger Birnbaum | Leave a comment »\n\nThe parent company of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the studio that controls half the James Bond franchise, may become a public company. MGM put out a press release late July 24 that read:\n\nMGM Holdings Inc. (“MGM” or the “Company”) announced today that it has\n\npreviously submitted a draft registration statement on a confidential basis to\n\nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for a possible initial\n\npublic offering of its Class A common stock.\n\nNo other details were available. MGM went through bankruptcy in 2010 and a new management team, led by Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum took over. Nikki Finke’s Deadline Hollywood Web site tries to read the tea leaves in a story you can view BY CLICKING HERE. You can CLICK HERE to read the Hollywood Reporter’s take.\n\nMGM was originally created in 1924 when three studios merged. Most classic MGM movies (Gone With the Wind, Ben Hur, etc.) along with MGM-produced television series such as The Man From U.N.C.L.E., are owned by Time Warner, parent company of Warner Bros.\n\nMGM’s film library includes the old United Artists library, which includes the 007, Pink Panther and Rocky series of movies along with the likes of West Side Story and In the Heat of the Night. UA also acquired half the Bond franchise when Eon Productions co-founder Harry Saltzman sold out in 1975 because of financial difficulties. The slimmed down MGM struck a deal with Sony Corp.’s Columbia Pictures to release the upcoming Skyfall.\n\nFiled under: James Bond Films | Tagged: Bond 23, Columbia Pictures, Gary Barber, Harry Saltzman, James Bond Films, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Roger Birnbaum, Skyfall, Sony Corp., The Man From U.N.C.L.E, United Artists | Leave a comment »\n\nNikki Finke’s Deadline entertain Web site says Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, negotiating with various studios to distribute Bond 23, to also co-finance other films.\n\nThe story, which you can read BY CLICKING HERE, leads off with a report that actor Javier Bardem has been offered a Bond 23, but doesn’t offer many details. The rest of the report talks about how MGM is trying to use its Bond 23 talks for larger things. An excerpt:\n\nDeadline has learned that MGM’s new leadership is trying to leverage the next Bond pic, and indeed the Bond franchise, to create more cash flow for the post-bankruptcy studio. The new brass, Spyglass Entertainment co-owners Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum who are now the Co-Chairmen/CEOs of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc, are in the middle of negotiating to make an overall deal for worldwide theatrical and home entertainment distribution of not just Bond but also MGM’s new product as well as its library of films. But what isn’t known is that, as part of that deal, MGM wants whichever studio is chosen to distribute Bond 23 to co-finance a number of films with MGM.\n\nThese set of negotiations have the potential to have a longer-term effect on the Bond franchise than any particular Bond 23 casting, even an Oscar winning actor such as Bardem.\n\nMGM and Eon Productions each control half of Bond. But if Deadline’s reporting is accurate, 007 is being used as the equivalent of Boardwalk or Park Place in a real-life game of Monopoly, IF the Bond-related part of the deal goes beyond just distributing Bond 23. It all depends on how far MGM goes in trying to “leverage” the Bond franchise and not just Bond 23. The Deadline story doesn’t explain further.\n\nThe other Monpoly players don’t necessarily like MGM’s tactics, according to the report:\n\nThere’s no doubt this is a shrewd move by MGM, but Deadline has learned it’s not sitting well with the majors. Top execs at Sony and Fox and Paramount and Warner Bros who are all involved in the negotiations to distribute Bond “are growing increasingly frustrated with the way that the Spyglass duo are playing one studio off another — and enjoying it,” in the words of one exec involved.\n\nHere’s why the Deadline story makes us uneasy. Harry Saltzman once owned half of Bond and tried to “leverage” it in other business dealings. In Saltzman’s case, he used his share of Bond as collateral for loans that eventually came due and United Artists bought him out, and MGM eventually acquired UA. MGM’s new management isn’t doing what Saltzman attempted. Still, the Deadline comment about how MGM wants to “leverage” the franchise makes us wary until we see how it turns out.\n\nFiled under: James Bond Films | Tagged: 20th Century-Fox, Bond 23, Deadline says, Gary Barber, Javier Bardem, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, MGM using Bond 23 in a game of Monpoly, MGM wants Bond 23 partner to co-finance other movies, Nikki Finke's Deadline Web site, Paramount, Roger Birnbaum, Sony Pictures | 1 Comment »\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Nov. 3. The home studio of James Bond (and half-owner of the 007 film franchise) made its filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York City. The filing also indicates that jumpstarting the now-dormant 007 film series is a priority.\n\nHere’s part of a story by Bloomberg.com:\n\nNew James Bond films may be released every second year starting in November 2012, MGM said. It aims to own 50 percent of Bond 23, due out that year, with an equal partner paying all of the production costs, it said. Later Bond movies would be wholly owned and funded by MGM, the company said.\n\nMGM is going to bankruptcy court to wipe out almost $4 billion in debt. The studio’s financial uncertainty prompted Eon Productions, which controls the other half of the franchise, to suspend development of Bond 23. MGM’s filing is the first time any entity involved in the matter has provided any kind of timetable for Bond’s return to the screen following 2008’s Quantum of Solace.\n\nUnder the revamping plan, Spyglass Entertainment co-founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum will take command of MGM, which will only produce films and TV shows and cut distribution deals with other studios. While most productions will be modest, MGM would produce a few large films such as Bond 23 and The Hobbit. Eon’s boss people, Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, haven’t spoken publicly about the Spyglass plan.\n\nThe studio’s statement on the filing tried to sound reassuring and said it’s anticipating the journey through bankruptcy court will be short:\n\nMGM has sufficient cash on hand, and the consent of its lenders to use this cash, to fund normal business operations throughout the Chapter 11 process. MGM has filed “first-day” motions seeking immediate Court approval to continue paying its employees, vendors, participants, guilds and licensors in the ordinary course of business during the entire Chapter 11 process, for both pre-petition and post-petition obligations. MGM anticipates that the Plan will be confirmed by the Court in approximately 30 days.\n\nFiled under: James Bond Films | Tagged: Barbara Broccoli, Bond 23, Bond 23 to come out in November 2012?, Gary Barber, James Bond Films, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, MGM files for bankruptcy, MGM says it wants to jumpstart the 007 series, MGM's financial troubles putting Bond 23 in limbo, Michael G. Wilson, Roger Birnbaum, Spyglass Entertainment | 2 Comments »\n\nWe may not be able to provide the answers but we’re good at asking questions about James Bond. Here’s our special MGM financial restructuring edition.\n\n001. How long will MGM be in bankruptcy court? Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. is going to file for bankruptcy as part of a plan that MGM creditors approved on Oct. 29. The filing will be what’s known as a “prepackaged” bankruptcy, meaning creditors are agreed on terms ahead of time to try to minimize time in bankruptcy court.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, in a story about the vote by MGM creditors, said the studio might get out of bankruptcy court in “a month or two.” The Los Angeles Times said it might be as little as one month.\n\nIf these reports are correct, MGM would get out of bankruptcy court in December or early 2011. But given the twists and turns in the MGM financial saga, you might avoid betting on a specific date.\n\n002. But Bond 23 will get back on track pretty soon, right? That depends on your definition of soon.\n\n003. Once MGM gets through bankruptcy court, what else might hold up Bond 23?\n\nFor one thing, the revamped MGM will be smaller and no longer release films itself. MGM, which controls half of the 007 film franchise, will be run by Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the co-founders of Spyglass Entertainment. The duo will have to cut deals with other studios to release films. There’s a lot of change ahead at the studio.\n\nMeanwhile, there have been signs that Eon Productions, the other half of the Bond film franchise, didn’t exactly move quickly on Bond 23, even before it said in April development of the film was suspended indefinitely because of MGM’s financial ills. The production company issued a press release last year about how Peter Morgan, writer of Very Important Films such as Frost/Nixon, would help do Bond 23’s script. Morgan has disclosed he never got past the treatment stage while questioning the basic Bond concept. That raises the question whether Eon wasted its time before MGM’s situation worsened.\n\n004. Can the revamped MGM properly finance a Bond movie? 2008’s Quantum of Solace, released by Sony’s Columbia Pictures, had a reported budget of $230 million. MGM’s business plan calls mostly for much-more modestly budgeted projects with occasional big projects. Presumably, Bond 23 would be one of those. The actual budget may depend on what studio ends up doing a deal with MGM to release Bond 23.\n\n005. Does (and should) 007 face some budget tightening? Chances are unlikely Bond 23 would be a bargain basement production but it remains to be seen whether it’s as pricey as Quantum of Solace. A somewhat less expensive Bond 23 might not be a bad thing; Quantum, despite its ample budget, was seen by many fans as not being as good as the previous 007 film, Casino Royale. A major unknown is what studio actually ends up releasing Bond 23 and the terms of its deal with MGM.\n\n006. What studio will release Bond 23? According to Mike Fleming of Nikki Finke’s Deadline.com Web site, there will be a lot of interest among major studios:\n\nIf MGM isn’t a distributor, the next installment of James Bond will be a jump ball. Expect Sony (which distributed Casino Royale) to battle it out with Warner Bros and Fox, but watch Paramount emerge in the thick of it because of the close relationship that the studio has developed with Spyglass since that company became co-financier of Star Trek and the followup that is in the works.\n\n007. Is the MGM creditor vote good news or not for Bond fans? Assuming MGM gets out of bankruptcy court quickly, it’s a positive step — but it doesn’t appear to jump start Bond 23 by itself. The Spyglass deal is complicated and was arrived at only after MGM couldn’t sell itself at a price debt holders wanted. The new MGM management team’s job is just starting. We also don’t know what kind of relationship the new regime will have with Eon boss people Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli.\n\nFiled under: James Bond Films | Tagged: 007 quesstions about how the MGM-Spyglass deal affects 007, Barbara Broccoli, Bond 23, Bond 23 indefinitely delayed, Eon Productions, Eon Productions Ltd., Fox, Gary Barber, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, MGM's financial troubles putting Bond 23 in limbo, Michael G. Wilson, Paramount, Roger Birnbaum, Sony, Spyglass Entertainment, Time Warner, What studio will release Bond 23? | Leave a comment »\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., which controls half of the James Bond film franchise, said its creditors approved a plan that would take the studio into bankruptcy court, cut its debt and install Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the co-founders of Spyglass Entertainment, in charge of MGM.\n\nMGM’s actual press release, WHICH YOU CAN READ BY CLICKING HERE, merely says “that the secured lenders voting in the Company’s solicitation process have overwhelmingly approved its proposed plan of reorganization (“Plan”). MGM will now move expeditiously to implement that Plan, which will dramatically reduce its debt load and put the Company in a strong position to execute its business strategy.”\n\nHere’s how the Wall Street Journal, in a story by Mike Spector and Lauren A.E. Schucker described what will happen next and why the plan got creditor support:\n\nMGM plans to file for bankruptcy protection in coming days, said a person familiar with the matter, and could exit court in a month or two.\n\nMGM’s largest creditors — led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and hedge funds Anchorage Advisors and Highland Capital Management — fended off a late-stage bid by activist investor Carl Icahn to upend the vote. Mr. Icahn made several offers in recent days to buy debt from other MGM creditors in an effort to prevent the studio from receiving the votes it needed to proceed with the prepackaged bankruptcy. Mr. Icahn pressed Anchorage and other large MGM creditors to abandon the Spyglass plan in favor of a merger with rival Lions Gate Entertainment Corp., a company that Mr. Icahn has been trying to take over all year as its largest shareholder.\n\nBut Mr. Icahn’s offers to purchase debt at a premium to where it currently trades failed to gain enough traction.\n\nUnder a “prepackaged bankruptcy,” creditors agree before on terms before a bankruptcy filing and try to keep time in bankruptcy court at a minimum. Here’s an excerpt from the Journal about timing:\n\nMGM had planned to file for bankruptcy as soon as Sunday, but the filing could be delayed until early next week, said the person familiar with the situation. The main reason: a deal just hashed out between MGM’s big creditors and Mr. Icahn.\n\nMGM’s largest creditors were on the phone with Mr. Icahn and his representatives for hours Thursday night and from about 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Friday, the person said. They made several tweaks to the Spyglass plan to appease Mr. Icahn and other creditors, the person said.\n\nEon Productions, which controls the other half of the 007 franchise, in April said it was suspending development of Bond 23 because of MGM’s uncertain financial situation. What’s not known is how quickly work on Bond 23 may resume or when the film could even be released.\n\nUnder the now-approved revamping plan, MGM will no longer release films itself, instead cutting deals with other studios. Also,the disclosure of Peter Morgan, hired last year to help write Bond 23, that he only wrote a treatment, or outline, and not a full script suggests Eon has a lot of work to do separate from developments at MGM.\n\nFiled under: James Bond Films | Tagged: Barbara Broccoli, Bond 23, Carl Icahn, Eon Productions, Eon Productions Ltd., Gary Barber, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, MGM creditors approve financial revamping plan, MGM's financial troubles putting Bond 23 in limbo, Michael G. Wilson, Peter Morgan, Roger Birnbaum, Spyglass Entertainment | Leave a comment »\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has a detailed story on its Web site previewing the Oct. 29 vote by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. debt holders that will determine who gets to run MGM: Spyglass Entertainment’s co-founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, or investor Carl Icahn.\n\nThe story (which you can read in its entirety by CLICKING HERE) lays out this scenario if the Spyglass plan gets the nod:\n\nIf it wins enough support—odds appear to favor it—MGM will file for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy as soon as Sunday, and the 86-year-old company, the source of more than 200 Academy Awards for classics like “Gone with the Wind,” will pass to distressed-debt investors more accustomed to reworking home-health-care firms and community banks.\n\nThey aim to be ruthless about costs. They plan to outsource to another studio the task of distributing films to theaters, then focus on the television business—cutting deals with cable-TV channels, video-on-demand services and online streaming companies, especially abroad….(Barber and Birnbaum) would make just four to six movies a year, most with modest budgets of $50 million or so, though allowing for an occasional big one.\n\nThe story, by Mike Spector and Lauren A.E. Schuker, includes details of a March meeting where creditors didn’t support a MGM management plan to raise $1 billion to make 10 “big movies” a year, eventually leading to the Spyglass plan.\n\nMGM’s half stake in the James Bond franchise is only mentioned in passing and there’s no specific information on the stalled Bond 23. Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, the half-siblings who run Eon Productions, suspended work on Bond 23 in April because of the MGM financial uncertainty. If the Journal story is accurate, one possibility is that the March meeting described in the Journal story is one reason why. Eon controls the other half of the 007 franchise.\n\nFiled under: James Bond Films | Tagged: Barbara Broccoli, Bond 23, Carl Icahn, Gary Barber, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, MGM's financial troubles putting Bond 23 in limbo, Michael G.
