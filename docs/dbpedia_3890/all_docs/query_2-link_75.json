        "text": "Tarak Ben Ammar’s Italian distributor Eagle Pictures, Spyglass Media Group and Hollywood agency UTA are among backers of Rush Hour franchise and Creed III producer Jonathan Glickman’s new venture Panoramic Media.\n\nStrategic investors for Glickman, the former president of MGM film group, include longtime associate Gary Barber, Lantern Entertainment and Pinky Promise as the producer targets a broad content slate encompassing film, television, digital and podcast. The Panoramic pipeline will expand upon Glickman’s existing slate of projects at Netflix, Amazon, MGM, Warner Media, Paramount and MRC, as well as his joint podcast venture with iHeartMedia.\n\nScreen understands the Eagle alliance presents European distribution opportunities for upcoming Panoramic projects. Recently Ben Ammar took full ownership via Eagle Pictures France of Studios Of Paris, the large facility he co-founded with Luc Besson situated outside the French capital. Eagle is a strategic investor in Spyglass along with Lantern Media.\n\nJose Gutierrez has been named Chief Operations Officer and Chief Financial Officer and joins vice president Helena Budnik, director Roni Stein and head of podcasts Alex Vespestad.\n\nGlickman is currently in production on Creed III, directed and starring Michael B. Jordan, Netflix series Wednesday directed by Tim Burton and starring Jenna Ortega and California King with Travis Bennett and Jimmy Tatro. He is in pre-production on Janet Mock’s Scandalous! starring Jeremy Pope at MRC and will soon start Jennifer Hudson’s upcoming original Christmas musical at Warner Bros and New Line and original podcast production Diane’s Inferno starring Maya Hawke and Alice Cooper with iHeartMedia.\n\nGlickman began his career as a producer on the Rush Hour franchise, While You Were Sleeping and Grosse Pointe Blank. He later served as president of Spyglass Entertainment when it was run by Barber and Roger Birnbaum, producing The Vow, 27 Dresses, The Pacifier and The Count Of Monte Cristo.\n\nAfter that, as president of the MGM film group working for Barber and Roger Birnbaum who were the studio’s chief executives at the time, Glickman revived the Rocky franchise with Creed and Creed II and shepherded James Bond instalments Skyfall, Spectre and No Time To Die.\n\nGlickman said Panoramic Media was a “strong, nimble structure that allows established and emerging talent to control the creative and financial destiny of IP and original stories”.\n\nBen Ammar said, “By leveraging Jonathan’s creative vision, combined with Eagle Pictures’ expertise in the international marketplace and strong support from its investors, Panoramic Media is poised to meet the ever-growing demand to produce quality, premium content for global audiences.”"
