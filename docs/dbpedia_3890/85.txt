Roger Birnbaum is an American film producer. He is known for co-founding the production companies Caravan Pictures (along with Joe Roth) and Spyglass Entertainment (alongside Gary Barber). He has produced several films for Disney under both labels.

In his early years, Birnbaum served as producer under his Caravan label for several Disney films, such as Angels in the Outfield, Heavyweights, The Big Green, RocketMan, as well as films distributed by Touchstone Pictures (like I Love Trouble and Metro) and Hollywood Pictures (such as Celtic Pride, Powder, and Holy Man). In 1998, Birnbaum left Caravan to co-found Spyglass Entertainment. In 1999, however, shortly after the release of Inspector Gadget, Caravan closed its doors.
