Background

This is the production company of Roger Birnbaum. "Birnbaum" is German for "pear tree", hence the logo.

Logo (January 17, 1997-August 10, 2007)

Visuals: On a black background, a green pear with a fingerprint pattern appears. Below, there is the text "ROGER BIRNBAUM" in a serif font, with a line below it and the spaced out word "PRODUCTIONS" underneath, also in serif.

Technique: A still, digitally-edited graphic.

Audio: None, the closing theme of the movie, or in the case of Angels in the Infield ABC airings, a network generic theme.
