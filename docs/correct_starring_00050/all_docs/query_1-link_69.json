        "text": "I never saw “Mad Max” in the cinema. In fact, I believe the only “Mad Max” film I saw in a theatre was “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome”. But I know that’s true of a lot of folks – “Max” really caught on on VHS (though in my case, I had the first two films on BETA) so by the time “Thunderdome” rolled around, every man and his dog had snapped up tickets to those advance screenings they had. Wished I’d seen “Max” in a theatre though – it’s such a great film, and I can only imagine the energy that would’ve seamed off a nice, crisp 35mm print. If I were in Sydney next Wednesday, which at this stage looks unlikely, I could fulfill that wish. Popcorn Taxi is screening the classic on the BIG SCREEN- with the original goddamn cast and crew!\n\nHere’s the Press Release\n\nPOPCORN TAXI\n\npresents the opening night of The Australian Film Festival\n\nMAD MAX\n\nBACK ON THE BIG SCREEN FOR ONE NIGHT ONLY!\n\nFollowed by a live audience Q&A with original cast and crew!\n\n(both The Bronze and the bikers)\n\nConfirmed thus far:\n\nSteve Bisley – THE GOOSE\n\nHugh Keays-Byrne – THE TOECUTTER\n\nJoanne Samuel – JESSIE\n\nTim Burns – JOHNNY THE BOY\n\nRoger Ward – FIFI\n\nPaul Johnstone – CUNDALINI\n\nGrant Page – THE GREATEST STUNTMAN ALIVE!\n\n(more guests TBC!)\n\nWEDNESDAY FEB 24 – 7PM\n\nRITZ CINEMAS\n\nSt Pauls Street, Randwick\n\nBOOK TIX HERE\n\nhttp://purchase.tickets.com/buy/TicketPurchase?agency=POPCORNTAXI&organ_val=22564&pid=6700188\n\nThe Australian film that changed it all.\n\nMad Max is set in a dystopian near-future society suffering from a prolonged fuel shortage. Civil order is rapidly deteriorating and lawless gangs rampage across the desolate landscape, in defiance of the crumbling police force, the Main Force Patrol (MFP).\n\nAn escaped cop killer, the Nightrider, is killed during a high-speed pursuit by a young MFP patrolman, Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson). The Nightrider’s comrades, a motorcycle gang led by the Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne), hold Max and his partner ‘the Goose’ (Steve Bisley) responsible\n\nA chain of events will force Max to throw away his moral and civil responsibilities and with the help of a super-charged V8 XB Falcon coupe… it’s war.\n\nFor thirty years, this movie held a record in The Guinness Book of Records as the highest profit-to-cost ratio of a motion picture ever, conceding only in 2009 to Paranormal Activity.\n\nPopcorn Taxi is proud to bring this Australian Icon to the big screen for one night only to launch the Australian Film Festival – and give old and new audiences the chance to experience one of the most influential films of all time.\n\nBOOK TIX HERE\n\nhttp://purchase.tickets.com/buy/TicketPurchase?agency=POPCORNTAXI&organ_val=22564&pid=6700188"
