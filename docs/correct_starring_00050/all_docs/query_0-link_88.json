The film’s ultra-low budget unintentionally enhances the carnage with kinetic, machine-gun-like editing, forcing the audience to fill in the horrific gaps in their minds. Cheap, but very effective.\n\nWhile it wows with its high-octane thrills, Mad Max wobbles off course with its plotting — the final act feels incorrectly assembled and unnecessarily rushed — as well as an ill-fitting Brian May (not that one) score that frequently overwhelms the film’s crucial quiet moments.\n\nIn his first leading role, Mel Gibson is a mostly silent protagonist, demonstrating early glimpses of his blockbuster-destined talent mostly with baby-faced expressions. Steve Bisley lends the picture its considerable Aussie charm, while Hugh Keays-Byrne makes an impact with a fly curiously never far away from his ominous, cult-like gang leader.\n\nThanks for reading! If you liked this, please hit the clap button and follow me here for more thoughts on film. I try to post at least one new review per day.\n\nYou can also find me on Letterboxd where I try (and mostly fail) to keep up with the kids and their witty meme reviews. You know the kind.\n\nAction Film Reviews\n\nEdit description\n\nrautha.medium.com"
