        "text": "On 10 January 1506, a delegation of the Burgundian court, led by Philip I of Castile, prepared to set sail for Spain. Joined by his wife, Juana, daughter of the Catholic Kings of Spain, Philip had chosen to travel with his army by sea to avoid setting foot in the land of Spain’s hostile enemy, France. This route took them through the English channel, a notoriously volatile passageway that, during the harsh and unpredictable winter, few 16th century seafarers would dare cross unless it was absolutely necessary.\n\nUndanted, and with great pomp and ceremony, the royal couple sailed out of the Dutch port of Arnemuiden followed by a flotilla of colourfully-painted ships, their ‘trumpets and minstrels playing and singing’ as they whipped past Calais. On the second night of the journey, however, Philip and Juana’s fleet was struck with violent storms, strong winds, and as their ships rocked upon the Channel’s tempestuous waves, the royal couple embraced their fellow passengers and prepared for a dignified death.\n\nBut two days later, as rains and winds continued to bore down on England, Philip’s secretary arrived in London with a letter for King Henry VII of England: the archduke lived, and had come ashore at Melcombe Regis.\n\nThe England on which Juana and Philip had washed ashore was a sombre place. Only three years had passed since the tragic death of Henry VII’s wife, Elizabeth of York, shortly after the death of his son and heir, Arthur. With only one surviving son, who was not yet fifteen, the line of succession was more precarious than ever. Meanwhile, Arthur’s widow, Katherine of Aragon, was a virtual prisoner in England. Penniless and caught between her father’s duplicity and Henry’s matrimonial plans for his heir to the throne, Katherine could scarcely provide for her servant’s wages, much less new dresses to replace the tattered ones she had worn since Arthur’s early demise.\n\nThe King’s inner-world had grown dreary in the years since Elizabeth and Arthur’s death. However, news that a foreign prince had landed on England’s shores immediately brightened his mood. Quickly grasping the importance of the Burgundians’ unexpected visit, Henry set about refurbishing Windsor Castle with fresh rushes, gleaming tapestries, lavish plate and silken hangings in order to host such a distinguished guest. On 31 January, the King dispatched his only surviving son, Prince Henry, to meet Philip in state at the old palace of Winchester.\n\nHenry and Philip’s relationship has been described as one of friendship at first sight. When Henry reached the archduke at Winchester, the two princes conversed over tables laden with pastries and shimmering jewels in fluent, open French. At first glance, Henry found Philip ‘amiable and lovely… quick-witted, bold’. Here, across the table from the budding young boy, was a man that embodied the vivacious, chivalrous virtues sweeping through Renaissance Europe that young Henry Tudor held in such esteem.\n\nBut Philip, like the man Henry was soon to become, was an individual of extremes, one of sharp sensuality and strict piety, political insecurity and acumen. Physically vigorous, he was also charismatic and extroverted, easy-going and famed for his ‘fair’ looks, with his light hair, long Habsburg face, and full lips. Moreover, the archduke was a consummate ladies’ man who had abandoned his wife at Wolverton Manor in Dorset in order to meet with Prince Henry at Winchester. Although Juana’s love for her husband was fierce, it suited both Philip’s independence and ambitions to periodically claim that she was mad — victim to intense bouts of both melancholy and frenzied outbursts — in order to usurp her hold on the throne.\n\nWhen Henry and Philip rode out the next morning, an anonymous Flemish author observed that the princes appeared ‘good friends and brothers’. At Windsor, King Henry would treat the cheerful pair with elaborate pageantry, splendid feasts, hunting and hawking, dances, and Philip’s favoured albeit bloody sport, bear-baiting. Philip was treated as an honoured guest at Henry VII’s court and even occupied the King’s magnificent rooms, painted with Arthurian themes of chivalry and hung with rich cloth-of-gold arras. The height of magnanimity, the typically thrifty Henry VII spared no expense to ensure Philip’s lavish reception in England, and both housed and fed the archduke’s retinue at his own expense.\n\nHe encouraged his son, Prince Henry, to share in their celebrations, throwing the two together in the hopes of establishing a long-lasting accord. Together, Henry and Philip spent a month cavorting through the Tudors’ recently-refurbished palaces, hunting and playing tennis together, and dining with the King in his private privy chamber. On 9 February, Philip was created a Knight of the Garter at St. George’s Chapel, and Henry himself was invested with the ‘crimson velvet robes and mantle’ associated with the Burgundian order of the Golden Fleece (the imagery of which Henry would decorate his palaces and armour with for many years to come).\n\nAt the same elaborate ceremony, the two rulers inked a treaty which they pledged should ‘last for all time to come’. This pact would secure an advantage for the English cloth trade and dangled the possibility of Philip returning Edmund de la Pole, a dangerous Yorkist rebel, back to England. Prince Henry was able to witness this high-stakes exchange up close, witnessing how diplomacy and friendship worked hand in hand. His father was keen to emboss the day’s proceedings on Henry’s mind, pressing him to remember the deep significance of Philip’s visit and, in the future, to ‘be loyal to him and that you take care always to think of him before yourself’.\n\nPhilip returned home after spending three months in England. There were tears in the eyes of those Burgundians and Englishmen who were forced to at last part ways in February 1506. The visit, although unexpected, was a triumph for Henry VII — on his departure, Philip pledged to deliver the white rebel Edmund de la Pole into King Henry’s hands. Both Henry and his son, the future Henry VIII, had found an ally in Philip, and Philip in them.\n\nOver the next several months, Henry would compose at least two letters to Philip, whom he came to idolise, revering the archduke as his ‘most high, most excellent and mighty prince’. On each occasion, Henry promised to write to his ‘humble cousin’ ‘in the most affectionate and hearty manner that I can’. These letters were written in his own hand and held immense emotional significance for the young Tudor prince.\n\nTragically, Philip would die suddenly just months later, in September 1506, after succumbing to a brief illness. The news devastated Prince Henry. In his own words, he wrote that Philip’s sudden passing ‘appeared to reopen a wound which time had begun to heal’ — the death of his beloved mother. On hearing of the Prince’s grief, Erasmus, who first met Henry in 1499, wrote a letter of touching sympathy to him. Henry replied in his eloquent Latin, expressing his gratitude:\n\n‘Jesus Is my Hope\n\nI am much struck by your letter, most eloquent Erasmus, which is too elegant to appear composed on a sudden, and so lucid and simple that it cannot be supposed to be premeditated by so dextrous and intellect. For it somehow happens, that those writings which are elaborated by ingenious minds and produced with more than usual care, bring with them also a greater share of studied difficulty, for while we aim at a more refined eloquence, we lose, without being aware of it, that open and clear manner of expression. But your epistle, charming as it is in its grace, is no less transparent in its perspicuity, so that you seem to have carried every point. But why do I set myself to praise your eloquence, whose skill is well known through the whole world? There is nothing I can compose in your praise which is worthy of that consummate erudition. I therefore pass over your praises, about which I think it better to be silent than to speak insufficiently.\n\nThe news of the death of the King of Castile, my much lamented brother, I had received with regret long before I read of it in your letter. Would that it had come much later or had been less true! For never since the death of my most dear mother has a less welcome message come to me. And to speak the truth, I was not so ready to attend to your letter as its singular elegance demanded, because it appeared to reopen a wound which time had begun to heal. But those events that are determined by heaven, must be so received by mortals. Meantime pray proceed, and signify to us by letter any news you have, but let your news be of a pleasanter kind; and may God bring to a good event whatever may happen worth telling. Farewell.\n\nRichmond, January 17, 1507’\n\nIt has been speculated that Philip’s death inspired Henry to take up jousting, one of the late King’s favourite pastimes."
