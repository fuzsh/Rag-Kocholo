        "text": "Philippe I de France, duc d’Orléans (born September 21, 1640, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France—died June 9, 1701, Saint-Cloud) was the first of the last Bourbon dynasty of ducs de Orléans. He was the younger brother of King Louis XIV (reigned 1643–1715), who prevented him from exercising political influence but tolerated him as an overtly respected and covertly despised figure at court.\n\nThe son of King Louis XIII and Anne of Austria, Philippe was titled duc d’Anjou until he succeeded his uncle Gaston de France as duc d’Orléans in 1660. Orléans married (March 1661) his cousin Henrietta, sister of King Charles II of England, but he soon avoided her and became involved in a succession of homosexual relationships. Henrietta died suddenly and in circumstances that caused scandal in 1670. In the following year Orléans was married to Elizabeth Charlotte, daughter of the Elector Palatine."
