Philippe married her on May 15, 1092, despite the fact that they both had spouses living. He was so enamoured of Bertrade that he refused to leave her even when threatened with excommunication.

Bertrade lived on until 1117; William of Malmesbury says: \"Bertrade, still young and beautiful, took the veil at Fontevraud Abbey, always charming to men, pleasing to God, and like an angel.\" Her son from her first marriage was Fulk V of Anjou who later became King of Jerusalem.

Naturally the Pope was also having political problems with Philip at the same time, which might have had something to do with his displeasure. Leo van de Pas gave the 1093 date for the \"marriage\".\n\nBertrade was the center of one of the major scandals of her time. Married to count Fulk IV of Anjou, she was carried off in 1092 by king Philippe I of France, who married her (illegally, as she was still married to Fulk). After years of disputes with the church, which included putting France under an interdict, Philippe finally agreed to have no relations with Bertrade, in 1104. Bertrade continued to use the title of queen, but retired to a monastery after Philippe's death in 1108.\n\nSURN De Montfort\n\nGIVN Bertrade\n\n_UID 24FBFBE46867CA4CB83420432C93F63017E0\n\n1 UID 4288AF7D3412264E86432F9CDB8B534F4CA0\n\nDATE 21 May 2009\n\nTIME 19:23:43\n\nChildren\n\n1.

The oft-married Fulk IV, Count of Anjou, was married to the mother of his son Geoffrey in 1089, when the lovely Bertrade caught his eye. According to the chronicler John of Marmoutier: \"The lecherous Fulk then fell passionately in love with the sister of Amaury of Montfort [that would be Bertrade], whom no good man ever praised save for her beauty. For her sake, he divorced the mother of Geoffrey II Martel…\"\n\nBertrade and Fulk were married, and they became the parents of a son, Fulk, but in 1092 Bertrade left her husband and took up with King Philip I of France. (Other histories say she was \"abducted\" by the King, but I bet she was happy to go.) Philip married her on May 15, 1092, despite the fact that they both had spouses living. He was so enamored of Bertrade that he refused to leave her even when threatened with excommunication. Pope Urban II did excommunicate him in 1095, and Philip was prevented from taking part in the First Crusade.\n\nAstonishingly, Bertrade persuaded Philip and Fulk to be friends.\n\nBertrade bore three children with King Philip (who already had four children, including his heir Louis [our ancestor], with his first wife). According to Orderic Vitalis, Bertrade was anxious that one of her sons succeed Philip, and sent a letter to King Henry I of England asking him to arrest her stepson Louis. Orderic also claims she sought to kill Louis first through the arts of sorcery, and then through poison. Whatever the truth of these allegations, Louis succeeded Philip in 1108.\n\nBertrade lived on until 1117; William of Malmesbury says: \"Bertrade, still young and beautiful, took the veil at Fontevraud Abbey, always charming to men, pleasing to God, and like an angel.\"\n\nSee http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrade_de_Montfort for more information.\n\n--------------------\n\nSource: The book, 'Kings & Queens of Europe'.\n\n--------------------\n\nBertrade de Montfort (c. 1070-February 14, 1117) was the daughter of Simon I de Montfort and Agnes, Countess of Evreux.
