        "text": "Though Doug's hypothesis that Amicia might have been daughter of Earl Hugh 'de\n\nKevelioc' by a previous unknown marriage is technically possible, there are\n\nvery good reasons for believing this is not the case, and that Amicia was\n\nillegitimate.\n\nHugh, Earl of Chester, and Vicomte d'Avranches, was born in 1147. He married\n\nBertrade de Montfort (a cousin of the King, who gave her away), daughter of\n\nSimon, Count d'Evreux, in 1169, when he would have hardly been twenty-two. He\n\ndied in 1181, aged about 34, but she lived until 1227.\n\nThey had one son and four daughters, the son being Ranulph de Blundeville, Earl\n\nof Chester and Lincoln, who married as his first wife Constance (widow of the\n\nKing's son), daughter of Conan, Earl of Richmond and Duke of Bretagne (by his\n\nwife Margaret of Scotland).\n\nRanulph was born about 1172/3. His birth was preceded by that of his sister\n\nMaud, who was born in 1171. Of the four daughters who became heirs of their\n\nbrother on his death in 1232,\n\n(1) Maud married David, Earl of Huntingdon, brother of William the Lion, King\n\nof Scotland.\n\n(2) Mabel married William d'Aubigny, Earl of Arundel and Sussex.\n\n(3) Alice married William de Ferrers, Earl of Derby.\n\n(4) Hawise, suo jure, Countess of Lincoln, married Robert de Quincy [son and\n\nheir apparent of the Earl of Winchester].\n\nThus these four sisters married men of the highest rank in England--not just\n\nEarls, but many of the most powerful magnates of the realm. The Earldom of\n\nChester itself was a powerful entity, in that it had been granted 'princely'\n\nauthority that came with the Palatinate.\n\nNOW compare this with Amicia. She married, before 1181 [the year of her\n\nfather's death], Ralph de Mainwaring [Mesnilwarin], a local Cheshire gentleman.\n\nThough he was justiciar of Chester for about ten years, he was not even one of\n\nthe traditional hereditary barons of Cheshire. In an undated charter, Earl\n\nHugh granted Ralph three knights' fees to be held by the service of two, in\n\nfrank marriage [liberum maritagium] with his daughter Amicia [see William\n\nBeaumont, ed., _Tracts written in the controversy respecting the legitimacy of\n\nAmicia..._ (Chetham Society) 78-80:449-50; and Geoffrey Barraclough, ed.,\n\n_Facsimiles.of Early Cheshire Charters_ (Oxford, 1957), 46]. Was this a\n\nreasonal marriage portion for the eldest/elder daughter of an Earl?\n\nThere is a VAST difference between three knights' fees and an Earldom.\n\nThere are other compelling reasons for believing Amicia was not a child by a\n\nfirst unknown wife of Earl Hugh. The most prominent of Cheshire chronicles\n\n[Richard Copley Christie, ed., _Annales Cestrienses, or, Chronicle of the Abbey\n\nof S. Werburg at Chester_ (Lancashire and Cheshire Record Society)\n\n14:xvii-xviii, 20-1, 24-5] records the birth of Earl Hugh in 1147, his marriage\n\nto Bertrade in 1169, his knighting, etc. It is highly doubtful that this\n\nchronicle, which focused on the family of their patron, the Earl of Chester,\n\nwould have overlooked an earlier marriage, and that such a marriage would be\n\noverlooked in the Rolls Series as well. Also, the Earl and his wife Bertrade\n\nwere mentioned in many charters. If the Earl had had a first marriage, it\n\nwould be remarkable that there would be no charters involving her or that no\n\ncharters should be granted for the good of her soul (among the sould of his\n\nancestor, wife Bertrade, or others, as was typical).\n\nSo, (1) taking the Earl's young age at time of marriage, (2) comparing the\n\nlevel of marriages of the Earl's known legitimate issue to Amicia's match with\n\na local gentleman (not even a Cheshire Baron, let alone a peer), and (3) the\n\nomission of any mention of such a said previous marriage in chronicles,\n\nfoundation charters and accounts, etc., I see little reason to hold that Amicia\n\nwas the daughter of an unknown first marriage. Also, her marriage was granted\n\nduring the Earl's lifetime. Had the Earl's only son died before the Earl's\n\ndeath (a scenario which not infrequently happened), Amicia would have been\n\nsenior daughter and coheir of her father. Given this possibility it is even\n\nless likely the Earl would have married a legitimate daughter to Ralph and\n\ngiven them only three knights' fees in frank marriage!\n\nAt the death of Earl Ranulph, it was found that his holdings throughout England\n\nwere worth more than four times the value of the palatinate County of Chester\n\n[see Sir Geoffrey Ellis, _Earldoms in fee..._ (London, 1963), 108]. As such,\n\nrather than dividing the Earldom of Chester, the eldest daughter Maud was\n\nallowed the caput of the Earldom without division and the other three sisters\n\nwere satisfied with lands of like value elsewhere. Maud's son John 'le Scot'\n\nwas next Earl of Chester.\n\npcr\n\nIn article <19991007072524...@ng-cm1.aol.com>,\n\nreed...@aol.com (Reedpcgen) wrote:\n\n> Though Doug's hypothesis that Amicia might have been daughter of\n\n> Earl Hugh 'de\n\n> Kevelioc' by a previous unknown marriage is technically possible,\n\n> there are\n\n> very good reasons for believing this is not the case, and that\n\n> Amicia was\n\n> illegitimate.\n\nYou've given us all the reasons why Amice must be illegitimate but none\n\nwhy she might be legitimate.

If Earl Hugh was born in the\n\n1130's and if he had a first wife, it is entirely possible that his\n\nfirst wife did not enjoy the high social status that his second wife,\n\nBertrade de Montfort, did. As you duly note, Bertrade was kinswoman\n\nof the king. If a first wife was inferior in rank to Bertrade, that\n\nwould affect how people viewed any of her children, including Amice.\n\nAlso, her marriage\n\n> was granted\n\n> during the Earl's lifetime.

If Amice was\n\nborn to an earlier marriage, then she would have been excluded from\n\nbeing a co-heir with her younger half-sisters. In this period, full\n\nsisters of Earl Ranulph inherited ahead of any half-sisters.\n\nConsequently, the issue of the Chester inheritance CAN'T be used to\n\nprove Amice's legitimacy or illegitimacy. The inheritance issue can\n\nonly be used to prove that Amice was not Earl Ranulph's full sister.\n\nThat's all.\n\nGiven this possibility it is even\n\n> less likely the Earl would have married a legitimate daughter to\n\n> Ralph and\n\n> given them only three knights' fees in frank marriage!\n\nSince you are adamant about this point, please tell us the maritagiums\n\nof the other daughters of Earl Hugh. If not that, then how about\n\nmaritagiums for other Earls' daughters who married in this same period.\n\nI'm aware of one such maritagium myself. The Earl of Warwick married\n\nhis daughter, Agnes, off to Geoffrey de Clinton the younger. As I\n\nrecall, he gave Agnes 15 knights' fees in marriage, of which ten were\n\nalready held by Geoffrey of the Earl. This would be tantamount to a\n\ngift of five knights' fees, not far off Amice's maritagium of three\n\nknights' fees.\n\nOne other point that comes to mind, we know the property Amice had in\n\nEngland from her father as a maritagium. Earl Hugh also had extensive\n\nland holdings in France. As such, it is entirely possible that Amice\n\nwas given additional property in France as a maritagium. If true, it\n\nis impossible for us to know the exact extent of Amice's maritagium.\n\nFor all these reasons, I believe it is necessary to take a neutral\n\nposition regarding Amice's legitimacy.\n\nDR\n\n* Sent from RemarQ http://www.remarq.com The Internet's Discussion Network *\n\nThe fastest and easiest way to search and participate in Usenet - Free!\n\n[Doug wrote:]\n\n>You've given us all the reasons why Amice must be illegitimate but none\n\n>why she might be legitimate.

The ONLY argument which would make\n\nAmicia legitimate is the assumption that she was a daughter of Earl Hugh by a\n\nwife he married before Bertrade. This is THEORETICALLY possible, but based on\n\nwhat I presented, it seems wholly unbelievable.\n\nWHAT EVIDENCE do you have ASIDE from this theoretical position that she was\n\nlegitimate? Any other good reason or fact would be nice. Do you have one,\n\nDoug? ONE?\n\n[Doug wrote:]\n\n>\n\n>In the Beaumont book you cited below, I recall reading a record which\n\n>indicated that Earl Hugh was active as an adult in the 1150's.\n\nThe tracts concerning Amice [whom they call Amicia] do indeed ASSUME that Hugh\n\nwas an adult and born earlier. BUT there is no documentary evidence of it, and\n\nBOTH sides were then [amazingly] ignorant of the Chronicle of St. Werburg.\n\nPLUS the original arguments were being presented so that the Mainwarings could\n\nquarter the Chester arms and avoid any taint of bastardy or honour, which bears\n\non motivation.\n\n[Doug wrote:]\n\n>In any case, given marriages arranged in childhood which\n\n>were consumated in teenaged years, a 22 year old man could have already\n\n>had severa; children by a first wife.\n\nYes, it is POSSIBLE, but what EVIDENCE of this do you have? By this same\n\nargument you had John de Braose marrying Margaret as a child, rather than a\n\ntwenty-two year old adult. IF Earl Hugh had married before his union with\n\nBertrade, he would have had to do it with the permission of his guardian, which\n\nmeant it would be an advantageous match to a bride of very respectable social\n\nstatus, not an obscure woman.\n\n[Doug wrote:]\n\n>Actually Paul I don't agree on most of these point. We don't have a\n\n>copy of all the original charters of this time period.\n\nWe have extensive numbers of charters for the Earls of Chester, there is a\n\nwhole book of them , and Bertrade appears as a witness in a whole slew of them\n\n[Geoffrey Barraclough, ed., _The Charters of the Anglo-Norman Earls of Chester,\n\nc. 1071-1237_ (Record Society of Lancashire and Cheshire, v. 126) (1988)]. The\n\ncharter concerning Amicia [NB this authoritative book also refers to her as\n\nAmicia, not Amice] is no. 193 (pp. 198-9). I quote from the commentary:\n\n\"Today, probably, no one questions that Amicia was an illegitimate daughter of\n\nHugh II. As Hugh was born in 1147, it is not difficult to calculate that the\n\ndate of the present charter must be c. 1180, or conceivably a year or two\n\nearlier.\"\n\nNow Doug, how is it that all these scholars who have formidable knowledge of\n\noriginal source records for Cheshire keep missing what only you discover?\n\n[Doug wrote:]\n\n>partial.\n\n>For example, until I found the Papal letter which mentioned Llewelyn's\n\n>wife, no one knew that Earl Hugh had another daughter. Since our\n\n>knowledge is partial, we have to carefully sort through the evidence\n\n>which has survived.\n\nI was under the impression that Lloyd was aware of the whole situation many\n\ndecades ago. Were you ignorant of Lloyd? But I agree with your statement that\n\n\"we have to carefully sort through the EVIDENCE which has survived.\"\n\nI have presented sources, evidence, and analysis, and it was carefully reasoned\n\nout. I have, in fact, documentary evidence to support my conclusion. Again,\n\naside from the theoretical possibility presented before, what EVIDENCE or\n\nrationale do you have to convince us that Amicia should NOT be illegitimate?\n\n[If you are going to blow about opinions without specifics, we might as well\n\nargue about how many angels fit on the head of a pin.]\n\n>\n\n>I guess you weren't reading what I posted this past week. If Amice was\n\n>born to an earlier marriage, then she would have been excluded from\n\n>being a co-heir with her younger half-sisters.\n\nNo, I did read your posts. You did not clearly read what I wrote. I stated\n\nthat IF Amicia were daughter by a first marriage, and that IF Hugh's only son\n\ndied before he did, THEN Amicia (by your theory) would be the eldest daughter\n\nand EQUAL coheir with her half-sisters. It would be Hugh that was the\n\nPROPOSITUS. His son would only become the propositus if he survived Hugh.\n\nThe reason I stated that this argument should hold such weight in consideration\n\nis that it would have (in the case that Hugh had no son who outlived him)\n\nAmicia becoming heir of the senior purparty, and thus heiress of the Earldom of\n\nChester, making the Mainwaring family [who did not ever attain peerage in the\n\ndirect line] Earls of Chester!\n\npcr"
