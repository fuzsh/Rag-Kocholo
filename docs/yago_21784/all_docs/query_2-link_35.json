        "text": "What God wishes, I wish.\n\nWhy de Montfort`s, someone might ask? Well, I have for a long time been interested about Earl Simon de Montfort the younger. He is the man who fought against King Henry II of England to protect the rights of the lower nobility and people against the crown. Thanks to Simon de Montfort England has a parliament. He seems like a truly noble person in an era of betrayal and Machiavellian politics. This page tells about him and his family, showing the important connections he had to other noble families. De Montfort`s we related to just about everyone and had important connections all the way from Scotland to Jerusalem. It is like reading who`s who in Medieval Europe! He was related to Kings of Jerusalem, Orsini`s of Rome, kings of France, kings of England, kings of Scotland and to rulers of Wales, just to name a few. De Montfort`s eagerly took the cross and joined crusades to the Holy Land. They were devoted sons of the church and did not hesitate to die with their cause! Even their motto was, Quod Deus Vole Volo, or What God wishes, I wish.\n\nAMAURY of MONTFORT (c.935  1031)\n\nHe was the founder of the family. Amaury was said to be an illegitime son of King Robert II the pious, son of Hugo Capet. This was perhaps just a claim without any justification, especially since Robert II was born in 972 and died 1031. Obviously he at least was not Amaury`s father. In those times there were a lot of illegitime children, but also lot`s of claims to be descendant of some important person. Amaury`s had a son, Guillaume.\n\nGUILLAUME de MONTFORT (960  1003)\n\nHe had a son, Amaury.\n\nAMAURY de MONTFORT (1000  after 1031)\n\nAmaury was married to Bertrada de Gornetz. They had two children, Eve de Montfort (born 1023) and Simon I de Montfort.\n\nSIMON I de MONTFORT (1025  1087)\n\nSimon married Isabel de Broyes. They had two children, Amaury de Montfort and Isabel de Montfort. Isabel was born in 1058. He married Ralph de Toeni of Flamsted (1029  1101).\n\nAMAURY de MONTFORT (1056  1089)\n\nFrom this man begins the rise of de Montfort`s. He married Agnes d`Evreux, who was daughter of Richard, Count of Evreux. Their childrens were Bertrade de Montfort, Richard de Montfort, Simon de Montfort and Amaury de Montfort.\n\nBertrade de Montfort (1059  1117)\n\nShe did well in her marriages. First Bertrade married Fulk IV, Count of Anjou (1043  1109). Fulk IV had been married before, to Hildegard de Baugency, who died in 1070. Fulk IV and Hildegard had one daughter, Ermengarde of Anjou (1068  1146), who married William IX, Duke of Aquitaine, and then Alain IV Fergent, Duke of Brittany. After Hildegard died Fulk IV married Ermengarde de Bourbon. They had a son, Geoffrey IV Martel (1073  1106). In 1089 Fulk IV then married Bertrade de Montfort, only to divorce her three years later. Their son was Fulk V the younger. After her divorce with Fulk IV, Bertrade de Montfort married Philippe I, King of France (born 1053 and died 1108). They had several children. Eldest was Philippe, count de Nantes (1093  1123). Daughter Cecile de France married Tancred de Hauteville of Antioch, and then Pons de Toulouse, Count of Tripoli (1098  1137).\n\nFulk V the younger (1092  1143 or 44)\n\nHe was son of Fulk IV of Anjou and Bertrade de Montfort. Fulk V had some considerable advantages in his life. His mother was wife of the King of France. His father was Count of Anjou and he had an influential elder brother, Geoffrey IV Martel (surely they didn`t call him Martel for nothing?). He was also related to rulers of Aquitaine and Brittany. In his own time he became Fulk V, Count of Anjou. The crusading ideology took him over, and in Holy Land Fulk V became King of Jerusalem. Fulk V was married to Erernburge, Countess de Maine (1096  1126), daughter of Count of Maine. Their children were Geoffrey V Plantagenet, Count of Anjou and Duke of Normandy (1113  1151), who married Matilda, Queen of England and daughter of Henry I, King of England. Second son of Fulk V was Helie, Count of Maine. After his first wife died Fulk married again, to Melisende de Rethel, Queen of Jerusalem (1101  1161). Through this marriage Fulk V became King of Jerusalem. He and Melisende had two sons, Baldwin III, King of Jerusalem (1131  1163) and Amaury I, King of Jerusalem (1136  1174). Amaury`s daughter Sibylle married Guy de Lusignan, who became King of Jerusalem. But this takes us already too far away from de Montfort`s. It is just interesting to know, that when de Montfort`s went to crusades they already had this link to the Holy Land through Bertrade de MOntfort`s son, Fulk V. King`s of Jerusalem were their relatives!\n\nAMAURY de MONTFORT (1070  1137)\n\nThis Amaury was fortunate to have influential family, through his sister Bertrade. Amaury became Count of Evreux after his mother`s father died. He married Agnes de Garlende (1095  1181). Amaury had one son, Simon de Montfort le chauve.\n\nSIMON de MONTFORT le chauve (1117  1181)\n\nHe was Count of Evreux. Simon`s wife was Maud. Their children were Amaury de Montfort, Bertrade de Montfort and Simon de Montfort.\n\nAmaury de Montfort (1151  1182)\n\nEldest son of le chauve. He was Count of Evreux. In 1170 Amaury married Maud of Gloucester (died 1188), daughter of William FitzRobert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester. Their son was Amoury de Montfort, Earl of Gloucester. This was apparently the first English connection for the family.\n\nBertrade de Montfort. (1152  1189)\n\nShe married in 1169 Hugh Keveliok de Meschines, 3rd Earl of Chester (died 1181), further connecting the family to England. They had following children: Ranulph de Blundeville de Meschines, 4th Earl of Chester, Duke of Brittany and Earl of Richmond. Maud de Meschines, who married David Etherington, Earl of Huntingdon. Mabel de Meschines, who married William de Albini, Earl of Arundel and Sussex. Agnes de Meschines (died 1246) who married in 1192 William de Ferrers, 4th Earl of Derby (died 1246). Hawise de Meschines, who married Robert de Quincy.\n\nRanulph de Meschines (1172  1232)\n\nSon of Bertrade de Montfort. He married Constance, Dutchess of Brittany, daughter of Conon IV, Duke of Brittany, and then Clementia, daughter of William de Fougeres.\n\nDavid Etherington (1144  1219)\n\nEtherington gave de Montfort family a connection to Scotland. His father was Henry, Earl of Huntingdon, and his brothers were Malcolm IV, King of Scots, and William the lion, King of Scots (1143  1214). William the lion was married to Ermengarde de Beaumont. Etherington married Maud de Meschines (1171  1232), daughter of Bertrade de Montfort. Their son was John le Scot, Earl of Chester and Huntingdon. Daughter, Margaret of Huntingdon, married in 1209 Alan, Lord of Galloway (died 1234). Another daughter, Isobel of Huntingdon, married Sir Robert de Bruce, 4th Lord of Annadale (died 1245). Their descendant was Robert de Bruce, King of Scotland. Third daughter, Ada le Scot of Huntington, married Sir Henry de Hastings (1193  1250). Their son was Sir Henry de Hastings, who was born in 1225 and died March 5th 1269 in England.\n\nWilliam de Albini\n\nHe married Mabel de Meschines, daughter of Bertrade de Montfort. Their children were William de Albini, Earl of Sussex and 4th Earl of Arundel, Hugh de Albini, 5th Earl of Arundel, Mabel, who married Robert de Tatteshall (died 1249), Isabel de Albini, who marries John FitzAlan, Lord of Oswestry and Sheriff of Shropshire, and Nicola de Albini, who married Roger de Somerie, lord of Dudley (died 1273). Isabel de Albini and John FitzAlan had one son, John FitzAlan, who died November 10th 1267.\n\nWilliam de Ferrers\n\nHe married Agnes de Meschines, daughter of Bertrade de Montfort. Their son was William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby. William married Sybil Marshal, daughter of William Mareschal, 1st Earl of Pembroke. William also married Margaret de Quincy, daughter of Robert de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester. William de Ferrers died March 24th 1254 at Evington, Leicestershire, and had a son, Robert de Ferrers, 8th Earl of Derby (1239  1279). During the conflict between Henry III and Simon de Montfort, Robert de Ferrers rebelled against the king, a year after Earl Simon had been defeated. Robert was also defeated and lost his earldom. Robert de Ferrers was married to Alianore de Bohun (died 1313), daughter of Sir Humphrey de Bohun of Hereford, who was an important figure during the time of Simon de Montfort. Agnes de Meschines and William de Ferrers also had a daughter, Sybil de Ferrers (born 1216). She was married to John de Vipont (Vieuxpont), Sheriff of Westmoreland. Their son was Robert de Vipount, who was born 1222 and died 1264 or 1265.\n\nRobert de Quincy (1186  1257)\n\nHe married Hawise de Meschines, daughter of Bertrade de Montfort. Their children were Margaret de Quincy (1208  1265/66), Hawise de Quincy, Roger de Quincy (1210  April 25th 1264) and Mabel de Quincy.\n\nSIMON de MONTFORT (1153  1188)\n\nWith this Simon we are getting close to the times of the elder and younger Simon de Montfort, Earls of Leicester. This Simon was Count of Rochefort. His sister had married an important English nobleman, and Simon too strengthened this connection to England. He married Amicia de Beaumont (died 3.9.1215), daughter of Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester. This Robert de Beaumont was an important figure during the Civil War in England, being for a while the viceroy of England. He died in 1168. Amice also had two brothers, Robert de Beaumont, 4th Earl of Leicester and Steward of England (died 1204) and Roger de Breteuil, Chancellor of Scotland and Bishop of St.Andrews. After Simon de Montfort died Amicia de Beaumont married Guillaume III des Barres (died 1234). Simon and Amicia had two sons, Simon de Montfort the crusader and Guy de Montfort.\n\nGUY de MONTFORT (died 31.1.1228)\n\nHe was the younger son of Simon de Montfort and Amicia de Beaumont. Guy married Helvis Ibelin, of the famous crusader family. It is hard to say what caused the sudden crusading spirit of de Montfort brothers, Simon and Guy, but it is worth remembering that they were related to kings of Jerusalem. From here on crusades were an important part of the lives of de Montfort`s. Guy took part at least to the Albigens crusade in southern France against Kathars, but his marriage to Helvis Ibelin tells us that he must have had a lot to do with the Holy Land as well. At least Guy participated to 4th Crusade with his brother Simon. They both left the crusaders at Zara, after the main force decided to go to conquer Constantinople. Guy died in 1228 in Vareilles. Guy and Helvis had one son, Philippe I de Montfort.\n\nHelvis Ibelin\n\nShe married Guy de Montfort. Her brother was Philippe d`Ibelin, Regent of Cyprus, who died 1227. This Philippe was married first to Maria, daughter of Cahran of Korokos, Marshal of Armenia, and then to Alix von Mömpelgard. Philippe`s eldest son was Jean d`Ibelin, Comte of Jaffa and Askalon, Lord of Rama and Bailiff of Jerusalem. He died at Nicosia in 1266. Other sons were Jaqcues, Lord of Jaffa (died 1276), Philippe (died 1263) and Guy, Comte of Jaffa (died 1304).\n\nHelvis Ibelin had also another brother, Jean d`Ibelin the old, Lord of Beirut and Arsur, Constable and Bailiff of Jerusalem and Bailiff of Cyprus. Jean d`Ibelin had four sons, Balian III, Lord of Beirut, Constable of Cyprus and Bailiff of Jerusalem, Jean, Lord of Arsur, Constable and Bailiff of Cyprus and Jerusalem, Baudoin, Seneschal of Cyprus (died 1266) and Guy, Marshal and Constable of Cyprus. This means two d`Ibelin uncles and eight cousins to help and look after Philippe I de Montfort at the Holy Land. Without a doubt also Simon the crusader and his sons Amaury and Simon got their share of this support. It seems that d´Ibelins in 13th century, after Jerusalem was lost, were at Cyprus.\n\nPHILIPPE I de MONTFORT (1204  1265)\n\nHe was son of Guy de Montfort and Helvis Ibelin. He linked his fortunes closely to those of d`Ibelin family in the Holy Land. Philippe married Eleanore de Courtenay. He was Lord of Tyrus and Toron, Lord of Castries and Pretender to the throne of Armenia. Philippe I was murdered in Tyrus in 17.3.1270. Philippe I and Eleanore had three sons, Philippe II de Montfort L`Amaury, Jean and Honfroy.\n\nPHILIPPE II de MONTFORT (1225  1270)\n\nHe continued his father`s and grandfather`s crusading tradition and made his fortune at the Holy Land. Philippe II married Jeanne de Levis. They had a daughter Jeanne de Montfort (died 1300). Jeanne de Montfort was married to Giugues VI de Forez, and then to Louis I of Savoy. Philippe also had a son, Jean II, Comte di Squillace (died 1300), and daughters Laure, who married Bernard VII de Comminges, and Eleanore (died 1338) who married Jean V, Comte de Vendome. Philippe II died in 1270 at Tunis, during the French crusade to conquer that land. Half of the French army died to diseases, so this probably was also the fate of Philippe.\n\nJean I (died 27.11.1289)\n\nHe was the brother of Philippe II de Montfort. Jean was Comte di Squillace, Lord of Toron and Tyrus. He was married to Marquerite de Lusignan, Lady of Tyrus (died 30.1.1308). Jean apparently died when Tyrus fell to the Sarasens, taking the crusading dreams of de Montfort`s to grave with him. It was fitting for de Montfort`s, both sons and their father dying during a crusade or while protecting the Holy Land.\n\nMarquerite de Lusignan (died 1308)\n\nShe married Jean I, son of Philippe I de Montfort. De Lusignans were the most influential family in the Holy Land. With d´Ibelins and de Montfort`s they formed a powerful trio. Marquerite`s father was Henri de Poitiers, who was married to Isabelle de Lusignan and assumed the surname de Lusignan. Henri de Poitiers drowned at sea in 1276. His son, and brother of Marquerite, was Hughues III le grand de Lusignan, Regent of Cyprus (1261), Regent of Jerusalem (1264), King of Cyprus (1267  1284), and in 24.12.1267 King of Jerusalem. Hughues le grand died at Tyros in 24.3.1284. He was married to Isabelle d`Ibelin. Their sons were King Jean I of Jerusalem and Cyprus, Bohemund de Lusignan (died at Tyrus, 3.11.1281), King Henri II of Cyprus and Jerusalem (died 1324) and Amaury II, Constable of Jerusalem and Regent of Cyprus (1306  1310), who was murdered at Nicosia in 5.6.1310.\n\nHONFROY de MONTFORT (died 1284)\n\nHe was the youngest son of Philippe II de Montfort. Honfroy was Lord of Tyrus. He married Echive d`Ibelin, Lady of Lapithos (died 1312). Their children were Amaury (died 28.12.1304), Rupen, Alix and Helvis.\n\nRUPEN de MONTFORT\n\nLord of Toron and Sur. He married Maria d`Ibelin in 1299, further strengthening the links between these two families. Their children were Honfroy (born 1305) and Jeannette. Jeannette married Balian d`Ibelin. Honfroy was Constable of Cyprus and died 1326. His daughter Echive married Peter I de Lusignan, king of Cyprus (1328  1369).\n\nPeter de Lusignan\n\nHe was King of Cyprus (1359  1369), titular king of Jerusalem, King of Armenia (1368  1369), titular Comte de Tripoli, and founder of the chivalric order of the Sword in 1347. Peter was born at Nicosia in 9.10.1328. He was murdered in his bed at Nicosia, 17.1.1369. His wife was Echive de Montfort. Their son was Peter II, King of Cyprus (1369  1382) and titular King of Jerusalem. Peter II died at 13.10.1382. Peter de Lusignan also had a brother, Jean de Lusignan, titular Prince of Antiochia, and Regent of Cyprus, 1329  1330. Jean de Lusignan was murdered in 1375. He was married to Constanze of Aragon and in 1350 to Alice d`Ibelin.\n\nSIMON de MONTFORT the crusader (died 1218)\n\nHe was elder brother of Guy de Montfort who married Helvis Ibelin and whose family then moved to the Holy Land to link their destiny with d´Ibelins and de Lusignans. Simon the crusader was married to Alice de Montmorency, of the highest French nobility. She was daughter of Bouchard de Montmorency. Simon and Alice had several children. Eldest was Amaury de Montfort. Others were Guy de Montfort, Simon de Montfort younger, Robert de Montfort, Pernel de Montfort and Amice de Montfort. Simon the crusader was the leader of the crusaders against Albigensians from 1208 to 1218. He died at that year while besieging Toulouse.\n\nFourth Crusade:\n\nSimon had participated to a crusade into Holy Land. This was the fourth crusade, which was called by Innocent III in 1198. A year later Thibaut III de Champagne announced he would lead a crusade into Egypt. Thibaut however died in 1201 and the leadership of the crusade went to Boniface, Marquis of Montferrat. With him went Count Louis of Blois. Simon de Montfort went too, accompanied by his brother-in-law Matthieu de Montmorency. About him the coeval chronicler, Villehardoun, said: With these two counts there took the cross two very high and puissant barons of France, Simon of Montfort*, and Renaud of Montmirail. Great was the fame thereof throughout the land when these two high and puissant men took the cross.\n\nThe crusade did not go as planned. The Venetians diverted the crusaders into Zara and from there into Constantinople. Zara was a town owned by Hungarians, and Venetians wanted it conquered as a payment for transporting the crusaders. Both Matthieu de Montmorency and Stephen of Perche had remained at Venice, sick. They soon recovered and Matthieu joined the crusaders at Zara. Stephen of Perche however abandoned his comrades and went to Apulia. After a short siege Zara surrendered. This all happened against Popes will. The army then went to Constantinople, which was captured and Byzantium replaced by new Latin empire. Baldwin IX, count of Flanders, was crowned the emperor in 1204. Some of the knights however had not agreed with the main force. After capture of Zara several refused to go to Constantinople and went instead by themselves to the Holy Land. Simon de Montfort was one of them, so he never plundered Constantinople or destroyed Byzantium. With Simon went his brother Guy de Montfort, Simon of Nauphle, Robert Mauvoisin, Dreux of Cressonsacq and many others. A few days later also Enguerrand of Boves joined Earl Simon. Matthieu de Montmorency however went with the main host.\n\nAlice de Montmorency (died 1221)\n\nShe married Simon the crusader in 1190. Her father was Bouchard IV, Baron de Montmorency, who died in 1189 and was married to Laurence of Flanders. This Laurence was daughter of Baldwin IV de bouwer of Hainault (1120  1171) and Alice de Namur, heiress of Namur. Bouchard IV himself was son of Matthieu, Baron de Montmorency and Connetable of France (died 1160). Alice de Montmorency had a brother, Matthieu II, Baron de Montmorency and Constable of France, who died 21.11.1230. This Matthieu II was called le grand. He was Constable of France from 1218 onwards. Matthieu fought well at Bouvines in 1214, when the French defeated King John of England. Tradition said that Matthieu de Montmorency seized 12 standards during the battle. Anonymous of Bethune wrote the following about de Montmorency in the battle: Mathew of Montmorency held a billhook in his hands and was astride a great horse. All those who saw him charge through the melee and saw how he went about, hitting and throwing knights to the ground and wounding many people, deny ever having seen a better knight. Before Bouvines, Matthieu took part to the Fourth Crusade with his brother-in-law Simon de Montfort. He was among those who conquered Constantinople.\n\nAlbigensian Crusade:\n\nThe aim of the crusade was to crush the Cathars, a Christian sect who were numerous in southern France, especially in Languedoc. They were also called Albigensians, because one of their main centres was the town of Albi. Pope Innocent III called for a crusade against the Albigensians. He asked for Philippe II of France to act against the sect. The king however did nothing and the local nobles of southern France refused to act. Count Raymond of Toulouse was even excommunicated by the Pope. Count Raymond then met with papal representative, Pierre de Castelnau, in January 1208. A heated meeting soon ended and the next day de Castelnau was killed. Pope then answered by declaring a crusade against Languedoc.\n\nA force of about 10 000 crusaders gathered in Lyon and soon invaded Languedoc. They were commanded by Simon de Montfort the crusader, but it is said he only reluctantly led a crusade against fellow Christians. Simon was already a famous knight, but the thanks for his command probably went to Philippe II of France, who was Simon`s relative through his grandfather`s sister, Bertrade de Montfort. Raymond of Toulouse at first joined Simon de Montfort and the excommunication was lifted. The main protector of the Albigensians was then Raymond-Roger de Trencavel.\n\nIn July 21st 1209 crusaders surrounded town of Bezieres. The town fell after a one day siege. There was confusion about what to do to the defenders, many of whom were not Albigensians. To this the papal representative, Abbot Amaud-Amaury said, Slay them all! God will know his own. A massacre followed, with over 10 000 people killed. Only 500 of them were Albigensians. This massacre and the fierce nature of the warfare soon gave Simon the crusader a dark reputation. He was however effective. In August 1209 town of Carcassonne surrendered to him. This was the main stronghold of Raymond-Roger, who was captured. His lands were taken by Simon the crusader.\n\nAfter Carcassonne towns of Albi, Castelnaudry, Fanjeaux, Limoux, Lombers and Montreal surrendered in quick succession. In December 1209 crusaders attacked castle of Cabaret, but Pierre-Roger de Cabaret repulsed them. This was only a temporary setback. De Montfort`s military machine continued to roll over Languedoc. On March 1210 Bram was captured and in July heavily fortified town of Minerve surrendered after a month long siege. Here 140 Albigensians were burned after they refused to convert.\n\nSimon the crusader met his first real setback in 1211 when Raymond of Toulouse turned against the crusaders. However de Montfort`s successes continued. In March 1211 town of Lastours surrendered and Pierre-Roger de Cabaret was captured. The main problem for the crusaders now was that areas already conquered often rebelled. In 1211 Aimery de Montreal rose against de Montfort. In May he was crushed. De Montreal and his senior knights were hung and several hundred Albigensians burned. It was now a good moment to defeat Raymond of Toulouse. The crusaders marched to his lands.\n\nIn June 1211 Toulouse was besieged, but it held. In the end de Montfort was forced to retreat. Raymond then followed de Montfort to Castelnaudary and in turn besieged it. Finally de Montfort broke through the siege lines but the town fell. The fighting now became more even. In 1213 king Peter II of Aragon came to help Raymond. Together they besieged town of Muret, but in September 1213 de Montfort made a successful sortie. King Peter II was killed during it and his army fled. The tide now turned and Simon the crusader took town after another. Count Raymond finally had to flee to England and in 1215 Toulouse surrendered to Simon de Montfort.\n\nIt all seemed finally to be over, but in April 1216 Raymond of Toulouse returned. He raised an army and fighting began anew. There was even an uprising in Toulouse, but it was crushed. In December 1216 de Montfort was repulsed at Lourdes. This gave Raymond the chance and in 1217 he retook Toulouse. De Montfort then led his whole force against the city. A long siege followed, but in June 1218 Simon de Montfort the crusader was killed by a missile from the city wall. The command of the crusade then fell to Simon`s eldest son Amaury de Montfort. He failed to retake Toulouse and in 1220 lost a lot of ground. Castelnaudary was lost and Amaury`s brother Guy died there. Amaury tried to take the town back, but after an 8 month long siege he had to retreat. In 1221 Raymond`s successes continued. The next year he died but was succeeded by his son Raymond, who continued the struggle. Amaury de Montfort continued to loose ground and in 1224 he had to abandon his lands in Carcassonne and flee. Amaury offered his claims to King Louis VIII of France, who accepted. In 1226 King invaded the area and in 1229 Count Raymond surrendered. The crusade was finally over.\n\nIt is hard to say why Simon de Montfort agreed to take command of the crusade. He was receiving only half-hearted support from King of France, and apparently did not believe in the cause itself. Most important reason was probably the lands of the rebellious nobles. These were promised to the crusaders and during his successes Simon managed to acquire large lands. We can also assume that it was hard for him not to do what Pope wished him to do, so he agreed to go. In the end to future of de Montfort family was not in the southern France. Simon died too early and his son Amaury de Montfort lost all the lands acquired by his father. Amaury`s younger brother Guy de Montfort even lost his life there in the southern lands.\n\nAMAURY VII de MONTFORT\n\nHe was the eldest son of Simon the crusader and Alice de Montmorency. Amaury joined his father in the Albigensian crusade. After his father died he inherited the leadership of the crusade, and all his father`s lands in the southern France. He became Duke of Narbonne, Comte de Toulouse, vicecomte de Carcassonne and de Beziers. How ever when the tide of war turned against him he lost all this land, but remained Comte de Montfort. Amaury then became Constable of France in 1231, as his uncle Matthieu de Montmorency had been. He inherited his father`s crusading spirit and went on a crusade to the Holy Land in 1230s. Amaury de Montfort died at Otranto while returning from this crusade in 1241. He was buried to St.Peters Cathedral in Rome. Amaury was married to Beatrix de Viennois. Their children were Jean I, Marguerite who married Jean III Come de Soissons, Laure (died 1270) who married 1256 Fernando of Castile, Comte d`Aumale, Adele who married Simon II de Clermont, and Peronnelle.\n\nJEAN I de MONTFORT (Died 1249)\n\nHe was the eldest child of Constable Amaury de Montfort and Beatrix de Viennois.
