Philip Augustus grants a fief to an Angevin, 1213 (click here)\n\nBackground: King Richard I had died on April 6, 1199, and the succession to the Angevin Empire was briefly contested between Richard's nephew, Arthur (son of Richard's brother Geoffrey), and Richard's brother, John. As we know, John ultimately prevailed, giving rise to dark rumors that John had had his nephew Arthur murdered. This unsettled moment proved a perfect opportunity for King Philip II Augustus of France, who for long had wished to dismember the vast set of holdings that made up the Angevin Empire. In 1199, therefore, Philip lent his support to Arthur. Among the more visible components of that support was Philip's willingness to publicly support Arthur's acts. In the charters I have translated here, the immediate context is the struggle for the barons of the key provinces of Anjou and Maine, which lay between two of the biggest and most important blocs of Angevin fiefs (ie., between Normandy and Aquitaine). William des Roches was a local lord who made his name and fortune by serving Henry II; Arthur, wishing William's support in Anjou, was therefore quick to confirm William as the seneschal of the royal estates in Maine, Anjou, and the Touraine (keep in mind that the Angevin kings were also counts of Anjou and counts of Maine; their holdings in these regions were substantial). In the first act below, Philip Augustus confirms this grant. Likewise, Arthur had attempted to win the support of another of the most powerful barons of Maine, Juhel of Mayenne. By offering Juhel the castles of Ambrieres, Gorron, Chatillon-sur-Colmont, and La Chartre, Arthur was making a symbolic gesture by restoring to Juhel's control castles that he and his ancestors had vainly claimed from the Angevin monarchy for over 60 years. Philip Augustus' motive in issuing these confirmations was undoubtedly to try to swing these key barons of Western France into his camp. And, as events proved over the next five years, his efforts were not in vain; both William des Roches and Juhel of Mayenne proved reluctant vassals of King John and eager to turn to the lordship of the king of France. The third document reflects Philip's victory over John; in 1204, William des Roches was still a trustworthy vassal, but the king made it clear that he was not to be an independent power in the West. The 1204 act clearly defined the scope of the seneschal's powers. Note in particular Philip's insistence that he retain full rights over all fortifications; this seems to suggest that in 1204 Philip may not have been sure that his victory over the Angevins was permanent.\n\n1. William des Roches, Philip Augustus and the Seneschalship of Anjou and Maine, May 1199\n\nTEXT:\n\nCharter concerning the Seneschalship of Anjou\n\nPhilip by the grace of God King of the French.

Philip Augustus Defines the Rights of William des Roches as Seneschal of Anjou, Maine, and the Touraine, August 1204\n\nTEXT:\n\nIn the name of the Holy and Indivisible Trinity, Amen. Philip, by the grace of God, King of the French. Let everyone, both present and future, know that these are the rights that William des Roches, seneschal of Anjou, shall have in the seneschalcy of Anjou, the Touraine, and Maine. He shall take nothing from our seigneurial revenues of Anjou, the Touraine, and Maine; but the same seneschal shall have from the provosts and the provostships one mark of silver of Tours for every 50 pounds that the provosts pay for their provostships. If we sell our woods, he shall have nothing from the sale of our woods. Besides this, he will have no custom in our forests. And if we should levy an aid [demandam] or a tax [tailliam] on the Christians or the Jews of the seneschalcy of Anjou, the Touraine and Maine, that aid shall be collected for our use by the hand of the aforesaid seneschal through legitimate accounts and records; but the seneschal shall have nothing from the aid or tax. And concerning everything else, both fines and revenues or service which are rendered to the seneschal, we will receive two parts and the seneschal the third part. Moreover it is understood that the aforesaid seneschal will not be able to lay claim to the guardianship of our castles and fortifications either through a fief or through custom; and if by chance we or someone from our party has handed over any castle or fortification to the guardianship of the same seneschal, the seneschal shall deliver to us and our heirs, or to a credible messenger bearing our letters patent to this effect, the castles and fortifications, undamaged, whenever we or our heir shall request it. The said seneschal swore to preserve all these things in good faith to us and our heirs in perpetuity. And we received the same seneschal into liege homage concerning these matters, just as was said, so that the same seneschal and his heirs by his affianced wife will hold all these [rights] from us and our heirs in liege homage, just as was said. So that it might obtain perpetual strength, we confirmed the present page with the authority of our seal and by the royal signature below.\n\nDone at Poitiers, in the the year of the Incarnation of the Lord 1204, in the twenty-fifth year of our reign, with those present in our palace whose names and signs are found below.\n\nNo dapifer.\n\nSign of Guy the Butler\n\nSign of Matthew the Chamberlain\n\nSign of Drogo the constable\n\nDone while the chancellorship was vacant.\n\nSOURCE: Recueil des actes de Philippe Auguste, vol. 2, pp. 407-409, act no. 829.

It ought to be held by them and by the heirs given to them by their wives in return for the service which that land owes according to the usage and customs of Anjou. Nevertheless, if they should manage to lose the said estate of Beaufort with its appurtenances, we shall be held to make no restitution to them outside the county of Anjou. So that this may obtain, etc. Done in the year of the lord 1206, [in the] 28th [year] of our reign. Given with the chancellorship vacant by the hand of brother Warin.\n\nSource: Recueil des actes de Philippe Auguste, v. 3, p. 3, no. 960. Translated from the Latin by Richard Barton.\n\n5.

And we retain Tours and the entire Touraine with its seneschalcy, and Chinon with its provostship and seneschalcy, and Bourgeuil and Loudun with their provostship, seneschalcy and appurtenances, and Saumur with its provostship.
