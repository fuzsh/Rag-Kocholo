        "text": "If I may pop back in time a generation or two, I'd like to highlight one of the more interesting ladies in the Plantagenet saga. All too often, the women get ignored by history, but Bertrade de Montfort does not seem to have been a lady who anyone ever ignored.\n\nCount Fulk Rechin of Anjou was already divorced once, and was then married to the mother of his son when he met Bertrade around 1089. She was the daughter of Simon I de Montfort and Agnes, Countess of Evreux*. He divorced his wife, married Bertrade, and their son Fulk was soon born. But there was trouble in domestic paradise. In 1092, Bertrade ran off with King Philippe I of France and bigamously married him, sparking the biggest sex scandal of the Eleventh Century.\n\nThe Capetian kings had some surprisingly salacious sex lives. Robert II, known as \"The Pious\", had dumped his (much older) first wife, married a woman related to him in the forbidden degrees, divorced her to marry a bitch from Provence, then tried to divorced the third wife and remarry the second wife**. The rather uninspiring Henri I had a fiancee and a wife die on him before marrying an exotic Russian princess, by far the most notable thing he ever did. Philippe himself had an arranged marriage to the plump and not-very-fertile Bertha of Holland. He dumped her and eloped with Bertrade. Everything would've been hunky-dory were it not for a fellow called Yves, Bishop of Chartres, who due to some boring political stuff, refused to attend the wedding*** and then wrote a letter saying, \"You will not see me in Paris with your wife, of whom I know not if she may be your wife.\" In other words, he was saying the whole thing was a sham. Which it kinda was, considering both Bertrade's husband and Philippe's wife were very much breathing, but it was still rather rude to point it out. Yves then made a fuss to the Pope, who forbid the prelates to crown Bertrade queen and threatened to excommunicate Philippe. Yves caused even more trouble**** and there was some talk of having him arrested. Philippe's wife Bertha, who had been cast-off like a worn shoe, conveniently died, so the marriage to Bertrade didn't look quite as illegal anymore.\n\nFor the past three years, Bertrade's forgotten husband, Fulk Rechin, was busy consoling himself with other women. But when the Pope said \"Jump\", Fulk meekly replied, \"How high?\" Right on cue he started griping about his adulterous wife and accusing Philippe of incest (since he was related to Philippe, that created a \"spiritual affinity\" between Bertrade and Philippe. The medievals were very concerned about such things.*****) Finally, Philippe relented and publically split from Bertrade. This turned out to be a feint, however, as they were soon back together******. This sort of thing happened over and over again, with Philippe and Bertrade making properly penitent appearances, barefoot and pitiful, swearing oaths never to touch one another again, only to be back together in two shakes of a lambs tail soon after. Eventually, everyone just gave up, and they went right on together until 1108, when Philippe kicked the bucket.\n\nOrderic Vitalis makes Bertrade into an evil stepmother, saying she was a sorceress and tried to kill her stepson Louis with dark magic, and when that failed, tried to get Henry I of England to lure the lad into her grasp. According to Orderic, she was lascivious and ambitious, a Bad Girl eager to trade up from a count to a king. According to John of Marmoutier, no man ever praised Bertrade \"save for her beauty\"; William of Malmesbury compared her to an angel. Whatever the truth, she retired to Fontevrault, always that center of Plantagenet life, and lived out her last days dazzling people with her beauty, arguing with her stepson Louis over her dower, and encouraging her sons to make trouble. Her daughter Cécile went off to Outremer as a child-bride and later met up with her half-brother Fulk V there when he became king of Jerusalem. Of course, Bertrade's grandsons were Geoffrey of Anjou (Henry II's papa) and King Baldwin III and King Amaury I of Jerusalem, so there's our Plantagenets right there. As it should be.\n\nCheck out Georges Duby's The Knight, the Lady and the Priest : The Making of Modern Marriage in Medieval France for more details.\n\n* Simon de Montfort who married Eleanor of Leicester was her great-great-grandnephew.\n\n** The whole thing reads like a medieval episode of Dynasty, lacking only Heather Locklear.\n\n*** Diss!!!\n\n**** Some business about not helping out Philippe when the troublemaking sons of William the Conqueror showed up, but whatever.\n\n***** Amusingly, Fulk Rechin and Philippe ended up becoming friends, and in 1106 Bertrade and Philippe enjoyed a friendly visit with him in Anjou.\n\n****** And having babies: Philippe, Fleury, and Cécile."
