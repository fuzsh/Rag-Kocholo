        "text": "Husband: Philip I +* (1052-1108) Wife: Bertrade + of MONTFORT (1070-1117) Children: Philip of FRANCE (c. 1094- ) Fluery of FRANCE (c. 1096- ) Cecile of FRANCE (c. 1098- ) Marriage 15 May 1092\n\nHusband: Philip I +*\n\nWife: Bertrade + of MONTFORT\n\nChild 1: Philip of FRANCE\n\nName: Philip of FRANCE Sex: Male Birth 1094 (est)\n\nChild 2: Fluery of FRANCE\n\nName: Fluery of FRANCE Sex: Male Birth 1096 (est)\n\nChild 3: Cecile of FRANCE\n\nName: Cecile of FRANCE Sex: Female Birth 1098 (est)\n\nNote on Husband: Philip I +*\n\nPhilip I (23 May 1052 â 29 July 1108), called the Amorous (French: l' Amoureux),[1] was King of France from 1060 to his death. His reign, like that of most of the early Direct Capetians, was extraordinarily long for the time. The monarchy began a modest recovery from the low it reached in the reign of his father and he added to the royal demesne the Vexin and Bourges.\n\nPhilip was the son of Henry I and Anne of Kiev. Unusually at the time for Western Europe, his name was of Greek origin, being bestowed upon him by his mother. Although he was crowned king at the age of seven,[2] until age fourteen (1066) his mother acted as regent, the first queen of France ever to do so. Her co-regent was Baldwin V of Flanders.\n\nPhilip first married Bertha, daughter of Floris I, Count of Holland, in 1072. Although the marriage produced the necessary heir, Philip fell in love with Bertrade de Montfort, the wife of Count Fulk IV of Anjou. He repudiated Bertha (claiming she was too fat) and married Bertrade on 15 May 1092. In 1094, he was excommunicated by Hugh, Archbishop of Lyon, for the first time; after a long silence, Pope Urban II repeated the excommunication at the Council of Clermont in November 1095. Several times the ban was lifted as Philip promised to part with Bertrade, but he always returned to her, and after 1104, the ban was not repeated. In France, the king was opposed by Bishop Ivo of Chartres, a famous jurist.\n\nPhilip appointed Alberic first Constable of France in 1060. A great part of his reign, like his father's, was spent putting down revolts by his power-hungry vassals. In 1077, he made peace with William the Conqueror, who gave up attempting the conquest of Brittany. In 1082, Philip I expanded his demesne with the annexation of the Vexin. Then in 1100, he took control of Bourges.\n\nIt was at the aforementioned Council of Clermont that the First Crusade was launched. Philip at first did not personally support it because of his conflict with Urban II. The pope would not have allowed him to participate anyway, as he had reaffirmed Philip's excommunication at the said council. Philip's brother Hugh of Vermandois, however, was a major participant.\n\nâ â¦Philip died in the castle of Melun and was buried per request at the monastery of Saint-BenoÃ®t-sur-Loire â and not in St Denis among his forefathers. He was succeeded by his son, Louis VI, whose succession was, however, not uncontested. According to Abbot Suger: â\n\nâ â¦ King Philip daily grew feebler. For after he had abducted the Countess of Anjou, he could achieve nothing worthy of the royal dignity; consumed by desire for the lady he had seized, he gave himself up entirely to the satisfaction of his passion. So he lost interest in the affairs of state and, relaxing too much, took no care for his body, well-made and handsome though it was. The only thing that maintained the strength of the state was the fear and love felt for his son and successor. When he was almost sixty, he ceased to be king, breathing his last breath at the castle of Melun-sur-Seine, in the presence of the [future king] Louis... They carried the body in a great procession to the noble monastery of St-BenoÃ®t-sur-Loire, where King Philip wished to be buried; there are those who say they heard from his own mouth that he deliberately chose not to be buried among his royal ancestors in the church of St. Denis because he had not treated that church as well as they had, and because among so many noble kings his own tomb would not have counted for much. â\n\n[edit] Issue\n\nPhilip, Bertha and their two eldest children Constance and LouisPhilip's children with Bertha were:\n\n1.Constance, married Hugh I of Champagne before 1097 and then, after her divorce, to Bohemund I of Antioch in 1106\n\n2.Louis VI (1 December 1081 â 1 August 1137), King of the Franks\n\n3.Henry (b. 1083) (died young)\n\n4.Odo (1087â1096)\n\nPhilip's children with Bertrade were:\n\n1.Philip, Count of Mantes (living 1123)\n\n2.Fleury, Seigneur of Nangis (1093 â July 1119)[3]\n\n3.Cecile of France, married Tancred, Prince of Galilee; married secondly Pons of Tripoli\n\nNote on Wife: Bertrade + of MONTFORT\n\nBertrade de Montfort (c. 1070 â 14 February 1117) was the daughter of Simon I de Montfort and Agnes, Countess of Evreux. Her brother was Amaury de Montfort.\n\nThe oft-married Fulk IV, Count of Anjou was married to the mother of his son in 1089, when the lovely Bertrade caught his eye. According to the chronicler John of Marmoutier:\n\nThe lecherous Fulk then fell passionately in love with the sister of Amaury de Montfort, whom no good man ever praised save for her beauty.\n\nBertrade and Fulk were married, and they became the parents of a son, Fulk, but in 1092 Bertrade left her husband and took up with King Philip I of France. Philip married her on 15 May 1092, despite the fact that they both had spouses living. He was so enamoured of Bertrade that he refused to leave her even when threatened with excommunication. Pope Urban II did excommunicate him in 1095, and Philip was prevented from taking part in the First Crusade. Astonishingly, Bertrade persuaded Philip and Fulk to be friends.\n\n[edit] Children\n\nWith Fulk IV, Count of Anjou:\n\nFulk of Jerusalem, Count of Anjou and King of Jerusalem (1089/92â1143)\n\nWith Philip I of France:\n\nPhilip of France, Count of Mantes (living in 1123)\n\nFleury of France, Seigneur of Nangis (living in 1118)\n\nCecile of France (died 1145), married (1) Tancred, Prince of Galilee; married (2) Pons of Tripoli\n\n[edit] Later life\n\nAccording to Orderic Vitalis, Bertrade was anxious that one of her sons succeed Philip, and sent a letter to King Henry I of England asking him to arrest her stepson Louis. Orderic also claims she sought to kill Louis first through the arts of sorcery, and then through poison. Whatever the truth of these allegations, Louis succeeded Philip in 1108. Bertrade lived on until 1117; William of Malmesbury says: \"Bertrade, still young and beautiful, took the veil at Fontevraud Abbey, always charming to men, pleasing to God, and like an angel.\" Her son from her first marriage was Fulk V of Anjou who later became King of Jerusalem iure uxoris. The dynasties founded by Fulk's sons ruled for centuries, one of them in England (Plantagenet), the other in Jerusalem."
