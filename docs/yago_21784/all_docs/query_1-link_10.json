Known for preferring his male favourites to his wives, more at home in Paris than at Versailles, he won a famous military victory over William of Orange in 1677.

        "text": "Philippe de France was initially known as “Petit Monsieur”, a title used under the Ancien Régime to refer to the younger brother of the king, and to avoid confusion with the brother of Louis XIII, Gaston, Duke of Orléans, known as “Grand Monsieur”. Upon the death of the latter in 1660 Philippe’s title was revised to simply “Monsieur” and he became, at the age of 20, the head of the Orléans dynasty.\n\nEleven years later, in 1671, after the death of his first wife Henrietta of England, Louis XIV forced his brother to marry Princess Elisabeth Charlotte, Madame Palatine. They had three children, including future regent Philippe II, Duke of Orleans and Mademoiselle de Chartres.\n\nA great fan of effeminate clothing and extravagant outfits, surrounded by male favourites and given to what was euphemistically termed the “Italian vice”, Philippe de France was kept at a safe distance from political matters by the king, who did not approve of his behaviour.\n\nHe nonetheless scored a brilliant victory over William of Orange at the Battle of Cassel on 11th April 1677, one of the defining engagements of the Franco-Dutch War."
