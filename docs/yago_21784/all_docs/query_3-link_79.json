        "text": "King of France, from 1285 to 1314, Philippe was ruling when the orders to crush the Knights Templars were given. Philippe's financial difficulties which may have led to the downfall of the Templars as Philippr owed them money, was caused by huge expenditure trying to expand his territory. Money was spent on rents, civil servants and military operations. To get some of the money back, Philippe first picked on the Jews and money lenders, whose assets he confiscated and paid to the crown. He then confiscated the assets of the Lombards, Italian bankers within France. The Templars, as the King's bankers were a good target, as by removing them, Philippe effectively removed his debt to them.\n\nPhilippe died in 1314, of a hunting accident, a strange coincidence, as at the burning of the Templar's leaders at the stake, Jacques de Molay was to say that Pope Clement V would die within forty days and King Philippe would not see in the end of the year. Pope Clement V died on 20 April 1314.\n\nPhilippe IV was succeeded by three of his sons, Louis X (1314-16), Philippe V (1316-22) and Charles IV (1322-28), but they all died young without sons of their own. They were succeeded by Philippe VI, the start of the Valois line which extended to the end of the sixteenth century."
