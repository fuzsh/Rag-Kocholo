        "text": "BE1883 (Montfort) reports that the first Almaric/Amaury/Aymer of Montfort was an illegitimate son of Robert, King of France. The only Kings Robert of France at or before this period were the Robert I (grandfather of Hugh Capet) who died in 923 and Robert II 'the Pious' (son of Hugh Capet) who lived 972-1031. The article in BE1883 says that this Almaric, son of King Robert, was great-grandfather of the Simon who married Amicia de Beaumont but gives no dates for any of the family until that Simon. As BE1883 appears to miss out some generations, we follow 'The Complete Peerage' (TCP). As the dates given in TCP are broadly consistent with other sources, and as the dates found in various web sites suggest that the first Amaury de Montfort was born about 935, we believe that the first Amaury here reported could not have been a son of a King Robert of France. It is possible that he was a grandson of King Robert I but that has not been proved."
