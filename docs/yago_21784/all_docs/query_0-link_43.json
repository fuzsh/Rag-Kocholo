        "text": "NOBLEWOMEN OF THE ELEVENTH CENTURY AND TWELFTH CENTURIES: MABEL OF BELLÊME, BERTRADE OF MONTFORT AND OTHERS\n\nThe Noble Family and Noble Women\n\nBetween the end of the tenth and the middle of the twelfth century, royal and noble families in France (and, after 1066, in England) began to practice primogeniture. That is , the eldest surviving son came increasingly to be the sole heir to his father's land. As a result, the inheritances of daughters (their dowries) and of younger sons became much more restricted than they had been in the earlier Middle Ages. Moreover, husbands gained more control over the dowries of their wives. French and English noble women thus had far less economic power in the eleventh and twelfth centuries than had the Frankish queens. Nevertheless, this was still a courtly society in which the domestic and public/political realms overlapped; for this reason, it was still possible in some places and circumstances for women of the aristocracy to exercise significant and lasting power.\n\nThe following selections depict the lives and opportunities of Norman women of the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, focusing particularly on two extraordinary women, Mabel of Bellême and Bertrade of Montfort. As the chronicles of the early Middle Ages are quite unforthcoming about the lifestyle of ordinary women (even ordinary women of the aristocracy), historians often have to use the colorful images of such larger-than-life women as Mabel and Bertrade in piecing together a picture of aristocratic women. Since they are larger-than-life and were being used to make didactic (especially moral) points, we need to sift carefully through the authors' biases to uncover a sense of what women could and could not do. The first set of stories on Mabel and Bertrade come from the Norman monk, Orderic Vitalis; the second brief segment on Bertrade comes from the pen of Suger, Abbot of Saint-Denis and chief advisor to the king of France. After the sections on Mabel and Bertrade, I include snippets illustrating other forms of power and informal social control that could be exercised by women.\n\nEven though the Norman monk Orderic Vitalis wrote his massive work at the abbey of Saint Évroul in Normandy between the years 1114 and 1141, his wide connections among the Norman nobility meant that he was well informed about events from the middle of the eleventh century and on. When considering his take on Mabel of Bellême, for instance, it is important to remember that the founders and benefactors of his own abbey, the family of Giroie, were mortal enemies of the family of Bellême. This fact may well help contextualize his account of her life and \"crimes.\" As for Bertrade of Montfort, she was the daughter of an important Norman family (Montfort), and she married successively the count of Anjou and the King of France. Her second marriage, however, was uncanonical, and illustrates well the changing attitudes of the church towards marriage. Orderic's account of both women is of interest because it reveals the strength of their will and personalities and presents a picture of what upper class women could and could not do in eleventh-century France.\n\n[sources taken from: The Ecclesiastical History of Orderic Vitalis, 6 vols., ed. and trans.

Mabel of Bellême (d. 1077)\n\na. from Orderic Vitalis, Ecclesiastical History, Volume 2, pp. 47, 49:\n\nIn the time of William, duke of Normandy, Ivo, the son of William of Bellême, held the bishopric of Séez, and on the deaths of his brothers Warin and Robert and William, [Ivo] inherited the town of Bellême from his father. He was a fine figure of a man, learned, shrewd, and eloquent, witty and never at a loss for a jest. As a father loves his children, so he loved his clerks and monks; and he counted Abbot Thierry [abbot of St. Évroul, where Orderic was writing] among his special friends. They often enjoyed each other's company, for Séez is only seven leagues away from St. Évroul. Roger of Montgomery, viscount of Exmes, had married the bishop's niece Mabel, and secured through her the lion's share of the possessions of William of Bellême. On the bishop's advice he gave the church of St. Martin at Séez to Abbot Thierry and both he and his wife urged him to establish a monastery there. The abbot readily undertook the appointed work in the name of the Lord, and established there Roger, a monk of St. Évroul in priest's orders, with Morinus and Engelbert and others from his own community. He himself often visited the place, and sometimes spent three or four weeks there, striving with all his might to bring the newly undertaken work to perfection for the love of God and the profit of future generations. This Mabel whom I mentioned was a forceful and worldly woman, cunning, garrulous and extremely cruel. But she had a great respect for the man of God, Thierry, and though she was merciless to other men of religion she sometimes listened to him. So she brought her first-born son Robert of Bellême, whose name is now a byword for his cruelty to the wretched peasantry, to Thierry and Roger and the other monks at Séez that he might be washed in the holy font of baptism.\n\nb. Orderic Vitalis, Volume 2, p. 55:\n\nNow I will tell a true story of Mabel, daughter of William Talvas [ie., William of Bellême], although it is a little premature here. From the earliest days of St. Évroul the monastic rule was strictly observed there, and alms were distributed to all comers as is still the custom now; but this woman so hated the founders of the monastery [the founders were the family of Giroie] that she devised nefarious ways of injuring the monks. For her father and she and all their descendants had a lasting feud with the sons of Giroie. Since her husband Roger of Montgomery loved and protected the monks she dared not do them any open harm, but frequently descended on the monastery with a great retinue of knights, demanding hospitality: in this way she brought the monks, who were struggling to wring a living form the barren soil, to the verge of ruin. Once when she was staying there with a hundred knights Abbot Thierry asked her why she must come with such worldly pomp to a poor monastery and warned her to restrain her vanity; whereat she flew into a rage and replied, \"Next time I will bring even more knights with me.\" The abbot replied, \"Believe me, unless you depart from this wickedness, you will suffer for it.\" And indeed she did. For the very next night she fell sick and suffered great agony. Hastily she commanded her attendants take her away. As she was fleeing in terror from the lands of St. Évroul she passed by the house of a certain townsman called Roger Sows'-nose, and compelled his infant child to suck the nipple which was causing her most pain. the child sucked and forthwith died; but the woman recovered and returned home. She lived about fifteen years more, but after she had felt the hand of God at St. Évroul she never went near the place again, and took care to avoid dealings either for good or for ill with the monks as long as she enjoyed the transitory pleasures of mortal life.\n\nc. Orderic Vitalis, Volume 2, pp. 123, 125:\n\nWhen Arnold of Échauffour, William Giroie's son, returned after making his fortune in Apulia [Italy] he sought an audience with Duke William and presented him with a costly mantle, humbly begging for the restoration of his inheritance. The duke, bearing in mind the high birth and outstanding valor of the man, and reflecting that he had all too few loyal knights for overcoming the resistance of the men of Maine and Brittany, was inclined to treat him with indulgence and excuse his offenses; he made a truce with Arnold, promising to restore his patrimony to him and granting him freedom of movement throughout the duchy for as long as the truce should last. When Arnold heard the empty promise of the duke he was overjoyed; but time was soon to show that his hopes were vain. For, Mabel, daughter of Talvas, prepared poisoned food and drink, and offered him refreshment on his way back to Gaul [France] from the duke's court; he, however, was given warning of this treachery by a friend who knew her wickedness. When this woman's servants approached as he was talking to some friends at Échauffour, and most pressingly invited him to dine with her, he remembered the friend's warning and was firm in his refusal to touch the food and drink which he feared might be poisoned. It happened that Gilbert, Roger of Montgomery's brother, who was escorting Arnold and had no suspicion of foul play, accepted a cup and drank wine undiluted without dismounting from his horse: the poison quickly took effect and he died two days later at Rémalard. So this treacherous woman who attempted to murder her husband's rival succeeded in killing her husband's only brother, a man who showed the highest integrity in his youth and was remarkable for his knightly virtues. But she took to heart the failure of her first attempt, and not long afterwards devised another scheme no less deadly to bring about the end she desired. She succeeded in winning over Arnold's chamberlain, a knight called Roger Goulafré, and by persuasion and bribes soon made him a willing tool to her nefarious wishes. Again she prepared poisoned cups, which the chamberlain offered to Arnold his lord and [to] Giroie of Courville and William called Gouet of Montmirail. Thus three nobles were poisoned together at Courville. Giroie and William, however, who were taken back to their own homes and could secure proper remedies, recovered through the grace of God and the skill of their doctors; but Arnold who was far from home and could not get proper attention in the houses of others lay ill for some days; and at length, growing worse, he breathed his last on January 1.\n\nd. Orderic Vitalis, Volume 3, pp. 135, 137, 139:\n\nAfter the fall of the family of Giroie, Roger of Montgomery had possession of the whole patrimony of Échauffour and Montreuil for about twenty-six years; and at first, as long as his wife Mabel, who had always hated the sons of Giroie, the founders of Saint Évroul, lived, he showed himself hostile to the monks in many ways at her instigation. But in the end the just judge, who mercifully spares the penitent sinners and sternly smites the impenitent, allowed that cruel woman, who had shed the blood of many and had forcibly disinherited many lords and compelled them to beg their bread in foreign lands, to perish herself by the sword of Hugh [Bunel], whom she had unjustly deprived of his paternal inheritance by seizing his castle at La Roche-Mabille. He, frenzied with grief, found a reckless daring; and taking with him his three brothers who were renowned for their courage in warfare, penetrated by night into the countess's chamber. Finding her in the castle of Bures on the Dive, where she was relaxing in bed after a bath, he struck off her head with his sword and so avenged the loss of his patrimony. When the murder of this terrible lady had been accomplished many rejoiced at her fate, and the authors of the crime fled away to Apulia. ... The monks of Troarn, where Durand was abbot, buried the mutilated corpse on December 5 and, more through the partiality of friends than because of any special deserts of hers, inscribed this epitaph over her tomb:\n\nFrom the high stock of noble parents sprung,\n\nMabel, great lady, lies beneath this tomb.\n\nShe among famous women showed most her worth,\n\nKnown for her merits over all the earth.\n\nIn mind most keen, alert, tireless in deed,\n\nShe spoke with purpose, counseled well in need.\n\nIn stature slight, but great in probity,\n\nLavish in spending, dressed with dignity;\n\nThe shield of her father's inheritance, a tower\n\nGuarding the frontier; to some neighbors dear,\n\nTo others terrible; she died by the sword,\n\nBy night, by stealth, for we are mortals all.\n\nAnd since in death she sorely wants our aid\n\nPray for her: prove your friendship in her need.\n\nAfter the murder of Mabel, Earl Roger married another wife named Adelais, the daughter of Evrard of Le Puiset, who was one of the most highly-born nobles in France. Earl Roger had by his first wife five sons and four daughters, whose names were these: Robert of Bellême, Hugh of Montgomery, Roger of Poitou, Philip, and Arnulf; Emma, nun and abbess of Almenèches, the Countess Matilda who was the wife of Count Robert of Meulan, Mabel the wife of Hugh of Châteauneuf, and Sybil the wife of Robert fitz Hamon. By his second wife he had a son named Evrard, who was well educated and has remained to this day among the royal chaplains in the household of the kings of England, William and Henry. The second wife was utterly unlike the first in character. She was remarkable for her gentleness and piety, and continually encouraged her husband to befriend monks and protect the poor.\n\n(back to top)\n\nB. Bertrade of Montfort\n\na. Orderic Vitalis on Bertrade, from: The Ecclesiastical History, ed. Chibnall, volume 4, pp. 261, 263:\n\nAbout this time [1092] a disgraceful scandal began in the kingdom of France. Bertrade, countess of Anjou, feared that her husband might treat her as he had already treated two other wives, and that if she were deserted she would be despised by all like a low harlot. Being fully conscious of her high birth and beauty, she sent a loyal messenger to King Philip of France, to tell him what she had in mind; for she thought it better to desert her husband voluntarily and seek another than to be deserted by him and [be] exposed to public scorn. The outcome was that the weak prince [ie., King Philip], learning of the wanton woman's desire, agreed to the crime, and received her rapturously after she had left her husband and fled to France. Then he separated from his highly born and pious wife, the daughter of the nobleman Florentius, duke of Frisia, who had borne him Louis and Constance, and took as his wife Bertrade, who had already lived for four years with Fulk [count] of Anjou. Bishop Odo of Bayeux performed the disgraceful marriage, and received from the adulterous king as a reward for this infamous service the churches of the town of Mantes, which he held for some time. None of the French bishops would agree to perform this shocking ceremony; but respecting the rules of canon law they chose rather to please God than man, and all with one voice rejected and anathematized the shameful union. So the absconding concubine [ie., Bertrade] left the adulterous count and went to live with the adulterous king until his death parted them. The detestable sin of adultery, sad to tell, led to terrible threats and preparations for war between the rival lords. Then the cunning woman [Bertrade] soothed the animosity of the rivals and by her wiles brought them together in such close alliance that she was able to prepare a splendid banquet for them, persuade them both to recline at the same table, and on the following night prepare couches for them both in the same chamber, while she herself attended to all their wants in a fitting way. Pope Urban sent papal legates into France and reproved the erring king both in his letters and through the remonstrances of priests, persuading and rebuking him for repudiating his lawful wife and marrying an adulteress in defiance of God's law. But he grew hardened in his wickedness like the deaf adder which blocks its ears to the voice of the charmer, spurned the arguments of the fathers who corrected him, and continued to wallow in his shameful adultery until he had got two sons, Philip and Florus, by the adulteress. So for about fifteen years while Urban and Paschal were popes he was under an interdict. During that time he never wore his crown, nor put on the purple, nor took part in any solemn celebration in royal state. As soon as the clergy heard of the king of France approaching any town or city, all the bells stopped ringing and all sung offices were silenced. So it was a time of public mourning, and the divine offices were performed only in private as long as the erring prince remained in that diocese. But on account of his royal dignity he was allowed by the bishops, whose lord he was, to have his own chaplain to recite private Masses for him and his immediate household.\n\nb. Abbot Suger of St. Denis on Bertrade de Montfort, from: Suger, The Deeds of Louis the Fat, trans. R. Cusimano and J. Moorhead (Washington, DC: Catholic University of America Press, 1992), 81.\n\nA lack of good faith leads to evil being returned for good more often than good for evil. The latter is proper to God, the former to neither God nor man: nevertheless, it is something that is done. And this mark of wickedness was on Philip, the brother of King Louis [ie., Louis VII, Bertrada's step-son and the son of Philip I by his first wife], who had been born of the irregular union with the Angevin woman [ie., Bertrade]. The lord Louis had yielded to the seductive flattery of his noble and most sycophantic stepmother and, at the insistence of his father, to whom he never refused anything, gave Philip lordship over Montlhéry and the castle of Mantes, which were located in the very bowels of the kingdom. Ungrateful for such favors, Philip placed his trust in the great nobility of his lineage and dared to rebel. His uncle [Bertrade's brother] was Amalric of Montfort, a distinguished knight and a very powerful baron, and his [half-]brother was Fulk, the count of Anjou who was later to become king of Jerusalem [ie., Count Fulk V]. But his mother [Bertrade] wielded greater power than all of these [men]. A clever shrew, she had great skill in that amazing artifice women customarily use to trample boldly on their husbands even after they have tormented them with abuse. She had so fully tamed her first husband, the Angevin [Count Fulk IV], that he still venerated her as if she were his lady, even after he was totally rejected from her marriage bed. He often sat on a stool at her feet like someone under a spell, completely surrendering to her will. The mother, her sons, and the whole progeny had one chief interest; if for any reason, disaster should befall the king, one of the brothers [ie, one of Bertrade's sons by Philip, not the first-born son, Louis VII] would succeed him; and in this way the whole family would joyfully raise its head to the throne of the kingdom and share in the honor and the lordship.\n\n(back to top)\n\nC. Other Norman Noblewomen, from the Pen of Orderic Vitalis\n\na. Queen Matilda as regent, queen and mother (Orderic Vitalis, Historia Ecclesiastica, volume 2:209, 210, 215, 223, 225)\n\nDuring this time [shortly after William I conquered England] various rumors from across the Channel were passing from mouth to mouth and causing alarm to the king, for they contained evil reports as well as good and hinted that the Normans were to be massacred by the hostile English, supported by the Danes and other barbarous peoples. So the king entrusted the duchy of Normandy to his wife Matilda and young son, Robert, leaving God-fearing bishops and warlike lords to help them protect the province. Then during the night of the sixth of December he reached the mouth of the Dieppe river beyond the town of Arques, and, setting sail with a southerly wind in the first watch of a bitter night, made a good crossing and reached the harbor of Winchelsea on the opposite shore next morning. ... On this voyage the king was accompanied by Roger of Montgomery, whom he had left with his wife to act as regent of Normandy when he first sailed to conquer England.\n\nIn the year Our Lord 1068 King William sent ambassadors to Normandy to summon his wife Matilda to join him. At once she gladly obeyed her husband's commands and crossed with a great company of vassals and noble women. ... Ealdred, Archbishop of York, who had anointed her husband, now anointed Matilda as queen consort on Whit Sunday [11 May 1068] in the second year of King William's reign. The royal lady, within a year of her coronation, bore a son called Henry, whom she made heir to all her lands in England. ...\n\nWhilst he was quelling the storms of war that rose on every side, King William sent his beloved wife Matilda back to Normandy so that she might give up her time to religious devotions in peace, away from the English tumults, and together with the boy Robert could keep the duchy secure. She was the kinswoman of Philip, king of France, she sprang from the stock of the kings of Gaul and emperors of Germany, and was renowned equally for nobility of blood and character. She bore her distinguished husband the offspring he desired, both sons and daughters: Robert and Richard, William Rufus and Henry, Agatha and Constance, Adelaide, Adela and Cecilia. ... The queen herself was endowed with fairness of face, noble birth, learning, beauty of character, and -what is and ever will be more worthy of praise - strong faith and fervent love of Christ. The alms which this princess daily distributed with such zeal brought more succor than I can express to her husband, struggling on the field of battle.\n\nb. The Impact of the Norman Conquest of England on Marriage (2:219, 221)\n\nAt this time certain Norman women, consumed by fierce lust, sent message after message to their husbands urging them to return at once, and adding that unless they did so with all speed they would take other husbands for themselves. For they dared not join their men themselves, being unaccustomed to the sea crossing and afraid of seeking them out in England, where they were engaging in armed forays every day and blood flowed freely on both sides. The king, with so much fighting on his hands, was most anxious to keep all his knights about him, and made them a friendly offer of lands and revenues and great authority, promising them more when he had completely rid the kingdom of his enemies. His loyal barons and stalwart fighting-men were greatly perturbed, for they saw that continual risings threatened the king and their brothers, friends, and allies, and feared that if they abandoned him they would be openly branded as traitors and cowardly deserters. On the other hand, what could honorable men do if their lascivious wives polluted their beds with adultery and brought indelible shame and dishonor on their offspring? As a result Hugh of Grandmesnil, who was governor of the Gewissae - that is, the region around Winchester - and his brother-in-law Humphrey of Tilleul, who had held the castle of Hastings from the day of its foundation, and many other departed the country heavy at heart, and unwilling to go because they were deserting the king whilst he was struggling in a foreign land. They returned to Normandy to oblige their wanton wives; but neither they nor their heirs were ever able to recover the fiefs [in England] which they had held and chosen to abandon.\n\nc. A Norman wife advises her son and husband (3:243-245)\n\nThe young Ralph, son of Albert of Cravent, when he first took arms as a knight, attacked the monk Guitmund in Vallee, as he was traveling to Maule with his servant, flung him to the ground, and took away his horses. The monk reached Pacy on foot, and with loud lamentations asked Albert for help against his son. To this the same knight replied insolently, and refused any kind of help in recovering the horses. Seeing this, his wife Aubrée began to lament and wring her hands and tear her hair, and to weep for her son as if he were already dead. She cried out with a loud voice, �O Ralph, my son, why have you begun your initiation with deeds not of knighthood but of madness? Alas you are being led astray by abominable teachers, by whose fatal sophistries you are now foolishly seduced, and are being dragged wretchedly to the pit of damnation. Oh how sad is the message you have sent me, and what bitter grief you have brought me! Misguided youth, what can I say to you? By unjustly injuring a helpless servant of Christ you have deserved a fatal punishment yourself. O Ralph my son, what did you do in your frenzy, when you struck your first blow as a knight against the Almighty? Know most surely that I shall have little joy and long sorrow for your misdeed. Do not all the learned doctors agree, and declare with one voice in many places, that the Most High dwells in his saints, and patiently endures joys and sufferings with them? O father, help your crazy son, and try by every means in your power to ensure that the stolen horses are restored to the sorrowing monk, lest your only son become possessed of a demon here and now for such a crime.' So as this wise mother pleaded for the preservation of her son and endeavored to console the injured monk, Albert together with his whole household was deeply moved and terrified, gave his mule to the monk, sending his men-at-arms to escort him to Bréval, and bound his son with a terrible oath to restore without delay everything that had been taken from him. So Guitmund after recovering his horses, returned to Pacy, giving thanks to Albert and his wife, and both of them begged his forgiveness for the wrong done to him and obtained it. The lady Aubrée was a daughter of Hugh, bishop of Bayeux [d.1049], and had a high reputation among her neighbors for the great virtue, appropriate to her station, that she showed. In the same year the young knight fell sick and, repenting of his misdeeds, sought forgiveness from the monks and vowed himself and all his possessions to Saint-Évroul. On his death his sorrowing father had his body carried to Saint-Évroul, and granted half the tithe of Lommoie freely as he himself held it.\n\nd. The Power of Persuasion (3:257, 259)\n\nThe young Walter [of Auffay] was handsome but lacking in wisdom, and consequently he was easily dominated by Godmund and other false teachers. He collected round himself a group of frivolous companions, and led astray by their pernicious influence he dissipated his inheritance, and continually injured and harassed monks and clerics and honest peasants. But when at last he became a knight, he married a beautiful and persuasive wife, Avice, daughter of Herbrand, and by her advice and wise influence he was somewhat restrained from his earlier folly. She indeed was prudent and golden-tongued, devoted to God from her earliest years, and utterly given over to good works. She had three brothers, all distinguished knights, called Jordan, William and Robert; by their help their brother-in-law shook off the influence of his greedy sycophants and recovered some of the property that had been dissipated and lost to no purpose through fraud and robbery. This lady bore her husband twelve sons and daughters, most of whom died prematurely in infancy. Finally after living for fifteen years with her husband she died on 22 February [actually March], and was buried in the cloister of the monks she had so truly loved, by the door of the church. Warin the prior had a stone vault built over her, and Vitalis the Englishman [ie., Orderic Vitalis himself] composed this epitaph:\n\nBeneath lies the body of Avice, born nobly;\n\nMay Christ help her to heaven, to have life eternal\n\nTo her Lord while she lived she looked with great longing\n\nAnd practiced his precepts, abiding in probity.\n\nMost fair of grace, well-spoken, and full of wisdom,\n\nShe strove without ceasing to share in God's service;\n\nFor holy masses and hours she was daily hearing.\n\nSo as a modest maid she modeled her living.\n\nAfter, when she was wedded to the noble knight Walter,\n\nFor fifteen years she lived in felicity\n\nAnd gave him in gladness twelve goodly children.\n\nSpecially she shone with the light of sound morals;\n\nThe cult of the church she steadfastly cherished,\n\nBestowing her best jewels for the benefit of the altar.\n\nGenerous in giving to priests, monks, all of God's needy,\n\nTo widows, waifs, and the sick she was gentle and well-doing;\n\nSo chaste and so constant that not the most craven\n\nDared to breathe one base word against her bright honor.\n\nOn the feast of St. Peter, falling in February [March?]\n\nCame dark death upon her, and closed her devotions.\n\nMen of Auffay lament for the loss of this lady;\n\nMay God grant her soul gladness and glory eternal. Amen.\n\ne. The Countess of Blois restores the courage of her husband (5:325)\n\nSo in the year of our Lord 1101 William, duke of Poitou, gathered a great army [to set out on crusade] ... It is said that three hundred thousand armed men followed his standard when he left Aquitaine. Also Stephen, count palatine of Blois, was an object of contempt because he had fled disgracefully from the siege of Antioch, deserting his glorious comrades who were sharing in the agonies of Christ. He was continually chided by many people, and was driven to embark on another crusade as much by fear as by shame. His wife Adela [daughter of William the Conqueror] also frequently urged him to it, and between conjugal caresses used to say \"Far be it for you, my lord, to lower yourself by enduring the scorn of such men as these for long. Remember the courage for which you were famous in your youth, and take up the arms of the glorious crusade for the sake of saving thousands, so that Christians may raise great thanksgiving all over the world, and the lot of the heathen may be terror and the public overthrow of their unholy law.\" These speeches and many more like them were uttered by the wise and spirited woman to her husband; but he, knowing the perils and difficulties, shrank from undertaking such hardships a second time. At length he recovered his courage and strength, and took the road with many thousands of Frenchmen, persevering until he reached Christ's sepulcher in spite of the terrible difficulties encountered on the way.\n\n(back to top)\n\nback to Translated Texts Index"
