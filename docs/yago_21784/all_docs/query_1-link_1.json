        "text": "Philip I (born 1052—died July 29/30, 1108, Melun, France) was the king of France (1059–1108) who came to the throne at a time when the Capetian monarchy was extremely weak but who succeeded in enlarging the royal estates and treasury by a policy of devious alliances, the sale of his neutrality in the quarrels of powerful vassals, and the practice of simony on a huge scale.\n\nPhilip was the elder son of Henry I of France by his second wife, Anne of Kiev. Crowned at Reims in May 1059, he became sole king on his father’s death in 1060; Baldwin V, count of Flanders, exercised the regency. Two years after he came of age in 1066, he obtained the county of Gâtinais as the price of his neutrality in a family struggle over Anjou and thereby linked the royal possessions in Sens with those around Paris, Melun, and Orléans. His major efforts, however, were directed toward Normandy, in which from 1076 he supported Robert II Curthose, its ineffectual duke, first against Robert’s father, King William I of England, then against Robert’s brother, William II. Philip’s true goal was to prevent emergence of a rival power in Normandy, for he was willing to abandon Robert whenever it seemed possible he might become dangerous.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz"
