        "text": "Full Name: Philip IV called Philip the Fair, the handsome and the Iron King\n\nProfession: King of France and Navarre\n\nBiography: Philip IV of France, also known as \"Phillip the Fair,\" who was also King of Navarre by virtue of his marriage to Joan I of Navarre. While he was physically appealing, his rule was rigid and autocratic which led others to give him less pleasant nicknames such as \"the Iron King.\"\n\nDuring his reign, Phillip sought to assert the monarchy against the power of nobility and clergy. This aim set the stage for France to move from a feudal political structure to a modern centralized state. As a result, Phillip held an important place and significant influence in the European political scene.\n\nBorn: 1268\n\nBirthplace: Ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau, France"
