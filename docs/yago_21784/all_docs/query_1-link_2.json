His mother, Joan of Boulogne, who subsequently married the king of France, John II, ruled Philip’s lands during his minority, but after her death in 1360 he was declared of age. Though he married at the age of 12, he died without heirs, and his domains were dismembered. King John granted the duchy of Burgundy to his own son, Philip II the Bold (1363).\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Encyclopaedia Britannica."
