        "text": "It can be argued that Mary’s marriage to Philip forced England into a diplomatic relationship with Spain which led to Spain dominating England’s foreign policy interests, particularly Philip realised that Mary would probably not produce an heir to the throne. When Mary first took the throne it was important that she married, as a son or daughter of her own would be more likely to continue the Catholic faith that she had worked to restore, and Mary was convinced that she needed a husband to offer advice, and father the Catholic heir that was necessary to complete her restoration of Catholicism. This marriage may have led to England's foreign policy being dominated by Spain, for example, in September 1556, England faced pressure to join a war against France on Spain’s side. Philip demanded English support and on the 7th June 1557 England declared war on France and the English navy proceeded to clear the Channel and patrol in the Atlantic. Troops were put on stand-by in the Calais Pale and 7000 soldiers were sent to aid the 70,000 Spanish and Imperial troops fighting the French.\n\nHowever, there is also much evidence to suggest that the marriage between Mary and Philip was equally fair to both countries, and that the marriage did not lead to England being dominated by Spain and the serving of Spanish interests. The marriage treaty can be considered as having been very favourable towards England. For example, Philip was to receive the title of ‘King’ and rule as joint sovereign, but he could not possess any sovereign authority in his own right. In addition to this, Philip could not promote foreigners to office in England, and was not allowed to take the Queen or any children they might have out of the country, without the permission of the nobility."
