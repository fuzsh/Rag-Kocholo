Notes\n\nsee Ancestral Roots, lines 125, 126, 127\n\nsee Wikipedia, “Hugh de Kevelioc, 5th Earl of Chester”:\n\nHugh de Kevelioc, 5th Earl of Chester (1147 â 30 June 1181) was the son of Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester and Maud of Gloucester, daughter of Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester (otherwise known as Robert de Caen, the illegitimate son of Henry I of England, making her Henry's granddaughter).\n\nEarly life\n\nHe is thought to have been born in Kevelioc in Monmouth. But he may have taken the name of the cwmwd of Cyfeiliog (in modern Powys) in the southern part of the Kingdom of Powys, Wales.\n\nHe was underage when his father's death in 1153 made him heir to his family's estates on both sides of the Channel. He joined the baronial Revolt of 1173â1174 against King Henry II of England, and was influential in convincing the Bretons to revolt. After being captured and imprisoned after the Battle of Alnwick, he finally got his estates restored in 1177, and served in King Henry's Irish campaigns.\n\nMarriage\n\nIn 1169 he married Bertrade de Montfort of Evreux, daughter of Simon III de Montfort, who in turn was the son of Amaury III of Montfort. She was the cousin of King Henry, who gave her away in marriage. Their children were:[1][2]\n\n1. Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester\n\n2. Matilda de Blondeville, aka Matilda (Maud) of Chester (1171â1233), married David of Scotland, 8th Earl of Huntingdon\n\n3. Mabel of Chester, married William d'Aubigny, 3rd Earl of Arundel\n\n4. Agnes of Chester (died 2 November 1247), married William de Ferrers, 4th Earl of Derby; ancestors of Joseph Priestley\n\n5. Hawise of Chester (1180â1242), married Robert II de Quincy\n\n6. Beatrix of Chester, married Lord William Belward of Malpas\n\nHugh also had another daughter, Amice of Chester, who married Ralph de Mainwaring and was the ancestress of that family. There is no record of Amice's mother or whether she was Hugh's wife or mistress. The question of Amice's legitimacy has been subject to a longstanding dispute.[3]\n\nOne letter from the Pope suggests that Llywelyn Fawr may have been married to an unnamed sister of Earl Ranulph of Chester in about 1192, but there appears to be no confirmation of this.[4] If this was the case it could have been either Mabel or Hawise, or perhaps Amice, and the marriage would have had to have been annulled before any subsequent marriages.\n\nDeath and succession\n\nHugh of Kevelioc died 30 June 1181 at Leek, Staffordshire, England. He was succeeded by his son, Ranulf.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
