Biography of Fabio TESTI

Fabio TESTI is an actor born 02 August 1941 in Peschiera del Garda, near Verona (Italy).

Fabio Testi studied at the Academy of Dramatic Arts while figuring, singing, and playing in commercials.

He thus crosses the road of Sergio Leone, as stuntman on THE GOOD, THE BRUTE AND THE TRUAND (1966), then in a small role of IL WAS ONCE IN THE WEST (1968).

He continues in the spaghetti western, getting major roles in AND NOW, RECOMMEND YOUR EME TO GOD (1969) and DJANGO AND SARTANA of Demofilo Fidani (1970).

But it is with THE GARDEN OF THE FINZI-CONTINI of Vittorio De Sica (1970), that it goes around the world.

It then shines in DAMAGE THAT IT IS A FUCK of Giuseppe Patroni Griffi (1971) with Charlotte Rampling, THE KILLER of Denys de la PatelliÃ¨re (1971) opposite Jean Gabin, CAMORRA / THE KILLERS ÉGAGES (1972) and LUCIA AND THE GOUPS by Pasquale Squitieri (1973, photo) with Claudia Cardinale.

He still appears in France in Claude Chabrol's NADA (1973), opposite Romy Schneider in Andrzej Zulawski's L'IMPORTANT C'EST D'AIMER (1975), then finds Dominique Sanda in L'HÃ ? RITAGE de Mauro Bolognini (1976).

Endowed with a charismatic brown physique, he led many action films, from Lucio Fulci's 1975 FOURRE DE L'APOCALYPSE to Enzo G.Castellari's (1976) polar BIG RACKET.

It is Robert Mitchum in the chronicle of war THE AMBASSADOR of J. Lee Thompson (1984), then crosses Coluche in the comedy LE FOU DE GUERRE of Dino Risi (1985).

So few of his films arrive to France, he does not stop turning for the big and the small screen, from IGUANA of Monte Hellman (1988) to the televised blockbuster THE DESERT OF FIRE (Enzo G. Castellari, 1997).

He also appears on stage, in Spain as in Italy, and remains a popular face of the transalpine peninsula.

Two American productions appeal to him at the same time, Gary Winick's LETTERS TO JULIET sentimental bluette (2010) and the unrelated chronicle of friend Monte Hellman ROAD TO NOWHERE (2010).
