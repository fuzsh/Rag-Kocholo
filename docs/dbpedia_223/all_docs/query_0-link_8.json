        "text": "This gorgeous Teutonic temptress was one of Hollywood's most captivating imports of the 1960s. Blonde and beautiful, Berlin-born Elke Sommer, with her trademark pouty lips, high cheekbones and sky-high bouffant hairdos, proved irresistible to American audiences, whether adorned in lace or leather, or donning lingerie or lederhosen . She was born in Berlin-Spandau on November 5, 1940 with the unlikely name of Else Schletz-Ho to a Lutheran minister and his wife. The family was forced to evacuate to Erlangen, during World War II in 1942, a small university town in the southern region of Germany. It was here that her parents first introduced her to water colors and her lifelong passion for painting was ignited. Her father's death in 1955, when she was only 14, interrupted her education and she relocated to Great Britain, where she learned English and made ends meet as an au pair. She eventually attended college back in Germany and entertained plans to become a diplomatic translator but, instead, decided to try modeling.\n\nAfter winning a beauty title (\"Miss Viareggio Turistica\") while on vacation in Italy, she caught the attention of renowned film actor/director Vittorio De Sica and began performing on screen. Her debut film was in the Italian feature, Uomini e nobiluomini (1959), which starred DeSica and was directed by Giorgio Bianchi. Following a few more Italian pictures, which included her first starring role in Femmine di lusso (1960), also directed by Bianchi, Elke began making a name for herself in German films, as well, and gradually upgraded her status to European sex symbol. A pin-up favorite, she appeared fetchingly in both dramas and comedies, with such continental features as Capricci borghesi (1961), Dolce violenza (1962) and her first English-speaking picture, Entrate senza bussare (1961), to her credit.\n\nHollywood naturally became intrigued and she moved there in the early 1960s to try and tap into the American market. Her sexy innocence made a vivid impression in the all-star, war-themed drama, I vincitori (1963), the Hitchcock-like thriller, Intrigo a Stoccolma (1963), for which she won a \"Best Newcomer\" Golden Globe Award, and, especially, Uno sparo nel buio (1964), the classic bumbling comedy where she proved a shady and sexy foil to Peter Sellers' Inspector Clousseau. She grew in celebrity, which was certainly helped after showing off her physical assets, posing for spreads in Playboy Magazine. In the meantime, she was appearing opposite the hunkiest of Hollywood actors including Paul Newman, James Garner, Glenn Ford and Stephen Boyd.\n\nAlways a diverting attraction in spy intrigue or breezy comedy, she was too often misused and setbacks began to occur when the quality of her films began to deteriorate. The tacky Hollywood entry, Tramonto di un idolo (1966), the Bob Hope misfire, Un bikini per Didi (1966), the tired Dean Martin \"Matt Helm\" spy spoof, Missione compiuta stop. Bacioni Matt Helm (1968), and her title role in the tasteless Cold War comedy, La minigonna proibita della compagna Schultz (1968), starring Gli eroi di Hogan (1965) alumnus, Bob Crane, Werner Klemperer and Leon Askin, proved her undoing.\n\nThe multilingual actress, whose career took her to scores of different countries over time and benefited from speaking seven languages fluently, resorted to a number of low-budget features in Europe, including two Italian horror movies directed by Mario Bava that have now gone on to become cult classics: Gli orrori del castello di Norimberga (1972) and L'esorcista (1973) rip-off, Lisa e il diavolo (1973). The latter movie actually was a guilty pleasure. \"Lisa\" was re-released in 1975 as \"The House of Exorcism\" and added more footage of a demonic Elke, Linda Blair style, spewing frogs, insects, green pea soup and a slew of cuss words! In England, she good-naturedly appeared in the \"comedy\" films, Il complesso del trapianto (1971), and its equally cheeky sequel, Ma il tuo funziona... o no? (1974), which starred Hywel Bennett (later Leigh Lawson) as the first man to have a penis transplant(!). She also showed up in one of the later \"Carry On\" farces, entitled Camping pon pon (1975).\n\nElke fared better on television, where she appeared in the television pilot, Probe (1972), opposite Hugh O'Brian, as well as the well-made 1980s miniseries, I diari del terzo reich (1982), La guerra di Jenny (1985), Anastasia - L'ultima dei Romanov (1986) and Pietro il grande (1986). In addition, she made a few TV guest appearances on such popular shows as \"Fantasy Island,\" \"The Love Boat\" and \"St. Elsewhere.\"\n\nA delightful personality on the talk show circuit, the lovely Elke also made appearances as a cabaret singer and, in time, put out several albums. She found a creative outlet on stage too with such vehicles as \"Irma la Douce\", \"Born Yesterday\", \"Cactus Flower\", \"Woman of the Year\" and \"Same Time, Next Year\".\n\nDividing her time between here and in Germany in later years, she added her usual charm to films both here (Lily in Love (1984), Severed Ties (1992)), and in Germany (Himmelsheim (1988), Flashback - Mörderische Ferien (2000), Das Leben ist zu lang (2010)).\n\nThe veteran actress has since focused more time on book writing and painting than she has on acting. Holding her first one-woman art show at the McKenzie Galleries in Beverly Hills in 1965, her artwork bears an exceptionally strong influence to Marc Chagall and she, at one point, hosted a mid-1980s PBS series (\"Painting with Elke\"), that centered on her artwork, which has now exhibited and sold for more than 40 years. Nevertheless, on occasion, she tackles an acting role, often in her native Germany. Divorced from writer and journalist Joe Hyams, whom she met when he interviewed her for a Hollywood article (he recently died in November 2008), she has been married since 1993 to hotelier Wolf Walther.\n\nBlonde, blue-eyed Karin Baal was born as Karin Blauermel in Berlin. She grew up fatherless, raised by her mother who toiled as a seamstress and factory worker. After completing secondary school at age sixteen, Karin commenced training as a fashion illustrator. By pure chance, she learned that the director Georg Tressler was in the process of casting for a 'Marina Vlady'-type as the female lead for his new film Pecore nere (1956). Without any formal acting training whatsoever, Karin passed her audition and was selected for the coveted role as one among 700 other hopefuls. Due to her lack of experience, she was dubbed by Brigitte Grothum.\n\nIn 1959, Karin completed her acting and voice training under Luise Berger and Ilse Bonger. This opened up roles for her in the theatre. In the course of succeeding decades, she appeared regularly on stages in Berlin, Munich and Zurich. The high point of her performing career were successful tours in plays by Heinrich Böll ('Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum'), Jean-Paul Sartre and Francis Durbridge.\n\nOn screen, Karin's role in Teenage Wolfpack set the tone for her subsequent gallery of young rebels, delinquents and temptresses in films like Der Jugendrichter (1960), Die junge Sünderin (1960) (which garnered her a 1960 Bambi as Best Upcoming Actress) and La ragazza Rosemarie (1958). Conversely, she also portrayed 'damsels in distress' in the Edgar Wallace potboilers Gli occhi di Londra (1961) and Giallo cobra (1968).\n\nBy the 70s, Karin had begun to work increasingly in television. Many of her guest appearances were supporting roles in 'Krimis' (crime shows), like Der Kommissar (1969), Squadra speciale K1 (1972), L'Ispettore Derrick (1974), Il commissario Voss (1977) and Tatort (1970). She also featured in a trio of Rainer Werner Fassbinder productions: Berlin Alexanderplatz (1980) (as the niece of Franz Biberkopf, played by Günter Lamprecht), as a resistance fighter in Lili Marleen (1981) and as the mother of madam Lola (1981) (Barbara Sukowa).\n\nKarin's final screen appearance was in 2011. A year later, she published her memoirs under the title Ungezähmt - Mein Leben. In it, she has recounted her tormented personal life, including four failed marriages, problems with depression, alcohol and cocaine addiction and frequent resulting trips to rehab clinics.\n\nBy 2016, and on the road to recovery, she confirmed her retirement from acting, saying that everything (in show biz) today felt 'too impersonal' and 'machine-like'. Karin Baal has latterly resided in Berlin-Charlottenburg, subsisting on a modest pension. In 2018, she was honoured with the inaugural Götz-George-Prize for her lifetime contribution to film.\n\nFrom 1955, Fabio Testi's home town Peschiera del Garda was also home to Bertolazzi Film, a motion picture studio which specialised in the production of colourful pirate movies. Lake Garda was merrily used as the ersatz Caribbean. At Bertolazzi, young Fabio began his career first as an extra, then as a stunt man and body double. As a stunt man, he appeared in the classic westerns Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (1966) and (as one of Henry Fonda's minions in C'era una volta il West (1968). He started getting small film roles from 1967 and this helped to finance his architectural studies at the Antòn Maria Lorgna Institute in Verona. After graduating, Testa did not became a surveyor as originally planned, but made commercials for Coca Cola and proceeded to further studies at Verona's Academy of Fine Arts to improve his acting. For several years, he appeared in genre films, often lesser spaghetti westerns like Quel maledetto giorno d'inverno... Django e Sartana all'ultimo sangue (1970). As a bona fide action hero, his athletic prowess and imposing physique became a definite asset. Nonetheless, still dissatisfied with the roles he was getting, Testi attended diction classes in Cambridge to improve his English and went to London for acting lessons.\n\nUpon his return to Italy, he finally made his breakthrough after being picked by Vittorio De Sica for the role of the ill-fated Giampiero in the Oscar-winning historical drama Il giardino dei Finzi Contini (1970). In the wake of the picture's success, Testi has alternated between performing in art films by directors like Claude Chabrol and Denys de La Patellière, and genre films of the giallo (Cosa avete fatto a Solange? (1972)) or poliziotteschi/crime variety (Camorra (1972), Revolver (1973), I guappi (1974)). Over the years he has acted alongside international stars like Oliver Reed, Anthony Quinn, Robert Mitchum (in I guerrieri del vento (1984)), Eli Wallach and David Hemmings. By the mid-1980's, Testi was seen more often in television productions. In the 90's, he also turned his attention towards the theatre with a role in a stage adaptation of Federico Fellini's La strada (1954).\n\nThough still very active on the screen, Testi has had the time to sideline as a kiwi farmer, an enterprise which grew from a hobby into a lucrative business (Italy, as a result, becoming Europe's first producer of kiwi fruit). In 2006, Testi ran for political office as Mayor of Verona, representing the conservative Cattolici Liberali Cristiani.\n\nAs an unapologetically self-confessed Latin lover type, Testi has made headlines in the press (particularly the Italian gossip press) not only for the work in his chosen profession, but also for a series of well publicized romantic entanglements with actresses Ursula Andress, Edwige Fenech, Jean Seberg and Charlotte Rampling. He was married to the Spanish fashion designer and make-up artist Lola Navarro from 1984 to 1996. His second wife has been art gallery curator Antonella Liguori.\n\nFuchsberger grew up in Heidelberg, attended secondary school and was conscripted into the Reich Labor Service. Towards the end of the war he received training as a parachutist at the jumper school in Wittstock. After the war, Fuchsberger initially worked as a miner and fitter. In 1949 he became advertising manager for the German Building Exhibition in Nuremberg. In 1950, Fuchsberger started his media career as a speaker for Bayerischer Rundfunk and soon appeared in front of the camera as an actor. In 1951 he married the pop singer Gitta Lind. After two and a half years the marriage ended in divorce. In 1954 he became known as \"Private Asch\" in the \"08/15\" films. In the same year he married the actress Gundula Korte. Their son Thomas was born on August 5, 1957.\n\nFrom 1959 to 1972, Fuchsberger, who was also called \"Blacky\" Fuchsberger by his fans, appeared in twelve Edgar Wallace film adaptations, with which he enjoyed great success. By this point he had already appeared in 85 feature films. Blacky didn't just limit himself to acting, but was also the songwriter and show host of shows such as \"Just Don't Get Nervous\", \"Glücksspirale\", \"The Hot Wire\" and \"Let's Go\". In addition, he published his first book, \"Unplanned Adventures,\" in 1972. In the same year he was chief spokesman at the Summer Olympics in Munich. In 1973, Fuchsberger appeared in front of the camera as an actor for the last time when he appeared in the Erich Kästner film adaptation \"The Flying Classroom\". Fuchsberger celebrated success with his celebrity show \"Heut Abend\" from 1980 onward. In total it was broadcast 300 times by 1991. In 1984, Fuchsberger became ambassador for the United Nations Children's Fund \"UNICEF\". He was the first German to be appointed to this office.\n\nIn the 1980s he discovered his love for Australia, where he lived alternately on the island of Tasmania and in Sydney. In 1987 his book \"Good Morning, Australia\" came out and since 1988 he has been making films for his TV series \"Terra Australis\". From 1990 to 1994, Fuchsberger was the presenter of the guessing show \"Yes or No\" and in 1995 he returned to acting as an actor for the first time in 22 years. He played Count \"Alessio Capilupi\" in the three-part television series \"Flames of Love\". Towards the end of the 1990s he appeared in other TV films. In 1998 he appeared in front of the camera for \"The Four Kings\" and \"Tristan and Isolde - A Love for Eternity\". Fuchsberger received numerous awards in his long career, including the \"Bambi\" in 1969 and 1982, the \"Bavarian Order of Merit\" in 1979, the \"Golden Camera\" in 1981, the Federal Cross of Merit in 1983, the \"Golden Europe\" in 1986 and the Grand Federal Cross of Merit in 1994, 2005 the Bavarian Television Prize and in 2006 the Bavarian State Medal for Social Services. In Australia in 1999 he received a certificate of thanks from Tasmania's Prime Minister Jim Bacon for his \"extraordinary commitment and services to the state\".\n\nIn 2000 he completed his 17th film in the series \"Terra Australis\". Joachim \"Blacky\" Fuchsberger continued to play theater even in his old age: from 2001 he appeared with Ralf Bauer in the play \"The Priest Maker\". In the role of the aging priest, he probably showed one of his best acting performances in the confrontation with the non-conformist student priest. The actor was awarded the honorary Bavarian Television Prize on June 3, 2005. As an ambassador for UNICEF, he received the Bavarian State Medal for Social Services in Munich on November 13, 2006. After many years of absence from the screen, Fuchsberger starred in the satire \"News from the Wixxer\" in 2007, based on his Edgar Wallace successes. In 2009 he became a member of the board of trustees of the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup and patron of the volunteer program for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. On October 14, 2010, his son Thomas drowned in the Kulmbach mill stream. In 2011 he received the television award for his life's work. On June 4, 2013, he suffered his second stroke after 2003.\n\nJoachim Fuchsberger died on September 11, 2014, at the age of 87, in Grünwald near Munich.\n\nAlain Fabien Maurice Marcel Delon was born in Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine, France, to Édith (Arnold) and Fabien Delon. His father was of French and Corsican Italian descent, and his mother was of French and German ancestry. His parents divorced early on, and Delon had a stormy childhood, being frequently expelled from school.\n\nIn 1953/1954 he served with the French Marines in Indochina. In the mid-'50s he worked at various odd jobs including waiter, salesman and porter in Les Halles market. He decided to try an acting career and in 1957 made his film debut in Yves Allégret's Godot (1957). He declined an offer of a contract from producer David O. Selznick, and in 1960 he received international recognition for his role in Luchino Visconti's Rocco e i suoi fratelli (1960). In 1961 he appeared on the stage in \"'Tis a Pity She's a Whore\", directed by Visconti, in Paris. In 1964 he formed his own production company, Delbeau Productions, and he produced a short film directed by Guy Gilles. In 1968 he found himself involved in murder, drug and sex scandal that indirectly implicated major politicians and show-business personalities, but he was eventually cleared of all charges. In the late 1960s he formed another company. Adel Film, and the next year he began producing features. In 1981 he directed his first film, Per la pelle di un poliziotto (1981).\n\nDelon was a sensation early in his career; he came to embody the young, energetic, often morally corrupted man. With his breathtaking good looks he was also destined to play tender lovers and romantic heroes, and he was a French embodiment of the type created in America by James Dean. His first outstanding success came with the role of the parasite Tom Ripley in 'Rene Clement''s sun-drenched thriller Delitto in pieno sole (1960). Delon presented a psychological portrait of a murderous young cynic who attempts to take on the identity of his victim. A totally different role was offered to him by Visconti in Rocco e i suoi fratelli (1960). In this film Delon plays the devoted Rocco, who accepts the greatest sacrifices to save his shiftless brother Simon.\n\nAfter several other films in Italy, Delon returned to the criminal genre with Jean Gabin in Colpo grosso al Casinò (1963). This work, a classic example of the genre, was distinguished not only by a soundly worked-out screenplay, but also by the careful production and the excellent performances of both Delon and Gabin. It was only in the late 1960s that the sleek and lethal Delon came to epitomize the calm, psychopathic hoodlum, staring into the camera like a cat assessing a mouse. His tough, ruthless side was first used to real effect by Jean-Pierre Melville in Frank Costello faccia d'angelo (1967). In 1970 he had a huge success in the bloodstained Borsalino (1970)--which he also produced--playing a small-time gangster in the 1930s who, with Jean-Paul Belmondo, becomes king of the Marseilles underworld. Delon later won critical acclaim for his roles, against type, in Joseph Losey's Mr. Klein (1976) in which he played (brilliantly) the icily sinister title role, and the art-movie Un amore di Swann (1984). He has an older son Anthony Delon (who has also acted in a number of movies) from his first marriage to Nathalie Delon, and has a young son and daughter, Alain-Fabien and Anouchka with Rosalie.\n\nA true character actor in the best sense of the word, offbeat British thespian Peter Vaughan's hefty frame could appear intimidating or benevolent; his mere presence menacing or avuncular. Adept at playing both sides of the law, his characters usually possessed a strange, somewhat wary countenance that seemed to keep his audience slightly off balance. This veteran actor has been a stalwart presence for nearly fifty years. Born Peter Ohm in 1923, he began on the stage and didn't enter films until 1959, well into his thirties.\n\nMarried in 1952 to rising actress Billie Whitelaw, Peter was primarily in the background at first, offering a cheapjack gallery of thugs, unsmiling cops, and foreign agents in movies. An easily unsympathetic bloke, he played unbilled policemen in his first two films, then slowly gravitated up the credits list. He appeared as the chief of police in the spy drama Codice ZX3 controspionaggio! (1962), which also featured his wife, and then gained a bit more attention in a prime part as an offbeat insurance investigator in the B movie Smokescreen (1964), a role that propelled him into the higher ranks. Noticeably shady roles came with playing Tallulah Bankhead's seedy handyman who meets a fatal end in the Gothic horror Una notte per morire (1965) [aka Die! Die! My Darling!]; his villainous roles in the spy thrillers Colpo su colpo (1967) opposite Frank Sinatra and L'uomo che viene da lontano (1967); a German thug in Vortice di sabbia (1968); and Sgt. Walker in The Bofors Gun (1968).\n\nDivorced from Whitelaw in 1966, he later married actress Lillias Walker, who had roles in a couple of his pictures: La baia di Malachi (1973) and Intimate Reflections (1975). TV became a large source of income for Vaughan in the 1970s, particularly in his role of Grouty in Porridge (1974) on both the large and small screen, and his quirky demeanor fitted like a glove for bizarre director Terry Gilliam, who cast him as the Ogre in I banditi del tempo (1981) and then as Mr. Helpman in Brazil (1985). For the past few decades he has maintained a healthy balance between film (including standout roles in Zulu Dawn (1979), Quel che resta del giorno (1993) and Tu chiamami Peter (2004)) and TV mini-movies, both contemporary and period. He was still performing into his 90s: his final role was Maester Aemon Targaryen in HBO's Il trono di spade (2011).\n\nHe died at age 93 on December 6, 2016, in Sussex, England.\n\nProbably best-remembered for his turbulent personal life with Elizabeth Taylor (whom he married twice), Richard Burton was nonetheless also regarded as an often brilliant British actor of the post-WWII period.\n\nBurton was born Richard Walter Jenkins in 1925 into a Welsh (Cymraeg)-speaking family in Pontrhydyfen to Edith Maude (Thomas) and Richard Walter Jenkins, a coal miner. The twelfth of thirteen children, his mother died while he was a toddler and his father later abandoned the family, leaving him to be raised by an elder sister, Cecilia. An avid fan of Shakespeare, poetry and reading, he once said \"home is where the books are\". He received a scholarship to Oxford University to study acting and made his first stage appearance in 1944.\n\nHis first film appearances were in routine British movies such as The Last Days of Dolwyn (1949), Tempesta a Liverpool (1950) and La quinta offensiva (1951). Then he started to appear in Hollywood movies such as Mia cugina Rachele (1952), La tunica (1953) and Alessandro il grande (1956), added to this he was also spending considerable time in stage productions, both in the UK and USA, often to splendid reviews. The late 1950s was an exciting and inventive time in UK cinema, often referred to as the \"British New Wave\", and Burton was right in the thick of things, and showcased a sensational performance in I giovani arrabbiati (1959). He also appeared with a cavalcade of international stars in the World War II magnum opus Il giorno più lungo (1962), and then onto arguably his most \"notorious\" role as that of Marc Antony opposite Elizabeth Taylor in the hugely expensive Cleopatra (1963). This was, of course, the film that kick-started their fiery and passionate romance (plus two marriages), and the two of them appeared in several productions over the next few years including International Hotel (1963), Castelli di sabbia (1965), the dynamic Chi ha paura di Virginia Woolf? (1966) and La bisbetica domata (1967), as well as box office flops like I commedianti (1967). Burton did better when he was off on his own giving higher caliber performances, such as those in Becket e il suo re (1964), the film adaptation of the Tennessee Williams play La notte dell'iguana (1964), the brilliant espionage thriller La spia che venne dal freddo (1965) and alongside Clint Eastwood in the World War II action adventure film Dove osano le aquile (1968).\n\nHis audience appeal began to decline somewhat by the end of the 1960s as fans turned to younger, more virile male stars, however Burton was superb in Anna dei mille giorni (1969) as King Henry VIII, he put on a reasonable show in the boring Attacco a Rommel (1971), was over the top in the awful Il mascalzone (1971), gave sleepwalking performances in Una faccia di c... (1972) and Barbablù (1972), and was wildly miscast in the ludicrous L'assassinio di Trotsky (1972).\n\nBy the early 1970s, quality male lead roles were definitely going to other stars, and Burton found himself appearing in some movies of dubious quality, just to pay the bills and support family, including Divorzia lui divorzia lei (1973) (his last on-screen appearance with Taylor), L'uomo del clan (1974), Breve incontro (1974), Jackpot (1974) (which was never completed) and L'esorcista II - L'eretico (1977). However, he won another Oscar nomination for his excellent performance as a concerned psychiatrist in Equus (1977). He appeared with fellow acting icons Richard Harris and Roger Moore in I 4 dell'oca selvaggia (1978) about mercenaries in South Africa. While the film had a modest initial run, over the past thirty-five years it has picked up quite a cult following. His final performances were as the wily inquisitor \"O'Brien\" in the most recent film version of George Orwell's dystopian Orwell 1984 (1984), in which he won good reviews, and in the TV mini series Ellis Island (1984). He passed away on August 5, 1984 in Celigny, Switzerland from a cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nMartin Henry Balsam was born on November 4, 1919 in the Bronx, New York City, to Lillian (Weinstein) and Albert Balsam, a manufacturer of women's sportswear. He was the first-born child. His father was a Russian Jewish immigrant, and his mother was born in New York, to Russian Jewish parents. Martin caught the acting bug in high school where he participated in the drama club. After high school, he continued his interest in acting by attending Manhattan's progressive New School. When World War II broke out, Martin was called to service in his early twenties. After the war, he was lucky to secure a position as an usher at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. By 1947, he was honing his craft at the Actors Studio, run at that time by Elia Kazan and Lee Strasberg. His time at the Actors Studio in New York City allowed him training in the famous Stanislavsky method. Despite his excellent training, he had to prove himself, just like any up and coming young actor. He began on Broadway in the late 1940s. But, it was not until 1951 that he experienced real success. That play was Tennessee Williams' \"The Rose Tattoo\". After his Broadway success, he had a few minor television roles before his big break arrived when he joined the cast of Fronte del porto (1954). In the 1950s, Martin had many television roles. He had recurring roles on some of the most popular television series of that time, including The United States Steel Hour (1953), The Philco Television Playhouse (1948), Goodyear Television Playhouse (1951) and Studio One (1948). In 1957, he was able to prove himself on the big-screen once again, with a prominent role in La parola ai giurati (1957), directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Henry Fonda. All of Martin's television work in the 1950s did not go to waste. While starring on an episode of Alfred Hitchcock presenta (1955), Hitchcock was so impressed by his work, that he offered him a key supporting role of Detective Milton Arbogast in Psyco (1960). His work with Hitchcock opened him up to a world of other acting opportunities. Many strong movie roles came his way in the 1960s, including parts in Colazione da Tiffany (1961), Il promontorio della paura (1962) and L'uomo che non sapeva amare (1964). One of the proudest moments in his life was when he received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for L'incredibile Murray (1965). It was soon after that he began accepting roles in European movies. He soon developed a love for Italy, and lived there most of his remaining years. He acted in over a dozen Italian movies and spent his later life traveling between Hollywood and Europe for his many roles. After a career that spanned more than fifty years, Martin Balsam died of natural causes in his beloved Italy at age 76. He passed away of a stroke at a hotel in Rome called Residenza di Repetta. He was survived by his third wife Irene Miller and three children, Adam, Zoe and Talia.\n\nEnigmatic, dark-haired foreign import Alida Valli was dubbed \"The Next Garbo\" but didn't live up to postwar expectations despite her cool, patrician beauty, remote allure and significant talent. Born in Pola, Italy (now Croatia), on May 3, 1921, the daughter of a Tridentine journalist and professor and an Istrian homemaker, she studied dramatics as a teen at the Motion Picture Academy of Rome and Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia before snaring bit roles in such films as Il cappello a tre punte (1935) [\"The Three-Cornered Hat\"] and I due sergenti (1936) [\"The Two Sergeants\"]. She made a name for herself in Italy during WWII playing the title role in Manon Lescaut (1940), won a Venice Film Festival award for Piccolo mondo antico (1941) [\"Little Old World\"] and was a critical sensation in Noi vivi (1942) [\"We the Living\"]. She briefly abandoned her career, however, in 1943, refusing to appear in what she considered fascist propaganda, and was forced into hiding. The next year she married surrealist painter/pianist/composer Oscar De Mejo. They had two children, and one of them, Carlo De Mejo, became an actor. She divorced in 1955, then she came back to Italy,\n\nFollowing her potent, award-winning work in the title role of Eugenia Grandet (1946), she was discovered and contracted by David O. Selznick to play the murder suspect Maddalena Paradine in Alfred Hitchcock's Il caso Paradine (1947). She was billed during her Hollywood years simply as \"Valli,\" and Selznick also gave her top femme female billing in Carol Reed's classic film noir Il terzo uomo (1949), but for every successful film--such as the ones previously mentioned--she experienced such failures as Il miracolo delle campane (1948), and audiences stayed away. In 1951 she bid farewell to Hollywood and returned to her beloved Italy. In Europe again, she was sought after by the best directors. Her countess in Luchino Visconti's Senso (1954) was widely heralded, and she moved easily from ingénue to vivid character roles. Later standout films encompassed costume dramas as well as shockers and had her playing everything from baronesses to grandmothers in such films as Occhi senza volto (1960) [\"Eyes Without a Face\"], Il gigolò (1960), Edipo Re (1967) [\"Oedipus Rex\"], Tendre Dracula (1974), Novecento (1976), Suspiria (1977), La luna (1979), Inferno (1980), Aspern (1982), Un mese al lago (1995) and, her most recent, Semana Santa (2001).\n\nMarthe Keller was born on January 28, 1945 in Basel, Switzerland. She studied ballet as a child but stopped after a skiing accident at age 16. She changed to acting, and worked in Berlin at the Schiller Theatre and the Berliner Ensemble.\n\nKeller's earliest film appearances were in Funerale a Berlino (1966) (uncredited) and the German film Wilder Reiter GmbH (1967). She appeared in a series of French films in the 1970s, including Un cave (1972), Chi è più matto ha ragione (1973) and Tutta una vita (1974). Her most famous American film appearances are her Golden Globe-nominated performance as Dustin Hoffman's girlfriend in Il maratoneta (1976) and her performance as an Arab terrorist who leads an attack on the Super Bowl in Black Sunday (1977). Keller also acted with William Holden in Billy Wilder's romance drama Fedora (1978). She appeared alongside Al Pacino in the auto racing film Un attimo una vita (1977). Her later films included Oci ciornie (1987), with Marcello Mastroianni.\n\nKeller has appeared in Europe and America in plays, directed opera and as a speaker on classical music in the last twenty years. For example, in 2001, Keller appeared in a Broadway adaptation of Abby Mann's play \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" as Mrs. Bertholt (the role played by Marlene Dietrich in the 1961 Stanley Kramer film version). She was nominated for a Tony Award as Best Featured Actress for this performance.\n\nIn addition to her work in film and theatre, Keller has developed a career in classical music as a speaker and opera director. She has performed the speaking role of Joan of Arc in the oratorio \"Jeanne d'Arc au Bûcher of Arthur Honegger\" on several occasions, with conductors such as Seiji Ozawa and Kurt Masur. She has recorded the role for Deutsche Grammophon with Ozawa (DG 429 412-2). Keller has also recited the spoken role in Igor Stravinsky's \"Perséphone\". She has performed classical music melodramas for speaker and piano in recital. The Swiss composer Michael Jarrell wrote the melodrama \"Cassandre\", after the novel of Christa Wolf, for Keller, who gave the world premiere in 1994.\n\nKeller's first production as an opera director was \"Dialogues des Carmélites\", for Opéra National du Rhin, in 1999. This production subsequently received a semi-staged performance in London that year. She has also directed \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" for the Washington National Opera and for the Los Angeles Opera. Her directorial debut at the Metropolitan Opera was in a 2004 production of \"Don Giovanni\". Keller has one son, Alexandre de Broca, from her relationship with director Philippe de Broca.\n\nHe grew up in middle-class circumstances with two sisters. Before his hometown was 90 percent destroyed by air raids, his parents brought him to Quedlinburg. After the war, Didi Hallervorden returned to Dessau, where he completed primary school as one of the best in the district. The SED leadership still did not want to allow Hallervorden to attend a high school. His father then fought successfully for months to get his son transferred. Hallervorden graduated from high school at the age of 17. He then studied Romance languages at East Berlin's Humboldt University and showed tourists around as an interpreter. Since he did not adhere to the guidelines of the \"workers' and farmers' state\" in this work, he got into trouble with the authorities, which led him to flee to West Berlin in 1958.\n\nAt the Free University of Berlin, Hallervorden continued his studies in Romance studies, journalism and theater studies. He soon turned his hobby, theater, into a career by securing a training position with Marlise Ludwig at what was then the most renowned private school in Berlin. Hallervorden often played theater, dropped out of his studies and founded the political-satirical cabaret \"Die Wühlmäuse\" with colleagues in West Berlin. Hallervorden is still the director of the cabaret today. He wrote around two dozen programs, toured Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Denmark many times and soon received offers from radio and television stations. But Hallervorden also got into trouble and was banned from appearing at all stations for five years because of censorship violations. Afterwards he achieved many successes again.\n\nHis programs and appearances on WDR, for example in \"Strange Encounter\", \"Millionaire Game\", \"Springteufel\", \"Abramakabra\", \"Grand Gala\" and \"Lästerlexikon\" made him a star. He moved to SDR, where he produced \"Nonstop Nonsens\" and had his greatest success on television. In 1981 he received the media award \"Bambi\" for \"Nonstop Nonsens\". Hallervorden released numerous long-playing records, over 30 singles and ten films, the most successful of which include \"Alles im Bucket\" (1981), \"Didi, the Doppelgänger\" (1984) and \"Didi, the Expert\" (1988). In addition, there were ten episodes of the \"Didi\" show and the founding of his company \"Halliwood\", with which he produced the \"Spottschau\". From his first marriage to his long-time stage partner Rotraud Schindler, Hallervorden became the father of Dieter (1963) and Nathalie (1966). He also has another daughter, who was born in 1986. His second marriage is to Elena Blume, who gave birth to their son Johannes in 1998. Dieter Hallervorden lived alternately in Berlin and Trégastel, France, on an idyllic private island.\n\nFrom 1994, Hallervorden worked for ARD again and brought out his political-satirical series \"Spott-Light\", which became a long-lasting success and ran until the new millennium. For moderation of the session \"Do you understand fun?\" Hallervorden received the \"telestar\" in 1996. On March 4, 2000, ARD showed a \"Spott-Light Special\" in honor of the 40th anniversary of the cabaret \"Die Wühlmäuse\". Hallervorden's next TV project was called \"Zebralla\" (2000/01), a grotesque family series. In January 2004, Hallervorden was awarded the honorary prize of the \"German Comedy Prize\". In 2005 he was awarded the honorary award of the \"Bavarian Cabaret Prize\". In November 2005 he published his autobiography under the title \"Whoever tries to smile... An autobiographical look back to the future\". In 2006 Hallervorden was made an honorary citizen of the city of Dessau. In 2012, he played a child molester in the thriller \"The Child.\" In 2013 he starred in the film drama \"His Last Race\". In 2014 he portrayed a man suffering from Alzheimer's in \"Honey in the Head\".\n\nBritt Ekland was born in Sweden and grew up to be the poster girl for beautiful, big-eyed Scandinavian blondes. She attended a drama school and then joined a traveling theater group. With her looks as her passport, Britt entered films and became a star in Italy. When Peter Sellers met her in a hotel, he fell hard for her and they soon married. The combination of Sellers' stardom and her stunning beauty contributed to her fame (the fact that Sellers suffered a heart attack in bed on their wedding night did not hurt, either). She appeared in several films with her husband, including Caccia alla volpe (1966), written by Neil Simon, and the forgettable Il magnifico Bobo (1967). Her claim to fame would come as the young girl who invented the striptease in Quella notte inventarono lo spogliarello (1968). After that, she appeared in a string of movies that were built around her looks and not much else. She did appear in some first-rate productions over the years, though, two of them being Carter (1971) and the cult classic The Wicker Man (1973). The high point in her career would be her role as Bond girl Mary Goodnight in Agente 007 - L'uomo dalla pistola d'oro (1974). After her much publicized breakup with rocker Rod Stewart in 1977, Britt continued to make movies--both features and made-for-TV films--and tried the stage. By that time, the quality of her film projects had decreased markedly, and she was reduced to appearing in things like Dal college con furore (1985) and Beverly Hills Vamp (1989).\n\nBritish actor Edward Woodward made a highly successful transition into Hollywood TV stardom in the mid 1980s thanks to a popular dramatic series. Possessing a magnetic, yet coldly handsome demeanor in the same mold as Christopher Plummer, he was born Edward Albert Arthur Woodward on June 1, 1930, in London and received his early education at various schools before becoming a student at Commercial College.\n\nTrained in acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), Woodward made his stage debut in a 1946 production of \"A Kiss for Cinderella,\" and gained valuable experience in repertory companies throughout England and Scotland. He took his first London curtain call portraying \"Ralph Stokes\" in 1954 with \"Where There's a Will,\" and subsequently made his movie debut recreating his stage part in the film version of Where There's a Will (1955). The actor continued grandly on stage in such Shakespearean productions as \"Hamlet\" (Laertes),\" \"Romeo and Juliet\" (Mercutio), \"Pericles\" (Thaliard), \"Much Ado About Nothing\" (Claudio), and \"Measure for Measure\" (Lucio), but scored a major success portraying Percy in \"Rattle of a Simple Man\" in 1961, making his Broadway debut in the play two years later. Woodward would make fine use of his mastery of the spoken word by putting out a host of audio books.\n\nA gifted singer who produced over a dozen musical recordings, Edward displayed his excellent singing pipes on Broadway as Charles Condomine in \"High Spirits\" (1963), the musical adaptation of Noël Coward's \"Blithe Spirit,\" that also starred Tammy Grimes, Louise Troy and the legendary Beatrice Lillie. He also went on to win the Variety Award (\"Best Performance in a Musical\") for his lead role of Sydney Carton in a musical version of the Dickens classic \"Two Cities.\" Other non-musical stage work would include the comedy \"The Best Laid Plans,\" an acclaimed title role in \"Cyrano de Bergerac,\" as well as noble appearances in \"The White Devil,\" \"Babes in the Wood\" (as Robin Hood), \"The Wolf,\" \"The Male of the Species,\" \"The Beggar's Opera\" (as Macheath), \"Private Lives\" and \"The Dead Secret.\"\n\nAlthough in movies from 1955, it was TV that earned him his initial star in England. Feature film roles in such acclaimed period costumers as Becket e il suo re (1964) and Gli anni dell'avventura (1972) were overshadowed by his more successful work on the smaller screen, especially his weary spy in the popular series Callan (1967). A brilliant performance in the film The Wicker Man (1973) and in a few others led to international stardom as court-martialed Lt. Harry Morant in the classic Aussie-made historical drama Esecuzione di un eroe (1980) directed by Bruce Beresford.\n\nWoodward was finally granted some attention in the States at age 55, earning his own popular series, the noirish espionage series Un giustiziere a New York (1985). Served up best in crime, historical and political intrigue, he has been completely at home playing no-nonsense authoritarians and brooding loner types. Following the series' cancellation, he returned to British TV with the mystery In Suspicious Circumstances (1991), but was never far away from the US shores. Maturing roles in advancing years included a wide range of characters -- everything from Merlin to the Ghost of Christmas Present in mini-movie formats.\n\nWoodward continued to work here and abroad up until his death. Later feature films included a top-billed role in the horror film The Appointment (1982); a top brass role in the action thriller Chi osa vince (1982); a featured role in the horse-racing biopic Champions (1984); as King Saul in the biblical story King David (1985); another Bruce Beresford directed film with Mister Johnson (1990); the ghost of a murderer in the black comedy Deadly Advice (1994); the 18th century patriarch of The House of Angelo (1997), which he produced and also featured his three children; a lord in the action adventure The Abduction Club (2002); a featured part in the comedy action Hot Fuzz (2007) and, his last, a reverend in the drama A Congregation of Ghosts (2009). TV appearances included recurring/regular roles in the British series: Nice Work (1980), Five Days (2007) and EastEnders (1985); plus the American series Over My Dead Body (1990) and the Canadian series Nikita (1997).\n\nWoodward married actress Venetia Barrett (nee Collett) in 1952 and had three children, all of whom went into acting: Tim Woodward, Peter Woodward and Sarah Woodward. After his tabloid divorce (after over 30 years) from his first wife, he quickly married lovely actress Michele Dotrice in 1987, the sister of former 1960s' Disney child star Karen Dotrice of Mary Poppins (1964) fame. He and Michele produced one child, Emily. The subject of This Is Your Life (1955) on two separate occasions, the actor survived two major heart attacks before dying of pneumonia at age 79 on November 16, 2009, in Cornwall, England.\n\nHenry Silva was born on September 23, 1926 in Brooklyn, New York. He quit public school to attend drama classes at age 13, supporting himself as a dishwasher in a Manhattan hotel. By 1955, Silva had moved up from dishwasher to waiter, and felt ready to audition for the Actors Studio. He was one of five students chosen out of more than 2500 applicants. When the Actors Studio staged Michael V. Gazzo's play \"A Hatful of Rain\" as a classroom project, it proved so successful it came to Broadway--with students Ben Gazzara, Shelley Winters, Harry Guardino, Anthony Franciosa and, of course, Silva in key roles. Called to Hollywood, he played a succession of heavies in films, including Bravados (1958), Verdi dimore (1959), Colpo grosso (1960), Va' e uccidi (1962) and Johnny Coll, messaggero di morte (1963).\n\nAn Italian producer made Henry an offer he could not refuse--to star as a hero for a change--and he moved his family overseas. Silva's turning-point picture was a spaghetti Western, Un fiume di dollari (1966), which made him a hot box office commodity in Spain, Italy, Germany and France. His popularity was enhanced by a gift for languages. He speaks Italian and Spanish fluently and has a flair for the kind of gritty, realistic roles that also catapulted Charles Bronson to European stardom. Returning to the United States, he co-starred with Frank Sinatra in the film Contract on Cherry Street (1977), then signed on as Buck Rogers' evil adversary Kane in Capitan Rogers nel 25° secolo (1979) and the television series of the same name. Silva now calls the San Fernando Valley home, but makes continual film forays back to Europe's production centers. A dedicated jogger, he puts in five miles a day \"to keep in shape and relieve tension\".\n\nMario Adorf, a tell-tale name indeed. Mario calls to mind the actor's Italian roots (his father was a Calabrian surgeon) whereas Adorf reveals his German origins (his mother was a radiologist from the German region Eifel). As for the full name Mario Adorf it echoes to perfection the international character of this living legend's long career. Born in 1930, Mario Adorf was still studying drama at the famous Otto Falkenberg School in Munich when he landed his first role in the first installment of the \"O8/15\" series in 1954. It was a small part but it didn't go unnoticed and got him new roles in German films, the most remarkable of which being that of Bruno Lüdke, the mentally retarded serial killer in Robert Siodmak's 1957 masterpiece \"Nachts, wenn der Teufel kam\". It earned him his first prize (the German Film Award of the outstanding young actor of 1958). After this Mario Adorf's career turned international. His Mediterranean looks, his rugged face, his dark oily frizzy hair and his volubility made him an ideal villain in European-made westerns, spy or mafia films. These flicks - made in the 1960s - were mostly just commercial and Adorf hammed his parts but he did it so brilliantly that he alone made them watchable. From the 1970s on, the quality of his films improved and Adorf could lend his remarkable acting talents to more ambitious works such as \"Il Delitto Matteotti\", in which he was a striking Mussolini, or \"Die Blechtrommel\", where he was terrifying as a boorish grocer contaminated by Nazism. The list of great directors he worked with is impressive: Robert Siodmak, Volker Schlöndorff, Wolgang Staudte, Michel Deville, Dino Risi, Mikhaïl Kalatozov, Luigi Comencini, Peter Fleischmann, Billy Wilder, John Frankenheimer, Claude Chabrol, Fassbinder... Likewise he served many a great author, either in the theatre (Shakespeare, Tennessee Williams, Richard Nash) or the big or small screen (Grass, Böll, Schnitzler, Heny Miller, Joseph Conrad, Gorky, Patrick Süskind...). He also sang and wrote books (five novels and one memoir). Hyperactive for more than fifty-five years now, Mario Adorf, still in fine form at the age of seventy-eight, is still ... hyperactive!"
