        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: British filmmaker Paul Raschid has added veteran Italian filmmaker Dario Argento (Suspiria, Inferno, Deep Red) and actor Franco Nero (Django Unchained, The Pope’s Exorcist, John Wick) to his latest interactive project The Run.\n\nRaschid directs from a screenplay he also wrote. The film is described as a “horror-thriller”. The interactive element will involve the viewer being asked to make high-stakes decisions for the protagonist at various points throughout the story that will affect the direction of the narrative and in some cases, result in early death.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\n'Dario Argento Panico,' Documentary Retrospective On Iconic Giallo Filmmaker, Acquired By Shudder\n\n'The Pope's Exorcist' Review: A Terrific Russell Crowe Battles Demons In Movie Possessed By The Memory Of A Certain 50-Year-Old Horror Classic\n\nMarket In Focus: MIA's Popular Co-Production Forum Set To Welcome Pitches From Dario Argento & Wim Wenders' Niece\n\nThe project is currently shooting in Northern Italy. The story is set on a remote running trail, where a famous fitness influencer’s morning run becomes a race for survival when she is hunted by seemingly motiveless killers. She meets local farmer Matteo along the way and the viewer’s choices determine whether they live or die.\n\nAlso starring are Roxanne McKee (Game of Thrones, Hercules, Strike Back) and George Blagden (Vikings, Black Mirror, Versailles). Rounding out the cast are Fabio Testi (Once a Time in the West, Letters to Juliet) Jamie Ward (His Dark Materials, Tyrant) Jemma Donovan (Neighbours, Spotless), and Katia Ricciarelli (Un Passo Dal Cielo, Come una Madre).\n\nArgento is best known as the master of Giallo horror, with credits including Suspiria, Deep Red, and Phenomena. Nero is an Italian screen legend. His breakout role came in the 1966 Spaghetti Western film Django.\n\nThe Run is a Benacus Entertainment production in association with RNF Productions. Raschid’s previous interactive features include The Gallery, a hostage-thriller also starring Blagden, and the interactive rom-com Five Dates.\n\nBenacus Entertainment and RNF Productions are production and production service companies based in Atlanta, Georgia. Their credits include Double Down South, St Agatha, Walden, and Degenerate.\n\nBest of Deadline\n\nTV Cancellations Photo Gallery: Series Ending In 2024 & Beyond\n\n2024 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming\n\nHow To Watch The 2024 Tony Awards Ceremony & Preshow"
