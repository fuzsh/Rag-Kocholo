        "text": "Dead Michele Kalamera, the great \"earning\" voice actor of Clint Eastwood\n\nIn 1976 he had been chosen by the same actor and director from \"The Outlaw Josey Wales.\" “He said he had finally found his Italian voice”\n\nla Republica\n\nBy the Spettacoli editorial staff\n\nJuly 26, 2023\n\n\"I was chosen by Clint Eastwood himself, after he saw my audition for \"The Outlaw Josey Wales,\" it was 1976, he enthusiastically said that he had finally found his Italian voice, and I have never left him since\". So said Michele Kalamera, actor and voice actor of long experience who died yesterday, Tuesday 25 July, at the age of 84.\n\nThe theater with Projects\n\nMichelino Calamera, better known as Michele Kalamera (the Greek surname had been Italianized during Fascism) was born in Conegliano, in the province of Treviso, on February 12, 1939. Known in particular as a dubber, he was also a stage actor: in 1963 he founded, together with Gigi Proietti, the permanent theater of L'Aquila. He also worked in radio.\n\nThe debut as a voice actor\n\nIn 1966 he made his debut as a voice actor, directed by a historical figure of dubbing as Fede Arnaud in Mark Damon's film “God, How I Love You!”. But Kalamera's notoriety is linked in particular to Clint Eastwood, to whom he has given his voice in all the films since 1976, except for a parenthesis that goes from 1986 \"when they took him away for Gunny and I took him back in 1990 with “White Hunter Black Heart”.\n\nNot just Clint Eastwood\n\nDuring his long career, Kalamera has also made other great actors speak Italian, such as Steve Martin, Michael Caine, Robert Duvall, Donald Sutherland, Robert Redford, Roy Scheider, F. Murray Abraham, Christopher Plummer. And again: Burt Reynolds, Christopher Lee, Jack Palance, David Bowie, Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow and Anthony Hopkins. A total of over 5,000 film and TV stars, 5,000 co-stars, 5,000 key characters in TV series, countless cameos.\n\n\"I have always rejected labels such as teacher and the like - Kalamera said of himself - I consider myself a dubber, indeed, as I like to define myself: an earworm\".\n\nMichele Kalamera (Michelino Calamera)\n\nBorn: 2/12/1938, Conegliano, Venero, Treviso, Italy\n\nDied: 7/25/2023, Rome, Lazio, Italy\n\nMichele Kalamera’s westerns – voice actor:\n\nTwo RRRingos from Texas – 1967 [Italian voice of unknown actor]\n\nThe Way West - 1967 [Italian voice of Kirk Douglas]\n\nBeyond the Law – 1968 [Italian voice of Gordon Mitchell]\n\nShotgun – 1968 [Italian voice of Mimmo Palmara]\n\nSonora – 1968 [Italian voice of George Martin]\n\nZorro the Fox – 1968 [Italian voice of Giacomo Rossi Stuart]\n\nCemetery Without Crosses – 1969 [Italian voice of Robert Hossein]\n\nEl Puro – 1969 [Italian voice of Robert Woods]\n\nFour Came to Kill Sartana – 1969 [Italian voice of Benito Pacifico]\n\nGod Will Forgive My Pistol – 1969 [Italian voice Wayde Preston]\n\nHeaven With a Gun - 1969 [Italian voice of Glenn Ford]\n\nI Am Sartana, Your Angel of Death – 1969 [Italian voice of Gianni Garko]\n\nSartana and His Shadow of Death – 1969 [Italian voice of Benito Pacifico]\n\nTell Them Willie Boy is Here – 1969 [Italian voice of Robert Redford]\n\nTrue Grit – 1969 [Italian voice of Robert Duvall]\n\nThe Wild Bunch – 1969 [Italian voice of Robert Ryan]\n\nZorro the Lawman – 1969 [Italian voice of Fabio Testi]\n\nApocalypse Joe – 1970 [Italian voice of Anthony Steffen]\n\nBallad of Death Valley – 1970 [Italian voice of William Berger]\n\nCatlow – 1971 [Italian voice of Richard Crenna]\n\nDead Men Ride – 1971 [Italian voice of Fabio Testi]\n\nVengeance Trail – 1971 [Italian voice of Ivan Rassimov]\n\nTrinity and Sartana are Coming – 1972 [Italian voice of Harry Baird]\n\nFasthand is Still My Name – 1973 [Italian voice of Sergio Ciani]\n\nHere We Go Again, Eh Providence – 1973 [Italian voice of Manuel Gallardo]\n\nThe Grand Duel – 1973 [Italian voice of Horst Frank]\n\nWhite Fang – 1973 [Italian voice of John Steiner]\n\nBlood River – 1974 [Italian voice of Fabio Testi]\n\nChallenge to White Fang – 1974 [Italian voice of John Steiner]\n\nThe Four of the Apocalypse – 1975 [Italian voice of Fabio Testi]\n\nRed Coat – 1975 [Italian voice of Fabio Testi]\n\nReturn of Shanghai Joe – 1975 [Italian voice of Klaus Kinski]\n\nWhite Fang to the Rescue – 1975 [Italian voice of Henry Silva]\n\nThe Outlaw Josey Wales – 1976 [Italian voice of Clint Eastwood]\n\nChina 9, Liberty 37 – 1978 [Italian voice of Fabio Testi]\n\nBronco Billy – 1980 [Italian voice of Clint Eastwood]\n\nYoung Guns II – 1990 [Italian voice of James Coburn]\n\nThe Last of the Mohicans – 1992 [Italian voice of Russell Means, Maurice Roeves]\n\nUnforgiven – 1992 [Italian voice of Clint Eastwood]\n\nThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn – 1993 [Italian voice of Ron Perlman]\n\nDavy Crockett (TV) – 1994 [Italian voice of Sheriff Carson]\n\nAnd Starring Pancho Villa as Himself (TV) - 2003 [Italian voice of Alan Arkin\n\nThe Three Amigos – 2003 [Italian voice of Chevy Chase]\n\nDeadwood (TV) – 2004 [Italian voice of Keith Carradine]\n\nThe Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford – 2007 [Italian voice of James\n\nCarville]\n\nThe Salvation – 2014 [Italian voice of Danny Keough]"
