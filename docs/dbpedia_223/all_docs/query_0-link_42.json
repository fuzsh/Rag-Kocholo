        "text": "In accounts of Rome's “Golden Age of the Renaissance,” the Sienese banker Agostino Chigi (1466-1520) has never quite faded from notoriety. His proverbial wealth and flamboyant personality survive in scattered anecdotes as a glittering sideshow to the grander enterprises of Julius II, Leo X, Raphael, and Michelangelo. Indisputably the richest man in Rome between 1500 and 1520, he is best known today for three artistic commissions connected with Raphael: a chapel in Santa Maria della Pace, his mortuary chapel in Santa Maria del Popolo, and the suburban villa known since 1579 as the Farnesina.\n\n2 Gilbert, The Pope; Partner, Peter, “The ‘Budget’ of the Roman Church in the Renaissance Period,” in E.

Chigi a.I.I. These biographies, written by Fabio Chigi, the eventual Pope Alexander VII, in 1618 and revised for the rest of his life, include a life of Agostino Chigi which is published by Cugnoni as a book, Agostino Chigi II Magnifico (Rome, 1878), and also seriatim in the Archivio delta R.

The present author's annotated edition of Chigi's correspondence is forthcoming in the Studi e Testi series of the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana.\n\n11 The exact nature of Chigi's intelligence is well captured by Sigismondo Tizio's phrase “virum naturali ratione pollentem,” B.A.V., cod. Chigi G.II.38, fol. 246. Tizio earlier describes Agostino as “vir ingenii sagacissimi,” B.A.V., cod. Chigi G.II.37, fol. 112. For such a mordant observer of his fellow man as Tizio, it is highly significant that he single out this particular trait in describing a man with whom he almost certainly must have come into contact; Tizio is notoriously stingy about dispensing compliments. For the lacunae in Chigi's education, see Rowland, “Some Panegyrics.“\n\n15 That these purchases were a concerted effort is shown by Chigi's own correspondence, particularly the letter of 30 January 1501: B.A.V., cod. Chigi R.V.c, fols. 33-34. Two of the relevant contracts are found in ASR, Ospedale di S. Rocco, Busta 109, Documents #3 (copy in the hand of Giulio Spannocchi of the Tolfa contract from 25 January 1501), #7 (copy of the contract withjacopo Sannazzaro for the alum mines of Agnano, 9 May 1501). Another copy of the Agnano contract can be found in the Archivio de Stato di Siena (hereafter ASS), Particolari Famiglie Senesi, Spannocchi A/I, Document #44, 9 May 1501. Agostino's original contract of 1501 for the alum fields of Massa Marittima, in Sienese territory, is mentioned in ASS, Particolari Famiglie Senesi 67 bis (Fondi), Document #4, c. Iv; see also ASS, Giudice ordinario 5, Document #47. Jacopo Appiani, the ruler of Piombino, site of another alum field, was highly dependent on Siena's dictator Pandolfo Petrucci, with whom Chigi maintained extremely close contact.\n\n17 For Chigi's alum monopoly see Gilbert, , The Pope, passim, and esp. pp. 70–85 Google Scholar; Zippel, “L'allume di Tolfa“; Montenovesi, “Agostino Chigi“; Morandi, “Gli Spannocchi“; Delumeau, L’ alun romain, pp. 97-105; Barbieri, Gino, Industria e politica mineraria nello Stato Pontificio dal ‘400 al ‘600: lineamenti (Rome, 1940), pp. 112—61Google Scholar (but be aware of the author's Fascist bias). The Sienese Vannoccio Biringucci devoted a chapter of his Della Pirotecnia (II. 6) to “l'allume di roccha“; not only was this colorful character armorer and fireworks-maker to the Petrucci family, but he also worked for Agostino Chigi in Tolfa and in Porto Ercole, there acquiring his firsthand experience of the industrial processes used by Chigi. His treatise, first published in Venice in 1540, enjoyed several editions in the mid-sixteenth century.\n\n19 Chigi's income was conventionally estimated at seventy thousand ducats per annum; so Sigismondo Tizio, B.A.V., cod. Chigi G.II.38, fol. 246r-v. Marin Sanudo's diary reported his capital at one hundred thousand ducats on 21 February 1511, I diarii di Marino Sanuto (58 vols., Venice 1879-1903), XI (Venice, 1890), cols. 834-35. Delumeau, L’alun romain, p. 105, believes that estimates of Chigi's income are exaggerated. On the other hand, Fabio Chigi's story that because his assets were so extensive, Agostino professed not to know his own worth (Cugnoni, p. 17) sounds absolutely true-tolife— the more so for its element of bold-faced mendacity. Given the fact that Chigi died with nine hundred thousand ducats’ worth of valuables sequestered in the strongroom of his Villa Suburbana, B.A.V., Archivio Chigi 11450, fols. 456, 463v, Delumeau's scepticism about the banker's actual wealth may be somewhat misplaced.\n\n43 That there were theatrical entertainments at the Viridario is clear from Egidio Gallo's description of the building in De Viridario Augustini Chigii Patritii Senen[sis] Vera Libellus (Rome: Guilleret and Nani, 1511), cited with analysis by Frommel, Die Farnesina, pp. 36-37. Of all Chigi's learned flatterers, Gallo was the most likely to appreciate this aspect of his patron's new home; the humanist was also an accomplished actor, and had earlier dedicated a volume of Neo-Plautine comedies to Chigi: Comoediae, published by Besicken in Rome in 1505. This latter book is extraordinarily rare; I know of only two copies, one in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, and the other in the Biblioteca Universitaria, Bologna.\n\n44 The order of rooms in a suburban villa is given by Vitruvius VI. 5 and is observable in such ancient examples as the Villa of the Mysteries in Pompeii. In contrast to the walled façade of an urban dwelling, which then leads directly to the main part of the house, the suburban villa has a garden peristyle as its entrance; interior and exterior forms are exchanged. Alberti, De Re Aedificatoria IX. 2, also describes the type; see Frommel, Die Farnesina, pp. 111, 117. Chigi's house, too, is entered through garden loggia enclosed within projecting wings rather than through a flat palazzo facade.\n\n47 Frommel, Die Farnesina, pp. 47-48, 51-52. For documents drawn up in the Viridario, see, inter alia, B.A.V., cod. Chigi R.V.e, I, fol. 667; B.A.V., Archivio Chigi 11453, fol. 312; cf. fols. 293v, 294v, etc. A “talamo” located “in palatio transtiberino” contained valuables worth nine hundred thousand gold ducats at the time of Chigi's death, as reported in a record of questions used for interrogating witnesses in a litigation between Lorenzo Leone Chigi, Agostino's son, and Marcantonio Colonna in 1526: “Item [interrogetur testis] nonne verum est quod praefatus quondam Augustinus dum vixit semper et continue usque ad eius obitum habitus tentus et reputatus fuit pro ditissimo mercatore, et ditiori quam ullus alius tunc in partibus italiae presertim reperiretur prout in rei veritate erat et ita tunc temporis erat communis et publica vox et fama adeo ut fere loco proverbij qui volebat designare aliquas divitias allegaret augustinum chisium. Item nonne verum est quod tempore mortis sue prefatus quondam Augustinus fore infinitas divitias pecunias gemma vasa argentea ac etiam aurea statuas pretiosas suppellectile et multa bone mobilia ac etiam immobilia nee non quam plurima eredita exigentia etiam valorem quingentorum milium ducatorum exedentia ac bancum seu rationem sub eius nomine contante tarn in urbe quam in civitate neapolitana et diversis alijs locis reliquit et inter alia Veritas fuit et sic erat communis vox et publica fama, quod in palatio transtiberino in quo discesset inter pecunias gemmas vasa argentea et alia pretiosa iocalia clausa in uno talamo reliquit valorem novem centum milium ducatoirum auri.” B.A.V., Archivio Chigi 11450, fol. 456r-v; cf, with a few alterations, fols. 463v, 466.\n\n51 Dante, “Chigi,” p. 735, and Cugnoni, p. 66n.51, give as the reason for Chigi's adoption his helping Julius II to purchase a Sienese villa known as La Suvera. Their reasoning is based on Tizio, cod. Chigi G.II.37, fols. 47-52, which connects the two events. However, the Suvera transaction is actually a neat way of smoothing over a thorny diplomatic problem: in his eagerness to curry favor with the Genoese Pope, an overly enthusiastic Sienese humanist had succeeded only in making a nuisance of himself at the Apostolic Court but had managed to stir up great interest at home in his “discovery” that Julius was the long-lost scion of a prominent Sienese family. The Pope, closely dependent on Chigi and also interested in making overtures to Siena's ruler, Pandolfo Petrucci, needed to find a way to accept some of the Sienese flatteries without compromising his sense of dignity. Chigi's maneuverings with La Suvera provided just such an avenue; thus the papal adoption, if indeed it is made in gratitude for this event, honors not so much Julius’ delight in his new villa, but his appreciation of Agostino Chigi's diplomatic gifts. The fact that Sigismondo Chigi is included in the adoption suggests that papal relations with Siena may have been a dominant element in the proceeding, for another brother, Francesco Chigi, firmly ensconced in Viterbo, was not mentioned in the papal bull: B.A.V., Archivio Chigi, 3666, Document #3, with a seventeenth-century copy in B. A. V., Archivio Chigi 11446, fols. 31-36.\n\n53 The Spannocchi adoption is reported in Morandi, “Gli Spannocchi,” p. 102; Gilbert, The Pope, p. 141n. 71, states that “it seems … most likely that competition with the Spannocchi was an important motive in Chigi's actions.” Even so, the weight which Chigi gave to his adoption suggests that it was more strongly motivated by the immediate circumstances of his relationship with Julius. Fabio Chigi reports that the brothers were adopted “anno MDVI“: Cugnoni, p. 22; cf. B.A.V., cod. Chigi R.V.e, III, fol. 217r-v: “I predetti due fratelli Sigismondo et Agostino aggiunsero all’ Arme loro gentilitia l’insignia della Quercia per dono di Papa Giulio Secondo che ancora gli adotto nella sua famiglia l'anno 1506.” The reason for the discrepancy is not entirely clear, for Fabio Chigi is on the whole a meticulous archivist, while as early as 1507 Agostino is probably planning to be buried in Santa Maria del Popolo, a church filled with the graves of Delia Rovere forebears.\n\n59 Agostino's love for raveggiolo, a kind of ricotta wrapped in ferns which is still a Sienese delicacy, was close to fanatical; in 1499, when Chigi followed Cesare Borgia south from France in a period of great danger, his most fervent concern is to obtain some “ravagiuli,” B.A.V., cod. Chigi R.V.c, fol. 31r-v. Virtually every letter in cod. R.V.c which is written during the autumn, when pears and raveggiolo are in season, mention these two items. Chigi also seems to have enjoyed marzipan, but never does his correspondence name any foodstuff more exotic.\n\n60 For the Augustan message of humanistic poems written for Chigi, see Rowland, “Some Panegyrics.” Borgia's poems, in B.A.V., cod. Barb. Lat. 1903, fols. 99v-100, are published without identification of author by Cugnoni, pp. 69-70, from a copy in B.A.V., cod. Chigi R.V.e, III, fol. 475r-v:\n\nAd Aug. Chisium\n\nDivitiae pariunt alijs Auguste nitorem:\n\nTu lumen, magnum divitijsque decus.\n\nNam quod regifico sumptu tarn ingentia Romae\n\nTecta novas: Ancos nomina prisca refers.\n\nQuod tot praestantes animas tot clara virorum\n\nIngenia hoc aevi fine perire vetas.\n\nOptima quaeque fovens mensis genialibus ultro:\n\nQuaejam sint regum munera vera doces.\n\nIn Idem (sc. palatio eiusdem)\n\nBarbaricis postquam furijs ruit inclyta Roma\n\nExcessere omnes urbe cadente dei.\n\nAst ubi regales Augustus Chisius aedes\n\nCondidit, antiquum restituitque decus:\n\nDique, deaeque simul coelo rediere: beatam\n\nUnam hanc certantes quisque fovere domum:\n\nDenique Liber, Amor, charites, venus aurea, pallas\n\nMutua iurarunt hunc habitare locum.\n\nFelix cuius amant dii tecta Auguste volentes:\n\nCertatimque homines ore favente colunt.\n\nI have emended the ms. reading “Diique” in line 5 of the second poem to read the more metrically correct “dique.” Translations of these and all subsequent poems have made an attempt to preserve in English rhythms the meters of the original Latin.\n\n62 Suetonius, Life of Augustus, 72: “neque laxitate neque cultu conspicuis, ut in quibus porticus breves essent Albenarum columnarum et sine marmore ullo aut insigni pavimento conclavia.” There is otherwise no attempt in the Villa Suburbana to imitate Suetonius’ description of Augustus’ house in the way that, for example, the wooden alcove of Federico di Montefeltro recently found in the Palazzo Ducale of Urbino seems to be based on Suetonius’ description of Augustus’ bedroom. It is also worth noting that the house of Augustus on the Palatine hill in Rome, the famous bedroom included, has now been substantially excavated, so that Suetonius’ testimony can be shown to be quite accurate: the house is of no exceptional size, and is not particularly skillfully decorated.\n\n66 For the notion of recreating ancient painting in the Renaissance, see Cast, David, The Calumny of Apelles: a Study of the Humanist Tradition (New Haven, 1981)Google Scholar. For Alexander and Roxane in particular, see Forster, “Die Hochzeit.” Sodoma's ability to emu late antique painting technique has not been remarked in print, but is particularly evident in his landscapes, especially that behind the Flagellation fresco now in the Pinacoteca Nazionale of Siena, and in the Alexander and Roxane fresco itself.\n\n79 Hirst, Michael, “The Chigi Chapel in Santa Maria della Pace,” JWCI, 24 (1961), 161-85Google Scholar, argues that this chapel was conceived as early as 1512. The bull which changes the dedication of the Chigi Chapel in Santa Maria del Popolo from Saints Sebastian, Roch, and Sigismund to the Virgin of Loreto, reflecting traditional della Rovere devotion to the Santa Casa, was issued by Julius on 3 December 1507: Cugnoni, pp. 75, 138-42 and n. 174; cf. Gilbert, , The Pope, p. 84 Google Scholar. The chapel itself was purchased in December 1507, B.A.V., cod. Chigi R.V.e, III, fol. 687: see n. 106 below.\n\n84 For Raphael's ability to articulate Julius’ aspirations, see Partridge and Starn, Renaissance Likeness. Specific connection of the Vatican Stanze with Egidio da Viterbo is made by Pfeiffer, Heinrich, S.J., Zur Ikonographie von Raffaels Disputa: Egidio da Viterbo und die christlich-platonische Konzeption der Stanza della Segnatura (Rome, 1975)Google Scholar; idem, “Die Predigt des Egidio da Viterbo über das goldene Zeitalter und die Stanza della Segnatura,” in Festschrift Luitpold Dussler (Munich and Berlin, 1972), pp. 237-54, following a suggestion made by Nelson Minnich in connection with his own work on the Fifth Lateran Council. The iconography of Raphael's School of Athens has been traced by the present author to Egidio's Sententiae ad mentem Platonis in two public lectures at the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1984 and 1986, with intent to publish these findings. Paul Watson, of the University of Pennsylvania, is turning his attentions to the Parnassus along similar lines.\n\n88 Not all his audience was so enthralled, however. Of his sermon in Siena on the coronation of Pope Pius III in 1505, Tizio reported in his text that it was: “etsi longum luculentem tamen“: B.A.V., cod. Chigi G.II.36, fol. 370v. A marginal note begs to differ: “Verum ita longum ut universum populum tedio afficeret atque fastidio ex tam rugidantici psalmi repetitione dum inquit fecit Lunam in tempore suo.” The same qualities in Egidio's rhetoric are recognized by O'Malley, John W., S.J., in “Fulfillment of the Christian Golden Age under Julius II: Text of a Discourse of Giles of Viterbo, 1507,” Traditio, 25 (1969), 265–338 CrossRefGoogle Scholar, at pp. 269, 277; cf. idem, Praise and Blame in Renaissance Rome: Rhetoric, Doctrine, and Reform in the Sacred Orators of the Papal Court, c. 1450- 1521 (Durham, N.C., 1979), pp. 27-28.\n\n91 See, for example, Martin, F. X., O.S.A., “Egidio da Viterbo, Martin Luther, and Girolamo Seripando,” Biblioteca e società, 4:1-2 (1982), 5–9 Google Scholar, at p. 5: ”… as prior general of the Augustinian order, 1506-1518 [Egidio] was the foremost exponent of the Observant ideals among the Augustinians. By his personal example, his fervid preaching, his visitation of so many Augustinian priories in Italy, his unrelenting programme for religious revival of his friars, his stream of reform letters to all provinces of the order, he galvanized the Augustinians to greater efforts of spiritual renewal“: cf. O'Malley, , Giles of Viterbo, pp. 139-78Google Scholar, “Reform in Concept and Practice“; cf. Vismara, Sandro, “Una grande figura religiosa del Rinascimento: Egidio da Viterbo,” Biblioteca e società, 4:1-2 (1982), 10–16 Google Scholar, at p. II.\n\n104 This cyclical motion is inherent in the Fourth Eclogue itself: “magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo” (5). The return of past ages comes about as a natural cycle. The experience of the divine child serves as an analogy to that of the humanistically educated Renaissance man: he reads about the past: “At simul heroum laudes et facta parentis / iam legere et quae sit poteris cognoscere virtus” (26-27). But the great deeds of the past are destined to be repeated (34-36). Wholly Christian is the notion that this return to the Golden Age is brought about by divine love for mankind and that it has a permanent redemptive significance, although Ovid in Metamorphoses xv.743-789 sees a lasting alteration of the world order under Augustus. For a classicist's analysis of the Fourth Eclogue and its concept of the Golden Age, see Putnam, Michael C. J., Virgil's Pastoral Art: Studies in the Eclogues (Princeton, 1970), pp. 136-75Google Scholar. I am grateful to Peter Meller for his insights into the Golden Age of Ovid.\n\n111 The photograph of lanother bronze relief, attributed to Lorenzetto and indeed to the Chigi Chapel itself, is found in the B. A. V. as Archivio Chigi 25294. This shows a putto with a downward-pointing torch, an appropriate funerary subject. From what a black-and-white photograph can reveal, the bronze appears to have been patinated in the same black tone as the relief still in the chapel.\n\n122 The fact that Albertini specifically mentions porphyry-colored stone rather than porphyry itself is archaeologically correct, as porphyry was barely introduced to Rome in the Augustan period; see Gnoli, Raniero, Marmora Romana (Rome, 1971), pp. 98–103 Google Scholar. This is all the more intriguing because from all available information, the Augusteum was revetted with travertine; Strabo III.9, 236, calls the monument leukolithos. The most recent excavation report by Guglielmo Gatti, “Nuove osservazioni,” discusses drawings made of the monument by Baldassare Peruzzi which seem to refer to the travertine blocks actually found in excavation in the twentieth century.\n\n128 Two Chigi forebears, Beato Giovanni and Venerabile Angela, were members of the Augustinian order, the former at the convent of Lecceto with which the Chigi family continued to have an association; see Buonafede, , I Chigi Augusti, pp. 120-52Google Scholar; Capisucchi, Raimondo, O.P., Vita B. Ioannis Chisii senensis Ordinis Erem. Sancti P. Augustini (Rome, 1656)Google Scholar, composed in verse for the newly elected Alexander VII. Schedoni, Giuseppe, Il Beato Giovanni e i venerabili Angelo Sigismondo e Aurelio Chigi: ricordi storici (Modena, 1881)Google Scholar, states that Beato Giovanni was the first to use the surname Chigi, changing from Giovanni di Chigio dei Conti dell’ Ardenghesca to a humble patronymic (pp. 4-5); he repeats uncritically other legends glorifying either Beato Giovanni's piety or the honor of the Chigi.\n\n135 For the Tolfa contract, see Gilbert, , The Pope, pp. 98 Google Scholar, 146-47 nn.11-12. Gilbert sees two reasons for Chigi's alteration of the contract: the change of Popes and his own social aspirations, and the increasingly threatening lawsuit leveled against him by the Spannocchi bank for their debacle of 1503, which was initiated in 1511. While recognizing that Bellanti was related to the Spannocchi, Gilbert does not mention that Agostino's sister Eufrasia was married to Bellanti until her death in 1496.\n\n145 The relationship between Virgil and Theocritus is discussed by Putnam, , Virgil's Pastoral Art, pp. 3–19 Google Scholar. The arguments for coupling Pindar and Horace in the Parnassus are summarized in Dussler, Luitpold, Raphael: A Critical Catalogue of his Pictures, Wall-Paintings, and Tapestries (London and New York, 1971), pp. 74–76 Google Scholar. The usual identification of the two right foreground figures as Pindar and Horace was first put forward by Bellori, Giovanni Pietro, Descrizione delle immagini da Raffaello d’ Urbino nelle camere del Palazzo Apostolico Vaticano (Rome, 1695), pp. 43ffGoogle Scholar. I am grateful to Jeanette Sargent for pointing out the literary connection between Horace and Pindar as givers of “advice to tyrants.“\n\n158 O'Malley, , Giles of Viterbo, pp. 30–32 Google Scholar, 123-25. Egidio had in fact intended to write a “De Disciplinis Etruscis“; O'Malley, “Fulfillment of the Christian Golden Age,” p. 272, citing cod. Angelica Lat. 502, fol. 23. These theories also appear in two long manuscript works, the Historia XXsaeculorum, cod. Angelica 351, and the Sententiae ad mentem Platonis, B.A. V., cod. Vat. Lat. 6325. See also O'Malley, “Man's Dignity, God's Love, and the Destiny of Rome: A Text of Giles of Viterbo,” Viator, 3 (1972), 389-96. Certainly Egidio's Etruscan lore had penetrated to Tizio's Siena; see Danielsson, O. A., Etruskische Inschriften in Handschriftlicher Überlieferung (Uppsala and Leipzig, 1928)Google Scholar, which treats Tizio's etruscological knowledge, esp. at pp. 34-51.\n\n166 References to Annio will be made using the copy of his Antiquities now in the Fondo Chigi of the B.A. V., a 1515 Petit, B. A. V. [Stampato] Chigi III.285. This copy is underlined in a sixteenth-century hand in places which have much to do with the analysis whose results are reported in the present paper, although the reason for the underlining is not clear, and the hands annotating the volume are several. In the eighteenth century the Biblioteca Chigi also possessed a 1498 Silber editio princeps of this work. Also notable is the 1498 edition owned by Egidio Antonini da Viterbo, copiously annotated in his hand: B.A.V., Incunabulum II. 274. For the importance of the Tiber as a boundary, see Annio, p. 153; cf a more elaborate discussion at p. 42. A modern treatment of the significance of the Tiber crossing is found in Holland, Louise Adams, Janus and the Bridge, Papers and Monographs of the American Academy in Rome, 21 (Rome, 1961)Google Scholar.\n\n169 For the origin of Viterbo, see Annio, p. 14: “Quod nunc Viterbum dicitur: olim regia tetrapolis Etruria dicbatur.” The etymology of “Viterbo” is given at pp. 24-25. The fact that there is a palpable shift in the location of Janus's kingdom has escaped modern commentators for the most part. The Vatican-based Janus legend is found at p. 13: “Cato item in fragmento ii Ex Scythia Ianum rate in Vaticanum“; cf. p. 42: “quamvis tunc finientis aurei saeculi: intra fines suos: sese quisque continuit: Ianus in Etruria et Saturnus in Latio; thyberimque fines imperii esse instituit. Intra enim suam cuique patriam tunc de more regnum finiebatur. Limes igitur erat inter eos thyberis: areae vero limitum erant Ianiculum et Saturnia Capitolina. Etruriam a Ianiculo Ianus: Latium a Saturno Saturnus cognominavit. Ad radices enim Capitolii Saturnus condiderat: uti Ianus Ianiculum“; and p. 140: “Pars Ianicula circa Thyberim primum dicta est italia ut Servius scribit super primum aeneidos.“\n\n175 The line echoed by Borgia is “Tuscus ego: tuscis orior,” Propertius IV. 2, line 3. This poem refers to Vertumnus, a god who by careful manipulation of his text Annio is able to assimilate both to Janus and to Noah, pp. 30-32v. Annio's text is collated by himself, and is done with a high degree of classical learning. It is also deftly doctored at three crucial points to further Annio's arguments; it is important to realize that in this particular case the Viterbese forger is able to construct an entire theory from the alteration of a mere five words in a classical text.\n\n184 Cicero, Ad Familiares, X.3. Hill, Corpus, p. 300, Plate 192, Fig. 1159 refer to the Chigi medallion. While stating that “The design of the reverse shows some trace of Florentine influence in the way that the arabesque ornament is arranged under the figure,” Hill makes no connection with the Leonine coins as a more overt possible example of Florentine influence. See also Liberati, Alfredo, Medaglie senesi (Sec. XlV-Sec. XIX): note storiche (Siena, 1903), p. 20 Google Scholar. Frittelli, Ugo, Albero genealogico delta nobil famiglia Chigi patrizia senese (Siena, 1922), p. 28 Google Scholar, says that the medallion is posthumous, citing Liberati, who in fact says nothing of the kind.\n\n188 About the loggia, see Förster, Richard, Famesina-Studien (Rostock, 1880), pp. 60–64 Google Scholar; Shearman, John, “Die Loggia der Psyche in der Villa Farnesina und die Probleme der letzten Phase von Raffaels graphischem Stil,” Jahrbuch der Kunsthistorischen Sammlungen in Wien, N. S. 60 (1964), 59–100 Google Scholar. it is quite likely that this choice of subjects has some basis in Neoplatonic concepts of the soul's ascent, which may be put into context when taken in tandem with the two Chigi chapels; however, these lofty concerns are also tempered by more ribald enjoyment of the ceiling's many nudes; see Schwarzenberg, Erkinger, “Raphael und die Psyche-Statue Agostino Chigis,” Jahrbuch der Kunsthistorischen Sammlungen in Wien, 73 (1977), 107-36Google Scholar, esp. p. 109, a reference to the obscene gourd painted by Giovanni da Udine in the Active bower of the loggia.\n\n190 Annio, pp. 138—139v; cf. p. 22v. Hercules traveled from Libya to Sardinia, and eventually settled in the Tuscan town of Vetulonia, where he was succeeded as king by his son Tuscus. Cicero, De Natura Deorum III. 42, already suspected that the number of exploits attributed to Hercules was greater than even the greatest of heroes could have done alone: hence he postulated a plurality of heroes by this name: cf. Servius on Aeneid VIII. 54; cf. Pease, Arthur Stanley, M. Tulli Ciceronis De Natura Deorum (Cambridge, Mass., 1955)Google Scholar, II, 1053. Hercules’ plurality is taken up by Salutati, Coluccio, De Laboribus Herculis, III. 1, ed. B. L. Ullmann (Zurich, 1951), pp. 164-68Google Scholar, and it is accepted by Annio."
