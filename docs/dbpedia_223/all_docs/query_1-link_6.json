        "text": "Born in Milan in 1933, Gian Maria Volontè studied in Rome at the National Dramatic Arts Academy, where he obtained his degree in 1957. He began working in theatre and television, where he was soon noticed as one of the most promising actors of his generation. After several supporting appearances in film, he reached notoriety with the character of Ramón Rojo in Sergio Leone's Für eine Handvoll Dollar (1964). This success was doubled in Leone's next film, Für ein paar Dollar mehr (1965). The following ten years would be the most intense of Volontè career. Die unglaublichen Abenteuer des hochwohllöblichen Ritters Branca Leone (1966) (directed by Mario Monicelli) was the most successful Italian movie of the year, Zwei Särge auf Bestellung (1967) (directed by Elio Petri) won the Grand Prix du Scenario at the Cannes Film Festival, and Volontè won his first Nastro d'Argento (Silver Ribbon - the most prestigious acting award in Italy) in 1970 for Ermittlungen gegen einen über jeden Verdacht erhabenen Bürger (1970) (also directed by Petri), making him an international star. The film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign-Language Film, the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival and two Italian Golden Globes, including one for his performance. In 1972, he starred in two Italian movies as the protagonist: Petri's Der Weg der Arbeiterklasse ins Paradies (1971) and Francesco Rosi's Der Fall Mattei (1972), both of which won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, where he also won a Special Mention. In his life, Volontè won a huge number of other prizes and honours, becoming one of the most celebrated Italian actors of the seventies, and challenging Vittorio Gassman and Marcello Mastroianni as the most popular Italian actor. He died in Greece in 1994.\n\nMarcello Mastroianni was born in Fontana Liri, Italy in 1924, but soon his family moved to Turin and then Rome. During WW2 he was sent to a German prison camp, but he managed to escape and hide in Venice. He debuted in films as an extra in Marionette (1939), then started working for the Italian department of \"Eagle Lion Films\" in Rome and joined a drama club, where he was discovered by director Luchino Visconti. In 1957 Visconti gave him the starring part in his Fyodor Dostoevsky adaptation Weiße Nächte (1957) and in 1958 he was fine as a little thief in Mario Monicelli's comedy Diebe haben's schwer (1958). But his real breakthrough came in 1960, when Federico Fellini cast him as an attractive, weary-eyed journalist of the Rome jet-set in Das süße Leben (1960); that film was the genesis of his \"Latin lover\" persona, which Mastroianni himself often denied by accepting parts of passive and sensitive men. He would again work with Fellini in several major films, like the exquisite Achteinhalb (1963) (as a movie director who finds himself at a point of crisis) and the touching Ginger und Fred (1986) (as an old entertainer who appears in a TV show). He also appeared as a tired novelist with marital problems in Michelangelo Antonioni's Die Nacht (1961), as an impotent young man in Mauro Bolognini's Bel Antonio (1960) , as an exiled prince in John Boorman's Leo, der Letzte (1970), as a traitor in Paolo and Vittorio Taviani's Allonsanfan (1974) and as a sensitive homosexual in love with a housewife in Ettore Scola's Ein besonderer Tag (1977). He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor three times, for Scheidung auf italienisch (1961), Ein besonderer Tag (1977), and Schwarze Augen (1987). During the last decade of his life he worked with directors, like Theodoros Angelopoulos, Bertrand Blier and Raúl Ruiz, who gave him three excellent parts in Drei Leben und ein Tod (1996). He died of pancreatic cancer in 1996.\n\nBorn in San Giorgio di Piano, Giulietta Masina spent part of her teenage years living with a widowed aunt in Rome, where she cultivated a passion for the theater and studied for a degree in Philosophy. She began her career on the radio with the program \"Terzoglio\" (1942), about the adventures of newlyweds Cico and Pallina from scripts written by Federico Fellini. The series brought her great success. The following year she married Fellini and became the inspirational muse for many of his films.\n\nShe made her cinema debut in Ohne Gnade (1948), directed by Alberto Lattuada, but really established her reputation with her next few films: Geschlossene Gardinen (1951), directed by Luigi Comencini, Lichter des Varieté (1950), which also marked Fellini's debut as director (the film credits both Fellini and Lattuada); and Europa 51 (1952), directed by Roberto Rossellini. Her artistic partnership with her husband really took off with the Oscar-winning Das Lied der Straße (1954), followed by Die Schwindler (1955) and the widely acclaimed Die Nächte der Cabiria (1957), which again won an Oscar and brought her the award for Best Female Performance at the Cannes Film Festival. Over the following years she played many memorable roles in such films as Fortunella (1958), directed by Eduardo De Filippo; Frauen hinter Gittern (1959), directed by Renato Castellani; and later in Julia und die Geister (1965) and Ginger und Fred (1986), both directed by Fellini.\n\nFrom 1966 to 1969 she hosted the immensely popular radio show \"Lettere aperte a Giulietta Masina\" and starred in the television series Eleonora (1973), by Tullio Pinelli, directed by Silverio Blasi, and Camilla (1976), directed by Sandro Bolchi, based on the novel by Fausta Cialente, \"Un inverno freddissimo\" (1966).\n\nShe died in Rome in 1994, just a few months after the death of her husband.\n\nSilvana Mangano was born on April 21, 1930 in Rome, Italy and was raised in poverty during World War II. She trained as a dancer for seven years and supported herself as a model. In 1946, at age 16, she won the Miss Rome beauty pageant and through this, she obtained role in a Maria Della Costa film. One year later, she was one of the girls in the Miss Italia contest. Lucia Bose became \"The Queen\", and nearby, on the stage of Stresa, were some other future stars of Italian cinema: Gina Lollobrigida, Eleonora Rossi Drago and Gianna Maria Canale.\n\nMangano's earlier connection with filmmaking occurred with her romantic relationship with actor Marcello Mastroianni. This led her to a film contract, though this would take some time for Mangano to ascend to international stardom with her role in Bitterer Reis (1949). Thereatfer, she signed a contract with Lux Film, and later married Dino De Laurentiis, who was on the verge of becoming a known producer. Though she never scaled the heights of her contemporaries Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida, Mangano remained a favorite star of the 1950s and 1970s, appearing in Anna (1951), Das Gold von Neapel (1954), Mambo (1954), Teorema - Geometrie der Liebe (1968), Der Tod in Venedig (1971) and Teuflisches Spiel (1972).\n\nMarried to film producer Dino De Laurentiis from 1949, the couple had four children: Veronica, Raffaella, Francesca and Federico. Veronica's daughter Giada is the host of \"Everyday Italian\" and \"Giada at Home\" on the Food Network. Raffaella co-produced with her father on Mangano's penultimate film, the science fiction epic Der Wüstenplanet (1984). In 1983, she separated from De Laurentiis and abandoned her career to live in Paris and Madrid, where she made tapestries. Following surgery on December 4, 1989 that left her in a coma, Silvana Mangano died at age 59 of lung cancer in Madrid, Spain during the early morning hours of December 16, 1989.\n\nGiancarlo Giannini is an Oscar-nominated Italian actor, director and multilingual dubber who made an international reputation for his leading roles in Italian films as well as for his mastery of a variety of languages and dialects.\n\nHe was born August 1, 1942, in La Spezia, Italy. For 10 years he lived and studied in Naples, earning a degree in electronics. At 18 he enrolled in the Academy of Dramatic Art D'Amico in Rome and made his stage acting debut there. His credits included performances in contemporary Italian plays as well, as in Italian productions of William Shakespeare's plays \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"A Midsummer's Night Dream\". In 1965 he made his television debut starring as David Copperfield in the TV miniseries made by RAI ,the Italian national TV company. He made his big-screen debut in Libido (1965), a Freudian psychological thriller. Since 1966 he has been in a successful collaboration with legendary Italian director Lina Wertmüller, who made several award-winning films with Giannini as a male lead. He appears as peasant Tonino who prepares to assassinate dictator Benito Mussolini in Liebe und Anarchie (1973), as a sailor in the irony-laden comedy Hingerissen von einem ungewöhnlichen Schicksal im azurblauen Meer im August (1974), and as a concentration-camp survivor in the Oscar-nominated Sieben Schönheiten (1975). He also starred as a Jewish musician arrested by the Nazis in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's masterpiece Lili Marleen (1981).\n\nGiannini also made a reputation for dubbing international stars in films released on the Italian market, such as Jack Nicholson, Al Pacino, Michael Douglas, Dustin Hoffman, Gérard Depardieu, and Ian McKellen, among others. He received a compliment from Stanley Kubrick for his dubbing of Nicholson in Shining (1980). Giannini's fluency in English and his mastery of dialects has brought him a number of supporting roles in Hollywood productions, such as Dem Himmel so nah (1995), Hannibal (2001), Darkness (2002), and Mann unter Feuer (2004), among many others. He appears as Rene Mathis in the 21st James Bond film Casino Royale (2006), and reprises the role in the sequel, James Bond 007: Ein Quantum Trost (2008).\n\nVittorio De Sica grew up in Naples, and started out as an office clerk in order to raise money to support his poor family. He was increasingly drawn towards acting, and made his screen debut while still in his teens, joining a stage company in 1923. By the late 1920s he was a successful matinee idol of the Italian theatre, and repeated that achievement in Italian movies, mostly light comedies. He turned to directing in 1940, making comedies in a similar vein, but with his fifth film Kinder sehen uns an (1943), he revealed hitherto unsuspected depths and an extraordinarily sensitive touch with actors, especially children. It was also the first film he made with the writer Cesare Zavattini with whom he would subsequently make Schuhputzer (1946) and Fahrraddiebe (1948), heartbreaking studies of poverty in postwar Italy which won special Oscars before the foreign film category was officially established. After the box-office disaster of Umberto D. (1952), a relentlessly bleak study of the problems of old age, he returned to directing lighter work, appearing in front of the camera more frequently. Although Gestern, heute und morgen (1963) won him another Oscar, it was generally accepted that his career as one of the great directors was over. However, just before he died he made Der Garten der Finzi Contini (1970), which won him yet another Oscar, and his final film Ein kurzer Urlaub (1973). He died following the removal of a cyst from his lungs.\n\nAmong others of Ugo Tognazzi's superb, award-winning performances of his prolific career, this excellent Italian character star has been widely cherished for his classic comedy role of gay cabaret owner Renato Baldi, opposite Michel Serrault's hilariously mincing drag queen partner Alban, in Ein Käfig voller Narren (1978) one of the biggest cross-over foreign hits to ever land on American soil.\n\nBorn Ottavio Tognazzi in Cremona, Italy, on March 23, 1922, by the time Ugo was a teen he was a bookkeeper for a salami factory and performed in local amateur theatricals on the sly. Appearing on the stage, he finally found an entry into films at age 28 in 1950 with a featured role in the war comedy I cadetti di Guascogna (1950). He built up a solid comedy resume in primarily Neapolitan 50's features including La paura fa 90 (1951) (his first co-starring role), Café chantant (1953), I milanesi a Napoli (1954), La moglie è uguale per tutti (1955), Domenica è sempre domenica (1958), Le confident de ces dames (1959) and Tipi da spiaggia (1959).\n\nUgo became a middle-aged European star the following decade. Turning in a number of powerhouse character studies, he excelled as bon vivants, adulterous husbands and other suave gents in primarily farcical comedy and saucy, sardonic romps, particularly those of director/writer Marco Ferreri. He also demonstrated a remarkable range when it came to portraying world-weary protagonists in political drama or grim satire. For Ferreri alone, he appeared in the award-winning Die Bienenkönigin (1963), Controsesso (1964), Marcia nuziale (1966), Die Audienz (1972) and the masterful Das große Fressen (1973), among others.\n\nIn 1978, Tognazzi decided to take a chance, and play a character unlike anything he had done, (and, also, rarely done, for fear of being 'stereotyped'), and co-starred with the wonderful Michel Serrault in an image-shattering part in 1978. What he did was experience the most popular role of his career as one-half of an aging gay couple who operate a drag club. Ein Käfig voller Narren (1978) went on to spawn two sequels and an American remake (The Birdcage - Ein Paradies für schrille Vögel (1996) starring Robin Williams (in the Tognazzi role) and Nathan Lane (in the diva Serrault part).\n\nTognazzi won several acting honors over the course of his long career. He copped several European awards for his classic roles in I mostri (1963) (The Monsters), Ich habe sie gut gekannt (1965), Unmoralisch lebt man besser (1967) (also a rare foreign Golden Globe nomination), Bambolona - die große Puppe (1968), Il commissario Pepe (1969), Die Kalifin (1970) and Ente auf Orange (1975). He capped it off with the Cannes Film Festival award for his trenchant performance in Die Tragödie eines lächerlichen Mannes (1981), the tale of a near-bankrupt factory owner who attempts to use the kidnapping of his son (played by his real-life eldest son Ricky Tognazzi) to his financial advantage. Tognazzi was also the father of actor Gianmarco Tognazzi and director Maria Sole Tognazzi, and had another son, producer/writer Thomas Robsahm, via a relationship with actress Margrete Robsahm.\n\nIn the eighties, Tognazzi focused strongly on the theater and starred in such plays as Luigi Pirandello's \"Six Characters in Search of an Author\" (1986, directed by Jean-Pierre Vincent in Paris, Théâtre de l' Europe) and Molière's \"The Miser\" (1989, where he sparked a controversy in Italian government circles when he improvised lines about corruption in high places during his performance). Although he directed himself in a handful of his own often sexually explicit films, including Il fischio al naso (1967) and Sissignore (1968), Ugo's true brilliance shines in front of the camera and in the works of other famed European directors, notably Ferrari, Bernardo Bertolucci, Pietro Germi, Dino Risi and Mario Monicelli. He worked up until the end with incisive starring performances in Das Chaoten-Duo (1988), Bandellis Alibi (1988), Tolérance (1989) and La batalla de los Tres Reyes (1990) (The Battle of the Three Kings). In 1972, at age 50, Tognazzi wed actress Franca Bettoia, who survives him. He died of a brain hemorrhage in 1990, age 68.\n\nTerence Hill was born as Mario Girotti on March 29, 1939 in Venice, Italy to a chemist. His mother was German, and as a child the family lived near Dresden, Saxony, Germany where they survived the Allied bombings of World War II. Italian film-maker Dino Risi discovered him at a swimming meet and he made his first film at the age of 12, Das große Ferienabenteuer (1952) (Holiday for Gangsters). He continued acting to finance his studies and motorcycle hobby. After studying classical literature at the University of Rome for three years, he decided to devote full time to acting. In 1962 he appeared in Luchino Visconti's Der Leopard (1963), He then signed a contract for a series of adventure and western films in Germany. In 1967 he returned to Italy to play the lead in Gott vergibt ... Django nie! (1967). While on location in Almeria, Spain, he married an American girl of Bavarian descent, Lori Zwicklbauer, who was the dialogue coach for the picture. The producers of this movie wanted him to change his name. He then got a list with 20 names on it and 24 hours time to choose one of these names. He decided to take Terence Hill cause he liked it the most and it has the same initials as his mother's name (Hildegard Thieme). They only told the public that \"Hill\" was his wife's name out of publicity reasons. At this time of upcoming feminism a man who took his wife's name was something special. In 1976 Hollywood called and he appeared in Marschier oder stirb (1977) with Gene Hackman and starred in Mister Billion (1977) with Valerie Perrine. Since then he has concentrated on action/adventure films starring himself and often working with long time partner Bud Spencer. Terence lives in Massachusetts and is a film producer, as well as talented and respected actor.\n\nAnna Magnani was born in Rome, Italy (not in Egypt, as some biographies claim), on March 7, 1908. She was the child of Marina Magnani and an unknown father often said to be from Alexandria, Egypt, but whom Anna herself claimed was from the Calabria region of Italy although she never knew his name. Raised in poverty by her maternal grandmother in Rome after her mother left her, Anna worked her way through Rome's Academy of Dramatic Art by singing in cabarets and night-clubs, then began touring the countryside with small repertory companies.\n\nAlthough she had a small role in a silent film in the late 1920s, she was not known as a film actress until Verliebte Unschuld (1941), directed by Vittorio De Sica. Her break-through film was Roberto Rossellini's Rom, offene Stadt (1945) (A.K.A. Open City), generally regarded as the first commercially successful Italian neorealist film of the postwar years and the one that won her an international reputation. From then on, she didn't stop working in films and television, winning an Academy Award for her performance in the screen version of Tennessee Williams' Die tätowierte Rose (1955), a part that was written for her by her close friend Williams. She worked with all of Italy's leading directors of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.\n\nShe was renowned for her earthy, passionate, woman-of-the-soil roles. She and Rossellini were lovers for some years after Open City, until he began his infamous affair with Ingrid Bergman. She had one child, Luca, with Italian actor Massimo Serato. The boy was later stricken with polio and Magnani dedicated her life to caring for him. Her only marriage, to Italian director Goffredo Alessandrini in the mid-1930s, lasted only a short while and ended in an annulment. Her last film was Federico Fellini's Fellinis Roma (1972). She died in her native Rome from pancreatic cancer the following year at age sixty-five.\n\nSophia Loren was born as Sofia Scicolone at the Clinica Regina Margherita in Rome on September 20, 1934. Her father Riccardo was married to another woman and refused to marry her mother Romilda Villani, despite the fact that she was the mother of his two children (Sophia and her younger sister Maria Scicolone). Growing up in the slums of Pozzuoli during the second World War without any support from her father, she experienced great sadness in her childhood. Her life took an unexpected turn for the best when, at age 14, she entered into a beauty contest and placed as one of the finalists. It was here that Sophia caught the attention of film producer Carlo Ponti, some 22 years her senior, whom she later married. Perhaps he was the father figure she never experienced as a child. Under his guidance, Sophia was put under contract and appeared as an extra in ten films beginning with Le sei mogli di Barbablù (1950), before working her way up to supporting roles. In these early films, she was credited as \"Sofia Lazzaro\" because people joked her beauty could raise Lazzarus from the dead.\n\nBy her late teens, Sophia was playing lead roles in many Italian features such as La favorita (1952) and Aida (1953). In 1957, she embarked on a successful acting career in the United States, starring in Der Knabe auf dem Delphin (1957), Die Stadt der Verlorenen (1957), and Stolz und Leidenschaft (1957) that year. She had a short-lived but much-publicized fling with co-star Cary Grant, who was nearly 31 years her senior. She was only 22 while he was 53, and she rejected a marriage proposal from him. They were paired together a second time in the family-friendly romantic comedy Hausboot (1958). While under contract to Paramount, Sophia starred in Begierde unter Ulmen (1958), Der Schlüssel (1958), Die schwarze Orchidee (1958), Es Begann in Neapel (1960), Die Dame und der Killer (1960), Prinzessin Olympia (1960), and Die Millionärin (1960) before returning to Italy to star in ...und dennoch leben sie (1960). The film was a period piece about a woman living in war-torn Italy who is raped while trying to protect her young daughter. Originally cast as the more glamorous child, Sophia fought against type and was re-cast as the mother, displaying a lack of vanity and proving herself as a genuine actress. This performance received international acclaim and was honored with an Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nSophia remained a bona fide international movie star throughout the sixties and seventies, making films on both sides of the Atlantic, and starring opposite such leading men as Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, Gregory Peck, and Charlton Heston. Her English-language films included El Cid (1961), Der Untergang des Römischen Reiches (1964), Arabeske (1966), Der Mann von La Mancha (1972), and Treffpunkt Todesbrücke (1976). She gained wider respect with her Italian films, especially Hochzeit auf italienisch (1964) and Ein besonderer Tag (1977), both of which co-starred Marcello Mastroianni. During these years she received a second Oscar nomination and won five Golden Globe Awards.\n\nFrom the eighties onward, Sophia's appearances on the big screen came few and far between. She preferred to spend the majority of her time raising sons Carlo Ponti Jr. (b. 1968) and Edoardo Ponti (b. 1973). Her only acting credits during the decade were five television films, beginning with Sophia Loren - Mein Leben (1980), a biopic in which she portrayed herself and her mother. She ventured into other areas of business and became the first actress to launch her own fragrance and design of eyewear. In 1982 she voluntarily spent nineteen days in jail for tax evasion.\n\nIn 1991 Sophia received an Honorary Academy Award for her body of work, and was declared \"one of world cinema's greatest treasures.\" That same year, she experienced a terrible loss when her mother died of cancer. Her return to mainstream films in Prêt-à-Porter (1994) was well-received, although the film as a whole was not. She followed this up with her biggest U.S. hit in years, the comedy Der dritte Frühling (1995), in which she played a sexy divorcée who seduces Walter Matthau. Over the next decade Sophia had plum roles in a few independent films like Soleil (1997), Zwischen Fremden (2002) (directed by Edoardo), and Lives of the Saints (2004). Still beautiful at 72, she posed scantily-clad for the 2007 Pirelli Calendar. Sadly, that same year she mourned the death of her 94-year-old spouse, Carlo Ponti. In 2009, after far too much time away from film, she appeared in the musical Nine (2009) opposite Daniel Day-Lewis. These days Sophia is based in Switzerland but frequently travels to the states to spend time with her sons and their families (Eduardo is married to actress Sasha Alexander). Sophia Loren remains one of the most beloved and recognizable figures in the international film world.\n\nBlue-eyed and well-built Italian actor in international cinema, Franco Nero, was a painting photographer when he was discovered as an actor by director John Huston. He has since appeared in more than 200 movies around the world, working with Europe's top directors, such as Luis Buñuel, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Claude Chabrol, Sergey Bondarchuk, Michael Cacoyannis, Elio Petri, Marco Bellocchio, Enzo G. Castellari, among many others.\n\nNero was born in Parma (Northern Italy), in the family of a strict police sergeant. His inclination for acting had already become obvious in his teenage years, when he began organizing and participating in student plays. After a short stint at a leading theater school, he moved to Rome, where he joined a small group of friends for the purpose of making documentaries. Still unsure of his ultimate vocation, he worked various jobs on the crew. He studied economics and trade in Milan University, and appeared in popular Italian photo-novels. This gave him a chance to gain a little role in Carlo Lizzani's La Celestina P... R... (1965).\n\nA year later, the handsome face of Nero was noticed by Huston, who chose him for the role of \"Abel\" in Die Bibel (1966) (aka La Bibbia). But success came after he got the role of the lonely gunfighter, dragging a coffin, in one of the best spaghetti-westerns; Sergio Corbucci's Django (1966). Nero then filmed a few other westerns of that style as Ferdinando Baldi's Django, der Rächer (1966) and Lucio Fulci's Django - Sein Gesangbuch war der Colt (1966).\n\nIn 1967, Joshua Logan cast him in the film version of the musical Camelot: Am Hofe König Arthurs (1967) (Warner Bros.), opposite Vanessa Redgrave, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe award. During filming of Camelot, he met actress Vanessa Redgrave, who become his long-time partner (they married decades later). He played with Catherine Deneuve in Luis Buñuel's Tristana (1970) and was directed by Sergey Bondarchuk in the war drama Die Schlacht an der Neretva (1969). Later, director Bondarchuk cast Nero for the role of famous American reporter \"John Reed\" in two-part \"Krasnye kolokola II\" (1982). In the late 60s and during the 70s, Nero played many different roles, but most of them connected with political and criminal genre, which criticized the Italian justice system.\n\nIn the early 80s, Nero was chosen for the role of the white ninja, \"Cole\", in Ninja - Die Killer-Maschine (1981) and in 1990 as terrorist \"Gen. Esperanza\", opposite Bruce Willis, in Renny Harlin's Stirb Langsam 2 (1990). He has also payed the roles of leading national heroes, such as \"Garibaldi\" (Italy), \"Arpad\" (Hungary), and \"Banovic Strahinja\" (Yugoslavia). In the USA, he has been in successful mini-series, such as \"The Pirate\" (Warner Bros), \"The Last Days of Pompeii\" (CBS), \"Young Catherine\" (TNT), \"Bella Mafia\" (CBS), \"The Painted Lady\", \"Saint Augustine\", and movies such as \"The Legend of Valentino\", \"21 Hours to Munich\", \"Force 10 from Navarone\", \"Enter the Ninja\", \"The Versace Murder\", and Briefe an Julia (2010).\n\nHe worked with the top European directors from Carlo Lizzani, Damiano Damiani, Luigi Zampa, Luis Buñuel, Elio Petri, Michael Cacoyannis, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Claude Chabrol, 'Vatroslav Mimica', Marco Bellocchio, etc. At the beginning of the 80s, he also began producing, writing and directing. Between films, he participates in various theatrical events.\n\nApart from his cinematographic work, Nero also works for charitable organizations. Over the last 45 years, he has been a benefactor of the Don Bosco orphanage in Tivoli. He has received many awards and, in 1992 for his artistic merits, a knighthood of the Italian Republic was bestowed on him by the President of Italy. In 2011, he was honored by Brunel University of London with the honorary degree of doctor of Letters honoris causa and, in Toronto, with a star on the Walk of Fame.\n\nOne of Italy's most captivating and talented cinematic comedy stars, Italian veteran Alberto Sordi was known for satirizing his country's social mores in pungent black comedies, farcical tales and grim drama. He, along with peers Vittorio Gassman, Ugo Tognazzi and Nino Manfredi, arguably represent the finest of post-war Italian cinema history. Born in Rome on June 15, 1920 in the Trastevere district, Sordi grew up in a musical family, his father being a tuba player for the Rome Opera House. A choir boy at the Sistine Chapel, he later trained for the theater in Milan but returned to Rome to work in radio and musical halls in comedy shows. In the late 30s he found his way into film as an extra. His first important role was in The Three Pilots (1942), a fascist war picture, but he wouldn't hit international stardom until a decade later when he starred in Federico Fellini's early films The White Sheik (1952) and I Vitelloni (1953). The titles of some of his most prolific characters were as simple as their titles: The Seducer, The Bachelor, The Husband, The Widower, The Traffic Cop, and The Moralist. Most of his protagonists amusingly, but not always pleasantly, stereotyped the worst attributes of Italian men and society, yet many of his films are unparalleled in quality and considered masterpieces. Sordi went on to star, direct and co-write more than 150 films. Never married and rather an introvert, he enjoyed a quiet, reclusive personal life. On his 80th birthday, he was made Mayor of Rome for the day. In 2002, after 190 films, he announced his retirement, and died of a heart attack the following year at age 82."
