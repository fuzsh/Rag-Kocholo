The volume ends with an appendix ('Pour une histoire de la famille et de l'amour a l'epoque de l'humanisme', pp. 28I-301, first published inRevue des etudes italiennes, 36 (I990), 89-I04) which points out that Alberti's first major work De familia does not appear in a vacuum, but belongs in that early humanist context that had produced Francesco Barbaro's De reuxoria ( 4 I5-I 6), Palmieri's Della vita civile, Bruni's Vita diDante, and Poggio'sAn seni sit uxor ducenda (allwritten in the 1430s, and all dealing with questions of marriage and the family). Despite a few misprints, the whole volume displays an analytic precision and varietas that would have pleased Alberti himself. What emerges most of all from it is the need to approach these difficult but rewarding texts and problems with a new critical awareness, and a variety of methodologies ranging from questions of sources and philological issues to analyses of literary structure and the history of reception. Furlan's critical acumen in these various fields is in clear evidence here and this bodes well for the future of Alberti studies, inwhich he plays amajor role. MAGDALENCOLLEGE, OXFORD MARTIN MCLAUGHLIN Retorica della diffrazione: Bembo, Aretino, Giulio Romano e Tasso. Letteratura e scena cortigiana. By FABIO FINOTTI. (Biblioteca di 'Lettere Italiane', Studi e testi, 63) Florence: Olschki. 2004. 466 pp.; 20 plates. E46. ISBN 88-222-53-84I. This very rich volume, which discusses aspects of courtly literature, drama, and the pastoral, with reference also to the visual arts, is the result of research partly presented at seminars and courses in Italy and the USA. The fact that much of the text had been discussed with postgraduates and colleagues has perhaps led the author to be confident that his title 'retorica della diffrazione' would pose no problems, and so he does not provide an introduction explaining his terminology and outlining his argument. Iwould have welcomed this, although, as one's reading progresses, the metaphorical use of the optical image of 'diffraction' is gradually clarified and the influences of past traditions together with their transformations in later works fall into place, thanks also to the author's ability to combine the general directions of cultural phenomena with a detailed reading of the texts under discussion. While in no sense an introductory study, and requiring in fact a sophisticated knowledge of Italian Renaissance culture and an appreciation of a wide range of critical works, both literary and artistic, this volume realistically acknowledges that some linguistic help isnecessary, so all quotations from Latin in the text are also given in Italian translation in the notes (but when Latin quotations appear in the notes they are left untranslated), and the very useful appendix with a relevant selection from Bembo's Carmina is accompanied by Finotti's own elegant Italian rendering. The study is divided into three sections. The first is devoted to 'The lyric scene: Pietro Bembo', and consists of two chapters, one treating the combination of 'elo quence/rhetoric' and 'experience' inBembo's De Aetna and Asolani and the fusion of philology and linguistics which he had inherited from Poliziano and from which he progressed in the direction of Landino, the other taking us squarely into the theme of the volume, 'Rhetoric and diffraction in the Asolani'. Here the features of De Aetna which gave rhetoric a central place and linked it to experience are confirmed, but the argument ismoved from a philosophical plane to amore literary one. The theatrical element, to be further developed in the context of drama and the pastoral, is already highlighted in the analysis of this courtly dialogue, which is considered in its various editions. MLR, I0I.3, 2oo6 865 The second section is entitled 'The comic scene: Pietro Aretino' and is devoted toAretino's play IIMarescalco and its relationship to Castiglione's Cortegiano. The argument isdeveloped particularly in relation to the structure of the two texts and their common use of the burla, which, unlike its functional exploitation inMachiavelli's Mandragola, represents a taste for 'second-degree' comedy, i.e. comedy..."
