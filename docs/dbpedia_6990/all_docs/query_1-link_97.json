But according to our information, Maoists aren’t active in the area. Hence, we are not sure whether it was Maoists or any other group,” Ranchi Superintendent of Police (rural) A. V. Minz said. While Minz said investigations were on, local residents claimed that Maoists were behind the murder. “Mahto was responsible for the murder of Ram Charan, a CPI (Maoist) area commander, who was shot dead on June 7 last year. Hence, there is every possibility that Maoists are involved,” said a middle-aged villager.

Sangma’s was replying to a question on jailed Garo National Liberation Army (GNLA) leader Champion R.

Counter-terrorism officials have gathered intelligence that the Chinese agencies are financing and providing assistance to Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to keep insurgent groups active in the Northeast. A note prepared by the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) on the recent unrest in the Northeast says, “ISI is being used by Chinese intelligence agencies as a surrogate.” The note has been forwarded to the home ministry. According to intelligence agencies, Indian insurgent groups are being provided assistance in the form of money and weapons by the Chinese agencies through ISI. Intelligence officials also suspect that the violence in Assam in which more than 80 people were killed could have been part of a “bigger conspiracy”. The linkages of the ISI, which has a strong base in states such as Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya and Manipur, with the Chinese agencies, have become a major cause of concern in India. Experts believe this is a deadly cocktail of terror that is being used to destabilize the country. “Till the mid 1970s the Chinese were directly involved in creating trouble in North-East. Later the ISI started building a network.

Mir had travelled to Pakistan's Faisalabad in early 2012 and met LeT men there. His travel was facilitated by Zahoor Ahmed of Arth of Budgam District, Police added. Mir told his interrogators that the LeT militant Waleed (in Pakistan), wanted to start an agitation similar to that in 2010 by targeting Masjids and Shrines in Kashmir valley.

Sources said the firing squad shot Ghuncha Gul Zakhakhel on the orders of its leader Mangal Bagh. Ghuncha Gul, who was heading his own breakaway group Tawheedul Islam had gone missing in April last year and the LI conceded that he was in their captivity. Roza Gul, an associate of Ghuncha, confirmed the killing and said his group was yet to receive the body. Ghuncha Gul and Mangal Bagh had joined hands after the latter fled from Bara during an operation in 2004 and took shelter in Gogrina village of Zakhakhel Bazaar. Sources said Ghuncha Gul headed a gang of kidnappers before joining Mangal Bagh and he was wanted by the political administration in a number of criminal cases.

They operate very much like a sophisticated transnational Mafia network.\" Peters however noted that \"I believe that their relationship with the ISI, although close --and this is a relationship that has lasted since the 1970s, even prior to the Soviet arrival in Afghanistan -- today, are much more fraught than many outsiders imagine.\" Read less...\n\nOctober - 2&nbsp\n\nKarachi East Range Police arrested 25 suspects in raids from different parts of the city and recovered weapons, including 8 pistols, 2 revolvers and drugs in huge quantity from them, reported The News.

In a meeting of the TTP, the outfit set aside its earlier plans to send suicide bombers to assassinate PTI chief Imran Khan, during his visit to South Waziristan for a “peace march”. The Express Tribune quoting the UK-based daily The Telegraph said that senior ‘commanders’ of TTP as saying that the group noted Khan’s vehement opposition to US drone strikes against militants in its territory “as it reversed course to offer security assistance.” A TTP spokesperson said, “We are ready to provide them security if they need. We endorse Imran Khan’s plea that drone strikes are against our sovereignty. The anti-drone rallies should have been taken out by the religious leaders long ago but Imran had taken the lead and we would not harm him or his followers.” Earlier, the TTP had criticised Khan’s statement in which he had called himself a “liberal”. The TTP contended that by classifying himself as a liberal, Imran Khan had proved that he was a slave of the Western powers — especially the US and Europe. The organisation held that they were not satisfied with his policies.

The announcement contrasts sharply with a claim Government officials made last month during their meetings with a United Nations (UN) mission on enforced disappearances that the number of such incidents had dropped sharply over recent months. The latest figures released by the Commission show that 539 cases of missing persons were under investigation before it by September 30, 2012. On January 1, 2011, there were 138 cases pending before the Commission which received 714 new cases during the past 21 months, increasing the total number to 852. The Commission set up under directives of the Supreme Court two years ago has so far disposed of 313 cases. The Commission had earlier announced that the total number of missing persons’ cases was 772 by June 30, 2012. Thus it received 80 new cases between July 1 and September 30, 2012. Without elaborating, the Commission said it had succeeded in tracing 27 persons during September when it held its proceedings in Islamabad. An official statement provided the list of the 27 persons recovered last month, but was silent about the place where they were found and the identity of their captors. It once again expressed its determination “to make all out efforts to trace the missing persons”. The relatives of the missing persons allege that Intelligence and Security Agencies picked them up on suspicion of having links with terrorist organisations. Most of the missing persons hail from Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the tribal areas.

We don’t see the situation unfavorable anywhere in the tribal region,” PTI leader Pervez Khan Khattak said.
