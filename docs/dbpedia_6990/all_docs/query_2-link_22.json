        "text": "Professor Paterson is Director at The University of Queensland Centre for Clinical Research. He is also a Consultant Infectious Diseases Physician at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital (Australia's largest hospital and ranked in the top 100 hospitals of the world). He is Australia's most cited Infectious Diseases Physician and is the country's highest cited researcher in the field of Microbiology. He has been in the ISI Thomson Reuters Highly Cited List annually from 2015 to 2019.\n\nHe received his medical degree and PhD from The University of Queensland. His research focuses on the molecular and clinical epidemiology of infections with antibiotic resistant organisms, with the intent of translation of knowledge into optimal prevention and treatment of these infections. He now has added clinical trials to his research portfolio and has recently conducted the world's largest trial on antibiotics for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing bacterial infections (the \"MERINO trial\"). Professor Paterson has received research funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Australia's National Health and Medical and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and the Medical Research Future Fund. In 2007, Professor Paterson returned to Brisbane after ten years at The University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. A 2008 Frank Fenner Award for Advanced Research in Infectious Diseases by the Australasian Society for Infectious Diseases (ASID) quickly followed and in 2009 he was awarded a Queensland Health Senior Clinical Research Fellowship and subsequently 2 NHMRC Practitioner Fellowships. He is now an NHMRC Investigator Grant holder."
