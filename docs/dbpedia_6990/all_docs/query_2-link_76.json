        "text": "Nawabzada Liaquat Ali Khan (Næʍābzādāh Liāqat Alī Khān listen ,Urdu: لِیاقت علی خان‎ ; 1 October 1895 – 16 October 1951), widely known as Quaid-e-Millat (Leader of the Nation) and Shaheed-e-Millat (Urdu: شہِیدِ مِلّت‎ Martyr of the Nation), was one of the leading founding fathers of Pakistan, statesman, lawyer, and political theorist who became and served as the first Prime Minister of Pakistan; he also held cabinet portfolio as the first foreign, defence, and the frontier regions minister from 1947 until his assassination in 1951. Prior to the partition, Khan briefly tenured as the first finance minister in the interim government led by its Governor General Mountbatten.He was born into an influential aristocratic Muslim family in Karnal, Eastern Punjab on 1 October 1895. Liaquat Ali Khan was educated at the Aligarh Muslim University in India, and then at Oxford University in the United Kingdom. Well-educated, he was a democratic political theorist who promoted parliamentarism in India. After first being invited by the Congress Party, he opted for the Muslim League led by influential Mohammad Ali Jinnah who was advocating the eradication of the injustices and ill-treatment meted out to Indian Muslims by the British government. He pursued his role in the independence movements of India and Pakistan, while serving as the first Finance Minister in the interim government of British Indian Empire, prior to the independence and partition of India and Pakistan in 1947. Ali Khan assisted Jinnah in campaigning for the creation of a separate state for Indian Muslims.Ali Khan's credentials secured him the appointment of Pakistan's first Prime Minister, Ali Khan's foreign policy sided with the United States and the West, though his foreign policy was determined to be a part of the Non Aligned Movement. Facing internal political unrest, his government survived a coup hatched by the leftists and communists. Nonetheless, his influence grew further after Jinnah's death, and he was responsible for promulgating the Objectives Resolution. In 1951, at a political rally in Rawalpindi, Ali Khan was assassinated by a hired assassin, Said Babrak.\n\nNaseeruddin Shah, a luminary in the realm of Indian cinema, has an illustrious career that spans over four decades. Born in Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh, India in 1949, he cultivated a deep passion for acting at a young age and blossomed into one of India's most respected actors. Shah was a student at Aligarh Muslim University and later attended the National School of Drama in Delhi, where he honed his acting skills before making his film debut in 1975 with Nishant. His exceptional performances have earned him several awards, including three National Film Awards and a highly coveted Volpi Cup from the Venice Film Festival. Shah's dedication to his craft is evident in his extensive body of work. He is known for his roles in both mainstream Bollywood movies and parallel cinema, an alternative to commercial films. His masterful performances in films like Masoom, Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro, and Sparsh have left a lasting impact on the industry. Moreover, he has been lauded for his contributions to theatre and has directed and acted in numerous stage productions. His excellence in acting transcends borders, as he has also appeared in international films such as Monsoon Wedding and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Despite reaching stellar heights in his career, Shah's life is not solely encapsulated by his acting prowess. He is also an author, having penned a memoir titled And Then One Day, reflecting on his life and experiences in the film industry."
