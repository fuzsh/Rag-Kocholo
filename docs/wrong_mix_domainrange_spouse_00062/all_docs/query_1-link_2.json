        "text": "Helium Catalyzed D-D Fusion in a Levitated Dipole\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKesner, J.; Bromberg, L.; Garnier, D. T.; Hansen, A.; Mauel, M. E.\n\n2003-10-01\n\nFusion research has focused on the goal of deuterium and tritium (D-T) fusion power because the reaction rate is large compared with the other fusion fuels: D-D or D-He3. Furthermore, the D-D cycle is difficult in traditional confinement devices, such as tokamaks, because good energy confinement is accompanied by good particle confinement which leads to an accumulation of ash. Fusion reactors based on the D-D reaction would be advantageous to D-T based reactors since they do not require the breeding of tritium and can reduce the flux of energetic neutrons that cause material damage. We propose a fusion power source based on the levitated dipole fusion concept that uses a \"helium catalyzed D-D\" fuel cycle, where rapid circulation of plasma allows the removal of tritium and the re-injection of the He3 decay product, eliminating the need for a massive blanket and shield. Stable dipole confinement derives from plasma compressibility instead of the magnetic shear and average good curvature. As a result, a dipole magnetic field can stabilize plasma at high beta while allowing large-scale adiabatic particle circulation. These properties may make the levitated dipole uniquely capable of achieving good energy confinement with low particle confinement. We find that a dipole based D-D power source can provide better utilization of magnetic field energy with a comparable mass power density to a D-T based tokamak power source.\n\nPreparation of ortho-para ratio controlled D2 gas for muon-catalyzed fusion.\n\nPubMed\n\nImao, H; Ishida, K; Kawamura, N; Matsuzaki, T; Matsuda, Y; Toyoda, A; Strasser, P; Iwasaki, M; Nagamine, K\n\n2008-05-01\n\nA negative muon in hydrogen targets, e.g., D2 or D-T mixture, can catalyze nuclear fusions following a series of atomic processes involving muonic hydrogen molecular formation (muon-catalyzed fusion, muCF). The ortho-para state of D2 is a crucial parameter not only for enhancing the fusion rate but also to precisely investigate various muonic atom processes. We have developed a system for controlling and measuring the ortho-para ratio of D2 gas for muCF experiments. We successfully collected para-enriched D2 without using liquid-hydrogen coolant. Ortho-enriched D2 was also obtained by using a catalytic conversion method with a mixture of chromium oxide and alumina. The ortho-para ratio of D2 gas was measured with a compact Raman spectroscopy system. We produced large volume (5-30 l at STP), high-purity (less than ppm high-Z contaminant) D2 targets with a wide range of ortho-para ratios (ortho 20%-99%). By using the ortho-para controlled D2 in muCF experiments, we observed the dependence of muCF phenomena on the ortho-para ratio.\n\nCatalyzed D-D stellarator reactor\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSheffield, John; Spong, Donald A.\n\nThe advantages of using the catalyzed deuterium-deuterium (D-D) approach for a fusion reactorâlower and less energetic neutron flux and no need for a tritium breeding blanketâhave been evaluated in previous papers, giving examples of both tokamak and stellarator reactors.

Our improved analysis includes hyperfine effects and allows a clear separation of intrinsic dt sticking Ïs from kinetic effects. Strongly density-dependent cycle rates with values up to 1.45Ã108 s-1, yields of 113 fusions per muon, and Ïs=(0.45+/-0.05)% are found. In comparison with previous experiments we confirm that Ïs in liquid is lower than theoretically predicted, but do not find a strong dependence on either ct or density.\n\nMuon Catalyzed Fusion\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nArmour, Edward A.G.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nMuon catalyzed fusion is a process in which a negatively charged muon combines with two nuclei of isotopes of hydrogen, e.g, a proton and a deuteron or a deuteron and a triton, to form a muonic molecular ion in which the binding is so tight that nuclear fusion occurs. The muon is normally released after fusion has taken place and so can catalyze further fusions. As the muon has a mean lifetime of 2.2 microseconds, this is the maximum period over which a muon can participate in this process. This article gives an outline of the history of muon catalyzed fusion from 1947, when it was first realised that such a process might occur, to the present day. It includes a description of the contribution that Drachrnan has made to the theory of muon catalyzed fusion and the influence this has had on the author's research.\n\nTemperature derivatives for fusion reactivity of D-D and D-T\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLangenbrunner, James R.; Makaruk, Hanna Ewa\n\nDeuterium-tritium (D-T) and deuterium-deuterium (D-D) fusion reaction rates are observable using leakage gamma flux. A direct measurement of Î³-rays with equipment that exhibits fast temporal response could be used to infer temperature, if the detector signal is amenable for taking the logarithmic time-derivative, alpha. We consider the temperature dependence for fusion cross section reactivity.\n\nMuon reactivation in muon-catalyzed D-T fusion\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRafelski, H. E.; MÃ¼ller, B.; Rafelski, J.; Trautmann, D.; Viollier, R. D.\n\nWe comprehensively reanalyze and search for the density dependence of the effective muon alpha sticking fraction Ïsff observed experimentally in muon catalyzed deuterium-tritium fusion. In our work particular emphasis has been put on the density dependent dense hydrogen stopping power. The main technical details and improvements in this work are: The (Î±Î¼) + 2s and 2p states are treated independently and are assigned individual reaction rates. The essential muonic excitation rates have been recalculated taking into account finite nuclear mass effects. The stopping power for a charged projectile in liquid heavy hydrogen is modified to account for dynamic screening effects and a density dependent effective ionization potential. It is shown that the medium dependent stopping power for the (Î±Î¼) + ion is the crucial factor controlling the density dependence of the effective sticking fraction. It is also pointed out that the muonic helium K Î± X-ray yield and the sticking fraction at high density can not be simultaneously brought into agreement with the experimental results without invoking novel mechanisms suppressing Stark mixing in the (HeÎ¼) L-shell.\n\nRadiation effect of neutrons produced by D-D side reactions on a D-3He fusion reactor\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBahmani, J.\n\n2017-04-01\n\nOne of the most important characteristics in D-3He fusion reactors is neutron production via D-D side reactions. The neutrons can activate structural material, degrading them and ultimately converting them into high-level radioactive waste, while it is really costly and difficult to remove them. The neutrons from a fusion reactor could also be used to make weapons-grade nuclear material, rendering such types of fusion reactors a serious proliferation hazard. A related problem is the presence of radioactive elements such as tritium in D-3He plasma, either as fuel for or as products of the nuclear reactions; substantial quantities of radioactive elements would not only pose a general health risk, but tritium in particular would also be another proliferation hazard. The problems of neutron radiation and radioactive element production are especially interconnected because both would result from the D-D side reaction. Therefore, the presentation approach for reducing neutrons via D-D nuclear side reactions in a D-3He fusion reactor is very important. For doing this research, energy losses and neutron power fraction in D-3He fusion reactors are investigated. Calculations show neutrons produced by the D-D nuclear side reaction could be reduced by changing to a more 3He-rich fuel mixture, but then the bremsstrahlung power loss fraction would increase in the D-3He fusion reactor.\n\nStrategy for D/He-3 fusion development\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSantarius, John F.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nIt is concluded that Deuterium/Helium-3 fusion faces a more difficult physics development path but an easier technology development path than does Deuterium/Tritium. Early D/He-3 tests in next generation D/T fusion experiments might provide a valuable D/He-3 proof-of-principle at modest cost. At least one high leverage alternate concept should be vigorously pursued. Space applications of D/He-3 fusion are critically important to large scale development.\n\nDifferences in 3D vs. 2D analysis in lumbar spinal fusion simulations.\n\nPubMed\n\nHsu, Hung-Wei; Bashkuev, Maxim; Pumberger, Matthias; Schmidt, Hendrik\n\n2018-04-27\n\nLumbar interbody fusion is currently the gold standard in treating patients with disc degeneration or segmental instability. Despite it having been used for several decades, the non-union rate remains high. A failed fusion is frequently attributed to an inadequate mechanical environment after instrumentation. Finite element (FE) models can provide insights into the mechanics of the fusion process. Previous fusion simulations using FE models showed that the geometries and material of the cage can greatly influence the fusion outcome. However, these studies used axisymmetric models which lacked realistic spinal geometries. Therefore, different modeling approaches were evaluated to understand the bone-formation process. Three FE models of the lumbar motion segment (L4-L5) were developed: 2D, Sym-3D and Nonsym-3D. The fusion process based on existing mechano-regulation algorithms using the FE simulations to evaluate the mechanical environment was then integrated into these models. In addition, the influence of different lordotic angles (5, 10 and 15Â°) was investigated. The volume of newly formed bone, the axial stiffness of the whole segment and bone distribution inside and surrounding the cage were evaluated. In contrast to the Nonsym-3D, the 2D and Sym-3D models predicted excessive bone formation prior to bridging (peak values with 36 and 9% higher than in equilibrium, respectively). The 3D models predicted a more uniform bone distribution compared to the 2D model. The current results demonstrate the crucial role of the realistic 3D geometry of the lumbar motion segment in predicting bone formation after lumbar spinal fusion. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The conventional 2D medical fusion methods can only fuse the 3D volume data layer by layer, which may lead to the loss of interframe correlative information. In this paper, a novel 3D medical volume fusion method based on 3D band limited shearlet transform (3D BLST) is proposed. And this method is evaluated upon MRI T2* and quantitative susceptibility mapping data of 4 human brains. Both the perspective impression and the quality indices indicate that the proposed method has a better performance than conventional 2D wavelet, DT CWT, and 3D wavelet, DT CWT based fusion methods.\n\nReview of 3d GIS Data Fusion Methods and Progress\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHua, Wei; Hou, Miaole; Hu, Yungang\n\n2018-04-01\n\n3D data fusion is a research hotspot in the field of computer vision and fine mapping, and plays an important role in fine measurement, risk monitoring, data display and other processes. At present, the research of 3D data fusion in the field of Surveying and mapping focuses on the 3D model fusion of terrain and ground objects. This paper summarizes the basic methods of 3D data fusion of terrain and ground objects in recent years, and classified the data structure and the establishment method of 3D model, and some of the most widely used fusion methods are analysed and commented.\n\nFramework for 2D-3D image fusion of infrared thermography with preoperative MRI.\n\nPubMed\n\nHoffmann, Nico; Weidner, Florian; Urban, Peter; Meyer, Tobias; Schnabel, Christian; Radev, Yordan; Schackert, Gabriele; Petersohn, Uwe; Koch, Edmund; Gumhold, Stefan; Steiner, Gerald; Kirsch, Matthias\n\n2017-11-27\n\nMultimodal medical image fusion combines information of one or more images in order to improve the diagnostic value. While previous applications mainly focus on merging images from computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonic and single-photon emission computed tomography, we propose a novel approach for the registration and fusion of preoperative 3D MRI with intraoperative 2D infrared thermography. Image-guided neurosurgeries are based on neuronavigation systems, which further allow us track the position and orientation of arbitrary cameras. Hereby, we are able to relate the 2D coordinate system of the infrared camera with the 3D MRI coordinate system. The registered image data are now combined by calibration-based image fusion in order to map our intraoperative 2D thermographic images onto the respective brain surface recovered from preoperative MRI. In extensive accuracy measurements, we found that the proposed framework achieves a mean accuracy of 2.46 mm.\n\nBeta-D-xylosidase from Selenomonas ruminantium: thermodynamics of enzyme-catalyzed and noncatalyzed reactions\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nBeta-D-xylosidase/alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase from Selenomonas ruminantium (SXA) is the most active enzyme known for catalyzing hydrolysis of 1,4-beta-D-xylooligosaccharides to D-xylose.

N.\n\n2003-04-02\n\nBoron-neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is an experimental radiation treatment modality used for highly malignant tumor treatments. Prior to irradiation with low energetic neutrons, a 10B compound is located selectively in the tumor cells. The effect of the treatment is based on the high LET radiation released in the {sup 10}B(n,{alpha}){sup 7}Li reaction with thermal neutrons. BNCT has been used experimentally for brain tumor and melanoma treatments. Lately applications of other severe tumor type treatments have been introduced. Results have shown that liver tumors can also be treated by BNCT. At Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, various compact neutron generators based onmoreÂ Â» D-D or D-T fusion reactions are being developed. The earlier theoretical studies of the D-D or D-T fusion reaction based neutron generators have shown that the optimal moderator and reflector configuration for brain tumor BNCT can be created. In this work, the applicability of 2.5 MeV neutrons for liver tumor BNCT application was studied. The optimal neutron energy for external liver treatments is not known. Neutron beams of different energies (1eV < E < 100 keV) were simulated and the dose distribution in the liver was calculated with the MCNP simulation code. In order to obtain the optimal neutron energy spectrum with the D-D neutrons, various moderator designs were performed using MCNP simulations. In this article the neutron spectrum and the optimized beam shaping assembly for liver tumor treatments is presented.Â«Â less\n\nStandardized 2D ultrasound versus 3D/4D ultrasound and image fusion for measurement of aortic aneurysm diameter in follow-up after EVAR.\n\nPubMed\n\nPfister, Karin; Schierling, Wilma; Jung, Ernst Michael; Apfelbeck, Hanna; Hennersperger, Christoph; Kasprzak, Piotr M\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTo compare standardised 2D ultrasound (US) to the novel ultrasonographic imaging techniques 3D/4D US and image fusion (combined real-time display of B mode and CT scan) for routine measurement of aortic diameter in follow-up after endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR). 300 measurements were performed on 20 patients after EVAR by one experienced sonographer (3rd degree of the German society of ultrasound (DEGUM)) with a high-end ultrasound machine and a convex probe (1-5âMHz). An internally standardized scanning protocol of the aortic aneurysm diameter in B mode used a so called leading-edge method. In summary, five different US methods (2D, 3D free-hand, magnetic field tracked 3D - Curefabâ¢, 4D volume sweep, image fusion), each including contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), were used for measurement of the maximum aortic aneurysm diameter. Standardized 2D sonography was the defined reference standard for statistical analysis. CEUS was used for endoleak detection. Technical success was 100%. In augmented transverse imaging the mean aortic anteroposterior (AP) diameter was 4.0Â±1.3âcm for 2D US, 4.0Â±1.2âcm for 3D Curefabâ¢, and 3.9Â±1.3âcm for 4D US and 4.0Â±1.2 for image fusion. The mean differences were below 1âmm (0.2-0.9âmm). Concerning estimation of aneurysm growth, agreement was found between 2D, 3D and 4D US in 19 of the 20 patients (95%). Definitive decision could always be made by image fusion. CEUS was combined with all methods and detected two out of the 20 patients (10%) with an endoleak type II. In one case, endoleak feeding arteries remained unclear with 2D CEUS but could be clearly localized by 3D CEUS and image fusion. Standardized 2D US allows adequate routine follow-up of maximum aortic aneurysm diameter after EVAR. Image Fusion enables a definitive statement about aneurysm growth without the need for new CT imaging by combining the postoperative CT scan with real-time B mode in a dual image display. 3D/4D CEUS and image fusion\n\nÎ¼ CF Study of D/T and H/D/T Mixtures in Homogeneous and Inhomogeneous Medium, and Comparison of Their Fusion Yields\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEskandari, M. R.; Faghihi, F.; Gheisari, R.\n\nMuon reactivation coefficient are determined for muonic He (He = 42He = Î± , He = 23 He = h) for up to six (n = 1, 2, 3, ..., 6) states of formation and at temperature Tp = 100 eV and for various relative ion densities. In the next decade it may be possible to explore new conditions for further energy gain in muon catalyzed fusion system, Î¼ CF, using nonuniform (temperature and density) plasma states. Here, we have considered a model for inhomogeneous Î¼ CF for mixtures of D/T and H/D/T. Using coupled dynamical equations it is shown that the neutrons yield per muon injection, Yn (neutrons/muon), in the dt branch of an inhomogeneous H/D/T mixture is at least 2.24 times higher than similar homogeneous systems and this rate for a D/T mixture is 1.92. Also, we have compared the neutron yield in the dt branch of homogeneous D/T and H/D/T mixtures (temperature range T = 300-800 K, and density Ï = 1 LHD). It is shown that Yn(D/T)/Yn(H/D/T) = 1.32, which is in good agreement with recently measured experimental values. In other words our calculations show that the addition of protonium to a D/T mixture leads to a significant decrease in the cycling rate for the physical conditions described herein.\n\nAnalytic, empirical and delta method temperature derivatives of D-D and D-T fusion reactivity formulations, as a means of verification\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLangenbrunner, James R.; Booker, Jane M.\n\nWe examine the derivatives with respect to temperature, for various deuterium-tritium (DT) and deuterium-deuterium (D-D) fusion-reactivity formulations.

Presently, we consider the temperature derivative dependence of fusion reactivity as a means of exercising and verifying the consistency of the various reactivity formulations.\n\nEvaluation of a UCMK/dCK fusion enzyme for gemcitabine-mediated cytotoxicity\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nJohnson, Adam J.; Brown, Melissa N.; Black, Margaret E., E-mail: blackm@vetmed.wsu.edu\n\n2011-12-09\n\nHighlights: Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Goal was to enhance dFdC cytotoxicity by the creation of a UCMK/dCK fusion enzyme. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The UCMK/dCK fusion enzyme possesses both native activities. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer The fusion renders cells equally sensitive to dFdC relative to dCK expression alone. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Dual activities of fusion not sufficient to augment cell dFdC sensitivity in vitro. Black-Right-Pointing-Pointer Data may warrant the implementation of UCMK mutagenesis studies. -- Abstract: While gemcitabine (2 Prime -2 Prime -difluoro-2 Prime -deoxycytidine, dFdC) displays wide-ranging antineoplastic activity as a single agent, variable response rates and poor intracellular metabolism often limit its clinical efficacy. In an effort to enhancemoreÂ Â» dFdC cytotoxicity and help normalize response rates, we created a bifunctional fusion enzyme that combines the enzymatic activities of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) and uridine/cytidine monophosphate kinase (UCMK) in a single polypeptide. Our goal was to evaluate whether the created fusion could induce beneficial, functional changes toward dFdC, expedite dFdC conversion to its active antimetabolites and consequently amplify cell dFdC sensitivity. While kinetic analyses revealed the UCMK/dCK fusion enzyme to possess both native activities, the fusion rendered cells sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of dFdC at the same level as dCK expression alone. These results suggest that increased wild-type UCMK expression does not provide a significant enhancement in dFdC-mediated cytotoxicity and may warrant the implementation of studies aimed at engineering UCMK variants with improved activity toward gemcitabine monophosphate.Â«Â less\n\nAssessing the Regioselectivity of OleD-Catalyzed Glycosylation with a Diverse Set of Acceptors\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhou, Maoquan; Hamza, Adel; Zhan, Chang-Guo; Thorson, Jon S.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nTo explore the acceptor regioselectivity of OleD-catalyzed glucosylation, the products of OleD-catalyzed reactions with the six structurally diverse acceptors - flavones (daidzein), isoflavones (flavopiridol), stilbenes (resveratrol), indole alkaloids (10-hydroxycamptothecin), and steroids (2-methoxyestradiol) - were determined. This study highlights the first synthesis of flavopiridol and 2-methoxyestradiol glucosides and confirms the ability of OleD to glucosylate both aromatic and aliphatic nucleophiles. In all cases, molecular dynamics simulations were consistent with the determined product distribution and suggest the potential to develop a virtual screening model to identify additional OleD substrates.

Phantoms, consisting of water, contrast agent, and agarose, were manufactured. The volume was measured using 3D US, CT, and MR devices. A CT-3D US and MR-3D US image fusion software was developed using the Insight Toolkit library in order to acquire three-dimensional fusion images. The quality of the image fusion was evaluated using metric value and fusion images. Volume measurement, using 3D US, shows a 2.8 Â± 1.5% error, 4.4 Â± 3.0% error for CT, and 3.1 Â± 2.0% error for MR. The results imply that volume measurement using the 3D US devices has a similar accuracy level to that of CT and MR. Three-dimensional image fusion of CT-3D US and MR-3D US was successfully performed using phantom images. Moreover, MR-3D US image fusion was performed using human bladder images. 3D US could be used in the volume measurement of human bladders and prostates. CT-3D US image fusion could be used in monitoring the target position in each fraction of external beam radiation therapy. Moreover, the feasibility of replacing the CT-MR image fusion to the CT-3D US in radiotherapy treatment planning was verified.\n\n\"3D fusion\" echocardiography improves 3D left ventricular assessment: comparison with 2D contrast echocardiography.\n\nPubMed\n\nAugustine, Daniel; Yaqub, Mohammad; Szmigielski, Cezary; Lima, Eduardo; Petersen, Steffen E; Becher, Harald; Noble, J Alison; Leeson, Paul\n\n2015-02-01\n\nThree-dimensional fusion echocardiography (3DFE) is a novel postprocessing approach that utilizes imaging data acquired from multiple 3D acquisitions. We assessed image quality, endocardial border definition, and cardiac wall motion in patients using 3DFE compared to standard 3D images (3D) and results obtained with contrast echocardiography (2DC). Twenty-four patients (mean age 66.9 Â± 13 years, 17 males, 7 females) undergoing 2DC had three, noncontrast, 3D apical volumes acquired at rest. Images were fused using an automated image fusion approach. Quality of the 3DFE was compared to both 3D and 2DC based on contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and endocardial border definition. We then compared clinical wall-motion score index (WMSI) calculated from 3DFE and 3D to those obtained from 2DC images. Fused 3D volumes had significantly improved CNR (8.92 Â± 1.35 vs. 6.59 Â± 1.19, P < 0.0005) and segmental image quality (2.42 Â± 0.99 vs. 1.93 Â± 1.18, P < 0.005) compared to unfused 3D acquisitions. Levels achieved were closer to scores for 2D contrast images (CNR: 9.04 Â± 2.21, P = 0.6; segmental image quality: 2.91 Â± 0.37, P < 0.005). WMSI calculated from fused 3D volumes did not differ significantly from those obtained from 2D contrast echocardiography (1.06 Â± 0.09 vs. 1.07 Â± 0.15, P = 0.69), whereas unfused images produced significantly more variable results (1.19 Â± 0.30). This was confirmed by a better intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 0.72; 95% CI 0.32-0.88) relative to comparisons with unfused images (ICC 0.56; 95% CI 0.02-0.81). 3DFE significantly improves left ventricular image quality compared to unfused 3D in a patient population and allows noncontrast assessment of wall motion that approaches that achieved with 2D contrast echocardiography.

Rats randomized to four levels of Vitamin D adjusted rat chow, longitudinal serum validation, surgeons/observers blinded to dietary conditions, and rats followed prospectively for fusion endpoint. Objective To assess the impact of dietary and serum levels of Vitamin D on fusion success, consolidation of fusion mass, and biomechanical stiffness after posterolateral spinal fusion procedure. Summary of Background Data Metabolic risk factors, including vitamin D insufficiency, are often overlooked by spine surgeons. Currently there are no published data on the causal effect of insufficient or deficient vitamin D levels on the success of establishing solid bony union after a spinal fusion procedure. Methods 50 rats were randomized to four experimentally controlled rat chow diets: normal control, vitamin D-deficient, vitamin-D insufficient, and a non-toxic high dose of vitamin D, four weeks prior to surgery and maintained post-surgery until sacrifice. Serum levels of 25(OH)D were determined at surgery and sacrifice using radioimmunoassay. Posterolateral fusion surgery with tail autograft was performed. Rats were sacrificed 12 weeks post-operatively and fusion was evaluated via manual palpation, high resolution radiographs, Î¼CT, and biomechanical testing. Results Serum 25(OH)D and calcium levels were significantly correlated with vitamin-D adjusted chow (p<0.001). There was a dose dependent relationship between vitamin D adjusted chow and manual palpation fusion with greatest differences found in measures of radiographic density between high and deficient vitamin D (p<0.05). Adequate levels of vitamin D (high and normal control) yielded stiffer fusion than inadequate levels (insufficient and deficient) (p<0.05). Conclusions Manual palpation fusion rates increased with supplementation of dietary vitamin D.

The presence of D-amino acids in PG is a hallmark of bacteria. Chlamydiaceae do not appear to encode amino acid racemases however, a D-alanyl-D-alanine (D-Ala-D-Ala) ligase homologue (Ddl) is encoded in the genome. Thus, we undertook a genetics-based approach to demonstrate and characterize the D-Ala-D-Ala ligase activity of chlamydial Ddl, a protein encoded as a fusion with MurC. The full-length murC-ddl fusion gene from Chlamydia trachomatis serovar L2 was cloned and placed under the control of the arabinose-inducible ara promoter and transformed into a D-Ala-D-Ala ligase auxotroph of Escherichia coli possessing deletions of both the ddlA and ddlB genes. Viability of the E. coliDeltaddlADeltaddlB mutant in the absence of exogenous D-Ala-D-Ala dipeptide became dependent on the expression of the chlamydial murC-ddl thus demonstrating functional ligase activity. Domain mapping of the full-length fusion protein and site-directed mutagenesis of the MurC domain revealed that the structure of the full fusion protein but not MurC enzymatic activity was required for ligase activity in vivo. Recombinant MurC-Ddl exhibited substrate specificity for D-Ala. Chlamydia growth is inhibited by D-cycloserine (DCS) and in vitro analysis provided evidence for the chlamydial MurC-Ddl as the target for DCS sensitivity. In vivo sensitivity to DCS could be reversed by addition of exogenous D-Ala and D-Ala-D-Ala. Together, these findings further support our hypothesis that PG is synthesized by members of the Chlamydiaceae family and suggest that D-amino acids, specifically D-Ala, are present in chlamydial PG.\n\nStereochemical analysis of the elimination reaction catalyzed by D-amino-acid oxidase.\n\nPubMed\n\nCheung, Y F; Walsh, C\n\n1976-06-01\n\nThe stereochemistry of the intramolecular proton transfer catalyzed by the flavoenzyme, D-amino-acid oxidase, during the elimination reaction of beta-chloro-alpha-amino acid substrates (Walsh et al. (1973), J. Biol. Chem. 248, 1964) has been established. Both D-erythro- and D-threo-2-amino-3-chloro(2-3H) butyrate have been shown to yield (3R)-2-keto (3-3H)-2- butyrate predominantly. Tritium kinetic isotope effects on the rate of the reaction (4.7 for the D-erythro, and 3.8 for the D-threo compound) and percentages of intramolecular triton transfer (7.2% for the D-erythro- and 2.6% for the D-threo compound) have been measured. Their implications on the mechanism of this unusual elimination reaction are discussed.\n\nIntroduction to D-He(3) fusion reactors\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nVlases, G.

In addition, the general design features of D-He(3) tokamaks and field reversed configuration (FRC) reactors are described and the relative merits of each are compared. It is concluded that both tokamaks and FRC's offer certain advantages, and that the ultimate decision as to which to persue for terrestrial power generation will depend heavily on how the physics performance of each of them develops over the next few years. It is clear that the D-He(3) fuel cycle offers marked advantages over the D-T cycle. Although the physics requirements for D-He(3) are more demanding, the overwhelming advantages resulting from the two order of magnitude reduction of neutron flux are expected to lead to a shorter time to commercialization than for the D-T cycle.\n\nIntroduction to D-He(3) fusion reactors\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVlases, G.

Unfortunately, low-cost depth sensors are prone to produce undesirable estimation noise in depth measurements which result in either depth outliers or introduce surface deformations in the reconstructed model. Conventional 3D fusion frameworks integrate multiple error-prone depth measurements over time to reduce noise effects, therefore additional constraints such as steady sensor movement and high frame-rates are required for high quality 3D models. In this paper we propose a generic 3D fusion framework with controlled regularization parameter which inherently reduces noise at the time of data fusion. This allows the proposed framework to generate high quality 3D models without enforcing additional constraints. Evaluation of the reconstructed 3D models shows that the proposed framework outperforms state of art techniques in terms of both absolute reconstruction error and processing time.\n\nConceptual design of fast-ignition laser fusion reactor FALCON-D\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGoto, T.; Someya, Y.; Ogawa, Y.; Hiwatari, R.; Asaoka, Y.; Okano, K.; Sunahara, A.; Johzaki, T.\n\n2009-07-01\n\nA new conceptual design of the laser fusion power plant FALCON-D (Fast-ignition Advanced Laser fusion reactor CONcept with a Dry wall chamber) has been proposed. The fast-ignition method can achieve sufficient fusion gain for a commercial operation (~100) with about 10 times smaller fusion yield than the conventional central ignition method. FALCON-D makes full use of this property and aims at designing with a compact dry wall chamber (5-6 m radius). 1D/2D simulations by hydrodynamic codes showed a possibility of achieving sufficient gain with a laser energy of 400 kJ, i.e. a 40 MJ target yield. The design feasibility of the compact dry wall chamber and the solid breeder blanket system was shown through thermomechanical analysis of the dry wall and neutronics analysis of the blanket system. Moderate electric output (~400 MWe) can be achieved with a high repetition (30 Hz) laser. This dry wall reactor concept not only reduces several difficulties associated with a liquid wall system but also enables a simple cask maintenance method for the replacement of the blanket system, which can shorten the maintenance period. The basic idea of the maintenance method for the final optics system has also been proposed. Some critical R&D issues required for this design are also discussed.\n\nSoft Fusion Energy Path: Isotope Production in Energy Subcritical/Economy Hypercritical D +D Colliding-Beam Mini Fusion Reactor `Exyder'\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHester, Tim; Maglich, Bogdan; Calsec Collaboration\n\n2015-03-01\n\nBethe1 and Sakharov2 argued for soft fusion energy path via isotope production, substantiated by Manheimer3. - Copious T and 3He production4 , 5 from D(d, p) T and D(d, n) 3He reactions in 725 KeV D +D colliding beams was measured in weak-focusing Self-Collider6 , 7 radius 0.15 m, in B = 3.12 T, non-linearly stabilized by electron cloud oscillations8 to confinement time = 24 s.

Alkaline phosphatases were found to have comparable reactivities towards the optical isomers. On the other hand, both acid phosphatases displayed a marked stereoselectivity, hydrolyzing the L-ester much faster than its D counterpart. Wheat germ acid phosphatase was the most stereoselective enzyme: V(L)/V(D) = 24 and K(m,L)/K(m,D) = 0.17. This enzyme was immobilized (in k-carrageenan gel, followed by crosslinking with glutaraldehyde) and used for the preparative resolution of D,L-threonine: the latter was first chemically O-phosphorylated and then asymmetrically hydrolyzed by the immobilized phosphatase. As a result, gram quantities of L-threonine of high optical purity and O-phospho-D-threonine were prepared. Immobilized wheat germ phosphatase has been tested for the resolution of other racemic alcohols: serine, 2-amino-1-butanol, 1-amino-2-propanol, 2-octanol, and menthol. In all those cases, the enzyme was either not sufficiently stereoselective or too slow for preparative resolutions.\n\nExperimental search for the radiative capture reaction d + d {yields} {sup 4}He + {gamma} from the dd{mu} muonic molecule state J = 1\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBaluev, V.

A CT scan and stereophotography were performed. The 3D CT models were reconstructed by Materialise Mimics software, and the stereophotogrammetric facial surface was reconstructed by 3 dMD patient software. All 3D CT models were exported as Stereo Lithography file format, and the 3 dMD model was exported as Virtual Reality Modeling Language file format. Image registration and fusion were performed in Mimics software. Genetic algorithm was used for precise image fusion alignment with minimum error. The 3D CT models and the 3 dMD stereophotogrammetric facial surface were finally merged into a single file and displayed using Deep Exploration software. Errors between the CT soft tissue model and 3 dMD facial surface were also analyzed. Virtual model based on CT-3 dMD image fusion clearly showed the photorealistic face and bone structures. Image registration errors in virtual face are mainly located in bilateral cheeks and eyeballs, and the errors are more than 1.5 mm. However, the image fusion of whole point cloud sets of CT and 3 dMD is acceptable with a minimum error that is less than 1 mm. The ease of use and high reliability of CT-3 dMD image fusion allows the 3D virtual head to be an accurate, realistic, and widespread tool, and has a great benefit to virtual face model.\n\nFusion of multi-spectral and panchromatic images based on 2D-PWVD and SSIM\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTan, Dongjie; Liu, Yi; Hou, Ruonan; Xue, Bindang\n\n2016-03-01\n\nA combined method using 2D pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution (2D-PWVD) and structural similarity(SSIM) index is proposed for fusion of low resolution multi-spectral (MS) image and high resolution panchromatic (PAN) image. First, the intensity component of multi-spectral image is extracted with generalized IHS transform. Then, the spectrum diagrams of the intensity components of multi-spectral image and panchromatic image are obtained with 2D-PWVD. Different fusion rules are designed for different frequency information of the spectrum diagrams. SSIM index is used to evaluate the high frequency information of the spectrum diagrams for assigning the weights in the fusion processing adaptively. After the new spectrum diagram is achieved according to the fusion rule, the final fusion image can be obtained by inverse 2D-PWVD and inverse GIHS transform. Experimental results show that, the proposed method can obtain high quality fusion images.\n\n3D Image Fusion to Localise Intercostal Arteries During TEVAR.\n\nPubMed\n\nKoutouzi, G; SandstrÃ¶m, C; Skoog, P; Roos, H; Falkenberg, M\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPreservation of intercostal arteries during thoracic aortic procedures reduces the risk of post-operative paraparesis. The origins of the intercostal arteries are visible on pre-operative computed tomography angiography (CTA), but rarely on intra-operative angiography. The purpose of this report is to suggest an image fusion technique for intra-operative localisation of the intercostal arteries during thoracic endovascular repair (TEVAR). The ostia of the intercostal arteries are identified and manually marked with rings on the pre-operative CTA. The optimal distal landing site in the descending aorta is determined and marked, allowing enough length for an adequate seal and attachment without covering more intercostal arteries than necessary. After 3D/3D fusion of the pre-operative CTA with an intra-operative cone-beam CT (CBCT), the markings are overlaid on the live fluoroscopy screen for guidance. The accuracy of the overlay is confirmed with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and the overlay is adjusted when needed. Stent graft deployment is guided by the markings. The initial experience of this technique in seven patients is presented. 3D image fusion was feasible in all cases. Follow-up CTA after 1 month revealed that all intercostal arteries planned for preservation, were patent. None of the patients developed signs of spinal cord ischaemia. 3D image fusion can be used to localise the intercostal arteries during TEVAR. This may preserve some intercostal arteries and reduce the risk of post-operative spinal cord ischaemia.\n\n[Construction and expression of HSV-2gD-Hsp70 fusion protein gene].\n\nPubMed\n\nFan, Jian-Yong; Yang, Hui-Lan; Wang, Ying; Guan, Lei\n\n2006-11-01\n\nTo construct and express Hsp70-HSV2gD fusion protein. Genes of Hsp70 and HSV-2gD were subcloned into vectors pGEX-4T-1 respectively. After confirmed by DNA sequence analysis, the recombinant plasmids pGEX-4T-HSP-gD was transformed into E. coli DH5alpha and induced to express with IPTG. The expressed protein was characterized by SDS-PAGE and Western blot after purified. BALB/c mice were immunized with fusion proteins respectively via intra-m uscular injection. The proliferation of spleen lymphocytes, the level of y-IFN in culture and anti-HSV-2gD IgG antibody in serum was detected was detected. The expressed protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE after induced with IPTG, which showed a new band with an apparent molecular mass corresponding to the predicted size (118 kD). Western Blotting analysis demonstrates that the purified Hsp70-HSV2gD fusion protein had specific binding activity. The stimulation indexes of spleen lymphocytes, the level of gamma-IFN in culture and anti-HSV-2gD IgG antibody in serum of GST-Hsp70-gD group was obviously higher than that of other groups (P < 0.05 respectively). The successful expression of the Hsp70-HSV2gD fusion protein, which can induce immune responses, laid a solid foundation for its further research.\n\nStatus of fusion research and implications for D/He-3 systems\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMiley, George H.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nWorld wide programs in both magnetic confinement and inertial confinement fusion research have made steady progress towards the experimental demonstration of energy breakeven. However, after breakeven is achieved, considerable time and effort must still be expended to develop a usable power plant. The main program described is focused on Deuterium-Tritium devices. In magnetic confinement, three of the most promising high beta approaches with a reasonable experimental data base are the Field Reversed Configuration, the high field tokamak, and the dense Z-pinch. The situation is less clear in inertial confinement where the first step requires an experimental demonstration of D/T spark ignition. It appears that fusion research has reached a point in time where an R and D plan to develop a D/He-3 fusion reactor can be laid out with some confidence of success.\n\nStem cells catalyze cartilage formation by neonatal articular chondrocytes in 3D biomimetic hydrogels.\n\nPubMed\n\nLai, Janice H; Kajiyama, Glen; Smith, Robert Lane; Maloney, William; Yang, Fan\n\n2013-12-19\n\nCartilage loss is a leading cause of disability among adults and effective therapy remains elusive. Neonatal chondrocytes (NChons) are an attractive allogeneic cell source for cartilage repair, but their clinical translation has been hindered by scarce donor availability. Here we examine the potential for catalyzing cartilage tissue formation using a minimal number of NChons by co-culturing them with adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) in 3D hydrogels. Using three different co-culture models, we demonstrated that the effects of co-culture on cartilage tissue formation are dependent on the intercellular distance and cell distribution in 3D. Unexpectedly, increasing ADSC ratio in mixed co-culture led to increased synergy between NChons and ADSCs, and resulted in the formation of large neocartilage nodules. This work raises the potential of utilizing stem cells to catalyze tissue formation by neonatal chondrocytes via paracrine signaling, and highlights the importance of controlling cell distribution in 3D matrices to achieve optimal synergy.\n\nNovel Three-Dimensional Image Fusion Software to Facilitate Guidance of Complex Cardiac Catheterization : 3D image fusion for interventions in CHD.\n\nPubMed\n\nGoreczny, Sebastian; Dryzek, Pawel; Morgan, Gareth J; Lukaszewski, Maciej; Moll, Jadwiga A; Moszura, Tomasz\n\n2017-08-01\n\nWe report initial experience with novel three-dimensional (3D) image fusion software for guidance of transcatheter interventions in congenital heart disease. Developments in fusion imaging have facilitated the integration of 3D roadmaps from computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging datasets. The latest software allows live fusion of two-dimensional (2D) fluoroscopy with pre-registered 3D roadmaps. We reviewed all cardiac catheterizations guided with this software (Philips VesselNavigator). Pre-catheterization imaging and catheterization data were collected focusing on fusion of 3D roadmap, intervention guidance, contrast and radiation exposure. From 09/2015 until 06/2016, VesselNavigator was applied in 34 patients for guidance (nÂ =Â 28) or planning (nÂ =Â 6) of cardiac catheterization. In all 28 patients successful 2D-3D registration was performed. Bony structures combined with the cardiovascular silhouette were used for fusion in 26 patients (93%), calcifications in 9 (32%), previously implanted devices in 8 (29%) and low-volume contrast injection in 7 patients (25%). Accurate initial 3D roadmap alignment was achieved in 25 patients (89%). Six patients (22%) required realignment during the procedure due to distortion of the anatomy after introduction of stiff equipment. Overall, VesselNavigator was applied successfully in 27 patients (96%) without any complications related to 3D image overlay. VesselNavigator was useful in guidance of nearly all of cardiac catheterizations. The combination of anatomical markers and low-volume contrast injections allowed reliable 2D-3D registration in the vast majority of patients.\n\nMultisensor fusion for 3D target tracking using track-before-detect particle filter\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMoshtagh, Nima; Romberg, Paul M.; Chan, Moses W.\n\n2015-05-01\n\nThis work presents a novel fusion mechanism for estimating the three-dimensional trajectory of a moving target using images collected by multiple imaging sensors. The proposed projective particle filter avoids the explicit target detection prior to fusion. In projective particle filter, particles that represent the posterior density (of target state in a high-dimensional space) are projected onto the lower-dimensional observation space. Measurements are generated directly in the observation space (image plane) and a marginal (sensor) likelihood is computed. The particles states and their weights are updated using the joint likelihood computed from all the sensors. The 3D state estimate of target (system track) is then generated from the states of the particles. This approach is similar to track-before-detect particle filters that are known to perform well in tracking dim and stealthy targets in image collections. Our approach extends the track-before-detect approach to 3D tracking using the projective particle filter. The performance of this measurement-level fusion method is compared with that of a track-level fusion algorithm using the projective particle filter. In the track-level fusion algorithm, the 2D sensor tracks are generated separately and transmitted to a fusion center, where they are treated as measurements to the state estimator. The 2D sensor tracks are then fused to reconstruct the system track. A realistic synthetic scenario with a boosting target was generated, and used to study the performance of the fusion mechanisms.\n\nBinding Energy and Catalysis by D-Xylose Isomerase: Kinetic, Product and X-Ray Crystallographic Analysis of Enzyme-Catalyzed Isomerization of (R)-Glyceraldehydeâ¡, Â¶\n\nPubMed Central\n\nToteva, Maria M.; Silvaggi, Nicholas R.; Allen, Karen N.; Richard, John P.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nD-Xylose isomerase (XI) and triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) catalyze the aldose-ketose isomerization reactions of D-xylose and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (DGAP), respectively. D-Glyceraldehyde (DGA) is the triose fragment common to the substrates for XI and TIM. The XI-catalyzed isomerization of DGA to give dihydroxyacetone (DHA) in D2O was monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy and kcat/Km = 0.034 Mâ1 sâ1 was determined for this isomerization at pD 7.0. This is similar to kcat/Km = 0.017 Mâ1 sâ1 for the TIM-catalyzed carbon deprotonation reaction of DGA in D2O at pD 7.0 [Amyes, T. L.; OâDonoghue, A. C. and Richard J. P. (2001) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 123, 11325â11326]. The much larger activation barrier for XI-catalyzed isomerization of D-xylose (kcat/Km = 490 Mâ1 sâ1) than for the TIM-catalyzed isomerization of DGAP (kcat/Km = 9.6 x 106 Mâ1 sâ1) is due to: (i) The larger barrier to conversion of cyclic D-xylose to the reactive linear sugar (5.4 kcal/mol) than for conversion of DGAP hydrate to the free aldehyde (1.7 kcal/mol). (ii) The smaller intrinsic binding energy [Jencks, W. P. (1975) Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 43, 219â410] of the terminal ethylene glycol fragment of D-xylose (9.3 kcal/mol) than of the phosphodianion group of DGAP (ca. 12 kcal/mol). The XI-catalyzed isomerization of DGA in D2O at pD 7.0 gives a 90% yield of [1-1H]-DHA and a 10% yield of [1-2H]-DHA, the product of isomerization with deuterium incorporation from solvent D2O. By comparison, the transfer of 3H from labeled hexose substrate to solvent is observed only once in every 109 turnovers for the XI-catalyzed isomerization of [2-3H]-glucose in H2O [Allen, K. N., Lavie, A., Farber, G. K., Glasfeld, A., Petsko, G. A., and Ringe, D. (1994), Biochemistry 33, 1481â1487]. We propose that truncation of the terminal ethylene glycol fragment of D-xylose to give DGA results in a large decrease in the rate of XI-catalyzed isomerization with hydride transfer compared with that\n\nImage Fusion and 3D Roadmapping in Endovascular Surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nJones, Douglas W; Stangenberg, Lars; Swerdlow, Nicholas J; Alef, Matthew; Lo, Ruby; Shuja, Fahad; Schermerhorn, Marc L\n\n2018-05-21\n\nPractitioners of endovascular surgery have historically utilized two-dimensional (2D) intraoperative fluoroscopic imaging, with intra-vascular contrast opacification, to treat complex three-dimensional (3D) pathology. Recently, major technical developments in intraoperative imaging have made image fusion techniques possible: the creation of a 3D patient-specific vascular roadmap based on preoperative imaging which aligns with intraoperative fluoroscopy, with many potential benefits. First, a 3D model is segmented from preoperative imaging, typically a CT scan. The model is then used to plan for the procedure, with placement of specific markers and storing of C-arm angles that will be used for intra-operative guidance. At the time of the procedure, an intraoperative cone-beam CT is performed and the 3D model is registered to the patient's on-table anatomy. Finally, the system is used for live guidance where the 3D model is codisplayed overlying fluoroscopic images. Copyright Â© 2018.

R.; Motevalli, S. M.\n\n2008-03-01\n\nThe muon catalyzed fusion cycle in mixtures of deuterium and tritium is of particular interest due to the observation of high fusion yields. In the D-T mixture, the most serious limitation to the efficiency of the fusion chain is the probability of muon sticking to the alpha -particle produced in the nuclear reaction. An accurate kinetic treatment has been applied to the muonic helium atoms formed by a muon sticking to the alpha -particles. In this work accurate rates for collisions of alpha mu + ions with hydrogen atoms have been used for calculation of muon stripping probability and the intensities of X-ray transitions by solving a set of coupled differential equations numerically. Our calculated results are in good agreement with experimental data available in literature.\n\nDepth and thermal sensor fusion to enhance 3D thermographic reconstruction.\n\nPubMed\n\nCao, Yanpeng; Xu, Baobei; Ye, Zhangyu; Yang, Jiangxin; Cao, Yanlong; Tisse, Christel-Loic; Li, Xin\n\n2018-04-02\n\nThree-dimensional geometrical models with incorporated surface temperature data provide important information for various applications such as medical imaging, energy auditing, and intelligent robots. In this paper we present a robust method for mobile and real-time 3D thermographic reconstruction through depth and thermal sensor fusion. A multimodal imaging device consisting of a thermal camera and a RGB-D sensor is calibrated geometrically and used for data capturing. Based on the underlying principle that temperature information remains robust against illumination and viewpoint changes, we present a Thermal-guided Iterative Closest Point (T-ICP) methodology to facilitate reliable 3D thermal scanning applications. The pose of sensing device is initially estimated using correspondences found through maximizing the thermal consistency between consecutive infrared images. The coarse pose estimate is further refined by finding the motion parameters that minimize a combined geometric and thermographic loss function. Experimental results demonstrate that complimentary information captured by multimodal sensors can be utilized to improve performance of 3D thermographic reconstruction. Through effective fusion of thermal and depth data, the proposed approach generates more accurate 3D thermal models using significantly less scanning data.\n\nGuided Interventions for Prostate Cancer Using 3D-Transurethral Ultrasound and MRI Fusion\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2015-10-01\n\nAWARD NUMBER: W81XWH-14-1-0461 TITLE: Guided Interventions for Prostate Cancer Using 3D-Transurethral Ultrasound and MRI Fusion PRINCIPAL...Sep 2014 - 28 Sep 2015 4.

Such a capability would, however, facilitate solving the problem of medical quantification, whose presence currently manifests itself within the entire healthcare system. Methods A generally applicable method to enhance captured 3D spatial data carrying temperature-related information is presented; in this context, all equations required for other data fusions are derived. The method can be utilized for high-density point clouds or detailed meshes at a high resolution but is conveniently usable in large objects with sparse points. Results The benefits of the approach are experimentally demonstrated on 3D thermal scans of injured subjects. We obtained diagnostic information inaccessible via traditional methods. Conclusion Using a 3D model and thermal image data fusion allows the quantification of inflammation, facilitating more precise injury and illness diagnostics or monitoring. The technique offers a wide application potential in medicine and multiple technological domains, including electrical and mechanical engineering.

Inhibition constants (K i ) or 50% inhibitory concentrations of six steroid hormones (cortisol, cortisone, corticosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, progesterone, and pregnenolone) and quinidine and quinine-typical potent inhibitors of the human CYP2D6 and rat CYP2D subfamily, respectively-toward dopamine formation catalyzed by CYP2D6.1, CYP2D6.2, and CYP2D6.10 expressed in recombinant Escherichia coli were compared. Although most steroid hormones had no or minor inhibitory effects on the dopamine formation by all CYP2D6 variants, progesterone inhibited the metabolism and K i value against CYP2D6.10 was approximately twice that for CYP2D6.1 and CYP2D6.2. Quinidine exhibited stronger inhibition than quinine; however, these two compounds inhibited the CYP2D6.10-mediated reaction more weakly than the CYP2D6.1 and CYP2D6.2 reactions. These results suggest that CYP2D6 polymorphism would affect drug interaction through dopamine formation in the brain. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to evaluate image quality and clinical feasibility of a prototype fusion device (fusion prototype) constructed from a standard tomosynthesis mammography unit and a standard 3D ultrasound probe using a new method of breast compression. Imaging was performed on 5 mastectomy specimens from patients with confirmed DCIS or invasive carcinoma (BI-RADS â¢ 6). For the preclinical fusion prototype an ABVS system ultrasound probe from an Acuson S2000 was integrated into a MAMMOMAT Inspiration (both Siemens Healthcare Ltd) and, with the aid of a newly developed compression plate, digital mammogram and automated 3D ultrasound images were obtained. The quality of digital mammogram images produced by the fusion prototype was comparable to those produced using conventional compression. The newly developed compression plate did not influence the applied x-ray dose. The method was not more labour intensive or time-consuming than conventional mammography. From the technical perspective, fusion of the two modalities was achievable. In this study, using only a few mastectomy specimens, the fusion of an automated 3D ultrasound machine with a standard mammography unit delivered images of comparable quality to conventional mammography. The device allows simultaneous ultrasound - the second important imaging modality in complementary breast diagnostics - without increasing examination time or requiring additional staff.\n\nTheoretical Study of the Effects of Di-Muonic Molecules on Muon-Catalyzed Fusion\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2012-03-01\n\nFor example, synthetic zeolites could be used to separate molecular isotopes of hydrogen [12; 10] as could thermal diffusion and gas chromatography... thermal muon flux is large (see Chapter 8).

The aims of our study were to evaluate its feasibility and clinical usefulness. Whole-body bone scintigraphy (WB) and SPECT/CT scans were performed in 318 cancer patients using a dedicated SPECT/CT systems. Volume data of bone SPECT and CT were fused to obtain 2D SPECT/CT images. To generate our 3D SPECT/CT images, colored voxel data of bone SPECT were projected onto the corresponding location of the volume-rendered CT data after a semi-automatic bone extraction. Then, the resultant 3D images were blended with conventional volume-rendered CT images, allowing to grasp the three-dimensional relationship between bone metabolism and anatomy. WB and SPECT (WBâ+âSPECT), 2D SPECT/CT fusion, and 3D SPECT/CT fusion were evaluated by two independent reviewers in the diagnosis of bone metastasis. The inter-observer variability and diagnostic accuracy in these three image sets were investigated using a four-point diagnostic scale. Increased bone metabolism was found in 744 metastatic sites and 1002 benign changes. On a per-lesion basis, inter-observer agreements in the diagnosis of bone metastasis were 0.72 for WBâ+âSPECT, 0.90 for 2D SPECT/CT, and 0.89 for 3D SPECT/CT. Receiver operating characteristic analyses for the diagnostic accuracy of bone metastasis showed that WBâ+âSPECT, 2D SPECT/CT, and 3D SPECT/CT had an area under the curve of 0.800, 0.983, and 0.983 for reader 1, 0.865, 0.992, and 0.993 for reader 2, respectively (WBâ+âSPECT vs. 2D or 3D SPECT/CT, pâ<â0.001; 2D vs. 3D SPECT/CT, n.s.).

Research targets two key goals. First, to prepare for ITER we must resolve how to use its flexible control tools to rapidly reach Q =10, and develop the scientific basis to interpret results from ITER for fusion projection. Second, we must determine how to sustain a high performance fusion core in steady state conditions, with minimal actuators and a plasma exhaust solution. DIII-D will target these missions with: (i) increased electron heating and balanced torque neutral beams to simulate burning plasma conditions (ii) new 3D coil arrays to resolve control of transients (iii) off axis current drive to study physics in steady state regimes (iv) divertors configurations to promote detachment with low upstream density (v) a reactor relevant wall to qualify materials and resolve physics in reactor-like conditions. With new diagnostics and leading edge simulation, this will position the US for success in ITER and a unique knowledge to accelerate the approach to fusion energy.

Reference cases for steady-state 1000 MWe reactors operating in H-mode in both the 1st stability regime and the 2nd stability regime were developed and assessed quantitatively. These devices would a very small aspect ratio (A=1,2), a major radius of about 2.0 m, an on-axis magnetic field less than 2 T, a large plasma current (80-120 MA) dominated by the bootstrap effect, and high plasma beta (greater than O.6). The estimated cost of electricity is in the range of 60-90 mills/kW-hr, assuming the use of a direct energy conversion system. The inherent safety and environmental advantages of D-He3 fusion indicate that this reactor concept could be competitive with advanced fission breeder reactors and large-scale solar electric plants by the end of the 21st century if research and development can produce the anticipated physics and technology advances.\n\nExperimental Test in a Tokamak of Fusion with Spin-Polarized D and 3He\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHonig, Arnold; Sandorfi, Andrew\n\n2007-06-01\n\nAn experiment to test polarization retention of highly polarized D and 3He fusion fuels prior to their fusion reactions in a tTokamak is in preparation. The fusion reaction rate with 100% vector polarized reactants is expected from simple theory to increase by a factor of 1.5. With presently available polarizations, fusion reaction enhancements of Ë15% are achievable and of significant interest, while several avenues for obtaining higher polarizations are open. The potential for survival of initial fusion fuel polarizations at Ë108 K plasma core temperatures (Ë5KeV) throughout the time interval preceding fusion burn was addressed in a seminal paper in 1982. While the positive conclusion from those calculations suggests that reaction enhancements are indeed feasible, this crucial factor has never been tested in a high temperature plasma core because of difficulties in preparation and injection of sufficiently polarized fusion fuels into a high temperature reactorfusion plasma. Our solution to these problems employs a new source of highly polarized D in the form of solid HD which has been developed and used in our laboratories. Solid HD is compatible with fusion physics in view of its simplicity of elemental composition and very long (weeks) relaxation times at 4K temperature, allowing efficient polarization-preserving cold-transfer operations. Containment and polarization of the HD within polymer capsules, similar to those used in inertial confinement fusion (ICF), is an innovation which simplifies the cold-transfer of polarized fuel from the dilution refrigerator polarization-production apparatus to other liquid helium temperature cryostats, for storage, transport and placement into the barrel of a cryogenic pellet gun for firing at high velocity into the reactor. The other polarized fuel partner, 3He, has been prepared as a polarized gas for applications including high-energy polarized targets and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. It will be introduced\n\nRapid fusion of 2D X-ray fluoroscopy with 3D multislice CT for image-guided electrophysiology procedures\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZagorchev, Lyubomir; Manzke, Robert; Cury, Ricardo; Reddy, Vivek Y.; Chan, Raymond C.\n\n2007-03-01\n\nInterventional cardiac electrophysiology (EP) procedures are typically performed under X-ray fluoroscopy for visualizing catheters and EP devices relative to other highly-attenuating structures such as the thoracic spine and ribs. These projections do not however contain information about soft-tissue anatomy and there is a recognized need for fusion of conventional fluoroscopy with pre-operatively acquired cardiac multislice computed tomography (MSCT) volumes. Rapid 2D-3D integration in this application would allow for real-time visualization of all catheters present within the thorax in relation to the cardiovascular anatomy visible in MSCT. We present a method for rapid fusion of 2D X-ray fluoroscopy with 3DMSCT that can facilitate EP mapping and interventional procedures by reducing the need for intra-operative contrast injections to visualize heart chambers and specialized systems to track catheters within the cardiovascular anatomy. We use hardware-accelerated ray-casting to compute digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) from the MSCT volume and iteratively optimize the rigid-body pose of the volumetric data to maximize the similarity between the MSCT-derived DRR and the intra-operative X-ray projection data.\n\nThe design of red-blue 3D video fusion system based on DM642\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFu, Rongguo; Luo, Hao; Lv, Jin; Feng, Shu; Wei, Yifang; Zhang, Hao\n\n2016-10-01\n\nAiming at the uncertainty of traditional 3D video capturing including camera focal lengths, distance and angle parameters between two cameras, a red-blue 3D video fusion system based on DM642 hardware processing platform is designed with the parallel optical axis. In view of the brightness reduction of traditional 3D video, the brightness enhancement algorithm based on human visual characteristics is proposed and the luminance component processing method based on YCbCr color space is also proposed. The BIOS real-time operating system is used to improve the real-time performance. The video processing circuit with the core of DM642 enhances the brightness of the images, then converts the video signals of YCbCr to RGB and extracts the R component from one camera, so does the other video and G, B component are extracted synchronously, outputs 3D fusion images finally. The real-time adjustments such as translation and scaling of the two color components are realized through the serial communication between the VC software and BIOS. The system with the method of adding red-blue components reduces the lost of the chrominance components and makes the picture color saturation reduce to more than 95% of the original. Enhancement algorithm after optimization to reduce the amount of data fusion in the processing of video is used to reduce the fusion time and watching effect is improved. Experimental results show that the system can capture images in near distance, output red-blue 3D video and presents the nice experiences to the audience wearing red-blue glasses.\n\nPerceptual Real-Time 2D-to-3D Conversion Using Cue Fusion.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeimkuhler, Thomas; Kellnhofer, Petr; Ritschel, Tobias; Myszkowski, Karol; Seidel, Hans-Peter\n\n2018-06-01\n\nWe propose a system to infer binocular disparity from a monocular video stream in real-time. Different from classic reconstruction of physical depth in computer vision, we compute perceptually plausible disparity, that is numerically inaccurate, but results in a very similar overall depth impression with plausible overall layout, sharp edges, fine details and agreement between luminance and disparity. We use several simple monocular cues to estimate disparity maps and confidence maps of low spatial and temporal resolution in real-time. These are complemented by spatially-varying, appearance-dependent and class-specific disparity prior maps, learned from example stereo images. Scene classification selects this prior at runtime. Fusion of prior and cues is done by means of robust MAP inference on a dense spatio-temporal conditional random field with high spatial and temporal resolution. Using normal distributions allows this in constant-time, parallel per-pixel work. We compare our approach to previous 2D-to-3D conversion systems in terms of different metrics, as well as a user study and validate our notion of perceptually plausible disparity.\n\nNonlinear three-dimensional verification of the SPECYL and PIXIE3D magnetohydrodynamics codes for fusion plasmas\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBonfiglio, D.; ChacÃ³n, L.; Cappello, S.\n\n2010-08-01\n\nWith the increasing impact of scientific discovery via advanced computation, there is presently a strong emphasis on ensuring the mathematical correctness of computational simulation tools.

A single membrane-bound enzyme was found to catalyze the conversion from DKGA to 4KA. The 92-kDa 4KAS was a homodimeric protein not requiring O2 or a cofactor for the conversion, but was stimulated by Mn(2+). N-terminal amino acid sequencing of 4KAS, followed by gene homology search indicated a 1,197-bp open reading frame (ORF), corresponding to the GLS_c04240 locus, GenBank accession No. CP004373, encoding a 398-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular weight of 42,818Â Da. An Escherichia coli transformant with the 4kas plasmid exhibited 4KAS activity. Furthermore, overexpressed recombinant 4KAS was purified in an electrophoretically homogenous state and had the same molecular size as the natural enzyme.\n\nSurgical planning and manual image fusion based on 3D model facilitate laparoscopic partial nephrectomy for intrarenal tumors.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Yuanbo; Li, Hulin; Wu, Dingtao; Bi, Keming; Liu, Chunxiao\n\n2014-12-01\n\nConstruction of three-dimensional (3D) model of renal tumor facilitated surgical planning and imaging guidance of manual image fusion in laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) for intrarenal tumors. Fifteen patients with intrarenal tumors underwent LPN between January and December 2012. Computed tomography-based reconstruction of the 3D models of renal tumors was performed using Mimics 12.1 software. Surgical planning was performed through morphometry and multi-angle visual views of the tumor model. Two-step manual image fusion superimposed 3D model images onto 2D laparoscopic images. The image fusion was verified by intraoperative ultrasound. Imaging-guided laparoscopic hilar clamping and tumor excision was performed. Manual fusion time, patient demographics, surgical details, and postoperative treatment parameters were analyzed. The reconstructed 3D tumor models accurately represented the patient's physiological anatomical landmarks. The surgical planning markers were marked successfully. Manual image fusion was flexible and feasible with fusion time of 6 min (5-7 min). All surgeries were completed laparoscopically. The median tumor excision time was 5.4 min (3.5-10 min), whereas the median warm ischemia time was 25.5 min (16-32 min). Twelve patients (80 %) demonstrated renal cell carcinoma on final pathology, and all surgical margins were negative. No tumor recurrence was detected after a media follow-up of 1 year (3-15 months). The surgical planning and two-step manual image fusion based on 3D model of renal tumor facilitated visible-imaging-guided tumor resection with negative margin in LPN for intrarenal tumor. It is promising and moves us one step closer to imaging-guided surgery.\n\nGuided Interventions for Prostate Cancer Using 3D-Transurethral Ultrasound and MRI Fusion\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2017-06-01\n\nstandard transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) probe, a TUUS probe, and MRI.

D.; Austin, M. E.; Groebner, R.; Manickam, J.; Rice, B.; Schmidt, G.; Snider, R.\n\n2000-12-01\n\nSawtooth phenomena have been studied on DIII-D and the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) [D. Meade and the TFTR Group, in Proceedings of the International Conference on Plasma Physics and Controlled Nuclear Fusion, Washington, DC, 1990 (International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, 1991), Vol. 1, pp. 9-24]. In the experiments the sawtooth characteristics were studied with fast electron temperature (ECE) and soft x-ray diagnostics. For the first time, measurements of a strong ballistic electron heat pulse were made in a shaped tokamak (DIII-D) [J. Luxon and DIII-D Group, in Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Plasma Physics and Controlled Nuclear Fusion Research, Kyoto (International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, 1987), Vol. 1, p. 159] and the \"ballistic effect\" was stronger than was previously reported on TFTR. Evidence is presented in this paper that the ballistic effect is related to the fast growth phase of the sawtooth precursor. Fast, 2 ms interval, measurements on DIII-D were made of the ion temperature evolution following sawteeth and partial sawteeth to document the ion heat pulse characteristics. It is found that the ion heat pulse does not exhibit the very fast, \"ballistic\" behavior seen for the electrons. Further, for the first time it is shown that the electron heat pulses from partial sawtooth crashes (on DIII-D and TFTR) are seen to propagate at speeds close to those expected from the power balance calculations of the thermal diffusivities whereas heat pulses from fishbones propagate at rates more consistent with sawtooth induced heat pulses. These results suggest that the fast propagation of sawtooth-induced heat pulses is not a feature of nonlinear transport models, but that magnetohydrodynamic events can have a strong effect on electron thermal transport.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI)-based relational matching and multimodal medical image fusion: generalized 3D approaches\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVajdic, Stevan M.; Katz, Henry E.; Downing, Andrew R.; Brooks, Michael J.\n\n1994-09-01\n\nA 3D relational image matching/fusion algorithm is introduced. It is implemented in the domain of medical imaging and is based on Artificial Intelligence paradigms--in particular, knowledge base representation and tree search. The 2D reference and target images are selected from 3D sets and segmented into non-touching and non-overlapping regions, using iterative thresholding and/or knowledge about the anatomical shapes of human organs. Selected image region attributes are calculated. Region matches are obtained using a tree search, and the error is minimized by evaluating a `goodness' of matching function based on similarities of region attributes. Once the matched regions are found and the spline geometric transform is applied to regional centers of gravity, images are ready for fusion and visualization into a single 3D image of higher clarity.\n\nMitochondrial remodeling following fission inhibition by 15d-PGJ2 involves molecular changes in mitochondrial fusion protein OPA1\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKar, Rekha; Department of Biochemistry, UT Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78229; Mishra, Nandita\n\n2010-09-03\n\nResearch highlights: {yields} Chemical inhibition of fission protein Drp1 leads to mitochondrial fusion. {yields} Increased fusion stimulates molecular changes in mitochondrial fusion protein OPA1. {yields} Proteolysis of larger isoforms, new synthesis and ubiquitination of OPA1 occur. {yields} Loss of mitochondrial tubular rigidity and disorganization of cristae. {yields} Generation of large swollen dysfunctional mitochondria. -- Abstract: We showed earlier that 15 deoxy {Delta}{sup 12,14} prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) inactivates Drp1 and induces mitochondrial fusion . However, prolonged incubation of cells with 15d-PGJ2 resulted in remodeling of fused mitochondria into large swollen mitochondria with irregular cristae structure. While initial fusion of mitochondria bymoreÂ Â» 15d-PGJ2 required the presence of both outer (Mfn1 and Mfn2) and inner (OPA1) mitochondrial membrane fusion proteins, later mitochondrial changes involved increased degradation of the fusion protein OPA1 and ubiquitination of newly synthesized OPA1 along with decreased expression of Mfn1 and Mfn2, which likely contributed to the loss of tubular rigidity, disorganization of cristae, and formation of large swollen degenerated dysfunctional mitochondria. Similar to inhibition of Drp1 by 15d-PGJ2, decreased expression of fission protein Drp1 by siRNA also resulted in the loss of fusion proteins. Prevention of 15d-PGJ2 induced mitochondrial elongation by thiol antioxidants prevented not only loss of OPA1 isoforms but also its ubiquitination. These findings provide novel insights into unforeseen complexity of molecular events that modulate mitochondrial plasticity.Â«Â less\n\nNumerical Analysis of 2-D and 3-D MHD Flows Relevant to Fusion Applications\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nKhodak, Andrei\n\n2017-08-21\n\nHere, the analysis of many fusion applications such as liquid-metal blankets requires application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods for electrically conductive liquids in geometrically complex regions and in the presence of a strong magnetic field. A current state of the art general purpose CFD code allows modeling of the flow in complex geometric regions, with simultaneous conjugated heat transfer analysis in liquid and surrounding solid parts. Together with a magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) capability, the general purpose CFD code will be a valuable tool for the design and optimization of fusion devices. This paper describes an introduction of MHD capability intomoreÂ Â» the general purpose CFD code CFX, part of the ANSYS Workbench.

For MHD adaptation of the code three additional transport equations were introduced for the components of the magnetic field, in addition to the Poisson equation for electric potential. The Lorentz force is included in the momentum transport equation as a source term. Fusion applications usually involve very strong magnetic fields, with values of the Hartmann number of up to tens of thousands. In this situation a system of MHD equations become very rigid with very large source terms and very strong variable gradients. To increase system robustness, special measures were introduced during the iterative convergence process, such as linearization using source coefficient for momentum equations. The MHD implementation in general purpose CFD code was tested against benchmarks, specifically selected for liquid-metal blanket applications. Results of numerical simulations using present implementation closely match analytical solutions for a Hartmann number of up to 1500 for a 2-D laminar flow in the duct of square cross section, with conducting and nonconducting walls\n\nNumerical Analysis of 2-D and 3-D MHD Flows Relevant to Fusion Applications\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nKhodak, Andrei\n\nHere, the analysis of many fusion applications such as liquid-metal blankets requires application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods for electrically conductive liquids in geometrically complex regions and in the presence of a strong magnetic field. A current state of the art general purpose CFD code allows modeling of the flow in complex geometric regions, with simultaneous conjugated heat transfer analysis in liquid and surrounding solid parts. Together with a magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) capability, the general purpose CFD code will be a valuable tool for the design and optimization of fusion devices.

The compound fire detector employs information fusion technology to judge and identify multiple fire characteristic parameters in order to improve the reliability and accuracy of fire detection. The D-S evidence theory is applied to the multi-sensor data-fusion: first normalize the data from all sensors to obtain the normalized basic probability function of the fire occurrence; then conduct the fusion processing using the D-S evidence theory; finally give the judgment results. The results show that the method meets the goal of accurate fire signal identification and increases the accuracy of fire alarm, and therefore is simple and effective.\n\nGenomic analyses identify recurrent MEF2D fusions in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGu, Zhaohui; Churchman, Michelle; Roberts, Kathryn; Li, Yongjin; Liu, Yu; Harvey, Richard C.; McCastlain, Kelly; Reshmi, Shalini C.; Payne-Turner, Debbie; Iacobucci, Ilaria; Shao, Ying; Chen, I-Ming; Valentine, Marcus; Pei, Deqing; Mungall, Karen L.; Mungall, Andrew J.; Ma, Yussanne; Moore, Richard; Marra, Marco; Stonerock, Eileen; Gastier-Foster, Julie M.; Devidas, Meenakshi; Dai, Yunfeng; Wood, Brent; Borowitz, Michael; Larsen, Eric E.; Maloney, Kelly; Mattano Jr, Leonard A.; Angiolillo, Anne; Salzer, Wanda L.; Burke, Michael J.; Gianni, Francesca; Spinelli, Orietta; Radich, Jerald P.; Minden, Mark D.; Moorman, Anthony V.; Patel, Bella; Fielding, Adele K.; Rowe, Jacob M.; Luger, Selina M.; Bhatia, Ravi; Aldoss, Ibrahim; Forman, Stephen J.; Kohlschmidt, Jessica; MrÃ³zek, Krzysztof; Marcucci, Guido; Bloomfield, Clara D.; Stock, Wendy; Kornblau, Steven; Kantarjian, Hagop M.; Konopleva, Marina; Paietta, Elisabeth; Willman, Cheryl L.; L.
