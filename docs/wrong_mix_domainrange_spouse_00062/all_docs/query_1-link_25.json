Backed by a large body of recent, credible scientific evidence, regional-wide consultations and a robust intergovernmental process, the assessment demonstrates that regional and global multilateral environmental agreements have improved environmental conditions in the pan-European region. It also highlights the complexity of the interlinked environmental, social and economic challenges now confronting decision makers. The launch of the GEOS Assessment for the pan-European region comes at a critical time. The world is on a new course to combat climate change and unleash actions and investment towards a low carbon, resource-efficient, resilient and sustainable future. At the same time, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provides a clear pathway to a world in which everyone can enjoy prosperity within the ecological limits of the planet. Clean air, water, resilient ecosystems and sound management of chemicals and waste are essential for a healthy planet and healthy people. Closing resource-use loops through the promotion of circular economy principles will be a necessary part of the solution, providing much-needed jobs and economic sustainability. The transition towards an inclusive green economy in the pan-European region presents a significant opportunity, which will require the active engagement of a \"coalition of the willing\" at all levels of society. It demands a fundamental redesign of energy, food, mobility and urban systems, as well as a change in lifestyles. Countries in the region have much to contribute to the shaping of a shared vision of the future. I would like to extend my gratitude to the large body of policymakers, leading scientists and representatives from major stakeholder groups and partners who contributed to this comprehensive and illustrative assessment report. I extend an invitation to all countries in the region to engage with this report and use the opportunity provided to transform the vision of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals into a reality for the pan-European region. Achim Steiner United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Director, United Nations Environment Programme Foreword UNECE Executive Secretary T he sixth Global Environment Outlook (GEOS) Assessment for the pan-European region is of great scientific and political importance, as it highlights the state and trends of the environment and enhances the science-policy dialogue underpinning the policy and decision-making processes in the region. In 2011, environment ministers gathered at the Seventh Environment for Europe Ministerial Conference in Astana recognized the many challenges to keeping the pan-European environment under review. Obstacles included the lack of reliable, relevant, easily accessible, comparable and up-to-date data and information, and insufficient cooperation and exchange of information among stakeholders. For this reason environment ministers committed to establishing a regular process of environmental assessment for the entire pan-European region based on a Shared Environmental Information System — an approach to link all existing data and information flows relevant at the country and international levels in support of a regular environmental assessment process. The GEO 6 Assessment for the pan-European region will be launched at the Eighth Environment for Europe (EfE) Ministerial Conference in Batumi, Georgia, in June 2016. It demonstrates the effective follow-up to decisions taken by States participating in the EfE process and supported by the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) secretariats. The ECE Committee on Environmental Policy has decided that in the future the ECE Working Group on Environmental Monitoring and Assessment would serve as the regional environmental information and assessment network of networks, working with the UNEP GEO experts and the European Environment Agency's (EEA) European Environment Information and Observation Network to formulate the regional priorities and scope for the pan-European assessments. The pan-European Shared Environmental Information System is already in place and is starting to organize, regularize and coordinate the regional environmental knowledge base. This process is essential for measuring progress towards the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals. I am pleased we have worked on this assessment in collaboration with UNEP and with the assistance of the EEA — as the three organizations have recently agreed a common approach to support national, regional and global reporting on the state of the environment. We are grateful to all of those involved in this effort to use the data and information available to produce the GEO 6 Assessment for the pan-European region.

Key Findings and Policy Messages Overall picture The GEO -6 Assessment for the pan-European region argues for more urgent action, both through existing policies and the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda), to address the challenges that the region is facing. Regional and global multilateral environmental agreements have improved regional environmental conditions, access to information and public participation. Further improvements are feasible through better implementation and improved access to justice. The region's resource footprint is unsustainable, owing to its overuse of natural resources and its trading patterns with other regions. Ecological, societal and economic resilience will be negatively affected in coming decades by global megatrends that are largely outside the region's direct control and influence. Environmental challenges are now more systemic, multifaceted, complex, uncertain and intertwined with socioeconomic factors. Globally, limits have been crossed for four out of nine planetary boundaries due to human- induced changes: climate change, biosphere integrity, land- system change, and biogeochemical flows (nitrogen and phosphorus). Poor air quality, climate change, unhealthy lifestyles and the disconnection between society and natural environments increasingly affect human health in the region and give rise to new risks. Resilient ecosystems, efficient resource use, clean air, sufficient clean water, sustainable management of chemicals and waste and sustainable cities are essential for a healthy planet and healthy people. However, neither environmental policies alone nor economic and technology-driven efficiency gains will be sufficient to achieve sustainability. More ambition is needed. The 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable 8 Development Goals recognize this reality. Living within planetary boundaries will require fundamental transitions in energy, food, mobility and urban systems and entail profound changes in predominant institutions, practices, technologies, policies and lifestyles. New governance coalitions involving national and subnational levels of government, businesses and citizens are urgently needed. The transition to a truly inclusive green economy must be built on resilient ecosystems, clean production systems, healthy consumption choices, reduced negative distributional effects of environmental policies and improved overall environmental justice for all. Positive long-term outlooks call for an urgent shift from incremental to transformational change in order to: decarbonize energy and transport systems and reduce other harmful emissions; restore ecosystems; decouple resource use, including material footprints, from overall economic performance; \"green\" public and private sector procurement; strengthen environmental responsibility in business; and incentivize lifestyle changes. Key findings Climate change is one of the largest threats to human and ecosystem health and to achieving sustainable development. It is also an accelerator for most other environmental risks. Growing impacts include melting ice, sea level rise, increasing flood and drought frequency, degrading ecosystems, loss of biodiversity, soil function and food productivity, changing disease vectors and exacerbated air pollution impacts on health. Greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union are stable or declining, but in the South Eastern European subregion they are increasing. Largely through efficiency gains, emissions have decreased in the majority of sectors except for transport, refrigeration and air conditioning. Further mitigation actions should be targeted at transport, agriculture, energy and raw materials, as part of the transition to a circular economy. To stay within range of 2°C-i.5°C temperature increases and already foreseen impacts, strengthened government action at the national and subnational levels, as well as multistakeholder coalitions, are needed on mitigation and adaptation, including accounting for emission footprints. Adaptation priorities include: improved water management, notably with regard to coastal floods; growing crops suited for increased temperatures; and building green infrastructure to enhance resilience to extreme weather, particularly in urban areas. Air quality is the largest health risk to the pan-European population, with disproportionate effects on children, the elderly and the poor. Over 500,000 premature deaths in the region were attributable to ambient air quality and 100, 000 to indoor air quality in 2012. More than 95 per cent of the urban population are exposed to pollution above the World Health Organization guidelines. Excessive deposition of nitrogen continues to damage ecosystems. Lifestyles, consumption and transport patterns have the most influence on air quality in the region. Many parts of the region have seen improvements in air quality over recent decades thanks to effective regulations that reduced pollutant emissions. Many of the sectors that impact on air quality also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Particulate matter and ozone are the most important pollutants contributing to adverse outdoor air quality. The bodies under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution and its protocols have been successful in connecting scientific evidence with policy actions. The available evidence supportsfurther policy actions on integrated air quality and climate policies. Policies should also prioritize lifestyle changes and efficiency measures, reductions in emissions at their source and emerging risks, such as ozone and newly identified health effects. Research efforts are required to bridge the considerable knowledge gap on indoor air pollution. Biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation continue apace, despite increased conservation and restoration efforts. The main regional pressures are from increased landuse change, particularly agricultural intensification, urbanization and habitat fragmentation by transport infrastructure. In Western and Central Europe, only 38.4 per cent of the original species abundance remains, while 77 per cent remains in the Russian Federation. Full implementation of the European Union Natura 2000 network, in conjunction with the Emerald Network and the Pan-European Ecological Network, is needed. Together with increased synergies with other existing environmental policy instruments, this would alleviate pressures by providing protection for a broad range of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, habitats, species and landscapes of pan- European importance. Integrating biodiversity and ecosystem considerations into all aspects of spatial planning would further enhance protection efforts, as would new regulations for land and soil protection. Ecosystem-based management approaches offer a cost-effective means to alleviate the multiple pressures on biodiversity, especially from food and forestry production, consumption and tourism. Chemical pollution impacts on human health and ecosystems across the region, with hazardous chemicals of particular concern owing to their toxicity, shortcomings in their management and a lack of transboundary controls. Other priority concerns include endocrine disruptors in consumer products, hazardous substances in electronic and electrical products, environmentally persistent pharmaceuticals and nanomaterials. Mercury pollution in the region is still significant, and new emerging issues such as some toxic chemicals in consumer products pose challenges yet to be tackled. Heavy metals and persistent organic pollutant concentrations in air, sediment and soil have on average been reduced across the region, though hotspots remain. Parts of Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia have legacy stockpiles of obsolete 9 pesticides, as well as a continued reliance on heavy and highly resource-intensive industries and chemical-intensive agriculture. Full and coherent implementation of the three global conventions on chemicals would improve management controls and reduce risks for human health and ecosystems. The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals has not yet been fully implemented. The regulations on products pertaining to chemicals must be improved. More policy attention is needed to early signals from science. Waste volumes continue to grow. Disposal of waste in landfills is the major environmental challenge in several parts of the region, despite progress with recycling in many countries. Handling of waste from electrical and electronic equipment is a growing concern, with control of transboundary movements insufficient under the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal. Reducing food waste in the region is a key challenge. About a third of European farmland is currently used to grow food that is thrown away. Food waste mainly occurs at the distribution and consumption stages in Western and Central Europe, whereas production processes generate most losses in other parts of the region. Plastics waste management is a major challenge given limited recycling options, lack of sustainable substitutes and growing concerns about marine litter. The waste hierarchy is widely accepted as a guiding framework to increase economic value from resource use and to reduce waste. Closing resource-use loops through the promotion of circular economy principles offers further pathways to minimize waste and maximize resource use. Freshwater pollution — mainly from agriculture — to surface waters and groundwaters is the main reason for poor water quality, also affecting coastal areas and regional seas. Between urban and rural communities there are large 10 differences in the levels of access to sanitation and safe drinking water. There are also large differences within the region regarding the collection and treatment of wastewater. Irrigation, over-abstraction and highly polluted return flows threaten groundwater supplies, most notably in Central Asia. The chemical status of water is generally improving in the European Union, but progress is slow for diffuse pollution. Microplastics and emerging contaminants — such as brominated flame retardants, certain veterinary and human pharmaceuticals and anti-fouling biocides — have made their way into all the pan-European seas, via rivers. In several transboundary river basins, water allocation challenges are increasing. The ECE Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes and the European Union Water Framework Directive are the most important instruments, alongside bilateral and multilateral conventions on transboundary river, lake and groundwater basins, such as the Danube. Improved coordination between energy, agriculture, biodiversity and water policies can further improve water quality and quantity, as well as support climate change adaptation objectives and increase ecosystem resilience. Coastal, marine and ocean resources are overexploited for multiple reasons and with wide-ranging impacts. The major threats are urbanization, agriculture, fisheries, transport, industrial development, chemical products and effluents, and energy production. Efforts to reduce pollution loads are overwhelmed by more systemic challenges, such as climate change. Biodiversity loss and habitat degradation of marine ecosystems continues, heightening the risks of the irreversible loss of ecosystems 7 resilience and services. Nutrients loads also remain high. The impacts of new pollutants, including plastic wastes and marine litter, are growing. Climate change impacts are increasing and include acidification, sea level rise and shifting species vectors caused by warming waters. Due to the multitude of socioeconomic-ecological links, threats and negative impacts, there is a need for a more integrativeapproachto national, supranational, interregional and global policy responses and transnational cooperation. Ecosystem-based management approaches offer promising, cost-effective ways to deal with the cumulative negative effects of human activities. Land-use change is leading to the deterioration of the physical and chemical properties of soils, thereby causing water and air pollution. Soils are also under threat from climate change, erosion, contamination, salinization, floods and landslides, which in turn threaten food and nutrition security. Urban sprawl causes the loss of arable land, natural habitats and biodiversity. The loss of green areas in cities has exacerbated climate change effects and caused deterioration in the physical and mental health and cognitive development of children. The externalization of pan-European land demands means that for every hectare of land used in the region, four are used elsewhere to meet the final demand in the region's economies. Legislation in this area is considered inadequate throughout the pan-European region. Sustainable land management policies are needed to deal with multiple threats and impacts. Promoting practices such as organic farming, agroecology and integrated soil fertility management would sustain crop production systems. Restoring green areas and installing green roofs and “living walls\" would mitigate climate change impacts in cities. Governance, knowledge and outlooks The pan-European environmental governance system that has emerged over the past three decades shows important differences between countries, as well as gaps and unexploited opportunities forsynergies between policies and priority areas. Enhanced cooperation is essential to address the multiple systemic, transnational and transboundary problems and the global challenges that are expected to impact the region in coming decades. Further environmental progress can be achieved in the coming years through improved implementation of existing policies. In the longer term, an array of global megatrends coupled with continuing unsustainable systems of production and consumption are expected to exacerbate environmental pressures and impacts. Global megatrends expected to affect the longer-term environmental outlook include: diverging population and migration trends; increasing urbanization; more global competition for resources; an increasingly multipolar world; and climate change. Some of these trends offer opportunities for new innovations; others increase the risks of resource scarcities and conflicts. The pan-European outlooks suggest in particular the need to halve material resource use in Western Europe and to stabilize it elsewhere. Other outlooks for the region point to increasing water stress in Southern Europe and Central Asia, a significant loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services across the region, acute climate change impacts on coastal and agriculture systems and further human health impacts from air pollution and exposure to chemicals. Increasing policy coherence across these thematic areas could improve the longer-term outlook overall. Environmental degradation has also exacerbated social problems and increased social and economic injustices and inequalities. Improvements have been achieved through legal frameworks for public participation in decision-making. These need strengthening urgently, given the rate and scale of current and expected further degradation in coming decades. Successful models of environmental governance should be built upon well-designed policies, their implementation and enforcement, pay close attention to early signals from science and society and ensure adequate oversight capacities and investments in knowledge systems, e.g., data, indicators, policy evaluation and sharing platforms. Greater investments are needed in environmental accounting systems to ensure external costs are addressed, and in foresight processes to identify possible future risks, opportunities and conflicts. Greater application of the \"precautionary principle\" can reduce risks in a world where thresholds and limits are being breached and where endpoints are increasingly uncertain. Achieving progress under greater uncertainty requires coalitions between government institutions, businesses and civil society, to agree on pathways for tackling different societal risks. Vertical coordination between national and local policy levels will be instrumental in accelerating the transition towards sustainable development models in urban areas. The Sustainable Development Goals should be seen as providing a strategic opportunity for environmental policy to contribute to transformative processes as well as a 2 support mechanism for strengthening adaptive capacities and resilience within societies on all levels, instead of a cost factor and constraint on development and competitiveness. Operationalizing the Sustainable Development Goals will require ambitious quantitative targets and indicators so that progress towards sustainability can be tracked properly to ensure convergence on a shared regional vision and ambition within planetary boundaries. There is no doubt that achieving a healthy planet and healthy people requires urgent transformation of the current systems of production and consumption that most contribute to environmental degradation and inequalities in human health and well-being. Introduction Through this assessment, the authors and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) secretariat are providing an objective evaluation and analysis of the pan- European environment designed to support environmental decision-making at multiple scales. In this assessment, the judgement of experts is applied to existing knowledge to provide scientifically credible answers to policy-relevant questions (UNEP 2015a). These questions include, but are not limited to the following: • What is happening to the environment in the pan- European region and why? • What are the consequences for the environment and the human population in the pan-European region? • What is being done and how effective is it? • What are the prospects for the environment in the future? • Whatactionscould betakentoachievea moresustainable future? The decision to undertake regional assessments was taken at the Global Intergovernmental and Multi-stakeholder Consultation (IGMS) in Berlin, 21-23 October 2014, where participants of the IGMS expressed the desire that the sixth edition of the Global Environment Outlook (GEO-6) assessment should \"build on regional assessments\" that would be conducted in similar fashion to the global GEO process (UNEP 2014a). The mandate for the IGMS meeting was provided by Member States attending the first session of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA 1) held in June 2014. In their statement Member States requested: \"the Executive Director, within the programme of work and budget, to undertake the preparation of the sixth Global Environment Outlook (GEO-6), supported by UNEP Live, with the scope, objectives and procedures of GEO-6 to be defined by a transparent global intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder consultation informed by document UNE P/EA . 1/INF/14, resulting in a scientifically credible, peer- reviewed GEO-6 and its accompanying summary for policy makers, to be endorsed by the United Nations Environment Assembly no later than 2018;\" In addition, Member States also requested: \"the Executive Director to consult with all United Nations Environment Programme regions regarding their priorities to be taken up in the global assessment;\" { UNEP 2014b) Environment for Europe The ministers of the environment from the pan-European region at the Seventh \"Environment for Europe\" (EfE) Ministerial Conference, held in Astana (Kazakhstan) on 21-23 September 2011, committed to establish a regular process of environmental assessment for the pan-European region based on a Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS). The regional knowledge base created through SEIS uses platforms such as UNEP Live, which links with other global, sub-regional and national platforms to provide access to environmental data and information that are regularly published by countries. This regional assessment is based on established political and institutional processes and mechanisms that exist in the region. As such, and following a decision by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Committee on Environmental Policy (CEP), the GEO-6 Assessment for the pan-European region is being launched at the Eighth Environment for Europe (EfE) Ministerial Conference in Batumi (Georgia) in June 2016. The two main themes for the EfE Ministerial Conference are: greening the economy in the pan-European region; and improving air quality for a better environment and human health. The international policy agenda after Rio+20 At the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), world leaders approved The Future We Want , the Conference's outcome document, which recognized that the green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication is one of the important tools available for achieving sustainable development. The implementation of green economy policies should contribute to eradicating poverty, as well as to sustained economic growth, enhanced social inclusion, improved human welfare and creating opportunities for employment and decent work for all, while maintaining the healthy functioning ofthe Earth's ecosystems. The Future We Want also called for a wide range of measures including the launching of a process to provide actionable goals, targets and indicators for Sustainable Development, to be implemented by 2030. The resulting 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development - Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development - with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets - was the outcome of the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit held in New York (USA) on 25-27 September 2015. The United Nations General Assembly subsequently adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at its 70th session. The SDGs are universal and apply to all countries, and thus to every nation in the pan-European region. They are an integrated international policy agenda for the coming years addressing linked environmental, social and economic challenges that humanity is facing. A parallel and closely related process is the international effort undertaken through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which, following the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP-21) in December 2015, culminated in the Paris Agreement in which Parties agreed the urgent need to address the significant gap between the aggregate effect of Parties' mitigation pledges in terms of global annual emissions of greenhouse gases by 2020, and aggregate emission pathways consistent with holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing 14 efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C. The results of this Conference will affect many dimensions of environmental change in the decades ahead, and thus on the global environmental outlook at multiple levels, from planetary to regional and local. In addition, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 was adopted at the Third United Nations World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction held in Sendai (Japan) in March 2015. The expected goal and outcome by 2030 is: \"The substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods and health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets of persons, businesses, communities and countries.\" The pan-European region is exposed to disasters including flooding and droughts exacerbated by climate change and also geophysical hazards, and thus countries in the region will need to align themselves to support the delivery of the goals and targets within the framework. Regional priorities The regional priorities for the pan-European region were identified and agreed through the Regional Environmental Information Network (REIN) Conference of 13-17 April 2015 in Istanbul (Turkey). Five regional priorities were agreed: climate change, air quality, biodiversity, chemicals and waste, and freshwater. For the regional assessment to support the scope of the forthcoming global GEO-6 assessment, two additional thematic areas were considered: 'coastal, marine and oceans' and 'land'. In addition, the relationship between the environment and human health and well-being 1 , and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, were recognized as two important overarching themes forthe region. 1 Health will be understood in its holistic meaning, as defined by the World Health Organization: \"health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\" (WHO 1948]. Despite coming to age, the definition holds a modern view on health, promoting new notions such as subjective well-being and happiness, supporting alternative options for measuring health (UNDP 2015]. The UNEP pan-European region (*] EU-28 Member States [ A ] Candidate countries to the European Union The above regional priorities and themes have been used to guide this analysis, which also took into account the two main themes for the EfE Ministerial Conference: greening the economy in the pan-European region and improving air quality for a better environment and human health. Regional diversity The UNEP pan-European region extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arctic Ocean, and comprises 54 countries. The region is diverse in terms of cultural, social, economic, environmental and political attributes. While the pan-European region is home to some of the wealthiest nations of the world and innovative environmental policy initiatives (see Chapter 2), some countries in the region continue to experience poverty and environmental degradation (UNDP 2015). In reality, resource consumption, environmental impacts of economic activity and the policies set in place to address them vary greatly among sub-regions. The GEO-6 Assessment for the pan-European region The GEO-6 Assessment for the pan-European region is built on existing national, sub-regional and thematic assessments, including The European environment - state and outlook 2015 report (EEA 2015a) produced by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in 2015. The indicator and analysis framework used in the GEO and EEA assessments is the DPSIR model. This is made up of five categories of interaction: (D) changes that exert pressure (P) on the environment, which as a consequence cause changes in the state (S) of the environment, leading to impacts (I) on society and the planet, and societal and political responses (R) (Stanners et al. 2007). Further information regarding the analytical framework and the approach to the assessment is provided at the beginning of Chapter 2. The regional assessment is structured in four main chapters: Chapter 1 provides the regional context and priorities, and analyses the two over-arching themes in the context of the pan-European region. 15 Chapter 2 establishes the state of the environment in the region following the five regional priorities and, in addition, the two thematic areas of coastal, marine and oceans, and of land. This chapter also analyses the key trends for each environmental theme and assesses policy responses in the region. Chapter 3 presents opportunities and options to strengthen environmental governance in the pan- European region, taking into account its potential role as an enabler to support the transition towards an inclusive green economy. • Chapter 4 reviews the main trends that will affect the region's environment in the future and suggests outlooks for the region to achieve a more sustainable future. The data underpinning the assessment can be found in UNEP Live {uneplive.unep.org). The full assessment is also available through UNEP Live as a PDF and as an eBook.

Likewise, specific targets under the SDGs also cover the two additional themes: coastal, marine and oceans, and land. • The SDGs place the environmental priorities of the pan-European region in an integrated global framework for sustainable development that facilitates coherent policy formulation. The SDG targets and their indicators provide tools to measure progress in achieving the goals, and to support the follow-up and review process for the commitments made. • Each country in the pan-European region will need to determine its own path to the SDGs, converging from different starting points. • The pan-European region is a leader in mechanisms for follow-up and review that will become increasingly important with the SDGs and their indicators: peer review such as Environmental Performance Reviews conducted by OECD and UNECE; reports to multilateral environmental agreements; the balance of legislation, executive action, enforcement and judicial review; the independent role of civil society organizations; and the role of the media and public opinion. The pan-European region can continue to be a pioneer in institutional innovation, balancing supra-national coordination and subsidiarity as appropriate, while building regional solidarity and cohesion in implementing the SDGs. The pan-European region and the international policy agenda In 2014, the United Nations Secretary-General stated, \" sustainable development must be an integrated agenda for economic , environmental , and social solutions. Its strength lies in the interweaving of its dimensions. This integration provides the basis for economic models that benefit people and the environment; for environmental solutions that contribute to progress; for social approaches that add to economic dynamism and allow for the preservation and sustainable use of the environmental common; and for reinforcing human rights , equality, and sustainability. Responding to all goals as a cohesive and integrated whole will be critical to ensuring the transformations needed at scale.\" { UN 2014) To this end, pan-European environmental policy is evolving to reflect and incorporate the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development within its regional context. In planning a transition to an inclusive green and circular economy, a broad set of policy interventions aims at expanding the safe operating space for socio-economic development in the region, while respecting planetary boundaries. Policies such as the European Union's (EU) Europe 2020 strategy, which includes a lead initiative for a resource-efficient Europe (EC 2010) are designed to enable the flow of public and private investment in sectors of the economy that are low carbon and resource efficient, and that create green and decent jobs. One of the region's international responsibilities is to calculate its share of global consumption and use of resources, including those originating from beyond the pan- European region, in relation to planetary boundaries (Steffen et al. 2015 ; Rockstrom et al. 2009) and the sustainability of human society (Hoekstra and Wiedmann 2014). This means defining the region's global footprint (Tukker et al. 2015, UNEP 2015b; UNEP 2015c; Wiedmann et al. 2015; Tukker et al. 2014; UNEP 2013). Work has already begun on enabling ◄ Credit: Shutterstock/RudmerZwerver 19 Chapter 1: Regional Context and Priorities GEO-6 Assessment for the pan-European Region the region to debate the criteria for establishing its equitable share of the global effort to meet the SDGs by 2030. These will need to take account of differentiated responsibilities between sub-regions and between countries within the pan- European region, as described in the SOER 2015 report (EEA 2015a). To achieve environmental sustainability, the sum total of all these shares for all regions should remain within planetary boundaries. (More. .) 1.1.2 The challenge of the Sustainable Development Goals The SDGs are accepted by all countries and are applicable to all, developed and developing, wealthy and poor. Different national realities will require different responses to achieve the global goals. Each goal reflects one dimension of the human planetary system evolving in space and over time, aiming together for that dynamic balance that is the sustainability of the whole system. These are universal goals and targets which involve the entire world. They are integrated and indivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development. One goal should not be achieved atthe expense of another goal, making an integrated approach vital. The universality of the SDGs is their strength. They capture issues common to all countries, and emphasize their interdependencies. In a globalized world, the actions of one country affect another, be it through overconsumption, corruption, emissions causing climate change, mismanagement or illegal trade. The SDGs also call for the respect of global standards in the fields of human rights, labour and the environment. In the SDGs, all countries in the pan-European region have directly committed to an integrated set of globally determined, measurable goals and targets. On 11 March 2016, the United Nations Statistical Commission (UNSC) agreed the proposed global indicator framework for the goals and targets as a practical starting point. It recognized thatthe development of a robust and high quality framework is a technical process that will need to continue over time, and also emphasized that the global indicators proposed are for global follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda for 20 Sustainable Development and are not necessarily applicable to all national contexts. Indicators for regional, national and sub-national levels will be developed at the regional and national levels. The SDGs go far beyond the traditional silos in which issues are placed and actions taken. All the SDGs have an environmental dimension to some of their targets, and half of the targets are relevant to the environment. While some SDGs address problems that are more acute in other regions, they all have relevance to parts of the region and to subsets of its population. They therefore provide a useful and policy- relevant framework for an environmental outlook. From the perspective of the GEO reporting process, the integration of environmental aspects into the SDGs covers three key complementary areas (EEA 2015a): • those SDGs on climate, water, oceans and ecosystems, biodiversity and land that focus on the environmental resources, processes and boundaries that define the planetary health on which human well-being and development depend, and that reflect Europe's natural capital and environmental priorities; • those on poverty and health that place people at the centre, where environmental challenges represent threats to human health and well-being, and where environmental solutions can reinforce human progress; and • those on sustainable energy and sustainable consumption and production, which address the transition to an inclusive green economy with resource-efficient, low- carbon development that builds rather than undermines pan-European and global sustainability. The final two goals concern institutional and governance issues and the means of implementation.

The environment features in the goals and targets, and the pan-European environmental priorities and themes considered for this assessment are clearly reflected across the integrated set of SDGs (Table 1.1.1). The SDG framework highlights the cross-linkages between issues and the co-benefits that can come from an integrated approach. Climate change action is both an SDG and the subject of the Paris Agreement under the UNFCCC. Meeting the pan- European share of this goal will require ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets such as those already set by the EU (EU 2015); accelerating the transition to renewable energies; and technology innovation and planning for adaptation. Western Europe should acknowledge that those of its livestock and agricultural systems that are oriented to intensive production are in conflict with the need for greenhouse gas reductions. As a classic cross-cutting issue, climate change will require a policy shift to food security, local production and agricultural diversity ratherthan just food quantity, and waste reduction. Storm surge barrier Oosterscheldekering, the Netherlands Credit: Shutterstock/Aerovista Luchtfotografie 21 GEO-6 Assessment for the pan-European Region Regional policies should also recognize the importance of ecosystem health and biodiversity for resilience in the face of climate change. Since climate change and sea-level rise are expected to displace large numbers of people, Western Europe should learn from the challenges it is currently facing with migration and prepare for a larger-scale response in implementing responsible migration. On air quality, Western Europe has already made substantial progress in controlling some forms of transboundary air pollution, including through a regional convention (the UNECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution), but urban air quality is still a major problem with significant health impacts, and a high priority for the pan- European region. European biodiversity continues to degrade despite major efforts to protect it. The pan-European region has challenges in land use, fragmentation of natural areas and freshwater biodiversity in its rivers. To meet the goals and targets established under the SDGs' process, it will be necessary to integrate biodiversity considerations into all aspects of planning at regional, national and local levels, and to incorporate the economic benefits of ecosystem services. Chemicals and wastes are an important issue in the pan- European region, and these are addressed in several targets Plastic bottles and containers prepared for recycling.

Since trade in chemicals is global, and chemical pollution and wastes transcend regional boundaries, the pan-European region should support global approaches, including research on new and emerging chemical risks to human health and the environment, finding alternatives to problematic chemicals and industrial processes, facing up to the challenge of nuclear wastes and Video: UNEP Global Partnership on Marine Litter 2015 - \"Preventing our Oceans from becoming Dumps\" “PREVENTING OUR OCEANS FROM BECOMING DUMPS” This video was developed by the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-Based Activities (GPA) as the Secretariat for the Global Partnership on Marine Utter (GPML) ► ►! « 0.06 / 5:57 H <S\" a \" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCXEHrmEYpM&list =PLZ4sOGXTWw8Gpj8uvJQv53FXiHsCbSoWM addressing the growing problem of plastic pollution (Ellen MacArthur Foundation 2015). Plastic pollution can only be addressed through sustainable design, improved resource efficiency, substitution with less persistent materials and transitioning to a circular economy with better collection and separation and recycling of plastic waste, alongside product life extension through reuse, refurbishment and remanufacturing. The pan-European region's challenges for freshwater include reducing pollution from hazardous substances and improving treatment; addressing the poor chemical status of groundwater due to agriculture; increasing water use efficiency and sustainability with integrated water resources and watershed management; anticipating the risk under climate change of water shortages in southern Europe and Central Asia and flooding everywhere in Europe; addressing the links between poverty and access to safe drinking water and modern sanitation for the marginalized parts of the population; transboundary water cooperation 2 ; and acknowledging the importance of natural ecosystems for water management. For coastal, oceans and marine issues, some of the critical issues for Western Europe include improving coastal zone management and climate change adaptation in the face of rapid sea-level rise; contributing to environmental impact assessment and sustainable regulation of offshore and deep- sea mineral extraction; and addressing plastic pollution and other sources of marine litter (GESAMP 2015). One specific challenge is ocean fishing by pan-European fleets. For the region to contribute to responsible fisheries at the global level, it will be necessary to reduce pan-European fishing globally to sustainable levels, remove subsidies that lead to excess fishing capacity, address inequalities between small- and large-scale fisheries, and support the scientific management of global fisheries in which pan-European boats are present. For pan-European land, many parts of which are densely populated, there are conflicts between agriculture, settlement patterns, infrastructure development and other land uses under current policies, with a continuing and unsustainable conversion of productive land to other uses. The pan-European region faces issues of food security, the present encouragement of large-scale intensive agricultural production at the expense of more sustainable farming practices, and the best uses for agricultural land in the region. The challenge is to increase the environmental carrying capacity of the available land and to manage land use coherently, with eco-regional planning and biodiversity conservation. Since farmland is being abandoned and villages are shrinking in many rural areas, an effort is needed to provide rural populations with such sustainable activities as environmental stewardship and landscape management, 2 including through the 1992 UNECE Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes, the 1997 UN Convention on the Law of Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses, and regional river basin conventions. and to ensure that indigenous populations have secure ownership and access to land and natural resources. 1.1.4 The Sustainable Development Goals with people at the centre The following SDGs, addressing human health and welfare, also have substantial environmental dimensions. Goal 1 addresses poverty and the pan-European region does have its poor, even if in some cases the poverty is only relative. Indeed, there has been a recent significant increase in poverty linked to economic crises and austerity programmes. As the poor may contribute to, and are often victims of, environmental degradation and biodiversity loss, the elimination of poverty frequently supports environmental goals. While poverty is still a challenge in the region, it also has a significant role in addressing poverty elsewhere, and should contribute its fair share to the global fight against poverty. Western Europe in particular needs to recognize its unintended effects on poverty in other countries, through consumption patterns that result in a demand for resources from outside of the region and influence prices and investment, effectively depriving less advantaged populations in resource-rich developing countries of land and resources. Similarly, Goal 2 on hunger, food security, nutrition and sustainable agriculture is important for regional and planetary environments. Pan-European agriculture has both sustainable and unsustainable dimensions. Western Europe is increasingly dependent on food imports to meet its needs, and exports to support its economy, increasing its vulnerability to a global food crisis. There are challenges to maintaining its relatively high-cost productive agricultural base in a global market. Consideration also has to be given to the impact of European environmental and food standards on agriculture in other regions. From a nutritional perspective, Western Europe is home to leading multi-national agribusinesses, and has a food 23 Chapter 1: Regional Context and Priorities GEO-6 Assessment for the pan-European Region industry that has consolidated agriculture and retail food systems at the expense of national food security. One result is a loss of dietary diversity and a reduction in staple diet constituents with a consequent decline in food grain and livestock diversity. Processed food products have health impacts, with some dietary-related conditions such as obesity becoming increasingly common in the pan-European region, generating health costs that seriously impact economies. Some parts of the region need to encourage healthier diets and eating less, while for others hunger is still a priority. These problems illustrate how policies designed to address a limited set of goals or only one dimension of sustainable development can impede progress on other goals and have overall negative impacts on human well-being (UNEP 2oi5d). Human health and the environment are intimately related. To respond to Goal 3 on healthy lives and well-being, the pan-European region faces a set of environmental health challenges discussed in Section 1.2 and addressed in the European Environment & Health process. A new planetary boundary has been identified for the release of novel substances including chemicals, nanoparticles, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and other industrial products for which the risks have not been adequately researched (Steffen et al. 2015). European research and regulation, incorporating the precautionary principle, will be important in addressing these. Goal 4 on education is relevant to developing solutions to environmental challenges in the region. Encouraging environmental health, sustainable consumption and responsible lifestyles requires the integration of these aspects into educational programmes. Education is needed to encourage citizens to understand how their own interests and welfare depend on the integrated set of SDGs. This is highlighted in Target 4.7 on education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles. To make the transition to an inclusive green (and circular) economy, the region will need to provide education and training for green jobs, mainstream green skills into all qualifications and retrain workers from activities in decline. 24 The final social goal, Goal 5 on gender equality, captures the important role of women in environmental decision-making, whether as consumers, farmers and workers or researchers and policy-makers. Mothers are normally the first educators of children and, along with fathers, are transmitters of societal values, so their early role in environmental education is crucial in building a more sustainable future. There are also parts of the pan-European region still concerned by equal rights for women to economic resources, natural resources and land ownership. Without such access, women cannot exercise their environmental responsibilities effectively. 1.1.5 Sustainable Development Goals for the transition to an inclusive green and circular economy The present economy is a major driver of pan-European and global unsustainability, with excessive resource consumption and growing economic inequality. A number of SDGs covering energy, economic growth, employment, industry, inequality, human settlements and sustainable consumption and production could form the basis of a new dialogue on an environmentally responsible transition to an inclusive green and circular economy. Goal 8 is the main economic goal concerned with economic growth and employment. As a world economic leader, Western Europe could become a model in the redesign of the world economy, aiming for an economic system that maximizes human well-being rather than growth as such, combined with implementingTarget 17.19 on measurements of progress in sustainable development beyond gross domestic product (GDP). This means transitioning the pan-European region to an inclusive green economy (UNEP 20150) that incorporates energy and natural resource efficiency, and context- driven effectiveness, to provide both resource security and equitable access, such as in a circular economy (Figure 1.1.1). A circular economy would include absolute decoupling of economic growth from resource use (UNEP 2015c), including through sustainable consumption and production, conserving Figure 1.1.1: The Circular Economy Source: Acceleratio n.d. critical raw materials with a sophisticated metallurgical infrastructure (UNEP 2013), promoting recycling (as well as product reuse, refurbishment and remanufacturing), and the conversion of food, hazardous, electronic (UNEP 2oi5g), plastic and other wastes into resources, as well as the minimization of residual wastes such as marine litter. This would be supported by actions under the Pan- European Strategic Framework for Greening the Economy, developed with support from the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) secretariat and the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP). The framework describes opportunities and challenges for greening the economy in the pan-European region, as well as possible paths to sustainability and steps to promote cooperation among countries in the region to support the transition to a green economy. This transition should also include green and decent jobs for everyone, especially youth, with more flexible careers; and green investment, with the removal of harmful subsidies and better debt management. An immediate challenge is to manage the transition of human and material resources from unsustainable economic activities and those that do not contribute to human well-being to those that do. The impact of the region's economy on the rest of the world through resource extraction, imports and climate change needs to be included. Western Europe will also have to adapt its economic thinking to its demographic profile as an aging community. This concept is further elaborated in Goal 12 on sustainable consumption and production which is particularly relevant to Western Europe, and which will require fundamental transitions in the systems of production and consumption (EEA 2015a). As an over-consuming region relative to planetary carrying capacity, Western Europe will need to redefine the ways in which it creates economic value so that it increases the well-being of its citizens within an appropriate per-person share of global consumption (UNEP 20150. This needs to be supported by education for responsible lifestyles as called for in the UNECE Strategy for Education for Sustainable Development, so that its citizens Young woman shopping selectively in a supermarket Credit: Shutterstock/Robert Kneschke come to see the advantages of meeting their needs without excess. Some of the characteristics of this new system will be the absolute decoupling of productivity from energy and Chapter 1: Regional Context and Priorities GEO-6 Assessment for the pan-European Region material flows, achieving optimal sizes for communities, companies and economies rather than endless growth, closed cycles of critical raw materials, and decentralization and subsidiarity. Energy is fundamental to development, but the present material civilization has been built on unsustainable energy subsidies for fossil fuels. Goal 7 on energy balances the need for access to energy for development of the poorer parts of the planet with the urgent need to decarbonize society to protect the world from the effects of climate change. Renewable energy in the pan-European region Credit: Shutterstock/msgrafixx For the pan-European region, the challenge is to be a leader of the energy transition. Progress has already been made in some countries in developing renewable energy and phasing out fossil fuels, but more is needed to increase energy efficiency, reduce consumption, phase out environmentally harmful subsidies and ensure energy security. There are already 1.2 mil lion jobs in renewable energy in the EU (IRENA 2015) (More. ..2). A key of the economy is Goal 9 on inclusive and sustainable industrialization and supporting infrastructure. In the pan- European region, this will include encouraging sustainable forms of transport, industrial ecology as a contribution to a circular economy and greaterenvironmental responsibility in 26 business. Since much industrial activity has been delocalized to other regions, a true picture of Western Europe's environmental impact should include the environmental footprint of imported products. A specific challenge for infrastructure is the need to adapt ports and coastal areas to sea-level rise. Rising costs resulting from the consequences of climate change are unavoidable, but anticipation and adaptation will be much cheaper than disaster relief and reconstruction. More fundamentally, many environmental costs are externalized or ignored in the present system, and need to be internalized to integrate them into decision-making processes Present economies, whether market-based or centrally planned, use natural resources unsustainably, producing an inconsistency between the SDGs for growth and for biocapacity renewal, whether for agriculture or Green buildings, Warsaw library Credit: Shutterstock/ ID: katatonia82;RossHelen natural resource sustainability. The international legal and regulatory framework for industry should combine wealth creation with social and environmental responsibility to make these compatible. Much economic activity is concentrated in cities, and the pan-European region today is largely an urban society. The resulting sustainability challenges are addressed in Goal 11 to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Meeting this goal will involve green urbanization producing smart, efficient, low-carbon cities and towns, with urban communities at optimal scales. The immediate pan-European challenge is the transitioning of existing cities, with new sustainable construction, the retro- fitting of old buildings and the transformation of food, land use, energy and transportation systems. Environmental improvements should include creating green corridors and belts for urban biodiversity, and integrating cities into the wider ecological landscape, including encouraging urban agriculture. The region also needs to develop new economic activities for rural areas and villages, while networking communities with transport and communications to ensure their integration in the larger social fabric. A culture of consumption Credit: Shutterstock/ Dmitrijs Dmitrijevs One ambitious objective is Goal 10 to reduce inequality within and among countries. The growing crisis of economic inequality in many pan-European countries is driving overconsumption and social dysfunction, and creating significant barriers to confronting climate change and promoting environmental sustainability. This goal will help to address the inequitable sharing of limited environmental resources. There are applications for this goal at many levels: reducing inequality between the pan-European region and other regions, between countries within the region, within countries, and between rural and urban communities. 1.1.6 Sustainable Development Goals for institutions, governance and means of implementation The final two goals are about means as much as ends. Goal 16 on peaceful and inclusive societies, justice and accountable institutions at all levels covers a number of environmental priorities. To achieve this, the pan-European region will have to address the underlying environmental drivers of tension, which can include access to water and other resources including energy, and environmentally-driven migration. The goal calls for strengthening environmental governance and eliminating corruption, which often undermines environmental management. To meet the last goal, Goal 17 on means of implementation and partnership, the pan-European region will need to build an SDG monitoring and assessment network, modeled on a Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS) for the region, and identify data gaps and harmonization challenges. It should pioneer innovative technologies to simplify and standardize data collection, assessment and monitoring. It is well placed to support other regions to meet the SDGs, and to build global data collection, monitoring and review frameworks. 1.1.7 Institutional and social organization and innovation The countries of the pan-European region are diverse in their stages of development, economies, cultures and value systems, resource endowments and governance institutions, and reflect a similar diversity atthe world level. Their pathways to sound environmental management and sustainability will inevitably be different, even as they converge on the same goals. Yet their proximity also means that they have many 27 Chapter 1: Regional Context and Priorities GEO-6 Assessment for the pan-European Region things in common, including environmental resources and impacts, trade and population movements. All this will require innovation in multi-level environmental governance, whether it be for shared river basins, energy markets, sustainable consumption and production, pools of capital and labour, transport and communications, ecosystem services and migratory species, or research and knowledge management. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (UN 2015) calls for assessments of progress on the SDGs at the national, regional and global levels. Each nation will need to internalize the SDGs to determine their aspirations and their share of the global ambition, and decide on their own targets and indicators within the global framework. The pan-European region as a whole will also need to decide on the appropriate scales and mechanisms for regular regional assessments. Western Europe is one of the leading sub-regions of the world in its capacity to implement the SDGs. It has a range of institutional mechanisms and multilateral agreements, and decades of experience with environmental policy instruments, as well as a strong scientific and data collection capacity and experience in using indicators. This experience in using indicators is 28 continuously improving across the region and its sub-regions through the UNECE Working Group on Environmental Monitoring and Assessment (WGEMA) and Joint Task Force on Environmental Indicators (JTFEI) processes in support of SEIS. The pan-European region is also a leader in mechanisms for follow-upand reviewthatwill become increasingly important with the SDGs and their indicators: peer review such as Environmental Performance Reviews conducted by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and UNECE; reports to multilateral environmental agreements; the balance of legislation, executive action, enforcement and judicial review; the independent role of civil society organizations; and the role of the media and public opinion. The SDGs could provide a new vision and narrative around which tostrengthen unity acrossthe region. The pan-European region can continue to be a pioneer in institutional innovation, balancing supra-national coordination and subsidiarity as appropriate, while building regional solidarity and cohesion in implementing the SDGs. i.2 Healthy Planet, Healthy People • Addressing the interlinkages between environmental sustainability and human health and well-being, and building resilient ecosystems will be essential to meeting the SDGs that place people and well-being at their centre. • Many of the gains in human development over the last century have been made at the cost of ecosystems, both within and outside the region, and the later effects of this now cause ill-health. The effects of climate change, air and water pollution, chemical exposure, biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation all contribute to the environmental burden of disease. • Outdoor air pollution remains a major problem, especially in cities of the region. The prevalence of mental and non- communicable diseases (NCDs) is also significant, and the region is the most affected globally. Even though the causality of NCDs is complex, prevention can often be achieved by providing healthy environments and promoting healthy lifestyles, with decreased exposure to harmful agents. • There is a need to detoxify, decarbonize and decouple resource use from economic performance, and support lifestyle changes in order to build ecosystem resilience and deliver an integrated, inter-sectoral and inter-generational approach to improve human well-being and environmental sustainability. • The harmful environmentally-related impacts on human health could be reduced by integrated, multi-stakeholder public health actions; implementing ecosystem-based solutions; preventing exposure to harmful agents; increasing exposure to healthy green urban environments; encouraging healthy lifestyles; and using strategic environmental assessment and other impact assessment tools to assess relevant policies, plans, programmes and projects. 1.2.1 Environmental sustainability and human health and well-being Addressing the interlinkages between human health and well-being 3 and healthy ecosystems 4 will be essential to meet the SDGs. All five of the pan-European regional priorities - climate change, biodiversity, air quality, freshwater and chemicals and wastes - influence human 3 Health will be understood in its holistic meaning, as defined by the World Health Organization: \" health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\" (WHO 1948]. Despite coming to age, the definition holds a modern view on health, promoting new notions such as subjective well-being and happiness, supporting alternative options for measuring health (UNDP 2015]. 4 The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA 2005a] defines an ecosystem as: \"dynamic complex of plant, animal, and microorganism communities and the non- living environment, interacting as afunctional unit. Humans are an integral part of ecosystems\". Within this context an ecosystem is considered healthy \"if it is stable and sustainable — that is, if it is active and maintains its organization and autonomy over time and is resilient to stress\" (Costanza 1992]. health and well-being and by preserving, improving or restoring environmental quality, multiple benefits and policy goals can be achieved. i.2.2 A changing disease scenario in a changing environment Human health depends on healthy environments A healthy environment underpins human health and well- being ( lore. ..3). This relationship is a complex web of interactions; the understanding and recognition of these interactions should be further enhanced at the national and pan-European scale to achieve a healthier society for all (Figure 1.2.1) (More. ). Over the last century, improved hygiene and considerable medical progress have substantially reduced morbidity 29 Chapter 1: Regional Context and Priorities GEO-6 Assessment for the pan-European Region Figure 1.2.1: Overview and examples of interlinkages between the environment and human health I Areas of natural beauty Source: ECEHHn.d. 30 and mortality from infectious diseases. However, these interventions can, due to over- or misuse, become unbalanced and the direction reversed, resulting in, for example, multi-resistant pathogens and auto-immune diseases. Anti-microbial resistance is a natural phenomenon, but the occurrence increases with inappropriate use of anti- microbial drugs; for example, in animal husbandry and by poor infection prevention and over-prescription, as well as waste from the pharmaceutical industry. The consequences are detrimental, as without efficient treatment options, common infections can become lethal and the success of organ transplantation, cancer chemotherapy and major surgery are compromised. Coordinated policies and regulations are required across the region, such as investing more in health promotion and disease prevention and including the avoidance of the overuse of antibiotics, rather than interventional health care. Such coordinated actions should include an environmental perspective, both in terms of preventing hazards and by creating healthy living environments for all. The rise of life-style related and NCDs, including mental disorders, putsfurtherstresson health systemsand economic, social and natural resources (Horton 2013) ( lor ). Four out of five Europeans die from NCDs and the region is, so far, the most affected globally (WHO 2015a). Many of these deaths could be avoided by integrated, multi-stakeholder public health actions, preventing exposure to harmful agents and promoting healthy environments and lifestyles (WHO 2015a; Hanson et al. 2011). This was acknowledged by health ministers participating at the European Environment and Health Process, and included in the Parma Declaration (WHO 2010a) and in Health 2020 (WHO 2015a). Greater efforts are needed to reduce the high burden of environmentally-related disease and to address the unequal distribution between countries, as well asthe disproportionate effects on poor and vulnerable groups. New approaches, such as One Health 5 , may be useful for encompassing the interdependencies between hum"
