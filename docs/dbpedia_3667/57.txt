17/10/2014 - Igor Cobileanski’s feature debut is only the second Moldovan candidate in the history of the awards

Igor Cobileanski’s first feature, The Unsaved , has been selected to represent Moldova at next year’s Oscars. It is only the second Moldovan candidate in the history of the Academy Awards: last year, the country was represented by its first Oscar contender ever, All God’s Children, by Romanian director Adrian Popovici.

Produced by Saga Film and written by Corneliu Porumboiu and Cobileanski, The Unsaved tells the story of 19-year-old Viorel (Igor Babiac), who lives with his mother in a remote Moldovan town and earns a little cash through illegal activities with his friend Goose (Sergiu Voloc). Viorel will soon realise that he wants more from life.

The Unsaved had its international premiere in the East of the West competition of last year’s Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. It was released in Romania in September 2013 and, although very well received by critics, was seen by only 1,748 cinemagoers.

On 24 February 2014, the day when Cobileanski turned 40, the Gopo nominations were announced: The Unsaved was the most nominated film and had the opportunity to win in 13 categories. The movie lost out to other titles in most of them, especially to Călin Peter Netzer’s Child’s Pose , nevertheless winning for Best First Feature and Best Cinematography (Oleg Mutu).

In June, The Unsaved was one of the 22 features and short films competing in the Romanian Days sidebar of the Transilvania International Film Festival.

The Moldovan production is now one of the 83 foreign films submitted for the next edition of the Oscars. The nominations will be announced on 15 January, with the ceremony scheduled for 22 February.
