Swimmer Torri Huske claimed gold in women’s 100-meter butterfly, and Caleb Dressler, Jack Alexy, Hunter Armstrong and Chris Guiliano took gold in the men’s 4x100-meter freestyle relay.\n\nHost country France won eight medals today, bringing its total to 16: five gold, eight silver and three bronze.\n\nJapan, with a total of 12 medals overall, had the most gold medals at the end of Day 3 with six, in addition to its two silver and four bronze.\n\nU.S. gymnast Nedoroscik says dismount was ‘best moment of my life’\n\nStephen Nedoroscik had plenty of time to watch his teammates before he took to the pommel horse as the U.S. men’s team tried to win its first Olympic medal in 16 years.\n\nNedoroscik said that his teammates paved the way and that “going up to pommel horse, last guy up in the whole competition, I had a good feeling that our team was in a great spot.”\n\n“I just knew I had to go up there and do my job,” Nedoroscik said in an interview after he and his team won bronze.\n\nThere was a moment in his routine when he became worried, he said, watching the routine back in the studio.\n\n“I was like, ‘Let’s just get it done; let’s go for it,’” Nedoroscik recalled. “Right here, I was like, ‘If I put this dismount up, Team USA gets a medal!’”\n\nHe said landing the dismount was “the best moment of my life.”\n\nHow Flavor Flav became official ‘hype man’ for the U.S. women’s water polo team\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nThe American rapper Flavor Flav became the most prominent U.S. women’s water polo team supporter by signing a five-year sponsorship deal as the official hype man for the team.\n\nA look at how it happened.\n\nWomen's rugby up next: Team USA vs. New Zealand\n\nThe U.S. women's rugby team is headed to the semifinals tomorrow after it defeated Great Britain in the quarterfinals today.\n\nThe team faces off against New Zealand at 9:30 a.m. ET to see who will make it to the finals.\n\nThe U.S. is searching for its first Olympic medal in women’s rugby after it fell short in Rio and Tokyo.\n\nThe winner of tomorrow's game will go on to the gold medal match and the loser to the bronze medal match. Either way, both teams look poised to claim spots on the podium.\n\n‘I had no doubt in this team,’ Richard says after USA gymnastics bronze\n\nThe U.S. men's gymnastics team set out to win a medal at the Paris Games, and its third-place finish did the job.\n\n“It feels amazing,” said Fred Richard, who predicted the team would come home with hardware.\n\n“Because, I mean, we had some highs and lows. You know, qualification wasn’t perfect. But I had no doubt in this team — and it showed today,” he said.\n\nThe bronze is the first medal won by the U.S. men's gymnastic team in 16 years. The last medal, also a bronze, came at the 2008 Beijing Games.\n\nJapan won gold at the Paris Games, and China claimed silver.\n\nLilly King ‘disappointed’ after 100m breaststroke but focused on what's to come\n\nAmerican swimmer Lilly King said she was disappointed in fifth-place finish in the 100-meter breaststroke but is now focusing on the rest of the competition in Paris.\n\n“I was really just trying to build that last 50, and things kind of fell apart last 10 meters,” said King, who won gold in the event at the Rio Games in 2016 and bronze at the Tokyo Games in 2020.\n\nSouth African Tatjana Smith won gold, Tang Qianting of China won silver, and Mona McSharry of Ireland won bronze.\n\n“Obviously, disappointed but still got a lot of meet left,” King said. She said she was shifting her focus to the 200-meter breaststroke, which is Wednesday with a final on Thursday, Paris time.\n\nWhat fueled water polo attacker Maddie Musselman on her journey to Paris\n\nThe dominant U.S. women’s water polo team is going for its fourth straight gold medal — and attacker Maddie Musselman has been a critical part of its success.\n\nHowever, last fall, Musselman's life took a turn when her fiancé, Pat, was diagnosed with cancer. Unsure at first whether she wanted to continue playing, Musselman chose to support him through treatments while continuing to train with the team.\n\nHer teammates and coaches have been inspired by the couple’s grace through the tough situation.\n\nThe pair have both been fueled by dreams of going to Paris. Now, they’re here.\n\n6,000 miles away, Stanford gymnasts cheer as Hong and Malone help USA break medal drought\n\nDistance didn’t dampen any enthusiasm in California as Brody Malone and Asher Hong helped Team USA men win its first Olympic medal in 16 years.\n\nTheir fellow gymnasts at Stanford, which both either attend or graduated from, cheered as Team USA won the bronze medal in artistic gymnastics. Hong is a sophomore, and Malone graduated last year.\n\nThe last time the U.S. men team won a medal was in the Beijing Games in 2008, when they also won bronze.\n\nSnoop Dogg puts his wingspan and “lung power” to good use when he hits the pool with Michael Phelps at the Paris Olympics.\n\nSimone Biles practiced normally after calf pain, USA Gymnastics says\n\nAmerican gymnastics star Simone Biles practiced normally today after she experienced pain in her calf during qualifiers yesterday, USA Gymnastics said.\n\nBiles, 27, will compete in all four finals, the team said.\n\nBiles was seen with part of her leg taped yesterday. Her coach, Cecile Landi, said after the competition that Biles “felt a little pain in her calf” but that she never considered pulling out.\n\nA special surprise for backstroker Ryan Murphy after his bronze swim\n\nU.S. swimmer Ryan Murphy dedicated his bronze medal in today's 100-meter backstroke to his soon-to-be daughter. Murphy told reporters his wife revealed the gender of their child, who is due in January, while he was still in the pool after his race.\n\nShe \"was holding up a sign, and it said, 'Ryan it's a girl,'\" he said. \"So I'm having a baby girl in January. That was the first time I heard the gender. We honestly both thought it was going to be a boy.\"\n\nMurphy finished third behind Italy's Thomas Ceccon and China's Xu Jiayu with a time of 52.39 seconds.\n\n\"That's a really talented field. My initial emotion is 'yeah, I want to win,' but getting third behind Thomas and Xu, they're both really talented guys,\" Murphy said.\n\n\"We've been in a place where there's parity around the world. The world is really, really talented, especially on the men's side. It's going to be exciting over the next couple of days. We do have some really good shots at gold.\"\n\nWhat does Romania’s 200M free gold winner want you to call him? ‘Chlorine Daddy’\n\nIt’s not bragging if you have the Olympic gold to back it up: Romania’s David Popovici, who gave himself the nickname “Chlorine Daddy,” won gold in the men’s 200-meter freestyle in Paris.\n\nPopovici, 19, of Bucharest, won the first gold medal for his country at the Paris Games.\n\nHe was also at the Tokyo Games in 2020 and came in fourth, failing to medal.\n\nHis other nickname is “Magician,” according to his Olympic profile.\n\nSome competitors leaving the Olympic Village and heading to hotels\n\nIf you build it, they will come — but they might not stay.\n\nThe cramped bedroom quarters inside the Olympic Village at the Paris Games have apparently raised eyebrows among some athletes, including a few who chose to ditch their new digs for hotel rooms.\n\nIn a video on TikTok, Team USA tennis star Coco Gauff gave her followers a seven-second tour of the tight spaces where women were trying to do their hair and makeup. “10 girls, two bathrooms,” Gauff wrote in a text overlay. (The video was accompanied by screaming sound effects drawn from the horror movies “Pearl” and “Hereditary.”)\n\n“I would go to a hotel,” a TikTok user commented. Gauff’s reply: “all the tennis girls moved to a hotel except me. so now just 5 girls two bathrooms.” She elaborated in another reply: “well it’s only 5 girls now so I have the room alone. roommates are very chill.”\n\nIt was not clear exactly why the tennis players left the village.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nFrederick 'Flips' Richard gave his parents no option but to get him in the gym early\n\nToday, Frederick “Flips” Richard, helped the U.S. break its medal drought as part of the bronze-winning men’s gymnastics squad in a sport he's spent most of his life practicing.\n\nRichard, 20, grew up in Stoughton, Massachusetts, and first hit the gym at 2 years old.\n\nAfter his parents saw him on their bed throwing flips he’d seen in his older sister’s gymnastics classes, they decided to put him in class, too. But he wouldn’t listen to the instructors at that age, he said, so his parents took him back when he was 4.\n\nCompetitions started when he was 6, and he “never did another sport.”\n\nStarting young helped Richard build a strong foundation, he said. Not only was he required to repeat levels to stay within age parameters, but he was also training with kids three years his senior.\n\n“And then I compete against kids my age and destroy them,” Richard said.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n'It’s really tough to compete when in your country is a war,' but Ukraine fencer going home with medal\n\nUkraine has its first piece of Paris hardware.\n\nFencer Olga Kharlan captured bronze in women’s saber today to claim her country's first medal of the Games.\n\n“Ukraine, I love you,” Kharlan exclaimed after the win. “This is for you, my dear, this is for you!”\n\nKharlan overcame a six-point deficit to defeat South Korea’s Choi Sebin.\n\n“I brought a medal to my country, and it’s the first one, and it’s going to be a good start for all our athletes who are here, because it’s really tough to compete when in your country is a war,” she said. “Every medal, it’s like gold. I don’t care [that] it’s bronze. It’s gold.”\n\nKharlan was disqualified from last year’s world championships because she refused to shake the hand of a Russian opponent. The International Olympic Committee granted her an exception to compete after the disqualification sparked backlash.\n\nRead other standout moments from Day 3 of the Paris Games.\n\nAfter disappointment in Tokyo, Katie Grimes relishes silver medal\n\nU.S. swimmer Katie Grimes said her disappointing fourth-place finish four years ago at the Tokyo Games was “all I could think about” going into the women’s 400-meter individual medley in Paris.\n\nShe won silver, behind Canada’s Summer McIntosh. American Emma Weyant came in third.\n\nIt’s the first Olympic medal for Grimes, 18.\n\n“It means a lot, just because last year, last time in Tokyo I got fourth, and that was really devastating for me,” she said.\n\nAt Tokyo, Grimes was the youngest member of the U.S. Olympic team.\n\n“It’s completely different. I feel like I’m such a different person than when I was 15, and I think everything that happened along the way led me to this moment.”\n\nGet to know Canadian gold medal swimmer Summer McIntosh\n\nLet’s get to know Canadian swimmer and Summer McIntosh, who won her first Olympic medal today in the 400-meter individual medley.\n\nCareer highlight: She beat Katie Ledecky in an 800-meter freestyle race on Feb. 8, ending Ledecky’s winning streak at that distance, which had gone back to 2010.\n\nGo-to daily dish: chocolate chip pancakes for predawn breakfast and again for breakfast No. 2 after morning training.\n\nHer name, “Summer,” was inspired by Fox’s teen drama “The O.C.” and Rachel Bilson’s character, though McIntosh said she’s not at all familiar with the show.\n\nThe family has three cats back in Toronto, one of them named Mikey in honor of all-time swimming great Michael Phelps.\n\nOlder sister Brooke McIntosh won pairs bronze at the 2022 World Junior Figure Skating Championships. Mother Jill Horstead finished ninth in the 200 butterfly at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles.\n\nPre-race hype music: Toronto’s own Drake.\n\nRead here for more on McIntosh.\n\nIs there a Covid outbreak at the Olympics? 6 athletes test positive in less than 1 week\n\nFive Australian water polo players and a British swimmer have tested positive for Covid at the Games, officials said. The uptick in cases has raised questions about the measures in place to stop the spread of Covid at the Olympics.\n\nThis year’s Games are considered the first post-pandemic Olympics. Unlike at the postponed 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, there are no strict protocols or restrictions around Covid in Paris.\n\nHowever, Covid is still spreading around the world. The U.S. is facing a summer wave, and the virus is also spreading in Europe, including in the Olympic Village.\n\nWho has tested positive?\n\nBritish swimmer Adam Peaty tested positive today, less than 24 hours after he won a silver in the men’s 100-meter breaststroke.\n\nHe is recovering and hopeful to compete in the team relay events this week, he said on Instagram.\n\n“As in any case of illness, the situation is being managed appropriately, with all usual precautions being taken to keep the wider delegation healthy,” Team GB said.\n\nPeaty’s positive test comes less than a week after five players on the Australian women’s water polo team tested positive, Paris 2024 said in a news release.\n\n“We are treating Covid no differently to other bugs like the flu. This is not Tokyo,” Anna Meares, the chef de mission for the Australian Olympic team, said at a news conference last week.\n\nAccording to Meares, the Australian athletes who tested positive are wearing masks, isolating and avoiding high-volume areas, like the gym.\n\nIs there a Covid outbreak at the Olympics?\n\nSo far, there are six confirmed cases, which does not meet the threshold to be considered an outbreak, NBC News medical contributor Dr. Kavita Patel, who has a background in public health and has worked on Covid and other pandemic responses, told TODAY.com.\n\nShe said that, based on existing guidelines, 5% of Olympians contracting Covid within a seven-day period would constitute an outbreak.\n\nCoco Gauff’s gold medal quest continues after her second-round win over Maria Lourdes Carle of Argentina.\n\nWhat's it like to cheer on your Olympic superstar children?\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nThe father of Hezly Rivera, the youngest member of Team USA women’s gymnastics, and the parents of gymnastics legend Simone Biles share the journeys they’ve all been through.\n\nSnoop Dogg spends some time with tennis legend Billie Jean King\n\nSnoop Dogg may take the gold in unlikely duos, from his surprising friendship with Martha Stewart to his hometown alumna Billie Jean King.\n\nKing posted a selfie with Snoop today, saying she was able to meet the fellow Californian at the Olympics. Snoop is one of NBC's commentators, and King is a member of the Team USA Hall of Fame.\n\n\"Both of us were born and raised in Long Beach, California, and graduated from Long Beach Polytechnic High School,\" King wrote.\n\nSurfing: USA's John John Florence out\n\n+2\n\n, and\n\nAmerican surfer John John Florence has been knocked out of the competition with a score of 9.07, falling to Australia's Jack Robinson, who scored 13.94.\n\nTough weather conditions made for a choppy performance for Florence, who had high scores in previous heats and even earned the top score of his heat over the weekend.\n\nColin Jost of \"Saturday Night Live,\" who has been serving as surfing correspondent, captured the harsh waves in an Instagram story right before Florence's heat.\n\n\"Waves have almost doubled in size since this morning...and may double AGAIN,\" a caption on Jost's story read.\n\n\"Oh, my God, whoa,\" Jost, who is normally a \"Weekend Update\" anchor on \"SNL,\" said as he looked onto the waves, his voice cutting in and out with the wind's roar.\n\nWomen's beach volleyball: USA takes win over defending silver medalist Australia in prelims\n\nThe USA women's beach volleyball team of Taryn Kloth and Kristen Nuss won its match against Australia.\n\nThe duo were playing Australia's team of Taliqua Clancy and Mariafe Artacho del Solar, silver medalists in Tokyo.\n\nThe match makes it two wins for Kloth and Nuss in their preliminary pool.\n\nBasketball: USA women dispatch Japan with ease\n\nAfter more or less sleepwalking to an 11-point lead at halftime, Team USA put its foot down in the second half, ultimately beating Japan 102-76.\n\nThis was not close. The U.S. had a comical size advantage and exploited it the entire game. A'ja Wilson scored 24 points, Breanna Stewart had 22, and Brittney Griner, Sabrina Ionescu and Kelsey Plum each had 11.\n\nThe U.S. won the rebounding battle 56-27. The States had more offensive rebounds (19) than Japan had defensive rebounds (18). Japan did hit 15 3s to keep things briefly interesting but were ultimately overwhelmed by the U.S.’ talent.\n\nThe U.S. next plays Belgium on Thursday.\n\nWomen's basketball: USA opens up big lead after three quarters\n\nTeam USA is leading Japan 79-57 after three quarters.\n\nJapan managed to stay within 11 at halftime thanks to some hot three-point shooting, but the U.S. is simply dominating the game with their size. A'ja Wilson, Breanna Stewart and Brittney Griner have combined for 55 points on 25-of-34 shooting. Japan has absolutely no answer for them in the paint. Kelsey Plum has 9 points, leading USA’s perimeter group.\n\nIn addition to the hot shooting, the U.S. is cleaning the glass, outrebounding Japan 43 to 20. They are also shooting 72.7% on two-point field-goal attempts. The States have only hit one three, but they are so big it doesn’t matter.\n\nChina holds off a furious comeback from USA in women's volleyball\n\nDefending Olympic champion Team USA narrowly lost to China 3-2 Monday, in their opening women's volleyball game.\n\nDespite having the edge in final attack and serve statistics, China held on courtesy of contributions from Zhu Ting, Gong Xiangyu and Li Yingying.\n\nThe epic five-set thriller saw China get off to a quick 2-0 set advantage before Team USA's Avery Skinner and Kathryn Plummer helped pull USA back in the crucial third set.\n\nTeam USA also had notable contributions from Andrea Drews, Haleigh Washington and Chiaka Ogbogu.\n\nTheir next match takes place Wednesday against Serbia.\n\nTable tennis: Lily Zhang advances to Round of 16 in emotional win\n\nTeam USA's Lily Zhang fell to the floor with emotion after beating Brazil's Bruna Takahashi 4 games to 2 in the women’s singles table tennis round of 32. After Zhang dominated the first two games, Takahashi battled back with two of her own before Zhang took the final two for a decisive win.\n\nZhang aims to win the United States' first table tennis medal, hoping to draw more attention to a sport she describes as lacking the respect and interest of other mainstream American sports.\n\nFellow American Amy Wang is currently playing her round of 32 match, while Kanak Jha, in men's singles, has yet to play his.\n\nSurfing: Gabriel Medina earns best wave and coolest photo\n\nIt's hard to know what's a bigger win for Brazilian surfer Gabriel Medina: earning an astonishing 9.90 in his heat today or the incredible photo taken just as he finished.\n\nMedina earned the best score for an individual wave so far during the men's third round in Teahupo’o, Tahiti. He earned a 17.40 overall score, which crushed opposing surfer Kanoa Igarashi, who earned a total of 7.04 in today's heat.\n\nRight as he finished his run, Medina had a moment to strike a pose, resulting in the gravity-defying image below.\n\nAustralian Mollie O’Callaghan sets Olympics mark in 200 freestyle\n\nReporting from Nanterre, France\n\nAustralian Mollie O’Callaghan set an Olympic record in winning the 200-meter freestyle, surpassing the mark held by her teammate and silver medalist Ariarne Titmus.\n\nO’Callaghan’s 1:53.27 edged Titmus’ record time set in Tokyo of 1:53.50. Titmus still holds the world record of 1:52.23.\n\nHong Kong’s Siobhán Haughey, who led for much of the race, took bronze.\n\nWhat's it like to try to return an elite-level volleyball serve? Let a U.S. Olympian show you\n\nFor anybody sitting on their couch thinking, \"I could do that,\" let U.S. Olympics volleyball player Erik Shoji show you what it's like to try to return an elite-level serve.\n\nShoji posted a video to TikTok in June from a recent tournament in which he tried to return a particularly wicked serve.\n\n\"That is me getting absolutely destroyed by that serve,\" he said in the video. \"And it's OK. I'm just impressed with that serve. That was crazy, that spin, that speed.\"\n\nShoji is a libero for the team, most easily identified because they wear a different jersey from their teammates. The libero is usually a defensive specialist adept at passing.\n\nShoji has posted a variety of videos from his time in Paris with the team, including some reviews of the food and their opening ceremony outfits.\n\nNew gold medalist Summer McIntosh is taking this Olympics one race at a time\n\nEarning her very first gold medal, 17-year-old Summer McIntosh is doing her best to have fun and soak in the moment.\n\nMcIntosh gave Canada a first-place finish in the 400-meter individual medley, an early birthday gift to herself just weeks before she turns 18. But the teenager says she's already turning her attention to her next event: the 200m butterfly.\n\n\"Every single time I get to race on the world stage, I learn more and more about handling it mentally and physically and emotionally,\" McIntosh said. \"I'm trying not to get too high or too low depending on my race results.\"\n\nStill, this win and her silver medal finish on Saturday were major accomplishments for the young Olympian. McIntosh competed in the Tokyo Games at the age of 14 but fell just short of the podium, placing fourth in the 400m freestyle and 200m freestyle relay.\n\nHer story can be anyone's story, she says, hoping to inspire young kids watching at home.\n\n\"If I can do it, they can do it too,\" McIntosh insists. \"I was once in their shoes watching the Rio Olympics, and now I'm here eight years later.\"\n\nWhat are the different types of fencing swords?\n\nFencing uses three different weapons: epee (or épée), foil and saber. While they share a lot of basic rules, differences between their shapes and target areas change the speeds and styles of fencing matches. If you’re new to the sport, here’s a breakdown of the three weapon types:\n\nFoil is the smallest and most lightweight weapon. Foil fencers also target the smallest area — the torso — using only the tip of the blade. Scoring is largely based on how the point was made correctly, so you might think of foil as the most technical of the three.\n\nEpee uses only the blade’s point like foil does, but is a much larger and heavier weapon. The whole body is a valid target — the goal is to hit and not get yourself hit. Fencers must carefully choose their moments to strike while positioning themselves strategically, before they jump into action to get a “touch,” or a valid hit.\n\nSaber hits not only with the tip but also the edge of the weapon, in a slashing motion, that targets everything from the waist up, including the head. These matches are usually the fastest, involving swift exchanges of movement and rigorous footwork.\n\nIn foil and saber, there’s a “right of way” rule that doesn’t apply in epee. Whoever begins an attack first takes the right of way and only that fencer may score. If both players hit at the same time, it’s up to the referees to decide who initiated the move.\n\nThere is no definitive “most difficult” or “best” weapon, though every fencer has their preference. Foil is often used as an introductory weapon to teach blade control and right of way, but that doesn’t make it any easier to strategize against your opponent.\n\nWomen's rugby: Team USA tops Great Britain 17-7 to advance to medal round\n\nTeam USA women pulled it out in the second half of their quarterfinal rugby match against Great Britain, winning 17-7.\n\nThey'll now head to the semifinal round, where they'll contend for a medal.\n\nBasketball: USA leads Japan by 11 at halftime\n\nThe U.S. women’s basketball team is taking care of business vs. Japan so far, leading 50-39 after two quarters.\n\nThe frontcourt has been dominant — A'ja Wilson and Breanna Stewart have combined for 31 points on 14-of-19 shooting. USA has an obvious size mismatch vs. Japan, and hasn’t been shy about exploiting it, constantly getting the ball into the paint. The U.S. is shooting a whopping 21-of-28 from 2-point range — a 75% field-goal percentage on non-3s.\n\nThe rebounding battle has been thoroughly dominated by the States, which has 30 boards compared to Japan’s 14. The U.S. has 10 offensive rebounds alone, which has been a massive problem for the Japanese defense.\n\nFrankly, it’s impressive Japan has stayed this close. Their strategy of letting it fly from 3 is paying off. Japan is shooting 9-of-22 from deep, and has outscored the U.S. by 24 points from the arc. That’s the only reason this game is even relatively competitive right now.\n\nShallow pool in Paris Olympics could be causing slower swim times\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics is already making waves for uncharacteristically slower times in men’s and women’s swimming meets and there may be a culprit: the water might be too shallow.\n\nThe pool constructed at the Paris La Defense Arena measures at 2.2 meters deep, falling short of deeper pools at previous Olympic games. World Aquatics put in place a minimum depth of 2.5 meters for swimming and water polo in 2023. However, when Paris had its bid for the 2024 Olympics approved in 2017, regulations allowed for a pool of 2.2 meters.\n\nA more shallow pool can impact swimming times as the water becomes more wavy due to the swimmers strokes bouncing off the surface.\n\nWhen asked in May if a more shallow pool could impact swimming times, John Ireland, the chief technical officer of Myrtha Pools who designed the last five Olympic swimming pools, believed the difference is minimal.\n\n“A lot of this is perception vs. reality,” Ireland told Yahoo Sports. “If you were to talk to many very accomplished coaches, they would say the pool has to be a minimum 3 meters deep. Most of our research shows that anything over 2 meters is frivolous. Obviously, some depth is very important. But after a certain point, it’s diminishing return.”\n\nSome swimmers competing in Paris acknowledged the slower times but can’t pinpoint the reason, cautioning that times could fall as the games progress.\n\nAmerican Katie Grimes, who won silver in the women’s 400m Monday, told Yahoo Sports, “A lot of people have been saying they don’t like the feel of the pool. I honestly don’t feel any different in it. Sure, the times have been slower, but everybody’s in the same boat, so it doesn’t really matter.”\n\nMeanwhile, Summer McIntosh, who won gold Monday in the women’s 400m, stated a pool’s depth doesn’t stand in the way of her goals.\n\n“I mean, the pool’s 50 meters, and it’s 10 lanes,” she told Yahoo Sports. “It’s an Olympic pool. I don’t think any Olympic pool should really be called slow. No matter what, everybody’s racing in the same pool. Doesn’t matter if it’s the fastest pool in the world, slowest pool in the world — I have the same goals.”\n\nSouth Africa's Tatjana Smith wins 100 breaststroke, Lilly King misses podium\n\nReporting from Nanterre, France\n\nSouth African Tatjana Smith won gold in the 100-meter breaststroke, as American Lilly King missed the podium.\n\nEvansville, Indiana, native King, who finished fifth, won gold in this event in Rio and bronze in Tokyo.\n\nSmith edged out silver medalist Tang Qianting of China and Mona McSharry of Ireland, who took home bronze.\n\nNick Itkin takes bronze in men's foil fencing\n\nTeam USA's Nick Itkin defeated Japan's Kazuki Iimura 15-12 to secure the bronze medal in men's individual foil. This is America's third foil medal in Paris, following Lee Kiefer's gold and Lauren Scruggs' silver in the women's event.\n\nItkin's bronze redeems his disappointing performance in Tokyo, where he placed 12th in the same event.\n\nStanford's Asher Hong is a daredevil on vault\n\nHong performed the hardest vault in the world in his effort to earn a medal with his team in today's final. The risky move payed off, and he cashed the check in bronze.\n\nHe is one of 60 Stanford-affiliated athletes at these Games. A standout on the gymnastics team there, he won the 2023 NCAA team championship.\n\nRugby: Team USA trails Great Britain 7-5 at the half in women's quarterfinal\n\nThe U.S. women's rugby team is trailing Great Britain after the first half of the quarterfinal, 7-5.\n\nUSA's one score was by Naya Tapper, earning 5 points with just more than a minute left to play in the first half.\n\nTikTok star Ilona Maher was close to earning more points for the team before the half closed out, but didn't quite make it.\n\nUkraine gets its first medal of the Games\n\nUkraine has gotten its first medal in these Games: a bronze in the women's saber in fencing.\n\nOlga Kharlan defeated South Korea’s Choi Sibin 15-13.\n\nKharlan is a four-time Olympian and a four-time Olympic medalist.\n\nSimone Biles' mom didn't imagine Olympic glory in her 'wildest dreams'\n\nDespite watching her train for years, Nellie Biles never imagined in her \"wildest dreams\" that her daughter would have achieved this level of success at the international level.\n\nSimone Biles' parents spoke with NBC News' Lester Holt about what it was like to raise the gymnast, who has been dubbed by so many as a the \"greatest of all time.\"\n\n\"I mean, Simone enjoyed the sport, but I didn't think that we were gonna end at the Olympics, never did,\" Nellie Biles said. \"And not ... I mean end up with one Olympics, this is her third. So, this is incredible.\"\n\nWatch \"NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt\" tonight at 6:30 p.m. ET/5:30 p.m. CT.\n\nRyan Murphy wins bronze in 100 backstroke\n\nReporting from Nanterre, France\n\nItalian Thomas Ceccon won the 100-meter backstroke, capturing gold in an event for which he holds the world record.\n\nChina's Xu Jiayu took silver, and Florida native Ryan Murphy captured bronze for Team USA.\n\nThe UC Berkeley alum Murphy won gold in the 100 back in Rio and bronze in this race in Tokyo.\n\nThis is Emma Weyant's 'redemption year,' she says after bronze win\n\nReporting from Nanterre, France\n\nEmma Weyant pushed her way to the podium today in the women's 400-meter individual medley and she said it was the best she'd swam in two years.\n\nHer bronze-medal win was a slight surprise at the end of the race, as she had been trailing just behind Great Britain's Freya Colbert. But Weyant was excited to be able to stand next to her Team USA colleague Katie Grimes at the end.\n\n\"Yeah, this is kind of like a redemption year,\" Weyant said. \"That's been my mindset the whole year ... putting in the work to get back to where I need to be.\"\n\nThe Florida native got silver in this same competition at the Tokyo Games, but has struggled on the world stage since. She earned bronze at the World Championships in 2022.\n\n\"This is the best I've been in two years, so, I'll take it,\" Weyant said.\n\nFrom TikTok star to Olympic medalist\n\nFrederick \"Flips\" Richard has been captivating an audience of nearly 1 million followers on TikTok and Instagram for many years, but now his feats have reached an even bigger stage: the Olympic podium.\n\nHe led the U.S. men to their historic bronze medal, performing five stellar routines. The highlight of his day was a high bar routine that would have clinched a silver medal at last year's world championships.\n\nHow does it feel to be an Olympic medalist? The men's gymnastics team says 'unbelievable'\n\nand\n\nThe U.S. men's gymnastics team just medaled for the first time in 16 years.\n\nThe young team, made up almost entirely of first-time Olympians, is basking in the glory that comes with a bronze medal hanging around their necks.\n\n\"I mean, it’s unbelievable,\" Asher Hong told NBC News. \"We put in so much hard work at home, and we just put our trust and belief in each other, and we went out there, had fun.\"\n\nBrody Malone, the only Olympic returner of the bunch, said it's \"incredible\" to be \"representing the best country in the world\" at the Paris Games.\n\n\"It’s just an incredible feeling any time you get to, you know, wear USA on your chest, but especially at the Olympic Games,\" Malone said.\n\nHe also shouted out the \"phenomenal\" crowd in the Bercy Arena who he said \"were backing us the whole way\" and \"made it really easy to go out there and slam our sets.\"\n\nPaul Juda, who will compete in the individual all-around final later this week, talked about the team's strong start on the vault, their second of six rotations.\n\nHe said he started with the wrong foot as he launched down the runway and \"completely blacked out\" on his journey to the platform.\n\n\"I hit the table, and I just said, 'alright, just hold it, just don't fall. Just please don't fall. Please don't fall,'\" Juda said. \"Next thing I know, the ground's at my feet, and I stuck it at the Olympic Games.\"\n\nHe said he hoped that his nearly-perfect routine \"created the momentum that we needed ... sure, looked like it.\"\n\nFrom vault until the end, \"it was just altitude and cruising, baby,\" Juda said.\n\nThe crowd erupted when Frederick Richard stuck the landing on a risky high bar routine that was full of tricks. He said it was the people around him that helped him achieve that routine, one of the standouts of the night.\n\n\"I think about all the people behind me. I knew I had the whole U.S. behind me. I knew I had these five guys cheering me on. And I knew I wanted to do the best routine possible for them,\" Richard told NBC News. \"And when you feel that like deep in your heart, it happens, and you stick that land.\"\n\nRichard will join Juda in the individual all-around final.\n\nStephen Nedoroscik anchored his team on his famed single event, the pommel horse, earning a score that snagged the third place finish for the U.S. He will compete for Team USA in the individual event final.\n\n\"I didn't know what we needed, but I knew I needed to do a good job,\" Nedoroscik said. \"I was feeling the nerves, but right before I went, these guys told me, 'We trust you. We got your back.' And when they said that, it all kind of went away.\"\n\nHe said he \"went up there, did my job,\" and as soon as he stuck the landing he realized: \"I think we might have just medaled, baby.\"\n\nBasketball: USA opens up lead to double digits\n\nA quick 8-0 run in the second quarter and the U.S. is leading Japan by 12, with just over seven minutes left in the first half.\n\nBreanna Stewart has gotten going in the second, and she’s up to six points on 3-of-3 shooting. The U.S. already has 21 rebounds, and is shooting 13-of-18 on shots from inside the 3-point line.\n\nBrody Malone soars back after a disappointing qualifying\n\nU.S. national all-around champion Brody Malone may have been knocked down in Sunday's qualifying round, but he didn't stay there.\n\nHe rallied in today's team final, bolstering the U.S. men to a historic bronze medal finish. Malone's Olympics may be over, but he'll leave Paris with some precious hardware around his neck.\n\nBasketball: USA leading Japan after one quarter\n\nUSA is leading Japan 22-15 after the first quarter of their group play opener.\n\nA'ja Wilson is leading the way with 10 points, while Kelsey Plum added five of her own.\n\nThis is a serious mismatch for Japan, which is getting crushed on the glass. The U.S. out rebounded its opponent 16 to seven in the first quarter, grabbing a whopping six offensive rebounds. The States’ frontcourt is massive, and it’s causing issues for Japan.\n\nJapan is trying to compensate by letting it fly from 3, attempting eight shots from beyond the arc in the first, connecting on three of them.\n\nBasketball: A'ja Wilson is bigger than everyone else\n\nA'ja Wilson is off to a hot start in USA’s women’s hoops opener vs. Japan.\n\nShe has eight of the team's first 12 points, as the States jumped out to a 12-7 lead about five minutes into the first quarter.\n\nThis is going to be an uphill climb for Japan, which is at a serious size disadvantage against the U.S.\n\nLed by Summer McIntosh, North America hits 400 IM trifecta\n\nReporting from Nanterre, France\n\nSummer McIntosh wore the Maple Leaf Flag as a cape and did a victory lap — on her feet — around perimeter of Paris La Défense Arena.\n\nA Canadian flag, flanked by two sets of Stars & Stripes, were raised here as \"O Canada\" played in honor of McIntosh, silver medalist Katie Grimes and bronze winner Emma Weyant following their 400 IM race.\n\nMimes entertain Olympic fans waiting in long lines\n\nReporting from Paris, France\n\nThere's some long lines to get into Olympic venues. They're being treated to a particularly French way to pass the time: mimes.\n\nSwimming: David Popovici wins gold in 200-meter free for Romania\n\nReporting from Nanterre, France\n\nDavid Popovici won the 200-meter freestyle, delivering Romania its first medal of these games.\n\nThe 19-year-old from Bucharest also won his nation’s first swimming medal since 2004.\n\nGreat Britain's Matthew Richards took silver and American Luke Hobson took bronze.\n\nFencing: Nick Itkin falls in foil semifinal, will battle for bronze\n\nIn his Olympic debut, Italy's Filippo Macchi secured a 15-11 victory over USA's Nick Itkin. Macchi will face defending Olympic champion Cheung Ka Long, from Hong Kong, in the gold medal match later today.\n\nItkin, 24, was part of the U.S. foil team that won bronze in Tokyo but finished a disappointing 12th in his individual event. He is ranked second in the world and will now fight for the bronze against Japan's Kazuki Iimura.\n\nCrowd at mens gymnastics erupts with American medal\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nWhat a moment for Team USA.\n\nThe crowd at Bercy Arena went nuts when everyone learned that the American men's team earned a spot on the podium for the first time since 2008.\n\nAs fears mount for triathlon swimming, NBC News takes a dip in the Seine\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nLess that 24 hours before the triathlon is set to begin and its still not clear whether high bacteria levels in the River Seine will force a delay. Officials say the water quality will be measured again overnight and a decision made in the early hours of Tuesday.\n\nBut it is still possible to swim in the city if you go to places like Bassin de la Villete, an artificial lake that runs into the main waterway. Today NBC News found families swimming to escape the hot weather.\n\nNine-year-old Ivy Sous said the water was \"cold but nice and refreshing,\" while Lyra Moggach, 12, said she \"exhilarated when I got in,\" and she felt fine when she got out.\n\nTo test that theory, NBC News’ took a dip and, while the water was cold, it seemed clean enough and clear enough to see your feet below.\n\nHowever, the rain that beset the opening ceremony has raised the pollution levels in the main river and forecasters are predicting a thunderstorm over Paris in the coming days, increasing the urgency to hold the triathlon.\n\nOfficials say the decision will be made independently with all the evidence.\n\nU.S. men's gymnastics team gets bronze, first team medal since 2008\n\nThey did it!\n\nTeam USA men's gymnastics made it on the podium in the team final for the first time since 2008, a goal they have been loudly chasing throughout these Paris Games.\n\nThe men's team earned bronze, behind Japan then China. Great Britain and Ukraine took fourth and fifth, respectively.\n\nToday's showing was a welcome improvement from Saturday's qualifying round, with the mostly green Olympic team hitting all of their routines.\n\nNext up: Frederick Richard and Paul Juda will compete in the all-around final and Stephen Nedoroscik will try his hand in the pommel horse final.\n\nMore sets of medals awarded at pool tonight\n\nReporting from Paris\n\nAmericans Katie Grimes, Emma Weyant, Ryan Murphy, Lilly King, Luke Hobson and Claire Weinstein have reached the finals of races set for Monday night just outside of Paris.\n\nGrimes is considered a medal contender in the 400-meter individual medley in a race that also includes Weyant and Canadian Summer McIntosh, who is listed as the favorite for the event at 8:30 p.m. local time (6:19 p.m. EDT).\n\nMurphy is slated for the 100-meter backstroke at 9:19 p.m./3:19 p.m. while King swims in the 100 breaststroke at 9:25 p.m./3:25 p.m.\n\nLuke Hobson and Claire Weinstein are racing in each of their 200 freestyle races at 8:40 p.m./2:40 p.m. and 9:41 p.m./3:41 p.m., respectively.\n\nNedoroscik does it when it counts\n\nAfter a heart-pounding lead-up, Nedoroscik delivered a historic routine for the U.S. on his one and only event, the pommel horse.\n\nHe anchored a near-perfect competition for the U.S. team with a 14.866.\n\nMen's gymnastics favorite, China, falls on high bar\n\nIn the last rotation of the day, China suffered a fall on high bar. The team is a solid favorite to medal, but there's no telling what this mistake will do to their overall standing.\n\nStephen Nedoroscik dubbed the 'Clark Kent' of pommel\n\nStephen Nedoroscik, Team USA's secret weapon today, is being called the \"Clark Kent\" of the pommel horse as viewers watch the unassuming, bespectacled athlete wait to take the stage.\n\n\"OK, Stephen Nedoroscik, the US men’s gymnastics pommel horse specialist, has these thick-rimmed glasses. He takes them off when he does pommel,\" one X user wrote. \"Is anyone else thinking Clark Kent/Superman vibes?\"\n\nAnother hit for U.S. from Brody Malone on pommel horse\n\nThe men's gymnastics team is 2/3 on pommel horse with just one more routine of the day from Stephen Nedoroscik.\n\nBrody Malone stuck his landing and earned a score of 13.700.\n\nMalone, who was plagued by falls and mistakes in the qualifiers, had a much stronger showing in the team event today.\n\nPaul Juda starts off strong on pommel horse\n\nAll smiles — and what looked like some teary eyes — after Paul Juda completed his routine on pommel horse, his last event of the day before the all-around final later this week.\n\nHe scored 13.900 — starting Team USA off very strong on their trickiest event. The men's team is just two routines away from potentially getting on the podium for the first time since 2008.\n\nWhat makes the waves at Teahupo'o perfectly dangerous for Olympic surfers\n\nIf you haven't yet watched the world's best surfers take on Teahupo'o, you're in for a treat. After making its debut in Tokyo, surfing is back with some of the world's most formidable waves - and they're massive.\n\nWatch Team USA’s Carissa Moore and John John Florence explain to Colin Jost why the Tahitian surf zone presents such a daunting challenge. Both Moore and Florence won their opening heats on Saturday and face their next ones later today.\n\nThe time is near for Nedoroscik\n\nAfter a nearly three-hour wait, the biggest moment of Stephen Nedoroscik’s career is upon him.\n\nHe's struggled in international team final competitions, but he's one of the best in the world on pommel horse. He's more than capable of clinching a historic medal for his team if all goes well.\n\nTeam USA in third place as they head into final rotation\n\nWith one rotation left to go, Team USA sits in third place behind China and Japan.\n\nOnly pommel horse stands between this team and a medal, and all-star Stephen Nedoroscik will anchor the team with what is expected to be a stand-out performance.\n\nFrederick Richard rounds the corner for Team USA\n\nAs the U.S. anchor on floor, Richard delivered a clutch routine to wrap up the penultimate rotation. One of his skills on floor stems from breakdancing, a sport that is making its Olympic debut in Paris.\n\nA podium finish is in their grasp as he earns a 14.466, but they'll have to get through the pommel horse first, which is never an easy task.\n\nAsher Hong explodes on floor\n\nAsher Hong did what he needed to on the floor, save for a few small hops and a minor step out of bounds.\n\nHe exited the mat screaming \"come on, USA!\" before receiving his score of 14.133.\n\nIt's Hong's last event of the Olympics. He won't compete for his team in the final rotation, pommel horse, and he didn't make any individual event finals.\n\nPaul Juda does his job on floor\n\nAs the U.S. men kicked off their fifth rotation of six, Paul Juda was a steady lead off on floor.\n\nHis secure tumbling landings earned him a healthy 14.200.\n\nWomen's volleyball: China wins against USA in prelim match\n\nChina's women's volleyball team defeated the defending champion United States in the preliminary round match.\n\nThe match was played over a full and nail-biting five sets.\n\nThe top three teams from each pool advance to the next round, so a lot will be riding on Team USA's next match two days from now.\n\nChina is set to play France next on Aug. 1.\n\nNo music on floor for the men\n\nWhile female gymnasts dance and flip to music on floor exercise, the men tumble a capella.\n\nThe focus remains on the acrobatics, with little artistic flair.\n\nA high bar redemption for Brody Malone\n\nHe sticks the landing!\n\nIt was a simplified bars routine for Malone, but still earned him a score of 14.166.\n\nMalone told NBC News he was gunning for a medal on the high bar — his specialty — but he did not qualify for the individual event final after a few falls in qualifiers. His performance today could earn him a team medal instead.\n\nHe appears in better shape today so far, performing on every event except for floor.\n\nThe stellar high bar routine comes off a fourth-place finish in Tokyo and a nearly career-ending knee injury on the event last year.\n\nBig risks pay off for Frederick Richard on high bar\n\nSo far, Frederick Richard has been a rock for Team USA. He performed a monstrously difficult routine on high bar, sticking his dismount and posting a 14.833.\n\nThat score would have won a silver medal at world championships last year.\n\nHalfway through the team final, Paul Juda hits high bar\n\nPaul Juda kicked off the fourth rotation of the men's gymnastics final for the U.S. with what appeared to be a nearly perfect high bar routine.\n\nHe scored 13.366 — perhaps lower than he was hoping for — and will perform again on the apparatus in the individual all-around later this week.\n\nTeam USA sits in second heading into treacherous high bar\n\nAfter three excellent rotations, the U.S. men are in second behind China. They've exceeded expectations so far, but they're headed to high bar.\n\nIt's one of the riskiest events in men's gymnastics and American fans in Bercy Arena and at home will likely be holding their breath.\n\nSnoop Dogg, Olympic sportscaster?\n\nWe all know Snoop as a smooth talker, but how does he sound as a sports commentator? Watch the rapper find an impressive flow as he narrates some of week one's highlights — it's profoundly satisfying.\n\nAsher Hong makes it 3/3 on p-bars for USA\n\nChants of \"USA\" erupted in Bercy Arena after Asher Hong became the third American to sail through parallel bars.

She now lives in Warsaw, according to her bio.\n\nField Hockey: U.S. women slide into fourth with draw against Spain\n\nThe U.S. women's field hockey team fought hard for a 1-1 tie against Spain today, managing to get fourth place in their group.\n\nIt's a much-needed rebound for the U.S. team after their loss 4-1 to Argentina just two days ago.\n\nHong rounds out vault for the men's gym team\n\nAsher Hong just performed the hardest vault in the world — and he knew he did it well.\n\nHigh fives and \"yeahs!\" preceded Hong's score of 14.833, sliding U.S. into the first place spot for now.\n\nMen's street: Eaton slides into first place with whopping 95.25\n\nJagger Eaton throws his hands up, in disbelief that he just landed his fourth trick.

It’s a difficult event and a typical weak spot for the U.S. men’s gymnastics team that they are hoping to overcome in their quest to medal for the first time since 2008.\n\nThe Peacock broadcast displayed a countdown until Nedoroscik can compete: two hours and 30 minutes remain.\n\nHe’ll work to stay focused and warm until the time comes.\n\nAfter the Olympic trials in June, Nedoroscik knew he nailed his single event, and told reporters “I had a good feeling I made this team.” This year is Nedoroscik’s Olympic debut.\n\nIt’s a risk to put someone on the team who can only perform one of six events, but Nedoroscik is a world champion on pommel horse, and he could be the missing piece to the men’s team’s long-awaited team medal.\n\nU.S. men already improved on qualifying scores\n\nThanks to Frederick Richard's improvements, the U.S. have already increased their rings score from qualification by four tenths.

The vault has an epically high difficulty of 6.4\n\nThe Biles II is the fifth skill the athlete has named after her.

After his parents saw him on their bed throwing flips he’d seen in his older sister’s gymnastics classes, they decided to put him in class, too. But he wouldn’t listen to the instructors at that age, he said, so his parents took him back when he was 4. Competitions started when he was 6, and he “never did another sport.”\n\nNow a rising junior at the University of Michigan, where he trains and competes, he’s on the precipice of fulfilling a dream shared by many young athletes.\n\n“I want to enter the Olympics with the whole country knowing, like, that’s Frederick Richard, like this man is going to do it,” he said.\n\nRead the full story here\n\nMen's street: Huston and Eaton go into first and second with fierce second runs\n\nNyjah Huston leaves a commentator speechless as he scores a big 93.37 with his second run, before Jagger Eaton also skates an impressive 91.92.

It's his only routine of the night.\n\nMen's street: Eaton falls in first run, Huston starts off strong\n\nAfter the first round of runs in the men's street final, Japan's Sora Shirai leads with the highest score of 90.11.\n\nDefending gold medalist Yuto Horigome from Japan is right behind with 89.90. American Nyjah Huston scored an 87.06 run, placing him at fifth, while fellow American Jagger Eaton had an uncharacteristic fall, putting him at seventh with a 61.77 run. He'll have to turn around his second run if he hopes for a medal.\n\nSnoop Dogg is also seen entering the arena to cheer the skaters on.\n\nRivera left off women's gymnastics lineup\n\nFor the first time since 2008, a member of the U.S. women's Olympic gymnastics team will not compete in the team final.\n\nHezly Rivera, 16, is not in the lineup for tomorrow's final.

He was only 0.02 seconds behind Italian Nicolò Martinenghi, tying with American Nic Fink.\n\nPeaty had been seeking his third-consecutive gold medal in the 100m breaststroke this year.\n\nU.S. men's gymnastics aims for first team medal since the Bush administration\n\nIn today's men’s gymnastics team final, the U.S. could medal for the first time since 2008.\n\n“We’re in a much different position now,” high performance director Brett McClure said of the Paris Olympic team. “We’re gonna be able to control our own destiny.

But the current fastest sprinter on the planet says he’s more prepared this time around to step into the blocks and bring home some medals for Team USA.\n\nIn 2021, the racial strife in the U.S. and the Covid pandemic upended life for plenty of people, including the athletes, but Lyles said part of what threw him off during the last Games was what wasn’t there: “If there is no crowd, that is most likely when you will see me lose,” he said, referring to the Tokyo Olympic Games that had extremely limited audiences.\n\n“Even this one has had its own fair share of trials and tribulations, but gosh, I can finally say I’m showing up to an Olympic Games not depressed, and it feels amazing,” Lyles, 27, said at a press conference this morning.\n\nLyles, who is hoping to win gold in the men’s 100-meter and 200-meter, told reporters that he was thriving with the help of three therapists: everyday therapist, sports therapist and a grief therapist.\n\n“As I go into this championship, this biggest stage of the world, I’ve been through the hardest parts.

In fact, it'll be the 60th and the two could not be more evenly balanced. Djokovic has won 30 of those meetings to Nadal's 29 since they first faced off on the very same Roland-Garros courts at the 2006 French Open.\n\nWhile Djokovic's career is still going strong — he recently made the final at Wimbledon before losing to Nadal's Olympic men's doubles partner Carlos Alcaraz — Nadal has suffered with injuries in what will likely be the last years of his career.
