        "text": "Est, written and directed by Antonio Pisu as his second feature film, fits hand-in-glove with the concept and purpose of SEEfest (Southeast European Film Festival Los Angeles, now in its 16th edition), not just because it shows us the “East”—in particular, the “Southeast”—but because it reveals the borders, generally all too rigid, but once in a while, porous, sometimes even becoming bridges among the countries of the region. In this case, the “East” is Hungary and, primarily, Romania; the “South” is Italy in a time before it was inundated in its own “south” and “east” by refugees from further south and east, (and before it was the first European country to be entirely devastated and shut down by COVID-19 with tourists from every direction).\n\nOf course, the flood of emigres to Italy in the last decade is not any newer than the stream of Italians to western European countries as both guest workers and potential citizens. It’s all “relative”—only a matter of geography and history, or better, economics and politics. So it’s understandable that a trio of adventurers from Cesena in Emilia-Romagna, Italy might have it in them to get it right—not the map, but the compassion—except that they are quite young, and one of them seems never even to have heard of the Berlin Wall, which is about to fall. It’s the autumn of 1989.\n\nFor all their good intentions, his “three musketeers” are incredibly naïve. Bibi’s ignorance will obviously get them into trouble; we’re on edge waiting for him to put his foot in his mouth—or a stranger’s suitcase into his car, despite the fact that all the world’s airports announce relentlessly, “Do not leave your baggage unattended or accept parcels from strangers.” So what if there’s contraband, even weapons or a bomb inside it? Pago thrives on the suspense of being in jeopardy—otherwise they could have gone to Rimini instead of Romania. He’s willing to bank on the help of one Girolamo Zorli, a Mafioso-looking compatriot from the trio’s own Emilia Romagna who buys them a round of palinka but whose shady-looking ways are ambiguous enough not to be trusted.\n\nRice is the only one who seems to care about Ceaucescu and secret police, yet he’s the very one to open the car trunk in the public square and peddle to passersby. This isn’t even to mention his ubiquitous video camera and his moviemaking of the daily living (or dying) reality of Romania; he’s more conspicuous than any street photographer. They panic when they think they’re being tailed on the road but never give a thought to curfews or tapped phones. They assume they are exempt from prosecution because they are foreigners, armed with a stockpile of cigarettes (even the officers at the border preferred their bottles of wine and Italian salamis). What really never occurs to the three knights-errant is that their mere presence or contact with the locals endangers the native Romanians, people they’ve hardly met, who offer them earnest if cautious hospitality.\n\nIn a small, all-but-empty cabaret that night, they spot the missing suitcase. The singer (Iulieta Szomyi), a lady in black—with black hair, dress, jewels and black gossamer gloves, shoulder to fingertips—takes a seat at their table and steals the scene like the Wicked Witch from the East, except that she’s mesmerizingly messianic. Her dream was to sing at the Stadt Oper in Vienna, and she is indeed theatrical. The boys (now they betray themselves as morally and socially immature) earnestly offer to buy the suitcase back, offering its worth in money. “That is not a suitcase,” she soberly states. “You know what’s inside? So why did you throw it in that field? I saw what’s inside. The money you have is not enough.” She reduces them to a nonplus. “…How much would you pay for a memory? A dream? A hope?” she asks. We see rotating close-ups on each of the boy’s faces. Pago asks her what she wants. “You should have asked me this a long time ago,” she snarls. “It’s too late now. But you, what do you want? For how long will your holidays last? This is not a market.”\n\nThe scene is almost surreal, a bit like something from Dracula’s Castle they visited earlier. So when we next see Rice on the road, his thoughts floating like ether out the car window again, it’s not clear whether the soprano voice he hears singing is on the radio or in his imagination. In fact, we’re seeing the real videotape of the trip on the screen, with dates printed in the corner, 14.10.89, hollowed-out buildings and industrial trucks passing by on the misty road, a young woman driving an old woman on a flatbed wooden horse-drawn cart with tractor tires. By now we realize this is the original footage of a trip that actually happened in 1989 when three Italians made this journey and documented it. And when our protagonists do arrive and deliver the suitcase to Emil’s family, and we hear Battiato’s song again, the refrain, “Do not abandon me” takes on another meaning as a mother and child unpack sweaters, soaps, stuffed animals, bracelets with joy. Now a truly generous idea comes to the fore: Rice’s videotape can take on an entirely new value by playing it for Adra, her daughter Adina, and her mother Costelia. They can watch it and see Emil pleading with the Italian trio, begging them to bring this “happiness” to his family, in the footage Rice shot with a totally ulterior motive.\n\nIt’s by no means the end of the road here—there are more twists and turns in Est for both the Italians and the Romanians, each one authentic to the time and place, but it’s worth noting that there is more documentary footage, including TV news clips of Ceaucescu in two opposing sequences, one at the height of his power and one as he is already retreating. And with that footage there is more irony as well, also achieved in song, such as that sung spontaneously by a hostess at a separate home visit, sung from memory, as so many Romanians and Italians (and Europeans and Latin Americans) did for years to come. The song is the wildly upbeat “Felicità” performed by Al Bano and Romina Power, almost a popular anthem of the era. While its lyrics are also fully printed on the screen (alluding to nothing but the sheer “happiness” of love), they are used for grand irony the first time, with cross-cutting between suffering Romanians, savoring only their memories, and the current nightly news broadcast of Ceaucescu speaking to thousands of Party members in a theatre palace as they clap in unison. The next time that song is sung in the film, it’s a new era, one of true felicità.\n\nViewers who stay glued to the screen for the end credits will be rewarded by outtakes from the original series of videotapes of the three Italians, Maurizio Paganelli (Pago), Andrea Riceputi (Rice), and Enrico Boschi (Bibi), shown sporadically throughout Est. Paganelli’s voice-over asks, “Did you picture it like this?” and we are realize that just as seeing the videotape of Emil meant the world to his family in the film, playing that same videotape for these three men, the real “actors,” now in their fifties, most likely imparted far more meaning than a treasured souvenir. Maybe our own experience via the film was equally eye-opening.\n\nEst\n\nDirector: Antonio Pisu; Producers: Paolo Rossi Pisu, Maurizio Paganelli; Screenplay: Antonio Pisu; Cinematography: Adrian Silisteanu; Editor: Paolo Marzoni; Music: Davide Caprelli; Set Design: Paola Zamagni, Iuliana Vilsan; Costume Design: Luminita Mihai.\n\nCast: Lodovico Guenzi, Matteo Gatta, Jacopo Costantini, Paolo Rossi Pisu, Ana Ciontea, Ioana Flora, Liviu Cheloiu, Ivano Marescotti, Sofia Longhini, Eva Issa Popovici, Iulieta Szomyi, Beatrice Balzani, Ada Condescu, Manuela Ciucur, Dana Voicu, Radu Romaniuc, Liviu Pintileasa, Ioan Peter, Virgili Aionei, Anca Florea\n\nColor, 104 min.
