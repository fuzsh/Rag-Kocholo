His family emigrated to Mexico City from Lebanon, before moving to Montreal with Yorgo in tow. At just three years of age, Yorgo was introduced to the violin, which he still studies to play to this very day.\n\nNow firmly established back in the Mexican capital working at a recording studio producing scores for popular reality shows, the musically gifted engineer spends his spare time making music that pulls from his diverse upbringing. Citing Vivaldi, alongside Latin styles such as Salsa, Reggaeton, and Bachata as influences, Yorgo has set himself the goal of making music that combines violin theory with his more contemporary music tastes.\n\nCurrently enrolled on the Audio Engineering course at the SAE Institute Mexico, Yorgo is an AVID certified Pro Tools user, and is currently producing for Ricardo Mendez, in addition to making audio for TV, and videogames, alongside his own musical projects.\n\nInstagram\n\nSpotify\n\nTwitter\n\nWebsite"
