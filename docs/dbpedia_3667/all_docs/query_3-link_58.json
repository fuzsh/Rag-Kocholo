Currently Melzer is pursuing a career as a producer and DJ in the house and techno scene and will be releasing music under her alias “Mona Yim”.

Originally starting out playing in bands, Brandsegg’s interest in composition and production started to take shape during her early studies. Gaining an interest in electronic music, she eventually decided to move to Berlin where she now produces music for others, as well as working on her material; a brooding, mystic style of electronic-pop she records under the alias Ylva Øyen. Ylva performed the song “Think About Things” by the band Daði & Gagnamagnið at the Eurovision Song Contest Final 2020 in Hamburg.\n\nInstagram\n\nSoundcloud\n\nGrowing up in an international household, Mexican producer, engineer and all-round musician Yorgo Amin Jabbour Abboud has an abundance of styles to draw upon at any one time. His family emigrated to Mexico City from Lebanon, before moving to Montreal with Yorgo in tow. At just three years of age, Yorgo was introduced to the violin, which he still studies to play to this very day.\n\nNow firmly established back in the Mexican capital working at a recording studio producing scores for popular reality shows, the musically gifted engineer spends his spare time making music that pulls from his diverse upbringing. Citing Vivaldi, alongside Latin styles such as Salsa, Reggaeton, and Bachata as influences, Yorgo has set himself the goal of making music that combines violin theory with his more contemporary music tastes.\n\nCurrently enrolled on the Audio Engineering course at the SAE Institute Mexico, Yorgo is an AVID certified Pro Tools user, and is currently producing for Ricardo Mendez, in addition to making audio for TV, and videogames, alongside his own musical projects.\n\nInstagram\n\nSpotify\n\nTwitter\n\nWebsite"
