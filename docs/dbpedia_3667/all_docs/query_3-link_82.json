        "text": "This is the list of films submitted to the Academy’s Best Foreign Language Film race, and deemed eligible by the Foreign Language Film Award Executive Committee.\n\nAlso read: Academy’s 76 Foreign Language Entries Set New Record\n\nScreenings at the Academy’s Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills begin in early October and run through early January. Members of a general committee, drawn from volunteers in all branches of the Academy, will rank each film on a scale of six to 10. The six top-ranked films will make a shortlist, joined by an additional three films added by a special executive committee.\n\nA pair of phase-two committees will then view the nine shortlisted films over the course of three days, and will choose the five nominees.\n\nAlso read: Mark Johnson Returns as Oscar Foreign-Language Chair as Race Gets Underway (Exclusive)\n\nThe submissions:\n\nAFGHANISTAN\n\n“Wajma (An Afghan Love Story)”\n\nDirector: Barmak Akram\n\nA winner of the world cinema screenwriting prize at Sundance, writer-director Akram’s film chronicles a young Afghan woman who becomes pregnant after secret liasons with a man who claims he had nothing to do with her condition, once it is revealed. This “love story” deals far more with grief, shame and disgrace than with affection or romance.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nALBANIA\n\n“Agon”\n\nDirector: Robert Budina\n\nBudina’s family drama follows two Albanian brothers who settle in northern Greece and follow very different paths as they attempt to assimilate into the new culture — one doing so lawfully, the other drawn to the mob and to the money that can be made in human trafficking. Subtitled trailer.\n\nARGENTINA\n\n“The German Doctor” (“Wakolda”)\n\nDirector: Lucia Puenzo\n\nA recent winner for “The Secret in Their Eyes,” Argentina is going a route often taken by European countries in submitting a film that deals with some element of World War II and the Holocaust. “Wakolda” tells a fictionalized story of Nazi doctor and war criminal Josef Mengele, and the Argentinian family that housed him without knowing his true identity after he fled to that country. The Samuel Goldwyn Company has U.S. distribution rights.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nAUSTRALIA\n\n“The Rocket”\n\nDirector: Kim Mordaunt\n\nSet in Laos and shot in the Lao language, follows a young boy as he leads his family and friends on a quest to find a new home. It won prizes at the Berlin, Tribeca, Sydney and Melbourne film festivals and was picked up for U.S. distribution by Kino Lorber.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nAUSTRIA\n\n“The Wall” Director: Julian Polsler\n\nA year after winning the Oscar for Michael Haneke‘s “Amour,” Austria has gone in a very different direction with a sci-fi-tinged film based on the Marlen Haushofer novel about a woman suddenly cut off from the world by an invisible wall. (Shades of CBS’s “The Dome?”) Martina Gedeck, who starred in the Oscar-winning “The Lives of Others,” has won raves for her lead performance.\n\nEnglish trailer\n\nAZERBAIJAN\n\n“Steppe Man”\n\nDirector: Shamil Aliyev\n\nOne of the two finalists from Azerbaijan that competed to be the country’s Oscar selection, “Steppe Man” follows a young man who is forced to reconsider his life in the country after the death of his father, and after the arrival of a girl who grew up in a larger village.\n\nDialogue-free trailer\n\nBANGLADESH\n\n“Television”\n\nDirector: Mostofa Sarwar Farooki\n\nThe story of the Islamic leader of a small village who bans television but finds he cannot hold back change, “Television” has played a number of international film festivals and won favorable reviews for its light, satiric and upbeat tone.\n\nTrailer/featurette (no subtitles)\n\nBELGIUM\n\n“The Broken Circle Breakdown”\n\nDirector: Felix van Groeningen\n\nOne of the best-known of the foreign submissions, “The Broken Circle Breakdown” was picked up by Tribeca Films for U.S. distribution after winning the best actress and screenplay awards at Tribeca. A relationship drama set in the world of bluegrass music, it has spawned a chart-topping soundtrack album in Europe.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nBOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA\n\n“An Episode in the Life of an Iron Picker”\n\nDirector: Danis Tanovic\n\nTanovic’s film is based on the true story of a scrap-metal worker in the Roma (Gypsy) community whose wife was refused admission to a hospital after suffering a miscarriage. Tanovic used the real-life couple to play themselves in his drama about the discrimination faced by his country’s Roma minority, and won the Grand Jury Prize at the Berlin Film Festival for his film.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nBRAZIL\n\n“Neighboring Sounds”\n\nDirector: Kleber Mendonca Filho\n\n“Neighboring Sounds” was named one of the top 10 films of 2012 by New York Times critic A.O. Scott, who called it “a subtle portrait of a society in the throes of rapid social transformation.” The film follows daily life in a seaside Brazilian neighborhood, where the arrival of a private security company increases class tensions; the film weaves many different narratives together, and according to most reviewers does so brilliantly.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nBULGARIA\n\n“The Color of the Chameleon”\n\nDirector: Emil Hristov\n\nA dark comedy about domestic spying? Hristov’s film might strike a few chords on these shores, but it deals with a former stage agent from the Communist era whose freelance efforts at espionage and subversion reportedly go to ridiculous lengths.\n\nTrailer\n\nCAMBODIA\n\n“The Missing Picture”\n\nDirector: Rithy Panh\n\nAn artful, experimental and devastating look at life in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, “The Missing Picture” is an autobiographical documentary that tells the story of Rithy Panh’s family using clay figures, along with some vintage film, to recreate the murders and atrocities. The film won the top prize in Cannes’ Un Certain Regard section, and has won widespread acclaim on the festival circuit.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nCANADA\n\n“Gabrielle”\n\nDirector: Louise Archambault\n\nCanada is one of the most successful countries in the foreign-language race over the last decade, with one winner, five nominees and two shortlisted films in the last 10 years; it has also had a nominee for the last three consecutive years, with two of those — 2010’s “Incendies” and 2011’s “Monsieur Lazhar” — coming from the micro_scope production company, which also produced this drama about a developmentally challenged woman’s quest for love and independence. The film recently had its North American premiere in Toronto.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nCHAD\n\n“GrisGris”\n\nDirector: Mahamat-Saleh Haroun\n\nOne of the best known of this year’s African entries, “GrisGris” played in competition at this year’s Cannes Film Festival. The story of a young man who has to abandon his dream of becoming a dancer (perhaps a foolish dream, since he has a paralyzed leg) to support his ailing uncle, its director won the Vulcain Prize “for an artist technician”) at Cannes.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nCHILE\n\n“Gloria”\n\nDirector: Sebastian Lelio\n\nThe title character is a vibrant divorcee in her mid-50s trying to find a space in a society that barely notices her, and Chilean actress and theater director Paulina Garcia gives a bold and nuanced performance that won her the best-actress award at this year’s Berlin Film Festival. A nominee last year for “No,” Chile could pop up again in the race with this subtly gripping drama, which Roadside Attractions plans to release in the U.S.\n\nSubtitled trailer.\n\nCHINA\n\n“Back to 1942”\n\nDirector: Feng Xiaogang\n\nAs the date in its title suggests, “Back to 1942” deals with events during World War II, though it is set in the conflict between China and Japan (the “Sino-Japanese War”) rather than the WWII arenas so often the subject of other foreign-language submissions. A large-scale, epic undertaking, the film was named Best Film of Mainland and Taiwan at the Hong Kong Film Awards, though reviews outside China have been mixed.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nCOLOMBIA\n\n“La Playa DC”\n\nDirector: Juan Andres Arango\n\nAn entry in the Un Certain Regard section of Cannes in 2012, “La Playa DC” follows a teenager (and barber’s apprentice) trying to make his way in the ghettos of Bogota, and searching for his little brother, who’s become a drug addict and sometime dealer. It’s a low-key character study of an impassive young man on a dead-end path, and has won praise for its subtlety and sense of authenticity.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nCROATIA\n\n“Halima’s Path”\n\nDirector: Arsen Anton Ostojic Based on a true story, Ostojic’s film tells of a Bosnian Muslim woman who raised a son for her unmarried niece, and who must convince her niece to give a DNA sample so that she can recover the bones of the boy, who was killed in the war of the early 1990s. It was released in Bosnia and Croatia last fall, and has been doing well on the festival circuit for the past year.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nCZECH REPUBLIC\n\n“The Don Juans”\n\nDirector: Jiri Menzel\n\nWhen the country’s initial submission, Agnieszka Holland’s “Burning Bush,” was disqualified because it was made for HBO Europe, the Czech Republic turned to one of its most iconic directors, Jiri Menzel. (His first film, “Closely Watched Trains,” won the foreign-language Oscar in 1968.) The 75-year-old film and theater director has set this comedy in the world of opera, with a small-town production of Mozart’s “Don Giovanni” providing the setting and the opera director serving as a surrogate for Menzel himself.\n\nTrailer (no subtitles)\n\nDENMARK\n\n“The Hunt”\n\nDirector: Thomas Vinterberg\n\nOne of the few entries to have already received a U.S. release, Vinterberg’s dark drama stars Mads Mikkelson, who was named best actor at 2012’s Cannes for his portrayal of a small-town schoolteacher who is accused of molesting a schoolgirl, and who must deal with a town that rushes to believe the worst about a man they’d always trusted. The film, an award winner at several festivals, was chosen from a three-film shortlist that also included the unconventional documentary “The Act of Killing.”Subtitled trailer\n\nDOMINICAN REPUBLIC\n\n“Who’s the Boss?” (“Quien Manda?”)\n\nDirector: Ronni Castillo\n\nThe feature directorial debut of Castillo deals with a man and woman, both of whom have a history of ending relationships quickly and staying in charge. When they get together, their resolve is tested and the power struggles begin.\n\nTrailer (no subtitles)\n\nECUADOR\n\n“Porcelain Horse”\n\nDirector: Javier Andrade\n\nDrugs, illicit love and punk music are the favorite pastimes of the central characters in “Porcelain Horse,” which takes its title from the family heirloom that the film’s protagonist tries to steal and sell for drug money. It won the jury award for best narrative feature at the Cine Las Americas International Film Festival in Austin, TX.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nEGYPT\n\n“Winter of Discontent”\n\nDirector: Ibrahim El Batout\n\nThe Egyptian entry is a politically-charged work, not surprising from a country in turmoil. The film uses the stories of three different individuals – a security officer, a TV journalist and an engineer – to details attempts on the part of the Hosni Mubarak regime to quell the 2011 revolution; it includes depictions of state-sponsored torture in the wake of the Tahrir Square uprising.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nESTONIA\n\n“Free Range”\n\nDirector: Veiko Ounpuu\n\nThe second film from Ounpuu to be an Oscar foreign-language contender (2010’s “The Temptation of St. Tony” was submitted but not nominated), “Free Range” tells the story of a young newspaper journalist who loses his job as he discovers that his girlfriend is pregnant.\n\nTrailer (no subtitles, but it’s set to an English-language song)\n\nFINLAND\n\n“Disciple”\n\nDirector: Ulrika Bengts\n\nA coming-of-age drama set on the eve of World War II, “The Disciple” deals with a teenage boy who goes to work for a lighthouse keeper on an island in the Baltic Sea and whose friendship with the lighthouse keeper’s son gradually turns to rivalry.\n\nFinnish trailer\n\nFRANCE\n\n“Renoir”\n\nDirector: Gilles Bourdos\n\nA Cannes entry in 2012, Bourdos’ film is set in 1915 and deals with the painter Renoir, his on Jean Renoir (who would become a significant filmmaker) and a woman who enters both their lives. It grossed $2.2 million during its U.S. release earlier this year.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nGEORGIA\n\n“In Bloom”\n\nDirectors: Nana Ekvtimishvili and Simon Gross\n\nA look through this year’s foreign-language submissions is something of a tour of the effect of war on a variety of different countries, and Georgia is no exception. Lika Babluani and Mariam Bokeria shared the best-actress award at the Sarajevo Film Festival for their portrayals of teenage girls coming of age during the country’s post-Soviet civil war.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nGERMANY\n\n“Two Lives”\n\nDirector: Georg Maas\n\nBased on a true story about the reverberations from the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, “Two Lives” stars Juliane Kohler as a German woman living in Norway, who after the fall of the Berlin Wall is threatened by the false identity under which she’s been living. Norwegian cinema icon Liv Ullman also appears in the film.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nGREECE\n\n“Boy Eating the Bird’s Food”\n\nDirector: Ektoras Lygizos\n\nGreece scored a shocking but provocative nomination with its aggressively weird “Dogtooth” in 2010 and since then has submitted other purposefully surreal films to the Oscars without success. “Boy Eating the Bird’s Food” is reportedly less weird, but also a stark and challenging work of social realism that uses three days in the life of a starving young man to stand in for the ravaged state of contemporary Greece.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nHONG KONG\n\n“The Grandmaster”\n\nDirector: Wong Kar-wai\n\nBased on the life story of the martial arts legend Ip Man, Wong Kar-wai’s film attracted backing from Megan Ellison and a U.S. release from the Weinstein Company. It is the highest-profile entry in the category and has already screened at the Academy during a tribute to its veteran director. The version seen by Stateside audiences is 20 minutes shorter than the original Chinese version.\n\nEnglish trailer\n\nHUNGARY\n\n“The Notebook”\n\nDirector: Janosz Szasz\n\nA coming-of-age story set in World War II, Szasz’s film was a prize-winner at this summer’s Karlovy Vary Film Festival. Based on the 1986 bestseller by Agota Kristof, it follows two teenage brothers sent to live with their grandmother during the war.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nICELAND\n\n“Of Horses and Men”\n\nDirector: Benedikt Erlingsson\n\nActor and theater director Erlingsson makes his film-directing debut with this rural romance (with comedic touches) set amidst a community of horse breeders, and culminating in the annual autumn round-up of horses. The film explores “the human streak in the horse and the horse in the human,” according to the Icelandic Film and TV Academy, which made the selection.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nINDIA\n\n“The Good Road”\n\nDirector: Gyan Correa\n\nThe first film in the Gujarati language to represent India in the Oscar race, “The Good Road” tells the stories of a truck driver, a middle-class couple and an 11-year-old girl whose paths cross on a highway in rural Gujarat. The Indian selection committee praised it for showing “the unknown India,” but it drew criticism from some who felt that Ritesh Batra’s acclaimed and audience-friendly “The Lunchbox” would be far more to the Academy’s liking.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nINDONESIA\n\n“Sang Kiai”\n\nDirector: Rako Prijanto\n\nWhile the documentary “The Act of Killing” presents a devastating picture of Indonesia’s past, the country’s official entry revisits and reportedly celebrates the struggle for independence on the part of Hasyim Asyari, whose Nahdatul Ulama movement was implicated, almost two decades after his death, in the mass killings that “The Act of Killing” documents. The country’s vice president has seen the film and encouraged all young people to watch it.\n\nTrailer (no subtitles)\n\nIRAN\n\n“The Past”\n\nDirector: Asghar Farhadi\n\nThe Iranian-born director Farhadi was living in France when he made this film, a Paris-set, French-language drama about a married couple whose long-buried secrets surface when they reunite to sign divorce papers. Berenice Bejo won the best-actress jury prize at Cannes, and Sony Pictures Classics acquired U.S. rights to the film.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nISRAEL\n\n“Bethlehem”\n\nDirector: Yuval Adler\n\nThe story of an Israeli secret service agent and the teenage Palestinian informant he’s been cultivating since the age of 15, “Bethlehem” won six Ophir Awards at Israel’s version of the Oscars. The thriller has won rave reviews, and Israel is hoping to win its fifth nomination in the last seven years, a feat unequalled by any other country over that time.\n\nSubtitled film clip\n\nITALY\n\n“The Great Beauty”\n\nDirector: Paolo Sorrentino\n\nCompared to Fellini’s “La Dolce Vita” and Rossellini’s “Rome, Open City” in the way it paints a portrait of a glamorous city at a specific time in history, Sorrentino’s drama views current-day Rome through the eyes of a journalist whose early work has made him famous and afforded him a glamorous lifestyle but little real satisfaction. Toni Servillo plays the journalist in an opulent, visually stunning film that premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nJAPAN\n\n“The Great Passage”\n\nDirector: Ishii Yuya\n\nRather than picking the festival favorite “Like Father, Like Son,” which DreamWorks currently has in its sights for a U.S. remake, the Japanese selection board went with a softer, friendlier, more romantic film, the story of a dictionary editor in love.\n\nTrailer (no subtitles)\n\nKAZAKHSTAN\n\n“Shal” (“The Old Man”)\n\nDirector: Ermek Tursunov\n\nA variation on Ernest Hemingway’s “The Old Man and the Sea,” Tursunov’s film is set on the Kazakh steppes and deals with the primal confrontation between an aging hunter (played by a non-professional) and a wolf. The director’s 2009 film “Kelin” made the Oscar shortlist but wasn’t nominated.\n\nTrailer (no subtitles)\n\nLATVIA\n\n“Mother I Love You”\n\nDirector: Janis Nords\n\nA jury winner at this year’s Los Angeles Film Festival, Nords’ film follows a 12-year-old boy who lives with his mother but falls into a life of petty crime with his friends on the streets.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nLEBANON\n\n“Blind Intersections”\n\nDirector: Lara Saba\n\nAfter the disqualification of the initial Lebanese entry, “Ghadi,” the country was given another chance to submit, and chose the narrative feature debut of Saba, who interweaves three stories to paint a sobering picture of a Beirut through characters facing drugs, prostitution and child molestation. Saba said her goal was to dissect “a city that rubs us, steps on us and tears us apart.”\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nLITHUANIA\n\n“Conversations on Serious Topics”\n\nDirector: Giedre Beinoriute\n\nOne of the most unconventional films in the race, “Conversations on Serious Topics” appears to deliver exactly what its title promises: conversations, mostly with children and young adults, about serious topics. Devoid of “exterior action, props, landscapes or special effects,” according to its production company, the experimental, minimalist documentary runs only 65 minutes, which will likely make it the shortest contender in the category.\n\nSubtitled trailer.\n\nLUXEMBOURG\n\n“Blind Spot”\n\nDirector: Christophe Wagner\n\nThe first thriller ever directed in the Luxembourgish language, “Blind Spot” is a film noir murder mystery set in the world of drugs and prostitution, areas Wagner had previously explored in documentaries. The director says he thinks of this film as a political statement, but that he wanted to “manipulate [the audience] for their own good.”\n\nTrailer (French and English subtitles)\n\nMEXICO\n\n“Heli”\n\nDirector: Amat Escalante\n\nYet another teenager-on-the-mean-streets drama in a field seemingly crowded with them, Escalante’s film fascinated some and repelled others at Cannes with its unflinching and blood-soaked look at a culture of drug-fueled violence. The jury gave Escalante its best-director award for a film that has been almost universally described as serious, unpleasant and uncomfortable to watch.\n\nTrailer (no subtitles)\n\nMOLDAVA\n\n“All God’s Children”\n\nDirector: Adrian Popovici\n\nInformation is scant about the first-ever submission from Moldava, whose stars include one recognizable North American actor, Michael Ironside (“Top Gun,” “Total Recall”). Judging by the non-subtitled trailer, the film finds an American couple trying to adopt a child pulled into a world of violence, prostitition and human trafficking.\n\nTrailer (no English subtitles)\n\nMONTENEGRO\n\n“Ace of Spades — Bad Destiny”\n\nDirector: Draska Djurovic\n\nLike Serbia’s entry, Montenegro’s submission looks back to the Balkan civil wars of the 1990s.

A romance between a dance teacher and one of her students, the film stirred up additional controversy because director Subama Thapa is a naturalized French citizen. “I am trying to break through the stereotypes that exist in Nepali filmmaking today,” said Thapa in a statement.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nTHE NETHERLANDS\n\n“Borgman”\n\nDirector: Alex Van Warmerdam\n\nA dark, twisted fantasy about a seemingly homeless man who shows up at an upper-class home, asks to use the bath and ends up terrorizing the family, “Borgman” is a surreal dream – as Sasha Stone wrote at TheWrap when it played at Cannes, “It isn’t just any dream, but a bizarre, rambling, vivid dream that startles you awake in a cold sweat: a naked man straddling you, staring at you while you sleep, making you dream terrible things about your husband as you’re being seduced by Borgman.”\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nNEW ZEALAND\n\n“White Lies”\n\nDirector: Dana Rotberg\n\nBased on a novella by Witi Ihimaera, the author of the Oscar-nominated “Whale Rider,” “White Lies” is set in the early 20th Century in a small New Zealand town, where three very different women are brought together by a secret that could destroy one of them.

One member of the Pakistani jury that made the selection called it “funny, natural, hip and casually audacious.”\n\nTrailer (no subtitles)\n\nPALESTINE\n\n“Omar”\n\nDirector: Hany Abu-Assad\n\nAbu-Assad directed 2005’s “Paradise Now,” the only Palestinian selection every nominated for an Oscar in this category.

Peru was a surprise nominee in 2010 for “The Milk of Sorrow.”Subtitled trailer\n\nPHILIPPINES\n\n“Transit”\n\nDirector: Hannah Espia\n\nWhile the UK has submitted a film set in the Philippines, the Philippines has gone with a drama set in Israel, and dealing with a single father and immigrant worker whose children are subject to deportation under new Israeli law.

Man of Hope”\n\nDirector: Andrej Wajda\n\nFour of Wajda’s films (“The Promised Land,” “The Maids of Wilko,” “Man of Iron” and “Katyn”) have been nominated for foreign-language Oscars, and the director was given an honorary Academy Award in 2000. Of this biopic that recently screened at the Venice and Toronto Film Festivals, the most iconic Polish director tackles the iconic Polish leader, Wadja has said he is trying to bring the truth to Polish moviegoers rather than entertaining the Western audience. Reviews out of Venice and Toronto said Wadja has delivered a straightforward, old-fashioned biopic, but one that does not whitewash controversial elements of Walesa’s life and career.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nPORTUGAL\n\n“Lines of Wellington”\n\nDirector: Valeria Sarmiento\n\nSet in the Peninsula War, a conflict between France and an alliance of Spain, Portugal and the UK over control of the Iberian Peninsula in 1810, the film (and a linked television series) stars John Malkovich as the Duke of Wellington, who constructed the Lines of Torres Vedras and helped drive the French back.

On the other hand, Thailand didn’t have any luck when it submitted the Cannes’ winning art movie “Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives,” so why not go in a different direction?\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nTURKEY\n\n“The Butterfly’s Dream”\n\nDirector Yilmaz Erdogan\n\nA big hit in its native country, Erdogan’s romance follows two poetry students who are forced into coal mining in wartime Turkey, and who compete for the affections of a young woman by writing poetry.

Co-director Avedikian also plays the title role.\n\nSubtitled trailer\n\nUNITED KINGDOM\n\n“Metro Manila”\n\nDirector: Sean Ellis\n\nWhen the UK submits an entry, it typically does so with a film in the Welsh or Irish language – but since AMPAS rules no longer require a country to choose a film in its own language, Sean Ellis’ Philippine-set drama qualified this year. The film stars Jake Macapagal as a man who leaves the impoverished countryside to take work at an armored truck company in Manila.\n\nTrailer\n\nURUGUAY\n\n“Anina”\n\nDirector: Alfredo Soderguit\n\nUruguay has submitted a rare animated entry, hoping to follow in the footsteps of the animated 2008 nominee “Waltz With Bashir.” But “Anina” is aimed at a younger audience, with its story of a young girl traumatized by the fact that her name is a palindrome.\n\nTrailer (no subtitles)"
