        "text": "The State of Cinema is a new opinion column that will discuss current phenomena that are influencing contemporary cinema (for the better or worse). In our second editorial, we make a summary of 2020, of the pandemic’s devastating effects on the Romanian cultural sector and the changes that it prompted, while trying to figure out how things will work out in the future.\n\n***\n\nThe story behind Radu Jude’s triumph at the Berlinale is an eerily familiar one in the Romanian cultural sector: that of a film which, despite the major setbacks it faced during production (in this case, the ones caused by the pandemic and the restrictions it prompted), turned into a historical achievement of Romanian cinema, revitalizing hopes for local films, while riding on the coattails of the unprecedented success of Alexander Nanau’s multi-award-nominated documentary, Collective. But let’s not get too excited about things: Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn might very well be the last Romanian film to win a major award for the foreseeable future (sans the aforementioned “Collective” – I’m referring to future films), even though the end of the pandemic is increasingly visible. What lies at the base of this bleak forecast is how the events of 2020 played themselves out, as well as the local authorities’ inefficient response to the pandemic’s effects on the cultural sector – which, in a similar vein, had to use special, sometimes even novel solutions in order to survive.\n\nThese days will mark the one-year “anniversary” of the very first measures that restricted public activities due to the coronavirus pandemic – and a short review of the measures which were taken to protect the local cultural sector and, implicitly, Romanian cinema, allows us to see precisely why the future isn’t optimistic at the moment. Decree no. 195/2020 was imposing a state of emergency across the entire territory of Romania, mandating the closure of all spaces that didn’t sell foodstuffs and a lockdown that prevented citizens from leaving their homes without justificative papers, which only allowed for very specific circumstances. On the 16th of March, together with the hospitality industry and the vast majority of the physical commerce sector, theaters and cinemas all across Romania were forced to shut their doors, thus leading to the cancellation of several film festivals that were due to take place during the spring – the most high-profile such event being One World Romania – or, at the very least, causing their postponement, as was the case of Transilvania IFF. (Some cinemas and cine-clubs, such as the one operated by FILM MENU, voluntarily suspended their activities even before the decree was published.) Of course, all the film shoots that were due to take place in that period were also canceled, just as film schools (including the entire educational sector) were forced to move their activities online, thus affecting student film production. Last but not least, the distribution of new releases was massacred – amongst Romanian films, the most affected were Ivana the Terrible (dir. Ivana Mladenovic), 5 Minutes Too Late (dir. Dan Chisu), and Uppercase Print (dir. Radu Jude, which amassed little over 3000 entries in its short run in cinemas); others, such as Malmkrog (dir. Cristi Puiu) or The Exit of the Trains (dir. Radu Jude) couldn’t even be released anymore. The only ones whose occupations were relatively unharmed during the lockdown were film editors, critics, and curators/programmers – as their work was already taking place in a semi-isolated environment, that was heavily reliant on digital technology.\n\nOnce the lockdown was decreed and the state started offering financial support to those who lost their jobs due to the pandemic, it became rapidly clear that artists and cultural workers, the vast majority of whom win their money based on authors’ rights contracts (according to a report of the National Institute for Cultural Research and Formation), needed solutions that would differ from those for workers employed on regular contracts. The government’s proposal, which was published towards the end of March, was intensely criticized in the media: first of all, because the eligibility factor depended on the existence of an individual intellectual rights contract that had to be signed no longer than three months before the triggering of the state of emergency, but also the fact that the state offered the sums without applying taxation; these sums of money ended up being delivered for only two and a half months. Yet another controversial decision (which Romanian producers claim could even lead to the paralysis of new productions in coming years) was that of the Romanian Film Center (CNC) – which not only shuttered down almost completely during the lockdown and didn’t offer any concrete help to the industry, but also announced that, despite the local Cinematography Law, which mandates the organization of at least two new financing sessions for films per year, it will organize no new sessions until the Cinematography Fund (whose financing sources were crippled by the pandemic) will not collect at least 20 million LEI in its coffers. Even despite a meeting of several film industry representatives with the Prime Minister at the time, Ludovic Orban, and members of his cabinet, one of the few such meetings to ever occur since the Revolution, almost nothing was done to solve this situation or to unblock as-of-yet inactive mechanisms of funding local cinema production. Last but not least, in March, a piece from the façade of the Eforie Cinematheque collapsed, igniting a debate regarding the institution’s importance in the preservation of Romanian film history, in the context of the ever-dwindling number of arthouse theaters in the Capital.\n\nOn the other hand, the lockdown also determined the rise of online film festivals, which perhaps was the single most important solution for the pandemic’s hardships that was discovered and implemented by event organizers all around the world, whose more or less tacit competition with streaming giants such as Netflix or Amazon Prime was the main controversy facing contemporary cinema before the pandemic, and with whom they were now locked in direct competition. And not just them, but also with the bête noire of domestic cinema: piracy, the second greatest “enemy” of the arthouse industry. If online festivals initially proved to be both novel and the red line which kept the circuit alive for the better part of the past year, offering a much-needed sense of community, they rapidly fell out of favor: cinema entered a head-on fight with the entirety of the Internet, and the shifting of cultural activities towards the online medium led to a competition for spectators’ attention spans that was greater than ever (compounded with the depression and burn-out caused by physical isolation), although, hypothetically speaking, accessing these festivals was easier (and cheaper) than ever. But in this first, avantgarde phase of online festivals, before A-class events signed on for digital editions, there did exist a certain degree of playfulness to them: which led to the birth of a very special and historically particular subgenre of shorts, namely quarantine films – most of which (to this date) were commissioned by festivals such as the one in Thessaloniki or the European Film Festival. The ones that got old even faster were Zoom conferences, which became omnipresent on social media, and despite rare glimpses of genius (such as the iconic Instagram live session of the legendary Jean-Luc Godard), they rapidly became extremely annoying. A single feature-length film was produced in Romania during the lockdown, which made use of the Zoom aesthetics: 9 Love and Hate Stories in Isolation, by Dan Chisu, a film that, beyond its status as an artifact of its times, was almost universally panned by critics. Starting with summertime, when a few festivals could be reprised in person, several Romanian films started to premiere in international festivals (and scoring the period’s only significant award, won by young filmmaker Lucia Chicos with her short, “Contraindications”, in the Cannes Cinefondation section). A short list: Otto the Barbarian (dir. Ruxandra Ghitescu) and Our Father (dir. Andrei Dascalescu) at Sarajevo; Mia Misses Her Revenge (dir. Bogdan Theodor Olteanu), Toni and his friends (dir. Ion Indolean) and Unidentified (dir. Bogdan George Apetri) at Warsaw; Poppy Field (dir. Eugen Jebeleanu) at Tallinn; Lost Kids on the Beach (dir. Alina Manolache) and Everything Will Not Be Fine (dir. Adrian Pirvu, Helena Maksyom) at IDFA; and, last but not least, Us Against Us (dir. Andra Tarara) at Ji.hlava.\n\nIf festivals (such as OWR and TIFF) and a few film productions (like “Bad Luck Banging…”) could be resumed throughout the summer, once lockdown was over, their activities being regulated by a common order of the Ministries of Health and Culture, cinemas and theaters remained closed throughout the entire duration of the summer, even if their counterparts in other European countries had reopened, as many social media critics pointed out that betting agencies and casinos all over Romania had stayed open throughout this entire period. With few exceptions, cinemas reopened only in September, their maximum capacity being limited between 30%-50% of total seats (depending on the region), and imposing the mandatory use of face masks during events. This proved to be short-lived, however – the sudden and violent outburst of the pandemic’s second wave in October led to their re-closure, after just a couple of weeks. The only film festivals that took place during autumn were thus forced to find solutions to circumvent the fact that cinemas were closed, along with moving parts of their selections online. Les Films de Cannes à Bucarest, in parallel with its free online program centered on Romanian films that had premiered during the summer and early fall, was the first local festival to implement drive-in screenings, along with open-air events. Astra Film Festival organized some of its screenings at a lakeside location, giving spectators the possibility to watch films from little boats. And, last but not least, BIEFF screened the vast majority of its selection in four galleries across Bucharest, in a loop.* Another commendable effort was the launch of the F-Sides feminist cine-club during the summer, one of the very few new projects related to cinema that appeared during 2020; on the other hand, other events such as the FILM MENU cine-club and the Filmul de Piatra short film festival no longer took place, at all.\n\nRight now, despite the vaccination campaign against COVID-19 having already started, and the opening date of the third and final phase of vaccination inching closer, things still look bleak. After a short period of being open again (which varied in length, depending on the numbers of the pandemic in each local region), cinemas are starting to close again, as what seems to be a third wave of the epidemic is taking shape. A new funding scheme for the independent sector has been mired in controversy ever since it has been announced in late November, and might only be put in practice next month, although artists already have to pay the taxes for the previous furlough, which were doled out a whole year ago, and despite some rumors, no new financing sessions for films organized by the CNC are to be seen on the horizon. The only recent positive signals seem to be the naming of critic and cultural expert Iulia Popovici as Secretary of State of the Ministry of Culture (the very same one that was busy waging a war of words in the press with Alexander Nanau, as if there was nothing better to do), as well as the promise of Prime Minister Florin Citu to organize a meeting with representatives of the film industry, which Ada Solomon recently revealed. (But, considering how “efficient” the industry’s last meeting with the PM and his cabinet was, I can only be skeptical towards an eventual result.) And that is not even mentioning the fact that the government’s promise to prioritize cultural workers in the third phase of vaccination hasn’t come to fruition, despite a scandal provoked by the revelation that employees of State Theaters were able to get vaccinated in the second phase, thus creating a discriminatory state of affairs.\n\nThe way things are at the moment, the cultural sector’s subsistence seems to be entering its twelfth hour. If the authorities fail to take urgent measures, we might face a continuation of 2020’s cultural void – just that, this time around, anti-coronavirus measures won’t be the ones at fault for event cancellations or the temporary closure of theaters, but rather, the culprit will be the economic crisis that is affecting the cultural sector, which could even lead to the permanent shutting of some cultural spaces or the disappearance of some festivals. (Festivals which had already started to disappear even before the pandemic, due to unstable financing – as was the case of NexT.) And even if the very few independent cinemas in Romania will be able to survive, what they will be screening might not even be new Romanian films, from a certain point onwards.\n\nUPDATE, 11.03.2021: Today, after the original publishing of this piece, the CNC has announced its first film financing session of the year.\n\nMain image: promotional still of Radu Jude’s Bad Luck Banging or Lonny Porn (2021)."
