        "text": "This article explores the organisation and whereabouts of the neo-Legionary movement as it was (re)established in Romania in the 1990s. These groups and individuals defined themselves as Legionary, thus entering into the tradition of the Iron Guard/the Legion of Michael the Archangel, which was founded by the charismatic \"Captain\" Corneliu ZELEA CODREANU (1899-1938). Based on unique fieldwork conducted during the late 1990s, however, this article shows that neo-Legionaries were not unified within a single organisation at that time, but rather that they formed a loosely interconnected network of groups and figures. That is to say, neo-Legionary groups and individuals comprised a loose movement that was characterised by a particular set of references, a shared ideology and symbolism, and a strong family resemblance. Though it had significant ideological structures in common with the inter-war Legion and even mimicked its predecessor‘s organisation and rituals to some extent, the neo-Legionary movement of the first post-Communist decade was primarily a protest movement. It put forward a radical religious, social and political critique of the Communist legacy. This message was, nevertheless, mainly expressed through references to Codreanu‘s movement. The neo-Legionaries‘ political ideas and activity were influenced by their belief that transcendental forces influence life on earth. Their ideology fuses fascism, ethnic nationalism, anti-Semitism, Romanian folklore, mysticism and an idiosyncratic interpretation of Orthodox Christianity.\n\nA deplorable situation exists in the literature on Legionarism. A series of distortions of historical facts have been perpetrated and perpetuated in published works, whether directly on the Legionary Movement or indirectly covering the overall interwar scene in Romania and Europe or on “generic fascism”. This is especially the case in the new genre of information, the cyber media (the internet) on this subject. This essay attempts to shed some light on the historical facts related to the subject of Legionarism and at least in part clarify the historical record by analyzing some of these sources in question.\n\nA deplorable situation exists in the literature on Legionarism. A series of distortions of historical facts have been perpetrated and perpetuated in published works, whether directly on the Legionary Movement or indirectly covering the overall interwar scene in Romania and Europe or on “generic fascism”. This is especially the case in the new genre of information, the cyber media (the internet) on this subject. This essay attempts to shed some light on the historical facts related to the subject of Legionarism and at least in part clarify the historical record by analyzing some of these sources in question.\n\nIn recent years, many works dealing with the phenomenon of the Legionary Movement have appeared. The scholars tried to understand the Iron Guard from a synchronous historiographical perspective called the \"new consensus\", theorized by Roger Griffin. In this context, the present article aims to analyse the works of Oliver Jens Schmitt, Tatiana Niculescu, Roland Clark and Traian Sandu. In their work, the writers adopt a broader understanding of the legionary phenomenon as an indigenous version of European fascism, reconfiguring Captain Codreanu's image in two provocative biographies. Clark’s book analyses the local and regional activity of the Iron Guard while Sandu’s work uses sociological research. A first part aims to compare the authors’ interest on researching the subject, as well as the methodological similarities and differences between their books. Each work is analysed separately, seeking to observe traits of their specificity and originality. The second part focuses on the common elements of each author, followed by a section of comparative perspectives, where we observe how the student activity and the religious spirit (two support pillars of the Iron Guard) may involve multiple valences of historiographical interpretation.\n\nIn the literature of the interwar period and World War II, the severe divide between diverse political conservative trends, including authoritarian conservatism and right wing extremism, had been obvious for some time. In the historiography on the Legionary Rebellion in Romania, as it is frequently termed, of 21-23 January 1941, this perspective was disregarded, despite its considerably explanatory potential. This work takes a novel approach to this topic, analyzing with historical-archival arguments the great clash between two eminently incompatible organizations: one of the elites with authoritarian traditional leanings, and the other revolutionary, intolerant of the old hierarchies and inspired by European fascism, promoting national purification through violence and the annihilation of others. This research will reconsider some of the key notions and assumptions underpinnings the disputes and emphasize a sequence of critical decision-making activities based on unstudied Romanian Secret Service data 1. Also, the work involves a critical analysis of the information regarding the legionary insurgency through the lens of interwar intelligence and their presentation to the readers, whether they are specialists or a history enthusiasts, both from a historical, analytical, and especially applied and exemplary perspective.\n\nAfter the November-1946 elections, the leaders of the Legionary Movement decided to stop observing the protocol with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, negotiated in late 1945 by Nicolae Petrașcu with the Communist Party officials. The authorities initiated campaigns for arresting active legionaries, which caused a panic behaviour among the adepts of the organization. The leaders of the Movement were summoned to react as the communists, once having legally reached to power, wanted to repress the legionaries. On the other hand, Horia Sima, in Western Europe, wanted in his turn for the Legionary Movement to give up the neutrality politics. With American support, he disposed organizing within the country an information service in favour of the democratic powers. To this purpose, Eugen Teodorescu was sent in the country, with the mission of setting in motion a legionary network that should obtain whatsoever information on the Communist and Soviet activity in Romania. Consequently, in late 1947, the Legionary Movement manifested again as opposition force against the regime installed in Bucharest after the 23rd of August 1944, paradoxically benefiting of USA’s support. The Americans were disposed to “erase” the legionaries’ extremist past, hoping they would find allies disposed to make active opposition within Romania’s borders.\n\nAbstract: Drawing on the heuristic value of the theoretical and methodological insights of the cultural approach to the study of fascism, the present work focuses on the spiritual components used by the Romanian Iron Guard in order to shape the profile of its followers, with the final goal of creating a “new man”. The process of spiritually taming the young legionaries was realized with the help of elements such as songs, poetry, marches, and military and religious education. http://www.editions-harmattan.fr/index.asp?navig=catalogue&obj=livre&no=32368"
