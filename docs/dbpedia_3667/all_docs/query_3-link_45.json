        "text": "The artist who once screamed at his wife in German, yelling\n\n“Was ist Kunst?!” over and over until he was hoarse, smearing her face with paint, quietly\n\ncalls to her now in English: “Darling…,” followed by a question in Serbian, trying to recall a past event or name. Rasa Todosijevic is an artist whose work spans\n\nmany genres, but my interest in his work focuses on the 1970s, when he was part\n\nof an informal group of artists active at the Student Culture Center in\n\nBelgrade (SKC). Together with artists such as Era Milivojevic, Nesa Paripovic,\n\nGera Urkom, Zoran Popovic, and Marina Abramovic, these six artists formed the\n\nnucleus of the avant-garde activity that was happening in Belgrade at the time.\n\nThe Student Culture Center was a bi-product of the student\n\nrevolutions of 1968. Understanding that students needed a place in which to\n\nexpress themselves, yet also wanting to keep that expression from “exploding”\n\ninto the streets, Tito created these centers across Yugoslavia as a way to\n\ncontain the rebellious activity of the nation’s youth. In these places, students were left to themselves, to experiment and create freely,\n\noutside of the more official art institutions, such as the art academies, which\n\ntook a more traditional approach to art-making.\n\nThe heyday of SKC Belgrade was short-lived. For just a few\n\nshort years, between around 1971 and 1978, artists gathered there – spent their\n\nentire days there – discussing and creating art, putting on exhibitions and\n\nperformances. Because they existed completely on the margins, the powers that\n\nbe didn’t take them seriously, Rasa told me. This gave them free reign to experiment, outside of the strict confines of the Art Academy. What they were doing was, for the most\n\npart, ephemeral, which is also why it escaped notice. Since performance, installations and conceptual works of art did not\n\nfit into the category of “high art,” as painting or sculpture did, artists were able to create their experimental works that were, in a way, “uncategorized.” Avant-garde\n\nfilmmakers however, for example those associated with the Black\n\nWave, did have problems with the authorities in relation to their unconventional work precisely because of the fact\n\nthat they were working in film – a genre that had the capability of wide\n\ndistribution. The fact that the work of the artists at SKC was not only\n\ncontained, but difficult to disseminate, made it tolerable. A consequence of\n\nthis, however, is the sheer lack of documentation from that time. Very little\n\nartwork or records of the work exists, because there simply wasn’t a\n\nconsciousness about the significance of documentation. Nevertheless, Rasa told\n\nme that they – the young artists active in that group – were certain that they\n\nwere going to create a new type of art.\n\nSKC connected artists with the contemporary art scene\n\noutside of Yugoslavia’s borders as well. In conjunction with the April Meetings for\n\nExpanded Media that were held there, many artists and critics were invited to the center to exchange\n\nideas with the artists there. Joseph Beuys, Gina Pane and Germano Celant, among\n\nothers, were present.\n\nMuch of Rasa’s performative work from the SKC days remains\n\nconcerned with the nature and limits of art. For example, in Decision as Art (1973) he invokes the\n\nspirit of Duchamp by giving primacy to the thought-process behind the work of\n\nart. Two years earlier, he turned his wife, Marinela, into a readymade art\n\nobject, by exhibiting her in the exhibition Drangularium\n\nat SKC, next to a small table with a bottle placed on it. From 1976-1981 he\n\nrepeatedly posed the question “what is art?,” in German, to a female subject\n\n(in one of the performances, this female subject was his wife, Marinela\n\nKozelj). The language used, he has often remarked, could not be anything other\n\nthan German, as it is a “command” language. Aside from the fact that the artist\n\nis asking the unanswerable, he is also rehearses the subjugation of the female\n\nsubject in a patriarchal society, which parallels the situation of all subjects\n\nin a totalitarian regime, who must submit to the control of the state.\n\nIn Water Drinking\n\n(1974), the artist attempts to create temporal limits for the performative act\n\nby involving another living being (a fish) and pushing his own body to its\n\nphysical limits. He drinks 26 glasses of water in 35 minutes, attempting to\n\nsynchronize his drinking with that of the fish, which has been taken out of the\n\nwater and placed on dry land. Because of the quick tempo with which the artist\n\nmust drink, he vomits, but does so on a table covered with a tablecloth, under\n\nwhich is a violet pigment. The piece would last until the entire tablecloth is\n\ncolored purple. Thus the entire performance is defined by the rhythms and\n\nexhaustion of the body.\n\nHis 1975 performance, Art\n\nand Memory, involved the artist sitting and reciting all of the names of\n\nartists that he could recall, from memory. This performance brings to the fore\n\nthe workings of the artist’s mind, once again establishing the limits of art,\n\nand the history of art, therein. This work recalls a similar approach by conceptual artist Robert Barry, who constructed works of art that only existed as ideas in his mind, unknown to the audience. Rasa chooses to share these ideas with the audience through communication. For Rasa, it is the conceptualization of the piece followed by\n\nthe act of doing constitutes the art work. This was carried through in his\n\n1976-77 project, Not a Day without a Line,\n\nwhich involved the artist drawing a line on the wall (the most basic element of\n\nartistic creation) in both public and private spaces.\n\ntheme-font:minor-latin;\n\nmso-fareast-font-family:”ＭＳ 明朝”;\n\nmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;\n\nmso-hansi-font-family:Cambria;\n\nmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;\n\nmso-bidi-font-family:”Times New Roman”;\n\nmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}\n\n@page WordSection1\n\n{size:8.5in 11.0in;\n\nmargin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in;\n\nmso-header-margin:.5in;\n\nmso-footer-margin:.5in;\n\nmso-paper-source:0;}\n\ndiv.WordSection1\n\n{page:WordSection1;}\n\n–>"
