Who are these people that make up this so-called independent sector, the independents, or rather, what are they? What kind of conditions made them, what kept them alive until now and when will they be sacrificed? What will they be sacrificed for?\n\nODD THEORY #25\n\nAfter the introduction of the Martial Law in Poland in 1981, the communist party completely lost its moral legitimacy. Nobody believed in communist ideology anymore. On the other hand, because of the economic crisis of the late 70’s and early 80’s and events that resulted from it – like the functional collapse of the Council … Continued\n\nODD THEORY #24\n\nFor those who aren’t hung up on finding their ‘voice’ but don’t necessarily wish to promote their work was ‘uncreative writing’, these supportive but rigorous workshops offer the perfect opportunity to develop a novel or short story at great speed.

That was supposed to be our way of living through the end of history. Nowadays it … Continued\n\nODD THEORY #22\n\nWith this talk, I will engage not only with the concept of Ultrasanity, but also with some of the fundamental threads and preoccupations of my curatorial research. The possibility of challenging the alleged universality of the scientific discourse, of problematising and undoing its racist, patriarchal, Western-centred and individualistic agenda and infrastructure, and of unravelling disruptive … Continued\n\nODD NIGHT #29\n\n“When you sleep I make sure you stay breathing, make sure I’m there when you open your eyes, as you’re slightly stricken upon remembering the prison your body has become.”[1] Maggie Nelson, The Hospital for Special Care Gestures of affection are doomed to be stuck, impossible to deroot from sex.

Curator Mariëtte Groot focuses on avant-garde old and new, in sound, film and other media. Critical as she is towards vague, … Continued\n\nODD THEORY #20\n\nArguably, many characteristics of today’s Internet culture were anticipated in 1970s and 1980s counter-cultures and non-institutional/samizdat art practices including Mail Art, zines and cassette tape music. Upon close inspection, many so-called issues of today’s Internet can also be found in them: junk mail, viruses, crashes, fascist trolling and complex system administration. In the first part … Continued\n\nThe Social in the Media: on Digital Interdependencies\n\nOne of the big contradictions of the scene of self-organised cultural initiatives is that we are extremely reliant on corporate social media when it comes to our digital presence.

SAVVY Contemporary is a … Continued\n\nODD THEORY #17 (Session 2)\n\nIn this session we focus our listening on the multi-modality of voice. We venture to listen to voice beyond privileging tone, frequency or pitch, complexifying words, morphology, and language through vocality of sounds or non-verbal utterances. We will survey how forming meaning through the mouth, face, muscle and flesh, translates into possibilities of listening to … Continued\n\nODD THEORY #17 (Session 1)\n\nIn this session we attempt to bend time, listen to the reverb an echo chamber, urged by traversing early experimentations in electronic music production. We fast-forward, rewind, we are beside time, we pause, and listen together towards a multifaceted history of experimental music and sound arts. This kinship of music, sounds, recordings, which led our … Continued\n\nODD THEORY #17\n\nWith the UNTRAINING THE EAR LISTENING SESSIONS we propose exercises to decipher sound beyond its contextual affiliation of geography, genre, and valences of identity. It is an attempt to press II [pause] to the daily storm of sonic vibrations, and voice a call to examine and explore the auditory beyond the hearing and start to LISTEN.\n\nODD NIGHT #28\n\nBelow the epithelial waters, pressure is escalating until the lowest floors of the deep sea.

Empathy, is … Continued\n\nWorms & Horses\n\nWith the first edition of LIMINAL, Festival of Art, Science & Technology we explored how can we live the unlivable, the overwhelming everyday by thinking about more authentic forms of the oh-yeah GOOD LIFE.

How much is it in fact not in my power, but it precedes the moment I make my choice and overdetermines it? This … Continued\n\nODD THEORY #16 (Session 1)\n\nThe diversification of the labor processes in the post-industrial era has broadened the labor division. The work field is geographically deterritorialized and operationally fragmented. The factory – the time/space unity that enabled the labor force to organize politically – is destructured. The intellectual labor, and more precisely the cultural labor has gone through similar transformations. … Continued\n\nODD THEORY #16\n\nThis series of three meetings proposed by Ovid Pop is centered around the notion of embodied knowledge. Embodied knowledge is structured knowledge that runs through and employs our bodies. In this sense, the knowledge one operates with is specific, localized.

Entrance … Continued\n\nThe Fairy at the Gym\n\nMorfolina is a project that mediates the dialogue between ethical expressivity and electro-experimental transmissions, within the performative act titled The Fairy at the Gym. By channeling philosophy, recycling, in an invisible way, any form of pragmatic spirituality or insidiously juxtaposing poetry on dubious trap interludes, the show aims to trigger an intense and interrogative flow of exaltation. … Continued\n\nODD NIGHT #26\n\nState of facts: How can the understanding of a very important thing produce the effect of a surprise? Like when you see someone getting closer to you and you start recognizing their features. Someone unexpected, who just couldn’t be there, at that precise moment: the gaze remains fixed. And deep down the constant feeling of … Continued\n\nIntrospective #9\n\nIntrospective invites for the first time a guest from abroad to Bucharest. We’ve been wanting to invite Puce Mary here for a long time and we are finally having the Scandinavian artist perform to the local audience.
