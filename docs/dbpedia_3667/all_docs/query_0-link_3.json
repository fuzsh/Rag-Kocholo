Most of the technical aspects of this movie seemed sub-par, from the cinematography to the script and even the acting. Even bringing in accomplished overseas actors such as Michael Ironside didn't help. I will admit while the beginning was a little wonky, I did get more invested in the movie as it progressed as the tension did rise but as an overal package I just didn't really enjoy this one.\n\n1/1 Moldovan Movies Ranked\n\n136/167 Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award submissions Ranked"
