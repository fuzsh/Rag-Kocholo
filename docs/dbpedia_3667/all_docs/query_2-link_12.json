        "text": "Methods\n\nThere are various radiological techniques that the dentist can use to accurately identify the position of an impacted maxillary canine. The location of the unerupted canines and the determination of their relationship with adjacent teeth and the neighboring anatomical structures can initially be obtained from conventional two-dimensional (2D) radiographs (periapical and occlusal radiographs, OPT and cephalograms). Accurate, 3D localization of impacted maxillary canines is now possible with CBCT.\n\nPeriapical radiography\n\nIt is the simplest and most informative of all X-rays [15, 16]. This is generally done perpendicular to an imaginary plane that intersects the angle between the long axis of an erupted tooth and the plane of the film, to produce minimal distortion. The periapical X-ray is designed to visualize the tooth itself from the most advantageous angle, without reporting its position on buccolingual plane [17]. This periapical X-ray will reveal if there is an included tooth, also if its stage of development is similar to that of the counterpart. The presence and size of a dental follicle will be highlighted, and it will be confirmed if there is coronal or root resorption, as well as the root pattern and integrity of the included tooth. Also, any obstruction present in the eruption path, supernumerary teeth, cysts, or different types of odontomas can be identified [18].\n\nParallax method\n\nThe parallax method results from the apparent change in size or position of an object because of changing the angle of the X-ray beam [19].\n\nHorizontal parallax method\n\nThe most used periapical radiographic method is “the buccal object rule” introduced by Clark, in 1909. On a tooth located adjacent to the affected maxillary canine area, two periapical radiographs are performed with the change of the horizontal angle of the X-ray beam. The palatally impacted maxillary canine moves in the direction of the tube, and the buccally impacted in the opposite direction [20].\n\nClark’s Rule\n\nf three objects are aligned on the center beam axis, their images will be superimposed on the X-ray. If the X-ray source is moved laterally but remains pointed at the three objects, individual images of each will appear on the X-ray. The object closest to the film will appear displaced in the same direction as the X-ray source [21]. According to the principles of binocular vision, two periapical radiographs of the same tooth, with slightly different angulation, can provide information about its position in the jawbone (Figure , , ) [22].\n\nThis technique helps distinguish between lingual and buccal displacement of the canine. The procedure is performed as follows: a periapical X-ray of a certain size is placed intraorally, with the patient holding the finger against the palatal area where the maxillary canine should be located. The X-ray tube is directed at right angles to a tangent to the line of the maxillary arch, as for any periapical radiograph, and at an appropriate angle to the horizontal plane (Figure ) [23]. A second X-ray is placed in the oral cavity, in the same position, but this time the X-ray tube is moved (rotated) mesially or distally around the arch but kept at the same angle to the horizontal plane and oriented towards the adjacent mesial or distal tooth. To achieve this, the tube should describe between 30° and 45° of an arc of a circle whose center is somewhere in the middle of the palate (Figure ) [23].\n\nIf an impacted canine is placed palatally (Figure , ), then it will be almost in the middle of the image of the two radiographs [23]. However, in the first image (Figure ), if the tube was oriented over the area indicated by the canine, the root of the lateral incisor will be on the right. If the canine is positioned forward of the lateral, there will be some overlap of the crown of the canine and the root of the lateral incisor. In the second image (Figure ), taken from the front, the root of the right lateral incisor and the crown of the palatally impacted canine will be in the middle of the radiographic image, superimposed on each other to a much greater degree. This method is very useful in cases where there is a minimal discrepancy between the height of the erupted tooth and the adjacent unerupted one.\n\nVertical parallax method\n\nThe principal of this method is same as that of horizontal parallax, but the change of angle is made in the vertical direction [24]. Vertical displacement of the tube was described by Keur, in 1986, using one occlusal radiograph and one panoramic. The occlusal radiograph is obtained by placing the tube at an angle of 60–65° to the occlusal plane. The panoramic tube being located anterior to the patient’s head at an angle of 7°, the direction in which the palatally impacted canine will move is the same as that of the tube in the occlusal radiograph (Figure ) [25, 26, 27].\n\nOcclusal radiography\n\nOcclusal radiography is an intraoral radiographic investigation in which the image receptor is located in the occlusal plane, and which uses a dental radiograph of a larger size (5.7×7.6 cm) that includes the entire maxillary arch. The arm containing the X-ray tube will be positioned close to the forehead and nose, the role of which is to transmit the X-rays at a correct angle to the sensor located in the patient’s oral cavity. This is how it is obtained an occlusal image of the teeth in the maxillary anterior region, which is probably best described as a periapical image taken from a much more oblique angle and at a much higher height than usual. The image will “shorten” the actual root length, but it will be a considerable distance from the cross-section so easily achieved at the level of the maxillary arch. Because the central ray traverses less bone thickness, detail is usually good, although not as sharp as in a periapical radiograph. If the cusp of impacted canine is located in front of the arbitrary line joining the apexes of the lateral incisors, the position will be buccally (Figure ) [5, 19].\n\nPanoramic radiography\n\nThe panoramic radiograph, although it does not have the same level of detail as a periapical film, has the advantage of being simple and fast, offering a good scan of the teeth and jaws, from one joint to another (Figure ).\n\nChaushu et al. conducted studies to determine the position of impacted maxillary canines using a single panoramic radiograph [28]. The magnification technique (Figure ) applied to an OPT is based on the idea that when the teeth move away from the film, they will be larger compared to the teeth on the other hemiarcade. Panoramic radiography is widely used in dental medicine and is the preferred primary radiographic imaging technique for orthodontic patients (Figure , ) [29]. The procedure was developed in 1946 by Prof. Paatero and is based on the principles of tomography. If a canine is relatively magnified in comparison to the neighboring teeth or the contralateral canine, it is found closer to the tube (palatal) and if it is relatively diminished it is found further away from the tube (buccal) [30].\n\nNapgal et al. analyzed OPT of 50 patients with a total of 68 impacted canines, correct prediction of the palatal position of impacted canines by magnification on a panoramic radiograph was possible in 77% of cases [31]. Fox et al., after examining 139 ectopic canines on panoramic radiographs, were able to accurately predict the position of a palatally displaced crown in approximately 80% of cases [30]. An et al. reviewed and evaluated panoramic radiographs of 94 patients, respectively 102 impacted maxillary canines, using magnification, angulation, and superimposition methods. The study concluded that magnification and angulation methods using a single OPT did not provide accurate results for locating the impacted canine. The method correctly located 68% of buccal canines and 69.57% of palatal canines [32]. These studies concluded that panoramic radiography cannot be used alone to reliably locate impacted maxillary canines.\n\nCephalograms\n\nLateral and frontal cephalograms can provide additional information on upper canine displacement and possibly for the prediction of canine impact. Lateral cephalograms of patients between eight and nine years of age show the height of the impacted canine and the anteroposterior position of its cusp relative to the apexes of the incisors. The evaluation of the impacted canine is done by analyzing the angle between its axis and the perpendicular to the Frankfurt plane (Figure ). This technique can indicate whether the canine is in palatal or labial position [5].\n\nThere are methods that use the combination of a lateral cephalogram and a posteroanterior cephalogram or a panoramic radiography and a lateral cephalogram. Lateral and frontal cephalograms can be useful in determining the position of the impacted canine relatively to the maxillary sinus and the floor of the nasal cavity [33].\n\nComputed tomography\n\nConventional CT was introduced in 1990 as an alternative for determining the position of impacted canines and areas of root resorption of neighboring teeth, due to the contrast between tissues and the precise 3D images provided by this technique [34, 35]. CT, also known as computed axial tomography (CAT), is a radiographic method in which a 3D image of the inside of a jaw is obtained using a 2D X-ray beam around a single axis of rotation (Figure ) [36]. At the same time, this technique allows the elimination of the overlap of different structures that would mask the image of the impacted canine, in an attempt to visualize it in traditional radiography.\n\nBy visualizing the radiographic series in “slices” of the jaw, the relationship between the included canine and the adjacent teeth, in all three planes of space, can be correctly evaluated, as well as the coronal, apex positions and the inclination of the long axis of the tooth (Figure ). The method can also provide correct information regarding early root resorption, especially of the buccal and palatal surfaces [36].\n\nConventional CT would be the most suitable method of investigation to find out the exact position of the impacted canine. The restriction of its use is given by the high cost and high radiation dose [37, 38].\n\nCone-beam computed tomography\n\nA new method, used more and more in the diagnosis and therapy of dental impaction is a variant of CT, called CBCT, cone-beam volumetric tomography (CBVT). 3D reconstructions are useful for a better visualization of the position of the impacted canines, their relationship with the adjacent structures, as well as the possible complications caused by them [39, 40]. CBCT uses a conical beam (the radiation wave propagates conically), and a single scan of a short duration is sufficient to cover the entire investigation area. The images are quickly reconstructed, using special software, providing an image with a very high resolution, in a single plane, the one of interest to the doctor. It presents the advantage that the anatomical planes do not overlap, providing great accuracy in assessing the position and proximity ratios of the included canine. It also allows 3D reconstruction on the image in space, the doctor precisely locating the impacted tooth (Figure , )."
