        "text": "In pictures: What you may have missed on Day 5 of the Paris Olympics\n\nKatie Ledecky has done it again.\n\nThe American swimming legend crushed the rest of the field Wednesday in her signature event — the 1,500-meter freestyle — and broke her own Olympic record in the process. She finished in 15:30.02, a full 10 seconds faster than her closest competitor.\n\nWednesday also saw the completion of the men’s and women’s triathlons in the River Seine, after poor water quality levels had forced the cancellation of training sessions and the postponement of the men’s race.\n\nSpain’s Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz, nicknamed “Nadalcaraz,” fell in straight sets to Americans Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram in their men’s doubles quarterfinal. The loss means Nadal will not continue in Paris, as his future in tennis is uncertain as injuries continue to plague him.\n\nHere are some of the day’s most compelling pictures:\n\nSee more of the best photos of the Paris Olympics.\n\n\"La Marseillaise\" rings out for Marchand\n\nHearing “La Marseillaise” at a French sporting event is really just an incredible thing to behold.\n\nOne of the greatest — if not the greatest — national anthems in the world just rang out as Léon Marchand received his gold medal for the 200m butterfly. The French crowd was in full voice as spirits are soaring after their hero took gold and French swimmer Anastasiia Kirpichnikova took silver in the women’s 1,500m freestyle, which occurred just before the medal ceremony.\n\nThere’s one more chance to hear the famous call to arms from the French Revolution. Marchand races again later tonight in the 200m breaststroke, looking for his third gold of the Games.\n\nWhat a night in Paris!\n\nKatie Ledecky breaks her Olympic record in the 1,500m freestyle to get her first gold of the Games\n\nAmerican Katie Ledecky is going to be back in a place she’s gotten very used to: the top of the Olympics podium and she’s got a new record to come home with.\n\nLedecky again crushed the field in her signature race, finishing with a new Olympic record in a contest she has simply crushed over the years. Her emotion was evident as she raised her hands in victory, screaming as she finished the race.\n\nThe American superstar now owns the top 20 times ever swum in the distance: a truly remarkable feat.\n\nThe French crowd was going nuts in the final laps of the race as France’s Anastasiia Kirpichnikova took the silver. German Isabel Gose took third.\n\nGold: Katie Ledecky of USA — 15:30.02\n\nSilver: Anastasiia Kirpichnikova of France — 15:40.35\n\nBronze: Isabel Gose of Germany — 15:41.16\n\nThis post has been updated with quotes from USA’s Katie Ledecky.\n\nTeam USA leaps out to double-digit lead against South Sudan\n\nWhat a start for LeBron James and Co.\n\nTeam USA is ahead 26-14 after the first quarter against South Sudan, controlling the game on both the offensive and defensive sides of the floor.\n\nIt was a productive opening period for James, scoring eight of the Americans’ first 10 points. Derrick White and Anthony Davis have been defensive disruptors, each coming up with huge blocks while South Sudan have struggled taking care of the ball.\n\nStill no sign of Joel Embiid, however — the former MVP was benched after starting the team’s opener against Serbia.\n\nKatie Ledecky enters the pool for her signature race\n\nOver the years, Katie Ledecky has wowed fans when she swims the 1,500-meter freestyle.\n\nIt’s created indelible images like the gap between the American and her competition in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 as she took the swimming world by storm. And as the world and Olympic record holder in this event, she’s expected to take home the gold once again.\n\nLedecky has a bit to prove after a disappointing first night of the Games. She lost the highly-anticipated 400 meter freestyle battle with Australian Ariarne Titmus, eventually settling for bronze.\n\nUS women’s soccer team qualifies for quarterfinals after 2-1 victory over Australia\n\nThe US women’s soccer team qualified for the quarterfinals of the 2024 Paris Olympic Games as group winners after its 2-1 victory over Australia on Wednesday.\n\nTrinity Rodman opened the scoring on the stroke of halftime, prodding home as she latched onto a header from her teammate, Sophia Smith.\n\nKorbin Albert’s emphatic goal from long range doubled the US’ lead midway through the second half and although Alanna Kennedy’s late goal did give Australia some hope, it was too little too late as the US was able to hold onto the victory.\n\nWhat this means: The US was victorious in all three of its group games, allowing it to book its spot in the next round as Group B winners with nine points from nine available.\n\nThe USWNT will face Japan in the next round.\n\nRafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz eliminated in men's doubles quarterfinal\n\nSpain’s Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz, nicknamed “Nadalcaraz,” fell in straight sets to Americans Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram in their men’s doubles quarterfinal.\n\nThe Spaniards survived multiple match points, but eventually fell 6-2 6-4. Nadal has won at Roland-Garros singles a record 14 times but has not had the same luck there in doubles.\n\nNadal, 38, will not continue in Paris after he lost to Novak Djokovic on Monday, however Alcaraz, 21, advanced to the singles quarterfinal earlier today.\n\nTheir American opponents have each been ranked No. 1 in doubles, and Krajicek won Roland-Garros doubles in 2023.\n\nNadal’s future in tennis is uncertain as injuries continue to plague him. After Wednesday’s defeat, the Spaniard was coy about what is to come, saying “I don’t know if this was the last time” when asked if he was ever going to play at Roland Garros again. Nadal has won 14 French Open titles at the Paris-based grand slam.\n\nAlcaraz paid tribute to the 22-time grand slam champion on X, formerly known as Twitter, alongside a picture of the pair of them smiling and embracing.\n\nThis post has been updated with quotes from Spain’s Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nHighly anticipated rematch between South Sudan and Team USA underway\n\nThe star-studded US men’s basketball team is taking on South Sudan in a rematch of a warmup game in London that saw the world’s youngest country push Team USA to the final buzzer.\n\nHead coach Steve Kerr has made two changes to starting lineup from the first game against Serbia. Anthony Davis has come in for former NBA MVP Joel Embiid, who struggled in game one, while Jayson Tatum replaces Jrue Holiday, having not a played a single minute against Serbia.\n\nSouth Sudan defeated Puerto Rico 90-79 in its first ever Olympic matchup.\n\nAustralia gets a goal back against the US to make it 2-1 with just a few minutes remaining\n\nHold on now. Could there be some late drama in Marseille?\n\nAlanna Kennedy’s strike from close range has halved the deficit meaning Australia needs just one goal to level the scores with just minutes remaining.\n\nWe could be in for an exciting finish.\n\nIs this the coolest Olympic venue?\n\nA lot has been made of the iconic venues at this Olympics, many of which are dotted around key Parisian landmarks: beach volleyball in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, skateboarding at the Place de la Concorde, archery at Les Invalides, or the icon-filled route of the triathlon.\n\nBut is fencing’s venue the best? It could well be the noisiest.\n\nThe Grand Palais, an exhibition hall and event center located off the Champs-Élysées, is the cavernous home to all the fencing competitions at the Paris Olympics, with two huge temporary stands offering fans an excellent view of proceedings.\n\nAthletes enter the venue from a balcony and process down an elegant staircase onto the piste at the heart of the Grand Palais.\n\nTonight is the men’s team final, and host France has just defeated Iran in the bronze medal match. The noise at the end of that contest was deafening, even audible from outside the building.\n\nSouth Korea and Hungary are up next in the gold medal match, with four giant screens also showing the bouts.\n\nFrench fans blow the roof off for Marchand\n\nThe noise being made here by French fans for swimmer Léon Marchand is almost beyond description.\n\nThe roar in the final lap of his 200m butterfly victory was like a jet airliner taking off and the explosion of noise when he hit the final wall was like standing next to an amplifier during rock concert.\n\nThere’s always been a lot of red, white and blue at this arena throughout the week, but today is something else entirely.\n\nStunning long-range Korbin Albert goal makes it 2-0 for US against Australia\n\nA stunning long-range goal from Korbin Albert doubled the US women’s soccer team’s lead against Australia on Wednesday, making it 2-0 on the night.\n\nWith approximately 15 minutes remaining in the clash in Marseille, 20-year-old Albert took her aim from the edge of the box and fired into the top corner.\n\nAlbert had only just come on as a substitute as head coach Emma Hayes changed her team with a spot in the quarterfinals already guaranteed.\n\nJust moments later, Sophia Smith almost made it three, but her effort came off the post.\n\nFrance's Marchand takes gold in the 200m butterfly and sets Olympic record\n\nFrench hero Léon Marchand just made an incredible comeback in the final 50 meters of this race to take the gold out of Hungarian Kristóf Milák’s hands.\n\nThe home nation favorite entered the pool area to his name being chanted by his compatriots, but he trailed for much of the race. With the final turn, an incredible explosion off the wall brought Marchand into first to stay.\n\nThe crowd here just made an almost unbelievable noise, ears are ringing all around the place.\n\nGold: Léon Marchand of France — 1:51.21\n\nSilver: Kristóf Milák of Hungary — 1:51.75\n\nBronze: Illya Kharun of Canada — 1:52.80\n\nSarah Sjöström powers past American Torri Huske in dramatic race to take 100m freestyle\n\nWhat an incredible first race to start the night here.\n\nAmerican Torri Huske looked set to take the gold medal, leading most of the way through this 100m freestyle race. But in the final 25 meters, Sweden’s Sarah Sjöström powered up and beat her to the wall for the gold\n\nThe results:\n\nGold: Sarah Sjöström of Sweden — 52.16\n\nSilver: Torri Huske of USA — 52.29\n\nBronze: Siobhan Bernadette Haughey of Hong Kong — 52.33\n\nThis post has been updated with quotes from Sweden’s Sarah Sjöström.\n\nThe crowd at La Défense Arena is freed from desire\n\nIt’s a party here in Paris.\n\n“Freed from Desire” by Gala Rizzatto is an unofficial anthem at these Games — and in Europe writ large — and is being played before each event for the most part.\n\nAnd before tonight’s meet, they turned the lights out and had a bit of a dance party. A truly wonderful scene, but the crowds will surely want more and more of this…\n\nHere's what we're watching tonight in the pool\n\nIt’s a massive night in the pool here at the La Défense Arena. Here’s what we’re watching tonight:\n\nKatie Ledecky looks for her first gold: American swimming legend Katie Ledecky is competing in her signature 1,500m freestyle race. She’s the world and Olympic record holder in the event and has taken home gold in this event in the last two Olympics. She also has swum 19 of the 20 fastest times ever in the distance. After a disappointing bronze on Saturday in the 400m freestyle, Ledecky will be hoping to get her first gold of the Games.\n\nLéon Marchand aims to set French hearts alight: The standout athlete for the home nation so far in this first week of the Games, Marchand is becoming a superstar here in Paris. The stands at La Défense are packed with the tricolore French flag and this arena, which has been loud all week, is expected to hit another level tonight. Marchand competes twice, in the 200m butterfly and the 200m breaststroke.\n\nThe sprint is on: The other two events are two of the quickest races in swimming. The 100m freestyle for the men and women will open and close the meet tonight. Each race is less than a minute long and should be thrilling.\n\nShinnosuke Oka wins men's all-round gymnastics\n\nAfter a palm-wrenching competition punctuated with slips, trips and injuries, Japan’s Shinnosuke Oka has secured a win in the men’s all-round gymnastics, with a final score of 86.832.\n\nHis compatriot Daiki Hashimoto saw the end of his Olympic dominance, with an impressive performance on the high bar unable to make up for his mishap on the pommel horse.\n\nChina’s Zhang Boheng gets silver with 86.599, and Xiao Ruoteng scoops bronze with 86.364.\n\nRafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz drop first set to Team USA’s Rajeev Ram and Austin Krajicek\n\nIt has not been the start that ‘Nadalcaraz’ would have wanted.\n\nThe crowd-favorite duo of Spain’s Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz have lost the first set in their men’s doubles quarterfinal matchup against the US’ Rajeev Ram and Austin Krajicek.\n\nThe Spanish pair had their serve broken twice by the doubles specialists and will need to show some of the form that they demonstrated in their opening two matches if they are to mount a comeback.\n\nTrinity Rodman taps home from close range as US leads Australia 1-0 at half-time\n\nTrinity Rodman prodded home on the stroke of half-time to give the US women’s soccer team the lead against Australia at the break in Marseille.\n\nA whipped corner was headed down by Sophia Smith and Rodman was able to get a foot to it to give the US the lead with two minutes remaining in the first half.\n\nThere was confusion about whether the goal would stand, but after deliberations with the video assistant referee, referee François Letexier finally awarded it.\n\nPrior to the goal, it had been a half of few chances but one which was dominated by the US in terms of possession.\n\nEmma Hayes’ team looked confident on the ball, totaling 72% possession, but struggled to create many clear openings at the Australian goal.\n\nThe first big chance came late in the half when US captain Lindsey Horan headed on target from close range, with Matildas goalkeeper Mackenzie Arnold able to get a fingertip to it and tip it onto the bar.\n\nArnold was kept busy as the half came to a close, having to palm away Rodman’s long-range effort. However, from the resulting corner, the forward gave the US the lead.\n\nThe USWNT was dealt a blow in the fourth minute when midfield metronome Sam Coffey picked up an early yellow card which will rule her out of her team’s game in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe US has already booked its spot in the next round but a win or a draw would secure top spot in Group B.\n\nArchery postponed to tomorrow due to thunderstorm risk\n\nInclement weather continues to be a theme of the Paris Games.\n\nThe last six archery matches of the day have been postponed due to forecast weather conditions and the risk of thunderstorms around the Invalides.\n\nThe matches will now take place tomorrow.\n\nParis has a new landmark. The Olympic cauldron is attracting thousands of visitors\n\nSeveral iconic landmarks of Paris have been put to use for these Olympics Games, transforming to sporting venues and attracting thousands of spectators. Now, a brand new spot is getting equal attention.\n\nThe hot air balloon-like Olympic cauldron, which first took off at the end of the opening ceremony from the Louvre’s Tuileries Gardens, has been met with overwhelming success as it dazzled viewers on TV and now attracts real-life visitors.\n\nParis 2024 organizers have opened up the 30 meter-high (100 ft) cauldron for up to 10,000 free visits daily. With slots fully booked through August 11, organizers vowed to add more visiting times, saying they have been “victims of their success.”\n\nSome Parisians — including Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo — hope it can remain part of the local landscape permanently.\n\n“It’s an extraordinary, magnificent object, and the location in which it’s situated is magnificent,” the mayor said in a radio interview Monday.\n\nCreated by French designer Mathieu Lehanneur, the Olympic cauldron features never-before-seen technology as it relies only on electricity and is 100% fuel free.\n\nLehanneur also hopes his creation will fly above Paris, once the Games conclude.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz defeats Roman Safiullin in straight sets to reach singles quarterfinals\n\nSpain’s Carlos Alcaraz defeated Roman Safiullin — a Russian who was competing as an Individual Neutral Athlete (AIN) — in straight sets to advance to the Olympic singles quarterfinals.\n\nThe French Open and Wimbledon champion won 6-4 6-2 and will now face off against American Tommy Paul.\n\nAlcaraz will hit the court again at 1 p.m. ET (7 p.m. local time) with doubles partner Rafael Nadal as the Spaniards take on Americans Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram in the men’s doubles quarterfinal.\n\nIn an ominous sign for his singles opponents, Alcaraz sounded supremely confident after his victory and said he was “really happy” with how he played against Safiullin.\n\n“I played at a high level during the whole match, from the beginning until the last point,” he said.\n\n“I am really happy to find the solutions at the end to play at a really high level to win in two sets.”\n\nThis post was updated with quotes from Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nGuatemala wins first-ever gold with Olympic record score from Adriana Ruano in women's trap shooting\n\nGuatemala won its first-ever gold medal at the Games — Summer or Winter — after an Olympic record performance from Adriana Ruano in the women’s trap shooting on Wednesday.\n\nFacing stiff opposition, Ruano never looked unsettled throughout the whole competition, only missing five of her 50 efforts at Chateauroux.\n\nShe held a four-point lead over Italy’s Silvana Maria Stanco heading into the final 10 shots and successfully wrapped up the victory in style as she continued her accurate pace.\n\nRuano’s score of 45 was a new Olympic record in the discipline, surpassing the previous record of 43 set by Zuzana Rehák-Štefečeková of Slovakia in Tokyo three years ago. The world record stands at 48 set by American Ashley Carroll in 2018.\n\nThe emotions seemed to overcome the 29-year-old as the results were being announced afterwards, as she had to fight off tears while draped in Guatemala’s flag.\n\nStanco won silver with 40 and Australia’s Penny Smith wins bronze with 32 from her 40 shots.\n\nUS women's soccer team to take on Australia in final game of group B\n\nThis evening in Marseille, the US Women’s National Team will be looking to make it three wins out of three when it takes on Australia in its group stage finale in the Olympic soccer competition.\n\nA lot has changed since the US women secured their last gold medal at London 2012. After an early exit at last year’s Women’s World Cup, the US team will be looking to assert its dominance — and after a stunning 4-1 victory over fourth-ranked Germany on Sunday, this could be on the cards. However, Australia’s Matildas likely won’t go down without a fight, after coming from behind to sensationally beat Zambia 6-5 with a 90th minute goal in their last match.\n\nLeading Group B with six points, the US needs a win or a draw to secure first in the group. The US also have a plus-six goal differential, providing a comfortable cushion against any shocks from the Aussies or Germany, which takes on Zambia at the Saint-Étienne Stadium.\n\nWhen? 1 p.m. ET / 7 p.m. local time at Stade de Marseille.\n\nJosé Torres Gil takes historic BMX gold medal for Argentina\n\nArgentina’s José Torres Gil has just claimed Argentina’s first ever individual medal in the sport of cycling – and it’s gold.\n\nTorres Gil took victory in the men’s BMX park final at Paris’ Place de la Concorde with his score of 94.82, which was also the first gold medal for a South American nation at the Paris Olympics.\n\nGreat Britain’s Kieran Reilly was second with 93.91, while France’s Anthony Jeanjean – a big pre-competition favorite who had huge support from the home crowd – was third with 93.76.\n\nJeanjean dramatically crashed out of his first run after failing to land his opening trick, but he responded superbly on his second run. The crowd seemed to think he had done enough to take first place, but he was awarded a score just short of Torres Gil’s first run before Reilly topped him on the final run of the competition.\n\nLuol Deng: South Sudan's journey to the Olympics is “bigger than basketball”\n\nIt was a dream debut on the Olympic basketball stage for the world’s youngest country.\n\nSouth Sudan’s men’s basketball team defeated Puerto Rico 90-79 in Paris on Sunday in its first ever appearance at the Games, but the result meant more than just picking up two points in Group C. For South Sudan Basketball Federation President Luol Deng, it was the culmination of everything that he and the team had worked so hard to achieve.\n\nNext up for South Sudan is a rematch against a Team USA side that features the likes of LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Steph Curry later today.\n\nRead the whole story here.\n\nJamaican sprint star Shericka Jackson pulls out of 100m competition\n\nBig sprinting news from Paris.\n\nJamaican superstar Shericka Jackson has pulled out of this year’s 100m competition, according to the Olympics website.\n\nShe reportedly confirmed the news in a press conference, but it is currently unclear why she has decided not to run.\n\nJackson was a bronze medalist in the 100m at the Tokyo Games and won silver in the same event at last year’s World Championships, where she also won gold in the 200m.\n\nIt’s yet to be seen whether Jackson will compete in the 200m in Paris, or be part of the relay teams.\n\nOlympics are around 5 degrees Fahrenheit hotter because of climate change, analysis shows\n\nAs the world’s top athletes battle it out at the Paris Summer Olympics, they are turning to ice vests and rented air conditioners to stay on top of their game in temperatures that have hit a high of 97 degrees Fahrenheit (around 36 degrees Celsius).\n\nAn analysis published by climate scientists Wednesday shows that climate change has added between 4.5 and 5.94 degrees F (2.5 to 3.3 degrees C) to July temperatures in Paris and the wider Mediterranean region.\n\nThe current heat wave would have been “virtually impossible without fossil fuel-driven warming,” according to the World Weather Attribution initiative, which published the analysis.\n\n“If the atmosphere wasn’t overloaded with emissions from burning fossil fuel, Paris would have been about 3°C cooler and much safer for sport,” Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London, said in a statement.\n\n“However, many people across the Mediterranean do not have the luxury of ice-packs, air conditioning or cooling breaks at work. For these people, extreme heat can mean death.”\n\nTemperatures have exceeded 100F in swaths of the Mediterranean region this July.\n\nIn Morocco, at least 21 people died in the July heat as temperatures reached over 118F. Heat is poorly recorded as a contributor to death, so that toll is likely to be much higher.\n\nThe climate crisis, caused primarily from humans burning fossil fuels, is making heatwaves globally hotter, longer and more frequent.\n\nWhat’s happening in Paris? After a soggy start to the Olympics, temperatures soared this week and hit a high of 97 degrees (36 degrees Celsius) on Tuesday afternoon, marking the hottest day in the French capital since July 2022.\n\nTemperatures will remain above average in Paris for the remainder of the week and Wednesday is expected to see a high of near 90°F (32°C). It will get cooler through the week, falling closer to normal July temperatures of around 79°F (26°C) by the weekend.\n\nCourt of Arbitration dismisses Canada’s appeal of Olympics 6-point deduction after flying drone\n\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has dismissed Canada’s appeal of its six-point deduction to both its Olympic squads which had been handed down after one of the team’s staff members flew a drone to film the closed-door training of the New Zealand women’s soccer team last week.\n\nJoseph Lombardi, who the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) has said is an “unaccredited analyst with Canada Soccer,” was given an eight-month suspended prison sentence after flying the drone and sent home from the Olympics, along with assistant coach Jasmine Mander, who Lombardi sent his report to.\n\nFIFA said that it had suspended Lombardi and Mander, as well as women’s soccer team head coach Bev Priestman, for a year from “taking part in any football-related activity.”\n\nBoth Canada’s men’s and women’s teams were assessed a six-point deduction at the Paris Games, but a Canada Soccer spokesperson later told CNN that it would appeal the sanction.\n\nHowever, CAS’ dismissal of the appeal means the six-point deduction stands.\n\nIn a statement, Canada Soccer president Peter Augruso and CEO and general secretary Kevin Blue said it was “disappointed” with CAS’ verdict.\n\n“Throughout this matter, Canada Soccer has sought to demonstrate accountability and communicate transparently, including to FIFA during their discipline process. We are disappointed with today’s appeal decision and continue to believe that our players should not have been unnecessarily punished for actions that were not their own,” it said.\n\n“Last week, Canada Soccer committed to an independent external review. This process has begun. Sonia Regenbogen of Mathews, Dinsdale & Clark, LLP has been retained and will start the review by initially focusing on actions taken by Canada Soccer representatives related to the incident at the Olympic Games. Other issues of this matter, including its history will be reviewed subsequently. Ms. Regenbogen is a leading Canadian expert in conducting independent workplace investigations.\n\n“Canada Soccer will continue to communicate regularly about this issue and take swift, decisive steps to restore public trust.”\n\nThe Canadian women’s team has won both its games at the tournament so far, so the team sits on zero points in Group A.\n\n\"We won our bet,\" says Paris mayor as triathlon competition held in River Seine\n\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo on Wednesday said the city had succeeded in its goal to make River Seine swimmable.\n\n“We won our bet — the pollution has been cleaned up,” Hidalgo said, as both men’s and women’s triathlon events took place Wednesday after being postponed due to water quality concerns.\n\n“If the infrastructure wasn’t built, we couldn’t have had people swimming this morning because of the storms that took place these past few days,” Hidalgo told reporters, adding that the water quality numbers this morning were “very good,” allowing for the event to take place as planned following a postponement of the men’s race one day before.\n\nHidalgo added that for years the river had been considered “almost as [a] sewer,” saying that many thought this was mission “impossible.”\n\n“I’m happy — relieved means we had fears that we would not succeed. I’ve never thought we would not succeed,” Hidalgo said.\n\nFrance’s Cassandre Beaugrand won gold in the women’s race with Alex Yee producing a sensational finish to win gold for Team GB in the men’s event later on.\n\nNew Zealand's Black Ferns treated to hero's welcome after rugby sevens gold medal\n\nLoud ovations, cheering and thunderous applause was the soundtrack that accompanied the Black Ferns Rugby Sevens team as they entered New Zealand House on Wednesday with gold medals shining around their necks.\n\nLed from the front by legendary captain Portia Woodman-Wickliffe, who’ll be retiring after these Games, Māori flags were fluttering as the players were greeted with a pōwhiri — a Māori welcoming ceremony — involving whaikōrero (formal speech), waiata (singing) and kai (food).\n\nWoodman-Wickliffe was wearing all three medals she’s won in her sevens career: two golds (2020 and 2024) and a silver medal (2016).\n\nFlanked on both sides by friends, family, fans and members of staff, the team was applauded as it made its entrance.\n\nThe players had beaming smiles plastered across their faces after winning back-to-back golds following the win over Canada in the Stade de France on Tuesday.\n\nDeng Yawen earns historic BMX freestyle park gold for China after thrilling final\n\nThere are huge celebrations and tears of joy from Deng Yawen as she takes gold for China after a thrilling women’s BMX freestyle park final.\n\nDeng’s huge best score of 92.60 comfortably gave her first place ahead of the USA’s Perris Benegas in second on 90.70.\n\nA delighted Natalya Diehm of Australia picks up bronze with a score of 88.80.\n\nDeng’s gold is China’s first in this event and those tears have now been replaced by a beaming smile as she celebrates her historic achievement with her coaches.\n\nThere were several big crashes and these brave riders pushed the bikes to the limit.\n\nNovak Djokovic advances to tennis quarterfinals\n\nNovak Djokovic has once again taken care of business at Roland Garros, defeating Germany’s Dominik Köpfer 7-5 6-3 to advance to the men’s singles quarterfinals Wednesday.\n\nDjokovic was pushed in the first set for one of the first times in this tournament, but eventually turned the tide against Köpfer.\n\nDjokovic is pursuing his first gold medal and the career golden slam. It’s the one major honor he’s not won in the sport.\n\nAn emotional gold for Team GB in women's quad sculls\n\nThirteen years ago, Team GB’s Lola Anderson wrote on a piece of paper that she wanted to become an Olympic champion. On Wednesday, that dream became a reality.\n\nAnderson was part of Team GB’s gold medal-winning team which stormed to victory in the women’s rowing quad sculls.\n\nThe British boat appeared to be flagging behind the Netherlands for much of the final, but managed to put together a late surge to pip their rivals at the line — just 0.15 seconds ahead.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Sport after the win, Anderson was asked about the moment she wrote down her Olympic ambition all those years ago, and how her father reminded her of it just months before he passed away from cancer.\n\nTeammate Lauren Henry added of the comeback: “We got to 250 (meters) to go and I could sense we were coming back, so I was like, ‘Guys, now, we’re going now.’ And then I called it again about 150 metres to go, I was like, ‘We can do this.’\n\n“I kind of knew we’d crossed the line first but we had to wait to see, and when I saw ‘GBR, 1’ come up it was amazing. … We’ve worked so hard for this, and we have so much belief, but it’s all about doing it on the day. It is tricky to do that, so just so proud of us.”\n\nThis post was updated with more details about Lola Anderson’s father and her.\n\nThe Netherlands defend their Olympic title in the men's quadruple sculls\n\nThe Netherlands have successfully defended their Olympic title in the men’s quadruple sculls, cruising to victory by more than two seconds ahead of Italy in second and Poland in third.\n\nThe 2023 world champions were totally dominant on the water, with Dutch rower Tone Wieten describing his team’s performance as “amazing.”\n\n“We knew it was good, but we knew we had to stay sharp and step up the game a bit,” he said.\n\nDjokovic takes the first set in back-and-forth match as he aims for gold\n\nThe No. 1 seed in tennis, Novak Djokovic, is in a back-and-forth barn burner with Germany’s Dominik Köpfer on a steamy Court Philippe-Chatrier at Roland Garros.\n\nThe 24-time grand slam champion is chasing the only thing that seems to have eluded him in his illustrious career: an Olympic gold medal.\n\nDjokovic is wearing a sleeve on his right knee. It was here at Roland Garros that he suffered a knee injury in June that required surgery on his meniscus, though he returned and made the Wimbledon final before falling to Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets.\n\nThose in attendance are fanning themselves due to the heat, while taking turns shouting both “Nole!” and “Let’s go, Dominik!”\n\nDjokovic won the first set of this best-of-three match, 7-5, and is up in the second set.\n\nSuperhuman strength shown by Irish rugby sevens star\n\nIt helps to have good teammates, and this picture from the women’s rugby sevens action proves just that.\n\nWith Ireland 28-5 down to Team GB on Tuesday, Erin King saved Emily Lane from what would could have been a serious injury.\n\nWith just minutes left on the clock, Ireland’s King had lifted Lane into the air to catch a looping kick. The latter incredibly caught the ball but seemingly misjudged her jump and started to fall backwards.\n\nFortunately, King displayed superhuman strength to stop Lane from falling on her neck — and even managed to lift her back over her head to land upright.\n\nNZ House cheers on its Olympic silver medalist Hayden Wilde\n\nThe atmosphere was incredible at NZ House off the Champs-Élysées on Wednesday morning — the families of the Black Ferns Sevens, the all-conquering women’s rugby sevens double Olympic champions, were all here expecting the arrival of their team to carry on the celebration.\n\nThe gathered crowd watched and roared on triathlete Hayden Wilde in the closing stages of the men’s competition.\n\nFor so long, it looked as if he was going to claim yet another gold for the nation, leading from the front on the run, only for Team GB’s Alex Yee, the silver medal winner in Tokyo, to find something from nowhere and pull away on a sprint with 400m to go and take the gold.\n\nWhile there was an initial silence at the disappointing turn of events, the crowd soon gave a cheer as their man took an Olympic silver medal, a massive accomplishment.\n\nHuge admiration and respect as both he and Yee collapsed to the ground after crossing the line. Nothing more to give for these two athletes on what was a fantastic finish to the men’s race.\n\nAlex Yee produces stunning finish to snatch men's triathlon gold\n\nTeam GB’s Alex Yee produced a sensational finish to take the lead of the men’s triathlon on the final bend and snatch the gold medal away from New Zealand’s Hayden Wilde.\n\nWilde had opened up a 15-second lead during the run, the third leg of the race, but Yee hunted him down spectacularly over the last 1.5 kilometers.\n\nYee adds the gold to the triathlon silver and mixed relay gold he won three years ago in Tokyo.\n\n“I gave my best account of myself on the run,” Yee said of his performance.\n\n“Triathlon racing for me has always been about racing through three events, not just the one, so I was really proud to be an animator in the race, put on a show, and hopefully people were able to enjoy,” Yee added.\n\nIt continues Team GB’s rich history in the event after Alistair Brownlee took gold in 2012 and 2016, with brother Jonathan adding bronze and silver, respectively.\n\nLeo Bergere punched the air as he crossed the line, picking up a bronze medal for host nation France.\n\nPierre Le Corre, as French compatriot Emma Lombardi experienced in the women’s event earlier, was the unfortunate athlete to finish fourth.\n\nThis post was updated with quotes from Team GB’s Alex Yee.\n\n\"I'll bet my bottom dollar that never will be done again\": Gymnast reacts to Simone Biles' performances\n\nA little more than three years after a shocking case of the “twisties” caused her to withdraw from Team USA’s attempt at defending its gymnastics team gold, Simone Biles is now the most decorated American gymnast in Olympic history.\n\nOn Tuesday, she lead the US to victory in the women’s gymnastics team event, clinching her fifth Olympic gold medal, alongside Suni Lee, Jade Carey, Jordan Chiles and Hezly Rivera.\n\n“This has just been an unbelievable week for her and for gymnastics,” British gymnast Nile Wilson, a bronze medalist at Rio 2016, told CNN Sport’s Amanda Davies.\n\n“She’s now the most decorated USA gymnast Olympian that there is. But for the sport, gymnastics, I’ve never witnessed anything like it,” he added.\n\n“The buzz, the feel, the roar, the crowd. And she’s put on a performance — after the blip in Tokyo not only got back to standard, she stepped up the game even more. It’s historic.\n\n“She’s adding an extra twist. She’s out in the next to somersault. But not just the floor, the package, the all-around. She’s been dominating for so long. She was born to do gymnastics and she’s a performer as well.\n\nHere are some other opportunities to watch Biles compete at the Olympics and possibly add to her medal count:\n\nThursday: Women’s all-around final, 6:15 p.m. local time (12:15 p.m. ET). Suni Lee also is qualified to compete in the event.\n\nSaturday: Women’s vault final, 4:20 p.m. local time (10:20 a.m. ET). Jade Carey also qualified to compete in the event.\n\nAugust 5: Women’s balance beam final, 12:38 p.m. local time (6:38 a.m. ET). Lee will compete in the event, too.\n\nAugust 5: Women’s floor exercise final, 2:23 p.m. local time (8:23 a.m. ET). Jordan Chiles qualified to compete in the event as well.\n\nChina wins gold in women's synchronized diving 10m platform\n\nQuan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi were dominant from start to finish as they picked up gold for China in the women’s synchronized diving 10m platform, the country’s seventh straight Olympic gold medal in the event.\n\nIt was a historic morning as North Korea’s Jo Jin Mi and Kim Mi Rae secured the nation’s first ever Olympics diving medal with silver, while Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix and Lois Toulson’s bronze was Team GB’s first Olympic medal in this event.\n\nThe internet is in love with South Korea’s record-breaking Olympic shooter\n\nShe’s impossibly cool, casually breaks world records and is the internet’s latest darling. And while her cap and futuristic glasses are merely functional accoutrements in the world of competitive shooting, they wouldn’t look out of place on a street style-inspired runway.\n\nShe’s Kim Ye-ji, the 31-year-old South Korean sharpshooter who has taken social media by storm following her appearance at the Paris Olympics.\n\nKim won silver at the 10-meter air pistol event on Sunday, with her 19-year-old teammate Oh Ye-jin taking the gold.\n\nBut it was an older video of Kim competing in Azerbaijan in May that went viral on X, formerly known as Twitter, gaining millions of views and a horde of new fans in just a few days.\n\nIn the video, Kim wears a backwards cap over her blunt bob, her steely gaze fixed on the target through a pair of shooting glasses — a piece of specialist eyewear that helps athletes focus on the target but also looks like something out of a science-fiction movie.\n\nRead the whole story here.\n\nTeam USA won gymnastic gold yesterday. Here's how the competition went down\n\nIt was the moment everyone’s been waiting for, and it lived up to the hype.\n\nA little more than three years after a shocking case of the “twisties” caused her to withdraw from Team USA’s attempt at defending its gymnastics team gold, Simone Biles was back under the bright lights of an Olympic final.\n\nThe Americans entered the day as the favorites after cruising through qualifying on Sunday, finishing five points clear of the Italian and Chinese teams. They had much the same experience on Tuesday as they recaptured their gold medal in dominant fashion.\n\nIn case you missed the action, here are some takeaways from Team USA’s golden performance:\n\nSimone Biles became winningest American Olympic gymnast of all time: She’s got a strong case to be called the greatest gymnast of all time. And on Tuesday, she set herself apart from every other American gymnast in history. The Olympic team gold medal was Biles’ eighth at a Games, more than any other American in history.\n\nItaly and Brazil made history: Italy’s women’s gymnastics team won the silver medal. The last time the team medaled was in 1928. The team was visibly emotional and celebrated with loud cheers and hugs. Brazil, meanwhile, placed third, finishing less than one point behind Italy to take home the bronze. This is the first team medal for Brazil in gymnastics.\n\nRussia was absent in major political statement: The gold medal-winning Russian team from 2021 wasn’t back this year. No Russian gymnasts will compete in Paris this year after the country was officially banned from the 2024 Summer Games for the invasion of Ukraine – though a small number of Russians are competing under the banner of the Individual Neutral Athletes. They will not be allowed to wear their country’s colors or have their anthem played should they win a medal."
