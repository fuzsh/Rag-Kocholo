        "text": "Wajma — An Afghan Love Story\n\n(Afghanistan)\n\nDir Barmak Akram\n\nWinner of the World Cinema Dramatic Screenwriting prize at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year before embarking on a healthy festival career, this documentary-style, ultra-realist film tells the story of Wajma (Wajma Bahar), a middle-class young woman in Kabul whose fateful decision leads to an unwanted pregnancy and a denial of paternity by her boyfriend Mustafa. Locked up and beaten by her father, Wajma is forced into desperate measures. Akram, who impressed with 2008’s Kabuli Kid, directs Afghanistan’s eighth foreign-language Oscar submission since 2002 — hoping to be the first to make the shortlist.\n\nContact Doc & Film International g.gallier@docandfilm.com\n\nAgon\n\n(Albania)\n\nDir Robert Budina\n\nTwo brothers from Albania emigrate to northern Greece in this tense drama. Each tries to integrate in their own way, with Saimir (Marvin Tafaj) trying to take on the responsibilities of his late parents. But younger brother Vini (Guljem Kotori), an artist, struggles to prove himself and eventually becomes involved in organised crime. Agon premiered at the Chicago International Film Festival last year and has played at international festivals including Saint Petersburg and Shanghai. The film is Albania’s eighth submission since 1996 and was shot in Albania and Greece using both languages.\n\nContact Era Film contact@erafilm-albania.com\n\nThe German Doctor\n\n(Argentina)\n\nDir Lucia Puenzo\n\nA premiere in Un Certain Regard at Cannes this year, The German Doctor centres on Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele (Alex Brendemühl) who arrives in Argentina’s remote Patagonia with a new identity. He moves into a hotel run by German-speaking Eva and her husband Enzo, taking a particular interest in their daughter Lilith. Directed by Puenzo (XXY) from her own novel Wakolda — the film’s Spanish title — The German Doctor won the audience award at Saint Petersburg before winning several awards at Argentina’s Unasur film festival. Samuel Goldwyn Films has picked up US rights.\n\nContact Pyramide International www.pyramidefilms.com\n\nThe Rocket\n\n(Australia)\n\nDir Kim Mordaunt\n\nAs an English-speaking country Australia infrequently submits films for the foreign-language Oscar but this is the third in a row after last year’s Lore and 2011’s Samson And Delilah (the first Australian submission to make the shortlist). The Rocket was shot in Laos and is about a young boy who leads his family on a search for a new home while entering a rocket competition. A substantial hit on the festival circuit, it premiered at Berlin this year, where it won the Generation Kplus prize and best first feature prize, and also did well at Tribeca winning best actor, best narrative feature and the audience award. It recently won an audience award at AFI Fest. Kino Lorber has taken it on for US distribution.\n\nContact LevelK www.levelk.dk\n\nThe Wall\n\n(Austria)\n\nDir Julian Roman Pölsler\n\nAdapted from Marlen Haushofer’s early 1960s bestseller, The Wall is essentially a one-woman show featuring Martina Gedeck (The Lives Of Others) as a woman who wakes up one morning in a spectacular Alpine locale to find she is cut off from the rest of civilization by a wall of glass with only a dog, a cow and a cat for company. Described by Screen as “riveting and emotionally involving though offering few conventional narrative pleasures”, The Wall premiered in competition at the Berlinale in February.\n\nContact The Match Factory info@matchfactory.de\n\nSteppe Man\n\n(Azerbaijan)\n\nDir Shamil Aliyev\n\nOnly Azerbaijan’s fifth submission to the foreign-language category, Steppe Man premiered at the Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival in November 2012. Shot in the Azerbaijani language and written by Vidadi Hasanov, the film centres on a young man (Salome Demuria) who lives on the steppes, having learned the wisdom of nature from his father. But when the old man dies he meets a young woman from the village and his life changes irrevocably. Director Aliyev’s first feature, Confession, was made in 2002, and he has worked for national TV as well as state body Azerbaijanfilm.\n\nContact Mushfig Hatamov azerfilm@mail.ru\n\nTelevision\n\n(Bangladesh)\n\nDir Mostofa Sarwar Farooki\n\nThe closing film of the Busan International Film Festival in 2012, Television went on to earn a special mention in Dubai’s main competition before a successful run through the international festival circuit. Filmed in the Bengali language, it is a light-hearted comedy set on an island ruled by a hardline Muslim cleric who bans television but is faced with a challenge when the only Hindu family decides to buy one. Director Farooki set up the Chabial film movement, a free-wheeling network of Indian directors who use cable TV as an outlet.\n\nContact M-Line Distribution sales@mline-distribution.com\n\nThe Broken Circle Breakdown\n\n(Belgium)\n\nDir Felix van Groeningen\n\nA haunting tale of love, death and bluegrass, The Broken Circle Breakdown has been a worldwide critical hit since it premiered at Berlin’s Panorama earlier this year, fuelled by notable lead performances from Veerle Baetens and Johan Heldenbergh. The film kicks off in the hospital where a couple learns their six-year-old daughter may have a terminal illness and twists back through time to when they first met: he is a bearded banjo player and she owns a tattoo parlour, but ends up singing with him. The film won awards for best actor and screenplay in a narrative feature film at Tribeca and has also picked up several European Film Awards nominations including film, director, actor and actress.\n\nContact The Match Factory info@thematchfactory.de\n\nAn Episode In The Life Of An Iron Picker\n\n(Bosnia & Herzegovina)\n\nDir Danis Tanovic\n\nTanovic, whose No Man’s Land won the foreign-language Oscar in 2002, looks into the lives of the Roma in his native Bosnia & Herzegovina. Nazif Mujic and Senada Alimanovic re-enact their own real-life story: he is an iron picker, hunting out scrap, she is five months pregnant. When she miscarries, the local hospital sends her home until the couple can come up with $675 (€500) for treatment, an impossible sum. She begins to slowly die. Iron Picker premiered in competition in Berlin this year, winning the best actor prize and the Jury Grand Prix, and opened the Sarajevo Film Festival.\n\nContact The Match Factory info@thematchfactory.de\n\nNeighbouring Sounds\n\n(Brazil)\n\nDir Kleber Mendonca Filho\n\nSet in the affluent coastal city of Recife, Brazil, this thrilling Short Cuts-like feature examines what happens in an apartment complex when a private security firm is brought in to deal with thefts. Former film critic Filho’s debut feature, which he also wrote, screened in competition in Rotterdam in 2012, winning the Fipresci award. The film’s festival career has included New Directors/New Films in New York and Rio, where it won best fiction feature and screenplay in 2012. Neighbouring Sounds has enjoyed wide arthouse play internationally.\n\nContact FiGa Films contact@figafilms.com\n\nThe Color Of The Chameleon\n\n(Bulgaria)\n\nDir Emil Hristov\n\nAn absurdist spy thriller with Kafka-esque overtones, The Color Of The Chameleon is a dark comedy set in 1989, just before the fall of communism across Eastern Europe. A clean-cut student is recruited by a captain of the secret police to infiltrate a subversive group at his university; a job he eventually comes to relish. Director Hristov, working from screenwriter Vladislav Todorov’s novel of the same name, then cuts to a post-Berlin Wall society where his victims are now in a position of power. Chameleon premiered at Toronto in 2012 before playing at Karlovy Vary this year.\n\nContact Peripeteia Films b.zakharieva@peripeteiafilms.com\n\nThe Missing Picture\n\n(Cambodia)\n\nDir Rithy Panh\n\nThe Missing Picture won the Un Certain Regard prize at Cannes this year for its painstaking use of clay models and dioramas against historical archive footage to recount the ravages of Pol Pot’s genocide in Cambodia. Director Panh was 11 when the Khmer Rouge took Phnom Penh in 1975 and The Missing Picture documents his family’s suffering until he fled to Thailand at the age of 15, later arriving in Paris to study film. Documenting the genocide has become Panh’s life’s work, and this is an eloquent piece in which the models substitute for the missing photographic evidence in the quest to expose the atrocities.\n\nContact Films Distribution www.filmsdistribution.com\n\nGabrielle\n\n(Canada)\n\nDir Louise Archambault\n\nQuebecois director Archambault’s second feature (after Familia) centres around Gabrielle (Gabrielle Marion-Rivard), a young woman with Williams syndrome who has an exceptional musical gift. She has found love with Martin, a fellow member of a choir for developmentally disabled adults, but their families are concerned and Gabrielle must fight for her freedom. Gabrielle is the latest production from Incendies and Monsieur Lazhar producers Luc Déry and Kim McCraw at Montreal-based micro_scope. It features an affecting performance from 23-year-old Marion-Rivard, who has Williams syndrome in real life.\n\nContact eOne Films International www.entertainmentone.com\n\nGriGris\n\n(Chad)\n\nDir Mahamat-Saleh Haroun\n\nA French-backed production shot in Chad, GriGris competed at Cannes this year and is the fifth feature from Paris-based, Chad-born director Haroun, whose A Screaming Man won the Cannes Jury Prize in 2010. The film tells the story of GriGris (Souleymane Démé), a poor aspiring photographer with a paralysed leg who nonetheless is an impressive dancer. When his stepfather falls ill, medical bills force him into begging for work from a local crime boss, even as he falls in love with the local prostitute.\n\nContact Les Films du Losange a.valentin@filmsdulosange.fr\n\nGloria\n\n(Chile)\n\nDir Sebastian Lelio\n\nThe third feature from Lelio was a huge crowdpleaser when it premiered in Berlin earlier this year, deservedly winning best actress for Paulina Garcia in the title role (she may well crop up in international acting nominations in awards season). Roadside Attractions picked up Gloria for US distribution and it quickly sold worldwide. Gloria is a 58-year-old divorcee who sees a last chance for love with an older naval officer in this funny, raw, and ultimately enlightening film co-produced with Spain. It is one of the strongest contenders for making the final five nominees.\n\nContact Funny Balloons pdanner@funny-balloons.com\n\nBack To 1942\n\n(China)\n\nDir Feng Xiaogang\n\nFrom the director of Aftershock, this epic drama centres on the famine which ravaged Henan province during the Japanese invasion in 1942, killing an estimated three million people. Zhang Guoli stars as a wealthy landowner who loses everything and must stand by as his family starts to die of starvation. Tim Robbins and Adrien Brody also have roles in Back To 1942, which was the surprise film at the 2012 Rome Film Festival and went on to open in China in late November.\n\nContact Huayi Brothers Media Corp sales@huayimedia.com\n\nLa Playa DC\n\n(Colombia)\n\nDir Juan Andres Arango\n\nA premiere in Un Certain Regard at Cannes in 2012, Arango’s debut feature is about a teenager trying to cope with the harsh reality of life on the mean streets of Bogota. Tomas has come to the capital — the Distrito Capital, or DC of the title — with his two wayward brothers, but unlike them he realises he needs a trade to make anything of his life. Serving an apprenticeship at a barbers which specialises in the elaborate hairdos so beloved of Afro-Colombians, Tomas falls in love and is forced to grow up in this edgy coming-of-age title from a notable new film-maker.\n\nContact Doc & Film International, g.gallier@docandfilm.com\n\nHalima’s Path\n\n(Croatia)\n\nDir Arsen Anton Ostojic\n\nHalima’s Path tells the story of a strong-willed Muslim woman called Halima (Alma Prica) who tries to find the remains of her son who was killed in the Bosnian war and buried in one of the many mass graves in the region. Understanding that she must first track down her estranged niece in order to find the whereabouts of his body, she uncovers a horrifying truth that affects her present as well as her past. Ostojic’s films have twice represented Croatia in the foreign-language Oscar submission list: 2004’s A Wonderful Night In Split and No One’s Son in 2008. Both were also multiple award-winners on the festival circuit.\n\nContact Arkadena Zagreb trninictrn@gmail.com\n\nThe Don Juans\n\n(Czech Republic)\n\nDir Jiri Menzel\n\nCzech New Wave master Menzel won the foreign-language film Oscar in 1967 with Closely Watched Trains, made when he was just 28. His latest film, which premiered at Montreal in September, is set in the world of opera. Funny and fast, The Don Juans is about a small-town troupe in the Czech Republic with an eccentric director who plans a production of Mozart’s Don Giovanni. Menzel also wrote the film.\n\nContact Media Pro Pictures office@mediapropictures.ro\n\nThe Hunt\n\n(Denmark)\n\nDir Thomas Vinterberg\n\nThe Hunt is a powerful contemporary drama set in a Danish village in the run-up to Christmas. Mads Mikkelsen is compelling as Lucas, a divorced kindergarten teacher who becomes the subject of a hysterical witch-hunt when a child’s allegations spiral out of control. From Festen director Vinterberg, The Hunt premiered in Competition at Cannes in 2012, where it won the best actor prize. With Magnolia Pictures distributing in the US this tense, claustrophobic drama has been widely sold and featured as a staple of international awards lists since its release — recently winning the Nordic Council Film Prize. It is a strong candidate for the final five.\n\nContact: TrustNordisk info@trustnordisk.com\n\nWho’s The Boss?\n\n(Dominican Republic)\n\nDir Ronni Castillo\n\nRomantic comedy Who’s The Boss? (Quien Manda?) is only the sixth film to be submitted to the foreign-language Oscar category by the Dominican Republic. Castillo’s feature debut, from a script by Daniel Aurelio, is about Alex and Nathalie, a couple who fail to take their relationships seriously: after three months they break it off and move on. But when they get together, it isn’t quite so easy and they both battle for control. Released in the Dominican Republic in late August, Who’s The Boss? reportedly notched up 50,000 admissions in its opening weekend, making it a significant success for its 26-year-old director.\n\nContact Caribbean Tales Worldwide Distribution www.caribbeantales-worldwide.com\n\nPorcelain Horse\n\n(Ecuador)\n\nDir Javier Andrade\n\nTwo brothers, Paco and Luis, pawn their wealthy parents’ possessions to keep up a freebasing high. Older brother Paco dallies with his married childhood sweetheart and hides behind his rock musician sibling but is happy to benefit from his antics, the latest of which is to pawn the titular porcelain horse, leading to an argument which changes the course of their lives. Andrade’s first feature caused a stir at the Miami International Film Festival when it debuted there in 2012, in particular for its abrupt and jarring finale.\n\nContact FiGa Films contact@figafilms.com\n\nWinter Of Discontent\n\n(Egypt)\n\nIbrahim El-Batout\n\nEgypt did not submit a film to the foreign-language Oscar category in 2012 following the chaos in the country and it is notable that 2013’s submission is centred on the events which led to the Tahrir Square uprising. Winter Of Discontent depicts torture under the old regime of Hosni Mubarak and attempts by the secret police to quash the revolution. A world premiere at Venice last year, the film stars Amr Waked and Salah Al Hanafy and is about a young computer programmer who is tortured by police. El-Batout’s past films include Eye Of The Sun and Hawi.\n\nContact Double Dutch Media Jason@doubledutchmedia.ca\n\nFree Range\n\n(Estonia)\n\nDir Veiko Ounpuu\n\nFree Range is the story of an aspiring young writer whose girlfriend becomes pregnant at about the same time he is fired from his job, forcing him to take stock and figure out his place in the world. Starring Lauri Lagle, Jaanika Arum and Laura Peterson, Free Range (subtitled Ballad On Approving Of The World) is Ounpuu’s third feature. His 2007 debut Autumn Ball won the Venice Horizons competition. The director’s 2010 film The Temptation Of St Tony was also submitted to the foreign-language Oscar category but did not make the shortlist.\n\nContact LevelK natja@levelk.dk\n\nDisciple\n\n(Finland)\n\nDir Ulrika Bengts\n\nThe second feature from Bengts, after 2011’s Iris, is about a tyrannical lighthouse keeper and the hold he keeps over his family — something which is threatened when a new assistant arrives. A premiere at this year’s Montreal World Film Festival, Disciple follows 13-year-old Karl, who comes to an island in the Baltic Sea in the summer of 1939 as a new government-appointed assistant to lightkeeper Vilhelm (Niklas Groundstroem). Vilhelm says there has been a mistake, as his own son can do the job, but Karl doesn’t want to go back to the orphanage. The outsider brings tensions to an already difficult situation in this beautifully composed film.\n\nContact Langfilm Productions jukka@langfilm.fi\n\nRenoir\n\n(France)\n\nDir Gilles Bourdos\n\nBathed in the hazy sunshine of a Cote d’Azur summer in 1915, Renoir is the real-life story of Impressionist painter Pierre-August Renoir and his son Jean Renoir, who would go on to become one of the world’s greatest film-makers, and Andrée Heuschling, the young artist’s model who enchants them both. Michel Bouquet, Christa Theret and Vincent Rottiers star in the film, which was written by director Bourdos and Jérome Tonnerre. Produced by Fidélité Films, Renoir made its world premiere as the closing film of Un Certain Regard at Cannes 2012. Samuel Goldwyn Films released the film in the US earlier this year, where it has grossed more than $2m.\n\nContact Wild Bunch www.wildbunch.biz\n\nIn Bloom\n\n(Georgia)\n\nDirs Nana Ekvtimishvili, Simon Gross\n\nThis vivid coming-of-age film about two 14-year-old girls growing up in 1990s Georgia in the aftermath of the country’s secession from the Soviet Union stars Lika Babluani and Mariam Bokeria. The Germany-Georgia-Poland co-production was one of the breakout hits of this year’s Berlinale, winning the Forum’s CICAE prize and going on to become a popular fixture on the festival circuit. Ekvtimishvili, who based the script on her own adolescent experiences of Tbilisi, makes her directorial debut as co-director with regular German collaborator Gross. In Bloom will be released in the US by Big World Pictures and in the UK by Artificial Eye.\n\nContact Memento Films Int’l sales@memento-films.com\n\nTwo Lives\n\n(Germany)\n\nDir Georg Maas\n\nJuliane Köhler plays a German-born woman living contentedly in Norway with her aging mother, played by Liv Ullmann, in this gripping political thriller. Her life is thrown into chaos when she is confronted with her past as an informant for the Stasi in East Germany. Based on a true story, Two Lives reveals the plight of the so-called Lebensborn children, the offspring of Norwegian women and German soldiers during the Nazi occupation of Norway.

Yannis Papadopoulos plays the impoverished Yorgos, who roams the city with his beloved canary, whose food he often has to share. Boy Eating The Bird’s Food first screened at Karlovy Vary in 2012 before going on to festivals including Toronto, where it played in the Discovery section, and Galway, where it won the audience award for best international first film. It is produced by Giorgos Karnavas’s Stefi Productions.\n\nContact Premium Films www.premium-films.com\n\nThe Grandmaster\n\n(Hong Kong)\n\nDir Wong Kar-wai\n\nInfused with Wong’s breathtaking visuals and poetic story-telling, the director’s decade-in-the-making homage to martial arts master Ip Man, who famously trained Bruce Lee, stars Tony Leung Chiu-Wai and Zhang Ziyi. The Grandmaster is Wong’s most commercially successful film to date, smashing box office records in China where it has grossed over $45m and taking $6.3m in the US from its release via The Weinstein Company. Produced by Wong’s Jet Tone Films, The Grandmaster made its international debut out of competition at the Berlinale. A film by Wong has yet to be nominated for a foreign-language Oscar.\n\nContact Fortissimo Films info@fortissimo-hk.com\n\nWild Bunch www.wildbunch.biz\n\nThe Notebook\n\n(Hungary)\n\nDir Janos Szasz\n\nThe winner of the Crystal Globe at Karlovy Vary this year is a powerful drama about two brothers sent to live with their grandmother to escape an impending war at home.
