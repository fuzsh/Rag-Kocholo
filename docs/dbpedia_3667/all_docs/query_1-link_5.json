Development, programs, challenges\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHaferburg, Manfred\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIn the wake of the accident at the Soviet RBMK reactor unit 4 in Chernobyl the nuclear industry founded the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO). To this day, the purpose of the organization has been to enhance worldwide cooperation of nuclear industry and, in this way, strengthen the safety and availability of nuclear power plants. Following some first steps after 1986, the charter of the organization was signed at the WANO constituent assembly in Moscow on May 15 and 16, 1989. The member companies thus committed themselves to support WANO's mission. WANO was established for these purposes: ''The mission of WANO is to maximize the safety and reliability of nuclear power plants worldwide by working together to assess, benchmark and improve performance through mutual support, exchange of information, and emulation of best practices.'' The WANO programs developed speedily thereafter. The focus was on peer reviews. In 2000, the first interim objective had been reached: Fifty percent of all member nuclear power plants had undergone peer reviews. In addition, plant-related peer reviews were extended throughout all operator organizations, and corporate peer reviews were developed. The other WANO programs as well, i.e. exchanges of experience, technical support, and performance indicators, exerted more and more influence on industry. Peer reviews covered entire operator organizations, and corporate peer reviews were developed. The worldwide paradigm shift in evaluating the use of nuclear power, and the associated construction programs for new nuclear power plants already in their implementation phase, assigned a new quality to the work of WANO. The organization is preparing a long-term strategy in the face of the challenges to be expected. The ultimate objective of these efforts is to support member organizations from the first preparations of a nuclear power plant project to the end of commercial operation. (orig.)\n\nIAEA and WANO Sign New Memorandum of Understanding\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFull text: The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) have signed a new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to reflect increased cooperation between the two organisations following the Fukushima Daiichi accident of March 2011. The new agreement enables the two organisations to work more closely together to support the safe and reliable operation of nuclear power plants worldwide, and to enhance information exchange on operating experience and other relevant areas. Through the IAEA's Nuclear Safety Action Plan, IAEA Member States urged the IAEA and WANO to strengthen their MoU to enhance information exchange. WANO member operators also recommended stronger collaboration. Through the new agreement, the two organisations are adopting a more coordinated approach to their respective activities, in order to help prevent further accidents and mitigate the consequences should an accident occur. Plans are now in place to coordinate the timing of IAEA Operational Safety Review Team (OSART) missions and WANO peer reviews, and to arrange periodic meetings of WANO and Agency staff to discuss major safety-related activities. The two organisations will also cooperate and coordinate work on their respective performance indicator programmes and will work towards exchanging information and support in the event of a serious event at a nuclear power plant or fuel cycle facility. In addition to this, the IAEA and WANO will supply staff to each other's review teams when appropriate, and will regularly exchange documents relating to operating experience. Yukiya Amano, Director General of the IAEA, said: ''The IAEA's Action Plan on Nuclear Safety emphasises the importance of working more closely with WANO and other international organisations, so that we can all better address the demands of the future. This agreement is an important step in strengthening that cooperation and enhancing the flow of information on nuclear safety issues\n\nPreparing for the future by improving the performance of today's nuclear stations: The WANO perspective\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTsutsumi, R.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThe World Association of Nuclear Operators, (WANO) was established in 1989 in the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident with the mission of maximizing the safety and reliability of nuclear power plants by exchanging information and encouraging communication, comparison and emulation among its members. All nuclear power stations in the world are WANO members. WANO conducted an Internal Review in 1997 and its report issued this January confirms that the WANO mission is still valid. As a result of the Internal Review, WANO is taking actions to further improve its programmes. WANO's effort to keep members conscious of safety culture in their daily work at plants is a key element for improving operational safety. WANO will be able to contribute to the future of the nuclear industry by encouraging members to actively participate in WANO programmes which are aimed at improving nuclear safety and plant performance.

The reviews are conducted to assess the performance of plant personnel, the conditions of systems and equipment, the quality of programmes and procedures, and the effectiveness of plant management. The review team consists of highly qualified staff from other WANO members throughout the world who have extensive practical experience in the area the review. At the request of Paris Centre Members, the fire protection area has been added to the scope of WANO peer reviews. Relevant performance objectives and criteria have been developed to cover this area, these are written guidances upon which review of plant performance can be based. They are supported by criteria, more narrow in scope, to help further define what attributes of the fire protection management area contribute to the achievement of the associated performance objective.

WANO's Role in Maintaining and Improving Safety Culture\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTsutsumi, Ryosuke\n\n2001-01-01\n\nOver the past several years, operators of the world's nuclear plants have compiled an increasingly impressive record of operational performance. Among the many factors that have led to this improvement are the unprecedented cooperation and information exchange among the world's nuclear operators. This paper presents the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) operating experience program and WANO peer review program as examples of the kinds of interaction that are occurring around the globe to maintain and improve the nuclear safety culture. In addition, some unique features of WANO are discussed. WANO has established four programs to help its members communicate effectively with each other. These include the exchange of operating experiences, voluntary peer reviews, professional and technical development, and technical support and exchange. The operating experience program alerts members to events that have occurred at other NPPs and enables members to take appropriate actions to prevent event recurrence. When an event occurs at a plant, management at that plant analyses the event and completes an event report, which is then sent to the WANO regional center to which the plant belongs. After a regional center review and necessary iteration, the report is posted onto the WANO Web site to make it available to all WANO members. By the end of 2000, more than 1500 event reports had been posted. The WANO Peer Review Program is a unique opportunity for members to learn and share the best worldwide insights into safe and reliable nuclear operations. The peer review program has become one of WANO's most important activities containing all essential elements of WANO's mission. A WANO peer review team consists of 15 to 16 people with NPP experience; most team members are from countries outside the one that they are visiting. These teams of peers from plants around the world visit host plants upon request to identify strengths and areas for improvement, with a strong\n\nTreatment of operational experience of nuclear power plants in WANO\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nIbanez, M.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe article describes the activities associated to the Operating Experience Programme of the World Association of Nuclear Operators. The programme manages the event reports submitted by the nuclear power plants to the WANO database for the preparation by the Operating Experience Central Team of some documents like the significant Operating Experience Reports and Significant Event Reports that help the stations to avoid similar events.

M.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nWANO (World Association of Nuclear Operators) implemented a program known as PEER REVIEW at the Santa Maria de Garona NPP in 1996. It was as follows, an international team consisting of professionals with experience in nuclear power plants observed different activities in the plant, hold interviews and meetings, and finally they checked all the information during three weeks, in order to compare the plant with the WANO's Excellence Criteria at work. The result was that the plant was in a good state and most of the implemented activities and practices of work were done properly, further the usual demands and rules. However it was noticed that some of the activities could be improved, If we compare them with the optimum practices. The plant started a work plan defined as an objective in the COMPANY PROJECT it self, in order to implement the corrective actions which could resolve the proposed improvements by WANO. Following the PEER REVIEW program, approximately one year and a half later, a WANO team came back to the plan for a week in June 1998, they came back to implement what is known as a FOLLOW UP, that is today, a control resting on the monitoring of facts of the fulfillment level for the improvements which had been recommended. After finishing this monitoring work, the result of the FOLLOW UP was that the plant has attained a very remarkable implantation of the recommendations showed in the PEER REVIEW.

They resolved to strengthen the existing links and co-operation among nuclear operators by setting up the World Association of Nuclear Operators (Wano). The mission of the association is to be: 'to maximize the safety and reliability of the operation of nuclear power stations by exchanging information, encouraging comparison and stimulating emulation among nuclear power station operators.' The formation of Wano presents some information technology problems of a rather special kind that have to be solved before Wano can begin operation. The representatives at the Paris meeting therefore appointed a steering committee under Lord Marshall's chairmanship to formulate detailed proposals. The leaders of the world's nuclear operators will meet again in Moscow on 15-17 May 1989 in order to ratify the steering committee proposals and appoint the first Wano Board of Governors. A small interim secretariat is already working in London. (author)\n\nWANO to increase focus on new nuclear as industry's centre of gravity shifts towards Asia\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKraev, Kamen [NucNet The Independent Global Nuclear News Agency, Brussels (Belgium)\n\n2018-02-15\n\nThe World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) intends to focus more on new nuclear units coming into operation around the world as the ''centre of gravity'' in the industry shifts from the US and Europe to the Middle East and Asia. The organisation's chief executive officer, Peter Prozesky, told NucNet that new-build projects in China, India, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates are giving WANO the opportunity to make sure those countries start the operational life of their new units ''in a very positive way''. In supporting countries with new units beginning operation, WANO is working more closely with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). One of the IAEA's tasks is to help emerging nuclear countries develop the infrastructure and capability they need to have nuclear power as part of their energy mix.\n\nGrowing electricity demand and role of nuclear power in Asia. WANO Tokyo Center summarizes Asian Nuclear Power Atlas\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAnon.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nPresent status of the activities of World Association of Nuclear Operations (WANO) in Asia was briefly summarized here. The WANO Tokyo Center is the hub for WANO's activities having a member ship of 17 operators from six countries and territories. The center conducts a variety of activities designed to enhance the safety and reliability of nuclear power plants (NPPs) in Asia. Asian economy is expanding now in spite of the stagnation of recent world economy. The economic development has been paralleled by population growth in Asia and the 21st century may become the 'age of Asia'. Despite this remarkable economic growth, some parts of Asia are still at the developing stage in terms of electric power infrastructure. Demand for electric power is expected to increase dramatically from now on, making the development of electric power plants an urgent priority. Nuclear power has thus become the focus of increasing interest in Asia. At present, 17 operators in six countries of Asia operate 79 units at 32 power stations with a total capacity of approximately 60 GW, or equivalent to around 17% of the total capacity of all WANO members. China's massive NPP construction program and Indonesia's nuclear power program are expected to boost total capacity in future. (M.N.)\n\nTechnologies for improving current and future light water reactor operation and maintenance: Development on the basis of O and M experiences - the WANO perspective\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nChang, M.J.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nWorld Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) plays a role of promoting safety and reliability to nuclear industry after Chernobyl accident. Four programmes or so called cornerstones, operating experience, peer review, professional and technical development, and technical support and exchange have significantly promoted the nuclear operating performance in the past years. A WANO biennial general meeting was recently held in Victoria, Canada, which disclosed apparent achievements on higher unit capability factor, lower unplanned automatic scram per 7000 hours critical, lower collective radiation exposure and lower industrial safety accident rate. In more practical, exchange visits to learn good practices and measures in operation, maintenance, and management have shown benefits among WANO members. Recurring events can be minimized when members learn lessons from significant operating experience reports, significant event reports, and those events have posted on the WANO Web site. Particularly, plant managers' meetings that Tokyo Centre host have created an environment, which allows plant management to exchange ideas by such a face-to-face channel. WANO aims at nuclear safety and reliability. Economic and public acceptance are regarded as pillars to support WANO's mission as well. (author)\n\nWANO Activities Related to Identifying and Reducing the Likelihood for Recurring Events\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLlewellyn, Michael\n\n2003-01-01\n\nSince its inception, WANO has encouraged members to share operating experience and events information through the WANO Operating Experience Programme. Preventing recurring events is a prime reason for sharing events information. Over 2500 events have been shared through WANO since 1989. However, a review of WANO activities in 1997 identified that this information was not being used very well by WANO members, and that WANO was not adding much 'value' to the events sharing process. At the time, WANO only provided the 'postal exchange' function for events sharing, and was not reviewing events across WANO to help members focus on the really important issues. Often, these very important issues involve recurring events. As a result of the 1997 review of the WANO operating experience process, WANO re-sourced and developed new analysis capabilities and began producing new types of reports for its members. The resource commitment includes four seconded engineers (one from each WANO Regional Centre) brought to Paris to staff a WANO Operating Experience Central Team. This team analyses events across WANO, writes WANO event reports, provides operating experience-related training, and provides technical support to members to improve their use of operating experience information. One focus area for events analysis by WANO is the identification and subsequent industry notification of recurring events. As a result of the 1997 review of WANO activities, in 1998 WANO began production of several new types of event-based reports to communicate significant industry events to our members. A key focus of analysis of these significant events is whether they are recurring events (that is, very similar to previous events either at that NPP or another NPP in the industry). The reports are called Significant Operating Experience Reports (SOERs) and Significant Event Reports (SERs). Significant Operating Experience Reports (SOERs) are written by WANO when several event reports indicate that\n\nIAEA and WANO Mark Anniversary of Fukushima Accident, Increase Cooperation, 5 March 2012, Vienna/London\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFull text: Next Sunday, 11 March 2012, marks the first anniversary of the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck the east coast of Japan. One year on, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) are increasing their mutual cooperation to maximise nuclear safety efforts around the globe. The two organisations are revising their Memorandum of Understanding in light of the lessons learned from the Fukushima accident, and will be stepping up their efforts to share expertise and knowledge between operators and governments. There will be greater coordination between WANO peer reviews and IAEA OSART missions, in which international experts assess the safety of individual nuclear power plants, and discussions are under way to examine further areas to improve information sharing. This is in addition to the other work each organisation is doing to reinforce nuclear safety worldwide. IAEA Director General, Yukiya Amano said: 'The IAEA is delighted to strengthen its coordination and cooperation with WANO. One of the lessons of Fukushima is the need for strong and effective communication between governments, regulators and nuclear operators. The IAEA's Action Plan on Nuclear Safety underlines the need for all stakeholders to work together to put these lessons into practice as tangibly and swiftly as possible, to deliver concrete results. By working more closely together, we can help to ensure that practical experience is properly shared to reinforce nuclear safety everywhere'. Laurent Stricker, Chairman of WANO, commented: 'While the terrible events of last year had a major lasting impact on the industry, they have also served as the catalyst for huge change. WANO has shifted from primarily focusing on accident prevention, to an emphasis on both prevention and mitigation, and has redoubled its efforts to promote excellence in nuclear safety in each and every plant across the world. All nuclear plants have carefully\n\nWANO Actions to Reinforce the Operatorsâ Safety Culture Worldwide\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nRegaldo, J., E-mail: jacques.regaldo@edf.fr [WANO, London (United Kingdom)\n\n2014-10-15\n\nFull text: WANOâs mission is to maximize the safety and reliability of nuclear power plants worldwide by working together to assess, to benchmark and improve performance through mutual support, exchange of information and emulation of best practices. Fukushima accident strongly impacted the nuclear community and it also brought WANO to question its positioning and scope of activities. Five strategic actions have hence been decided to strengthen WANOâs role, aiming to bring a more consistent, transparent and integrated response to the nuclear operators. WANO peer review process, which constitutes its core-business, has been intensified including corporate and pre start up peer reviews and, for Japanese plants, restart reviews. WANO also decided to expand its scope of activity to include elements of design, based on the principle that the role of a nuclear operator is not only to operate safely, but also to be sure that the plant he is operating is safe. WANO aims to cooperate strongly at both regional and international levels with all international safety organizations, being convinced that trust can be recovered with a strong safety commitment and credibility of both regulators and operators. All operators, without exception, are WANO members; if membership is voluntary, members have to fulfil strict obligations. Safety supposes that no operator feels isolated, or refuses openness and permanent self-questioning; it requests as well for WANO to ensure that cultural and sometimes political barriers do not hinder safety culture â the accident of Fukushima is from this perspective rich in teachings. In WANO, we believe that management system and practices are at the centre of safety culture, and a full involvement of top management (CEOs) of our members is absolutely requested. Through its commitments and rules, WANO pressures its members and help them reaching the highest possible standard of safety. We consider that we rely on each other to improve safety\n\nOperational safety system performance alternative to the WANO's indicator\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLyra, Moacir\n\n2002-01-01\n\nOne of the operational safety performance indicators recommended by the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) and adopted by Electronuclear is the reliability of the safety systems. The parameter selected to represent this indicator is the average unavailability of the trains of the concerned system. This parameter would be universally representative of the reliability for comparison purpose only if all nuclear power plants were designed within the same redundancy criteria. Considering the diversity of design criteria of the power plants in operation and based on a probabilistic approach, this paper proposes new performance indicators which are comparable regardless the redundancy criteria of the system. A case example applied to a system of the Angra 2 nuclear power plant shows that, even though with the plant in the infancy phase, the performance of the system in the period is very good.

Such a review or inspection could be performed by international experts at regular intervals. In order to outline the interest of this approach, the authors describe who used to be in charge of safety before 2010-2011, i.e. what was the mission of the operator, what was the role of the national nuclear safety authority, what were the missions of the IAEA. It notably addresses the role of its OSARTs (Operational Safety Review Teams) by briefly describing how these teams were built up and operated. It also describes the role of WANO (World Association of Nuclear Operators) and its 'peer reviews'. It evokes the activities of this association (number of studied events, of inspection missions, of published reports). Then, the authors describe the evolution since 2010 and Fukushima (March 2011): planned evolutions within WANO by 2015, evolutions within the IAEA and its OSARTs (notably design reviews), and within the safety authorities\n\nPerformances of nuclear installations in the world\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPate, Z.T.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nDuring the last years the operators of nuclear power plants in the world, have realized numerous improvements.

The Performance Indicators defined by WANO are proven by the industry and should be included in a future indicator system. From the set of WANO-indicators, six have been chosen for evaluation in the project. The chosen indicators are: Collective Radiation Exposure (CRE), Fuel Reliability Index (FRI), Safety System Performance (SP1/2/5), Unplanned Automatic Scrams (UA7), Unit Capability Factor (UCF) and Unplanned Capability Loss Factor (UCL). The resulting indicator values for all the swedish nuclear power plants are presented in graphs for a 5-year period, 1998-2002. Data for the BWR and PWR-collectives are included for comparison. The type of graph used, a combined bar and curve chart, is considered to give the best representation of the data. As a guide when evaluating the results, explanations are provided for individual indicator values that deviate significantly from normal levels\n\nStatement to World Association of Nuclear Operators Biennial General Meeting, 24 October 2011, Shenzhen, China\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAmano, Y.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nI am grateful for the opportunity to address this important gathering, which is taking place at a crucial time for the nuclear energy sector. I greatly value the experience and expertise of the World Association of Nuclear Operators and I welcome your decision to devote this biennial general meeting to the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Japan. Together, WANO and the IAEA will play a key role in ensuring that the right lessons are learned from the accident and that the necessary improvements in nuclear operating safety are actually put into practice everywhere. We have been good partners since WANO was created in 1989. In the aftermath of Fukushima Daiichi, I believe our partnership must be deepened and intensified. Since the Fukushima Daiichi accident, the IAEA has worked hard to help Japan bring the situation at the site under control and to mitigate the consequences of the accident. The Agency's view is that all of the crippled reactors are now generally stable. The Japanese authorities are doing their utmost to achieve cold shutdown of all of them by the end of the year. I visited Japan a number of times for consultations with the Prime Minister and government ministers and went to the site of the accident in July. I dispatched international expert teams to assist in areas such as radiological monitoring and food safety. The Agency helped to channel international technical assistance to Japan and we also provided independent and factual reports on the situation to our Member States. We conducted a number of fact-finding missions, most recently on environmental remediation and related waste management issues. I convened a special IAEA Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety, devoted to the Fukushima Daiichi accident, which took place in Vienna in June. The Conference adopted a Ministerial Declaration aimed at strengthening nuclear safety, emergency preparedness, and radiation protection of people and the environment worldwide.

In 1991, the World Association of Nuclear Operations (WANO) initiated a pilot programme for voluntary 'Peer Reviews'. The success of this first exercise in gathering expert evidence led to the introduction of the 'Peer Review' programme in 1993 as one of the standard programmes of WANO. The object was to increase the safety and reliability of nuclear power stations throughout the world. WANO Peer Reviews are voluntary and are carried out at the request of a member. They are oriented towards special WANO performance objectives and criteria, which have been established by the management of WANO. (orig.)

The event was hosted by the Institute of Nuclear Science and Engineering of Idaho State University (ISU) and by the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), which has been planned to be the central nuclear technology research institution in the United States. The World Nuclear University (WNU) was founded in 2003 by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (OECD-NEA), the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO), and the World Nuclear Association (WNA) as a global association fo scientific and educational institutions in the nuclear field. The first WNU Summer Institute was designed at IAEA in Vienna in the course of the following year and planned by the WNU Coordinating Centre in London. The six weeks of lectures and presentations arranged by the World nuclear University in Idaho Falls are described in detail from the participants' perspective.

When it became clear that the operators of plants of an early design supplied by the USSR needed assistance in the upgrading of the safety of these units, WANO was uniquely placed to assist and facilitate in this. In July 1990, WANO took the decision to form a special project to assist the operators of the VVER 440/230 plants in their efforts to increase the safety standards for these units. The work performed by this special project team is described\n\nNuclear energetics all over the world\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWojcik, T.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThe actual state and tendencies of nuclear power further development for different world regions have been presented and discussed. The problem of safety of energetic nuclear reactors, radioactive waste management and related problems have been discussed in respect of regulations in different countries. The economical aspects of nuclear energetics in comparison with different fossil fuel power plants exploitation costs has been presented as well. The official state of international organizations (IAEA, WANO, HASA etc.) have been also shown in respect to subject presented\n\nOperational experience feedback in the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO)\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRevuelta, Ramon\n\n2004-01-01\n\nOperators in high-risk industries need to be learning organisations, learning from themselves and from the others. This presentation will describe how the nuclear industry is dealing in an integrated manner with the feedback of operating experience (OE), both internal and external, to increase the safety and reliability of power plants; it will describe how it: - investigates events; - reports events and analyses trends; - shares information to prevent recurrence; - performs corrective action and training; - performs assessments to verify effectiveness. The plants have achieved great improvements in performance overall, and to improve further, the industry is evolving. Instead of just learning from past events (reactive) it is now focusing on lower level indications of problems (precursors) through low level events reporting, trending and analysis. A hallmark of the industry is its desire to be self-critical. Emphasis is placed on improving the bottom quartile performing plants\n\nImproving the international system for operating experience feedback. INSAG-23. A report by the International Nuclear Safety Group\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe operational safety performance of nuclear facilities has, in general, improved notably over time throughout the world. This has been achieved, in part, through operating experience feedback (OEF) and the introduction of new technology. While the continued strong safety performance by operators is encouraging, safety significant events continue to recur in nuclear installations. This indicates that operators are not learning and applying the lessons that experience can teach us. This report focuses on systems that are operated by intergovernmental organizations with close contacts to national regulatory authorities. These systems provide an alternative network to the worldwide system employed by the operators of nuclear facilities known as the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO). The WANO system is restricted to its members, who have concluded that keeping the information exchanged confidential improves its usefulness. INSAG recognizes the merits of this approach, particularly in light of the primary responsibility of licensed operators for the safety of their facilities. Nevertheless, INSAG encourages WANO to share key safety lessons with national regulatory authorities and intergovernmental organization\n\nThe Hatch-Smolensk exchange\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSproles, A.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nDuring summer 1992, the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) sponsored an exchange visit between Georgia Power Company's Edwin I. Hatch nuclear plant, a two-unit boiling water reactor site, and the Smolensk atomic energy station, a three-unit RBMK (graphite-moderated and light-water-cooled) plant located 350 km west of Moscow, in Desnogorsk, Russia. The Plant Hatch team included Glenn Goode, manager of engineering support; Curtis Coggin, manager of training and emergency preparedness; Wayne Kirkley, manager of health physics and chemistry; John Lewis, manager of operations; Ray Baker, coordinator of nuclear fuels and contracts; and Bruce McLeod, manager of nuclear maintenance support. Also traveling with the team was Jerald Towgood, of WANO's Atlanta Centre. The Hatch team visited the Smolensk plant during the week of July 27, 1992\n\nIAEA workshop on the year 2000 issue (Y2K)\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThe document gives the highlights of the workshop conducted by the IAEA from 12 to 16 July 1999 to assist its Member States on the challenge that the Year 2000 issue (Y2K) presents to operators and regulators of nuclear power plants. The workshop was attended by 52 participants and lecturers from 21 countries and from the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO)\n\nThe value of peer reviews to nuclear plant safety\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSubalusky, W.T. Jr.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nOn a global basis, the nuclear utility industry has clearly demonstrated the value of peer reviews for improving nuclear safety and overall plant performance. Peer reviews are conducted by small teams of technical experts who review various aspects of plant operation, recognize strengths and recommend improvements, thereby stimulating a positive response to the recommendations. U.S. nuclear utilities initiated the operator-to-operator peer review process first through the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO). Now, voluntary peer reviews are an important activity of the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO). Formed just five years ago. WANO has made significant progress in its key activities of the operator-to-operator exchanges, operating experience exchange, monitoring of plant performance indicators and sharing of good practices worldwide. A fifth activity, peer review on a strictly voluntary basis, is pertinent to this paper\n\nProceedings of the joint WANO/OECD-NEA workshop on pre-stress loss in NPP containments\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThis joint WANO/OECD-NEA workshop on pre-stress loss in NPP containments started with Opening Remarks (by OECD and EDF) and two presentations on 'Creep and Shrinkage of Concrete: Physical Origins, Practical Measurements', and 'Past, Present and Future Techniques for Predicting Creep and Shrinkage of Concrete'. It was then followed by papers and presentations from 12 countries, which titles are: Assessment of Creep Methodologies for Predicting Prestressing Forces Losses in Nuclear Power Plant Containments; Prestress Behaviour in Belgian NPP Containments; Presentation of Gentilly 2 NPP Containment (abstract only); Containment Structure Monitoring and Prestress Losses; Experience from Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant (China); Prestress losses in NPP containments - the EDF experience; Prestress Force Monitoring on the THTR Prestressed Concrete Reactor Vessel During 19 Years; NPP Containment Design: Evolution and Indian Experience; In-Service Inspections and R and D of PCCVs in Japan; Comparison of Grouted and Un-grouted Tendons in NPP Containments; Prestress Losses in Containment of VVER 1000 Units; Prestressing in Nuclear Power Plants; Anchor Lift-off Measuring System for 37 T 15 Tendons; Monitoring of Stressed-Strained State and Forces in Reinforcing Cables of Prestressed Containment Shells of Nuclear Power Plants; Long-Term In-Service Monitoring of Pre-stressing in Magnox Pre-stressed Concrete Pressure Vessels; The Measurement of Un-bonded Tendon Loads in PCPV and Primary Containment Buildings; The Long Term In-service Performance of Corrosion Protection to Prestressing Tendons in AGR Prestressed Concrete Pressure Vessels; Prestress Force Losses in Containments of U.S. Nuclear Power Plants.

It covers activities of the WNA/CORDEL/Design Change Management Task Force, including views on the roles of vendors, owner's groups, utility and design authority, WANO and the regulators. The presentation highlights differences of capabilities between large utilities with strong technical staff and smaller utilities that require support and expertise from others. It also notes the current expectation that licensees are solely responsible for the safety of the design and operation of their plants and for maintaining a full understanding and knowledge of the design within licensee's own organization in an internal entity called design authority. It encourages regulators to re-examine this expectation for design changes, arguing that while large utilities maybe be able to deal with design changes, the smaller utilities may be challenged due to their small size and lack of appropriate expertise. It further notes that the original designer must be involved in the management of design changes. In addition, the presentation emphasizes benefits of standardization in design and regulatory expectations internationally, including the benefits of increasing safety and economy. The author provides that the CORDEL Working Group uses international standardization to mean that each vendor's design can be built by a vendor, and ordered by a utility, in every country and be able to meet national regulations without significant changes other than adaptations to meet site requirements. In this discussion, he highlights the aircraft industry as an example and notes the need for internationally agreed mechanisms for design change as well as the need for formal, agreed (internationally) role for the designer to play throughout the fleet lifetime\n\nNuclear industry: no danger of over-reacting\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFowler, David.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nThe chairman of the governing body of the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) has recently commented on the hold-up of improvements to east European reactors due to delays in the provision of funding by western nations. At Chernobyl, two of the four reactors are still in operation. The main defects which led to the disaster in 1986 have been corrected in these and all similar RBMKs. But desirable improvements remain to be carried out to eliminate the risk of minor accidents. The west is criticized for committing too much funding to western engineering studies. The emphasis should now be on enabling eastern operators to buy and install new equipment. Technology transfer is also important so that equipment can be made locally and more cheaply. WANO is increasingly concerned by conditions attached to grants from 67 countries which are administered by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Bank is singled out for criticism over delays in funding safety improvements to older reactors.

The central elements of the WNU partnership are: - The global organizations of the nuclear industry: WNA and WANO; - The inter-governmental nuclear agencies: IAEA and OECD-NEA; - Leading institutions of nuclear learning in some thirty countries. The WNU was inaugurated in 2003 as a non-profit corporation. Operationally, the WNU is a public-private partnership. On the public side, the WNUCC's multinational secretariat is composed mainly of nuclear professionals supplied by governments; the IAEA further assists with financial support for certain WNU activities. On the private side, the nuclear industry provides administrative, logistical and financial support via the WNA. WNU activities fall into six programmatic categories: 1. Facilitate Multinational Academic Cooperation. 2. Build Nuclear Leadership. 3. Foster Policy Consensus on Institutional and Technological Innovation. 4. Enhance Public Understanding. 5. Shape Scientific and Regulatory Consensus on Issues Affecting Nuclear Operations. 6. Strengthen International Workforce Professionalism. This presentation will describe the WNU programmes addressed to young professionals. Among such programmes, the flagship of the WNU is the WNU Summer Institute. This unique six-week course occurs in a different country each year, offering an inspiring career opportunity for some 100 outstanding young nuclear professionals and academics from around the world. The WNU-SI programme combines an extensive series of 'big picture' presentations from world-class experts with daily team-building exercises. In the process, WNU Fellows become part of a global network of future nuclear leaders. Other WNU programmes for younger generation in the nuclear industry will also be briefly covered in this presentation.

This success is due to many factors, one of which is an unprecedented level of information exchange. The Chernobyl accident in 1986, which led to the formation of World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO), underscored the need for nuclear utilities worldwide to exchange information and cooperate in a way that transcends cultural, language and political boundaries. While the world's nuclear operators have achieved significant improvements in nuclear safety and reliability, it is an unfortunate reality that the memories of the accidents at Three Mile Island and even Chernobyl fade over time. Complacency can be the natural result of progress and success. If nuclear power is to continue to play a significant role in the world's energy mix, the positive trends of performance improvement must be sustained and enhanced - and that can best be achieved through continued mutual cooperation, and the will to avoid a natural trend toward complacency.

G.; Raidis, Z.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe 60 year life of a reactor means that a plant will undergo change during its life. To ensure continuing safety, changes must be made with a full understanding of the design intent. With this aim, regulators require that each operating organisation should have a formally designated entity responsible for complete design knowledge in regard to plant safety. INSAG-19 calls such an entity 'Design Authority'. This requirement is difficult to achieve, especially as the number of countries and utilities operating plants increases. Some of these operating organisations will be new, and some will be small. For Gen III plants sold on a turnkey basis, it is even more challenging for the operating company to develop and retain the full knowledge needed for this role. CORDEL's Task Force entitled 'Design Change Management' is investigating options for effective design change management with the aim to support design standardization throughout a fleet's lifetime by means of enhanced international cooperation within industry and regulators. This paper starts with considering the causes of design change and identifies reasons for the increased beneficial involvement of the plant's original vendor in the design change process. A key central theme running through the paper is the definition of responsibilities for design change. Various existing mechanisms of vendor-operator interfaces over design change and how they are managed in different organisational and regulatory environments around the world are considered, with the functionality of Owners Groups and Design Authority being central. The roles played in the design change process by vendors, utilities, regulators, owners' groups and other organisations such as WANO are considered The aerospace industry approach to Design Authority has been assessed to consider what lessons might be learned.

The continuos and safe operation of the unit is supported through feedback from other utilities (lessons learned) and equipment vendors and manufacturers. A permanent proactive approach in monitoring the international nuclear technology practices, standards changes and improvements, and upon feasibility review, introducing them into processes and equipment upgrades, is applied. As a member of the most important international integrations, NPP Krsko has benefited from the opportunity of sharing its experience with others (World Association of Nuclear Operators -WANO, Institute of Nuclear Power Operations - INPO, International Atomic Energy Agency - IAEA, Nuclear Operations Maintenance Information Service - NOMIS, Nuclear Maintenance Experience Exchange - NUMEX, Electric Power Research Institute - EPRI, Westinghouse Owners Group - WOG, etc.). Voluntary activities and good practices related to safety are achieved by international missions (IAEA Assessment of Safety Significant Events Team - ASSET, IAEA Operational Safety Review Team - OSART, WANO Peer Review, International Commission for Independent Safety Analysis - ICISA) and operating experience exchange programs through international organizations. These missions are promoting the highest levels of excellence in nuclear power plant operation, maintenance and support. With time, the practices described in this paper presented themselves as most contributing to safe and reliable operation of our power plant and at the same time supporting cost optimization making it a viable and reliable source of electrical energy in the more and more deregulated market.

The Association is aware that hunger exists in a world of plenty and that poverty, gender inequity, ethnocentrism, racism, and the lack of political will are key constraints to solving the problems of global hunger and malnutrition. Recognizing that simplistic approaches are inadequate, the ADA identifies sustainable development as the long-term strategy to ending world hunger and achieving food security. Sustainable development requires political, economic, and social changes that include empowering the disenfranchised, widening access to assets and other resources, narrowing the gap between rich and poor, and adjusting consumption patterns so as to foster good stewardship of nature. Additionally, because the health status of future generations is related to the well-being of their mothers, achieving food security will also require increased access for women to education, adequate health care and sanitation, and economic opportunities. This position paper reviews the complex issues of global food insecurity and discusses long-term solutions for achieving world food security. Achieving the end of world hunger has been and is now within our grasp. There is sufficient food to feed everyone, and solutions can be realized now that will benefit all of humanity. As noted in the paper, most people who examine the costs of ending versus not ending world hunger are bewildered by the question of why humanity did not solve the problem a long time ago. The Association supports programs and encourages practices that combat\n\nAssociation between laboratory capacities and world-cup performance in Nordic combined.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRasdal, Vegard; Fudel, Ronny; Kocbach, Jan; Moen, Frode; Ettema, Gertjan; Sandbakk, Ãyvind\n\n2017-01-01\n\nNordic combined (NC) is an Olympic winter-sport performed as a ski jumping (SJ) event followed by a cross-country (XC) pursuit race employing the skating style. To elucidate the associations between sport-specific laboratory capacities and SJ, XC skiing, and overall NC performance in a world-cup NC event. Twelve international world-cup NC athletes from 8 nations performed laboratory testing one day prior to participating in a world-cup NC event. Squat jumps and SJ imitations (IMIT) were performed on a three-dimensional force plate, whereas XC skiing-specific physiological characteristics were obtained from roller ski skating tests on a treadmill and an all-out double poling (DP) test. Finally, body composition was measured. Laboratory capacities were correlated against performance in SJ, 10-km XC skiing, and overall NC in the world-cup event. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the best suited laboratory variables for predicting performance. Vertical IMIT velocity together with body-mass provided the best prediction for SJ performance (r2 = 0.70, pjump capacity while minimizing body-mass within the BMI limit set by FIS should be considered in the seasonal training of NC athletes.\n\nNEWS!

As a result, the number of knowledge networks in this field has risen dramatically in recent years. Some of these networks bring together actors within a specific region, such as European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG), Western European Nuclear Regulators Association (WENRA), The Arab Network of Nuclear Regulators (ANNuR). Still others cover entire continents such as Asian Nuclear Safety Network (ANSN), Asia Pacific Safeguards Network (APSN) and Forum of Nuclear Regulatory Bodies in Africa (FNRBA). Or even operate worldwide and globally, like IAEA Special Support Services, Global Nuclear Safety and Security Network (GNSSN), World Organization of Nuclear Operators (WANO) and International Nuclear Regulators Association (INRA)\n\nCooperation ability of Japan to China in nuclear power industries.

But on comparing the economic status it is seen that in spite of being the fifth largest electricity producing nation the per capita consumption is only around 600 units against a world average of 2500 units. The dependence on import is on the increase. Now that the country is headed for a sustained economic growth of about 10% GDP over the next few years, it is a challenge to provide the energy to fuel this growth. The Government of India has published an Integrated Energy Policy document, which projects the energy requirement for the next 25 years and stipulates the contribution from various resources. Although coal will continue to be the primary source, there is going to be a larger share of renewable in the energy mix. This is aimed at reducing dependence on imports and also to address the issue of global warming in an organized way. Policy makers have reiterated that reducing energy requirements and increasing efficiency are two very important measures to increase energy security. It has also been recognized that India's growing dependence on energy imports will make it more vulnerable to world price shocks and uncertainties. Hence, the thrust is to expand the use of domestic energy resources to the maximum. In this energy mix, Nuclear and Renewable energy sources are likely to gain popularity, like elsewhere in the world. India's foray in the nuclear energy started in 1969 when the two units at Tarapur started generating. These BWR units at Tarapur were set up on a Turnkey basis by General Electric, USA\n\nAssociation between laboratory capacities and world-cup performance in Nordic combined\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFudel, Ronny; Kocbach, Jan; Moen, Frode; Ettema, Gertjan; Sandbakk, Ãyvind\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground Nordic combined (NC) is an Olympic winter-sport performed as a ski jumping (SJ) event followed by a cross-country (XC) pursuit race employing the skating style.

To examine disaggregated associations of type of TE history with PTSD in a large cross-national community epidemiologic data set. The World Health Organization World Mental Health surveys assessed 29 TE types (lifetime exposure, age at first exposure) with DSM-IV PTSD that was associated with 1 randomly selected TE exposure (the random TE) for each respondent. Surveys were administered in 20 countries (nâ=â34â¯676 respondents) from 2001 to 2012. Data were analyzed from October 1, 2015, to September 1, 2016. Prevalence of PTSD assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Among the 34â¯676 respondents (55.4% [SE, 0.6%] men and 44.6% [SE, 0.6%] women; mean [SE] age, 43.7 [0.2] years), lifetime TE exposure was reported by a weighted 70.3% of respondents (mean [SE] number of exposures, 4.5 [0.04] among respondents with any TE). Weighted (by TE frequency) prevalence of PTSD associated with random TEs was 4.0%. Odds ratios (ORs) of PTSD were elevated for TEs involving sexual violence (2.7; 95% CI, 2.0-3.8) and witnessing atrocities (4.2; 95% CI, 1.0-17.8). Prior exposure to some, but not all, same-type TEs was associated with increased vulnerability (eg, physical assault; OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3-7.9) or resilience (eg, participation in sectarian violence; OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9) to PTSD after the random TE. The finding of earlier studies that more general history of TE exposure was associated with increased vulnerability to PTSD across the full range of random TE types was replicated, but this generalized vulnerability was limited to prior TEs involving violence, including participation in organized violence (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.6), experience of\n\nWhat is the value of performance indicators for the nuclear industry?\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nJohann Popp\n\n2006-01-01\n\nWANO is an Association of all Operators of Nuclear Power Plants worldwide. This association is promoting and running for their members 4 programmes which are Operating Experience, Peer Reviews, Professional and Technical Development and Technical Support and Exchange. The Technical Support and Exchange programme comprises Good Practices, Performance Indicators, Operator-to-Operator Exchanges and Technical Support Missions. This paper explains the Performance Indicator programme. WANO is collecting significant NPP nuclear power plant data and is computing indicators according to selected criteria for the only purpose of comparing or benchmarking plant performance of all types and different designs. All effective organisations measure their performance in order to know, how well they are doing and in order to identify opportunities for improvement. Indicators are central to the monitoring and reporting of progress towards sustainable development in all areas. Indicators are mainly derived from statistical data in order to exhibit weaknesses and strengths of programs. There are many hundreds of commercial and technical indicators known. WANO is tracing just ten significant indicators out of the many available, and only for the purpose of comparing plant performance. The first set of three indicators is more related to productivity and exhibit, how well management is planning, staff is maintaining and operators are conducting the plants. The second set of two indicators is related to safety systems, how well they are maintained and how reliable they are. The next set of two is material related and the last two indicators are related to human resources. Indicators are reflecting the current industrial standard and allow the positioning of a plant with regard to the 'state of the art'. They pinpoint to weaknesses and strengths of different designs/fleets\n\nTHE ROLE OF THE WORLD INSURANCE MARKET INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAntonina Sholoiko\n\n2017-09-01\n\nFull Text Available The purpose is to define a role and significance of elements of the world insurance market infrastructure.
