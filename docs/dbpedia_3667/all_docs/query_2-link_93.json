        "text": "The Romanian Orthodox Episcopate of North America (created in 1929) had a fate similar to other diaspora Orthodox churches from countries where Communist regimes took over, such as those in Russia, Ukraine, Serbia, and Albania; that is, it was split into two. The Communists in the home countries contributed to the division of the churches in the diaspora in an attempt to bring the diaspora communities under their control. The Romanian episcopate's first bishop, Policarp Morușcă (1935-1939), was prevented from returning to his post after a visit to Romania as WWII broke out, and even more so after Communism arrived in Romania with the Soviet tanks in 1944. His place was taken by Andrei Moldovan (1950-1963), when a group of priests who decided to remain faithful to the patriarchate in Bucharest designated him as their bishop and created a parallel structure that came to be eventually known as the Romanian Orthodos Metropolia of America (ROMA). In response to these developments, the initial episcopate (ROEA) congress decided to choose its own bishop in the person of the controversial Valerian Trifa (1950-1984), who was one of the leaders of the fascist Legionary Movement in interwar Romania, instigated the Legionary rebellion of January 1941, and profited from the Cold War to make his way to the United States as a refugee. Trifa was later succeeded by Nathaniel Popp (1984-present), and Moldovan by Victorin Ursache (1966-2001) and then by two bishops, Nicolae Condrea (2002-present) and Ioan Casian Tunaru (2017-present). At the height of the confrontation between the ROMA and the ROEA, the Communist authorities sent out controversial Archimandrite Valeriu Anania, a former Legionary Movement member who later became a Communist agent, to undermine Trifa. Trifa surrendered his American citizenship after Ceaușescu's Securitate got involved in the uncovering of Trifa's fascist past to the American authorities in the late 1970s. Post-Communist efforts at the reunification of the two dioceses have managed to reestablish sacramental communion but not reunification, with the ROMA remaining an autonomous diocese under the jurisdiction of the Romanian Orthodox Church, while the ROEA is part of the Orthodox Church in America. While the ROMA's Metropolitan Nicolae Condrea and Bishop Ioan Casian Tunaru are uncompromised, educated in the West, and willing to see some form of unity between the two Romanian dioceses, the ROEA's bishop Nathaniel bears with him the burden of the past and may not be too open to reconciliation. The split between the two ecclesiastical units is no longer justified, and hopefully the future will make it possible for them to be one.\n\nThe present article offers a brief survey of the modes of manifestation of anti-Semitism in Romania, from the time of the establishment of the state in the 19th century and until present day. While aware of the inherent limitations of attempting to carry out such an endeavour in the space of a short article, we believe that adopting such a broad historical perspective allows for observing patterns of continuity and change that could help explain some of the peculiarities of the Romanian varieties of anti-Semitism, as well as draw attention to the importance of a phenomenon that was central (albeit to varying degrees in different historical periods) to Romania’s modern history, and that is still visible in the country today. In doing so, the author aims both to provide a survey of the existing literature on the subject for the English-speaking audience, as well as to point out some of the gaps in the literature which call for further research on the subject. Finally, while the article will be limited to the case-study of Romania, some of the patterns of prejudice explored in its pages display clear parallels with the situation in other countries in Central and Eastern Europe, while others point to context-specific particularities that render the Romanian case distinct from other countries in the region.\n\nThis article explores the organisation and whereabouts of the neo-Legionary movement as it was (re)established in Romania in the 1990s. These groups and individuals defined themselves as Legionary, thus entering into the tradition of the Iron Guard/the Legion of Michael the Archangel, which was founded by the charismatic \"Captain\" Corneliu ZELEA CODREANU (1899-1938). Based on unique fieldwork conducted during the late 1990s, however, this article shows that neo-Legionaries were not unified within a single organisation at that time, but rather that they formed a loosely interconnected network of groups and figures. That is to say, neo-Legionary groups and individuals comprised a loose movement that was characterised by a particular set of references, a shared ideology and symbolism, and a strong family resemblance. Though it had significant ideological structures in common with the inter-war Legion and even mimicked its predecessor‘s organisation and rituals to some extent, the neo-Legionary movement of the first post-Communist decade was primarily a protest movement. It put forward a radical religious, social and political critique of the Communist legacy. This message was, nevertheless, mainly expressed through references to Codreanu‘s movement. The neo-Legionaries‘ political ideas and activity were influenced by their belief that transcendental forces influence life on earth. Their ideology fuses fascism, ethnic nationalism, anti-Semitism, Romanian folklore, mysticism and an idiosyncratic interpretation of Orthodox Christianity.\n\nThis article revisits the history of the Romanian Orthodox Church under communism and its instrumentalization after 1989 by focusing on the figure of Patriarch Justinian Marina (1948-1977). It argues that one of his successors and protégées, Patriarch Teoctist Arăpașu (1986-2007), had an interest in repainting Marina’s relation to the communist regime as opposition, more than collaboration, because he viewed the opening of the Securitate archives in 2000 with alarm, given the large number of Securitate informers among the Orthodox clergy. It then presents a debate that has taken place in post-1989 Romania about Patriarch Justinian, and concludes that a deeper understanding of the history of ROC under early communism is possible only if Justinian is seen as both a collaborator with the regime and a defender of the ROC."
