October 14, 2013 — Three Range Rover Diesel Hybrid prototypes have completed the ultimate engineering sign-off test by traversing 13 countries over 53 days from Solihull, UK, to Mumbai, India. The world’s first ever hybrid expedition along the Silk Trail and one of the boldest driving adventures ever pursued by Land Rover.\n\nHostile conditions on the route included asphalt roads riddled with vast and deep potholes, dusty desert trails in 43°C heat and numerous miles of mud and gravel tracks and cattle trails. In addition, river crossings, passes clinging to the edges of mountains partly blocked by rock falls, the thin air of extremely high altitudes and the dense and erratic traffic of Chinese and Indian roads all added to the test of man and machine.\n\nThe Silk Trail 2013 expedition was the final validation test for the Range Rover Hybrid before it is signed-off for production. From the home of the Legend in Solihull, UK, it blazed a trail through France, Belgium, Germany, Poland, Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, China (including Tibet), Nepal and India. For much of this distance the expedition followed the legendary Silk Road trading routes that first connected Asia with Europe more than 2,500 years ago. Overnight halts were made in hotels, hostels and tents at many of the same staging posts visited all those years ago by Silk Road merchants, missionaries and mercenaries.\n\nWhere the north and south Silk Roads split, near the remote city of Kashgar in north-western China, the expedition pioneered a mountainous route never previously completed by a vehicle from outside the country and never previously seen in its entirety by any westerner - the Xinjiang-Tibet highway, which put the new Range Rover Hybrid through its paces at heights of over 5,300 metres above sea level.\n\nSeven consecutive days were spent at altitudes between 11,000 and 17,648 feet (3,350 and 5,379 metres). At such great heights, oxygen content in the air is reduced from the 21 percent found at sea-level to as little as 10 percent, making movement more difficult for humans and internal combustion engines. The Range Rovers continued to make good progress, benefitting from the electric motor’s instant torque at 0 rpm and despite being laden with heavy loads including luggage, camping gear, food, medical equipment, and aerodynamically-unfriendly roof-racks carrying spare wheels, tyres and jerry cans of fuel.\n\nNegotiating tracks so sticky with mud that they were impassable to other types of vehicle, the Range Rover hybrid’s engine combination - with a 35kW electric motor supporting the TDV6 3.0 litre turbo-diesel engine - returned excellent fuel consumption for a vehicle so spacious and powerful. Throughout the epic journey the Range Rover Hybrids typically returned 36 to 37 mpg.\n\nLand Rover development engineers closely monitored data loggers fitted to each car, sending back more than 300 gigabytes of detailed technical records to their engineering team at Gaydon in the UK. The purpose of the expedition was not to test the reliability of mechanical components, which are already proven, but to fine-tune the calibration of engine and transmission software to ensure perfectly seamless performance in all terrains and extreme temperatures and altitudes. Technical setbacks reflected the roughness of the road surfaces: 15 punctures among the expedition’s three Range Rover Hybrid and four support vehicles, four wheels damaged by deep potholes, and four windscreens cracked by stones thrown-up on loose surfaces.\n\nPeter Richings, Jaguar Land Rover Hybrids and Electrification Director who took part in the final leg from Jaipur to Mumbai commented: “The world’s first diesel hybrid expedition along the Silk Trail pioneered an ambitious route across Europe and Asia that would have been impassable to most other types of vehicle - but no matter how hostile the conditions, the Range Rover Hybrid prototypes took it all in their stride.\n\n“In developing the hybrid-powered Range Rover, our objective was to gain hybrid’s fuel economy and carbon emissions advantages without compromising the Range Rover’s go-anywhere capabilities, its cabin space or its refinement. The success of this remarkable expedition clearly demonstrates we have achieved that.”\n\n|GlobalGiants.Com|\n\nEdited & Posted by the Editor | 4:11 AM | View the original post\n\nOctober 10, 2013\n\nVOLKSWAGEN ANNOUNCES LAUNCH OF XL1, \"THE WORLD’S MOST EFFICIENT PRODUCTION CAR\"\n\nThe Volkswagen XL1, “the most fuel-efficient and aerodynamic production car in the world”, made its U.S. debut at the 23rd Annual Society of Environmental Journalists Conference at the Chattanooga Convention Center.\n\nThe XL1 offers an estimated European combined fuel consumption rating of 261 mpg and can cover up to 32 miles as a zero-emissions vehicle in all-electric mode. The XL1 also has a top speed of 99 mph and can accelerate from 0 to 62 mph in 12.7 seconds.\n\n“The XL1 offers a glimpse into Volkswagen’s present and future eco-mobility capabilities, and highlights the ultimate successes of ‘Thinking Blue’,” said Oliver Schmidt, General Manager of the Engineering and Environmental Office (EEO), Volkswagen Group of America, Inc. “Volkswagen is proud to debut this ultra-fuel-efficient vehicle before the Society of Environmental Journalists, a group that shares in our commitment to environmental stewardship.”\n\n“The XL1 is an automotive standout that follows pure sports-car design principles: light weight (1753 pounds), exceptional aerodynamics (Cd 0.19), and a low center of gravity. This super-efficient Volkswagen has the ability to cruise down the road at a constant 62 mph while using just 8.4 PS (6.2kW) horsepower. In all-electric mode, the XL1 requires less than 0.1 kWh to cover more than a kilometer,” the company explained. “The XL1 will look spectacular going down the highway — a car of the future, built for today.”\n\n|GlobalGiants.Com|\n\nEdited & Posted by the Editor | 11:35 AM | View the original post\n\nOctober 8, 2013\n\n76 COUNTRIES IN COMPETITION FOR 2013 FOREIGN LANGUAGE FILM OSCAR\n\nPhoto: The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences celebrates the year 1912 and its developmental contributions to motion pictures with a program of selected films in “A Century Ago: The Films of 1912” at the San Rafael Film Center in San Rafael, CA.

But much additional research is needed to identify the systems, architectures and process technologies to support a new computing model that enables systems and people to work together across any domain of expertise.”\n\nThe research initiative was announced at a colloquium held at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center attended by nearly 200 leading academics, IBM clients and IBM researchers to begin a dialog that deepens the understanding of cognitive systems and identifies additional areas of research to pursue. These initial university collaborators will help lay the foundation for a Cognitive Systems Institute that IBM envisions will comprise universities, research institutes and IBM clients.\n\nThe initial research topics for exploration announced today are:\n\nMIT - How socio-technical tools and applications can boost the collective performance of moderate-sized groups of humans engaged in collaborative tasks such as decision making.\n\nRPI - How advances in processing power, data availability, and algorithmic techniques can enable the practical application of a variety of artificial intelligence techniques.\n\nCMU - How systems should be architected to support intelligent, natural interaction with all kinds of information in support of complex human tasks.\n\nNYU - How deep learning is impacting many areas of science where automated pattern recognition is essential.\n\n“I believe that cognitive systems technologies will make it possible to connect people and computers in new ways so that—collectively—they can act more intelligently than any person, group, or computer has ever done before,” said Thomas Malone, Director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence and the Patrick J. McGovern Professor of Management, MIT Sloan School of Management. “I am excited to be working with IBM and these other universities to understand better how to harness these new forms of collective intelligence.”\n\n“With the explosion of information and the advances in semantic data tools, we are excited to participate in this collaboration to bring the best of human and computing capabilities together in this new era of cognitive systems,” said Selmer Bringsjord, Professor and Head of the Department of Cognitive Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.\n\n“The cost-effective creation of cognitive systems for complex analytic tasks will require fundamental advances in the rapid construction, optimization, and constant adaptation of large ensembles of analytic components. Personalized information agents will rapidly adapt and optimize their task performance based on direct interaction with the end user. I am excited that CMU will be teaming with IBM, MIT, RPI and NYU to explore the future of software architecture for cognitive systems,” said Eric Nyberg, Professor at the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\n“NYU’s research into neural networks has the potential to revolutionize how we think about machines and the role they play in our everyday lives. NYU has a long history of helping create some of the work’s most important technological breakthroughs, so we are honored to be among the universities collaborating on this research initiative into cognitive computing systems,” said Paul Horn, Senior Vice Provost for Research at New York University. “As a research university at the forefront of technology and innovation, we look forward to working with IBM and our fellow institutions to promote basic research into the next era of computing.”\n\n|GlobalGiants.Com|\n\n“If I have done the public any service, it is due to my patient thought.”\n\n— Isaac Newton.\n\nEdited & Posted by the Editor | 1:10 PM | View the original post"
