12:00 The Katyn Massacre

Palais E

Directed by: Maciej Sienski, Poland, 1991, 41', Historical Documentary

In 1940 in the forests near Katyn, the NKVD, acting on Stalin's orders, executed Polish army officers held captive at camp Kozielsk. Soviet authorities accused the Nazis of this crime; this was the official version of the story that lasted until the end of communism in Poland as well. The Polish communist government did everything to ensure that the word "Katyn" is erased from the national memory. Maciej Sienski's documentary shows not only the massacre itself, but also the historical context in which it happened. He shares with the audience the truth about the feelings of political abandonment of the Polish officers.
