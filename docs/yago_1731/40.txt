Robin Wright has said that her marriage to Sean Penn helped her greatly in her new relationship with Ben Foster.

The House of Cards actress told Vanity Fair that the lessons she learnt from her marriage to Penn were ones she had to learn for future relationships.

"I believe we were together not only to have our beautiful children but to learn how to love â€¦ for the next time around, the right way," the 48-year-old said.

Wright said the relationship had made her re-evaluate what she looks for in a partner.

"What I'm looking for in people now is kindness," she said.

Wright and Penn divorced in 2010 after 14 years of marriage.

It was the third time the couple had entered divorce proceedings to end their on-again off-again relationship.

They began the process in 2007, and again in 2009, before deciding to stay together both times.

The pair, who began dating shortly after Penn's divorce from Madonna, have two children: Dylan, 23, and Hopper, 21.

Whatever Wright learnt from the experience, it seems to be working.

Despite rumours that Wright had split with current boyfriend Foster, 34, late last year, it appears the pair are definitely still together.

"I've never been happier in my life than I am today," Foster told Vanity Fair.

"Perhaps it's not ladylike [to say], but I've never laughed more, read more, or come more than with Ben. He inspires me to be the best of myself.
