        "text": "Sean Penn has officially confirmed that he's once again a married man.\n\nOn Monday's episode of Late Night with Seth Meyers, the talk show host asked, “There are reports that you recently got married, is this true?” to which Penn replied by raising his left hand in front of the camera to show off his new wedding band.\n\n“We did a COVID wedding,” the actor explained. “By that I mean it was a county commissioner on Zoom, we were at the house, my two children and her brother, and we did it that way.”\n\nPenn and new wife Leila George, the 28-year-old daughter of Vincent D'Onofrio, have been dating for the last two years. Rumors they had secretly tied the knot began last Friday when philanthropist Irena Medavoy posted a since-deleted Instagram congratulating the pair. She wrote in the caption, “We are so happy for @leilageorge #seanpenn getting married. We love you. We are over the moon to [see you] find your soulmate true partner. You are meant to be together. God Bless you both and the family you have joined. Introducing the Penn’s #marriage.”\n\nThis is the 59-year-old actor's third marriage. His first was to Madonna from 1985 to 1989. His second, from 1996 to 2010, was to Robin Wright with whom he shares two children, 29-year-old Dylan and 26-year-old Hopper.\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\n\n— Did Billionaire Tobacco Heiress Doris Duke Get Away With Murder?\n\n— The Porn Industry’s Biggest Scandal—And Mystery\n\n— After a Year in Hiding, Ghislaine Maxwell Finally Faces Justice\n\n— Inside the Other Harry and Meghan Book by Longtime Royal Irritant Lady Colin Campbell\n\n— From Tyga to Charli D’Amelio, TikTok Stars Are Having a Blast (at Home)\n\n— The 21 Best Books for Tolerating 2020 (So Far)\n\n— From the Archive: The Mystery of Doris Duke’s Final Years\n\nLooking for more?
