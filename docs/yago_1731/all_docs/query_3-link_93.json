        "text": "His friendship with Hunter Biden: He said the two met in 2022 when Penn gave a speech in honor of U2 at the Kennedy Center Honors. He had read an interview with Hunter, the first âsince the chips were rolling down, and I was really taken with him and I told him.â Then last fall, after a screening of his Ukraine film with big shots on Capitol Hill, Penn had dinner with his friend Representative Eric Swalwell of California, who suggested he look up Hunter in Malibu. âI had no idea he lived down here,â said Penn, adding dryly: âI thought he was off in some judicial-focused place that we see on TV.â He called Hunter âa very, very insightful guy.â\n\nHe went to the White House state dinner for President William Ruto of Kenya last month. âHunter invited me,â Penn saidâ¦âI left the president alone because there were opportunities for that when everyone is not tapping his shoulder.” He thinks Biden should âtake it slowâ in the campaign, leaning into an elder statesman role, doing fireside-chat kind of talks, not getting into nasty spats with Trump but giving the nation a sense that red and blue can be united. Of Trump, he said dismissively: âHeâs shameful as an art and as a way of life.â\n\nHe stopped acting for a while because he was disillusioned with Hollywood. âI went 15 years miserable on sets. âMilkâ was the last time I had a good time.â\n\nWhether he thinks he could play a gay character today: âNo. It could not happen in a time like this. Itâs a time of tremendous overreach. Itâs a timid and artless policy toward the human imagination.â\n\nIt sounds like he is just burned out: âI feel like an actor who is playing a leading role and is a known actor and is being paid well has a leadership position on a film and youâve got to show up with energy and be a bodyguard for the director in some way. I was faking my way through that stuff and that was exhausting. Mostly what I thought was just, âWhat time is it? When are we going to get off?â I was sure it was done, but I didnât know how I was going to keep my house running or travel freely or things like that if I stopped.â\n\nHis thoughts on women: Pennâs own feeling is that some feminists still want to be feminine, and some men are âgetting feminized.â He thinks dating is getting more transactional for both men and women.\n\nThis is such a wild statement: He has experienced a fair number of relationships where âthe first thing I see in the morning are eyes wondering what Iâm going to do to make them happy that day. Rarely reciprocated.â\n\nWho is this?? âOn one of my marriages, the background noise of life was a âHousewives of Beverly Hillsâ or another thing called âLove Island.â Not even being in the room â Iâm not saying this to be cute â I was dying. I felt my heart, my brain shrinking. It was an assault.â\n\nHeâs not in a serious relationship now: He feels âthrilled every day. Iâm just free. If Iâm going to be in a relationship, Iâm still going to be free, or Iâm not going to be in it, and Iâm not going to be hurting. I donât sense Iâll have my heart broken by romance again.â\n\nHis marriage to Madonna: âI had a freaking SWAT team come into my house.â Madonna told the police she was worried because there were guns in the house. âI said: âIâm not coming out. Iâm going to finish my breakfast.â The next thing I knew, windows were being broken all around the house and they came in.â Then, he added, âthey had me in handcuffs.â\n\nHe never took a baseball bat to Madonna: He said he belatedly realized there were stories circulating that he had âtrussed her up like a turkey. I didnât know what âtrussed upâ meant, first.â He said he was dating one woman who confronted him the morning after âa lovely nightâ when he was on the back porch smoking a cigarette. âSheâs looking at me like I killed her dog,â he said, asking him âabout this hitting Madonna in the head with a baseball bat. I didnât know what the hell she was talking about. Now I think itâs fair to say that Iâm not the biggest guy in the world. But if I hit Mike Tyson in the head with a baseball bat, heâs going to the hospital.â"
