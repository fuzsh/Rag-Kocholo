        "text": "Sean Penn and Robin Wright have been photographed together for the first time in years.\n\nPenn and Wright, one of Hollywood's most famous on-again, off-again couples, were spotted traveling together at the Los Angeles International Airport over the weekend.\n\nIn photos obtained by Page Six, Penn was seen carrying a black backpack while rocking a casual beige T-shirt, cargo pants and a black jacket. He completed his getup with a pair of winter boots.\n\nWright was seen behind him carrying her own black suitcase, dressed in a black turtleneck sweatshirt, dark wash skinny jeans and brown boots. She also carried a white puffer jacket over her arm.\n\nPenn and Wright were married from 1996 to 2010. They haven't been seen together in public since 2017, according to E! News. It was not clear why they were traveling together.\n\nTheir sighting came nine months after the Oscar-winning actor finalized his divorce from Leila George after two years together, and four months after Wright filed for divorce from Clement Giraudet after four years of marriage.\n\nThe \"Forrest Gump\" star cited \"irreconcilable differences\" as the cause when she filed for divorce from the Saint Laurent executive, 38, in September 2022, according to the court documents obtained by TMZ. She listed their date of separation as July 31, 2022.\n\nThe \"House of Cards\" alum also reportedly said in her filing that \"all assets are his/her separate property\" as stated in their post-nuptial agreement and checked a box to block the court's ability to award spousal support to either of them.\n\nMeanwhile, Penn finalized his split from George, 30, in early 2022 after she filed to divorce him the year prior. They dated for four years before secretly tying the knot in a private wedding ceremony in July 2020.\n\nPenn blamed himself for their failed marriage, saying he \"f--ked up the marriage\" because he only saw his then-wife on a \"day-to-day basis.\"\n\n\"We were married technically for one year, but for five years, I was a very neglectful guy,\" Penn told Hollywood Authentic in April 2022.\n\nHe continued, \"[I] allowed myself to think that my place in so many other things was so important, and that included my place in being totally depressed and driven to alcohol and Ambien at 11 o'clock in the morning, by watching the news, by watching the Trump era, by watching it and just despairing.\"\n\nPenn was previously married to Madonna from 1985 to 1989. He began dating Wright shortly afterward.\n\nWright gave birth to their daughter, Dylan, in 1991 and their son, Hopper Jack, in 1993. They tied the knot in 1996 but split 14 years later.\n\n\"Marriage ain't easy, but it's great most of the time,\" Penn told Entertainment Weekly in 1997. \"I love Robin. I've always loved her.\""
