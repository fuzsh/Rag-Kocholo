        "text": "Sean Penn is setting the record straight.\n\nThe Mystic River star recently addressed the long withstanding rumors that he physically assaulted his ex-wife Madonna—to whom he was married from 1985 to 1989—with a baseball bat, noting it has followed him around for years.\n\nIn fact, the Oscar winner described a date who asked him point blank about the supposed incident, telling The New York Times, \"She's looking at me like I killed her dog.\"\n\nIn addition to denying the rumors, Sean also emphasized how they initially caught him off guard.\n\n\"I didn't know what the hell she was talking about,\" Sean explained in the interview published June 24. \"I think it's fair to say that I'm not the biggest guy in the world. But if I hit Mike Tyson in the head with a baseball bat, he's going to the hospital.\""
