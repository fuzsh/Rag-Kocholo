        "text": "ACTOR Sean Penn has been married three times throughout his life and is most famously known for his marriage to Madonna from 1985 to 1989.\n\nHis most recent marriage was to Australian-American actress Leila George, however, on October 15, 2021, the couple announced that they were divorcing.\n\nWho is Sean Penn's ex-wife?\n\nBorn March 20, 1992, George, 30, was married to Penn, 61, since 2020.\n\nGeorge is known as an actress and is most famously recognized for her roles in Mortal Engines, Animal Kingdom, and The Kid.\n\nPrior to her start in the acting world, George studied at the Sydney Film School.\n\nGeorge can also be spotted in the 2017 movie, The Long Home.\n\nDespite coming from a famous family, not much additional information is available on George.\n\nWho are Leila George's parents?\n\nWhile George's acting career might still be taking off, she is the daughter of famous American actor, director and producer, Vincent Philip D'Onofrio and Italian-Australian actress Greta Scacchi.\n\nD'Onofrio, 62, started acting in 1983 and is the winner of two Saturn Awards.\n\nHe is most famously known for his roles in Men in Black, The Cell, Full Metal Jacket, and Ed Wood and from 2001 to 2011, D'Onofrio also played the role of Detective Robert Goren in Law & Order: Criminal Intent.\n\nGeorge's mother, Scacchi, 62, has also been acting since the early 1980s and is most famously known for her roles in The Player, Emma, Looking for Alibrandi, and Rasputin.\n\nLike her husband, Scacchi is still very much active and just finished filming three movies in 2021 and is currently filming the TV mini series, Darby and Joan, which is scheduled to be released in 2022.\n\nIt was revealed that growing up in the entertainment industry helped George realize that it's what she wanted to do.\n\n\"Growing up, I'd sit on my mum's sets or my dad's sets for hours and hours and not get bored,\" she told W Magazine in 2019. \"That's always where I wanted to be.\"\n\nWhen did Leila George and Sean Penn split?\n\nThe Australian actress filed divorce documents from Penn on October 15, 2021, in Los Angeles County Superior Court, according to TMZ.\n\nPrior to their marriage, the happy couple was not always so happy.\n\nIn August 2020, a source revealed to People that Penn had to win George back before he could ever ask for her hand in marriage.\n\nWhile the couple have been romantically linked since 2016, over the course of four years, they had an on and off relationship.\n\n\"Leila has been in Sean’s life for a while. They got together and then they broke up, and Sean won her back,\" the source revealed. \"He realized he had made a mistake and when he felt he might lose her, he worked hard to get her back.\"\n\nThe source also revealed that the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic was when the two decided to work on their relationship but it is unknown what mistake Penn made.\n\n\"They got back together during COVID and became really close and got engaged a few months ago, early during quarantine,\" the source continued.\n\nThe pair got married in July of 2020.\n\nWhat has Penn said about the divorce?\n\nBefore the divorce was finalized on April 22, 2022, just a little over a year after the two were married, Penn shared some deep thoughts with the Hollywood Authentic.\n\nIn an interview published at the beginning of April, Penn opened up about his feelings towards George and the reason behind their then-impending divorce.\n\n\"There’s a woman who I’m so in love with, Leila George, who I only see on a day-to-day basis now, because I f**ked up the marriage,\" said Penn.\n\n\"...I was a very neglectful guy. I was not a f**king cheat or any of that obvious sh*t, but I allowed myself to think that my place in so many other things was so important, and that included my place in being totally depressed and driven to alcohol and Ambien at 11 o’clock in the morning, by watching the news, by watching the Trump era, by watching it and just despairing.\"\n\nPenn went on to describe how his late-night, and early morning, routine of sleeping on the couch, binge-watching the news and drinking was something, women don't 'love.'\n\n\"I don’t know what’s going to happen with us, but I know that this is my best friend in the world and definitely the most influential, inspiring person, outside of my own blood, that anybody could ask to have in their life,\" said Penn just weeks before the split was made official by a judge.\n\n\"So, now, when I wash the dishes, I don’t answer my phone. If I’m with my wife for a day, I don’t have my phone on, even though I’m juggling a lot of things...\n\n\"Although I still need vodka and an Ambien to get to sleep at night, I don’t use them to hide from the world now like I used to.\n\n\"I hope I’ve learned not to let everything overlap with me anymore. And that I really put priority in my family, in my wife, in my life, in ways that I can plan and control. That’s the theory, anyway,\" Penn concluded."
