        "text": "Robin Wright's recent Golden Globe win for her role in \"House of Cards\" isn't the only thing she's been celebrating as of late: she's also newly engaged to fiancé Ben Foster.\n\nIn a new interview with The Telegraph, the 47-year-old actress said Foster’s proposal after two years of dating seemed like \"such a shock,\" but that ultimately they \"felt married anyway. We’ve been together ever since the first date.”\n\nWright and Foster, 33, met while co-starring in the 2011 crime drama \"Rampart,\" roughly a year after she divorced long-time love Sean Penn. Foster invited Wright to a poetry recital at the premiere of \"Rampart\" -- something she said was a major first.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I’d never, ever been asked out on a date before,” she told the Telegraph. “Never. I was frickin’ married my whole life, and even before that I hadn’t been asked out.”\n\nIt's slightly hard to believe, but Wright has been married for much of her life. Before her marriage to Penn, the Golden Globe winner was married to Dane Witherspoon for two years in the 1980s. She told the Telegraph that her split from Penn after 14 years of marriage and two children together was \"devastating.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Divorce in and of itself, and with children, is devastating,\" she said. \"Worse than that. One of the reasons why we got back together and broke up so much was trying to keep the family together. If you've got kids, it's a family, and you try again, and you try again. We did that for a long time.\"\n\nToday their relationship is much different: \"Sean sees the kids,\" Wright said. \"They see him. They see me. We've all got our own lives.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPenn's own life includes actress Charlize Theron, whom he recently confirmed he's dating."
