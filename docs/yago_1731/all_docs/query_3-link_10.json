Eventually, they realize that.\n\nFame, wealth and celebrity are a powerful aphrodisiac for women. Penn has had all those things for most of his career or adult life, so of course he keeps punching above his weight when it comes to the opposite sex. Do you think Marilyn Manson (as an example)would have ever gotten some of the women he's been (Evan Rachel Wood, Rose McGowan etc) with to look twice at him if he wasn't a rich and famous rock star?\n\nPost by quetee on\n\nEvery relationship Sean Penn is involved is baffling, because literally every woman he's been attached to could do much better.

People will pretend they are straight, gay, into older people just to get a piece of the power and fame.\n\nPost by HELENA MARIA on\n\nEvery relationship Sean Penn is involved is baffling, because literally every woman he's been attached to could do much better.

What made him 'hot ' to women was the \"bad boy\" attitude, the fame, wealth and celebrity and perceived talent. It's a powerful cocktail. On aesthetic appeal alone, if Penn was just some regular dude working a 9 to 5, he'd probably never get close to many of the women he's dated or married on his looks alone.\n\nPost by pacinoyes on\n\nThis thread is also a fncking trainwreck - first of all - why is this in \"Acting\" anyway?\n\nSecond - another dump on Sean Penn thread - all he did this time was get served divorce papers - how is this \"embarassing like Johnny Depp\" for him? - how is his kid being a dumbass something that reflects on Sean Penn at all - what is that \"racist by association\" shit?\n\nGTFO\n\nThird - yes, fame, money, wealth can help you get a lot of women sure........ but do you people have like, friends / acquaitances in real life and shit - because I can tell you I have known a lot of dudes who were were scumbags (and I'm being nice), not great looking at all, so broke they couldn't even pay attention, and who somehow ALWAYS had a good looking girl on their arm because they were ............well. they were \"projects\"..........or they needed \"taking care of\" ..........or the girl had some problems or her own and wanted to piss off daddy or something (that \"bad boy\" schtick works for \"regular 9 to 5\" guys too)........or they were good in bed.\n\nUsually when people say sh it like - \"Sean Penn would never get Leila George if he wasn't famous and rich\" - they mean \"If I was rich and famous I could have Leila George\"\n\nNot really ..........you couldn't ....\n\nPost by HELENA MARIA on\n\nThis thread is also a fncking trainwreck - first of all - why is this in \"Acting\" anyway?\n\nSecond - another dump on Sean Penn thread - all he did this time was get served divorce papers - how is this \"embarassing like Johnny Depp\" for him?
