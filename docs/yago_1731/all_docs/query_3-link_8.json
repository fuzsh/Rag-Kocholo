        "text": "Sean Penn and his new girlfriend, Olga Korotyayeva, were spotted getting handsy during their romantic Italian getaway.\n\nIn photos taken Wednesday, the “I Am Sam” actor, 62, was snapped wrapping his arms around the “Blast” actress, 43, as they shared a kiss.\n\nIn another picture, Korotyayeva placed her hand on Penn’s butt as they walked through the streets of Rome during their shopping sprees at Bulgari and Tiffany & Co.\n\nThe couple kept it casual for the outing, with Penn wearing a black T-shirt, jeans, a baseball cap and white sneakers.\n\nThe Ukrainian actress also wore jeans with a white tank top and white sneakers.\n\nThe pair’s Italian vacation comes more than a week after they were spotted spending time together during Memorial Day weekend in Malibu, Calif.\n\nPenn and Korotyayeva dressed to the nines as they hit the celebrity hotspot Nobu for a dinner date. The “Mystic River” star wore a classic suit and tie, while his girlfriend looked stunning in a black and silver dress with long sleeves and a high slit.\n\nThe twosome waited at the valet before getting into the actor’s black luxury sedan.\n\nPenn’s new romance comes nearly two years after his ex-wife Leila George filed for divorce after one year of marriage.\n\nThe Oscar winner previously spoke out about he was to blame for the demise of his third marriage.\n\n“There’s a woman who I’m so in love with, Leila George, who I only see on a day-to-day basis now, because I f–ked up the marriage,” he told Hollywood Authentic in April 2022.\n\nPenn added, “We were married technically for one year, but for five years, I was a very neglectful guy.”\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nThough the “Fast Times at Ridgemont High” star claimed he was never unfaithful to the Australian actress, 31, or “any of that obvious s–t,” he did admit that he put other things — like alcohol — before their relationship.\n\n“[I] allowed myself to think that my place in so many other things was so important, and that included my place in being totally depressed and driven to alcohol and Ambien at 11 o’clock in the morning, by watching the news, by watching the Trump era, by watching it and just despairing,” he said at the time.\n\nThat same month, George and Penn’s divorce was finalized."
