        "text": "Sean Penn’s wife, Leila George, has filed for divorce.\n\nThe 61-year-old actor tied the knot with the 28-year-old beauty on July 30 last year, and just over one year into their marriage, Leila has now filed to legally end their relationship.\n\nAccording to TMZ, the Australian actress — who is the daughter of actors Vincent D'Onofrio and Greta Scacchi — filed divorce papers on Friday (Oct 15) in Los Angeles County Superior Court.\n\nAs of the time of writing, it’s unknown what Leila has cited as the reason for her divorce filing.\n\nThe news comes after it was recently claimed Sean had to “win back” Leila after their romance began as an on/off relationship in 2016 and continued for several years until the last time they went their separate ways, which prompted the Oscar-winning actor to “work hard” on fixing their bond.\n\nA source said: Leila has been in Sean's life for a while. They got together and then they broke up, and Sean won her back.\n\nHe realised he had made a mistake and when he felt he might lose her, he worked hard to get her back.\n\nThe couple isolated together amid the coronavirus pandemic, and it was claimed that helped strengthen their relationship and made them realise their future together.\n\nThe insider added: They got back together during COVID and became really close and got engaged a few months ago, early during quarantine.\n\nSean — who has children Dylan, 29, and Hopper, 26, with ex-wife Robin Wright, and was also previously married to Madonna — revealed on The Late Night with Seth Meyers that he and Leila married over Zoom, with the officiant carrying out proceedings via video link.\n\nHe said: We did a COVID wedding. By that, I mean it was a county commissioner on Zoom and we were at the house with my two children and her brother, and we did it that way. — BANG SHOWBIZ\n\nPhoto: TPG News/Click Photos"
