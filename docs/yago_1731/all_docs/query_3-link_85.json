The couple filed for divorce in October 2021, after tying the knot in July 2020, but they dated for four years prior to the marriage. The 61-year-old actor opened up in a recent interview with Hollywood Authentic and shared intimate details of why they split. “I f–ked up the marriage. We were married technically for one year, but for five years, I was a very neglectful guy,” Sean said."
