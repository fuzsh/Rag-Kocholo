        "text": "Sean Penn is getting divorced for a third time after being married to his 29-year-old wife for little more than a year.\n\nThe Hollywood star, 61, tied the knot with Australian actress Leila George in July 2020 in a low key ceremony at their family home during lockdown.\n\nThe couple had been dating for four years after meeting in 2016. They don’t have any children together.\n\nIt is unclear what has caused the split and no further details have been released at this time.\n\nBut it was Leila who filed divorce papers in a Los Angeles County Superior Court, TMZ reports.\n\nThe divorce will be Oscar winner Sean’s third. He was previously married to Forrest Gump and House of Cards star Robin Wright for 14 years until 2010.\n\nSean and Robin, 55, share two children, 30-year-old Dylan and 27-year-old Hopper. Both their kids work as models and actors.\n\nBefore Robin, Sean was married to pop queen Madonna from 1985 to 1989.\n\nSean confirmed he had married third wife Leila in a civil ceremony over Zoom last summer.\n\nFlashing his wedding ring during an appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers he said: “We did a Covid wedding.\n\n“By that I mean it was a county commissioner on Zoom and we were at the house with my two children and her brother, and we did it that way.”\n\nThe pair met on the set of movie The Last Face – which also starred Sean’s ex Charlize Theron - and it was said to be love at first sight.\n\nStill in her 20s, Leila is only a few months younger than Sean’s daughter Dylan.\n\nThe last time the couple were spotted out in public together was in August as they shopped for groceries in Malibu.\n\nBefore dating rising star Leila, who is best known for starring in Mortal Engines and The Kid, Sean was in a relationship with Charlize Theron.\n\nIt was rumoured the couple, who dated from 2013 to 2015, were engaged at one point.\n\nBut Charlize denies this was ever the case, telling US radio host Howard Stern: “We dated and then we didn’t date.\n\n“It was a relationship for sure. We were definitely exclusive. But it was barely a year.\n\n“We never moved in... I wasn’t going to marry him. It was nothing like that.”\n\nIn an interview with Esquire in 2012, Sean claimed that despite his marriages he never really felt he had been loved.\n\n“There is no shame in my saying that we all want to be loved by someone,” he said.\n\n“As I look back over my life in romance, I don’t feel I’ve ever had that.”\n\nIn 2016, Material Girl singer Madonna confessed she was still ‘in love’ with the actor despite their rocky marriage and joked she would remarry him if he paid $150,000 to her charity.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
