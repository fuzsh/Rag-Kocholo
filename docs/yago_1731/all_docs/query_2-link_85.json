        "text": "Jewel Kilcher / Occupation Musician / Age 46 / Relationship status Single / Best known for Her 1995 debut album, Pieces of You.\n\nMy Swiss paternal grandfather, Yule Kilcher, was somewhat of a philosopher who moved to Alaska from Europe before World War II. He had eight children with my grandmother, raising them in the wilderness. He also helped to draft Alaska’s state constitution and became a senator.\n\nMy maternal grandfather, Jasper Jude Jewel Carroll, was the 15th child in his family. His mother named him after all the precious stones that lined the road to heaven. That’s where my name comes from. He built his own planes, taught himself to fly, and once crashed into the side of a mountain during a snowstorm while drunk.\n\nHe got gangrene as a result and when he passed away, my grandmother was handed a baggy of cash that he had stored in his hollow artificial leg.\n\nMy dad, Atz, is very charismatic, a great singer and yodeller. Both of my parents practised music – we had a family show and sang in hotels.\n\nLoading\n\nMy mom, Lenedra, and Dad divorced when I was eight and Dad took over raising us. He had post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in Vietnam. He knew his childhood was bad when he went to war and found it calming; it tells you a lot about the stress levels in his household. Mom leaving triggered him to start drinking.\n\nIt was about this time that Dad and I started singing duets together. On stage, Dad wouldn’t write a set list but would read the crowd to determine the mood. It’s a skill I learnt and still use.\n\nDad is 72 now and a miracle of a human being. He wrote a memoir, Son of a Midnight Land, about his childhood and what it is like to overcome abuse. He is sober and happier today than he has ever been.\n\nMy brother Shane, two years older than me, is a great writer. He was always the dreamer, always lost in books. Another brother, Atz jnr, is two years younger than me and is a natural contrarian in a beautiful way. He is a musician. And I have a half-brother, Nikos, who’s eight years younger than me and also a gifted musician.\n\nWhen I was nine, I was singing in a bar when a man put a dime in my hands, wrapped my fingers around it and said, “You’re going be great to f… when you’re older.” I also remember walking out of a bar bathroom and hearing a man say, “Isn’t she hot?” I watched men drink their pain away while I performed and knew I never wanted to do that.\n\nMy first kiss happened in a hay barn. I felt compelled to kiss him but was terrified. I was in seventh grade.\n\nI was homeless at 18 and went to a hospital with a kidney infection that became sepsis, but was turned away because I didn’t have insurance. I was in my car throwing up when a doctor tapped on my window, gave me antibiotics and saved my life. He was one of the few men who never tried to leverage me.\n\nI secretly dated Sean Penn in 1995. He was a tremendous influence on me and believed in my art fiercely. He came along at an important time when I was struggling, with my record going nowhere. He remains a close friend.\n\nBob Dylan took me on tour in the mid-’90s, before I became popular. He was my mentor: he sent me books to read and music to listen to, and encouraged me to keep playing acoustic.\n\nLoading\n\nNeil Young also took me on tour in the mid-’90s and said, “Being a singer-songwriter is different. It’s not about writing hits, it’s about art.” He told me it was my obligation to follow my muse no matter where it took me.\n\nI was married to rodeo champion Ty Murray from 2008 to 2014 and we have a son, Kase Townes Murray, aged nine. Our relationship was fun and romantic, and although it didn’t work out I loved that Ty was of the land and that our son gets to have that in his life.\n\nI am not in a relationship right now but I am definitely interested. I find famous people generally quite cranky and hard to date and have learnt that when you’re a powerful woman who has her own money, men become incredibly insecure."
