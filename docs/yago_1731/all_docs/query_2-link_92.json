        "text": "Sean Penn’s wife Leila George has reportedly filed for divorce from the actor.\n\nThe pair are thought to have split a year after their wedding.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Leila filed divorce papers on Friday in Los Angeles County Superior Court.\n\nSean and Leila, who’s the daughter of actor Vincent D’Onofrio, tied the knot in July 2020, with the actor later confirming he had a ‘Covid wedding’.\n\nThe pair held the ceremony in secret with the public first finding out when a friend of the couple shared the news online.\n\nBut Sean, 61, opened up about his marriage to Leila, 29, during an appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers.\n\nHe flashed his wedding ring and stated: ‘Yeah, we did a Covid wedding. By that, I mean it was a county commissioner on Zoom and we were at the house, my two children and her brother, and we did it that way.’\n\nAnd the actor made it clear he was quite happy about the fact they had to keep the wedding minimal and say the vows at home via Zoom.\n\nHost Seth admitted that after having a ‘very large wedding’ himself, he thought the pandemic wedding ‘actually sounds pretty nice and low stress.’\n\nSean replied: ‘Let’s say there are socially liberating factors under Covid.’\n\nThe pair have been dating since 2016 and tied the knot after four years together.\n\nSean – who was also married to Madonna and Robin Wright – previously described himself as difficult to date.\n\nHe said: ‘Am I difficult? Yeah I think so. I will say I’m a person who feels and expresses energetically, I’ve misled people into thinking it’s all about me.’\n\nThe Milk actor went on: ‘I think the interview you’re talking about would be a lady named Leila George, she knows me better than I do on this level, that doesn’t mean I agree with her perceptions but I certainly find them fascinating…. She’s the gal in my life.’\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted reps for Sean Penn and Leila George for comment.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Sean Penn compares being unvaccinated to ‘pointing a gun in somebody’s face’"
