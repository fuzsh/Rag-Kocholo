        "text": "Single, and not ready to mingle.\n\nSean Penn said he’s “thrilled every day” to not be in a relationship — adding that he’s never going to have his “heart broken by romance again.”\n\nIt’s no secret that the Oscar winner, 63, has been unlucky in love so far.\n\nWith three failed marriages under his belt, the actor has also had his fair share of breakups in recent years.\n\n“I’m just free,” he told the New York Times. “If I’m going to be in a relationship, I’m still going to be free, or I’m not going to be in it.”\n\n“I’m not going to be hurting. I don’t sense I’ll have my heart broken by romance again,” he added.\n\nPenn added that “relationships don’t have to be dramatic or draining” — and he makes sure to avoid “unnecessary drama and visits from ‘the trauma gods.'”\n\nRecalling his past romances, Penn said “the first thing I see in the morning are eyes wondering what I’m going to do to make them happy that day,” adding that it was “rarely reciprocated.”\n\nThe “Mystic River” actor was last romantically linked to actress Nathalie Kelley, 39, in December.\n\nPrior to that, he kickstarted a romance with Olga Korotyayeva, 43, whom he dated for around 5 months.\n\nPenn was previously married to Australian actress Leila George, 33, from 2020 until she filed for divorce in October 2021.\n\nHe also dated Charlize Theron from late 2013 until the summer of 2015.\n\n“On one of my marriages, the background noise of life was the ‘[Real] Housewives of Beverly Hills’ or another thing called ‘Love Island,'” he told the Times.\n\n“Not even being in the room — I’m not saying this to be cute — I was dying. I felt my heart, my brain shrinking. It was an assault.”\n\nPenn was also married to eight-time Emmy nominee Robin Wright for 13 years, until their divorce in 2010.\n\nDuring their 21-year on/off romance, during which the pair called it quits a whopping four times, they welcomed daughter Dylan Frances and son Hopper Jack.\n\nAnd in 1985, Penn tied the knot with 7-time Grammy winner Madonna — however their marriage crumbled after just four years.\n\nStill, Penn notes that the pair are on very good terms.\n\n“It turns out it’s a lot quicker to repair a friendship after divorce if there are not kids involved,” he said.\n\n“It took Robin and I quite a while. There was a lot of drama. Much more important to repair it if there are kids involved, but no easy swing, right?”"
