        "text": "FORMER Hollywood power couple Sean Penn and Robin Wright are unlikely to be getting back together any time soon, a pal has claimed.\n\nThe pair, who divorced in 2010, sparked rumors of a rekindled romance after being pictured together twice in Los Angeles this month.\n\nBut a friend who knows the family dynamic says that Mystic River star Sean, 62, and House of Cards actress Robin, 56, face major stumbling blocks to be reunited.\n\nFor now, they are focussed on being there for their daughter Dylan, 31, and son Hopper, 29, as their showbiz careers begin to take off.\n\nBut the source believes that although Sean can’t quit Robin his ego stands in the way of full reconciliation.\n\nThe insider said: \"Sean and Robin are not reconciled but they're spending a lot of time together because their kids need them on the same page right now as their careers in the industry accelerate.\n\n“Plus, Robin knows that it makes Sean happy to be very involved in her and their kids' lives, but there are lines he can't and won't cross because Robin would shut him out forever.\n\n“It’s a constant ego battle with Sean, and it's a battle he has mostly with himself.\n\n“He would need to really change to get back on Robin’s wavelength because she is a very relaxed, calm, and lighthearted person at heart.\"\n\n'CAN'T QUIT HER'\n\nSean and Robin began dating in 1989 after his divorce from Madonna and tied the knot in 1996.\n\nAfter not being seen together for years the pair were pictured earlier this month at LAX airport before being spotted together again at the weekend.\n\nBoth ended relationships last year, with Sean finalizing his divorce from Leila George in April while Robin filed for divorce from Clément Giraudet in September.\n\nTheir daughter Dylan is an actress and model who has worked on campaigns for GAP and Ralph Lauren.\n\nMeanwhile, their son Hopper's Hollywood acting career is beginning to gather steam and has seen him perform alongside A-list stars such as Brad Pitt in the 2017 movie War Machine.\n\nThe source said: \"Even in her darkest moments Robin admits that the connection she shares with Sean transcends their marriage and even raising children together.\n\n“He's never going to be out of her life and under the right circumstances she would definitely take him back.\n\n“He can't quit her, and she knows it, and it's the reason his last marriage failed, the source speculated.\n\nThey added: “Even Sean's best friends say Robin is the love of Sean's life.\n\n“It's quite clear he can't make it work with anybody except her, and he doesn’t seem to even want to.\n\n“But Robin is her own woman and needs to be in charge in a relationship. The issue here is control.\n\n\"Even in the ten years since they were last together, Robin has changed - she's become a filmmaker herself, she went through the drama of Kevin Spacey leaving House of Cards and her becoming the show's lead in its final season, and she’s still in demand as an actress.\n\n“Robin is absolutely growing and developing as a person, and that's incredibly stimulating to Sean.\n\n“He's part of this journey she's on, but she's steering the ship, and that's how she likes it.”\n\n'NO EASY FIX'\n\nHowever, the friend doesn't rate Sean's chances of making things work with Robin long-term because of his tough-as-nails personality.\n\nThey believe that for now, the actor-director will have to settle for the relative peace of the couple's status as parents to two young adults.\n\nThe source said: \"They've decided, as they have in the past, to present a united front as co-parents to help their kids, especially their son Hopper, realize their dreams of acting and making movies and shows.\n\n“In that sense, they are on the same page but it's going to take a lot of movement to get Robin to see Sean in any other way.\n\n“There's not an easy fix for this like couples therapy.\n\n“He's been the same guy since he was nineteen, a rebel who is most comfortable when he's calling the shots.\n\n“Yes, Sean is an enlightened guy but his massive sense of pride means it's tough for him to give up control, or his huge sense of responsibility.\n\n“He doesn't have much left to prove as an artist or a humanitarian, but he still walks around all day like he has the weight of the world on his shoulders.\n\n“If he wants a successful relationship into his golden years he's going to have to let that go and lighten up, and that hasn't happened yet.”"
