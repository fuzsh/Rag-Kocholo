He said he married George, 28, at home Thursday due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. “We did a COVID wedding. By that, I mean it was a county commissioner on Zoom and we were at the house [with] my two children and her brother, and we did it that way,” Penn said.\n\nPenn was previously married to singer Madonna from 1985 to 1989 and to actress Robin Wright from 1996 to 2010. He has two children, daughter Dylan, 29, and son Hopper, 26, with Wright.\n\nPenn and George, the daughter of actor Vincent D’Onofrio, have been a couple since 2016.\n\nSean Penn marries Leila George\n\nVia rss.cnn.com\n\nSean Penn is a married man.\n\nEditorial credit: Featureflash Photo Agency / Shutterstock.com"
