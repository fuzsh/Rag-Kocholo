        "text": "We reported yesterday that Sean Penn filed for separation from Princess Buttercup herself, Robin Wright Penn. Now The Daily Mail is reporting that Penn has asked the California court to waive spousal support. The couple has two children – Hopper (who is 15 years old, and thus a minor) and Dylan (who is 18 years old, and whose custody will probably not be an issue). I would assume Sean then has no problems paying child support – but no spousal support! Sean isnât going to make sure that Princess Buttercup is financially secure!\n\nHe sparked rumours of a rift when he failed to thank his wife as he accepted an Oscar for his film Milk in February. And now Sean Penn has pulled the plug on his 13-year marriage â for the second time in 16 months.\n\nThe 48-year-old actor has filed for legal separation from Robin Wright, and asked a US court to waive spousal support.\n\nIf his request is granted, Penn would not be obliged to pay a yearly support allowance to his wife, who also has a lengthy film career of her own.\n\nThe court documents, filed in Marin County, near San Francisco, on Friday, cite âirreconcilable differencesâ as the reason for the split and request joint legal and physical custody of their 18-year-old daughter Dylan and 15-year-old son Hopper.\n\nThey also list the date of their separation as April 23rd â just four days before their 13th wedding anniversary.\n\nPenn, who won the Best Actor Oscar at this yearâs Academy Awards, first called time on his marriage to Miss Wright, 43, in December 2007. On that occasion he also gave irreconcilable differences as the reason for their break-up, but requested a full divorce rather than separation.\n\nAfter briefly being linked to 29-year-old model Petra Nemcova, the actor reconciled with his wife and withdrew the divorce petition. But on Friday, just 12 months after deciding to give their marriage another go, Penn filed for separation.\n\n[From The Daily Mail]\n\nYes, Robin Wright Penn is a talented actress with a career that can stand on its own, separate from Seanâs. But sheâs also taken loads of time off to raise their kids, in addition to taking smaller roles and independent films because the filming is shorter. Robin has always been a leading lady who masquerades as a character actress, and sheâs said ânoâ to projects to be supportive of Sean and their family. Itâs really screwed up that after some-odd twenty years together, Sean wouldnât want to make sure that Robin is taken care of. Is it just me, or does Sean get douchier by the minute?"
