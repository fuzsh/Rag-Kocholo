Veteran actor-director Sean Penn is divorcing his wife of 11 years, Robin Wright Penn, a report in a US magazine says.

US magazine People reported the news on its website on Friday, with a spokeswoman for the couple since confirming the split, without giving further details.

Penn, 47, who won a best actor Academy Award in 2004 for his anguished performance in Mystic River, began dating Robin Wright in the early 1990s.

The couple married in 1996 and have two children aged 14 and 16.

Wright, 41, has starred alongside her husband in several films including State of Grace, Hurlyburly and She's So Lovely.

"Marriage ain't easy, but it's great most of the time," Penn once told an interviewer.

"I love Robin. I've always loved her."

Penn's relationship with Wright Penn was his second marriage.

He was earlier married to pop icon Madonna from 1985 and 1989.

Penn is currently basking in critical acclaim for directing the film Into the Wild, which is nominated for four prizes at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, regarded as a key Oscars indicator.
