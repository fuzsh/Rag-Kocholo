Upon receipt of a grievance, the DRC will provide a written acknowledgement. The grievance process consists of an interview, which will informally address the disability related issue(s). If an informal resolution cannot be met, then a formal investigation will be conducted. A written notification of decision and an appeal process will be provided to the grievant. Alternative means of filing grievances, such as in-person interviews or an audio recording of the grievance, may be made available, as needed, to persons with disabilities upon request."
