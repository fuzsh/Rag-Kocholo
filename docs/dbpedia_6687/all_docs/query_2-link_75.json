        "text": "What is the Accessible Information Standard?\n\nThe Accessible Information Standard – known officially as SCCI1605 Accessible Information – is an ‘information standard’ for implementation by all organisations that provide NHS or adult social care.\n\nCompliance with information standards of this type is a mandatory requirement, including for NHS Trusts and GP practices. This is set out in section 250 of the Health and Social Care Act.\n\nThe Accessible Information Standard aims to ensure that people who have a disability or sensory loss receive information that they can access and understand, for example in large print, braille or via email, and professional communication support if they need it, for example from a British Sign Language interpreter.\n\nThe Standard requires organisations that provide NHS or adult social care to:\n\nAsk people if they have any information or communication needs, and find out how to meet their needs.\n\nRecord those needs clearly and in a set way.\n\nHighlight or flag the person’s file or notes so it is clear that they have information or communication needs and how to meet those needs.\n\nShare people’s information and communication needs with other providers of NHS and adult social care, when they have consent or permission to do so.\n\nTake steps to ensure that people receive information which they can access and understand, and receive communication support if they need it.\n\nWhich patients are affected by the Standard?\n\nThe Standard applies to patients and service users who have information and/or communication needs relating to a disability, impairment or sensory loss. It also applies to parents and carers of patients/service users who have such information and/or communication needs, where appropriate. Individuals most likely to be affected by the Standard include people who are blind or deaf, who have some hearing and/or visual loss, people who are deafblind and people with a learning disability. However, this list is not exhaustive.\n\nWhat impact will implementing the Standard have?\n\nSuccessful implementation of the Standard aims to lead to improved outcomes and experiences, and the provision of safer and more personalised care and services to those individuals who come within the Standard’s scope. It should lead to improvements in patient satisfaction and experience, patient safety, outcomes (for example to due to earlier diagnosis and treatment) and patients’ ability to self-care and adhere to clinical and medical advice.\n\nThe Standard is expected to benefit both patients and organisations, for example by reducing ‘did not attend’ (DNA) rates. For instance, the 2013 Action on Hearing Loss report, Access all Areas? included the statistic that 14% of people with hearing loss had missed an appointment due to not hearing their name being called in the waiting room. There are an estimated 10 million people with hearing loss across the UK, if 14% of them have missed an appointment due to not hearing their name being called, that is 1.4 million missed appointments.\n\nThe Standard should lead to some specific and significant benefits, including as follows:\n\nImproved health and wellbeing amongst patients in the key affected groups due to increased take-up of early intervention and prevention opportunities as part of national programmes (for example NHS Health Checks and ‘flu vaccination), ability to participate in decision-making and improved compliance with treatment / medical advice.\n\nImproved patient safety due to ability to understand and follow information regarding care and treatment, including medicines management and pre- and post-operative advice.\n\nMore appropriate use of services by patients in affected groups including increased use of primary/routine care and services and reduction in urgent and emergency care usage.\n\nImprovement in the effectiveness of clinical care due to addressing barriers to communication.\n\nImprovement in patient experience and satisfaction, and reduction in complaints and litigation associated with failure to provide accessible information and communication support.\n\nFurther information can be found here:\n\nwww.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/accessibleinfo/\n\nRead our Accessible Information Standard Policy here:\n\nAccessible Information Standard Policy\n\nIf you would like a letter or information in an alternative format (for example, large print or easy read) or if you need help with communicating with us (for example, because you use British Sign Language), please let us know. You can call us on 0151 546 2480 or email [email protected]\n\nData Protection – Your Personal Data is Safe\n\nWe would like to assure you that as a practice we take your personal data very seriously and we have certain processes in place to make sure your personal data is in safe hands at all times.\n\nAs a practice we must adhere to UK Data Protection laws, the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018, both pieces of legislation are around to make sure we look after your data. Where we do not follow any part of the Data Protection laws we are at risk of being investigated by the Information Commissioner’s Officer (ICO) on your behalf, and possibly being issued with a fine or warning. The ICO is an independent advisory body who report directly to Parliament and make sure your rights around your personal data are protected.\n\nTo help us keep on track and make sure we abide by these laws we complete something called the Data Security and Protection Toolkit (DSPT) that incorporates the laws. It helps us measure how we are doing and keeps us in line with the law and we are required to complete this annually.\n\nThere will be times when we have to share your personal data with external organisations / companies in order to provide you with the care you need. However, we only do this where we need to, where we have a legal reason to do so and when we are happy they will continue to safeguard your personal data. An example would be the Clinical IT system we use that holds your medical records, this is supplied by an IT company who will host your personal data to enable us to use the system.\n\nIn any event where we share your personal data we will conduct the necessary Data Protection checks with the external organisation. Like us, they are required by data protection law to provide us with relevant assurances that any personal data we share with them will remain secure. Under the UK GDPR they are required to provide us with documents to assure us and this will include contracts which must include UK GDPR clauses. If an organisation does not process your personal data in line with law they too will be investigated by the ICO.\n\nWe cannot share your personal data without a legal basis, which means we cannot give your personal data to anyone ‘just because’ they want it. The UK GDPR sets out 6 legal bases we can use, the most common one you would have heard of is ‘consent.’ Consent is not often used in healthcare and where we are using your personal data for direct care, it just would not work and the UK GDPR recognise this so we apply a legal basis called ‘public tasks.’ Public tasks covers the use of personal data where it relates to either being in the interest of the patients care or the public interest. This means that we do not need to ask for your consent, although we are obliged to be open and transparent with your personal data which we do via our Privacy Notice (see section ‘How We Use Your Information).\n\nWe certainly will not sell your personal data to anyone.\n\nWhen we share your personal data we need to abide by the UK GDPR principles, one of which is called ‘data minimisation’ – this means we can legally only share what is relevant and necessary for the task.\n\nFinally along with completing the DSPT (as mentioned above) where we have any data protection concerns or need advice we have a dedicated Information Governance team who are on hand to guide us through the do’s and don’ts.\n\nWe hope this information has provided you with assurance that we take the necessary steps to make sure your personal data is safe when in our care and that where we share your personal data we do so only if the law allows us to.\n\nHow information about you helps us to provide better care\n\nCare Data – Frequently Asked Questions\n\nNational Data Opt Out Policy\n\nType 1 Data Opt Out Form – Please complete and return to the practice\n\nYou can find out more on the NHS England Your Data Matters\n\nThe practice welcomes any compliments, concerns and complaints that patients may have. Patients may wish to complain verbally (face to face or telephone), in which case the complaint will be managed at this level if appropriate to do so. If a complaint cannot be resolved verbally, this must be made in writing to the Practice Manager via:\n\n– post addressed to:\n\nPractice Manager\n\nMillbrook Medical Centre\n\nSouthdene Primary Care Resource Centre\n\nBewley Drive\n\nL32 9PF\n\n– at Reception (written letter or complaints form)\n\n– email to [email protected]\n\nReception are able to provide patients with a Complaints Procedure Information Leaflet and Complaints Form at the desk.\n\nComplaints should be made within 12 months from the occurrence giving rise to the complaint, or 12 months from the time that the complainant becomes aware of the matter on which they wish to complain.\n\nOnce a complaint has been submitted, an acknowledgement letter of the complaint will be sent to the patient within 3 working days enclosing an information sheet and consent form.

Complaints are aimed to be resolved within 6 months.\n\nIn the case of a third party pursuing a complaint on behalf of the person affected we will request the following information:\n\nName and address of the person making the complaint\n\nName and either date of birth or address of the affected person\n\nContact details of the affected person so that we can contact them for confirmation that they consent to the third party acting on their behalf\n\nThe above information will be documented in the file pertaining to this complaint and confirmation will be issued to both the person making the complaint and the person affected.\n\nIn the case of a person who is unable to by reason of physical capacity or lacks capacity within the meaning of the Mental Capacity Act 2005, to make the complaint themselves, the organisation needs to be satisfied that the complaint is being made in the best interests of the person on whose behalf the complaint is made.\n\nYou can find our Complaints Procedure Information Leaflet, Complaints Form & Complaints Policy below:\n\nComplaints Procedure Information Leaflet\n\nComplaints Form\n\nComplaints Policy – Millbrook Medical Centre\n\nNHS England\n\nIf a complainant has concerns relating to a directly commissioned service by NHS England, then the first step is, where appropriate, for complaints and concerns to be resolved on the spot with their local service provider. This is called by NHS England ‘informal complaint resolution’ and is in line with the recommendations of the Complaints Regulations of 2009.\n\nAll patients have the right to make a complaint to NHS England should they feel an unsatisfactory outcome or failed resolution has arisen from their complaint to the practice.\n\nA complaint or concern can be received by mail, electronically or by telephone.\n\nBy telephone: 03003 11 22 33\n\nBy email: [email protected]\n\nBy post: NHS England, PO Box 16738, Redditch, B97 9PT\n\nThe complainant will be kept up to date with the progress of their complaint by NHS England staff members, in their preferred method of communication (e.g. by email, telephone or written letter). If the complainant is not satisfied with the outcome, then they will have the right to progress this further based on the complaints procedure that NHS England will provide to them during this process.\n\nAs part of the guidance on protecting data and personal information, if the complaint involves several organisations then the complainant will be asked for their permission to share or forward a complaint to another body, and further consent will be required to forward the complaint to any provider.\n\nIf you are not satisfied with your reply from NHS England then you have the right to approach the Parliamentary and Health Ombudsman who will undertake an independent investigation.

To arrange please email [email protected]\n\nThere is a new Central NHS Computer System called the Summary Care Record (SCR). It is an electronic record which contains information about the medicines you take, allergies you suffer from and any bad reactions to medicines you have had.\n\nWhy do I need a Summary Care Record?\n\nStoring information in one place makes it easier for healthcare staff to treat you in an emergency, or when your GP practice is closed.\n\nThis information could make a difference to how a doctor decides to care for you, for example which medicines they choose to prescribe for you.\n\nWho can see it?\n\nOnly healthcare staff involved in your care can see your Summary Care Record.\n\nHow do I know if I have one?\n\nOver half of the population of England now have a Summary Care Record. You can find out whether Summary Care Records have come to your area by looking at our interactive map or by asking your GP\n\nDo I have to have one?\n\nNo, it is not compulsory. If you choose to opt out of the scheme, then you will need to complete a form and bring it along to the surgery. You can use the form at the foot of this page.\n\nMore Information\n\nFor further information visit the NHS Care records website\n\nDownload the opt-out form\n\nThe Practice takes it very seriously if a member of staff is treated in an abusive or violent way.\n\nThe Practice supports the government’s ‘Zero Tolerance’ campaign for Health Service Staff. This states that GPs and their staff have a right to care for others without fear of being attacked or abused. To successfully provide these services a mutual respect between all the staff and patients has to be in place.\n\nOur Practice staff aim to be polite, helpful, and sensitive to all patients’ individual needs and circumstances. We would respectfully remind patients that very often staff could be confronted with a multitude of varying and sometimes difficult tasks and situations, all at the same time. The staff understand that ill patients do not always act in a reasonable manner and will take this into consideration when trying to deal with a misunderstanding or complaint.\n\nHowever, aggressive behaviour, be it violent or abusive, will not be tolerated and may result in you being removed from the Practice list and, in extreme cases, the Police being contacted.\n\nIn order for the practice to maintain good relations with our patients, the practice would like to ask all patients to read and take note of the occasional types of behaviour that would be found unacceptable:\n\nUsing bad language, swearing or threats towards practice staff\n\nAny physical violence towards any member of the Primary Health Care Team or other patients, such as pushing or shoving\n\nVerbal abuse towards the staff in any form including verbally insulting the staff\n\nRacial abuse and sexual harassment will not be tolerated within this practice\n\nPersistent or unrealistic demands that cause stress to staff will not be accepted. Requests will be met wherever possible and explanations given when they cannot\n\nCausing damage/stealing from the Practice’s premises, staff or patients\n\nObtaining drugs and/or medical services fraudulently\n\nWe ask you to treat your GPs and their staff courteously at all times"
