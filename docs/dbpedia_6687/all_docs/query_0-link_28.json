        "text": "Last week I returned from a whirlwind speaking tour for the Pakistan release of my book ‘Big Capital in an Unequal World: The Micropolitics of Wealth in Pakistan’. I spoke at public venues and universities across the country, and on a panel with Pakistan’s most eminent economist at the Karachi Literature Festival, Ishrat Husain, who told the audience my book complemented his own seminal work on the elite state by providing the micro insights to the macro trends he describes. I was asked difficult, important questions by researchers, students and ordinary Pakistanis about why Pakistan finds itself again at the brink of economic disaster with a revolving door of leaders, and I struggled to answer questions from so many people looking for a simple answer on what can be done. There are no simple answers. But I do hope my book has given regular people a chance to witness the informal processes through which power and wealth are acquired and guarded, and how this has created a system in which only the elite benefit. By witnessing and more fully understanding a problem, we are better placed to begin to change it. It was a huge and unexpected honour to find the book in such demand and have it be so well received. And it was a high point in my life seeing these ideas go out into the world, hopefully to be thought through and built on by a new generation of researchers, writers, commentators and policymakers."
