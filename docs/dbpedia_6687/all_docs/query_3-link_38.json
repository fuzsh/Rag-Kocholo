        "text": "In Sri Lanka, blind people read their Braille documents and books manually and if there was a system to read Braille documents and translate them to voice it would save more time and effort. Visually impaired face many difficulties in communicating with others. Also, the government has to pay more salary to Braille paper markings due to the lack of Braille expert teachers and lecturers. This project is carried out to overcome the above problems. Objectives: To design Sinhala Braille characters to speech audio signals system using Convolutional Neural Network. Methods: The system platform was divided mainly into three parts. Braille image was processed in a convenient way to read using methods in the OpenCV library. Mathematical formulas of the Convolutional Neural Network were used for the extraction and identification of the Braille characters. The Braille images were read and identified as relevant Sinhala letters by the system. Finally, audio signals were generated by extracted Braille letters with the help of an auto-correction algorithm and the Convolutional Neural Network. Results: The system is tested for multiple single-sided, scanned, printed, and typed Sinhala documents. Character translation is achieved up to 94% success rate. The conversion of recognized braille letters to speech is straightforward and performed letter by letter. The system is tested with different browsers and operating systems and it runs on any platform. Conclusion: Through this system, the visually impaired can interact with each other, and the communication obstacles between the regular and visually impaired are reduced. The system is useful for the government and education system. Through this proposed system, every teacher can mark the papers of blind students."
