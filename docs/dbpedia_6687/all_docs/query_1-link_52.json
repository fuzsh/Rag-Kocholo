The constitution recognises 22 different languages. Among all of these languages, Hindi is India's most widely spoken. The number of people who speak and understand Hindi is growing all across the world, and Hindi is now the world's third most spoken language. Hindi is not only the world's oldest language, but it is also the simplest and most prosperous. Its script is Devanagari, which is simple to learn. Because Hindi is a simple language to read, people from all over the world are drawn to it and want to study it Since 1950, when Hindi became an official language of India, it has been on a steady rise to become the country's \"most popular language.\"\n\nOn the occasion of Hindi's 150th anniversary, an annual ceremony is celebrated on September 11th. Every year, it is commemorated in cities and towns around the country, with a variety of public and private events held to mark the occasion. It is estimated that more than a billion people speak Hindi. Sanskrit has a significant influence on Hindi, which is written in the Devanagari script. Its standard form is based on the dialect of Khari Boli, which is spoken in the areas north and east of Delhi.\n\nAwadhi, Bagheli, Bhojpuri, Bundeli, Chhattisgarhi, Garhwali, Haryanawi, Kanauji, Kumayuni, Magahi, and Marwari are all classified dialects of Hindi, as are Awadhi, Bagheli, Bhojpuri, Bundeli, Chhattisgarhi, Garhwali, Haryanawi, Kanauji, Kumayuni, Maga These Hindi dialects, on the other hand, are more correctly classified as regional languages of the \"Hindi zone\" or \"belt,\" an area that roughly corresponds to northern India and extends south into Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThe majority of Hindi's terminology comes from Sanskrit, Persian, and Arabic. From the 16th century onwards, Hindi developed its own script, with the first publishing in Devanagari script taking place in 1822. With the exception of Gujarat and Maharashtra, Hindi is spoken as a second language in most parts of the country, as well as by a considerable portion of the population in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, and Uttar Pradesh, who also write in Hindi.\n\nIndia's second language, after English, is Hindi. Despite this, India's official position and recognition of the language are woefully inadequate. Even in Hindi-speaking states, Hindi is scarcely mentioned in school textbooks, despite the fact that English is the most popular foreign language in India. The majority of individuals are only familiar with the language because of movies and television. While English is taught in schools beginning in the first grade, Hindi is rarely taught in schools, particularly in the upper grades.\n\nImportance of Hindi\n\nMany writers wanted to make Hindi the official language of India. In the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan of 1919, Gandhiji requested that Hindi be declared the national language. Following independence, there was much debate on which language should be designated as the official language in 1949. Finally, the Indian Constituent Assembly determined that Hindi would be the Union's official language. Non-Hindi-speaking states, on the other hand, were outraged when Hindi was declared the national language and asked that English be given the same status. As a result, English had to be designated as the national language. As a result, both Hindi and English became India's national languages.\n\nHindi Diwas serves to remind us of our genuine identity and to bring the country's people together. Every year, Hindi Diwas is observed to emphasise the importance of Hindi and to promote it among all generations. In schools, colleges, and other places, Hindi Diwas is observed. The national holiday of Hindi Diwas is also observed. The President of the country honours persons who have excelled in any field related to the Hindi language on this day. Respect for Hindi and the use of the Hindi language is instilled in students. On this day, debate competitions, poetry competitions, storey competitions, speech competitions, and other activities are held in schools and universities, as well as other programmes. Teachers also deliver speeches in Hindi to underline the importance of the language."
