        "text": "We’re incredibly proud of our WIC team for receiving the 2024 GOLD Award for breastfeeding excellence!\n\nAbout WIC\n\nWIC is a Federal Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. Our mission is to provide supplemental foods, health care referrals, and nutrition education for low-income pregnant, breastfeeding, and non-breastfeeding postpartum women and infants and children up to age 5 who are found to be at nutritional risk. A balanced diet plays a big part in building a healthy body, but we know it can be hard to get the right kind of food for you and your family. Mary’s Center is an official site for the federally funded Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program. Mary’s Center connects you to the nutrition resources and services available in our community and puts healthy food at your family’s fingertips.\n\nWe encourage every eligible parent to apply for WIC benefits at Mary’s Center by calling (202) 232-6679 to make an in-person WIC application appointment. If you are approved as a Mary’s Center WIC participant, you will receive an eWIC card to purchase foods found on the DC WIC Food List. The food list can be downloaded in English and Spanish.\n\nAs an approved Mary’s Center WIC participant, you will also have access to:\n\nBreastfeeding Support\n\nWe can connect you with a breastfeeding peer counselor or a WIC breastfeeding consultant during the time the WIC Clinics are open. WIC participants who may need additional support are referred to a WIC lactation consultant at no cost.\n\nOnline Breastfeeding Support: The Pacify app allows you to video-call a doctor or nurse to ask questions about breastfeeding, infant feeding, and other infant or child health concerns. Video calls are free, can be done in English or Spanish, and are available 24 hours daily. In addition, participants have access to IBCLC services.\n\nBeautiful Beginnings Club (BBC): Supported by the DC Diaper Bank and First Shift Justice Project, the BBC provides new mothers and soon-to-be mothers breastfeeding support, education programs, and incentives. Classes are offered in English, Spanish, and Amharic.\n\nNutrition Counseling and Education\n\nWIC registered dietitians (RDs) are available to give nutrition counseling and education at no cost to WIC Participants. RDs will help you create a healthy meal plan with the WIC food package and your budget in mind, helping you and your family eat foods that support your specific health needs.\n\nSafe Sleep Classes\n\nWe offer free Safe Sleep classes in English, Spanish, and Amharic on the last Wednesday of every month, in partnership with DC Health. These classes provide pregnant mothers and other caregivers with cutting-edge practices to keep their infants safe while sleeping. All participants receive a safety-approved portable Cribette at no cost. To join the class, you must live in Washington, DC, and be pregnant with a delivery date within 30 days of the class or have an infant up to 12 months of age. Mary’s Center WIC program participation is a requirement.
