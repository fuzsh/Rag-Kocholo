        "text": "Nearly 161 million persons live with a disabling visual impairment, of whom 37 million are blind. About 90 % of them live in developing countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Pacific Regions. 9 out of 10 blind children in developing countries have no access to education. The system of embossed writing invented by Louis Braille gradually came to be accepted throughout the world as the fundamental form of written communication for blind individuals. This paper is concerned about the transliteration of English and Hindi text to Braille. Braille is a dotted pattern used by the blind people for reading and writing. In this paper we have discussed the possible ways to teach Blind people [11]..Braille has become the pre-eminent tactile alphabet. Its characters are six- dot cells, two wide by three tall. Any of\n\nCommunication gap establishes an aura of unwillingness of understanding the factor behind. Basically, this is one of the common agenda for the visually challenged people. In order to bridge this gap, a proper platform of learning for both the mass and the visually challenged for any native language is emphasized in this paper through Braille pattern. Braille, a code, well known to visually challenged as their mode of communication is now converted into normal text in Odia, Hindi, Telugu and English languages using Image segmentation as the base criteria with MATLAB as its simulation field so that every person can be able to easily decode the information being conveyed by these people. The algorithm makes the best use of segmentation, histogram analysis, pattern recognition, letter arrays, data base generation with testing in software and dumping in using Spartan 3e FPGA kit. This paper also elaborates on the reverse conversion of native languages and English to Braille making the paper to be more compatible. The processing speed with efficiency and accuracy defines the effective features of this paper as a successful approach in both software and hardware.\n\nBraille is a form of written language for visually impaired people, in which characters are represented by patterns of raised dots that are felt with the fingertips. The discerning person can not usually read Braille information without training. Therefore, many parents have difficulty in educating their blind children. Next, teachers that are engaged in special education have to depend on Braille translator when marking Braille papers or assignments. Therefore, this system proposed are aiming to help the people who have zero knowledge in Braille code to learn the code. This system will also have better prospects for application, shorten the time taken to translate and provide assistance to the beginners in learning Braille characters.\n\nBraille is a language of utmost importance for the upliftment of blind people. One of the problem with education of blind people is the unavailability of resources such as books etc. which are mostly in local languages being used by general people. Recently there have been lots of works done to automate the process of translating books in English, Arabic etc. into Braille as typing the whole book is very cumbersome. This paper is proposing an algorithm to convert any scanned handwritten document in HÄ±ndi to corresponding Braille. It uses Histogram of oriented gradients features of Hindi characters for matching in an SVM classifier. The scanned documents are first converted into a printable form and then transliterated to Braille using UTF-8 codes.\n\nBraille is the only system to visually impaired people for reading and writing. However, general people cannot read Braille. So, teachers and relatives find it hard to assist them with learning. Almost every major language has software solutions for this translation purpose. However, in Bengali there is an absence of this useful tool. Here, we propose Braille to Text Translator, which takes image of these tactile alphabets, and translates them to plain text. Image deterioration, scan-time page rotation, and braille dot deformation are the principal issues in this scheme. All of these challenges are directly checked using special image processing and geometric structure analysis. The technique yields 97.25% accuracy in recognizing Braille characters."
