        "text": "An Identification, Placement, and Review Committees (IPRC) is a formal committee that meets and decides if a student should be identified as an exceptional pupil and, if so, the placement that will best meet the student’s needs. An IPRC is comprised of at least three school board personnel, one of whom must be a principal or supervisory officer of the board.\n\nAn IPRC will:\n\ninvite you and your child/youth (if the student is 16 years of age or older) to attend the IPRC meeting;\n\nreview relevant information about the student;\n\ndescribe the student’s strengths and needs;\n\ndetermine whether the student should be identified as exceptional;\n\nidentify the area(s) of the student’s exceptionality or exceptionalities, according to the categories and definitions of exceptionality provided by the Ministry of Education;\n\ndetermine an appropriate placement for the student;\n\nprovide reasons for the placement if deciding for a placement in a special education class;\n\ndiscuss proposals for special education programs and services if requested by you, or the student age 16 or over; and\n\nreview the identification and placement at least once in each school year, unless you give written notice dispensing with the review.\n\nThe Education Act defines an exceptional pupil as a pupil whose behavioural, communicational, intellectual, physical and/or multiple exceptionalities are such that the student is considered to require a placement in a special education program. Students are identified according to these categories and definitions of exceptionalities provided by the Ministry of Education.\n\nResources\n\nMore information regarding this process is available in this Guide for Parents/Guardians to The Identification, Placement, and Review Committee (IPRC).\n\nWe have also produced a flyer called What is an IPRC? that is translated below.\n\nWhat is an IPRC – Arabic\n\nWhat is an IPRC – Simplified Chinese\n\nWhat is an IPRC – Somali\n\nWhat is an IPRC – Urdu\n\nWhat is an IPRC – Vietnamese\n\nPlease also explore the following videos, regarding What is an IPRC? and What happens at IPRC meetings?\n\nAn Individual Education Plan (IEP) is a written plan describing the appropriate special education program and/or special education services to be received by a student with special education needs.\n\nThe IEP is a working document. This individualized plan describes the goals that the school team has set for the child for the school year, as well as any special supports that are needed to help achieve those goals.\n\nThe IEP identifies the particular accommodations and/or modifications and/or alternative expectations that are needed to help the student achieve his or her learning expectations, given the student’s identified learning strengths and needs.\n\nThe IEP includes a transition plan for students who are fourteen years of age and older, unless the students are identified solely as gifted. The transition plan is designed to help students with special education needs make successful transitions from school to further education, work, and/or community living.\n\nThe IEP is not a description of everything that will be taught to the student, or all of the teaching strategies used in regular classroom instruction. It is a record of the specific knowledge and skills that will be assessed and evaluated for the purpose of reporting student achievement of the expectations listed in the IEP.\n\nThe development of an IEP is required for each student who has been identified as an exceptional pupil by an Identification, Placement and Review Committee (IPRC). An IEP may also be prepared for a student who is receiving a special education program and/or services but who has not been identified as exceptional through the IPRC process.\n\nParents are consulted in the development of a student’s IEP. Ongoing communication with your child’s school and school team is encouraged, as the most effective IEPs are those that are developed in partnership with parents.\n\nResources\n\nWe have produced resources to help families answer the question, What is an IEP? and is translated below.\n\nWhat is an IEP – Arabic\n\nWhat is an IEP – Simplified Chinese\n\nWhat is an IEP – Somali\n\nWhat is an IEP – Urdu\n\nWhat is an IEP – Vietnamese\n\nPlease also explore the following video resource, What is an IEP?\n\nHWDSB provides programs and services to support the learning outcomes for all students.
