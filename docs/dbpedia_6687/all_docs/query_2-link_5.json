        "text": "Summary:Languages may include writing, but many of today’s living languages do not have writing systems. Writing systems are more complex than most people are aware of, and can complicate the issue of learning a second language.\n\nHow Many Languages Are There?\n\nEthnologue lists 7, 111 living languages: 2,140 in Africa, 1, 058 in the Americas, 2,303 in Asia, 288 in Europe, and 1,322 in the Pacific. Of those only 3,909 languages currently have a written form. This means that over 3,000 languages in use today do not have writing systems associated with them.\n\nWhat is the Difference Between Spoken and Written Language?\n\nSpeech is sound – it is transient and immediate, used for face-to-face interactions.\n\nWriting is a method of representing language in visual or tactile form, using symbols to represent the sounds of speech and may also have symbols for things such as pauses, intonation and numbers. Writing is usually permanent and cannot generally be changed once it has been printed Writing can communicate across time and space.\n\nAll systems of writing except Braille (raised dots) and Moon (embossed shapes) systems for the blind and visually-impaired leave visible signs.\n\nHow Can a Language Not Have a Written Form?\n\nSome of the languages that don’t have written forms are sign or gestural languages, such as those used by deaf and hard-of-hearing. Many of these languages did not develop writing systems because they themselves were developed originally as “alternative forms” of spoken languages, which already had associated writing systems. For example, S.E.E. Sign, which is Signed Exact English. Since this language is a gestural system of representation for spoken English, it is represented by written English already, and has no need of a separately developed writing system.\n\nHowever, there are sign or gestural languages that many hearing people would consider “alternative forms” of spoken languages which are actually separate languages altogether. American Sign Language (ASL) is an example of this. Where S.E.E. Sign is as much as possible a gesture for word equivalence, ASL is not. ASL has a grammar and syntax of its own that is much closer to an Asian language than to English. There have been several different writing systems developed for ASL over the decades since Thomas Gallaudet and Laurent Clerc invented it in the early 1800s, though none have taken hold strongly. For this reason, most ASL speakers are bilingual with English as their second language. They may use ASL as their immediate, face-to-face communication and English as their written communication. This, of course, confers all the benefits of bilingualism that we have previously discussed.\n\nHow Many Writing Systems Are There?\n\nThe answer to this depends upon what your definition of writing system is. If this sounds a little like I’m waffling, I’m sorry, but the answer is quite complex. I’ll try to simplify.\n\nFirst, we could use classifications:\n\n1. Pictographic/ideographic writing systems – scripts in which written items (called graphemes) represent concepts or ideas rather than specific words, and in which graphemes are iconic pictures.\n\nExamples above are: Aztec Nahuatl Writing from Mexico, Mi’kmaq Writing from Canada and Dongba Symbols from southern China near Tibet (all images sourced from Wikipedia).\n\n2. Logographic writing systems – scripts in which written items (in this case called morphemes because they represent the smallest meaningful parts of words) are glyphs.\n\na. Consonant-based logographies – the writing systems of ancient Egypt - Heiroglyphs\n\nb. Syllable-based logographies – other classical writing systems\n\nThe examples above are from the ancient Akkadian Empire, the evolution of\n\nChinese ideograms, and Maya ideographic glyphs from a pyramid in Palenque.\n\n3. Syllabaries – systems in which graphemes represent syllables.\n\nThis is the Afaka syllabary recorded by Dutch missionaries in 1920. Afaka is a creole (a language created from the joining together of two or more other languages and the people's practical working way of getting things done) spoken in Suriname.\n\nThis is a Kana chart that includes both the Hirigana and Katakana characters for writing Japanese.\n\nWoleai is the language spoken and written on Woleai Atoll, known as the Caroline Islands at the time the syllabary was first reported by missionary Alfred Snelling and verified by European linguists in 1905. Located in Micronesia in the Pacific, the Atoll uses some Roman letters in its syllabary. The question arose whether they had been previously exposed to the alphabet by other explorers, had developed these letter forms on their own, or if Snelling and his party had supplemented the existing symbols with alphabet characters known to them. The wide table above is the original table of symbols recorded in the syllabary. The long table is the symbols proposed in 2006, for adding the Woleai script to Unicode, so it could be reproduced on computer screens and websites.\n\nLocated in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, these bilingual signs are in Cherokee and English. Tahlequah is one of the few communities remaining where Cherokee is a living language in daily use by native speakers. The community is working to encourage its children and youth to value and continue that tradition so that the language does not die. There are currently fewer than 5,000 native speakers of Cherokee living. Despite all efforts, the population of Cherokee speakers, both native and second language speakers, is shrinking. Have you thought of learning a Native American language?\n\nThe Pater Noster above written in the Yugtun script of the central Alaskan Yup'ik language, Uyaquq. Missionaries were often the first Europeans on site in \"newly discovered\" areas. (And made a highly preferable choice over soldiers come to conquer.) So, often the first available language specimens we have are religious texts, like this one.\n\n4. Segmental scripts – systems in which graphemes represent the basic units of sound (phonemes) of a language.\n\na. Abjads – a segmental script that contains only consonants.\n\nالمادة 1 يولد جميع الناس أحرارًا متساوين في الكرامة والحقوق. وقد وهبوا عقلاً وضميرًا وعليهم أن يعامل بعضهم بعضًا بروح الإخاء.المادة\n\nOne of the most well-known abjads in the modern world, Arabic. This is the official or co-official language of 25 countries around the world, as well as the language of the Qu'ran, the holy book of Islam, the world's second largest religion (with 1.8 billion adherents at last count).\n\nThis is Hebrew, another very well-known abjad in use today. It is the language of Israel, and the language of Judaism, which is a small religion with only 0. 6% of the world population self-selecting as Jewish. This tiny group has an outsized influence, though, with the world's two largest religions (Christianity 2.4 billion adherents - 33% world population, and Islam 1.8 billion adherents - 24% world population) claiming roots in the Hebrew scriptures.\n\nBoth of these abjads are printed from right to left, in contrast to English and other languages that use the Roman alphabet. Neither of them is typically printed with vowels.\n\nb. True Alphabets – containing separate letters for both consonants and vowels. The language you are reading now is one of the most common examples. (By the way, this alphabet is called the Roman Alphabet, because it is based upon the letter style used in the Roman Empire.)\n\nThe Cyrillic Alphabet is used to write Russian and other Slavic languages. It has been added to Unicode as of version 12.0 and can be accessed across several blocks for easy computer and website printing.\n\nThe Greek alphabet consists of twenty-four letters with upper case and lower case forms:\n\nΑ α, Β β, Γ γ, Δ δ, Ε ε, Ζ ζ, Η η, Θ θ, Ι ι, Κ κ, Λ λ, Μ μ,\n\nΝ ν, Ξ ξ, Ο ο, Π π, Ρ ρ, Σ σ/ς, Τ τ, Υ υ, Φ φ, Χ χ, Ψ ψ, and Ω ω.\n\nTamil and Sinhalese are the languages of Sri Lanka. Both use alphabets that look quite different to what modern Europeans are used to seeing. The founding fathers and mothers of the United States of America, however, would not have found these scripts terribly ornate.\n\nThis is an open source font available online. (Click on the image to get to the site.)\n\nThe Sinhala alphabet is also used to write other languages such as Pali and Sanskrit, as well as other Indian languages less known to those outside the area.\n\nThe Tamil alphabet appears below. Note the romanized equivalents beneath each symbol; each consonant is accompanied by a vowel sound as a \"default\" and must be modified in order to become a pure consonant sound.\n\nc. Alphasyllabaries/Abugidas – a segmental script in which vowel are represented by diacritical marks or other systematic modifications of the consonants.\n\nBoth Arabic and Hebrew have optional diacritical marks to indicate vowels. For that reason, they can both be placed either here, under abudgidas/alphasyllabaries, or above under abjads.\n\nI have placed them under both because both writing systems regularly appear with and without their vowel markings under different circumstances. Signs, newspapers, books and other media are commonly printed without vowels. Learning materials, especially for those new to the languages, are generally printed with vowels.\n\nHow Many Languages Are Written Using Each System?\n\nThat is an even more difficult question than the one above, because the Internet and the World Wide Web have caused a virtual stampede toward “standardization.” Many languages are being written in “Romanized” forms, by using the Roman alphabet to approximate the sounds. The difficulty with this is that native speakers of languages all over the globe that use this alphabet pronounce the letters differently. So, how are people who do not know what Telugu sounds like to know whether you’ve Romanized it using Australian, Canadian, British or Indian English pronunciation standards? And, how are they to make the correct sounds from reading what you’ve written?\n\nSome people believe the solution lies in using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), long used by professional linguists to record sounds without having anyone’s spelling conventions get in the way. The problem with this is that so few people outside the field of linguistics are familiar with the IPA. We'll discuss this more next time.\n\nSo, this has been a lot of information, a lot to take in and a very short space of time and print in which to do it. We will continue with this topic next week, bringing more to the discussion of global language and writing. In the meantime, what would you like to know? Tell me in the comments. I'll be reading them and I'll either include your questions or answer you privately."
