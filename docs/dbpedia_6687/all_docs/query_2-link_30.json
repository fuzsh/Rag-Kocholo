        "text": "Different countries of the world have adopted the Braille System to suits their language. The main focus of the paper is the conversion of Tamil to Braille Conversion System. The paper provides a detail description of a system for Tamil Braille and different grades of Braille contraction. The Tamil Braille is designed to facilitate Tamil-speaking visually impaired people interaction with computers, as well as helping sighted users to communicate with the visually impaired person.\n\nNearly 161 million persons live with a disabling visual impairment, of whom 37 million are blind. About 90 % of them live in developing countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Pacific Regions. 9 out of 10 blind children in developing countries have no access to education. The system of embossed writing invented by Louis Braille gradually came to be accepted throughout the world as the fundamental form of written communication for blind individuals. This paper is concerned about the transliteration of English and Hindi text to Braille. Braille is a dotted pattern used by the blind people for reading and writing. In this paper we have discussed the possible ways to teach Blind people [11]..Braille has become the pre-eminent tactile alphabet. Its characters are six- dot cells, two wide by three tall. Any of\n\nBraille is a tactic writing system that has been used by blind. This paper presents a brief survey of character recognition and transliteration works on Braille system so as to design a system that will transliterate Malayalam scanned books and magazines in to Braille. The proposed system deals with a printed Malayalam text to Braille transliteration system which includes a Malayalam optical character recognition system (OCR) and Malayalam to Braille mapping. Braille for Indian language is called Bharathi Braille. The beauty of Bharathi Braille is that it is based on phonetics. Bharati Braille is the adaptation of the six dot system for the languages of India. The history of Bharati Braille dates back to the period prior to India&#39;s independence. At a conference held at Beirut in 1951, a body of world scholars examined the possibility of a phonetically derived system of six dots that could be used for most of the languages of India, pakistan and Sri Lanka. Bharati Braille was a r...\n\nSpeech and text is the significant intermediate for human communication. The Braille encoding system represents textual documents in a readable format for the visually challenged person. This paper projects a model to assist visually impaired or blind person in reading the text present on southern Indian Language text image by converting the text into corresponding Braille script. The experimentation of the algorithms was carried out on southern Indian Language text image dataset. Experimental results show that the projected method has a good performance on converting the extracted text regions in an image to corresponding Braille Script.\n\nhttps://www.ijert.org/issues-in-transliterating-malayalam-text-to-braille https://www.ijert.org/research/issues-in-transliterating-malayalam-text-to-braille-IJERTV4IS051154.pdf Braille is a tactic writing system that has been used by blind. This paper presents a brief survey of character recognition and transliteration works on Braille system and some issues in transliterating Malayalam text to Braille so as to design a system that will transliterate Malayalam scanned books and magazines in to Braille.

The system includes a Malayalam optical character recognition system (OCR) and a Malayalam to Braille mapping system."
