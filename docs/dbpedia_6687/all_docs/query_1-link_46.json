        "text": "Old English\n\nOld English, or Anglo-Saxon, was the earliest form of the English language, spoken in medieval England and parts of Scotland. Originating from Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century, it evolved into Middle English after the Norman Conquest in 1066. The language had four main dialects: Kentish, Mercian, Northumbrian, and West Saxon. It featured complex grammar and vocabulary, using both runic and Latin scripts."
