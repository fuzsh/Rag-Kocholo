        "text": "By John Serba\n\njserba@mlive.com\n\nHello, cinema fiends who also happen to be obsessive administrators of your entire lives – time to plan your viewing for the next year! I’ve dug through the 2017 movie-release schedule in its entirety (at least as it stands right now), and plucked every sequel, franchise chapter and reboot likely to take the box office by storm, as well as a few smaller “prestige” movies to keep us sane, and deemed them all absolutely necessary for your cinematic consumption. I found 30 movies – which simultaneously seems like too many, and not enough – and listed them in order of release date.\n\nThe list includes, of course, “Baywatch,” “The Emoji Movie,” “The Dukes of Hazzard: The Revenge of Coy and Vance,” “My Little Pony” and “Smurfs: The Lost Village,” and I only made up one of those titles. It also includes junk you don’t care at all about, like “Star Wars” and “Wonder Woman.” So get out your calendars, you gluttons for pop-cultural punishment.\n\nCourtesy photo | Warner Bros./Claire Folger\n\n'Live by Night'\n\nPro: Ben Affleck follows up his Oscar-winning directorial effort “Argo” with this 1920s gangster drama. Con: Ben Affleck also stars in this follow-up to his Oscar-winning directorial effort “Argo” with this 1920s gangster drama. These days, I think I prefer my Ben Affleck behind the camera (and my Casey Affleck in front of it, since we’re on the Affleck topic). (Opens Jan. 13)\n\nCourtesy photo | Lionsgate\n\n'John Wick: Chapter 2'\n\n“John Wick” was one of 2014’s quiet cult hits, a stylish and dynamic genre exercise from stuntman-turned-director Chad Stahelski. It starred Keanu Reeves as a P.O.’d former assassin seeking revenge on the creeps who killed his dog. If Stahelski’s action in the sequel is half as awesome as the first, it’ll still be great. To paraphrase a wise friend of mine, sometimes you just want maximum direction with minimal story.

Well, Will Arnett returns to voice Lego Batman, who can now be a total jerk in his own adventure. Low-ish expectations usually yield acceptable results.

I just can’t take it! Put that peacock feather away, naughty boy! (Feb. 10)\n\nRELATED: Review: 'Fifty Shades of Grey' is a vast chasm of emptiness with lots of sex scenes\n\n'Logan'\n\nSeventeen years after he first strapped on Wolverine’s claws and sideburns, Hugh Jackman will retire from the role, but not until he headlines one last movie, rumored to be R-rated, likely for lots and lots of violence, and maybe some cussing. You know, like the smash-success “Deadpool,” another “X-Men” character. I wonder if Jackman is as burned out playing Wolverine as we are watching him do it? (March 3)\n\nCourtesy photo | Warner Bros.\n\n'Kong: Skull Island'\n\nApparently, it’s time to reboot King Kong again. Sheesh. But temper your cynicism, and stoke the flames of your inner kaiju geek: “Skull Island” is set in the same universe as the superlative 2014 “Godzilla” (a movie you should love a lot more than you probably do, and don’t argue with me about it), eventually leading to a big-screen spectacle in which giant ape and giant lizard pummel the CGI stuffing out of each other. I’m game. No shame. (March 10)\n\nCourtesy photo | Sony\n\n'T2 Trainspotting'\n\n“Trainspotting” is another one of those movies that probably never should be burdened with a sequel. Why risk tainting the legacy? At least Danny Boyle, a top-tier modern visual stylist, comes back, directing the same cast, and writing a story set 20 years after the original. The true original. A true original that’s one of the definitive films of the 1990s. I’m extra cautiously optimistic. (March 10)\n\nCourtesy photo | Disney\n\n'Beauty and the Beast'\n\nSeriously, Disney. Come up with a new story, instead of rehashing the old ones (many of which were swiped from public-domain fairytales, even). Of course, positive precedent was set in 2015 with “Cinderella” – Cate Blanchett as the wicked stepmother: still scary as hell, last time I checked – so we’ll be happy if this latest live-action version of a beloved animated film, starring the “Harry Potter”-famous Emma Watson, is as good. (March 17)\n\nCourtesy photo | Lionsgate\n\n'Power Rangers'\n\nHello there, 1990s nostalgia. I see you’re in full swing. Where’s the “Mighty Morphin” part of the title? Oh, there’s a difference between the “Mighty Morphin” and the non-“Mighty Morphin” Power Rangers. With that nugget of information, I already know way, way more than I need. Oh – I see Bryan Cranston plays something known as “Zordon,” which seems like a terrific use of his singular talent. Sweet. (March 24)\n\nCourtesy photo | Universal\n\n'The Fate of the Furious'\n\nA.k.a. “Fast and Furious 8,” or “My Headache: Chapter VIII.” Charlize Theron and Helen Mirren join the melee, which brings back stars Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Kurt Russell, Jason Statham, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris and your mom, part of the ever-growing cast that’s roughly the size of Luxembourg, in this ever-ludicrous series that makes as much money as Luxembourg’s gross national product, and tears up enough CGI landscape to fill 20 CGI Luxembourgs. I’ll take one ticket and 17 Excedrin, please. (April 14)\n\nCourtesy photo | Disney/Marvel\n\n'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'\n\nBaby Groot! Talented director James Gunn returns to helm the sequel to the wittiest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, kicking off the summer movie season. Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana and co. all return for what looks to be all kinds of intergalactic cleverness, set to another kitschy-cool mixtape soundtrack. (May 5)\n\nCourtesy photo | Justina Mintz / 20th Century Fox\n\n'Snatched'\n\nAmy Schumer teams up with Goldie Hawn for this comedy, playing a mother-daughter duo kidnapped while vacationing in Ecuador. In case you haven’t noticed, this is Hawn’s first film in 15 years, and teaming her with Schumer (love her or hate her; I’m more in the former camp) seems brilliant in theory. The film is written by Kate Dippold, who penned “The Heat” (nice) and “Ghostbusters” (ehhhh). (May 12)\n\nCourtesy photo | 20th Century Fox\n\n'Alien: Covenant'\n\nUnpopular opinion: I liked “Prometheus” despite its flaws. It featured a few great moments, most centered on Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender’s characters, and both survived that film’s horrors to return in this sequel from director Ridley Scott (part of a planned trilogy set prior to the events of 1979’s “Alien”). Looks like we’ll see more of the little scary mouth inside the big scary mouth this time. Hooray! (May 19)\n\nCourtesy photo | Disney\n\n'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales'\n\nIs this the sixth “Pirates” movie? Eighth? Ninth? I can’t keep track. C’mon, ye titlers of movies, you have a colon in there, can’t you add a dash followed by “Chapter XV” or “Vol. 12”? OK. Enough. I looked it up. It’s only the fifth adventure for Captain Jack Sparrow, even if it seems like more, and the trailer only teases his arrival, as if we don’t know what he looks like: an absurdly well-paid Johnny Depp. Javier Bardem plays a CGI enhanced villain this time around, and Orlando Bloom returns to the franchise after taking a movie off. (May 26)\n\nCourtesy photo | Warner Bros.\n\n'Wonder Woman'\n\nWith “Justice League” morale at an all-time low with fans after “Batman v Superman” and “Suicide Squad” (but, curiously, ticket sales were just fine), Gal Gadot’s Amazonian hero – directed by Patty Jenkins (“Monster”) – is the franchise hope. Two knee-jerk thoughts: Unlike Marvel, at least DC has the guts to have a superheroine headline her own movie. And Wonder Woman better fly her invisible plane, or I’ll ask for a refund. (June 2)\n\nCourtesy photo | Universal\n\n'The Mummy'\n\nNo, Tom Cruise doesn’t play the title character, but he’s definitely a not-normal person who dies and comes back to life, a development tied to a very old sarcophagus, a crazy-eyed ancient goddess and Russell Crowe playing a character named Dr. Henry Jekyll. (No, there isn’t a credited character named Mr. Hyde – I CTRL-F’d the IMDb page.) Sounds like quite the cinematic salmagundi! (June 9)\n\nCourtesy photo | Disney\n\n'Cars 3'\n\nStubbornly, Pixar ignores the outcry of moviegoers over the age of nine so it can rake in another billion or so with a third movie in the sub-par \"Cars\" series. Meanwhile, we elder Pixar devotees gnash our teeth, because we'd much rather see, oh, literally anything else the beloved animation masters might come up with. Anyway, the teaser trailer finds Owen Wilson-voiced racer Lightning McQueen crashing real hard during a race, and it's dark. Real dark. Almost as dark as if we had learned Larry the Cable Guy is reprising Mater, which is probable, but not yet certain. (June 16)\n\n'Transformers: The Last Knight'\n\n“Plot is unknown,” says IMDb. Oh, good. Michael Bay is keeping all the details under wraps. Cool. Wouldn’t want to spoil any of the incomprehensible explosion mayhem dreck plot CGI kablooey wreckage implicating Mark Wahlberg and Anthony Hopkins. Why is this a movie we “need to see”? Because rage is what makes a person feel alive. (June 23)\n\nCourtesy photo | Universal\n\n'Despicable Me 3'\n\nAbout 20 minutes have passed since we were last annoyed-slash-delighted (such a confusing blur of emotions!) by a Minion, so we’re getting another “Despciable,” in which Steve Carell returns to voice goofball supervillain and Minion master Gru. Brace yourself for antics, and possibly a hijinks or three. (June 30)\n\nCourtesy photo | Sony\n\n'Spider-Man: Homecoming'\n\nThe – deep sigh – third take on the Marvel hero drops him in the “Avengers” narrative for guaranteed success. (This development comes via an unprecedented blockbuster collaboration between Disney and Sony, the latter of which was disappointed with the paltry $1.4 billion international box office of two “Amazing Spider-Man” movies. What a failure!) Peter Parker is played by Tom Holland as the squeakiest-voiced teen in his high school, and he teams up with Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man to fight a bad guy who looks like the Vulture. P.S. Director Jon Watts’ track record includes a creepy-clown horror movie and a flick in which Kevin Bacon wears a cop ’stache. (July 7)\n\n'War for the Planet of the Apes'\n\nHail, Caesar. I love this new “Apes” franchise, which is head-and-shoulders above most sci-fi/reboot fodder, perhaps because the story and special effects are terrific, perhaps because Fox isn’t releasing three movies every stinking month (I’m glaring at you, Marvel). Matt Reeves proved to be a superior action director with 2014’s “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,” and he comes back to stage a heavy simian revolt. I’m chuffed. (July 14)\n\nCourtesy photo | Warner Bros.\n\n'Dunkirk'\n\nChristopher *BWOHHMMMMMMMM* Nolan tells the story of a grueling World War II battle in his follow-up to 2014 McConaughey head trip “Interstellar.” It stars TOHHHHHHMMMM Hardy, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy and Harry Styles of One Direction fame(!). We’ll see if this is Nolan’s “Saving Private Ryan.” Oh – guess who composed the score? HAAAHHHHHNNNNNNNS Zimmer, of course. (July 21)\n\nCourtesy photo | Sony\n\n'The Dark Tower'\n\nStephen King’s popular sci-fi/Western/horror book series gets a big-screen spinoff (not necessarily an adaptation, per King himself) starring Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey. Sounds promising, especially considering sci-fi/Western/horror is the hot new triple-genre mash thanks to “Westworld.” This is somewhat long in the making, having passed through the hands of J.J. Abrams and Ron Howard. Note, fans of the novels are diehard, and probably hard to please. (July 28)\n\nCourtesy photo | Sony\n\n'Baby Driver'\n\nA.k.a. “Edgar Wright’s ‘Drive.’” The director of “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World” and “Shaun of the Dead” helms this story of a getaway driver (Ansel Elgort) working an ill-fated heist. Jon Hamm, Kevin Spacey and Jamie Foxx stud the cast with stars. If this is Wright's excuse to stage lots of car chases, I'll bite. Hard. Wright is one of the most gifted filmmakers in the biz, having sidestepped the rumored creative restrictions of Marvel, bailing on “Ant Man” a couple years back, and pursuing his own endeavors. You have to admire that. (Aug. 11)\n\nCourtesy photo | Warner Bros.\n\n'Blade Runner 2049'\n\nFrom the I Hope They Know What They’re Messing With Dept. comes a sequel to a hands-down classic that probably should stand on its own – forever. But with Denis Villeneuve (“Arrival,” “Sicario”) directing Ryan Gosling and a returning Harrison Ford, it may just do its predecessor some justice. (Oct. 6)\n\nCourtesy photo | Disney/Marvel\n\n\"Thor: Ragnarok\"\n\nMaybe adding Mark Ruffalo’s Hulk/Bruce Banner to the third “Thor” flick will render the blond-tressed Norse-god Avenger’s third solo adventure more watchable than the first two. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Dr. Strange, as well as a new character played by Cate Blanchett, have been brought in to elevate the proceedings, too. (Nov. 3)\n\nCourtesy photo | Warner Bros.\n\n'Justice League'\n\nBatman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman and the Flash gang up to hopefully not ruin your holiday season with grimness and unlight, what with Zack Snyder directing and all. It could be the cinematic equivalent of a 10-mile-wide meteor crashing into Earth, and it would still earn three-quarters of a billion dollars worldwide as people line up to witness the spectacle. (Nov. 17)\n\nCourtesy photo | Disney/Pixar\n\n'Coco'\n\nAt least Pixar is plying fans with a second release in 2017, combating the inevitable ill will tied to “Cars 3” with this original story, from “Toy Story 3” director Lee Unkrich. Set during Mexico’s Dia de los Muertos, it’s about a 12-year-old boy questing for answers to a century-old mystery. (Nov. 22)\n\nAP photo | Jonathan Short/Invision\n\n'Star Wars: Episode VIII'\n\nWe’ll watch this with broken hearts now that our princess is gone. Carrie Fisher completed filming her scenes as General Leia before she passed away – and that’s pretty much all we know about the movie, besides the release date, and that it’ll pick up where “The Force Awakens” left off, with Luke Skywalker standing on a hill looking like very bummed out. Rian Johnson (“Looper,” key episodes of “Breaking Bad”) writes and directs, cause for another new something. What’s the word I’m looking for? Dream, aspiration, promise… ah, forget it. (Dec. 15)\n\nAP photo | Evan Agostini/Invision\n\n'Downsizing'\n\nAlexander Payne, a name we’ve heard on many an Oscar night past, as director and writer of the excellent dramedies “About Schmidt,” “The Descendants,” “Nebraska” and “Sideways,” appears to be taking a left turn for this story of a man who wants to shrink himself. No, it doesn’t star Rick Moranis – rather, Matt Damon, Kristen Wiig, Alec Baldwin, Christoph Waltz, Neil Patrick Harris, Margo Martindale and Jason Sudeikis. This one is stacked. (Dec. 22)\n\n'King Arthur' courtesy photo | Warner Bros.\n\nA few more to look out for\n\n“King Arthur: Legend of the Sword” – Guy Ritchie directs, Charlie Hunnam stars. (May 12)\n\n“The Beguiled” – This Civil War period piece starring Elle Fanning and Kirsten Dunst comes via Sofia Coppola (“Lost in Translation”), who’s ripe for a comeback. (June 30)\n\n“Red Sparrow” – Jennifer Lawrence and Joel Edgerton anchor this spy drama. (Nov. 10)\n\n“Mute” – Ignore “Warcraft” and think “Moon” – director Duncan Jones returns to his smaller-budget, bigger-idea sci-fi roots for a direct-to-Netflix film. (TBA)\n\n“Wonderstruck” – Todd Haynes (“Carol”) teams up with Cate Blanchett again. And Michelle Williams and Julianne Moore. Yum.
