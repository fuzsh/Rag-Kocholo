In this case, it’s our fine feathered friends of the title that suddenly begin deadly attacks on people along the Northern California coast. The human cast, led by Rod Taylor, Tippi Hedren, Jessica Tandy, Suzanne Pleshette and Veronica Cartwright, are all great, but the real stars are Hitchcock’s direction, and the film’s editing, Oscar-nominated visual effects and, especially, its sound. The Birds does not feature a conventional music score to heighten scenes; much of the film uses calculated silences that are suddenly interrupted by bursts of electronically created bird sounds, to terrifying effect. Hitchcock’s frequent musical collaborator, Bernard Herrmann, is credited as the film’s “sound consultant.”\n\nNFL Football: Detroit at Dallas\n\nABC & ESPN, 8pm Live\n\nA Saturday Week 17 primetime matchup has Jared Goff and the Detroit Lions on the road against Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nI Am Burt Reynolds\n\nThe CW, 8pm\n\nInterviews and archival footage provide insight into the life of movie star Burt Reynolds.\n\nSunday, Dec. 31\n\n’70s, ’80s & ’90s Comedies\n\nTCM, beginning at 8pm\n\nCatch a Classic!\n\nClassic movie fans can send off 2023 and welcome in 2024 with music, dance and laughs this afternoon and evening with lineups on MOVIES! and Turner Classic Movies.\n\nKicking off New Year’s Eve afternoon on MOVIES! and running until well past the stroke of midnight on New Year’s Day, enjoy a toe-tapping six-film marathon of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers’ classic big-screen pairings, starting with the duo’s quintessential pairing in Top Hat (1935). Following that are Carefree (1938); Flying Down to Rio (1933), the first time Astaire and Rogers danced together onscreen; The Gay Divorcee (1934); Shall We Dance (1937); and a re-airing of Top Hat.\n\nThis evening’s lineup on TCM, which continues well into early New Year’s Day, features several comedies from the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s, some lesser-seen but all hilarious. The lineup begins with Spaceballs (1987), cowriter/director Mel Brooks’ beloved parody of Star Wars and other sci-fi classics. Brooks also has a couple of roles in the film, starring alongside Bill Pullman, John Candy, Daphne Zuniga, Rick Moranis and Joan Rivers. After that comes Top Secret! (1984), a follow-up to the 1980 comedy hit Airplane! from cowriters/directors Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker (ZAZ). Like the ZAZ’s previous film, this one throws everything at the wall for laughs as it combines and parodies the disparate film genres of Elvis Presley musicals and Cold War/World War II spy movies. Val Kilmer, in his feature film debut, leads the cast as Nick Rivers with not only great comic timing, but also terrific singing and dancing. Next come two music mockumentaries: This Is Spinal Tap (1984), cowriter/director Rob Reiner’s legendary and uproariously funny look at the fictional heavy metal band of the title, followed by the likely lesser-known Fear of a Black Hat (1993), a mockumentary about a fictional hardcore gangsta rap group written and directed by Rusty Cundieff. The lineup concludes in the early hours of 2024 with The Kentucky Fried Movie (1977), an anthology of comedy sketches written by the ZAZ team and directed by John Landis, and Murder by Death (1976), a comedic mystery written by Neil Simon and with a heavy-hitting cast including Peter Sellers, David Niven, Alec Guinness, Truman Capote, Peter Falk, Eileen Brennan and Elsa Lanchester.\n\nParty With “The Partridge Family” Marathon\n\nAntenna TV, beginning at 7pm\n\nCome on, get happy as Antenna TV ushers in 2024 with 10 hours of episodes from The Partridge Family, the 1970-74 musical sitcom led by Shirley Jones, David Cassidy, Susan Dey, Danny Bonaduce and Dave Madden.\n\nNew Year’s Eve Live: Nashville’s Big Bash\n\nCBS, 7:30pm\n\nRing in the new year with this celebration featuring live, high-energy performances from country music’s hottest superstars.
