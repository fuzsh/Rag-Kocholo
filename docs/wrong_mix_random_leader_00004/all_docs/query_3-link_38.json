They soon face the danger and threat of a newly released criminal (Rourke) and his crew who will do whatever it takes to retrieve the money -- including kidnap the agent's daughters. Stakes are high and lives are at risk in this head-to-head battle as the agent stops at nothing to protect his family against the money-hungry criminals.",
