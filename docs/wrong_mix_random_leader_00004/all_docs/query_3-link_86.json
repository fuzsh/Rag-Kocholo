        "text": "Movement on the She-Hulk front gives Marvel fans another hero to look forward to, big changes are ahead for CBS All Access and DC Universe, Starz doubles-down on 50 Cent, and more of the week’s top news, trailers, and other TV and streaming developments.\n\nTOP STORY\n\nThe Orphan Black Star Lined Up to Star as the Marvel Attorney/Superheroine\n\n(Photo by Marvel Comics; Valerie Macon/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe MCU’s TV wing just got a little more badass: Orphan Black star Tatiana Maslany has been tapped by Marvel to star in its Disney+ She-Hulk series, playing the leading lady who snagged super powers after sharing some of cousin Bruce Banner’s — a.k.a. The Hulk’s — blood.\n\nShe-Hulk is attorney Jennifer Walters in her regular life, but she grows green and large and super strong and powerful as She-Hulk. She-Hulk, unlike Bruce, usually maintains her personality and intelligence when she Hulks out. The character was set to be featured in a live-action movie played by Brigitte Nielsen in the 1990s, but the film was never made.\n\nIn addition to Maslany’s casting, which was first reported by Deadline, Kat Corio, who has directed episodes of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Modern Family, and Dead to Me, was announced as the director of the She-Hulk pilot and several additional eps, as well as an executive producer on the series, which will be under the showrunner leadership of Rick and Morty Emmy winner Jessica Gao.\n\nMaslany, an Emmy winner for Orphan Black, most recently starred with Matthew Rhys in HBO’s Perry Mason remake.\n\nCBS All Access To Become Paramount+ and Making an Offer We Can’t Refuse with New Godfather Making-Of Series\n\n(Photo by Paramount Pictures)\n\nGoodbye, CBS All Access, hello Paramount+ and some new programming to be excited about. The Viacom-owned streaming service that is currently home to all things new in the Star Trek series world will revamp and rename itself Paramount+ early in 2021, and will add a lineup of additional series that, like Trek, will be new versions of old favorites.\n\nThe service, which will offer TV programming from Viacom networks like BET, Comedy Central, MTV, VH1, and Nickelodeon, as well as movies, is combining both genres for The Offer, a 10-episode limited TV series from writer and executive producer Michael Tolkin about Al Ruddy’s experience producing The Godfather. Ruddy won the Best Picture Oscar for The Godfather, and was presented with the statue by Clint Wastwood. He later shared his second Best Picture Oscar with Eastwood (and Tom Rosenberg) for the Eastwood-directed and starring drama Million Dollar Baby.\n\nAlso in the lineup for Paramount+, which will boast more than 30,000 TV episodes and movies:\n\n• A revival of Mara Brock Akil’s The Game, the 2006-15 CW and BET sitcom now streaming on Netflix\n\n• The Real Criminal Minds, a true crime docuseries based on the CBS procedural\n\n• A reboot of the classic VH1 musical biography series Behind the Music that will now focus on the top 40 artists of the last 40 years\n\n• Lioness, a new spy drama from Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan, about a Marine who is tasked with befriending the daughter of a terrorist to help destroy the criminal organization\n\n• The SpongeBob SquarePants spin-off Kamp Koral\n\nParamount+ will also be the home of continuing CBS All Access original series like The Good Fight, The Twilight Zone, Star Trek: Discovery, Star Trek: Picard, Star Trek: Lower Decks, and the upcoming Star Trek: Strange New Worlds.\n\nDC Universe To Evolve into Digital Comic Book Subscription Service\n\n(Photo by DC Universe)\n\nAs HBO Max takes over streaming DC premium video content, including classics and originals, the DC Universe will evolve into DC Universe Infinite, a digital comic book subscription service scheduled for a January 21 relaunch. Subscribers to the service will get digital-first comics, exclusive access to DC fan events, as well as recently released comics six months after the physical versions hit store shelves.\n\nAlong with the news, HBO Max announced it has ordered a third season of Warner Bros. Animation’s critically acclaimed DC Universe adult animated comedy series Harley Quinn, starring Kaley Cuoco.\n\nPower Producer and Star 50 Cent Developing More Starz Dramas, Including One About 50 Cent\n\nSaturday Night Live Will Open New Season in the Studio, With New Joe Biden Portrayer Jim Carrey\n\n(Photo by Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic)\n\nWe thought Ted Lasso star and former SNL cast member Jason Sudeikis was doing a fine job playing presidential contender Joe Biden on the late-night sketch comedy series, but SNL producer Lorne Michaels has other ideas for the new season. Michaels told Vulture.com that he’s decided to go with Jim Carrey as a new Biden for season 46.\n\n“… It came down to discussions about what the take was. He and (head writer) Colin Jost had a bunch of talks,” Michaels said of the Golden Globe winner and four-time SNL host. “(Carrey) and I as well. He will give the part energy and strength, and … (laughs) hopefully it’s funny.”\n\nAlec Baldwin is returning to play the POTUS for the new season. Maya Rudolph will also return as potential vice-president Kamala Harris, while Beck Bennett will continue to play current VP Mike Pence.\n\nThe show, which weathered the pandemic last season with remotely-shot At Home episodes, will premiere the new season on October 3, with the cast and a very small audience in its Studio 8H home. The show will be live for five consecutive weeks to start the new run, and while no season 45 cast members left, three new featured players will include Lauren Holt, Punkie Johnson, and SNL writer Andrew Dismukes.

Pierce is replacing Tom Hollander, who was originally set to play Paul Child, Julia’s devoted husband.

Sarah Lancashire will play the title role.\n\nOphelia Lovibond (Trying, Elementary) will star in the HBO Max comedy pilot Minx, about a feminist who teams up with a publisher in 1970s Los Angeles to launch the first erotic magazine for women.

The kids happily head back to school, but nothing resembles the normal that they once knew; not their teachers, not their homeroom, not even Eric Cartman.”\n\nSingle Parents writers and producers Taylor Cox and Kim Rosenstock are developing a new comedy at ABC. Happy for You is the story of two unmarried sisters and their recently separated mother, who are stressed out by the news that the family’s youngest daughter is about to get married, and they have to help plan the big day.\n\nQuibi has ordered a second season to its Kevin Hart comedy Die Hart: Die Harter.
