        "text": "The prevention and relief of suffering has long been a core medical concern. But while this is a laudable goal, some question whether medicine can, or should, aim for a world without pain, sadness, anxiety, despair or uncertainty. To explore these issues, we invited experts from six of the world’s major faith traditions to address the following question. Is there value in suffering? And is something lost in the prevention and/or relief of suffering? While each of the perspectives provided maintains that suffering should be alleviated and that medicine’s proper role is to prevent and relieve suffering by ethical means, it is also apparent that questions regarding the meaning and value of suffering are beyond the realm of medicine. These perspectives suggest that medicine and bioethics has much to gain from respectful consideration of religious discourse surrounding suffering.\n\nThere are a number of basic questions that lie at the heart of the underlying theological principles that scaffold the numerous worldviews. Among these is the issue of the human condition, the breaking of sacred law, and the answer to the quandary of how one atones and makes recompense for such actions. Nearly all theological perspectives need to assess the nature of humanity in relation to deity (theological anthropology) as well as how sin and wrongdoing affects the human condition (hamartiology) and how one is made right within that framework (soteriology). Therefore, this paper will attempt to assess three religious worldviews: Islam, Christianity, and Buddhism, in order to highlight the similarities and pinpoint the distinctions in their understanding of hamartiology in the context of their cognizance of theological anthropology. An attempt will be made to look at how each theological perspective treats the question of soteriology, and how reconciliation and atonement is made; pointing out the uniqueness within the Christian tradition in regards to the theological principles of mercy and justice.\n\nDeploying the analytical method, this article addresses Mahmoud Ayoub's theory of redemptive suffering in Islam. This theory was inspired by the Christian doctrine of redemptive suffering, wherein Jesus Christ's passions are considered an atonement for the deliverance and salvation of humanity, liberating them from slavery to sins. Considering that Imam al Husayn's suffering and martyrdom in Karbala granted him the right to intercession, through which he can deliver people from the fires of hell, Ayoub presents a model for redemption and salvation based on Islamic doctrines and Imami Shiite theology. This article provides a critical examination of Ayoub's model. Finally, by assessing the possibility and potentiality of the concept of redemption in Shiite theology, the article aims to pave another path for research on its full compatibility with the theological principles of Imami Shiism.\n\nIn this paper, I explore the paradigmatic case of the problem of evilthat of the problem of suffering. As a result of many Muslims theologians and academics in contemporary times adopting the approach of theodicy as a way to address the problem of suffering, other considerations have been neglected. One consideration put forth in this paper is to explore how the problem of suffering can be shifted away from being preoccupied with theoretical vindications of Allah's justice and fairness in the face of evil to one that focusses more on how the patient, the person suffering, can construct meaning out of the suffering by utilising the theological resources of their creed.\n\nThis paper sheds light on the treatment of the 'problem of evil' and human suffering from an Islamic perspective. I begin by providing an overview of the term 'evil' in the Qur'an to highlight its multidimensional meaning and to demonstrate the overall portrait of this notion as it is presented in the Islamic revelation through the narrative of the prophet Job. Having established a Qur'anic framework, I will then provide a brief historical overview of the formation of philosophical and theological debates surrounding \" good \" and \" bad/evil \" and the origination of Muslim theodicean thought. This will lead us to Ghaz¯ alian theodicy and the famous dictum of the \" best of all possible worlds \" by one of the most influential scholars of Islamic thought, Abu H. ¯ amid Ghaz¯ al¯ ı. The final section of this paper will explore the Sufi/ mystical tradition of Islam through the teachings of one of the most distinguished mystics of Islam, Jal¯ al al-D¯ ın R ¯ um¯ ı. The conclusion of the paper will attempt to bring about a new understanding of how the so-called \" problem of evil \" is not presented in Islam as a problem but rather as an instrument in the actualization of God's plan, which is intertwined with human experiences in this world—an experience that is necessary for man's spiritual development.\n\nThis article discusses the concept of suffering in the Old Testament. It first looks at passages in the Pentateuch that describe life before the fall, which paints a picture of human existence before suffering. It then examines what the Pentateuch and Proverbs teach about avoiding suffering through living a life of faithful obedience. Next, it examines suffering in the books of Job and Ecclesiastes, which tackle head-on the issue of the suffering of the righteous. It then moves to the New Testament to examine how suffering differs on this side of the cross and how modern-day Christians must live in light of the reality of suffering. The article concludes with few proposals for how to apply the biblical theology of suffering."
