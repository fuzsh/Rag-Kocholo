        "text": "Actor John Enos is happy to be free of his skin cancer but shared a couple of graphic photos of his surgical scars to show just how serious the issue can be. “Got it all!” he declared before adding, “Wear sunscreen! See a dermatologist once a year!” As you can see from the images, the hashtag he used, “#nojoke” is very accurate. He had melanoma on his face and his right forearm, but thankfully the doctors were able to remove it all.\n\nAlthough Enos’ most recent daytime appearance was as an Elvis impersonator on DAYS OF OUR LIVES in 2017, he’s probably best known by soap fans for his run as Bobby Marsino on CBS sudser THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS from 2003-05. Fans may also have seen the actor in primetime on MELROSE PLACE or in guest appearances on shows like NYPD BLUE, CSI: NY, or BLUE BLOODS.\n\nEnos shared the pictures on June 11, one day before celebrating his birthday. And thanks to the skilled doctors and nurses who were able to safely remove the melanomas, he will be around to celebrate many more of them."
