        "text": "Find out what actor Jonathan Medina has to say about playing hilarious Uncle Jay on Primo.\n\nPrimo on Amazon Freevee tells the story of sixteen-year-old Rafa who lives in San Antonio with his mom. Rafa has five uncles who are also a big part of his life. Sometimes Rafa (the delightful Ignacio Diaz-Silverio) struggles with so much input from so many relatives, but at the heart of it is a family that is loyal and loving. The uncles bring so much humor to the story with their unique personalities, sibling rivalry and all hoping to give Rafa the best advice.\n\nInterestingly, sometimes the uncles (Jay, Mondo, Rollie, Mike and Ryan) learn a thing or two from their nephew. And they certainly listen to Rafa’s mom, their sister Drea, played impeccably by Chistina Vidal. In addition to laugh out loud humor, the show offers a lot of good will and appreciation for family.\n\nI spoke with actor Jonathan Medina about playing eldest uncle, Jay. He points out that eldest does not always mean wisest, but Uncle Jay’s intentions are absolutely the best when it comes to his nephew Rafa. Uncle Jay owns the Gonzalez family landscaping business and is very proud of his work and even the company van, which has jokes all of its own!\n\nTune in to hear what Jonathan Medina has to say about the new Freevee comedy and portraying Uncle Jay. More interviews, more uncles will be on the way!\n\nListen to the podcast episode by pressing the play icon at the top of the post or listen via Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or other podcast provider by subscribing to the So Many Shows podcast feed.\n\nThank you so much for tuning in and please follow our continuing coverage of “so many shows”.\n\nMusic courtesy of subscription to zapsplat.com\n\nICYMI: Primo series review: Big on laughs and family – So Many Shows!\n\nStay connected with So Many Shows:\n\nLike us on Facebook!\n\nFollow us on Twitter\n\nSubscribe on YouTube"
