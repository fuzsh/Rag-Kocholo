W.; Septyaningru, E.; Imanuddin, F.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nResearch on the development and innovation of Vertical Axis Hydrokinetic Turbine (VAHT) to improve performance has been done. One of the important indicator that affects VAHTâs performance is Coefficient of Performance (Cp). Theoretical Cp value for the VAT (Darrieus) turbine is 0.45. This paper presents the results of a performance investigation for an innovative Vertical Axis Hydrokinetic Turbine â Straight Blade Cascaded (VAHT-SBC) by modifying the number and the arrangement of blades using CFD simulation. Symmetrical NACA 0018 is used for this study, each model is simulated with current speed variation (U - m/s) of 0.5, 1 and 1.5. An increase in Cp value is shown in variation of 9 blades (3 blades cascaded in each arm) with Cp value of 0.396 at TSR of 2.27 which is reach 88% of the theoretical value. Furthermore, the streamline velocity of the pressure contour, velocity streamline and torque fluctuations are also presented in this paper to gain in deep information.\n\nSemiempirical UNO-CAS and UNO-CI: method and applications in nanoelectronics.\n\nPubMed\n\nDral, Pavlo O; Clark, Timothy\n\n2011-10-20\n\nUnrestricted Natural Orbital-Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction, abbreviated as UNO-CAS, has been implemented for NDDO-based semiempirical molecular-orbital (MO) theory. A computationally more economic technique, UNO-CIS, in which we use a configuration interaction (CI) calculation with only single excitations (CIS) to calculate excited states, has also been implemented and tested. The class of techniques in which unrestricted natural orbitals (UNOs) are used as the reference for CI calculations is denoted UNO-CI. Semiempirical UNO-CI gives good results for the optical band gaps of organic semiconductors such as polyynes and polyacenes, which are promising materials for nanoelectronics. The results of these semiempirical UNO-CI techniques are generally in better agreement with experiment than those obtained with the corresponding conventional semiempirical CI methods and comparable to or better than those obtained with far more computationally expensive methods such as time-dependent density-functional theory. We also show that symmetry breaking in semiempirical UHF calculations is very useful for predicting the diradical character of organic compounds in the singlet spin state.\n\nExamining the potential exploitation of UNOS policies.\n\nPubMed\n\nZink, Sheldon; Wertlieb, Stacey; Catalano, John; Marwin, Victor\n\n2005-01-01\n\nThe United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) waiting list was designed as a just and equitable system through which the limited number of organs is allocated to the millions of Americans in need of a transplant. People have trusted the system because of the belief that everyone on the list has an equal opportunity to receive an organ and also that allocation is blind to matters of financial standing, celebrity or political power. Recent events have revealed that certain practices and policies have the potential to be exploited. The policies addressed in this paper enable those on the list with the proper resources to gain an advantage over other less fortunate members, creating a system that benefits not the individual most in medical need, but the one with the best resources. These policies are not only unethical but threaten the balance and success of the entire UNOS system. This paper proposes one possible solution, which seeks to balance the concepts of justice and utility.\n\nGamma ray spectroscopy with Arduino UNO\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLavelle, C. M.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe review a simple gamma ray spectrometer constructed on a solderless breadboard. The spectrometer's detector consists of a CsI(Tl) scintillator and silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) and its readout is facilitated by an Arduino UNO. The system is low cost and utilizes a minimum of components while still achieving satisfactory charge linearity and noise levels. This instrument can be used in instructional laboratories to introduce both radiation detection and analog signal processing concepts. We also expect it will be of interest to those seeking to introduce gamma spectroscopy to the expanding ecosystem of Arduino hardware.\n\nComparative study of numerical schemes of TVD3, UNO3-ACM and optimized compact scheme\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLee, Duck-Joo; Hwang, Chang-Jeon; Ko, Duck-Kon; Kim, Jae-Wook\n\n1995-01-01\n\nThree different schemes are employed to solve the benchmark problem. The first one is a conventional TVD-MUSCL (Monotone Upwind Schemes for Conservation Laws) scheme. The second scheme is a UNO3-ACM (Uniformly Non-Oscillatory Artificial Compression Method) scheme. The third scheme is an optimized compact finite difference scheme modified by us: the 4th order Runge Kutta time stepping, the 4th order pentadiagonal compact spatial discretization with the maximum resolution characteristics. The problems of category 1 are solved by using the second (UNO3-ACM) and third (Optimized Compact) schemes. The problems of category 2 are solved by using the first (TVD3) and second (UNO3-ACM) schemes. The problem of category 5 is solved by using the first (TVD3) scheme. It can be concluded from the present calculations that the Optimized Compact scheme and the UN03-ACM show good resolutions for category 1 and category 2 respectively.\n\nMaking Americans: UNO Charter Schools and Civic Education.

A.; Tarigan, J. T.; Syarif, M. I.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nTechnological developments today make the combination of science is very common, including in Computer Science and Agriculture to make both of science need each other. This paper aims to develop a control tool for the flow of nutrients of hydroponic plants automatically using Arduino microcontroller and controlled by smartphone. We use an Arduino Uno microcontroller to automatically control the flow of nutrient solution with logic if else. The microcontroller can also send data of fluid level (solution) and temperature around the plant to smartphone android of the owner of the hydroponics plant. The height of the nutrient solution (water) is detected by the Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 and the temperature is detected by the temperature sensor LM35. Data from the sensor will forward into Arduino Uno and displayed in liquid crystal display (LCD) then via wireless fidelity (WIFI) ESP8266 module will transmit the height of the nutrient solution and the temperature around of the plants to Android smartphone.\n\nAerodynamic characteristics of the Fiat UNO car\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCostelli, A.F.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this article is to describe the work conducted in the aerodynamic field throughout the 4-year development and engineering time span required by the project of the UNO car. A description is given of all the parametric studies carried out. Through these studies two types of cars at present in production were defined and the characteristics of a possible future sports version laid down. A movable device, to be fitted in the back window, was also set up and patented. When actuated it reduces soiling of back window. A description is also provided of the measurements made inmoreÂ Â» the car flow field and some considerations are outlined about the method applied. This method is still in development phase but it already permits some considerations and in-depth investigations to be made on the vehicle wake.Â«Â less\n\nDetection of Lock on Radar System Based on Ultrasonic US 100 Sensor And Arduino Uno R3 With Image Processing GUI\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBaskoro, F.; Reynaldo, B. R.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe development of electronics technology especially in the field of microcontroller occurs very rapidly. There have been many applications and useful use of microcontroller in everyday life as well as in laboratory research. In this study used Arduino Uno R3 as microcontroller-based platform ATMega328 as a sensor distance meter to know the distance of an object with high accuracy. The method used is to utilize the function Timer / Counter in Arduino UNO R3. On the Arduino Uno R3 platform, there is ATMEL ATmega328 microcontroller which has a frequency generating speed up to 20 MHz, 16-bit enumeration capability and using C language as its programming. With the Arduino Uno R3 platform, the ATmega328 microcontroller can be programmed with Arduino IDE software that is simpler and easier because it has been supported by libraries and many support programs. The result of this research is distance measurement to know the location of an object using US ultrasonic wave sensor US 100 with Arduino Uno R3 based on ATMega328 microcontroller which then the result will be displayed using Image Processing.\n\nCentral and South America GPS geodesy - CASA Uno\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKellogg, James N.; Dixon, Timothy H.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nIn January 1988, scientists from over 25 organizations in 13 countries and territories cooperated in the largest GPS campaign in the world to date. A total of 43 GPS receivers collected approximately 590 station-days of data in American Samoa, Australia, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, Sweden, United States, West Germany, and Venezuela. The experiment was entitled CASA Uno. Scientific goals of the project include measurements of strain in the northern Andes, subduction rates for the Cocos and Nazca plates beneath Central and South America, and relative motion between the Caribbean plate and South America. A second set of measurements are planned in 1991 and should provide preliminary estimates of crustal deformation and plate motion rates in the region.\n\nCASA Uno GPS orbit and baseline experiments\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSchutz, B. E.; Ho, C. S.; Abusali, P. A. M.; Tapley, B. D.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nCASA Uno data from sites distributed in longitude from Australia to Europe have been used to determine orbits of the GPS satellites. The characteristics of the orbits determined from double difference phase have been evaluated through comparisons of two-week solutions with one-week solutions and by comparisons of predicted and estimated orbits. Evidence of unmodeled effects is demonstrated, particularly associated with the orbit planes that experience solar eclipse. The orbit accuracy has been assessed through the repeatability of unconstrained estimated baseline vectors ranging from 245 km to 5400 km. Both the baseline repeatability and the comparison with independent space geodetic methods give results at the level of 1-2 parts in 100,000,000. In addition, the Mojave/Owens Valley (245 km) and Kokee Park/Ft. Davis (5409 km) estimates agree with VLBI and SLR to better than 1 part in 100,000,000.\n\nStacking up against Alternative Conceptions: Using Uno Cards to Introduce Discourse and Argumentation\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nDunac, Patricia S.; Demi, Kadir\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe engaged secondary science students in a teacher and student constructed Uno card game (UCG) to change their conceptual understanding of the various energy transformations.

The use of ACS712 current sensor as the sensor with arduino uno would find out the power consumption continuously and prevent the theft of electricity because of the use of electricity which has been determined by PLN and the people fetl that it is not enough for every house, so the author made a tool for prevention of theft of electric power by using the arduino uno, buzzer, ACS712 current sensor, lcd, and relay then the power usage can be controlled according to the use to prevent the occurrence of theft of electricity so the use can be seen directly on the lcd 16x2and GSM modem to give information to employees of PLN so that it can reduceelectrical theft by the public.\n\nUNO DMRG CASCI calculations of effective exchange integrals for m-phenylene-bis-methylene spin clusters\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKawakami, Takashi; Sano, Shinsuke; Saito, Toru; Sharma, Sandeep; Shoji, Mitsuo; Yamada, Satoru; Takano, Yu; Yamanaka, Shusuke; Okumura, Mitsutaka; Nakajima, Takahito; Yamaguchi, Kizashi\n\n2017-09-01\n\nTheoretical examinations of the ferromagnetic coupling in the m-phenylene-bis-methylene molecule and its oligomer were carried out. These systems are good candidates for exchange-coupled systems to investigate strong electronic correlations. We studied effective exchange integrals (J), which indicated magnetic coupling between interacting spins in these species. First, theoretical calculations based on a broken-symmetry single-reference procedure, i.e. the UHF, UMP2, UMP4, UCCSD(T) and UB3LYP methods, were carried out with a GAUSSIAN program code under an SR wave function. From these results, the J value by the UHF method was largely positive because of the strong ferromagnetic spin polarisation effect. The J value by the UCCSD(T) and UB3LYP methods improved an overestimation problem by correcting the dynamical electronic correlation. Next, magnetic coupling among these spins was studied using the CAS-based method of the symmetry-adapted multireference methods procedure. Thus, the UNO DMRG CASCI (UNO, unrestricted natural orbital; DMRG, density matrix renormalised group; CASCI, complete active space configuration interaction) method was mainly employed with a combination of ORCA and BLOCK program codes. DMRG CASCI calculations in valence electron counting, which included all orbitals to full valence CI, provided the most reliable result, and support the UB3LYP method for extended systems.\n\nInstrumental Develovement of 50 Meters Free Style Swimming Speed Measurement Based on Microcontroller Arduino Uno\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBadruzaman; Rusdiana, A.; Gilang, M. R.; Martini, T.\n\n2017-03-01\n\nThis study is purposed to make a software and hardware instrument in controlling the velocity of 50 meters free style swimming speed measurement based on microcontroller Arduino Uno. The writer uses 6 participants of advanced 2015 college students of sport education. The materials he uses are electronical series of microcontroller Arduino Uno base, laser sensors shone on light dependent resistor, laser receiver functions as a detector of laser cutting block, cables as connector transfering the data. This device consist of 4 installable censors in every 10 meters with the result of swimming speed showed on the monitors using visual basic 6.0 software. This instrument automatically works when the buzzer is pushed and also runs the timer on the application. For the procedure, the writer asks the participants to swim in free style along 50 meters. When the athlete swims, they will cut the laser of every censors so that it gives a signal to stop the running timer on the monitoring application. The output result the writer gets from this used instrument is to know how fast a swimmer swim in maximum speed, to know the time and distance of acceleration and decelaration that happens. The result of validity instrument shows 0,605 (high), while the reliability is 0,833 (very high).\n\nThe effect of tracking network configuration on GPS baseline estimates for the CASA Uno experiment\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWolf, S. Kornreich; Dixon, T. H.; Freymueller, J. T.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nThe effect of the tracking network on long (greater than 100 km) GPS baseline estimates was estimated using various subsets of the global tracking network initiated by the first Central and South America (CASA Uno) experiment. It was found that best results could be obtained with a global tacking network consisting of three U.S. stations, two sites in the southwestern Pacific, and two sites in Europe. In comparison with smaller subsets, this global network improved the baseline repeatability, the resolution of carrier phase cycle ambiguities, and formal errors of the orbit estimates.\n\nSome tests of wet tropospheric calibration for the CASA Uno Global Positioning System experiment\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nDixon, T. H.; Wolf, S. Kornreich\n\n1990-01-01\n\nWet tropospheric path delay can be a major error source for Global Positioning System (GPS) geodetic experiments. Strategies for minimizing this error are investigted using data from CASA Uno, the first major GPS experiment in Central and South America, where wet path delays may be both high and variable. Wet path delay calibration using water vapor radiometers (WVRs) and residual delay estimation is compared with strategies where the entire wet path delay is estimated stochastically without prior calibration, using data from a 270-km test baseline in Costa Rica. Both approaches yield centimeter-level baseline repeatability and similar tropospheric estimates, suggesting that WVR calibration is not critical for obtaining high precision results with GPS in the CASA region.\n\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons profiles of spent drilling fluids deposited at Emu-Uno, Delta State, Nigeria.\n\nPubMed\n\nIwegbue, Chukwujindu M A\n\n2011-10-01\n\nThe concentrations and profiles of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were determined in spent drilling fluid deposited at Emu-Uno, Delta State of Nigeria. The total concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the spent drilling fluid deposits ranged between 40 and 770 Î¼g kg(-1). The PAHs profile were predominantly 2- and 3-rings with acenaphthalene, phenanthrene, fluorene being the predominant PAHs. The prevalence of 2- and 3-rings PAHs in the spent drilling fluid deposits indicate contamination of the drilling fluids with crude oil during drilling. Incorporation of spent drilling fluids into the soil has serious implication for soil, surface water and groundwater quality.

The paper outlines how we incorporated Toulminâs argumentation pattern (Toulmin 1958 The Uses of Argument (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press)) in the UCG, using discourse (Erduran et al 2004 Sci. Educ. 88 915-33) and through a 5E learning cycle (Bybee 1997 Achieving Scientific Literacy: From Purposes to Practices (Portsmouth, NH: Heinemann Educational Books)). The activity helped students develop a deeper understanding of the energy transformation among and between different sources. Students experienced a conceptual gain in their ways of thinking, in contrast to traditional teaching and learning practices. The collaboration and interaction between teacher-student(s) and between students fostered an environment where they became co-constructors of knowledge.\n\nLiver transplantation for neonatal hemochromatosis: analysis of the UNOS database.\n\nPubMed\n\nSheflin-Findling, Shari; Annunziato, Rachel A; Chu, Jaime; Arvelakis, Antonios; Mahon, Danielle; Arnon, Ronen\n\n2015-03-01\n\nNH is the most common identifiable cause of ALF in the neonate. LT is the definitive treatment for neonates with NH who have failed medical therapy. Our aim was to determine the outcomes of LT in infants with NH. Patients (less than one yr of age) with NH who were listed for LT and patients who underwent LT between 1994 and 2013 were identified from the UNOS database for analysis. Risk factors for death and graft loss were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. Thirty-eight infants with NH with a total of 43 transplants were identified. One- and five-yr patient and graft survival were 84.2%, 81.6%, 71.1%, and 68.4%, respectively. The outcomes for NH were not significantly different when compared to the same age-matched recipients with other causes of ALF. There were no statistically significant risk factors identified for graft loss or death. Ninety infants with NH were listed for LT. Reasons for removal included transplanted (49%), death (27%), too sick to transplant (7%), and improved status (13%). LT for infants with NH has a high rate of graft loss and death; however, outcomes are comparable to the same age-matched recipients with other causes of ALF. Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In this study, we attempted to determine if patients with ESLD, due to oncologic or autoimmune diseases, are susceptible to thrombosis to a greater extent than patients with ESLD due to other causes. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the UNOS database to determine the incidence of thrombotic complications in orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) recipients with autoimmune and oncologic conditions. Between 2000 and 2012, 65,646 OLTs were performed. We found 4,247 cases of preoperative portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and 1,233 cases of postoperative vascular thrombosis (VT) leading to graft failure. Statistical evaluation demonstrated that patients with either hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or autoimmune hepatitis (AIC) had a higher incidence of PVT (pâ=â0.05 and 0.03 respectively). Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and AIC had a higher incidence of postoperative VT associated with graft failure (pâ<â0.0001, pâ<â0.0001, pâ=â0.05 respectively). Patients with preoperative PVT had a higher incidence of postoperative VT (pâ<â0.0001). Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that patients with AIC, and BMI â¥40, having had a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and those with diabetes mellitus were more likely to have preoperative PVT: odds ratio (OR)(1.36, 1.19, 1.78, 1.22 respectively). Patients with PSC, PBC, AIC, BMI â¤18, or with a preoperative PVT were more likely to have a postoperative VT: OR (1.93, 2.09, 1.64, 1.60, and 2.01, respectively). Despite the limited number of variables available in the UNOS database potentially related to thrombotic complications, this analysis demonstrates a clear association between autoimmune causes of ESLD and perioperative thrombotic complications. Perioperative management of patients at risk should include strategies to reduce the potential for these\n\nNear field communication (NFC) model for arduino uno based security systems office system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChairunnas, A.; Abdurrasyid, I.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nCurrently, many offices or companies that start growing rapidly in a company or office should have a very limited room to enter only people entitled to enter the room and use the facilities contained in it, for example, Files in it must have many files and documents very important because to reduce the abuse of files and irresponsible person.

United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) data were used to examine utilization of pancreas transplant and posttransplant outcomes in CF patients. Between 1987-2014, CF patients (N = 4600) underwent 17 liver-pancreas, three lung-pancreas, one liver-lung pancreas, four kidney-pancreas, and three pancreas-only transplants. Of the 303 CF patients who received liver transplantation, 20% had CF-related diabetes (CFRD) before transplantation, and nine of those received a liver-pancreas transplant. Of 4241 CF patients who underwent lung transplantation, 33% had CFRD before transplantation, and three of those received a pancreas transplant. Of 49 CF patients who received a liver-lung transplant, 57% had CFRD before transplantation and one received a pancreas transplant. Posttransplantation diabetes developed in 7% of CF pancreas transplant recipients versus 24% of CF liver and 29% of CF lung recipients. UNOS has no data on pancreas exocrine insufficiency. Two-year posttransplantation survival was 88% after liver-pancreas transplant, 33% after lung-pancreas transplant, and 100% after pancreas-kidney and pancreas-only transplants. Diabetes is common pretransplantation and posttransplantation in CF solid organ transplant recipients, but pancreas transplantation remains rare. Further consideration of pancreas transplant in CF patients undergoing other solid organ transplant may be warranted.

The algorithm uses differenced data from one station and two to four GPS satellites at a series of epochs separated by 30 second intervals. The precise GPS ephemerides and satellite clock states, held fixed in the estimation process, are those estimated by the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC). Broadcast ephemerides and clock states are alsomoreÂ Â» utilized for comparative purposes. An outline of the data corrections applied, the mathematical model and the estimation algorithm are presented. Point positioning results and statistics are presented for a globally-distributed set of stations which contributed to the CASA Uno experiment. Statistical assessment of 114 GPS point positions at 11 CASA Uno stations indicates that the overall standard deviation of a point position component, estimated from a few hours of data, is 73 centimeters. Solution of the long line geodetic inverse problem using repeated point positions such as these can potentially offer a new tool for those studying geodynamics on a global scale.Â«Â less\n\n[Stinging nettle root extract (Bazoton-uno) in long term treatment of benign prostatic syndrome (BPS). Results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled multicenter study after 12 months].\n\nPubMed\n\nSchneider, T; RÃ¼bben, H\n\n2004-03-01\n\nPhytotherapy of BPS has a long tradition in Germany; nevertheless, data referring to single phytotherapeutic agents are rare. We therefore performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study for 1 year with Bazoton uno (459 mg dry extract of stinging nettle roots) with 246 patients. The IPSS decreased on average from 18.7+/-0.3 to 13.0+/-0.5 with a statistically significant difference compared to placebo (18.5+/-0.3 to 13.8+/-0.5; p=0.0233). The median Q(max) increased by 3.0+/-0.4 ml/s in comparison to 2.9+/-0.4 ml/s (placebo), thus not statistically significantly different, as well as the median volume of residual urine, which changed from 35.5+/-3.4 ml before therapy to 20.0+/-2.8 ml and from 40.0+/-4.0 ml to 21.0+/-2.9 ml under placebo application. The number of adverse events (29/38) as well as urinary infections etc. (3/10 events) was smaller under Bazoton uno therapy compared to placebo. Treatment with Bazoton uno can therefore be considered a safe therapeutic option for BPS, especially for reducing irritative symptoms and BPS-associated complications due to the postulated antiphlogistic and antiproliferative effects of the stinging nettle extract. A strong increase of Q(max) or reduction of residual urine are not to be expected.\n\nMoessbauer spectrometer based on UNO-4096-90 accumulator and Elektronika D3-28 microcomputer for simultaneous recording of four spectra\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRomanov, E.S.; Ivoilov, N.G.\n\nA buffer memory unit and an interface for the UNO-4096-90 accumulator with an Elektronika D3-28 microcomputer are described that allow simultaneous recording of four Moessbauer spectra with zero dead time. For complete elimination of dead time, the pulses from each detector are fed to two buffer counters units, which operate alternately in the write and interrogate modes. This organization of the buffer memory also completely eliminates the effect of the sensors on one another. The use of these circuits does not require any modifications of the computer or accumulator.\n\nArduino Uno Microcontroller with Commercially Available Sensors Towards Generating Student Accessible Raw Meteorological Data\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHenson, Gabrielle; Tanner, Meghan; Senevirathne, Indrajith\n\nMicrocontroller systems can be a boon to cost - effective techniques that can be used to enhance teaching at college level. We have used Arduino microcontroller coupled with commercially available sensors to systematically measure, record and analyze temperature, humidity and barometric pressure and to upload the real time raw data to cloud. Corresponding data will be available in classroom settings for predictions, analysis and simple weather forecasting. Setup was assembled via breadboard, wire and simple soldering with an Arduino Uno ATmega328P microcontroller connected to a PC. The microcontroller was programmed with Arduino Software while the bootloader was used to upload the code. Commercial DHT22 humidity and temperature sensor and BMP180 barometric pressure sensor were used to obtain relative humidity, temperature and the barometric pressure. System was mounted inside a weather resistant enclosure and data measurements were obtained and were uploaded onto the PC and then to cloud. Cloud data can be accessed via a shared link in a General Education class for multitude of purposes.\n\nDesigning using Lego and Uno-Stacko: A Playful Architecture for an Integrated Kindergarten and Elementary School\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMuthmainnah, K.; Aryanti, T.; Ardiansyah, A.\n\n2017-03-01\n\nThe integrated kindergarten and elementary school is a public educational facility used for early age and elementary education. Designated for children at 4-12 years of age, the design should meet the standards and requirements, while considering childrenâs needs in their development phase. This paper discusses the design of an integrated kindergarten and elementary school using the playful theme. Design was explored using LEGO and UNO-STACKO to create spaces that accommodate material exploration for children. The design takes the play concept as a medium of childâs learning in order to improve their ability and awareness of the surrounding environment. The design translates the playful theme into imaginary dimension, constructive-deconstructive shapes, and glide circulations concept. The spatial pattern is applied by considering childrenâs behavior in the designated ages to trigger their creativity improvement. The design is expected to serve as a model of an integrated kindergarten and elementary school architecture.\n\nOutcomes following Kidney transplantation in IgA nephropathy: a UNOS/OPTN analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nKadiyala, Aditya; Mathew, Anna T; Sachdeva, Mala; Sison, Cristina P; Shah, Hitesh H; Fishbane, Steven; Jhaveri, Kenar D\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThis study updates assessment of post-transplant outcomes in IgAN patients in the modern era of immunosuppression. Using UNOS/OPTN data, patients â¥18Â yr of age with first kidney transplant (1/1/1999 to 12/31/2008) were analyzed. Multivariable Cox regression models and propensity score-based matching techniques were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for death-censored allograft survival (DCGS) and patient survival in IgAN compared to non-IgAN. Results of multivariable regression were stratified by donor type (living vs. deceased). A total of 107, 747 recipients were included (4589 with IgAN and 103Â 158 with non-IgAN). Adjusted HR for DCGS showed no significant difference between IgAN and non-IgAN. IgAN had higher patient survival compared to non-IgAN (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.47-0.62, pÂ <Â 0.0001 for deceased donors; HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.33-0.54, pÂ <Â 0.0001 for living donors). Propensity score-matched analysis was similar, with no significant difference in DCGS between matched groups and higher patient survival in IgAN patients compared to non-IgAN group (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.47, 0.63; p-value <0.0001). IgAN patients with first kidney transplant have superior patient survival and similar graft survival compared to non-IgAN recipients. Results can be used in prognostication and informed decision-making about kidney transplantation in patients with IgAN. Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

These include serious engineering and physical science applications due to their versatility and robustness. An Arduino microcontroller coupled with a commercially available sensor has been used to methodically measure, record, and explore low currents, low voltages, and corresponding dissipated power towards assessing secondary physical properties in a select set of engineered systems. System was assembled via breadboard, wire, and simple soldering with an Arduino Uno with ATmega328P microcontroller connected to a PC. The microcontroller was programmed with Arduino software while the bootloader was used to upload the code. High-side measurement INA169 current shunt monitor was used to measure corresponding low to ultra-low currents and voltages. A collection of measurements was obtained via the sensor and was compared with measurements from standardized devices to assess reliability and uncertainty. Some sensors were modified/hacked to improve the sensitivity of the measurements.\n\nDesign prototype detection tools of Porous Tree using microcontroller Arduino Uno R3 and piezoelectric sensor\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSujadi, H.; Bastian, A.; Tira\n\n2018-05-01\n\nIn the city, many trees are found uprooted and cause accidents and many losses. No exception in the area of Majalengka Regency of West Java Province which can also anytime an accident or disaster caused by fallen trees, where in Majalengka district is logging trees on the street and public places are not done regularly. Based on the above problems, the need for tools that can detect a porous tree, to assist in the sorting of trees which should be felled and not felled by the party who has the authority of the general management of BMCK. Previously created tools to detect porous trees imported from Hungary and Germany, namely Arbosonic3D and Sonic Tomography. This design uses piezoelectric sensors to detect how much pressure is received by fragile and fragile trees, of course the fragile and fragile strength of trees will be different when exposed to the same pressure given the fragile density of fragile and fragile trees, then the data sent to Arduino Uno R3 to be processed into an information. This research produces a means of detecting the loss of a tree for early detection and no falling trees.\n\nEnhanced low current, voltage, and power dissipation measurements via Arduino Uno microcontroller with modified commercially available sensors\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTanner, Meghan; Eckel, Ryan; Senevirathne, Indrajith\n\nThe versatility, simplicity, and robustness of Arduino microcontroller architecture have won a huge following with increasingly serious engineering and physical science applications.

However, the analysis of pancreas transplantation outcomes based on age groupings has largely been based on single-center reports. A UNOS database review of all adult pancreas and kidney-pancreas transplants between 1996 and 2012 was performed. Patients were divided into groups based on age categories: 18-29 (nÂ =Â 1823), 30-39 (nÂ =Â 7624), 40-49 (nÂ =Â 7967), 50-59 (nÂ =Â 3160), and â¥60 (nÂ =Â 280). We compared survival outcomes and demographic variables between each age grouping. Of the 20Â 854 pancreas transplants, 3440 of the recipients were 50Â yr of age or above. Graft survival was consistently the greatest in adults 40-49Â yr of age. Graft survival was least in adults age 18-29 at one-, three-, and five-yr intervals. At 10- and 15-yr intervals, graft survival was the poorest in adults >60Â yr old. Patient survival and age were found to be inversely proportional; as the patient population's age increased, survival decreased. Pancreas transplants performed in patients of increasing age demonstrate decreased patient and graft survival when compared to pancreas transplants in patients <50Â yr of age.

We performed a review of 190 super-obese patients undergoing kidney transplantation from 1988 through 2013 using the UNOS dataset. Super-obese patients had a mean age of 45.7Â years (21-75Â years) and 111 (58.4Â %) were female. The mean BMI of the super-obese group was 56 (range 50.0-74.2). A subgroup analysis demonstrated that patients with BMIÂ >Â 50 had worse survival compared to any other BMI class. The 30-day perioperative mortality and length of stay was 3.7Â % and 10.09Â days compared to 0.8Â % and 7.34Â days in nonsuper-obese group. On multivariable analysis, BMIÂ >Â 50 was an independent predictor of 30-day mortality, with a 4.6-fold increased risk of perioperative death. BMIÂ >Â 50 increased the risk of delayed graft function and the length of stay by twofold. The multivariable analysis of survival showed a 78Â % increased risk of death in this group. Overall patient survival for super-obese transplant recipients at 1, 3, and 5Â years was 88, 82, and 76Â %, compared to 96, 91, 86Â % on patients transplanted with BMIÂ <Â 50. A propensity score adjusted analysis further demonstrates significant worse survival rates in super-obese patients undergoing kidney transplantation. Super-obese patients had prolonged LOS and worse DGF rates. Perioperative mortality was increased 4.6-fold compared to patients with BMIÂ <Â 50. In a subgroup analysis, super-obese patients who underwent kidney transplantation had significantly worse graft and patient survival compared to underweight, normal weight, and obesity class I, II, and III (BMI 40-50) patients.\n\nNew OPTN/UNOS classification system for nodules in cirrhotic livers detected with MR imaging: effect on hepatocellular carcinoma detection and transplantation allocation.\n\nPubMed\n\nRosenkrantz, Andrew B; Campbell, Naomi; Wehrli, Natasha; Triolo, Michael J; Kim, Sooah\n\n2015-02-01\n\nTo assess the effect of the new Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN)/United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) policy on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) detection and liver transplant allocation in patients with cirrhosis undergoing dynamic contrast material-enhanced liver magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. In this HIPAA-compliant institutional review board-approved retrospective study with waiver of informed consent, 247 patients (196 men, 51 women; mean age, 60 years Â± 11 [standard deviation]) with liver cirrhosis who underwent evaluation for HCC with MR imaging were identified via database search. Three radiologists independently reviewed images and identified number and size of HCC based on criteria within either the prior or revised policy. Based on these interpretations, priority for liver transplantation for each patient was determined with prior and revised transplantation allocation criteria. HCC detection was compared between sessions by using McNemar tests, and interreader agreement for detection of at least one HCC was assessed by using Îº coefficients. All three readers detected significantly more 1-2-cm HCCs with the revised policy (readers detected 22, eight, and 20 1-2-cm HCCs) versus the prior policy (no reader detected 1-2-cm HCCs) (P â¤ .031). All readers detected significantly fewer 2-5-cm HCCs with the revised policy (readers detected eight, 13, and 14 2-5-cm HCCs) versus the prior policy (readers detected 24, 21, and 24 2-5-cm HCCs) (P â¤ .027). For all readers, fewer patients met criteria for increased transplantation priority with the revised versus the prior policy (number of patients who received increased priority for the three readers were 4.9% [12 of 247] vs 9.3% [23 of 247]; 5.7% [14 of 247] vs 8.1% [20 of 247]; and 6.9% [17 of 247] vs 8.9% [22 of 247]).

Data were procured from the Standard Transplant Analysis and Research dataset files. Donors with CNS tumors were identified, and recipients from these donors comprised the study group (Group I). The remaining recipients of organs from donors who did not have CNS tumors formed the control group (Group II). Incidence of recipient CNS tumors, donor-related malignancies, and overall survival were calculated and compared in addition to multivariable logistic regression. A cohort of 58Â 314 adult thoracic organ recipients were included, of which 337 received organs from donors who had documented CNS tumors (Group I). None of these recipients developed CNS tumors at a median follow-up of 72Â months (IR: 30-130Â months). Although overall mortality in terms of the percentage was higher in Group I than Group II (163/320=51% vs 22Â 123/52Â 691=42%), Kaplan-Meier curves indicate no significant difference in the time to death between the two groups (P=.92). There is little risk of transmission of the common nonaggressive CNS tumors to recipients of thoracic organs. Â© 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We aimed to evaluate long-term outcomes in patients undergoing LT for HCC-CC versus patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or cholangiocarcinoma (CC). Retrospective analysis of the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database from 1994-2013. Overall survival (OS) in patients with HCC-CC, HCC, and CC, were compared. We identified 4049 patients transplanted for primary malignancy (94 HCC-CC; 3515 HCC; 440 CC). Mean age of patients with HCC-CC was 57 Â± 10 years, and 77% were male. MELD score did not differ among the groups (p = 0.637). Hepatitis C virus was the most common secondary diagnosis within the HCC-CC (44%) and HCC (36%) cohorts, with primary sclerosing cholangitis in the CC (16%) cohort. OS rates at 1, 3 and 5 years for HCC-CC (82%, 47%, 40%) were similar to CC (79%, 58%, 47%), but significantly worse than HCC (86%, 72%, and 62% p = 0.002). Patients undergoing LT for HCC had significantly better survival compared to those transplanted for HCC-CC and CC. LT for mixed HCC-CC confers a survival rate similar to selected patients with CC. Efforts should be made to identify HCC-CC patients preoperatively. Copyright Â© 2015.

The major error source in these measurements is the uncertainty in the position of the GPS satellites at the time of observation. A key aspect of the first CASA experiment, CASA Uno, was the initiation of a global network of tracking stations minimize these errors. The authors studied the effect of using various subsets of this global tracking network on long (>100 km)moreÂ Â» baseline estimates in the CASA region. Best results were obtained with a global tracking network consisting of three U.S. fiducial stations, two sites in the southwest pacific and two sites in Europe. Relative to smaller subsets, this global network improved baseline repeatability, resolution of carrier phase cycle ambiguities, and formal errors of the orbit estimates. Describing baseline repeatability for horizontal components as {sigma}=(a{sup 2} + b{sup 2}L{sup 2}){sup 1/2} where L is baseline length, the authors obtained a = 4 and 9 mm and b = 2.8{times}10{sup {minus}8} and 2.3{times}10{sup {minus}8} for north and east components, respectively, on CASA baselines up to 1,000 km in length with this global network.Â«Â less\n\nThe Impact of Socioeconomic Status on Patients Supported with a Left Ventricular Assist Device: An Analysis of the UNOS Database\n\nPubMed Central\n\nClerkin, Kevin J.; Garan, A.

This study sought to determine if SES is associated with decreased waitlist survival while on LVAD support and after HT. Methods and Results 3,361 adult patients bridged to primary HT with an LVAD between May 2004 and April 2014 were identified in the UNOS database. SES was measured using the AHRQ SES index using data from the 2014 American Community Survey. In the study cohort, SES did not have an association with the combined endpoint of death or delisting on LVAD support (p=0.30). In a cause-specific unadjusted model, those in the top (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.14â2.11, p=0.005) and second greatest SES quartile (HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.10â2.04, p=0.01) had an increased risk of death on device support compared to the lowest SES quartile. Adjusting for clinical risk factors mitigated the increased risk. There was no association between SES and complications. Post-HT survival, both crude and adjusted, was decreased for patients in the lowest quartile of SES index compared to all other SES quartiles. Conclusions Freedom from waitlist death or delisting was not impacted by SES. Patients with a higher SES had an increased unadjusted risk of waitlist mortality during LVAD support, which was mitigated by adjusting for increased comorbid conditions. Low SES was associated with worse post-HT outcomes. Further study is needed to confirm and understand a differential effect of SES on post-transplant outcomes that was not seen during LVAD support prior to HT.

However, steroid withdrawal may be associated with an increased risk of recurrent IgA nephropathy (IgAN). Using United Network of (Organ Sharing/Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network) UNOS/OPTN data, we analyzed adult patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to IgAN who received their first kidney transplant between 2000 and 2014. For the primary outcome, we used a competing risk analysis to compare the cumulative incidence of graft loss due to IgAN recurrence between early steroid-withdrawal (ESW) and steroid continuation groups. The secondary outcomes were patient survival and death-censored graft survival (DCGS). A total of 9690 recipients were included (2831 in ESW group and 6859 in steroid continuation group). In total, 1238 recipients experienced graft loss, of which 191 (15.43%) were due to IgAN recurrence. In multivariable analysis, steroid use was associated with a decreased risk of recurrence (subdistribution hazard ratio 0.666, 95% CI 0.482-0.921; PÂ =Â 0.014). Patient survival and DCGS were not different between the two groups. In the USA, ESW in transplant for ESRD due to IgAN is associated with a higher risk of graft loss due to disease recurrence. Future prospective studies are warranted to further address which patients with IgAN would benefit from steroid continuation.

The program is based on unconstrained minimization subroutine, VA02A. The program considers the mass values of the gravimetric standards as parameters to be fit along with the normal calibration curve parameters. The fitting procedure weights with the system errors and the mass errors in a consistent way. The resulting best fit calibration curve parameters reflect the fact that the masses of the standard samples are measured quantities withmoreÂ Â» a known error. Error estimates for the calibration curve parameters can be obtained from the curvature of the ''Chi-Squared Matrix'' or from error relaxation techniques. It was shown that nondispersive XRFA of 0.1 to 1 mg freeze-dried UNO/sub 3/ can have an accuracy of 0.2% in 1000 s.Â«Â less\n\nComparison of Early versus Delayed Timing of Left Ventricular Assist Device Implantation as a Bridge-to-Transplantation: An Analysis of the UNOS Dataset\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJin, Zhezhen; Clerkin, Kevin; Homma, Shunichi; Mancini, Donna M.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground Placement of left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) as a bridge-to-heart transplantation (HTx) has rapidly expanded due to organ donor shortage. However, the timing of LVAD implantation is variable and it remains unclear if earlier implantation improves survival. Methods We analyzed 14,187 adult candidates from the United Network of Organ Sharing database. Patients were classified by 3 treatment strategies including patients medically treated alone (MED, n=11,009), patients on LVAD support at listing (Early-LVAD, n=1588) and patients undergoing LVAD placement while awaiting HTx (Delayed-LVAD, n=1590). Likelihood of HTx and event-free survival were assessed in patients subcategorized by clinical strategies and UNOS status at listing. Results The device support strategy, despite the timing of placement, was not associated with increased likelihood of HTx compared to MED group. However, both LVAD implantation strategies showed better survival compared to MED group (Early-LVAD: HR 0.811 and 0.633, 95% CI 0.668-0.984 and 0.507-0.789, for 1A and 1B; p=0.034 and p<0.001, Delayed-LVAD: HR 0.553 and 0.696, 95% CI 0.415-0.736 and 0.571-0.847, for 1A and 1B; both p<0.001, respectively). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in survival between these LVAD implantation strategies in patients listed as 1B (p=0.500), although Early-LVAD implantation showed worse survival in patients listed as 1A (HR 1.467, 95% CI 1.076-2.000; p=0.015). Conclusion LVAD support strategies offer a safe bridge-to-HTx. Those candidates who receive urgent upfront LVAD implantation for HTx, and improve to 1B status, would achieve competitive survival with those who receive elective LVAD implantation.

However, the timing of LVAD implantation is variable and it remains unclear if earlier implantation improves survival. We analyzed 14,187 adult candidates from the United Network of Organ Sharing database. Patients were classified by 3 treatment strategies including patients medically treated alone (MED, n=11,009), patients on LVAD support at listing (Early-LVAD, n=1588) and patients undergoing LVAD placement while awaiting HTx (Delayed-LVAD, n=1590). Likelihood of HTx and event-free survival were assessed in patients subcategorized by clinical strategies and UNOS status at listing. The device support strategy, despite the timing of placement, was not associated with increased likelihood of HTx compared to MED group. However, both LVAD implantation strategies showed better survival compared to MED group (Early-LVAD: HR 0.811 and 0.633, 95% CI 0.668-0.984 and 0.507-0.789, for 1A and 1B; p=0.034 and p<0.001, Delayed-LVAD: HR 0.553 and 0.696, 95% CI 0.415-0.736 and 0.571-0.847, for 1A and 1B; both p<0.001, respectively).

This study sought to determine whether SES is associated with decreased waitlist survival while on left ventricular assist device (LVADs) support and after HT. A total of 3361 adult patients bridged to primary HT with an LVAD between May 2004 and April 2014 were identified in the UNOS database (United Network for Organ Sharing). SES was measured using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality SES index using data from the 2014 American Community Survey. In the study cohort, SES did not have an association with the combined end point of death or delisting on LVAD support (P=0.30). In a cause-specific unadjusted model, those in the top (hazard ratio, 1.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-2.11; P=0.005) and second greatest SES quartile (hazard ratio 1.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.04; P=0.01) had an increased risk of death on device support compared with the lowest SES quartile. Adjusting for clinical risk factors mitigated the increased risk. There was no association between SES and complications. Post-HT survival, both crude and adjusted, was decreased for patients in the lowest quartile of SES index compared with all other SES quartiles. Freedom from waitlist death or delisting was not affected by SES. Patients with a higher SES had an increased unadjusted risk of waitlist mortality during LVAD support, which was mitigated by adjusting for increased comorbid conditions. Low SES was associated with worse post-HT outcomes. Further study is needed to confirm and understand a differential effect of SES on post-transplant outcomes that was not seen during LVAD support before HT.

We included all adults in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients placed on the heart transplant active waitlist from 2004 to 2015. The primary end point was all-cause mortality. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were performed to evaluate survival by United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) status at the time of listing. Random survival forest was used to identify sex interactions for the competing risk of death and transplantation. There were 33â069 patients (25% women) awaiting heart transplantation. This cohort included 7681 UNOS status 1A (26% women), 13â027 UNOS status 1B (25% women), and 12â361 UNOS status 2 (26% women). During a median follow-up of 4.3 months, 1351 women and 4052 men died. After adjusting for >20 risk factors, female sex was associated with a significant risk of death among UNOS status 1A (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.29) and UNOS status 1B (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.30). In contrast, female sex was significantly protective for time to death among UNOS status 2 (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.95). Sex differences in probability of transplantation were present for every UNOS status, and >20 sex interactions were identified for mortality and transplantation. When stratified by initial UNOS status, women had a higher mortality than men as UNOS status 1 and a lower mortality as UNOS status 2. With >20 sex interactions for mortality and transplantation, further evaluation is warranted to form a more equitable allocation system.

K. A. P.; Arief, I. S.; Ismail, A.; Manggala, S. W.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThis study examines an innovative turbine with the addition of the number and arrangement of straight blade cascaded (SBC). SBC is a combination of passive variable-pitch and fixed pitch of each turbine arm. This study was conducted in an open channel flow that has a current velocity (V-m/s) of 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3. RPM and torque ware measured for coefficient of performance (Cp) and tip speed ratio (TSR) calculation. Without changing the turbine dimension, the employment of cascaded blade (three blades in each arm) contributes to improve energy extraction significantly. A significant increase in Cp value is seen when 9 blades (3 cascaded blades per arm) are used with a Cp 0.42 value at TSR 2.19. This value has reached 93% of the maximum theoritical Cp value.\n\nImpact of long term left ventricular assist device therapy on donor allocation in cardiac transplantation.\n\nPubMed\n\nUriel, Nir; Jorde, Ulrich P; Woo Pak, Sang; Jiang, Jeff; Clerkin, Kevin; Takayama, Hiroo; Naka, Yoshifumi; Schulze, P Christian; Mancini, Donna M\n\n2013-02-01\n\nLeft Ventricular Assist Devices (LVAD) are increasingly used as a bridge to transplant (BTT) for patients with advanced congestive heart failure (CHF) and are assigned United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) high priority status (1B or 1A). The purpose of our study was asses the effect of organ allocation in the era of continuous flow pumps. A retrospective chart review was performed of all patients transplanted between 1/2001-1/2011 at Columbia University Medical Center. Seven hundred twenty six adult heart transplantations were performed. Two hundred seventy four BTT patients were implanted with LVAD; of which 227 patients were transplanted. Sixty three patients were transplanted as UNOS-1B, while 164 were transplanted as UNOS-1A (72%). Of these 164 patients, 65 were transplanted during their 30-day 1A period (43%) and 96 after upgrading to UNOS-1A for device complication (56%). For 452 non-device patients 139 (31%) were transplanted as UNOS-1A, 233 as UNOS-1B (52%), and 80 as UNOS-2 (17%). The percentage of patients bridged with LVAD increased from 19% in 2001 to 64% in 2010 while the number transplanted during their 30 day 1A grace period declined from 57% in 2005 to 16% in 2011; i.e. 84% of BTT patients in 2011 needed more than 30 days 1A time to be transplanted. Most LVAD patients are now transplanted while suffering device complication. There was no difference in post transplant survival between LVAD patients transplanted as UNOS 1B, 1A grace period or for a device complication As wait time for cardiac transplantation increased the percentage of patients being bridged to transplant with an LVAD has increased with the majority of them transplanted in the setting of device complication.

More patients are being placed on the transplant waiting list, although the waiting list patients still only represent a very small fraction of ESRD patients. The characteristics of both waitlisted and transplanted patients have changed considerably in the last decade, as the ESRD population has aged and waiting list times have increased. Over the last 10 years, we have witnessed an increasingly severe shortage of kidney donors. Even with increasing efforts of the transplant community to expand the donor pool by including larger numbers of high risk deceased donor transplants, the overall number of kidney transplants has remained relatively stable. Those who do receive transplants, however, benefit from excellent transplant outcomes. The use of paired exchange/chain transplant donors has increased the living donor pool significantly and with outstanding results. Belatacept, a costimulation blockage drug, represents a new class of transplant immunosuppression. It has been used sparingly in the first few years of its approval. Most kidney transplant patients are still maintained on immunosuppressive agents that were approved almost two decades ago. In the next decade, we will certainly continue to deal with an organ shortage as the number of eligible and waitlisted patients is likely to increase. Effective and efficient organ allocation policies will be increasingly necessary to address this scarcity. Optimizing the transplant candidate work-up, improving maintenance of waitlisted patients, and providing optimal post-transplant medical care will be vital to the continued success of kidney transplantation.\n\nThe UNO Aviation Monograph Series: The Airline Quality Rating 1997\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBowen, Brent D.; Headley, Dean E.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThe Airline Quality Rating (AQR) was developed and first announced in early 1991 as an objective method of comparing airline performance on combined multiple factors important to consumers.

The 2006 UNOS thoracic organ allocation policy change was implemented to allow for greater regional sharing of organs for heart transplantation. We analyzed 36,789 patients who were listed for heart transplantation from January 1999 through April 2012. These patients were separated into 2 eras centered on the July 12, 2006 UNOS policy change. Pre- and post-transplantation characteristics were compared by UNOS regions. Waitlist mortality decreased nationally (up to 180 days: 13.3% vs. 7.9% after the UNOS policy change, pÂ < 0.001) and within each region. Similarly, 2-year post-transplant mortality decreased nationally (2-year mortality: 17.3% vs. 14.6%; pÂ < 0.001) as well as regionally. Waitlist time for UNOS status 1A and 1B candidates increased nationally 17.8 days on average (pÂ < 0.001) with variability between the regions. The greatest increases were in Region 9 (59.2-day increase, pÂ < 0.001) and Region 4 (41.2-day increase, pÂ < 0.001). Although the use of mechanical circulatory support increased nearly 2.3-fold nationally in Era 2, significant differences were present on a regional basis. In Regions 6, 7, and 10, nearly 40% of those transplanted required left ventricular assist device bridging, whereas only 19.6%, 22.3%, and 15.5% required a left ventricular assist device in regions 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The 2006 UNOS policy change has resulted in significant regional heterogeneity with respect to waitlist time and reliance on mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to transplantation, although overall both waitlist mortality and post-transplant survival are improved.

The usual procedures start with a multiconfigurational (usually a Complete Active Space, CAS) wavefunction which accounts for static correlation and add dynamical correlation by perturbation theory, configuration interaction, or coupled cluster expansion. This procedure requires the correct selection of the active space. Intuitive methods are unreliable for complex systems. The inexpensive black-box unrestricted natural orbital (UNO) criterion postulates that the Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) charge natural orbitals with fractional occupancy (e.g., between 0.02 and 1.98) constitute the active space. UNOs generally approximate the CAS orbitals so well that the orbital optimization in CAS Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF) may be omitted, resulting in the inexpensive UNO-CAS method. A rigorous testing of the UNO criterion requires comparison with approximate full configuration interaction wavefunctions. This became feasible with the advent of Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) methods which can approximate highly correlated wavefunctions at affordable cost. We have compared active orbital occupancies in UNO-CAS and CASSCF calculations with DMRG in a number of strongly correlated molecules: compounds of electronegative atoms (F2, ozone, and NO2), polyenes, aromatic molecules (naphthalene, azulene, anthracene, and nitrobenzene), radicals (phenoxy and benzyl), diradicals (o-, m-, and p-benzyne), and transition metal compounds (nickel-acetylene and Cr2). The UNO criterion works well in these cases. Other symmetry breaking solutions, with the possible exception of spatial symmetry, do not appear to be essential to generate the correct active space. In the case of multiple UHF solutions, the natural orbitals of the average UHF density should be used. The problems of the UNO criterion and their potential solutions are discussed\n\nA Review of the Electronic Coursework Efforts of the University of Nebraska-Omaha in the Earth System Science Education Alliance\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShuster, R. D.; Grandgenett, N.\n\n2007-12-01\n\nThe University of Nebraska at Omaha has been a state leader in helping Nebraska teachers embrace earth systems science education, with a special emphasis in online coursework. UNO was one of the initial members in the Earth Systems Science Education Alliance (ESSEA) and has offered three different ESSEA courses, with a total of 167 students having taken ESSEA courses at UNO for graduate credit. UNO is currently involved in expanding its earth system science courses, modules, and educational research. We are also integrating these courses into several degree programs, including a Masters of Science in Education, a new Middle School Endorsement, a Certificate in Urban Education, and the Graduate Program for the Department of Geography/Geology. UNO is beginning to examine teacher content learning and science reasoning within its coursework. Feedback surveys from earlier ESSEA offerings already indicate a strongly positive perception of the courses by the teachers enrolled in the coursework. Project impact has been documented in teacher projects, quotes, and lessons associated with the coursework activities. We will describe the UNO earth system science efforts (emphasizing ESSEA coursework), and describe past efforts and teacher perceptions, as well as new strategies being undertaken to more closely examine content learning and science reasoning impact with course participants. We will also describe online course modules being developed within the UNO online course efforts, including one on the global amphibian crisis, and also the impact of urbanization on a local native prairie environment.\n\nMatching Organs\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... to enews Follow Facebook Twitter LinkedIn YouTube Instagram Google+ Contact 700 N. 4th Street Richmond, VA 23219 ( ... com/UnitedNetworkForOrganSharing https://twitter.com/unosnews https://plus.google.com/+UnosOrg https://www.linkedin.com/company/unos\n\nTypes of Cancer Associated with Transplant Recipients\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... work or school Physical changes Relationship changes Sexuality changes Managing comorbidities People to know FAQ Living donation What ...

A rigorous testing of the UNO criterion requires comparison with approximate full configuration interaction wavefunctions. This became feasible with the advent of Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) methods which can approximate highly correlated wavefunctions at affordable cost. We have compared active orbital occupancies in UNO-CAS and CASSCF calculations with DMRG in a number of strongly correlated molecules: compounds of electronegative atoms (F{sub 2}, ozone, and NO{sub 2}), polyenes, aromatic molecules (naphthalene, azulene, anthracene, and nitrobenzene), radicals (phenoxy and benzyl), diradicals (o-, m-, and p-benzyne), and transition metal compounds (nickel-acetylene and Cr{sub 2}). The UNO criterion works well in these cases. Other symmetry breaking solutions, with the possible exception of spatial symmetry, do not appear to be essential to generate the correct active space. In the case of multiple UHF solutions, the natural orbitals of the average UHF density should be used.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB), and phospho-p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) are known to contribute to hippocampal memory/learning. The present study aimed to clarify the effects of nasal obstruction during the growth period on memory/learning in an animal model, using combined behavioral, biochemical, and histological approaches. Male BALB/C mice underwent unilateral nasal obstruction (UNO) by cauterization at 8 days of age and were subjected to Y-maze and passive avoidance tests at 15 weeks of age. The serum corticosterone levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and brain tissues were subjected to hematoxylin-eosin staining and histological analysis or homogenization and Western blot analysis. Compared with control mice, UNO mice had lower blood oxygen saturation levels and exhibited apparent memory/learning impairments during behavioral testing. Additionally, the UNO group had higher hippocampal BDNF levels and serum corticosterone levels, lower hippocampal TrkB and phospho-p44/p42 MAPK levels, and reduced neuron numbers relative to controls. Our findings suggest that UNO during adolescence affects the hippocampus and causes memory/learning impairments.

D.; Grandgenett, N. F.; Schnase, W. L.; Hamersky, S.; Moshman, R.\n\n2008-12-01\n\nThe University of Nebraska at Omaha has been offering on-line Earth System Science coursework to teachers in Nebraska since 2002. UNO was one of the initial members in the Earth Systems Science Education Alliance (ESSEA) and has offered three different ESSEA courses, with nearly 200 students having taken ESSEA courses at UNO for graduate credit. Our experiences in delivering this coursework have involved both teachers who have received a stipend to take the course and those who have paid their own tuition and fees and received graduate credit for the course. We will report on the online behavior of teachers from both populations and also discuss pros and cons of each approach. UNO has also experimented with different approaches in the support and management of the course, including using undergraduate majors as content experts. This improves access of teachers to content-related feedback and is a positive experience for the undergraduate major. Feedback surveys from earlier ESSEA offerings indicate a strongly positive perception of the courses by the teachers enrolled in the coursework. Project impact has been documented in teacher projects, quotes, and lessons associated with the coursework activities. We will also describe online course modules being developed within the UNO online course efforts, including one focusing on the global amphibian crisis.\n\nFine structure of striations observed in barium plasma injections in the magnetospheric cleft\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSimons, D.J.; Eastman, T.E.; Pongratz, M.B.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nIn January and November of 1975, the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory sponsored four high altitude shaped charge barium plasma injections in the magnetospheric cleft region. These experiments were TORDO UNO (January 6), TORDO DOS (January 11), PERIQUITO UNO (November 25), and PERIQUITO DOS (November 28). All four injections took place near 500 km altitude, and optical data were taken from two aircraft and a ground station. "
