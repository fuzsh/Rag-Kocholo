These specialized metabolites are ubiquitous in the plant kingdom and play an essential role not only in plant reproduction and dispersal but also in responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Anthocyanins are recognized as important health-promoting and chronic-disease-preventing components in the human diet. Therefore, interest in developing food crops with improved levels and compositions of these important nutraceuticals is growing. This review focuses on work conducted to elucidate the genetic control of the anthocyanin pathway and modulate anthocyanin content in eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), two solanaceous fruit vegetables of worldwide relevance. While anthocyanin levels in eggplant fruit have always been an important quality trait, anthocyanin-based, purple-fruited tomato cultivars are currently a novelty. As detailed in this review, this difference in the anthocyanin content of the cultivated germplasm has largely influenced genetic studies as well as breeding and transgenic approaches to improve the anthocyanin content/profile of these two important solanaceous crops. The information provided should be of help to researchers and breeders in devising strategies to address the increasing consumer demand for nutraceutical foods.

Tumor recurrence frequently occurs after removal. Tumoral angiogenesis, the formation of neovessels, has a positive impact on tumor progression and invasion, although there are controversial results in the specialized literature regarding its impact on survival. This study aims to correlate the immunoexpression of angiogenesis markers (CD34, CD105) with the proliferation index Ki67 and p53 in primary and secondary glioblastomas. This retrospective study included 54 patients diagnosed with glioblastoma at the Pathology Department of County Emergency Clinical Hospital Târgu Mureș. Microvascular density was determined using CD34 and CD105 antibodies, and the results were correlated with the immunoexpression of p53, IDH1, ATRX and Ki67. The number of neoformed blood vessels varied among cases, characterized by different shapes and calibers, with endothelial cells showing modified morphology and moderate to marked pleomorphism. Neovessels with a glomeruloid aspect, associated with intense positivity for CD34 or CD105 in endothelial cells, were observed, characteristic of glioblastomas. Mean microvascular density values were higher for the CD34 marker in all cases, though there were no statistically significant differences compared to CD105. Mutant IDH1 and ATRX glioblastomas, wild-type p53 glioblastomas, and those with a Ki67 index above 20% showed a more abundant microvascular density, with statistical correlations not reaching significance. This study highlighted a variety of percentage intervals of microvascular density in primary and secondary glioblastomas using immunohistochemical markers CD34 and CD105, respectively, with no statistically significant correlation between evaluated microvascular density and p53 or Ki67.

In order to elucidate the mechanisms regulating the response of M. rosenbergii to acute low-salinity exposure, we conducted a comprehensive study of the response of M. rosenbergii exposed to different salinities’ (0‰, 6‰, and 12‰) data for 120 h. The activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase were found to be significantly inhibited in the hepatopancreas and muscle following low-salinity exposure, resulting in oxidative damage and immune deficits in M. rosenbergii. Differential gene enrichment in transcriptomics indicated that low-salinity stress induced metabolic differences and immune and inflammatory dysfunction in M. rosenbergii. The differential expressions of MIH, JHEH, and EcR genes indicated the inhibition of growth, development, and molting ability of M. rosenbergii. At the proteomic level, low salinity induced metabolic differences and affected biological and cellular regulation, as well as the immune response. Tyramine, trans-1,2-Cyclohexanediol, sorbitol, acetylcholine chloride, and chloroquine were screened by metabolomics as differential metabolic markers. In addition, combined multi-omics analysis revealed that metabolite chloroquine was highly correlated with low-salt stress.

Modified lipoproteins interact with toll-like receptors (TLR), causing an increased inflammatory response and altered cholesterol homeostasis. We aimed to determine the effects of TLR antagonists on cholesterol efflux and foam cell formation in human macrophages. Stimulated monocytes were treated with TLR antagonists (MIP2), and the cholesterol efflux transporter expression and foam cell formation were analyzed. The administration of MIP2 attenuated the foam cell formation induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ox-LDL) in stimulated THP-1 cells (p < 0.001). The expression of ATP-binding cassette transporters A (ABCA)-1, ABCG-1, scavenger receptor (SR)-B1, liver X receptor (LXR)-α, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ mRNA and proteins were increased (p < 0.001) following MIP2 administration. A concentration-dependent decrease in the phosphorylation of p65, p38, and JNK was also observed following MIP2 administration. Moreover, an inhibition of p65 phosphorylation enhanced the expression of ABCA1, ABCG1, SR-B1, and LXR-α. TLR inhibition promoted the cholesterol efflux pathway by increasing the expression of ABCA-1, ABCG-1, and SR-B1, thereby reducing foam cell formation. Our results suggest a potential role of the p65/NF-kB/LXR-α/ABCA1 axis in TLR-mediated cholesterol homeostasis.

This study aims to investigate the effects of accelerated electron radiation on some pivotal neurotransmitter circuits (cholinergic and serotonergic) of rats’ myenteric plexus. Male Wistar rats were irradiated with an electron beam (9 MeV, 5 Gy) generated by a multimodality linear accelerator. The contractile activity of isolated smooth muscle samples from the gastric corpus was measured. Furthermore, an electrical stimulation (200 μs, 20 Hz, 50 s, 60 V) was performed on the samples and an assessment of the cholinergic and serotonergic circuits was made. Five days after irradiation, the recorded mechanical responses were biphasic—contraction/relaxation in controls and contraction/contraction in irradiated samples. The nature of the contractile phase of control samples was cholinergic with serotonin involvement. The relaxation phase involved ACh-induced nitric oxide release from gastric neurons. There was a significant increase in serotonergic involvement during the first and second contractile phases of the irradiated samples, along with a diminished role of acetylcholine in the first phase. This study demonstrates an increased involvement of serotonergic neurotransmitter circuits in the gastric myenteric plexus caused by radiation with accelerated electrons.

Much effort has been made to surmise the molecular mechanisms underlying muscle atrophy and develop tools for improving muscle function. Enhancing mitochondrial function is considered critical for increasing muscle function and health. This study is aimed at evaluating the effect of an aqueous extract of Gloiopeltis tenax (GTAE) on myogenesis and muscle atrophy caused by dexamethasone (DEX). The GTAE promoted myogenic differentiation, accompanied by an increase in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator α (PGC-1α) expression and mitochondrial content in myoblast cell culture. In addition, the GTAE alleviated the DEX-mediated myotube atrophy that is attributable to the Akt-mediated inhibition of the Atrogin/MuRF1 pathway. Furthermore, an in vivo study using a DEX-induced muscle atrophy mouse model demonstrated the efficacy of GTAE in protecting muscles from atrophy and enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis and function, even under conditions of atrophy. Taken together, this study suggests that the GTAE shows propitious potential as a nutraceutical for enhancing muscle function and preventing muscle wasting.

In the event of diseases, old age, lifestyle, or trauma, bone regeneration can be impaired which could result in a prolonged healing duration or requiring an external intervention for repair. Currently, bone grafts hold the golden standard for bone regeneration. However, several limitations hinder its clinical applications, e.g., donor site morbidity, an insufficient tissue volume, and uncertain post-operative outcomes. Bone tissue engineering, involving stem cells seeded onto scaffolds, has thus been a promising treatment alternative for bone regeneration. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) are known to hold therapeutic value for the treatment of various clinical conditions and have displayed feasibility and significant effectiveness due to their ease of isolation, non-invasive, abundance in quantity, and osteogenic capacity. Notably, in vitro studies showed AD-MSCs holding a high proliferation capacity, multi-differentiation potential through the release of a variety of factors, and extracellular vesicles, allowing them to repair damaged tissues. In vivo and clinical studies showed AD-MSCs favoring better vascularization and the integration of the scaffolds, while the presence of scaffolds has enhanced the osteogenesis potential of AD-MSCs, thus yielding optimal bone formation outcomes. Effective bone regeneration requires the interplay of both AD-MSCs and scaffolds (material, pore size) to improve the osteogenic and vasculogenic capacity. This review presents the advances and applications of AD-MSCs for bone regeneration and bone tissue engineering, focusing on the in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies involving AD-MSCs for bone tissue engineering.

(S)-ketamine was the first of a novel class of antidepressants, rapid-acting antidepressants, to be approved for medical use. The stereoisomer, (R)-ketamine (arketamine), is currently under development for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The compound has demonstrated efficacy in multiple animal models. Two clinical studies disclosed efficacy in TRD and bipolar depression. A study by the drug sponsor recently failed to reach a priori clinical endpoints but post hoc analysis revealed efficacy. The clinical value of (R)-ketamine is supported by experimental data in humans and rodents, showing that it is less sedating, does not produce marked psychotomimetic or dissociative effects, has less abuse potential than (S)-ketamine, and produces efficacy in animal models of a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. The mechanisms of action of the antidepressant effects of (R)-ketamine are hypothesized to be due to NMDA receptor antagonism and/or non-NMDA receptor mechanisms. We suggest that further clinical experimentation with (R)-ketamine will create novel and improved medicines for some of the neurological and psychiatric disorders that are underserved by current medications.

In this frame, the present work describes different synthetic strategies to obtain MAO inhibitors via the coupling of the aminocoumarin core with arylsulfonyl chlorides followed by copper azide-alkyne cycloaddition, leading to coumarin–sulfonamide–nitroindazolyl–triazole hybrids. The nitration position on the coumarin moiety was confirmed through nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and molecular electron density theory in order to elucidate the molecular mechanism and selectivity of the electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The coumarin derivatives were evaluated for their inhibitory potency against monoamine oxidases and cholinesterases. Molecular docking calculations provided a rational binding mode of the best compounds in the series with MAO A and B. The work identified hybrids 14a–c as novel MAO inhibitors, with a selective action against isoform B, of potential interest to combat neurological diseases.

However, the use of flexible hexaazatetraamine macrocycles containing two pyridines and acyclic spacers is rather uncommon. Accordingly, we obtained [DyL(OAc)2]OAc·7H2O·EtOH and [DyLMe2(Cl)2]Cl·2H2O, where L and LMe2 are the 18-membered macrocycles 3,6,10,13-tetraaza-1,8(2,6)-dipyridinacyclotetradecaphane and 3,10-dimethyl-3,6,10,13-tetraaza-1,8(2,6)-dipyridinacyclotetradecaphane, respectively, which contain ethylene and methylethylene spacers between their N3 moieties. [DyL(OAc)2]OAc·7H2O·EtOH represents the first crystallographically characterized lanthanoid complex of L, while [DyLMe2(Cl)2]Cl·2H2O contributes to increasing the scarce number of LnIII compounds containing LMe2. Furthermore, the crystal structure of L·12H2O was solved, and it was compared with those of other related macrocycles previously published. Likewise, the crystal structures of the DyIII complexes were compared with those of the lanthanoid and d-metal complexes of other 18-membered N6 donor macrocycles. This comparison showed some effect of the spacers employed, as well as the influence of the size of the ancillary ligands and the metal ion. Additionally, the distinct folding behaviors of these macrocycles influenced their coordination geometries. Moreover, the luminescent properties of [DyL(OAc)2]OAc·7H2O·EtOH and [DyLMe2(Cl)2]Cl·2H2O were also investigated, showing that both complexes are fluorescent, with the emission being sensitized by the ligands.

The siloxane polyether was successfully synthesized by a hydrosilylation reaction in the presence of Karstedt’s catalyst. The product structure was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and GPC analysis. In addition, the thermal stability of HOL7 was studied by thermogravimetric measurement. Subsequently, the surfaces of glass plates were modified with the obtained organosilicon derivative. In the next step, a microalgal experiment was conducted. A mixture of four strains of algal taxa isolated from building materials was used for the experiment—Chlorodium saccharophilum PNK010, Klebsormidium flaccidum PNK013, Pseudostichococcus monallantoides PNK037, and Trebouxia aggregata PNK080. The choice of these algae followed from their wide occurrence in terrestrial environments. Application of an organofunctional siloxane compound on the glass reduced, more or less effectively, the photosynthetic activity of algal cells, depending on the concentration of the compound. Since the structure of the compound was not based on biocide-active agents, its effectiveness was associated with a reduction in water content in the cells.

These components make it an ideal candidate for biofuel production and pharmaceutical applications. In this study, we genetically engineered N. gaditana to overexpress the enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (cyFBPase) using the Hsp promoter, aiming to enhance sugar metabolism and biomass accumulation. The modified algal strain, termed NgFBP, exhibited a 1.34-fold increase in cyFBPase activity under photoautotrophic conditions. This modification led to a doubling of biomass production and an increase in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) content in fatty acids to 20.78–23.08%. Additionally, the genetic alteration activated the pathways related to glycine, protoporphyrin, thioglucosides, pantothenic acid, CoA, and glycerophospholipids. This shift in carbon allocation towards chloroplast development significantly enhanced photosynthesis and growth. The outcomes of this study not only improve our understanding of photosynthesis and carbon allocation in N. gaditana but also suggest new biotechnological methods to optimize biomass yield and compound production in microalgae.

Recent research has shed light on its diverse functions in plant growth and defense mechanisms. This review explores the intricate roles of MEL in plant growth and defense responses. MEL is involved in plant growth owing to its influence on hormone regulation. MEL promotes root elongation and lateral root formation and enhances photosynthesis, thereby promoting overall plant growth and productivity. Additionally, MEL is implicated in regulating the circadian rhythm of plants, affecting key physiological processes that influence plant growth patterns. MEL also exhibits antioxidant properties and scavenges reactive oxygen species, thereby mitigating oxidative stress. Furthermore, it activates defense pathways against various biotic stressors. MEL also enhances the production of secondary metabolites that contribute to plant resistance against environmental changes. MEL’s ability to modulate plant response to abiotic stresses has also been extensively studied. It regulates stomatal closure, conserves water, and enhances stress tolerance by activating stress-responsive genes and modulating signaling pathways. Moreover, MEL and nitric oxide cooperate in stress responses, antioxidant defense, and plant growth. Understanding the mechanisms underlying MEL’s actions in plants will provide new insights into the development of innovative strategies for enhancing crop productivity, improving stress tolerance, and combating plant diseases. Further research in this area will deepen our knowledge of MEL’s intricate functions and its potential applications in sustainable agriculture.

Control of this fungal pathogen is quite difficult due to its wide host range and environmental persistence. Currently, the management of the disease is still mainly based on chemicals, which can have harmful effects not only on the environment and on human health but also because they favor the development of strains resistant to fungicides. The flexibility and plasticity of B. cinerea in challenging plant defense mechanisms and its ability to evolve strategies to escape chemicals require the development of new control strategies for successful disease management. In this review, some aspects of the host-pathogen interactions from which novel and sustainable control strategies could be developed (e.g., signaling pathways, molecules involved in plant immune mechanisms, hormones, post-transcriptional gene silencing) were analyzed. New biotechnological tools based on the use of RNA interference (RNAi) are emerging in the crop protection scenario as versatile, sustainable, effective, and environmentally friendly alternatives to the use of chemicals. RNAi-based fungicides are expected to be approved soon, although they will face several challenges before reaching the market.

In this study, we investigated the role of tropomyosin 3 (TPM3) in protecting cardiomyocytes against hypoxia-induced injury and oxidative stress. Using the AC16 and H9c2 cell lines, we established a chemical hypoxia model by treating cells with cobalt chloride (CoCl2) to simulate low-oxygen conditions. We found that CoCl2 treatment significantly upregulated the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) in cardiomyocytes, indicating the successful induction of hypoxia. Subsequent morphological and biochemical analyses revealed that hypoxia altered cardiomyocyte morphology disrupted the cytoskeleton, and caused cellular damage, accompanied by increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, indicative of oxidative stress. Lentivirus-mediated TPM3 overexpression attenuated hypoxia-induced morphological changes, cellular damage, and oxidative stress imbalance, while TPM3 knockdown exacerbated these effects. Furthermore, treatment with the HDAC1 inhibitor MGCD0103 partially reversed the exacerbation of hypoxia-induced injury caused by TPM3 knockdown. Protein–protein interaction (PPI) network and functional enrichment analysis suggested that TPM3 may modulate cardiac muscle development, contraction, and adrenergic signaling pathways. In conclusion, our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of TPM3 modulation in mitigating hypoxia-associated cardiac injury, suggesting a promising avenue for the treatment of ischemic heart disease and other hypoxia-related cardiac pathologies.

The ABCA1 protein encoded by ABCA1 is involved in transporting cholesterol across the cell membrane. Genetic variations in the ABCA1 gene are well documented; however, their role in the development of diabetic dyslipidemia still needs to be explored. This study aimed to identify the associations of rs757194699 (K1587Q) and rs2066714 (I883M) with dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetes and performed molecular simulations. In our case–control study, 330 individuals were divided equally into a diabetic dyslipidemia cases and a healthy controls. Allele-specific polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism were performed to screen selected variants of the ABCA1 gene. Sanger sequencing was also performed to find genetic mutations in exon 5 of the ABCA1 gene. The C allele of rs757194699 was observed at a high frequency in cases compared to controls and followed the overdominant genetic model (p < 0.0001, OR:3.84; CI:1.67–8.82). The frequency of G allele of rs2066714 was significantly higher in cases compared to controls and followed the genetic model of codominant (p< 0.0001, OR: 39.61; CI:9.97–157.32), dominant (p < 0.0001,OR:59.59; CI:15.19–233.81), overdominant (p< 0.0001, OR:9.75; CI:3.16–30.11), and log-additive (p< 0.0001, OR:42.15; CI:11.08–160.40). In silico modeling and docking revealed that rs2066714 and rs757194699 produced deleterious conformational changes in the ABCA1 protein, resulting in alterations in the binding of the apoA1 protein. There were no genetic variations found in exon-5 in Sanger sequencing. The G allele of rs2066714 and C allele of rs757194699 in the ABCA1 gene were found to be risk alleles in the development of dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetes. These polymorphisms could alter the binding site of ABCA1 with apoA1 thus disturbs the reverse cholesterol transport.

However, our understanding of the NDPK gene family in Brassica napus L. remains limited. This paper systematically analyzes the NDPK gene family in B. napus, particularly focusing on the evolutionary differences within the species. In this study, sixteen, nine, and eight NDPK genes were identified in B. napus and its diploid ancestors, respectively. These genes are not only homologous but also highly similar in their chromosomal locations. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the identified NDPK proteins were divided into four clades, each containing unique motif sequences, with most NDPKs experiencing a loss of introns/exons during evolution. Collinearity analysis revealed that the NDPK genes underwent whole-genome duplication (WGD) events, resulting in duplicate copies, and most of these duplicate genes were subjected to purifying selection. Cis-acting element analysis identified in the promoters of most NDPK genes elements related to a light response, methyl jasmonate response, and abscisic acid response, especially with an increased number of abscisic acid response elements in B. napus. RNA-Seq results indicated that NDPK genes in B. napus exhibited different expression patterns across various tissues. Further analysis through qRT-PCR revealed that BnNDPK genes responded significantly to stress conditions such as salt, drought, and methyl jasmonate. This study enhances our understanding of the NDPK gene family in B. napus, providing a preliminary theoretical basis for the functional study of NDPK genes and offering some references for further revealing the phenomenon of polyploidization in plants.

Here we report that HGb-I interacts with lipids stoichiometrically to induce structural changes in the heme pocket, changing the heme iron distal ligation coordination from hexacoordinate to pentacoordinate. Such changes in heme geometry have only been previously reported for cytochrome c and cytoglobin, linked to apoptosis regulation and enhanced lipid peroxidation activity, respectively. However, unlike cytoglobin and cytochrome c, the heme iron of HGb-I is altered by lipids in ferrous as well as ferric oxidation states. The apparent affinity for lipids in this thermally stable globin is highly pH-dependent but essentially temperature-independent within the range of 20–60 °C. We propose a mechanism to explain these observations, in which lipid binding and stability of the distal endogenous ligand are juxtaposed as a function of temperature. Additionally, we propose that these coupled equilibria may constitute a mechanism through which this acidophilic thermophile senses the pH of its environment.

Investigating the molecular underpinnings of aging is crucial to identify geroprotectors, precisely quantify biological age, and propose healthy longevity approaches. This review explores pathways that are currently being investigated as intervention targets and aging biomarkers spanning molecular, cellular, and systemic dimensions. Interventions that target these hallmarks may ameliorate the aging process, with some progressing to clinical trials. Biomarkers of these hallmarks are used to estimate biological aging and risk of aging-associated disease. Utilizing aging biomarkers, biological aging clocks can be constructed that predict a state of abnormal aging, age-related diseases, and increased mortality. Biological age estimation can therefore provide the basis for a fine-grained risk stratification by predicting all-cause mortality well ahead of the onset of specific diseases, thus offering a window for intervention. Yet, despite technological advancements, challenges persist due to individual variability and the dynamic nature of these biomarkers. Addressing this requires longitudinal studies for robust biomarker identification. Overall, utilizing the hallmarks of aging to discover new drug targets and develop new biomarkers opens new frontiers in medicine. Prospects involve multi-omics integration, machine learning, and personalized approaches for targeted interventions, promising a healthier aging population.

DNA methylation can regulate the TME without altering the DNA sequence. However, research on the methylation-driven TME in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is still lacking. In this study, integrated DNA methylation and RNA-seq data were used to explore methylation-driven genes (MDGs). Immune scores were calculated using the ESTIMATE, which was employed to identify TME-related genes. A new signature connected with methylation-regulated TME using univariate, multivariate Cox regression and LASSO regression analyses was developed. This signature consists of four TME-MDGs, including AJAP1, HOXB9, MYH14, and SLC6A19, which exhibit high methylation and low expression in tumors. Validation was performed using qRT-PCR which confirmed their downregulation in ccRCC clinical samples. Additionally, the signature demonstrated stable predictive performance in different subtypes of ccRCC. Risk scores are positively correlated with TMN stages, immune cell infiltration, tumor mutation burden, and adverse outcomes of immunotherapy. Interestingly, the expression of four TME-MDGs are highly correlated with the sensitivity of first-line drugs in ccRCC treatment, especially pazopanib. Molecular docking indicates a high affinity binding between the proteins and pazopanib. In summary, our study elucidates the comprehensive role of methylation-driven TME in ccRCC, aiding in identifying patients sensitive to immunotherapy and targeted therapy, and providing new therapeutic targets for ccRCC treatment.

To identify the key microRNAs (miRNAs) in control of maize brace root growth, we performed small RNA sequencing using brace root samples at emergence and growth stages. We focused on the genetic modulation of brace root development in maize through manipulation of miR390 and its downstream regulated auxin response factors (ARFs). In the present study, miR167, miR166, miR172, and miR390 were identified to be involved in maize brace root growth in inbred line B73. Utilizing short tandem target mimic (STTM) technology, we further developed maize lines with reduced miR390 expression and analyzed their root architecture compared to wild-type controls. Our findings show that STTM390 maize lines exhibit enhanced brace root length and increased whorl numbers. Gene expression analyses revealed that the suppression of miR390 leads to upregulation of its downstream regulated ARF genes, specifically ZmARF11 and ZmARF26, which may significantly alter root architecture. Additionally, loss-of-function mutants for ZmARF11 and ZmARF26 were characterized to further confirm the role of these genes in brace root growth. These results demonstrate that miR390, ZmARF11, and ZmARF26 play crucial roles in regulating maize brace root growth; the involved complicated molecular mechanisms need to be further explored. This study provides a genetic basis for breeding maize varieties with improved lodging resistance and adaptability to diverse agricultural environments.

Mitochondria-impairing agents can be used to hamper PCSC propagation and reduce PDAC progression. Therefore, to develop an efficient vector for delivering drugs to the mitochondria, we synthesized tris(3,5-dimethylphenyl)phosphonium-conjugated palmitic acid. Triphenylphosphonium (TPP) is a lipophilic cationic moiety that promotes the accumulation of conjugated agents in the mitochondrion. Palmitic acid (PA), the most common saturated fatty acid, has pro-apoptotic activity in different types of cancer cells. TPP-PA was prepared by the reaction of 16-bromopalmitic acid with TPP, and its structure was characterized by 1H and 13C NMR and HRMS. We compared the proteomes of TPP-PA-treated and untreated PDAC cells and PCSCs, identifying dysregulated proteins and pathways. Furthermore, assessments of mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular ROS, cardiolipin content and lipid peroxidation, ER stress, and autophagy markers provided information on the mechanism of action of TPP-PA. The findings showed that TPP-PA reduces PDAC cell proliferation through mitochondrial disruption that leads to increased ROS, activation of ER stress, and autophagy. Hence, TPP-PA might offer a new approach for eliminating both the primary population of cancer cells and PCSCs, which highlights the promise of TPP-derived compounds as anticancer agents for PDAC.

The quest to unravel the complex diseases mechanism has led researchers to adopt both theoretical and experimental methods, each offering unique insights into the underlying pathogenesis. This review emphasizes the significance of combining multiple approaches in the study of polyQ disorders, focusing on the structure–function correlations and the relevance of polyQ-related protein dynamics in neurodegeneration. By integrating computational/theoretical predictions with experimental observations, one can establish robust structure–function correlations, aiding in the identification of key molecular targets for therapeutic interventions. PolyQ proteins’ dynamics, influenced by their length and interactions with other molecular partners, play a pivotal role in the polyQ-related pathogenic cascade. Moreover, conformational dynamics of polyQ proteins can trigger aggregation, leading to toxic assembles that hinder proper cellular homeostasis. Understanding these intricacies offers new avenues for therapeutic strategies by fine-tuning polyQ kinetics, in order to prevent and control disease progression. Last but not least, this review highlights the importance of integrating multidisciplinary efforts to advancing research in this field, bringing us closer to the ultimate goal of finding effective treatments against polyQ disorders.

Due to their unique sequences, histone variants can alter histone–histone or histone–DNA interactions, impacting the folding of DNA around the histone octamer and the overall higher-order structure of chromatin fibers. These structural modifications alter chromatin compaction and accessibility of DNA by transcription factors and other regulatory proteins to influence gene regulatory processes such as DNA damage and repair, as well as transcriptional activation or repression. Histone variants can also generate a unique interactome composed of histone chaperones and chromatin remodeling complexes. Any of these perturbations can contribute to cellular plasticity and the progression of human diseases. Here, we focus on a frequently overlooked group of histone variants lying within the four human histone gene clusters and their contribution to breast cancer.

A root cause for hyperthermic neurological damage is heat-induced proteotoxic stress through protein aggregation, a known causative agent of neurological disorders. Stress magnitude and enduring persistence are highly correlated with hyperthermia-associated neurological damage. We used an untargeted proteomic approach using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify and characterize time-series proteome-wide changes in dose-responsive proteotoxic stress models in medulloblastoma [Daoy], neuroblastoma [SH-SY5Y], and differentiated SH-SY5Y neuron-like cells [SH(D)]. An integrated analysis of condition–time datasets identified global proteome-wide differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) as part of the heat-induced proteotoxic stress response. The condition-specific analysis detected higher DEPs and upregulated proteins in extreme heat stress with a relatively conservative and tight regulation in differentiated SH-SY5Y neuron-like cells. Functional network analysis using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) identified common intercellular pathways associated with the biological processes of protein, RNA, and amino acid metabolism and cellular response to stress and membrane trafficking. The condition-wise temporal pathway analysis in the differentiated neuron-like cells detects a significant pathway, functional, and disease association of DEPs with processes like protein folding and protein synthesis, Nervous System Development and Function, and Neurological Disease. An elaborate dose-dependent stress-specific and neuroprotective cellular signaling cascade is also significantly activated. Thus, our study provides a comprehensive map of the heat-induced proteotoxic stress response associating proteome-wide changes with altered biological processes. This helps to expand our understanding of the molecular basis of the heat-induced proteotoxic stress response with potential translational connotations.

Caragana species are ecologically valuable for their roles in windbreaking and sand fixation. However, the taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships of the genus Caragana are still unclear. In this study, we sequenced and assembled the chloroplast genomes of representative species of Caragana and reconstructed robust phylogenetic relationships at the section level. The Caragana chloroplast genome has lost the inverted repeat region and wascategorized in the inverted repeat loss clade (IRLC). The chloroplast genomes of the eight species ranged from 128,458 bp to 135,401 bp and contained 110 unique genes. All the Caragana chloroplast genomes have a highly conserved structure and gene order. The number of long repeats and simple sequence repeats (SSRs) showed significant variation among the eight species, indicating heterogeneous evolution in Caragana. Selective pressure analysis of the genes revealed that most of the protein-coding genes evolved under purifying selection. The phylogenetic analyses indicated that each section forms a clade, except the section Spinosae, which was divided into two clades. This study elucidated the evolution of the chloroplast genome within the widely distributed genus Caragana. The detailed information obtained from this study can serve as a valuable resource for understanding the molecular dynamics and phylogenetic relationships within Caragana.

VVs result from functional abnormalities in the venous circulation of the lower extremities, such as venous hypertension, venous valve incompetence, and venous reflux. Previous studies indicate that enhanced angiogenesis and inflammation contribute to the progression and onset of VVs; however, dysregulations in signaling pathways associated with these processes in VVs patients are poorly understood. Therefore, in our study, we aimed to identify key regulators of angiogenesis and inflammation that are dysregulated in patients with VVs. Expression levels of 18 genes were analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) using real-time PCR, as well as plasma levels of 6 proteins were investigated using ELISA. Higher levels of CCL5, PDGFA, VEGFC, TGF-alpha, TGF-beta 1, and VEGF-A, as well as lower levels of VEGFB and VEGF-C, were found to be statistically significant in the VV group compared to the control subjects without VVs. None of the analyzed factors was associated with the venous localization of the varicosities. The presented study identified dysregulations in key angiogenesis- and inflammation-related factors in PBMC and plasma from VVs patients, providing new insight into molecular mechanisms that could contribute to the development of VVs and point out promising candidates for circulatory biomarkers of this disease.

Here, we evaluated whether some miRNs may affect tumor development comparing untreated and 5-azacitidine (5-AZA) MDS-treated patients. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 20 controls and 24 MDS patients, and selected miRNs related to redox balance and inflammation (inflamma-miRs), including miR-18a, miR-21, miR-34a and miR-146a, were isolated and measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR). A differential expression profile of miRNs was detected in untreated MDS patients and the 5-AZA group. Inflammation increases miRNs and, specifically, miR-18a, miR-21 and miR-34a were significantly overexpressed in untreated MDS, compared to controls. However, we did not observe any miRN profile alteration during the progression of the disease. On the other hand, 5-AZA treatment tends to restore miRN expression levels. Relating to prognostic risk factors, high-risk MDS groups (high Revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R), high cytogenetic risk, high molecular risk (HMR) mutations) tended to be related with higher expression levels of miR-18a and miR-34a. Higher miRN expression is correlated with lower glutathione peroxidase activity, while they are related with a higher profile of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α). Although our study was limited by the low number of MDS patients included, we identified miRN deregulation involved in MDS development that could regulate redox sensors and inflammatory responses. Finally, 5-AZA treatment is related with lower miRN expression levels in MDS patients.

In this pilot study, we advocate for droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to diagnose GIST in tissue samples and explore its potential for early diagnosis via liquid biopsy, focusing on the PDGFRA D842V mutation and SEPT9 hypermethylated gene. We utilized ddPCR to analyze the predominant PDGFRA mutation (D842V) in surgical tissue samples from 15 GIST patients, correlating with pathologists’ diagnoses. We expanded our analysis to plasma samples to compare DNA alterations between tumor tissue and plasma, also investigating SEPT9 gene hypermethylation. We successfully detected the PDGFRA D842V mutation in GIST tissues by ddPCR. Despite various protocols to enhance mutation detection in early-stage disease, it remained challenging, likely due to the low concentration of DNA in plasma samples. Additionally, the results of Area Under the Curve (AUC) for the hypermethylated SEPT9 gene, analyzing concentration, ratio, and abundance were 0.74 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.52 to 0.97), 0.77 (95% CI: 0.56 to 0.98), and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.59 to 0.99), respectively. As a rare disease, the early detection of GIST through such biomarkers is particularly crucial, offering significant potential to improve patient outcomes.
