        "text": "ReleaseTheAyerCut first of all.\n\nEnos the photographer wasn´t on set for the Joss stuff but he joined the lower-level actors and stuntpeople to back Fisher.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ClayEnos/status/1278405122381529089?ref_src=twsrc^tfw|twcamp^tweetembed|twterm^1278405122381529089&ref_url=https://www.redditmedia.com/mediaembed/hjhgce?responsive=true&is_nightmode=false\n\nThe Frosty the Snowbro news is clearly being used to distract from the drama but it´s already pretty ugly and nothing concret has be said so far. That´s when the real fire will rise. Some \"insiders\" are teasing vague things on social media so we´ll see. At least one is trustworty to me but I won´t be stocking this.\n\nRay set the stage. This is his moment. \"Battle lines\" are being drawn. Berg´s response is... not great and Joss declined to comment:\n\nRay Fisher Accuses Joss Whedon of ‘Abusive, Unprofessional’ Behavior on ‘Justice League’ Set\n\nActor Ray Fisher accused director Joss Whedon of \"gross, abusive, unprofessional\" behavior on the set of the 2017 film \"Justice League.\"\n\nI have seen every Whedon show he show ran to completion (Dollhouse is his only major dud here and aged like milk), I saw every film he directed, a lot of the films he produced/wrote and I read every comic he wrote. I even defended him when he came on board to \"finish up JLA for Zack\". Yeah.\n\nAll of this makes me a fan of the creator side of Whedon even if I have some deep-rooted gripes. I have no idea how anyone can defend Whedon as a person tough. There are many stories of him being a great guy but equally many that damn him. His biggest fansite disbanded in 2017. Never forget that.\n\nJoss clearly has his demons, very dark demons, and I don´t think I have it in me to watch his HBO show. Especially if I look at the synopsis.\n\nSean O'Connell from Cinema Blend is writing the Snyder Cut book that is set for next year. He interviewed Zack for it so the NDAs have to be up. We have another rocky year ahead of us.\n\nMember when a snapped neck and I guess GL 2011 were the biggest drama we had? How innocent it all seems now.\n\nUnlike an E3 press conference I feel like the chances of WB keeping these two films secret by the time FanDome rolls around are, sadly, slim......unless they employ the same level of stealth development that Nolan does. I heard that Nolan is so secretive that there are some 'lower level' executives at the studio who don't know what he's working on until it's announced.\n\nIn saying that why would they have an option to ask a question about a 'Secret Film' if you don't know what the project is about? It's possible that both of these are announced before hand and then WB will fill in the details about what they are at the event.\n\nAssuming that these 'Secret Films' are projects that haven't been announced in one form or another (New Gods for example) already and aren't sequels or spin-offs to films that haven't been released yet (they have learnt their lessons there) they could be.....\n\nWHATEVER JJ ABRAMS IS DOING - Apparently Bad Robot have been taking loads of pitches on various film and TV projects so it could be the first of whatever the Justice League Dark 'slate' of films will be. Zatanna has been rumoured to be on WB's radar for a while. If not that something related to Metropolis perhaps?\n\nANIMATED FILM - I mentioned that WB's animation division WAG have been looking at a couple of DC projects, before Super Pets was announced, so it's possible that it's something new from them. Metal Men? Inspector Chimp? Who knows.....\n\nBATMAN BEYOND - I thought this was one rumour that would catch fire, but it sort of fizzled out. I could still see it as a more viable option than a Batgirl set outside of Matt Reeves' Gotham 'silo'.\n\nHBO MAX FILMS - Warner Bros are undoubtedly working on a slate of DC films to debut on their streaming platform. I imagine some will directly tie into the DCU and some will just exist in the Multiverse given that they will be working with lower budgets ($50-75m) than the cinematic fare. In saying that I could see a Green Arrow & Black Canary film(s) debut on HBO Max if they don't adapt something like the long in development Escape From Super Max script.\n\nTHE TITANS - Eh, more a long shot at this point. I can all but guarantee you that Warners will make a live action, Titans films set within the DCU at some point (it's too big of a brand not to) but given that we haven't heard anything about the Blue Beetle project (and there's the current Berlanti tv series) in a while it's possible that's much further off in the distance.\n\nEDIT, I thought of another one....\n\nWHATEVER HENRY CAVILL WAS IN TALKS TO APPEAR IN - Assuming that Cavill won't show up (either a cameo or co-lead) in either The Flash film or Shazam 2 it's possible that Warners are eyeing him for another, as yet unannounced, DCU project. What that could be makes my mind boggle a little bit to be honest. Any ideas?\n\nThe Frosty the Snowbro news is clearly being used to distract from the drama but it´s already pretty ugly and nothing concret has be said so far.\n\nI seriously doubt that.... That's either a weird coincidence or Ray heard about this deal and that's what 'pushed' him to send out that Tweet. I doubt that the studio's PR department are dropping a story about a Frosty Snowman film as some kind of 'bait and switch' for a story like this in an environment like the one we have today.\n\nNot to derail us into Sucker Punch talk but yes. It was changed on a core level even before the cameras started to roll as he wanted a Hard-R. He deconstructs the Heavy Metal comics of his youth with that film while using the esthetic of then-current 360/PS3 games. Not going balls to the wall mucks up the basic intent of the production. Not that going ultra cryptic helped at all so even Snydra himself helped to crash that plane with no survivors.\n\nThe concluding \"sex scene\" that features no nudity and is only in the extended cut was further cut down by the MPAA as you can´t have a woman enjoying herself with a PG-13 (Blue Valentine got an NC-17 that way but is rated 12 in Germany, says it all I think) so the footage ended up looking like rape.\n\nSnyder then wisely gave up on cutting down the scene and made the (uncut) scene home media only and thus unmade his own 3rd act for the theatrical cut.\n\nSucker Punch - Alternate Ending [Deleted Scene]\n\nA Deleted Scene from Sucker Punch.In my opinion, they should have really kept this scene in the movie. It explains so much when The Doctor is saying at the e...\n\nSucker Punch - Deleted Dance Scene (HD)\n\nNEW: Guys Take Over Alley For Epic Dance Battle! #FreestyleFriday: http://vid.io/xqM0Check out the full deleted dance scene from Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch! ...\n\nSnow Steam Iron (2017) Zack Snyder Short Film\n\nSnow Steam Iron is the latest movie from Justice League and 300 director Zack Snyder which was released exclusively on Vero. This is the full length film fr...\n\nI won´t defend the film on a movie-making level (especially the cinema cut!) but Snyder being settled with misogyny accusations in 2011 was absolute bullshit.\n\nGood on the cast for sticking out for him. It's fascinating how much his casts/crews and fellow filmmakers/producers like and defend him and how polarizing he is with audiences/critics. A shame that Darren Aronofsky and Lars von Trier don´t do cape films. Truly a shame.\n\nOn to the 3rd link. It´s there for a reason as there is a point to my madness. The short he shot over a weekend with his friends and thus the crew of JLA (!) for like 10k on an I-Phone after he \"left\" JLA. He needed to \"remake\" Sucker Punch without a budget to find himself again! My mother likes Steam Iron btw.\n\nBoth Snyder and his protagonist Affleck obviously had more than just WB destroy them from within but DAMN. Never forget that Batfleck himself had partial creative control on JLA Part 1 to shape his solo film. Them joining the ReleaseTheSnyderCut campaign and Snyder coming back to properly finish this bad boy will be much-needed release for both.\n\nWe knew this but a final confirmation can´t hurt:\n\nTo use another recent Snyder quote. \"No compromises\" (2021) \"All compromises\" (2017) 2021 is the year humanity will inject Pure Uncut Snyderyte. Can´t wait.\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso in this film: One last thing with Jonathan Kent and more Green Lantern stuff. Not new but another yes from the director.\n\nThe VFX process is \"so deep in it\".\n\nSups 100% wears black in JLA 2021. The deleted scene, one of exactly 2 on the Blu Ray, where he walks past the suit was by Snyder but it won´t be used it seems. Superman´s black suits might even look a bit different. We will further see Knightmare Cyborg. I suspect that Flash is part of this scene/scenes.\n\nBlack is the Kryptonian formal garb in this canon and Clark is searching for who he is. Now more than ever. Darkseid using earth´s symbol of hope in his chosen US colors to burn down the planet further shows that Snyder knows what he is doing. Seeing the \"actual\" Superman execute people makes it more real.\n\nThe middle one is his clone Brutaal from N52´s Earth 2 Vol 1. (Vol 2 is a mess.) The real Superman breaks free years later and sacrifices himself. DC comics are edgy.\n\nThe Great Darkness Saga should be the first time a \"real\" (in this case future) Superman went evil under Darkseid.\n\nThe real Batman too got such an honor but I don´t remember him ever going fully rogue in these plots. Superman is apparently more susceptible to mind games but even Ivy can turn Superman. She recently controlled the whole JLA sans Batman. Bat don´t crack? Haha.\n\nOn the topic of TAS. A much more somber show that most remember it to be. Superman was supposed to have fathered a son with Lashina in S4 while under the control of Darkseid but that Batman Beyond plot and all of S5 of Superman TAS were stories we sadly never got. I love the DCAU but JLU is the only show with an ending! Batman Beyond technically also has one via JLU but the actual show just ends. Even the Crisis on Two Earths film was rewritten to be non-canon despite being the bridge between both versions of JL. Why? The 2019 JL vs. The Fatal Five toon film and the star-studded 2020 Batman TAS comic are a great start. More pls and fill those gaps. There is no 2017 Harley film, what are you talking about? Mystery of the Batwoman 2003 isn´t much better either and kinda kills Bane who is in Beyond.\n\nI really hope somebody got fired for that blunder.\n\nEdit: I know this scene now that I am looking at the classic story again. Zaddy movies look like comics come to life because they are. Both he and famous artists use the same tricks. Coincidence or not. Never stop Zack.\n\nAs a bonus. Or whatever this travesty can be called before we get rolling. The worst story about Superman under control by Darkseid and the worst \"canon\" Post Crisis Superman story:\n\nAction Comics Vol 1 592\n\n\"...A Walk on the Darkside!\": Big Barda is in the slums of Metropolis. She sees a man shaking down a prostitue and throws the man in a dumpster. Just then, a purse snatcher grabs her purse and flees, but Barda gives chase. An Apokoliptian Ash-Crawler steals the purse from the snatcher and leaves...\n\nAction Comics Vol 1 593\n\n\"The Suicide Snare\": Mister Miracle and Oberon come home to find Darkseid sitting in the living room. He tells them that Big Barda is not home. When Miracle demands answers, Darkseid gives them a videotape. Scott and Oberon watch the videotape, and (this is implied, the screen is never actually...\n\nIn summary: Post Crisis Darkseid produced porn, enjoys his adopted son in law being cucked... just because, seemingly has his daughter in law gang-raped for 2 days and the 2-parter leaves it ambiguous if Superman was forced to shoot cuckolding porn while he and Barda were under the control of an extraterrestrial porn based villain named Sleez who lives in the sewers. Superman might have a rape/sex tape in circulation. Shit like this is what people mean when they accuse Watchmen, DKR and so on of unhinging the industry. Let´s all be glad that Snyder was looking at the good versions of this story and John Byrne is infamous for troubling sexual politics in his comics. His unfinished Superman run (he ran 2 books at once) was more good than bad but there were pitfalls.\n\nThe examples on this page hopefully prove that Superman under Darkseid is one of the oldest semi-modern tricks DC pulls again and again.\n\nDCeased (Sups ends our solar system!) is all about this and Darkseid/Apokolips War do things differently but the basic theme is there.\n\nThese 3 are all from after Snyder´s JLA films were penned but the N52 Earth 2 Vol 1 (co-written by Tom Taylor who does Injustice and DCeased) is older than the JLA Part 1 script and is a prelude to Darkseid War. Darkseid was further being build up as the big bad since the very first issue that DC published in the N52. Justice League Nr 1. Its Origins arc is the basis for the first film in the DC Animated Movie Universe. Not that I like JL: War. The Origins comic is ok.\n\nA shame that Snyder´s arc will likely never finish but you can always have a look at my examples, minus Sleez and imagine the flames.\n\nI once again showed that Snyder's and DC´s clocks began in tandem before we hit iceberg after iceberg. They even restarted the DKR universe just in time for BvS!\n\nAbout Superman in the seminal Rock of Ages. Aka Final Crisis 0 and Seven Soldiers: Mister Miracle is Final Crisis 0.9.\n\nJLA: Rock of Ages\n\nRock of Ages is a Justice League storyline written by Grant Morrison and illustrated by Howard Porter. It's the third arc of Morrison's JLA series, following American Dreams and leading into Strength in Numbers. A future in which Darkseid has learned the Anti-Life Equation, and taken control of...\n\nZaddy for sure read Rock of Ages and Morrison & Porter are thanked in the JLA 2017 credits. This is my favorite JLA arc of all time! Full stop.\n\nSuperman kills himself after being forced to kill anti-life possessed Lois. This is off-panel. He is thus not part of it´s \"Knightmare\". Batman takes that role but there is a twist. Darkseid/Apokolips War features obvious parallels of course. Time is a flat circle. Even with DC continuity. Morrison v Morrison:\n\nSomeone, please call the police. I was fucking robbed by WB! My dream DC movie arc was clawed out of my grasp before I even knew it was there by some of the shittiest suits ever under some of the worst conditions a studio production went through. I take it back. Joss is as much at fault as them. I stopped liking him as a person 3 years ago but this week is what broke me. 2 decades of being a fan down the shitter.\n\nPlease lastly read the Seven Soldiers of Victory event. Our future New Gods savior.... hopefully Tom King isn´t the only one who made a \"grounded\" meta comic about Scott Free escaping death. Morrison did it first in Scott´s part of the event:\n\nHe had to use host bodies and ran the so-called Darkseid Club. This could work as its own film divorced from the DCEU. It really could. General Steppenwulf on the left:\n\nForgot: 90s JLA legend Howard Porter drew a certain suit recently that DCEU fans might like:\n\nThe Rebirth Flash book is quite good and is the most stable ongoing DC comic published since 2016. About 100 issues with only one writer and no drama!\n\nIt's so quiet around here now, that it's time for the Reddit DCEULeaks mega post!!!!\n\nYou start to read it and are like, \"Ok, yeah that makes sense, I can see all of this happening.\" Then it drops off a cliff when gets to Ben coming back as Batman, lol.\n\nAll of this is from a legitimate source.\n\nLet's first start off with the movies and HBOMax projects which will be announced at DC FanDome :\n\nA first look teaser trailer for Matt Reeves' The Batman movie which gives us a first look at Catwoman, The Riddler and Batman in their suits.\n\nA new trailer for Wonder Woman : 1984 which will give us a first look at Kristen Wiig's Cheetah.\n\nCasting announcements and official release date for Aquaman 2. James Wan's involvement as Director and writer will be confirmed. Outline of the plot will be given. Yahya Abdul Mateen and Randall Park to return as Black Manta and Dr. Stephen Shin respectively in the sequel.\n\nThe first official trailer for James Gunn's The Suicide Squad showing off the entire cast.\n\nCasting announcement for the Black Adam movie and plot synopsis.\n\nCasting announcements and plot synopsis for Shazam! 2. David F. Sandberg returning to direct.\n\nCasting announcement for The Flash movie - biggest one being Michael Keaton reprising his role as Bruce Wayne / Batman. This is to officially establish the DC Multiverse on the big screen which was introduced on CW's Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover event. The movie is more a multiverse film than Flashpoint, though it draws inspiration from the latter.\n\nOfficial trailer for Zack Snyder's Justice League showing off never before seen footage so people know this is a completely different film. Steppenwolf's original, scarier look from Batman v Superman will be in this movie and featured in the trailer.\n\nOfficial announcement of David Ayer's Cut of Suicide Squad. It's coming for sure, whether the announcement is at DC FanDome or not is yet to be decided. However, it'll release after Zack Snyder's Justice League. The studio has dubbed this project as \"Ayer Wolf\". Unlike the Snyder Cut , the Ayer Cut does not require any additional photography since it's completely shot , just needs work of VFX which his happening right now.\n\nDetails and casting announcements regarding HBOMax's Justice League Dark series. Take this next sentence alone with a grain of salt - There are unconfirmed rumours of Keanu Reeves reprising his role as John Constantine.\n\nA Cyborg project starring Ray Fisher as Victor Stone is in the works for HBOMax. Whether it will be announced at FanDome or not is unconfirmed.\n\nOfficial announcement regarding the return of Ben Affleck as Batman for a Batfleck project on HBOMax. Affleck will return with his original script for the Batman movie he was supposed to star in featuring Joe Manganiello's Deathstroke and Jared Leto's Joker. It is unclear whether the project will be a movie on HBOMax or turned into a series.\n\nIf you've been to questions.dcfandome.com , you would've noticed the 2 categories \"Secret Movie 1\" and \"Secret Movie 2\". One of them is a Zatanna movie. It is unclear whether it is connected to HBOMax's Justice League Dark series or if it's a standalone film. They might just announce the movie and leave it or announce the actress who's playing Zatanna. The other one is a Batman Beyond movie with Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne. The movie is slated to come out around 2023-2024 and is set in Keaton's Batman Universe which will be established to be a part of DC Multiverse in The Flash film. It will retcon Val Kilmer's and George Clooney's Batmans. Warner Brothers has approached Tim Burton to direct this movie.\n\nThat's all for the HBOMax and Movie part of it.\n\nNow coming to DC Universe, Netflix and CW shows :\n\nPanel for CW Shows- The Flash, Supergirl, Legends of Tomorrow, Black Lightning, Batwoman and Superman and Lois. As of now, there is no update on the Green Arrow and the Canaries spinoff which was supposed to star Katherine Grace McNamara's Mia Queen in the lead.\n\nBatwoman panel is expected to introduce the new lead for Season 2 who will take over the mantle of Batwoman - Ryan Wilder following Ruby Rose's departure from the show. Casting announcement for the same will take place. Scarecrow is rumoured to be the primary antagonist for Season 2 and expect casting for that too.\n\nSuperman and Lois panel will give us a first look at the characters, casting announcements for supporting characters in the show, official plot synopsis and a definitive release date.\n\nThe Flash panel will officially announce the actor set to replace Hartley Sawyer's Elongated Man heading into season 7 following his firing from the show, synopsis for season 7 and definitive release date.\n\nDC's Legends of Tomorrow panel is expected to announce new cast members and characters who'll replace Brandon Routh's The Atom and Maisie Richardson-Sellers' Charlie. Osric Chau's Ryan Choi is likely to be on of the new cast members as he takes on the mantle of The Atom. A new female lead is to be introduced who is \"A woman who was abducted by aliens when she was a child and supposedly imbued with powers that will help the team defeat their intergalactic foes. Either that or she's just crazy\". A definitive release date will also be announced along with a plot synopsis.\n\nSupergirl and Black Lightning panels will give plot synopsis for their respective seasons and definitive release dates.\n\nTitans panel will announce new castings for season 3, plot synopsis and new release date slated for early 2021 .\n\nNetflix's DC Vertigo show Lucifer will have a panel. Keep in mind the first part of Lucifer season 5 drops one day before DC FanDome, i.e. on 21st August 2020. The panel will give us an official release date for season 5 part two and details regarding the recently announced 6th and Final season.\n\nOfficial release date and first look teaser for DC Vertigo's Sandman series on Netflix.\n\nRelease date, synopsis and casting announcements for Pennyworth Season 2.\n\n- Official announcement regarding renewal of the animated Harley Quinn series and plot synopsis for season 3.\n\nAnd lastly we come to videogames which are going to be announced at DC FanDome. There are 2 videogames in development at WB Games Montréal and Rocksteady:\n\nWB Games Montréal's game is titled \"Gotham Knights\" and it serves as a soft reboot to the Arkham franchise. It takes place right after Arkham : Origins (which was the only Arkham game developed by WB Games Montréal and not Rocksteady). The game is set to have Bat Family members as playable characters and it primarily deals with the Court of Owls.\n\nThe game in development by Rocksteady is a Suicide Squad game. All other details will be announced at DC FanDome. Both the games are made to cash in on the hype surrounding the Batman and Suicide Squad films in 2021. Both are going to One of these games is going to release in October-December 2020, however delays can be expected till early 2021 as it happens with all video games.\n\nKeep in mind guys this is barely 60% of what is going to be announced at DC FanDome. I'm not giving away everything because some big announcements are stuff you deserve to hear for yourselves and get blown away. These are all legitimate leaks.\n\nIt's a good time to be a DC fan :)\n\nThe more I read about snippets Zack posted on his Vero account, the more I think it's likely ZSJL will be balls to the wall, unchained, uncompromised, uncensored Zack Snyder iconography and storytelling. Remember that he has at least four hours of footage to work from. The compomises from the studio however are gone. It's possible the studio (Geoff Johns) already had ideas to make the tone lighter and so Zack had to shoot additional scenes to satisfy the studio's needs before the family tragedy struck and he had to leave during post production. By then, the studio could do whatever they wanted and brought Joss Whedon in. It wouldn't surprise me if, in ZSJL, the ending is completely different to drum up interest for a JL2.\n\nNo more Bruce buying the bank, Bruce showing the round table, Clark revealing his classic red and blue suit among the crowd. It'd be more open ended, possibly a cliffhanger, something the studio did not want since they wanted to leave the Snyderverse behind indefinitely. Not sure the general audiences will be receptive of a continuation of a darker take. Then again, Justice League Dark did just that recently. The people who already hated his ideas would definitely not like it though. Then again, they probably wouldn't like it either way. We shall see.\n\nLiterally everyone has said that the Snyder Cut will be a one off. And what on Earth makes you think they're giving Snyder another $200-300 million to make another Justice League movie? One that would assuredly flop at the box office? You guys don't even know if his cut is going to be a success yet lmao. They haven't even bothered to bring Cavill back, something they would have assuredly done by now if they had any plan of continuing with Snyder's original plan.\n\nWe'll see what happens, but it's wild to see you guys acting like this is guaranteed to be a blowout success, to the extent you think they're going to put him in charge of their movies again, when they are still also pivoting away. I mean shit if the rumors about Keaton are true, they aren't planning to go back to Snyder's edgelord take, and we still don't know what they're going to do with Supes. Cavill was saying just the other day there's a bunch of fake rumors going around about him being back, they might still end up recasting and moving on.\n\nDon´t believe leaks that came from random anons but I wouldn´t write the Snyder/Batfleck-verse off either. Not fully. Not after the Snyder Cut.\n\nIf we believe there's even a one percent chance that AT&T is our ally, we have to take it as an absolute certainty.\n\nThe Ayer Cut is the next goal and if that´s all there is then fine. 110% ok with me. But I am ready to campaign some more if the stars start to align.\n\nWe´ll need to see how the Snyder Cut will do first but the reception of BvS has begun to detoxify. MoS was always popular enough and the 2021 film will touch on both so even more casual viewers will begin to see that there was an overall vision. Find enough such people, make them hungry and boom. We are cooking again.\n\nSnyder doesn't need 250 mil to make films look great. Or prestige TV. Unlikely but who knows...\n\nA reconstruction of Snydra´s vison for JLA Part 1:\n\nFM did the lord´s work by keeping hope alive and the people informed though visual breakdowns.\n\nDarkseid and Ares have a full fight for example and history lesson is drowning in extras. This prolonged flashback alone will get people talking.\n\nHumans being turned into Parademons (the theatrical cut pays half-cooked lipservice to this) is from the N52 but obviously much older. The JLA will have a high kill count at the end of the film but it's comic accurate and there is no other way. I love how Zack does his alien invasions. The stakes are though the roof.\n\nEdit: Long hair + beard Superman was supposed to be in JLA Part 2 and film 5. Min 21:10 from Snyder himself. WB took Daddy Superman from me! Nooo.\n\nAbout his revival in the Snyder Cut. The Kryptonian codex from MoS makes it possible and the league is racing to revive him first as they find out that Steppy´s secondary goal is to do that. Cyborg´s Knightmare look is also used in the present day and he seems to be the most reshot character:\n\nIn most other versions Thomas Wayne tries to de-esecelate the situation , but not in this miserable version .\n\nIn Snyder's world A MAN will not just give away the money in his wallet LIKE A PUSSY . In this version Daddy Wayne is a strong MAN who swings his fist ineffectually like A MAN and dies LIKE A MAN . He swinged at the air like adumbass , got shot like a dumbass, his son grew up to be a dombass and im the biggest dumbass for wasting 3 hours of my life on this dreck again .\n\nBatman Begins is a nice film but this is objectively wrong. Unless you think that vintage Frank Miller and Kane & Finger are hacks. Flashpoint Batman even murders Chill.\n\nGrant Morrison had another dark take on this. This reaches all the way back to Batman: Gothic where is borderline abusive as a father but RIP took it to the max.\n\nIt suggests that Batman is dishonoring the values of his father. That´s bleak. Morrison´s Batman further forced Joe Chill into suicide with THE gun he used to kill his parents after waging a prolonged campaign of psychological terror on him. This whole run is God Tier.\n\nThomas is a crook in Batman: Damned and TT´s Batman where he further fought back. I can go on. Synder didn´t just get Batman and his world right. He got him and it the most right outside of animation. Speaking of other adaptations. Thomas fought back on the all-ages Superfriends in the 80s and Batman 1989. The first 2 adaptations of Batman´s origin. That´s why Batman Begins stood out. It was a departure from the norm. Even Adam West as Thomas fought back on Brave & The Bold after 2005 so Begin´s didn´t reverse the popular direction. It instead showed a different path to follow.\n\nEvolution of Death of Waynes in All Media in 10 Minutes (2018)\n\nA look at how much Wayne murder has changed since 1985.Thanks for watching! Make sure to write your suggestions in the comments below.List of media and actor...\n\nEdit: While I am at it. Thomas was retconned into being the original Batman in the Silver Age and Bruce was the first Robin. Another Bill Finger script.\n\nAttaboy, Dad. This was canon for 3 decades as there are works from the early 80s that reference this! The moral of the story is:"
