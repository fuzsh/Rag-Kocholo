        "text": "One pivotal moment for Aaron Dessner transpired in his attic. Upstairs at his former home in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, he recorded the heart-exploding horn outro to what might be the National's signature song, \"Fake Empire.\"\n\n\"You hear the four-over-three rhythm and the piano, which is kind of confusing,\" Dessner explained at a recent live Q&A for Recording Academy members at the New York Chapter office. \"But then there's a verse, chorus, verse, chorus, and then nothing happens.\"\n\nThe band sat around, unsure of how to wrap it up — and then it clicked to do a cathartic brass fanfare.\n\n\"Fake Empire\" ended up being the opening track of 2007's Boxer, their critically acclaimed fourth album that put them on the map. Once Barack Obama used it as his 2008 campaign theme song. \"Without the words, with just the music,\" clarified Dessner. Regardless, \"it became a real life-changing moment for us.\"\n\nAnother pivotal moment for Aaron Dessner happened at his kitchen table. \"John, you were there, right? When I got the text?\" he asked the prodigious engineer Jonathan Low, who's worked with the National for years, seated to his right. It turned out to be Taylor Swift. That text led to Folklore and Evermore. The former won a GRAMMY for Album Of The Year.\n\nThis true story of Dessner's ascent to the upper echelon of recordmaking seems slightly unbelievable, if only because he's so bracingly normal. Speaking to the small crowd at the newly established four-story office in Murray Hill, Dessner projected zero egotism as he held forth on his rise from indie darling to unlikely pop impresario.\n\nSpeaking to music industry giant Nabil Ayers, the two-time GRAMMY winner began the chronology of the conversation in 2009. That was the year Ayers began his tenure at the label 4AD — he now works with their parent company, Beggars Group — and the National were making High Violet, their follow-up to Boxer.\n\nAt that juncture in his career, Dessner and his brother, Bryce, had co-produced and curated Dark Was The Night, a compilation spilling over with indie stars that benefited the Red Hot Organization, a not-for-profit that raises awareness of HIV/AIDS. \"We came there with a big, phony million-dollar check for you to give to Red Hot,\" Ayers noted mirthfully.\n\nIn that garage studio behind Dessner's house, Ayers realized he was dealing with a different kind of cat. \"Oh, this guy's not just the guitar player in this great rock band,\" he remembered thinking, \"but actually, he's the person who's very closely involved with the recording and making of the records.\"\n\nDessner, a born tinkerer, had built that studio with the Boxer money; in some ways, he was at the very beginning of his journey as a recordist. \"That's when we met, and that's when I felt like I was a producer in my own…\" he said, hesitating on what was probably the word \"right.\" \"I didn't know what that meant at the time.\"\n\nEager to learn through experience, Dessner forged ahead in that 400-square-foot space, and began recording albums for artists outside of the National: Sharon Van Etten's 2012 album Tramp, released around the time his band was making Trouble Will Find Me, was the first.\n\nAt that point, Dessner brought up Low, whose resumé is astounding; it includes a little album called Midnights. (Well, two tracks on the 3am Edition.) The two men met around the turn of the decade, when Dessner entered a Philadelphia studio to record drums on Tramp; Low was working there.\n\nSince then, Low's worked with the National extensively — on 2013's Trouble Will Find Me, on 2017's Sleep Well Beast, on 2019's I Am Easy to Find. \"From that day forward, I basically made it my life goal to lure him wherever I went,\" Dessner said. \"Now, I try to not let him go anywhere else.\"\n\nDessner's story then took him to the birth of his three children, and the related move to Hudson, New York, where he bought an 18th-century farmhouse and began recording at various studios upstate. This led to his purchase of a barn in Hudson Valley that Dessner converted into Long Pond Studio.\n\n\"It's built on the scale of a church, so it's got very high ceilings,\" Dessner says, praising its cedar treatment and sauna-like smell. \"We had to build it really fast, because we had to basically make a National record to pay for it.\" The result was 2017's Sleep Well Beast; the structure looms on its crepuscular cover.\n\nFrom there, Dessner's work as a producer for outside artists exploded: he helmed records by Local Natives, the Lone Bellow, Frightened Rabbit and others.\n\nAfter a decade of gestation, his duo with Bon Iver's Justin Vernon, Big Red Machine, released their self-titled debut album in 2018; the lion's share of it was recorded in the converted barn. (In 2021, they released a follow-up, How Long Do You Think It's Gonna Last? Featuring a litany of guest vocalists, from Swift to Anaïs Mitchell to Fleet Foxes.)\n\nAt the New York Chapter office, Swift's presence loomed heavy, and Dessner's gratitude and reverence toward her shone through his expressions. He met her in 2014, when the National played \"SNL\" and Swift was deep in her 1989 era.\n\n\"She was just so lovely and kind and interested and cool, and I could tell she was a fan,\" Dessner recalls. \"That was such a perfect record. It was just this weird meeting of: we were in such different worlds, but it was cool.\"\n\nFive years later, Swift saw the National perform in Prospect Park; when he and his brother got to talking with her, their collegial friendship deepened.\n\n\"I think she already knew that we write music first,\" Dessner said, foreshadowing his work on Folklore and Evermore, as well as similarly conceptualized works like Ed Sheeran's upcoming Subtract. \"It's what we call sketches, but they're basically fully realized musical ideas that don't have words and vocal melodies, but have a lot of internal melody.\"\n\nIn March 2020, he pressed send on a massive Dropbox folder of those \"sketches.\" Deep into that night, \"at 2:00 a.m., my phone buzzed, and it was a voice memo from her,\" he remembers. \"With the song 'Cardigan.'\"\n\nAfter the pair completed Folklore, they simply couldn't stop making songs. \"She's a real magic person in the sense that she has such an incisive, acute songwriting ability, and a crazy sense of melody,\" he said.\n\nThe most goosebump-inducing part of \"Up Close & Personal with Aaron Dessner\" was Dessner's description of how they made the Folklore and Evermore songs remotely — without even management knowing. \"Sometimes, I would send Taylor an instrumental, go for a run down to the Hudson River, run back, and there'd be a song.\"\n\nThat uncanny sense of alchemy was unlike anything Dessner had encountered before: he even found himself growing superstitious on those runs. \"Occasionally, I would see a snake down at the river, and I would research the snake,\" he said. \"It was a copperhead, that was good luck — so I was looking for the copperhead.\" Clearly, he remains in awe at the creative arc he co-piloted.\n\nDessner then made his way to recording Ed Sheeran's latest, as well as the National's new album, First Two Pages of Frankenstein — out April 28. The experience of making the former, as detailed in Sheeran's recent Rolling Stone cover story, was revelatory.\n\n\"He felt disarmed,\" Dessner said of Sheeran. \"He wasn't trying to perfect something that would work commercially, or write the perfect pop statement. [He was] allowing himself to bring to page, and write to — and also be inspired by — someone else's music.\"\n\nAs per First Two Pages of Frankenstein, it wasn't even a given the National would make another record. \"[The National singer] Matt Berninger, who lives in LA, had been going through a hard time personally,\" he admits. \"There had been a lot of friction in the band.\" Still, Swift laid a fascinating prognostication on him.\n\n\"She predicted that what would happen after all this was that we would lean into each other and make our best record, because we would have all this perspective,\" he recalls. At first, the process was slightly awkward and hesitant — and then it rapidly gained steam.\n\nSpeaking to GRAMMY.com before the event, Dessner connected this creative flourish to his numberless hours as a studio rat. \"When I came back into the band, it was like I had gained a lot of experience,\" he says. \"Almost like I'd been in some sort of accelerated crash course in production and recording.\"\n\nDessner is thrilled about how First Two Pages of Frankenstein came out; he frames it as something of an ultimate National album. \"You hear all the elements that make the National what it is. The simplicity on the surface, and the complexity and depth behind it… It reveals itself over a lot of listening.\"\n\nIt was enthralling to hear the arc of the guitarist Ayers met in that garage met more than a decade ago; the profundity of that moment made even more exciting by the intimate setting of Dessner's conversation. First Two Pages of Frankenstein, which features production from Dessner and a Swift vocal turn on \"The Alcott,\" also represents something of a culmination.\n\n\"It became very powerful,\" Dessner expressed that energy during the one-on-one interview. \"It feels to me like the beginning of a new chapter.\" If his entire career up to this point turned out to be a ramp-up, hold on tight.\n\nTaylor Swift's Road To Folklore: How The Superstar Evolved From 'Diaristic' Country Tunes To Her Most Progressive Music Yet\n\nThree months after OneRepublic began promoting their sixth album, Artificial Paradise, in February 2022, the band unexpectedly had their biggest release in nearly a decade. The pop-rock band's carefree jam, \"I Ain't Worried,\" soundtracked Top Gun: Maverick's most memeable scene and quickly became a global smash — ultimately delaying album plans in favor of promoting their latest hit.\n\nTwo years later, \"I Ain't Worried\" is one of 16 tracks on Artificial Paradise, which arrived July 12. It's a seamless blend of songs that will resonate with longtime and newer fans alike. From the layered production of \"Hurt,\" to the feel-good vibes of \"Serotonin,\" to the evocative lyrics of \"Last Holiday,\" Artificial Paradise shows that OneRepublic's sound is as dialed-in as it is ever-evolving.\n\nThe album also marks the end of an era for OneRepublic, as it's the last in their contract with Interscope Records. But for the group's singer, Ryan Tedder, that means the future is even more exciting than it's been in their entire 15-year career.\n\n\"I've never been more motivated to write the best material of my life than this very moment,\" he asserts. \"I'm taking it as a challenge. We've had a lot of fun, and a lot of uplifting records for the last seven or eight years, but I also want to tap back into some deeper material with the band.\"\n\nAs he's been prepping Artificial Paradise with his OneRepublic cohorts, Tedder has also been as busy as he's ever been working with other artists. His career as a songwriter/producer took off almost simultaneously with OneRepublic's 2007 breakthrough, \"Apologize\" (his first major behind-the-board hit was Leona Lewis' \"Bleeding Love\"); to this day he's one of the go-to guys for pop's biggest names, from BLACKPINK to Tate McRae.\n\nTedder sat down with GRAMMY.com to share some of his most prominent memories of OneRepublic's biggest songs, as well as some of the hits he's written with Beyoncé, Adele, Taylor Swift and more.\n\nOneRepublic — \"Apologize,\" 'Dreaming Out Loud' (2007)\n\nI was producing and writing other songs for different artists on Epic and Atlantic — I was just cutting my teeth as a songwriter in L.A. This is like 2004. I was at my lowest mentally and financially. I was completely broke. Creditors chasing me, literally dodging the taxman and getting my car repoed, everything.\n\nI had that song in my back pocket for four years. A buddy of mine just reminded me last month, a songwriter from Nashville — Ashley Gorley, actually. We had a session last month, me, him and Amy Allen, and he brought it up. He was like, \"Is it true, the story about 'Apologize'? You were completely broke living in L.A. and Epic Records offered you like 100 grand or something just for the right to record the song on one of their artists?\"\n\nAnd that is true. It was, like, 20 [grand], then 50, then 100. And I was salivating. I was, like, I need this money so bad. And I give so many songs to other people, but with that song, I drew a line in the sand and said, \"No one will sing this song but me. I will die with this song.\"\n\nIt was my story, and I just didn't want anyone else to sing it. It was really that simple. It was a song about my past relationships, it was deeply personal. And it was also the song that — I spent two years trying to figure out what my sound was gonna be. I was a solo artist… and I wasn't landing on anything compelling. Then I landed on \"Apologize\" and a couple of other songs, and I was like, These songs make me think of a band, not solo artist material. So it was the song that led me to the sound of OneRepublic, and it also led me to the idea that I should start a band and not be a solo artist.\n\nWe do it every night. I'll never not do it. I've never gotten sick of it once. Every night that we do it, whether I'm in Houston or Hong Kong, I look out at the crowd and look at the band, and I'm like, Wow. This is the song that got us here.\n\nBeyoncé — \"Halo,\" 'I Am…Sacha Fierce' (2008)\n\nWe were halfway through promoting Dreaming Out Loud, our first album. I played basketball every day on tour, and I snapped my Achilles. The tour got canceled. The doctor told me not to even write. And I had this one sliver of an afternoon where my wife had to run an errand. And because I'm sadistic and crazy, I texted [songwriter] Evan Bogart, \"I got a three-hour window, race over here. Beyoncé called me and asked me to write her a song. I want to do it with you.\" He had just come off his huge Rihanna No. 1, and we had an Ashley Tisdale single together.\n\nWhen you write enough songs, not every day do the clouds part and God looks down on you and goes, \"Here.\" But that's what happened on that day. I turn on the keyboard, the first sound that I play is the opening sound of the song. Sounds like angels singing. And we wrote the song pretty quick, as I recall.\n\nI didn't get a response [from Beyoncé after sending \"Halo\" over], which I've now learned is very, very typical of her. I did Miley Cyrus and Beyoncé \"II MOST WANTED\" [from COWBOY CARTER] — I didn't know that was coming out 'til five days before it came out. And when I did \"XO\" [from 2013's Beyoncé], I found out that \"XO\" was coming out 12 hours before it came out. That's how she operates.\n\nOneRepublic — \"Good Life,\" 'Waking Up' (2009)\n\n[\"Good Life\"] was kind of a Hail Mary. We already knew that \"All the Right Moves\" would be the first single [from Waking Up]. We knew that \"Secrets\" was the second single. And in the 11th hour, our engineer at the time — who I ended up signing as a songwriter, Noel Zancanella — had this drum loop that he had made, and he played it for Brent [Kutzle] in our band. Brent said, \"You gotta hear this drum loop that Noel made. It's incredible.\"\n\nHe played it for me the next morning, and I was like, \"Yo throw some chords to this. I'm writing to this today.\" They threw some chords down, and the first thing out of my mouth was, [sings] \"Oh, this has gotta be the good life.\"\n\nIt's the perfect example of, oftentimes, the chord I've tried to strike with this band with some of our bigger records, [which] is happy sad. Where you feel nostalgic and kind of melancholic, but at the same time, euphoric. That's what those chords and that melody did for me.\n\nI was like, \"Hey guys, would it be weird if I made the hook a whistle?\" And everyone was like, \"No! Do not whistle!\" They're like, \"Name the last hit song that had a whistle.\" And the only one I could think of was, like, Scorpion from like, 1988. [Laughs.] So I thought, To hell with it, man, it's been long enough, who cares? Let's try it. And the whistle kind of made the record. It became such a signature thing.\n\nAdele — \"Rumour Has It,\" '21' (2011)\n\n\"Rumour Has It\" was the first song I did in probably a four year period, with any artist, that wasn't a ballad. All any artist ever wanted me to write with them or for them, was ballads, because of \"Halo,\" and \"Apologize\" and \"Bleeding Love.\"\n\nI begged [Adele] to do a [song with] tempo, because we did \"Turning Tables,\" another ballad. She was in a feisty mood [that day], so I was like, \"Okay, we're doing a tempo today!\"\n\nRick Rubin was originally producing the whole album. I was determined to produce Adele, not just write — because I wanted a shot to show her that I could, and to show myself. I stayed later after she left, and I remember thinking, What can I do in this record in this song that could be so difficult to reproduce that it might land me the gig?\n\nSo I intentionally muted the click track, changed the tempo, and [created that] whole piano bridge. I was making it up as I went. When she got in that morning. I said, \"I have a crazy idea for a bridge. It's a movie.\" She listens and she says, \"This is really different, I like this! How do we write to this?\"\n\nI mean, it was very difficult. [But] we finished the song. She recorded the entire song that day. She recorded the whole song in one take. I've never seen anyone do that in my life — before or since.\n\nThen I didn't hear from her for six months. Because I handed over the files, and Rick Rubin's doing it, so I don't need to check on it. I randomly check on the status of the song — and at this point, if you're a songwriter or producer, you're assuming that they're not keeping the songs. Her manager emails my manager, \"Hey, good news — she's keeping both songs they did, and she wants Ryan to finish 'Rumour Has It' production and mix it.\"\n\nWhen I finally asked her, months later — probably at the GRAMMYs — I said, \"Why didn't [Rick] do it?\" She said, \"Oh he did. It's that damn bridge! Nobody could figure out what the hell you were doing…It was so problematic that we just gave up on it.\"\n\nOneRepublic — \"Counting Stars,\" 'Native' (2013)\n\nI was in a Beyoncé camp in the Hamptons writing for the self-titled album. [There were] a bunch of people in the house — me, Greg Kurstin, Sia — it was a fun group of people. I had four days there, and every morning I'd get up an hour and a half before I had to leave, make a coffee, and start prepping for the day. On the third day, I got up, I'm in the basement of this house at like 7 in the morning, and I'm coming up with ideas. I stumble across that chord progression, the guitar and the melody. It was instant shivers up my spine.\n\n\"Lately I've been losing sleep, dreaming about the things that we could be\" is the only line that I had. [My] first thought was, I should play this for Beyoncé, and then I'm listening to it and going, This is not Beyoncé, not even remotely. It'd be a waste. So I tabled it, and I texted the guys in my band, \"Hey, I think I have a potentially really big record. I'm going to finish it when I get back to Denver.\"\n\nI got back the next week, started recording it, did four or five versions of the chorus, bouncing all the versions off my wife, and then eventually landed it. And when I played it for the band, they were like, \"This is our favorite song.\"\n\nTaylor Swift — \"Welcome to New York,\" '1989' (2014)\n\nIt was my second session with Taylor. The first one was [1989's] \"I Know Places,\" and she sent me a voice memo. I was looking for a house in Venice [California], because we were spending so much time in L.A. So that whole memory is attached to me migrating back to Los Angeles.\n\nBut I knew what she was talking about, because I lived in New York, and I remember the feeling — endless possibilities, all the different people and races and sexes and loves. That was her New York chapter. She was so excited to be there. If you never lived there, and especially if you get there and you've got a little money in the pocket, it is so exhilarating.\n\nIt was me just kind of witnessing her brilliant, fast-paced, lyrical wizardry. [Co-producer] Max [Martin] and I had a conversation nine months later at the GRAMMYs, when we had literally just won for 1989. He kind of laughed, he pointed to all the other producers on the album, and he's like, \"If she had, like, three more hours in the day, she would just figure out what we do and she would do it. And she wouldn't need any of us.\"\n\nAnd I still think that's true. Some people are just forces of nature in and among themselves, and she's one of them. She just blew me away. She's the most talented top liner I've ever been in a room with, bar none. If you're talking lyric and melody, I've never been in a room with anyone faster, more adept, knows more what they want to say, focused, efficient, and just talented.\n\nJonas Brothers — \"Sucker,\" 'Happiness Begins' (2019)\n\nI had gone through a pretty dry spell mentally, emotionally. I had just burned it at both ends and tapped out, call it end of 2016. So, really, all of 2017 for me was a blur and a wash. I did a bunch of sessions in the first three months of the year, and then I just couldn't get a song out. I kept having, song after song, artists telling me it's the first single, [then] the song was not even on the album. I had never experienced that in my career.\n\nI went six to nine months without finishing a song, which for me is unheard of. Andrew Watt kind of roped me back into working with him. We did \"Easier\" for 5 Seconds of Summer, and we did some Sam Smith and some Miley Cyrus, and right in that same window, I did this song \"Sucker.\" Two [or] three months later, Wendy Goldstein from Republic [Records] heard the record, I had sent it to her. She'd said, very quietly, \"We're relaunching the Jonas Brothers. They want you to be involved in a major way. Do you have anything?\"\n\nShe calls me, she goes, \"Ryan, do not play this for anybody else. This is their comeback single. It's a No. 1 record. Watch what we're gonna do.\" And she delivered.\n\nOneRepublic — \"I Ain't Worried,\" 'Top Gun: Maverick' Soundtrack (2022)\n\nMy memory is, being in lockdown in COVID, and just being like, Who knows when this is going to end, working out of my Airstream at my house. I had done a lot of songs for movies over the years, and [for] that particular [song] Randy Spendlove, who runs [music at] Paramount, called me.\n\nI end up Zooming with Tom Cruise [and Top Gun: Maverick director] Jerry Bruckheimer — everybody's in lockdown during post-production. The overarching memory was, Holy cow, I'm doing the scene, I'm doing the song for Top Gun. I can't believe this is happening. But the only way I knew how to approach it, rather than to, like, overreact and s— the bed, was, It's just another day.\n\nI do prescription songs for movies, TV, film all the time. I love a brief. It's so antithetical to most writers. I'm either uncontrollably lazy or the most productive person you've ever met. And the dividing line between the two is, if I'm chasing some directive, some motivation, some endpoint, then I can be wildly productive.\n\nI just thought, I'm going to do the absolute best thing I can do for this scene and serve the film. OneRepublic being the performing artist was not on the menu in my mind. I just told them, \"I think you need a cool indie band sounding, like, breakbeat.\" I used adjectives to describe what I heard when I saw the scene, and Tom got really ramped and excited.\n\nYou could argue [it's the biggest song] since the band started. The thing about it is, it's kind of become one of those every summer [hits]. And when it blew up, that's what Tom said. He said, \"Mark my words, dude. You're gonna have a hit with this every summer for, like, the next 20 years or more.\"\n\nAnd that's what happened. The moment Memorial Day happened, \"I Ain't Worried\" got defrosted and marched itself back into the top 100.\n\nTate McRae — \"Greedy,\" 'THINK LATER' (2023)\n\nWe had \"10:35\" [with Tiësto] the previous year that had been, like, a No. 1 in the UK and across Europe and Australia. So we were coming off the back of that, and the one thing she was clear about was, \"That is not the direction of what I want to do.\"\n\nIf my memory serves me correct, \"greedy\" was the next to last session we had. Everything we had done up to that point was kind of dark, midtempo, emotional. So \"greedy\" was the weirdo outlier. I kept pushing her to do a dance record. I was like, \"Tate, there's a lot of people that have great voices, and there's a lot of people who can write, but none of those people are professional dancers like you are. Your secret weapon is the thing you're not using. In this game and this career, you've got to use every asset that you have and exploit it.\"\n\nThere was a lot of cajoling. On that day, we did it, and I thought it was badass, and loved it. And she was like, \"Ugh, what do we just do? What is this?\"\n\nSo then it was just, like, months, months and months of me constantly bringing that song back up, and playing it for her, and annoying the s— out of her. And she came around on it.\n\nShe has very specific taste. So much of the music with Tate, it really is her steering. I'll do what I think is like a finished version of a song, and then she will push everyone for weeks, if not months, to extract every ounce of everything out of them, to push the song harder, further, edgier — 19 versions of a song, until finally she goes, \"Okay, this is the one.\" She's a perfectionist.\n\nOneRepublic — \"Last Holiday,\" 'Artificial Paradise' (2024)\n\nI love [our latest single] \"Hurt,\" but my favorite song on the album is called \"Last Holiday.\" I probably started the beginning of that lyric, I'm not joking, seven, eight years ago. But I didn't finish it 'til this past year.\n\nThe verses are little maxims and words of advice that I've been given throughout the years. It's almost cynical in a way, the song. When I wrote the chorus, I was definitely in kind of a down place. So the opening line is, \"So I don't believe in the stars anymore/ They never gave me what I wished for.\" And it's, obviously, a very not-so-slight reference to \"Counting Stars.\" But it's also hopeful — \"We've got some problems, okay, but this isn't our last holiday.\"\n\nIt's very simple sentiments. Press pause. Take some moments. Find God before it all ends. All these things with this big, soaring chorus. Musically and emotionally and sonically, that song — and \"Hurt,\" for sure — but \"Last Holiday\" is extremely us-sounding.\n\nThe biggest enemy that we've had over the course of 18 years, I'll be the first to volunteer, is, this ever-evolving, undulating sound. No one's gonna accuse me of making these super complex concept albums, because that's just not how my brain's wired. I grew up listening to the radio. I didn't grow up hanging out in the Bowery in CBGBs listening to Nick Cave. So for us, the downside to that, and for me doing all these songs for all these other people, is the constant push and pull of \"What is their sound? What genre is it?\"\n\nI couldn't put a pin in exactly what the sound is, but what I would say is, if you look at the last 18 years, a song like \"Last Holiday\" really encompasses, sonically, what this band is about. It's very moving, and emotional, and dynamic. It takes me to a place — that's the best way for me to put it. And hopefully the listener finds the same.\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nMoby’s past and present are converging in a serendipitous way. The multiple-GRAMMY nominee is celebrating the 25th anniversary of his seminal work, Play, the best-selling electronic dance music album of all time, and the release of his latest album, always centered at night.\n\nWhere Play was a solitary creation experience for Moby, always centered at night is wholly collaborative. Recognizable names on the album are Lady Blackbird on the blues-drenched \"dark days\" and serpentwithfeet on the emotive \"on air.\" But always centered at night’s features are mainly lesser-known artists, such as the late Benjamin Zephaniah on the liquid jungle sounds of \"where is your pride?\" and Choklate on the slow grooves of \"sweet moon.\"\n\nMoby’s music proves to have staying power: His early ‘90s dance hits \"Go\" and \"Next is the E\" still rip up dancefloors; the songs on Play are met with instant emotional reactions from millennials who heard them growing up. Moby is even experiencing a resurgence of sorts with Gen Z. In 2023, Australian drum ‘n’ bass DJ/producer Luude and UK vocalist Issey Cross reimagined Moby’s classic \"Porcelain\" into \"Oh My.\" Earlier this year, Moby released \"You and Me\" with Italian DJ/producer Anfisa Letyago.\n\nMusic is just one of Moby’s many creative ventures. He wrote and directedPunk Rock Vegan Movie as well as writing and starring in his homemade documentary,Moby Doc. The two films are produced by his production company, Little Walnut, which also makes music videos, shorts and the podcast \"Moby Pod.\" Moby and co-host Lindsay Hicks have an eclectic array of guests, from actor Joe Manganiello to Ed Begley, Jr., Steve-O and Hunter Biden. The podcast interviews have led to \"some of the most meaningful interpersonal experiences,\" Moby tells GRAMMY.com.\n\nA upcoming episode of \"Moby Pod\" dedicated to Play was taped live over two evenings at Los Angeles’ Masonic Lodge at Hollywood Forever Cemetery. The episode focuses on Moby recounting his singular experiences around the unexpected success of that album — particularly considering the abject failure of his previous album, Animal Rights. The narrative was broken up by acoustic performances of songs from Play, as well as material from Always Centered at Night (which arrives June 14) with special guest Lady Blackbird. Prior to the taping, Moby spoke to GRAMMY.com about both albums.\n\n'Always centered at night' started as a label imprint then became the title of your latest album. How did that happen?\n\nI realized pretty quickly that I just wanted to make music and not necessarily worry about being a label boss. Why make more busy work for myself?\n\nThe first few songs were this pandemic process of going to SoundCloud, Spotify, YouTube and asking people for recommendations to find voices that I wasn’t familiar with, and then figuring out how to get in touch with them. The vast majority of the time, they would take the music I sent them and write something phenomenal.\n\nThat's the most interesting part of working with singers you've never met: You don't know what you're going to get. My only guidance was: Let yourself be creative, let yourself be idiosyncratic, let the lyrics be poetic. We're not writing for a pop audience, we don't need to dumb it down. Although, apparently Lady Blackbird is one of Taylor Swift's favorite singers.\n\nGuiding the collaborators away from pop music is an unusual directive, although perhaps not for you?\n\nWhat is both sad and interesting is pop has come to dominate the musical landscape to such an extent that it seems a lot of musicians don't know they're allowed to do anything else. Some younger people have grown up with nothing but pop music. Danaé Wellington, who sings \"Wild Flame,\" her first pass of lyrics were pop. I went back to her and said, \"Please be yourself, be poetic.\" And she said, \"Well, that’s interesting because I’m the poet laureate of Manchester.\" So getting her to disregard pop lyrics and write something much more personal and idiosyncratic was actually easy and really special.\n\nYou certainly weren’t going in the pop direction when making 'Play,' but it ended up being an extremely popular album. Did you have a feeling it was going to blow up the way it did?\n\nI have a funny story. I had a date in January 1999 in New York. We went out drinking and I had just gotten back the mastered version of Play. We're back at my apartment, and before our date became \"grown up,\" we listened to the record from start to finish. She actually liked it. And I thought, Huh, that's interesting. I didn't think anyone was going to like this record.\n\nYou didn’t feel anything different during the making of 'Play?'\n\nI knew to the core of my being that Play was going to be a complete, abject failure. There was no doubt in my mind whatsoever. It was going to be my last record and it was going to fail. That was the time of people going into studios and spending half a million dollars. It was Backstreet Boys and Limp Bizkit and NSYNC; big major label records that were flawlessly produced. Play was made literally in my bedroom.\n\nI slept under the stairs like Harry Potter in my loft on Mott Street. I had one bedroom and that's where I made the record on the cheapest of cheap equipment held up literally on milk crates. Two of the songs were recorded to cassette, that's how cheap the record was. It was this weird record made by a has-been, a footnote from the early rave days. There was no world where I thought it was going to be even slightly successful. Daniel Miller from Mute said — and I remember this very clearly — \"I think this record might sell over 50,000 copies.\" And I said, \"That’s kind of you to say but let's admit that this is going to be a failure. Thank you for releasing my last record.\"\n\nWas your approach in making 'Play' different from other albums?\n\nThe record I had made before Play, Animal Rights, was this weird, noisy metal punk industrial record that almost everybody hated. I remember this moment so vividly: I was playing Glastonbury in 1998 and it was one of those miserable Glastonbury years. When it's good, it's paradise; it's really special. But the first time I played, it was disgusting, truly. A foot and a half of mud everywhere, incessant rain and cold. I was telling my manager that I wanted to make another punk rock metal record. And he said the most gentle thing, \"I know you enjoy making punk rock and metal. People really enjoy when you make electronic music.\"\n\nThe way he said it, he wasn't saying, \"You would help your career by making electronic music.\" He simply said, \"People enjoy it.\" If I had been my manager, I would have said, \"You're a f—ing idiot. Everyone hated that record. What sort of mental illness and masochism is compelling you to do it again?\" Like Freud said, the definition of mental illness is doing the same thing and expecting different results. But his response was very emotional and gentle and sweet, and that got through to me. I had this moment where I realized, I can make music that potentially people will enjoy that will make them happy. Why not pursue that?\n\nThat was what made me not spend my time in ‘98 making an album inspired by Sepultura and Pantera and instead make something more melodic and electronic.\n\nAfter years of swearing off touring, what’s making you hit stages this summer?\n\nI love playing live music. If you asked me to come over and play Neil Young songs in your backyard, I would say yes happily, in a second. But going on tour, the hotels and airports and everything, I really dislike it.\n\nMy manager tricked me. He found strategically the only way to get me to go on tour was to give the money to animal rights charities. My philanthropic Achilles heel. The only thing that would get me to go on tour. It's a brief tour of Europe, pretty big venues, which is interesting for an old guy, but when the tour ends, I will have less money than when the tour begins.\n\nYour DJ sets are great fun. Would you consider doing DJ dates locally?\n\nEvery now and then I’ll do something. But there’s two problems. As I've become very old and very sober, I go to sleep at 9 p.m. This young guy I was helping who was newly sober, he's a DJ. He was doing a DJ set in L.A. and he said, \"You should come down. There's this cool underground scene.\" I said, \"Great! What time are you playing?\" And he said \"I’m going on at 1 a.m.\" By that point I've been asleep for almost five hours.\n\nI got invited to a dinner party recently that started at 8 p.m. and I was like, \"What are you on? Cocaine in Ibiza? You're having dinner at 8 p.m. What craziness is that? That’s when you're putting on your soft clothes and watching a '30 Rock' rerun before bed. That's not going out time.\" And the other thing is, unfortunately, like a lot of middle aged or elderly musicians, I have a little bit of tinnitus so I have to be very cautious around loud music.\n\nAre you going to write a third memoir at any point?\n\nOnly when I figure out something to write. It's definitely not going to be anecdotes about sobriety because my anecdotes are: woke up at 5 a.m., had a smoothie, read The New York Times, lamented the fact that people are voting for Trump, went for a hike, worked on music, played with Bagel the dog, worked on music some more went to sleep, good night. It would be so repetitive and boring.\n\nIt has to be something about lived experience and wisdom. But I don't know if I've necessarily gotten to the point where I have good enough lived experience and wisdom to share with anyone. Maybe if I get to that point, I'll probably be wrong, but nonetheless, that would warrant maybe writing another book.\n\nMachinedrum's New Album '3FOR82' Taps Into The Spirit Of His Younger Years\n\nBeloved by fans around the globe, yet increasingly unaffordable for many artists, concert tours are central to the world of entertainment and local economies. After the pandemic-era global shuttering of concert venues large and small, tours are back, and bigger than ever.\n\nTaylor Swift’s Eras Tour issmashing records, selling more than four million tickets and earning more than $1 billion. But that tour made headlines for another reason: as reported inBusiness Insider and other outlets, for a six-month period in 2023, Swift’s two jets spent a combined 166 hours in the air between concerts, shuttling at most a total of 28 passengers.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, heightened concerns about the global environmental cost of concert touring have led a number of prominent artists to launch initiatives. Those efforts seek both to mitigate the negative effects of touring and communicate messages about sustainability to concertgoers.\n\nA 2023 study sponsored by Texas-based electricity provider Payless Power found that the carbon footprint of many touring bands was massive. In 2022, concert tours in five genres — country, classic rock, hip-hop/rap, metal and pop — were responsible for CO2 emissions totaling nearly 45,000 metric tons. A so-called greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide contributes to climate change by radiative forcing; increased levels of CO2 also contribute to health problems.\n\nNo serious discussion of climate issues suggests a worldwide halt to live music touring, but there exists much room for improvement. Both on their own and with the help of dedicated nonprofit organizations, many artists are taking positive steps toward mitigating the deleterious effects that touring exerts upon the environment.\n\nSmart tour planning is one way to lessen an artist’s carbon footprint. Ed Sheeran’s 2022 European run minimized flights between concert venues, making that leg of his tour the year's most environmentally efficient. Total carbon dioxide emissions (from flights and driving) on Sheeran’s tour came to less than 150 metric tons. In contrast, Dua Lipa’s tour during the same period generated 12 times as much — more than 1800 metric tons — of CO2.\n\nIn July, singer/songwriter and four-time GRAMMY nominee Jewel will embark on her first major tour in several years, alongside GRAMMY winner Melissa Etheridge. During the planning stage for the 28-city tour, Jewel suggested an idea that could reduce the tour’s carbon footprint.\n\n\"I always thought it was so silly and so wasteful — and so carbon footprint-negative — to have separate trucks, separate lighting, separate crews, separate hotel rooms, separate costs,\" Jewel says. She pitched the idea of sharing a backing band with Etheridge. \"I’ve been trying to do this for 25 years,\" Jewel says with a laugh. \"Melissa is the first person who took me up on it!\"\n\nThe changes will not only reduce the tour’s carbon footprint, but they’ll also lessen the cost of taking the shows on the road. Acknowledging that there are many opportunities to meet the challenges of touring’s negative impact upon the environment, Jewel emphasizes that “you have to find [solutions] that work for you.”\n\nSheeran and Jewel aren’t the only popular artists trying to make a difference. A number of high profile artists have become actively involved in creating the momentum for positive change. Those artists believe that their work on sustainability issues goes hand in hand with their role as public figures. Their efforts take two primary forms: making changes themselves, andadvocating for action among their fans.\n\nThe Climate Machine\n\nNorhan Bayomi is an Egypt-born environmental scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a key member of theEnvironmental Solutions Initiative, a program launched to address sustainable climate action. She’s also a recording artist in the trance genre, working under the nameNourey.\n\nThe ESI collaborates with industry heavyweights Live Nation, Warner Music Group and others as well with touring/recording acts likeColdplay to examine the carbon footprint of the music industry. A key component of the ESI is theClimate Machine, a collaborative research group that seeks to help the live music industry reduce carbon emissions. \"As a research institution, we bring technologies and analytics to understand, in the best way possible, the actual impact of the music industry upon climate change,\" says John Fernández, Director of the ESI.\n\n\"I’m very interested in exploring ways that we can bridge between environmental science, climate change and music fans,\" Bayomi says. She explains that the tools at the ESI’s disposal include \"virtual reality, augmented reality and generative AI,\" media forms that can communicate messages to music fans and concertgoers. Fernández says that those endeavors are aimed at \"enlisting, enabling and inspiring people to get engaged in climate change.\"\n\nThe Environmental Solutions Initiative cites Coldplay as a high-profile success. The band and its management issued an \"Emissions Update\" documentin June 2024, outlining its success at achieving their goal of reducing direct carbon emissions from show production, freight, band and crew travel. The established target was a 50 percent cut in emissions compared to Coldplay’s previous tour; the final result was a 59 percent reduction between their 2022-23 tour and 2016-17 tour.\n\nA significant part of that reduction came as a result of a renewable-energy based battery system that powers audio and lights. The emissions data in the update was reviewed and independently validated by MIT’s Fernández.\n\nChange Is Reverberating\n\nGuitarist Adam Gardner is a founding member of Massachusetts-based indie rockersGuster, but he's more than just a singer in a rock band. Gardner is also the co-founder ofREVERB, one of the organizations at the forefront of developing and implementing climate-focused sustainability initiatives.\n\nFounded in 2004 by Gardner and his wife, environmental activist Lauren Sullivan, REVERB began with a goal of making touring more sustainable; over the years its focus has expanded to promote industry-wide changes. Today, the organization promotes sustainability throughout the industry in partnership with music artists, concert venues and festivals.\n\nREVERB initiatives have included efforts to eliminate single-use plastics at the California Roots Music & Arts Festival, clean energy projects in cooperation with Willie Nelson and Billie Eilish, and efforts with other major artists. Gardner has seen sustainability efforts grow over two decades\n\n\"It’s really amazing to see the [change] with artists, with venues, with fans,\" Gardner says. \"Today, people are not just giving lip service to sustainable efforts; they really want to do things that are real and measurable.\"\n\nTheMusic Decarbonization Project is one tangible example of REVERB’s successes. \"Diesel power is one of the dirtiest sources of power,\" Gardner explains. \"And it’s an industry standard to power festival stages with diesel generators.\" Working withWillie Nelson, the organization helped switch the power sources at his annual Luck Reunion to clean energy. At last year’s festival, Nelson’s headlining stage drew 100 percent of its power from solar-powered batteries. \"We set up a temporary solar farm,\" Gardner says, \"and the main stage didn’t have to use any diesel power.\"\n\nBillie Eilish was another early supporter of the initiative. \"She helped us launch the program,\" Gardner says. Eilish’s set at Lollapallooza 2023 drew power from solar batteries, too.\n\nWith such high-profile successes as a backdrop, Gardner believes that REVERB is poised to do even more to foster sustainable concerts and touring. \"Our role now,\" he says, \"isn’t just, ‘Hey, think about this stuff.’ It’s more how do we push farther, faster?\"\n\nAdam Gardner believes that musicians are uniquely positioned to help make a difference where issues of sustainability are concerned. \"When you’re a musician, you’re connecting with fans heart-to-heart. That’s what moves people. And that’s where the good stuff happens.\"\n\nSmall-scale, individual changes can make a difference — especially when they’re coordinated and amplified among other concertgoers. Gardner provides real-world examples. \"Instead of buying a plastic bottle, I brought my reusable and filled it up. Maybe I carpooled to the show.\" Conceding that such steps might seem like drops of water in a giant pool, he emphasizes the power of scale. \"When you actually multiply [those things for] just one summer tour, it adds up,\" he says. \"And it reminds people, ‘You’re not alone in this; you’re part of a community that’s taking action.\"\n\nGardner understands that REVERB’s arguments have to be framed the right way to reach concertgoers. \"Look,\" he admits, \"It’s a concert. We’re not here to be a buzzkill. Our [aim] now is making sure people don’t lose hope.\" He says that REVERB and its partners seek to demonstrate that, with collective action and cultural change, there is reason for optimism.\n\n\"There’s a wonderful feedback loop between hope and action,\" Gardner says with a smile. \"You can’t really have one without the other.\"\n\nSustainable Partnerships\n\nTanner Watt is Director of Partnerships at REVERB; he works directly with touring artists to develop, coordinate and implement initiatives that bring together his organization’s objectives and the specific personal concerns of the artists. \"I get to come up with all the fun, big ideas,\" he says with a wide smile.\n\nWatt acknowledges that like every concertgoer, each touring artist has a certain level of responsibility where sustainability is concerned. \"And everyone can be doing something,\" he says, noting a number of straightforward actions that artists can put in place while on tour. \"They can eliminate single-use waste. They can donate hotel toiletries that [would otherwise] hit the landfill.\"\n\nWatt stresses that artists can lead by example. \"Nobody wants to listen to an artist telling them what to do if they’re not doing it themselves,\" he says. \"But we believe that everybody cares about something.\" He suggests that if an artist has cultivated a following, \"Why not use [that platform] to be that change you want to see in the world?\"\n\nEach artist has his or her own specific areas of concern, but Watt says that there’s a base level of \"greening\" that takes place on every REVERB-affiliated tour. Where things go from there is up to the artist, in coordination with REVERB. Watt mentions Billie Eilish and her tour’s sustainability commitment. \"The Venn diagram of food security, community health, access to healthy food, and the impact on the planet is a big cause for her,\" he says. \"So there’s plant-based catering for her entire crew, across the entire tour.\"\n\nSpeaking toBillboard, Eilish's mother Maggie Baird said championing sustainability starts with artists. \"If artists are interested, it does really start with them telling their teams that they care and that it’s foremost in their thoughts.\" In the same conversation, Eilish called the battle for sustainability \"a never-ending f–king fight.\"\n\nWatt acknowledges that with so many challenges, it’s important for a concerned artist to focus on the issues that move them the most, and where they can make the biggest difference. \"Jack Johnson is a great example,\" he says. While Johnson is a vocal advocate for many environmental issues, on tour he focuses on two (in Watt’s words) \"cause umbrellas\": single-use plastics solutions and sustainable community food systems. Each show on the tour hosts tables representing local nonprofit organizations, presenting concertgoers with real-world, human-scale solutions to those specific challenges.\n\nFour-time GRAMMY winnerBrittany Howard is another passionate REVERB partner. \"Knowing that I wanted to make my tours more sustainable was a start,\" she tells GRAMMY.com, \"but working with REVERB really helped me bring it to life on the road. REVERB has helped us with guidelines and a green rider to keep our stage, greenrooms and buses more sustainable.\"\n\nAfter listing several other specific ways that her tour supports sustainability, Howard notes, \"By supporting these efforts, I am helping ensure future generations have access to clean water, fish, and all that I love about the outdoors.\" A dollar from every ticket sold to a Brittany Howard concert goes toward support of REVERB’s Music Decarbonization project. \"I’m also excited to see industry-wide efforts that are reducing the carbon pollution of live music,\" Howard continues. \"Because it’s not just [about] a single tour, it’s every tour.\"\n\nThere’s a popular aphorism: \"You can’t manage what you can’t measure.\" From its start, REVERB has sought not only to promote change, but to measure its success. \"As long as I’ve been at REVERB, we’ve issuedimpact reports,\" says Tanner Watt. \"We include data points, and give the report to the artists so they understand what we’ve done together.\" He admits that some successes are more tangible than others, but that it’s helpful to focus on the ones that can be quantified. \"We’re very excited that our artists share those with their fans.\"\n\nWatt is clear-eyed at the challenges that remain. \"Even the word ‘sustainable’ can be misleading,\" he concedes, suggesting that the only truly sustainable tour is the one that doesn’t happen. \"But if folks don’t step it up and change the way we do business in every industry — not just ours — we’re going to get to a place where we’re forced to make sacrifices that aren’t painless.\" Getting that message across is REVERB’s aim. \"We can’t stop the world,\" Watt says. \"So we find ways to approach these things positively.\"\n\nWatt says that the fans at concerts featuring Jack Johnson and theDave Matthews Band — both longtime REVERB partners — are already on board with many of the sustainability-focused initiatives which those artists promote. \"But there are lots of artists — and lots of fan bases — out there that aren’t messaged to, or have been mis-messaged to,\" he says. \"I’m really excited to find more ways to expand our reach to them, beyond mainstream pop music. Because these are conversations that are meaningful for everyone, regardless of political affiliation or other beliefs.\"\n\nReimagining The Planet’s Future\n\nSinger, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Adam Met does more than frontAJR, the indie pop trio he founded in 2005 with brothers Jack and Ryan. Met has a PhD in sustainable development and is a climate activist; he's also the founder/Executive Director ofPlanet Reimagined, a nonprofit that promotes sustainability and activism through its work with businesses, other organizations and musicians.\n\n\"I’ve spent years traveling around the world, seeing the direct impact of climate change,\" Met says. He cites two recent and stark examples. \"When we pulled up to a venue in San Francisco, the band had to wear gas masks going from the bus into the venue, because of forest fires,\" he says. AJR’s road crew had to contend with a flash flood in Athens, Greece that washed out their hotel. \"And in Rome, some of our crew members fainted because of the heat.\"\n\nEncouraged by representatives from the United Nations, Met launched Planet Reimagined. Met’s approach focuses on tailored, city-specific actions to empower fans and amplify diverse voices in the climate movement. Through social media and live shows, Met strives to galvanize climate activism among AJR fans. And the methods he has developed can be implemented by other touring artists.\n\nMet points out that one of the most climate-unfriendly parts of the entire concert tour enterprise is fans traveling to and from the concerts. And that’s something over which the artist has little or no control. What they can do, he says, is try to educate and influence. Working closely with Ticketmaster and other stakeholders, Met’s nonprofit initiated a study — conducted from July to December 2023, with results published in April 2024 — to explore the energy that happens at concerts. \"In sociology,\" he explains, \"that energy is called collective effervescence.\" The study’s goal is to find ways to channel that energy toward advocacy and action.\n\nPolling a quarter million concertgoers across musical genres, the study collected data on attitudes about climate change. \"Seventy-three percent of fans who attend concerts believe that climate change is real, and that we need to be doing more about it,\" Met says. \"Seventy-eight percent have already taken some sort of action in their lives.\" He believes that if his organization can activate even a fraction of the estimated 250 million people annually who attend concerts around the globe, \"that’s the ballgame.\"\n\nMet’s goal is to do more than, say, get concertgoers to switch from plastic to paper drinking straws. \"At scale those things make a difference. But people want to see actions where there’s a track record,\" he says; a return on investment.\n\nAJR will be putting a plan into action on the second half of their upcoming arena tour. Part of the initiative is encouraging concertgoers to register to vote, and then actually vote. Beyond that, Met has specific actions in mind. \"At every single stop, we’re putting together materials around specific policies that are being debated at the local level,\" he explains. \"We give people a script right there, so they can call their elected representative and say, ‘I want you to vote [a certain way on this issue].’\"\n\nHe believes the initiative will lead to thousands of people contacting – and hopefully influencing – their representatives. With regard to sustainability issues, Met is convinced that \"the most impact that you can have as an artist is when you give fans ways to pick up the mantle themselves.\"\n\nArtists Who Are Going On Tour In 2024: The Rolling Stones, Drake, Olivia Rodrigo & More\n\nAs expected, much buzz followed the release of Taylor Swift's 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, on April 19. Fans and critics alike have devoured the sprawling double album’s 31 tracks, unpacking her reflections from \"a fleeting and fatalistic moment in time\" in search of Easter eggs, their new favorite lyrics and references to famous faces (both within the pop supernova’s closely guarded orbit and the historical record).\n\nShoutouts abound in The Tortured Poets Department: Charlie Puth gets his much-deserved (and Taylor-approved) flowers on the title track, while 1920s screen siren Clara Bow, the ancient Greek prophetess Cassandra and Peter Pan each get a song titled after them. Post Malone and Florence + the Machine’s Florence Welch each tap in for memorable duets. Relationships old (Joe Alwyn), new (Travis Kelce) and somewhere in between (1975’s Matty Healy) are alluded to without naming names, as is, possibly, the singer’s reputation-era feud with Kim Kardashian.\n\nSwift casts a wide net on The Tortured Poets Department, encompassing popular music, literature, mythology and beyond, but it's far from the first time the 14-time GRAMMY winner has worn her influences on her sleeve. While you digest TTPD, consider these 10 figures who have influenced the poet of the hour — from Stevie Nicks and Patti Smith to Emily Dickinson, William Wordsworth, Arya Stark and more.\n\nStevie Nicks\n\nIf Taylor Swift is the chairman of The Tortured Poets Department, Stevie Nicks may as well be considered its poet laureate emeritus. The mystical Fleetwood Mac frontwoman earns an important mention on side A closer \"Clara Bow,\" in which Swift ties an invisible string from herself to a pre-Rumours Nicks (\"In ‘75, the hair and lips/ Crowd goes wild at her fingertips\"), and all the way back to the 1920s It Girl of the song’s title.\n\nFor her part, Nicks seems to approve of her place in Swift’s cultural lineage, considering she penned the poem found inside physical copies of The Tortured Poets Department. \"He was in love with her/ Or at least she thought so,\" the Priestess of Rock and Roll wrote in part, before signing off, \"For T — and me…\"\n\nSwift’s relationship with Nicks dates back to the 2010 GRAMMYs, when the pair performed a medley of \"Rhiannon\" and \"You Belong With Me\" before the then-country upstart took home her first Album Of The Year win for 2009’s Fearless. More recently, the \"Edge of Seventeen\" singer publicly credited Swift’s Midnights cut \"You’re On Your Own, Kid\" for helping her through the 2022 death of Fleetwood Mac bandmate Christine McVie.\n\nPatti Smith\n\nSwift may see herself as more \"modern idiot\" than modern-day Patti Smith, but that didn’t stop the superstar from name-dropping the icon synonymous with the Hotel Chelsea and punk scene of ‘70s New York on a key track on The Tortured Poets Department. Swift rather self-deprecatingly compares herself to the celebrated Just Kids memoirist (and 2023 Songwriters Hall of Fame nominee) on the double album’s synth-drenched title track, and it’s easy to see how Smith’s lifelong fusion of rock and poetry influenced the younger singer’s dactylic approach to her new album.\n\nSmith seemed to appreciate the shout-out on \"The Tortured Poets Department\" as well. \"This is saying I was moved to be mentioned in the company of the great Welsh poet Dylan Thomas. Thank you Taylor,\" she wrote on Instagram alongside a photo of herself reading Thomas’ 1940 poetry collection Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog.\n\nEmily Dickinson\n\nWhen it comes to iconic poets, Swift has also taken a page or two over her career from Emily Dickinson. While the great 19th century poet hasn’t come up explicitly in Swift’s work, she did reference her poetic forebear (and actual sixth cousin, three times removed!) in her speech while accepting the award for Songwriter-Artist of the Decade at the 2022 Nashville Songwriter Awards.\n\n\"I’ve never talked about this publicly before, because, well, it’s dorky. But I also have, in my mind, secretly, established genre categories for lyrics I write. Three of them, to be exact. They are affectionately titled Quill Lyrics, Fountain Pen Lyrics and Glitter Gel Pen Lyrics,\" Swift told the audience before going on to explain, \"If my lyrics sound like a letter written by Emily Dickinson’s great-grandmother while sewing a lace curtain, that’s me writing in the Quill genre,\" she went on to explain.\n\nEven before this glimpse into Swift’s writing process, Easter eggs had been laid pointing to her familial connection to Dickinson. For example, she announced her ninth album evermore on December 10, 2020, which would have been the late poet’s 190th birthday. Another clue that has Swifties convinced? Dickinson’s use of the word \"forevermore\" in her 1858 poem \"One Sister Have I in Our House,\" which Swift also cleverly breaks apart in Evermore’s Bon Iver-assisted title track (\"And I couldn’t be sure/ I had a feeling so peculiar/ That this pain would be for/ Evermore\").\n\nThe Lake Poets\n\nSwift first put her growing affinity for poetry on display during her folklore era with \"the lakes.\" On the elegiac bonus track, the singer draws a parallel with the Lake Poets of the 19th century, wishing she could escape to \"the lakes where all the poets went to die\" with her beloved muse in tow. In between fantasizing about \"those Windermere peaks\" and pining for \"auroras and sad prose,\" she even manages to land a not-so-subtle jab at nemesis Scooter Braun (\"I’ve come too far to watch some name-dropping sleaze/ Tell me what are my words worth\") that doubles as clever wordplay on the last name of Lake Poet School members William and Dorothy Wordsworth.\n\nSwift revealed more about why she connected to the Lake Poets in her 2020 Disney+ documentary folklore: the long pond studio sessions. \"There was a poet district, these artists that moved there. And they were kind of heckled for it and made fun of for it as being these eccentrics and these kind of odd artists who decided that they just wanted to live there,\" she explained to her trusted producer Jack Antonoff. \"So ‘the lakes,’ it kind of is the overarching theme of the whole album: of trying to escape, having something you wanna protect, trying to protect your own sanity and saying, ‘Look, they did this hundreds of years ago. I’m not the first person who’s felt this way.’\"\n\nPaul McCartney\n\nPaul McCartney and Swift have publicly praised one another’s work for years, leading to the 2020 Rolling Stone cover they posed for together for the special Musicians on Musicians issue. The younger singer even counts Sir Paul’s daughter Stella McCartney as a close friend and collaborator (Stella designed a capsule collection for Swift’s 2019 studio set Lover and earned a shout-out of her own on album cut \"London Boy\").\n\nHowever, Swift took her relationship with the Beatles founder and his family a step further when it was rumored she based Midnights deep cut \"Sweet Nothing\" on McCartney’s decades-long romance with late wife Linda. While the speculation has never been outright confirmed, it appears Swift’s lyrics in the lilting love song (\"On the way home, I wrote a poem/ You say, ‘What a mind’/ This happens all the time\") were partially inspired by a strikingly similar quote McCartney once gave about his relationship with Linda, who passed away in 1998. To add to the mystique, the Midnights singer even reportedly liked a tweet from 2022 espousing the theory.\n\nThe admiration between the duo seems to go both ways as well, with the former Beatle admitting in a 2018 BBC profile that the track \"Who Cares\" from his album Egypt Station was inspired by Swift’s close relationship with her fans.\n\nThe Chicks\n\nFrom her days as a country music ingénue to her ascendance as the reigning mastermind of pop, Swift has credited the Chicks as a seminal influence in her songwriting and career trajectory. (Need examples? Look anywhere from early singles like \"Picture to Burn\" and \"Should’ve Said No\" to Evermore’s Haim-assisted murder ballad \"no body, no crime\" and her own Lover-era collab with the band, \"Soon You’ll Get Better.\")\n\nIn a 2020 Billboard cover story tied to the Chicks’ eighth album Gaslighter, Swift acknowledged just how much impact the trio made on her growing up. \"Early in my life, these three women showed me that female artists can play their own instruments while also putting on a flamboyant spectacle of a live show,\" she said at the time. \"They taught me that creativity, eccentricity, unapologetic boldness and kitsch can all go together authentically. Most importantly, they showed an entire generation of girls that female rage can be a bonding experience between us all the very second we first heard Natalie Maines bellow ‘that Earl had to DIE.’\"\n\n\"Game of Thrones\"\n\nWhen reputation dropped in 2017, Swift was on a self-imposed media blackout, which meant no cover stories or dishy sit-down interviews on late-night TV during the album’s roll-out. Instead, the singer let reputation speak for itself, and fans were largely left to draw their own conclusions about their queen’s wildly anticipated comeback album. Two years later, though, Swift revealed the dark, vengeful, romantic body of work was largely inspired by \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\n\"These songs were half based on what I was going through, but seeing them through a 'Game of Thrones' filter,\" she told Entertainment Weekly in 2019. \"My entire outlook on storytelling has been shaped by [\"GoT\"] — the ability to foreshadow stories, to meticulously craft cryptic story lines. So, I found ways to get more cryptic with information and still be able to share messages with the fans. I aspire to be one one-millionth of the kind of hint dropper the makers of 'Game of Thrones' have been.\"\n\nJoni Mitchell\n\nSwift has long made her admiration of Joni Mitchell known, dating back to her 2012 album Red, which took a cue from the folk pioneer’s landmark 1971 LP Blue for its chromatic title. In an interview around the time of Red’s release, the country-pop titan gushed over Blue’s impact on her, telling Rhapsody, \"[Mitchell] wrote it about her deepest pains and most haunting demons. Songs like ‘River,’ which is just about her regrets and doubts of herself — I think this album is my favorite because it explores somebody’s soul so deeply.\"\n\nBack in 2015, TIME declared the \"Blank Space\" singer a \"disciple of Mitchell in ways both obvious and subtle\" — from her reflective songwriting to the complete ownership over her creative process, and nearly 10 years later, Swift was still showing her appreciation for Mitchell after the latter’s triumphant and emotional appearance on the GRAMMY stage to perform \"Both Sides Now\" on the very same night Taylor took home her historic fourth GRAMMY for Album Of The Year for Midnights.\n\nFall Out Boy & Paramore\n\nWhen releasing the re-recording of her third album Speak Now in 2023, Swift cited two unexpectedly emo acts as inspirations to her early songwriting: Fall Out Boy and Paramore.\n\n\"Since Speak Now was all about my songwriting, I decided to go to the artists who I feel influenced me most powerfully as a lyricist at that time and ask them to sing on the album,\" she wrote in an Instagram post revealing the back cover and complete tracklist for Speak Now (Taylor’s Version), which included Fall Out Boy collaboration \"Electric Touch\" and \"Castles Crumbling\" featuring Paramore frontwoman Hayley Williams.\n\nTim McGraw\n\nFor one of Swift’s original career inspirations, we have to go all the way back to the very first single she ever released. \"Tim McGraw\" was not only as the lead single off the 16-year-old self-titled 2006 debut album, but it also paid reverent homage to one of the greatest living legends in the history of country music.\n\nIn retrospect, it was an incredibly gutsy risk for a then-unknown Swift to come raring out of the gate with a song named after a country superstar. But the gamble clearly paid off in spades, considering that now, when an entire generation of music fans hear \"Tim McGraw,\" they think of Taylor Swift.\n\nTaylor Swift's 'The Tortured Poets Department' Is A Post-Mortem Autopsy In Song: 5 Takeaways From Her New Album"
