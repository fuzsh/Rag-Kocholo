Endothelial disruption is the initial step and macrophage-derived foam cells are the hallmark of atherosclerosis. Promotion of vascular integrity and inhibition of foam cell formation are two important strategies for preventing atherosclerosis. How can we inhibit even the reverse negative role of macrophages in atherosclerosis? The present study was performed to investigate if overexpressing endogenous human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) could facilitate transdifferentiation of macrophages into endothelial-like cells (ELCs) and inhibit foam cell formation. We demonstrated that VEGF-modified macrophages which stably overexpressed human VEGF (hVEGF 165 ) displayedÂ aÂ highÂ capability to alter their phenotype and function into ELCs in vitro Exogenous VEGF could not replace endogenous VEGF to induce the transdifferentiation of macrophages into ELCs in vitro We further showed that VEGF-modified macrophages significantly decreased cytoplasmic lipid accumulation after treatment with oxidized LDL (ox-LDL). Moreover, down-regulation of CD36 expression in these cells was probably one of the mechanisms of reduction in foam cell formation. Our results provided the in vitro proof of VEGF-modified macrophages as atheroprotective therapeutic cells by both promotion of vascular repair and inhibition of foam cell formation.

Luisa, E-mail: arispe@mcdb.ucla.edu\n\nThe ability of macrophages to promote vascular growth has been associated with the secretion and local delivery of classic proangiogenic factors (e.g., VEGF-A and proteases). More recently, a series of studies have also revealed that physical contact of macrophages with growing blood vessels coordinates vascular fusion of emerging sprouts. Interestingly, the interactions between macrophages and vascular endothelial cells (ECs) appear to be bidirectional, such that activated ECs also support the expansion and differentiation of proangiogenic macrophages from myeloid progenitors. Here, we discuss recent findings suggesting that dynamic angiogenic vascular niches might also exist in vivo, e.g. in tumors, where sproutingmoreÂ Â» blood vessels and immature myeloid cells like monocytes engage in heterotypic interactions that are required for angiogenesis. Finally, we provide an account of emerging mechanisms of cell-to-cell communication that rely on secreted microvesicles, such as exosomes, which can offer a vehicle for the rapid exchange of molecules and genetic information between macrophages and ECs engaged in angiogenesis. -- Highlights: â¢ Macrophages promote angiogenesis by secreting proangiogenic factors. â¢ Macrophages modulate angiogenesis via cell-to-cell contacts with endothelial cells. â¢ Endothelial cells promote the differentiation of proangiogenic macrophages. â¢ Macrophages and endothelial cells may cooperate to form angiogenic vascular niches.Â«Â less\n\nPolymeric stent materials dysregulate macrophage and endothelial cell functions: implications for coronary artery stent\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWang, Xintong; Zachman, Angela L.; Chun, Young Wook; Shen, Fang-Wen; Hwang, Yu-Shik; Sung, Hak-Joon\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground Biodegradable polymers have been applied as bulk or coating materials for coronary artery stents. The degradation of polymers, however, could induce endothelial dysfunction and aggravate neointimal formation. Here we use polymeric microparticles to simulate and demonstrate the effects of degraded stent materials on phagocytic activity, cell death and dysfunction of macrophages and endothelial cells. Methods Microparticles made of low molecular weight polyesters were incubated with human macrophages and coronary artery endothelial cells (ECs). Microparticle-induced phagocytosis, cytotoxicity, apoptosis, cytokine release and surface marker expression were determined by immunostaining or ELISA. Elastase expression was analyzed by ELISA and the elastase-mediated polymer degradation was assessed by mass spectrometry. Results We demonstrated poly(D,L-lactic acid) (PLLA) and polycaprolactone (PCL) microparticles induced cytotoxicity in macrophages and ECs, partially through cell apoptosis. The particle treatment alleviated EC phagocytosis, as opposed to macrophages, but enhanced the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM) along with decreased nitric oxide production, indicating ECs were activated and lost their capacity to maintain homeostasis. The activation of both cell types induced release of elastase or elastase-like protease, which further accelerated polymer degradation. Conclusions This study revealed that low molecule weight PLLA and PCL microparticles increased cytotoxicity and dysregulated endothelial cell function, which in turn enhanced elastase release and polymer degradation. These indicate polymer or polymer-coated stents impose a risk of endothelial dysfunction after deployment which can potentially lead to delayed endothelialization, neointimal hyperplasia and late thrombosis.

The molecular mechanism to initiate diabetes-associated retinal angiogenesis remains largely unknown. We propose an inflammatory pathway of diabetic retinopathy in which macrophages in the diabetic eye provide TGFÎ² to retinal endothelial cells (REC) in the retinal microvasculature. In response to TGFÎ², REC synthesize and secrete a pro-apoptotic BIGH3 (TGFÎ²-Induced Gene Human Clone 3) protein, which acts in an autocrine loop to induce REC apoptosis. Rhesus monkey retinal endothelial cells (RhREC) were treated with dMCM (cell media of macrophages treated with high glucose and LDL) and assayed for apoptosis (TUNEL), BIGH3 mRNA (qPCR), and protein (Western blots) expressions. Cells were also treated with Î¤GFÎ²1 and 2 for BIGH3 mRNA and protein expression. Inhibition assays were carried out using antibodies for TGFÎ²1 and for BIGH3 to block apoptosis and mRNA expression. BIGH3 in cultured RhREC cells were identified by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Distribution of BIGH3 and macrophages in the diabetic mouse retina was examined with IHC. RhRECs treated with dMCM or TGFÎ² showed a significant increase in apoptosis and BIGH3 protein expression. Recombinant BIGH3 added to RhREC culture medium led to a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis. Antibodies (Ab) directed against BIGH3 and TGFÎ², as well as TGFÎ² receptor blocker resulted in a significant reduction in apoptosis induced by either dMCM, TGFÎ² or BIGH3. IHC showed that cultured RhREC constitutively expressed BIGH3. Macrophage and BIGH3 protein were co-localized to the inner retina of the diabetic mouse eye. Our results support a novel inflammatory pathway for diabetic retinopathy. This pathway is initiated by TGFÎ² released from macrophages, which promotes synthesis and release of BIGH3 protein by REC and REC apoptosis.\n\nCarcinoembryonic antigen-stimulated THP-1 macrophages activate endothelial cells and increase cell-cell adhesion of colorectal cancer cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nAarons, Cary B; Bajenova, Olga; Andrews, Charles; Heydrick, Stanley; Bushell, Kristen N; Reed, Karen L; Thomas, Peter; Becker, James M; Stucchi, Arthur F\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe liver is the most common site for metastasis by colorectal cancer, and numerous studies have shown a relationship between serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels and metastasis to this site. CEA activates hepatic macrophages or Kupffer cells via binding to the CEA receptor (CEA-R), which results in the production of cytokines and the up-regulation of endothelial adhesion molecules, both of which are implicated in hepatic metastasis. Since tissue macrophages implicated in the metastatic process can often be difficult to isolate, the aim of this study was to develop an in vitro model system to study the complex mechanisms of CEA-induced macrophage activation and metastasis. Undifferentiated, human monocytic THP-1 (U-THP) cells were differentiated (D-THP) to macrophages by exposure to 200 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) for 18 h. Immunohistochemistry showed two CEA-R isoforms present in both U- and D-THP cells. The receptors were localized primarily to the nucleus in U-THP cells, while a significant cell-surface presence was observed following PMA-differentiation. Incubation of D-THP-1 cells with CEA resulted in a significant increase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) release over 24 h compared to untreated D-THP-1 or U-THP controls confirming the functionality of these cell surface receptors. U-THP cells were unresponsive to CEA. Attachment of HT-29 cells to human umbilical vein endothelial cells significantly increased at 1 h after incubation with both recombinant TNF-alpha and conditioned media from CEA stimulated D-THP cells by six and eightfold, respectively. This study establishes an in vitro system utilizing a human macrophage cell line expressing functional CEA-Rs to study activation and signaling mechanisms of CEA that facilitate tumor cell attachment to activated endothelial cells. Utilization of this in vitro system may lead to a more complete understanding of the expression and function of CEA-R and facilitate the design of anti\n\nPeripheral blood \"endothelial progenitor cells\" are derived from monocyte/macrophages and secrete angiogenic growth factors.\n\nPubMed\n\nRehman, Jalees; Li, Jingling; Orschell, Christie M; March, Keith L\n\n2003-03-04\n\nEndothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have been isolated from peripheral blood and can enhance angiogenesis after infusion into host animals. It is not known whether the proangiogenic effects are a result of such events as endothelial differentiation and subsequent proliferation of EPCs or secondary to secretion of angiogenic growth factors. Human EPCs were isolated as previously described, and their phenotypes were confirmed by uptake of acetylated LDL and binding of ulex-lectin. EPC proliferation and surface marker expression were analyzed by flow cytometry, and conditioned medium was assayed for growth factors. The majority of EPCs expressed monocyte/macrophage markers such as CD14 (95.7+/-0.3%), Mac-1 (57.6+/-13.5%), and CD11c (90.8+/-4.9%). A much lower percentage of cells expressed the specific endothelial marker VE-cadherin (5.2+/-0.7%) or stem/progenitor-cell markers AC133 (0.16+/-0.05%) and c-kit (1.3+/-0.7%). Compared with circulating monocytes, cultured EPCs showed upregulation of monocyte activation and macrophage differentiation markers. EPCs did not demonstrate any significant proliferation but did secrete the angiogenic growth factors vascular endothelial growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Our findings suggest that acetylated LDL(+)ulex-lectin(+) cells, commonly referred to as EPCs, do not proliferate but release potent proangiogenic growth factors. The majority of acetylated LDL(+)ulex-lectin(+) cells are derived from monocyte/macrophages. The findings of low proliferation and endothelial differentiation suggest that their angiogenic effects are most likely mediated by growth factor secretion. These findings may allow for development of novel angiogenic therapies relying on secreted growth factors or on recruitment of endogenous monocytes/macrophages to sites of ischemia.\n\nErythropoietin withdrawal alters interactions between young red blood cells, splenic endothelial cells, and macrophages: an in vitro model of neocytolysis\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTrial, J.; Rice, L.; Alfrey, C. P.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nBACKGROUND: We have described the rapid destruction of young red blood cells (neocytolysis) in astronauts adapting to microgravity, in polycythemic high altitude dwellers who descend to sea level, and in patients with kidney disorders. This destruction results from a decrease in erythropoietin (EPO) production. We hypothesized that such EPO withdrawal could trigger physiological changes in cells other than red cell precursors and possibly lead to the uptake and destruction of young red cells by altering endothelial cell-macrophage interactions, most likely occurring in the spleen. METHODS: We identified EPO receptors on human splenic endothelial cells (HSEC) and investigated the responses of these cells to EPO withdrawal. RESULTS: A monolayer of HSEC, unlike human endothelial cells from aorta, glomerulus, or umbilical vein, demonstrated an increase in permeability upon EPO withdrawal that was accompanied by unique morphological changes. When HSEC were cultured with monocyte-derived macrophages (but not when either cell type was cultured alone), EPO withdrawal induced an increased ingestion of young red cells by macrophages when compared with the constant presence or absence of EPO. CONCLUSIONS: HSEC may represent a unique cell type that is able to respond to EPO withdrawal by increasing permeability and interacting with phagocytic macrophages, which leads to neocytolysis.\n\nHeparanase-driven inflammation from the AGEs-stimulated macrophages changes the functions of glomerular endothelial cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Guang; Qin, Qiaojing; Yang, Min; Qiao, Zhongdong; Gu, Yong; Niu, Jianying\n\n2017-02-01\n\nAmounts of macrophages were infiltrated in glomeruli in diabetic nephropathy. Heparanase has been thought to be closely related to proteinuria. Our aims were to determine the effect of heparanase on the inflammation in AGEs-stimulated macrophages and its role on the functions of glomerular endothelial cells (GEnCs). The expression of inflammation cytokines in macrophages were assayed by q-RT PCR, western, and ELISA. Then western was used to measure the expression of RAGE and key proteins in NF-ÎºB pathway in macrophages. The expression of the adherence molecules and tight junction proteins in GEnCs were assessed by western. The adherence of mononuclear cells to GEnCs were observed by HE staining and transendothelial FITC-BSA were tested for the permeability of GEnCs. HPA siRNA and heparanase inhibitor sulodexide could attenuate the increasing inflammatory factors (TNF-Î± and IL-1Î²) in AGEs-stimulated macrophages. NF-ÎºB inhibitor PDTC could also decrease the augmented inflammation cytokines through inhibiting the activation of the NF-ÎºB pathway induced by AGEs. The phosphorylation of NF-ÎºB signaling pathway could be also attenuated by HPA siRNA and sulodexide, the same to the receptor of AGEs RAGE. When the macrophage-conditioned culture medium were added to the glomerular endothelial cells, we found HPA siRNA and sulodexide groups could decrease the increasing adherence and permeability of GEnCs induced by AGEs. Heparanase increases the inflammation in AGEs-stimulated macrophages through activating the RAGE-NF-ÎºB pathway. Heparanase driven inflammation from AGEs-stimulated macrophages increases the adherence of GEnCs and augments the permeability of GEnCs. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A recent model of Marburg HF pathogenesis proposes that virus directly causes endothelial cell damage and macrophage release of TNF-alpha which increases the permeability of endothelial monolayers [Feldmann et al. , 1996]. We show that Lassa virus replicates in human monocytes/macrophages and endothelial cells without damaging them. Human endothelial cells (HUVEC) are highly susceptible to infection by both Lassa and Mopeia (a non-pathogenic Lassa-related arenavirus). Whereas monocytes must differentiate into macrophages before supporting even low level production of these viruses, the virus yields in the culture medium of infected HUVEC cells reach more than 7 log10 PFU/ml without cellular damage. In contrast to filovirus, Lassa virus replication in monocytes/macrophages fails to stimulate TNF-alpha gene expression and even down-regulates LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha mRNA synthesis. The expression of IL-8, a prototypic proinflammatory CXC chemokine, was also suppressed in Lassa virus infected monocytes/macrophages and HUVEC on both the protein and mRNA levels. This contrasts with Mopeia virus infection of HUVEC in which neither IL-8 mRNA nor protein are reduced. The cumulative down-regulation of TNF-alpha and IL-8 expression could explain the absence of inflammatory and effective immune responses in severe cases of Lassa HF.

During the process of tissue injury, these three cellular subtypes must coordinate their activity to efficiently contribute to tissue regeneration. In tumor, this mechanism is hijacked by cancer cells, which rewire the interaction of stromal cells to benefit tumor development. The present review aims at summarizing most relevant information concerning both pro-tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic actions implicating the three stromal cell subtypes as well as their mutual interactions. Although stromal cells are generally regarded as tumor-supportive and at will manipulated by cancer cells, several novel studies point at many defaults in cancer cell-mediated stromal reprograming. Indeed, parts of initial tissue-protective and homeostatic functions of the stromal cells remain in place even after tumor development. Both tumor-supportive and tumor-suppressive functions have been well described for macrophages, whereas similar results are emerging for fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Recent success of immunotherapies have finally brought the long awaited proof that stroma is key for efficient tumor targeting. However, a better understanding of paracrine stromal interactions is needed in order to encourage drug development not only aiming at disruption of tumor-supportive communication but also re-enforcing, existing, tumor-suppressive mechanisms.\n\nParticle-size-dependent cytokine responses and cell damage induced by silica particles and macrophages-derived mediators in endothelial cell.\n\nPubMed\n\nRong, Yi; Zhou, Ting; Cheng, Wenjuan; Guo, Jiali; Cui, Xiuqing; Liu, Yuewei; Chen, Weihong\n\n2013-11-01\n\nEpidemiological evidence reports silica dust exposure has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, but the mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, endothelial cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of two sizes silica particles and the soluble mediators released by macrophages treated with the same particles for 24 h. Expression and release of cytokines (IL-1Î², TNF-Î± and IL-6) were measured by using ELISA. Cytotoxicity was measured by MTT assay and LDH release. We show that both ways induced increases in cell toxicity and cytokines in a dose-dependent manner. For smaller particles, the soluble mediators are more capable of increasing cytokines compared with the effect of particles directly. For larger particles, evaluating results of these two ways are similar. Either way, smaller particles make the increasing action of cell toxicity and cytokines more remarkable. Our results indicate both silica particle and macrophage-derived mediators can induce endothelial cell injury and inflammation and demonstrate the potential importance of the particle sizes in this effect.

ECV304 cells were cultured in vitro, and to which were respectively added U937 cells (1 x 10(5)), 25 microg/mL ConA, and U937 cell (1 x 10(5)) + ConA (25 microg/mL) after cell fusion rate reaching 60%, and then co-cultured for 48 hours. ECV 304 cells in conventional culture were used as controls. 3H-TdR incorporation test was employed to determine the DNA synthesis of vascular endothelial cells. Flow cytometry was used to determine the changes in the cell cycle, and RT-PCR was adopted to determine the expression of homeobox (HOXB2) mRNA. After conA stimulation to ECV 304 co-cultured with U937 cells, the percentage of cells in S phase (48.860 +/- 2.290), the DNA synthesis [(5694 +/- 917) min(-1)], and the expression of HOXB2 mRNA (0.947 +/- 0.003) were obviously higher than those in control group [41.590 +/- 2.590 vs (2498 +/- 1109) min(-1) vs 0.646 +/- 0.004, P > 0.01]. There was no obvious difference in apoptosis among above stimulation methods (P >0.05). U937 cells activated by ConA can promote the proliferation of ECV304 cells and further regulate angiogenesis. HOXB2 gene is closely related to the endothelial proliferation.\n\nRON kinase inhibition reduces renal endothelial injury in sickle cell disease mice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKhaibullina, Alfia; Adjei, Elena A.; Afangbedji, Nowah; Ivanov, Andrey; Kumari, Namita; Almeida, Luis E.F.; Quezado, Zenaide M.N.; Nekhai, Sergei; Jerebtsova, Marina\n\n2018-01-01\n\nSickle cell disease patients are at increased risk of developing a chronic kidney disease. Endothelial dysfunction and inflammation associated with hemolysis lead to vasculopathy and contribute to the development of renal disease. Here we used a Townes sickle cell disease mouse model to examine renal endothelial injury. Renal disease in Townes mice was associated with glomerular hypertrophy, capillary dilation and congestion, and significant endothelial injury. We also detected substantial renal macrophage infiltration, and accumulation of macrophage stimulating protein 1 in glomerular capillary. Treatment of human cultured macrophages with hemin or red blood cell lysates significantly increased expression of macrophage membrane-associated protease that might cleave and activate circulating macrophage stimulating protein 1 precursor. Macrophage stimulating protein 1 binds to and activates RON kinase, a cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase. In cultured human renal glomerular endothelial cells, macrophage stimulating protein 1 induced RON downstream signaling, resulting in increased phosphorylation of ERK and AKT kinases, expression of Von Willebrand factor, increased cell motility, and re-organization of F-actin. Specificity of macrophage stimulating protein 1 function was confirmed by treatment with RON kinase inhibitor BMS-777607 that significantly reduced downstream signaling. Moreover, treatment of sickle cell mice with BMS-777607 significantly reduced glomerular hypertrophy, capillary dilation and congestion, and endothelial injury. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that RON kinase is involved in the induction of renal endothelial injury in sickle cell mice. Inhibition of RON kinase activation may provide a novel approach for prevention of the development of renal disease in sickle cell disease.

Recently, many kinds of MNPs are modified as new absorbents, which have attracted considerable attention and are promising to be applied in waste water. In our previous study, we synthesized two novel MNPs surface-coated with glycine or lysine, which could efficiently remove many anionic and cationic dyes under severe conditions. It should be considered that MNP residues in water may exert some side effects on human health. In the present study, we evaluated the potential nanotoxicity of MNPs in human endothelial cells, macrophages, and rat bone marrow stromal cells. The results showed that the two kinds of nanoparticles were consistently absorbed into the cell cytoplasm. The concentration of MNPs@Gly that could distinctly decrease survival was 15 Î¼g/ml in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) or bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and 10 Î¼g/ml in macrophages. While the concentration of MNPs@Lys that obviously reduced viability was 15 Î¼g/ml in HUVECs or macrophages and 50 Î¼g/ml in BMSCs. Furthermore, cell nucleus staining and cell integrity assay indicated that the nanoparticles induced cell apoptosis, but not necrosis even at a high concentration. Altogether, these data suggest that the amino acid-coated magnetic nanoparticles exert relatively high cytotoxicity. By contrast, lysine-coated magnetic nanoparticles are more secure than glycine-coated magnetic nanoparticles.\n\nThe role of insulin growth factor-1 on the vascular regenerative effect of MAA coated disks and macrophage-endothelial cell crosstalk.\n\nPubMed\n\nTalior-Volodarsky, Ilana; Mahou, Redouan; Zhang, David; Sefton, Michael\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe IGF-1 signaling pathway and IGF-1-dependent macrophage/endothelial cell crosstalk was found to be critical features of the vascular regenerative effect displayed by implanted methacrylic acid -co-isodecyl acrylate (MAA-co-IDA; 40% MAA) coated disks in CD1 mice. Inhibition of IGF-1 signaling using AG1024 an IGF1-R tyrosine kinase inhibitor abrogated vessel formation 14 days after disk implantation in a subcutaneous pocket. Explanted tissue had increased arginase 1 expression and reduced iNOS expression consistent with the greater shift from \"M1\" (\"pro-inflammatory\") macrophages to \"M2\" (\"pro-angiogenic\") macrophages for MAA coated disks relative to control MM (methyl methacrylate-co-IDA) disks; the latter did not generate a vascular response and the polarization shift was muted with AG1024. InÂ vitro, medium conditioned by macrophages (both human dTHP1 cells and mouse bone marrow derived macrophages) had elevated IGF-1 mRNA and protein levels, while the cells had reduced IGF1-R but elevated IGFBP-3 mRNA levels. These cells also had reduced iNOS and elevated Arg1 expression, consistent with the inÂ vivo polarization results, including the inhibitory effects of AG1024. On the other hand, HUVEC exposed to dTHP1 conditioned medium migrated and proliferated faster suggesting that the primary target of the macrophage released IGF-1 was endothelial cells. Although further investigation is warranted, IGF-1 appears to be a key feature underpinning the observed vascularization. Why MAA based materials have this effect remains to be defined, however.

Exosomes, nano-sized extracellular vesicles, are believed to play important roles in intercellular communications. This study demonstrates that exosomes released from human macrophages negatively regulate endothelial cell migration through control of integrin trafficking. Macrophage-derived exosomes promote internalization of integrin Î²1 in primary HUVECs. The internalized integrin Î²1 persistently accumulates in the perinuclear region and is not recycled back to the plasma membrane. Experimental results indicate that macrophage-derived exosomes stimulate trafficking of internalized integrin Î²1 to lysosomal compartments with a corresponding decrease in the integrin destined for recycling endosomes, resulting in proteolytic degradation of the integrin. Moreover, ubiquitination of HUVEC integrin Î²1 is enhanced by the exosomes, and exosome-mediated integrin degradation is blocked by bafilomycin A, a lysosomal degradation inhibitor. Macrophage-derived exosomes were also shown to effectively suppress collagen-induced activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway and HUVEC migration, which are both dependent on integrin Î²1. These observations provide new insight into the functional significance of exosomes in the regulation of integrin trafficking. Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We have identified that sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase 2 (SERCA 2) cysteine 674 (C674) S-glutathiolation is essential for ischemic angiogenesis, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated endothelial cell (EC) migration and network formation. A heterozygote SERCA 2 C674S knockin (SKI) mouse shows impaired ischemic blood flow recovery after femoral artery ligation, and its ECs show depleted endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) stores and impaired angiogenic behavior. Here we studied the role of SERCA 2 C674 in the interaction between ECs and macrophages in the context of ischemia and discovered the involvement of the ER stress response protein, ER oxidoreductin-1Î± (ERO1). In wild type (WT) mice, expression of ERO1 was increased in the ischemic hind limb in vivo, as well as in ECs and macrophages exposed to hypoxia in vitro. The increase in ERO1 to ischemia/hypoxia was less in SKI mice. In WT ECs, both vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) expression and bone marrow-derived macrophage adhesion to ECs were increased by hypoxia, and both were attenuated in SKI ECs. In WT ECs, ERO1 siRNA blocked hypoxia-induced VCAM1 expression and macrophage adhesion. In WT macrophages, hypoxia also stimulated both ERO1 and VEGF expression, and both were less in SKI macrophages. Compared with conditioned media of hypoxic SKI macrophages, conditioned media from WT macrophages had a greater effect on EC angiogenic behavior, and were blocked by VEGF neutralizing antibody. Taken together, under hypoxic conditions, SERCA 2 C674 and ERO1 enable increased VCAM1 expression and macrophage adhesion to ECs, as well as macrophage VEGF production that, in turn, promote angiogenesis. This study highlights the hitherto unrecognized interaction of two ER proteins, SERCA 2 C674 and ERO1, which mediate the EC and macrophage angiogenic response to ischemia/hypoxia.

In this study, a novel model has been proposed on controlling 3D cell migration in porous collagen-chitosan scaffolds with various pore structures under the stimulation of inflammatory cells to mimic the angiogenesis process. Endothelial cells (ECs) cultured atop the scaffolds in the Transwell molds which were placed into a well of a 24-well culture plate were promoted to migrate into the scaffolds by chemoattractants such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±) secreted by the pro-inflammatory macrophages incubated in the well culture plate. The phenotype of macrophages was mediated by 50âng/ml interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³) and different concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 150-300âng/ml). The cell migration depth had a positive correlation with LPS concentration, and thereby the TNF-Î± concentration. The ECs migrated easier to a deeper zone of the scaffolds prepared atâ-â10ÂºC (187âÎ¼m in pore diameter) than that atâ-â20ÂºC (108âÎ¼m in pore diameter) as well.

In this study, a novel model has been proposed on controlling 3D cell migration in porous collagen-chitosan scaffolds with various pore structures under the stimulation of inflammatory cells to mimic the angiogenesis process.

We hypothesized that hydrolysis products affect macrophage cell signalling pathways associated with atherosclerosis. To test our hypothesis, we incubated differentiated THP-1 macrophages with products from total lipoprotein hydrolysis by recombinant LPL or EL. Using antibody arrays, we found that the phosphorylation of six receptor tyrosine kinases and three signalling nodes--most associated with atherosclerotic processes--was increased by LPL derived hydrolysis products. EL derived hydrolysis products only increased the phosphorylation of tropomyosin-related kinase A, which is also implicated in playing a role in atherosclerosis. Using electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry, we identified the species of triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines that were hydrolyzed by LPL and EL, and we identified the fatty acids liberated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. To determine if the total liberated fatty acids influenced signalling pathways, we incubated differentiated THP-1 macrophages with a mixture of the fatty acids that matched the concentrations of liberated fatty acids from total lipoproteins by LPL, and we subjected cell lysates to antibody array analyses. The analyses showed that only the phosphorylation of Akt was significantly increased in response to fatty acid treatment. Overall, our study shows that macrophages display potentially pro-atherogenic signalling responses following acute treatments with LPL and EL lipoprotein hydrolysis products.\n\nIron oxide nanoparticles surface coating and cell uptake affect biocompatibility and inflammatory responses of endothelial cells and macrophages\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOrlando, Antonina; Colombo, Miriam; Prosperi, Davide; Gregori, Maria; Panariti, Alice; Rivolta, Ilaria; Masserini, Massimo; Cazzaniga, Emanuela\n\n2015-09-01\n\nEngineered iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP) offer the possibility of a wide range of medical uses, from clinical imaging to magnetically based hyperthermia for tumor treatment. These applications require their systemic administration in vivo. An important property of nanoparticles is their stability in biological media. For this purpose, a multicomponent nanoconstruct combining high colloidal stability and improved physical properties was synthesized and characterized. IONP were coated with an amphiphilic polymer (PMA), which confers colloidal stability, and were pegylated in order to obtain the nanoconstruct PEG-IONP-PMA. The aim of this study was to utilize cultured human endothelial cells (HUVEC) and murine macrophages, taken as model of cells exposed to NP after systemic administration, to assess the biocompatibility of PEG-IONP-PMA (23.1 Â± 1.4 nm) or IONP-PMA (15.6 Â± 3.4 nm). PEG-IONP-PMA, tested at different concentrations as high as 20 Î¼g mL-1, exhibited no cytotoxicity or inflammatory responses. By contrast, IONP-PMA showed a concentration-dependent increase of cytotoxicity and of TNF-Î± production by macrophages and NO production by HUVECs. Cell uptake analysis suggested that after PEGylation, IONP were less internalized either by macrophages or by HUVEC. These results suggest that the choice of the polymer and the chemistry of surface functionalization are a crucial feature to confer to IONP biocompatibility.\n\nThe endoplasmic reticulum stress inducer thapsigargin enhances the toxicity of ZnO nanoparticles to macrophages and macrophage-endothelial co-culture.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Gui; Shen, Yuexin; Li, Xiyue; Jiang, Qin; Cheng, Shanshan; Gu, Yuxiu; Liu, Liangliang; Cao, Yi\n\n2017-03-01\n\nIt was recently shown that exposure to ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) could induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress both in vivo and in vitro, but the role of ER stress in ZnO NP induced toxicity remains unclear. Because macrophages are sensitive to ER stress, we hypothesized that stressing macrophages with ER stress inducer could enhance the toxicity of ZnO NPs. In this study, the effects of ER stress inducer thapsigargin (TG) on the toxicity of ZnO NPs to THP-1 macrophages were investigated. The results showed that TG enhanced ZnO NP induced cytotoxicity as revealed by water soluble tetrazolium-1 (WST-1) and neutral red uptake assays, but not lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. ZnO NPs dose-dependently enhanced the accumulation of intracellular Zn ions without the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the presence of TG did not significantly affect these effects. In the co-culture, exposure of THP-1 macrophages in the upper chamber to ZnO NPs and TG significantly reduced the viability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in the lower chamber, but the release of tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNFÎ±) was not induced. In summary, our data showed that stressing THP-1 macrophages with TG enhanced the cytotoxicity of ZnO NPs to macrophages and macrophage-endothelial co-cultures. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Exposure of the endothelium to inflammatory mediators, such as thrombin and cytokines, during sepsis leads to hyperpermeability. We recently observed that autophagy, a cellular process for protein turnover, is involved in macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)-induced endothelial hyperpermeability. Even though it is known that thrombin induces endothelial cells to secrete MIF and to increase vascular permeability, the possible role of autophagy in this process is unknown. In this study, we proposed and tested the hypothesis that MIF-induced autophagy plays an important role in thrombin-induced endothelial hyperpermeability. We evaluated the effects of thrombin on endothelial permeability, autophagy induction, and MIF secretion in vitro using the human microvascular endothelial cell line-1 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Several mechanisms/read outs of endothelial permeability and autophagy formation were examined. We observed that blocking autophagy attenuated thrombin-induced endothelial hyperpermeability. Furthermore, thrombin-induced MIF secretion was involved in this process because MIF inhibition reduced thrombin-induced autophagy and hyperpermeability. Finally, we showed that blocking MIF or autophagy effectively alleviated vascular leakage and mortality in endotoxemic mice. Thus, MIF-induced autophagy may represent a common mechanism causing vascular leakage in sepsis.\n\n[Effects of macrophages on the biological behaviors and VEGF receptor mRNA, Hoxb2 mRNA, and integrin alphavbeta3 expressions of vascular endothelial cells].\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Liang; Liu, Xu-Sheng; Zhang, Xiao-Qi; Ming, Jia; Xu, Hui; Cheng, Tian-Min\n\n2005-02-01\n\nTo explore the mechanism by which macrophages regulate angiogenesis by co-culturing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECV-304) with human macrophage cells (U937) stimulated by concanavalin A (ConA). Monolayer ECV-304 cells growing to 60% confluence were co-cultured with 1 x 10(5)/ml U937 cells in the presence or absence of ConA (ConA+U937+ECV-304 and U937+ECV-304 groups, respectively), with non-treated and ConA-treated ECV-304 cells serving as the control groups (ECV-304 and ConA+ECV-304 groups, respectively). Forty-eight h later, U937 cells were removed from the cell co-culture for examining changes in DNA synthesis of ECV-304 cells with (3)H-TdR incorporation assay and for cell cycle analysis with flow cytometry. RT-PCR was employed to assess the influence of macrophages stimulated by ConA on the expression of the target genes. With immunofluorescent method, the changes in the expression of integrin receptor alphavbeta3 of ECV-304 were determined. A significant increase in S-phase ECV-304 cells with enhanced DNA synthesis was observed after co-culture of the cells with ConA-stimulated U937 cells (P<0.01), which also resulted in significant up-regulation of the expressions of KDR mRNA (0.879+/-0.003), Hoxb2 mRNA (0.947+/-0.003) and integrin receptor alphavbeta3 (10.26+/-1.73). Macrophages can accelerate the proliferation, migration and adhesion of the vascular endothelial cells to the basilar membrane matrix by affecting their cell cycle, DNA synthesis, expression of KDR mRNA, Hoxb2 mRNA and integrin alphavbeta3, so as to modulate the angiogenetic process of the latter cells.\n\nMCSF expression is induced in healing myocardial infarcts and may regulate monocyte and endothelial cell phenotype.\n\nPubMed\n\nFrangogiannis, Nikolaos G; Mendoza, Leonardo H; Ren, Guofeng; Akrivakis, Spyridon; Jackson, Peggy L; Michael, Lloyd H; Smith, C Wayne; Entman, Mark L\n\n2003-08-01\n\nMyocardial infarction is associated with the rapid induction of mononuclear cell chemoattractants that promote monocyte infiltration into the injured area. Monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and macrophage proliferation allow a long survival of monocytic cells, critical for effective healing of the infarct. In a canine infarction-reperfusion model, newly recruited myeloid leukocytes were markedly augmented during early reperfusion (5-72 h). By 7 days, the number of newly recruited myeloid cells was reduced, and the majority of the inflammatory cells remaining in the infarct were mature macrophages. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) is known to facilitate monocyte survival, monocyte-to-macrophage conversion, and macrophage proliferation. We demonstrated marked induction of MCSF mRNA in ischemic segments persisting for at least 5 days after reperfusion. MCSF expression was predominantly localized to mature macrophages infiltrating the infarcted myocardium; the expression of the MCSF receptor, c-Fms, a protein with tyrosine kinase activity, was found in these macrophages but was also observed in a subset of microvessels within the infarct. Many infarct macrophages expressed proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a marker of proliferative activity. In vitro MCSF induced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 synthesis in canine venous endothelial cells. MCSF-induced endothelial monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 upregulation was inhibited by herbimycin A, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and by LY-294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase inhibitor. We suggest that upregulation of MCSF in the infarcted myocardium may have an active role in healing not only through its effects on cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage, but also by regulating endothelial cell chemokine expression.\n\nIL-11 facilitates a novel connection between RA joint fibroblasts and endothelial cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nElshabrawy, Hatem A; Volin, Michael V; Essani, Abdul B; Chen, Zhenlong; McInnes, Iain B; Van Raemdonck, Katrien; Palasiewicz, Karol; Arami, Shiva; Gonzalez, Mark; Ashour, Hossam M; Kim, Seung-Jae; Zhou, Guofei; Fox, David A; Shahrara, Shiva\n\n2018-05-01\n\nIL-11 has been detected in inflamed joints; however, its role in the pathogenesis of arthritis is not yet clear. Studies were conducted to characterize the expression and functional significance of IL-11 and IL-11RÎ± in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). IL-11 levels were elevated in RA synovial fluid (SF) compared to osteoarthritis (OA) SF and plasma from RA, OA and normal individuals (NLs). Morphologic studies established that IL-11 was detected in lining fibroblasts and macrophages in addition to sublining endothelial cells and macrophages at higher levels in RA compared to NL synovial tissues. Since IL-11RÎ± was exclusively expressed in RA fibroblasts and endothelial cells, macrophages were not involved in IL-11 effector function. Ligation of IL-11 to IL-11RÎ± strongly provoked fibroblast infiltration into RA joint, while cell proliferation was unaffected by this process. Secretion of IL-8 and VEGF from IL-11 activated RA fibroblasts was responsible for the indirect effect of IL-11 on endothelial cell transmigration and tube formation. Moreover, IL-11 blockade impaired RA SF capacity to elicit endothelial cell transmigration and tube formation. We conclude that IL-11 binding to endothelial IL-11RÎ± can directly induce RA angiogenesis. In addition, secretion of proangiogenic factors from migrating fibroblasts potentiated by IL-11 can indirectly contribute to RA neovascularization.\n\nBlood-Borne Macrophage-Neural Cell Interactions Hitchhike Endosome Networks for Cell-Based Nanozyme Brain Delivery\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHaney, Matthew J.; Suresh, Poornima; Zhao, Yuling; Kanmogne, Georgette D.; Kadiu, Irena; Sokolsky-Papkov, Marina; Klyachko, Natalia L.; Mosley, R. Lee; Kabanov, Alexander V.; Gendelman, Howard E.; Batrakova, Elena V.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Macrophage carried nanoformulated catalase (ânanozymeâ) attenuates neuroinflammation and protects nigrostriatal neurons from 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine intoxication. This is facilitated by effective enzyme transfer from blood borne macrophages to adjacent endothelial cells and neurons leading to the decomposition of reactive oxygen species. Methods We now examine the intra- and intercellular trafficking mechanisms of nanozymes. Results In macrophages, nanozymes are internalized mainly by clathrin mediated endocytosis then traffic to recycling endosomes. The enzyme is subsequently released in exosomes facilitated by bridging conduits. Nanozyme transfer from macrophages to adjacent cells by endocytosis-independent mechanisms diffusing broadly throughout the recipient cells. In contrast, macrophage-free nanozymes are localized in lysosomes following endocytic entry. Conclusion Facilitated transfer of nanozyme from cell to cell can improve neuroprotection against oxidative stress commonly seen during neurodegenerative disease processes.

The number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells and microparticles provides invaluable outcome prediction for atherosclerosis disease. However, evidence for the therapeutic potential of endothelial progenitor cells and microparticles in atherosclerosis development is limited. Our study was designed to investigate the possible protective role of a cell therapy-based approach, using endothelial progenitor cells and the dual behaviour of circulating platelet microparticles, on atherosclerosis development in hypertensive-hypercholesterolemic hamster model. Consequently, control hamsters received four intravenous inoculations of: (1) 1Ã10(5) endothelial progenitor cells of healthy origins in one dose per month, during four months of diet-induced atherosclerosis, and after hypertensive-hypercholesterolemic diet for further four months; (2) in a second set of experiments, 1Ã10(5) endothelial progenitor cells of healthy origins or/and 1Ã10(5) platelet microparticles of atherosclerotic origins were inoculated every other month during hypertensive-hypercholesterolemic diet. Endothelial progenitor cell treatment had the following effects: (1) re-established plasmatic parameters: cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, blood pressure, heart rate, cytokine and chemokine profiles, platelet microparticle pro-thrombotic activity and endothelial progenitor cell paracrine activity reflected by cytokine/chemokine detection; (2) reduced lipid, macrophage and microparticle accumulation in liver; (3) reduced atherosclerosis development, revealed by decreased lipid, macrophage and microparticle content of arterial wall; (4) induced the recruitment and incorporation of endothelial progenitor cells into liver and arterial wall; (5) improved arterial dysfunction by increasing contraction and\n\nC-type natriuretic peptide is synthesized and secreted from leukemia cell lines, peripheral blood cells, and peritoneal macrophages.\n\nPubMed\n\nKubo, A; Isumi, Y; Ishizaka, Y; Tomoda, Y; Kangawa, K; Dohi, K; Matsuo, H; Minamino, N\n\n2001-05-01\n\nC-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) is the third member of the natriuretic peptide family. Cultured endothelial cells secrete CNP, and its secretion rate from the endothelial cells is augmented by lipopolysaccharide, interleukin-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which participate in the pathophysiology of inflammation. In this study, we investigated the regulation of CNP secretion from monocytes and macrophages to estimate its contribution to the progression of inflammation. CNP secretion rates from two human leukemia cell lines (THP-1 and HL-60), human peripheral blood lymphocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, and mouse peritoneal macrophages were measured under conditions with or without stimulation. Immunoreactive CNP levels in the culture media of these cells were measured by a specific radioimmunoassay. The secretion rates of CNP from THP-1 and HL-60 cells were augmented according to the degree of their differentiation into macrophage-like cells under the stimulation with phorbol ester. Peripheral blood monocytes also increased the CNP secretion rate after their differentiation into macrophages. Retinoic acid elicited synergistic effects on the CNP secretion rate from HL-60 cells when administered with lipopolysaccharide, interferon-gamma, interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, or phorbol ester. In contrast, the phorbol ester-stimulated CNP secretion rate from THP-1 cells was suppressed with dexamethasone, which inhibits monocyte differentiation into macrophage. The secretion rate of CNP from monocytes was shown to be regulated based on the degree of their differentiation. This study provides evidence that the monocyte/macrophage system is one of the sources of CNP, especially under inflammatory conditions.\n\nEffects of Pleiotrophin on endothelial and inflammatory cells: Pro-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties and potential role for vascular bio-prosthesis endothelialization.\n\nPubMed\n\nPalmieri, Daniela; Mura, Marzia; Mambrini, Simone; Palombo, Domenico\n\n2015-09-01\n\nOne of the limitations emerged with both synthetic and degradable vascular grafts is the lack of endothelialization after implantation that is known to be the main reason leading to unfavourable outcomes. It emerges the need to find new strategies to promote a rapid endothelialization of the scaffold. Pleiotrophin is a growth/differentiation cytokine for various cell type. We here evaluated the effect of Pleiotrophin on endothelial cells (EC), monocytes and macrophages that have been shown as key cells promoting neovascularization. EA.hy926 endothelial cells, THP-1 monocytes and PMA-differentiated macrophages were treated with Pleiotrophin (10 and 100ng/ml). VEGF, Flk-1, Nrp-1, COX-2, ICAM-1 and TGFÎ² expression were detected by Western Blot, IL-10, MCP-1 and TNFÎ± levels by ELISA. Chemotaxis was performed in Boyden chambers. Wound healing was performed by scratch wound assay. Pleiotrophin induces in EC the expression of VEGF and its receptors Flk-1 and Nrp-1 and improves the migratory capacity. In THP-1 monocytes, Pleiotrophin induces the expression of VEGF and its receptor Nrp-1 and decreases the levels of COX-2 and TNFÎ±. In PMA-differentiated macrophages COX-2 expression was significantly reduced by Pleiotrophin, while IL-10 and TGFÎ² were increased. Pleiotrophin acts as an angiogenesis 'driver' by promoting the creation of a pro-angiogenic environment, a migratory behaviour in EC and a pro-regenerative alternative phenotype in macrophages. Our results suggest that Pleiotrophin might be considered for vascular prosthesis engineering. Copyright Â© 2015 Medical University of Bialystok. Published by Elsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.

Here we show that in addition to activating the vascular endothelium, hemoglobin and heme excess alters the macrophage phenotype in sickle cell disease. We demonstrate that exposure of cultured macrophages to hemolytic aged red blood cells, heme, or iron causes their functional phenotypic change toward a proinflammatory state. In addition, hemolysis and macrophage heme/iron accumulation in a mouse model of sickle disease trigger similar proinflammatory phenotypic alterations in hepatic macrophages. On the mechanistic level, this critically depends on reactive oxygen species production and activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathway. We further demonstrate that the heme scavenger hemopexin protects reticulo-endothelial macrophages from heme overload in heme-loaded Hx-null mice and reduces production of cytokines and reactive oxygen species. Importantly, in sickle mice, the administration of human exogenous hemopexin attenuates the inflammatory phenotype of macrophages. Taken together, our data suggest that therapeutic administration of hemopexin is beneficial to counteract heme-driven macrophage-mediated inflammation and its pathophysiologic consequences in sickle cell disease.

Disruption of the endothelial blood-brain barrier (BBB) by PT might facilitate the translocation of immune cells and of hematogenous microbial pathogens. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether PT enhances the traversal of bacteria employing human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) as an in vitro endothelial barrier model. PT incubation significantly increased the translocation of Escherichia coli K1 across the HBMEC barrier. Only intercellular E. coli K1 bacteria could be identified by electron microscopy suggesting paracellular translocation. In addition, the migration of differentiated HL60-derived macrophages and of human monocytic U937 cells through PT-treated HBMEC barriers was also enhanced. In comparison to E. coli C600, E. coli K1 showed prolonged survival in translocated HL60-derived and J774 macrophages as well as in U937 monocytes which suggested a contribution of the 'Trojan horse' mechanism. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the PT-induced permeabilization of endothelial barriers enhances the paracellular transmigration of microbes and immune cells. In vivo, this activity might lower the threshold of bacteremia facilitating secondary cerebral infections and the subsequent development of brain pathologies. Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

The role of macrophages in controlling vascular progenitor differentiation is largely unknown and may play an important role in graft development. This study aims to identify the role of macrophages in vascular stem/progenitor cell differentiation and thereafter elucidate the mechanisms that are involved in the macrophage- mediated process. We provide in vitro evidence that macrophages can induce endothelial cell (EC) differentiation of the stem/progenitor cells while simultaneously inhibiting their smooth muscle cell differentiation. Mechanistically, both effects were mediated by macrophage-derived tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) via TNF-Î± receptor 1 and canonical nuclear factor-ÎºB activation. Although the overexpression of p65 enhanced EC (or attenuated smooth muscle cell) differentiation, p65 or TNF-Î± receptor 1 knockdown using lentiviral short hairpin RNA inhibited EC (or rescued smooth muscle cell) differentiation in response to TNF-Î±. Furthermore, TNF-Î±-mediated EC differentiation was driven by direct binding of nuclear factor-ÎºB (p65) to specific VE-cadherin promoter sequences. Subsequent experiments using an ex vivo decellularized vessel scaffold confirmed an increase in the number of ECs and reduction in smooth muscle cell marker expression in the presence of TNF-Î±. The lack of TNF-Î± in a knockout mouse model of vein graft decreased endothelialization and significantly increased thrombosis formation. Our study highlights the role of macrophages in directing vascular stem/progenitor cell lineage commitment through TNF-Î±-mediated TNF-Î± receptor 1 and nuclear factor-ÎºB activation that is likely required for endothelial repair in vascular diseases such as vein graft.\n\nResveratrol Prevents Tumor Growth and Metastasis by Inhibiting Lymphangiogenesis and M2 Macrophage Activation and Differentiation in Tumor-associated Macrophages.\n\nPubMed\n\nKimura, Yoshiyuki; Sumiyoshi, Maho\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAntitumor and antimetastatic effects of resveratrol on tumor-induced lymphangiogenesis through the regulation of M2 macrophages in tumor-associated macrophages currently remain unknown. Therefore, we herein examined the effects of resveratrol on M2 macrophage activation and differentiation, and those of resveratrol-treated condition medium (CM) in M2 macrophages on vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF)-C-induced migration, invasion, and tube formation by human lymphatic endothelial cells (HLECs). Resveratrol (50Â Î¼M or 5-50Â Î¼M) inhibited the production of interleukin-10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in M2 macrophages, whereas it promoted that of transforming growth factor-Î²1. Resveratrol (25 and 50Â Î¼M) inhibited the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcript 3 without affecting its expression in the differentiation process of M2 macrophages. Furthermore, resveratrol-treated CM of M2 macrophages inhibited VEGF-C-induced HLEC migration, invasion, and lymphangiogenesis. Resveratrol (25Â mg/kg, twice daily) inhibited tumor growth and metastasis to the lung and also reduced the area of lymphatic endothelial cells in tumors (in vivo). These results suggest that the antitumor and antimetastatic effects of resveratrol were partly due to antilymphangiogenesis through the regulation of M2 macrophage activation and differentiation.\n\nDisappearance and reappearance of high endothelial venules and immigrating lymphocytes in lymph nodes deprived of afferent lymphatic vessels: a possible regulatory role of macrophages in lymphocyte migration.\n\nPubMed\n\nHendriks, H R; Eestermans, I L\n\n1983-08-01\n\nInterruption of the afferent lymphatic vessels of the popliteal lymph node resulted in the disappearance of high endothelial venules (HEV) and immigrating lymphocytes within 3 weeks. HEV showed several characteristic morphological changes: the endothelial cells became flattened and less pyroninophilic, the chromatine became condensed and protein synthetizing and secretory cell organelles became scarce. At the same time the number of macrophages in the lymph node was severely reduced. Injection of sheep red blood cells into such lymph nodes, 6 weeks after operation, resulted in reappearance of HEV and immigrating lymphocytes, and development of many plasma cells and some germinal centres. Injection of lipopolysaccharide into the operated lymph nodes resulted in the appearance of many plasma cells and a few poorly developed germinal centres; HEV and immigrating lymphocytes, however, remained almost absent. The results show a relationship between the immigration of lymphocytes and the activity of the endothelial cells in the HEV. The activation of the latter may occur by mediators released by antigen-stimulated macrophages and T cells. Moreover, the morphological features of the HEV are independent of the presence of recirculating lymphocytes.\n\nMacrophages commit postnatal endothelium-derived progenitors to angiogenesis and restrict endothelial to mesenchymal transition during muscle regeneration.\n\nPubMed\n\nZordan, P; Rigamonti, E; Freudenberg, K; Conti, V; Azzoni, E; Rovere-Querini, P; Brunelli, S\n\n2014-01-30\n\nThe damage of the skeletal muscle prompts a complex and coordinated response that involves the interactions of many different cell populations and promotes inflammation, vascular remodeling and finally muscle regeneration. Muscle disorders exist in which the irreversible loss of tissue integrity and function is linked to defective neo-angiogenesis with persistence of tissue necrosis and inflammation. Here we show that macrophages (MPs) are necessary for efficient vascular remodeling in the injured muscle. In particular, MPs sustain the differentiation of endothelial-derived progenitors to contribute to neo-capillary formation, by secreting pro-angiogenic growth factors. When phagocyte infiltration is compromised endothelial-derived progenitors undergo a significant endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), possibly triggered by the activation of transforming growth factor-Î²/bone morphogenetic protein signaling, collagen accumulates and the muscle is replaced by fibrotic tissue. Our findings provide new insights in EndoMT in the adult skeletal muscle, and suggest that endothelial cells in the skeletal muscle may represent a new target for therapeutic intervention in fibrotic diseases.\n\nIntracellular uptake of macromolecules by brain lymphatic endothelial cells during zebrafish embryonic development.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan Lessen, Max; Shibata-Germanos, Shannon; van Impel, Andreas; Hawkins, Thomas A; Rihel, Jason; Schulte-Merker, Stefan\n\n2017-05-12\n\nThe lymphatic system controls fluid homeostasis and the clearance of macromolecules from interstitial compartments. In mammals brain lymphatics were only recently discovered, with significant implications for physiology and disease. We examined zebrafish for the presence of brain lymphatics and found loosely connected endothelial cells with lymphatic molecular signature covering parts of the brain without forming endothelial tubular structures. These brain lymphatic endothelial cells (BLECs) derive from venous endothelium, are distinct from macrophages, and are sensitive to loss of Vegfc. BLECs endocytose macromolecules in a selective manner, which can be blocked by injection of mannose receptor ligands. This first report on brain lymphatic endothelial cells in a vertebrate embryo identifies cells with unique features, including the uptake of macromolecules at a single cell level.

We examined zebrafish for the presence of brain lymphatics and found loosely connected endothelial cells with lymphatic molecular signature covering parts of the brain without forming endothelial tubular structures. These brain lymphatic endothelial cells (BLECs) derive from venous endothelium, are distinct from macrophages, and are sensitive to loss of Vegfc. BLECs endocytose macromolecules in a selective manner, which can be blocked by injection of mannose receptor ligands. This first report on brain lymphatic endothelial cells in a vertebrate embryo identifies cells with unique features, including the uptake of macromolecules at a single cell level. Future studies will address whether this represents an uptake mechanism that is conserved in mammals and how these cells affect functions of the embryonic and adult brain.

In the present study, we investigated whether left atrial endothelial cells would quickly respond structurally and functionally to pressure overload to trigger atrial fibrosis and fibrillation. Six-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent suprarenal abdominal aortic constriction (AAC) or a sham operation. By day 3 after surgery, macrophages were observed to infiltrate into the endocardium. The expression of MCP-1 and E-selectin in atrial endothelium and the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and ED1 in left atrial tissue were enhanced. Atrial endothelial cells were irregularly hypertrophied with the disarrangement of lines of cells by scanning electron microscopy. Various-sized gap formations appeared along the border in atrial endothelial cells, and several macrophages were located just in the endothelial gap. Along with the development of heterogeneous interstitial fibrosis, interatrial conduction time was prolonged and the inducibility of atrial fibrillation by programmed extrastimuli was increased in the AAC rats compared to the sham-operated rats. Atrial endothelium responds rapidly to pressure overload by expressing adhesion molecules and MCP-1, which induce macrophage infiltration into the atrial tissues. These processes could be an initial step in the development of atrial remodeling for atrial fibrillation. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This study investigated the toxicity of pristine and carboxylated MWCNTs to HUVECs and alveolar-endothelial co-culture, the later of which could mimic the possible signaling communications between ECs and MWCNT exposed alveolar cells. The results showed that direct contact with high levels of MWCNTs induced cytotoxicity and modulated expression of genes associated with ER stress (HSPA5, DDIT3 and XBP-1s) and autophagy (BECN1 and ATG12) both in A549-THP-1 macrophages cultured in the upper chambers as well as HUVECs. However, most of these responses were minimal or negligible in HUVECs cultured in the lower chambers. Moreover, significantly increased cytokine release (interleukin-6 and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) was only observed in MWCNT exposed HUVECs (pâ¯<â¯0.01) but not HUVECs cultured in the lower chambers (pâ¯>â¯0.05). The minimal or even absent response was likely due to relatively low translocation of MWCNTs from upper chambers to lower chambers, whereas A549-macrophages cultured in the upper chambers internalized large amount MWCNTs. The results indicated that ER stress-autophagy signaling might not be able to transfer from alveolar cells to endothelial cells unless sufficient MWCNTs are translocated.

We investigated whether GcMAF also acts as an antiangiogenic factor on endothelial cells. The effects of GcMAF on angiogenic growth factor-induced cell proliferation, chemotaxis, and tube formation were examined in vitro by using cultured endothelial cells (murine IBE cells, porcine PAE cells, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells [HUVECs]) and in vivo by using a mouse cornea micropocket assay. Blocking monoclonal antibodies to CD36, a receptor for the antiangiogenic factor thrombospondin-1, which is also a possible receptor for GcMAF, were used to investigate the mechanism of GcMAF action. GcMAF inhibited the endothelial cell proliferation, chemotaxis, and tube formation that were all stimulated by fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), vascular endothelial growth factor-A, or angiopoietin 2. FGF-2-induced neovascularization in murine cornea was also inhibited by GcMAF. Monoclonal antibodies against murine and human CD36 receptor blocked the antiangiogenic action of GcMAF on the angiogenic factor stimulation of endothelial cell chemotaxis. In addition to its ability to activate tumoricidal macrophages, GcMAF has direct antiangiogenic effects on endothelial cells independent of tissue origin. The antiangiogenic effects of GcMAF may be mediated through the CD36 receptor.\n\nExpression of the stem cell factor in fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages in periapical tissues in human chronic periapical diseases.\n\nPubMed\n\nShen, S Q; Wang, R; Huang, S G\n\n2017-03-08\n\nStem cell factor (SCF), an important stem cell cytokine, has multiple functions. Fibroblasts (FBs), mature mast cells, endothelial cells (ECs), and eosinophil granulocytes can produce SCF in the inflammatory process. Therefore, we aimed to observe SCF expression in FBs, ECs, and macrophages (MPs) in periapical tissues in human chronic periapical disease and investigate the effects of cells expressing SCF in pathogenesis of the disease. Healthy (N = 20), periapical cyst (N = 15), and periapical granuloma (N = 15) tissues were fixed in 10% formalin for 48 h, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin to observe histological changes. SCF expression was observed in FBs, ECs, and MPs in periapical tissues by double immunofluorescence. CD334, CD31, and CD14 are specific markers of FBs, ECs, and MPs, respectively. Results showed that densities of CD334-SCF double-positive FBs, CD31-SCF double-positive ECs, and CD14-SCF double-positive MPs were significantly increased in periapical tissue groups (P < 0.01). There were no significant differences in CD334-SCF double-positive FB and CD31-SCF double-positive EC levels between the two periapical tissue groups (P > 0.05). CD14-SCF double-positive MP density was considerably higher in periapical granulomas than in cysts (P < 0.01). FB, EC, and MP levels were significantly high and densities of CD334-SCF double-positive FBs, CD31-SCF double-positive ECs, and CD14-SCF double-positive MPs improved considerably in chronic periapical tissues, suggesting that the cells might be related to occurrence, development, and pathogenesis of chronic periapical disease.\n\nPeriodontitis-activated monocytes/macrophages cause aortic inflammation\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMiyajima, Shin-ichi; Naruse, Keiko; Kobayashi, Yasuko; Nakamura, Nobuhisa; Nishikawa, Toru; Adachi, Kei; Suzuki, Yuki; Kikuchi, Takeshi; Mitani, Akio; Mizutani, Makoto; Ohno, Norikazu; Noguchi, Toshihide; Matsubara, Tatsuaki\n\n2014-01-01\n\nA relationship between periodontal disease and atherosclerosis has been suggested by epidemiological studies. Ligature-induced experimental periodontitis is an adequate model for clinical periodontitis, which starts from plaque accumulation, followed by inflammation in the periodontal tissue. Here we have demonstrated using a ligature-induced periodontitis model that periodontitis activates monocytes/macrophages, which subsequently circulate in the blood and adhere to vascular endothelial cells without altering the serum TNF-Î± concentration. Adherent monocytes/macrophages induced NF-ÎºB activation and VCAM-1 expression in the endothelium and increased the expression of the TNF-Î± signaling cascade in the aorta. Peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cells from rats with experimental periodontitis showed enhanced adhesion and increased NF-ÎºB/VCAM-1 in cultured vascular endothelial cells. Our results suggest that periodontitis triggers the initial pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, inflammation of the vasculature, through activating monocytes/macrophages.

We sought to understand how endothelial state determines liver recover after hepatectomy and engraftment. Design Matrix-embedded endothelial cells (MEECs) with retained healthy phenotype or control acellular matrices were implanted in direct contact with the remaining median lobe of donor mice undergoing partial hepatectomy (70%), or in the interface between the remaining median lobe and an autograft or isograft from the left lobe in hepatectomized recipient mice. Hepatic vascular architecture, DNA fragmentation and apoptosis in the median lobe and grafts, serum markers of liver damage and phenotype of macrophage and lymphocyte subsets in the liver after engraftment were analyzed 7 days post-op. Results Healthy MEECs create a functional vascular splice in donor and recipient liver after 70% hepatectomy in mouse protecting these livers from ischemic injury, hepatic congestion and inflammation. Macrophages recruited adjacent to the vascular nodes into the implants switched to an anti-inflammatory and regenerative profile M2. MEECs improved liver function and the rate of liver regeneration and prevented apoptosis in donor liver lobes, autologous grafts, and allogeneic engraftment. Conclusions Implants with healthy endothelial cells rescue liver donor and recipient endothelium and parenchyma from ischemic injury after major hepatectomy and engraftment. This study highlights endothelial-hepatocyte crosstalk in hepatic repair and provides a promising new approach to improve regenerative medicine outcomes and liver transplantation.

According to new data endothelial cells and hematopoietic cells have a common precursor in prenatal life--a hemangioblast, which explains the fact of sharing the same determinants on the surface of both type of cells. Circulating endothelial precursors were identified in adults and this suggests that hemangioblasts may be present not only during embriogenesis. In some clinical situations the increased numbers of endothelial cells and endothelial precursors were noted, and especially in patients with neoplastic diseases, which is probably the result of increased angiogenesis. Endothelial precursors are thought to be the promice for therapeutic purposes in future--to increase local angiogenesis.\n\nIntracellular Survival of Staphylococcus aureus in Endothelial Cells: A Matter of Growth or Persistence\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRollin, Guillaume; Tan, Xin; Tros, Fabiola; Dupuis, Marion; Nassif, Xavier; Charbit, Alain; Coureuil, Mathieu\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe Gram-positive human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of severe bacterial infections. Recent studies have shown that various cell types could readily internalize S. aureus and infected cells have been proposed to serve as vehicle for the systemic dissemination of the pathogen. Here we focused on the intracellular behavior of the Community-Associated Methicillin-Resistant S. aureus strain USA300. Supporting earlier observations, we found that wild-type S. aureus strain USA300 persisted for longer period within endothelial cells than within macrophages and that a mutant displaying the small colony variant phenotype (ÎhemDBL) had increased intracellular persistence. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that initial persistence of wild-type bacteria in endothelial cells corresponded to distinct single cell events, ranging from active intracellular bacterial proliferation, leading to cell lysis, to non-replicating bacterial persistence even 1 week after infection. In sharp contrast, ÎhemDBL mutant bacteria were essentially non-replicating up to 10 days after infection. These findings suggest that internalization of S. aureus in endothelial cells triggers its persistence and support the notion that endothelial cells might constitute an intracellular persistence niche responsible for reported relapse of infection after antibiotic therapy.

Here, we investigate the cellular interactions between innate immune cells and endothelial cells at wounds that drive neoangiogenic sprouting in real time and inÂ vivo Our studies in mouse and zebrafish wounds indicate that macrophages are drawn to wound blood vessels soon after injury and are intimately associated throughout the repair process and that macrophage ablation results in impaired neoangiogenesis.Â Macrophages also positively influence wound angiogenesis by driving resolution of anti-angiogenic wound neutrophils. Experimental manipulation of the wound environment to specifically alter macrophage activation state dramatically influences subsequent blood vessel sprouting, with premature dampening of tumour necrosis factor-Î± expression leading to impaired neoangiogenesis. Complementary human tissue culture studies indicate that inflammatory macrophages associate with endothelial cells and are sufficient to drive vessel sprouting via vascular endothelial growth factor signalling. Subsequently, macrophages also play a role in blood vessel regression during the resolution phase of wound repair, and their absence, or shifted activation state, impairs appropriate vessel clearance.

FACS analysis revealed accumulations of CD11b+ cells in the tumors. Microarray analysis indicated that the NFSA cells expressed a high level of the pro-inflammatory factor interleukin-18 (il-18), which is known to play a critical role in macrophages. However, little is known about the physiological function of IL-18-stimulated macrophages. Here, we provide direct evidence that IL-18 enhances the phagocytosis of RAW264 cells and peritoneal macrophages, accompanied by the increased expression of tumor necrosis factor (tnf-Î±), interleukin-6 (il-6) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (Nos2). IL-18-stimulated RAW264 cells showed an enhanced cytotoxicity to endothelial F-2 cells via direct cell-to-cell interaction and the secretion of soluble mediators. Taken together, our results demonstrate that tumor-derived IL-18 plays an important role in the phagocytosis of macrophages and that IL-18-stimulated macrophages may damage tumor endothelial cells.

A growing body of evidence suggests the contribution of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells, monocytic cells, and mature endothelial cells to vessel formation and endothelial rejuvenation. To this day, various subsets of these endothelial-regenerating cells have been identified according to cellular origin, phenotype, and properties in vivo and in vitro. However, the definition and biology, especially of endothelial progenitor cells, is complex and under heavy debate. In this review, we focus on current definitions of endothelial progenitor cells, highlight the clinical relevance of endothelial-regenerating cells, and provide new insights into cell-cell interactions involved in endothelial cell rejuvenation.\n\nNitro-oleic acid inhibits vascular endothelial inflammatory responses and the endothelial-mesenchymal transition.\n\nPubMed\n\nAmbrozova, Gabriela; Fidlerova, Tana; Verescakova, Hana; Koudelka, Adolf; Rudolph, Tanja K; Woodcock, Steven R; Freeman, Bruce A; Kubala, Lukas; Pekarova, Michaela\n\n2016-11-01\n\nInflammatory-mediated pathological processes in the endothelium arise as a consequence of the dysregulation of vascular homeostasis. Of particular importance are mediators produced by stimulated monocytes/macrophages inducing activation of endothelial cells (ECs). This is manifested by excessive soluble pro-inflammatory mediator production and cell surface adhesion molecule expression. Nitro-fatty acids are endogenous products of metabolic and inflammatory reactions that display immuno-regulatory potential and may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to treat inflammatory diseases. The purpose of our study was to characterize the effects of nitro-oleic acid (OA-NO2) on inflammatory responses and the endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) in ECs that is a consequence of the altered healing phase of the immune response. The effect of OA-NO2 on inflammatory responses and EndMT was determined in murine macrophages and murine and human ECs using Western blotting, ELISA, immunostaining, and functional assays. OA-NO2 limited the activation of macrophages and ECs by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine production and adhesion molecule expression through its modulation of STAT, MAPK and NF-ÎºB-regulated signaling. OA-NO2 also decreased transforming growth factor-Î²-stimulated EndMT and pro-fibrotic phenotype of ECs. These effects are related to the downregulation of Smad2/3. The study shows the pleiotropic effect of OA-NO2 on regulating EC-macrophage interactions during the immune response and suggests a role for OA-NO2 in the regulation of vascular endothelial immune and fibrotic responses arising during chronic inflammation. These findings propose the OA-NO2 may be useful as a novel therapeutic agent for treatment of cardiovascular disorders associated with dysregulation of the endothelial immune response.

Following tissue injury, monocytes and macrophages undergo marked phenotypic and functional changes to play critical roles during the initiation, maintenance, and resolution phases of tissue repair. Disturbances in macrophage function can lead to aberrant repair, with uncontrolled inflammatory mediator and growth factor production, deficient generation of anti-inflammatory macrophages, or failed communication between macrophages and epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and stem or tissue progenitor cells all contributing to a state of persistent injury, which may lead to the development of pathological fibrosis. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms that instruct macrophages to adopt pro-inflammatory, pro-wound healing, pro-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, pro-resolving, and tissue regenerating phenotypes following injury, and highlight how some of these mechanisms and macrophage activation states could be exploited therapeutically.

Human umbilical vein cells (ECV304) were cultured in vitro and divided into 4 groups, i.e. (1) ECV304 group, (2) ECV304 + conA group [with conA (25 microg/ml in culture) added to ECV304], (3) ECV304 + U937 group (with 1 x 10(5)/ml of U937 cells added to 1 x 10(5)/ml ECV 304), (4) ECV304 + U937 + conA group [with 1 x 10(5)/ml of U937 cells and conA (25 microg/ml in culture)] groups. Forty-eight hours after culturing, the expression of integrin receptor alpha nu beta3 and the changes in the expression of KDR mRNA and HOXB2 mRNA in each group were determined by immunofluorescent technique and RT-PCR, respectively. The expression of integrin receptor alpha nu beta3, KDR mRNA, and HOXB2 mRNA in ECV304 group were 6.7 +/- 1.5, 0.633 +/- 0.012, and 0.674 +/- 0.004, respectively, while those in ECV304 + U937 + conA group (10.2 +/- 1.7, 0.879 +/- 0.003, 0.947 +/- 0.003) were obviously more upregulated when compared with those in ECV304 group (P < 0.01). No difference in the above indices was found between ECV304 and ECV304 + conA, ECV304 + U937 groups (P > 0.05). Macrophages activated by ConA can accelerate the proliferation, migration and adhesion to the basement membrane matrix of vascular endothelial cells through the influence on the expression of KDR mRNA, HOXB2 mRNA and integrin alpha nu beta3, and through this pathway the angiogenesis is modulated.\n\nAngiogenesis in mucous retention cyst: a human in vivo-like model of endothelial cell differentiation in mucous substrate.\n\nPubMed\n\nSwelam, Wael; Ida-Yonemochi, Hiroko; Saku, Takashi\n\n2005-01-01\n\nMucous retention cysts contain a mucous pool in the lumina, in which pure angiogenic processes are occasionally observed. By using this unique human material, our aim was to understand the in vivo angiogenic process. Fifteen surgical tissue samples of mucous retention cysts of the lip were examined for expression of vascular endothelial markers and extracellular matrix molecules by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization (ISH). Endothelial cells forming new vascular channels showed immunopositivities for CD31, CD34, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and von Willebrand factor (vWF). These newly formed capillaries were surrounded by tenascin-positive matrices and further by a dense infiltration of CD68-positive cells with foamy to epitheloid appearances. Some of these cells were simultaneously positive for CD34, VEGF, and one of its receptors, Flk-1, and they showed definite mRNA as well as protein signals for tenascin. In addition, these cells often tended to be aligned, which suggested tubule formation. The results suggest that monocyte/macrophage lineage cells are a major source for endothelial cells at least in mucous retention cysts and that tenascin produced by those cells plays an important role in differentiation of endothelial cells.\n\nEndothelial cell-fatty acid binding protein 4 promotes angiogenesis: role of stem cell factor/c-kit pathway\n\nPubMed Central\n\nElmasri, Harun; Ghelfi, Elisa; Yu, Chen-wei; Traphagen, Samantha; Cernadas, Manuela; Cao, Haiming; Shi, Guo-Ping; Plutzky, Jorge; Sahin, Mustafa; Hotamisligil, Gokhan; Cataltepe, Sule\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) plays an important role in regulation of glucose and lipid homeostasis as well as inflammation through its actions in adipocytes and macrophages. FABP4 is also expressed in a subset of endothelial cells, but its role in this cell type is not known. We found that FABP4-deficient human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) demonstrate a markedly increased susceptibility to apoptosis as well as decreased migration and capillary network formation. Aortic rings from FABP4â/â mice demonstrated decreased angiogenic sprouting, which was recovered by reconstitution of FABP4. FABP4 was strongly regulated by mTORC1 and inhibited by Rapamycin. FABP4 modulated activation of several important signaling pathways in HUVECs, including downregulation of P38, eNOS, and stem cell factor (SCF)/c-kit signaling. Of these, the SCF/c-kit pathway was found to have a major role in attenuated angiogenic activity of FABP4-deficient ECs as provision of exogenous SCF resulted in a significant recovery in cell proliferation, survival, morphogenesis, and aortic ring sprouting. These data unravel a novel pro-angiogenic role for endothelial cell-FABP4 and suggest that it could be exploited as a potential target for diseases associated with pathological angiogenesis.

Recently, easy and robust assay systems for assessing the macrophage-activating factor (MAF) using monocytic cell line-derived macrophages were established. Gene-expression profiles of U937- and THP-1-derived macrophages were compared using gene expression microarray analysis and their responses against several MAFs were examined by in vitro experiments. Activated states of these macrophages could not be assigned to a specific sub-type but showed, however, different unique characteristics. The unique of monocytic cell line-derived macrophages could provide clues to understand the activation mechanism of macrophages and, therefore, help to develop effective cancer immunotherapy with MAFs.

In the light of recent findings, we may have to redefine our thinking of endothelial cells as well as of perivascular mural cells. Recent findings Inflammatory hematopoietic cells, such as macrophages, have been shown to promote neoangiogenesis during tumor growth and wound healing. Dendritic cells, B lymphocytes, monocytes, and other immune cells have also been found to be recruited to neoangiogenic niches and to support neovessel formation. These findings have led to the concept that subsets of hematopoietic cells comprise proangiogenic cells that drive adult revascularization processes. While evidence of the importance of endothelial progenitor cells in adult vasculogenesis increased further, the role of these comobilized hematopoietic cells has been intensely studied in the last few years. Summary Angiogenic factors promote mobilization of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1-positive hematopoietic cells through matrix metalloproteinase-9 mediated release of soluble kit-ligand and recruit these proangiogenic cells to areas of hypoxia, where perivascular mural cells present stromal-derived factor 1 (CXCL-12) as an important retention signal. The same factors are possibly involved in mobilization of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2-positive endothelial precursors that may participate in neovessel formation. The complete characterization of mechanisms, mediators and signaling pathways involved in these processes will provide novel targets for both anti and proangiogenic therapeutic strategies.

However, such properties are believed to be a possible major cause of \"unsafety\" of these materials. For this reason, increasing attention has been due to assess how AuNPs affect cell behaviour in cultures. In the present work, we investigate the effects of PMA polymer-coated Au@PMA PEGylated (8.9 Â± 0.2 nm) or not (6.6 Â± 0.6 nm) on HUVECs and macrophages, which are model cell types likely to interact with Au@PMA after systemic administration in vivo, using a multiparametric approach. Testing different NPs concentrations and incubation times, we analysed the effect of such NPs on cell viability, oxidative stress, inflammatory processes, and cell uptake. Our data suggested that Au@PMA reduced the cell viability mostly through oxidative stress and TNF-Î± production after the uptake by HUVECs and macrophages, respectively. PEGylation conferred improved biocompatibility to Au@PMA in particular, no significant effects on any parameter tested could be observed at a concentration of 20 Âµg mL-1. This approach allowed us to explore different aspects of cell-NPs interaction and to suggest that these NPs could be potentially used for the in vivo studies.\n\nInvasive breast carcinoma cells from patients exhibit MenaINV- and macrophage-dependent transendothelial migration\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPignatelli, Jeanine; Goswami, Sumanta; Jones, Joan G.; Rohan, Thomas E.; Pieri, Evan; Chen, Xiaoming; Adler, Esther; Cox, Dianne; Maleki, Sara; Bresnick, Anne; Gertler, Frank B.; Condeelis, John S.; Oktay, Maja H.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nMetastasis is a complex, multistep process of cancer progression that has few treatment options.
