        "text": "Mean Girls also helped establish 2000s \"It Girl\" starpower: Lindsay Lohan became a household name; Amanda Seyfried, a future Oscar nominee, made her film debut; and McAdams starred opposite Ryan Gosling in The Notebook later that same year. Even Fey, who was already a popular \"SNL\" regular, found herself climbing to a new level of fame.\n\nInternet culture helped Mean Girls find a second life — and music importantly helped it find a third. The 2004 film’s comedic timelessness earned a musical stage adaptation of the same name, which debuted in Washington D.C. in 2017 and ran on Broadway from April 2018 to March 2020.\n\nA film adaptation of the musical (also of the same name) is hitting theaters on Jan. 12, in which Rapp reprises her Broadway role of Regina George. (Rapp played the blonde queen bee as a 2019-2020 replacement for Taylor Louderman.)\n\n\"As Regina, Reneé has this quality that Regina has to have, which is you're scared of her, but you also really want her to like you,\" Fey, who returned to write the Mean Girls (2024) screenplay, told Screen Rant. \"You want her to notice you. You want her to approve of you. You want her to shine her light on you.\"\n\nIn addition to Rapp as the Plastics’ reigning leader, the Mean Girls musical has quite the roster. The film stars Christopher Briney as her love interest Aaron Samuels, Bebe Wood as Plastics’ member Gretchen Wieners, and Busy Phillips as Regina's mom (a character originally portrayed by Amy Poheler).\n\nFey knew that a brilliant cast was only one step toward making the 2024 musical film a success. Alongside directors Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr., Fey was tasked with crafting something modern and innovative that still maintained the magic of the original.\n\n\"I think the key goals for this version were for it to be fun, fresh, and surprising,\" Fey told Screen Rant. \"Most people who will see this movie have seen the original; a fair chunk of them have seen the musical, but how can we delight and surprise them? What can we give them that they didn't expect while still bringing them these characters that they have affection for?\"\n\nPerfect surprises can take a long time to craft. The stage musical took years to put together, for instance; the creative process began in 2013, and it debuted on stage four years later. But it was all worth the wait — the show was refreshing and nuanced, constructed carefully for its eager and often young audiences.\n\n\"I really love that we’re bringing young people out, especially young women,\" Broadway performer Louderman told Cosmopolitan. \"I want [young people women] to feel more empowered to say how they feel and to deal with their emotions in a very straightforward and respectful manner.\"\n\nFor the sake of time and tonality, not all 14 songs from the original Broadway musical made the cut in the 2024 film adaptation. Each song was reworked by lyricist Jeff Richmond and composer Neil Benjamin. Taking the essence of the 2004 film, Richmond and Benjamin’s lyrics transformed Mean Girls into a new theatrical form. From Regina’s hair-raising anthem \"World Burn\" to ex-Plastic Janis Ian’s cathartic \"I’d Rather Be Me,\" music breathed new life into the movie’s classic genius.\n\nFrom the screen to the stage to, well, the screen again, Mean Girls has stood the test of time for good reason. Beyond its enduring cultural relevance and musical revitalization, its classic comedy makes it stand out — whether a laugh is conveyed through a perfectly delivered line on screen, or a witty lyric belted out on stage.\n\n\"It makes you laugh rather than depicting [adolescence] as solely being a drag,\" director Mark Waters said of the original Mean Girls to Cosmopolitan. \"It also makes you realize you’re going to survive, make it out of this phase and be a better person for it.\"\n\nWaters’ comment sheds light on a critical, though often painful lesson from Mean Girls: accepting change. Though it was predominantly written for female adolescents in mind as a target audience, the film smartly speaks to more than female politics: it encapsulates the human experience. Nearly everyone knows what it’s like wanting to desperately fit in, what it’s like to want to skip your awkward teenage years full of crushes and acne and jealousy. When an originally homeschooled Cady finds herself in high school for the first time, she learns to adapt — and most importantly, learns how to stay true to herself.\n\n\"It seems to be a rite of passage for high school girls to see the movie,\" Waters continued. \"Beyond all the gags, there's something that's really authentic and timeless about how much of a struggle it is to be that age.\"\n\nWhile some may superficially disregard Mean Girls as a silly chick flick or throwaway teen comedy, its modern revamps through music speak to the film's timelessness. Beyond being a stellar candidate for reinvention over a generation, Mean Girls meets audiences where they're at.\n\n\"​​It has this little net that catches girls as they pass through preteen and high school age,\" Fey told the New York Times. \"Girls will come up to me and say it helped them get through a terrible year.\"\n\nWhether it’s 2004 or 2024, Mean Girls is one of those films that’s comfortable knowing exactly what it is. It’s okay with being silly, and it still has more than enough heart. Like its protagonist Cady, Mean Girls isn’t supposed to be perfect; it’s just meant to be relatable. And that’s what makes it so fetch.\n\nReneé Rapp On Debut Album 'Snow Angel,' Her Musical Community & Being Honest \"To A Fault\"\n\nThe Japanese House | Yvonne Gougelet for Bonnaroo 2024\n\nSince its 2015 inception, The Japanese House has always been in the zeitgeist. Where Amber Bain's heavily layered, mournful music was inescapable during the pale-grunge Tumblr era, it now occupies a much lighter space. Coming off of a banner year and a critically acclaimed album, In the End it Always Does, Bain has been embracing her pop side like never before.\n\nHer set was a cornucopia of new and old sounds, the most exciting part of which was her new song, \"Smiley Face.\" Written a year ago when Bain met her current fiancée on a dating app, \"Smiley Face\" is bright, soft, and sploshy, fraught with the energy of someone falling deliriously in love. \"[When we first met] she lived in Detroit and I lived in London, and I would stay awake until she fell asleep,\" Bain tells GRAMMY.com of the song. \"We were in different time zones. I was running on nothing — I felt a bit high.\"\n\nLike the rest of her discography, the song held the audience in the palm of its hand, this time enveloping us in a warm, flickering glow. \"I could be losing my mind but something's happening,\" Bain sang, naturally, with a smile on her face.\n\nTV Girl Delivered A Masterclass In Melodrama\n\n\"I have a bit of stage fright,\" revealed TV Girl singer Brad Petering before the group's second to last song. Even if he felt it, stage fright wasn't apparent during the indie pop band's hour-long performance. Their set felt like a dream; onlookers got lost in the moment, spinning, swaying and dancing in the refreshingly cool breeze.\n\nIt fell serendipitously near the 10th anniversary of their debut, French Exit, an album that launched them into the limelight as stalwarts of indie pop. Songs like \"Louise\" and \"Lovers Rock\" felt almost nostalgic 10 years on, and newer cuts like \"99.5\" and \"The Nighttime\" blended right in. Backed by a full band — including backup singers Kiera and Mnya, whose powerhouse vocals could've made for their own show — TV Girl turned already dynamic songs like \"Birds Don't Sing\" and \"Not Allowed\" into even fuller, radiant versions of themselves.\n\nEthel Cain Took Us To Church"
