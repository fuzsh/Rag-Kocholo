        "text": "I fell out of love with baseball cards in 1981, when I turned 13. I mean that first, purest love. So I didn’t know that Skip Lockwood, shown here in his 1981 card, ever played for my favorite team until just last year, when this card came to me among a collection I scavenged from a friend of a friend who’d deemed that the cards from his childhood were not something he needed anymore. The majority of the cards had already come to me in my own childhood (and that I’m still holding onto), but some of them were new to me. This was thrilling, seeing cards like this, like an echo of falling in love.\n\nThe forlorn mouth-breathing hero shown in my hand at the top of this page was done by 1981, his last season in the majors captured on the back of this card. In 1980, he struggled through 24 games for the mediocre 1980 Red Sox, his one effective pitch, a fastball, faltering, losing its sting, his ERA for the season ballooning at times to over 6 runs a game before settling in at 5.32 for the year, the worst mark of his career. And it all happened in Skip Lockwood’s own home town, closing a circle on an itinerant, resilient major league career that had started at age 18, less than a year after he’d signed with the Kansas City A’s out of high school."
