        "text": "By Curt Herron – for the IWCOA\n\nMuch as the Illinois Wrestling Coaches and Officials Association’s Boys Freshman/Sophomore State Championships has served as a second-chance for boys who missed out on qualifying for the IHSA Individual Finals for nearly three decades, the IWCOA Girls Open Championships now has a similar role after being a catalyst for the foundation for the young sport’s IHSA Individual Finals series, which capped its third season with many significant accomplishments as well as a tremendous amount of enthusiasm due to the explosive early growth of the sport.\n\nA total of 301 girls met to determine the 15 champions and the 120 medal winners who finished in eighth-place or better. Any individual who had competed at the eight sectional sites, Evanston Township, Granite City, Heyworth, Lake Zurich, Naperville Central, Shepard, Sterling and Thornton Township, could participate in the two-day event at Bank of Springfield Center.\n\nAmong the eight IWCOA Sectionals, Thornton Township produced the most state champions with five. They were Minooka seniors Bella Cyrkiel (145) and Abbey Boersma (155), Romeoville sophomore Daniela Santander (95), Seneca/Plainfield Central senior Courtni Chuway (110) and Homewood-Flossmoor junior Nina Hamm (120).\n\nOther champions who also won IWCOA sectionals were Sherrard senior Brianna Bynum (135) and Sycamore freshman Jasmine Enriquez (235) at Sterling, Dundee-Crown junior Diamond Rodriguez (100) at Lake Zurich, Centennial freshman Ava Beldo (115) at Heyworth, Proviso West freshman Tierra Hardin (125) at Evanston Township and West Aurora junior Brittney Moran (190) at Naperville Central.\n\nGranite City’s two champions, sophomore Ma’Kayla Bonner (105) and freshman Audrey Barnes (130), did not win titles at their own sectional with Barnes and Bonner taking second. Along with Minooka’s two champions, seniors Bella Cyrkiel (145) and Abbey Boersma (155), this is the first time since the initial tournament in 2017 that two athletes from two schools won four of titles.\n\nBloomington sophomore Alicia Swank (140) also didn’t win an IWCOA Sectional title, finishing second at Heyworth. And Palatine junior Sabrina Cargill (170) also went from taking second at the Lake Zurich Sectional to a title winner in Springfield. Cyrkiel and Swank won IWCOA Girls Open Championships for the second year in a row, at the same weights as they did in 2023. They join seven other individuals who have won two or more titles in the competition.\n\nSecond-place finishers in the IWCOA Girls Open were Canton freshman LT Diephuis (95), Curie Metropolitan sophomore Giselle Arambula (100), Wauconda senior Lilliana Aly (105), Edwardsville junior Gianna Linhorst (110), Neuqua Valley senior Veronika Arabova (115), Kaneland junior Dyani Torres (120), Addison Trail sophomore Brithany Mondragan (125) and Shepard senior Stacey Massey (130).\n\nOther IWCOA Girls Open Championships runners-up were Geneseo senior Gia Ritter (135), Plainfield North freshman Viktoriia Rodnikova (140), Oswego freshman Makayla Hill (145), Oswego East junior Jessica Stover (155), Bloom Township junior Kinnidi Riley (170), Fremd junior Jazz Ocampo (190) and Palatine freshman Monika Irazoque (235).\n\nAll of the finalists but four of the second-place finishers advanced to the IHSA sectionals. The four second-place finishers who did not advance from their regional were Addison Trail’s Mondragon, Oswego East’s Stover, Palatine’s Irazoque and Bloom Township’s Riley, with the latter not being able to qualify from a boys regional.\n\nFive of the champions and six runners-up saw their IHSA seasons conclude at the rugged Schaumburg Sectional. Six of the title winners and three second-place finishers missed out on trips to state at the Geneseo Sectional. Three champions and one runner-up were eliminated at the Richwoods Sectional while one title winner and one second-place finisher saw their hopes dashed at the Evanston Township Sectional.\n\nThe Southwest Prairie Conference prides itself as one of the top conferences in the sport and the 10-team league from the southwest suburbs dominated the field at the Illinois Wrestling Coaches and Officials Association’s Girls Open Championships as it had five individuals who competed in the SPC Tournament who won titles and three others who took second place.\n\nThe SPC stood out in consecutive weight classes, 145 and 155, with all four of the finalists being from the Southwest Prairie Conference. Of the conference’s eight finalists, five were SPC champions and two took second place. Santander (95), Chuway (110), Cyrkiel (145) and Moran (190) all won titles in both the IWCOA Girls Open and in their conference.\n\nBoersma (155), who took fourth in the SPC, won the IWCOA title at 155. Rodnikova (140), who won the SPC title, took second. Hill (145) and Stover (155) took second place in both the\n\nIWCOA Open Championships and in the SPC meet.\n\nThe Southwest Prairie Conference finished with 12 medal winners while the Mid-Suburban League had 10 individuals who were medalists for top-eight finishes.\n\nBelleville West had consecutive champions in the inaugural Girls Open Championships in 2017, Kaylee Foster (146) and Brooke Holt (156). Relentless Pursuit also had two champions in 2017’s debut Open, Riverside-Brookfield’s Jelitza Cortes (96) and Amanda Martinez (136) and Relentless Pursuit also had two title winners in 2018, but they were from different schools.\n\nSwank and Cyrkiel join seven others who won two or more IWCOA Girls Open Championships. El Paso-Gridley’s Gabrielle Hamilton (191 in 2017 and 2018, 180 in 2019) won three titles while Vandalia’s Morgan Dothager (101), Belvidere’s Mia Rodriguez (111) and Jacksonville’s Jocelyn Murphy (117) took firsts in 2017 and 2018. The other two-time champions in the competition are East Peoria’s Randi Robison (122 in 2017, 132 in 2019), Stevenson’s Sara Sulejmani (145 in 2019, 138 in 2021) and Lanphier’s Ella Miloncus (105 in 2022, 110 in 2023).\n\nGeneseo and Schaumburg both had four medal winners to lead all schools. Others that had three medalists included Lincoln-Way Central, Morris, Oswego, Shepard and Wheaton North.\n\nSchools that had the most participants included Shepard (10), Batavia (7), Schaumburg (7), Maine East (6), Oswego (6), Rickover Naval Academy (6), Geneseo (5), Kankakee (5), Larkin (5), Lincoln-Way Central (5) and Metea Valley (5).\n\nHere’s a look at the 15 champions and the other medalists from the 2024 Illinois Wrestling Coaches and Officials Association’s Girls Open Championships:\n\n95 – Daniela Santander, Romeoville\n\nAfter falling one win shy of earning a trip to state from the the tough Schaumburg Sectional to conclude a 28-8 sophomore season, Romeoville’s Daniela Santander was looking for a better way to close things out and found it at the IWCOA Girls Open Championships when she won the title at 95 by recording a fall at 4:07 over Canton’s LT Diephuis. Santander, the only medalist of the three individuals the Spartans had at the tournament, recorded two-straight falls, including one in 1:53 over New Trier’s Sunny Aitzemkour in the quarterfinals, before winning a 12-4 major decision over East Peoria’s Abella Brown in the semifinals.\n\nCanton freshman LT Diephuis concluded a 10-16 season at the Geneseo Sectional and likely\n\nfelt much better after winning three-straight matches by fall to advance to the 95 title match at the IWCOA Girls Open. The top finisher of two medal winners and one of three Little Giants who competed in the tournament, she recorded a fall in 3:34 over Naperville Central’s Annika Hull in the semifinals to earn her spot in the finals. For third place, Triad’s Claire Crouch won by fall in 2:49 over Naperville Central’s Annika Hull. In the fifth-place match, Wheaton North’s Izzy Paz captured a 6-4 decision over East Peoria’s Abella Brown. And for seventh place, Curie Metropolitan’s Melani Martinez won with a pin in 4:25 over New Trier’s Sunny Aitzemkour.\n\n100 – Diamond Rodriguez, Dundee-Crown\n\nDundee-Crown junior Diamond Rodriguez joined many other competitors who knew that they were good enough to qualify for the IHSA Individual Finals but were unable to get there as the result of competing in the Schaumburg Sectional. But she was able to get some consolation after closing out a 28-5 season by capturing top honors at 100 at the IWCOA Girls Open Championships when she won by fall in 0:41 over Curie Metropolitan’s Giselle Arambula. Rodriguez, who was eliminated in the sectional by the IWCOA’s 95 champion, Romeoville’s\n\nDaniela Santander, was one of two champions for the Chargers in Springfield, with Teigen Moreno winning the IWCOA Frosh/Soph Boys title at 215. Rodriguez pinned her way to the title with four falls, with three of those ending in the first period, including in 1:54 over TF South’s Dakodia Kelly in the quarterfinals. She won by fall in 4:29 over Lincoln-Way Central’s Emily Peyton in the semifinals.\n\n“Honestly, my second match was harder, but this was exhausting,” Rodriguez said. “A lot of these girls were pretty tough so I was really glad that I was able to win this. (At the Schaumburg Sectional) I actually lost 6-7 to the girl that was the champion at 95 pounds. I feel like it was cut short for me, maybe if I was in a different sectional I probably could have gone. I’m just glad that I had the opportunity to wrestle here after not competing at state. It was kind of a second opportunity. So even though I didn’t get to state individually, I’m still glad that I got this far.”\n\nCurie Metropolitan sophomore Giselle Arambula lost in both the semifinals and consolation semifinals at the Evanston Township Sectional to fall one win shy of a trip to the IHSA Finals and conclude a 22-7 season. The top finisher of the Condors’ two medalists, she opened with a fall, won a 13-11 decision and then got a pin in 3:43 over Canton’s Shayla Schielein in the semifinals. For third place, Sandwich’s Norah Vick captured a 7-2 decision over Dunlap’s Aerith Adams. In the fifth-place match, Lincoln-Way Central’s Emily Peyton won by fall in 1:43 over Canton’s Shayla Schielein. And Bismarck-Henning-Rossville-Alvin’s Gracie Pattison claimed seventh place by medical forfeit over Mt. Vernon’s Lilly Davis.\n\n105 – Ma’Kayla Bonner, Granite City\n\nGranite City’s Ma’Kayla Bonner and Audrey Barnes both came up a bit short of trips to the IHSA Finals at the Richwoods Sectional, so they decided to take part in the IWCOA Girls Open Championships to end things on a better note and they both wound up winning titles with Bonner taking first at 105 and Barnes placing first at 130 to make the Warriors and Minooka the only two schools in the competition that had two title winners. Bonner, a sophomore who went 24-15 this season, took top honors at 105 when she won 6-4 in sudden victory over Wauconda’s Lilliana Aly. She opened with a fall and then won 10-9 over Westinghouse College Prep’s Kimani Glasper before prevailing 7-5 in sudden victory over Schaumburg’s Justice Girod in the semifinals.\n\nWauconda senior Lilliana Aly joined a lot of other quality individuals who were unable to qualify from the rugged Schaumburg Sectional and closed out her final season with a 19-10 record. She opened the IWCOA Girls Open Championships with three-consecutive falls and earned her spot on the title mat by winning an 8-5 decision over Larkin’s Ashley Hammond in the semifinals. In the third-place match, Westinghouse College Prep’s Kimani Glasper claimed an 8-3 decision over Schaumburg’s Justice Girod. For fifth place, Larkin’s Ashley Hammond captured a 13-0 major decision over Rochester’s Carlly Ho. And in the seventh-place match, Morris’ Maggie Gordon recorded a fall in 2:38 over Neuqua Valley’s Sofia Gold.\n\n110 – Courtni Chuway, Seneca\n\nPlainfield Central senior Courtni Chuway lost in both the semifinals and consolation semifinals at the Geneseo Sectional to fall short of a trip to the IHSA Individual Finals by one win as she concluded her high school career with a 29-8 record this season. She decided to compete in the IWCOA Girls Open Championships and did so representing Seneca and that move paid off as she took first place at 110 thanks to a fall in 2:17 over Edwardsville’s Gianna Linhorst in the title match. Chuway won all five of her matches with pins, recording a fall in 2:18 over Stevenson’s Nastasia Kobets and then getting a pin in 1:32 over Burlington Central’s Ruby Vences.\n\nEdwardsville junior Gianna Linhorst, who also came up one victory shy of advancing to the IHSA Finals from the Richwoods Sectional after losing in both the semifinals and consolation semifinals to conclude a 26-11 season, was one of two Tigers who competed in the event and they both won medals. Linhorst opened with a fall and then won decisions in her next three matches, edging Metea Valley’s Janiya Moore 3-2 in the semifinals. In the third-place match, Geneseo’s Lydia King won by fall in 4:28 over Stevenson’s Nastasia Kobets. For fifth place, Metea Valley’s Janiya Moore got a pin in 2:50 over Burlington Central’s Ruby Vences. And in the seventh-place match, Reed-Custer senior Judith Gamboa, who finished in fifth place at 105 in 2023 at the IHSA Individual Finals, recorded a fall in 0:33 over Mascoutah’s Zoey Nelson.\n\n115 – Ava Beldo, Centennial\n\nLike so many others who competed in the IWCOA Girls state series, Ava Beldo lost in both the semifinals and consolation semifinals of a sectional to miss out on advancing to the IHSA Individual Finals in Bloomington by one win. Centennial freshman Beldo concluded a successful 32-12 debut season when she was unable to qualify from the Richwoods Sectional. Beldo, the Chargers’ lone competitor in the IWCOA Girls Open, recorded falls in all four of her matches. She won the 115 championship with a pin in 1:40 over Neuqua Valley’s Veronika Arabova after reaching the title mat with a fall in 1:35 over Edwardsville’s Alexandra Chong in the semifinals and another pin in 2:34 in the quarterfinals over Mt. Vernon’s Deziare Jones.\n\n“It was very hard to get to state,” Beldo said. “I got a bad pool in the bracket, but everything happens for a reason. And with God, you can do anything. I stumbled down, but coming back to state, I pulled myself back up and won the title and I’m proud of what I’ve done. I am very happy with how I did as a freshman. There’s a lot of good wrestlers at Centennial, and there’s a lot of good seniors that are leaving us like Trevor Schoonover and Ando Beldo, they were really good leaders. It was such a blessing to be able to win this state title as a freshman.”\n\nNeuqua Valley senior Veronika Arabova went 16-4 in her final season but came up one win shy of advancing from the Schaumburg Sectional. One of two medal winners and four individuals in the IWCOA Girls Open for the Wildcats, Arabova recorded four falls to reach the 115 title mat, getting a pin in the semifinals in 0:41 over Kankakee’s Taniyah Sherman, who went on to finish in third place after winning by fall in 3:53 over Edwardsville’s Alexandra Chong. For fifth place, West Aurora’s Lailonie Molina captured a 9-5 decision over Naperville Central’s Gracie Meluch. And in the seventh-place match, Civic Memorial’s Kendall Smith recorded a fall in 1:26 over Morris’ Makensi Martin.\n\n120 – Nina Hamm, Homewood-Flossmoor\n\nOne real good indicator of just how difficult it was for girls to advance to the IHSA Individual Finals this season was the fact that two state placewinners from a year ago won titles at the IWCOA Girls Open Championships in Springfield. One of those was Homewood-Flossmoor junior Nina Hamm, who took sixth place at 110 last season at the second IHSA Finals to cap a 31-14 season. Hamm lost in the consolation semifinals in sudden victory at the Evanston Township Sectional to fall one win shy of a trip to state and closed out this season with a 27-11 record. One of four Vikings qualifiers and their lone medalist, Hamm won the 120 title after capturing a 14-4 major decision over Kaneland’s Dyani Torres in the championship match. She opened with two falls, including one in 4:12 in the quarterfinals over Rock Falls’ Ryleigh Eriks before earning her spot on the title mat with a 9-7 win by sudden victory over J. Sterling Morton’s Monica Garcia in the semifinals.\n\n“There’s a lot of work to put in because this is such a physically exhausting sport,” Hamm said. “We didn’t really have consistent practices and also the girls that didn’t make it along the way kind of stopped coming to practice, which left me without a partner. And the part about making weight was huge, too, because with the whole week off, it was so hard to maintain your weight.”\n\nKaneland junior Dyani Torres, who lost in the semifinals of the Geneseo Sectional to eventual IHSA 120 champion Angelina Cassioppi and again the consolation semifinals to fall short of advancing to the IHSA Finals to end a 39-10 season, was one of two IWCOA medalists for the Knights, who made history this season by getting their first IHSA champion, freshman Angelina Gochis at 105. Torres got a fall in her first match, won a 4-2 decision over Fenton’s Giselle Castillo in the quarterfinals and earned her spot on the 120 title mat by getting a pin in 2:19 over Morris’ Danica Martin in the semifinals. In the third-place match, Fenton’s Giselle Castillo recorded a fall in 2:22 over Morris’ Danica Martin, For fifth place, Wheaton North’s Ryan Mark was a winner by medical forfeit over J. Sterling Morton’s Monica Garcia. And Rock Falls’ Ryleigh Eriks captured a 6-2 decision over Marion’s Alauni Muex to finish in seventh place.\n\n125 – Tierra Hardin, Proviso West\n\nLike so many others who had the misfortune of trying to claim one of the four qualifying spots at the rugged Schaumburg Sectional, Proviso West freshman Tierra Hardin bounced back from the disappointment of not being able to advance to the IHSA Individual Finals in an otherwise successful 25-5 season by winning the 125 title at the IWCOA Girls Open Championships when she captured a 9-5 decision over Addison Trail’s Brithany Mondragon. One of two individuals who competed for the Panthers and their lone medal winner, Hardin recorded falls in her first three matches, including one in 1:55 over Wilmington’s Ava Cupples in the quarterfinals before she captured a 10-2 major decision over Shepard’s Mila Rocush in the semifinals.\n\nAddison Trail sophomore Brithany Mondragon went 20-10 this season but was unable to even compete in the Schaumburg Sectional after failing to advance from the Conant Regional. So finishing in second place in the IWCOA Girls Open was obviously a great way to see her season conclude. She opened with a fall before capturing a 4-2 decision in the quarterfinals over J. Sterling Morton’s Sofia Petronijevic and earned her spot on the 125 title mat with a 2-0 decision over Durand’s Evie Anderson in the semifinals. For third place, Somonauk’s Rylie Donahue won a 9-4 decision over Shepard’s Mila Rocush. In the fifth-place match, J. Sterling Morton’s Sofia Petronijevic was a 6-1 victor over Durand’s Evie Anderson. And for seventh, Stevenson’s Karina Lojowski won by fall in 0:42 over Charleston’s Morgan Krone-Smallhorn.\n\n130 – Audrey Barnes, Granite City\n\nAudrey Barnesmade it 2-for-2 for Granite City as it became one of two teams with two title winners in the IWCOA Girls Open Championships, with Minooka the other, when Barnes won the 130 title by recording a fall in 3:42 over Shepard’s Stacey Massey to add to the earlier championship at 105 that was claimed by teammate Ma’Kayla Bonner. Barnes, a freshman who went 22-13 this season and fell one victory short of advancing to the IHSA Finals from the Richwoods Sectional, was one of three qualifiers and two champs for the Warriors. She got falls in her other three matches, including in 2:53 over Schaumburg’s Sharon Olorunfemi in the quarterfinals and in 2:41 over Glenwood’s Isabella Resendez in the semifinals.\n\nShepard senior Stacey Massey was the top finisher of her team’s 10 participants and three medalists with her second-place showing. She concluded her final season with a 19-8 record after being unable to advance to the IHSA Finals from the challenging Schaumburg Sectional. Massey opened with a 9-2 win before recording falls in her next two matches, winning in 1:36 over Batavia’s Anabelle Guthke in the quarterfinals and in 0:56 over O’Fallon’s Scarlett Gentille in the semifinals. In the third-place match, O’Fallon’s Scarlett Gentille won by fall in 0:40 over Glenwood’s Isabella Resendez. For fifth place, Ottawa Township’s Ava Weatherford got a pin in 2:57 over Schaumburg’s Sharon Olorunfemi. And in the seventh-place match, Glenbard East’s Maria Green captured a 7-6 decision over Lincoln-Way Central’s Eleanor Giertuga.\n\n135 – Brianna Bynum, Sherrard\n\nBrianna Bynum made history in 2022 when she finished sixth at 125 to become Sherrard’s first all-stater at the inaugural IHSA Individual Finals to highlight her sophomore season. As a senior, she was hoping to close her career with another state medal this season but came up one win shy of advancing from the Geneseo Sectional after falling in both the semifinals and consolation semifinals to finish with a 21-13 record. But the lone qualifier for the Tigers hoped to end things on a more positive note and she did just that by winning the 135 title at the IWCOA Girls Open Championships when she captured a 12-0 major decision over Geneseo’s Gia Ritter. Bynum won her other three matches by fall, getting a pin in 0:39 over Oswego’s Ameera Murphy in the quarterfinals and a win by fall in 1:43 over Buffalo Grove’s Christina Marogy in the semifinals.\n\n“I fell short (at the Geneseo Sectional) and I wasn’t going to come here, but my coach convinced me and I’m really happy that I did,” Bynum said. “I worked with the other girl that was on my team (Nadia Anderson), who went to IHSA State. I definitely made history for Sherrard and I’m very happy that I did. I first started wrestling when the first IHSA (tournament) came out, so the difference between then and now is huge. And everyone loves each other and they’re supportive and I really like the community.”\n\nGeneseo senior Gia Ritter also fell a bit short of advancing to the IHSA Finals from the sectional that her school hosted to close out her career with a 30-11 season. She was the best finisher among four medalists for the Maple Leafs, who tied Schaumburg for the most placewinners. Ritter earned her spot in the IWCOA Girls Open 135 title match with a 9-3 win over Batavia’s Amelia Howell in the semifinals. She opened with a fall and claimed a 9-0 major decision over Freeburg’s Aubrey Raban in the quarterfinals. In the third-place match, Buffalo Grove’s Christina Marogy prevailed 2-0 in sudden victory over Batavia’s Amelia Howell. For fifth place, Hillcrest’s Christiara Finley won by fall in 3:32 over East Aurora’s Britany Chavarria. And St. Joseph-Ogden’s Maddie Wells took seventh by claiming a 6-3 win over Oswego’s Ameera Murphy.\n\n140 – Alicia Swank, Bloomington\n\nAlicia Swank enjoyed winning the 140 title at the 2023 IWCOA Girls Open Championships in Springfield so the Bloomington sophomore decided to give it another try after falling a bit short of advancing to the IHSA Finals from the Geneseo Sectional when she lost in her final match to the eventual IWCOA 145 champion, Minooka’s Bella Cyrkiel, to conclude a 19-10 sophomore season. Swank, one of two qualifiers and the lone medalist for the Purple Raiders, won her second-straight title in the competition when she captured a 6-3 decision over Plainfield North’s Viktoriia Rodnikova in the 140 championship match. She won all of her other three matches by fall, getting a pin in 4:40 over St. Charles East’s Addison Wolf in the quarterfinals and winning by fall in 1:49 over Oak Park and River Forest’s Isabella Miller in the semifinals.\n\n“The sectional was really fun but my sectional was also really hard,” Swank said. “The two weeks gave us more time to get ready for it but it also had us in and out of it and I know that some girls had trouble making the weight. I remember last year when there were maybe six girls in my bracket and there’s 18 of us this year. I’ve seen girls for the past year or two, and then there are a bunch of freshmen who are coming up to high school and getting into it or some of the juniors and seniors who want to do something in their last years in high school.”\n\nPlainfield North freshman Viktoriia Rodnikova came up a bit short of qualifying for the IHSA Finals from the rugged Schaumburg Sectional to conclude a 21-4 debut season. The Tigers’ lone qualifier for the IWCOA Girls Open Championship, she recorded falls in her first three matches, winning in 1:50 in the quarterfinals over Hoffman Estates’ Liriana Rakoci before getting a pin in 4:14 in the semifinals over Normal West’s Vivian Guither. For third place, Vandalia’s Brynn Swyers captured a 17-5 major decision over Lincoln-Way Centrral’s Bailey Mitchell. In the fifth-place match, Normal West’s Vivian Guither recorded a fall in 3:44 over Oak Park and River Forest’s Isabella Miller. And for seventh place, St. Charles East’s Addison Wolf claimed an 8-6 decision over Hoffman Estates’ Liriana Rakoci.\n\n145 – Bella Cyrkiel, Minooka\n\nMinooka’s Bella Cyrkiel and Oswego’s Makayla Hill were well aware of each other since they\n\nmet for the Southwest Prairie Conference championship with senior Cyrkiel winning a 5-0 decision over freshman Hill in the 145 finals. The two faced off again at the IWCOA Girls Open Championships for the 145 title and Cyrkiel won another decision by five points, this time by a 6-1 score, to give the Indians two champions in the competition as Abbey Boersma, the Indians’ other qualifier, followed with a first-place finish at 155 in another matchup of SPC competitors. Cyrkiel, who also won the the 145 title at the IWCOA Girls Open Championships in 2023, went 36-6 this season after falling one win shy of a trip to the IHSA Finals from the Geneseo Sectional, was one of five individuals from her conference who won IWCOA titles as well as one of eight finalists and 12 medalists. She opened with three falls, winning in 0:57 over Hoffman Estates’ Nikki Hubbard in the quarterfinals before getting a pin in 1:57 over Lake Park’s Joscelin Ritthamel. With Granite City also having two champions, this was the first time since the initial Girls Open in 2017 that a school had two title winners and that two teams pulled off that feat.\n\n“I had a tough loss there, so this is part of my redemption coming back,” Cyrkiel said of her loss in the Geneseo Sectional. “We have great coaches and a great program and it keeps getting better and better. We have a lot of good competition and that helps us get better.”\n\nOswego freshman Makayla Hill came up a bit short of qualifying for a trip to the IHSA Finals at the Schaumburg Sectional as she closed out a 31-8 season. One of six qualifiers and the top-finisher of three medalists for the Panthers, Hill followed a pin with a 5-0 decision over Jersey Community’s Rory Speidel in the quarterfinals and then captured a 16-2 major decision over Unity’s Anna Vasey in the semifinals. In the third-place match, Metea Valley’s Alketa Picari won 4-2 by sudden victory over Lake Park’s Joscelin Ritthamel. For fifth place, Unity’s Anna Vasey won by fall in 4:07 over Woodstock’s Brianna Crown. And in the seventh-place match, Jersey Community’s Rory Speidel claimed a 2-1 decision over Chicago Marshall’s Cecilia Colon.\n\n155 – Abbey Boersma, Minooka\n\nOn a day where individuals from Southwest Prairie Conference schools captured five of the 15 titles, senior Abbey Boersma followed in the footsteps of her teammate and 145 champion Bella Cyrkiel to give Minooka two title winners in the IWCOA Girls Open Championships, which made it and Granite City the only schools in the competition with two champions. Boersma, who went 35-13 after falling one win shy of a trip to state from the Geneseo Sectional, which featured the two IHSA Finalists at her weight, was the only one of the five title winners from the SPC who didn’t also win conference. Like Cyrkiel, she faced an SPC opponent in the finals, where she won a 12-6 decision over Oswego East’s Jessica Stover. Boersma opened with a victory by technical fall before getting a pin in 0:55 over Wheeling’s Nikol Orendarchuk in the quarterfinals. She earned her spot on the 155 title mat with a 4-0 decision over Geneseo’s Madelyn Mooney.\n\n“I don’t like how our postseason was spread out with two weeks in between,” Boersma said. “I am so grateful for everything that I’ve gained from wrestling at Minooka. We have the best coaches and Paige Schoolman is the best.The sport has gotten so much tougher. I think it’s so cool seeing the little girls that are wrestling and I know that by the time that they’re my age, they’re going to be great because I only wrestled for two years.”\n\nOswego East junior Jessica Stover failed to advance from the Shepard Regional and finished with a 21-7 record. One of two participants in the IWCOA Girls Open and the lone medalist for the Wolves, Stover recorded falls in her first three matches, which included one in 4:21 in the quarterfinals against another individual from her conference, Plainfield East’s Kaitlyn Bucholz, before earning her spot on the 155 title match with a 6-2 decision over Larkin’s Zamaya Taylor, who lost by fall in 3:39 in the third-place match to Geneseo’s Madelyn Mooney. For fifth place, Oak Park and River Forest’s Caliyah Campbell got a pin in 2:30 over Mt. Vernon’s Derika Gradford and in the seventh-place match, two more SPC competitors squared off with Oswego’s Kyiah Chavez getting a fall in 1:30 over Joliet Township’s Noelie Perez-Bedolla.\n\n170 – Sabrina Cargill, Palatine\n\nSabrina Cargill advanced to the challenging Schaumburg Sectional but was unable to compete in it and finished her junior season with a 24-5 record. So it’s understandable that her title win at 170 in the IWCOA Girls Open Championships was a good way to close things out and she took top honors in impressive fashion, winning all four of her matches by fall, recording a pin in 1:45 over Bloom Township’s Kinnidi Riley for the championship. One of five IWCOA individuals from her team who competed and one of two finalists for the Pirates, Cargill recorded a pin in 1:38 in the quarterfinals over Richwoods’ Sydney Johnson and then earned her spot on the 170 title match after getting a fall in 0:39 over Lake Park’s Paige Washburn in the semifinals.\n\n“I think that I really improved from last year,” Cargill said. “I qualified for IHSA state last year but I didn’t place. The sport is growing so big now and there’s a lot of experience so you really have to buckle up. It’s really surprising that there are a lot of girls that are joining the sport because boys dominated, so it’s good since it shows that women can do any sport that they want. What I like the most about girls wrestling is win or lose, we’re all there for each other. No matter if we’re on a different team, we’re always cheering each other on and saying hi to each other and giving hugs. I see that most boys don’t do that, they’re all too serious. We kind of have a twist to it that makes it serious, but fun at the same time.”\n\nBloom Township junior Kinnidi Riley didn’t take part in the IHSA girls state series, instead she competed with the boys co-op team for Bloom and Bloom Trail in the Class 3A Rich Township Regional. So it was a big deal that a member of the Blazing Trojans was able to compete for an IWCOA Girls Open Championships title at 170. One of three qualifiers and the lone medalist for Bloom Township, Riley opened with a fall and then won two close decisions, claiming a 9-7 win over Schaumburg’s Alya Razzak in the quarterfinals and edging Urbana’s Franciana Kalanga 1-0 in the semifinals. In the third-place match, Schaumburg’s Alya Razzak got past Richwoods’ Sydney Johnson 2-1 and for fifth, Lake Park’s Paige Washburn claimed a 6-1 decision over Urbana’s Franciana Kalanga. In the seventh-place match, Conant’s Anaelise Aberman won by fall in 4:16 over Batavia’s Caoimhe Mitchell, whose Bulldogs placed third at the IHSA Finals.\n\n190 – Brittney Moran, West Aurora\n\nAfter placing sixth the past two seasons at 190 in the IHSA Individual Finals, West Aurora’s Brittney Moran was sick while competing in the Schaumburg Sectional, which thwarted her attempt to try to get back to state for the third time and also become one of the 20 individuals who were the first three-time medalists in the tournament. So the junior, who went 28-3 this season with two of her losses coming at the sectional, decided to close out her season on a more positive note and she did that by winning the IWCOA Girls Open Championships at 190 when she recorded a fall in 1:42 over Fremd’s Jazz Ocampo. One of three individuals who competed in the event and the best finisher among two medalists for the Blackhawks, Moran won all three of her matches with pins, needing 0:56 to beat Highland’s Sophia Elkins in the quarterfinals and won in 2:45 in the semifinals over Schaumburg’s Nadia Razzak, who ended her season at the Schaumburg Sectional and denied her of a third trip to the IHSA Finals.\n\n“It was difficult,” Moran said. “I got sick and everything and I didn’t wrestle my best (at the sectional). This actually kind of helps me a little because I beat one of the girls that beat me. This year was difficult, for sure, but I honestly feel like that’s a good thing because the sport is growing. I just wish that they would separate from the guys’ teams to just the girls and they should add classes, too.”\n\nFremd junior Jazz Ocampo went 24-12 this season and finished one win shy of a state trip from the Schaumburg Sectional. Ocampo, the only qualifier for the Vikings, won narrow decisions in her first two matches, prevailing 5-2 over Robinson’s Shyiema Poole in the quarterfinals and edging Kaneland’s Sadie Kinsella 2-1 in the semifinals to earn her spot on the 190 title mat. Schaumburg’s Nadia Razzak took third place after winning by fall in 2:08 over Kaneland’s Sadie Kinsella. For fifth place, Robinson’s Khyiema Poole recorded a pin in 1:19 over Maine East’s Angelica Wszolek. And for seventh place, Rickover Naval Academy’s Julia Augello won by fall in 2:16 over Highland’s Sophia Elkins.\n\n235 – Jasmine Enriquez, Sycamore\n\nAfter falling just short against the eventual IHSA 235 champion, Prairie Central’s Chloe Hoselton, in the consolation semifinals of the Geneseo Sectional, Sycamore’s Jasmine Enriquez wanted to show that she could also finish on top of the awards stand when she was able to compete again at the IWCOA Girls Open Championships, and that’s just what she did by winning the 235 title by fall in 1:55 over Palatine’s Monika Irazoque. Enriquez, a freshman who went 6-5 this season and was the lone entrant for the Spartans, won her other two matches with pins, recording one in 1:26 over Shepard’s Kassandra Lee in the quarterfinals and earning her spot on the 235 title mat with a fall in 3:56 over Fenton’s Ariana Solideo.\n\nPalatine freshman Monika Irazoque, who failed to advance from the Conant Regional in the IHSA series, was a real success story for the IWCOA Girls Open Championships since she won twice in Springfield, which was how many wins she had after going 0-2 in the regional. She recorded a fall in 2:08 over Geneseo’s Aislan Leetch in the quarterfinals and joined 170 champion Sabrina Cargill as a finalist for the Pirates after getting a pin in 0:27 over Maine East’s Lyric Walton, who went on to finish in third place following her win by fall in 1:49 over Glenbard North’s Asreilla Wallace. In the fifth place match, Fenton’s Ariana Solideo recorded a pin in 2:35 over Wheaton North’s Iana Victory. And for seventh place, Geneseo’s Aislan Leetch was a winner by fall in 1:51 over Shepard’s Kassandra Lee.\n\nChampionship matches\n\n95 – Daniela Santander (Romeoville) won by fall over LT Diephuis (Canton) Fall 4:07\n\n100 – Diamond Rodriguez (Dundee-Crown) won by fall over Giselle Arambula (Curie Metropolitan) Fall 0:41\n\n105 – Ma`Kayla Bonner (Granite City) won in sudden victory over Lilliana Aly (Wauconda) SV 6-4\n\n110 – Courtni Chuway (Seneca) won by fall over Gianna Linhorst (Edwardsville) Fall 2:17\n\n115 – Ava Beldo (Centennial) won by fall over Veronika Arabova (Neuqua Valley) Fall 1:40\n\n120 – Nina Hamm (Homewood-Flossmoor) won by major decision over Dyani Torres (Kaneland) Maj 14-4\n\n125 – Tierra Hardin (Proviso West) won by decision over Brithany Mondragon (Addison Trail) Dec 9-5\n\n130 – Audrey Barnes (Granite City) won by fall over Stacey Massey (Shepard) Fall 3:42\n\n135 – Brianna Bynum (Sherrard) won by major decision over Gia Ritter (Geneseo) Maj 12-0\n\n140 – Alicia Swank (Bloomington) won by decision over Viktoriia Rodnikova (Plainfield North) Dec 6-3\n\n145 – Bella Cyrkiel (Minooka) won by decision over Makayla Hill (Oswego) Dec 6-1\n\n155 – Abbey Boersma (Minooka) won by decision over Jessica Stover (Oswego East) Dec 12-6\n\n170 – Sabrina Cargill (Palatine) won by fall over Kinnidi Riley (Bloom Township) Fall 1:45\n\n190 – Brittney Moran (West Aurora) won by fall over Jazz Ocampo (Fremd) Fall 1:42\n\n235 – Jasmine Enriquez (Sycamore) won by fall over Monika Irazoque (Palatine) Fall 1:55\n\nThird-Place Matches\n\n95 – Claire Crouch (Triad) won by fall over Annika Hull (Naperville Central) Fall 2:49\n\n100 – Norah Vick (Sandwich) won by decision over Aerith Adams (Dunlap) Dec 7-2\n\n105 – Kimani Glasper (Westinghouse) won by decision over Justice Girod (Schaumburg) Dec 8-3\n\n110 – Lydia King (Geneseo) won by fall over Nastasia Kobets (Stevenson) Fall 4:28\n\n115 – Taniyah Sherman (Kankakee) won by fall over Alexandra Chong (Edwardsville) Fall 3:53\n\n120 – Giselle Castillo (Fenton) won by fall over Danica Martin (Morris) Fall 2:22\n\n125 – Rylie Donahue (Somonauk) won by decision over Mila Rocush (Shepard) Dec 9-4\n\n130 – Scarlett Gentille (O`Fallon) won by fall over Isabella `Izzy` Resendez (Glenwood) Fall 0:40\n\n135 – Christina Marogy (Buffalo Grove) won in sudden victory over Amelia Howell (Batavia) SV 2-0\n\n140 – Brynn Swyers (Vandalia) won by major decision over Bailey Mitchell (Lincoln-Way Central) Maj 17-5\n\n145 – Alketa Picari (Metea Valley) won in sudden victory over Joscelin Ritthamel (Lake Park) SV 4-2\n\n155 – Madelyn Mooney (Geneseo) won by fall over Zamaya Taylor (Larkin) Fall 3:39\n\n170 – Alya Razzak (Schaumburg) won by decision over Sydney Johnson (Richwoods) Dec 2-1\n\n190 – Nadia Razzak (Schaumburg) won by fall over Sadie Kinsella (Kaneland) Fall 2:08\n\n235 – Lyric Walton (Maine East) won by fall over Asreilla Wallace (Glenbard North) Fall 1:49\n\nFifth-Place Matches\n\n95 – Izzy Paz (Wheaton North) won by decision over Abella Brown (East Peoria) Dec 6-4\n\n100 – Emily Peyton (Lincoln-Way Central) won by fall over Shayla Schielein (Canton) Fall 1:43\n\n105 – Ashley Hammond (Larkin) won by major decision over Carlly Ho (Rochester) Maj 13-0\n\n110 – Janiya Moore (Metea Valley) won by fall over Ruby Vences (Burlington Central) Fall 2:50\n\n115 – Lailonie Molina (West Aurora) won by decision over Gracie Meluch (Naperville Central) Dec 9-5\n\n120 – Ryan Mark (Wheaton North) won by medical forfeit over Monica Garcia (J.

Eleven of the title winners were sophomores and four were freshmen.\n\nNormal Community’s Jackson Soney won the competition for the second time when he took top honors at 101. Other sophomores who captured titles were Hononegah’s Jackson Olson (106), Morton’s Harrison Dea (113), Glenbard East’s Ismael Chaidez (120), Lockport Township’s Isaac Zimmerman (126), Morris’ Carter Skoff (132), Lincoln-Way Central’s Jalen Byrd (144), Hersey’s Frank Tagoe (150), Marmion Academy’s Vincenzo Testa (175), Dundee-Crown’s Teigen Moreno (215) and Lincoln-Way East’s Ryan Stingily (285).\n\nFreshmen champions were Barrington’s Danel Blanke (138), Marian Central Catholic’s Nic Astacio (157), Grant’s Aaden Arroyo (165) and Harvard’s Blake Livdahl (190).\n\nSophomores who finished second were Stevenson’s Evan Mishels (106), Yorkville’s Liam Fenoglio (113), Jacobs’ Ben Arbotante (120), Shelbyville’s Bodee Fathauer (126), Homewood-Flossmoor’s Robye Williams (132), Downers Grove North’s Caden Chiarelli (138), Normal Community’s Carter Mayes (144) and Grayslake Central’s Warren Nash III (150).\n\nOther sophomores who took second were Hampshire’s Michael Brannigan (157), Unity’s Abram Davidson (165), Rolling Meadows’ John Rappa (175), Springfield Southeast’s Christopher Hull (190), Marist’s Tommy O’Brien (215) and Barrington’s Clarence Jackson (285). The lone freshman who finished second was IC Catholic Prep’s Dominic Pasquale (101).\n\nOne champion, Arroyo, and one runner-up, Nash III, finished fourth in their regionals and didn’t advance to the sectional. Two finalists who didn’t compete in the IHSA state series were champion Stingily and runner-up Mayes. And Dea was the lone champion who placed last season at the IHSA Individual Finals, taking fifth place at 106 in Class 2A.\n\nBeside Soney (first at 101 in 2023), the other individual who competed in a title match for the second time was Zimmerman (second at 106 in 2023). Other champions who placed in last year’s IWCOA Frosh/Soph State Finals were Stingily (fourth at 285), Chaidez (sixth at 113), Brannigan (eighth at 152), Moreno (eighth at 220) and Olson (eighth at 106).\n\nSoney led all competitors with 34 team points while Blanke, Byrd and Moreno scored 32 points and Dea collected 31 team points. Chaidez, Skoff and Testa had 30 team points. Arroyo and Zimmerman each scored 29.5 team points, Astacio had 28.5 points while Brannigan, Hull and Livdahl collected 28 team points and Olson and Williams finished with 27.5 points.\n\nYorkville’s Caleb Viscogliosi and Soney both recorded five falls, with the latter needing 7:37 to pull that off. Maine South’s Jake Colleran led all entrants by scoring 71 match points while Naperville Central’s Vince Bern had 68 match points and Plainfield North’s Aidan DuRell finished with 65 match points.\n\nMarist led the way with 241 match points while Lockport Township was second with 209 and St. Charles East ranked third with 191 match points. Maris recorded the most falls with 13 while Lincoln-Way Central and Moline both collected nine pins.\n\nPrograms with the most qualifiers for the Frosh/Soph State Finals were Marist (16), Lockport Township (10), Grant (7), Lincoln-Way East (7), Maine South (7), St. Charles East (7), Shepard (7), Carl Sandburg (6), Glenbard West (6), Lincoln-Way Central (6), Lincoln-Way West (6), Moline (6), Downers Grove South (5), Edwardsville (5), Evanston Township (5), Glenbrook South (5), Joliet Catholic Academy (5), Normal Community (5) and Washington Community (5).\n\nHere’s a look at the 15 champions and their weight classes at the Illinois Wrestling Coaches and Officials Association’s Freshman/Sophomore State Championships:\n\n101 – Jackson Soney, Normal Community\n\nLast season, Jackson Soney wasn’t able to compete much with Class 3A fifth-place finisher and 51-match winner Caden Correll at 106, so he entered the IWCOA Frosh/Soph State Finals and beat Washington Community’s Symon Woods to win the title at 101. After going 40-4 this season and not being able to qualify at 113 at the Quincy Senior Sectional, the Normal Community sophomore again took part in the Frosh/Soph Tournament and won once again at 101 after recording a fall in 0:24 over IC Catholic Prep’s Dominic Pasquale. He was one of two finalists and medal winners among five qualifiers for the Ironmen, with 144 runner-up Carter Mayes being the other placewinner. Soney won all five of his matches by fall, with the first two also ending in the opening period before winning in 2:45 over St. Charles East’s Kaden Potter in the quarterfinals and in 2:31 over Niles Notre Dame’s Ray Long in the semifinals. Soney won by fall against all of the opponents that he faced in the IWCOA regional and sectional tournaments.\n\n“I won this tournament last year,” Soney said. “Obviously I wish that I could have placed at the IHSA but this is the next best thing, that’s what my parents and coaches tell me. They always say to get the next best thing and this is the next best thing that I could get. This one was different because I pinned everyone in the regionals, sectionals and state. It does light the fire in me. I’m very excited about this tournament and about how I performed and I’m excited for next season, as well. I put in my work during the offseason and lifted more. And I focused more on what my weak points were. All of the training and everything that I’ve done has helped a lot.”\n\nIC Catholic Prep freshman Dominic Pasquale, who went 24-16 and fell a bit short of advancing to state from the Class 2A Grayslake Central Sectional, used two falls and two wins by ultimate tiebreaker to reach the title mat, winning 7-5 on an ultimate tiebreaker over St. Patrick’s Jack Koening in the semifinals. In the third-place match, Marist’s Dylan Weber won a 10-2 major decision over St. Charles East’s Kaden Potter. For fifth place, Niles Notre Dame’s Ray Long captured a 14-4 major decision over St. Patrick’s Jack Koenig. And in the seventh-place match, Marmion Academy’s Colton Wyller captured a 4-2 decision over Andrew’s Gerald Donnelly.\n\n106 – Jackson Olson, Hononegah\n\nJackson Olson got to experience a lot of positive things during his sophomore season at Hononegah. He qualified for the Class 3A Barrington Sectional, claimed a win in his final match while competing with his team that advanced to the IHSA Dual Team Finals for the first time since 2016 and had four teammates who placed third or better at the IHSA Individual Finals who all figure to be back next season. With a lot of positives happening in his program, Olson, who went 19-13 this season, seems well-positioned to be a state qualifier or medalist in the future after winning the IWCOA Frosh/Soph State title at 106 with an 8-3 decision over Stevenson’s Evan Mishels. The Indians’ lone qualifier for the tournament opened with a 2-0 decision but then won a major decision and got a win by technical fall over Proviso West’s Andre Rice in the quarterfinals, before winning 11-0 over Montini Catholic’s Bobby Ruscitti in the semifinals. This was the second medal that Olson won in the event after placing eighth at 106 last season.\n\nStevenson sophomore Evan Mishels, one of two qualifiers and medalists for the Patriots, won his first three matches, which were all close decisions. Mishels, who went 35-16 this season and fell one win shy of advancing to state from the Class 3A Barrington Sectional, earned his spot on the 106 title mat by capturing a 3-0 victory over St. Charles North’s Declan Sons in the semifinals. Montini Catholic’s Bobby Ruscitti recorded a fall in 2:11 over Schaumburg’s Austin Phelps in the third-place match. Burlington Central’s Jackson Marlett captured a 2-1 decision over St. Charles North’s Declan Sons to finish in fifth place and Proviso West’s Andre Rice won a 10-9 decision over Joliet Catholic Academy’s Matthew Laird to claim seventh place.\n\n113 – Harrison Dea, Morton\n\nWhen a freshman is fortunate to not only qualify for the Individual State Finals but to place there but then falls just short of another trip to Champaign the following year, it can be disappointing. That’s what happened to Morton sophomore Harrison Dea, who went 37-11 last season and took fifth place in Class 2A at 106 but then lost in the semifinals of the Class 2A Sycamore Sectional and also the consolation semifinals to finish 29-7 this year. One of two Potters who advanced to the IWCOA Frosh/Soph Finals and placed, with Colton McKee (fifth at 165), the other, Dea took first place at 113 after capturing a 5-4 decision over Yorkville’s Liam Fenoglio in the championship match. Dea opened with three-consecutive falls, winning in 0:46 in the quarterfinals over Fremd’s Trentin Odachowski and then he claimed a 12-0 major decision over Naperville Central’s Jacob Cochran in the semifinals.\n\n“I had a really rough sectional,” Dea said of the Class 2A Sycamore Sectional. “In my semifinal match, I was up until the last 10 seconds against Geneseo’s Tim Sebastian and then I had to turn back around and wrestle my blood-round match and I was up 6-0 and I got caught in a cradle. It was really a heart break, but as soon as that happened, I just focused on what was next and just kept moving and kept pushing forward and I went back in the room and trained hard and now I’m standing on top of the podium. In my freshman year I took fifth at IHSA state, Then when I came back, I was up a weight class and I had to learn to wrestle a different style because the kids from 106 to 113 are definitely stronger.”\n\nYorkville sophomore Liam Fenoglio went 27-20 this season and got the opportunity to compete in the IHSA Dual Team Finals for the Class 3A runner-up Foxes, where he went 2-1. Fenoglio, one of three qualifiers and two medal winners for Yorkville, claimed a 6-4 decision over Carl Sandburg’s Oscar Kalman in the quarterfinals and then captured a 12-4 major decision in the semifinals over Morris’ Brock Claypool, who took third place with an 8-7 decision over Maine South’s Brett Harman. In the fifth-place match, Naperville Central’s Jacob Cochran won by fall in 3:00 over Crystal Lake Central’s Dylan Ramsey and Fremd’s Trentin Odachowski claimed seventh place by medical forfeit over Carl Sandburg’s Oscar Kalman.\n\n120 – Ismael Chaidez, Glenbard East\n\nWhen someone reaches the semifinals of one of the state’s toughest sectionals but then fails to advance to the IHSA Individual Finals, it can be disheartening. Someone who certainly can understand that dejection is Glenbard East sophomore Ismael Chaidez, who won his first two matches at 126 in the Class 3A Hinsdale Central Sectional only to run into Mount Carmel’s Seth Mendoza, who claimed his third-straight state championship one week later. A subsequent 7-6 consolation semifinal loss ended his 37-8 season. The Rams’ lone qualifier for the IWCOA Frosh/Soph State Finals, Chaidez captured a 5-1 decision over Jacobs’ Ben Arbotante to win the 120 title. He opened with three falls, winning in 3:43 over Lincoln-Way West’s Carter DiBenedetto in the quarterfinals before claiming a 3-0 victory over Oswego’s Aiden Ortiz to earn his spot in the 120 championship match. Chaidez also participated in the IWCOA Frosh/Soph State Finals last season and claimed a sixth-place finish at 113.\n\nJacobs sophomore Ben Arbotante, who fell short of earning a trip to state at the Class 3A Barrington Sectional to finish 29-13, was one of three medalists out of four qualifiers for the IWCOA Frosh/Soph State Finals for the Golden Eagles. He won his first match by technical fall before capturing three-straight decisions, which included a 4-2 victory over Olympia’s Austin Kisner in the quarterfinals and a 5-4 win in the semifinals over Triad’s Glen Henry, who took third place with a 6-3 decision over Batavia’s Kyle Pasco. In the fifth-place match, Oswego’s Aiden Ortiz won 6-5 by ultimate tiebreaker over Plainfield North’s Aidan DuRell. For seventh place, Olympia’s Austin Kisner won a 5-1 decision over Oakwood/Salt Fork’s Tyler Huchel.\n\n126 – Isaac Zimmerman, Lockport Township\n\nLockport Township’s Isaac Zimmerman won 34 matches as a freshman and then went 33-14 this season but for the second year in a row, he fell one win shy of advancing to the IHSA Individual Finals, after reaching the semifinals and consolation semifinals at the Class 3A Quincy Senior Sectional. After taking second at 106 to Mount Carmel’s Kavel Moore in last year’s IWCOA Frosh/Soph State Finals, he would now like to get medals the next two seasons at the IHSA Finals. Zimmerman, one of 10 Porters who qualified for and three who claimed medals at the IWCOA Frosh/Soph State Finals, won the championship at 126 by recording a fall in 3:45 over Shelbyville’s Bodee Fathauer. He earned his spot on the title mat\\ with a win by technical fall over Bremen’s Izaiah Gonzalez. After opening with a fall, he won two decisions, which included a 13-12 victory over Mascoutah’s Desi Wade in the quarterfinals.\n\n“Jameson Oster became our new coach last year and took over for Josh Oster,” said Zinmerman, who wanted to thank all of the Porters’ assistant coaches, Josh Zimmerman, Dan Swan, Mike Mucha, Rob Melgoza, Colin Holler, Josh Oster, Doug Chesna, Jim Ranney, Dave Mackey and Ron Farina. “The coaching staff has been great. My brother, Liam, who’s a junior, got to coach me in the Frosh/Soph and my dad has been coaching me since I was like five. We have a newer coach, Mike Mucha, and Abdullah (Assaf) didn’t coach that much this year, but he’s still one of my favorite coaches. In our room, we have Justin (Wardlow), who took second again, and I know that’s not what he was shooting for, but he’s really, really good. I don’t wrestle my brother often, but my brother also wrestles everybody else, so I get to wrestle everybody else, too. Iron sharpens iron, so everybody gets better.”\n\nShelbyville sophomore Bodee Fathauer went 30-16 this season and also advanced to the semifinals and consolation semifinals at his sectional, Class 1A Vandalia, to fall one win shy of a trip to Champaign. The lone IWCOA Frosh/Soph qualifier for the Rams, he followed a major decision and a pin with a 9-7 win by sudden victory over Joliet Catholic Academy’s Aurelio Munoz in the quarterfinals before recording a fall in 4:30 over Deerfield’s Adrian Cohen in the semifinals.In the third-place match, Naperville Central’s Vince Bern won a 10-5 decision over Bremen’s Izaiah Gonzalez. For fifth place, Joliet Catholic Academy’s Aurelio Munoz captured a 4-2 decision over Deerfield’s Adrian Cohen and in the seventh-place match, St. Charles East’s Gavin Woodmancy was a winner by medical forfeit over Stevenson’s Mikey Polyakov.\n\n132 – Carter Skoff, Morris\n\nCarter Skoff was one of four individuals from Morris that entered the Class 2A Sycamore Sectional with over 30 or more wins but only one of them was able to advance to state, Owen Sater, who won the sectional title at 106. So Skoff, a sophomore who went 35-8 this season, opted to compete in the IWCOA Frosh/Soph State Finals for the second time. He split four matches at last year’s tournament but this time his showing was much improved as he won all five of his matches, which included two falls and two major decisions before capturing a 9-8 decision over Homewood-Flossmoor’s Robye Williams in the 132 title match. Skoff, one of two medalists for Morris, got a major decision in his opener and a pin after that before winning another major decision, this time 11-3 over Granite City’s Braxton Tolley in the quarterfinals and added a second fall, in 1:33, over Lincoln-Way Central’s Jadon Zimmer in the semifinals.\n\nHomewood-Flossmoor sophomore Robye Williams (14-9) came up one victory away from a trip to state on two occasions at the Class 3A Quincy Senior Sectional after falling in the semifinals and the consolation semifinals. Williams, who also took part in last year’s Frosh/Soph State Finals and fell a bit short of getting a medal, opened with two falls and then got a win by technical fall over Fenwick’s Burke Burns in the quarterfinals and claimed a win by fall in 3:48 over West Aurora’s Jack Platt. In the third-place match, Maine South’s Jake Colleran captured an 8-3 decision over Glenbard West’s Alejandro Aranda. For fifth place, Lincoln-Way Central’s Jadon Zimmer won a 5-1 decision over West Aurora’s Jack Platt. And in the seventh-place match, Granite City’s Braxton Tolley prevailed by an ultimate tiebreaker over Hoopeston Area’s Aiden Bell.\n\n138 – Daniel Blanke, Barrington\n\nConsidering how hard it is for experienced individuals to qualify for state, most freshmen might be content if they fell just one win shy of advancing in their first attempt. While Daniel Blanke did just that at his own Class 3A Barrington Sectional to conclude a 26-12 season, the Broncos freshman wanted to finish on a better note and he accomplished that by winning the 138 title in the IWCOA Frosh/Soph State Finals by getting a fall in 2:14 over Downers Grove North’s\n\nCaden Chiarelli. One of two qualifiers for the Broncos, with Clarence Jackson also getting to the title match at 285 and taking second, Blanke won four of his five matches by fall, including the first three. He got a pin in 2:54 over Lincoln-Way Central’s Ethan Harvey in the quarterfinals and reached the title mat by capturing a 7-3 decision over Sandwich’s Ian Hawkins in the semifinals.\n\n“I did pretty well, but I didn’t qualify for state, which was a bummer,” Blanke said. “We have coach (Dan) Keller, and he’s a great coach and we’ve got a bunch of studs in our room. This makes me feel a lot better. And I’m definitely going to aim for being a medalist next year.”\n\nDowners Grove North sophomore Caden Chiarelli also fell one win shy of a state trip at the Class 3A Hinsdale Central Sectional after losing in both the semifinals and consolation semifinals to conclude a 26-18 season. Chiarelli, one of two Trojans to qualify for the Frosh/Soph State Finals and their lone medalist, opened with a fall and then won three-straight close decisions, claiming a 1-0 victory over Maine South’s Caden Ljubenko in the quarterfinals and prevailing 5-3 in sudden victory over Geneseo’s Grady Hull in the semifinals. In the third-place match, Sandwich’s Ian Hawkins claimed a 5-0 decision over Geneseo’s Grady Hull. For fifth place, Quincy Senior’s Cale Mixer got a fall in 2:47 over Maine South’s Caden Ljubenko. And in the seventh-place match, Lincoln-Way Central’s Ethan Harvey won 6-2 over Lockport Township’s Christian Czerwinski.\n\n144 – Jalen Byrd, Lincoln-Way Central\n\nWhen you’re the son of an IWCOA Hall of Fame wrestler, who also happens to be your head coach, trying to follow in your father’s footsteps is a typical goal. And if Lincoln-Way Central sophomore Jalen Byrd is able to achieve just a fraction of what his father Tyrone, a 2020 IWCOA Hall of Fame inductee, accomplished first at Clinton and later at the University of Illinois, then he too will have a successful career. Coming up a bit short of a state trip at the Class 3A Quincy Senior Sectional to conclude a 22-6 season after finishing with 39 victories and falling one win shy of advancing to state a year ago, Byrd led the Knights’ six qualifiers and three medalists at the IWCOA Frosh/Soph State Finals when he won the 144 title with a fall in 2:12 over Normal Community’s Carter Mayes. He also had pins in his first three matches, which was capped by a fall in 2:33 over Prospect’s Bennett Westfallen in the quarterfinals and then he captured a 7-0 decision over DeKalb’s Cam Matthews in the semifinals.\n\n“Sometimes it’s tough mentally and physically, and other times you get a lot of a reward out of it,” Byrd said of being able to compete for his father. “The work that he puts me through helps me to perform at my best. This year, I got hurt pretty early on in the season and came back, but I didn’t do too well at sectionals. But I came here and finished out the season with a good win. We’ve got a young team, too, and we’ll have two seniors next year, and that’s it. This will help me to get better so that I can get on the podium next year, that’s the biggest goal now, and on top of that is the best goal, to win that state title.”\n\nNormal Community sophomore Carter Mayes was 31-10 after his team won the title at the Big 12 Conference Tournament but he didn’t compete in the IHSA state series. He was one of five qualifiers and two finalists and medalists at the IWCOA Frosh/Soph State Finals for the Ironmen, with 101 champion Jackson Soney the other. Mayes opened with two falls and then won an 18-4 major decision over Alton Senior’s Brayden Drew before winning 7-0 over Oswego’s Dillon Griffin in the semifinals. In the third-place match, York’s Jackson Hanselman won a 3-0 decision over Alton Senior’s Brayden Drew. For fifth place, Oswego’s Dillon Griffin captured a 6-4 victory over DeKalb’s Cam Matthews. And in the seventh-place match, Lockport Township’s Naseem Jaber claimed a 6-4 decision over Prospect’s Bennett Westfallen.\n\n150 – Frank Tagoe, Hersey\n\nFrank Tagoe got the opportunity to be on a special team in his sophomore season as Hersey qualified 12 individuals, including eight seniors, for the Class 3A Barrington Sectional and advanced six to the IHSA Individual Finals, where two were All-Staters. While Tagoe came up a bit short of joining his teammates in Champaign and finished with a 17-13 record, he did get to end things on a high note after taking first place at the IWCOA Frosh/Soph State Finals when he won a 7-0 decision over Grayslake Central’s Warren Nash III in the 150 title match. One of two qualifiers and the lone medalist for the Huskies, he had one fall and three other decisions. In the quarterfinals, he won 4-1 over Robinson’s Benjamin Mullins and he earned his spot on the title mat with an 8-7 victory over Evanston Township’s Rodrigo Salinas in the semifinals.\n\n“I just have to keep putting that work in and hopefully I get there,” Tagoe said. “Everyone in our room has a common goal and when you have people in a room like we have, everyone just pushes each other every day to get better, and it’s the same with the coaching staff.”\n\nGrayslake Central sophomore Warren Nash III is one of the success stories of those who advanced to a title match at the IWCOA Frosh/Soph State Finals since he failed to qualify for the Class 2A sectional that his school hosted after taking fourth at the Antioch Regional to conclude a 32-17 season. Nash III, the lone medalist of the Rams’ four qualifiers, opened with two major decisions before winning 8-6 by sudden victory over New Trier’s Yassin Aitzemkour in the quarterfinals and then he recorded a fall in 3:57 over Wheaton Academy’s Tyler Jones in the semifinals. In the third-place match, East St. Louis Senior’s Pierre Walton was a winner by fall in 4:28 over Wheaton Academy’s Tyler Jones. For fifth place, Robinson’s Benjamin Mullins captured a 6-3 decision over Evanston Township’s Rodrigo Salinas and for seventh-place, Warren Township’s Nicholas Hermsen got a fall in 4:54 over Woodstock’s Logan Wisner.\n\n157 – Nic Astacio, Marian Central Catholic\n\nThings couldn’t have gone much better for Nic Astacio during his freshman season at Marian Central Catholic since he not only had the chance to compete along with his senior brother Max, but he got the rare opportunity as a freshman to be a major contributor for a team that won the IHSA Class 1A Dual Team champion to claim its first title and the Woodstock school won its first title in a boys sport since 1989. He fell one win shy of joining eight of his Hurricanes teammates as state qualifiers at the rugged Class 1A Byron Sectional but then went 2-1 in at the IHSA Dual Team finals to finish 32-25 for the season and he helped Marian Central Catholic beat defending champion Coal City 34-27 in the championship dual meet. Astacio, the only qualifier from his school, won the IWCOA Frosh/Soph title at 157 by recording a fall in 2:01 over Hampshire’s Michael Brannigan. He opened with a win by technical fall before capturing a 4-1 victory. He followed that with a 5-1 decision over Washington Community’s Cruise Brolley and then won a 12-2 major decision over Downers Grove South’s Noah Greene in the semifinals.\n\n“That was the best training that I could get,” said Astacio of wrestling against his senior brother, Max, who overcame injuries to take sixth at 165 in Class 1A to capture his second state medal. “I practiced with Max almost every single day in the wrestling room. He’s a senior and he’s been in this way longer than me. He’s the best mentor, and in fact, he was my coach these past two weeks. And everything that I’ve learned is from my father, Mario. It certainly was one helluva team. I have some of the best coaches that I could ask for. There’s a bright future for Marian Central, for sure. There’s a lot of kids who would wish to be in my spot and I just couldn’t be more grateful to be here. The main thing that I take away from this is the state championship. I’ve learned so much this freshman year. I’ve learned how to high school wrestle.”\n\nHampshire sophomore Michael Brannigan also fell a bit short of earning a state trip at the Class 3A Barrington Sectional and finished with a 30-15 record. One of three qualifiers and two medal winners for the Whip-Purs in the IWCOA Frosh/Soph State Finals, Brannigan recorded falls in his other four matches, including in 3:26 in the quarterfinals over Galesburg’s Anthony Makwala and in 3:21 over Moline’s Deanthony Simpson in the semifinals. In the third-place match, Lincoln-Way East’s Declan Dircks won with a pin in 2:39 over Marquette Academy’s Reily Leifheit. For fifth place, Moline’s Deanthony Simpson captured a 5-3 decision over Downers Grove South’s Noah Greene. And in the seventh-place match, Libertyville’s James Scanio won 4-2 in sudden victory over Washington Community’s Cruise Brolley.\n\n165 – Aaden Arroyo, Grant\n\nWhen you look at most of the individuals who win titles at the IWCOA Frosh/Soph State Finals, you expect to see a majority who fell just shy of advancing to the IHSA Individual State Finals, while those who failed to qualify from a regional or had season records below .500 are unusual. But that really didn’t matter very much to Grant freshman Aaden Arroyo, who went 8-9 this season and finished in fourth place at 175 in the Class 3A Libertyville Regional. One of seven qualifiers and the lone medalist for the Bulldogs, Arroyo captured the IWCOA Frosh/Soph title at 175 when he won 7-5 by sudden victory over Unity’s Abram Davidson in championship match. He won a second-round match by technical fall and had pins before and after that, winning in 1:51 in the quarterfinals over Batavia’s Colin Peyton and Arroyo earned his spot in the title match with another close decision, winning 6-5 over Morton’s Colton McKee in the semifinals.\n\n“I think I did very well,” Arroyo said. “I definitely could have done a lot better at the start of the season. But then I really started to work harder for it. Coming into this tournament, I placed second at the regional and third at the sectional and I really wanted it, so I kind of pushed myself to keep going. (Competing at Grant) Definitely the team pushes you to be better and the coaches are always trying to help you strive for more. So I’m constantly trying to be better and focusing on what needs to be done.”\n\nBy contrast, Unity sophomore Abram Davidson was a typical IWCOA finalist who fell in both the semifinals and consolation semifinals at 157 at the Class 1A Olympia Sectional and finished 39-11 after competing with his team in the IHSA Class 1A Dual Team Finals in Bloomington. One of four qualifiers and the only medal winner for the Rockets, Davidson followed a fall in his opener with two close decisions, including a 4-1 win in the quarterfinals over Lena-Winslow/Stockton’s John Mensendike in the quarterfinals. He earned his spot in the title match by getting a pin in 3:53 over Civic Memorial’s Luke McCoy, who claimed third place after capturing a 6-0 decision over Yorkville’s Caleb Viscogliosi. In the fifth-place match, Morton’s Colton McKee recorded a fall in 1:57 over Yorkville Christian’s Tyler Gleason, and for seventh place, Oak Forest’s Jason Janke captured a 7-2 decision over Lincoln-Way East’s Colton Zvonar.\n\n175 – Vincenzo Testa, Marmion Academy\n\nMarmion Academy sophomore Vincenzo Testa got the opportunity to be on one of the state’s top 3A teams this season and one of its 10 qualifiers for the rugged Class 3A Hinsdale Central Sectional, but he fell one win shy of joining seven other Cadets in Champaign and finished with a 27-13 record after his team fell to eventual 3A Dual Team champion Mount Carmel in the Downers Grove South Sectional. Testa, one of two medalists and four qualifiers for Marmion Academy at the IWCOA Frosh/Soph State Finals, captured the 175 championship with a 3-1 decision over Rolling Meadows’ John (Jack) Rappa. He opened his title run by recording three-straight falls, including a pin in 2:37 over Rich Township’s Kelcey Span in the quarterfinals and followed that with an 8-3 decision over Naperville Central’s Paul Peradotti in the semifinals.\n\nRolling Meadows sophomore John (Jack) Rappa, who went 25-13 this season and fell a bit short of advancing to state from the Class 3A Barrington Sectional, was one of two qualifiers and the lone medalist for the Mustangs in the IWCOA Frosh/Soph State Finals. After opening with two falls, he won a pair of two-point decisions, prevailing 3-1 over Lincoln-Way East’s Brody Gish in the quarterfinals and then he claimed a 2-0 victory over Yorkville Christian’s Jackson Allen in the semifinals. In the third-place match, Naperville Central’s Paul Peradotti captured a 3-0 decision over Libertyville’s Jack Treutelaar. For fifth place, Yorkville Christian’s Jackson Allen won by fall in 4:38 over Trico’s Johnny Ramaker. And Jacobs’ Johnny Strauss won by injury default over Marist’s Kyle Herzog to claim seventh place.\n\n190 – Blake Livdahl, Harvard\n\nWhen a freshman has a 20-5 record and falls one win shy of qualifying for state at a tough sectional, it usually is a good way to conclude a debut season. Harvard freshman Blake Livdahl did just that, losing in both the semifinals and consolation semifinals at the Class 2A Sycamore Sectional. The lone qualifier for the Hornets at the IWCOA Frosh/Soph State Finals, Livdahl won the 190 title match by capturing an 8-1 decision over Springfield Southeast’s Christopher Hull. He opened with a pin and then claimed another 8-1 decision before winning a 13-4 major decision over Olympia’s Darian Holloway in the quarterfinals. Livdahl earned his spot in the 190 championship mat with another major decision, this time 11-2 over Freeburg’s Dane Olmstead.\n\nSpringfield Southeast sophomore Christopher Hull also came up one win shy of advancing to state from the Class 2A Mahomet-Seymour Sectional to conclude a 29-10 season. The lone IWCOA Frosh/Soph State qualifier for the Spartans, Hull recorded falls in his first four matches. He won in 0:42 over Marmion Academy’s Luke Boersma in the quarterfinals and then pinned Joliet Catholic Academy’s Derrick Pomatto in 3:36 in the semifinals. In the third-place match, Lena-Winslow/Stockton’s Oliver McPeek captured an 8-1 decision over Lincoln-Way West’s James Talley, Jr. For fifth place, Freeburg’s Dane Olmstead won by medical forfeit over Joliet Catholic Academy’s Derrick Pomatto. And in the seventh-place match, Hampshire’s Carter Hintz pulled out an 11-10 victory over Westville’s Ethan Miller.\n\n215 – Teigen Moreno, Dundee-Crown\n\nDundee-Crown sophomore Teigen Moreno fell one win short of qualifying for the IHSA Individual Finals from the Class 3A Barrington Sectional to close out a 28-10 season. He hopes that winning the 215 title at the IWCOA Frosh/Soph State Finals helps him to qualify for state and possibly medal there next year. Moreno, the lone qualifier for the Chargers, recorded a fall in 1:23 over Marist’s Tommy O’Brien in the 215 championship match. He also got pins in his first three matches, which included one in 2:10 over Lincoln-Way Central’s Aiden Hennings in the quarterfinals. Moreno earned his spot on the title mat by claiming a 5-4 decision over Mahomet-Seymour’s Noah Daniels. He placed eighth at 220 at the Frosh/Soph State Finals a year ago.\n\nMarist sophomore Tommy O’Brien fell a bit short of joining eight of his teammates as state qualifiers from the Class 3A Hinsdale Central Sectional and finished with a 20-15 record for one of the top 3A teams this season. O’Brien was the lone finalist and one of three medal winners for the RedHawks, who had 16 individuals who participated in the IWCOA’s Frosh/Soph State Finals. O’Brien got a pin in his opener and then won two decisions, including a 3-2 victory over Minooka’s Santino Capodice in the quarterfinals. He advanced to the 215 title match with a fall in 4:29 over Vandalia’s Dominic Swyers. In the third-place match, Mahomet-Seymour’s Noah Daniels won a 9-4 decision over Vandalia’s Dominic Swyers in a meeting of individuals who were on teams that advanced to the IHSA Dual Team Finals with the Vandals placing fourth in Class 1A. For fifth place, Horizon Science Academy – Southwest Chicago’s Samel Marerro won a 10-1 major decision over Minooka’s Santino Capodice. And in the seventh-place match, Oak Forest’s Andrius Vasilevskas prevailed 5-3 in sudden victory over Jacobs’ Lucas Retzler.\n\n285 – Ryan Stingily, Lincoln-Way East\n\nRyan Stingily had a 12-12 record in mid-January and then did not compete in the IHSA Class 3A Rich Township Regional. So it’s easy to see why the Lincoln-Way East sophomore was excited to close out his season by claiming top honors at 285 at the IWCOA Frosh/Soph State Finals. In the 285 championship match, he won 4-2 on a tiebreaker over Barrington’s Clarence Jackson. Stingily, the lone finalist and one of three medal winners for the Griffins, who had seven competitors who advanced to Springfield, received a bye in his opener and then won two decisions, including 3-1 over Washington Community’s Sean Thornton in the quarterfinals. He earned his spot on the title mat by recording a fall in 2:07 over Wheeling’s Pablo Morales. Stingily also placed in the IWCOA Frosh/Soph State Finals last year, finishing fourth at 285.\n\n“It’s a great feeling and I’ve been working all season to get to this point,” Stingily said. “Being with my teammates and me cheering them on and them cheering me on. I like the family aspect of it (competing for Lincoln-Way East). When you’re part of a team at East, it’s like you’re part of a big family. It’s fun looking back on it to see where I started to where I am now. When I first started, I couldn’t even get into a stance and now I’m holding this plaque.”\n\nBarrington sophomore Clarence Jackson and the 138 champion, freshman Daniel Blanke, were the Broncos’ only qualifiers and they both advanced to the title mat. Jackson, who went 30-13 this season and fell one win shy of advancing from his school’s Class 3A sectional, got pins in his first two matches and won 5-3 by sudden victory over East Peoria’s Keegan Barnes in the quarterfinals before recording a fall in 4:33 over Evanston Township’s Ian Sims in the semifinals. In the third-place match, Fenton’s Josh Zuniga won by fall in 1:32 over Evanston Township’s Ian Sims. For fifth place, Wheeling’s Pablo Morales captured a 3-1 decision over Dakota’s Randy McPeek. And in the seventh-place match, St. Charles East’s Matt Medina, who got the opportunity to compete with his team in the IHSA Class 3A Dual Team Finals where the Fighting Saints took third place, recorded a pin in 1:33 over Fremd’s Owen Jakubczak.\n\nChampionship Matches\n\n101 – Jackson Soney (Normal Community) won by fall over Dominic Pasquale (IC Catholic Prep) Fall 0:24\n\n106 – Jackson

– Matt Medina (St. Charles East) won by fall over Owen Jakubczak (Fremd) Fall 1:33\n\nBy Curt Herron – for the IWCOA\n\nAngelina Cassioppi, Cadence Diduch, Sydney Perry, Gabby Gomez.\n\nIn that order, history was made at the third IHSA Girls Individual State Finals at Grossinger Motors Arena in Bloomington as those four became the first-ever three-time IHSA champions.\n\nWhile Batavia senior Sydney Perry closed out a perfect 41-0 season with a win by technical fall in 5:00 over Goreville senior Alivia Ming in the 145 finals two matches after Freeport senior Cadence Diduch concluded an unbeaten 29-0 campaign with a 10-1 major decision over Cumberland sophomore Natalie Beaumont at 135, there was much more suspense in both the first state championship match as well as in the last one.\n\nPerry had a tournament-high three wins by technical fall for the second year in a row. She also recorded three falls, one major decision, won a medical forfeit and claimed one decision in her other six matches at state in the past three years. Diduch’s 12 wins in the IHSA Finals were also impressive since she had five pins, two tech falls and five major decisions with no decisions.\n\nBecause there wasn’t an IHSA Finals when they were freshmen, Diduch and Perry competed in the IWCOA State Finals and they each won titles, thus making them four-time state champions. The IWCOA Girls Championships began in 2017 and there was no tournament in 2020, so this is the first class of girls that could have been four-time state champions in the two state series.\n\nHononegah junior Angelina Cassioppi finished 17-1 after winning a 4-3 decision over Hoffman Estates junior Sophia Ball at 120 in the first title match to begin the finals and Glenbard North junior Gabby Gomez capped a perfect 38-0 season with a 4-3 decision over Loyola Academy junior Harlee Hiller at 115, which was the final championship match.\n\nIn between the dramatic historic title wins by Cassioppi and Gomez, there were a lot of great story lines. The first of those was another historic first for the three-year old competition, and that was awarding trophies to the three teams who finished with the most points.\n\nLakes Community led the way with 61 points to make coach Devin Tortorice’s Eagles not only the first IHSA girls team champion but it also was that school’s first state title in any sport. The team had three medalists who all placed at the IHSA Finals for the second time. They were junior Josephine Larson, who was second at 190, senior Ava Babbs, who took third place at 125 and senior Olivia Heft, who placed fifth at 120. The team’s other two state qualifiers were senior Zaryia Mouzon at 105, who fell one win shy of a medal, and junior Haven Sylves at 110.\n\nTortorice has been the Eagles head coach for the past two seasons and has been involved with the program for five years. He wrestled at Wauconda, where he took third place at 132 in Class 2A in 2013. He feels fortunate to have three of the school’s previous head coaches assisting him as the program became Lakes Community’s first IHSA champion in any sport.\n\n“It’s surreal, it’s unique,” said Tortorice. “We knew that we had a special group of girls and they have just been so incredibly committed all year long. They train year-around and just bought in together and it’s a family. I have coaches who’ve been coaching 30-plus years and they said this was very unique and it may never happen again, so I’m going to really enjoy it. My three assistants, Curt Onstad, Mark Stave and Jack Troesch, were all the previous head coaches. I’m extremely lucky. To be able to have them all year-around training with me has built a relationship that’s going to last a lifetime.\n\n“Yeah, this season for Lakes wrestling is literally one for the history books. We were fortunate enough to walk away with the first-ever State Title. Lakes walked in with five qualifiers and left with three state placers, and all of them are multiple-time placers. They are Olivia Heft (fourth in 2021 IWCOA/second in 2022/fifth in 2024); Ava Babbs (third in 2023/third in 2024) and Josephine Larson (fifth in 2023/second in 2024). Zaryia Mouzon went 2-2 and Haven Sylves also competed.”\n\nLockport Township, coached by Nathaniel Roth, took second place after finishing three points out of first with 58 points while Batavia, coached by Scott Bayer, claimed third place with 46.5 points, which was 3.5 points better than the 43 points that both Hoffman Estates, coached by Leo Clark, and Schaumburg, coached by Matt Gruszka, scored to tie for fourth place.\n\nThe runner-up Porters were the only team in the competition that had two state champions. Sophomore Claudia Heeney edged Collinsville junior Taylor Dawson 4-2 in the 130 title match in a matchup of past state finalists. Heeney, a runner-up a year ago who finished with a 21-1 record, and 2022 runner-up and 2023 third-place finisher Dawson, who went 47-1 this season.\n\nAlso winning a title for the Porters was sophomore Morgan Turner, who made history last season at Bremen when she became the first girl to place at the IHSA Boys Individual Finals with a third-place finish. Turner, who competed with the boys team during a regular season which was limited due to an injury, capped an 11-0 run by winning the 110 title with a fall in 2:40 over Joliet Township senior Eliana Paramo, who was a three-time medalist who took second place for the second year in a row.\n\nJunior Averi Colella at 105 and freshman Rebekah Ramirez at 235 were Lockport Township’s other qualifiers. Batavia claimed third place with just two qualifiers, three-time IHSA champion and four-time state title winner senior Sydney Perry, who posted a 96-0 record the past three seasons, and sophomore Lily Enos, who took third place at 100.\n\n“We’re a really young team and hopefully we’ll keep dominating for the next couple of years,” Roth said. “I give all of the credit to the girls. They’re passionate about it and it shows. They work hard in the room and the camaraderie that they have, they’re all friends. And that helps them push each other and get better. Three years ago we didn’t get a whole lot of competition in our area. They may have had 20 matches and this year, as long as they were healthy, they had 40-some matches, and that’s huge. We’re a young team, so we lost a lot. In the moment, it’s disappointing, but that’s where you get better. With all of the tough teams around our area, that’s why we got better, because we wrestled them.”\n\nThe other three-time finalist in the tournament, Boylan Catholic senior Netavia Wickson, repeated as a state champion after taking first place at 140 with a 19-5 major decision over Schaumburg junior Madeline Zerafa-Lazarevic to cap a 23-2 season.\n\nIn the third-straight postseason tournament title match to see who would be the champion at 170, Peotone senior Kiernan Farmer won the biggest prize with a 9-6 decision over Plainfield Central junior Alicia Tucker, who was a defending state champion. Farmer finished 21-1 while Tucker went 36-2 with all of their losses to each other.\n\nMoline senior Maryam Ndiaye capped a perfect 31-0 season when she won the 155 title, thanks to a 14-5 major decision over Richwoods senior Jaida Johnson, who was also a state runner-up in the first IHSA Finals in 2022.\n\nVandalia junior Sophie Bowers got the rare opportunity to be a part of a trophy team in the Dual Team Finals, which was also taking place in Bloomington, and being an individual champion after she won a 6-0 decision for the 125 championship over Canton junior Kinnley Smith, who also took second place a year ago. Bowers, who finished 27-7, and her Vandals teammates took fourth place in Class 1A.\n\nGlenbard West senior Alycia Perez concluded her career on a high note by finishing with a perfect 35-0 record and claiming her first state medal by winning a 1-0 decision over West Aurora junior Kameyah Young in the 100 title match to become the Hilltoppers’ first champion.\n\nZion-Benton senior ILeen Castrejon, who was a runner-up in 2022 and took third a year ago, concluded her career with a 2-1 decision over Lakes Community junior Josephine Larson in the 190 title match to cap a 25-1 season and become her program’s first state champion as well as being one of of perhaps two girls at the school to win a state title in any sport.\n\nIn the longest title match, Prairie Central junior Chloe Hoselton joined her brothers Brandon, who won titles in 2018 and 2019, and Drew, who also won a title in 2018, as IHSA champions after winning 2-1 in an ultimate tiebreaker to win the 235 championship over Unity sophomore Phoenix Molina to cap a 19-3 season.\n\nIn a tournament that featured seniors and juniors winning 11 of the titles, there was one freshman who took top honors, Kaneland’s Angelina Gochis, who claimed an 8-2 decision over Huntley sophomore Janiah Slaughter in the 105 championship match to cap a 47-5 season and become her school’s first IHSA champion.\n\nTen individuals who competed in title matches are three-time medalists. They are three-time champions Cassioppi, Diduch, Gomez and Perry and the only other three-time finalist, Wickson, who joins Belleville East’s Kiara Ganey and Homewood-Flossmoor’s Attalia Watson-Castro, who were 2022 and 2023 champions, as the only two-time title winners thus far.\n\nTwo-time finalists and three-time medal winners who also advanced to title matches at the third finals were Castrejon, Dawson, Hiller, Ming and Paramo.\n\nTen other individuals who did not advance to title matches also won medals in each of the first three IHSA Finals. They are Yorkville senior Yamilet Aguirre (fourth at 125), Oak Park and River Forest senior Sarah Epshtein (fourth at 235), Curie Metropolitan senior Aaliyah Grandberry (third at 235), Lincoln-Way Central senior Gracie Guarino (third at 115), El Paso-Gridley junior Savannah Hamilton (fourth at 155), West Chicago senior Jayden Huesca-Rodriguez (fifth at 190), Grant senior Ayane Jasinski (third at 110), Burlington Central junior Victoria Macias (fifth at 115), Schaumburg senior Valeria Rodriguez (fifth at 155) and Highland junior August Rottmann (sixth at 170).\n\nHuesca-Rodriguez won a title in 2022 and took second place last season while Jasinski and Rottmann won championships a year ago. Grandberry, Guarino and Hamilton were runners-up in both 2022 and 2023 and Aguirre finished second last year.\n\nBartlett junior Emma Engels won a title in 2023 but took sixth place at 110. And Anna-Jonesboro junior Zoee Sadler took second last season and finished fourth at 105.\n\nMedalists in 2022 and 2023 who fell short of placing again this year were East Peoria senior Bailey Lusch, Round Lake junior Ireland McCain, Morris senior Ella McDonnell, Stevenson senior Sajra Sulejmani and Oak Park and River Forest senior Trinity White.\n\nJust as in previous years, a majority of the state champions were nationally-ranked. In the February National Girls High School Rankings by the National Wrestling Hall of Fame Museum, USA Wrestling and FloWrestling, eight individuals who were in the top 30 at their weights won titles. Turner was top-ranked at 105, Perry was third at 145, Diduch ranked fourth at 135, Gomez was fifth at 115, Wickson ranked sixth at 140, Cassioppi was 17th at 120, Heeney ranked 27th at 130 and Farmer was 29th at 170.\n\nNationally-ranked individuals who finished second were Hiller (11th at 115) and Dawson (15th at 130) while Wheeling’s Jasmine Rene (28th at 190) and Grandberry (ninth at 235) placed third and Rottmann (24th at 170) finished sixth after forfeiting her last two matches due to injury.\n\nIn the inaugural IHSA Finals in 2022, 11 of the champions were nationally-ranked as were two of the second-place finishers. Last season, nine title winners were in the top-30 nationally, as were three runners-up.\n\nEdwardsville and Richwoods now have had five different individuals who have placed at state in the first three IHSA Finals while Homewood-Flossmoor, J. Sterling Morton co-op and West Aurora each have had four different all-staters in the past three years of the IHSA state series.\n\n“Congratulations to all the girls and coaches who have stuck, continued to improve and helped pioneer this sport of wrestling for future girls,” Edwardsville coach Jon Wagner said. “The state tournament is definitely getting stronger. Thanks to the IHSA and the IWCOA for making it the event it is. Let’s keep improving.”\n\nWith Lakes Community winning the first IHSA team championship and Batavia finishing third to go along with fourth-place finishes from Hoffman Estates and Schaumburg, the north, western and northwest suburbs are clearly producing some of the top talent in the fast-growing sport, as is evidenced by having four state champions who combined to win 139 of 140 matches. The quality of competition from those areas was on display at the rugged Schaumburg Sectional, which was clearly the most-competitive sectional in the sport’s brief history.”Overall, the state tournament keeps on getting tougher and tougher,” Schaumburg coach Matt Gruszka said. “The quality has really increased and the growth of girls in the IKWF is also going to increase the talent level on the IHSA level. It already has this year with some of those tough freshmen winning it and placing.”\n\nThe south and southwest suburbs continue to be one of the state’s most competitive regions in the first three years of IHSA competition. And having Lockport Township get a trophy for second place in addition to two nationally-ranked state champions will only add more fuel to the fire.\n\n“The growth of girls wrestling over the past few years has been nothing short of remarkable,” Joliet Township coach Liz Short said. “What was once considered a male-dominated sport has now evolved into a thriving community of female athletes. A key factor contributing to the growth of girls wrestling is the increased support and investment from governing bodies like the IHSA and IWCOA. The state tournament this year was a true testament to the increased visibility and growth of the sport of girls wrestling.”\n\nA key to the sport’s continued explosive growth is how well it will be accepted by smaller schools. With Kaneland, Peotone, Prairie Central and Vandalia all having state champions this year, a clear signal has bet set that quality performers can come from any setting as long as girls are willing to put in the extra effort that comes with having fewer athletes to work with in a sport that has been dominated thus far by a lot of much bigger programs.\n\n“I am excited to see the growth of the IHSA State Girls Finals,” Clifton Central coach Travis Williams said. “To see where it has developed in depth and talent in just three years of existence is inspiring.\n\nThe growth of girls wrestling has freshened up the wrestling community. It brings many coaches who have been involved in the sport for decades a new perspective and opportunity to build again.”\n\nAnd when fans of the sport reflect back at its early days to see an area that enjoyed some of the most success, Rockford will definitely be one of the first communities that comes to mind, considering that two of the first four three-time champions and three of the initial five three-time finalists were from that region and combined for eight state championships in three seasons. And another area that has a great deal of passion for the sport, the Quad Cities region, claimed its first state champion.\n\nHere’s a summary of the third IHSA Girls Individual State Finals, with stories of the 14 title winners and all of the other all-state athletes who helped to make the competition one that will no doubt be remembered for a long time because of all of the history that took place there.\n\n120 – Angelina Cassioppi, Hononegah\n\nThe third IHSA Individual State Finals couldn’t have gotten off to a more dramatic start than what unfolded in the 120 championship match between a pair of juniors who entered with a combined 43-1 record, Honongah’s Angelina Cassioppi (17-1) and Hoffman Estates’ Sophia Ball (27-1). Cassioppi trailed 3-1 going into the third period but was able to get a takedown in the final seconds to pull out a 4-3 victory over Ball and thus become the first three-time IHSA champion.
