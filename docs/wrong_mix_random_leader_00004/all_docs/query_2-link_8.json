There she meets handsome and untamed inmate John Dial (John Enos III) and she begins to fall for his charms, against her better judgement. Their closeness doesn't go unnoticed by up-and-coming rap artist Kandi, who also happens to be Dial's girlfriend. In order to be alone with Dial, Elaine disguises herself as Kandi for a conjugal visit inside the prison.

When Elaine leaves the literacy program, Dial takes matters into his own hands by murdering the prison warden and escaping. Now that he is out, Elaine seeks help from a detective Pearlmutter (Michael Parks) but Dial is determined to teach her a lesson she'll never forget.\n\nLesley-Anne Down as Elaine Patterson\n\nJohn Enos III as Dial\n\nLady B.
