        "text": "James Bond, Spider-Man and Doctor Who are just a few characters that come to mind when we think of roles that are so iconic that hundreds of actors would surely line up to play. And though each actor who embodies these characters might give their own interpretation of the character, and reach varying levels of success, there’s something special about these characters that remain immortalized through different actors through the years.\n\nSuperman, aka the Man of Steel, is another prime example. Though some actors like Henry Cavill and Christopher Reeve might immediately come to mind when you hear the name, the reporter-turned-superhero has been played by over 13 different actors through the years. Starting on the small screen in 1948 with Kirk Alyn, the superhero has taken different forms in movies, TV shows, animated movies and much more.\n\nMost recently, David Corenswet, who’s starred in shows like Hollywood and movies like Look Both Ways, was announced as James Gunn’s newest selection for the role for the upcoming 2025 movie Superman: Legacy. Corenswet will be playing Clark Kent alongside The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel star Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane.\n\nIn the running for Corenswet’s new job were The Great‘s Nicholas Hoult and UnREAL‘s Tom Brittney, per The Hollywood Reporter. As for Brosnahan’s role, the position was also coveted with Sex Education‘s Emma Mackey and Bridgerton‘s Phoebe Dynevor as the runners-up. Talk about tight competition!\n\nIn honor of Gunn’s recent Superman pick, we’ve compiled a list of all the handsome men who’ve played the iconic superhero over the years. Take a trip down memory lane below!"
