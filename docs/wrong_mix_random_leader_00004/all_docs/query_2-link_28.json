Yes, our readers loved the dark and handsome bad boy who was played by Boston-native, John Enos III! The velvet-voiced Bobby, who oozed sex appeal, was able to win female viewers’ hearts in spite of the fact that he was the owner of a strip joint!\n\nBobby Marcino arrived on the Genoa City landscape when he enticed the misguided, rich teen Brittany Hodges (Lauren Woodland) to sing at his club. Of course Brittany was dismayed to discover it was actually a strip club, but agreed to sing anyway – under the condition that she didn’t have to disrobe! When the newly confident songbird decided to join in the er, fun, her father, Frederick Hodges (John H. Martin), who was entertaining clients at the establishment, discovered his “little girl” in the spotlight, and consequently ended up on the wrong side of Bobby when he tried to drag her out. Eventually, Frederick had the club shut down and Bobby ended up hanging out at the GCAC rubbing elbows with the like of Jill Abbott (Jess Walton), who unsuccessfully hit on him!\n\nBobby had no interest in older women at that time – he had fallen in love with Brittany. Unfortunately, due to Bobby’s connection with the disreputable Saul and his hit men, Brittany ended up being electrocuted at his club – her beautiful face scarred. Bobby stayed by her side, and Brittany finally admitted she was in love with him. After the electrocution, Bobby went legit, and had reopened his business with the help of Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott). After Bobby and Brittany wed, they stayed with the generous Nikki at the ranch while their condo was being renovated. Nikki, of course, began having flashbacks during this time, and it was revealed that they were related to Bobby’s childhood – he was actually Charles Cassen. After the revelation that Nikki had killed his older brother, Joshua, Bobby left town. Eventually he returned and bonded with Nikki over memories. He and Brittany later had a son, who they named Joshua, but their life together was still complicated as Bobby was forced to go into the witness protection program. While awaiting word that it was safe for her and the baby to join him, the news came that Bobby had been killed by a hit and run driver."
