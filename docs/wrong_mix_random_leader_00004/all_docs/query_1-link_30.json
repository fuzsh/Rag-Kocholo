Unilateral renal agenesis, on the other hand, is a relatively common congenital anomaly, although its etiology is not fully understood. Renal and pancreatic embryologic development appears to be nonrelated. We report a case of a 34-year-old man who was referred to our hospital for evaluation of cholestasis and microalbuminuria. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging examinations showed empty right renal fossa and absence of the pancreatic neck, body, and tail. Our case report is the second case of a dorsal pancreatic agenesis and unilateral renal agenesis in a young male patient.\n\nWaardenburg syndrome with familial unilateral renal agenesis: a new syndrome variant?\n\nPubMed\n\nWebb, Katie M; Smith, Alisha J; Dansby, Linda M; Diskin, Charles J\n\n2015-06-01\n\nA 64-year-old man with Waardenburg syndrome presented with anuria and was subsequently discovered by renal ultrasound to have unilateral renal agenesis. The patient is one of three generations with incidental finding of renal agenesis also marked by the presence of Waardenburg syndrome. To our knowledge, there has been no mention elsewhere in the scientific literature of a variant of Waardenburg syndrome with associated renal agenesis. Â© 2014 The Authors.

To determine whether unilateral renal agenesis is a risk factor for the progression of renal insufficiency, we studied age-related pathophysiological alterations in affected rats. Although body growth and food intake were normal, polydipsia and polyuria with low specific gravity were present at 10 weeks and deteriorated further with age. Blood hemoglobin concentrations were normal, though there was slight erythropenia with increased MCV and MCH. Although hypoalbuminemia, hypercholesterolemia, azotemia, and hypermagnesemia were manifested after age 20 weeks, neither hyperphosphatemia nor hypocalcemia was observed. Plasma Cre and UN concentrations gradually increased with age. Cre clearance was almost normal, whereas fractional UN excretion was consistently lower than normal. Proteinuria increased with age, and albumin was the major leakage protein. In addition to cortical lesions, dilated tubules, cast formation, and interstitial fibrosis were observed in the renal medulla of 50 week-old affected rats. Renal weight was increased 1.7-fold and glomerular number 1.2-fold compared with normal rats. These findings show that the remaining kidney in UUA rats is involved not only in compensatory reactions but experiences pathophysiological alterations associated with progressive renal insufficiency.\n\nUnilateral renal agenesis with subseptate uterus and sacrococcygeal teratoma: A unique triad\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAhmed, Muhammad S; Imtiaz, Sheeza; Pathan, Hina; Usman, Rahila\n\n2017-01-01\n\nUnilateral renal agenesis (URA) is a rare condition with a reported incidence of 0.93â1.8 per 1000 autopsies. It is commonly diagnosed as an incidental finding on imaging. URA is frequently associated with other genitourinary anomalies. Different associations have been described in both males and females, however, to our knowledge, it has not been reported with subseptate uterus (SSU) and sacrococcygeal teratoma (SCT) in the same individual. Here, we present a unique case of URA with SSU and SCT.

Most cases examined (72.4%) were of the classic anatomic variant of the Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich syndrome (with didelphys uterus, obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal agenesis) but the 27.6% of cases are of a rare variant of the syndrome (with uterus septum or cervical agenesis), showing relevant clinical and surgical implications. The extreme variability of anatomic structures involved in this syndrome (both uterus, cervico-vaginal and renal anomalies) is well known, even if a complete and uniform analysis of all its heterogeneous presentations in a large series is lacking. This is a retrospective study with 87 patients referred to our third level referral center between 1981 and 2011. We analyzed the laparoscopic and chart records of 87 women, who referred to our institute with double uterus, unilateral cervico-vaginal obstruction and ipsilateral renal anomalies. Sixty-three of 87 patients had the more classic variant of didelphys uterus with obstructed hemivagina; 10/87 patients had septate bicollis uterus with obstructed hemivagina; 9/87 patients had bicornuate bicollis uterus with obstructed hemivagina; 4/87 patients had didelphys uterus with unilateral cervical atresia; 1/87 patients had bicornuate uterus with one septate cervix and unilateral obstructed hemivagina. This is a retrospective study with a long enrolling period (30 years). New insights in the anatomic variants of this rare syndrome with their relevant surgical implications.\n\n[Unilateral renal agenesis. New arguments about the genetic relationship between kidney malformations and urolithiasis].\n\nPubMed\n\nGarcia Nieto, Victor; Huertes DÃ­az, Beatriz; Escribano Subias, Joaquin; AlarcÃ³n Alacio, Maria Teresa; Gonzalez RodrÃ­guez, Juan David; Cabrera Sevilla, JosÃ© Eugenio; Peralta Aros, Carolina; Luis Yanes, Maria Isabel\n\n2016-11-01\n\nIn few previous works, it has been reported that hypercalciuria is associated with some types of CAKUT, namely ureteropelvic junction obstruction, vesicoureteral reflux or simple renal cysts. In addition, one higher prevalence of hypercalciuria and/or urolithiasis has been described in their family members compared to the general population. This study was carried out to find out whether children with unilateral renal agenesis (URA) have these features previously described in other CAKUT types. In a descriptive and multicenter study we studied the prevalence of hypercalciuria, hypocitraturia and urolithiasis in 67 children (43 males and 24 females) with URA and their families. The two metabolic anomalies that promote stone formation were observed in 26 children (38.8%), distributed as follows: hypercalciuria in 16, hypocitraturia in 9, and both hypercalciuria and hypocitraturia in 1. Eight children (11.9%) suffered renal colic during follow-up. Familial history of urolithiasis was found in 42/67 children (62.7%): in 12 of the first-degree relatives, in 15 of the second degree relatives and in 15 patients both in the first-degree as in their second degree relatives. In contrast, in historic control group, only in 28.1% of families at least one member had urolithiasis. Our results show that the prevalence of hypercalciuria and/or hypocitraturia is greater in pediatric patients with URA than in the general population. Likewise, the prevalence of urolithiasis in the families of these children is also higher than that in the general population. Copyright Â© 2015 AsociaciÃ³n EspaÃ±ola de PediatrÃ­a.

Heterozygous mutations of several genes have been identified as genetic causes of RHD with various severity. However, these genes and mutations are not associated with bilateral renal agenesis, except for RET mutations, which could be involved in a few cases. The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to total absence of kidney development thus remain largely elusive. By using a whole-exome sequencing approach in families with several fetuses with bilateral renal agenesis, we identified recessive mutations in the integrin Î±8-encoding gene ITGA8 in two families. Itga8 homozygous knockout in mice is known to result in absence of kidney development. We provide evidence of a damaging effect of the human ITGA8 mutations. These results demonstrate that mutations of ITGA8 are a genetic cause of bilateral renal agenesis and that, at least in some cases, bilateral renal agenesis is an autosomal-recessive disease.

With the exception of a single case study using serial amnioinfusion, there has been no other case of survival following dialysis and transplantation documented.

Counseling pregnant women about management of pregnancies complicated by bilateral renal agenesis should be guided by beneficence-based judgment informed by evidence about outcomes. Based on the ethical analysis of the results from this review, without experimental obstetric intervention, neonatal mortality rates will continue to be 100%. Serial amnioinfusion therefore should not be offered as treatment, but only as approved innovation or research.\n\nEvidence-based, ethically justified counseling for fetal bilateral renal agenesis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nThomas, Alana N.; McCullough, Laurence B.; Chervenak, Frank A.; Placencia, Frank X.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground Not much data are available on the natural history of bilateral renal agenesis, as the medical community does not typically offer aggressive obstetric or neonatal care asbilateral renal agenesis has been accepted as a lethal condition.

This group of congenital malformations is often asymptomatic until puberty, when it presents as cyclic dysmenorrhoea, leucorrhoea or a pelvic mass. Magnetic resonance imaging is becoming the preferred modality for delineation of uterine malformations. When congenital abnormalities of the reproductive tract are encountered, a search should also be made for renal anomalies. Patients with Uterus bicornis bicollis and unilateral imperforate vagina are often seen with pain severe enough to mimic an acute abdomen. It is important to keep this unusual congenital malformation in mind in the differential diagnosis of vaginal discharge, pelvic mass and/or abdominopelvic pain in young women so as to avoid inappropriate surgical procedures.\n\nRenal Aplasia in Humans Is Associated with RET Mutations\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSkinner, Michael A.; Safford, Shawn D.; Reeves, Justin G.; Jackson, Margaret E.; Freemerman, Alex J.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nIn animal models, kidney formation is known to be controlled by the proteins RET, GDNF, and GFRA1; however, no human studies to date have shown an association between abnormal kidney development and mutation of these genes. We hypothesized that stillborn fetuses with congenital renal agenesis or severe dysplasia would possess mutations in RET, GDNF, or GFRA1. We assayed for mutations in these genes in 33 stillborn fetuses that had bilateral or unilateral renal agenesis (29 subjects) or severe congenital renal dysplasia (4 subjects). Mutations in RET were found in 7 of 19 fetuses with bilateral renal agenesis (37%) and 2 of 10 fetuses (20%) with unilateral agenesis. In two fetuses, there were two different RET mutations found, and a total of ten different sequence variations were identified. We also investigated whether these mutations affected RET activation; in each case, RET phosphorylation was either absent or constitutively activated. A GNDF mutation was identified in only one fetus with unilateral agenesis; this subject also had two RET mutations. No GFRA1 mutations were seen in any fetuses. These data suggest that in humans, mutations in RET and GDNF may contribute significantly to abnormal kidney development.

A total of 417 Japanese subjects (134 males and 283 females) with agenesis of one or more third molars were divided into four groups according to the agenesis pattern, and 874 other Japanese subjects (302 males and 572 females) without third molar agenesis were assigned to a control group. Panoramic radiographs and medical and dental records were used to examine for tooth agenesis. The Chi-square test and odds ratio were used to make statistical comparisons. The prevalence of third molar agenesis worked out at 32.3% with no statistically significant gender difference. A high prevalence rate of agenesis of third molars, unilateral or bilateral, could be considered characteristic of the Japanese orthodontic population. Significant increases in occurrence of oligodontia, and unilateral or bilateral agenesis of other teeth, including maxillary lateral incisors and maxillary and mandibular second premolars, were observed in all or almost all of the third molar agenesis groups, compared with the controls. A significantly increased prevalence rate of mandibular lateral incisor agenesis was observed in almost all of the third molar agenesis groups. The Japanese patients with third molar agenesis had a significantly increased occurrence of oligodontia, and unilateral or bilateral agenesis of maxillary and mandibular lateral incisors and second premolars, except for bilateral agenesis of mandibular lateral incisors.\n\nDoes the serum uric acid level have any relation to arterial stiffness or blood pressure in adults with congenital renal agenesis and/or hypoplasia?\n\nPubMed\n\nYazici, Raziye; Guney, Ä°brahim; Altintepe, Lutfullah; Yazici, Mehmet\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe relationship between serum uric acid and arterial stiffness or blood pressure is not clear. The serum uric acid level and its association with cardiovascular risk is not well known in patients with reduced renal mass. We aimed to investigate the relation between serum uric acid levels and arterial stiffness and also blood pressure in patients with congenital renal agenesis and/or hypoplasia. In this single center, cross-sectional study, a total of 55 patients (39 (% 70.9) with unilateral small kidney and 16 (%29.1) with renal agenesis) were included. The median age was 35 (21-50) years. The study population was divided into tertiles of serum uric acid (according to 2.40-3.96, 3.97-5.10, and 5.11-9.80 mg/dl cut-off values of serum uric acid levels). Official and 24-h ambulatory non-invasive blood pressures of all patients were measured. The arterial stiffness was assessed by pulse wave velocity (PWV). PWV values were increased from first to third tertile (5.5 Â± 0.6, 5.7 Â± 0.8, 6.1 Â± 0.7, respectively), but this gradual increase between tertiles did not reach significance. Linear regression analyses showed a positive correlation between serum uric acid levels and PWV (Î² = 0.40, p = 0.010), but no correlation was found between uric acid and daytime systolic blood pressure (Î² = 0.24, p = 0.345). In congenital renal agenesis/hypoplasia, the serum uric acid level was positively correlated with arterial stiffness, but there was no correlation with blood pressure.\n\nUterus didelphys associated with unilateral imperforate vagina.\n\nPubMed\n\nGilliland, B; Dyck, F\n\n1976-07-01\n\nTwo cases of uterus didelphys associated with unilateral imperforate vagina are reported with a review of the literature. In all cases investigated, ipsilateral renal agenesis was found on the affected side. A summary of the embryologic development of the female reproductive tract is included, as well as a possible explanation for this rare anomaly. The authors describe their proposed method of management to achieve freedom from symptoms and maintenance of a relatively intact reproductive tract.\n\nFamilial occurrence of complete agenesis of the diaphragm.\n\nPubMed\n\nSripathi, V; Beasley, S W\n\n1992-04-01\n\nThe tenth occurrence of complete unilateral agenesis of the diaphragm (McKusick 22240) in siblings is reported in this study. It is likely that parents of children with this type of congenital diaphragmatic hernia have a significantly increased recurrence risk for future offspring. Genetic counselling and antenatal ultrasound should be considered for subsequent pregnancies in families with a previous child with complete agenesis of the diaphragm.\n\nLoss of function IFT27 variants associated with an unclassified lethal fetal ciliopathy with renal agenesis.\n\nPubMed\n\nQuÃ©lin, ChloÃ©; Loget, Philippe; Boutaud, Lucile; Elkhartoufi, Nadia; Milon, Joelle; Odent, Sylvie; Fradin, MÃ©lanie; Demurger, Florence; Pasquier, Laurent; Thomas, Sophie; AttiÃ©-Bitach, Tania\n\n2018-04-27\n\nCiliopathies comprise a group of clinically heterogeneous and overlapping disorders with a wide spectrum of phenotypes ranging from prenatal lethality to adult-onset disorders. Pathogenic variants in more than 100 ciliary protein-encoding genes have been described, most notably those involved in intraflagellar transport (IFT) which comprises two protein complexes, responsible for retrograde (IFT-A) and anterograde transport (IFT-B). Here we describe a fetus with an unclassified severe ciliopathy phenotype including short ribs, polydactyly, bilateral renal agenesis, and imperforate anus, with compound heterozygosity for c.118_125del, p.(Thr40Glyfs*11) and a c.352 +1Gâ>âT in IFT27, which encodes a small GTPase component of the IFT-B complex. We conclude that bilateral renal agenesis is a rare feature of this severe ciliopathy and this report highlights the phenotypic overlap of Pallister-Hall syndrome and ciliopathies. The phenotype in patients with IFT27 gene variants is wide ranging from Bardet-Biedl syndrome to a lethal phenotype.

A 17 year old woman presented with right pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea, present since menarche at 13 and worsening over the past year. Ultrasound examination revealed a right pelvic mass (5Ã5 cm), double endometrial echoes, and hematocolpos. A right pelvic mass, agenesis of the right kidney, double uterus, and blind hemivagina with hematocolpos were detected by magnetic resonance imaging and intravenous pyelography. A right tubo-ovarian abscess with dense adhesions and a double uterus were observed on diagnostic laparoscopy. Adhesiolysis was carried out and purulent material irrigated. After a course of antibiotics, a vaginal septum resection was performed and the pyocolpos drained. She remained symptom free after four months of follow-up. Prompt and accurate diagnosis and treatment of this syndrome can significantly improve the lives of sufferers and prevent future complications. PMID:24591910\n\nPosition and Eruption of Permanent Maxillary Canines in Cases of Maxillary Lateral Incisor Agenesis in Mixed Dentition.\n\nPubMed\n\nLamas, CÃ¡tia; Lavall, Asela; Pinho, Teresa\n\n2018-01-01\n\nAssess whether the permanent maxillary canine (MC) has a natural tendency to erupt mesially in children with maxillary lateral incisors agenesis (MLIA), compared to children without agenesis. This retrospective, observational, cross-sectional study consisted of children between 5 and 12 years old divided into three groups: the first group with unilateral MLIA, in which an intraindividual analysis was performed, the second group presented bilateral MLIA, and the third group with patients without agenesis. These last two groups were matched for comparison interindividual, being pared by sex and maturation of the MC. The canine position in the horizontal sector showed a clear mesial positioning of the MC on the agenesis side in individuals with unilateral MLIA (group 1) when compared with the counter lateral side; and in individuals with bilateral MLIA (Group 2) compared with control Individuals without agenesis (group 3). Even with the maintenance of this deciduous tooth in the dental arch, the MC keeps its tendency to mesial eruption. There is a greater tendency for mesial angulation of the maxillary canine in patients with MLIA, regardless of the presence or absence of deciduous lateral incisor.\n\nFetal bilateral renal agenesis, phocomelia, and single umbilical artery associated with cocaine abuse in early pregnancy.\n\nPubMed\n\nKashiwagi, Maki; Chaoui, Rabih; Stallmach, Thomas; HÃ¼rlimann, Sandra; Lauper, Urs; Hebisch, Gundula\n\n2003-11-01\n\nMaternal cocaine abuse in pregnancy is associated with complications such as intrauterine growth retardation, abruptio placentae, and preterm delivery. We report what is, to our knowledge, the first published observation of fetal bilateral renal agenesis associated with a vascular disruption syndrome comprising upper limb reduction defect and a single umbilical artery following maternal cocaine abuse in early pregnancy. This constellation in a fetus aborted at 18 weeks extends the spectrum of complications possibly associated with cocaine abuse in pregnancy.

The sample comprised of radiographic materials from 63 individuals with maxillary dental transpositions from the Departments of Odontology at the Universities of Copenhagen and Aarhus and by the Danish municipal orthodontic service. The cases were divided into three groups: unilateral transposition of the canine and first premolar (Type 1U), bilateral transposition of canine and first premolar (Type 1B), and unilateral transposition of canine and lateral incisor (Type 2). The dentitions were analysed regarding agenesis and dental morphological anomalies on panoramic radiographs, and craniofacial aspects were cephalometrically analysed on profile images The results were statistically evaluated. All groups demonstrated increased occurrences of agenesis (Type 1U and Type 1B: 31 agenesis in 15 patients; and Type 2 three agenesis in three patients). Taurodontic root morphology was most dominant in Type 1U. Peg-shaped lateral incisors showed an increased occurrence, though not in Type 1U. Skeletally, Type 1B and Type 1U demonstrated maxillary retrognathia (more pronounced in Type 1B). Type 2 showed a significant posterior inclination of the maxilla. Transpositions of maxillary canines involve dental and skeletal deviations. Dental deviations were predominantly taurodontic root morphology and agenesis. Regarding skeletal deviations, bilateral transpositions of the canines and the first premolars are associated with skeletal changes. Unilateral transpositions are possibly a localised deviation with minor or no skeletal involvements. The results indicate a possible difference in the aetiologies of unilateral and bilateral transpositions.\n\nUnilateral agenesis of internal carotid artery associated with congenital combined pituitary hormone deficiency and pituitary stalk interruption without HESX1, LHX4 or OTX2 mutation: a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nLamine, FaÃ¯za; Kanoun, Faouzi; Chihaoui, Melika; Saveanu, Alexandru; Menif, Emna; Barlier, Anne; Enjalbert, Alain; Brue, Thierry; Slimane, HÃ©dia\n\n2012-12-01\n\nAgenesis of internal carotid artery (ICA) is an unusual finding in subjects with congenital Combined Pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) with only nine cases being reported to date but to our best knowledge none of them was genetically investigated. A 10-years old girl presented with severe growth failure (height 103 cm) with substantial bone age delay (3 years). She had no history of perinatal insults or familial CPHD. There was no evidence of mental retardation or craniofacial dysmorphism or ophtalmological abnormalities. She was first diagnosed with GH and TSH deficiency. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed hypoplastic anterior pituitary, flat sella turcica, absent pituitary stalk with ectopic posterior pituitary as well as agenesis of the left ICA and the left carotid canal. Genomic analysis of pituitary transcription factor HESX1, LHX4 and OTX2 showed no mutations. Treatment with GH and thyroxine was started. The patient remained free of neurovascular symptoms for 5 years but she presented at the age of 15 years with delayed puberty related to an evolving gonadotropin deficiency. ICA agenesis associated with CPHD is unusual and is often asymptomatic in children. Since the CPHD with pituitary stalk interruption cannot be due to HESX1, LHX4 or OTX2 mutation in our case, other pathogenetic mechanisms may be responsible for CPHD associated with unilateral ICA agenesis.\n\n[Management experience of acute renal failure induced by unilateral ureteral calculi obstruction].\n\nPubMed\n\nTan, Fu-qing; Shen, Bo-hua; Xie, Li-ping; Meng, Hong-zhou; Fang, Dan-bo; Wang, Chao-jun\n\n2013-05-28\n\nTo explore the causes and treatment options of acute renal failure induced by unilateral ureteral calculi obstruction. The clinical data of 12 cases of acute renal failure induced by unilateral ureteral calculi obstruction between August 2008 and July 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. There were 5 males and 7 females with an average age of 65.7 years. Their clinical data and treatment options were retrospectively analyzed and summarized. Seven cases showed right side ureteral calculus with hydronephrosis while another 5 presented left side ureteral calculus with hydronephrosis. Serum creatinine was higher than 310 Âµmol/L in 12 cases. Anuria appeared in 4 cases for 1-7 days while oliguria in 8 cases for 2-10 days. High fever was present in 11 cases, the highest of whom was 40 Â°C. White blood cell count increased in 10 cases (>10Ã10(9)/L) and decreased in 2 cases (<4 Ã 10(9)/L). The therapeutic options included insertion of double J stent for internal drainage (n = 1), percutaneous nephrostomy for external drainage (n = 10) and open operation (n = 1). Traditional treatments were performed to manage ureteral calculus in the above 11 cases with drainage. All cases had improved renal function after comprehensive treatment of anti-infection, antishock, rinsing stones and relieving obstruction. All 12 cases were treated successfully. Unilateral ureteral calculus may impair contralateral renal function and cause acute renal failure due to the absorption of toxin at obstructive side. The keys of management are eliminating toxin and relieving obstruction.\n\nA cross-sectional analysis of the prevalence of tooth agenesis and structural dental anomalies in association with cleft type in non-syndromic oral cleft patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nKonstantonis, Dimitrios; Alexandropoulos, Alexandros; Konstantoni, Nikoleta; Nassika, Maria\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of tooth agenesis, microdontia, and tooth malformation among non-syndromic oral cleft patients and their potential association with cleft type and gender. Intraoral records and radiographs of 154 patients (97 males and 57 females) were examined. The variables assessed were tooth agenesis, microdontia, dental malformations, and cleft types. The statistics included chi-square and Fisher's exact tests as well as logistic regression to assess any mutual effects of gender and cleft type on the dental variables. Tooth agenesis occurred in 50% of the sample and microdontia in 18%. Non-statistically significant odds ratios for the association of gender and cleft type with tooth agenesis were obtained. Tooth agenesis was substantially higher at the unilateral right CLâ+âP and the bilateral CLâ+âP in quadrant 1 and at the unilateral left CLâ+âP and bilateral CLâ+âP in quadrant 2. It was also higher, at the isolated cleft palate (CP) in quadrants 3 and 4. These results were attributed to teeth 22 (31.8%) and 12 (21.6%) in the maxilla and to teeth 35 (6.1%) and 45 (5.4%) in the mandible. In unilateral CLâ+âP patients, the cleft quadrant that presented tooth agenesis was associated with the side of the cleft. Interdisciplinary treatment of the oral cleft patients should take into consideration the high prevalence of tooth agenesis and their association with the different cleft types. The most frequently affected teeth by cleft are by far the upper lateral incisors. Results indicate that tooth agenesis appears to be a genetically controlled anomaly related to the orofacial cleft development through various genetic links and not caused by the cleft disruptive process.\n\nDelayed dental maturity in dentitions with agenesis of mandibular second premolars.\n\nPubMed\n\nDaugaard, S; Christensen, I J; Kjaer, I\n\n2010-11-01\n\nTo evaluate dental maturity in the mandibular canine/premolar and molar innervation fields in children with agenesis of the 2nd mandibular premolar and to associate these findings with normal control material. Department of Orthodontics, Institute of Odontology, University of Copenhagen. Eighty-three panoramic radiographs (27 girls and 31 boys with agenesis of one mandibular 2nd premolar and 17 girls and eight boys with agenesis of both mandibular 2nd premolars) represented all mandibular second premolar agenesis cases from a material of 2847 radiographs. On each radiograph, dental maturity of all available mandibular premolars, canines and 2nd molars was evaluated and categorized in maturity stages according to Haavikko whose material served as control material. Descriptive statistics given by sample mean, standard deviation and range for each tooth stratified by gender and agenesis. Ninety-five percentage confidence limits and T-statistics were used. p-values <5% were considered significant. In unilateral agenesis, the canines are specifically delayed in both girls and boys, with a larger delay in girls (p=0.009). The second molar is not delayed in boys (p=0.98) but is in girls (p=0.04). The differences in delay for the canine compared to the second molar are significant for both girls and boys. The results show a considerable delay in tooth maturation within the canine/premolar innervation field predominantly in girls. The 2nd molar is delayed in girls but not in boys.

The increased susceptibility to renal injury may be due, in part, to reduced nephron numbers. Notably, children who undergo nephrectomy or adults who serve as kidney donors exhibit little difference in renal function compared with persons who have two kidneys. However, the difference in risk between being born with a single kidney versus being born with two kidneys and then undergoing nephrectomy are unclear. Animal models used previously to investigate this question are not ideal because they require invasive methods to model congenital solitary kidney. In this study, we describe a new genetic animal model, the heterogeneous stock-derived model of unilateral renal agenesis (HSRA) rat, which demonstrates 50%â75% spontaneous incidence of a single kidney. The HSRA model is characterized by reduced nephron number (more than would be expected by loss of one kidney), early kidney/glomerular hypertrophy, and progressive renal injury, which culminates in reduced renal function. Long-term studies of temporal relationships among BP, renal hemodynamics, and renal function demonstrate that spontaneous single-kidney HSRA rats are more likely than uninephrectomized normal littermates to exhibit renal impairment because of the combination of reduced nephron numbers and prolonged exposure to renal compensatory mechanisms (i.e., hyperfiltration). Future studies with this novel animal model may provide additional insight into the genetic contributions to kidney development and agenesis and the factors influencing susceptibility to renal injury in individuals with congenital solitary kidney.

Seventy-four SFK fetuses (unilateral renal agenesis [12], multicystic dysplastic kidney [36], and severe renal dysplasia [26]) were compared with 58 healthy fetuses. Peak systolic velocity (PSV), pulsatility index (PI), and resistance index (RI) of the renal artery (RA) were measured; 2D and 3D (VOCAL) volumes were calculated. Renal length and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were obtained in SFK children (2Â years). Compared with the control group, the PSV RA was significantly lower in nonfunctioning kidneys and significantly higher in SFK. Volume measurements indicated a significantly larger volume of SFK compared with healthy kidneys. All but 4 children had GFR above 70Â mL/min/1.73Â m 2 , and compensatory hypertrophy was present in 69% at 2Â years. PSV RA and SFK volume correlated with postnatal renal hypertrophy. No correlation between prenatal and postnatal SFK volume and GFR at 2Â years was demonstrated. Low PSV RA might have a predictive value for diagnosing a nonfunctioning kidney in fetuses with a SFK. We demonstrated a higher PSV RA and larger renal volume in the SFK compared with healthy kidneys.

Prognosis is also uncertain, with older literature reporting poor outcomes. The North of England register of congenital anomalies (Northern Congenital Abnormality Survey) records cases of congenital anomalies to mothers' resident in the region. We used the register to identify all patients with congenital lung agenesis born between 2004 and 2013 to calculate an accurate incidence estimate and report clinical outcomes with contemporary management. Four patients with congenital lung agenesis were born during the study period, giving an estimated incidence in the North of England of 1.22 per 100,000 live births (95% confidence interval, 0.33-3.11). Two patients had associated congenital heart disease requiring corrective surgery, and one had musculoskeletal anomalies. All four patients are alive and well without a regular oxygen requirement. Contrary to previous reports, the medium term outcomes in our patients have been good, even when lung agenesis is associated with other congenital anomalies. Long-term prognosis with modern management remains unknown, and the potential for the development of pulmonary hypertension remains a concern. Birth Defects Research 109:857-859, 2017.

Indeterminate drainage preserved DRF in higher grades of hydronephrosis, in some situations, complicating the decision-making process. Due to an asymmetric renal area ratio, falsely negative DRF estimations can result in missed optimal surgery times. This study was designed to assess whether correcting the DRF estimation according to kidney area could reflect the clinical situation of a hydronephrotic kidney better than a classical DRF calculation, concurrently with the hydronephrosis grade, APD and MAG-3 drainage pattern. We reviewed the MAG-3, dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans and ultrasonography (US) of 23 children (6 girls, 17 boys, mean age: 29 Â± 50 months) with unilateral hydronephrosis. MAG-3 and DMSA scans were performed within 3 months (mean 25.4 Â± 30.7 days). The closest US findings (mean 41.5 Â± 28.2 days) were used. DMSA DRF estimations were obtained using the geometric mean method. Secondary calculations were performed to correct the counts (the total counts divided by the number of pixels in ROI) according to kidney area. The renogram patterns of patients were evaluated and separated into subgroups. The visual assessment of DMSA scans was noted and the hydronephrotic kidney was classified in comparison to the normal contralateral kidney's uptake. The correlations of the DRF values of classical and area-corrected methods with MAG-3 renogram patterns, the visual classification of DMSA scan, the hydronephrosis grade and the APD were assessed. DRF estimations of two methods were statistically different (p: 0.001). The categories of 12 hydronephrotic kidneys were changed. There were no correlations between classical DRF estimations and the hydronephrosis grade, APD, visual classification of the DMSA scan and uptake evaluation.

Basigin/CD147 is a multifunctional molecule-it induces matrix metalloproteinases and hyaluronan, for example-and has been implicated in organ fibrosis. However, the relationship between basigin and organ fibrosis has been poorly studied. We investigated basigin's role in renal fibrosis using a unilateral ureteral obstruction model. Basigin-deficient mice (Bsg(-/-)) demonstrated significantly less fibrosis after surgery than Bsg(+/+) mice. Fewer macrophages had infiltrated in Bsg(-/-) kidneys. Consistent with these in vivo data, primary cultured tubular epithelial cells from Bsg(-/-) mice produced less matrix metalloproteinase and exhibited less motility on stimulation with transforming growth factor Î². Furthermore, Bsg(-/-) embryonic fibro blasts produced less hyaluronan and Î±-smooth muscle actin after transforming growth factor Î² stimulation. Together, these results demonstrate for the first time that basigin is a key regulator of renal fibrosis. Basigin could be a candidate target molecule for the prevention of organ fibrosis.

We retrospectively selected 28 99mTc MAG3 renograms performed in children, 12 with unilateral nephrectomy, 4 with unilateral agenesis and 12 with a non-functioning kidney. A renal and perirenal region of interest (ROI) were delineated around the functioning kidney. The ROIs around the empty kidney were drawn symmetrically to the contralateral side. The split renal function was calculated using three different methods, the integral method, the slope method and the Patlak-Rutland algorithm. For the whole group of 28 kidneys as well as for the three categories of patients, the three methods provided a split function on the side of the non-functioning kidney close to the zero value, regardless of whether the empty kidney was the left or the right one. We recommend the use of the integral method for the whole range of split renal function with 99mTc MAG3. No significant improvement was obtained by means of the more sophisticated Patlak-Rutland method.\n\nAnalysis of renal anomalies in VACTERL association.\n\nPubMed\n\nCunningham, Bridget K; Khromykh, Alina; Martinez, Ariel F; Carney, Tyler; Hadley, Donald W; Solomon, Benjamin D\n\n2014-10-01\n\nVACTERL association refers to a combination of congenital anomalies that can include: vertebral anomalies, anal atresia, cardiac malformations, tracheo-esophageal fistula with esophageal atresia, renal anomalies (typically structural renal anomalies), and limb anomalies. We conducted a description of a case series to characterize renal findings in a cohort of patients with VACTERL association. Out of the overall cohort, 48 patients (with at least three component features of VACTERL and who had abdominal ultrasound performed) met criteria for analysis. Four other patients were additionally analyzed separately, with the hypothesis that subtle renal system anomalies may occur in patients who would not otherwise meet criteria for VACTERL association. Thirty-three (69%) of the 48 patients had a clinical manifestation affecting the renal system. The most common renal manifestation (RM) was vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in addition to a structural defect (present in 27%), followed by unilateral renal agenesis (24%), and then dysplastic/multicystic kidneys or duplicated collected system (18% for each). Twenty-two (88%) of the 25 patients with a structural RM had an associated anorectal malformation. Individuals with either isolated lower anatomic anomalies, or both upper and lower anatomic anomalies were not statistically more likely to have a structural renal defect than those with isolated upper anatomic anomalies (p = 0.22, p = 0.284, respectively). Given the high prevalence of isolated VUR in our cohort, we recommend a screening VCUG or other imaging modality be obtained to evaluate for VUR if initial renal ultrasound shows evidence of obstruction or renal scarring, as well as ongoing evaluation of renal health.

GP ratios were determined on patients' dental casts placed over Levin's grids, whereas W/H ratios were measured directly on the casts and a millimeter ruler to determine these distances. Statistical analysis was performed with Shapiro-Wilk, Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney, Friedman, and Wilcoxon tests (pâ<â0.05). â The incidence of GP in the tooth-to-tooth width proportions was significantly different between groups and more commonly found between centrals and laterals than between laterals and canines. The GP was more likely to be observed in the BRG, UIG, and CG. The results demonstrated that the GP was not found to be present in the majority of the cases treated with maxillary agenesis, regardless of the method of treatment. The mean W/H ratios of the laterals ranged between 0.75 and 0.90. â Although the GP may be a useful diagnostic guide, it was not observed in the majority of esthetic outcomes of patients treated with maxillary LI agenesis in this study. The assessment of the golden proportion and width/height ratio of upper anterior teeth in patients with upper lateral incisor agenesis treated with either implants or tooth re-contouring may assist dentists and\n\nA Case of Distal Vaginal Agenesis Presenting with Recurrent Urinary Tract Infection and Pyuria in a Prepubertal Girl.\n\nPubMed\n\nDural, Ozlem; Ugurlucan, Funda Gungor; Yasa, Cenk; Bastu, Ercan; Eren, Hulya; Yuksel, Bahar; Celik, Serdal; Akhan, Suleyman Engin\n\n2017-02-01\n\nIsolated distal vaginal agenesis is a rare anomaly and mostly becomes symptomatic after menarche. We describe an unusual presentation of this anomaly in a prepubertal girl. An 11-year-old prepubertal girl presented with recurrent urinary tract infection, pyuria, and right-sided renal agenesis. The findings of perineal inspection, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging were consistent with a distal vaginal agenesis with pyometrocolpos. Discharging pyometrocolpos with dissection of the atretic portion and a pull-through vaginoplasty were performed. A cystoscopy showed no sign of a vesicovaginal or uterine fistula. This rare presentation of distal vaginal agenesis reminds us that congenital malformations of the female genital tract should be considered in patients with congenital anomalies of the urinary system and/or recurrent urinary tract infection, even during the prepubertal period.

Endoglin, a 180 KDa membrane glycoprotein, is a TGF-Î² co-receptor overexpressed in several models of chronic kidney disease, but its function in renal fibrosis remains uncertain. Two membrane isoforms generated by alternative splicing have been described, L-Endoglin (long) and S-Endoglin (short) that differ from each other in their cytoplasmic tails, being L-Endoglin the most abundant isoform. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of L-Endoglin overexpression in renal tubulo-interstitial fibrosis. For this purpose, a transgenic mouse which ubiquitously overexpresses human L-Endoglin (L-ENG+) was generated and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) was performed in L-ENG+ mice and their wild type (WT) littermates. Obstructed kidneys from L-ENG+ mice showed higher amounts of type I collagen and fibronectin but similar levels of Î±-smooth muscle actin (Î±-SMA) than obstructed kidneys from WT mice. Smad1 and Smad3 phosphorylation were significantly higher in obstructed kidneys from L-ENG+ than in WT mice. Our results suggest that the higher increase of renal fibrosis observed in L-ENG+ mice is not due to a major abundance of myofibroblasts, as similar levels of Î±-SMA were observed in both L-ENG+ and WT mice, but to the higher collagen and fibronectin synthesis by these fibroblasts. Furthermore, in vivo L-Endoglin overexpression potentiates Smad1 and Smad3 pathways and this effect is associated with higher renal fibrosis development.

Renal and genitourinary causes of NIHF are rare and include congenital renal malformations, tumors and ureter-urethra disorders. Herein, two NIHF cases with different renal causes were presented. The first case that had antenatal NIHF was diagnosed neonatal Bartter syndrome. The second case of NIHF with antenatal large cyst in the surrenal gland area required surgery and ectopic renal cyst was diagnosed. To our best of knowledge, these are the first reports of NIHF associated with neonatal Bartter syndrome and ectopic renal cyst in neonates. Although it may be coincidental, these cases suggest that both neonatal Bartter syndrome and unilateral ectopic renal cyst may cause NIHF development in neonates by several different mechanisms. Therefore, these two rare entities should be suspected in cases of NIHF with similar findings.\n\nUnilateral Renal Ischemia as a Model of Acute Kidney Injury and Renal Fibrosis in Cats.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchmiedt, C W; Brainard, B M; Hinson, W; Brown, S A; Brown, C A\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe objectives of this study were to define the acute and chronic effects of 1-hour unilateral in vivo renal ischemia on renal function and histology in cats. Twenty-one adult purpose-bred research cats were anesthetized, and 1 kidney underwent renal artery and vein occlusion for 1 hour. Serum creatinine and urea concentrations, urine protein:creatinine ratio, urine-specific gravity, glomerular filtration rate, hematocrit, platelet concentration and function, and white blood cell count were measured at baseline and variable time points after ischemia. Renal histopathology was evaluated on days 3, 6, 12, 21, 42, and 70 postischemia; changes in smooth muscle actin and interstitial collagen were examined. Following ischemia, whole animal glomerular filtration rate was significantly reduced (57% of baseline on day 6; P < .05). At the early time points, the ischemic kidneys exhibited severe acute epithelial necrosis accompanied by evidence of regeneration of tubules predominantly within the corticomedullary junction. At later periods, postischemic kidneys had evidence of tubular atrophy and interstitial inflammation with significantly more smooth muscle actin and interstitial collagen staining and interstitial fibrosis when compared with the contralateral control kidneys. This study characterizes the course of ischemic acute kidney injury in cats and demonstrates that ischemic acute kidney injury triggers chronic fibrosis, interstitial inflammation, and tubular atrophy in feline kidneys. These late changes are typical of those observed in cats with naturally occurring chronic kidney disease.

Unilateral ureteric stone patients who visited our hospital's emergency department from December, 2009 to December, 2015 were divided into two groups based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): group I (patients with eGFRÂ â¥Â 60Â ml/min/1.73Â m 2 ) and group II (eGFRÂ <Â 60Â ml/min/1.73Â m 2 ). A univariate comparison between groups I and II was performed. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine factors that influenced renal function. There were 107 patients in group II, which constituted 5.6Â % of the total patients. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, age (pÂ <Â 0.001, odds ratio [OR]Â =Â 1.069, confidence interval [CI]Â =Â 1.049-1.089), hypertension (pÂ <Â 0.001, ORÂ =Â 2.302, CIÂ =Â 1.467-3.611), stone size (pÂ =Â 0.001, ORÂ =Â 1.141, CIÂ =Â 1.057-1.231), white blood cell count (pÂ =Â 0.001, ORÂ =Â 1.132, CIÂ =Â 1.055-1.215) and hematuria (pÂ <Â 0.001, ORÂ =Â 0.383, CIÂ =Â 0.231-0.636) were found to be independent factors for renal impairment. Based on the results of this study, the rate of renal impairment was 6Â % of the unilateral ureteric stone patients without pre-existing CKD. Age and hypertension were found to be independent factors for renal impairment; NSAIDs should be used cautiously or other agents for pain relief such as opioids should be considered in old aged patients with hypertension.\n\nEsthetic Assessment of the Effect of Gingival Exposure in the Smile of Patients with Unilateral and Bilateral Maxillary Incisor Agenesis.\n\nPubMed\n\nPinho, Teresa; Bellot-ArcÃ­s, Carlos; Montiel-Company, JosÃ© MarÃ­a; Neves, Manuel\n\n2015-07-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to determine the dental esthetic perception of the smile of patients with maxillary lateral incisor agenesis (MLIA); the perceptions were examined pre- and post-treatment. Esthetic determinations were made with regard to the gingival exposure in the patients' smile by orthodontists, general dentists, and laypersons. Three hundred eighty one people (80 orthodontists, 181 general dentists, 120 laypersons) rated the attractiveness of the smile in four cases before and after treatment, comprising two cases with unilateral MLIA and contralateral microdontia and two with bilateral MLIA. For each case, the buccal photograph was adjusted using a computer to apply standard lips to create high, medium, and low smiles. A numeric scale was used to measure the esthetic rating perceived by the judges. The resulting arithmetic means were compared using an ANOVA test, a linear trend, and a Student's t-test, applying a significance level of p < 0.05. The predictive capability of the variables, unilateral, or bilateral MLIA, symmetry of the treatment, gingival exposure of the smile, group, and gender were assessed using a multivariable linear regression model. In the pre- and post-treatment cases, medium smile photographs received higher scores than the same cases with high or low smiles, with significant differences between them. In all cases, orthodontists were the least-tolerant evaluation group (assigning lowest scores), followed by general dentists. In a predictive linear regression model, bilateral MLIA was the more predictive variable in pretreatment cases. The gingival exposure of the smile was a predictive variable in post-treatment cases only. The medium-height smile was considered to be more attractive. In all cases, orthodontists gave the lowest scores, followed by general dentists. Laypersons and male evaluators gave the highest scores. Symmetrical treatments scored higher than asymmetrical treatments.

Retrospective cross-sectional study. Children with unilateral clefts of the lip, with or without cleft palate. Anthropometric lip measurements, made immediately prior to lip repair, were available for each patient. The presence of dental anomalies in the permanent dentition was assessed radiographically. The presence of associations between anthropometric lip measurements and prevalence rates of different dental anomalies were determined using logistic regression analyses. In the 122 included patients, the cleft lateral lip element was deficient in height in 80% and in transverse length in 84% of patients. Patients with more deficient cleft side lateral lip height and less deficient cleft side lateral lip transverse length were more likely to present with cleft side maxillary lateral incisor agenesis. On the other hand, patients with a less deficient cleft side lateral lip height and more deficient cleft side lateral lip transverse length were more likely to present with a cleft side supernumerary maxillary lateral incisor. When looking only at incomplete clefts, the cleft side lateral lip transverse length deficiency was more predictive of the presence of supernumerary maxillary lateral incisors (P = .030), while for complete clefts, the cleft side lateral lip height deficiency was more predictive of the presence of maxillary lateral incisor agenesis (P = .035). In patients with unilateral clefts, cleft lip anthropometrics have a predictive role in determining the occurrence of dental anomalies.\n\n[Gallbladder agenesis. Case report].\n\nPubMed\n\nCavazos-GarcÃ­a, Ricardo; DÃ­az-Elizondo, JosÃ© Antonio; Flores-Villalba, Eduardo; RodrÃ­guez-GarcÃ­a, HÃ©ctor Alejandro\n\n2015-01-01\n\nGallbladder agenesis is a very rare congenital abnormality of the biliary tract. The diagnosis is made during surgery, because all preoperative studies have failed to identify this malformation. The purpose of this article is to present a case of gallbladder agenesis diagnosed during surgery, its management, and a review of the literature. The case involves a sixty-two year- old female, referring to repeated biliary colic symptoms. The abdominal ultrasound diagnosed cholelithiasis. It was impossible to identify the gallbladder during surgery. Diagnosis was confirmed by intra-operative cholangiography. Preoperative diagnostic workup has failed to recognise patients with gallbladder agenesis. It is currently recommended to abandon the surgery once this diagnosis is suspected and confirm it by a cholangio-magnetic resonance scan in order to avoid a bile duct injury. Agenesis of the gallbladder is a rare congenital abnormality of the biliary tree. Every surgeon must keep this rare entity in mind when a \"difficult dissection\" or an anatomic variant is identified during surgery, and make use of an intra-operative cholangiography, mainly to prevent a bile duct injury.

Tooth agenesis is complex, and variations in about a dozen genes have been reported as contributing to the etiology. Here, we combined whole-exome sequencing, array-based genotyping, and linkage analysis to identify putative pathogenic variants in candidate disease genes for tooth agenesis in 10 multiplex Turkish families. Novel homozygous and heterozygous variants in LRP6, DKK1, LAMA3, and COL17A1 genes, as well as known variants in WNT10A, were identified as likely pathogenic in isolated tooth agenesis. Novel variants in KREMEN1 were identified as likely pathogenic in 2 families with suspected syndromic tooth agenesis. Variants in more than 1 gene were identified segregating with tooth agenesis in 2 families, suggesting oligogenic inheritance. Structural modeling of missense variants suggests deleterious effects to the encoded proteins. Functional analysis of an indel variant (c.3607+3_6del) in LRP6 suggested that the predicted resulting mRNA is subject to nonsense-mediated decay. Our results support a major role for WNT pathways genes in the etiology of tooth agenesis while revealing new candidate genes. Moreover, oligogenic cosegregation was suggestive for complex inheritance and potentially complex gene product interactions during development, contributing to improved understanding of the genetic etiology of familial tooth agenesis.\n\nGallbladder Agenesis with Refractory Choledocholithiasis.\n\nPubMed\n\nTjaden, Jamie; Patel, Kevin; Aadam, Aziz\n\n2015-01-01\n\nCongenital agenesis of the gallbladder is a rare anomaly which is usually asymptomatic and found incidentally. In some cases, however, patients are symptomatic. Common symptoms include right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Jaundice is present in some symptomatic cases and is due to associated choledocholithiasis (Fiaschetti et al. 2009). In this case, a 63-year-old female presents with jaundice and episodic right upper quadrant abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting. Bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase were found to be markedly elevated. Upper endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) revealed choledocholithiasis, and the patient required multiple endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) sessions before successful extraction of all stones. Subsequent surgical exploration revealed congenital agenesis of the gallbladder. Although this is a rare finding, patients with agenesis of the gallbladder are at increased risk of developing de novo choledocholithiasis which may be challenging to extract.\n\nAgenesis of the dorsal pancreas\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSchnedl, Wolfgang J; Piswanger-Soelkner, Claudia; Wallner, Sandra J; Krause, Robert; Lipp, Rainer W\n\n2009-01-01\n\nDuring the last 100 years in medical literature, there are only 54 reports, including the report of Pasaoglu et al (World J Gastroenterol 2008; 14: 2915-2916), with clinical descriptions of agenesis of the dorsal pancreas in humans. Agenesis of the dorsal pancreas, a rare congenital pancreatic malformation, is associated with some other medical conditions such as hyperglycemia, abdominal pain, pancreatitis and a few other diseases. In approximately 50% of reported patients with this congenital malformation, hyperglycemia was demonstrated. Evaluation of hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus in all patients with agenesis of the dorsal pancreas including description of fasting blood glucose, oral glucose tolerance test, glycated hemoglobin and medical treatment would be a future goal. Since autosomal dominant transmission has been suggested in single families, more family studies including imaging technologies with demonstration of the pancreatic duct system are needed for evaluation of this disease. With this letter to the editor, we aim to increase available information for the better understanding of this rare disease.

UUO model was induced by ligating the left ureter in rats. The rats were treated with 125 mg/(kg.d) fluorofenidone by gastric gavage in the fluorofenidone group at 24 h before the operation, and the rats were treated with the identical dose of 0.5% sodium carboxyl methyl cellulose (CMC-Na) in the other 2 groups. The rats were sacrificed at 14 days after UUO. Pathological changes of the renal tissue were observed by HE and Masson staining, the mRNA expressions of Col I, Col III, Î±-SMA, PDGF and CTGF were detected by real-time PCR, and the protein expressions of Col I, Col III, PDGF and CTGF were detected by immunohistochemical staining.â© Results: The renal interstitial damage index, relative collagen area and mRNA and protein expressions of Col I and Col III in the renal tissues of the rats in the UUO group significantly increased (P<0.05), and fluorofenidone could reduce these indexes (P<0.05). Compared with the sham-operated group, the protein expressions of Î±-SMA, PDGF, CTGF and the mRNA expressions of PDGF and CTGF in the renal tissues of the rats in the UUO group were increased, but fluorofenidone could decrease the protein expressions of Î±-SMA, PDGF, CTGF and the mRNA expressions of PDGF and CTGF (P<0.05).â© Conclusion: Fluorofenidone (125 mg/kg.d) could attenuate renal interstitial fibrosis through inhibition of fibroblast proliferation, myofibroblastic activation, PDGF and CTGF expression.\n\nPitfalls in diagnosis and management of distal vaginal agenesis: 10-year experience at a single centre.\n\nPubMed\n\nUgur, M G; Balat, O; Ozturk, E; Bekerecioglu, M; Dikensoy, E\n\n2012-07-01\n\nTo discuss common pitfalls in diagnosis and management of distal vaginal agenesis, and summarize 10 years of experience among 11 patients using an interposition full-thickness graft and fibrin glue. Eleven patients with distal vaginal agenesis were evaluated and managed with an interposition full-thickness graft to bridge the gap between the upper vagina and the introitus. Associated renal abnormalities and complications including infection, total lack of skin graft take, stress urinary incontinence, partial graft loss, vaginal stricture and graft uptake were all investigated. The mean age of the patients was 12.91 (standard deviation 1.22) years. All patients had primary amenorrhoea, cryptomenorrhea, and cyclical or constant pelvic pain. None of the patients had associated urological abnormalities, and there were no cases of infection, total lack of skin graft take, stress urinary incontinence, partial graft loss or vaginal stricture. Graft uptake was 100% in 10 of the 11 patients. Four patients have subsequently married and report a satisfactory sex life. Accurate diagnosis of distal vaginal agenesis and careful pre-operative set-up, including evaluation of associated anomalies, bowel preparation, available vaginal stents and a multidisciplinary approach for the potential need for grafts, may be key to success.

The present study investigated the nephrotoxicity of ibandronate and zoledronate in a 1.5:1 dose ratio, as used in clinical practice and compared the nephrotoxicity in rats with normal and with mildly to moderately impaired renal function. We compared rats with normal renal function (SHAM) and with impaired renal function after unilateral nephrectomy (UNX), treated either with ibandronate 1.5mg/kg, zoledronate 1mg/kg or placebo once (1Ã) or nine (9Ã) times. Renal function and markers of tubular toxicity were measured over a 27 week period. After last bisphosphonate treatment the rats were sacrificed and kidneys examined histologically. All bisphosphonate treated animals showed a significant tubular toxicity, which was temporary except in the ZOL-UNX-9Ã-group. Also the renal function was only transiently reduced except in the ZOL-UNX-9Ã-group. Histologically, bisphosphonate treatment led to cortical tubuloepithelial degeneration/necrosis and medullary tubuloepithelial swelling which were slightly more pronounced in ibandronate treated animals, when compared to zoledronate treated animals, especially with impaired renal function. In contrast to the previous study we found a similar nephrotoxicity of ibandronate and zoledronate in rats with normal renal function. In rats with impaired renal function the peak of toxicity had not even been fully reached until end of experiment in the zoledronate treated animals. The peak of toxicity seems to be more severe and delayed in rats with impaired renal function compared with rats with normal renal function. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract A better understanding of the inflammatory process associated with renal ischaemiaâreperfusion (IR) injury may be clinically important. In this study we examined the role of the kidney in production of inflammatory mediators by analysing renal lymph after 30Â min unilateral occlusion of renal artery followed by 120Â min reperfusion, as well as the effect of IR on size selectivity for proteins in both glomerular and peritubular capillaries. All measured mediators increased dramatically in renal hilar lymph, plasma and renal cortical tissue samples and returned to control levels after 120Â min reperfusion. The responses were differentiated; interleukinâ1Î², monocyte chemoattractant proteinâ1 and leptin were markedly increased in plasma before reperfusion, reflecting an extrarenal response possibly induced by afferent renal nerve activity from the ischaemic kidney. Tumour necrosis factorâÎ±Â was the only mediator showing elevated lymphâtoâplasma ratio following 30Â min reperfusion, indicating that most cytokines were released directly into the bloodstream. The IRâinduced rise in cytokine levels was paralleled by a significant increase in high molecular weight plasma proteins in both lymph and urine.

Nine images were digitally modified from the same frontal intraoral photograph to simulate various treatment options for space closure in MLIA. A questionnaire was submitted to laypersons (303), general dentists (215), prosthodontists (55) and orthodontists (81). Statistical tests with a significance level of P<0.05 were used. The views of MLIA treatment judged to be most attractive showed unilateral dental and gingival reshaping. All study groups considered the simple dental reshaping of the mesial edge of the canine to be attractive. In the analysis of the images grouped together for both unilateral and bilateral MLIA, the view showing dental and gingival reshaping was considered the most attractive whereas unmodified mesialization was considered the least attractive. Regarding the space closure treatments, although all groups regarded simple dental reshaping of the canine to be attractive, the dental professionals considered gingival and crown reshaping to be more esthetic. In contrast, laypersons were not significantly responsive to this dental and gingival modification as compared to only slight reshaping of the mesial edge of the cusp of the mesialized canine in MLIA.

A sample of 374 patients with agenesis of at least 1 third molar was divided into 4 groups according to the third-molar agenesis pattern, and a control group of 98 patients without third-molar agenesis was randomly selected from the patient archives. Panoramic radiographs and cast models were used to determine the associated dental anomalies, such as hypodontia, hyperdontia, impaction, dilaceration, microdontia, ectopic eruption, transposition, and transmigration. The Pearson chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used to determine the differences in the distribution of the associated dental anomalies among the groups. The prevalence of agenesis of other teeth (11.2%, n = 42) was significantly greater in our study sample (groups 1-4) than in the control group (group 5) (4.1%, n = 4; P <0.05). When we compared the groups according to the various third-molar agenesis patterns, we found that agenesis of other teeth was more common in patients with agenesis of 3 and 4 third molars. In addition, the patients with agenesis of 4 third molars exhibited maxillary lateral-incisor microdontia more frequently. Another important finding was a higher prevalence of total dental anomalies in patients with agenesis of 3 and 4 third molars compared with the control group. Permanent tooth agenesis, microdontia of maxillary lateral incisors, and total dental anomalies are more frequently associated with agenesis of 4 third molars than with the presence of third molars.

The material of the present study included the records of the 1964 orthodontic patients. Panoramic radiographs and dental casts were used to analyze other associated eight dental anomalies, including agenesis of other teeth, dens invaginatus, dens evaginatus, peg shaped MLI, taurodontism, pulp stone, root dilaceration and maxillary canine impaction. Out of the 1964 patients examined, 90 were found to have agenesis of MLI, representing a prevalence of 4.6%. The most commonly found associated-anomalies were agenesis of other teeth (23.3%), peg-shaped MLIs (15.6%), taurodontism (42.2%), and dilacerated teeth (18.9%). Permanent tooth agenesis, taurodontism, peg-shaped maxillary lateral incisor, and root dilacerations are frequently associated with maxillary lateral incisor agenesis.\n\nPromoting effects of potassium dibasic phosphate on early-stage renal carcinogenesis in unilaterally nephrectomized rats treated with N-ethyl-N-hydroxyethylnitrosamine.\n\nPubMed\n\nHiasa, Y; Konishi, N; Nakaoka, S; Nakamura, T; Nishii, K; Ohshima, M\n\n1992-07-01\n\nThe effects of potassium dibasic phosphate (PDP), potassium aluminum sulfate (PAS) and copper sulfate (CS) on early-stage renal carcinogenesis were investigated in unilaterally nephrectomized male Wistar rats after N-ethyl-N-hydroxyethylnitrosamine (EHEN) administration.

A total of 18Â male Wistar rats were randomly divided into the following 3 groups: The Sham group (n=6), the UUO group (n=6), and the UTI group (n=6). In the UUO and UTI groups, the left ureter was ligated to establish a UUO model. Starting from day 1 after surgery, an intervention treatment was performed using normal saline (1Â ml/kg/d) and UTI (40,000Â unit/kg/d). On day 7 after surgery, 6 rats from each group were sacrificed. In the Sham group, the left ureter was only freed, not ligated; after 7Â days of abdominal closure, all of the rats were sacrificed. Blood samples were collected prior to sacrificing the animals to measure the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr). The incidence of renal interstitial lesions on the obstruction side was observed by hematoxylin and eosin, and Masson staining. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, and immunohistochemical detection of apoptosis regulator BaxÂ (Bax), apoptosis regulator Bclâ2 (Bclâ2) and caspaseâ3 were performed to observe the presence of renal tubular epithelial cell apoptosis. The UTI did not have a significant influence on the mouse BUN and Scr levels in any of the groups (P>0.05). Compared with that in the Sham group, renal tissue injury in the UUO group was significantly aggravated with renal tubular dilation, epithelial cell atrophy, renal interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrous tissue hyperplasia (P<0.01). Furthermore, the renal tubular epithelial TUNEL+ cell number and Bax and caspaseâ3 levels were increased, and the expression of Bclâ2 was decreasedÂ (P<0.01).

Male ApoE(-/-) mice underwent sham surgery (n=16) or had partial ligation of the right renal artery (n=41) with the ligature being removed 4 days later (D4LR; n=6), 8 days later (D8LR; n=11), or left in place for 90 days (chronic RAS; n=24). Ligature removal at 4 or 8 days resulted in improved renal blood flow, decreased plasma angiotensin II levels, a return of systolic blood pressure to baseline, and increased plasma levels of neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin. Chronic RAS resulted in increased lipid staining in the aortic arch (33.2% [24.4, 47.5] vs 11.6% [6.1, 14.2]; P<0.05) and descending thoracic aorta (10.2% [6.4, 25.9] vs 4.9% [2.8, 7.8]; P<0.05), compared to sham surgery. There was an increased amount of aortic arch lipid staining in the D8LR group (22.7% [22.1, 32.7]), compared to sham-surgery, but less than observed with chronic RAS. Lipid staining in the aortic arch was not increased in the D4LR group, and lipid staining in the descending aorta was not increased in either the D8LR or D4LR groups. There was less macrophage expression in infrarenal aortic atheroma in the D4LR and D8LR groups compared to the chronic RAS group. Restoration of renal blood flow at either 4 or 8 days after unilateral RAS had a beneficial effect on systolic blood pressure, aortic lipid deposition, and atheroma inflammation. Â© 2016 The Authors.

Pretreatment records of 300 orthodontic patients (140 males and 160 females, 219 Malaysian Malay and 81 Chinese, average age was 16.27Â±4.59) were used. Third-molar agenesis was calculated with respect to race, genders, number of missing teeth, jaws, skeletal malocclusion patterns and sagittal maxillomandibular jaw dimensions. The Pearson chi-square test and ANOVA was performed to determine potential differences. Associations between various factors and M3 presence/agenesis groups were assessed using logistic regression analysis. The percentages of subjects with 1 or more M3 agenesis were 30%, 33% and 31% in the Malaysian Malay, Chinese and total population, respectively. Overall prevalence of M3 agenesis in male and female was equal (P>0.05). The frequency of the agenesis of M3s is greater in maxilla as well in the right side (P>0.05). The prevalence of M3 agenesis in those with a Class III and Class II malocclusion was relatively higher in Malaysian Malay and Malaysian Chinese population respectively. Using stepwise regression analyses, significant associations were found between Mx (P<0.05) and ANB (P<0.05) and M3 agenesis. This multivariate analysis suggested that Mx and ANB were significantly correlated with the M3 presence/agenesis.

A total of 1043 patients' records were analyzed with panoramic radiographs and cephalograms. Congenitally missing third molars were assessed with respect to gender, jaw, and side, and assessed in various types of facial morphology. Linear, angular, and proportional cephalometric measurements were analyzed and compared among the samples. For the evaluation of results, the following statistics were used: the Pearson Ï 2 test, one-way ANOVA, and the Student-Newman-Keuls method. The overall prevalence of third molar agenesis was 28.7%. Missing third molars were more common in the maxilla and on the right side, while the difference was not statistically significant (PÂ >Â 0.05) between genders. Every hypodontia group had a smaller SN-GoGn angle, Y-axis-FH angle, and a larger S-Go/N-Me ratio. The group with third molar agenesis in both jaws had smaller SNA and Wits values. The frequency of third molar agenesis in subjects with a Class II malocclusion was significantly lower than in other types of malocclusion (PÂ <Â 0.05), and the incidence of third molar agenesis in hypodivergentÂ growth pattern was higher than in other patterns (PÂ <Â 0.05). The results demonstrate a possible association between third molar agenesis and both sagittal and vertical craniofacial morphology.\n\nRenal manifestations in children with Alagille syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nDi Pinto, Diana; Adragna, Marta\n\n2018-04-01\n\nAlagille syndrome (AS) is a cholestatic disease secondary to scarcity of interlobular bile ducts. It is associated with extrahepatic manifestations, and renal involvement is frequent. To describe the prevalence, type and outcome of renal pathology in children with AS. The presence and outcome of renal pathology was retrospectively studied in 21 children who met AS criteria. Renal pathology was observed in 18 patients (85.7%): (1) ultrasound variations in 7 patients (6 cases of bilateral renal dysplasia and 1 case of renal agenesis); (2) distal renal tubular acidosis in 2 patients; (3) a drop in glomerular filtration and/or proteinuria in 16 patients. The frequency of a drop in glomerular filtration was similar between patients with and without pathological kidney ultrasound findings. Our study confirms a high prevalence of renal involvement, which enhances the importance of diagnosis and renal function follow-up in children with AS.

A retrospective study was performed using panoramic radiographs of 5923 patients, who ranged in age from 10 to 50 years. All radiographs were analyzed by Planmeca RomexisÂ® 3.0 software (Planmeca Oy, Helsinki, Finland). Pearson chi-square and one way ANOVA (Post Hoc) test were conducted. The prevalence of third molar agenesis was 38.4%. The frequency of third molar agenesis was significantly higher in females than males (p <0.025). Third molar agenesis was significantly more prevalent in maxilla as compared to mandible (p <0.007). The prevalence of other dental anomalies was 6.5%, among them hypodontia was 3.1%. Prevalence of third molar agenesis varies in different geographic region. Among the other dental anomalies hypodontia was more prevalent.
