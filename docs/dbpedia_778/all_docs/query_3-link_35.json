it included his first solo No. 1, “Whatever Gets You Thru the Night,” and “#9 Dream”; producer: Lennon (Apple)\n\nOther September releases: “Dancing Machine,” The Jackson 5 … “Heroes Are Hard to Find,” Fleetwood Mac … “Good Old Boys,” Randy Newman … “Love Is Like a Butterfly,” Dolly Parton … “Serenade,” Neil Diamond … “Eldorado,” Electric Light Orchestra … “Sneakin’ Sally Through the Alley,” Robert Palmer … “Wrap Around Joy,” Carole King\n\nOct. 11\n\n“Streetlife Serenade,” Billy Joel — it was hard to follow up “Piano Man,” but he did an admirable job, highlighted by “The Entertainer” and “Los Angelenos,” as well as a pair of instrumentals, “Root Beer Rag” and “The Mexican Connection”; producer: Michael Stewart (Columbia)\n\nOct. 18\n\n“It’s Only Rock ‘n Roll,” The Rolling Stones — the last album to feature guitarist Mick Taylor contained the title track, “Time Waits for No One” and “Ain’t Too Proud to Beg”; producer: The Glimmer Twins (Rolling Stones)\n\nOct. 25\n\n“Crime of the Century,” Supertramp — their third album was a breakout hit in the U.K., powered by “Bloody Well Right,” which didn’t chart in the U.S. until spring 1975;

the album was a surprising Top 5 hit in the U.S.; producers: Florian Schneider, Ralf Hütter (Philips)\n\nNov. 8\n\n“Elton John’s Greatest Hits,” Elton John — it’s noteworthy because it went on to become the best-selling album of 1975, spent 10 weeks at No. 1 in the U.S. and sold more than 24 million copies worldwide; surprisingly, the 10-track set didn’t include “Tiny Dancer” and “Levon” (MCA)\n\n“Sheer Heart Attack,” Queen — their second album of the year was significant because it contained their first U.S. Top 40 hit, “Killer Queen,” plus “Stone Cold Crazy,” “Brighton Rock” and “Flick of the Wrist”; it was a glam-rock tour de force; producers: Roy Thomas Baker, Queen (Elektra)\n\nNov. 15\n\n“Country Life,” Roxy Music — just another sophisticated album from the British art-rock greats; featuring “All I Want Is You” and “The Thrill of It All”; producers: John Punter, Roxy Music (Atco)\n\nNov. 19\n\n“Heart Like a Wheel,” Linda Ronstadt — her fifth solo album might be her best; it was a Grammy nominee for Album of the Year in 1976 and won the Grammy for Best Country Vocal Performance, Female for “I Can’t Help It If I’m Still in Love With You”;

producer: Bob Monaco (ABC)\n\nDec. 9\n\n“Dark Horse,” George Harrison — his fifth solo album came after the dissolution of his marriage to Pattie Boyd; it featured the title track and “Ding Dong, Ding Dong”; producer: Harrison (Apple)\n\nOther December releases: “So What,” Joe Walsh … “A1A,” Jimmy Buffett"
