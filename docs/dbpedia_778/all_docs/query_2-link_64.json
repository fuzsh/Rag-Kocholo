        "text": "The program consists of a multifaceted lineup, where energy and quality overcome the classic fractures among music genres and reconcile the most far-flung corners of the musical spectrum.\n\nReflecting a multiplicity of influences and tastes, the festival is by its very nature an event for music lovers, open minds and curious ears.\n\nFrom energetic and genre-transgressive band performances under the summer sun to delicate listening sessions, late-night electroacoustic solo performances, and unconventional dance music, Gaswerk Music Days is designed to offer an all-encompassing radical live music experience.\n\nWe are proud of each and every name on the lineup!\n\nCheck the timetables on the dedicated page and secure your tickets!\n\nAFRICAN HEAD CHARGE\n\nWATCH A VIDEO\n\nCo-founded by the legendary underground producer Adrian Sherwood, African Head Charge is a globally acclaimed, pioneering dub-reggae ensemble led by original co-founder, master percussionist and royal rastaman, Bonjo Iyabhinghi Noah.\n\nPulsating with tribal drum beats and chanting from the soul of Africa, African Head Charge fuse together primal rhythms with heavy psychedelic dub, roots reggae and 21st-century electronica. Formed originally as a studio project in 1981, the London-based collective has gone on to achieve cult status, creating 13 albums and gracing stages across the world. After the release of ‘A Trip to Bolgatanga’ (2023), with a deeper, darker and heavier live sound than ever before, African Head Charge are once again ready to enrapture their global fan base, as well as reach out to a new generation of fans around the world.\n\n(photo credits - Rob Stainforth)\n\nWATCH A VIDEO\n\nCassette Heads is a collective based in Berlin, seamlessly merging the realms of jazz, soul, hip-hop, and beyond. Emerging from the Berlin underground scene in 2020, the multi-international collective has successfully cultivated a community centered around the passion for listening, playing, and sharing music, also extending invitations to artists from around the world. They actively promote weekly shows in the vibrant heart of creative Kreuzberg and host block parties, outdoor raves and staged festival takeovers across Europe. In addition to their roles as promoters, the backing band, and hosts of the jam, Cassette Heads has collaborated with renowned artists such as RC & The Gritz (Erykah Badu's band), Allysha Joy, Wayne Snow and Jesper Munk. For our festival, they welcome Australian singer Milan Ring, the duo Machete Horns (with trumpeter Daniel “El Congo” Allen Oberto and saxophonist Regis “KinRe” Molina), and many more guests moving on and off the stage under the watchful eye of host Mysha.\n\nCINNA PEYGHAMY\n\nWATCH A VIDEO\n\nCinna Peyghamy is a composer and sound artist, born in France to Iranian parents. He is going to take us on a mesmerizing journey with his live act that marries the traditional resonance of tombak with the avant-garde possibilities of a modular synthesizer. His improvised sequences unfold seamlessly, intertwining Persian percussion and electronic innovation. Peyghamy’s mastery of the tombak provides a rhythmic foundation that resonates with cultural depth, while the modular synthesizer adds an ethereal, futuristic layer, creating a harmonious blend that defies genre boundaries.\n\nCONTAGIOUS\n\nWATCH A VIDEO\n\nFounded in 2018 by two innovative voices from the Berlin improvisation scene, Andrea Neumann and Sabine Ercklentz, and the accomplished DJ Mieko Suzuki, Contagious is a mixture of avant-garde experimentation and electronic music. Contagious aren't just a trio. They are a whole organism. The guts from the inside of a piano, the tonearms of turntables, the puffing of a trumpet, the pulse of various effect processors and the interaction of Neumann, Ercklentz and Suzuki grow together, forming an entity, which is continuously developing. Their drive is improvisation. Their ideal state is the constant tension between action and reaction, between electronics, acoustics and experiment.\n\n(photo credits - Steinhaeuser)\n\nDAS ENDE DER LIEBE\n\nWATCH A VIDEO\n\nConceived as a counterproposal to our intricate relationship with time in the modern world, Das Ende der Liebe’s music addresses the tension between the ever-demanding pace of contemporary life and our subcon-scious yearning for moments of reflection and contemplation. Their music pieces are deep sonic spaces that invite listeners to explore the nuances of time, reevaluate and transform their perception of it, and surrender themselves to the band’s magically tempus-stretching aural supernovae. Andreas Völk (Guitar, Voice, Live Beat- & Sound Processing), Laurenz Gemmer (Yamaha CP70, Ableton Live), Kenn Hartwig (Bass, Nintendo Gameboy) and Thomas Sauerborn (Drums, Synths) are vibrational sound alchemists who crafted a new universe, ever-expanding, built from electronics, acoustics, psychedelics and groove since the year of the portal, 2014.\n\nGONZO M + MADA DUDI\n\nLISTEN\n\nGonzo M, a luminary in the avant-garde music scene, has carved a niche for himself as a pivotal figure in Berlin's musical tapestry. Exhibiting masterful prowess on the guitar, trumpet, and the rare and captivating combination of theremin with a Wah-Wah pedal, Gonzo M crafts auditory experiences that are both mesmerizing and groundbreaking. His compositions, steeped in the psychedelic and experimental legacy of Krautrock, emerge through the distinct genre he has pioneered, known as Gump. For this particular concert, Gonzo M will be supported by Mada Dudi, whose extensive experience at the Volksbühne Berlin will provide a theatrical enhancement to the performance. Ted Law will be on drums and Bo Keijmel on bass guitar, both original members of the band, ensuring a powerful and cohesive rhythm section. Additionally, Taymour Khajah will make a guest appearance on the saxophone, adding a rich, melodic layer to the ensemble's sound.\n\nJAMES HOLDEN\n\nWATCH A VIDEO\n\nJames Holden is an electronic musician and tinkerer who has worn many hats across his twenty-year musical career: producer, remixer, DJ, record label boss, synth maestro, band leader, mix engineer, software developer and all round jack of all vaguely musical trades. Charting a haphazard course somewhere between unashamed dilettante and virtuosic polymath, Holden is an artist who seems to find it difficult to settle, no sooner finding himself momentarily aligned with one musical milieu (trance, progressive house, minimal techno, IDM, synth, jazz...) before his latest set of explorations lead him on to pastures new.\n\n(photo credits - Laura Lewis)\n\nLES EPHEMERES\n\nWATCH A VIDEO\n\nles ephemeres perform on a modular setup, extended by diverse and intriguing sound sources. They are fascinated with the evanescent and visceral symbiosis between movement, touch, space, and sound. The duo is composed of Katharina Bévand (sound artist and performer with an M.A. in Sound Studies) and Stéphane Lefrancois (experienced DJ and producer of hardware-based deep house, techno grooves, and infectious melodies). Taking off in Gaswerksiedlung Berlin in 2021, the collaboration already showcased several sensational live sets - both on the listening and on the dancing side, and produced a deeply satisfying EP titled ‘Mazapatec’. Katharina's thriving and bewitching soundscapes, along with Stéphane's abstract and organic rhythms, conjure haunting and bizarre fleeting sonic spells.\n\nLORD OF THE AMAZING PANTHER\n\nWATCH A VIDEO\n\nIn our hearts, Lord of the Amazing Panther emerges as Berlin's ultimate musical revelation! With this project, Schlippenbach (DJ Illvibe) in particular showcases his own musical vision for the first time. This supergroup storms the scene with a powerhouse formation featuring Beat Halberschmidt on bass, Dirk Berger on guitar, and the dynamic newcomer Noah Fürbringer (Schmyt) on drums. Rising from the esteemed ranks of Lychee Lassi, they've honed a sound that marries relentless beats, fearless improvisation, and an array of influences with unparalleled precision. With their electrifying presence and uncompromising approach, “Lord of The Amazing Panther are the answer to everything” (DJ Koze).\n\nMARINA HERLOP\n\nWATCH A VIDEO\n\nMarina Herlop shed the classical trappings of her accomplished previous albums ‘Nanook’ and ‘Babasha’ to emerge in vibrant, polymorphous form on her hypnotizing 2022 album ‘Pripyat’ released by PAN. With ‘Pripyat’ the Catalonian, conservatory-trained composer, vocalist, and pianist channelled her environment in truly posthuman form; performing alien vocal acrobatics, drawing inspiration from Carnatic music of Southern India, while planting a diversity of sonic seeds which blossom brilliantly in her sumptuous garden of chimeric compositions, produced for the first time exclusively electronically. On October 27, 2023 she brings these gestures full circle with the release of her next LP, ‘Nekkuja’. Herlop has been hitting the road hard the last two years, blowing audiences away all over the globe including performances at Primavera, CTM, Mutek, Dekmantel, Le Guess Who?, and Unsound amongst other notable events with many upcoming shows.\n\n(photo credits - Silvio Deiaco)\n\nMARTA DE PASCALIS\n\nWATCH A VIDEO\n\nMarta De Pascalis’ sonic world acts as an uncanny translator that freezes and expands emotions, conveying them into unique soundscapes. Her solo works employ analog, fm synthesis, and a tape-loop system, whereby she carves waveforms to shape cathartic sound bodies. She has performed at several festivals and venues, notably Berlin Atonal, Museo Reina Sofia, Biennale di Venezia, Berghain, Volksbühne, Café Oto, Mutek Festival.\n\n‘Sky Flesh’, her latest album, has been published on Caterina Barbieri’s light-years imprint.\n\n(photo credits - George Nebieridze)\n\nMAURICE LOUCA + AYMAN ASFOUR\n\nWATCH A VIDEO\n\nMaurice Louca is an Egyptian musician and Composer who recently released his fourth studio album ‘Saet El Hazz’ (Northern Spy/Sub Rosa, 2021) and myriad other releases for bands and collaboration he is part of including the Dwarfs of East Agouza (with Alan Bishop & Sam Shalabi), Karkhana and Lekhfa (with Maryam Saleh & Tamer Abu Ghazaleh). Over the past decade, he has toured extensively in North America, Europe, North Africa and the Arab world, as well as collaborated across different art forms, composing for dance, visual art and theatre. One of the most gifted, prolific and adventurous figures on Egypt's thriving experimental arts scene, Louca has in recent years garnered a global reputation through solo albums and an expanding, evolving lineup of genre-defying collaborations - amongst which the one with violinist Ayman Asfour.\n\n(photo credits - Peter Houaiss)\n\nNATALIA ESCOBAR\n\nLISTEN\n\nNatalia Escobar is a Colombian interdisciplinary artist whose practice encompasses moving images, sound, performance, and installations. Her pieces address themes such as Andean phenomenology, identity, the oneiric, and memory. Her work has been exhibited at prestigious venues including the Museo Nacional in Bogotá, HKW and Berlinesche Galerie in Berlin, CCD in Mexico City, and La Casa Encendida in Madrid.\n\nEscobar's DJ sets blend various genres and styles into captivating sonic narratives. Each set becomes a rich landscape of sound, intricately woven with storytelling and emotional resonance, mirroring the depth of her artistic vision. She has performed and DJed at renowned venues and events including Saüle am Berghain, Bayo, Neue National Galerie, Kiezsalon, Funkhaus, Madeira Dig, Syn/cussion Festival, and She Makes Noise Festival, among others.\n\n(photo credits - Salar Kheradpejouuh)\n\nNEWEN AFROBEAT\n\nWATCH A VIDEO\n\nHailing from Chile, Newen Afrobeat emerges as a pioneering force in the Afrobeat genre within the country and beyond. With 5 studio albums to their name, including the iconic EPs titled “Newen Plays Fela”, they have solidified their position as one of the leading figures in this musical movement. The band has garnered respect from Afrobeat legends such as Tony Allen, Femi Kuti, Cheick Tidiane Seck, Seun Kuti, Oghene Kologbo, and Dele Sosimi, among others, who have embraced Newen Afrobeat's fresh and distinctive style. As they celebrate 15 years of musical journey, Newen Afrobeat unveils their fifth album, “GRIETAS”, once again showcasing their ability to blend the rhythms of Latin America and Africa, complemented by their energetic and colourful stage presence. Their commitment to delivering socially conscious messages remains a cornerstone of their music, evident in every lyric.\n\n(photo credits - Macarena Miño)\n\nPERERA ELSEWHERE\n\n(DJ set)\n\nWATCH A VIDEO\n\nExperimental pop auteur, Sasha Perera aka Perera Elsewhere is a producer, multi- instrumentalist, songwriter and DJ who has garnered critical acclaim from Pitchfork, NPR, BBC, FADER, Vogue, KCRW and many more. Journeys have punctuated Perera Elsewhere’s life perspective and career, taking her from London’s vibrant club scene to Berlin’s bass experimentalist underground. All of which developed her shapeshifting approach to music. Elsewhere, but always rooted. No matter where Perera has found herself musically–from live shows & DJ sets at institutions such as Berghain, the Guggenheim, the Hamburg and Berlin Philharmonic, Sonar Festival and Boiler Room.\n\n(photo credits - Dhanesh Jayaselan )\n\nPRAED\n\nWATCH A VIDEO\n\nFounded by Raed Yassin and Paed Conca in 2006, PRAED is a band whose musical oeuvre can be described as a mixture​ of Arabic popular music, free jazz, and electronics. Since then, the band has frequented​ numerous international music festivals and toured intensively world-wide, spanning Japan, Egypt, North, Central and South​ Africa, Europe and Canada. The band’s body of work mainly explores the terrain of Arabic popular music (‘Shaabi’) and its interconnectedness with other​ kaleydoscopic and hypnotic musical genres in the world, such as free jazz, space jazz, and psychedelic rock among others.\n\n(photo credits - Tony Elieh)\n\nRABIH BEAINI\n\nWATCH A VIDEO\n\nLebanese-born producer and DJ Rabih Beaini (formerly known as Morphosis) specialises in grainy, imaginative analogue techno. In recent years, however, his Morphine Records label has telescoped in on key (often overlooked) voices in avant-garde electronic and outernational music. Beaini’s genuine musical ability and a range of influences - from krautrock to new wave - seep into his inventive, dark, and emotional productions and immersive DJ sets. These influences also find their way into Beani’s productions with the Upperground Orchestra, a multi-headed improvisational ensemble that explores the terrain between electronica, techno, and improvisational jazz. While his productions join the dots between raw, elementary electronica, and jazz, his Morphine label has put forward an equally forward-thinking selection of techno from the likes of Madteo, Hieroglyphic Being, and Anthony ‘Shake’ Shakir.\n\n(photo credits - Evgeniya Manerova)\n\nRASHAD BECKER\n\nWATCH A VIDEO\n\nRashad Becker’s compositions are multilayered narratives populated by an ensemble of sonic entities, some smug, some shy, some agitators, others ready to surrender. Often there’s a tragic-comical touch, like a cartoon version of what could be a requiem from a dream (or just as much a fertility dance from another dimension).\n\nRecent works include the cycle Traditional Music Of Notional Species released across two volumes on PAN, and a multi-part work called Based On A True Story that derives scores from historical occurrences in a sort of ‘sonic staging’. He has been commissioned by New York-based ensemble Alarm Will Sound, Berlin string ensemble Kaleidoskop and leading German theatre company Berliner Ensemble.\n\n(photo credits - Anna De Smet)\n\nROMÉO POIRIER\n\nWATCH A VIDEO\n\nKeeping the ever-present influence of the sea in focus, French-born, Brussels-based artist Roméo Poirier projects himself to a fantasised coastline, imagining a landscape in flux, continuously reconfigured by the movement of water and those that inhabit its space.\n\nBass tones swell and retreat, colliding with smothered jazz notes and hazily layered, foaming textual abstraction, yet the pacing and rhythm remain loose and organic. Sounds are developed patiently, and naturally sculpted to fit the palette. Elements processed through water with a range of eccentric, yet pioneering techniques that lend to a unique sense of cohesion and textual integration throughout.\n\n(photo credits - Anna De Smet)\n\nROUGE MÉCANIQUE\n\nWATCH A VIDEO\n\nRouge Mécanique is the solo project and label of Romain Azzaro - a stable presence in Berlin’s music scene for years, co-curator of our festival in 2023, guest curator this year, and mastermind of Club Bardo.\n\nArmed with a Telecaster and dreams of a deserted city, the musician sauntered onto the runway in 2013 with the highly acclaimed Rekids’ sublabel EP ‘Witches’ and has since then produced 2 albums moving across from post-punk and a cinematic style of rhythmic strut and psychedelia. Still, labels are too tight to pretend to frame. His productions are the 5am blues party, elemental and perpetually mobile; a fresh cut in the groove of sassed-out disco and rock-n-roll that pays homage to the digital pulse.\n\nSAEKO KILLY\n\nWATCH A VIDEO\n\nSaeko Killy is a Berlin-based DJ, vocalist, and producer.

With her friends, she hosts and curates the interdisciplinary Berlin event series Emergent Bass, which focuses on the historical awareness of cultural contexts of music and celebrates and uplifts the Afro-diasporic influences in underground club culture. She’s innovative, she’s skilful, and she’s the smiling antithesis of genre cliques and sour scene elitists and sprinkles positivity over the darkest bass. What you hear is all you need to know. And what you’ll hear from Sarah Farina’s sets and music productions are seamlessly blended bass-heavy frequencies and futuristic beats with fearless forays through the hardcore continuum and beyond. It’s inclusive, forward-thinking and unrestrained. It’s a genre-rejecting style that she’s named Rainbow Bass. Check out her latest release.\n\n(photo credits - LGHT DRPS)\n\nSPILL (TONY BUCK + MAGDA MAYAS)\n\nWATCH A VIDEO\n\nSpill is the Berlin-based duo of Magda Mayas on piano/clavinet and Tony Buck on drums/percussion. Since its inception in 2002, the duo has released numerous albums, also the fruit of proficient music residencies between Berlin and California.\n\nStealing from some of their album reviews: “It’s improvised music, where spacia-lisation is an important compo-sitional tool as instrument selection. Sounds ring out and reverberate from across the stereo field. Crescendos build with earth-shattering significance, enveloping the piece before dispersing providing space before the next incursion forward”. And: “Harmonics seeped from all that they struck, scraped and wrung out producing a luscious ebb and flow of complex layers. Lost in the evocations of this piece, I imagined at one point that I was hearing the everyday sounds of a small town, notated and reproduced in musical form.”\n\n(photo credits - Tony Elieh)\n\nTHE HELIOCENTRICS\n\nWATCH A VIDEO\n\nThe Heliocentrics' albums are all confounding pieces of work. Drawing equally from the funk universe of James Brown, the disorienting asymmetry of Sun Ra, the cinematic scope of Ennio Morricone, the sublime fusion of David Axelrod, Pierre Henry's turned-on musique concrète, and Can's beat-heavy Krautrock, they have pointed the way towards a brand new kind of psychedelia, one that could only come from a band of accomplished musicians who were also addicted music devotee. Drummer Malcolm Catto and bassist Jake Ferguson are The Heliocentrics' masterminds and producers - obsessive weirdos in today's musical climate, searching, progressive humans who are often out-of-time with current trends. Over the last two decades, they search for their individual voice in an alternate galaxy where the orbits of funk, jazz, psychedelic, electronic, avant-garde and “ethnic” music all revolve around “The One”.\n\nTHOMASH\n\nWATCH A VIDEO\n\nThomas Haferlach aka Thomash merges machine learning wizardry with music and multimedia art, exploring the realms of psychedelia from artistic and scientific perspectives. He founded Voodoohop, an influential art collective celebrated by São Paulo's art scene. Utilizing generative AI, Thomas crafts new musical expressions that blend high-tech in unexpected and glitchy ways.\n\nBorn in Germany and ripened in the rich cultural milieu of São Paulo for over a decade, Thomash’s music fuses minimalist electronic with the chaotic rhythms of Latin America and the calculated trippiness of Krautrock. His approach is a testament to the joy of creation, focusing on innovative hybrid experiences that bridge diverse cultural and technological landscapes.\n\n(photo credits - Laura Lewis)\n\nTRIANA Y HERMANA JUANA\n\nWATCH A VIDEO\n\nTriana y Hermana Juana is a one-of-a-kind act on the London scene blending elements of Colombian and Caribbean music with jazz and funk. They perform a unique and hypnotizing sound using a\n\nmixture of acoustic and electronic instruments. Following the experimentations at their residencies at Cha Cha and 17 Little Portland Street they have continued to push the boundaries of their sound with the addition of synthesizers, drum machines, and sequencers. The result is an intoxicating mix of psychedelic Latin dance music, accompanied by the sounds of synths, horns, flutes, percussion, and drums.\n\nAt the start of 2024, their long-awaited debut EP their debut singles Calle Union y Maldito Aparato were recorded in one take on tape was released on Panzón Records to much acclaim and found support from Coco Maria on NTS amongst others.\n\nTRIO HEINZ HERBERT\n\nWATCH A VIDEO\n\nThe Swiss outfit Trio Heinz Herbert is composed by Dominic Landolt (e-guitar, fx), Ramon Landolt (synth, sampling), and Mario Hänni (drums, fx). In their words, they “are all attracted to equal rights for sound - the quiet, in harmonic, the zoom in the zoom out, field recording, 4/4, polyrhythms, in sync - out of sync, trying to give each of these ideas or concepts equal significance and using these as a starting point to create music that is structured in a non-traditional way”.\n\nIn February 2024, they release their 5th album ‘Tomorrow Wonderland’ - a propulsive, unfolding and gaudy journey. This is a record that transports us to protean sonic landscapes, situating but stretched and slipping with the trio’s unique time-bending skills. Whilst THH may have started life studying Jazz and electro-acoustic music with mentors Earl Howard and Gerry Hemingway, their ongoing path brings them to squeeze the rich history of electronic music through a sieve, to discover their own strange harmonies, elegant micro-timing, and saturated lush colours.\n\n(photo credits - Caterina Viguera)\n\nZEUG + SCOTT MONTEITH\n\nWATCH A VIDEO\n\nzeug was formed in 2015 consisting of Vladislav Overchuk (bass, vox, percussion) and Udo Loeb (drums). Since then, the band has released 1 Demo record and 4 EPs, had three perilous tours in Central, Eastern and Northern Europe, and is now ready to unleash their debut double-length LP 'Vessel'. In 2020 the band solidified into an intense experimental trio with Vladislav recruiting fresh members Benjamin Nash (guitar, synths, vox) and Lorenzo Barbieri (drums). Between the thunderous and the sublime, embracing freedom of expression and the power of improvisation, zeug's drone-punk knows no bounds. Under these terms, for their performance at Gaswerk Music Days, they find direct alignment with fellow community resident and producer Scott Monteith. Best known under his former stage name Deadbeat, his work over 25 years in the realms of dub and experimental electronic music has drawn invitations from the most respected festivals and clubs the world over. Together they shall most certainly make a uniquely glorious noise worthy of their joint independent histories.\n\n(photo credits - Lena Neumann)"
