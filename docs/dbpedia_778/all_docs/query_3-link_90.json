        "text": "Presenters, producers and staff reveal their musical highlights\n\nAs 2022 draws to a close, Planet Rock presenters, producers and staff reveal their musical highlights of the past 12 months.\n\nWe asked all of them the the same five highlights: what their favourite gig of 2022 was, their rock discovery of the year, their festival highlight, and their favourite song and album of the year. See all the answers – including a few curveballs - below.\n\nAs always, thank you for listening to Planet Rock throughout the year and roll on 2023!\n\nPlanet Rock’s Best of 2022:\n\nMark Jeeves:\n\nWhat was your favourite gig of 2022?\n\nPeter Frampton on his farewell tour. I’ve seen him a few times over the years and it was a bittersweet occasion this time as it’s probably the last time we’ll see him play. A brilliant songwriter and guitarist plus also a lovely bloke.\n\nWhat was your rock music discovery (old or new) of the year?\n\nNightwish, who I have played a lot on the Long Player show, but only when I saw them live in Birmingham did I finally get it. That is a band who know how to do a live show!\n\nDid you go to any festivals? If so, where, and who blew you away?\n\nRockstock, of course and was taken to another place by The Answer. Can’t wait to see them at Steelhouse next year. Stunning.\n\nFavourite song of the year?\n\n‘Adieu’ by Rammstein. Without doubt one of the greatest bands of all time and this track captures all that’s great about them while still being new and surprising.\n\nFavourite album of the year?\n\nMarillion ‘An Hour Before It’s Dark’. They never seem to run out of ideas and it sounds like they love playing more than ever!\n\nIan Danter:\n\nWhat was your favourite gig of 2022?\n\nI saw lots of great stuff this year but seeing FM being so classy in Bristol in support of their '13' album was a real treat for the ears. Musically and vocally they're as good as they've always been if not better.\n\nWhat was your rock music discovery (old or new) of the year?\n\nGhost for me I think. I'd heard bits and bobs played on Planet Rock before but having heard Impera and been so impressed by it, I delved into their history a bit more and really enjoyed what I found!\n\nDid you go to any festivals? If so, where, and who blew you away?\n\nSteelhouse 2022 was quite superb this year. So many great/unexpected moments, from Cardinal Black's sublime set to the sheer craziness of Mother Vulture to Kira Mac's barnstorming set and Graham Bonnet shocking us all with an amazing vocal masterclass. And the sun shone (mostly)!\n\nFavourite song of the year?\n\nMy song 'Landscapes' from my Rule Of Three album!! It's a song I'm incredibly proud of having written and recorded myself, and the guitar solo provided by Chris Buck is just gorgeous. Nothing wrong with the occasional bit of self-publicity!!\n\nFavourite album of the year?\n\nMy album...no I can't say that LOL! Has to be Impera by Ghost. When Sabbath met Abba in a very dark alley...Twenties is a truly frightening song - frighteningly good too. Just a very clever fusion of melody and gothy darkness. Brilliant record\n\nWyatt:\n\nWhat was your favourite gig of 2022?\n\nShinedown in Manchester. An arena show in a theatre with a stunning sound.\n\nWhat was your rock music discovery (old or new) of the year?\n\nI discovered the excellent Black Sabbath track – ‘Rock N’ Roll Doctor’. Brilliant….and with cowbell.\n\nDid you go to any festivals? If so, where, and who blew you away?\n\nKISS’s not so final UK appearance at Download was just a joyous night.\n\nFavourite song of the year?\n\n‘Cage’ by Billy Idol is just a great uplifting track if you’ve had a tough time.\n\nFavourite album of the year?\n\n'Get Rollin' by Nickelback. Solid throughout with plenty of bangers.\n\nAnt Arthur (Producer):\n\nWhat was your favourite gig of 2022?\n\nThe Taylor Hawkins Tribute Concert at Wembley Stadium. One of the most surreal and emotional nights ever.\n\nWhat was your rock music discovery (old or new) of the year?\n\nDirty Honey. I also fell into a bit of a The Who hole at the start of the year and picked up a bunch of album deep cuts that I listen to a lot now.\n\nDid you go to any festivals? If so, where, and who blew you away?\n\nAt Rockstock this year I saw Sweet and although I quite like them, I wasn’t expecting to enjoy their set as much as I did.\n\nFavourite song of the year?\n\nThe new Metallica track ‘Lux AEterna’ is way better than I was expecting. Sometimes when bands like that come back after a while it can be a bit “so what?” but that song is a banger.\n\nFavourite album of the year?\n\nDef Leppard’s ‘Diamond Star Halos’ is a great album. So many songs on that album could have been a single.\n\nDarren Redick:\n\nWhat was your favourite gig of 2022?\n\nZeppelin Symphonic at The London Palladium\n\nWhat was your rock music discovery (old or new) of the year?\n\nParamore! Not a new band but I had only ever heard OF them and not actually heard any of their music. Great sound. Hayley Williams is a terrific front person!\n\nDid you go to any festivals? If so, where, and who blew you away?\n\nSteelhouse Festival was great again! Europe never loses a step and it was great to among the thousands singing along with the Graham Bonnet Band on Since You Been Gone.\n\nFavourite song of the year?\n\nShinedown – ‘Dysfunctional You’\n\nFavourite album of the year?\n\nPorcupine Tree – ‘Closure/Continuation’\n\nRic Blaxill (Music and Content Director):\n\nWhat was your favourite gig of 2022?\n\nRival Sons and Dirty Honey at the Forum Kentish Town.\n\nWhat was your rock music discovery (old or new) of the year?\n\nTony Wright from Terrorvision’s coffee shop in Otley!\n\nDid you go to any festivals? If so, where, and who blew you away?\n\nDownload Festival. Shinedown and Creeper were outstanding!\n\nFavourite song of the year?\n\n‘Blood Brother’ by The Answer.\n\nFavourite album of the year?\n\nShinedown’s ‘Planet Zero’.\n\nPaul Anthony:\n\nWhat was your favourite gig of 2022?\n\nSkid Row at KK’s Steel Mill in Wolverhampton. It was their first tour with Erik Gronwall on vocals. The band were on fire, and Erik’s vocals off the scale!\n\nWhat was your rock music discovery (old or new) of the year?\n\nTroy Redfern. What that man can do with a slide guitar is amazing!\n\nDid you go to any festivals? If so, where, and who blew you away?\n\nPlanet Rockstock was amazing this year. Sweet were absolutely superb with so many great songs in their set, and everybody singing along too them. It was also great to see The Answer back on stage for the first time in years doing what they do best.\n\nFavourite song of the year?\n\n‘Starlight’ by Dan Reed Network and ‘Born In The Storm’ by Dare.\n\nFavourite album of the year?\n\nAgain, it’s a tie between Skid Row’s ‘The Gang’s All Here’ and Dan Reed Network’s ‘Let’s Hear It for The King.’\n\nBernard Doherty:\n\nWhat was your favourite gig of 2022?\n\nJoanne Shaw Taylor at Shepherd’s Bush Empire. WOW! From the get go of ‘Stop Messin Round’ to the encores of ‘Mud Honey’ and ‘Going Home’, she delivered a five star performance. Outstanding vocals (it’s often overlooked what a great, great singer she is) plus the expected blistering guitar playing throughout, Joanne shaw Taylor is still the undisputed queen of blues rock.\n\nWhat was your rock music discovery (old or new) of the year?\n\nI can’t stop playing the new music of Troy Redfern. Catch him live while you can in small venues. His standout track for me is ‘Mercy’.\n\nDid you go to any festivals? If so, where, and who blew you away?\n\nNot exactly a festival but British Summer Time Hyde Park on a glorious hot sunny day, I went to see Pearl Jam and got down front in the pit. AMAZING! They played songs that spanned the entirety of their career. This about the seventh time I've seen them and they still give it plenty. The best moments were ‘Why Go’ , ‘Black’ and ‘Alive’ plus covering Van Halen’s ‘Eruption’ and The Who’s ‘Baba O Reilly’. Eddie Vedder is vital and Mike McCready is God\n\nFavourite song of the year?\n\nAlready a Blues Power constant play, it’s the window rattlingly good Tyler Bryant & Shakedown’ ‘Off The Rails’ from the new album ‘Shake The Roots’. A must own album for all Planet Rockers\n\nFavourite album of the year?\n\nSamantha Fish’s ‘Faster’ proves she is a formidable songwriter. More than just a standard blues rock album, this takes the hugely talented Samantha Fish to a new level. Some stonking rockers, as you would expect, but there's more to this album. It took a while to grow on me but I absolutely love it now.\n\nJon Norman (Head of Marketing):\n\nWhat was your favourite gig of 2022?\n\nSamantha Fish at the Komeda in Bath. Great show and a fabulous guitarist.\n\nWhat was your rock music discovery (old or new) of the year?\n\nIt’s split between two - Troy Redfern and Kira Mac. Both are ones to watch for 2023. Both triumphed at Planet Rockstock and they will be at next year’s Winters End Festival\n\nDid you go to any festivals? If so, where, and who blew you away?\n\nI had the pleasure of going to a number of festivals this year, but I guess I’d have to say seeing Graham Bonnet at Planet Rockstock playing songs from the first ever album I bought in 1980 – Rainbow’s ‘Down to Earth’ - and until 2022, I had never heard the songs live. It was quite emotional! The power of music!\n\nFavourite song of the year?\n\nVon Hertzen Brother’s ‘Peace Patrol’. An amazing 10 minute epic.\n\nFavourite album of the year?\n\nTough one but The Commoners’ ‘Find A Better Way’ is a great album.\n\nJames Pllu (Programme Manager, Planet Rock):\n\nWhat was your favourite gig of 2022?\n\nMost surprising it was Billy Idol in Glasgow. Took my brother as he bought all the Billy Idol records back in the day. It was a really great gig. Billy was on great form and we had a fab old time.\n\nWhat was your rock music discovery (old or new) of the year?\n\nMother Vulture. I’ve NEVER seen a Mosh pit at Planet Rockstock, especially on the second stage.They had so much energy and were great fun.\n\nDid you go to any festivals? If so, where, and who blew you away?\n\nSteelhouse Festival is always my favourite. Just a great adventure up the hill, and I thought Graham Bonnet and Europe were great. I also really enjoyed Kira Mac.\n\nFavourite song of the year?\n\nFoo Fighters’ ‘Love Dies Young’. It’s just classic sing-along Foos.\n\nFavourite album of the year?\n\nLoads, but I’ll choose Ozzy Osbourne’s ‘Patient Number 9’ off the top of my head. He’s on good form.\n\nCloe Lee (Producer):\n\nWhat was your favourite gig of 2022?\n\nThe Rolling Stones at BST Hyde Park. The set list was immaculate performing hit after hit and there was such a great energy in the crowd.\n\nWhat was your rock music discovery (old or new) of the year?\n\nA bit of a weird one. Steely Dan were featured on the Euphoria series 2 soundtrack this year with the song ‘Dirty Work’ which sent me down the Steely Dan wormhole listening to their whole discography.\n\nDid you go to any festivals? If so, where, and who blew you away?\n\nThis year I went to Slam Dunk, All Points East, Download… I was totally blown away by Turnstile.\n\nFavourite song of the year?\n\n‘These Are the Ways’ by Red Hot Chili Peppers. I saw them perform this live and couldn’t stop listening to it.\n\nFavourite album of the year?\n\n‘Supernova’ by Nova Twins. I love this album and I love this band. Their sheer talent shines through and every song is a belter.\n\nIn Memoriam: Rock icons we've sadly lost in 2022:\n\nNow read:\n\n40 of the greatest rock and heavy metal Christmas songs ever\n\nThe Greatest Rock Songs of All Time\n\nHow to listen to Planet Rock:\n\nListen to Planet Rock on DAB nationwide, on our Rayo app, online or via your smart speaker (“Play Planet Rock”)."
