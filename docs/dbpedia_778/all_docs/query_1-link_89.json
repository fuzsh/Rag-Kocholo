        "text": "Ozzy Osbourne is up for a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nomination as a solo artist, but the heavy metal luminary recently revealed that he isn’t sure he’ll even receive it.\n\nDuring a recent interview with Rolling Stone, Osbourne — who was previously inducted as a member of Black Sabbath — said the nomination has been “driving (him) mad.”\n\n“It’s an honor that I’m nominated, but I’m not expecting to get in,” Osbourne, 75, told Rolling Stone. “There’s Mariah Carey, there’s Cher, Lenny Kravitz. I’m up against some serious people. If I get in, I get in. If I don’t, I don’t.”\n\nIn the past, Osbourne criticized the Rock Hall, slamming it as an institution of the “supposed elite for the industry” though he had a change of heart after Black Sabbath was inducted in 2006.\n\nWinners who get inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame typically perform on stage with a few songs and asked whether he’ll perform, the Prince of Darkness said it’s a “maybe.”\n\nOsbourne has suffered from health issues in recent years including a Parkinson’s disease diagnosis in 2020 and was forced to retire from touring. Last year, he cancelled his European tour dates due to a spinal injury.\n\n“I would love to, but I can’t stand up right,” Osbourne told the music publication. “Maybe I’ll do something one day. I miss it terribly.”\n\nRock & Roll Hall of Fame winners will be announced in late April.\n\nMore music coverage\n\nGuitarist for legendary classic rock band says he wasn’t actually fired\n\nLegendary classic rock singer calls it quits after 50 years\n\nLegendary rock star surprises Oscars, performs with Ryan Gosling for ‘I’m Just Ken’\n\nLegendary singer reunites with classic rock band to record first album together in 40 years\n\nPopular rock drummer dead at 57 from brain cancer\n\nLegendary rock band’s co-founder stepping back after heart attack\n\nLegendary rock drummer recovering from major hand surgery ‘has his life back’"
