        "text": "Queen were a famous British rock band that was founded in 1971. The band members originally consisted of Freddie Mercury who was the lead vocals. He plays the piano too on top of his very talented high-pitched voice. Brian May was on guitar and vocals. John Deacon plays the bass guitar and sings backup vocals as well while Roger Taylor was on drums.\n\nThe group’s initial song writing was greatly shaped by progressive and acid rock. In the following years, they eventually veered towards more conventional styles that were thickly laced with classical rock and progressive, creating a diverse music that made them famous in their own right. As their music developed and became almost theatrical, they started to confidently display their talents, particularly in Freddie Mercury’s case. At the time they began to enjoy mainstream success in the United Kingdom. However, the launch of their albums Sheer Heart Attack, which was released in 1974 and A Night at the Opera, which featured the Bohemian Rhapsody made them international stars. Bohemian Rhapsody was ranked number one in the charts and stayed there for more than two months.\n\nQueen continued to write and perform music. They have released a total of 18 albums over the span of two decades. They have sold 300 million albums all over the world, making them one of the leading musical bands in history. In 2001, they were inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
