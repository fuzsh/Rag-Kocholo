        "text": "Queen’s third studio album Sheer Heart Attack celebrates its anniversary on November 8. The album represents a massive turning point for the band where they embraced more glam and pop elements.\n\nIt was a move that paid off. Sheer Heart Attack was Queen’s big break in the United States and became the band’s first album to break into the top 200 of the Billboard 200 album chart peaking at #12. The album’s also a mix of hits and fan favorites.\n\nBut which track from Sheer Heart Attack is the best?
