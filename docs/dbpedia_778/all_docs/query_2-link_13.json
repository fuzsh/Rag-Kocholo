        "text": "The Other Silhouettes\n\nMuch to our surprise, there seem to have been a lot of records released by The Silhouettes that we had never heard of...\n\nAccept No Substitute\n\nThe purpose of this article is to help people make the right choices. We do not want to suggest that the records and groups discussed here are not worth a listen, because we simply don't know - we have never heard most of them.\n\nBut we do want to help fans of The Silhouettes - the group that had a colossal worldwide hit with Get A Job in 1958, and who are the subject of this website - to avoid spending their money unwisely. For all the records mentioned here state on their labels that they are by The Silhouettes, but none are related in any way to the vocal harmony quartet from Philadelphia that we know and love, or to their soul-oriented 1960s line-up.\n\nA couple of these groups may have had a prior claim to the name, but others simply appropriated it and really should have known better - for obvious reasons they were never likely to meet with much success, and little is known about most of them.\n\nOne thing we can say with a fair amount of confidence is that none of them ever featured Frankie Beverly on lead vocals.\n\nEarly Groups\n\nWhat is thought to be the earliest release by another group named The Silhouettes is one of the first rockabilly records, made by Clayton Watson and the Silhouettes in Portland, Oregon for the Lavender label. Like Get A Job, it was recorded in 1957.\n\nEverybody's Boppin' featured Clayton (who wrote the song) on drums and vocals, and his group performed regularly on the Pacific coast for a year or so, after which they changed their name to \"Lord Dent and The Invaders\".\n\nRitchie Valens, who later had a solo hit with La Bamba, was also in a group named The Silhouettes, this one from California.\n\nRichard Valenzuela (as he then was) had joined the band aged 16, impressing leader Gil Rocha with his guitar playing, and the six-piece group made its debut in October 1957. The line-up was variable, but they continued to play small venues until May 1958, when they recorded a show and took it to Bob Keane of Del-Fi Records, who was impressed with Ritchie's singing.\n\nHe was less interested in The Silhouettes, and by now Get A Job had dominated the charts. Ritchie Valens went solo, and the only recording known to have survived is Malaguena, released many years later on a retrospective album.\n\nAlso in the late 1950s and early 1960s the BBC in England featured a group named The Silhouettes who performed with popular bandleader Billy Cotton. But this all-female dance troupe were unlikely to have been heard very much, unless they were doing a tap dancing routine.\n\nWell-known in England (though not by name) was the group that sang on a catchy television commercial, with the 45 rpm single Happy Motoring later issued by the Esso petroleum company - while rivals Shell famously used Bing Crosby to sing their praises, this record is credited to The Silhouettes.\n\nWe are unsure of the exact date of the record (the commercial ran from 1957 until the mid-1960s) but our curiosity is certainly piqued - not least because our own webmaster can sing the jingle, \"the Esso sign means happy motoring\".\n\nJazz Groups\n\nThe next of our finds that - judging by the artwork - appears to have been released in the 1960s is a single named St Thomas on the Bye George label, written by \"Rollins\", and we do not need to hear it to know that it will be a cover of the famous 1956 jazz composition by \"saxophone colossus\" Sonny Rollins.\n\nWho the personnel are is less clear. Suffice to say it has no connection with Philadelphia's finest or with Get A Job.\n\nIt may have been the jazz combo named The Silhouettes led by flautist George Bacasa, who made a US album in 1969, just a few months after the Goodway Album was released by the creators of Get A Job (who had disbanded soon after making it and who did not reunite for another twelve years).\n\nThe jazz instrumentals on the Conversations With The Silhouettes LP would naturally have confused anyone who bought it expecting the doo-wop lead of Bill Horton or the soulful sound of his replacement John Wilson, and this is still the case today.\n\nOne cannot help but laugh at the listing for The Silhouettes on the Last FM website, which offers tracks by both groups with no idea that they are completely different, but one has to feel sorry for anyone who is misled by such obvious misinformation, which does neither of the groups (nor their fans) any favors.\n\nFor those who are as confused as the folks at Last FM, the tracks on the Conversations With The Silhouettes album, released on the Segue label, are Young Blood, Time To Fall In Love, Norwegian Wood (presumably the Lennon-McCartney tune), Sally's Tomato (believed to be by Henry Mancini), Question: Why?, Fonky First, Hashi Baba, Conversation, Sesame, What Are You Doing The Rest Of Your Life and Lunar Invasion.\n\nPersonnel on the record are George Bacasa on flute and saxophone, Al Secen on vibes, Ronnie Thomas on bass, Lenny Rogers on drums, Willy Smith on percussion and (on some tracks) Cathy Martin on vocals. The group is thought to have hailed from the Pittsburgh area, and the record was apparently produced by Nathan Davis. Apologies to any jazz buffs who think we should know more about such things.\n\nUnlike much of the material covered here, we have actually heard some of the tracks. If you like flute-heavy Latin-flavored and funky jazz this may be a treat for you, just don't buy it expecting doo-wop, rhythm and blues or soul music.\n\nThe Conversations With The Silhouettes LP is the item most likely to confuse record collectors looking for vocal harmony from Philadelphia. Caveat emptor - you have been warned.\n\nA later single by this group was Oh What A Day, an up-tempo pop tune written by Charles Osborne and produced by Bill Lawrence for his Western World label. This track features Carol Christian on vocals, while the flip-side is the funky instrumental number named Red Snow by The Silhouettes.\n\nImaginary Groups\n\nThe Last FM website also lists an album named Forest Trails by The Silhouettes, with the tracks entitled Majestic Forest, Charming Peace, Moody Walk, Stream Of The Past, Sublime Escape, Forest Charm, Day Dreaming and Old Fantasy.\n\nBut Forest Trails, issued in 2000, is a compilation CD of \"New Age\" music by various artists - none of whom appear to be called The Silhouettes. It is part of a series on the Athena label (other discs are \"Obsession\" and \"Sunset Reflections\") that uses the generic title of \"Silhouettes\", and all are likely to disappoint fans of any of the groups discussed here.\n\nLast FM accompanies the listing with the ubiquitous photograph of Bill Horton, Raymond Edwards, Earl Beal and Rick Lewis that graces the front of this site, the group who struck gold in 1958 with Get a Job. Whatever else is on the disc, we can assure you that they do not appear on it.\n\nOverseas Groups\n\nThere was a popular group named The Silhouettes operating in South Africa for a couple of years, starting in 1959.\n\nBand members were Archie van der Ploeg on lead guitar, with Hank Squires (rhythm), Leon Booysen (bass) and George Hill (drums), all three of whom had previously been in Mickie Most and his Playboys. Original vocalist Roger Drew was replaced by Al Bentley, and both Peter Lotis and Roger Smith also sang songs on their only album The Silhouettes at the Bop Inn.\n\nThe track listing was Big Sax, Clap Your Hands, Mr Asteroid, My Little Ruby, Torquay, I'm Walking, Staccato, Rock Around The Clock (presumably a Bill Haley cover), Lonely Guitar, Bongo Blues, Don't Leave Me and Side Kick.\n\nTheir greatest success, however, was backing female vocalist June Dyer for her single Whirlpool Of Love on the Renown label, which reached number one on the South African chart in 1961. The flip-side was Comanche, credited as written and performed by The Silhouettes.\n\nThey split up soon afterwards. A proposed trip to England with Mickie Most in 1962 never materialized - he became a successful record producer in London, they stayed at home.\n\nMeanwhile in 1960 another group named The Silhouettes had formed in New Zealand, releasing a single My Tani in 1961.\n\nOriginal band members were Rex Bowmast (lead guitar), Warren McInman (rhythm), Ritchie Sims (bass) and Wayne Daverne (drums), but a plethora of line-up changes followed. Further singles were Theme From The Endless Summer in 1964, Yes It's Time in 1965, and There She Is, Surfin' Craze and Alone On The Beach in 1966. Their final release was Makin' My Mind Up in 1967 and they disbanded two years later.\n\nBack in Europe, a group named The Silhouettes was formed in The Hague, Holland in 1960, issuing two singles the next year on the Tivoli label, Shine/Silhouette Walk and It's Over/My Love.\n\nThanks to founder and leader Paul de Ridder we now know that the group members were Paul (lead guitar and songwriting), Bob de Ridder (rhythm guitar), Aart Brouwer (bass), Rob Groenendyk (piano), Leo Kappe (drums), plus lead vocalists Peter de Wit (aka Pete White) and Ferry Verschuyl. Shine topped the Radio Veronica charts for a few weeks in 1961 but the group disbanded the next year. Singer Ferry Verschuyl was still performing in 2009, and has had many successes at the Holland Senior Song Festival.\n\nIn 1964 a band from Ostend in Belgium named The Silhouettes issued a single on the Weekend label, an instrumental titled Geisha. The tune owes much to the style of the English group The Shadows, and seems to have started a trend in that respect, as several later groups did something similar.\n\nAnother group named The Silhouettes that we know nothing about is the eight-piece line-up who issued an eponymous album on the Magda label, judging by the artwork at sometime in the 1960s. We cannot even ascertain the country of origin, though the song titles we can decipher are in Spanish.\n\nTracks include No Sigas Llorando, Silhouettes Polka, El Coco Loco, Por El Amor A Mi Madre, Dejame En Paz and Nada Contigo, but our intensive research has not as yet been able to shed any light on this ensemble.\n\nNeither can we find anything on a band from Germany who called themselves The Silhouettes to issue an album named Chapter End - we know that this one contains songs named Don't Breathe A Word and Surrender Your Heart, but we don't know when it was made, or even what label it was on.\n\nIt seems unlikely that they were the covers band from Germany with an ever-changing line-up who started out in 1966 and appear never to have come up with any original material, despite winning a 1968 \"beat bands contest\" in Upper Franconia.\n\nWe have seen references to at least two other groups in England and one in Canada who were active in the 1960s and called themselves The Silhouettes, though none of these are thought to have made any recordings. There was also a four-piece group from Eire that used the name at the time, and an eight-piece showband active in Northern Ireland in the 1970s.\n\nAfter all this we were rather pleased to hear some music by a group named The Silhouettes from Pakistan, taken from their album The Sound Of The Silhouettes, so named \"because we could not think of a more apt title\". Released on the Arokey label, date unknown, the stereo LP is claimed to be the first ever recorded and manufactured in that country.\n\nThe liner notes describe the music as a mixture of contemporary pop (some self-composed) and traditional folk styles performed in an original way \"to give these melodies a new concept\".\n\nInstrumentation involves guitar, electric sitar, keyboards, tabla and percussion - there is no singing on the two tunes we have been able to get hold of so far.\n\nTrack titles include the original compositions Soft Silhouettes, Hodge Podge, Main Diyana and Bhawaiya, plus traditional pieces Raga Amen and Peelo (which we are told on the cover are \"played with gusto and perfection\").\n\nNot our cup of tea, but possibly yours, and certainly no less accomplished than some of the other groups we have heard.\n\nPerhaps the most curious record ever released by a group named The Silhouettes is an EP on the Horse Brand label (believed to emanate from Singapore) which features a group of that name covering songs by The Beatles - in Chinese!\n\nQuite what any fan of The Silhouettes we know and love will make of I Want To Hold Your Hand, I Should Have Known Better, Can't Buy Me Love and I Saw Her Standing There warbled in a foreign language by female singer Chan Siao Fong (pictured on the cover) is something we would not wish to speculate upon. But we have heard one track and our advice is that it is pretty much what you might expect.\n\nBlues Groups\n\nStrictly speaking we have only identified one blues group named The Silhouettes, but they apparently went through several incarnations in the early 1970s and we didn't want to leave them out - as far as we know they never released any records, but the band from Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, will doubtless have entertained a few folks in their time.\n\nOther than that, we know nothing about them.\n\nRecent Groups\n\nIt seems remarkable that anyone would choose to name a group The Silhouettes after Get A Job - that record sold more than three million copies, is known worldwide, and has remained popular ever since. And, of course, the group that recorded it were active until 1968, returning after a twelve-year hiatus to perform between 1980 and 1993 on the revival circuit.\n\nBut that did not deter some ballroom dance musicians in England - where use of the name seems particularly popular - from releasing a series of albums in the 1980s as The Silhouettes, aimed at those who like to do the foxtrot, the tango, and other formal dances of the kind, and who reputedly sew all the sequins onto their costumes by hand.\n\nWe have spotted three LPs entitled Ain't She Sweet!, Anything Goes! and Go Latin!, all with simple ballroom dancing graphics on the cover, featuring instrumental tunes such as Goodnight Vienna, My Very Good Friend The Milkman and Apple Blossom Time, and released on Tema Records.\n\nThe label was founded by bandleader Tony Evans during his residency at the Hammersmith Palais in Shepherd's Bush Road, London. But he did not use his orchestra for the recordings, and The Silhouettes in this instance are a piano, bass and drums trio. There are no vocals.\n\nBuilt as an ice-rink in the 1920s, the Hammersmith Palais became a popular ballroom in the jazz age, and diversified after the Second World War to play host to regular club and disco nights, and to rock acts such as The Who, Oasis, Stevie Ray Vaughan and others. The venue was finally demolished in 2008.\n\nIn 1981 another band from Germany called The Silhouettes - at least we think it was another band - issued a single on MCA that was largely a medley of tunes by the English group The Shadows, famous for backing pop star Cliff Richard and for having a string of instrumental hits in their own right in the 1960s, led by bespectacled guitarist Hank Marvin - himself something of a legend amongst English guitar players and the owner of the first Fender Stratocaster to enter that country.\n\nAs an aside we should mention that Cliff Richard (now \"Sir Cliff\") was known to cover Get A Job in his live act in the early days, though we rather hope it was never recorded.\n\nThe German single on MCA was entitled Hot Licks, a medley of the tracks Riders In The Sky, F.B.I., Kon Tiki, The Rise And Fall Of Flingel Bunt, The Young Ones (a Cliff Richard hit), Wonderful Land, Apache, Guitar Tango, Man Of Mystery, and On The Beach, (another hit for Cliff). An original tune named Behind Every Cliff There's A Silver Shadow was on the flip-side.\n\nThe only artists credited were producers Jeff Jarratt and Don Reedman, who may or may not have played the music but who wrote the one original composition.\n\nThen there is a single named Amour Banco released on the Vogue label in France in 1986, apparently credited to The Silhouettes - though our research has revealed nothing more.\n\nEqually unoriginal in their choice of name was a guitar-based rock band from Finland, who launched in 1999 as The Silhouettes, though why they picked an English name remains a mystery (and our grasp of Finnish is too poor to tell you what the local word for \"silhouettes\" might be).\n\nIn fact the only word of Finnish that we do know is the title of the group's only album, Rautalankarenessanssi, released in 2006 - and we have absolutely no idea what it means.\n\nThe track listing is Tornado, Africa, Caravan, Muistatko Monrepos'n, Lake Bodom, Kesaillan Twist, High, Elama Juoksuhaudoissa, Finnish Knockturne, Wild Rose, Conspiracy Of Silence, Kaunis An Luoksesi Kaipuu and Triangle. The group membership is unknown.\n\nOther 21st century groups calling themselves The Silhouettes include an all-female a cappella outfit from Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, a male pop duo from California, a bunch of ageing rockers from Kankakee, Illinois doing 1950s rock'n'roll covers, a similar group hailing from Washington state, a quartet from Canada and sundry amateur groups promoting themselves on various social networking websites.\n\nThen from Adelaide in Australia we have another quartet named The Silhouettes specializing in 1950s covers, \"from soft and sexy to fast and feisty\" - but while their advertised repertoire includes covers of Elvis Presley and The Drifters, it does not list any songs associated with the genuine article.\n\nMeanwhile in England no fewer than four groups - a rock band, a rockabilly outfit, another band covering tunes by The Shadows and a female vocal trio - have launched between 2006 and 2009 calling themselves The Silhouettes. Perhaps it would have been kinder not to mention any of them.\n\nExperience suggests there will be others.\n\nSupport Groups\n\nIt is fair to say that nobody is likely to confuse our friends from Philadelphia with obscure groups from the 1960s such as \"Peter and the Silhouettes\" (an Australian outfit who released a single Claudette Jones in 1966), \"Tito and the Silhouettes\" from Texas or the British groups \"Lenny and the Silhouettes\", \"Johnny Dark and the Silhouettes\", \"Dee Fenton and the Silhouettes\", \"Ken Dallas and the Silhouettes\", and \"Mark Peters and the Silhouettes\".\n\nProbably the best known of the British bands was \"Brian Howard and the Silhouettes\", who recorded a few sides between 1961 and 1964 in the style known as \"English R&B\", featuring guitar and harmonica reminiscent of The Rolling Stones, The Yardbirds, and many others of the period.\n\nThe group's singles included The Worryin' Kind/Come To Me on Columbia from 1963 and Hooked/Back In The USA on Fontana in 1964, all tracks featuring a young English session player on guitar, one who later went on to great success.\n\nSo while we are not convinced by the claims of Frankie Beverly, we are happy to accept that Led Zeppelin's illustrious axeman, a certain Mr Jimmy Page, once worked with The Silhouettes.\n\nBut not our Silhouettes.\n\nDisambiguation"
