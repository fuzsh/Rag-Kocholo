        "text": "Billie Eilishs third studio album, \"HIT ME HARD AND SOFT\", released via Darkroom/Interscope Records is her most daring body of work to date, a diverse yet cohesive collection of songs ideally listened to in its entirety from beginning to enddoes exactly as the album title suggests; hits you hard and soft both lyrically and sonically, while bending genres and defying trends along the way. With the help of her brother and sole collaborator, FINNEAS, the pair wrote, recorded, and produced the album together in their hometown of Los Angeles. This album comes on the heels of her two massively successful albums WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP WHERE DO WE GO?\" and \"Happier Than Ever\" and works to further develop the world of Billie Eilish.\n\nThe vinyl is made with recyclable compound, collecting all first run scraps to re-use for additional runs later. All vinyl packaging is made from FSC® certified recycled paper/boards made 100% from post-consumer waste and recycled pre-consumer fibers. The ink used is raw plant-based and water-based dispersion varnish. In place of shrink-wrap, the sleeves are 100% recycled and re-usable. For shipping, all finished goods are packaged and shipped to depots in up to 93% recycled and 100% recyclable shipping boxes.\n\nWith over 12 billion global streams, 4 billion official YouTube views, more than 53 million followers across social media platforms, and 27 million videos posted on socials using her music, Melanie Martinez reemerges with a spellbinding new trailer heralding the arrival of her hugely anticipated new album, PORTALS.\n\nMartinez lifted the curtain on PORTALS earlier this week with an instantly viral TikTok video confirming the death of her notorious alter-ego Cry Baby, last seen considering whether to walk into the light at the beguiling conclusion of 2019s internationally acclaimed full-length film, K-12. Todays exclusive trailer  directed by Martinez and streaming now - now sees the appearance of a mysterious egg from which an enigmatic figure emerges.\n\nPortals screams death is life is death is life is death is life. A continuous loop. A circle.  MELANIE MARTINEZ\n\nPORTALS marks the 27-year-old NYC-born singer-songwriter-filmmakers first full-length release in nearly four years following her 2 billion-streaming, RIAA Gold-certified second album, K-12, which proved a sensation upon its September 2019 release, entering the Billboard 200 at #3  Martinezs highest chart placement thus far  with further debuts at #1 on the Alternative album chart, and #1 on the Soundtrack album chart.\n\nParamore are back with their first new music since 2017. The beloved Nashville-based trio of Zac Farro, Hayley Williams& Taylor Yorkhave returned from their hiatus -and the global pandemic -with This Is Why, one of the best songs of their already impressive repertoire. In whats widely recognized as one of the most exciting musical returns of the year, the band have also announced the release of their long awaited sixth studio album, This is Why, for February 10th 2023. Recorded in Los Angeles, California with long-time collaborator Carlos de la Garza, the album features 10 new Paramore songs with cover art shot by Zachary Gray.\n\nEntering back into a world -and cultural landscape -very different from the one they last participated in, Paramore have returned with a song about exactly that. This Is Why is a deliciously infectious Paramore ear-worm for the post-truth world. Of the song, Williams says, This Is Why was the very last song we wrote for the album. To be honest, I was so tired of writing lyrics but Taylor convinced Zac and I both that we should work on this last idea. What came out of it was the title track for the whole album. It summarizes the plethora of ridiculous emotions, the rollercoaster of being alive in 2022, having survived even just the last 3 or 4 years. Youd think after a global pandemic of fucking biblical proportions and the impending doom of a dying planet, that humans would have found it deep within themselves to be kinder or more empathetic or something.\n\nWhen Paramore revealed they were recording together in January 2022 the response from music fans around the world was immediate and celebratory. In the time since the Grammy-winning, RIAA-certified multi-Platinum band released their last album, After Laughter-and Hayley Williams unveiled two lauded solo albums -Paramore have become more popular than ever. Over the last few years Paramores influence and popularity has snowballed, as the age of streaming organically propelled them into a position as one of the worlds biggest, most culturally compelling rock bands. For the band, who formed as teenagers in Tennessee, their 20 year trajectory has seen them grow from youthful outsiders to bone-fide pop culture icons, permeating the musical landscape by inspiring a new generation of musical talent.\n\nViolent Femmes have released nine studio albums and more than a dozen iconic singles, among them such classics as American Music, Gone Daddy Gone, Nightmares, Add It Up, and of course, Blister In The Sun. Their remarkable three-decade-plus career has earned them cumulative worldwide sales in excess of 10 million, with 1983s Violent Femmes awarded with RIAA platinum certification eight years after its initial release. The Violent Femmes self-titled debut album has reached legendary status that few albums ever attain. Released in 1983, Violent Femmes became one of the most distinctive records of the early alternative movement and an enduring cult classic. By combining elements of Jonathan Richman and The Modern Lovers with new wave and acoustic-folk and punk rock, the Femmes forged a sound all their own. Currently out of print on vinyl, this new 180-gram LP reissue faithfully reproduces the albums original artwork, which features one of the iconic album covers of the 1980s.\n\nLizzie Nos new album, Halfsies, finds No situated among her peers while still searching for freedom  freedom from the constraints of categorization, sure, but more importantly, freedom from the depths of her own personal despair and from an increasingly violent and nightmarish American cultural and political landscape.\n\nOn Halfsies, Nos writing is beautifully intricate, the personal and the political folding into each other as naturally as the patchwork of influences that inform the albums twelve tracks. From the desolation and loneliness of The Heartbreak Store, to the roadworn rock of Annie Oakley, to the sprawling mid-apocalyptic yearning of Babylon, Nos writing throughout the record serves as a living conversation with her influences  not just musical but literary  reflecting her reverence for a host of the great voices who came before her, from Lucinda Williams to Toni Morrison, and her search for a connection between them.\n\nThe collection of collaborators on Halfsies gives the album a sense of community; of voices raised together in a call to arms. That synthesis of personal and political courses through Halfsies, Nos identity as a songwriter owing as much to her musical influences as it does to her activism (an outspoken activist and civil rights advocate, No was recently named President of the Abortion Care of Tennessee Board of Directors).\n\nToni Cade Bambara said, the role of the artist is to make revolution irresistible, and with Halfsies, Lizzie No aims to do just that.\n\nClancy marks Twenty One Pilots first studio album in three years and follows their RIAA Gold certified LP, Scaled And Icy. With details of the release teased to fans earlier this month via cryptic mailings and covert artswaps on streaming services, Overcompensate welcomes listeners back to the bands immersive world of Trench. Layers of synths build over a racing breakbeat in the song - a skilled passage of alternative dynamics, flexing in time, and ready to explode. Having amassed over 33 billion streams worldwide and over 3 million tickets sold across global headline tours, the Columbus, OH based duo of Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun have established themselves as one of the most successful bands of the 21st century and redefined the sound of a generation. Co-produced by Joseph and Paul Meany, Clancy marks the final chapter in an ambitious multi-album narrative first introduced in the band's 2015 multi-Platinum breakthrough, Blurryface. Furthermore, Clancys forthcoming release on May 17th coincides with the 9th anniversary of Blurryface, which was released exactly nine years prior to the day. Twenty One Pilots extended the ambitious concept laid out in Blurryface with their 2018 Platinum-certified album TRENCH. Featuring the multi-Platinum and Platinum singles Chlorine, My Blood and the GRAMMY® Award-nominated Jumpsuit, the album graced spots on Best of year-end lists by Billboard, KERRANG!, Alternative Press, and Rock Soundwho placed it at #1."
