        "text": "Steve Albini, a famous producer, musician, and an icon amongst the rock community as well as others, has passed away.\n\nThe 61-year-old — who worked with acts such as Nirvana and Pixies — was confirmed to have succumbed to a heart attack by staff at his recording studio.\n\nEntertainment News\n\nCountry music legend’s daughter arrested in Georgia\n\nCountry music singer says doctors said he had no chance to survive medical emergency\n\nPopular ‘90s punk rocker dead at 51\n\nWhat’s killing you? Find out the CDC’s answers to that question\n\nHip-hop, R&B star says low ticket sales caused last-minute tour cancelation\n\nPitchfork reports how Albini was long considered an icon in the music industry. Not only was the California-born aficionado of sound the frontman of groups such as Rapeman, Shellac and Big Black, but was widely acclaimed for his work on classic albums such as “In Utero.”\n\nAccording to The Guardian, Albini became immersed in the Chicago music scene while studying at the Medill School of Journalism, taking to punk in particular. He went on to found his own studio, Electrical Audio, and continuously took on production jobs “always for a flat fee, refusing royalty payments in a show of solidarity with his artists,” reads The Guardian report.\n\nThe same Guardian article notes that Albini had a new album coming out to be released on May 17.\n\n“Nobody made noise sound so good,” reads one X post. “RIP Steve Albini.”\n\n“I remember him from the Foo Fighters doc ‘Sonic Highways,’” reads another. “He never took a percentage cut of the sales on the albums he produced. He felt that was wrong. Noble thought.”"
