Since we know the song SHA dates back to around 1974 and it has a punk sound (and the lyrics may be a critique of punk music)* I wonder could it be said that Roger or Queen predicted the movement or at least tapped into it before it became popular? It's possible maybe even to make a case for Modern Times Rock 'n' Roll being a proto punk/thrash song\n\n*I think Fight From the Inside is also a critique of punk.

I doubt anyone in the band was actually a punk fan, although classing Queen as a punk band would've been way more accurate than the usual label they're given as an opera/rock band (the 'rock' part is spot on, the 'opera' one is not). mooghead\n\n29.07.2015 16:18 \"What about The Ramones?\"\n\nWere they?

That would be like labelling Queen a synth disco pop band after only listening to Hot Space.\n\n'Punk' in the sense that it is being referred to here wasn't really a musical genre however, but was an 'ethos' or 'movement' (certainly in the few niche places it took off in the UK) - it just so happened that Malcolm McLaren and a few others marketed the public disaffections of the time and put them into a band, and others centred the 'punk' feel around art, fashion, politics etc...\n\nIf we're just talking about loud and angry music, the Who's 'My Generation' was every ounce 'punk' a dozen years before The Sex Pistols etc.. came to prominence.\n\nit's the same in every single musical genre you can think of, in that there are a few innovators and generally musically adept and genuine artists, and then the record companies and bands jump on the bandwagon and create a shedload of copycat acts that are a pale imitation. In the case of 'punk', the original acts that were lauded and got a lot of press were, with only a couple of exceptions, generally pretty crap and so the watered down copycats after were even worse!\n\nThe only bands that started with a punk ethos and mindset that really became successful and interesting from a musical point of view were the ones that broadened their horizons outside of the original 'three chords and shouting and spitting' format such as Blondie, Talking Heads, The Clash etc...

It was very casual, because the dj's from Jamaica didn't have enough punk singles, and finally played reggea and dub music.\n\nEven Bauhaus, a \"goth\" band, wrote some disco/funk music.\n\nAbout Hot Space and Thriller...hehehe. I never seen the connection! pittrek\n\n01.08.2015 07:06 I always loved the Sex Pistols (their first album + some songs from the later albums, not their life styles), Clash (their music, not their political views), The Damned (again just the music), Buzzcocks, Dead Kennedys, Ramones ... As I think about it I would say I love punk MUSIC, not the punks themselves :-) But I never understood why so many people consider SHA or Modern Times r'n'r punk. Day dop\n\n02.08.2015 04:53 I'm glad for the punk movement, and for some of the bands, The Sex Pistols and The Ramones being the obvious two - and those that were largely influenced by punk, especially late 80's/90's groups - Sleater-Kinney, Nirvana, Sonic Youth etc. The world of music would've been a less colourful place without it.

I am speculating based on the evidence currently available -- a scored/ruined album back cover* which is similar to designs punks would later use and the possibility that the song SHA was 'punk-like' from its conception (which may be why it wasn't released back in 74-75). The comparison with Hot Space isn't like for like as funk had been around for decades and disco for years when HS was released. Here I'm talking about Roger possibly being ahead of the game, or at least the possibility of him being influenced by proto punk stuff in the early 1970s.\n\n* no idea who came up with the \"scored\" design, but I'm struggling to think of any other hard rock bands who did this back in 1974. Maybe it was a minor tribute to Hendrix setting fire to his guitar, or Pete Townshend destroying his guitar as a tribute to Gustav Metzger performance art.

The bands outfits certainly don't.\n\nStatus Quo Live had a cover made up of a ripped picture, admitadly after Sheer Heart Attack, but it could be argued that there was a punk influence there, though their music certainly didn't show it.

And if it did come (at least partially) from Queen, it's far more likely to have come from 'The Game' rather than 'Hot Space.' But anyway, Michael (who knew more about what influenced Michael than anybody else) claimed he was commissioned the song when Quincy specifically asked for a track influenced by The Knacks. Not Queen, The Knacks. And that happened, by the way, before the release of 'Hot Space' anyway.\n\nMoreover, 88.89% of the album is not 'Beat It.'
