        "text": "Detroit's Motown and punk legacies combine to inspire Texan rockers Young Heart Attack, writes Steve Tauschke.\n\nPerforming in front of your heroes can be scary stuff. Just ask Steven T. Hall, bassist and songwriter with guitar-slinging Texan upstarts Young Heart Attack. An avid fan of '60s Detroit rock gods the MC5, Hall is still audibly excited about sharing recent festival stages with surviving members of the legendary group, now touring as DKT.\n\n\"It was absolutely amazing,\" gushes Hall down the phone from his home town of Austin. \"Those guys we obviously love and are a huge inspiration to us, from their sound to their live performances. Everyone in the band and surrounding that band is top-notch. Total class. That we got to hook up with them was just mind-blowing. It was a dream come true.\"\n\nOut of respect for their idols, Young Heart Attack decided to drop from the live sets their popular reworking of the MC5's Over & Over. However, the veteran rockers' outspoken guitarist, Wayne Kramer, a man who cares deeply for rock'n'roll, would have none of that.\n\n\"One thing with Wayne,\" says Hall, \"when we weren't playing our version of Over & Over the first couple of nights we played with them, he came to us and said, 'I read you weren't playing it because you thought it wouldn't be cool with us, but I want you to know that it's your song now, too. So you guys get out there and play it.' So during the song we'd look over and one of them would be standing there watching, and we were like, 'Oh, man.' I'm still nervous talking about it now.\"\n\nHall and guitarist Chris \"Frenchie\" Smith formed Young Heart Attack in 2001, following the demise of their '90s noise-rock collective, Sixteen Deluxe. With guitarist and co-vocalist Chris Hodge, former Fastball drummer Joey Shuffield and back-up singer Jennifer Stephens quickly drafted, the quintet began doing the rounds of Austin's thriving bar scene, recording a string of 45s on indie label Rex Records.\n\nA year later, at Austin's South by Southwest music conference, YHA's incendiary display of sweaty mullets and shout-it-out-loud delinquent rock pricked the ears of XL Recordings, who released the band's full-tilt debut, Mouthful of Love, early this year.\n\nNow, with the album's touring cycle all but complete, YHA are holed up in \"The Bubble\", their cave-like studio retreat in south Austin, where writing for the second album has begun in earnest.\n\n\"We've got an hour's worth of ideas and probably half of that will wind up as songs,\" says Hall of the new tracks. \"We've completed rough, live demos of about five or six tunes. I think we're moving a lot quicker and I think we're more of a band this time. A lot of people don't recognise that we were writing Mouthful of Love as we were becoming a band and touring, whereas on this record a lot of the ideas were a little more prepared.\n\n\"We're experimenting with a lot more sparse guitars too, but I think more of the experimentation is in some of the beats that we're playing. This album probably won't be as punk-rock as Mouthful. It won't be just 30 minutes of just rip-your-head-off rock. I think it'll probably be leaning towards, you know, we've been listening to a lot of Stax and Motown, and so those beats are showing up in there. The songs are real groovy, but still loud as f--- at the same time.\"\n\nAlso given greater emphasis is Stephens' voice.\n\n\"She's doing a little bit more singing than last time,\" says Hall. \"The trade-off of the vocals on the first record and up to this point has been great, but she's grown a tremendous amount just with the volume of touring we've done. So when we started talking about this next record, I wanted to write more for her this time and have her featured a little more, because she's a special part of the band.\"\n\nA former choir singer and part-time pianist, Stephens grew up listening to Nina Simone and Billie Holiday. Thus, her bluesy, melodic voice provides the ideal foil to guitarist Hodge's pained wail.\n\n\"The way it worked out last time, it was a kind of Marvin & Tammi-type thing, and that's still going to be there, but I think there'll be two or three new songs where Jennifer will be the primary singer. I mean, people love her voice, she's a great singer and a great performer - to the point where she deserves to have more of her own thing going on.\"\n\nYoung Heart Attack's Australian tour is the group's second dig down under this year after July's national tour supporting DKT. More than most, Hall appreciates the legacy of the MC5's rousing political anthems, and while he insists his band are \"just trying to make music and not get too far into the politics\", there's a distinct partisan twang to this Texan native's outlook.\n\n\"We like to call our politics 'normal' or 'sound of mind', and we don't feel Bush is normal or of sound mind whatsoever,\" he says. \"We're obviously very devastated about the fact that he's back. We do have a stance, and because we do travel to a lot of other countries we get asked about it a lot, being American and particularly being Texans.\n\n\"When we go to Europe, a lot of people talk to you like you're directly responsible. Like, 'What's going on over there in the US?' or 'Steven, why did you let this happen?' We were at a party once, and this girl started talking to Frenchie, saying he must be really embarrassed to be an American and for the choices he's made. She was laying it on pretty heavy. But for the most part we have to agree with most people that Bush is a wrong-doer.\"\n\nSo, do \"Bushrangers need bush\", as stencilled recently by an aggrieved graffiti artist on a wall in my neighbourhood?\n\n\"Ha! Well, there are posters all over Austin right now with Bush's face on them that say '(Mis)Leader'. He's certainly misled a lot of people and now he's a lame duck. He can f--- up anything he wants and walk away after this term with no responsibility or having to worry about another election. America's on a downhill slide right now, and it's a scary thing.\""
