        "text": "Chuck Berry passed away Saturday at the age of 90, and now TMZ reports that his death is being attributed to natural causes and no autopsy will be performed. Based on a 911 call, Berry suffered a heart attack and when emergency services arrived he was unconscious and barely breathing.\n\nAnd while Berry is gone, his music lives on. In fact, a new album, “CHUCK,” was announced back in October on his 90th birthday and his family says details about the album’s release should be coming this week.\n\n“Working to prepare the release of this record in recent months and in fact over the last several years brought Chuck a great sense of joy and satisfaction,” the family says. “While our hearts are very heavy at this time, we know that Chuck had no greater wish than to see this album released to the world, and we know of no better way to celebrate and remember his 90 years of life than through his music.”\n\nThe family adds that they had already been planning to release news about the album this week, noting, “as a tribute to Chuck Berry, and with gratitude to his fans around the world, we will be following through on those plans in the coming days.”\n\nJoe Edwards, the owner of St. Louis’ Blueberry Hill club where Berry performed regularly, says he’s heard some songs off the record and claims they are “sensational.”"
