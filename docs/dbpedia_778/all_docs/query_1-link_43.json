        "text": "Singer and guitarist Tom Petty, whose work with his band the Heartbreakers and as a solo artist tapped a pure vein of American rock and roll for more than four decades, died Monday, Oct. 2, apparently after suffering cardiac arrest at his home in Malibu on Sunday night. He was 66.\n\nPetty’s death was reported by the Associated Press, citing the singer’s spokesman, shortly after 9 p.m. Monday. Earlier in the day, CBS had reported the musician’s death, but then had to retract the story.\n\nPetty and the Heartbreakers just wrapped up a 40th anniversary tour with three sold-out shows at the Hollywood Bowl, the last of them on Monday, Sept. 25, which now stands as his farewell appearance. He and the band had also headlined the Arroyo Seco Weekend in Pasadena on June 24 and Kaaboo Del Mar festival on Sept. 17, part of what he’d suggested might be his last big tour, though he’d said he would still play shows occasionally but desired to spend more time at home with his family and friends.\n\nPetty was born Oct. 20, 1950 in Gainesville, Florida, and and after playing in a handful of local bands as teenager found his first measure of success there in the early ’70s with Mudcrutch, a band that also included future Heartbreakers Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench. It was with Mudcrutch that he and the rest of the band sold all their belongings, packed everyone into a van, and drove to Los Angeles in search of a record deal, eventually landing at Shelter Records.\n\nMudcrutch made one album before the record label guys persuaded Petty to go solo, which he did, and the resulting 1976 debut “Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers” helped him breakout as a star, songs from it such as “Breakdown” and “American Girl” setting Petty on a path that would in 2002 land him and the Heartbreakers in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Along the way he received three Grammy Awards — a criminally low total given the consistently high quality of his work — as well as the Grammy Awards MusicCares Person of the Year in 2017.\n\nFrom the day he arrived, Petty was as much a Los Angeleno as anyone born here, so deeply did he sink his roots into its soil, never looking back from his decision to pick L.A. over New York City when he and the rest of Mudcrutch were looking for a bigger scene than Gainesville in which to pursue their dreams.\n\n“We could kind of picture ourselves in L.A.” Petty said in “Conversations with Tom Petty,” a 2005 collection of interviews by Paul Zollo. “We loved the Byrds and we loved the Beach Boys, and Buffalo Springfield and the (Flying) Burrito Brothers. And we kind of felt we belonged here (in L.A.). And we always have, though we’re still never referred to as an ‘L.A. band.’ We’re always referred to as a Southern band.\n\n“But the truth is every bit of music we’ve ever made was in L.A.” Petty continued. “We’ve been in L.A. for over 30 years. We’re a Los Angeles band.”\n\nHis roots here were certainly literal at times, the places Petty lived ranging from what he described as “hooker motels” in Hollywood when the band was broke and struggling, to the big house in Encino that chart success bought, then a self-described “chicken shack” after his first marriage ended in divorce amid his heroin addiction, and finally the mansion in Malibu where he settled with his second wife Dana.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Petty is survived by stepson Dylan from her first marriage, his daughters Adria and AnnaKim from his first marriage, and a granddaughter.\n\nAnd though he lived in many parts of Los Angeles, his love for his adopted city and state was even better known thanks to the inspirations its people and places gave him as a songwriter, and the frequency with which he name-dropped local landmarks in his lyrics.\n\n“Century City,” from his first Top 10 album, 1979’s “Damn The Torpedos” was partly inspired by that L.A. neighborhood because it’s where he constantly traveled to meet with lawyers during a period of bitter legal wrangling with his record label.\n\n“Into the Great Wide Open,” from the 1991 album of the same name, is a story song inspired by the kind of dreamers Petty met – and once might have been – who come to L.A., hang out on the Sunset Strip, catch a spot of luck, and end up getting chewed up by the entertainment industry. And “The Last DJ,” the title track of a 2002 album, was inspired by longtime Los Angeles DJ Jim Ladd, one of the final free-form disc jockeys to play whatever he pleased on the air.\n\nAnd, of course, there is “Free Fallin’” from “Full Moon Fever” in 1989 which is practically a travel guide to different spots around the city as its lyrics mention “a long day, livin’ in Reseda” and later, “All the vampires, walkin’ through the Valley / Move west down Ventura Boulevard.”\n\nIts third verse offers one additional L.A. reference, though taken in full it feels particularly poignant today: “I wanna glide down, over Mulholland / I wanna write her name in the sky / I wanna free fall, out into nothin’ / Gonna leave this world for awhile.”\n\nHis first two albums with the Heartbreakers scored only moderate success, at least at first. A skinny guy in tight jeans and dark clothes, he was labeled by some initially as part of the late ’70s punk and New Wave crowd, which makes a little sense given that his first record was more enthusiastically embraced in England than at home initially.\n\nBut his heart and soul belonged to American rock ’n’ roll of the type he name-checked above as motivations for the Heartbreakers settling in Los Angeles. There’s a lot classic American music in his songs, rock and country and folk, a good reason why the Byrds are often noted as an influence.\n\nSo while from from album to album one flavor might surface more than another – say, the psychedelic vibe of “Don’t Come Around Here No More” off 1985’s “Southern Accents,” or the gentle folk of “Wildflowers” from that 1994 title of the same name – he wore all of them with comfort as a singer and a songwriter.\n\n“Wildflowers” was his second solo album, following the huge success of “Full Moon Fever,” though nearly all of the Heartbreakers played on those as well his third and final solo record, “Highway Companion” from 2006. Eventually Petty said he just didn’t see the point of releasing solo material given that the guys he wanted to play with were all in the Heartbreakers already.\n\nHe did have a second band in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s. The Traveling Wilburys had a fictional mythology – Petty was Charlie T. Wilbury, Jr. on the first album, Muddy Wilbury on the second – and his band mates included Bob Dylan, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison and George Harrison, each of them bringing their own distinctive songs and voices into their Grammy-winning efforts. (When Lynne revived Electric Light Orchestra in 2015 for its first shows in 30 years, Petty was among the stars who filed into the balcony at the Fonda Theatre in Hollywood to cheer his fellow Wilbury on.)\n\nAnd Mudcrutch came back later in his career, too, with a 2008 self-titled album on which Petty, Campbell, Tench, Tom Leadon and Randall Marsh finally put together the demos, singles and unrecorded work that had originally been slated for release 30-some years earlier.\n\nMudcrutch played some shows, had a good time and in 2016 recorded a follow-up titled “Mudcrutch 2,” behind which they toured.\n\nThe band’s date at the Observatory in Santa Ana on June 28, 2016, is the final night Petty played a stage in Orange County. It followed a pair of Mudcrutch shows at the Fonda in Hollywood, the hardscrabble band from Florida taking a victory lap around its adopted home."
