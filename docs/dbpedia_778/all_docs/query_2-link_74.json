        "text": "The FaireChylde fleet of flying party ships returns in 2022 with a schedule full of DJs and Live Singers ready to rock everyone’s boat!\n\nAlestair Voidthorn\n\nFrom epic Soundtracks to Symphonic Rock, from Renaissance to Gothic, Alestair’s playlists are the stuff of Fairelander’s dreams. He also understands two things that speak to the heart of what the Faire is all about. First, that music can bring us out of our shells and make us more connected to one another. And second, that this cause is deeply, profoundly personal. Alestair’s father has cancer, which is why Alestair is so driven to make a difference. “I really want to help people become the best versions of themselves,” he writes. Embodying the Spirit of Relay and bringing us music that elevates and binds us to one another. If there is a better definition of what a Faireland DJ should be about we don’t know what it would be!\n\nAliya Heron\n\nIt’s always summer somewhere, and that somewhere is wherever Ali is spinning! The forecast calls for hot, hot, hot rockin’ Blues tunes (note to self: dig out ‘hawt-hawt-hawt’ gesture) from domestic to international. This is the party you’ve been waiting for, so wake up, dress down, and get ready to break a sweat!\n\nAlsedel Llewellyn\n\nAs a DJ in the so-called “Real” world, Alsedel brings a passion for music to the Fairelands that blends music genres together to create a smooth energetic mix that is sure to keep you dancing, whether it’s Jazz Standards, or Rock/Pop with a Fantasy twist. He is also a swordsmith, combat expert, writer, photographer, and musician. With a true Bard’s pedigree like that, you can see why we were so excited to let Alsedel take the helm of the Fairechylde! And as a cancer survivor himself, Alsedel understands why we come together each year to set sail for adventure and fellowship. Let the Unweaver know that it has made a powerful foe. And let the Fairelands know that we have an outstanding ally. Next stop, a world without cancer!\n\nAoife Lorefield\n\nLike all the members of Fantasy Faire’s Literary Festival team, Aoife has an abiding love for the music of the Spoken Word and a deep respect for its ability to transport us to far off lands and to pierce the veil of time. She also believes – as all good Fairelanders do! – that music has the same magical properties as the Spoken Word. So, whether she is DJing for Pagan events, for other communities, or taking the helm of the Fairechylde, she always spins from the heart. Traditional and World music, New Age and Mystical tracks, a pinch of Steampunk and a dash of Rock and Roll. Each turn of the page reveals the next chapter of the story, each track takes us somewhere uplifting. And that’s just what you want when you Relay For Life!\n\nArcadian Vanalten\n\nHaving worked on-air in radio after receiving a degree in Broadcasting and Communications, and DJing since 2008 in just about every type of club in the virtual world, Arcadian brings an ideal mix of experience and enthusiasm to the formidable task of being a Faireland DJ. Musical taste? Very, very eclectic! Soundtracks, World Music, Steampunk, Industrial/EBM, Rock and Roll, Humor – if we have a box to check, Arcadian checks it! And because cancer has been a big part of Arcadian’s family history, there is no one who is better qualified to speak to the cause that brings us all together each year. For all these reasons, Fantasy Faire Radio is honored to welcome Arcadian to our on-air team!\n\nBain Finch\n\nBain brings the feel good, upbeat, party music you need to start your day. He’s no stranger to the Fairelands or to the helm of the Fairechylde, and you won’t find a more committed Relayer on the grid. Bain is especially proud to support the Faire because we believe in getting behind the many ways that the American Cancer Society is taking the fight to cancer all across the globe. There is a legendary story that tells of Bain being the first person who tuned into a Fantasy Faire Radio broadcast the first year it was in existence. When we fired up the stream for the first time, just to test it out, Bain was the first person who IM’d to say, ‘Whatever this is, keep it going!’ And that’s what we have done, thanks to the support of amazing Relayers like Bain!\n\nBard Wasp\n\nThe one and only Bard Wasp, a perennial favorite on the grid and at the Faire. Bard’s knowledge of the blues is encyclopedic, and his sets are the stuff of legend. He’s also got one of the smoothest voices in the Many Realms. Stop by and get ready for the kind of music that makes you swoon! P.S. Special invite to all scantily clad, colossal ladies! (You’re welcome, Bard.)\n\nBriony Writer\n\nThere may only be one thing cooler than a Faireland Worldmaker, and that is a Faireland Worldmaker who is also a killer DJ. Bri’s sets are fun, feisty and fabulous! Her jam ranges in style but it’s always about letting go and dancing like no one is watching. She also brings the magic to her work across the grid, from fashion blogging for Seraphim, to taking point on the Social Media front for numerous high profile Second Life businesses, to being one of the lead organizers of the annual One Billion Rising in SL. We get tired just watching her! But then she spins, and we forget about being tired and just hold on tight. To quote Shakespeare, “she spins us right ’round, baby, Right ’round like a record, baby, Right ’round, ’round, ’round.”\n\nCalyope “Muse” Andel\n\nCalyope Andel also known as “Muse” has been a DJ in many game-environments and virtual worlds since 2002. “I love entertaining people. I love to play music and engage people, so they feel they’re a part of the scene not just listening to the music.” Favorite genres include Epic music, Dubstep, International, Bhangra, Latin, Rock, Hip Hop, Swing & Disco. You can find her on Utopia Skye Grid, as both Co-owner of the grid (along with her husband Mike Chase) and owner of the Golden Touch Theater (which does immersive artistic dance & music performances). You can contact her via discord (Muse#1111) to see where she’ll be next or for any questions.\n\nCatalina Staheli\n\nSuperhero by day (aka high school teacher) and SL content creator by night, Catalina loves promoting and celebrating this incredible world of Second Life. A caretaker, a volunteer with RFL since high school days, and one whose fantasy role play involves pretending that she actually sleeps, Cat is back with this year’s Fantasy Faire, where she’ll be playing inspirational hits loud and proud.\n\nChief Gunawan\n\nCay’s is the place to be every Friday night at 9pm, when Chief comes out of semi-retirement to bring rocking tunes all the way from Canada, eh? Take a bit of heritage from the Navajo, add in some Spanish and top with plenty of Irish and you’ve got the secret formula for a guy who rocks you the Canadian Way! Chief also served 20 years as a U.S. Navy – you guessed it! Chief! We thank him for his service, and on behalf of all who are about to rock, We Salute You, Chief!\n\nCorwyn Allen *Live Singer*\n\nA folk singer and guitarist, Corwyn has been performing in the physical world for many years, and in the virtual world for the last six years. His concerts are an eclectic mix of American, Irish, Scottish, and English folk music, both traditional and modern. Corwyn has been participating in the Faire and in other Relay For Life events for the last several years and has good reasons to do so. Cancer has affected many people in his life, including himself. Corwyn is proud to Relay and to help make real the vision of a World Without Cancer!\n\nCraig Obscure\n\nIf your taste in music runs toward the Dark Side, this is a set you won’t want to miss! Craig creates crepuscular atmospheres by mixing dark tracks. Underground dark electro, dark techno, acid techno, and traditional goth. Dim the lights and let Craig take you for a musical tour of the Shadows!\n\nDamien Darkness\n\nFrom clubs like Aqua Lounge to Stompz City Club Chaos, and at events ranging from SLB to Second Pride, Damien is a DJ who knows how to walk the line between the dark and the light. With a mix of Classic Rock that is Heaven on Earth, this dark master of the console brings the energy to a fevered pitch and keeps it there all night. He will – He will – Rock You!\n\nDanilao DeLuna\n\nSelf-described as a “proud nerd, elf and chef in RL,” Danilao has been doing the online radio thing since 2009, and here in SL since 2014. His first time in the Fairelands was in 2020, and he loved all of the fun of the Faire so much that he was delighted to come back this year! Playing to entertain a mass of fantastical beings with music he loves and for a cause he believes in wholeheartedly, that’s about as good as it gets for Danilao. We couldn’t agree more! (Wait…did he say “elf in RL?!” Dani for the Win!)\n\nDaveOSaurus\n\nA DJ set in SL can be a lot of different things, but the best ones are first and foremost about one thing in particular: Fun! And that is DaveOSaurus’ cue to enter! In addition to being a dynamite DJ, Dave is also a first-class Mesh-smith, Blogger, and occasional Pirate. Sometimes it’s Soundtracks, Steampunk, Humorous, Rock, Pop, and Dance, sometimes he takes it into the shadows with great Gothic tracks. Regardless, Dave is having a blast and makes it his business to see to it that you are as well. And as if all that wasn’t enough awesomism (Add to Dictionary. There! NOW it’s a word, stupid auto-correct), this year Dave adds a new title to the list: Fairelands Worldmaker!\n\nDeaD\n\nBecause not all of the Many Realms are bright, we’re stepping over the edge into jet black waters where dark things rise up for the Danse Macabre. We can’t say that we’re in “good” hands, but we are in the right ones for this particular journey. We’ve summoned DJ DeaD to give us a tour of the dark side of Fantasy. His infernal mix of Industrial/EBM tracks has been delighting the damned for more than six (six-six) years, and his Wicked Hellektro sets at Club Zero are that perfect marriage of pleasure and pain that some of us crave! Not for the faint of heart, but if you feel a desire for the metallic, the malevolent, and the madness of the Old Ones, this show is for you. Something wicked this way comes, and his name is DJ DeaD!\n\nDex Chaffe\n\nWith the laid-back DJ Dex at the wheel, the tracks can run from techno to goth, darkwave to post-punk, minimal, synth, industrial, electro-house, or classic alt. That sort of range is what you get when you’ve been behind the console since 2007! Equal parts soft-spoken and cheeky, Dex makes his Faireland debut this year, and we think he is going to become a new Fairechylde favorite. Come hear what we’ve been missing!\n\nEasy Ninetails\n\nYou may know him from Electro Space where he is a Resident DJ. You might know him from his sets here at the Faire from the last three years. Or maybe from his 25 years of DJ experience in the physical world! But if you don’t know him at all, you should! Easy is well named. Smooth, smooth, smoooooth. And packing a playlist that is always perfect for the setting. Sometimes he spins up the Techno or Breakbeat, sometimes Electro or Future House. It’s all about the Space and Time when Easy take the wheel. He isn’t shy about dressing the part either! You can count on some awesome tunes, some top-notch banter, and one hell of a good time!\n\nCaptain Edward Thatch Morgan\n\nThey say once you Party with a Pirate you’ll never go back. And Edward is proof that they are right. This Pirate DJ has been spinning from ports all across the grid for over a decade. His horde of musical booty is pure gold! Soundtracks, Traditional / World Music, New Age / Mystical, Steampunk, Symphonic Rock, Humorous, Renaissance, Rock / Pop / Dance, Industrial/EBM, Gothic, Metal , Pirate, Tribal, Viking and more. It’s music from across the Seven Seas! But unlike a lot of pirates out there, Edward loves to share his treasures. Don’t tell the Pirate Commission we said this, but Edward is also one of the kindest souls in the Many Realms! So, avast ye scurvy dogs! We be makin’ cancer walk the plank and thar be a place fer you on the crew! (Besides, you know you’ve been itching to break out that pirate outfit.)\n\nElizabeth Tinsley\n\nHer High Faireness, Elizabeth Tinsley (AKA DJ Tin-Tinz!) is in Fantasy Faire Radio’s broadcast booth for both Fairelanders’ Masked Balls. The boss loves to spin for Fairelanders, and after a long day at the Faire we could all use a little fun. So, suit up (or gown up, or feather up, or ya know, whatever your species does to look all fancy-shmancy) and join us for the Fairelanders’ Masked Ball.\n\nElrik Merlin\n\nA broadcaster and recording engineer/producer since the 1970s, Elrik Merlin has been a regular presenter and event DJ in Second Life since 2007. Since 2007, Elrik has been co-presenter of Designing Worlds, the award-winning TV series on design and designers in virtual worlds. In early 2021 he launched a brand-new radio station, Virtual Community Radio. Elrik is honoured to be invited back to play at Fantasy Faire 2021. Depending on the occasion, he plays a wide variety of music. No matter the setting or the style, Elrik always brings his love of music and passion for broadcasting to the fore.\n\nFemale Winslet\n\nDJ Female is a unique DJ with an eclectic style who has loved Relay for Life in Second Life since she joined the grid in 2006. She began her DJ career in 2018 and virtually never turns down a Relay for Life gig. She considers Relay for Life in Second Life to be among the best things she does in her real life. Now retired from SL DJing, she spends her time working as a photographer in real life and serving as part of the team for Nature First, the Alliance of Responsible Nature Photographers. But she still loves Relay and is more than happy to come back and spin for us!\n\nFuzzball Ortega\n\nFuzzball Ortega is the owner of Steelhead Bay and a member of the Steamland communities since 2006, due to his lycanthropy is dubbed The Lycan Lawman Of The Steamlands. He has been a part of Relay For Life of Second Life since 2008, captain of the Steelhead Salmons RFL team since 2010, and a part of Relay Radio since 2012. He’s also a part of the T1 Radio staff as well as a staff member of SciFi.Radio (which is not only the name of the station, but it’s also the web address), under the handle Gary DaBaum. During Relay events, Fuzz likes to keep the music upbeat, inspirational, and a lot of times humorous and unexpected.\n\nGem Sunkiller\n\nEveryone who takes up the title of Fairelander makes us proud, makes us stronger and moves us closer to building a World Without Cancer. When the burden of that task feels too great to bear, there is no one who comes in faster to take some of that weight off your shoulders than Gem Sunkiller. Being a Faireland DJ is just the start of what Gem has done for the Faire over the years. A full list of her kindnesses and contributions would beggar the imagination. Suffice to say that Gem is everything a Fairelander and a Relayer is supposed to be. She has led at the Team level and at the Community level. She has spun up more parties than most of us have even attended. And she does it all with a love for us all that is just what you need when you are feeling low. Add to that the fact that her sets are just 100% pure joy and you begin to understand why she is the one we call when Tinies are running amok and in need of a good jailin’!\n\nGinniji-san\n\nGinniji-san – AKA Silverfox Rainbow – is one of our favorite Faireland DJs! Think of a club scene in a super-cool Anime series and you’ll be getting close to Ginnjii’s vibe. You never know what you’re going to hear at one of Ginnjii’s sets. Anything from the 70’s on, awesome Soundtracks, totally random but upbeat tunes that lift your spirits and get you moving! But you can always count on it being energetic and fun. When we need a little extra energy, Ginnjii is the one we call!\n\nGlitch Axelrad\n\nBecause the FCC is probably listening right now (as well as the FBI, NSA, CIA, Interpol, and for reasons none of us are clear on – the Cleveland Ohio branch of the Moral Majority), the boys in legal have insisted that we state publicly “we have no idea who the hell this guy is.” Our official position is that Elayne has a bad habit of leaving the back door open and we can’t possibly be held liable for what happens after that. Having said as much, it is also Faire to say that Glitch is one of our favorite DJs (and this is the case despite that unfortunate 2018 live “Freebird” incident). When he’s not laughing maniacally and contributing to the moral decline of Western Civilization, Glitch breaks out tracks from Soundtracks to Rock, Pop and Dance, and from Industrial/EBM to Gothic. The rest of the time, he’s laughing maniacally and contributing to the moral decline of Western Civilization.\n\nHazard Fizzle\n\nThe owner and operator of [GHOST BOX] Radio, this cat is legendary! And his sets are the stuff that dreams are made of! A cinematic mix of new Dark Musiks – Industrial, EBM, Synthpop, Cyberpunk, Aggrotech, Witch House, Synthwave, and Dark Ambient. He brings it all and Fairelanders love to let go and get lost in the waves of Hazard’s mad, musical magic! So far, they’ve all found their way back. But anything can happen. Faire warning!\n\nHenning Heinkel\n\nAn American SL/RL entertainer, Henning has been bringing Goth, Synthpop, Industrial, Darkwave, EBM, and other alternative dark genres to the grid since 2008. 2022 marks his debut set in the Fairelands, and he is excited to be bringing awareness of the prevalence of cancer in our communities, and helping to raise money for a glorious cause: That the dark, and light sides of SL join hands, and help the ACS find a cure soon!\n\nIniry Vaher\n\nA 2013 Avi Choice Nominee, Iniry was inducted into the SL DJ Hall of Fame in 2018. She was a big hit, DJing for Second Life Birthdays 14, 15, 16, and 17. At the console, she can bring the Rock, Disco, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, R&B, Blues, Jazz, Latin, Freestyle, Musicals, and Today’s hits. She’ll rock out to hair bands, then turn around and sing along with Sinatra! Any musical regrets? One! She would have loved to party in Studio 54. Ya know, we bet we’ve got enough parts laying around here to throw together a decent time machine. Pack a bag and let’s do this!\n\nJacan Slade\n\nWhen you’ve been a SL DJ for the past 12 years, you are going to build up an impressive playlist. And that is exactly what Jacan has done! Playing blues, jazz, funk, soul, disco, and classic rock, Jacan knows how to raise the energy and keep it right where it needs to be. We are proud to welcome Jacan to the on-air team here at the Faire, and can’t wait to get lost in a set that promises to be one of the most memorable of the season!\n\nJAdmiral Maelstrom\n\nJAdmiral Maelstrom is the longest running DJ in SL, and DJ of Disco Tuesday Night– the longest running weekly event in SL! His sets are a total blast as he plays an on-air music trivia game and serves up baaaad jokes. JAdmiral says “To know me is to groan at me (or the jokes, or both).” It’s always Disco Night in the Fairelands whenever he shows up. Which reminds us… He’s already an Admiral, but the paperwork has now been finalized and we can announce that he is now officially the “Disco KNIGHT of the Fairelands!”\n\nKhaleesi “Kelsey” Shinn\n\nAfter 14 years as a DJ in the virtual world, Kelsey has got it down to an artform and a science both! Whether in clubs, private parties, weddings, rez-day celebrations, or big-time events like the Faire, Kelsey has one of those music libraries that covers the full spectrum. From Easy Listening, to hard Rock, Goth and House music. You want Soundtracks? She’s got you covered. World or new Age tracks? Check! Mystical, magical, and Fantasy? Verily and forsooth! Kelsey is a Fairelander through and through, and we love having her take the helm of the Fairechylde, especially because she is so supportive of other DJs who make the noble choice to Relay For Life!\n\nKirana Rawley\n\nDJ Kirana is back to deliver a wild mix of musical madness! She has been exploring the grid for 14 years and has been a DJ for much of that time. You can find her at Mystical Forest where she plays for audiences of Elves, Fae, Drow, Fauns and Satyrs, Mer, Centaurs and Dragons. But she also plays for denizens of the Vampire Empire at The Pit. And she has made appearances at the various Burning Man festivals in SL. Kirana has been a Fairelander for a long time! Like us, Kirana has good reasons to Relay. She is looking forward to the chance to once more share her passion for great music and for this noble cause and we’re looking forward to being there to hear it!\n\nKtahdn Vesuvino\n\nOne of our favorite DJs to hang with is the one and only KT! He’s always on point with his playlist, bringing the kind of tunes that the Fairelands are made of. He’s also always on message. KT knows why we’re here, what’s at stake, and how to get the job done with a lot of heart, style and spirit. So, take a break from exploring, shopping and Questing and join us in for a couple of hours of great music, and awesome company!\n\nLilith Von Hexem\n\nLilith has been a Second Life Resident since 2007. She has been a club girl since her second day in-world and started as a DJ in 2008. She is one of the owners of Sanctuary of Rock and also manages their events, marketing, and social media. Lilith is also a photographer and blogger. In fact, she’s blogged for Fantasy Faire off and on since 2014 and has been our go-to DJ for the epic Alia Baroque Jail and Bail event for the past 4 years. “Fantasy Faire is THE event of the year!” says Lilith. “Every year I look forward to seeing the amazing sim designs, the special events and of course all the shopping. It also allows me to further support Relay for Life and the fight against cancer.” A message which, just like her sets, is pitch perfect!\n\nMadonna Daehlie\n\nClad in armor made of that most magical of materials (latex!), booted and bewitching, when Maddie takes the helm the Unweaver starts quaking in his shoes! This fourteen-year veteran of Relay has been an indispensable part of the Faire for over a decade. We keep her pretty busy too! She is a techno-mage of the highest order. Got an RFL Vendor or Donation Kiosk that just refuses to play nice? Call Maddie! Looking for advise on how to make your fundraising more effective? Maddie to the rescue! Need to turn up the heat on a dance party? You guessed it! Maddie is your best bet. From Soundtracks, to Rock, Pop and Club music, there is one thing you can always count on. Maddie is going to give 110% (we suspect she keeps the extra 10% in her awesome Up-Do!).\n\nMagda Kamenev\n\nMagda has been a DJ in SL since 2008 (Omgracious!) and likes wide-ranging sets of music – something from the 1930s and something released just a week ago can make its way into her set. Mixing the familiar and the new, the comfortable and the surprising, is Magda’s raison d’etre as a DJ. Equal parts twee, intense, corny, and hedonistic. (Not for nothing, that is also the exact parts list for any given Fantasy Faire!)\n\nMaggi Morpath\n\nMaggi has spent most of her life as a professional bassoon player and took up singing after arriving in SL a few years ago. She sings a wide range of styles – show tunes, movie hits, folk, a little country and her beloved Beatles, but has a special love for songs from the Great American Songbook. We’re delighted to be welcoming her back to the Fairelands for a live concert that is all heart!\n\nMarkus Zorin\n\nFor Marcus, it’s all about the joy of music. He started his journey as a DJ in Second Life back in 2018 and hasn’t looked back since. Marcus says this has been one of the most satisfying endeavors he has ever dedicated his efforts to. In fact, he feel that he’s ready to take that passion outside of SL and looks to start a new career path in RL Radio! “DJing is an artform, “ Marcus writes. “The ability to mix two or more songs to create frequencies that never existed before is part of the sonic experience I wish to provide my listeners.” We love a good Techno DJ, whether in SL, RL or any other L for that matter. Fantasy Faire is proud to welcome Markus to our on-air team, and to be part of his musical journey!\n\nMattie Carlton\n\nMattie grew up in the Missouri Ozarks. Having lived near Branson and spending a lot of time there seeing shows and also having family who performed for Silver Dollar City, shi was raised on country music, blues, bluegrass, and classic rock. Shi still has a great passion for these genres, country being her favorite. Music has always gotten hir though some of the worst times in hir life, and now shi loves to share some of these wonderful tunes with folks here in SL as a Tiger-Striped, 9 Tailed Fox!\n\nMavromichali Szondi\n\nAlthough he has been involved in RFL for many years – starting out as part of the Caledon fundraising team and then getting more involved with performances, the hunts, and the occasional bit of building – it was only last year that Mav decided to try his hand at being a DJ, right here at the Faire! He had so much fun (and we loved his set so much) that we were delighted that he decided to return for an encore this year. With musical styles ranging from EDM to Pop, from Electro Swing to Soundtrack Remixes, Mav Relays for a number of friends lost to cancer both in-world and out. He is also the voice of Mr. Biggins, a beloved character who will soon be returning to the Faireland’s Silver Screen!\n\nOtenth Paderborn\n\nThe word “Eclectic” was made for Otenth Paderborn. This long-time Friend of the Faire has been DJing for Fairelanders for years now, and in Second Life since 2007 including with Radio Riel where he produced a monthly show called “The Musical Magpie.” An apt name, indeed! You never know what you’ll hear when Otenth is at the helm, but it is always high quality. Otenth enjoys surprising people with his musical selections, as he DJs for the mind as well as the ear. He’s also one of the nicest people you could ever hope to meet. We are always proud to have Otenth at the wheel, especially because he is so committed to the vision of a World Without Cancer!\n\nPietor Grigorovich\n\nPietor live-mixes a range of downtempo and midtempo electronic dance music that usually incorporates world music of all kinds. He is a resident DJ at a number of SL venues (most notably Organica, Commune Utopia and Elysion). His magical live-mixed sets include electronic genres such as psybient, downtempo, psybass, organic house, folktronica, deep house, sacred bass and more. He has been featured at Burn2, SL Birthday celebrations, RFL fundraisers and a variety of events across the grid. “I love participating in Fantasy Faire,” Pietor tells us. “It brings together two aspects of SL that mean a lot to me – exploring fantasy realms and helping others.” That intersection is the beating heart of the Fairelands, and when Pietor spins there is nowhere we’d rather be!\n\nPunkY Fitzgerald\n\nPunkY got into music after being “forced to learn dance and piano” as a kid. From there, she evolved and found her true passion (Darn moms and their annoying habit of being right). That passion includes Steampunk, Industrial/EBM, Gothic, 80’s,disco, and Electroswing. Add to that list of passions “Shopping at the Faire” and you can see why we adore this self-described “punky, little Goth chick” who has been Relaying for many years! “I love what you all do!” PunkY says. “It is something personally close to my heart as a survivor, so kudos to you!” And to you too, PunkY! You and the Fairelands were made for one another!\n\nPrudence Jekyll\n\nPru was a licensed broadcaster on a Public radio station back in the 1980s. Music is essential to her First Life and naturally incorporate it into her Second Life too! Pru finds that sharing her musical experience with others is a gratifying experience, especially when she can introduce someone to music that they didn’t already know they loved. Traditional / World Music, New Age / Mystical, Industrial/EBM, Gothic, Progressive House/Electronic for a futuristic fantasy theme – Pru’s sets take you to far-off, mystical shores. That’s why she loves to spin for the Fairelands. She also tells us that supporting Relay For Life has been her most gratifying experience in Second Life. We hear you loud and clear, Pru!\n\nRahdu Rajesh\n\nRah has been a DJ in Second Life for over a decade. She has been mixing for the last six. Rah is a creative soul through and through. Although she had always been mostly a visual artist, Second Life was an outlet that nourished her musical side. Rah’s sets are made up of many musical genres. She started out DJing metal and mixing Hardstyle. Since then, she has learned to mix Electro house, Dubstep, DnB, Bass house, Afro house, Tech house, Jacking house, Deep house, Melodic techno, Dark techno, Minimal techno and recently she has been learning more “synthie” genres including Synthpop, EBM and Industrial. Currently, Rah identifies as a Techno DJ with a wide range of musical influences.\n\nRapa Tone\n\n“The value of life can be measured by how many times your soul has been deeply stirred.” That is a quote from the profile of DJ Rapa Tone, and we completely agree. It’s also what you get at one of Rapa’s sets. With a great love for Melodic Progressive tracks and for Uplifting Trance, this professional DJ from Japan can be heard on Osaka Sunrise from Digitally Imported Radio. Another of Rapa’s favorite quotes is, “Sometimes a Sakura is just a Sakura.” Indeed! And sometimes, a Cherry Blossom unfolds to reveal something so deeply stirring that your soul is never quite the same. Great music can make us more human, and that is exactly what Rapa’s sets do.\n\nRecki Laville\n\nDJ of Industrial, Techno, Drum & Bass and more, Recki is a strong supporter of a music community without boundaries. Recki created Electro Space in May 2019; an electronic music community welcoming developing and experienced DJs of all electronic genres across Industrial and EDM. A space for DJs and friends to come and Jam together. “This is the 3rd year an Electro Space DJ team has performed at Fantasy Faire,” Recki says. “I am always excited to be a part of this amazing event. A true essence of togetherness and freedom, I get goosebumps performing, exploring and absorbing the wonder of it all!”\n\nRox Arten\n\nThe talent behind Secrets of Gaia, and organizer of the infamous Twisted Hunts brings yet another of her talents to us as she takes to the decks to entertain you with her musical stylings. She is a versatile and highly experienced internet radio broadcaster and virtual world DJ with a background as a classically trained musician who plays multiple instruments and education that includes audio production. Her skills, alongside her magnetic personality and kind generous spirit shine bright! She is just as at ease in a club, an intimate private party, or any event setting catering her look and playlist to the needs of the set. Her typical sets are a well woven tapestry of wide-ranging genres, each a different colored thread to paint a masterpiece of sound for her listeners, as she reads the crowd and adjusts on the fly. With over 15 years of experience behind her, this is one DJ who’s set you don’t want to miss.\n\nRuth Spiritor\n\nRuth lives the One Team philosophy of Relay For Life. Her team, Cure Chasers, has been part of Fantasy Faire’s One Team Initiative for many years and when she says that we’re all in this together, she means it! Cure Chasers are Fairelanders and vice versa. We all march proudly under our own team banners but flying over them is the Purple flag of RFL and our eyes are fixed on the same destination: A World Without Cancer! At the helm, Ruth loves to spin for Relayers, and she can bring it all. Soundtrack, New Age / Mystical, Symphonic Rock, Rock / Pop / Dance, Gothic, and Country. No matter the style or the venue, this is one Relayer who knows how to rock!\n\nSasha Allardyce\n\nSasha grew up in the era of what we now know as Classic Rock and Soul and began learning about Blues music when she joined SL in March 2009. She loved hearing other DJs so much that she realized how much fun it would be to share the tunes she loves with others, and she was right! Sasha has been supporting Relay For Life since she first learned of it. She lost her father to a brain tumor when she was just seven years old. Cancer has also affected her mom and her daughter, who is still undergoing treatment and is doing great! So, when Sasha says that her commitment to Relay has grown stronger and stronger, you know she means it! Sasha is here until cancer is gone from all our lives once and for all! Join her for a set that might include the Blues, Soul, and R&B!\n\nSmurfie Sands\n\nBack by popular demand, The Flying Dutch Woman is very excited about performing again for Fantasy Faire. Despite her name, Smurfie is neither blue nor tiny. In fact, this Fairelander is also a Netherlander who currently lives in the US. When she DJs, the most important thing for Smurfie is to have fun. Her playlist includes Blues, Disco, and Rock and Roll. The always delightful Smurfie returns to steal your heart and play the kind of tunes that guarantee you’ll be having as much fun as she is!\n\nStephanie Gardner\n\nStephanie has been making quite a name for herself as a DJ in Second Life with her mix of Blues tunes. You name it, she’s got it. Including a deep passion for supporting Relay For Life. Like far too many of us, Stephanie has lost friends and loved ones to cancer, so she is stepping up and taking the helm of the Fairechylde to bring us a set that will send the Unweaver packing. This is music that feeds the soul, so bring an appetite for awesome tunes and Stephanie will take care of the rest!\n\nStinna Sky *Live Singer*\n\nFor as long as she can remember, Stinna has had a passion for music and singing. That passion has manifested itself in many ways; In choir singing from Danish Traditional to Gospel. In musical theatre; In live shows streamed on YouTube, and here in Second Life since 2010. Wherever the music takes her, it has given her comfort, strength, and a lot of great fun over the years. With roots that run that deep, it’s little wonder that she also has a passion for using that gift in support of Relay For Life, and to enrich the One Team spirit.\n\nTamlorn Carterhaugh Wood\n\nFrom his woodland sanctuary where the Old Ways are still kept, Tamlorn makes the journey each year to the Fairelands, bringing with him the blend of magic, music, and light for which the Wood Elves are so well known. Music can create stunning vistas in our mind’s eye. Tamlorn takes that to a higher level, as he paints with sound and immerses us in those mystical realms. In the physical world, Tamlorn has been steeped in a love for symphonic, operatic and ballet music since he was very young, and has long been involved with numerous music festivals and events. Relaying is a true mission for Tamlorn. He knows all too well what it means to lose people you love to this foul disease. And last year, when technical difficulties kept one of our DJs from being able to play for an important event, Tamlorn stepped up and heroically took the helm with only two minutes notice, a feat requiring tremendous courage and heart. For his dedication to the Faire and to the vision of a World Without Cancer, we embrace our brother – Tamlorn, Laird of Rosemont Woodlands. A true Friend of the Fairelands!\n\nThundergas Menges\n\nSee that dark, ominous cloud on yonder horizon? Believe it or not, that is very good news! Riding high atop is Thunder, one of the best Blues DJs ever to make it rain. He brings a powerful mix of Blues styles that make for one heck of a party. We’d say you should break out your dancing shoes, but you might be better off in galoshes. Better yet, just go barefoot and soak up the vibe as the Fairechylde rocks and rolls in the coming storm of Blues. With a God of Thunder at the helm, we’re in good hands!\n\nTigerPawz Morningstar and RhosiePaws Wytchwood\n\nThis First and Second Life Husband and Wife team have been entertaining audiences in the virtual world since 2015. From Soundtracks, Steampunk, Symphonic Rock, Humor, and Rock / Pop / Dance (With a Fantasy twist!), their sets offer something for everyone. Rhosie is also a Survivor of more than one brush with cancer, so Relay For Life is an important cause to them both! Their love for one another, for great music, and for the audience all shine brightly when they spin, hand in hand. Join them for a set that is a beautiful fairy tale in it’s own right!\n\nTrader Whiplash-Ballinger\n\nThe Co-Founder Relay Rockers, and the man behind the curtain at T1 Radio! Trader is also a Leukemia Survivor, a winner of the Spirit of Relay Award, and the host of Relay Rap which celebrates Relay and Relayers in Second Life. This AviChoice Favorite Radio DJ winner knows classic rock, and when he brings the Relay Rap team to broadcast from the Fairelands each year there are always some great tunes as well. With so many great reasons to Relay, including for the Caregivers who have helped keep him strong, Trader is one of the most passionate Relayers on the grid. Join him on Sunday, April 24th as Relay Rap welcomes special guests from the Fairelands in celebration of the global community of Relayers who are helping to make the vision of a World Without Cancer a reality!\n\nTrinket Xenno\n\nTrinket started The Symphonic Experience (TSE) in 2014. Having seen there was some segregation between music genres and being a lover of all music, she started TSE to be a low-spam group to provide music information, and to keep members in the know of parties, events and charities. TSE has been involved in hosting benefits for lost SL members, wild fires, animal rescue and helping to feed community members and keep them from going homeless. TSE is not a stranger to large scale events, hosting large parties with 70+ DJs per event on the grid. Trinket is a music lover and has found a way to share her party planning and knowledge of music and networking with clubs and DJs through TSE. This will be TSE’s 4th Fantasy Faire and they look forward to many more!\n\nTom Harley\n\nDJing in Second Life for 8 years, Trance truly changed Tom’s life. Tom is a passionate performer and loves to make people feel love and happiness through his music choices. It’s always a party when Tom’s performing at Fantasy Faire!\n\nVasa Vella\n\nIf you’ve never partied with a Satyr, you don’t know what you’re missing! Vasa is a longtime Friend of the Fairelands, and his sets are just the excuse you’ve been looking for to get a little wyld. Vasa spins high energy sets of Rock and Roll, Pop hits, and music that gets you moving. Fabulous, fun, and flirty are all words that come to mind, and probably helps explain why Dionysus himself loves to hang out with this guy.\n\nVile – The Fiend\n\nIt says a lot about how bad the Unweaver is when some of the darkest fiends in the Many Worlds line up against it! Vile is one of those fiends – here to take the fight to cancer with the kind of sets for which he is so well known as the DJ Manager of Electronic Music at Cruz Kontrol. He breaks out the big-room tunes to spin up a devilish mix of dark delights. With his sun in Sagittarius and Aries rising, you know the Unweaver is going to “get the point!”"
