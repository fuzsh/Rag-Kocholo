        "text": "By Johnny Cole\n\nThere have been many iconic female figures in pop music history, but only one truly deserves the title of “The Queen of Pop,” and that is Madonna Louise Ciccone. No other music artist in history has evolved and successfully reinvented themself as often as Madonna.\n\nWith a career spanning more than four decades, Madonna has accomplished everything she set out to do in the early 80s. During Madonna’s first appearance on American Bandstand, she was asked by Dick Clark about her goals, and she replied “to rule the world.” Throughout her long career, she has received equal doses of critical acclaim and public backlash for her explicit dissection of sex, power, and religion, which has only enhanced her popularity.\n\nMadonna is one of the most successful recording artists in music history. She has sold over 300 million records worldwide and has dominated Billboard’s Dance Club Songs chart with 50 number one singles. Her single “Hung Up” from the 2005 album Confessions on a Dance Floor became her best-charting song worldwide and earned a place in the 2007 Guinness Book of World Records for topping the charts in the most countries (41 countries). Madonna has received a staggering number of accolades and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008.\n\nIn 2023, despite serious health setbacks, the 65-year-old music icon returned to the world stage on her now successful “Celebration Tour.”\n\nRanking Madonna’s singles from 1982 to the present (all Billboard charts mentioned are from the U.S.):\n\n● 1. “Borderline” (from the album Madonna, 1983; reached #10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #4 on Billboard’s Dance Club Songs chart) *written by Reggie Lucas.\n\n● 2. “Live to Tell” (from the At Close Range soundtrack, 1986; reached #1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard’s Adult Contemporary chart *written by Madonna and Patrick Leonard.\n\n● 3. “Crazy for You” (from the Vision Quest soundtrack, 1985; reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #2 on Billboard’s Adult Contemporary chart) *written by John Bettis and Jon Lind.\n\n● 4. “Papa Don’t Preach” (from the album True Blue, 1986; reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #4 on Billboard’s Dance Club Songs chart) *written by Madonna and Brian Elliot.\n\n● 5. “Holiday” (from the album Madonna, 1983; reached #16 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on Billboard’s Dance Club Songs chart) *written by Curtis Hudson and Lisa Stevens-Crowder.\n\n● 6. “Like a Prayer” (from the album Like a Prayer, 1989; reached #1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard’s Dance Club Songs chart) *written by Madonna and Patrick Leonard.\n\n● 7. “Vogue” (from the album I’m Breathless: Music from and Inspired by the Film Dick Tracy, 1990; reached #1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and two of Billboard’s Dance charts) *written by Madonna and Shep Pettibone.\n\n● 8. “Express Yourself” (from the album Like a Prayer, 1989; reached #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on two of Billboard’s Dance charts) *written by Madonna and Stephen Bray.\n\n● 9. “Justify My Love” (from the compilation album The Immaculate Collection, 1990; reached #1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and two of Billboard’s Dance charts) *written by Lenny Kravitz, Ingrid Chavez, and Madonna.\n\n● 10. “Open Your Heart” (from the album True Blue, 1986; reached #1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard’s Dance Club Songs chart) *written by Madonna, Gardner Cole, and Peter Rafelson.\n\n● 11. “Erotica” (from the album Erotica, 1992; reached #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on two of Billboard’s Dance charts) *written by Madonna, Shep Pettibone, and Anthony Shimkin.\n\n● 12. “I’ll Remember” (from the With Honors soundtrack, 1994; reached #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on Billboard’s Adult Contemporary chart) *written by Madonna, Patrick Leonard, and Richard Page of Mr. Mister.\n\n● 13. “Like a Virgin” (from the album Like a Virgin, 1984; reached #1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard’s Dance Club Songs chart) *written by Tom Kelly and Billy Steinberg.\n\n● 14. “Into the Groove” (featured in the movie Desperately Seeking Susan, but not on its 1984 soundtrack.
