        "text": "GAINESVILLE | Rock 'n' roll pioneer Bo Diddley, whose famous beat became a building block of rock 'n' roll and inspired generations from Bruce Springsteen to Tom Petty, died early Monday at his home near Archer.\n\nThe 79-year-old musician died of heart failure, said spokeswoman Susan Clary. Born Ellas Otha Bates in McComb, Miss., he had suffered a stroke while on tour in Iowa in May, 2007, and suffered a heart attack three months later.\n\nHe had been recovering at home near Archer in Alachua County, where he had lived for more than 20 years. \"He gave the world so much,\" said Scott Free, a guitarist and longtime family friend who performed with Diddley in the 1980s after he had begun dating the singer's daughter, Tammi McDaniel. \"He was really, really sweet; a really generous person, almost to a fault.\"\n\nWith Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Elvis Presley, Fats Domino and Jerry Lee Lewis, Diddley became one of the architects of rock 'n' roll in the mid-1950s. The guitarist/singer/songwriter scored major pop hits with \"Bo Diddley\" and \"I'm a Man\" in 1955 on Chicago's Chess Records, and drew attention to rock 'n' roll's backbeat on a label primarily known for the blues.\n\nFrom there, his \"dunt da dunt da dunt, da dunt dunt\" beat became an integral and instantly identifiable part of rock 'n' roll's grammar.\n\nAnd his sound influenced artists in styles as diverse as rockabilly, punk, hip-hop, British invasion pop and others. \"It's not the number of notes you play, it's the notes you select,\" Free said about the beat.\n\nOver the years, Diddley variously claimed to have adapted the beat from music he heard in church, from trying to play the Gene Autry song \"Jingle Jangle\" and from attempting to play his guitar like a drum.\n\nThe \"Bo Diddley beat\" could be heard in countless hits, from Buddy Holly's \"Not Fade Away\" and The Who's \"Magic Bus\" to Elvis Presley's \"His Latest Flame,\" Tom Petty's \"American Girl,\" George Michael's \"Faith\" and Bruce Springsteen's \"She's the One.\"\n\nDiddley's \"Who Do You Love\" was memorably covered by guitarist George Thorogood in 1978.\n\nBorn Dec. 30, 1928, in McComb, Miss., Diddley was raised by his mother's cousin, Gussie McDaniel, and moved with her to Chicago at age 7. Accounts of the origin of his stage name vary widely, but he had begun to use it by 1954, when he recorded \"I'm a Man\" and his namesake song at Chess Records' studios on the Southside of Chicago.\n\nDiddley was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 and received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1998. His last recording, \"A Man Amongst Men\" (Code Blue/Atlantic) received a Grammy nomination.\n\nHe had continued to perform into 2007, until he suffered a stroke in May, 2007, in Council Bluffs, Iowa, followed by a heart attack in August.\n\nDiddley always thought that he and Chuck Berry had started rock 'n' roll, and the fact that he couldn't financially reap all that he had sowed made him a deeply suspicious man.\n\n(While perhaps suspicious, though, Diddley could be compassionate as well. Lakeland resident Lu Fitzwater fondly recalls a personal encounter with Diddley. Preparing to board a plane with her small daughter, Fitzwater was told the plane was overbooked and denied a seat. Diddley was a passenger on the plane. When he noticed the problem he intervened on her behalf and she and her daughter were then allowed to board.)\n\n\"I tell musicians, 'Don't trust nobody but your mama,'\" he said in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine in 2005. \"And even then, look at her real good.\"\n\nDiddley is survived by his children, Evelyn Kelly, Ellas A. McDaniel, Tammi D. McDaniel and Terri Lynn McDaniel, as well as 15 grandchildren, 15 great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren.\n\nPrivate and public services are planned for this weekend.\n\n[ Bill Dean writes for The Gainesville Sun.
