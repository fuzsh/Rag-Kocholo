        "text": "Spaghetti Eastern\n\nspotify\n\nSpaghetti Eastern Electro Dub is the genre-leaping project led by NYC & Hudson Valley-based guitarist/keyboardist Sal Cataldi. Like his solo project Spaghetti Eastern Music, the Spaghetti Eastern Electro Dub spin-off marries acid jazz-guitar-driven instrumentals and improvs with ambient soundscapes that are peppered with elements of Jamaican dub, funk, progressive rock and free jazz. Cataldi is abetted in the project by bassist Tom “Spontaneous” Semioli, drummers Dirk Drazen and Dave Donen and an Eastern music master, dilbura player/sitarist Dawoud “The Sufi Renegade” Kringle. Cataldi debuted Spaghetti Eastern with the critically-acclaimed 2016 album, “Sketches of Spam,” which has been followed with a number of EPs and singles. The New York Times says Cataldi “has a beat unmistakably his own” while Time Out New York praises his \"delicate guitar work and the hauntingly moody atmosphere he conjures.” Called “beautiful and unique” by WFUV’s Mixed Bag and “charmingly melodic and off-center” by WFMU. Hudson Valley One has called Spaghetti Eastern “part Sergio Leone fever dream, part Ravi Shankar raga, a whirling dervish of musical creation.” Chronogram Magazine called his recent release, the exploratory solo guitar score for the dance piece 2x2x4, “cool, melodic, inspired and transcendent, a wave of sonic warmth and light.” Psychedelic Baby Magazine calls it “the perfect sonic tonic for these troubled times.” Cataldi is also a member of the ambient guitar duo Guitars A Go Go, the poetry/music project Vapor Vespers and the psych/surf quartet, Spaceheater.

Most people don’t get that chance to capture it and store it in a bottle. This song is more than a song, it’s a photograph to me.” Taking a different path from his last record that was filled with fictional characters, writing about his life came as a challenge leaving Luce to contemplate what it means to share the rest of your life with someone. “When the unwritten road is yours it’s not about plot points but on feelings like faith and looking back on all the little things that had to go your way. It makes you humble.” Throughout Gemini Luce paints a picture of the neighborhood and the life he leads: “Every Sunday we go to our grocery store that plays old Italian songs over the PA and my wife says it was placed there by her grandfather for us.” After writing Gemini, Luce recruited singer-songwriter Sam Weber to produce. “I felt Gemini was my song but a kindred spirit to what I heard Sam was doing. I listened to his records the last couple years and loved his Easy Street EP, that convinced me to reach out.” Mastered by Justin Perkins from Mystery Room Mastering and mixed by Sean Sullivan (Molly Tuttle, Tyler Childers) the 3 of them crafted a dynamic sound to wrap around Luce’s voice. “ I feel my voice on Gemini is strong yet gentle. I had to keep it hidden from my wife for a long time and somehow that helped when I really had to sing it for her.” Gemini is a song that is awash in textures and sounds that add a new palette to Luce’s songs while keeping his songwriting grounded in our brief moments of joy. “Passages in our life are so brief, writing this song was the only way to keep it.”\n\nView Event →\n\nWill Phelps\n\ninstagram | website\n\nWill Phelps is a multidisciplinary artist based in Brooklyn.

He honed his skills as a performer playing New York clubs with his band 3rd Man Out before striking out on his own, making his bones as a solo act in the ground zero of the American folk movement, Greenwich Village's the Bitter End. He later headed south of Mason-Dixon line spending time in Nashville before landing in Austin, TX in 2003. While in Austin Jamie shared the stage with Texas music legends Bill Carter (writer of Crossfire for SRV) and Charlie Sexton (Bob Dylan, Elvis Costello).

A year later, after purchasing a forty-foot school bus and traveling the country passing out CDs to radio stations, Natále flew to México City to record her next single, a Spanish reggae song, Moreno, with the help of Latin Grammy nominated legend, Fidel Nadal (Todos Tus Muertos). The two worked closely together, co-producing and writing in Camilo Lara’s recording studio (Mexican Institute of Sound), and released Moreno in 2021, expanding and growing her audiences to Latin America. Inspired by the vibrant culture and artist community, Natále decided to stay in México, where she has been living for the past two and a half years, engaging with local musicians and exchanging ideas. In February 2022, she recorded her latest single, Do You Believe It?, with members of the Mexican reggae band Antidoping, and received support and guidance from the legendary two-time Grammy winning engineer Errol Brown (Bob Marley & The Wailers, Ziggy Marley, Steel Pulse, Shaggy). Currently, Natále is focusing on songwriting and recording, for her upcoming album release - including a collaboration with Grammy winning producer, Austen Jux-Chandler (Adele, Kali Uchis, Ed Sheeran, Lady Gaga) - while also writing for TV and film, including the number one hit Netflix series in Colombia - “La Primera Vez” and a feature film to be released in theaters in México this November. Natále continues to perform live with her band, playing festivals alongside legendary artists such as The Jacksons, The Gipsy Kings, UB40, The Village People, and Buena Vista All Stars.\n\nView Event →\n\nDillon Havins\n\ninstagram | website\n\nDillon Havins grew up on a small farm in Dripping Springs, Texas, and started performing gigs across Texas at the age of ten.
