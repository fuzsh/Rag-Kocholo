        "text": "Roy Orbison: One of the lonley ones / Hound dog man\n\nI became a fan of Roy Orbison as a teenager in the early '90s when his last album was released after he passed away suddenly. I then made my way back through his music, and now I have the Big O always firmly in my music-loving heart.\n\nListening to Roy Orbison is like recalling a memory of my childhood. Okay, so it's a strange memory of a man dressed in black and singing about heartbreak, but that's the kind of kid I was.\n\nIf I had to choose between Roy and his pretty-boy contemporary Elvis Presley, I'd take Roy any day. I have a thing for the vintage sound of early Rock 'n' roll, and I think Roy Orbison created his distinct version of it.\n\nI first heard Roy Orbison when his final album came out in 1988, warbling out You Got it. I fell for his ephemeral voice and slowly worked my way backwards through the catalogue of one of the founders of mainstream American Rock and Roll.\n\nUnfortunately, Orbison had a massive heart attack and died the same year his new Mystery Girl album came out, just as it was set to become an enormous success.\n\nBless his soul; he had one hell of a voice tinged with darkness and tragedy (losing his first wife in a motorcycle accident and later his two eldest sons in a house fire while he was away on tour). His songwriting was all about honesty and emotion without any sentimentality.\n\nIn short, I loved Roy to death. He spoke to me as an artist; he could also tell a great story and be famous without losing himself.\n\nThe tall slim, and rather pale Texan didn't fit into the usual Rock star mould. He was painfully shy, soft-spoken, with terrible eyesight. He was mercilessly teased in high school for his plain looks, thick-lensed glasses and shyness. But he knew he could sing, and as soon as he could get his hands on a guitar, he learnt how to play and quickly began to write songs.\n\nAs a young child, Orbison would take his guitar and play outside the local grocery store in his tiny Texan country hometown of Wink. The town was so small, Orbison quipped; if you 'winked', you'd miss it.\n\nPeople soon noticed his big sweet tenor voice, and he began to front and play in several local bands. He formed his own band in high school, which played in nearby towns. His obsession with music, guitar playing and songwriting sealed his fate for a lifetime career as a musician.\n\nRoy Orbison was always a strange fit in the music industry; his love of the ballad made him stand out in the catchy pop ditty, creating hits of the 50s and 60s.\n\nOrbison was always painfully shy while performing; he never talked to the audience. He never moved a muscle or danced during his performances, and he even barely opened his mouth to sing. Yet when he did sing, he revealed one of the best voices ever heard in rock and roll, a powerful tenor voice with an impressive three-octave range and a glass-shattering falsetto.\n\nThe incredible thing is that he never really looked after his voice; there are many videos of him smoking and drinking coca-cola in the recording studio. Smoking and caffeine were something I'm sure also didn't help him with his heart problems either.\n\nDespite his incredible talent, Roy always suffered from terrible stage fright. While on tour with the Beatles in 1963, he forgot his regular glasses on the plane and was forced to wear his prescription tinted glasses on stage. He discovered he prefered them, so he developed a sunglass-wearing, dark and brooding stage image, which helped him hide and perform more comfortably.\n\nRoy Orbison's songbook comprises the most extensive songs about heartbreak, loneliness, dark emotions, paranoia, regret, despair, dreams and nightmares. He was the first man to sing openly about his feelings and fears. Some of his most loved songs include heartbreaking epics like Only the lonely, Crying, In dreams and Running Scared. His song Pretty Woman is one of the most loved and recognised tunes ever written. He turned his love Lorne persona into the guy who gets the girl at the end, unleashing sexy, sensual energy, which wins over his pretty woman.\n\nThe origins of Orbison's music are firmly in his country music roots. Growing up listening to Hank Williams and other artists from the Grand Old Opry, the influence of the country genre is evident.\n\nOrbison's career spanned five decades, starting as a professional performer in the 1950s and releasing 22 studio albums from the 1960s to the early 90s.\n\nDespite tremendous heartbreak and tragedy in his life, he never really stopped writing music, recording records and touring.\n\nRoy Orbison married his high school sweetheart Claudette Frady in 1957; they had three boys Anthony King, Roy Dewayne and Wesley.\n\nClaudette was killed in a tragic motorcycle accident, leaving Roy alone to bring up his three boys.\n\nWhile on tour in the UK in 1968, he received the news that his home in Hendersonville, Tennessee, had burned down and his two eldest sons had died.\n\nOrbison later remarried a German teenager Barbara Jakobs in 1969 and had two more sons, Alex and Roy Jr. From his first wife, his youngest son, Wesley, was raised by Orbison's parents.\n\nAfter these tragedies, Roy Orbison's career took a turn for the worst, as his style of music became deeply unpopular. After a terrible attempt at starting a film career in his corny Western The Fastest Guitar Alive, which was a bow office flop and an unsuccessful Hank Williams cover album, he became lost and directionless.\n\nOrbison continued to record albums, despite the lack of any real major success. His fan base in the UK, Europe and Australia was very loyal, so he tirelessly toured and performed even in smaller venues. He still performed his now-classic favourites to the delight of audiences, and he never really lost his voice, which never abandoned him.\n\nIn 1977 he had major heart surgery, a triple bypass which was a significant operation to unblock severely obstructed arteries. He suffered from ulcers since 1960 and had been a heavy smoker since adolescence.\n\nIn the 80s, his music was rediscovered by a new generation of listeners, helped by other artists who covered his songs, and the use of his music in movies like Roadie, the Dukes of Hazzard and the feature film Blue Velvet.\n\nOne of the events that relaunched his career was his big comeback concert in 1988. Roy Orbison and friends: a black and white night included a wonderfully brilliant selection of Oribison's admirers and friends who came together in a one-off concert performance to celebrate the legendary Texan with the biggest voice and magical songwriting talent.\n\nThe concert lineup included: Elvis Costello, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Waits, T Bone Burnett, Jennifer Warnes, K.D Lang and Bonnie Raitt. It was an excellent star-studded concert with its performers, and there were many famous people in the audience.\n\nRoy Orbison was also a great collaborator throughout his career, which kept his work evergreen and constantly renewed. He allowed his songs to be covered by new artists, and he also recorded with different artists. He recorded a now-historic album, Class of 55, with other American Rock and roll legends, including Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Johnny Cash.\n\nOrbison also recorded songs with the Bee Gees and, simultaneously with his last album, performed with other music greats Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne and George Harrison, who formed the now legendary super band the Travelling Wilburys.\n\nHis final album, Mystery Girl, was produced by ELO's frontman Jeff Lynne and included songs written by Lynne, Elvis Costello, Bono and Tom Petty.\n\nChoosing my favourite songs from Roy Orbison's long catalogue isn't easy. I love most of them as each album reflected Orbison's experiments and particular style through the decades. No one can ignore the early rockabilly sounds of his 1950s classic Rock House. Or his big hits of the 60s at the height of his early fame, from Crying to in Dreams. I also enjoyed his mostly ignored 1970s experimental album Laminar Flow. Orbison prided himself on being a rebel, and he always followed whatever he wanted to explore or express, as most great artists do.\n\nOrbison had a natural gift as a storyteller. Many of his songs reflect this ability to construct a narrative from pieces like Blue Bayou, Working for the man, Running scared, Leah, Uptown and the now politically incorrect Indian Wedding. There was real potential for Roy Orbison to write musicals. Who knows what his career would have taken him if only he had survived his final heart attack. He was only 52 when he died."
