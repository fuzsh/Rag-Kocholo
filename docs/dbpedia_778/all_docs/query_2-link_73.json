Recently, Ron toured extensively with The Warren Haynes Band, in support of two critically acclaimed releases on the Stax Records label. Holloway is a frequent guest of Gov't Mule, Tedeschi Trucks Band and The Allman Brothers Band. Over the years, he has been a member of an eclectic roster of groups, including; The Warren Haynes Band, the Susan Tedeschi Band, the Dizzy Gillespie Quintet, Gil Scott-Heron and Root Boy Slim.\n\n\"I am really loving the mouthpieces you made for me!\" -Ron Holloway\n\ntheronhollowayband.com\n\nDino Soldo\n\nDino Soldo, a native of Los Angeles, has forged a rare career as THE first call “Utility” musician and songwriter. As musician and performer, Soldo has played and toured with many of Music’s Legends, including Beyonce, Ray Charles, Leonard Cohen, Elton John, Cyndi Lauper, Lionel Richie, Rob Thomas, Tower of Power, and others. But you won’t find him chained to any fixed instrument; he is often surrounded by a forest of different noise makers – woodwinds, keyboards, vocals, guitars, his Electric Wind Instrument. In his own words,\n\n“I find that I am of service to the performer when I am most in service to the song and that means being flexible to different instrumentation”. Most outside CD credits feature his saxophone and chromatic harmonica. Dino has released 10 solo records featuring his multi-instrumentation and vocals. He has two records due for release this year:\n\nA Jazz project named “Tárogató” that features the folk instrument in an acoustic Jazz atmosphere….. And an epic, two hour album, called “Sea Here”,inspired by THE ODYSSEY. It is a virtual “Box Set” long concept album of new, original material.\n\ndinosoldo.net\n\nGreg Vail\n\n“It was a Crescent Tenor Mouthpiece, Gold Plate, that he had been working on for Michael Brecker. Guardala ended up opening it too far for Brecker and they had to go back a step or 2 on a different Crescent Mouthpiece and abandon that one.\n\nI put it on my tenor sax and 25 years later, have never thought of replacing it. It is a great Mouthpiece.“\n\n– Greg Vail\n\nKatja Riekermann\n\nTalented, attractive and sexy, Katja Rieckermann truly is a \"Horn Star.\" Born and raised in Luebeck, a small town in the north of Germany, she moved to Hamburg to study music. Restless and looking for a challenge, she eventually made it to Hollywood, California, the starting point of so many successful careers. One of Katja's first high-profile performances was with the rock band Scorpions in 1997, followed by a guest appearance with the Canadian rock band Saga. In true Hollywood fashion, Katja was eventually cast as a regular on the hit television series \"Ally McBeal\" and in the feature film Star Trek \"Nemesis\". With increased high profile visibility, the entertainment industry quickly took notice of Katja's musical talent.\n\nIn 2001, Katja had the opportunity of a lifetime when she went on the Rod Stewart Human World tour 2001 and 2002. This opportunity gave her the ability to prove herself as a soloist, performing with a superstar on an international stage. Since then, Katja has been on countless tours, concerts, TV performances, award shows and recordings with big stars like Al Green, Carol King, Brooks and Dunn, Rue Paul, Jeff Goldblum, Mary J Blidge, David Foster and Branscombe Richmont, to name a few. Katja has performed in front of musicians, VIP's and music fans from all over the world, including the Queen of England!\n\nIn 2007 Katja released her self-titled debut CD, title \"KATJA.\" She also established her role as the lead saxophonist in Rod Stewart's band. In 2008 another big-time musician with the same last name as Rod, hired Katja to record saxophone on his Songbook, Vol 1:, Dave Stewart from the Eurythmics. This occasion was followed by a couple of live performances with his Rock Fabulous Orchestra. In 2010, Inspired by her work with big stars, Katja completed her 2nd CD. Sandi Strmljan, an extremely talented musician, songwriter and producer, produced this progressive new project. Together, they created a new sound that combines pop, jazz, dance and electro house with a sophisticated horn section. The name of the project \"Horn Star\" is well earned. In Horn Star, Katja shows off her hardcore musical talent; her sensual presence and ability to please an audience shines through in every song. \"Never Stand Still\" is the title of Katja's 3rd studio album. Produced by Grammy nominated producer Jeff Carruthers and Katja Rieckermann. The idea for \"Never Stand Still\" was born in January 2014 during a lunch with producer Jeff Carruthers. The vision was to create an instrumental version of Amy Winehouse's \"Rehab\", basically 70s music inspired by artists like The Temptations, Sam Cooke and Jr. Walker and the AllStars. Within the following 2 months Katja and Jeff ended up writing 11 tunes. \"Ideas just kept coming at me\" says Katja, which she then took to Jeff and he polished them. The next step was an Indiegogo campaign to help raise funds for the making of the CD which was very successful and made it possible for Katja and Jeff to take some of LA's best musicians to the some of the best studios in Los Angeles. Great artists like Joe Bonamassa and Arturo Sandoval gave the honor of a guest appearance. Now, a year later, the CD is finally done and released on HornStar Records.\n\nA highlight of her career was to perform at the 58th Grammy Awards with Lady Gaga, Nile Rogers and Raphael Saadiq doing a Tribute to David Bowie.\n\nkatjarieckermann.com\n\nJohnny Ferreira\n\nInternational touring and recording artist Johnny Ferreira combines style and boundless energy in his performances throughout Europe, United States, and Canada.\n\nHis infatuation with the saxophone began late in high school when he was 17. “It was the sound that attracted me,” he recalls. “It’s the instrument that closest resembles the human voice.” By 19, he was wailing on the sax. “I was impatient to get a good sound and two years seems like a long time when you’re a kid,” he reflects.\n\nJohnny’s professional career started in 1980 being active in his local Vancouver music scene playing the clubs, casual gigs, and joining The Pointed Sticks who were recording and touring nationally at the time. They came from Vancouver’s Punk scene so Johnny was asked by many of the bands to record with them, most notably DOA.\n\nHis music education continued at the University of British Columbia where he pursued a music degree but withdrew a year early as he hooked up with still unknown blues rocker Colin James. “I felt more comfortable on stage than in a classroom”. Ferreira was recruited as an original member of James’ band, featured soloist on stage and in the studio and co-arranging the swingin’ “Little Big Band album”.\n\nA whirlwind 11 years passed quickly, touring with some of history’s most profound rock names, including The Rolling Stones, Robert Plant, ZZ Top, Keith Richards, and Stevie Ray Vaughn. He left Colin’s band in 1998 to pursue his solo career, discovering new fans and excitement fronting his own band, which was in demand constantly. Performing, recording, and teaching continues and his 4th CD “Rock & Roll Saxophonist” being the most “sax-heavy” recording yet.\n\nMany of Ferreira’s songs have weaved themselves into Movies and television. His unmistakable sax sound is featured on many other CDs besides his own, many of which have reached gold and platinum status. He stays rooted to his sax, flirting with many sounds from swing to rock to pop. He continues to write, perform, and educate.\n\nhowtoplaysaxophone.org\n\nPeter Weniger\n\n\"Being part in the act of creation\" – with this credo, Peter Weniger has worked nationally and internationally in numerous musical projects of various genres with renowned artists.

Ideal for using it playing with loud bands like rock, pop, blues, funk & soul music & even for smooth Jazz! Split tones, top tones or subtones… all works really well!! I don’t think you need to spend lots of money on an original Guardala, unless you’re a collector!\n\nAs a professional sax player I must say,that Nadir Ibrahimoglu did a great job making an outstanding copy of the original! The best thing about it, is that Nadir can make it exactly how any player likes it to be & adjust to any special requests! You couldn’t do that with the original, either it was perfect or not!

John Coltrane’s flip-into-the-clouds solo on Miles Davis’ “Milestones” provided the “ah-ha” moment that married Doyle to the saxophone for good.\n\nCurrently calling Michigan his home, the Professor has a passion for the classic fire of groups like Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers and Miles Davis’ first great quintet drove him to create what he calls “a hard bop haven for some of the state’s best players.”\n\nMichael Doyle’s goal of bringing New York- caliber jazz to Michigan remains the same. Doyle’s idiomatic jazz flavor joined with the Who Dat ? Blues Band rhythm section (funky melodic bass from the Coach and Doc’s in the pocket drums) is an excellent compliment to the smooth but occasionally raucous lead licks of Brian “BA” Anderson on guitar.
