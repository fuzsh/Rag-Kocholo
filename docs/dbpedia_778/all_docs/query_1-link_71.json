        "text": "C.J. Snare, a founding member of Firehouse, died at the age of 64, the rock band announced on social media Sunday.\n\nThe lead vocalist, who was expected to return to touring this summer after his recovery from abdominal surgery, “passed unexpectedly” at his home Friday night.\n\nAccording to TMZ, Snare’s daughter Heather told the outlet that her father suffered cardiac arrest after a long journey with cancer.\n\n“Today is a sad day for Rock N Roll,” the statement read. “It is with great sorrow we are letting the world know we have lost our brother: CJ Snare, the rock and roll warrior, lead vocalist, and a founding member of Firehouse.”\n\nLate last month, Snare posted on Instagram, “I’ll be back on stage with FireHouse before you know it. Health is first so making a FULL recovery before my return.”\n\n“We are all in complete shock with CJ’s untimely passing,” the group’s statement said.\n\nThe band added that the lead vocalist “was arguably one of the best vocal talents of a generation, touring the world with Firehouse non stop the past 34 years.”\n\n“Our heartfelt condolences go out to the entire Snare family, Katherine Little, friends, and all our beloved fans all over the world,” the statement added before concluding with an emotional message to Snare.\n\n“‘Reach for the Sky’ CJ!,” they said, referencing their 1992 song “Reach for the Sky.”\n\nFirehouse, formed in 1984, produced hits such as 1990′s “Love of a Lifetime” and 1992′s “When I Look Into Your Eyes.” and 1995′s “I Live My Life For You.”"
