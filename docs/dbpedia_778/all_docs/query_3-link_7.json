        "text": "View Author\n\n5\n\nQueen is absolutely my favorite band of all time. I think their worst album probably still gets 4 stars from me. SHA is by no means their worst, though. Brighton Rock - I loved this song before Baby Driver made it cool. The chord progression through the chorus always gives me the goosebumps, and May's guitar solo here, finally perfected from Queen II, is one of the top five solos HISTORY. Killer Queen - Their biggest \"hit\" from the album. Probably my least favorite track because of its ubiquitousness. How many times have I heard it? 10,000 at least. Still, it slaps. Tenement Funster - Roger Taylor tracks always get short shrift from Queen fans, but I have a soft spot for him. I love the youthful rebelliousness. The transition from this into Flick of the Wrist into Lily of the Valley is the best thing Queen *ever* did. Flick of the Wrist - Shades of their later Death on Two Legs piece. Angry, but still playful. The drums and, again, the guitar solo here really stand out. Lily of the Valley - A bold operatic piece that nearly always brings me to tears. Freddie shows off his vocals for truly the first time on the album. Tingly piano throughout. Now I'm Here - A song that cannot truly be appreciated without listening on headphones. Queen does a bunch of goofy name dropping here that is always funny. In the Lap of the Gods - Another headphone essential. Taylor shows off his insanely high range here. Kind of a Pink Floydy song. Stone Cold Crazy - I have heard this getting more radio play in the last few years, which I find interesting. It's a great, quick rocker that doesn't overstay its welcome. Dear Friends - A sad, mournful little piece that is gorgeous Misfire - A Middle-of-the-road Queen track. Its worst sin is being forgettable. Bring Back That Leroy Brown - A goofy, good-time skiffle song. All the different voices and rhythms make this one a real treat. She Makes Me (Stormtrooper in Stilettos) - The harmonies here are just perfection. The most underrated song on the album. In the Lap of the Gods Revisited - The better Lap song. Really shows off their arena sound a few years early. You can just hear audiences of thousands singing along. Love love love this album.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nThis is the album The Darkness wish they wrote\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\n1/25 Incredible album from four guys who look straight out of JoJo's. Standout Tracks: Brighton Rock, Tenement Funster, Flick Of The Wrist, In The Lap Of The Gods, Stone Cold Crazy\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nProbably a 2.5. Rounded up because it's opened these mouldy cabbage ears to Queen as album-worthy. I'd say I hadn't considered that possibility before because they're victims of an enduringly popular greatest hits collection excpet no band with these sales can be called a victim. Find a better word and let me know. Killer Queen is still my favourite of all their songs, Bring Back That Leroy Brown is a hoot and the \"Don't look back\" but in Flick of the Wrist (about wanking, I hope) gets me pumped every time. Prog - pfft. This is just good ol' gay as fuck rock 'n' roll!\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nI cannot believe I've never listened to this album and have always loved Queen. It's true rock and roll, with enchanting, rolling diddies. I can hear inspiration for other bands decades after them to come. Great job Queen. I love how each song has a different musical theme. That is SO my style. Some of the songs are just SILLY and I love it.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nLovely to see more of Queen than just their greatest hits. This feels like an insight into their more casual work, but it's still a stunning range of music.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nQueen has such a diverse sound, and they don't really sound like anyone else either. A lot of the songs on this album presage what would come on their next album, A Night at the Opera. 4/5\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nIt's crazy that these four guys all jizzed into the Queen's hole and 9 months later produced a royal, sweat-free, pizza hut dwelling definite non-nonce.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n1\n\nBehold a band with no soul. For Queen, showcasing a technical guitar solo or vocal gymnastics matters more than writing entertaining or moving songs. Beware a band having more fun playing than you are listening.

Favorite songs were killer queen, stone cold crazy, now I’m here, flick of the wrist, and in the lap of the gods\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nAhhhh Queen, always a delight. This is a solid collection of tunes that is so much *fun* to listen to, something I think is lacking even from better albums. Did you have a good time, and did it rock? Yes and YES. Stylistically the album is kind of all over the place, but the band makes it work for them. It has all the touches you expect from Queen, the sense of grandeur delivered with masterful musicianship, ethereal vocals and a bit of cheeky humor. The band moves rather effortlessly from full throated rockers like “Brighton Rock” and “Stone Cold Crazy” to delicate ballads like “Lily of the Valley” and “Dear Friends.” The perfect, hooky pop confection that is “Killer Queen” stands above them all. It’s a perfect song and there really isn’t another song like it, by any artist. The quality of the music is undeniable. Brian May's guitar is brilliant, existing on a technical level that few guitarists will ever approach. John Deacon and Roger Taylor are also in top form. The vocal arrangements are stunning, functioning as an instrument in their own right. Freddie Mercury is, of course, a force of nature. His charisma just crackles, elevating even the less interesting songs to a higher level. I also think the songs improve on repeated listening. I like the album better today than I did last night. Fave Songs: Killer Queen, In the Lap of the Gods... Revisited, Now I'm Here, Stone Cold Crazy, Lily of the Valley, Brighton Rock\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nThis album is a whole ass fucking MOOD and I am loving every minute of it!!\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nIt was good revisiting Sheer Heart Attack again. I used to listen to this regularly as a teen on the way to and back from High School. There isn't much enthusiasm for Queen as there was back then but still can't fault a near-perfect album. I must say though that re-listenting to this after a few years has gained me a new love for the deeper cuts like Lily in the Valley and Bring Back That Leroy Brown. It's got two fantastic singles, a great guitar solo in a quirky opening number, a couple of song suites that go well and a perfectly fitting closer. None of the 13 songs overstay their welcome here. Behind A Night At The Opera, this is their best album.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nLmao, i keep forgetting that Queen was pretty much a wizard rock band in the early days.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n2\n\nOne sound. Over and over again in different forms. Freddie harmonizing. Brian May twerdling up and down the fretboard. More harmonizing. A lyric about some imagined tragedy or yearning.

That said, I've listened to multiple Queen compilations up and down and there are a couple of their songs that I really love (none of them included here though). The majority of songs on this album are versatile, very good & interesting and the guitars as well as the singing of course are frequently fantastic. Some of the songs seem a bit overly dramatic. But it's well-executed enough to contribute to Queen's charm. Also, this album doesn't contain any of their really annoying and uninteresting/cheesy hits (which Queen also have a couple of... the horrendous We Are The Champions, Another One Bites The Dust and We Will Rock You come to mind... urgh). Instead, this album is straight-up quality - only In The Lap Of The Gods was sort of, uh, weird.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nA classic, with lovely less well known tracks like Tenement Funster.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nThis Queen album was new to me. The only song I knew was “Killer Queen” (a classic!). I loved it. Really nice early Queen that has a strong rock edge in the guitar solos (“Brighton Rock”) mixed in with some very prog-rock sounds all mixed together with Queen’s pure glam! “Killer Queen” is easy to identify as the big single off the album - it’s arrangements, little sound effect touches, and the way the instruments and the bands voices play together make it a no-brainer hit record. The big surprise was how much great Queen I have yet to discover. I loved the rock sound of “Tenement Funster” - this is a great song that joins with the two songs that follow into an incredible song trilogy. It has a more straight rock sound. Then it blends seamlessly into “Flick of the Wrist” that starts with a great piano interlude and takes things in a darker direction. This feels like more of a prog-rock song that blends seamlessly into “Lily of the Valley” which begins with ‘baby you’ve been had,’ a line from “Flick of the Wrist” that starts the third movement of this trio. This song is piano driven and a beautiful ending to this song trilogy. These three songs need to be listened to as a group to really appreciate, reminding us that there will always be a place for albums even in our digital future as the three songs are so much more when listened to together than they are as separate pieces. “Dear Friends” is a really sweet song of hope (in the best way). “Misfire” and its rhythm is so great! I love this song. Wow Wow Wow. And a love song subtitled “Stormtrooper in Stilettos”? I LOVE QUEEN! This album is spectacular Queen that brings me a lot of much needed joy and hope. Listening to it made me feel like I was listening to Queen for the first time again. So amazing! I will be coming back to this often!!!\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nQueen!

In 'Sheer Heart Attack', Queen enlists both uptempo and downtempo elements in its tracks, demonstrating their dynamic ability through intimate piano ballads like 'Lily Of The Valley' or anthem-worthy guitar arrangements and solos in 'Brighton Rock'. The proficiency and understanding of musical direction is highly apparent, with the album never losing its step lead by Freddie Mercury's energetic vocals.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nClassic Queen!\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n4\n\nprops to this project for showing me how good Queen's non-Greatest Hits catalog is.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nFreddy's tone on Brighton Rock isnt great. Killer queen is incredibly, duh. Stone Cold Crazy is a cool thrash piece. Bring Back Leroy Brown is wacky. some good tracks but it didnt really leave me with much as a whole\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nI listened to my original vinyl copy of this album. I didn’t have Queen’s earlier stuff but recall this album had a new sound - glam rock as it’s called. We now know they still had another gear or two to ramp up the glam. The liner notes give Freddie the credits for “vocal extravaganzas”. How 1974 is that? I don’t recall Killer Queen being in the recent(ish) Boh Rap movie which surprised me since it was a big hit. While I had this LP for 45 years, the vinyl is in great shape which means I didn’t play it much. Aside from Killer Q and Now I’m Here, I don’t really remember the other songs. I thought \"Flick of the Wrist\" was a vg song but it was like today was the first time I heard it. I appreciate the historical and transitional significance of this LP for Queen but the fact I can’t remember 11 of the 13 tracks means I can’t justify a rating north of 3.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nSome absolute bangers on here and a bunch of hidden gems. Production seems a little thin but I guess that could be down to being exposed to much richer mixes in more recent times. Still a lot of fun!\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nBrighton Rock and Killer Queen is a pretty great opening for the album! It's then followed by the incredibly bland Tenement Funster, sadly (while it's great the group operated quite democratically regards songwriting, it did mean some rubbish slipped through!) Flick of the Wrist is another song, and I didn't realise this, which is pretty damning. It's 50/50 so far. Lily of the Valley is camp as balls, and therefore ace. Then Now I'm Here is great fun too. Very Queen, and I think the variable quality is part and parcel. It's an album of brilliant ups and mediocre downs, which makes sense of Queen's reputation as a 'Best of' band.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n3\n\nA really solid Queen album.

Creo que sí es de esos discos que hay que oír, en especial quien le late Queen pero solo conoce los de éxitos. Me encanta el amplio rango que tiene: desde el solo elaborado y lleno de delay de 'Brighton Rock', y el poder rockero de 'Stone Cold Crazy' hasta el sonido jangly de 'Bring Back Leroy Brown'. Obviamente 'Killer Queen' y 'Now I'm Here' son las súper conocidas del disco y me encantan, pero el medley de 'Tenement Funster', 'Flick of the Wrist' y 'Lily of the Valley' son mi parte favorita y puedo oírlas (siempre juntas) una y otra vez.

Despite its troubled development, Sheer Heart Attack comes packed with several early standout hits from Queens career, along with excellent deep cuts. This might be on of their first albums to not be afraid to deviate from their typical rock form of music, which helps this album feel a lot more unique from others of the time. Even with their later albums, I still come back to this one, because even on here the band has already mastered the Queen formula to a tea.

In my opinion, this album feels like an improvement of Queen II bc its narrative is not just complete but more complex than the previous one. It has more feelings involved, and we can hear that.

So many great tracks, including classics like Killer Queen (Queen's breakthrough, with all the elements that make Queen great), Now I'm Here (Queen goes full glam, even mentioning Mott the Hoople in the song), and Stone Cold Crazy (proto-thrash). Songs I was less familiar with but enjoyed: Tenement Funster - in any other band Roger Taylor would be an impressive lead singer, but hard to beat Freddie! Flick of the Wrist - a cross between Queen and Black Sabbath. Lily of the Valley - sounds like it would fit well on A Night at the Opera. Bring Back that Leroy Brown - fun track. Weakest tracks: Misfire and She Makes Me. Misfire has seriously cheesy lyrics - literally a misfire. She Makes Me sounds like it was recorded in a large room with two small mics. Also, when you have singers like Freddie Mercury and Roger Taylor in the band, maybe Brian May shouldn't sing. Not to insult Brian May - he's the very definition of a guitar god. The guitar solo on Brighton Rock proves it right from the start. In fact, Brian May is outstanding across the entire album. Finally (literally), In the Lap of the Gods...Revisited is a great album closer. Easy 5.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nI am embarrassed at how much I profess to be a Queen fan and yet I don't own a single album that isn't greatest hits. Oh well, making up for lost time. So many different styles on this album. They don't all fit seamlessly but like Led Zeppelin III it shows a band who can play whatever the hell you want. Brighton Rock - classic hard rock and damn does Brian May heat up around the 2:40 mark. What. A. Solo. It just keeps going. Killer Queen - quintessential glam rock. Tenement Funster - a mix between the Who and LA Rock (nice acoustic work from John Deacon and wow can Roger Taylor sing), which turns a bit progy when considered alongside Flick of the Wrist and Lily of the Valley. I love how these three fit together and Freddie Mercury's vocals on the latter two are as entrancing as any of his most notable performances. In the Lap of the Gods - not my favorite but it does have a rock opera feel (and it's Taylor hitting the high notes). Stone Cold Crazy - frenetic pace (almost Sabbath-esque). Dear Friends - soft and sweet, piano and vocal harmony only. Bring Back that Leroy Brown - almost ragtime. In the Lap of the Gods Revisited - a soaring rock opus (that's how you close out an album). Other notes - I've always loved Now I'm Here, especially the effect that makes the acoustics sound like its jumping from one side of you to the other (also used at the end of Misfire). So much to like, so little to dislike.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nAs much as I enjoy the first 2 albums of Queen, here is where they really develop their sound. Going from metal (Brighton Rock) to glam (Killer Queen), they can really do it all. Even the songs that don't clunk resonate on this album. Yes, \"Killer Queen\" is overplayed on the radio, but it's still a damn good song. As great as Mercury's voice is, I think it's May's guitar work that really shines here. \"Brighton Rock\" and \"Stone Cold Crazy\" are real statements as to what he can do. Definitely one of my favorite Queen albums.\n\n👍\n\nView Author\n\n5\n\nAwesome! Short, but catchy and a few classic songs. Glad I was able to give it a few listens through; it meant even the \"lesser\" songs were able to shine\n\n👍"
