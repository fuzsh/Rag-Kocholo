        "text": "3 + 3 / Turning Toward – Sometimes You Just Have to Run With It. Sauntering With Mr. Brown. Exploring Outward/Funambulist Fever / Tomeka Reid Qrt: Reid, vc; Mary Halvorson, el-gt; Jason Roebke, bs; Tomas Fujiwara, dm / Cuneiform Records, Rune 525, available for sampling or purchase on Bandcamp\n\nTomeka Reid (b. 1977) is an avant-garde cellist, composer and improviser who has performed with, among others, the world-renowned Art Ensemble of Chicago, which from its inception in 1969 has always tried to stretch the boundaries of the jazz form by incorporating free-form improvisation with elements of classical music. In addition to leading her own quartet, Reid has also recorded with flautist Nicole Mitchell’s 2002 Black Earth Ensemble album, Africa Rising. This is my first exposure to her although this is her second album for Cuneiform Records (the first was Old New in 2019), thus I am new to her and, I would assume, most of my readers are, too.\n\nAccording to the promotional sheet accompanying this album:\n\nReid wrote the 3+3 music with the support of a Chamber Music America New Jazz Works Commission and she ended up writing the pieces while an artist in residence for the Moers Jazz Festival in 2022. The quartet premiered it during her residency at the Stone in August 2023, an apt setting to navigate the ebb and flow of a freely improvised and tunes-based program. The music gathers momentum over the course of several movements, not so much tracing a narrative arc as circling through a series of loose and limber themes and tempo shifts.\n\n“I see the whole album as a suite,” says Reid, who moved back to Chicago in 2020 after about four years in New York. “Previously I’d written shorter pieces and felt like I had to write ‘jazz pieces’, and for this album I wanted to write longer forms. I do a lot of free improvisation and wanted to reflect that more on my records. There are tunes on this too, but it’s more open.”\n\nI immediately sensed an AEC “vibe” to her music on this disc. I liked many, but not all, of the things AEC did, and was lucky enough to see them in person once—at, of all venues, the Chicago Art Museum circa 1980 or ’81. At the tine, I hadn’t even heard of them, thus I was startled by both their appearance (all but one of them, trumpeter Lester Bowie, in African garb and face makeup…Bowie wore a doctor’s white jacket and stethoscope) and the strangeness of their music. I listened to them for about five minutes before moving on, not knowing that most of their pieces lasted anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes long. Each of these three works on the present CD is also an extended composition/improvisation. Turning Forward – Sometimes You Just Have to Run With It lasts 16:23, Sauntering With Mr. Brown a mere 8:37, and Funambulist Fever 15:15. Even so, the total playing time of 40 minutes plus may seem a bit short for a CD, but what it lacks in length it makes up for in density.\n\nReid’s music is not easy for the average listener to follow. Her recordings will seldom if ever be played on those jazz streaming services online or, if you are lucky to have one (most have disappeared into the ether), your local jazz radio station. It is not “fun” music in any way. It is art music, which of course makes it perfect for this blog although, as usual, my classical followers will not even read this review because any kind of jazz is just so beneath them. It’s their loss.\n\nThe first piece opens with Halvorson picking gently at her guitar while Reid produces some strange, strangulated cello sounds in the background while bass and drums stay sotto voce underneath them. As with much if AEC’s music, there are no themes that the listener can hang on to; having recently finished reviewing Pelle Gudmundsen-Holmgreen’s surreal string quartets, I found a strong kinship between his music and Reid’s with the exception that the former often wrote tongue-in-cheek while the latter is deadly serious. One thing that pleased me a great deal was that, although she plays electric guitar, Halvorson is also a very serious jazz artist, thus although she uses some reverb effects in her playing she does not indulge in typical “rock guitar” screaming licks.\n\nWith the music being as fluid as it is, one listens for as many musically solid signposts as one can. At the 4:31 mark Reid, now playing bowed cello, and Halvorson play a repeated descending motif of A-flat/E/D/B before leading into a brief melodic line, eventually followed by a rising motif of G-A-B. Then, suddenly, we get an actual theme played by Reid with a really swinging beat which incorporates this rising motif into it, sometimes as a break, sometimes as a secondary theme, before taking off into improvisation. It’s an ingenious yet subtle musical maneuver which speaks volumes for the leader-composer’s whimsical imagination. At least the rhythm section keeps a steady 4 beat, something that the AEC only did on occasion. Halvorson’s solo is excellent and very creative, using the whole-tone scale as well as some modal changes mixed in with the changes of the tune thus established. Reid then plays repeated riffs behind her before bassist Jason Roebke takes a solo. Although he does not have a powerful tone—either that, or he purposely keeps his volume a bit low-key so as not to disturb the balance of the quartet—his solo is also quite imaginative, using some fracturing of the rhythm to play against drummer Fujiwara’s steady pulse. Then, it is Roebke who drops into playing three-note riffs while the drummer solos. Once again, I was very pleased to hear Fujiwara because for most of the track he keeps a steady pulse, with some small modifications, rather than trying to show off how many fractured rhythms he can pound out as if he were a free-jazz Buddy Rich. Towards the end of the track, we hear Reid playing what sounds like electronically modified lines pitched up an octave higher than her instrument can naturally go while Halvorson plays riffs; then the tempo slows way down and we are back to the slow beginning melody for the coda.\n\nSauntering With Mr. Brown opens in a similar fashion, with soft pizzicato cello, this time with just the drums sneaking in behind it. At the one-minute mark, the bass adds a few notes here and there, then Halvorson enters playing an interesting counter-melody. Although bitonal. the theme’s rhythm is rather catchy, a nice medium-tempo swing. Halvorson moves into soloing as Reid continues along with her little rhythmic motifs through the first half of the piece. As free jazz goes, this is a rather pleasant piece with good form. At about 4:12, Reid switches to bowed cello; it sounds as if the sound is somewhat distorted, either by her finger placement on the strings or electronically. She also throws in a few quarter tones, slightly under the established pitch, which gives a suddenly ominous feeling to this “saunter” as the bass and drums slowly increase their volume (but never overpower the gentle sound of cello and guitar). As it develops, the piece sounds rather gentle until the seven-minute mark when Reid starts playing louder, edgier string tremolos. It also sounded to me as if she overdubbed herself, with a melodic cello line clearly heard over the continuing edgy figures. At the very end, a short coda, then one sustained cello note and out.\n\nFunambulist Fever opens with distorted cello playing. The title, for those who are wondering, refers to an acrobat who walks on either a tightrope or slack rope; this piece seems to evoke a bit of both. The music stays very fragmented for quite some period of time, with Halvorson also bending notes on her guitar, and the drums play quixotic fractured beats which break things up even further as the bassist plays in-time and double-time fills as he sees fit. This is clearly the most fragmented and free-form piece on the album, very much in the style of the AEC despite a lull at around the five-minute mark in which we hear some gentle chords strummed on the guitar against electronically-distorted but very soft cello figures. Then, at 6:19, Reid begins playing a very slow and quite lovely melody on bowed cello as the others continue their work around her. Eventually, the cello line becomes faster, more distorted and rather abstract, followed by an excellent drum solo by Fujiwara. Then, at 11:20 or so, the bass settles into a rhythmic groove and the whole thing begins to swing, albeit in a free-jazz way. Fujiwara shows off some nifty stick work, but eventually our funambulist seems to have hit a snag on the tightrope as there is an odd divergent change in the music before she finds her footing again. We end with the cello and guitar really swinging their way to the other side of the rope, underlined by more stick and bass drum work.\n\nIt’s really a shame that most jazz aficionados will either ignore this album or fail to understand what is going on here, and even more of a shame that modern classical composers will turn their nose up at it as something beneath them. This is highly creative and original music that takes chances and, more often than not, finds its way out of its own musical mazes. You might call it a truly a-MAZE-ing album!\n\n—© 2024 Lynn René Bayley\n\nFollow me on Facebook (as Monique Musique)\n\nCheck out the books on my blog…they’re worth reading, trust me!\n\nREMEMBRANCE / The Otter Creek Incident.

There’s a lot of great Chick Corea out there, and this is different.”\n\nIt sure is. By cracky, we ain’t had a good piano and banjo jazz record since the 1920s, I think. If Rudi Mahall thinks everyone hates the clarinet, that must go double for the banjo. “I consider it my mission to eradicate the banjo from jazz bands,” Eddie Lang told an interviewer in the late 1920s, and he did before his untimely death in every major orchestra except Duke Ellington’s, which kept the banjo into the early ‘30s.\n\nBut of course, Béla Fleck is different. He is, to the best of my knowledge, the only modern jazz banjoist, and if he isn’t the only one he is certainly the best. Thus we have some very interesting duets on this CD, although to my mind they’re not as complex as the free jazz duets that Corea played back in the 1990s with the late Friedrich Gulda.\n\nCorea occupied a unique niche in the jazz world. Strictly as a pianist, he was excellent but not wholly original in style, but his talents went far beyond mere improvisation. Many collectors, myself included, still treasure his CDs with the acoustic version of his 1970s band Return to Forever, and then there was his jazz suite with vibist Gary Burton, his compositions for strings, and many other projects that set him apart from almost anyone else.\n\nSince I didn’t have the booklet for this CD, I can’t tell you how much of this album was recorded in the studio and how much was recorded “live,” but there is applause on only a few tracks. What is consistent, however, is the sound quality, with both performers closely miked and perfectly balanced. Of the five Impromptus I again know very little beyond the titles, four of which take their names from Lewis Carroll’s surrealist stories of the late 19th century. Much to my surprise, the two Scarlatti sonatas are played straight without any improvisation, but they surely were Corea’s idea. He was a huge fan of Baroque music and that of Mozart.\n\nPartly due to his reverence for classical music, Corea’s playing always had direction and form. Here, even when Fleck pushes the envelope, Corea sticks pretty closely to his trademark style. When Fleck is going out on a limb, Corea is accompanying him with a combination of ground bass and complementary chording, occasionally holding back completely during Fleck’s extended breaks. One of the more amazing things is how creative Corea could be when playing together with Fleck. In some moments he simply acts as an accompanist, but then he’ll change positions on a dime and play counter-melodies and, occasionally, counter-rhythms. And, as usual, it’s all very subtle. Corea’s diverse musical mind worked quickly, able to absorb as well as echo what his musical partner was playing at all times. It was what made him unique.\n\nThe duo plays the five Impromptus out of sequence, thus the first one up is No. III, “March Hare.” This has a distinctly classical bent to it, but halfway through the duo completely changes the harmony around, and it ends with a slower, out-of-tempo cadenza.\n\nI couldn’t figure out what the title of Enut Nital was supposed to mean until I read it backwards. Latin Tune. It combines traditional Spanish rhythms (sounding a bit like flamenco) with a busy, almost Baroque top line. Fleck is particularly wild in the second half of this one; Corea lets him go his own way, tossing in his commentary as the music develops. No. II of the Impromptus, “Mock Turtle,” also has a Latin undercurrent, but Corea’s accompaniment is played at half the tempo of Fleck’s improvised top line, giving the music a sort of split personality. The duo really has fun rewriting and improvising on Thelonious Monk’s Bemsha Swing, with Corea in particular fracturing the beat to the point where, at times, he is running counter to Fleck while at others he is pushing him strongly with tremendous swing, at times sounding like a cross between Fats Waller and Dodo Marmarosa. But this is clearly a purely jazzy reading, with no real allusion to classical or Latin music except in some of his rhythmic phrasing of a few passages. This is one of the “live” tracks, which gets a wonderful round of applause.\n\nFleck’s composition Lucky Bounce opens with staccato figures played on the banjo, with Corea coming in to accompany him and set the tempo. But this one is truly a contrapuntal exercise with only a little jazz “swing” to it; many of Corea’s single-note right-hand figures are reminiscent of the kind of work he did with Return to Forever. There is a neat passage in the middle where Corea suddenly steps up the tempo into double time, followed by a relaxation of the beat and putting the stress on different beats within different bars. This is really subtle music, and here, except for the fact that much of it is improvised and nearly all of it is syncopated, it’s hard to label it “jazz,” yet in the last two choruses the tempo picks up slightly and the playing of both musicians becomes rather daring. It ends on an unresolved chord.\n\nThis is followed by Impromptu No. 1, “Cheshire,” a strange bitonal piece played in strict rhythm with an almost Baroque interplay between the two instruments—third stream music at its very best and quintessential Chick Corea. By contrast, the title tune opens with a relaxed, out-of-tempo piano introduction with several right-hand flourishes before settling into another Latin rhythm and a richly textured melodic line of the sort that only Chick Corea could write. Not too surprisingly, Fleck take a back seat on this one, acting mostly as accompanist to Corea rather than active partner. Recognizing that this was a “Chick Corea tune,” he let him fly solo while providing some exquisite if very subtle counter-lines, at least until his own solo, but here he wisely keeps it simple, realizing that Corea is the one creating the more substantive musical statement. And it’s amazing how much Chick stretches this piece out, running it nearly six and a half minutes and introducing B and C themes as he wends his way along. To my mind, this is a modern counterpart to Jelly Roll Morton’s Spanish-tinged tunes, and this one, too, is “live.”\n\nJuno is a cute, playful piece (also played before an audience), not exactly bitonal but with a theme that jumps back and forth between two keys. Again, there is a Baroque feel to it, and Corea slips in some allusions to Latin rhythm as well. There is also tremendous wit in his solo. Fleck, again, joyfully accompanies him until his own solo, which consists of a string of 16th notes and some rapid triplets. This is followed by the two Scarlatti sonatas, to which Corea adds his own slightly syncopated lines here and there. The second sonata is much more a jazz than a classical performance, but still within the bounds of good taste. Fleck falls in line with the fun, and a good time is had by all, including the audience.\n\n“Jabberwocky,” the fifth Impromptu, is the craziest of all, going in and out of different keys even in its opening theme statement. Corea borrows some “rootless” chords from Bill Evans for this one, which keeps the harmony from ever really being settled as the duo romp their way through it. Yet surprisingly, Fleck’s Small Potatoes has the same sort of unsettled harmony along with fluctuating tempi and accents within the bars. Here, it is the banjoist who seems to be pushing the pianist into some truly avant-garde passages, including left-hand crushed chords and other devices before we suddenly reach a bit of Baroque counterpoint in the middle, This is truly one of the album’s greatest peaks; the live audience loved it.\n\nContinuance opens with a series of strange and at times seemingly unrelated piano chords, followed by a sort of fluctuating-tempo theme with unsettled harmony. Fleck joins the fun, and the pair go right on their merry “jazzical” way through the piece. The album closes out with the fourth Impromptu, “Gentleman Fish,” which sounds much more like a Fleck piece than a Corea one, having a certain bluegrass quality about it. It’s short, to the point, and minimally improvised—a sort of musical exclamation point to the entire album.\n\nEven if this were not a post-mortem Corea disc, which of course being such will attract thousands if not millions of listeners, it is certainly a very fine one, a triumphant exclamation point on his storied career, and his wonderful synergy with Fleck works perfectly.\n\n—© 2024 Lynn René Bayley\n\nFollow me on Facebook (as Monique Musique)\n\nCheck out the books on my blog…they’re worth reading, trust me!\n\nTHE STRAIGHT HORN OF RUDI MAHALL / Bebop (Dizzy Gillespie). Good Bait (Tadd Dameron). Sechseinhalb Brüder (Mahall-Giuffre-Mulligan). The Mystery Song (Duke Ellington). Petite Fleur (Sidney Bechet). Unbewusst im Puff (Konitz-Dameron). Pee Wee’s Blues (Russell). 17 West (Eric Dolphy). In-stable Mates (Benny Golson) / Rudi Mahall, cl; Simon Sieger, pno/tb; Joel Grip, bs; Michael Greiner, dm / Two Nineteen Records 2-19-12, available for purchase at Bandcamp\n\n“Everyone hates the clarinet. It was then, and still is today, a pretty much out-of-favor instrument in jazz music. You can’t get anywhere with the clarinet.”\n\nThat quote from Rudi Mahall, who started out on a regular clarinet before switching primarily (but not exclusively) to the much more in-favor bass clarinet several years ago, opens the liner notes for this album. But we should ask ourselves, “Why?”\n\nBecause, as the late clarinetist Frank Powers once told me, it’s a very difficult instrument to play well…not as difficult as the soprano saxophone, which replaced it in jazz, but still pretty hard, especially when you’re playing it very fast all the time. It began to fall out of favor during the bebop era, despite the presence of virtuoso Buddy de Franco and Benny Goodman’s and Artie Shaw’s flirtations with bop, mostly because no modern black jazz musician would play it. The last “new” clarinetist of note to arrive on the scene was another white player, Tony Scott, who played the instrument with a breathy, reedy tone like his predecessor Pee Wee Russell, although bop alto saxist Art Pepper also played excellent clarinet on occasion. But I think the main reason why the regular clarinet died out was because it was a sweet-sounding instrument and sweet sounds were “out” in modern jazz. And even when Pee Wee Russell himself recorded an album of mostly modern tunes by Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane (Ask Me Now!), he was largely ignored by the jazz community at large.\n\nThis album mixes a serious intent to re-establish the clarinet as a modern jazz instrument with some very tongue-in-cheek humor—for instance, the title of Sechseinhalb Brüder translates into English as “Six and a Half Brothers,” a take-off on both Jimmy Giuffre’s iconic Four Brothers and Gerry Mulligan’s lesser-known sequel, Five Brothers. But even the arrangements themselves are full of wildly funny ideas, such as the manic arrangement of Dizzy Gillespie’s Bebop in which single-note piano doubles the clarinet’s line while bassist Joel Grip moans and grumbles down below and drummer Michael Greiner splashes cymbal licks all over the place, and when they get into the improvisation they suddenly all jump off the cliff into a cacophonous free-fall. Gillespie is thus dragged, probably kicking and screaming in the afterlife, into the post-modern free jazz scene.\n\nIn Tadd Dameron’s famous Good Bait, it’s the rhythm that gets skewered, broken up into irregularly-metered fragments. The band sounds like a bunch of newbies trying to put these broken pieces back together again, and it’s all great fun. (Mahall and trombonist Simon Sieger, who is otherwise out pianist, stress the humor by playing a fraction of a beat off from each other.) Once they reach the improvisation, however, the beat maintains a steady 4 and Mahall plays an excellent solo, as does Sieger on the trombone, proving that he does know how to play the instrument. In the final chorus, Mahall and Sieger are back to their musical mischief, first playing the theme very quickly and then slowing it down and converting it to a 6/4 rhythm—then back again to playing out of synch with one another.\n\nThe liner notes explain Six and a Half Brothers better than I could:\n\nOur version begins with prepared drums and bowed double bass playing their part of the Rudi Mahall composition Vier Halbe (Intakt Records, 2012), which he wrote on the chords of Four Brothers. A joint clarinet and piano solo leads directly into Gerry Mulligan’s 1949 composition Five Brothers, played by all in unison. 4 Brothers + 5 Brothers divided by 4/2 equals Six and a Half Brothers = Sechseinhalb Brüder.\n\nUmmm, OK if you say so. I’ll take your word for it. Nonetheless, with the bass and prepared drums ostensibly struggling to find the beat, and a lick that sounds as if it’s being played by a toy piano, the overall effect of this track is something akin to Spike Jones lampooning bebop. Eventually, as in the preceding track, the piano somehow lags slightly behind the beat. When they reach Five Brothers about 3/4 of the way in, the tempo slows down to a lugubrious tempo as both piano and prepared drums drop about two octaves, dragging the music across the finish line.\n\nThe liner notes tell us that this version of Duke Ellington’s 1931 Mystery Song is based more on Steve Lacy’s 1961 recording than the original Ellington version. Nonetheless, it’s still a wonderful rendition of this ahead-of-its-time piece and, for the first time in this recital the band seems to be taking the music seriously, with good results. Mahall’s solo on this one is really exceptional, highly inventive tet respectful of the advanced chord changes, as is Sieger’s trombone solo. Here he tries to pay tribute to Ellington’s legendary trombonist Joe “Tricky Sam” Nanton by using a plunger mute, but like all plunger-muted trombonists since Nanton, Sieger plays “wah-wah” instead of “yah-yah.”\n\nNext up is a famous piece by a famous clarinetist, and the first soprano sax virtuoso in jazz, Sidney Bechet. This is played (more or less) in a straightforward way, at least until the break where Mahall suddenly derails himself in terms of pitch and rhythm and the rest of the band gleefully jump into this mess to join him instead of trying to rescue him. Mahall eventually gets lost in a flurry of flutter-tongued notes, ending with a raspberry played through the horn, before eventually finding the melody for the ride-out.\n\nUnbewusst im Puff combines two contrafacts based on What is This Thing Called Love?, Tadd Dameron’s Hot House and Lee Konitz’ Subconscious-Lee. Again there is a certain amount of purposely disjointed playing from the musicians in the group, although Sieger’s single-note piano lines struck me as more serious and sober than Mahall’s playing in the first half, but later on it is Mahall who “plays it straight” while Sieger somehow falls behind by a hair while the bass and drums just say “to hell with it” and go on their merry way, ignoring both of them (yet eventually falling into tempo behind them).\n\nConsidering that this is, at heart, an avant-garde jazz group, it’s sometimes hard to tell the tongue-in-cheek musical jokes from the serious moments, however. This was especially true of Pee Wee’s Blues, a piece that the clarinetist composed in the early 1950s. Despite a few purposely corny squawks from Mahall, however, this is pretty much a “straight” reading of Russell’s very strange piece. Sieger again provides an excellent trombone solo. In fact, considering that he plays more trombone on this album than piano, I thought of him more as a trombonist who also plays the piano than a pianist who also plays the trombone. At any rate, on this disc, he comes across more as a pianist who very ably fills in behind Mahall but a trombonist who is every bit his equal as a soloist. (We have one such musician here in Cincinnati, Kim Pensyl, who plays both piano and trumpet. At a local concert about a dozen years ago I said to my friend Carol, “I’d like to see him play both at the same time.” And wouldn’t you know? On one number he DID! Left had playing the piano while his right hand played the trumpet!)\n\nPee Wee Russell gives way to Eric Dolphy, in this case 17 West. Despite the rhythm section playing some totally different rhythms from Mahall and Sieger (on piano), this is a relatively straightforward performance and a good one. Here, Sieger’s piano solo has some very strong Monk overtones, which is odd because, although Dolphy liked Monk, the feeling was not mutual. This one really goes out on a musical limb, but from start to finish they are deadly serious about the music for once. Mahall’s solo, though respectful of Dolphy’s style, does not copy him.\n\nThe final selection is described by Greiner in the liner notes as taking Benny Golson’s Stablemates with its odd structure—a 14-bar A section with an 8-bar bridge—and here it sounded to me as if the group combined seriousness with nutty humor.\n\nBut this is a wonderful and often wacky CD that will provide you with hours of enjoyment upon repeated listening. There’s so much to follow here, and sometimes there is seriousness underneath the humor and vice-versa.\n\n—© 2024 Lynn René Bayley\n\nFollow me on Facebook (as Monique Musique)\n\nCheck out the books on my blog…they’re worth reading, trust me!\n\nGUDMUNDSEN-HOLMGREEN: String Quartets Nos. 7-10 / Nordic String Qrt / Dacapo 8.226218\n\nMy regular readers know, at this point, how much I admire the music of the late Pelle Gudmundsen-Holmgreen. His music is very hard to describe because it’s liner, yet it isn’t; it’s abstract, but not entirely. It always seems to follow its own unchartered course, and unfortunately it’s not easy for the average listener to grasp, thus it mostly just exists on records. I’ve not run across many live performances of his work on YouTube.\n\nThese four quartets were written over the incredible span of 27 years, from 1984 to 2011. Three of them were written for the Kronos Quartet, a group that, I am sad to report, turned its nose up at my suggestion that they perform and record Charles Mingus’ utterly brilliant string quartet. Well, at least Kronos has played Gudmundsen-Holmgreen’s music, which is a feather in their cap. Quartets Nos. 7 and 8 are first recordings, and Quartet No. 9, written for “string quartet and ocean,” includes electronically created ocean sounds courtesy of Wayne Siegel at DIEM, Aarhus. It should also be noted that each of these four quartets has a subtitle: No. 7, “Parted”; No. 8, “Ground”; No. 9 (written 20 years later), “Last Ground”; and No. 10, “New Ground.” Only the seventh quartet is divided into four separate movements; the last three are one-movement works. For some strange reason, the download I received did not include the third movement of Quartet No. 7, so I had to go online and record the streaming audio. (Oh, the lengths I go to sometimes to review a CD!)\n\nFrom the very beginning of Quartet No. 7, one is aware of the oddity of Gudmundsen-Holmgreen’s compositional style. The strings play in a distorted manner, somehow or other squelching their string to produce an ugly rather than a beautiful sound, almost like rustic folk fiddlers with little training. The 6/8 theme hovers between bitonality and atonality, with the players sometimes simply hitting their instruments with their bows and, when they do play together, constantly breaking up the line with almost violent percussive effects. It’s music that takes you several different places at once in addition to sounding abrasive—yet somehow it’s utterly fascinating and holds your attention, sort of like a surrealist train wreck in which three or four trains have collided simultaneously, strewing their debris in different directions. Other than have a score to dissect, there’s really no other way to describe this music.”Off the wall” almost seems too mild for it. Somehow or other, he also managed to get the strings to play in a percussive manner (and I don’t mean by hitting their instruments) that almost sounds like snare drum press rolls. You can hear this at one point in the first movement as well as in the opening of the third. The listener will also note that although there are four separate movements, they are linked. There are also moments, as in the midst of the third movement, when the music simply stops and one thinks it is over, only to have it start up violently once again. I would say that there is nothing else like it in the entire history of string quartet writing, but then there are the other Gudmundsen-Holmgreen quartets!\n\nAnd the odd thing is that, if you read the liner notes hoping to get some idea of what you’ll be listening to, you’ll probably get even more confused. In describing the ultra-abstract Quartet No. 8, for instance, which sounds like the players snapping their strings like elastic bands while one of the upper strings (possibly the second violin or viola) plays one repeated note (A-flat) in a sequence that leans towards D-flat minor, and somehow Gudmundsen-Holmgreen kept this up over an extraordinarily long span of time without much varying of the music. But what does annotator Andrew Mellor say?\n\nThe baroque practice of looping a bass line (or ‘ground bass’) proved useful for Gudmundsen-Holmgreen, its enforced limitations acting as a stimulant. The composer would toy with the device throughout his later decades and for this eighth string quartet, extended its rubric by using rows of harmonic sequences in symmetrical upward and downward movements. The composer’s own explanatory note explains that his ground consists of ‘a continuously repeated 35 bar rhythmic foundation (constructed of polyrhythms), an equilibrium in a limited number of tones, a continuously repeated harmonic sequence (modulating between four different symmetrically arranged levels) and the overall form of a bow, consisting of many small bows.’\n\nHere is yet another example of why “Academic-ese” really doesn’t do the average listener a bit of good in trying to describe what a composition actually SOUNDS like. I think, if you listen to it, that my description is much closer to what the ear receives than this academic gobbledygook. Later on in the quartet, Gudmundsen-Holmgreen also brought strongly percussive string playing into this quartet, establishing a steady pulse that does not really exist in the earlier part of the work. It’s yet another example of how his music did not follow any sort of traditional path. Even the avant-garde scores of Harry Partch were easier to follow than this; and by comparison with this quartet, the constant rhythmic changes in Stravinsky’s Le sacre du printemps sound like disco music. It’s much closer to the reality of what you hear to say that the latter part of this quartet sounds like alien insects from another planet rubbing their legs together as they slowly crawl out of the range of your hearing.\n\nAs for No. 9 for Quartet and ocean, I can tell you that you certainly get plenty of ocean, and as someone who spent many happy days in my youth at the New Jersey shore (which, I am told, scarcely exists anymore due to the damage of hurricanes), I can attest that this is what an ocean sounds like. Including the sounds of sea birds. Watch out that you don’t step on a broken sea shell with your bare feet, now! That REALLY smarts! Ironically, the music in this quartet, while certainly modern and somewhat abstract, sounds closer to what we would consider “real” string quartet music than the prior pieces. Yes, the music is still fractured, but not so much that you can’t follow it at least a bit, and I liked the fact that the sounds of sea gulls came back even when the ocean tide itself remained quiet. By and large, this quartet leans closer to tonality as well, or at least modality, staying in one chord for a protracted period of time; and the music develops in a slightly more conventional manner. The whole thing is more organic and not as fragments as Quartets Nos. 7 & 8.\n\nAnd then, just to throw you a curve ball, Gudmundsen-Holmgreen’s last quartet sounds like the Pachelbel Canon! Go figure. If nothing else, it surely proves that he knew how to write conventional music. Of course, when he develops it he takes it in his own directions, including some crazy syncopation, quite a bit of which sounds like jazz and some of which plays against the rhythm as if the music were running sideways (or backwards, take your pick). This was surely a way for the composer to leave us with a smile on our faces after so many stark, abstract, and deadly serious works.\n\nBut Gudmundsen-Holmgreen can’t stay away from his basic nature for very long, thus the latter third of this quartet goes into some eerie microtonality, then returns to tonality but adds his characteristically edgy writing with its almost violent attacks on the strings. Thus Pachelbel’s Canon turns into a sort of violent-sounding hoedown at a pretty brisk pace. Then, slowly, Pachelbel tries to reassert himself, fighting the edgy hoedown music, generally winning the battle but sometimes losing. Welcome to Gudmundsen-Holmgreen’s little musical universe!\n\nThis is quite the strange album, to be sure.

Deep in My Soul. Guess Whose Blues. Just the Other Day. Napoli (Michael Pagán). Eiderdown (Steve Swallow). Where Do We Go from Here? (Kenny Wheeler). Gaviota (Clare Fischer)* / Michael Herrera, David Chael, a-sax/s-sax/t-sax; Michael Pagán, pno/*el-pno; Louie Pagán, bs/el-bs; Ray DeMarchi, dm / Capri Records 2646668X\n\nMichael Pagán is described in the publicity sheet for this disc as a fixture on the Kansas City jazz scene, but since I don’t live in Kansas City and have never been there I hadn’t heard of him before. Nonetheless, this is a refreshing album to have nowadays, when everything else seems to be some sort of avant-garde, soft slow “jazz lite” or neo-Swing. This is a true neo-Bop album, the music harking back to a time when Bird was in his last year and Dizzy was again on the ascendant.\n\nExcept that there are no trumpets in this group, just two saxes with rhythm section.\n\nNor is this comparison just an idea of mine. The very first track, Burn It Forward, sounds for all the world like a Charlie Parker composition, and one with a memorable melodic line. (How many modern-day jazz tunes can you think of that have a MEMORABLE melody?) Interestingly, the two saxists take turns on their various instruments, for instance on track 1 where Herrera is first up on alto (sounding quite Bird-like) while Chael is on tenor (sounding, to my ears, a bit like Getz and a bit like Herb Geller…anyone out there besides me remember Geller?). As for the leader, his sparkling piano improvisations reminded me of Al Haig, which is no small achievement. Haig, not Bud Powell, was Bird’s favorite pianist. Michael Pagán’s son Louie is the bassist, and while his improvisations are good I can’t say that I liked his tone on electric bass. It’s a bit too muddy and generic-sounding; it doesn’t have the clean articulation or drive of someone like Jaco Pastorius. (Yes, I know that Pastorius was the undisputed king of jazz electric bass and no one really sounds exactly like him, but cleaner articulation would have been welcome.)\n\nBut I’m saving the best, in a way, for last. Ray DeMarchi is a HELL of a drummer. He knows how to drive the band without overwhelming it with unwanted flash. He doesn’t try to break up the beat constantly into fractions of fractions, he doesn’t try to bury his bandmates in a torrent of flashy riffs and rim shots. He just plays great drums and that’s that.\n\nDeep In My Soul is a Latin-tinged ballad; the melody is somewhat memorable, but I’ll take somewhat once in a while. Both saxists play well, but somehow the laid-back tempo seems to have diffused the brilliance one heard on Burn It Forward. Louie Pagán’s electric bass solo on this one is a little more clearly defined, probably because he doesn’t have to play so fast, but it is his father’s piano solo that really dominates this piece. It is a gem and has a good drive to it. The repeated coda goes on too long. (Sorry, but I don’t much like ballads, particularly when the melodic line is really just a couple of riffs sewn together.)\n\nGuess Whose Blues is an unusual, medium-tempo composition in 6/8 with a real constructed melody in B-flat minor that keeps ending on the G below the tonic. I loved this piece, liked the arrangement, and couldn’t get enough of it. It put me in mind of some other jazz composer but, for the life of me, I can’t recall who (that happens sometimes when you have an encyclopedia of jazz musicians and styles inside the filing cabinet of your head). And everybody sounds good on this track; each chorus of every solo, including the tasteful drum breaks, fits together like fingers in a glove. This is one of those ultra-rare perfect jazz performances where composition, arrangement and solos all unite to produce a seamless, almost inevitable musical progression from first note to last.\n\nThis is followed by three consecutive pieces written by others: Steve Swallow’s Eiderdown, Kenny Wheeler’s Where Do We Go From Here? and Clare Fischer’s Gaviota. The first of these is also set to an excellent arrangement and is very close in its perfection of solos (especially the leader’s on piano, which really grabbed me) to Guess Whose Blues. The second is a ballad on which the real standout is Chael’s tenor solo, and the third is one of those slow-funky pieces with a Latin feel that Fischer wrote so many of late in his career.\n\nI think what impressed me most about this group as a whole was how much these recordings sounded like live performances. What I mean by that is not just that they have a nice frisson, some excitement about them, and don’t sound canned. I hear way too many jazz CDs by bands, sometimes big bands, which seem to be playing really hot arrangements but their playing sounds forced, as if they were still a little asleep but were trying to sound energetic in the studio. (Perhaps this is something that’s hard to put into words, but you’d know what I meant if I played examples for you.)\n\nJust the Other Day is another tune with a good, solid melody line, set to a medium uptempo that’s just perky enough to remind one of some more late-1950s jazz. Herrera plays an outstanding soprano sax solo on this one, followed by a very good one from Chael on tenor and the leader on piano.\n\nNapoli, the closer, returns us to a boppish feel, but this time with an Italian rather than a Latin feel…it almost sounds like the old Louis Prima and the Witnesses band playing a bop line (with a middle section played in 6/4, if you can believe it). Chael plays an absolutely phenomenal tenor solo on this one, his best on the record, and the leader really cooks on piano.\n\nDespite a couple of mediocre tracks, this is mostly a very good album, well worth checking out.\n\n—© 2024 Lynn René Bayley\n\nFollow me on Facebook (as Monique Musique)\n\nCheck out the books on my blog…they’re worth reading, trust me!\n\nSCHOENBERG: Pierrot Lunaire.1 DALLAPICCOLA: Concerto per la notte di Natale 1956.2 Parole di San Paolo3 / 1Maureen McNalley, mez; Sue Ann Kahn, pic/fl; Anand Devandra, cl/bs-cl; Eric Rosenblith, vln/vla; Chris Finckel, cel; Dwight Peltzer, pno. 2Valerie Lamoree, mezzo; 3Benita Valente, sop; Orchestra of Our Time; Joel Thome, cond / Vox NX-2467. Bonus track: CRUMB: Night Music I / Jan de Gaetani, mez; Orchestra of Our Time, Thome / available for free streaming on YouTube\n\nI ran across this gem of an album, originally released on LP in the 1970s and previously released in 1995 as part of a 2-CD set with works by Pierre Boulez, George Crumb (the item listed above) and others, by accident on the Naxos Music Library. It’s one of a bunch of older recordings that Vox has been making available on CD over the past several months, and this one might easily have escaped your attention, as it did mine.\n\nOne reason is that the conductor on this album, Jim Thome (born in 1937 and still with us) and his Orchestra of Our Time simply don’t have as high a profile in the classical music world for performing contemporary music as the Louisville Orchestra or the late Robert Craft. Checking him up online, I discovered that his biggest claim to fame was that he did a full concert of music by the late Frank Zappa, an ambitious, musically well-intentioned but limited talent who thought (as his devoted followers thought and still think) that he was a musical genius. He was very clever, but not nearly as creative as he thought he was, but Thome rode that horse to a brief moment of stardom and it sort of branded him, unfortunately, as a niche performer.\n\nYet this album attests to Thome’s excellent skills as a conductor of modern music. Of the companion disc not included here, the one item that grabbed me was George Crumb’s Night Music I, a piece that, somehow, I had failed to get in my collection, so I tacked on the YouTube link for your edification. The other three items are also available on YouTube, but of course you must be prepared to watch three-to-four-minute ads ranging from cell phones or fried chicken to rather disgusting promos for products that cure toe fungus, constipation, incessant flatulence or head lice (happily, not all in the same ad).\n\nThis version of Pierrot Lunaire is accurately sung and played, to be sure, but is stiff and metronomic in rhythm; you can actually count the beats as they go past your ear. Of course, this could be the way Thome conceived it, wanting the listener to have at least the rhythm to hang onto as an aural signpost when listening to it, but it is unusual. Not even Schoenberg’s own 1940 recording of the piece for Columbia, which suffers from dry, claustrophobic mono sound, has as resolutely steady a rhythm as this—not to mention the performances by Bethany Beardslee (with Craft) and Patricia Kopatchinskaya. Yet part of this is also due to the delivery by mezzo-soprano Maureen McNalley, who sounds more weary and blasé than she does crazy in a fun sort of way. Yet the performance loosens up a bit by the midway point, where the playing of the ensemble is particularly excellent.\n\nFor a Christmas piece, the Concerto is pretty much atonal and quite busy, but again the rhythm is quite regular although Valerie Lamoree’s voice us under better control and more fluid in delivering the sung lines. But this is surely one of the strangest pieces of “Christmas” music I’ve ever heard, completely atonal, and after the soft,delicate opening, the notes bounce around like Mexican jumping beans in a container. Valerie Lamoree, however, is a livelier singer than McNalley, and here Thome conducts with greater energy than in the Schoenberg piece. I’ve been unable to locate any other commercial recording, and since this one had no liner notes online, I can’t tell you the exact text being sung, but the diction is very clear. , so if you understand Italian you should have no problem.\n\nParole di San Paolo is sung by Benita Valente, a vastly overrated soprano of my youth who had very little voice and what she did have was dry-sounding and fluttery, but she was a first-class musician so that instrumentalists and conductors adored her. She’s at least competent here, and the music is again resolutely atonal. Without a score, the naked ear cannot really explain all that is going on, but I did find this information on the Cambridge University Press website. an excerpt from The Twelve-Tone Music of Luigi Dallapiccola by Brian Alegant:\n\nIt models the twelve-tone techniques and strategies, the small-scale and large-scale form, and the pitchclass and set-class associations on the surface. Particular emphasis is placed on showing how changes in partitioning strategies articulate changes in the form.\n\nParole is written for medium voice and an instrumental ensemble that includes two pairs of woodwinds (flute/alto flute, and clarinet/bass clarinet), pitched percussion (celesta, piano, harp, vibraphone), and viola and cello. On the whole, its soundscape is more Webernian than Schoenbergian, and recalls the linear orientation and polyphonic textures of such first- and second-phase compositions as the Quattro liriche di Antonio Machado, Goethe-Lieder, and An Mathilde. A few passages look forward to the sound ideal of Sicut Umbra, the first work completed after Ulisse. One of its most striking attributes is a mutable approach to text setting: virtually every line of the text evokes a change in dynamics, texture, rhythmic profile, and partitioning strategy. As a result, the surface changes frequently, and cantabile passages with soft dynamics and thin textures are juxtaposed with furioso passages with loud dynamics and thick textures.\n\nParole di San Paolo models the twelve-tone techniques and strategies, the small-scale and large-scale form, and the pitchclass and set-class associations on the surface. Particular emphasis is placed on showing how changes in partitioning strategies articulate changes in the form.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Parole draws its techniques from all four serial phases. First-phase features include the use of cross partitions, periodic structuring, and a transparent orchestration and ethereal atmosphere. Second-phase features include floating rhythm (schwebender Rhythmus), a prohibition against octave doublings, and the (Webernian) procedures of trichordal derivation and axial symmetry (with both even and odd index numbers). Features common to third- and fourth-phase works are a fluid approach to row handling and aggregate formation, some rhythmicized Klangfarbenmelodie, a prevalence of ultra-soft dynamics, and, especially, the Schoenbergian ideal of associating segmental and nonsegmental harmonies. (These procedures are explained in due course.) By the same token, Parole spurns many procedures that are found in the surrounding compositions (namely, Preghiere, Three Questions with Two Answers, and Ulisse), avoiding hexachordal inversional combinatoriality, leitrhythms, un-pitched percussion, and thick sound masses.\n\nIf you can make sense of that, more power to you. For me, any music that needs this much information to be understood is emotionally stunted to begin with. If all you’re listening to or for is the technique used to construct a piece, it’s just a mathematical exercise and not music, but fortunately Dallapiccola’s music does evoke strange and exotic feelings in the listener, thus you can pretty much ignore the “hexachordal inversional combinatoriality” and just enjoy it for what it is.\n\nHappily, George Crumb’s music always communicated with his listeners provided that they at least come halfway to him, and this wonderful piece, though again conducted a bit on the rhythmically strict side, receives a wonderful reading from the late, great Jan de Gaetani. She had a medium-sized voice, larger than that of Cathy Berberian but smaller than most operatic mezzos, that carried wonderfully in the hall due to its bright, perfect focus, although in Night Music I she is most often called upon to speak the words in pitch as in Pierrot Lunaire rather than to sing out. Yet she was such a great communicative artist, very much on a part with Berberian, that once she broke through to fame within the classical community she never looked back until her untimely death: like Berberian and Tatiana Troyanos, she died in her early 50s, a great loss to the classical world. This recording, I discovered online, was recorded in 1979 (along with the Boulez Éclat and works by Dlugoszewski and Berio) and originally issued on the Candide label.\n\nCrumb’s score for this piece, like so many of his works of that time, is based on the clever and colorful use of percussion to create a strange and exotic sound-world around the singer. It was a gift of his to be able to continually vary these sounds so that, although everything he wrote was stamped with his personal style, no two pieces really sounded exactly alike. There are several moments in Night Music I, for instance, where Crumb gives the singer sustained notes to sing; she is not expected to chatter away with the complex rhythms as in Ancient Voices of Children, the work (and recording) that shot de Gaetani to fame in the early 1970s.\n\nMy assessment of Thome, then, is of a meticulous musician who undoubtedly spent many hours rehearsing difficult modern music until he reached a point where its performance had a structural unity about it, and for that I thank him, although I don’t think that his performances have the sweep or inner excitement of Craft’s. Nonetheless, considering the rarity of these works (Pierrot Lunaire excepted), I highly recommend this recording for your collection. The sound quality is excellent throughout, and to the above I might also recommend Pierre Boulez’s Éclat, another modern percussion piece whose delicacy of texture and ingenious structure fully matches the scores of Dallapiccola and Crumb.\n\n—© 2024 Lynn René Bayley\n\nFollow me on Facebook (as Monique Musique)\n\nCheck out the books on my blog…they’re worth reading, trust me!\n\nSORABJI: Désir épérdu for piano.8 Il tessuto d’arabeschi for flute & string quartet.1,10 Le mauvais jardinier for voice & piano.2,8 Frammento cantato for baritone & piano.6,8 Fantasiettina atematica for oboe, flute & clarinet.3 Trois poèmes for soprano & piano.4,8 Cinque sonetti di Michelangelo Buonarroti for baritone & chamber orch.5.6,10 Arabesque for soprano & piano.4,8 Benedizione di San Francesco d’Assisifor baritone and organ.6 Trois poèmes di Gulistān de Sa’dī for voice & piano.7,9 [4] Frammenti aforistici for piano.8 Frammento cantato for baritone & organ.6 Movement for voice & piano2.9 / Chappell Kingsland, 8pno/org /1cond; 1Sharon Bezaly, 3Julie Thornton, fl; 10Wild Beautiful Ens; 2Sharon Harms, 4Zoë Spangler, sop; 6Andrew Garland, 7Christopher Grundy, bar; Sarah Bierhaus, ob; Jeremy Reynolds, cl; 5Taylor Gonzales, cond; 9Bryan Chuan, pno / Bis SACD-2683\n\nOne of my Facebook followers complained to me that all of Kaikhosru Sorabji’s music is for the piano, which is like saying that all of Chopin’s and most of Scriabin’s music is for that instrument. The issue is not what instrument or instruments it is written for but whether or not the music is great, bad, or mediocre, and I also pointed out to him that Sorabji wrote very long symphonies, of which I only have one recording and that is an unofficial YouTube release created by a synthesizer mixed with some real-life instrumentalists. Sorabji’s music is just so long, complex and confusing to most listeners that it is never played much in concert.\n\nOn this disc, however, we have 13 of his compositions, only two of which are for solo piano, six are songs or song cycles for voice and piano, and two of which are purely instrumental. More interestingly, none of them are very long; only four of them are 13 minutes or longer, the rest clocking in at between a minute and a half to six and a half minutes except for the opening Désir épérdu for piano which is, shockingly, only 50 seconds long. Thus this may be the recording that my follower would want to start with to orient himself with Sorabji creating music on a smaller scale. Many of these, according to the booklet, are late works, so either he wrote shorter because he had reached a point in life where he could compress his ideas or he was afraid to extend himself because he felt his time was shortening, thus he didn’t want to get bogged down in trying to extent his musical forms to epic lengths.\n\nIndeed, the second piece on this album, Il tessuro d’arabeschi (1979) for flute and string quartet, is so densely written and in such a strongly bitonal style that it could easily pass for something composed in the past 10 years or so. Listening as carefully as I could, however, I got the impression that the dissonance one hears from the accompanying string quartet is in itself written in a microtonal rather than a bitonal fashion, because most of the time the strings do not sound as if they are in complete harmonic concordance with each other, but one of my readers informs me that Sorabji never used microtonality, thus one of them was not properly tuned, but since these are highly-paid professionals I couldn’t accept that fact that it was a performance flaw. Consider, for instance, that on this track the string quartet has a conductor to hold them together. But without the score, I can’t be certain, and the problem, if it is one, occurs in the upper strings. The cello is rock solid in tune from start to finish and, as usual, Sharon Bezaly’s playing is simply astonishing. She was one of former label owner Robert von Bahr’s favorite artists on Bis. For music written by an 87-year-old composer, it is simply astonishing.\n\nLe mauvais d’jardinier is a much earlier piece, composed in 1918 or ’19 when Sorabji was only 26 or 27 years old. In some ways it is typical of his song writing, yet there are many parlando passages in it that clearly show the influence of Schoenberg’s Pierrot Lunaire. This in itself is rather amazing, since the majority of Sorabji’s music leaned towards tonality even when it was harmonically complex (or even harmonically congested) and almost never towards the new Viennese school. The Frammento cantato for baritone and piano is much more typical of his songwriting style; written in 1967, it is lyrical in the tradition of other 20th-century British composers like Vaughan Williams. (For a guy who constantly complained about not being “really” British because his father was Parsi, it always struck me as ironic that not only did Sorabji, whose birth name was Leon Dudley, stay in England his entire life but that most of his music borrowed practically nothing from Middle Eastern culture except for his piano piece Gulistān.)\n\nThe Trois poèmes for soprano and piano were written at a midway point in his career (1941), a time when he was much more famous in England for his witty yet trenchant music criticism and a few years after he banned all public performances of his music for about 30 years. This is very much quintessential song writing for Sorabji, a lyrical and largely tonal top line riding over a technically difficult, harmonically complex and musically contrasting piano part, although in this case I found the piano accompaniment even busier than usual, almost to the point where it buried the singer and interfered with her line, particularly in the first song. Happily both of our sopranos have clear, well-trained voices with no audible defects and, wonder of wonders, clear diction, although between the two of them I felt that Zoë Spangler, who sings this trio of songs, had a more interesting and distinctive timbre than Sharon Harms.\n\nInterestingly, Sorabji’s setting of five sonnets of Michelangelo are much denser in harmony and trickier in rhythm (the orchestra always seems to be playing not only different music but different harmony and rhythms than the singer) than the more famous set by Benjamin Britten for piano and tenor written 17 years later…but since Sorabji was a lone-wolf composer whose music was rarely performed, I doubt that Britten even knew of this music’s existence. The “Wild Beautiful Orchestra” and its offshoot, the Wild Beautiful Ensemble, are aptly named in terms of their wildness but not necessarily in terms of beauty of sound. Here, I felt that their very individual timbres made their playing in the different orchestral sections sound discrete from the other sections. But again, I don’t have a score and can’t tell if this was Sorabji’s intent. With his music, the naked ear can’t always tell what exactly is going on, particularly when he wrote for an instrumental ensemble. His ears were just tuned differently from other composers’. One interesting feature of this song cycle is that the sonnets are linked musically with no break between them.\n\nThe Arabesque for soprano and piano is much more typical of the usual Sorabji song, an exotic piano accompaniment to a lyrical if somewhat bitonal sung line—except that it’s very short. The Benediction of St. Francis of Assisi returns us to a fairly turgid accompaniment, in this case by an organ, but it, too is quite short. We hear our alternate baritone, Christopher Grundy, in the Gulistān poems; his voice, unfortunately, is not a good one, being too far back in the throat and unsteady in tonal emission which makes him sound a twinge flat most of the time, but the music is again interesting. Encasing his dry, forced, out of tune voice in a sea of reverb does not help matters. We then hear two fragments, one for piano and the other for baritone and organ. Although I generally like Bis’ SACD sonics, on this recording all of the organ pieces sound too muddy and indistinct for me. I don’t necessarily want to hear an organ that sounds as if I’m standing in the middle of the big pipes.\n\nWe end this survey of Sorabji’s music with a wordless “movement” for soprano and piano, another piece quite typical of his writing for such a combination, very well sung by Harms. Except for Grundy’s singing, this is an excellent disc from start to finish, a real ear-opener even for such a veteran Sorabji listener as myself. An excellent addition to the growing catalog of his music on records.\n\n—© 2024 Lynn René Bayley\n\nFollow me on Facebook (as Monique Musique)\n\nCheck out the books on my blog…they’re worth reading, trust me!\n\nA friend of mine sent me a CD which included a large number of recordings, most of them acoustic, of rare recordings from the first 34 years of the 20th century. Several of them impressed me, but none quite as forcibly as a Belgian tenor I’d never heard of, Laurent Swolfs. Although he was “only” singing a song, Flégier’s Le beau rêve, the voice absolutely bowled me over. Who WAS this guy? Well, as we shall see, except for a brief sojourn in Vienna, he restricted his career to Belgium, France and Holland, and although he recorded extensively between 1906 and 1924, 193 sides in all (21 were unissued, destroyed takes), he played “record tag” with a number of labels, some of them obscure like Reneyphone and Disque du Saphir, and even when he recorded for known labels like Odeon, Pathé or HMV, they only had local distribution. No one had ever issued an entire album of his recordings; the closest any of them came was Malibran Records, which put six tracks by him on a CD of Belgian and Flemish singers. You can view his entire discography by clicking HERE.\n\nSo I began digging. I found eight other recordings on YouTube, one or two on the Internet Archive, and a surprise cache on another site which finally included a couple of Wagner arias. Yet this was a man who sang a wide gamut of roles, from such lyric parts as Wilhelm Meister in Mignon, the title role in Werther etc. to Canio in Pagliacci, Enée in Le Prise du Troie (the first part of Berlioz’ Les Troyens) and all of the Wagner roles, which makes him the only other tenor besides Lauritz Melchior to sing the full range of Wagner’s approved operas. Yet frustratingly, most of his 172 recordings were of songs (he was particularly fond of Keurvels’ Wiegenliedje)! Some of these were really rubbish, like Ma Curly-Headed Baby,\n\nand for some ungodly reason he made three different versions of “Cantique de Noel” (“O Holy Night”). He also recorded two different takes of “Chanson Hindou,“ but NOT the Rimsky-Korsakov aria; it was written by Bemberg. Like Caruso, he recorded a version of Handel’s “Ombra mai fu” from Xerxes at his last recording session (1924). He was also loath to record duets. The only ones he made were Faure’s “Crucifix” with a Dutch bass named Huylebroeck for Parlophone c. 1912 and three duets (one each from Mirielle, Faust, and Carmen) with a French soprano named Berthe d’Anory for Reneyphone/Polydor in 1922 or ’23. Apparently he had a thing for doing songs or, like Jon Vickers, he hated “ripping” arias and duets out of context to record as a single item, but sooner or later I came up with 16 sides—technically, enough to fill out a full LP back in Ye Olde Days.\n\nHere is what I learned about him by searching online. Born in Ghent in 1868, Swolfs studied singing in Antwerp and Brussels with Désiré Demest, among others, but it was essentially Demest who settled his voice for life. Demest was also the teacher of Fernand Ansseau, Armand Crabbe and Hector Dufranne, all first-rate singers. Swolfs began his career as a concert singer, then made his debut in 1901 at the Opera House of Antwerp as Max in Der Freischütz. In 1903 he was engaged by the Théâtre de la Monnaie in Brussels, where he had a successful career for more than 20 years. In 1906 he sang, astonishingly, the first part of Berlioz’ Les Troyens (La prise de Troie) in Brussels with Mme. Charles-Mazarin and Sylvain Dupuis (11 performances), then later the same season created the role of Herod in the Belgian premiere of Strauss’ Salome (17 performances), and in the 1908-09 season he worked at the Opera House of Lyon. In 1908, conductor-composer Felix Weingartner, who heard him in Antwerp, brought Swolfs to the Vienna Court Opera to create the leading role in Weingartner’s opera Genesius. While in Vienna he also sang the title roles in Lohengrin and Samson et Dalila. In 1910 he had a huge success at the Paris Grand Opéra as Siegmund and as Samson. In 1911 he sang at the Opéra-Comique of Paris in the premiere of Albéric Magnard’s opera Bérénice. In 1913, he appeared there as Loge in Rheingold (one Wagner role that even Melchior never sang) and made guest appearance at the Opera House of Nice. After the First World War, he became a successor to Ernest van Dyck as a professor at the Brussels Conservatoire. From 1923-25 he was at the same time the artistic manager of the Opera House of Antwerp and continued singing. After his retirement he lived in Ghent, and near the end of his life he became blind.\n\nThe one thing everyone agreed on was that he had a powerfully controlled and metallically shining voice. What I found most interesting about him were two things: first, that he took most of his high notes in head voice or voix mixte, much like the French fort tenor Léon Escalaïs, and second, that he had almost inexhaustible lung power which allowed him to sustain phrases for an incredibly long span. In addition to these assets, he was also a sensitive and musically creative singer who could shade the voice and color it effectively, especially in those songs. In short, his is the kind of singing that should be a model today for virtually any tenor attempting to sing heroic roles, but of course he isn’t. Most modern dramatic tenors bluster and bellow as if they were trying to blow down the third little pig’s house of bricks and not doing so. They have vocal strain, wobble, uneven registers and all sorts of vocal flaws which would never have allowed them to get beyond comprimario roles in the old days. But of course we can’t just blame the singers themselves; all of them had teachers, thus it is to the teaching methods of today that we must lay 90% of the blame. Lauritz Melchior, Wolfgang Windgassen, James King and Jon Vickers all sang with steady tonal emission well into their 60s. There is really no excuse for the garbage we hear coming out of modern-day dramatic tenors. Even José Cura, who started singing professionally rather late and went on a bit too long, had some marvelous years when he didn’t have half the problems we hear out of such tenors today.\n\nBut to return to Swolfs, one really must hear him to believe him. Like Escalaïs, Caruso, Slezak and a very few others, his voice sounded remarkably natural even on acoustics, and I would go so far as to say, based on the cross-section of records I’ve heard spanning 14 years, he was even more consistent than the latter two. Putting it plainly, Laurent Swolfs was a singing machine, but one with a heart and a mind. What sounds so easy on the records must have cost him untold hours of practice and discipline to create and, more importantly, maintain.\n\nCuriously, there is almost nothing available online about his personal life. We don’t even know if he was married or had children, and nowhere can you find an inkling about his personality. We know at least a little bit about his more famous Dutch contemporary, Jacques Urlus, than we do about him. Of course it is his singing that principally engages us, but it would be interesting to know if he was a lover of poetry since his song interpretations are so outstanding.\n\nAlthough there is no direct personal information on Swolfs, in 1943 he wrote, according to operaphile-collector Claude-Pascal Perna on Flickr, “an informative and most witty book (not an autobiography) on opera and on his contacts with fellow singers” entitled Souvenirs de Théâtre et de Coulisses (Theatre and Backstage Memories). If you read French and want a copy, it is currently available at AbeBooks.co.uk for a mere $39.70 (or £31.40) plus shipping. I haven’t read it. Below is a reproduction of the cover and a sample page.\n\nI have uploaded most of my Swolfs recordings, cleaned up as best I could, to the Internet Archive, and at a page on the Historical Tenors website you can hear five more recordings (not cleaned up) including two of his Wagner excerpts, “Am stillen herd” from Die Meistersinger and the “Wintersturme” from Die Walküre. Yet all of this information put together does not indicate the breadth of Swolfs’ repertoire, which included Dalibor, Der Evangelimann, Der Freischütz, La damnation de Faust, Hérodiade, Elektra, and even one of the “outside” Wagner operas, Feuersnot—yet oddly, it did not include the French operas from which he recorded the duets with Mme. d’Anory!\n\nIn any event, Laurent Swolfs is clearly a tenor you should investigate if you are a lover of truly great singing. As I wrote to my friend, he has brought several excellent but neglected singers to my attention over the years (such as mezzo-soprano Susanne Brohly), but among tenors Swolfs is clearly the greatest artist and voice of them all.\n\n—© 2024 Lynn René Bayley\n\nFollow me on Facebook (as Monique Musique)\n\nCheck out the books on my blog…they’re worth reading, trust me!\n\nIf you were asked to name the best classical music satirists if the 20th century, the first name on your lips would undoubtedly be the late Peter Schickele, a.k.a. P.D.Q. Bach, with Spike Jones and Anna Russell probably coming in at Nos. 2 and 3. The next name on the list would probably be Victor Borge; those who are deeply involved in opera might come up with falsetto soprano Michael Aspinall or female opera satirist B.J. Ward. But you’d probably run out of names without ever coming up with that of Alec Templeton. Until a few days ago, the only thing I knew Templeton from was his tongue-in-cheek fugue from Bach Goes to Town, which was recorded (and performed in person) by Benny Goodman’s popular swing band back in 1938.\n\nBut a friend of mine from Brooklyn sent me a homemade CD on which he included Templeton’s 1936 recording of Arthur Sullivan’s The Lost Chord, first played straight (well, some of it, anyway) and then played as if it were a patter song from one of the Gilbert & Sullivan operettas. It was just so funny that I had to look him up online, at which point I discovered a great deal more of him: vicious satires of Italian opera (including a Metropolitan Opera “performance” of Ziggy Elman’s swing tune And the Angels Sing), a simulation of all the different musical sounds you hear in the corridors of a music conservatory, one recording on which he played The Stars and Stripes Forever as a Strauss waltz and The Beautiful Blue Danube as a Sousa march, a surprisingly good imitation of Frankie Laine singing “My heart at thy sweet voice” from Samson et Dalila, a take-off of a man with a new radio who just likes to dial-flip, parodies of German lieder singers and off-key Gilbert & Sullivan choruses, and a sign-off song called Good-Byee in which he informs his audience that he can’t wait to get off the stage. And on top off all this, there are his tongue-in-cheek jazz-classical hybrids: in addition to Bach Goes to Town there are also Mozart a la Mode, Mendelssohn Mows ‘Em Down, the Ghost Rhapsody and a Pocket-Sized Sonata for Clarinet and Piano. The first-named of these has been recorded by several pianists as well as by the distinguished British harpsichordist George Malcolm and the last-named by a surprisingly large number of clarinetists including the legendary Reginald Kell (who gives us the squarest and least swinging version of all). At his height in the 1940s and ‘50s, Templeton was an almost permanent summer replacement show on radio, played both jazz and classical works with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra in the 1950s, appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show and had not one but two TV programs on the Dumont network.\n\nSo why is he forgotten?\n\nMy guess is that it’s because most of his classical spoofs ended around 1941, by which time he had become very popular as an erudite radio host who played popular and light classical piano works on the air as well as on records. Out of sight, out of mind, you know, and Templeton’s transformation from classical satirist to popular jazz and classical entertainer was virtually complete.\n\nBorn in Wales in either 1909 and 1910—according to Wikipedia, his birth certificate clearly states 1909 but his tombstone says 1910—Templeton was, like George Shearing, blind from birth but showed remarkable musical talent at a very early age. How early? Well, he was admitted to Worcester College, Oxford at the age of NINE where he studied the organ with Ivor Adkins and later was admitted at an early age to the Royal College of Music in London. In addition to having a steel-trap mind that could remember any and all music he heard, Templeton was also gifted with absolute pitch, which later helped him in his very complex classical spoofs. Judging from his recordings, he must have driven the other students at the Royal College crazy with his devastating spoofs and sharp wit. They were probably very happy to see him go when he graduated.\n\nTempleton was hired as the jazz pianist in Jack Hylton’s very popular British dance band. During their tour of America in 1936, Templeton decided to go out on his own and stay in the U.S., where he became a citizen a few years later. In that same year of 1936 he made his first series of records for The Gramophone Shop in New York, which included The Lost Chord, The Shortest Wagnerian Opera, the Ghost Rhapsody and his spoofs of Italian opera, off-key Pinafore selections and his Trip Though a Conservatory. Possibly for the first time in show business history, recordings made for a small label led in turn to his being discovered not only by musicians but also by the entertainment industry. By 1939 he was a sensation, recording for RCA Victor; a year later he jumped to Columbia for a few more devastating parodies (including versions of the popular song Some of These Days as it might have been played by Bach, Czerny, Bob Zurke and Rachmaninoff).\n\nBut then…he went “serious” on us. An album of piano solos for Decca is disappointing unless you like cocktail-party versions of Gershwin or the Grieg piano concerto, but as it turns out, this is just what America wanted to hear, so Templeton became famous, made money (lots of it), but lost his mojo.\n\nBy the early 1950s he had amassed so much money, in fact, that he could subsidize his somewhat expensive hobby of collecting musical clocks and music boxes, which he absolutely loved. Remarkably, he issued two LPs of them, one in mono on the old Remington label and another in stereo on RCA Victor. They’re cute to listen to but certainly not something most people would want to hear more than once. Yet they sold surprisingly well at the time, and in a rare November 1952 appearance on the Sullivan Show he showed that he still “had it,” doing his Frankie Laine-sings-opera spoof as well as a jazz song called Give Me the Name, Age, Height and Size of You. In 1958 he appeared on one TV program playing soft jazz numbers like Moonglow, then he died in 1963 of unrevealed causes.\n\nThus did Alec Templeton maximize his talent as best he could, but those of us who loved his classical satires regret the metamorphosis. Still, you can find a great deal of his early material online at both the Internet Archive and YouTube. If you are a fan of well-done and devastatingly funny classical spoofs, I urge you to go and listen to them. You can also find excellent performances of Mozart a la Mode by Paul Berton, the complete Pocket Sized Sonata by clarinetist Andrej Supan, and Malcolm’s recording of Bach Goes to Town. They somehow all fit together to portray an immensely talented pianist-singer who walked a tightrope between blatant musical satire and true popular appeal at the keyboard.\n\nAnd don’t forget to check out his Good-Byeee song as sung by him along with Bea Lillie and Bing Crosby. I’d love to hear some classical singer do this as a final encore in one of their recitals!\n\n—© 2024 Lynn René Bayley\n\nFollow me on Facebook (as Monique Musique)\n\nCheck out the books on my blog…they’re worth reading, trust me!\n\nJ.S.

The reason, of course, is that these were musicians, not machines, and they grew up in an atmosphere in which musical phrasing was curvilinear and not brittle and angular. Of course, the same thing applies to all modern composers who shook the world between the years 1910 and 1950, a group which includes but is not restricted to Béla Bartók (listen to his own piano recordings of his music!!!), Zoltán Kodály, Serge Prokofiev. Artur Schnabel and of course Alban Berg, which is why I always prefer recorded performances that reflect these features of musical styles.\n\nThe particular comment that struck me forcibly in Craft’s book was that Webern’s late works were “never” performed correctly until the early 21st century, also that Tony Arnold’s performances of Webern’s songs were superior to those of Marni Nixon, who had recorded the Webern songs with Craft back in the mid-1950s. This spurred me to go online and research his later recordings of these works, and voila, this is the CD I came up with—one of the very few of Webern’s music that I didn’t have in my collection. And to paraphrase the title of Craft’s book, these performances really were a “discovery.”\n\nQuite aside from the high quality of these performances by the various forces involved, one is continually astonished by Craft’s taut, dramatic conducting. For a man who was in his late 80s at the time, it is almost unbelievable; there is no drop-off in intensity in any of his late Naxos recordings, even when compared to his earlier self. I’m convinced that if he had a wider repertoire and didn’t just confine himself to four composers, of which the only early one was Gesualdo, Craft would be thought of as one of the greatest conductors of all time. But of course, the reason he did confine himself to these composers was that their music was, and remained, under-represented on records for nearly a half-century, and since his performances and recordings were so meticulously researched and rehearsed, everyone knew before buying the records that his interpretations were to be considered the last word on these composers. (Note that he stopped recording Gesualdo once he realized that several other very skilled Renaissance vocal groups had finally come to terms with them.)\n\nWebern’s one transcription on this disc, the Bach Ricerare, is skillfully orchestrated, with sparse textures and only one or two chords attacked by the full orchestra. He frequently uses the brass, especially the trumpets, to play counter-lines against the strings, knowing that their timbres would not blend. And this is also what we hear as soon as we get into the two songs for chorus and mixed instruments. What fascinated me in this music was the extremely complex counterpoint that Webern created, again voiced for clarity and transparency so that the chorus can stand out. What a phenomenal ear this man had! I was lucky enough to hear his Five Pieces for Orchestra twice in live performances, once by Pierre Boulez when he was music director of the New York Philharmonic (and trust me, New York audiences did NOT appreciate him; in fact, they hated him and that music) and once by Michael Gielen with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, Gielen tried to soften the blow by mixing the Webern pieces with excerpts from Schubert’s Rosamunde music. I liked it, but again it didn’t go over well with the staid audience.\n\nIn the second of the 5 Movements for String Orchestra, marked “Sehr langsam,” Craft’s new approach to Webern is apparent, especially in the languorous legato of the viola soloist. And yes, it makes a very different impact on the listener that hearing it played in the stiff, clipped fashion that it was recorded at=, even by Craft, in the 1950s, but you can even hear a more relaxed approach to rhythm in the following, faster “Sehr bewegt.” The music, quite simply, has a different vibe. It’s not exactly sweet music, to be sure, but much of its abrasiveness is defused when played this way.\n\nThe songs performed here by Tony Arnold are also, as promised, better than the Nixon recordings, but this is due not only to the new approach to the music. Arnold, quite simply, had a sweeter voice with an even better legato than Nixon, good though she was for that time. I think the only soprano of the 1950s who would have given better performances than Nixon would have been Magda Lászlo, who seldom performed in America. In addition to her sweeter voice and purer legato, Arnold also at least attempts to interpret the lyrics, thus making her a genuine lieder singer and not just “a voice.”\n\nAnd of course, the sonics on this album far outstrip Craft’s Columbia recordings of the ‘50s. For once, Naxos avoided overloading these recordings of excessive reverb and echo. There is natural space around voices and instruments, which is all you need, in fact anything more than this would have spoiled one’s listening experience to the almost lace-like delicacy of Webern’s scoring. Here we can appreciate, as for instance in the Op. 10 5 Pieces for Orchestra, his use of “space” and quietude in combination with a lyrical performance.\n\nI was particularly interested to hear the Cantata No. 2 since I already owned, and liked, his Cantata No. 1. This is even a bit longer than its predecessor and, for once, Webern used a full-sized orchestra to back his soloists and chorus. Craft was one of those rare conductors who always had excellent taste in singers, thus I didn’t feel the need to cringe before hearing the bass soloist (Davis Wilson-Johnson), but this was 2008 and even for Craft, he had to compromise with a singer whose voice is basically unsteady, though his pitch is fairly good and his diction excellent. Soprano Claire Booth, however, was excellent. Sadly, the text was not included in the booklet because at that time (2008) the poetry of Hildegard Jone were still under strict copyright, but now, in 2024, the statute of limitations has run out (at least in Europe if not in America, where greedy bastards insist on at least 100 years to make sure that no one can profit from dispersing high art which only appeals to perhaps 20% of the world population), and you can find the texts on Emily Ezust’s superb LiederNet Archive, one of the great (if sometimes maddeningly incomplete) resources in the world. In a nutshell, it is a largely secular cantata (or perhaps more accurately, a Deist cantata) focusing on the sounds of nature. Here are the lyrics of the second section:\n\nVery deeply muted, innermost life sings\n\nin the beehive in the quiet midnight,\n\nbecause within it there still comes the message\n\nthat diligence creates sweetness from colourful multiplicity.\n\nThe beehive, the white canopy of stars,\n\nis densely permeated by the sweet light of creation.\n\nWithin it circles every bee-world,\n\nuntil the swarm breaks out into eternal morning.\n\nThe heart, the smallest beehive,\n\nsurrounds all of the others.\n\nIts honey is clarified by the one beekeeper\n\nwho loves the sweetness of pure love,\n\nwhich he bestows fully.\n\nBeing one of Webern’s late works (written in 1941-43), we are given the full brunt of his mature style in this cantata. Even with Craft’s “new” approach, this music is harmonically more abrasive than almost anything that preceded it on the CD, but like all of Webern’s music it is not confused or assembled just to create cheap effects. He put tremendous thought into every note, let alone every bar, but even the most advanced listener will feel disoriented at times when he ends different sections of this work in the middle of nowhere, without any resolution, not even an atonal resolution.\n\nListening to nearly 80 full minutes of Webern at one sitting can be a challenge even with this more lyrical approach. So many pieces are so dense (e.g., the 5 Sacred Songs, Op. 15, which makes the Op. 13 songs sound almost like Schubert) that continuous listening not only taxes the mind but tends to run many of these works together, which was never Webern’s intention. Thus I recommend that you take a few breaks when listening to this music. It will enhance your appreciation of these small, delicately-crafted gems, sparkling but miniature cameos cut with the tip of a pin. Even the Variations for Orchestra, which runs seven and a half minutes, sounds longer because so much music is compressed into each and every bar. In addition, Webern’s constant use of short pauses gives one the impression of hearing several movements during that timespan rather than just one.\n\nHighly recommended. If you don’t have these works in your collection, this CD is an absolute must, and even if you own the early Craft Webern set, you need to hear how these performance were modified to meet Webern’s meticulous demands.\n\n—© 2024 Lynn René Bayley\n\nFollow me on Facebook (as Monique Musique)\n\nCheck out the books on my blog…they’re worth reading, trust me!"
