Atom Earth Mother: A solo project from one half of :zoviet*france: Dedicated to the White Goddess and inspired by the prehistoric antiquities in Northumberland, primarily the enigmatic and beautiful Ârock artÂ¹ that are known as Âcup and ringÂ¹ marks, a form of symbolic language 4500+ years old, whose meaning has been lost in the mists of time. Utilizing digital and analogue equipment and production technique, location recordings, found sound and employing experimentation as the creative tool, Atom Earth Mother embarks on a sonic journey to the origins of our civilization and indeed our very being. ÂAncient FaithÂ¹ is an album about love and faith, and although it started out as homage to the Earth Mother, it soon became a deeply personal story documenting the end of a love affair and the emotional aftermath. Stunningly packaged in a wooden box with a hand branded conjoined Âcup and ringÂ¹ marked design burnt into the front panel, and containing a photographic insert with two superb images of the antiquities that were the major inspiration, taken by the artist himself, this double vinyl has three sides of audio and a fourth side that contains an etching of a Âcup and ringÂ¹ mark. Included in the package is an enhanced CDR including; original digital sound files of the tracks, an album of photographs of the process of creating the packaging, a short video of the branding and a PDF document detailing the story of how Atom Earth Mother and ÂAncient FaithÂ¹ came to exist and incorporating a list of credits to all who helped make this album happen. 54,00 EURO _________________________________ *WILLIAM BASINSKI 'Nocturnes' CD New album on his own 2062 label incl. 2 long tracks: 'Nocturnes' - Dark, suspended and formerly early prepared piano and tape composition from San Francisco period c. 1979-80. 'The Trail of Tears' - Tape loop and delay recording from 2009. Excerpted in the new Robert Wilson opera, The Life and Death of Marina Abramovic. 16,00 EURO __________________________________________________________ WILLIAM BASINSKI + RICHARD CHARTIER 'Aurora Liminalis' CD LINE is pleased to announce the upcoming release of the second highly anticipated collaboration from renowned composer William Basinski and sound artist Richard Chartier. Aurora Liminalis is a rich and nebulous soundtrack, the aural equivalent of undulating trails of light. Disintegrating spatial shifts incorporating the two artists' distinct sonic palettes mesh to create a slow, deep ebb and flow like some melting spectral transmission. The work has a distinct complex presence, difficult to resist its pull. Befitting cover image by visual artist James Elaine. 14,00 EURO _________________________________________________________________ WILLIAM BASINSKI 'The Disintegration Loops' 9LP/5CD/DVD/BOOK BOX For a collection of music built around the poignant inevitability of decay, there has been a great many hopeful and inspired words devoted to William Basinski's The Disintegration Loops: stunning, ethereal, majestic, transfixing, life-affirming... and for good reason. From its 20-year gestation period to its infamously fateful completion, The Disintegration Loops is one of the most powerful manifestations of the inevitable cycle of life ever committed to tape, even as it documents the inevitable decay of all that is committed to tape. The very passage of time is its most effective instrument. To mark the 10-year anniversary of its original release -- and its forthcoming induction into the 9/11 Memorial Museum this year -- Temporary Residence Ltd. is honored to collaborate with William Basinski in presenting The Disintegration Loops in a fashion truly befitting a library of music with such a lasting legacy. This massive limited-edition box set contains all four historic volumes, plus a pair of stunning live orchestral performances from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the 54th Venice Biennale, both previously unreleased. Remastered from the original recordings and pressed onto 100% virgin vinyl for the first and only time, this exquisite box set also includes all of the remastered recordings on 5 CDs, the extremely rare 63-minute The Disintegration Loops film on DVD, and a 144-page full-color coffee table book featuring rare photos taken during the making of The Disintegration Loops, and liner notes by Basinski, Antony, David Tibet of Current 93, Ronen Givony of the Wordless Music Series, and Michael Shulan, Creative Director of the National September 11 Memorial Museum. The Disintegration Loops has never appeared on vinyl, and will never appear so again outside of this sincerely special, breathtakingly beautiful collection. 340,00 EURO _____________________________ BRUME 'Two Characters' 10INCH Through more than 25 years of existence, the French composer CHRISTIAN RENOU, aka BRUME, has developed a unique 'handwriting' style within the experimental underground, something one may call \"atmospheric Musique concrÃ¨te\". It is the marriage of many concrete sounds, hand-played acoustic instruments and electronic drones / noises that are arranged in a manner somewhat akin to a \"narrative\" - highly emotive and often evolving in a dramatic way. We are delighted to have received two tracks for the Substantia Innominata series that are simply extraordinary: expressing the wordless, indescribable oscillations arising from mental states, the qualia and conditions of two fictional 'souls', the aura of a personality. Compounded by electronics (synths), field recordings (door jarring, water), alto sax, gramophone, tapes, various processed voices, percussion, bass, home-made instruments, both 'characters' start as a rather smooth ambient pieces that develop & expand into orchestral, mysterious post-industrial entities, showing a compelling process of densification. Lim. 500 copies on lovely coloured vinyl (mixed blue, white & black), artwork by Mal Hoeschen (MULTER). DRONE RECORDS. 12,00 EURO _________________________________________________ ANDREW CHALK & TOM JAMES SCOTT 'Wild Flowers' LP Wild Flowers is the first collaborative release from Andrew Chalk and Tom James Scott and features source piano initially recorded in the development stages of Trace, a performance piece produced for 2013's F.O.N. Festival. The delicate surface of Scott's hushed piano playing is occasionally blurred by Chalk's sensitive and unique approach to production, unearthing a depth of feeling usually heard as an undercurrent to the muted, almost half-sounded surface notes. Evoking distant childhood summers, strings swell and vanish like flashes of light across a weather-beaten lens, enveloping the dampened rush of piano in a haze of elation and loss. Mastered by Denis Blackham at Skye Mastering and recorded during 2012, Wild Flowers has been cut direct to metal (DMM) and comes in a full-colour offset printed sleeve in an edition of 300 copies. 18,00 EURO ____________________________________________________________ ANDREW CHALK 'Forty-Nine Views In Rhapsodies' Wave Serene' CD Packaged in an elaborate handmade slipcase with a Japanese language obi strip. Exactly the same style as the recent \"Violin By Night\" LP, ie. super thick sturdy slipcase/box with a dowelling spine and a full colour inner sleeve. All copies handmade by Andrew Chalk. Mastered at Skye Mastering, September 2012. Faraway Press (FP021). 17,00 EURO ________________________________ PHILIP CORNER 'Piano Activities' LP alga marghen proudly presents the most iconic of all Fluxus pieces, Philip CornerÂ¹s Â³Piano ActivityÂ², in the legendary 1962 premiere performed by George Maciunas, Nam June Paik, Wolf Vostell, Emmett Williams, Ben Patterson, Dick Higgins and Alison Knowles. Until now recordings of concerts from the International Festival of the Newest Music which took place in Wiesbaden in 1962 were thoroughly unknown. This Festival, the first public event described as Fluxus, was known primarily through pictures and descriptions by the protagonists. In 2011 a tape including two versions of Philip CornerÂ¹s Â³Piano ActivitiesÂ² was found in the archive of Kuniharu Akiyama who in 1965 Maciunas declared Fluxus representative for Japan. The first of these recordings is identical to one found in 2012 in the archive of Vytautis Landsbergis, former president of Lithuania and friend of George Maciunas. Â³Piano ActivitiesÂ² represents the first ever effective realization of the anti-art art intentions of Fluxus propaganda and the performance organized by George Maciunas brought the score to its extreme consequences. When Philip Corner, who had not been present at the Wiesbaden Festum Fluxorum concerts, learned about the destruction of the piano he was at first shocked. In the tradition of John Cage, the score that Corner wrote was intended to shape something coherent out of the chaotic reservoir of sounds that he saw in the instrument and to broaden the field of possibilities for freedom in performance. But the performers by their exaggeration brought out a potential that the composer had not suspected. As the listeners of this LP will experience, the destruction gives an opening to the previously unheard-of. Two evenings from the Wiesbaden performances are presented on this LP. One take was made at the beginning of the concert series. It begins with a cluster played in the low register. There follows conventionally played passages from Paik interrupted by single notes and chords. These traditional sounds are accompanied by brutal noises such as splintering wood, scratching, tearing, crushing, rubbing, hammering, that sound at times like a bomb assault was happening, and sometimes more like an unobtrusive clattering. As this continues, improvisation makes itself heard, as the players produce the most refined dynamics, relate to each other and create collective noise landscapes. The shorter second recording is of a completely different character. Freed from the traditionalistic accompaniment this version consists of practically nothing else than hammering, sawing, rattling and clattering. As if an industrious artisanÂ¹s guild were at work, there is hardly to be noted any interaction between the players. The sound event happens in front of an exceptionally euphoric audience. The scene make one think of a hot free jazz event. First ever edition of this landmark straight-ahead anti-art Fluxus piece, issued in an edition of only 262 copies and including a 4-page large folded insert with an essay by Helmut Schmidt, inner sleeve with Â³Piano ActivitiesÂ² score and Philip Corner collages. Front sleeve design and calligraphies by Philip Corner. 21,00 EURO _______________________________________________________________ PHILIP CORNER 'Battutosso/Bone Pulse (And Other Nature Musics)' LP New release on Ricerca Sonara. Edition of 300 copies. 18,00 EURO _____________________________________________ RICHARD DAWSON 'The Glass Trunk' LP & 10INCH Housed in fold out silk screened sleeve featuring images from and inspired by the tyne & wear archives...release date 28th april ...the bold new album from Newcastle composer and outsider-artist Richard Dawson. Comprised of seven startling unaccompanied songs delivered with a peculiar intensity and way-way-off-kilter virtuosity, each interspersed with a perception-mincing couplet of electrified acoustic guitar and pedal-harp (played by the legendary Rhodri Davies), the album is a devastating, wholly idiosyncratic meditation on death and life, violence and love, memory and fog - a rousing Northumbrian song-painting like nothing else you will hear!!! Ltd. edition of 250 on ALT.VINYL. 31,00 EURO _________________________________________ *ROGER DOYLE 'The Room in the Tower' CD-R The second in the 'cinema for the ear' series - a soundtrack for an imaginary film. A horror story based around a recurring nightmare. Released by Lagan Press in January 2011 with a plain 2 page inlay card. 12,00 EURO _______________________________________ *ROGER DOYLE 'Chalant - Memento Mori' CD Music composed around intimate verbal time capsules (telephone answering machine messages from the 1980s), together with instrumental compositions evoking exotic imagined cultures. 14,00 EURO ___________________________________ KEVIN DRUMM 'Imperial Distortion' 2LP Completely remastered vinyl edition. Mastered and cut by Matt Colton at Alchemy. 'Imperial Distortion' is THE classic Kevin Drumm album alongside 'Sheer Hellish Miasma'. Deluxe triple LP gatefold.One of the most iconic ambient albums of the last decade, 'Imperial Distortion' had an extremely limited vinyl pressing a couple of years ago which some argued never quite captured the full depth and frequency range of the original material due to the way in which it was mastered. This brand new edition has long been planned by the label and has now been painstakingly remastered by Matt Colton, unveiling a filigree spectrum of microtonal flux and layers of atmosphere that were simply neglected with the previous edition. It's like surveying the same post-apocalyptic landscape without your gas mask on Mego's genre-defining 'Sheer Hellish Miasma' might have set Drumm up as America's premier exponent of grinding noise, but 'Imperial Distortion' is an entirely different beast and confirmed Drumm as one of the most important figures in the American avant garde. Unfolding over two hours of music, 'Imperial Distortion' was the post-millennial answer to Aphex Twin's seminal 'Selected Ambient Works Vol II'. But where Richard D. James created a floating world tapped into his lucid dreams, Drumm takes us into the darkest recesses somewhere deep beneath the sea with bombs and guns tearing flesh and concrete overhead. The album offers an escape; the subtle oscillations and tones thick with guilt and pregnant with disdain for a palsied society, and on headphones leave you totally paralysed. 35,00 EURO ______________________ ELEH 'Homage' 3LP BOX Presenting a unified whole, the Homage 3LP boxed set contains \"Homage to the Square Wave\", \"... Sine Wave\" and \"... Pointed Waveforms\", all out of print until now. Initially released separately in 2008, 2009 and 2012 respectively with custom letterpress jackets, this collection includes new retrospective artwork by John Brien. Each disc comes in its own one-color silkscreen jacket using the same blue, orange and green from the original editions; all housed in a rigid white satin-coated slipcase with spot varnish printing hand-numbered out of 800 on TAIGA RECORDS. Eleh, an artist who flourishes in restraint, uses a reduced sonic vocabulary to highlight delicate intricacies in a logical path toward harmonious satisfaction. The organization of hypnotic square waves, rippling sine waves and triangle/saw tooth waveforms is a discourse in the infinity, rather than the limits, of reduction. By employing a natural practice of balanced interpretation Eleh enables an individual reaction free of the clutter of white noise. 54,00 EURO ______________________________________________ ELEH 'Floating frequencies / Intuitive synthesis' 3CD \"Edition of 1000. This deluxe 3 CD set presents Floating Frequencies/Intuitive Synthesis in its completed 3 part entirety. Metallic silver print on a heavy duty matte black jacket. Intuitive Synthesis/Floating Frequencies takes full advantage of the low noise floor and clarity provided by the digital medium. Mastered by Eleh specifically for the digital environment. This box is not intended to be a replacement of the analog records but an entirely different experience.\" IMPORTANT RECORDS. 36,00 EURO _________________________________________________________________ ELEH / DUANE PITRE ' Empty Summer Endless / Feel Free Installation' LP Second edition. \"Split release including a new 20 minute piece from Eleh and the installation version of Duane Pitre's beautiful new composition, Feel Free. Screenprinted jackets. Feel Free is a new composition by Duane Pitre that currently has three possible manifestations: solo performance, group performance, and sound installation. At the core of all of them is the pillar of the work, an open yet orderly system whose intention is to produce potentially infinite variations of self-generating rhythm and melody. This system is created in part by a Max/MSP patch, designed by the composer, which consists of two (unprocessed) sound sources: guitar harmonics and simple-timbre electronic tones (in the solo/group versions, the latter are performed by the composer). Where the solo and group versions find the work following a sequence of movements (each embodying a varying feeling) that consist of different pitches and rules/methods for the group to execute them, the \"installation version\" (which occupies a side of this record) is void of any performers and is meant to embody a certain stillness. And while the listener may become familiar with what seem to be recurring patterns, no sounds are ever looped, but are rather continually moving forward, yet still remain suspended. IMPORTANT RECORDS. 20,00 EURO ___________________________________ *EHÂCO 'LÂ¹experience acousmagique' LP Les Productions Fluorescentes is happy to announce EHÂCO Â³L'ExpÃ©rience AcousmagiqueÂ², its second publication after Tonton Macoute Â³MureedilÂ². Etienne Coussirat and Emmanuel Holterbach have created six wide soundscapes made out of live electro-acoustic wizardries and field recordings, mostly conceived for live performances back in 2010 and reworked later at the Studio Fluorescent. Careful alchemists, the duo aims to reach a transmutation of sound and time matter, building large soundscapes of frequencies from many sources such as daily objects, home-made or traditional instruments, mutant electronics, machine and animal voices. Is your body getting melted in telluric vibrations? Has your clock stopped? Does time seem to get stuck or flow in reverse? This is normal, thatÂ¹s what the experimental music of EHÂCO is about. Acousmagic music if thereÂ¹s one ! Etienne Coussirat is a musician who builds impossible musical instruments and practices electro-acoustic improvisation. His work focuses on auditory perception and exploration of acoustic phenomena. Emmanuel Holterbach is composer of musique concrete, sound artist and plays enharmonic glasses with Orbes. He presents his kaleidoscopic sound environments, performances and concerts in Europe, Canada and China since 1992. LP record privately issued by EHÂCO via their Les Productions Fluorescentes in an edition limited to 300 copies. 21,00 EURO _______________________________________________ FACTRIX / CONTROL UNIT 'Elegy for rusted Souls' LP Backwards proudly presents the return of legendary FACTRIX together with new cult hero CONTROL UNIT! After their last release from 1982, the seminal \"California Babylon\", San Francisco industrial pioneers Factrix are back with a new studio album, recorded together with Italian duo Control Unit (whose critically acclaimed debut \"The Fugitives\" was released on Backwards last year). The quartet formed by Bond Bergland, Cole Palme, Silvia Kastel and Ninni Morgia moulds a new language of industrial music with guitars, bass and electronics, resulting in a fusion of acoustic and electric elements, primitive rhythms patterns and even blues. On top sits the ghostly, sexy, no-waveish voice of Silvia Kastel. The LP was recorded in Spring 2012 at the Factrix studio in Berkeley, CA and later mixed by Silvia Kastel and Bond Bergland, then mastered by Scott Colburn in Seattle. Fans of classic industrial music, Throbbing Gristle, post punk, Confusion Is Sex era Sonic Youth will feel at home with this album, but it will also satisfy those who love the most extreme avantgarde experiments in music. The first pressing of the record will be accompanied by a limited edition 7\" with bonus tracks. Edition of 500 copies on Italian label Backwards. 22,00 EURO _________________________________________ FERIAL CONFINE (Andrew Chalk) 'Meiosis' CD A debut release on CD of the second part of the trilogy of recordings by Ferial Confine dating back to 1985. Here sensitively remastered by Denis Blackham from the original master tapes at Skye Mastering and with a beautiful facsimile mini LP style sleeve, made in Japan. Meiosis was initially published via the Broken Flag label in England in late 1985 on C60 cassette and deleted shortly afterwards, although there appeared some copies in circulation. In view of the high sonic range of much of Meiosis, it was clear that a duplicated cassette was an inferior release format- already in that period when CD was not really yet familiar. Even though 28 years' is perhaps a lengthy wait, Siren Records is pleased to finally present a fully remastered version of Meiosis on CD. It follows the same production quality of the initial release The Full Use Of Nothing, and Meiosis forms the bridge between that and the subsequent album First, Second And Third Drop (released in 2007 on CD). Amidst the chaos of the first two albums appears a sense of order and melodic structure that is already strongly established by the close of Meiosis. Early experimentation in acoustic percussion and primitive multi-tracking techniques shaped the sound and spirit of these formative recordings, somehow very tentative but leading to an on-going fascination with subtle shifts in balance and nuances of sound within a limited palette, albeit in a wild and free series of performances here. As the second part of the projected Siren re-issue trilogy ;'The Full Use Of Nothing' (1985), 'Meiosis' (1985) and 'First, Second And Third Drop' (1986), the primitive energy and somehow primeval expression of the first two albums is a vital key to the distinct changes and subsequent refinement that would follow afterwards and contains the pure essence of the project, from a different period almost 30 years past. Meiosis is in an edition of 500 copies with Japanese language obi and features the original reproduced artwork by Andrew Chalk for the album. The CD was manufactured by in Japan. Layout by Magda Stepien, translations by Daisuke Suzuki. SIREN RECORDS 022 15,00 EURO _______________________________________________________ FERIAL CONFINE (Andrew Chalk)'The Full Use Of Nothing' CD A timely and welcome reissue of the first part of the trilogy of recordings by Ferial Confine dating back to 1985 on SIREN RECORDS (Siren 021). Here sensitively remastered by Denis Blackham from the original master tapes at Skye Mastering and with a beautiful facsimile mini LP style sleeve, made in Japan. The Full Use Of Nothing was the first serious publication of music by Andrew Chalk/Ferial Confine on cassette in the mid-eighties. Early experimentation in acoustic percussion and primitive multi-tracking techniques shaped the sound and spirit of these formative recordings, somehow very tentative but leading to an on-going fascination with subtle shifts in balance and nuances of sound within a limited palette, albeit in a wild and free series of performances here. As the first part of the projected Siren re-issue trilogy ; 'The Full Use Of Nothing' (1985), 'Meiosis' (1985) and 'First, Second And Third Drop' (1986), the primitive energy and somehow primeval expression of the first album is a vital key to the distinct changes and subsequent refinement that would follow afterwards and contains the pure essence of the project, from a different period almost 30 years past. It is therefore fitting this being the first part of the trilogy. The Full Use Of Nothing is in an edition of 500 copies with Japanese language obi and features the original reproduced artwork by Andrew Chalk for the album. The CD was manufactured by in Japan. Layout by Magda Stepien, translations by Daisuke Suzuki. 16,00 EURO _______________________ GOL 'Goose Vibrations' LP The quartet recorded this ode to nature and lust in his isolated Gol-farm studio or in its surrounding fields of the beautiful but severe sylvian region of the Morvan. Hence the moisture of the early morning of the countryside summer of 2008 that irrigates string based ballads titillated by the ethereal voice of the next door neighborsÂ¹ young daughter. Hence the stormy wind blowing a tense energy to other more radical tunes. \"SchizoÃ¯d electronic avant-folk with pop hints\" may be easily chosen to satisfy the taxonomy but, to put it simple, the 11 tracks of Â³Goose VibrationsÂ² are merely sincere and provoke a rare and invigorating inner joy. Issued by GOL Records & CoopÃ©rative des Arts Fermiers. Beware, Pan might be hidden inside your speakers! 21,00 EURO ____________ GOL '??? ' LP ??? [anshin-on] is an electronic threnody in two parts: \"Het Wonder\" and \"Het Wonder!\".The ref. 06 on Gol Records echoes the leaking reactor 06 of the Fukushima plant.The two long tracks are improvised on home-made electronic instruments and thus thoroughly primitive. With this \"awkward musique concrÃ¨te\", Gol searches for a state of \"hear/heal\", a music that stands for a post-nuclear shamanistic ritual for the irradiated days to come. May ??? help you face a darker future ! Issued by GOL Records & CoopÃ©rative des Arts Fermiers. 21,00 EURO ___________________________________ *GOL / GHEDALIA TAZARTES 'Alpes' LP The sixth Gollaberration features a rather odd encounter indeed! It all happened when matchless vocalist Ghedalia Tazartes challenged GOL dada-style quartet. Ghedalia threw in the game his pan-africanasian singing techniques blending gypsy, jewish and trans-continental flavor. GOL exceeded on Electric Mandoline, JewÂ¹s Harps, Percussions, Janotron, Flutes, Electric Guitar, Bass Guitar, Electronic Garage and Voice. Together with Ghedalia they developed into what became a \"bal musette\" for mentally disabled. Reaching at some points the sides of rock that doesn't roll, this sonic attack jumps from topic to topic as a ritualistic anthology of unknown \"ritournelles\". Such a decadence was hardly contained in the neutral environment of the Swiss Cultural Center in Paris where the recording took place on Feb 22nd and 23rd, 2011. Tired liver resonances accurately rendered by the acid yellow cover created by Dennis Tyfus of Ultra Eczema. A mountain peaks journey below the very heart of no-where Europe to be consumed gently without skis on. One-time pressing edition limited to 400 copies on PLANAM. 21,00 EURO _____________________________________________ *GOL / MIK QUANTIUS / DAVE NUSS 'Bruxelles' LP Drinking Belgian beer in a moisty cellar after an exhausting night might be the best situation to jump on the instruments that surround you and gig over and over again until you barely find the way to gather your legs together and improve the tricky exercise of wasted walking. This is what seems to have happened that frozen night of September 19th, 2009 when Dave Nuss (No Neck Blues Band, Sabbath Assembly) wrung from his Amolvacy concert and accompanied by mate Mik Quantius (Embryo) accepted GOLÂ¹s perverse invitation to pursue the darkness of Brussels abusing of the aforementioned liquid. Warped and deep bass lines support the disturbed vocalisms and spontaneous words of Mister Quantius shaped by a shamanistic percussive Nuss while the crispy electronics and whatsoever instruments by the french GOL combo reach out for a \"blues\" extravaganza that says it all with lyrics such as \"I have sex on Christmas\" or \"Tomorrow maybe not\". Gollaboration No.5, recorded at 2 am by Yann Leguay. LP cover and insert with drawings by Mattia Denisse giving a hint of this twisted and skittish psychedelic must have. One-time pressing edition limited to 300 copies on PLANAM. 21,00 EURO __________________________________ *TWIG HARPER 'New Lost Knowns' LP In the beginning of what exactly was this beginning that has remained one of the mysteries ever since? In this beginning the year might or might not be 2011 and the whole practice could still be in-process now (though we firmly reject the meaning of the meaning as an open forma s we consider it more a time-binding). It is doubtful if this sonic process would have ever evolved beyond the animal stage suspended as it is in a fragile balance between sounding familiar to the nervous system and unfamiliar and alien. This process is wholly dependant upon the integrity of the system and its necessary environmentÂ an extermination program created by working multiple channels, reducing mixes, removing sections, adding segments, layering inversions under continual growths and constant changes, until we can no longer recognize the original source or process itself.

In a comfortable atmosphere and with a minimum of preparation, the two artists endeavored to find common musical ground through their shared interests in sample manipulation, layering the texture and improvisation. Some months later Ielasi auditioned the recordings and then mixed down his favorite passages. To a few of these selections Pekler then added an overdub or an edit, but for the most part Â³Holiday for SamplesÂ² is a document of real-time interaction. The title Â³Holiday for SamplerÂ² and the holiday resort names of the individual track titles (Side A: Yalta / Ribadeo / Parghelia / Neringa. Side B: Vegas / Olgino / Oga / Yallingup / Maly Losjin) are an oblique reference to both the pleasures of leisure travel and to the interplay of the familiar and the foreign, themes at the center of IelasiÂ¹s and PeklerÂ¹s artistic practice.

Trash rock n roll of fame monuments, giant mutant cats, the three stooges loop-played on a small TVÂthe perfect vibe to play some exotica from outer space. 50's tweed amps, up stand bass, trumpet, various percussion, all kinds of weird toys were involved in the exciting session we did with Ju Suk & Rock n Roll Jackie, truly and inspiring (and inspired) experience we got to do. 180gr vinyl limited to 250 copies on ALTVINYL. 17,00 EURO _____________________ MAIN 'Ablation' LP / CD Recorded at Thirst, GRM Studio 116B and Schwebung.

Frames by Grebo Gray. Layout by David Coppenhall. Cut and mastered by Rashad Becker @ Dubplates and Mastering. There has been a recent surge in activity from Robert Hampson, with all manner of solo Recordings and performances popping up. Its only logical that he reactivates his beloved Main project. As we all know, Main laid the foundations during the 1990s for much of love of abstract guitar treatments in electronic music throughout the 2000s. Hampson has teamed up with Stephan Mathieu to create a stunning new album. On 'Ablation', Mathieu adds extra tonal colour and an obscure rhythmic palette to Hampson's exacting treatments and detailed use of layered concrÃ¨te sounds to create an emotionally charged and fascinating work. Old fans of Main will not be disappointed, and neither will new followers of experimental audio. Packaged with images by Grebo Gray with layout by Dave Coppenhall, and expertly mastered and cut by Rashad Becker, 'Ablation' is a highlight for the spring 2013 season. Editions Mego.

This new edition also includes the Centre Pompidou 16-page program as well as a copy of the now sold out Bullshit Detector magazine published by Fondazione Mudima in 2001 on the occasion of the Walter Marchetti installation in their art space. Â³De Musicorum infelicitateÂ² (i.e., Â³The Unhappiness of MusicÂ²), or Â³Ten Pieces in the Form of Painful VariationsÂ² dispose in their unceasing and implacable sequence the landing at an anaphorical finis terrae, the extreme and impassable threshold, beyond which music can but sink in the abyss of its own loss of consciousness, in front of the horizon of the definitive loss of its exhausted tradition. Â³De musicorum infelicitateÂ², anamnesis of the condition of music, a barren aesthetic code ineluctably suspended between self-mystification and expression of the inauthentic, having reached the limit of its own fertility and every faculty of the imagination. Â³De musicorum infelicitateÂ², longing for a magniloquent destructio musicae, the destruction of an administrated practice, of a tautological exercise devoid of inner necessity. As Gabriele Bonomo, the project coordinator of the complete Walter Marchetti editions for Alga Marghen, remarks in the liner notes, music has been reduced to leading a ghostly existence, haunting the cemetery of history and frustrated by the impossibility to adhere to itself; if only music were able to recognize its own superfluity it could fulfill its destiny. While listening to these Â³Ten Pieces in the Form of Painful VariationsÂ², each one with the precise duration of six minutes, you will realize that music, this extremely dense sonority close to the pulverization limit, is talking about itself. 40,00 EURO _______________________________________________________________________ MARION, FRANZISKA & ARNULF MEIFERT 'Incredible Familiar Music - Record 1' LP Â³Our daughter Marion Myra is 13 now and in full puberty. Looking, no, listening back she canÂ¹t identify with herself as a little child doing these recordings. But I can: A childlike joy in all that is moving and sounding inspired me since many years. So from time to time we took several objects, which are not used as instruments normally like lids of pots or toys, together with regular instruments like guitar and violin, flute and drums, african balafon and indonesian metalophon, not to forget the Yamaha Porta Sound PSS-190 from the garbage pail, in short: all what was suitable for several musical family encounters. The beginning of our selection (with the tiny top on battery basis which was done after that performance) and the end of it (me playing the violin the first time in my life) already lead to Â³absolute relative musicÂ² (Die Taubnessel 8). Doing these recordings it really was Â³a childÂ¹s playÂ² for two grown-ups and a three to nine year old kid, definitely marvelous, a work of fancy. Following our subtle intuition, we just needed flair and empathy. So, I guess, equalizing the levels of sound intensity, your own noises like washing dishes or whatever, may just fit in while listening to our music. Try itÂÂ² Arnulf Meifert, Hohengebraching, 2012. Edition limited to 150 numbered issued by Die Taubnessel. + FRANZISKA & ARNULF MEIFERT 'Absolute Relative Music Â­ Record 2' LP Silence and deliberateness are luxury today. Most relevant music now is speedy and noisy, fuel and gas for the rot-machine called modern civilization. All has become a style and is designed for a special audience. Recording our musical pieces was just \"fun\", we had no intention, we will not repeat it. We had and have no ambition to be avant or post or what else. In fact I can't play violin or piano, I cannot read any notes. As a drummer, I'm an old-fashioned self-taught person and have no intention to change that at age 69. Same thing with my wife Franziska, playing guitar and flute quite a little... Our music has no concept, no plan, no composition, it's all improvised and a form of communication and, as far as that, \"primitivistic\". Music is communication, with others or oneself: You whistle in the woods or in a street at night when you're afraid, you shout with joy or squeak in your orgasm. Of course my few months with \"Faust\" 1971 were a good apprenticeship after my drumming 60ies with all kinds of jazz and soul music. Then for 35 years I had other things to do, with the exception of \"Panisches Liederbuch\" 1988 for the 50th birthday of GÃ¼nter Brus. On that afternoon in spring 2008, some years after we did Â³incredible familiar musicÂ², we had only a few hours before going to the movies. We put a very old recording machine on the table of our living-room, a tape-recorder so technically simple that you had to press the trigger all the time for moving \"fast forward\" or \"rewind\"... We began to play our first piece, then I had the idea to counterpoint it with a machine piece on Tilo Ettls apparatus and just went on with the a/b alternation of mechanical sound and unplugged music on several instruments, toys etc. till it was time to goÂ².

(Maurizio Bianchi) 'Weltanschauung' LP At the beginning of 1981 Maurizio Bianchi sent some demo tapes to the Come Organisation in England; after that, they extracted and blended together the sounds to get the final work. The title Â« Under The Victory Banner Â», an anachronistic and detrimental track for the rest of the album has been replaced by the title of the same set Â« Plutoniumetrio Â» edited in 1982 by the Come Organisation for the compilation Â« FÃ¼r Ilse Koch Â», which fits much better with the other tracks. The Come Organisation was a record label founded in London in 1979 by William Bennett, initially as a vehicle for his group Come, and later to specialise in extreme electronic or controversial music, in particular for his subsequent group Whitehouse, but also for other groups including Maurizio Bianchi, Nurse with wound or Charles Manson. When Whitehouse went on hiatus at the end of 1985, Come Organisation was dissolved. 26,00 EURO ______________________________________ M.B. (Maurizio Bianchi) 'Das Testament' LP Backwards proudly presents the reissue of a private Maurizio Bianchi vinyl LP, issued in a small edition of 300 copies in 1983 and titled \"DAS TESTAMENT\". M.B. is an Italian pioneer of noise music, born near Milan. Bianchi began to produce music in 1979, and since 1980 has used electronic equipment with the avowed goal \"to produce technological sounds and in such a way to work on complete realising of the modern decadence\". Now remastered, for this release MB plays electronics, rhythms, neutronic effects. The two suites of \"DAS TESTAMENT\" were recorded in 1982 and can be included among the most extreme and uncompromising MB recordings: Bianchi used a mixture of synthesizer parts and tape loops to create an incredibly oppressive, bleak, dark music/soundscapes, that inspires today artists from worldwide noise set. Hearing this classic recording now, you can glimpse the future insights of hundred artists in the fields of noise, industrial and experimental music.In few words, this is an essential release for all lovers of the darker and disturbing side of the electronic/noise movements. 18,00 EURO ____________ MB 'Regel' LP Reissue of the private LP, issued in an edition of 300 copies in 1982, considered one of the Maurizio Bianchi's most representative works , Â'Regel'' is finally reissued for the first time in vinyl and remastered under the supervision of the Milanese artist. The record consists of two untitled tracks. Mostly track one is made up of manipulated noises with some synthesizer or theremin phrases added for detail and contrast. The second track is a bit more focused, with less noise, more recognizable melodic content and less invasive loops. The music is unlinear and effortlessly multilayered and the sound focuses on texture rather than structure. Here you can see M.B.'s early phase as a sick, cancerous organism eating itself out. The record has been pressed on 140 gr red vinyl with black label and black inner sleeve (with inside polyethylene plastic) and comes in a deluxe black silkscreen on red cardboard sleeve with the same layout of original sleeve, limited to 199 copies w/insert in luxury 160 gr ivory paper on Urashima. 17,00 EURO ____________________________________ DANIEL MENCHE 'Marriage of metals' LP In its history throughout millennia it is fair to say the Gamelan has never had an encounter quite like this. 'Marriage of Metals' is a devastating extension of the harmonic properties found in the instruments of Indonesia. Menche was granted access to a remarkable Gamelan studio where he was given full privilege to record any and all of these rare and ancient gongs. Most notably the gigantic \"Gong Ageng\" that's contains the deepest of deep of acoustic bass. Daniel Menche took the raw source material from this Gamelan gong session and launches into a heavily processed yet surprisingly sympathetic 21st Century take on this unique instrument. 'Marriage of Metals' comprises two side long works where the purity of the sound source exists amongst the entire din. Metallic rhythms bounce alongside synthetic pops swaying from reality to fantasy, from pure acoustic tonality to fuzzed out distorted clatter. A distant feedback squall is teased amongst the foreground creating a clamorous din. Equal parts curious, engaging and groundbreaking. Menche, like Philip Corner before him extends the language of the Gamelan into brave new worlds. Out of the extensive discography of Daniel Menche \"Marriage of Metals\" stands out as his most elegant and graceful recordings yet still staying within the grit and grime of his sonic garden. This recording would not exist without the generosity of The venerable showers of beauty Gamelan ensemble located at Lewis and Clark College, Portland Oregon. Artwork for Marriage of Metals was created from renowned artist/musician: Faith Coloccia.

If anything these two short sides of primitive junk noise are even more visceral than the recently released early live works of which they share a great deal in construction.

Charlemagne Palestine, writhing in uncontrollable terror, moves to ward off the demons for the sake of the listener by howling through the void. Janek Schaefer bellies a haven, a cocoon for the listener to hide in, to grasp some semblance of life that remains and hold on to it dearly. Bells chime ominously to help dispel the haunting and are yet another stark reminder of the impending doom. What hath wrought them? What can be done against them? On this day, Charlemagne Palestine and Janek Schaefer have faced the darkness Surrounding us, traversed through the fog, waded into the murky waters, and encountered demons that have surfaced from the dark recesses of the earth. Herein lies the hope that was gained through facing the horror that was left unchained.

The gatefold sleeve is silkscreened in one color and presents a signed drawing by Charlemagne Palestine on the front cover. In 1973 Charlemagne Palestine was commissioned to make \"Four Manifestations On Six Elements\" by the Sonnabend Gallery in New York. As the gallery was well known for its presentation of conceptual art Palestine decided to create a record similar to an exhibition space with four walls to expose on, each wall corresponding to a side on a double LP record. \"Two Perfect Fifths, A Major Third Apart, Reinforced Twice\" (1973) is an electronic piece that deals with the search for the essence of timbre, sound color, through exploration of the inert chemical activity in the overtone series of tone fundamentals. In this genre of his work Palestine feels akin to a kind of sound alchemy - blending elements over and over again through the years searching for the Golden Sound - the essence of the chord or harmonic structure itself. In \"One + Two + Three Perfect Fifths, In The Rhythm 3 Against 2, for Piano\" (1973) the elements introduced are now elaborated upon on the piano. The resonant BÃ¶sendorfer allows Palestine to create a more lively and complex variation of tones, intervals, overtones and rhythms. \"One Fifth\" evolves by reinforcing the fundamentals of a fifth with their higher octave. Each performance of this work is different as Palestine reinterprets these simple elements listening within them for variations of amplitude, mixture and inertia at the moment of the performance. \"One + Two Fifths\" deals with the way a rhythmic sonority sounds when the sustain pedal of the piano in not used, thus focusing on its rhythmic aspect. Gradually by adding the sustain pedal the external rhythmic pattern begins to internalize becoming an inert part of the whole timbral fabric - a piece expressing the battle of rhythm versus timbre for dominance. In \"One + Two + Three\" a third fifth is added - variations of melody and sonority reinforcements culminating in a rhythmic deceleration process ending the work. \"Sliding Fifths for Piano\" (1972) is an impressionistic version of the three fifths used in the entire work. The continuous liquid waterfall of pure romantic piano sound and color is a homage to Debussy, Ravel and Monet. \"Three Perfect Fifhts, A Major Second Apart, Reinforced Twice\" (1973) is the continuation of wall one. A pure and sonorous phenomenon. Edition limited to 180 signed and numbered copies in silkscreened gatefold sleeve, with an original drawing by Charlemagne Palestine on the front cover. 150,00 EURO ________________________________________________________________ *CHARLEMAGNE PALESTINE + Z'EV 'Rubhitbangklanghear Rubhitbangklangear' LP / 2CD Second time in 20 years Palestine and Z'ev are performing together.

Very few copies available for distribution here, including a double CD anthology with both historical recordings taken from the Â³Early WorksÂ² (issued some years ago by alga marghen), from Â³370 FliesÂ² CDs (an art multiple also issued by alga marghen and long sold out) as well as the first digital version of the no longer available LP titled Â³A Fluxus ElegyÂ² and the previously unpublished track Â³AntsÂ². The first CD starts with the first ever recording of Â³AntsÂ² (1960), one of Ben Patterson first graphic scores, pre-dating the Fluxus group. Also included in this CD are two essential 1961 documents: Â³Duo For Voice And A String InstrumentÂ² and Â³Variations for Double-bassÂ², both recorded in concert at the Galerie Parnass in 1962; this event has special historic significance in that it included the first public presentation by George Maciunas of his Fluxus manifesto and plans for the Wiesbaden Fluxus Festival. Two more tracks titled Â³Paper PieceÂ²(1960), the work that cut the umbilical cord to all of the author's previous classical and contemporary musical training and experience, and Â³PondÂ² (1962), a piece that reminds of Richard Maxfield's electronic music with voice collage, see the collaboration of Philip Corner, Walter Marchetti and Davide Mosconi. The second CD includes more recent works as Â³A Simple OperaÂ² (1995), a repetitive hommage to Emmett Williams on his 70th birthday, also recorded in collaboration with Philip Corner, Walter Marchetti and Davide Mosconi; Â³370 FliesÂ² (2003) for electronic loops and voice; as well as Â³A Fluxus ElegyÂ² (2006), previously issued on Alga Marghen's VocSon LP series and based on the basic principles of the polyphonic music of the Bantu tribes of West and Central Africa, applied to the initials of artists listed in Â³Fluxus: The Most Radical and Experimental Art Movement of the SixtiesÂ², through encoding them in basic International Morse Code. Starting as a virtuoso double-bass performer of classical music, Ben Patterson was one of the very first founders of the Fluxus Group in Wiesban. This large book will introduce you to some American neo-avantgarde music classics, a crossover between John Cage exploding influences and the experimental art atmosphere of the early 1960s in Europe. 38,00 EURO ______________________________ *ELIANE RADIGUE \"Adnos I-III\" 3CD Eliane Radigue's Adnos trilogy was composed between 1973 and 1980 and is among her finest compositions.

It is amazing that she could build such formidably organic sonic edifices in her home studio with the primitive machines given to her by Pierre Henry: three tape recorders, a mixing board, an amplifier, two loudspeakers and a microphone. Eliane previously worked for him at the Studio d'Essai of the R.T.F. from 1955 to 1957, after having met Pierre Schaeffer almost by chance who invited her to learn the techniques of Musique ConcrÃ¨te. Created 10 years after her Studio dÂ¹Essai experience, the Feedback works of Eliane Radigue immediately take a new direction from the explorations of Musique ConcrÃ¨te. Her adventure is intuitively going towards flux, towards contemplative stasis - a music of continuous sounds, of apparently simple structures, which permits the revelations and expansion of rich acoustic phenomena. It is as if her musical work was in some way a martial artÂ as if she meditated for 10 years before striking the first blow, with an impressive precision! This is the context in which Eliane composed Â³OmnhtÂ² in 1970 for the architectonic spaces of the visual artist Tania Mouraud titled Â³One More NightÂ², presented at the Gallery of the Rive Gauche in Paris; Â³UsralÂ² (the title comes from a phonetic compression of ultrasounds slowed-down, in French Â³ultra-sons ralentisÂ²), one of the first works by Eliane Radigue to be given in public as sound environment for a sculpture by Marc Halpern in the Salon des Artistes DÃ©corateurs at the Grand Palais of Paris in 1969; Â³Stress-OsakaÂ², conceived when the artist was invited to create a sonic environment for the International Fair in Osaka in 1970. There is no doubt that Eliane Radigue vocabulary is based on observing and entering into dialog with the fundamental behaviour of sounds: pulsing, beating, sustained, very light, a subtle and delicate evolution. When she moved from feedback sounds to the ARP synthesizer she naturally continued the same music. A continuity where the original use of feedback sounds stands out for its cruder and more savage inner character. One could say that somehow itÂ¹s the very texture of the sounds, which leads the form of her compositions. At the same time this approach favors an intense sensuality in the listening. Edition of 300 copies also including a 16-page LP-size booklet with original photos, scores and liner notes. 23,00 EURO ______________________________ ELIANE RADIGUE 'Vice-Versa, EtcÂ' LP alga marghen very proudly presents a remastered version of Â³Vice-Versa, EtcÂÂ² LP originally included in the first 400 copies of the now sold out Eliane Radigue Â³Feedback WorksÂ² 2LP.

During this period, \"Transamorem - Transmortem\" was presented along with other compositions by Eliane Radigue in a linear mode of listening, although the piece had originally been conceived, during its composition, as a sound installation. Of course, both modes of listening are possible, and each works marvelously in its own way. In their original form, Eliane Radigue's works are magnetic tapes. After being played a few times in public, the tape disappears to its case until a release proposal makes it available again through a disc. During this period Eliane Radigue's compositions became fairly long, some lasting over an hour. Because the tracks could not be edited for some obvious reasons, a vinyl release was unthinkable. It was only in the 90's, with the advent of the CD format, that the long compositions of Eliane Radigue were made available (with the exception of the \"Song of Milarepa\" LP on Lovely Music, a work already divided into multiple movements and thus able to be fit onto two sides of an LP). For these reasons, the work of Eliane Radigue remained virtually unknown for twenty years - from the 70's to the 90's. It was in 2004, when she accepted my aid in digitizing her archives, along with Lionel Marchetti, that I discovered \"Transamoren - Transmortem.\" Immediately, I was awed by the majestic grace of this very long tangle of frequencies, this set of seemingly unchanging tones, whose variations are of a delicate subtlety. \"Transamoren - Transmorten\" is recognizable as one of the most radical of Radigue's compositions, comparable to the first \"Adnos\", the work that follows \"Transamorem - Transmortem\" chronologically. Very few transformations, an apparent formal aridity that is then contradicted by the physical play of the frequencies as the listener turns his head gently from right to left, or better yet as the listener moves slowly throughout the music space. Moving through zones of specific frequencies, the listener's body experiences localized zones of low, medium and treble frequencies which vary according to the acoustic properties of the space. Very well-organized, Eliane Radigue's archives are a pleasure to explore, and \"Transamorem - Transmortem\"'s case contained a mine of information. What excited me most was the short text entitled \"Inner Space\", which described the ideal conditions under which \"Transamorem - Transmortem\" should be presented. That is to say as a sound installation. \"Inner Space - This monophonic tape should be played on 4 speakers placed in the four corners of an empty room. Carpet on the floor. The impression of different points of origin of the sound is produced by the localization of the various zones of frequencies, and by the displacements produced by simple movements of the head within the acoustic space of the room. A low point of light on the ceiling, in the center of the room, produced by indirect lighting. Several white light projectors of very weak intensity whose rays, coming from different angles, meet at a single point\".

Original magnetic tape, size 6/25, 19 cm/s, mastered by Lionel Marchetti, autumn 2012. 'The performance of PSI 847 is about to begin. Once again, Radigue has employed one of her favoured sound dissemination tricks: directing the banks of loudspeakers not toward the audience, but toward the buildingThe soundboard is at the rear of the house, and Marchetti will be playing the tapes from there. Radigue is in a seat, like any other audience member. There will be nothing to see, no one on stage, no visual distractions. But what happens when you listen to this music? What sensations, feelings or thoughts emerge? Obviously, any drone-based music generates, first of all, a physical experience You must give in, abandon yourself, forget about trying to figure out whether three minutes or an hour have elapsed. This is truly an experience of slowness. A rare moment for which you must prepare, and be in the right condition (no need to meditate, or try to achieve a trance state, either: a little concentration will suffice!) Once you've accepted the loss of physical bearings, you can then attempt to grasp Radigue's compositional talent: locating motifs that modulate and transform at varying intervals; appreciating the evolution, the appearance of a new movement, or, as in the case of PSI 847, the insensible dissolution of the music.'

He began a professional career in dance, theatre, cinema, while still giving some occasional concerts and publishing a few albums, each one of them an acclaimed masterpiece. Recorded in 1989 and originally released by Aaya in 1990, Check Point Charlie is the first work by TazartÃ©s conceived for the compact disc format and its different time boundaries. The result is a sixty-minute long collection of layered field recordings combined into a polyphonic ceremony filled by his typical multi-tracked vocals, between a gibberish scream and the muezzin's call to prayers. A unique record that - after almost 25 years - it's finally enjoyable with the depth of sound that only a vinyl release can give.

The box includes: 12 high quality prints reproducing etchings by visual artist Rolf Zander Â each image corresponds with a track on the CD. The box further holds three prints with sketches and texts by Rolf Zander about his style of etching and the composition of the visual works. Finally there is a text print giving track info for the CD and an essay on the project by Kai U. JÃ¼rgens. Handnumbered 300 copies. The collaboration between Rolf Zander and Asmus Tietchens is very special indeed. Zander was TietchensÂ music teacher at school. He can be heard on some of the tracks on the Adventures In Sound CD of early experiments that came with the reissue of NachtstÃ¼cke on Die Stadt. Tarpenbek is now the realization of a project that has been long in the making and planning. It all started with a series of etchings by Rolf Zander that he made in the 1970ies. These etchings deal with the structures and topographical features of the small north german river ÂTarpenbek\". The series of images is very reduced minimal and interwoven with textures on the original material. Tietchens took each of these etchings as a starting point for a musical composition, taking ideas about structure and layers from the images. Ony in one instance field recordings from the riverbanks of the Tarpenbek were incorporated. At most instances the music is as minimal as the visual works. Full of details and small surprising turns. aufabwegen is really proud to present these works together with high quality prints of the etchings by Rolf Zander and a CD with 47 minutes of new music from Asmus Tietchens. 42,00 EURO ________________________ Asmus TIETCHENS 'SoirÃ©e' CD 'SoirÃ©e is the reslt of extended recycling. Beginning from the investigation of : what will happen if I recycle (not remix) some of my older compositions and then recycle the recyclings and then recycle the recycled recyclings ad infinitum ? Quite quickly the initial pieces vanished totally. New structures and sounds emerged depending on the methods and tools I used. Each of the pieces on SoirÃ©e is based on a distinct composition of my musical past. In each case the listener is presented with the 10th 'generation' of this recycling process. Confronted with the variety of the results I ask myself : Is it really necessary to create further new electronic msic if only one piece as a nucleus is sufficient to derive hundreds and hundreds of different distinct individual variants ?'

The Ensemble performs playing large sheets of metal and producing amazingly droning sounds. These live recordings are the result of an evolutionary refinement of instrumental design and playing techniques which Robert Rutman explored and develped after a ten year period of practice. He invented the two only instruments played by the Steel Cello Ensemble: the Bow Chime - a six foot sheet of steel formed into a horizontal curve with an iron bar attached to the top corners of the metal sheet - and the Single String Cello - an eight foot sheet suspended vertically from a stand.

In their own quiet way, these silences speak volumes: they are performative, political, critical, abstract, poetic, cynical, technical, absurdÂ They can be intended as a memorial or a joke, a special offer, or something entirely undefined. The carefully chosen silences of this anthology are intrinsically linked to the medium of reproduction itself and reveal it's nude materiality. They expose their medium in all its facets and imperfections, including the effect of time and wear. At the most basic level, these silences are surfaces. And it is in their materiality that they distinguish themselves from the conceptual experiments of John Cage with \"4'33\". From the 1950s silence has found a place in the economic structure of the record industry and since then it would increasingly be appropriated by a vast array of artists is a vast array of contexts. Indeed, the silent tracks seems to know no boundaries. The LP presents the silences as they were originally recorded, preserving any imperfection that the hardware conferred upon the enterprise, without banning the possibility to satisfying the ear. The liner notes provide historical background for each track, revealing the stated (or presumed) motivations for these silences, while providing novel sound correspondences or interferences. This album is meant to be played loud (or not), at any time, in any place: a true aural experience! Only 250 copies available for distribution, in gatefold iconic sleeve. 23,00EURO ______________________________ CHRIS WATSON 'El tren fantasma' CD \"Take the ghost train from Los Mochis to Veracruz and travel cross country, coast to coast, Pacific to Atlantic.

A Radio programme was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Saturday 30 Oct, 2010, produced by Sarah Blunt, and described as \"a thrilling acoustic journey across the heart of Mexico from Pacific to Atlantic coast using archive recordings to recreate a rail passenger service which no longer exists. It's now more than a decade since FNM operated its last continuous passenger service across country. Chris Watson spent a month on board the train with some of the last passengers to travel this route. As sound recordist he was part of the film crew working on a programme in the BBC TV series Great Railways Journeys. Now, in this album, the journey of the 'ghost train' is recreated, evoking memories of a recent past, capturing the atmosphere, rhythms and sounds of human life, wildlife and the journey itself along the tracks of one of Mexico's greatest engineering projects.

Debuting in 1984 with the album, Camouflage Heart,itself representing a break from Gordonâ s background via it being an excurion to more abstract sonic realms, Cindytalk has remained a going concern ever since. Despte a short break in releases between 1994 and 2003, Cindytalk have enjoyedrenewed interest and activity in more recent years via the support of some highly sought-after album releases on Editios Mego and regular live performances in the UK and throughout Europe. his is not the first time Cindytalk has collaborated with LTCo founder Richo, either. In 1991, Cindytalk appeared on Richoâs other label, Fourth Dimension Records, with a song on a split-7â (featuring Splintered on the other side) issued with Grim Humour ma, plus joined his group, Theme, for one song onstage at the 2010 editio of the Wroclaw Industrial Festival.

In his quest to expand his solo piano expression, Robert employs twodistinct yet complimentary approaches to piano composition. The first is base on shifting patterns - repetitive structures with minimal development. The second is a more organic approach which evolves out of unmediated imrovisation. Along the way, Robert has created compositions that ae vital, exposed, melancholic, minimal and open-ended that never stray oo far away from a unique melodic sensibility. Strange and Secret Thing', comprised of 17 tracks, is a further continuation of the journey exploredin the first two parts. It is the most intimate and powerful of the trilogy - with a wider palette of light and shade, emotion, texture an atmosphere. This album is a must for anyone who has enjoyed the first two pats of the trilogy and his older legendary recordings on Le Rey Records. It wll appeal to those who have an affinity with the piano language of Satie, lass, Budd, Cage, Max Richter etc. The album was mastered by Denis Blacham at Skye Mastering. As with the first two parts the CD comes with a limited edition hand-made miniature jacket sleeve + Japanese Obi designed by Faraway Press. 17,00 EUR ------------------------------------------------------------------ *HUMAN GREED 'Fortress Longing' CD The eagerly anticipated fouth album from Human Greed â FORTRESS LONGING: the internal campaign for th sa"
