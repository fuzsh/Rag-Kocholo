Bertrand came along soon after on rhythm guitar. They fancied themselves a surf-guitar act in the model of the Ventures and eventually evolved to include Beach Boys material with vocals with Bertrand being replaced by Claude Levesque. After doing a three-day stint in the parking lot of a Pont-Viau supermarket to entertain shoppers, they were encouraged to get more serious. They managed one 7″ single in English called “They Said”. with notes from Andre Gibeault and Leo Roy.\n\nSingles\n\n1966 C’est Ma Vie/Le Vrai Bonheur (Première) PRE-827\n\n1966 They Said/Born In Chicago (Télédisc) TD-43\n\n1967 Donne-Moi Ton Amour / S’Il Faut Un Homme (RCA Victor Canada International) 57-5770\n\n1967 Reviens, Reviens/Un Amour Compliqué (RCA Victor Canada International) 57-5797\n\n1968 Machin La Chose/La Mer (RCA Victor Canada International) 57-5823\n\n451°\n\nDan Lowe (guitar) / Hal Whitford (vocals) / Roydon Morice (bass; replaced Walker) / Jim Clench (bass; replaced Morice) / Brad Steckler (guitar, vocals; replaced Barre & Whitford) / Steve Nelson (drums)\n\nFollowing the evolution of Calgary band Shades Of Blond into 49th Parallel and then into Painter, a number of line-up changes and an aborted album on Randy Bachman’s Molten Records led members Dorn Beattie and Dan Lowe to reform the act as Hammersmith. Hammersmith managed two albums for Mercury – ‘Hammersmith’ (1974) and ‘It’s For You’ (1976). Mercury dropped the band in 1977 but, Hammersmith stayed together until the end of 1977. In 1978 Lowe and Whitford went to Edmonton and recorded five tracks at Sundown Recorders with hired guns Bob Walker (bass), Bob Ego (drums), and Norman Durkee (Bette Midler) on piano and Martin Barre (Jethro Tull) on guitar. Two of the tracks made it onto an eponymous LP under the name 451° which also contained more tracks from an entirely different version of the band including Hammersmith’s Roydon Morice. Morice didn’t stay long and was replaced by April Wine bassist Jim Clench (via BTO). Hal Whitford was also replaced by former Whitewolf vocalist/guitarist Brad Steckler whom Lowe had worked with as a producer. After the failure of the album to gain any traction, Lowe and Steckel would form Prototype featuring Doug Riley on lead vocals. with notes from Bill Munson, Dave Buerster, and Bob Walker.\n\nSingles\n\n1980 China/Santa Ana Wind (Intercan/Pickwick) CAN-10012\n\n1980 I’ve Got The Power/It’s Alright (Intercan/Pickwick) CAN-10020\n\n1981 Don’t Walk/Fastest Guns In Town (Intercan/Pickwick) CAN-10023\n\n1981 Checkpoint Charlie/Everybody Loves A Hero (Intercan/Pickwick) CAN-10024\n\nAlbums\n\n1980 451° (Intercan/Pickwick) ICI-009\n\n45’s, The\n\nDon Love (guitar, vocals) / Gerald Beeston (drums, percussion) / Rob Ciccone (guitar, vocals) / Patrick Flynn (bass, vocals)\n\nFrom Toronto, Ontario.\n\nAlbums\n\n1981 On The Beach [6-song 12” EP] (Satellite) ST-48121\n\n49 ACRES\n\nR.

With a stifling and musically limiting Calgary club scene they were never able to get farther than having one single – 1966’s “All Your Love”. The tune would eventually pop up on a (now rare) 4 song EP next to an early incarnation of The Stampeders. As members came and went a name change was introduced as 49th Parallel and over the course of a year a solid line-up developed featuring Abbott, Lowe, Carlson, Petch, Woodhouse and Bare. The group released three singles on Gaeity Records between mid-1967 and late spring of 1968 which were all licensed to other labels for wider distribution, at which time Petch and Woodhouse left and Dave Downey was added as bassist and Velker was added on organ to replace Petch. Throughout 1968 and parts of 1969 they toured throughout North America with an ever fluctuating roster. Despite these shake ups, they did hit and run recording sessions which bore several singles for Venture Records including “Twilight Woman” that managed seven weeks on the CHUM charts with a peak position of #16 in April 1969, and its follow-up, “Now That I’m A Man”, in September 1969 which managed a modest 3 week ride on the CHUM charts and a peak position of No.22. Velker left shortly thereafter to go to Hollywood. A full-length album was hastily assembled from singles and studio outtakes because the line-up was continually fluctuating and new recordings were impossible to conduct. This would be compounded by the immediate departure of singer Dennis Abbott following the album’s release. Enter Dorn Beattie, who, along with Lowe, and Petch’s replacement Dennis Mundy, Downey and Bare began working on another album in 1970 which was never completed, though the single, “I Need You”, did surface (and failed to chart). Eventually the band changed its name to Painter and released one album before mutating into the hard rock act Hammersmith who would finally succumb in the late ’70’s after two albums on Mercury Records. Beattie went on to create All The Rage In Paris, but that too faltered when co-founding keyboardist Doug Johnson quit to form Loverboy. Beattie, in recent years, is now a successful country singer; Lowe continued on with a new version of Painter, 451 Degrees, and Prototype (who also recorded an album). He produced albums by Qwest, Whitewolf, George Fox, Amin Bhatia, and would also be responsible for the invention of the studio production technique called Q-Sound (used by such luminaries as Pink Floyd and Madonna) . 49th Parallel found a mild revival in the mid-90’s on classic rock radio in the prairies, prompting Pacemaker Records to issue a ‘best of’ collection’. with notes from Bill Munson, Jack Velker.\n\nSingles\n\n1967 Labourer/You Do Things (RCA Victor Canada International) 57-3428\n\n1968 She Says/Citizen Freak (RCA Victor Canada International) 57-3447\n\n1968 You Do Things/ (RCA Victor – US) 47-9293\n\n1968 Blue Bonnie Blue/Missouri (Gaiety) 612X\n\n1969 Twilight Woman/Close The Barn Door (Venture/Quality) 1004X\n\n1969 Now That I’m A Man/ (Maverick/Venture/Quality) 1011X\n\n1970 I Need You/Goodtime Baby (Barry/Quality) 3518X\n\nAlbums\n\n1969 49th Parallel (Maverick/Venture/Quality) MAS-7001\n\n1995 The Best of 49th Parallel (Pacemaker) PACE-019\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1969 “Citizen Freak”, “Labourer”, “You Do Things”, and “She Says” on “The Best of the Greatest” (Birchmount) BM-535\n\n1999 “Citizen Freak” on ‘Best Of Gaiety Records’ (Pacemaker)\n\nas SHADES OF BLOND\n\n1966 “All Your Love” on ‘International Master Discovery Records’ [7″] (IMDR) NU-19661\n\n4th FLOOR\n\nJimmy Kwan (synths) / James Maxwell (drums) / Tim Graham (bass) / Stephen Maxwell (guitar)\n\nYoung Vancouver band who performed electro dance with gothic pop overtones.

They were initially an all-instrumental band like England’s The Shadows when The Beatles changed their outlook and they began incorporating vocals into their repertoire. Teen dances in local venues got them the attention of Doc Steen at radio station CKRC who promoted their shows endlessly. They became a fixture at a new nightspot called The Twilight Zone and after a year of saving their gig money they decided to move to Liverpool, England with hopes of stardom. They arrived in England July 20, 1965. They spent most of their money on travel and resorted to stealing coal to heat the flat they’d rented, playing non-paying gigs just to get their name known. Penner left after 5 months and the band replaced him with a local bass player named Stewart McKernan. The were sooned booked at regular shows at the Cavern Club where Paul McCartney, John Lennon, and even Beatles manager Brian Epstein would stop by to see them. But it was Chris Curtis of The Searchers who took a shining to the band. He renamed them and organized the recording session that would land them a deal with Pye Records in the UK. They released a cover version of Paul Revere & The Raiders’ “Hungry” but the record failed to chart. They could not make any headway in the crowded music scene and Masters returned to Canada October 7, 1966 with his new British bride. MacRae had also married a British girl and soon followed, as did Loeb. Upon returning to Winnipeg, The Crescendos resumed with Penner returning on bass. The band finally split up in 1967; Masters would go on to join The Fifth. Both would later become members of The Guess Who at different times.

Out of high school, Neil headed off to the Berklee School of Music in Boston, while Merritt was busy applying his punk sensibilities to a home-spun band. He talked Osborne into quitting school and joining the underground movement that was now enveloping Vancouver. Osborne and, brother, David formed their first band The Loud Rangers and appeared at Brad’s family busy to 12 people. The ‘scene’ was off limits to these suburbanites and discouraged Neil Osborne folded the act and joined Merritt in England where they watched the final glory days of the active UK punk scene. Upon returning, they were energized and hooked up with drummer Ian Franey and after a few jam sessions called themselves 54.40. Merritt, the history buff, took the name from US President James Polk’s campaign cry “54.50 Or Fight” which Polk had hoped would stir the American people into pushing the border of the union up to the 54th parallel (40th minute) to the southern tip of Alaska. The pretense of this political stance would become the rallying cry of 54.40 as they made their debut on New Year’s Eve 1980 at The Smilin’ Buddha Cabaret going head-to-toe with a sold out show in town by the Godfathers of Canadian punk – DOA. Despite the competition, 54.40 charged $1.00 at the door and managed to suitably impress 100 people. The band’s aggressive stage act and Osborne’s confrontational presence attracted the attention of fellow musician/idealist Allen Moy (Popular Front) who was involved with a non-profit record collective called Mo=Da=Mu that produced and distributed their own musicians’ products. He introduced 54.40 to the collective and it was agreed that a release was in order. In the Fall of 1981, 54.40 managed to get four of their original tunes on the ‘Things Are Still Coming Ashore’ compilation. However, the band seemed to be getting the cold shoulder in Vancouver for their in-your-face approach and spent much of their time touring the US west coast attracting fans, promoters and record labels along the way. In early ’82 Mark H. Smith, a musician from Seattle, took the band into a studio and emerged with the 6 song EP ‘Selection’ which was released that summer on Mo=Da=Mu. This was followed in 1983 by a full length album produced by Allen Moy with new member Phil Comparelli (2nd guitar, trumpet) and drummer Darryl Neudorf. The album was ‘Set The Fire’ and would be their last for Mo=Da=Mu. The label was getting into financial difficulties as 54.40 were their only profitable act so Moy and partner Keith Porteous decided to become the band’s managers instead. ‘Set The Fire’ roared up the west coast through San Francisco and LA and topped college radio charts and pushed some favourable buttons in the press. Though they weren’t chasing a major label deal, they didn’t discourage being courted by the likes of CBS Records and when Kevin Laffey and Felix Chamberlain of Warner music were denied access to a sold out gig 54.40 knew their time had come. The A & R reps from Warner were very impressed with a band that could sell out a show so significantly that even the guest list wasn’t being honoured that they actively pursued the band. The band had been scraping together all available cash to continue recording at Mushroom Studios with producer Dave Ogilvie and it was a demo of these songs that sealed the deal with Warner. Engineer Dave Jerden remixed the material and the results were released in early 1986 on Warner as simply ‘54.40’ (affectionately known as The Green Album). The first single was “Baby Ran, a college radio favourite that broke ground on the Modern Rock stations in the US. The band could now tour Canada and levelled the jaded Toronto press at their Diamond Club debut in June 1986. “I Go Blind” was the next single and solidified 54.40 as a commercially viable political rock act. After the heavy touring schedule, 54.40 found their way into a Los Angeles recording studio in 1987 to hammer out the Dave Jerden produced ‘Show Me’. With this effort they achieved a slick production with keyboards augmenting their familiar buzzsaw guitar sound which yielded two more successful singles – “One Day In Your Life” and “One Gun”. Still, high profile opening slots in the US with the BoDeans and Bob Mould did nothing to increase sales and Warner began to give the band less attention in America. The band decided to reconvene on home turf and returned to Vancouver to record with Dave Ogilvie on ‘Fight For Love’ in 1989. Immediately they launched into another tour which was highlighted by a well publicized appearance in Moscow at a music festival. On their way back to tour Canada they brought back Estonian rock act Ultima Thule to open their shows – the first appearance of an Eastern Block band ever in Canada. To keep with the homegrown aspects of their idealistic belief system 54.40 decided to shop at home when their deal with Warner Brothers expired in 1990. Warner Music was still on their side (releasing a ‘best of’ called ‘Sweeter Thing’) but 54.40 wanted a record company as committed to their music as the band was. In January 1991 54.40 found a home at Sony Canada who were restructuring and looking to establish long-term relationships and cultivating their acts. A year was spent re-defining the band’s sound and stance and the result was ‘Dear Dear’ released in May 1992. The album was a monster success with four radio charting singles – “She La”, “Nice to Luv You”, “Music Man” and “You Don’t Get Away (That Easy)”. Just to show that 54.40 hadn’t gone soft, Osborne went head to head with Bryan Adams and his manager Bruce Allen over Adams’ criticism of Canadian Content regulations in an open letter to the Canadian media. Allen responded with volatile and unrelenting attacks on Osborne’s character and helped spur open debate about the issue in the Canadian music industry. Despite this supposed backlash, 54.40 were declared ‘Canadian Cultural Champions’ on the cover of a national magazine. During this entire debacle, the band toured endlessly and jumped back and forth between recording sessions in a dingy Vancouver warehouse, finishing an entire album at the end of a 6 week, 11 country European tour with Midnight Oil in the Fall of 1993. The result was ‘Smilin’ Buddha Cabaret’ named after that first club they played at in their salad days. Once again 54.40 challenged themselves and the listeners by re-inventing themselves in the wake of the post-grunge generation (a scene that they have been credited with spearheading). The album spawned another handful of radio/video hit singles – “Blame Your Parents”, “Assoholic”, and “Ocean Pearl”. The band mounted another massive Canadian tour through 1993 and 1994 and hauled around the 800 pound neon sign that they were able to acquire from the original, demolished ‘Smilin Buddha Cabaret”. In 1995 54.40 rode the crest of a wave as Hootie & The Blowfish hit pay dirt with 54.40’s “I Go Blind”. The band were huge 54.40 fans in their early days and often played several songs by the Canadians in their set as well as driving up from South Carolina at every chance to see 54.40 play live. “I Go Blind” was originally slated for Hootie’s debut album but was bumped and ended up as the B-side to their “Hold My Hand” single. The record came to be played on the TV show ‘Friends’ and landed on its soundtrack drawing major radio play. During a summer concert in 1995 in Vancouver, Hootie and the Blowfish had Neil Osborne come on stage for an encore rendition of the song during a break in 54.40’s recording schedule at Mushroom Studios. The result of the recording sessions was 1996’s ‘Trusted By Millions’ which failed to light the world on fire but did reasonable sales. In June 1998, 54.40 released “Since When,” featuring the title track as the first single. It was produced by GGGarth Richardson (son of Canadian producer Jack Richardson). The band returned the following year with the double-CD live set, “Heavy Mellow”, and followed up in August 2000 with the new studio album, “Casual Viewin'” which drew from 60’s soul and hip-hop grooves. With their contract about to expire, the band lent their talents to backing Coco Love Alcorn under the pseudonym Paloma for a 2001 self-titled album. The band then assembled the compilation ‘Radio Love Songs: The Singles Collection’ featuring all their Columbia/Sony single releases in April 2002. The CD also included two new tracks. With their Sony deal behind them 54.40 released their tenth studio album ‘Goodbye Flatland’ in the spring of 2003 on their management’s label Divine. In 2004 Dave Genn (Matthew Good/Bif Naked) replaced long-time member Phil Comparelli for the 2005 album ‘Yes to Everything’. Their long-standing contract with Sony/BMG came to an end in 2006 and the band was soon signed to True North via Universal Music for ‘Northern Soul’ in 2009. The live tour for the album found them performing in soft-seater theatres and featured Grapes of Wrath’s Tom Hooper accompanying them as guitarist, keyboard player and backing vocalist. 2011’s ‘Lost In the City’ recorded throughout 2010 with long-time friend to the band, producer Dave Ogilvie. The band worked in a variety of studios to produce the record, including Hipposonic (formerly Mushroom Studios) as well as 604 Studios, and the band’s very own studio space known as the Smiling Buddha Enjoyment Complex. 54.40 then signed a deal with Michael Wekerle’s El Mocambo Records (an off-shoot of the famed Toronto nightclub) where they released ‘Keep On Walking’ in 2018. Singer Neil Osborne released an experimental solo double vinyl album project under the name Niz Wiz in 2020 (also on El Mocambo).

Fabian’s self-titled debut sold 100,000 copies while her 1994 follow-up, ‘Carpe Diem’, sold more than 240,000 copies. Over the course of a few years, she was nominated for several JUNO Awards and won a number of Felix Awards in Quebéc. Fabian also was chosen by Walt Disney Studios to voice the lead role of Esmeralda in the French-Canadian version of ‘The Hunchback of Notre Dame’ animated movie. In addition, her rendition of the song “Que dieu aide les exclus” (God Help the Outcasts) was included on the English soundtrack along with Bette Midler’s version. However, it was in 1996 that music fans outside of Quebéc first noticed Fabian. In October of that year, SoundScan, the retail music tracking firm, introduced its new system of compiling charts. As a result of the new methodology, Fabian’s third release, ‘Pure’, caught the attention of English Canada when it suddenly vaulted into the Top10 album charts. ‘Pure’ sold more than 100,000 copies within two weeks of its release. Fabian was finally picked up by Sony Records for her English language self-titled debut in 1999. She has continued releasing French language and English language releases globally. Fabian now lives in Crossville, Tennessee, USA.\n\nSingles\n\n1986 L’Aziza Est En Pleurs/Il Y Avait (Monopole) S-2511\n\n1988 Croire/Trust (Trema – FRANCE) 410436\n\n1989 Je Sais/[same] (Trans Euro/Select) TEM-4515\n\n1991 Le Jour Où Tu Partiras (Blue & Masters/Jill) BMCD-45-100\n\n1991 Je M’arrêterai Pas De T’aimer (Jill) JLCD-45-102\n\n1991 Qui Pense À L’Amour [3 mixes] (Jill) JLCD-4505\n\n1991 Réveille-Toi Brother (Jill) JLCD-4506\n\n1991 Les Murs (Jill) JLCD-4507\n\n1991 Il Suffit D’un éclair (Jill) JLCD-4508\n\n1992 Dire (Jill) JLCD-4508\n\n1994 Tu T’en Vas (Arpège Musique) AMCD-9\n\n1994 Je Suis Malade (Arpège Musique) AMCD-10\n\n1994 Leïla (Arpège Musique) AMCD-11\n\n1994 Si Tu M’aimes (Arpège Musique) AMCD-13\n\n1996 Tout (Arpège Musique) AMCD-21\n\n1996 Je T’aime (Arpège Musique) AMCD-26\n\n1997 J’Ai Zappé (Arpège Musique) AMCD-28\n\n1997 Humana (Version Radio)/Humana (Version Album) (Arpège Musique) AMCD-23\n\n1998 Si Tu M’Aimes (Polydor – FRANCE) 567-440-2\n\n1998 La Différence (Disques Équinoxe) EQCD-29\n\n1999 Adagio (English)/Adagio (Italian) (Epic/Sony) CDNK-1456\n\n1999 Évidemment (Musicor) EQCD-907-1-DJ\n\n1999 Meu Grande Amor/To Love Again & Dance Remixes (Columbia – BRAZIL) 900.074/2-502637\n\n1999 I Will Love Again/Love By Grace (Columbia – BRAZIL) 899.986/2-495982\n\n1999 Laisse-moi Rever/La Petite Fleur Triste (Polydor – France) 9282\n\n2000 Givin’ Up On You (Epic/Sony)\n\n2000 Otro amor vendrá (Baladas) (Epic/Sony) SAMP-8815\n\n2000 I Will Love Again (Columbia/Sony) 44K-79375\n\n2000 I Am Who I Am (Epic/Sony) SAMPS-8672\n\n2000 I Am Who I Am/Light Of My Life [feat.

The band regularly played six nights a week and needed letters of consent from their parents as the band members were between the ages of fourteen and fifteen. The band was chauffeured around by hired drivers because none of the band members had their driver’s licenses yet. The act was signed to Polydor Records worldwide at the ripe ages of sixteen and were handed the largest royalty rate to a Canadian act at that time. Fable Manor recorded at RCA Studios and released three singles for Polydor – “Oh Me Oh My”, “I Think We’re Alone Now” and “Saturday Night’s Alright For A Party” – produced by Harry Hinde. The initial hype led to headlining shows at the Canadian National Exhibition and Ontario Place Forums in Toronto utilizing stage sets that were part of a co-production deal for a pop-styled variety show with Global Television (a la “The Monkees”). The stage set-up alone took two 24′ trucks with hydraulic lifts to transport. Their logo was created with 200 lights and was 12 feet by 6 feet wide. They were featured heart-throbs in ’16’ Magazine out of the US and managed to appear on the Canadian TV show ‘Catch A Rising Star’ and did musical accompaniment for the Alan Thicke game show called ‘Face the Music’. As a footnote, Markowitz’s managerial brothers, Riff and Mitch Markowitz, successfully managed 1960’s Toronto band The Mandala. with notes from Steven Markowitz.\n\nSingles\n\n1976 Oh Me, Oh My/You’re So Fine (Polydor) 2065-327\n\n1976 I Think We’re Alone Now/Lovely Lady (Polydor) 2121-331\n\n1976 Saturday Night’s Alright For a Party (Polydor)\n\nFABLES, The\n\nBilly Sutton (mandolin, mandola, banjo, accordion, bouzouki, bodhran) / Byron Pardy (vocals) / Clyde Wiseman (vocals, bass) / D’Arcy Broderick (fiddle, mandola, guitar, vocals) / Dave Fitzpatrick (drums, percussion, vocals, guitar) / Glenn Simmons (guitar)\n\nFrom Port Aux Basques, Newfoundland.

DeGiorgio found suitable material for her and she would enjoy a seven week run on Canadian charts in June 1988 with “Savin’ Myself” (written by Major Hoople’s Boarding House member David Lodge) from her album ‘My Name Is Eria Fachin’. She also dabbled in film, playing a French maid in the movie ‘Heart Sounds’ with James Garner and Mary Tyler Moore. Most notably she sang the title track for the Kiefer Sutherland movie ‘Woman Wanted’ and it was her last recording before passing away from cancer in 1996. Her second album was never completed. In 2017 “Savin’ Myself” was used in an episode of Coronation Street in the UK. with notes from Patty (flamoe), Patricia D’Angelo, Nanda Lwin, Lou Bartolomucci.\n\nSingles\n\n1982 Not Your Puppet/On the Right Side of Love (Blue Chip) B.C. 18\n\n1986 Savin’ Myself (7:50)/(Instrumental) (7:00) [12″] (Power) PXD-073\n\n1987 Savin’ Myself/Savin’ Myself (Mix #2) (Power) PX7-200\n\n1987 Savin’ Myself (Blaster Mix)/Savin’ Myself (Original Mix) [12″] (Power) PXD-087\n\n1987 Savin’ Myself (Hotline Remix)/Savin’ Myself (Blaster Mix) [12″] (Saturday – UK) STD-1\n\n1988 Savin’ Myself /(Instrumental) (Power) PXX-200\n\n1988 Your Love Just Came Too Late (Red White And Blue Edit)/Your Love Just Came Too Late (Blaster Edit) (Power) PX7-201\n\n1988 Your Love Just Came Too Late [6 mixes] [12″] (Power) PXD-101\n\n1988 Your Love Just Came Too Late [4 mixes] [12″] (Critique – US) 0-96639\n\n1988 Your Love Just Came Too Late/You’re So Sexy (Critique – US) 7-99306\n\n1988 Eria’s Aria/I Hear A Symphony/I Hear A Symphony (Instrumental)//I Hear A Symphony (Ultimix Version II)/I Hear A Symphony (Slowdown Mix) [12″] (Power) PXD-110\n\n1988 I Hear a Symphony//Eria Aria/You’re So Sexy [12”] (Power) PXY-211\n\n1989 Eria’s Aria/I Hear A Symphony//You’re So Sexy (Power) PX7-211\n\n1992 Savin’ Myself (Blaster Mix)/I Hear A Symphony/Savin’ Myself (Instrumental) [12″] (Loading Bay – UK) LBAY-1001\n\n1996 Savin’ Myself (OPM Poppy Mix)//Savin’ Myself (Livin’ It Up Mix)/Savin’ Myself (Definitive Mix) [12″] (Almighty – UK) 12-ALMY-90\n\nAlbums\n\n1988 My Name Is Eria Fachin (Power) PXH-2000\n\n1988 Eria Fachin [3-song 3”] (Power) CD PX3-01\n\n1996 Savin’ Myself – The Remixes [5-songs] (Almighty – UK) CD-ALMY-90\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1988 “Savin’ Myself” on ‘Tea Dance – Volume 4’\n\nFACTREE [aka THE FACTORY/TREE]\n\nRick Gauthier (bass) / Chris Smith (guitar)/ Mike Weaver (drums)\n\nThis three-piece from Welland, Ontario formed in 1967 as The Factory when Weaver and Gauthier left their band The Mood and Smith left his band 13th Floor and joined forces.

From those sessions the band got a demo audition with RCA Records who released one single on their Sparton Records imprint in 1968 called “Kaleidoscope” under the band’s new name Factree.

He was also playing for the silent movie houses, but in 1926 he injured his hands in a fire, thus ending any concert career opportunities. In 1927, he began arranging, first for hotel orchestras, and then for radio extensively in the 1930’s. From 1938 to 1940, ‘Music by Faith’ was heard on the CBC. However, in 1940 with his budget cut, and tiring of feeling that the CBC hired kept him as their token Jewish operative , he moved to Chicago, Illinois, and later to New York City, accepting a post with the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC), where he became an American citizen in 1945. In New York, he arranged and also conducted for many radio shows including ‘The Carnation Contented Hour’; ‘Buddy Clark show’; ‘The Coca Cola show’, etc. He was recording for Decca and then RCA, but in 1950, became part of the Columbia Records A&R staff where he worked with Tony Bennett on three of the crooners’ million selling records: “Because Of You”, “Rags To Riches”, and “Cold, Cold Heart.” In 1950, he wrote “My Heart Cries For You” (a hit for Guy Mitchell). He also became one of the leaders of the ‘Pop Instrumental’ movement. During 1952-53, he had several hit records including the Brazilian song “Delicado” and “The Song From The Moulin Rouge” (a Felicia Sanders vocal hit). He also recorded his own ‘Mood Music’ albums and had three hits of his own with “Theme For Young Lovers” (#32 in Canada in 1960), and “Theme From ‘A Summer Place'” (#4 in Canada in 1960; #1 in the USA and #2 in the UK in 1961). During the 1950’s Faith worked in Hollywood on such films as the Ruth Etting biography ‘Love Me Or Leave Me’ (1955) starring Doris Day and garnering Faith an Academy Award nomination. He scored several more movies in the 1960’s like ‘Tammy Tell Me True’ (1961), ‘I’d Rather Be Rich’ (1964), ‘The Love Goddesses’ (1964), ‘The Third Day’ (1965), and ‘The Oscar’ (1966).\n\nSingles\n\nas PERCY FAITH\n\n1956 Noëls [5-song EP] (Philips – FRANCE) 429.072 BE\n\n1957 Till/The Last Dance (Columbia) 4-40826\n\n1957 Bahama Lullaby / Italiano!

After landing a place on the ShareChez ’87 talent contest compilation held by CHEZ 106FM, they headed to Toronto to try and catch their big break. Both Campbell and Stephens had been in Melwood Cutlery and the Fashion Plates at the exact same time and left that band to continue on with Fat Man Waving. They managed two independent albums – ‘Fat Man Waving’ (1989) and ‘Parade’ (1992) – before getting signed to Aquarius where their third album, ‘The Habit of Gravity’ (1995), was released. Unfortunately, the band would split up the following year.

While living there he picked up the guitar and absorbed traces of the Irish and English musical traditions that have informed his roots and Celtic folk style ever since. After a short stint in the United States Midwest, he returned to Canada in 1981 where he began recording his original material. Over the course of his career, Fearing has been able to work with the genre’s most esteemed producers. English folk star Clive Gregson (Any Trouble, Gregson and Collister) produced his acclaimed 1989 album ‘Blue Line’; Steve Berlin (Los Lobos) produced 1994’s ‘The Assassin’s Apprentice’ which also featured guest stars Sarah McLachlan and Richard Thompson). In 1996 Fearing became a founding member of Blackie & the Rodeo Kings with Colin Linden and Tom Wilson (Junkhouse). They have recorded seven albums to date. Linden would produce three solo albums for Fearing: 1997’s ‘Industrial Lullaby’ featuring Margo Timmins (Cowboy Junkies), Richard Bell (The Band) and Tom Wilson, 2000’s ‘So Many Miles – LIVE’ and co-produced 2002’s ‘That’s How I Walk’ with Fearing. The album featured special guests Richard Bell, Ian Thornley (Big Wreck) and Shawn Colvin. In 1999 Fearing appeared on the album ‘Dirt’ by the Arrogant Worms. 2006’s ‘Yellowjacket’ was produced by Fearing but engineered by Scott Merritt. Fearing also wrote a majority of the songs on the album with The Skydiggers’ Josh Finlayson. Fearing has been nominated for four JUNO Awards related to his solo works. In 2011, Fearing teamed up with guitarist Andy White for the album ‘Fearing & White’ which was recorded in Guelph and mixed by Scott Merritt.

Feehan began in bands early on but it wasn’t until 1979 when of his college bands, Footloose, started making waves on the Western dance scene that things began to take off. In 1980 their debut album yielded the hit “Leaving For Maui” which went Top-10 for several weeks in Canada. The band released several more singles over 1980 and 1981 with Feehan leaving shortly thereafter to pursue a solo career. He continued his tenure as a solo artist with Mustard Records but it wasn’t until 1983’s duet with Vikki Moss on “Never Say Die” that he managed a No.1 hit single on Adult Contemporary radio. He also won the Alberta Recording Association Songwriting competition. The prize was a recording session with producer David Foster. In 1984, Feehan recorded a single, “Read Between the Lines” that was recorded by David Foster with Steve Lukather on guitar and Fee Waybill doing backing vocals. Feehan then went to Los Angeles hot on the heals of winning the David Foster Songwriting Competition for the song “Where’s The Fire?”. Los Angeles music types seemed unimpressed, but in 1986 he convinced Scotti Bros. Records his value as a songwriter/performer. Foster produced Feehan’s self-titled debut and then decided to use him as the lead singer for a David Foster World Tour ’87 because Peter Cetera was unavailable. The tour included a 5-date tour Japan where Feehan was mobbed by fans because his solo videos were being aired on Japanese TV as part of the promotion of Foster’s tour and Scotti Bros. push for Feehan’s solo album. He moved to LA and soon attracted the attention of producers of the Charlie Sheen movie ‘The Wraith’ and they loved his song “Where’s The Fire?” so much it became the title theme of the movie in 1987. Meanwhile Feehan continued his own tour opening shows for Larry Gowan and sang in front of 60,000 people in Vancouver during a celebration for athlete Rick Hanson. He did the same for the unveiling of a bronze statue in honour of Wayne Gretzky in 1989 and sang an original song, “The Memories Will Last Forever”, just for the occasion. By 1990 he had switched to MCA Records and released ‘Full Contact’ with producer Brian “Too Loud” McLeod (Headpins, Chilliwack). The single “Heart In Pieces” featured The Tubes’ Prairie Prince on drums and a Richard Marx on backing vocals. Tim has spent the last 12 years in Los Angeles running a production company that has produced former teen idol singer Tiffany among other acts. with notes from Tim Feehan, Terry Medd, Jeroen Bakker, Don Palmer and Michael Gabriel.

With her mother and brother they moved to Regina, Saskatchewan where they lived with her grandparents. They would later move to Calgary and while there, began writing and singing in choirs. She would be one of 1,000 singers to perform at the Calgary Winter Olympics. In 1991, the fifteen year-old founded and sang in Calgary punk band Placebo. Through a battle of the bands contest Placebo won a slot to perform with the Ramones at Infest ’93. Also on the bill that day was Canadian indie act hHead whose member, Brendan Canning, would become a bandmate of hers many years later. In 1995, Feist had to re-assess her music career having suffered from vocal cord fatigue. She made the decision to move from Calgary to Toronto in 1996 and connected with members of hHead. The group’s Noah Mintz asked her to play bass in his new solo project Arkweld despite never having played bass before. By 1998, she became the rhythm guitarist By Divine Right and toured with them until 2000. Feist got her solo career kick-started at Hamilton’s Catherine North Studio which was co-owned by her uncle, Dan Achen (of Junkhouse), and recorded her first demos at the facility. Her debut album, ‘Monarch (Lay Your Jewelled Head Down)’, was released in 1999 and was produced by future Dragonette member Dan Kurtz. During this period Feist became roommates with Merrill Nisker aka Peaches who asked Feist to work the back of the stage at Peaches’ shows as a sock puppet named Bitch Lap Lap. This led to both women touring the UK together 2000-2001 and later appearing as guest vocalist on ‘The Teaches of Peaches’ album as well as the Peaches “Lovertits” video. Feist would later appear on a cover version of the same song with Gonzales. She would spend nearly two years touring with Gonzales allowing some home made demos languish unfinished. In 2001 she joined Brian Canning, who she had met when he was in hHead, in creating a revised version of the collective musical group Broken Social Scene, adding vocals to many tracks including ‘You Forgot It In People’. While touring with Gonzales, they began hammering out finished recordings of her abandoned songs, the bulk of which would become her major label debut album ‘Let It Die’. She eventually settled in Paris and continued collaborating with others including Norwegian duo Kings of Convenience and with Jane Birkin on her album ‘Rendezvous’. The album garnered Feist two Canadian JUNO Awards for ‘Best New Artist’ and ‘Best Alternative Rock Album’ in 2004 leading to half-a-million album sales worldwide (platinum sales in Canada and gold sales in France). Her self-directed video for “One Evening,” (featuring Buck 65) was also nominated for ‘Video of the Year’ as well. Feist capitalized on the growing success with an intense two year touring schedule which took her through North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia well into 2006. Feist would return to Europe that year to record a follow-up to an album of remixes and collaborations called ‘Open Season’ which featured Gonzales, Mocky, Jamie Lidell, and Renaud Letang. She would also sing on “La Même Histoire” and “We’re All in the Dance” for the soundtrack to the 2006 film ‘Paris, je t’aime’. Peaches also had her contribute backing vocals on the song “Give ‘Er” on the ‘Impeach My Bush’ album. Feist’s third album, ‘The Reminder’, was released in spring 2007 with a world tour to follow. The album features “1234,” a song co-written by New Buffalo’s Sally Seltmann, that became a surprise hit after being used in Apple’s iPod Nano commercial. The album sold more than a million copies, almost exclusively as iTunes downloads and won 2008 JUNO Awards for ‘Album of the Year’ and ‘Single Of The Year’ (for “1234”). Time Magazine named “1234” one of The 10 Best Songs of 2007, ranking it at #2. Feist would go on to sing a revised version of the song on the 39th season of ‘Sesame Street’ and, later, on ‘Saturday Night Live’ and the ‘Colbert Report’. In 2008 she accompanied the Disko Bay Expedition of Cape Farewell. That same year she also told the media she would be stepping out of the limelight to give herself some breathing room. By early 2009 she was back collaborating with Beck’s Record Club series, Wilco, Brooklyn band Grizzly Bear and in guest appearances with her old band Broken Social Scene including a North by Northeast performance celebrating the launch of the band’s biography entitled ‘This Book Is Broken’ and that summer at the Harbourfront Centre in Toronto. Feist performed at the Orpheum Theatre during the 2010 Olympic Celebrations in Vancouver, British Columbia. In 2010 she released a super 8mm documentary of the making of her 2007 album ‘The Reminder.’ Feist released the album ‘Metals’ in 2011 which was recorded in Big Sur, California. She would then appear in the 2011 Muppets movie ‘The Muppets,’ and in 2012 she wrote the song ‘Fire In the Water’ exclusively for the soundtrack to the ‘The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2’. It would be six years before her next album entitled ‘Pleasure’ in 2017 along with the lead-off single of the title track.\n\nSingles\n\n2003 Mushaboom/When I Was a Young Girl (VV Remix) (Polydor – UK) 9823050\n\n2004 Inside And Out [4 remixes] (Polydor – UK) 10483\n\n2004 One Evening/One Evening (Remix by VV) (Polydor – UK) FEIST-2\n\n2005 Gatekeeper (Polydor) 983-015.1\n\n2007 1, 2, 3, 4 (Arts & Crafts/Polydor/Universal) 0600753006795\n\n2007 I Fee It All [5 remixes] (Polydor – UK) REMINDER-5\n\n2007 My Moon My Man (Radio Edit)/My Moon My Moon (Boize Noize Classic Remix) (Arts & Crafts/Universal) A & C DPRO 024\n\n2007 Secret Heart (Arts & Crafts/Universal)\n\n2011 How Come You Never Go There (Polydor – UK) FEISTPRO1\n\n2011 The Bad In Each Other (Cherry Tree/Interscope/Polydor)\n\n2017 Pleasure (Quality of Life/Universal)\n\n2017 Hey, That’s No Way To Say Goodbye (Interscope)\n\nAlbums\n\n1999 Monarch: Lay Your Jewelled Head Down (independent) CD-0023\n\n2004 Let It Die (Arts & Crafts/Universal) A & C 007\n\n2004 Let It Die [4-song EP] (Polydor – UK) FEIST-4\n\n2006 Open Season – Remixes and Collabs (Arts & Crafts/Universal) A&C016\n\n2007 The Reminder (Arts & Crafts/Universal) A & C 023\n\n2010 Look At What The Light Did Now (Arts & Crafts/Universal) ACDVD-002\n\n2011 Metals (Arts & Crafts/Universal) A & C 063\n\n2017 Pleasure (Quality Of Life/Universal) B00264070\n\n2023 Multitudes (Polydor/Universal – France) 4873183\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n2005 “Inside & Out” on ‘Women & Songs 9’ (WEA) WTVD-62800\n\n2006 “Mushaboom” on ‘Women & Songs 10: 10th Anniversary Edition’ (WEA) WTVD-63889\n\nFELLOWSHIP\n\nEvan Paul “Andy” Kozaris (guitar) / Gary Wyonch (drums) / Bob McCumber (saxophone) / Doug Wright (organ) / John Frederick Lovett (vocals) / Harry Busby (horns) / Wilf Sharp (trumpet) / Charlotte Martin (vocals; replaced Lovett)\n\nGuitarist Andy Kozaris met Wyonch and McCumber when they were members of Tobi Lark’s backing band. The trio decided to form a band called Stage Train in Toronto with organist Doug Wright and Kozaris’ girlfriend Linda Gurney on vocals. Eventually, Kozaris and Gurney’s relationship became a stress on the band and she was asked to leave. Wyonch and McCumber brought in Rock Show of the Yeomen vocalist John Frederick Lovett – a soul and R & B singer – and they changed the name of the band to J.F.L. Fellowship. The group also added horns – initially with McCumber adding sax alongside Harry Busby’s horn accompaniment – before adding trumpet player and arranger Wilf Sharp. Soon personality conflicts in the band found Lovett being replaced by a new female vocalist, Charlotte Martin. The band became known as simply Fellowship at that point. The were soon performing at all the top rooms in Toronto including Le Coq Door, The Generator, The Forge, Piccadilly Tube, The Colonial, The Embassy, as well as Québec and the Northern U.S. In 1974, producer and Ampex Records chief John Driscoll approached the band about recording a cover of Martha & The Vandellas’ “Dancing In the Streets” and signed them. Fellowship recorded at RCA Studio on Gould Street in Toronto to cut the song along with an original song by Kozaris for the B-side entitled “Funky Fever.” A bass player was added specifically for the session and engineered by George Semkiw. Driscoll took the A-side to Los Angeles and had it remixed with a string section. The song didn’t reflect the actual sound of the band, and once it had been released there were only pockets of Canada where the song got any airplay as it sounded far too much like the original to gain traction with radio programmers. The B-side, “Funky Fever,” however was played on an Oakville radio station by DJ Willy Dee who had once been married to Martha Reeves who sang the original “Dancing In the Streets.” The A-side had caught his attention because of his association to her, but he formally announced that he preferred Kozaris’ B-side instead. A follow-up cover tune was suggested by Driscoll and instead of recording another single, the band let their contract lapse and disband. Various versions of Fellowship would follow but ultimately Kozaris and Martin formed a new act called Dancing Machine with Martin’s brother Robert, John Marmora (drums), Davey Jones (organ), Ian Harper (saxophone), and Adrian Farmer (bass). Management wanted Charlotte Martin as the star and the band was fired. Kozaris rejoined Gary Wyonch and Bob McCumber in a new act called Clean Slate which was short lived; Sharp would form a 16-piece jazz ensemble and has since passed away; Wyonch died in October 17, 2018; McCumber and Lovett have also passed; Wright is still making music as is Kozaris under the name Evan Paul; Charlotte Martin now lives in Winnipeg.

The group mined the Montréal, Ottawa, and Toronto punk scenes for several years releasing one EP on Monteco Records before shifting to more rock and roll styled music a la The Rolling Stones. A failed second release in 1978 led to the dissolution of the band by 1980. Paul and Michael Fenton carried on as The Fenton Bros. Band – initially with Action drummer Andre Action, before he was replaced with Doug Inglis fresh from the disbanded Toronto act Goddo. The group released a self-titled EP featuring several songs written during their Action days. The played the Highway 401 corridor from Montréal to Windsor for many years before tackling a second EP in 1987 under the condensed name The Fentons.

He loved to sing and was encouraged by his co-workers to pursue a career in music. He would leave the CBC in 1959 to form the band Les Bozos featuring other up-and-coming French-Canadian artists such as André Gagnon, Clémence DesRochers, and Claude Léveillée among others. They held residency at the Chez Bozo club on Crescent Street in Montreal. He was a charismatic and charming frontman and M.C. which led to his TV debut on the show ‘Music Hall’. From there he took on a year-long residency at Anjou Theatre with Clémence DesRochers. In 1962 he co-wrote ‘Feuilles de gui’ with Pierre Brabant which won the CBC competition ‘Chansons sur mesure’ and the grand prize at ‘Gala Internationale de la Chanson’ in Brussels. That year Ferland sang at the Cabaret La Tête de l’art in Paris, France. He also hosted the CBC special ‘L’Été des Bozos’. In 1963 he represented Canada at the 3rd annual ‘International Son Festival’ in Sopot, Poland and won the prestigious ‘Best Singer’ prize. He starred in the CBC TV show ‘Jeuness Oblige’ and toured Quebéc in 1964. In 1965 he won the grand prize in the ‘Festival du Disque de Montreal’. In 1966 Ferland toured Ontario, Quebéc and the Maritimes and also did a month long set of dates in Paris, France. In 1967 Ferland recorded “Le chemin du Roy” to commemorate the visit to Quebéc by General Charles de Gaulle from France. His 1968 self-titled album on Barclay Records won the Grand Prix du Disque de l’Académie Charles-Cros. He also won the grand prize in the ‘Festival du Disque de Montreal’ for the second time. Ferland also released a book in 1969 featuring his song lyrics entitled ‘Chansons’. Ferland sang at the International Exposition at Expo ’70 in Osaka, Japan. Also that year, he released ‘Jaune’ which was produced by Andre Perry at Le Studio in Montreal. The album sold 6 times platinum that year alone. In 1974 he had chart success with a Ginette Reno duet entitled ‘T’es mon amour, t’es ma maîtresse. In 1976 Ferland wrote, starred in and performed the music in the film ‘Chanson pour Julie’. After touring Quebéc, he taped four episodes for the CBC TV series ‘Faut voir ça’ in 1978 as part of a bigger national TV special entitled ‘Between Chopin and William Tell’. In the 1980s Ferland hosted several TV shows between recording projects: ‘Station Soleil’ from 1981 to 1987, ‘Tapis Rouge’ in 1986, ‘L’autobus du showbusiness’ in 1987, and ‘Ferland/Nadeau’ in 1990. Ferland launched the opera ‘Gala’ in 1989 but it closed within days after poor ticket sales. Jean-Pierre Ferland died April 27, 2024.\n\nSingles\n\n1958 Marie Ange La Douce/Le Chasseur De Baleine (London) 45-FC.410\n\n1958 Tristesse Et Guitare/L”amure Est Morte (London) 45-FC.411\n\n1961 Les
