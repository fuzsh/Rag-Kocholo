        "text": "Note: For an index of all articles in all three Favorite Songs series, click here, then scroll down.\n\nWho He Was: Prince Rogers Nelson (1958-2016) was one of the most gifted and influential artists of the past half century, a genius tragically struck down before his time by an accidental fentanyl overdose. Prince emerged in full-blown splendor from the chilly heart of Minneapolis (he was my wife’s neighbor, and she worked with his long-time bass player, Mark Brown, while in high school) as a precocious and prodigious talent with the one-two funky soul and R&B punches of 1978’s For You and 1979’s Prince LPs, both of which were written, recorded, arranged, produced and sung by the artist alone, mostly while he was still a teenager; the latter album spawned his first hit single, “I Wanna Be Your Lover.”\n\nPrince’s third album, Dirty Mind (1980), marked a dramatic turning point for the artist, ramping up the rock elements of his music, presenting him via its cover art as a strangely androgynous sexy beast, and integrating into his lyrics the explicitly spiritual and sensual elements that came to be his hallmarks. I’d argue that his run of seven albums between Dirty Mind and Sign o’ the Times (1987) may represent the most explosively influential and creative body of seven consecutive recorded works since the Beatles Help! to Let It Be continuum. As if that weren’t enough, he also penned a ridiculous number of hit singles for other artists, including “Manic Monday” (The Bangles), “I Feel for You” (Chaka Khan), “Jungle Love” (The Time), “The Glamorous Life” (Sheila E), “Sugar Walls (Sheena Easton), and “Nothing Compares 2 U” (Sinead O’Connor).\n\nLike the Beatles, Prince also became a film star during his most creative and influential era, most notably with 1984’s Purple Rain. Following Sign o’ the Times, Prince disbanded his long-time live group, The Revolution, fell into a record label dispute that resulted in him replacing his given name with a glyph (the “Artist Formerly Known as Prince” era), then slowly reclaimed his identity and re-emerged as a stage hero for the ages, adding “Guitar God” to his already impressive resume. While he continued to write and record prolifically until his death (he issued 40 studio albums, one posthumously, over the course of his career), he never attained the same level of critical praise and cultural ubiquity that he possessed in the 1980s, but that’s no damning statement, giving the fact that his later works still occasionally sold in Gold or Platinum certification level numbers.\n\nWhen I First Heard Him: I can be super weirdly specific on this one, though I don’t know why this memory sticks with me so clearly. The first Prince song I heard (like most folks) was “I Wanna Be Your Lover,” on American Top 40, on a Sunday morning when I was riding with my family to Hicksville United Methodist Church on Long Island. It was the first week the song charted (so I could get the exact date, with a little bit of research), and Kasey Casem introduced the artist and his work, explaining how young he was, and how he played every instrument on the song (wow!) as we were on Merrick Avenue, west of Eisenhower Park. The song ended after we waited through several lights and made the right turn onto Old Country Road toward Hicksville. How’s that for detail, huh? I liked the song, and I was most impressed by the story behind its creator and his creation, but I didn’t buy either of the first two albums at the time. My first Prince purchase was his next full-length disc, Dirty Mind, which I knew was a game changer, and which started my run of eagerly purchasing everything he issued for most of the next decade. I never saw him live, alas, but Marcia and I did visit his most awesome custom studio/home/nightclub, Paisley Park, which was incredible and inspiring, though of course it was sad that he was no longer around to work his magic within its confines.\n\nWhy I Loved Him: During his creative and commercial apex, every Prince release (album, single, or film) felt to me like an absolutely thrilling event, like experiencing history-in-the-making in real time, devouring what he shared with us, awed by it all, and then eagerly wondering just what the prolific genius could possibly give us next time to top it. But them, wowzers, he would do just that, and then he would do it again, and again, and again. I mean, was there anything weirder sounding, but yet instantly popular, than, say, “When Doves Cry,” upon first hearing? Not many things spring to mind.\n\nIn those pre-Internet days, I got most of my music news by devouring Rolling Stone and (later) SPIN magazines, and whenever they’d provide advance notice of some new Prince project forthcoming, it always produced palpable excitement, and a scheduled run to the record store or movie theater to experience it as soon as I possibly could. While I’ve had a couple of other artists who I felt that way about (Butthole Surfers in the same time frame, for example), the difference with Prince was that his stuff was actually popular, and I wasn’t a lone or small pack weirdo and freak in my enthusiasms, which was somewhat refreshing for me, honestly.\n\nWhile some of Prince’s best work from the ’80s definitely sounds of its time all these years on (the boom-pock drum synths and bright synth stabs, most notably), in their original context, they were revelatory sonic sculptures, like some aural version of Citizen Kane, that you can’t really appreciate for its radical nature anymore, because everything changed in its aftermath, diluting the “Oh my God, what is this?!?” punch experienced by those who didn’t get blasted by it in its glorious and transformational original release.\n\nI don’t quite know why (it could be the end of the Revolution era, I guess), but after Sign o’ the Times, I lost that sense of eager anticipation for Prince’s projects; I know there’s fine stuff to be had in his latter-day catalog, but my own personal knowledge of it is fairly limited. No surprise, then, that my Top Ten Prince songs list below is culled entirely from the Dirty Mind to Sign o’ the Times era, which I (once again) consider to be one of the most impressive creative bursts ever, by anyone, in any time. And that’s certainly more than enough for me to count Prince as a favorite artist. (Note: Prince’s early MTV era videos were also important and impressive, so I link to them in the list below, where applicable).\n\n#10. “Mountains,” from Parade (1986)\n\n#9. “Controversy,” from Controversy (1981)\n\n#8. “When You Were Mine,” from Dirty Mind (1980)\n\n#7. “Let’s Go Crazy,” from Purple Rain (1984)\n\n#6. “Delirious,” from 1999 (1982)\n\n#5. “When Doves Cry,” from Purple Rain (1984)\n\n#4. “Kiss,” from Parade (1986)\n\n#3. “Sign o’ the Times,” from Sign o’ the Times (1987)\n\n#2. “Raspberry Beret,” from Around the World in a Day (1985)\n\n#1. “I Would Die 4 U,” from Purple Rain (1984)\n\nNote: For an index of all articles in all three Favorite Songs series, click here, then scroll down.\n\nWho They Are: A four-on-the-floor, balls-to-the-wall, hard-hitting, stoner-swinging rock quartet formed in 1991 in Western Maryland by Neil Fallon (vocals, guitar), Dan Maines (bass), Tim Sult (guitar), and Jean-Paul Gaster (drums). The late Mick Schauer (keyboards) briefly made Clutch a quintet from 2005-2008, but otherwise, the core four have rocked on uninterrupted with no other line-up changes for three decades-plus and counting. The group are best known for the heavy melodic riffage, for Fallon’s surreal and literate lyrics, for their incredible live stage presence, and for their impressive creative and commercial success as a self-contained business unit running their own label: Weathermaker Music. Weathermaker also represents The Bakerton Group, a psychedelic instrumental jazz ensemble whose members also just happen to be named Fallon, Maines, Sult and Gaster. I’ve seen The Bakerton Group open for Clutch live, a most impressive feat of marathon music making, with four brilliant musicians delivering hours of music, one set radically different from the other.\n\nWhen I First Heard Them: I saw them live before I heard them on record, which is probably the right way to go about it. My first of several Clutch shows was in 1995 or 1996, I think, at Albany’s legendary QE2 nightclub, built in an old White Tower hamburger stand. I am pretty sure the group were touring their second, self-titled album, released in May of 1995. The show was a multi-band bill, which I was reviewing, and I don’t think Clutch were yet headlining; I don’t have the review anymore and don’t remember who else played that night, alas, as my primordial web host lost a couple of years worth of files in the early incarnations of my personal internet presence, when things like site stability and file backup weren’t as well-developed and deployed as they are now. But it didn’t and doesn’t matter: Clutch were the important memory baked-in right good that night. The Q had a raised balcony above its seething mosh-pit floor, right atop the mixing board, where I always sat when I was covering shows. My fellow music-critic friend Tom Flynn was with me up there; he had already seen Clutch live, and was a committed fan. As the group took the stage, I still remember Tom saying to me “Hold on, man, the craziest shit comes out of this guy’s mouth.” And, boy, was he right. And, boy, was it loud, probably the loudest thing I ever heard in that room, and that’s saying something. By the time their next (third) album, The Elephant Riders, came out in 1998, they’d graduated to mostly head-lining status in mostly larger rooms. I saw them probably five more times over the years, usually at the defunct Saratoga Winners in Cohoes, New York, or the also-defunct The Chance in Poughkeepsie. I’ve eagerly acquired everything they’ve issued since that first show almost 30 years ago, and loved almost every bit of it.\n\nWhy I Love Them: I again have to come back to their live prowess, as an opening argument. I’m on the record as naming them the second-greatest live rock ensemble in music history, after only the original line-up of The Who. It’s a bold position to take, sure, but I remain committed to it, and believe it to be imminently defensible. I’ve got a page on the website summarizing my reviews of three of their concerts, here, and one of those shows is featured on on old (2009) article I did describing the Ten Most Memorable Concerts I’ve ever attended, here. (I really do need to update that list with another decade-and-a-half of show-going under my belt). But the live magic wouldn’t happen without an extraordinary collection of songs to take to the stage, and boy howdy, have they got quite a catalog: 13 studio albums and half-a-dozen or so EPs, all of them jam-packed with grooving goodness. The group rock hard, for sure, but the players have got a far more nimble touch to their playing that most other acts in the stoner-rock adjacent arena, who tend to reply on sludge and stodge as their anchors, while Clutch just absolutely swing most of the time, pummeling riffs atop danceable grooves, anchored in the blues, but veering wildly across stylistic lines as the songs require.\n\nNeil Fallon is, as my friend Tom once evocatively noted, a brilliant lyricist, often drawing on the themes of the rural South that so infuse and define my own writing and internal monologues; the first new album I acquired by them after my initial concert, the aforementioned The Elephant Riders, features (among other things) a title song imagining the Civil War fought Hannibal-style atop rampaging elephants, an ode to the creepy magic of “The Soapmakers” doing their dangerous rituals deep in the woods, a spooky groove about the marshes and swamps over which flies “The Dragonfly,” and a sad life story about what happens when you end up on the losing end of the “Wishbone.” Fallon has continued over the years to evoke rural, nautical, historical, and sociological tropes in his tunes, while also picking up elements of science fiction, hard-boiled detective tales, government conspiracy-mongering, and whatever else nabs his focused attention. And then he delivers the goods with titanic vocal force, potent, melodic, urgent, like some old-time Preacherman come to offer us salvation, even though he knows that our damnation would likely be more fun for everybody. They’re the real deal, at bottom line, apex rock n’ roll, delivered by skilled professionals with master craftsmen mojo and attitude. Hands up, who wants to rock!\n\n#10. “Abraham Lincoln,” from Strange Cousins from the West (2009)\n\n#9. “Careful With That Mic . . .,” from Pure Rock Fury (2001)\n\n#8. “Hot Bottom Feeder,” from Book of Bad Decisions (2018)\n\n#7. “Book of Bad Decisions,” from Book of Bad Decisions (2018)\n\n#6. “The Mob Goes Wild,” from Blast Tyrant (2004)\n\n#5. “The Dragonfly,” from The Elephant Riders (1998)\n\n#4. “We Strive for Excellence,” from Sunrise on Slaughter Beach (2022)\n\n#3. “The Regulator,” from Blast Tyrant (2004)\n\n#2. “The Soapmakers,” from The Elephant Riders (1998)\n\n#1. “Burning Beard,” from Robot Hive/Exodus (2005)\n\nMarcia and I have made it home from a three-week adventure in Norway, Scotland, and England, tired and jet-lagged at the moment, but exhilarated by our experiences.\n\nWe began the trip in Oslo, where we visited neighborhoods where Marcia’s Norwegian ancestors lived and loved before emigrating to the United States, some superb nautical history and art museums, and one of the most bizarre sculpture gardens we’ve ever seen. We also had an unexpectedly stupendous American-style BBQ meal at Way Down South, highly recommended should you find your way to Norway’s capitol city.\n\nWe met our trek group in Oslo, a small but delightful crew with Magda as our most-able and enthusiastic guide, and Kate and Kevin as our fellow pilgrims to Norway’s rural reaches. We did a hut-to-hut series of hikes in Jotunheimen National Park, then worked our way down to Aurlansvangen to climb the stark and beautiful Mount Prest overlooking the awesome Aurlandsfjord. We ended our time together in Bergen, and Marcia and I stayed on for an extra day to explore that truly beautiful city. This was the third trip we’ve made with Wildland Trekking, and once again, it was excellently structured and run. I encourage you to check out their offerings if you’re looking for a small group adventure where you don’t have to handle all of the logistics yourself.\n\nWe then flew across the North Sea to Edinburgh, Scotland, our home base for the next four days, with a nice day trip by train to Glasgow to experience that historic city as well. We climbed Arthur’s Seat on our last day there, giving us a wonderful vista from the shattered crags atop that extinct volcanic peak.\n\nNext up, another train trip to Manchester, where we visited numerous museums celebrating the city’s industrial history, along with many interesting and significant sites related to much of the music I love the most. We took the tram up to Prestwich, where Mark E. Smith of The Fall lived until his death in 2018, saw the Free Trade Hall where both Bob Dylan’s infamous “Judas!” concert and the first Sex Pistols show in Manchester were staged, and passed by the site where the influential but legendarily dysfunctional Hacienda nightclub was located. I also took an early-morning jaunt to the bridge where one of the most iconic Manchester music photos, a stark scene featuring Joy Division on a snow-covered path, was taken.\n\nAs our time in Greater Manchester wound down, we got to spend an afternoon touring and enjoyed a wonderful lunch at The Armenian Taverna with long-time virtual friends from the Fall Online Forum, where I’ve been hanging out talking about music, art, film, books, politics, and other general silliness since around 2004. Thanks to Angus, Lindsay, Alastair, Dan, and Duncan for great company and conversation, and to David in Australia for fortifying us with a kindly purchased round of drinks! We broke our trip home to Arizona into two legs, spending a night at the TWA Hotel at New York’s JFK Airport; it was nice to see that architecturally spectacular building designed by Eero Saarinen to Howard Hughes’ specifications repurposed as an act of historic preservation.\n\nAs I always do, I snapped lots of pictures along the way, more than would fit reasonably into a single photo album, so I’ve parsed them into four buckets: Urban Norway, Rural Norway, Scotland, and Manchester. Click the images below to be taken to each of the albums, should you like a more-visual report of our ramblings. We’re already thinking about next summer’s adventure, which of course I’ll report on here, when the time is right.\n\n1. Marcia’s campaign for the Arizona State House of Representatives continues apace. We’ve made a lot of trips (I serve as chauffeur) around and about the district over the past couple of months, and she’s spoken with lots of groups, both informal and formal, working to secure endorsements and motivate voters. She and her Clean Slate for Democracy colleagues do not have primary opponents, so they’re essentially already in General Election Mode. The yard signs are up, the car’s properly decorated, and Marcia has made a nice introductory video, filmed about 200 yards from our house, links shared below:\n\n2. We were up in Boise, Idaho this past weekend for my niece’s wedding, which was lovely, both in terms of the event itself, and in term of getting most of my extended family together in one place, which doesn’t happen all that often. We’ll always be able to remember Asher and Emmeline’s anniversary, as they were married the day before our own 35th anniversary, zoom zoom, time flies when you’re having fun with the one you love. Pics from two weddings below, 35 years (minus a day) apart:\n\nAnd a nice family portrait with Katelin and John, taken five minutes before the nuptials began:\n\n3. Our next big adventure begins on Monday, when we fly off to Oslo, Norway for a long trek up in Jotunheimen National Park, then working our way down through fjord country to Bergen. After a down day there, we’ll take a short flight to Edinburgh, Scotland, for a few days, then a train down to Manchester, England, for a few more days, then headed back home from there via JFK in New York City, where we’ll spend a night, just to break up that long slog westward. We booked the Norway part of the trip through Wildland Trekking, who managed our Alps to Adriatic trip last year, and our Grand Canyon trip a few years back. They’re good, so we’re going in with high expectations for a great and challenging experience. Here’s the itinerary, if curious and interested in following along. We’ll be gone for a few weeks, so things here at the website will be slow in July, though I’ll probably be posting updates on Facebook, should you wish to connect there.\n\n4. My naming convention for omnibus/multi-part posts like this one has long been to pick some musical artist, and to select song titles from their catalogs, rather than just repeating “Odds and Ends” or “Various Items” or “Miscellaneous News” or whatever in my post headers. I’ve been using the catalog of The Black Angels for the past year or so, and I think I’ve run out of selections there, so the next time I post something like this, I’ll have a new naming convention. (Not that anyone but me notices, but it’s a habit, and I like to note when I change it!)\n\nNote: For an index of all articles in all three Favorite Songs series, click here, then scroll down.\n\nWho They Were: An iconic and influential band formed in 1965 in the San Francisco Bay area by Jerry Garcia (guitar), Bob Weir (guitar), Phil Lesh (bass), Bill Kreutzmann (drums), and Ron “Pigpen” McKernan (keys); all of the members sang except for Kreutzmann. Lyricist Robert Hunter and drummer Mickey Hart joined the group by 1967, with keyboardist Tom Constanten serving a two-year stint in the late ’60s as well. The group’s founders had worked together in various configurations as Mother McCree’s Uptown Jug Champions, The Wildwood Boys, and The Warlocks, with their first live performance under the Grateful Dead moniker occurring at one of Ken Kesey’s Acid Tests in late 1965. The Dead quickly cemented their place as a cornerstone concert draw within the emergent West Coast counter-culture, and their communal house in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood served as a media-friendly hub for the “Summer of Love” and its ancillary hippie migrations to the Bay Area. I’ve visited that site, of course:\n\nFrom their earliest days, the group’s repertoire merged innovative cover songs with unique originals, all presented in an extraordinary improvisational style, with set lists and song structures routinely morphing on the fly as the group followed their collaborative muse. Pigpen was the group’s original front-man, but by the time of his death in 1973 of liver disease, he had been largely shifted to a support role, during the early ’70s period when Mickey Hart had left the band for a few years. Keith and Donna Godchaux joined on keys and vocals, lasting until 1979, when they were replaced by Brent Mydland. Keith Godchaux died in 1980 in an auto accident, and Mydland died of his an overdose in 1990. His replacement was former Tubes/Todd Rundgren collaborator Vince Welnick (supplemented by Bruce Hornsby in his early years), who committed suicide in 1996, completing the tragic “Hot Seat” run of unfortunate Grateful Dead keyboardists.\n\nBy the time of Welnick’s passing, the Dead were no more, as venerable front-man and ostensible driving soul of the group, Jerry Garcia, had died in 1995. Over the group’s 30-year run, they had but one charting single (“Touch of Grey” in 1987), but they were perennially one of the world’s top-grossing live acts, and their lasting legend is largely based on those shows, and the scenes and iconography that grew up around them. The Dead were also pioneers in encouraging the taping and trading of their live performances, making their ~2,300-show concert history one of the most well-documented in modern American musical history. Various configurations of the surviving Grateful Dead members have toured together since 1998 under a variety of names, including The Other Ones, The Dead, Furthur, and currently Dead & Company (with Weir and Hart), who we caught live last month at the Sphere in Las Vegas, an utterly exceptional concert experience, reviewed here.\n\nWhen I First Heard Them: I can usually answer this question for most groups covered in this series in a clear and precise fashion, but I can’t do so for the Dead. I had heard of them and was aware of their iconic visuals by the early ’70s, but they didn’t appear on pop radio at the time, so I suspect it would have been the mid-’70s when I first heard them, likely on Long Island’s then-magnificent free-form radio station, WLIR. I am pretty sure the first album of theirs that I heard in full was the live Europe ’72, borrowed from Nassau Community College’s lending library, as was the case with so many other things I discovered in those days and still love. I know the first one I actually bought was Terrapin Station (1977), after which I got increasingly interested in the group’s history and back catalog. I first saw them live in 1979 at Nassau Coliseum, catching one of the last of the Keith and Donna shows early in the year, and then one of the first Brent shows around Hallowe’en season. As much as I loved them, I never embarked on the stereotypical Deadhead pursuit of following them around the country as a priority, in part because I didn’t have the means to do so, and in part because I’ve never really been a musical monoculture guy, prioritizing one artist above all others. But I deeply value the memories of the several shows that I did catch, and I’ve enjoyed all of the post-Dead outings that I’ve been able to attend as well.\n\nWhy I Love Them: I’ve been active in a certain UK-based musical community for 20-some years, and we’ve often discussed and debated the differences between American and English music. I’ve posited there and elsewhere that if I was asked to select but one artist to best represent what “American Music” was in the rock era (say, post-1954), I would unquestionably and confidently select the Grateful Dead. They developed a live repertoire of some 450 unique songs over their long concert history, effectively touching on pretty much every musical genre or idiom of import in our Nation’s musical history: blues, country, jazz, folk, rock, reggae, disco, experimental, psychedelic, gospel, disco, world music, whatever, you name it, they did it, and they did it well. I have no doubt that if Jerry had lived longer, they would have figured out a way to integrate hip-hop and modern pop into their mix, not diluting their essence in any way by doing so, but taking the defining tropes of those idioms and making them their own, as they always did. If the ideals of our Nation are based on it being a cultural melting pot, then the Grateful Dead provided a true musical manifestation of those ideals, in always surprising and innovative ways.\n\nOn a non-musical front, I’m also deeply fond of the role that the late Robert Hunter (who died in 2019) played with the group, an integral non-performing member of the ensemble at large, whose magnificent poetry anchored almost all of their best songs. (Hunter usually wrote with Garcia; Weir later developed a similar writing partnership with John Perry Barlow, whose lyrics don’t move me as much, I’m sorry to say). At this junction in my life, if I could have any job in the world, I think I’d want Robert Hunter’s: that non-playing, but dedicated, lyrical role with a major musical act, who brought his moving and magical and impressionistic words to anthemic life, over and over and over again. I have had some of my words recorded by others, and it’s a great feeling hearing them that way. I can’t imagine how marvelous it would feel to make a living doing that!\n\nThere’s also a community and communal element to the Grateful Dead experience that is rich and powerful and meaningful, and which I appreciate deeply, even if I was not personally embedded within it in the same deep ways that others of my acquaintance once were. That aspect of the group’s appeal was brought home to me in the most magnificent fashion from about 2012 to 2021 via Thoughts on the Dead, the most extraordinary fan site I’ve ever encountered, related to any artist, ever. The schtick there, as TotD defined it, was this: “My thesis is that the Grateful Dead were the Silliest Band in the World. I will attempt to prove this through misquotes, malicious lies, and just plumb crazy talk; everything in these pages is, of course, satire.” It seems like a one-skit sort of premise, but in the hands of a brilliant writer like Rick Harris (the late and much lamented creator of the site), it rose to epic levels of creativity, and connected or reconnected me to a variety of folks in the greater circus of Dead fandom. And as I was writing this piece, I went to the TotD site to see what year it started, and was utterly tickled to discover that Rick’s online novel, A Book With No Title, is now available in print format, courtesy the creator’s brother. Here’s a eulogy that I wrote for TotD after Rick’s untimely death from cancer; in that piece, I note (as I had noted elsewhere, earlier), that I consider A Book With No Title to be (My) Best Book of the 21st Century. No lie, no exaggeration, and nothing has changed since 2017 to alter that deeply-held and sincere opinion.

(Just don’t call him WALLY).\n\nBefore I present my Top Ten Dead Cuts below, I must explain the logic behind my choices and the samples I’m embedding with this article. The Dead’s studio and live performances are littered with covers, many of which are rightfully seen as signature elements of their canon, but I’ve elected to select only those songs written by members of the Dead, specifically for the group. (A number of live favorites in the group’s concert catalog originated on solo studio albums by Weir, Garcia, and Hart). I’ve also elected to link to the studio versions of my selected songs, which I know a lot of Deadheads would consider heretical. While the quality of the studio albums varied widely over the years, I’m quite fond of some of them, and consider them to be classics, hands down, no argument. I also don’t wish to go down the rabbit-hole of arguments about which is the best live “Althea,” or which “Dark Star” was the most magnificent, or about whether “Scarlet Begonias” and “Fire on the Mountain” should be considered separately, or as “Scarlet > Fire,” as they were often performed live. This series focuses on songs, not performances, so I give you these studio renditions, and if you love them, I encourage you to explore further to find your very own best live versions of any or all of them. (I suspect that many readers here already have strong opinions on such matters).\n\n#10. “U.S. Blues,” from From the Mars Hotel (1974)\n\n#9. “Mountains of the Moon,” from Aoxomoxoa (1969)\n\n#8. “Cumberland Blues,” from Workingman’s Dead (1970)\n\n#7. “Althea,” from Go to Heaven (1980)\n\n#6. “Box of Rain,” from American Beauty (1970)\n\n#5. “Uncle John’s Band,” from Workingman’s Dead (1970)\n\n#4. “Friend of the Devil,” from American Beauty (1970)\n\n#3. “New Speedway Boogie,” from Workingman’s Dead (1970)\n\n#2. “Brokedown Palace,” from American Beauty (1970)\n\n#1. “That’s It For the Other One,” from Anthem of the Sun (1968)\n\nNote: For an index of all articles in all three Favorite Songs series, click here, then scroll down.\n\nWho They Are: Korn are a popular modern metal quintet formed in Bakersfield, California in 1993 by Jonathan Davis (vocals, bagpipes), James “Munky” Shaffer and Brian “Head” Welch (both guitars), Reginald “Fieldy” Arvizu (bass) and David Silveria (drums). Silveria was replaced by Ray Luzier in 2007, Welch left the group for personal reasons from 2005 to 2013, and Arvizu has been on hiatus (also for personal reasons) for the past three years, with Ra Díaz standing in on bass in live performances. While the group are often lumped by the media into the generally loathsome “nu metal” genre that emerged around the same time they did, Korn’s sound is highly distinctive and recognizably different from most of the contemporaneous peers, anchored by Fieldy’s hyper-percussive bass work, Head and Munky’s down-tuned seven-string guitars, and Davis’ extraordinary vocal gifts. The group have generally earned wan praise (if that) from mainstream music critics, meaning that much of the musical hipoisie caste dismisses or disdains them outright, often unheard, even as their fans (me among them) have purchased over 55 million copies of the albums on a worldwide basis.\n\nWhen I First Heard Them: Late 1999, when their fourth studio album, Issues, was released. I was working as a music critic at the time, and I utterly detested (and continue to do so) some of the then-luminaries of the then-new nu metal scene, Limp Bizkit, Skipknot, Staind, and Linkin Park among them. I picked up Issues as part of a pile of records to consider for print review, and fully expected to loathe it just as much as I despised the aforementioned artists, based only on what I had read about them in the press, having never actually bothered to listen to them up until that point. But, boy, was I wrong, and most willing to admit it! Issues blew me away, and I quickly acquired their first three albums, of which the self-titled debut (1994) was the only one that moved me quite as much as Issues did; the other two, 1996’s Life is Peachy and 1998’s Follow the Leader were a bit closer in sound and content to the things I didn’t like in general about most nu metal at the time. Fortunately, the path forward was a positive and powerful one, with their next studio album (2002’s Untouchables) being arguably one of their greatest works. I’ve grabbed and appreciated every Korn album since then, some more than others; the period when Welch was away was a bit spotty, though I do give them props for experimenting with mixing their sound up a bit during that period, especially on 2011’s dub-step/electronic inspired The Path of Totality. Korn have issued four albums since Welch’s return and Luzier’s arrival, and they are all extremely strong, ranking highly on the group’s all-time catalog ranking, easily. I’ve only seen Korn live once, during the summer of 2002, and they were superb in concert, a highly memorable stadium experience.\n\nWhy I Love Them: First and foremost, I love Jonathan Davis’ voice. Metal singers often get pigeon-holed into particular styles: clean, screaming, growling, rap-metal, whatever. Davis is the rare vocal stylist in modern metal with the technical skills and power to handle all of those vocal stylings and more, often shifting from one to the other, effortlessly, multiple times within a single song, and he’s also a master of metal glossolalia, occasionally dropping into nearly jazz-influenced guttural vocalese. He’s a great singer, at bottom line, capable of pummeling you in the sternum at the lower ends of his range, and breaking your heart with his plaintive, anguished falsetto at the top of his frequency curve.\n\nWhile Korn aren’t generally prone to long “proggy” songs, they do work within a compositional rubric that involves unexpected, atonal, and knotty chord and melodic sequences, as well as innovative uses of electronics and other signal processing to sweeten and broaden their heavy guitar-based palette. But, still, heavy is the operative word to describe their instrumental attack, with the grinding interplay of the seven-string guitars knitted eloquently with the thunderous rumbles of Fieldy’s bass and the drummers’ pummels. (I personally think Luzier is a much more interesting drummer than founder Silveria, adding a bit more percussive texture to the mix after his arrival, rather than the more tribal bashing of the group’s early years; though I was certainly happy with Silveria during his own tenure, to be fair).\n\nKorn do seem to be one of those bands that a lot of muso types dislike as a matter of principle, perhaps because of what they look like, or because of Head’s outspoken Christianity, or because of the (unfair) comparisons to so many wan and lame nu metal bands, or because Davis’ lyrics often mine the emotional spaces that we associate with angsty teenagers, and not with wealthy and accomplished fifty-something men. But they work for me, musically and as human beings. I always look forward to their next albums, I’m always rooting for them to come through the various personal travails that have plagued them over the years, and I’ve enjoyed the various video and concert projects that they’ve put out since I last saw them onstage over two decades ago. In short: I think they are a great band with a great catalog of songs, making my top ten list below a bit of challenge to compile, since I could go a lot deeper and still be presenting songs that I frequently play and adore.

Some members of that university band (Eider and Pat Fish among them) morphed their creative endeavors into what became The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy, while others went on to form The Woodentops. After a loose debut album (1983’s In Bath of Bacon) with a variety of contributors, The JBC tightened into a solid quartet featuring Fish (who having already dropped his birth surname, Huntrods, then became The Jazz Butcher for confusing record credit purposes), Eider, ex-Bauhaus bassist David J (later replaced by Felix Ray), and Owen Jones (also a Sonic Tonix alumnus). That incarnation of the group recorded a brilliant series of albums, EPs, and singles through late 1986, when Eider departed the fold; he later returned on an on-and-off basis for some additional recording and touring, appearing for the last time with Fish on the posthumous 2022 release The Highest in the Land, released after Pat’s death in late 2021. While Fish was the primary songwriter throughout their shared time together in the JBC, Eider typically scored a cut or two on each of their albums, plus a variety of B-sides and co-writes. Eider’s first solo album, The Best Kisser in the World, was released in 1987, and he’s issued four additional albums since then, plus some EPs and singles, as well as playing with David J on several touring and recording projects. His latest release, the EP All Shall Be Well, was issued earlier this year, featuring a new single and remixes of two earlier cuts. It’s delightful.\n\nWhen I First Heard Him: Some time in late 1984 or early 1985, when one of the DJ’s on Washington, DC’s formidable and much-lamented WHFS spun “Caroline Wheeler’s Birthday Present” from the JBC’s album A Scandal in Bohemia, the first to feature the Butch and Max and Dave and Jones line-up. I utterly adored that song, and quickly scored the record, the rest of which sounded not much like “Caroline” at all, but that was okay, because what it did sound like was just as grand, in different ways. A trio of songs on that album featured co-songwriting credits to Eider, one of which, “Just Like Betty Page,” featured my first exposure to what I came think of as Max’s sound: a brilliant cabaret pop confection with an exquisite guitar part, not jazz, exactly, but played with the precision and unique melodic and chordal traits associated with that genre, in macro. I hoovered up all of the JBC-related issues over the next few years, and around 1986, I scored a compilation called 50,000 Glass Fans Can’t Be Wrong, which featured the first solo Eider cut I heard, the utterly exquisite “It Has to Be You.” Max’s solo debut album came out the next year, featuring that Glass cut, and after Eider had left the JBC, though in those pre-Internet days, I’m not sure I realized he was gone until the next Jazz Butcher album, Fishcoteque, came out, and nobody except for Pat Fish remained from the group I had loved. While he’s not terribly prolific, I’ve snagged all of Max Eider’s releases over the years, always happy to have them, always awed by the quality of their contents.\n\nWhy I Love Him: Well, I suppose we must talk about the guitar first, because Max Eider is one of the finest practitioners of that instrument to be found in my vast collection. His signature axe has long been the Gretsch Double Anniversary semi-acoustic, and boy oh boy, can he make that thing sing, one of a small number of string-benders capable of elegantly communicating emotion and drama and pathos strictly through his instrumental prowess and extremely tasteful touch. As noted above, while Eider’s music is never quite jazz, it is quite jazzy in its structure and in the ways that Max’s rhythms and solos swing like nobody’s business, and feature chord and note progressions that are beautiful and intuitive, but rarely hew to any sort of stock cock rock or blues-based I-IV-V type progressions. During COVID times, Max released a series of videos of his home solo performances of various songs from his catalog, and as a (poor) guitarist, it made me goggle as I watched the shapes and forms he crafted on his fret board, well beyond anything I could ever conceive of, much less mimic. Technically incredible, and just as accessible, and that’s a rare combo platter in my experience.\n\nBeyond his maestro status on his chosen instrument, Eider is also a terrific songwriter and a fine singer, with a poignancy to his voice that perfectly suits the distinctive blend of melancholy and hopefulness that courses throughout his catalog. (He has long sung with the wonderful June Kingston Smith, and their voice blend is sublime). While he was undoubtedly a great foil for Pat Fish in the Jazz Butcher days, Eider is so much more than a side-man, and he’s one of those artists who I have admired for decades, wondering why he’s never broken bigger than Jesus, given his divine-caliber talents. Oh well, that doesn’t diminish my own enthusiasms for the musical gifts he shares with us, if we know where to look for them, and I am always happy to point new listeners his way. In my Top Ten Max Trax below, I’ve included a couple from the JBC days, but only when he was the sole songwriter and lead singer, as I do consider those to be a part of his creative canon, even if he didn’t get full front cover credit for them. Also note, a couple of these songs aren’t available on Youtube, where I normally source my samples, so I’ve linked to their Bandcamp pages. Even if you listen to the Youtube links, you should go buy at Bandcamp, as I do.\n\n#10. “D.R.I.N.K.,” from “Roadrunner” 12″ Single (1984), credited to The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy.\n\n#9. “INTP,” from Duckdance (2014)\n\n#8. “The Meek,” from “The Meek” single (2016); re-mixed/re-released on All Shall Be Well EP (2024)\n\n#7. “Sweet Nothing,” from Max Eider III: Back in the Bedroom (2007)\n\n“Sweet Nothing” at Bandcamp\n\n#6. “Analgesia,” from Disaffection (2010)\n\n#5. “Who Loves You Now?,” from Distressed Gentlefolk (1986), credited to The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy.\n\n#4. “My Other Life,” from The Best Kisser in the World (1987)\n\n#3. “Secret Life,” from Max Eider III: Back in the Bedroom (2007)\n\n“Secret Life” at Bandcamp\n\n#2. “Hotel Figueroa,” from Hotel Figueroa (2001)\n\n#1. “It Has to Be You,” from The Best Kisser in the World (1987)"
