        "text": "Carl Reiner is a legend of American comedy, who achieved great success as a comic actor, a director, producer and recording artist. He won nine Emmy Awards, three as an actor, four as a writer and two as a producer. He also won a Grammy Award for his album \"The 2,000 Year Old Man\", based on his comedy routine with Mel Brooks.\n\nReiner was born in The Bronx, to Bessie (Mathias) and Irving Reiner, a watchmaker. His father was an Austrian Jewish immigrant and his mother was a Romanian Jewish immigrant. At the age of sixteen, while working as a sewing machine repairman, he attended a dramatic workshop sponsored by the Works Progress Administration. The direction of his life was set.\n\nIn the 1970s, some sources claimed that Reiner made his movie debut in New Faces of 1937 (1937), but that is unlikely as he would have only been fifteen years old at the time. (the movie shares the same plot as his erstwhile partner Mel Brooks' classic Frühling für Hitler (1967), with a crooked producer planning to fleece his \"angels\" by producing a flop and absconding with the money). He didn't appear on screen, silver or small, until he made his television debut in 1948 in the short-lived television series, The Fashion Story (1948), then became a regular, the following year, on The Fifty-Fourth Street Revue (1949), another television series with a brief life.\n\nReiner made his Broadway debut in 1949 in the musical \"Inside U.S.A.\", a hit that ran for 399 performances. His next Broadway show, the musical revue \"Alive and Kicking\" (1950) was a flop, lasting just 43 performances. Max Liebman, the producer/director/writer/composer, had been called in to provide additional material after the show's troubled six week out-of-town preview in Boston. It didn't help -- the show closed after six weeks on Broadway -- but an important contact had been made.\n\nLeibman was a producer-director on Your Show of Shows (1950), one of the great television series, and he hired Reiner to appear on the show in the middle of its first season. Reiner's first gig on the revue-like show was interviewing The Professor, a character played by Sid Caesar. He became central to the comedy portions of the show and, in 1953, he racked up the first of six Emmy Award nominations for acting. (In all, he was nominated for an Emmy Award a total of 13 times). When, in 1954, \"Your Show of Shows\" was split up by the network into its constituent parts, Reiner continued on with Sid in Caesar's Hour (1954). (Imogene Coca was given her own show, which lasted one season, and Leibman was allowed to produce specials).\n\n\"Your Show or Shows\" had been a Broadway-style revue, featuring skits such as dancing (including a young Bob Fosse) whereas \"Caesar's Hour\" was pure comedy. \"Your Show of Shows\" had had a great cast, another other than Coca, most of the cast, including Reiner, Howard Morris, and Nanette Fabray (who went on to win an Emmy Award) moved over to \"Caesar's Hour\". In his three seasons on the show, he was nominated three more times for an Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actor, winning twice in 1957 and 1958. But it was its stable of comedy writers that was essential to the great success of both \"Your Show of Shows\" and \"Caesar's Hour\". In addition to Mel Brooks, the writing staff included Neil Simon, his brother Danny Simon, Larry Gelbart and Mel Tolkin. (There are rumors that the young Woody Allen served as the writing staff's typist).\n\nReiner had sat in informally with the writers during \"Your Show of Shows\", but he began writing formally for \"Caesar's Hour\", having learned his craft from all of the other writers. As a self-described uncredited \"writer without portfolio\", he was able to leave writers' meetings at 6 P.M., if he wanted to. This gave him the time to work on a semi-autobiographical novel. Published in 1958, Sein grosser Auftritt (1967) is about a young man in 1930s New York trying to make it in show business. It was transformed into a play and, eventually, adapted into a movie in 1967, and a musical, many years later.\n\nIn 1959, he created the pilot for a television series, \"Man of the House\", in which he would play a writer, Rob Petrie, who balanced his family life with the demands of working as a writer for a comedy show headlined by an egotistical comedic genius modeled after Sid Caesar (a \"benign despot\" who lacked social skills, according to Reiner). The series was rooted in his experience on \"Your Show of Shows\" and \"Caesar's Hour\". The network didn't pick up the pilot at first, as CBS executives claimed the main character, which was clearly autobiographical on Reiner's part, was too New York, too Jewish and too intellectual. In 1960, Reiner teamed up with Mel Brooks on The Steve Allen Show (1956), and their routine \"The 2000 Year Old Man\" was a huge success. Reiner played the straight man to Brooks in the routine, which was spun-off into five comedy albums, bringing them a Grammy Award. They also made an animated television special based on their shtick in 1975.\n\nThough CBS turned down \"Man of the House\", with the two-time Emmy Award-winning comedian Reiner as the lead, it was still interested in the series. However, they wanted a different actor in the lead role, and the casting of the protagonist came down to Johnny Carson and Dick Van Dyke. Carson was a game show host of no great note at the time, but Van Dyke was in the smash Broadway musical Bye Bye Birdie (1963), for which he won a Tony Award. He got the role and another chapter of television history was made, when Mary Tyler Moore, Rose Marie and Morey Amsterdam all were cast in leading roles. Reiner, himself, would eventually play the role of Alan Brady, the abrasive Sid Caesar-like comic convinced of his own genius, in the last few seasons of the series' five-year run.\n\nAnother milestone in television comedy, Dick van Dyke Show (1961), brought Reiner five more Emmy Awards, three for writing and two as the producer of the series. In 1966, Reiner and the other principals, including executive producer Sheldon Leonard and Dick Van Dyke, decided to end the series at the height of its popularity and critical acclaim. (The show won Emmy Awards as best show and best comedy in 1965 and 1966, respectively). Twenty-nine years after the show was ended, Reiner reprised the role of Alan Brady on Verrückt nach dir (1992), winning his eighth (and so far, last) Emmy Award, this time as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.\n\nIt was on \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" that Reiner first became a director. His feature film debut, as a director, was with the film adaptation of the play Joseph Stein had adapted from his 1958 novel, Sein grosser Auftritt (1967). His work as a writer-director, with Dick Van Dyke, in creating a Stan Laurel-type character in Der Komiker (1969) was not a success, but Wo is' Papa? (1970) became a cult classic and Oh, Gott (1977), with George Burns, and Reichtum ist keine Schande (1979), with Steve Martin, were smash hits. The last film he directed was the romantic comedy Noch einmal mit Gefühl (1997).\n\nReiner's career continued into the 21st century, when most of his contemporaries had retired or passed. He was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 2000 and acted in the remake of Ocean's Eleven (2001) and its two sequels. He also appeared as a voice artist in the film In tierischer Mission (2003), and the animated series The Cleveland Show (2009) (he even wrote an episode for the series rooted in his \"Your Show of Shows\" experience). He was also a regular on the series Hot in Cleveland (2010) (with fellow nonagenarian Betty White), and appeared on an episode of Parks and Recreation (2009) in 2012. His last film role was as the voice of Carl Reineroceros in A Toy Story: Alles hört auf kein Kommando (2019), opposite his old compatriot Mel Brooks.\n\nCarl Reiner died at age 98 of natural causes on June 29, 2020, in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nJames Lipton was an actor, academic, author, choreographer, interviewer, scriptwriter, and producer for stage and television projects. He was known for creating and hosting the noted and popular TV series Inside the Actors Studio (1994), where successful and prominent actors discussed their craft for the benefit of acting students.\n\nJames Lipton was born Louis James Lipton in Detroit, Michigan, to Betty (Weinberg), a teacher and librarian, and Lawrence Lipton (originally Israel Lipschitz), a writer and beatnik poet. His father was a Polish Jewish emigrant, from Lodz, and his maternal grandparents were Russian Jews. Lipton's parents divorced when he was quite young. As a reaction against his beatnik father's anarchic and chaotic lifestyle, Lipton at first chose to pursue a stable and staid career as a lawyer. He originally took up acting as a sideline to finance his law studies but eventually he shifted the focus of his career to acting.\n\nLipton moved to New York City and undertook twelve years of intensive studies in the performing arts. He studied acting and directing under Stella Adler, widely regarded as the most respected acting teacher in the history of American dramatic arts. Adler's other students at various times have included Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel. Lipton also studied with Harold Clurman and Robert Lewis. He studied movie/TV production and directing at New York University and at The New School. He also studied voice, modern dance, classical ballet, and jazz technique.\n\nLipton performed in the play \"The Autumn Garden\" on Broadway in 1951. He became active in several TV soap operas, joining the cast of Springfield Story (1952) where he acted and wrote scripts for several years and later became head writer, all while undertaking his formal acting studies. He was a scriptwriter for The Edge of Night (1956) and he became head writer for Another World (1964), The Best of Everything (1970), Return to Peyton Place (1972) and Capitol (1982).\n\nLipton wrote the book and the lyrics for the Broadway flop \"Nowhere to Go But Up\" (1962), and he did the same for \"Sherry!\" which was produced on stage in 1967 and released as an audio CD in 2004. Also for Broadway, he produced \"The Mighty Gents\" (1978), \"Monteith & Rand\" (1979) and co-produced the Tony award-winning \"Ain't Misbehavin'\" (1978). He choreographed \"Charlot\" for ballet theater, and for Moliere's play \"The Doctor In Spite of Himself\" he translated from the original French, adapted it as a musical version, wrote the lyrics, directed and choreographed.\n\nA lover of words, Lipton has made a study of group terms, sometimes called nouns of multitude (examples: a gaggle of geese, a host of angels, etc.). He has published the definitive work on the subject in a best-selling book titled \"An Exaltation of Larks\". It has been in print continuously since its first edition in 1968. The latest edition, now expanded, contains over 1,100 such phrases. In the book Lipton himself jumps into the lexical fray by offering many new terms of his own invention, including: a score of bachelors, an unction of undertakers, a shrivel of critics, and a queue of actors. Other writings of his have appeared in Newsweek, The New York Times Magazine and The Paris Review.\n\nIn 1983 Lipton published his novel \"Mirrors\" which is about the lives of dancers. He later wrote and produced it as a TV movie. In television, Lipton has produced some two dozen specials including: twelve Bob Hope Birthday Specials; Bob Hope on the Road to China (1979) , an NBC entertainment special produced in China; and the first time ever televised presidential inaugural gala, for Jimmy Carter.\n\nIn the mid-1990s Lipton sought to create a three year educational program for actors that would be a distillation of what he had learned in the twelve years of his own intensive studies. In 1994 he arranged for the Actors Studio -- the home base of \"method acting\" in the USA for some sixty years now -- to join with New York City's New School University, to form the Actors Studio Drama School, a formal degree-granting program at the graduate level.\n\nAt the same time, Lipton created a sub-project within the drama school: a non-credit class called Inside the Actors Studio (1994) where successful and accomplished actors, directors and writers would be interviewed and would answer questions from acting students. These sessions were also taped and broadcast on television for the general public to see. Lipton himself hosts the show and conducts the main interview.\n\nThe TV show Inside the Actors Studio (1994) has become a substantial success. In the more than 12 years that it has been on the air, the craft of acting has been discussed by the show's over 200 guests who have included Paul Newman, Barbra Streisand, Harrison Ford, Tom Cruise, Meryl Streep, Angelina Jolie, Robert De Niro, Francis Ford Coppola, Kate Winslet, Steven Spielberg, Spike Lee, Charlize Theron, Robin Williams, Gwyneth Paltrow, Anthony Hopkins, Samuel L. Jackson, Johnny Depp, Morgan Freeman, Al Pacino, Cate Blanchett, Martin Scorsese and Dustin Hoffman. The show is viewed in 80 million homes in the USA on the Bravo cable channel and is seen in 125 countries. It has been nominated for 12 Emmy awards. The Actors Studio Drama School performed very well also. During Lipton's term as dean, the school became the largest graduate-level drama school in the United States.\n\nImportant changes began in 2004 for both the TV show and the drama school. The New School underwent a major reorganization and seriously cut back its support for drama education. The Actors Studio's collaboration with the New School came to an end and a new drama school as well as a new venue for the TV show were both set up at Pace University, also in New York City.\n\nLipton's TV show made him so famous that he was frequently parodied on Saturday Night Live (1975) by comic Will Ferrell. Lipton continued to host and produce Inside the Actors Studio (1994), and served as a vice president of the Actors Studio. He held the lifelong title of Dean Emeritus of the Actors Studio Drama Program. In 2007, he wrote a book about the TV show and his life, which was titled \"Inside Inside.\"\n\nThe last episode of Inside he hosted aired on January 11, 2018, with Ted Danson as guest. The show began rotating hosts in its 2019 season. James Lipton died on March 2, 2020, in Manhattan. He was survived by wife Kedaki Turner.\n\nAs the short, straight-man counterpart of the stellar husband-and-wife comedy team \"Stiller & Meara\", Jerry Stiller and wife Anne Meara were on top of the comedy game in the 1960s, a steady and hilarious presence on television variety, notably Toast of the Town (1948), on which they appeared 36 times. Decades later, Jerry's career was revitalized in the role of the raucous, gasket-blowing Frank Costanza on the sitcom classic Seinfeld (1989).\n\nJerry Stiller was born Gerald Isaac Stiller in the Unity Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, to Bella (Citron) and William Stiller, a bus driver. His paternal grandparents were Jewish emigrants from Galicia, and his mother was a Polish Jewish emigrant, from Frampol. In the beginning, Stiller was a drama major at the Syracuse University. Though he had played rather uneducated, blue-collar sorts for most of his career, he received his Bachelor of Science in Speech and Drama before making his acting debut on stage with Burgess Meredith in \"The Silver Whistle\" in 1951. While a member of the improvisational team The Compass Players (the company later evolved into the well-known Second City troupe), he met Anne.\n\nThey married in 1954 and began touring together on the national club circuit while giving new and inventive meaning to the term spousal comedy. This led to television prominence on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", \"The Tonight Show\", \"The Steve Allen Comedy Hour\", \"The Merv Griffin Show\", as well as game shows \"He Said, She Said\", \"You're Putting Me On\" and \"What's My Line?\" as well as other talk/comedy venues.\n\nAfter well over a decade of fame together, they decided to pursue individual successes and both found it. A Broadway favorite in such shows as \"Hurlyburly\", \"The Ritz\" (he later recreated his hilarious mobster family member role in the film Der Mörder lauert in der Sauna (1976)), \"The Golden Apple\", \"Three Men on a Horse\", \"What's Wrong with This Picture\" and \"The Three Sisters\", Stiller even appeared with Kevin Kline and Blythe Danner as Dogberry in William Shakespeare's \"Much Ado About Nothing\" in 1988. Musicals were not out of his range, either, as he created the role of Launce in \"Two Gentlemen of Verona\" and co-starred as Nathan Detroit in a production of \"Guys and Dolls\". Although he kept afloat on television as a 1970s regular on The Paul Lynde Show (1972) and Joe and Sons (1975), he had some rocky years and Anne's pilot fizzled when they reunited for a possible \"Stiller & Meara\" sitcom.\n\nThen came eight seasons as hypertensive Frank Costanza and his character star was reborn. Nominated for a 1997 Emmy Award and the recipient of the 1998 American Comedy Award, Stiller found back-to-back sitcom hits with King of Queens (1998) as the irascible Arthur Spooner. He also appeared in a number of his successful son Ben Stiller's comedy pictures including Pfundskerle (1995), Zoolander (2001), Nach 7 Tagen - Ausgeflittert (2007) and Zoolander 2 (2016)\n\nInto the millennium, Jerry has appeared in a number of independent films, including a starring role as a low-level director seeking a comeback in the comedy King of B-Movies (2000); had a cameo in the off-color Rodney Dangerfield slapstick farce My 5 Wives (2000); played the slick Mr. Pinky in the film version of the Broadway musical hit Hairspray (2007); and featured roles in the romantic comedies Swinging with the Finkels (2011) and Excuse Me for Living (2012).\n\nDaughter Amy Stiller is also a thriving actress. He and Anne wrote, performed and produced award-winning radio commercials together for such products as Blue Nun Wine, United Van Lines and Amalgamated Bank, among others. His autobiography \"Married to Laughter\" came out in 2000. Stiller's wife Anne passed away on May 23, 2015, and he passed away nearly five years later, on May 11, 2020, at age 92.\n\nJohn Saxon appeared in nearly 200 roles in the movies and on television in a more-than half-century-long career that has stretched over seven decades since he made his big screen debut in 1954 in uncredited small roles in Die unglaubliche Geschichte der Gladys Glover (1954) and George Cukor's Ein neuer Stern am Himmel (1954). Born Carmine Orrico on August 5, 1936 in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Italian-American parents, Antonio Orrico and Anna (née Protettore), he studied acting with Stella Adler after graduating from New Utrecht High School.\n\nHe was discovered by talent agent Henry Willson, the man most famous for creating and representing Rock Hudson (as well as a stable of \"beefcake\" male stars and starlets), who signed him up after he saw Saxon's picture on the cover of a magazine. Willson brought the 16-year-old to Southern California, changed his name to John Saxon, and launched his career. Saxon made his television debut on Richard Boone's series Medic (1954) in 1955 and got his first substantial (and credited) role in Running Wild (1955), playing a juvenile delinquent. In the Esther Williams vehicle In den Fängen des Teufels (1956) (one of her rare dramatic roles), the film's marketing campaign spotlighted him, trumpeting the movie as \"Co-starring the exciting new personality John Saxon.\".\n\nBy 1958, he seemed to have established himself as a supporting player in A-List pictures, being featured in Blake Edwards's comedy Männer über Vierzig (1958) headlined by Debbie Reynolds and Vincente Minnelli's Was weiß Mama von Liebe? (1958) with Rex Harrison and Sandra Dee. In the next five years, he worked steadily, including supporting roles in John Huston's Denen man nicht vergibt (1960), the James Stewart comedy Mr. Hobbs macht Ferien (1962) and Otto Preminger's Der Kardinal (1963) while having first billing in the B-movies Cry Tough (1959) and Hinter feindlichen Linien (1962). Fluent in Italian, he made his first pictures in Italy in the period, Agostino (1962) and Mario Bava's La ragazza che sapeva troppo (1963). Despite his good work with major directors, he failed to succeed as a star.\n\nBy 1965, he was appearing in the likes of The Night Caller (1965), albeit, top-billed. A more emblematic picture was Sidney J. Furie's Südwest nach Sonora (1966), in which he appeared in Mexican bandito drag as the man who steals the horse of Marlon Brando, another Stella Adler student. Saxon would reprise the role, of sorts, in John Sturges Sinola (1972) in support of superstar Clint Eastwood. In those less politically correct times, many an Italian-American with a dark complexion would be relied on to play Mexicans, Native Americans and other \"exotic\" types like Mongols. Saxon played everything from an Indian chief on Bonanza (1959) to Marco Polo on Time Tunnel (1966).\n\nFrom 1969 to 1972 season, he was a star of the television series The Bold Ones: The New Doctors (1969), playing the brilliant surgeon Theodore Stuart. When the series ended, he took one of his most famous roles when Bruce Lee demurred over casting Rod Taylor as he was too tall. A black belt in karate, Saxon appeared as Roper in Der Mann mit der Todeskralle (1973). He continued to play a wide variety of roles on television and in motion pictures, with key roles in 1974's classic slasher Jessy - Die Treppe in den Tod (1974), 1984's groundbreaking Nightmare - Mörderische Träume (1984), and the 1990s self-referential horror films Freddy's New Nightmare (1994) and From Dusk Till Dawn (1996).\n\nJohn Saxon died of pneumonia on July 25, 2020, in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. He was 83.\n\nCleft-chinned, steely-eyed and virile star of international cinema who rose from being \"the ragman's son\" (the name of his best-selling 1988 autobiography) to become a bona fide superstar, Kirk Douglas, also known as Issur Danielovitch Demsky, was born on December 9, 1916 in Amsterdam, New York. His parents, Bryna (Sanglel) and Herschel Danielovitch, were Jewish immigrants from Chavusy, Mahilyow Voblast (now in Belarus). Although growing up in a poor ghetto, Douglas was a fine student and a keen athlete and wrestled competitively during his time at St. Lawrence University. Professional wrestling helped pay for his studies as did working on the side as a waiter and a bellboy. However, he soon identified an acting scholarship as a way out of his meager existence, and was sufficiently talented to gain entry into the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He made his Broadway debut in \"Spring Again\" before his career was interrupted by World War II. He joining the United States Navy in 1941, and then after the end of hostilities in 1945, returned to the theater and some radio work. On the insistence of ex-classmate Lauren Bacall, movie producer Hal B. Wallis screen-tested Douglas and cast him in the lead role in Die seltsame Liebe der Martha Ivers (1946). His performance received rave reviews and further work quickly followed, including an appearance in the low-key drama 14 Jahre Sing-Sing (1947), the first time he worked alongside fellow future screen legend Burt Lancaster. Such was the strong chemistry between the two that they appeared in seven films together, including the dynamic western Zwei rechnen ab (1957), the John Frankenheimer political thriller Sieben Tage im Mai (1964) and their final pairing in the gangster comedy Archie und Harry - Sie können's nicht lassen (1986). Douglas once said about his good friend: \"I've finally gotten away from Burt Lancaster. My luck has changed for the better. I've got nice-looking girls in my films now.\"\n\nAfter appearing in \"I Walk Alone,\" Douglas scored his first Oscar nomination playing the untrustworthy and opportunistic boxer Midge Kelly in the gripping Zwischen Frauen und Seilen (1949). The quality of his work continued to garner the attention of critics and he was again nominated for Oscars for his role as a film producer in Stadt der Illusionen (1952) and as tortured painter Vincent van Gogh in Vincent van Gogh - Ein Leben in Leidenschaft (1956), both directed by Vincente Minnelli. In 1955, Douglas launched his own production company, Bryna Productions, the company behind two pivotal film roles in his career. The first was as French army officer Col. Dax in director Stanley Kubrick's brilliant anti-war epic Wege zum Ruhm (1957). Douglas reunited with Kubrick for yet another epic, the magnificent Spartacus (1960). The film also marked a key turning point in the life of screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, who had been blacklisted during the McCarthy \"Red Scare\" hysteria in the 1950s. At Douglas' insistence, Trumbo was given on-screen credit for his contributions, which began the dissolution of the infamous blacklisting policies begun almost a decade previously that had destroyed so many careers and lives.\n\nDouglas remained busy throughout the 1960s, starring in many films. He played a rebellious modern-day cowboy in Einsam sind die Tapferen (1962), acted alongside John Wayne in the World War II story Erster Sieg (1965), again with The Duke in a drama about the Israeli fight for independence, Der Schatten des Giganten (1966), and once more with Wayne in the tongue-in-cheek western Die Gewaltigen (1967). Additionally in 1963, he starred in an onstage production of Ken Kesey's \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" but despite his keen interest, no Hollywood studio could be convinced to bring the story to the screen. However, the rights remained with the Douglas clan, and Kirk's talented son Michael Douglas finally filmed the tale in 1975, starring Jack Nicholson. Into the 1970s, Douglas wasn't as busy as previous years; however, he starred in some unusual vehicles, including alongside a young Arnold Schwarzenegger in the loopy western comedy Kaktus Jack (1979), then with Farrah Fawcett in the sci-fi thriller Saturn-City (1980) and then he traveled to Australia for the horse opera/drama Snowy River (1982).\n\nUnknown to many, Kirk has long been involved in humanitarian causes and has been a Goodwill Ambassador for the US State Department since 1963. His efforts were rewarded with the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1981), and with the Jefferson Award (1983). Furthermore, the French honored him with the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. More recognition followed for his work with the American Cinema Award (1987), the German Golden Kamera Award (1987), The National Board of Reviews Career Achievement Award (1989), an honorary Academy Award (1995), Recipient of the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award (1999) and the UCLA Medal of Honor (2002). Despite a helicopter crash and a stroke suffered in the 1990s, he remained active and continued to appear in front of the camera. Until his passing on February 5 2020 at the age of 103, he and Olivia de Havilland were the last surviving major stars from the Golden Years of Hollywood.\n\nBorn in Houston, Texas on August 21, 1938, Grammy-winning singer, songwriter, actor, record producer and entrepreneur Kenneth Ray Rogers was the fourth of eight children born to a carpenter father who worked in a shipyard and a mother who was a hospital nurse's assistant. Of humble Irish and Native American heritage, the boy grew up in the poorer section of Houston, but would become the first member of his family to graduate from high school.\n\nKenny took an early interest in singing and, as a teenager, joined a doo-wop recording group called \"The Scholars\". The group recorded the song \"Poor Little Doggie,\" and Kenny, age 19, recorded his first solo song, \"That Crazy Feeling,\" for a small Houston label, Carlton Records, and his career was off and running. He subsequently joined the \"New Christy Minstrels\" 1966 as a singer and double bass/bass guitar player, then splintered off with others from the popular folk music group a year later to form the rock group \"The First Edition,\" an eclectic-styled rock band whose repertoire included rock and roll, R&B, folk and country.\n\nThe First Edition's first Billboard hit, \"Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)\" (1968) was a psychedelic rock song which peaked at #5, and was followed by the more popular soft-rock hit \"Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town\" (1969) which hit #6 on the US charts and made them a star attraction. Other successes would include \"Reuben James\" (1969, #26), \"Something's Burning\" (1970, #11) and \"Tell It All Brother\" (1970, #17). By this time, the dark-haired, husky-framed, ear-pierced singer's ingratiating personality and sensual gravel tones, affectionately dubbed \"Hippie Kenny,\" had taken center stage and the group changed their name to \"Kenny Rogers and the First Edition\" in 1969. The First Edition enjoyed worldwide success, appeared on such popular shows as \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,\" had featured roles in the TV movie The Dream Makers (1975) and went on to host the syndicated TV variety series Rollin' on the River (1971).\n\nSadly, the pressures of taping a weekly show caused extreme friction within the group and eventually took its toll. After a couple more years of producing songs that couldn't reach the \"Top 20,\" the group decided to disband in 1976 and, inevitable as it was, Kenny went solo. It didn't take long before he started chalking up a string of country-tinged 'Top 20' pop hits with \"Lucille\" (#5), \"Don't Fall in Love With a Dreamer\" (#4, with Kim Carnes), \"Through the Years\" (#13), \"We've Got Tonight\" (#6, with Sheena Easton) and his two #1 hit sellers \"Islands in the Stream\" (with Dolly Parton) and \"Lady.\" By the late 1970s, the (now) silver fox had sold over $100 million worth of records. He also made popular hit duets with both country female stars (Parton and Dottie West) as well as the distaff pop elite (Kim Carnes and Sheena Easton).\n\nInto the 1980's Kenny began to feel a downswing in his singing career. After charting lower and lower, he wisely branched off into other successful areas. In 1980, he touched off a modest, lightweight, but highly appealing acting career starting with the Southern-styled TV-movie Kenny Rogers as The Gambler (1980), based on his #1 1979 Grammy-winning song hit. The feature had Kenny starring as poker-playing card shark Brady Hawkes, who attempts to unite with a son he never knew. This led to four equally popular sequels -- Beste Spieler weit und breit - Sein größtes Abenteuer (1983), Kenny Rogers as The Gambler, Part III: The Legend Continues (1987), Der beste Spieler weit und breit - Sein höchster Einsatz (1991) and Das Gesetz im Nacken (1994). Two other old-fashioned western TV movies followed. The first was also based on a hit Kenny Rogers song, Tag des Zorns (1981), (Country, #3) in which he played a town preacher who tries to mentor his young \"cowardly\" nephew. The second, Wilde Mustangs (1985), had him starring as a has-been rodeo champion looking for personal fulfillment herding wild mustangs.\n\nKenny also tried to parlay his popularity as a major country singer into a conservative film career. There would only be one starring role. In Six Pack (1982), Kenny stars as a race car driver who tangles with six roughhouse orphans. Instead, he was back to TV-movies where he went on to appear as himself in two TV country-flavored biopics -- Big Dreams & Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story (1995) and Get to the Heart: The Barbara Mandrell Story (1997). He also put out the folksy yuletide offering Christmas in America (1990) which had his real-life son Kenneth Rogers co-starring in a father-son strained relationship; and the western Rio Diablo (1993) in which he he essays the role of a nice-guy bounty hunter assisting a revengeful groom country singer Travis Tritt in a search for of kidnapped bride. Another then-reigning country star, Naomi Judd, was featured as a colorful madam.\n\nIn addition to a few acting appearances on TV with \"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,\" \"Touched by an Angel\" and \"How I Met Your Mother,\" Kenny also became a perennial star or guest of TV specials and seasonal events over the years, including Kenny Rogers and the First Edition: Rollin' on the River (1971), A Christmas Special... With Love, Mac Davis (1979), Kenny Rogers Live in Concert (1983), Kenny & Dolly: A Christmas to Remember (1984), Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton Together (1985), Kenny, Dolly and Willie: Something Inside So Strong (1989), Kenny Rogers Going Home (1995), Live by Request: Kenny Rogers (1999) and Consequence (2007). He also hosted two TV documentary series: The Real West (1992) and High Point Casinos of the World (2003).\n\nIn addition, Kenny published several books on photography and opened a rotisserie-chicken fast-food franchise (Kenny Rogers Roasters). Less and less visible in the ensuing years, Kenny produced the 1999 album \"She Rides Wild Horses\", which peaked at #6 on the country charts, his highest in 15 years, and included the #1 single \"Buy Me a Rose.\"\n\nSpending much of his free time over the years breeding Arabian horses and cattle on a 1,200-acre Georgia farm, Kenny's seemed to settle with his fifth wife Wanda Miller, whom he married in 1997. He had five children altogether and his namesake, son, Kenneth Rogers, left acting and briefly launched his own singing career in 1989 with \"Take Another Step Closer\". He now is on the business end of entertainment providing music for TV and movies.\n\nKenny made one last concert tour, \"The Gambler's Last Deal,\" in 2015 and it was running worldwide, with visits including Australia, Scotland, Ireland, England, The Netherlands and Switzerland, as well as the U.S., until his health, plagued by bouts of bladder cancer and hepatitis C, failed him and he was forced to retire in 2018. The 81-year-old legend died on March 20, 2020, under hospice care at his home in Sandy Springs, Georgia.\n\nAt his best playing blue-collared tough guys, curly dark-haired Irish-American actor Kevin Patrick Dobson was born in Queens, New York, on March 18, 1943, and raised in the Jackson Heights area of that borough. One of seven children born to a school janitor father and a homemaker mother, the future actor worked as a trainman, brakeman and conductor for the LIRR (Long Island Rail Road) before deciding to pursue his acting interests.\n\nToiling as a waiter/bartender at a restaurant owned by relatives, Dobson's first on-camera viewings began in 1969 on a daytime soap opera, playing various bit parts as cops, orderlies and intern types on The Doctors (1963). Following an unbilled bit in the detective film Klute (1971), he gravitated more and more towards TV. In the early 1970's he was spotted here and there on such popular crime shows as \"The Mod Squad\", \"The Rookies\", \"Ironside\", \"Cannon\", and \"Police Story\". This led to his pivotal role as young, eager Det. Bobby Crocker on Einsatz in Manhattan (1973). He remained with the series throughout its five seasons. In between, he landed a featured role in the film Schlacht um Midway (1976), and earned a top-billed role in the TV movie Stranded (1976) as one of a group of airplane passengers marooned on a deserted island following a crash.\n\nA revolving series of starring roles in TV movies came Dobson's way following Einsatz in Manhattan (1973), including Transplant (1979) (starring as a workaholic exec risking a major heart operation); Waisen ohne Hoffnung (1979) (with Jill Eikenberry, as a couple involved in the titled NYC movement and welfare program in the 1850s); Liebe nach Feierabend (1980) (a Gordon/Kanin romantic comedy co-starring Sharon Gless); Reunion (1980) (as a married man tempted at a high school reunion); Mark, I Love You (1980) (as a widower having to fight his late wife's parents for child custody); and Mörderische Geschäfte (1981) (a Mike Hammer noirish mystery). He was also unsympathetically featured as Barbra Streisand's abusive husband in Jede Nacht zählt (1981).\n\nKevin found another crimes series in the early 1980s to star in as the title San Francisco police officer in the short-lived Shannon (1981), which was immediately followed by a second best-remembered series, as federal prosecutor Mack McKenzie, who marries Michele Lee's Karen Fairgate, on the popular night-time soap opera Unter der Sonne Kaliforniens (1979). Dobson copped five Soap Opera Digest Awards for his work on this series. In between the eleven seasons was a reunion Kojak TV movie as (now) Asst. D.A. Bobby Crocker in Gefährliche Gier (1990); plus other mini-movie leads in Mörderische News (1989), Der Fremdgeher - Eine Ehefrau rechnet ab (1992) and Mord aus Überzeugung (1993), as well as another detective role in the first season of F/X (1996)\n\nDobson began his career on stage, first with the 1968 national tour of \"The Impossible Years\". He later served on the board of Lonny Chapman's Group Repertory Theatre company in North Hollywood, where he often directed and acted. Live theatre highlights include Chicago's Royal George Theatre production of the Tony Award-winning play \"Art,\" as well as originating the role of Steve Gallop in the world premiere mounting of the 2000 play, \"If It was Easy\" in Atlanta. He co-starred with Richard Thomas in Roundabout Theatre Company's 2009 national tour of \"12 Angry Men\".\n\nInto the millennium, Dobson returned full circle to his daytime soap opera roots with roles as Governor Harrison Brooks on Liebe, Lüge, Leidenschaft (1968) and Judge Devin Owens on Reich und schön (1987). He would also be the fourth actor taking over the role of Mickey Horton on Zeit der Sehnsucht (1965). Parts in independent films also came to be with leads in the thriller Trügerisches Glück (2002) opposite Tracey Gold and the mystery drama The Representative (2011), plus featured roles in Crash Landing (2005), Zimmer 1408 (2007), April Moon (2007) and Dark Power (2013). He later guested on such Tv series as \"Nash Bridges\", \"Cold Case\", \"CSI\", \"Hawaii Five-0\", and \"Anger Management\".\n\nA U.S. Army military policeman and proud veteran, Dobson served twice as chairman of the National Salute To Hospitalized Veterans. Married to wife Susan since 1968 and the father of three children (Sean, Patrick and Mariah), Dobson died on September 6, 2020, aged 77, after suffering a heart attack.\n\nOlivia Mary de Havilland was born on July 1, 1916 in Tokyo, Japan to British parents, Lilian Augusta (Ruse), a former actress, and Walter Augustus de Havilland, an English professor and patent attorney. Her sister Joan, later to become famous as Joan Fontaine, was born the following year. Her surname comes from her paternal grandfather, whose family was from Guernsey in the Channel Islands. Her parents divorced when Olivia was just three years old, and she moved with her mother and sister to Saratoga, California.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, where she fell prey to the acting bug, Olivia enrolled in Mills College in Oakland, where she participated in the school play \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" and was spotted by Max Reinhardt. She so impressed Reinhardt that he picked her up for both his stage version and, later, the Warner Bros. film version in 1935. She again was so impressive that Warner executives signed her to a seven-year contract. No sooner had the ink dried on the contract than Olivia appeared in three more films: The Irish in Us (1935), Alibi Ike (1935), and Unter Piratenflagge (1935), this last with the man with whom her career would be most closely identified: heartthrob Errol Flynn. He and Olivia starred together in eight films during their careers. In 1939 Warner Bros. loaned her to David O. Selznick for the classic Vom Winde verweht (1939). Playing sweet Melanie Hamilton, Olivia received her first nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, only to lose out to one of her co-stars in the film, Hattie McDaniel.\n\nAfter GWTW, Olivia returned to Warner Bros. and continued to churn out films. In 1941 she played Emmy Brown in Erwachen in der Dämmerung (1941), which resulted in her second Oscar nomination, this time for Best Actress. Again she lost, this time to her sister Joan for her role in Verdacht (1941). After that strong showing, Olivia now demanded better, more substantial roles than the \"sweet young thing\" slot into which Warners had been fitting her. The studio responded by placing her on a six-month suspension, all of the studios at the time operating under the policy that players were nothing more than property to do with as they saw fit. As if that weren't bad enough, when her contract with Warners was up, she was told that she needed to make up the time lost because of the suspension. Irate, she sued the studio, and for the length of the court battle she didn't appear in a single film. The result, however, was worth it. In a landmark decision, the court said that not only would Olivia not need to make up the time, but also that all performers would be limited to a seven-year contract that would include any suspensions handed down. This became known as the \"de Havilland decision\": no longer could studios treat their performers as chattel. Olivia returned to the screen in 1946 and made up for lost time by appearing in four films, one of which finally won her the Oscar that had so long eluded her: Mutterherz (1946), in which she played Josephine Norris to the delight of critics and audiences alike. Olivia was the strongest performer in Hollywood for the balance of the 1940s.\n\nIn 1948 she turned in another strong showing in Die Schlangengrube (1948) as Virginia Cunningham, a woman suffering a mental breakdown. The end result was another Oscar nomination for Best Actress, but she lost to Jane Wyman in Schweigende Lippen (1948). As in the two previous years, she made only one film in 1949, but she again won a nomination and the Academy Award for Best Actress for Die Erbin (1949). After a three-year hiatus, Olivia returned to star in Meine Cousine Rachel (1952). From that point on, she made few appearances on the screen but was seen on Broadway and in some television shows. Her last screen appearance was in Das Geheimnis der eisernen Maske (1979), and her last career appearance was in the TV movie König ihres Herzens (1988).\n\nHer turbulent relationship with her only sibling, Joan Fontaine, was press fodder for many decades; the two were reported as having been permanently estranged since their mother's death in 1975, when Joan claimed that she had not been invited to the memorial service, which she only managed to hold off until she could arrive by threatening to go public. Joan also wrote in her memoir that her elder sister had been physically, psychologically, and emotionally abusive when they were young. And the iconic photo of Joan with her hand outstretched to congratulate Olivia backstage after the latter's first Oscar win and Olivia ignoring it because she was peeved by a comment Joan had made about Olivia's new husband, Marcus Goodrich, remained part of Hollywood lore for many years.\n\nNonetheless, late in life, Fontaine gave an interview in which she serenely denied any and all claims of an estrangement from her sister. When a reporter asked Joan if she and Olivia were friends, she replied, \"Of course!\" The reporter responded that rumors to the contrary must have been sensationalism and she replied, \"Oh, right--they have to. Two nice girls liking each other isn't copy.\" Asked if she and Olivia were in communication and spoke to each other, Joan replied \"Absolutely.\" When asked if there ever had been a time when the two did not get along to the point where they wouldn't speak with one another, Joan replied, again, \"Never. Never. There is not a word of truth about that.\" When asked why people believe it, she replied \"Oh, I have no idea. It's just something to say ... Oh, it's terrible.\" When asked if she had seen Olivia over the years, she replied, \"I've seen her in Paris. And she came to my apartment in New York often.\" The reporter stated that all this was a nice thing to hear. Joan then stated, \"Let me just say, Olivia and I have never had a quarrel. We have never had any dissatisfaction. We have never had hard words. And all this is press.\" Joan died in 2013.\n\nDuring the hoopla surrounding the 50th anniversary of GWTW in 1989, Olivia graciously declined requests for all interviews as the last of the four main stars. She enjoyed a quiet retirement in Paris, France, where she resided for many decades, and where she died on 26 July, 2020, at the age of 104.\n\nAs well as being the last surviving major cast member of some of cinema's most beloved pre-war and wartime film classics (including Die Abenteuer des Robin Hood (1938) and Vom Winde verweht (1939)), and one of the longest-lived major stars in film history, Olivia de Havilland was unquestionably the last surviving iconic figure from the peak of Hollywood's golden era during the late 1930s, and her passing truly marked the end of an era.\n\nOrson Bean, the American actor, television personality and author, was born Dallas Frederick Burrows on July 22, 1928 in Burlington, Vermont to George Frederick Burrows, a policeman who later went on to become the chief of campus police at Harvard University, and the former Marion Ainsworth Pollard. He was of Irish, Scottish, and English descent. Through the latter, the newborn Dallas Burrows was a first cousin, twice removed, to Calvin Coolidge, who was President of the United States at the time of his birth. The young Dallas, an amateur magician with a taste for the limelight, graduated from Boston's prestigious Latin School in 1946. Too young to see military service during World War II, the future Orson Bean did a hitch in the U.S. Army (1946-47) in occupied Japan.\n\nAfter the war, he launched himself onto the nightclub circuit with his new moniker, the \"Orson\" borrowed from reigning enfant terrible Orson Welles. His comedy act premiered at New York City's Blue Angel nightclub, and the momentum from his act launched him into the orbit of the legitimate theater. He made his Broadway debut on April 30, 1954 in Stalag 17 (1953) producer Richard Condon's only Broadway production as a playwright, \"Men of Distinction\", along with Robert Preston and Martin Ritt. The play flopped and ran only four appearances.\n\nThe following year was to prove kinder: he hosted a summer-replacement television series produced at the Blue Angel, and won a Theatre World Award for his work in the 1954 music revue \"John Murray Anderson's Almanac\", which co-starred Harry Belafonte, Polly Bergen, Hermione Gingold and Carleton Carpenter. It was a hit that ran for 229 performances. He followed this up with an even bigger hit, the leading role in \"Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter\". Next up was a succès d'estime as the leading man in Herman Wouk's comic play \"Nature's Way\", which co-starred Bea Arthur, Sorrell Booke and Godfrey Cambridge. Though the play lasted but 67 performances, Orson Bean had established himself on the Broadway stage.\n\nHe enjoyed his greatest personal success on Broadway in the 1961-62 season, in the Betty Comden and Adolph Green musical \"Subways are for Sleeping\", which was directed and choreographed by Michael Kidd and featured music by Jule Styne. Bean received a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Musical (his co-star Phyllis Newman won a Tony Award as Best Featured Actress in a Musical). The following season, he was in a bigger hit, the comedy \"Never Too Late\", which would go on to play for 1,007 performances. After appearing in the flop comedy \"I Was Dancing\" in November 1964, Bean made his last Broadway appearance in the musical \"Illya Darling\" in 1967 with Melina Mercouri, directed by fellow blacklister Jules Dassin; it played 320 performances. He also toured in the Neil Simon-Burt Bacharach musical \"Promises, Promises\".\n\nBean made an impression as the Army psychiatrist in Otto Preminger's Anatomie eines Mordes (1959). But it was as a television personality that he made his biggest inroads into the popular consciousness, as well as the popular culture. He appeared in numerous quiz and talk shows, becoming a familiar face in homes as a regular panelist on To Tell the Truth (1956). He also appeared on Norman Lear's cult favorite Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman (1976) and its sequel, Forever Fernwood (1977), as \"Reverend Brim\", and as store owner \"Loren Bray\" on Dr. Quinn - Ärztin aus Leidenschaft (1993). Much of his role as 105-year-old \"Dr. Lester\" in the cult film Being John Malkovich (1999) wound up the cutting room floor, but audiences and critics welcomed back his familiar presence."
