        "meta_description": "A Decade Into Darkness by Shock Octopus, released 29 May 2021\n\n1. So Far From Home\n2. Safe Room\n3. A Deer! Caught! In The Headlights!\n4. Sitting On A Ledge\n5. Frustrated Crustacean\n6. In A Box\n7. The Noviciate\n8. Siren\n9. Return of the Sweet Prince\n10. Fantasia\n11. Just Not There\n12. Die Well\n13. No Easy Way Down\n14. Life On A Pier\n15. Bonus Track - Oh Mein Maker (Demo)\n16. Bonus Track - He Lives Underground (Demo)\n\nThe cliché is true; time flies, accelerates, a lifetime in merely the blink of an eye. With that agreed, I don’t think any of us Octopi have fully grasped that a whole decade has passed since our first single ‘Safe Room’ was released in 2011, for general audial consumption.\r\n\r\nBut the passage of time - just like an Octopus in Shock – is a rubbery, slippery, complex tangle of evasiveness, guile and changing colours.\r\n\r\nIn a way, that also describes the mission statement of Shock Octopus. We never wanted to fit in or be neatly categorised. We never wanted to compromise. We never wanted people to find us comfortable. The band has been through many changes in line up and seismic shifts in style since 2011 but the essence always remained – to plumb the depths of human existence and play like our very lives depend on it. But I guess when so many of ones’ songs are about the end of the world, one does have to be a bit ‘living theatre’ about it – there’s not really an alternative way to pull it off.\r\n\r\nI remember when the band first started. I had been playing in bands with David Blair in Perth since 2006. Our shtick back then was knocking out epic technicolour pop rock. The songs were great but our reach exceeded our grasp – we hadn’t quite found our voice and the proverbial shit just wasn’t proverbially sticking.\r\n\r\nI took some time off, feeling more than a little disillusioned. I set off for Pinjarra to work for a bauxite mining company (as you did when you lived in WA in 2009). I was armed with two new albums of music I had never heard before, that I’d purchased on a whim: Peter Gabriel’s ‘Melt’ and Throwing Muses ‘In A Doghouse.’ I think it was a combination of, a new town, a job involving environmental destruction (quite literally, before my eyes), and the psychotic implosion of the music I was listening to, that birthed this, the first ever Shock Octopus track: ‘A Deer Caught In The Headlights’ . \r\n\r\nThis was something different – instead of the obvious 3 major chord sing-alongs of yore, ‘Deer’ was angular, disjointed, a little atonal. Time and key signatures would drop out and change as the song chugged along. Piano ballad sections would decompose and reform as a chugging, corrosive 11/8 beast in which the off-rhythm itself masqueraded as the catchy riff. My voice had also changed overnight from something faux operatic to a stoic proxy for Jello Biafra.\r\n\r\nUnsure, I took the song to Dave and said ‘I have no idea what this is but I think we’re onto something here and by the way, I want to be lead singer in this new band.’ I think Dave was more than a little bemused in what he heard, but he humoured me by recording a few demos in this freaky new style and in agreeing to form a band.\r\n\r\nWe found two kindred spirits in Scott Andrews and David Sayers. I knew there was something special about this line-up from day one. To this day they have been the most pleasurable group of people I have ever collaborated with. I always joked that this short lived incarnation of Shock Octopus was the example of a perfect democracy at work, and looking back I don’t believe this is hyperbole at all! Everyone brought in something special to the band. David Sayers was a dedicated guitarist with endless effects pedals and an affection for loud and dirty rock and roll. He brought to the band the gnarled riffs that would soon become our first recorded single ‘Safe Room’. Scott Andrews is a brilliant drummer and percussionist who was willing to keep up with the warped mutations we called songs, often forcing him to change time signature at the drop of a hat. He also provided the band with the lead single for our first EP: ‘Sitting On A Ledge’. The song is a stream of sub-consciousness fed through an angular, neon-coloured, pop-art of chunky riffs and squalling synths – quite a trip. David Blair, mercurial bassist and vocalist, settled in very well with the ‘new sound’ which informed his great contribution to out first EP: ‘Frustrated Crustacean.’ It would be easy to call this a tribute to OK Computer Radiohead – but listen for yourself – there is nothing else quite like it.\r\n\r\nOur first gigs were tentative steps into this new uncharted land of trans-genre psychedelia. This was as much the case for our curious audiences as it was for us. Keeping in mind (that) we were knee deep into one of the more conservative eras of Perth’s history (mining booms and all) – people didn’t quite know what to make of the new and weird! After a disastrous band competition in Mandurah I wondered if this was going to work. How long could we pull this off if people didn’t fall into place alongside us?\r\n\r\nSoon, however, we knew something kinetic – even magical was happening. There was a little blip of an alt-rock renaissance happening in Perth underneath the conservative exterior, you could feel the excitement in the air. People were coming up to us after the show to tell us they felt legitimately scared by our otherworldly performances. By the time we launched the first EP our shows were a metaphorical (or in my case, literal) amphetamine rush.\r\n\r\nIt couldn’t last, could it. What is life but a torrent of stop-start motion hallucinations that end as soon as they begin. After the EP launch, we went our separate ways, including different states and countries. One would have thought it would all end there, however what fate never accounts for is tenacity. My tenacity and gusto then was such that I would see a project through, even if doing so was not only impractical but nearly impossible.\r\n\r\nSo it was in my new home in Melbourne, with Scott in Perth, Dave Blair in Japan and David Sayers having left the band, that I teamed up with fellow Melbournite Bill Presser to record 6 more songs for the 2014 full LP release ‘A Crisis’. To say the recording was ‘problematic’ and the subsequent national tour ‘not without the odd hiccup’ is a true understatement. But to this day the resulting album still sounds great and was almost worth it – I’m just out of recovery after-all! The lead single ‘Siren’ was something very new for Shock Octopus – a shimmering ethereal wall of mid tempo art-pop. The songs’ style indicated that initial tendencies toward epic major chord rock hadn’t quite left our system – indeed they were here to stay! Dave Blair, all the way from Japan, made a promo video for ‘Siren’ from reclaimed movie footage and live footage of the band on the ‘Crisis’ tour - it is a blast.\r\n\r\nFollowing the near heart-attack of ‘A Crisis!’ (aptly named!) Scott and I decided to continue the band as a two-piece, and record a series of acoustic tinged EPs. This was partly to make our lives logistically easier (as we still lived on opposite sides of the continent) and partly to capture the other side of Scott’s song writing – brooding existential rootsy ballads. Misadventure still continued to follow the recording process like insistent apparition, on reflection I believe our first EP as a two-piece ‘Throughout the Winter’ has a degree of tentativeness to it, as my voice struggled to match up to Scott’s new direction of impressive song writing. \r\n\r\nOur next attempt ‘Roam in Silence’ reveals a more homogenous synchronicity, in my own opinion. Fan reaction was positive and lead single ‘Fantasia’ has enjoyed the most listens of any Shock Octopus song to date. Perhaps, just like us, our fanbase was growing older and mellower. We even applied for a gig at a folk festival one year!\r\n\r\nHowever, the ‘wide-screen-multi-layered-epic-pop’ bug was a hard one to shake off. We had a recording of one in the vaults, gathering dust: ‘No Easy Way Down’ has long been a live favourite for band and audience alike. In early 2020, we shook the dust off to release it as a double A-side with another group, ‘Counting Backwards’ as a fundraiser for Extinction Rebellion. This created a new wave of community and media interest which inspired us to create an EP in the same vein. \r\n\r\n‘Enter the Exit’ was a new approach to the recording and creative process. I layered the keyboards and arranged new tracks such as ‘Life on a Pier’ before sending them off to Dave, Scott and new contributors Magda Wozny and Damien Langley to add their layers of guitar, bass, percussion and vocals. The sound harkened back to my cinematic pop days before Shock Octopus and it felt more evolved. At any rate, it was great to finally have the confidence and ability to create the sounds that I have heard internally, my whole life.\r\n\r\nThe indie press loved it, the punters loved it, for us it felt like a renaissance. There were even plans to make a whole album in this style, with four new demos written. Alas the recording curse returned once more, along with a second wave of COVID lockdown, and from these sessions only one new track ‘So Far From Home’ made it to the mastering desk.\r\n\r\nIs this the end then? Who knows! The band has had the shadow of entropy lurking over it since day one. Time after time we blew it off only to reconstitute again, regenerated in a manner befitting Dr Who. So I’m in no position to predict an absolute here. Regardless of our future, however, I think this is a fantastic opportunity, 10 years later, to be still, look back, and reflect on what has been an incredibly rewarding and fascinating journey.\r\n\r\nTen years into the darkness indeed.\r\n\r\n-\tMichael Bayliss\r\nShock Octopus",

Take my hand run! Let’s get inside – the safe room. Fall back – Regroup! Family comes first! Wait it out in –the safe room. It’s safe, in here, sleep tight, doll eyes We tried to divert it We tried to transfer it We held up the dam walls And we grew fat on the spoils buying time just biding time They broke through the front door They’re smashing down our halls I’m watching from the monitor The strength in man when desperate when food run out when land run dry Door sealed – air tight! We’ll be alright! If we don’t move – from the safe room Fall back… It’s banging at the door It’s dripping down the wall It’s soaking through the floor It’s safe in here sleep tight doll eyes IT’S NOT SAFE HERE NOWHERE SAFE NOW SAFE ROOM UNSAFE SAFE ROOM UNSAFE\n\n3.\n\nBeyond the sprawl Beyond the blight the neon lights Beyond the sea Under the trees Our secret garden We have to go a little further That they’ll never find us here Can you hear the chainsaws near You and me We need the dirt beneath our feet Need the green within our reach To think we’re another race Darwin drawls Your darling days are drawing near Pull the hearse beyond the green Disillusionment falls here And when it’s gone We’ll go up high And when it’s gone I hear your cry And when you’re gone A kiss goodbye divine There is nowhere to run Like a deer…caught…in the headlights a Deer…caught…in the headlights a DEER! CAUGHT! IN THE HEADLIGHTS A DEER! CAUGHT! IN THE HEADLIGHTS!! Boom time make me wanna holler Boom time drawn me down to pallor Boring new holes through my wood Boom time make we wanna holler Boom time drawn me down to pallor Boring new hole through my wood They’ve found all the holes to your womb Losing, I’m losing it Losing, I’m losing you Losing, I’m losing it Losing, I’m losing you (Burn black for him baby Big black, she burns for him Burn black for him baby Big black she burns for him) Termite people make me holler Termite people drawn to pallor They ate all the holes in my wood Termite people make me holler Termite people drawn to pallor They ate all the holes in my wood Ate through my holes to your womb Losing, I’m losing it… (Burn black for him baby..) My dear, caught in the headlights my Dear, caught, in the headlights she Plays, dead, in the floodlights we Play dead in the floodlights\n\n4.\n\nSitting On A Ledge 02:36\n\nGoddamn! Thought I saw The shoes you wear Two days in a row But I wasn't scared Then I breathed again I don't feel like a phone booth in your way I don't feel like there's something I should say Shazaam! Got pins and needles in the same leg Last week and today oh I remembered them while sitting on a ledge ...while sitting on a ledge... Yeah while sitting on that ledge.\n\n5.\n\nFrustrated Crustacean 07:37\n\nThere's a creeping thought That I held and fought But it's came to naught In a dark abyss With a single word And a minor third Could a song be heard In a world like this? But I've held the fire I've torched the infidels But I never realised something was amiss Breakdown Turn back If you want to save the world What's that? Love me If you want to save the world and your own face Please don't be cruel It was only a rule It wasn't meant to fuel my rage But I've come too far now These forces are driving me over What is there to say I've changed I've changed I've changed Breakdown Turn back If you want to save the world What's that? Love me If you want to save the world and your own face.\n\n6.\n\nIn A Box 04:20\n\nI live in a small white box It is in a larger box I live here with other people They all live in boxes too Our little box has no garden Just a thyme plant in a pot It seems boxed in (just like me) So hard these days to find some space We work all week for our enclave With a box above my head With a box below my bed And it goes on right down the street Box and box Box after box I find it hard So hard to breathe With the whole world closing in This house I live in It has so many rooms It would take many years To wander through every hall And nobody else Lives with me in this house It’s just me on my own To get lost in my thoughts I feel boxed in I leave my box to go to work And travel in a small white box And share a lane with other boxes The radio blares from a box My work is in a tall white box I travel up a small grey box I feel boxed in! My office space, compartment box I stare all day at a box An Excel’s full of little boxes Lunch time I go back down a box Lunch today is bento box Tea tonight in front of box My minds not here My mind has flown To dream of bigger better things This house I live in It opens to a yard It’s so large and so lush And it goes on beyond horizon And nobody else can find me way out here It’s just me in the garden To get lost in my thoughts And I could walk all corners of my mind And reach the edge and I know That here too I’m confined I lost my home I lost my box I don't live in a smaller box I lost my job I lost my box I don't work in a smaller box Closing in closing in My whole damn world is closing in I feel boxed in\n\n7.\n\nThe Noviciate 05:23\n\n8.\n\nSiren 03:39\n\nSiren calls to me through the ocean spray Siren sings to me though the wind holds sway Sail on a wiser man, he knows the silence is a friend To you I turn port stead, a lesser man sail to his end And she sings: Come to me Stay with me Endlessly How could I ever tell her no How could I ever let her go Siren lures me in, to her rocky shores Siren reels me in, to her funeral port Sound a shattering a mast so high could crash so low Now to drown in love, to sleep her meadows far below And she sings: Drown for me Down with me Endlessly And I knew from start her song It always it always it always ends in…\n\n9.\n\n10.\n\nFantasia 03:55\n\nFly in the water Swim in the sky Live in your death Laugh in your cry Enter the exit Come as you go Drown in the air Forget what you know To reach nirvana You had to fall So far below Wander in circles Through endless strange roads To find your way back home Hate your lover Hold onto the fall Join your dividers Your nothing is your all Enter the exit come as you go Drown in the air Forget what you know To reach nirvana You had to fall So far below Wander in circles Through endless strange roads To find your way back home\n\n11.\n\nJust Not There 03:55\n\nturn the telescope round if you can take it point it back on yourself let the solar system wait in a hell that you've designed very well confuse and confound the condition of interacting with all of your societal norms it's not normal at all i'm just not there i'll keep you on the line wake and dress to the sounds of the city commute into the void of lies advertise a perception defiled and realise i'm just not there i'll keep you on the line it's so hard to get things right when the balance is wrong and life isn't fixable anywhere at all heading off towards the distant shore working for an outcome that's just not there any more\n\n12.\n\nDie Well 04:51\n\ncarry a torch ritualise the most important day just a body on the turn turn the mind to remind it's the only part left to remain push the envelope into the big smoke of death, too morbid, concerned with death three days sure is dead bury the past in the cemetery, mortuary, obituary line the coffins with burning ghats did you fall in love with the person or the dead stuff? the problem's not outside we want to live but not to die who are you anyway? the problem's not outside we want to live but not to die who are you anyway? whose turn is it today? what is real? where is truth? what is necessary? how do I spend my time? where is the emphasis? at any moment I could die\n\n13.\n\nNo Easy Way Down 03:34\n\nTop of the world My world is shrinking King of the ice My crown is falling Homeless in homeland Early too late Man sends his tendrils Man seals my fate Can you feel Can you feel Can you feel it falling all around here? Can you hear Can you hear Can you hear ice cracking underneath? Do you think Do you think that there is a whole world under here? I can only hope I can only ever find out My whole damn world is slipping sliding to the sea And you know there is no No easy way down But a thousand leagues till end of sea It's unto here I drown And you know there is no No easy way down But under the northern lights I stay If I - I fell - fell right - right through Would I land back On top of the world?\n\n14.\n\nLife On A Pier 04:39\n\nLife on a pier – life on the edge Life on the brink – stepped to the edge And I know and I know that the perfect storm (Will sweep in from the sea) And I know and I know that the perfect wave (Will sweep us out to sea) Flow my tears, flow my tears (Surrender let go) Love on the pier – love on the edge Love on the brink – stepped to the edge Would you lie for me? Would you die for me? If I asked you to? Or is that you – shoreline receding If I needed you? Could you see this through? With all hands on deck? Or is that you - fading horizon Flow my tears, flow my tears (surrender let go) The pier is creaking, the waterline creeping Our past lives are catching, our future lives waning All the things, oh all the things, that I wanted to do (Oh scattered to the sea) Possibly, possibilities now collapse into (A singularity) Those who know better must shoulder the burden Whilst those heads stuck in sand with the shoreline receding We’ll cry Flow my tears, flow my tears (The voice of hope sighed) Flow my tears, flow my tears (Surrender let go and) But burn these years, burn these years\n\n15.\n\nWoke up feeling shit today, I really didn’t want to wake Work commitments through the roof, there is no room to breathe or move Can’t keep up with Mr Jones, just want another fucking cone But I must toil another day, to find I’ve done things all their way Chained up to our desks like dogs, we hail the monitors like god The gold shine glitter in our eyes, its why we traded in our lives Feel my life force enervate, the workload exponentiate I think I’ve lost humanity but fuck me got a great CV Oh mein maker, my mother, my father My bearer, mon bella Oh your slaver, your ruler, your fuhrer Your first born, your blood spawn Raus, raus, raus Can’t remember what my family looks like, eons since I fucked my wife But gotta do more overtime, oh god I’m running out of time Can’t move can’t scream too late to try, I’m bound to serve before I die The growing monster that we feed, we hail the Lucifer we freed Like a greyhound at a race, keep me muzzled keep the pace God I’m running out of breath, left foot step away from death Ashen embers slowly pale, pilot light has gone to fail\n\n16."
