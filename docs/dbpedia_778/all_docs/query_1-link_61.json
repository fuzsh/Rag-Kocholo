        "text": "Genre-hopping, bursting with musical ideas, brimming with production techniques, overflowing with lyrical imagery and energy, this is Queen’s long-playing masterpiece! There are very much two sides to this musical story, Side One being very ‘rock’ and holding the more familiar material, with Side Two more eclectic and showcasing different aspects of the band’s personalities.\n\nThere is an impressive economy to the album, the total listening time clocking in at under thirty-nine minutes, unheard of for today’s releases. Of course, the length of records in the era of black vinyl was partially limited by the technology and quality of the pressing, but if you can say what you want to in this time frame, as Queen have done here, why would you want any longer? Bands since, now and into the future can all learn from this masterclass. How often do you see rock albums with songs as short as one minute and seven seconds?!\n\nQueen were formed in 1971, when art student Farrokh (Frederick) Bulsara, from the island of Zanzibar and born into a family of Persian extraction and strict Parsee faith, Brian Harold May, from Twickenham, Middlesex, a student of astro-physics who carved his first guitar from a mahogany fireplace surround, and Roger Meddows Taylor, a dentistry student from Norfolk, brought up in Truro, Cornwall, auditioned quiet and studious Leicester-born John Richard Deacon, and selected him to complete the band line-up. May and Taylor had been in a previous band, Smile, which Mercury had joined, so this new venture took the learning from that and was also a break from the past to create a new future.\n\nBulsara became Mercury, May ditched astronomy and Taylor shunned dentistry for rock’n’roll. Freddie’s time as a market stall holder indulged his passion for second-hand fashion and the new band were a perfect vehicle for the performer with a reputation for being camp and arrogant before he joined them. Based in England’s capital city, ‘ ‘the big smoke’ of London, the four would go on to set the musical world on fire…\n\nHaving released their debut album ‘Queen’ in July 1973, after much delay, and followed up with the imaginatively-titled sophomore ‘Queen II’ in March 1974, the band were gaining popularity, although also attracting negative critique of their music, which was an unusual blend of styles. The guitar-driven rocker ‘Keep Yourself Alive’ from the first album and poppier, more choral single ‘Seven Seas Of Rhye’ from the second attracted attention and would become Queen classics. ‘Sheer Heart Attack’, to be unleashed on an unsuspecting populace on 8th November 1974, would surpass both those long players, in terms of eclecticism, songwriting, production and sheer power.\n\nDue to health problems, Brian May only managed to attend the recording sessions for the album, which took place at Rockfield Studios in Monmouth, Wales and Air and Trident Studios in London, England, intermittently. Roy Thomas Baker, as producer-extraordinaire, is certainly worthy of much credit as a fifth band member for his contribution to this record, as he would with future classic Queen releases. With May writing at home and in hospital, you might have thought that the album would have taken longer, but this didn’t appear to be the case, as the whole process took less than three months, minimal in comparison with many other recordings since. May is quoted as saying, in his understated way, “none of us were really displeased with the final result.” [2.]\n\nSide One\n\nThe journey starts at the fair, in the British seaside town of Brighton to be exact, the title a pun on the stripy sticks of candified sugar that are sold in coastal resorts all round the UK. The intro music is reminiscent of what you’ve probably heard by amusement arcades on piers, perhaps while you’re waiting for a turn on the merry-go-round, deciding whether you’re going to ride the bay, the grey or the palomino. All the fun of the fair…and then the real rock fades in, in the form of Brian May’s electric guitar, swiftly followed by the full band flow, tighter than a duck’s arse, Freddie Mercury’s stunning falsetto vocals over the top, singing:\n\n“Happy little day, Jimmy went away\n\nMet his little Jenny on a public holiday\n\nA happy pair they made, so decorously laid\n\n‘Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade” [1.]\n\nThe falsetto Freddie voice morphs into the better known rock delivery as he tells us how good it is that there’s still a little “magic in the air” and that he’ll weave his spell…\n\nThe chorus is the first taste of that unmistakable Queen sound, majestic harmony vocals over lush, full-on rock:\n\n“Oh, Rock of Ages\n\nDo not crumble, love is breathing still\n\nOh, Lady Moon, shine down\n\nA little people magic if you will” [1.]\n\nRomantic, hopeful, poetic, persuading us to be on the side of love, for Jimmy and Jenny. The piece drifts on to a guitar-driven soundtrack of the day out at the seaside before the band kicks in for the last verse and it seems all hope of a long term relationship are dashed by circumstance…\n\nThe now iconic ‘finger-clicking’ intro to the to-become-classic ‘Killer Queen’, cited by May as ‘the turning point’ for the band, changes the tempo and feel somewhat, the bouncy, poppy groove belying the macabre nature of the song’s subject. Although released as a ‘double-A-side’ single with ‘Flick Of The Wrist’, also written by Mercury, about a month before the album’s release, that decision doesn’t make much sense with hindsight, the latter being, although an amazing song in its own right, a much darker composition filled with lyrics of violence and deprivation.\n\nRoger Taylor really excels on his self-penned composition ‘Tenement Funster’, his gritty rock star vocals lifting the song to considerable highs. Surely semi-autobiographical, the song details the protagonist’s love of fashion, girls, cars and rock music. When Taylor wrote this verse, he was almost certainly channelling the band at the time, later describing themselves as ‘penniless’ and living in ‘bedsitters’ in London:\n\n“I like the good things in life\n\nBut most of the best things ain’t free\n\nIt’s the same situation just cuts like a knife\n\nWhen you’re young and you’re poor and you’re crazy\n\nYoung and you’re crazy…” [1.]\n\n‘Lily Of The Valley’ gives some relief from the full-on rock and is a beautiful piece, composed and sung by Freddie Mercury. There is a reference back to ‘Seven Seas Of Rhye’, which appeared on the first album as an instrumental and the second album as Freddie tells us, in beautiful melodious tones, that the “messenger from Seven Seas has flown, to tell the king of Rhye he’s lost his throne…” [1.]\n\nA perfect closure to the first side, ‘Now I’m Here’ would become a live favourite, but this recording is impossible to surpass and even harder to emulate on stage. The palm-muted, insistent guitar on a D power chord starts the song, possibly the best that Brian May would write in Queen’s career. The tune is full of ‘guitar orchestrations’, as the notes on the inner sleeve refer to.\n\nSide Two\n\nWritten by Freddie Mercury, ‘In The Lap Of The Gods’ and its reprisal sister ‘In The Lap Of The Gods…Revisited’ bookend this side of the LP in dramatic fashion. The former starts with high drama, an operatic high-pitched vocal extravaganza, moving into a piano accompaniment with Freddie’s slurred vocals almost sounding drunk: “I live my life for you…” This sounds like an overture, breaking down at its end to segue into ‘Stone Cold Crazy’, an all-out rocker with a totally infectious groove, credited to the whole band and packing a lot into its two minutes and twelve seconds.\n\nAt only one minute and seven seconds, Brian May’s ‘Dear Friends’, sung by Mercury, accompanied by his own piano playing, a band choir being the only other instrumentation, is the shortest track on the release.\n\nJohn Deacon provides the upbeat, catchy ‘Misfire’, introduced by May’s percussive acoustic guitar, sung by Mercury in playful fashion in the right channel, creating two vocal characters by introducing the falsetto, in the left channel, so prominent earlier in the opening track. Overlaid electric guitar riffs over Deacon’s insistent bass syncopation drive the song to its conclusion, bursting straight into the ‘Bring back, bring back’ multi-track vocals of ‘Bring Back That Leroy Brown’, which has a fun, showtunes feel to it, combined with a western hoedown, fuelled by May’s spirited banjo playing, and a nod to the musical hall of the 1920s.\n\nThe curiously-titled ‘She Makes Me (Stormtrooper In Stilettos)’ is another song from the pen of Brian May, who delivers the lead vocal on this dreamy, acoustic driven piece. Changing the mood again after the ‘showtunes’ feel of ‘Leroy Brown’, this is the perfect penultimate track, the dying breaths of the soldier over the dramatic sound effects and atmospheric backing taking us back to revisit the side opener.\n\nThe ‘Lap Of The Gods’ reprisal is a philosophical introspection, and Freddie seems to have someone in mind who is trying to manipulate him. As he would demonstrate in the later ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ and in his lifestyle, he was a free spirit, embracing life in all its uncertainty, fate and ‘in the lap of the gods’ for sure. In the true spirit of rock’n’roll, the chorus parts are just ‘whoas’ and ‘las’ with an ‘ooh’, though of course delivered by Freddie, accompanied by choral theatrics, they are very powerful:\n\n“Whoa, whoa, la la la, whoa\n\nWhoa, whoa, la la\n\nWhoa, whoa, oooh” [1.]\n\n‘A Night At The Opera’ and “A Day At The Races’, albums named after Marx Brothers films, would follow, the former featuring ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’, considered to be the band’s masterpiece in terms of songwriting. In my opinion, as a trilogy, 1974’s ‘Sheer Heart Attack’ and these two regal albums, resplendent in their coats of arms on white and black ‘fake invitation’ livery, released in the two consecutive years thereafter, represent a royal purple patch in the band’s reign. ‘News Of The World’, released in 1977 at the heart of punk, spawned the classic double A-side single ‘We Are The Champions/We Will Rock You’, the very underrated, raunchy ‘Spread Your Wings’ and a more stripped down, edgy musical approach, including the zeitgeist-influenced buzzsaw of the song ‘Sheer Heart Attack’, one of the last few albums of the ‘old school’ Queen, before they adopted a more electronic, synth-based sound in the eighties, churning out a series of chart hits. For a band that were proud to state ‘no synthesisers’ on their LP covers in the 70s, they were certainly gung ho in embracing that technology in their later career! At the time of ‘News Of The World’, Mercury’s image morphed into a new camp persona, moustachioed, short-haired and exposing upper body flesh, progressions of which became his ‘look’ thereafter. On 24th November 1991, Freddie Mercury drew his last breath and the world lost one of its great rock icons. John Deacon retired from Queen, and the whole music industry, in 1997. Brian May and Roger Taylor are both still active musicians, occasionally as part of a group masquerading as ‘Queen’, with stand-in vocalist and bass player.\n\n‘Sheer Heart Attack’ Personnel:\n\nRoger Taylor – DRUMS, vocals, percussion, screams\n\nFreddie Mercury – VOCALS, piano, jangle piano, vocal extravaganzas\n\nJohn Deacon – BASS GUITAR, double bass, acoustic guitar, almost all guitars on ‘Misfire’\n\nBrian May – GUITARS, vocals, piano, genuine George Formby ukelele-banjo, guitar orchestrations\n\n‘no synthesisers’\n\n‘Sheer Heart Attack’\n\nOriginally released: 8th November 1974\n\nLabel: EMI\n\nRecorded at: Rockfield, Air and Trident Studios, UK\n\nProduced by: Roy Thomas Baker and Queen\n\n‘Sheer Heart Attack’ tracklisting:\n\nSide One\n\nBrighton Rock (May) 5:08\n\nKiller Queen (Mercury) 3:01\n\nTenement Funster (Taylor) 2:48\n\nFlick Of The Wrist (Mercury) 3:19\n\nLily Of The Valley (Mercury) 1:43\n\nNow I’m Here (May) 4:10\n\nSide Two\n\nIn The Lap Of The Gods (Mercury) 3:20\n\nStone Cold Crazy (Mercury-May-Taylor-Deacon) 2:12\n\nDear Friends (May) 1:07\n\nMisfire (Deacon) 1:50\n\nBring Back That Leroy Brown (Mercury) 2:13\n\nShe Makes Me (Stormtrooper In Stilettos) (May) 4:08\n\nIn The Lap Of The Gods…Revisited (Mercury) 3:42"
