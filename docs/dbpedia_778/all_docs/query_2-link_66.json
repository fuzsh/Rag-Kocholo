        "text": "Late last year, I moved to Portland, Oregon. It’s a wonderfully weird place. The locals actually say, “Keep Portland weird.” There’s a large mural of that saying, somewhere in the city. Everything about this place is quirky, eccentric, and hence, I should fit in here, just fine.\n\nI also started a new job. I’m working in the mental health field. No, I’m not a doctor, therapist, and definitely not a psychiatrist. I just work for a company that trains us to assist people who have one or more mental health diagnoses, addiction problems, or who have lived on the streets, but are now in reliable housing, provided by the state. It’s a good gig. I get paid well, to help the people who really need help the most.\n\nOn Friday night, it started snowing, the temperatures were bottoming out as low as 18°F. That’s well below freezing, and it doesn’t even account for the windchill factor.\n\nThe other, less positive side of Portland, is that the homelessness crisis here is really bad. It’s almost impossible to go anywhere without seeing at least one car, RV, tent, or lean-to type shelter that someone is using to live in.\n\nI first discovered this song from the band Junip. When I realized that it’s a cover of Bruce Springsteen, I found the original, and loved it, too.\n\nThis morning, it’s so cold outside, that neither my dog nor myself want to go outside any longer than is absolutely necessary. But, there are people out there, living in tents and sleeping bags.\n\nI woke up to this song playing, I had left my phone on shuffle all night to help me sleep. I listened to it, looked at the weather, then became obsessed.\n\nI’d never played this song before, but I learned it, then I recorded all the guitar and bass parts, and sang the vocal, and recorded it, and mixed it. Basically my whole Sunday went into this.\n\nI plan to make a video for it, but I wanted to get this out, because I worked on it nonstop all day.\n\nThe Ghost of Tom Joad\n\nMen walkin’ ‘long the railroad tracks\n\nGoin’ someplace there’s no goin’ back\n\nHighway patrol choppers\n\nComin’ up over the ridge\n\nHot soup on a campfire under the bridge\n\nShelter line stretchin’ ’round the corner\n\nWelcome to the new world order\n\nFamilies sleepin’ in their cars in the Southwest,\n\nNo home no job no peace no rest\n\nThe highway is alive tonight\n\nBut nobody’s kiddin’ nobody\n\nAbout where it goes\n\nI’m sittin’ down here in the campfire light Searchin’ for the ghost of Tom Joad\n\nHe pulls a prayer book out of his sleeping bag Preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag\n\nWaitin’ for when the last shall be first, and\n\nThe first shall be last\n\nIn a cardboard box ‘neath the underpass\n\nGot a one­way ticket to the promised land\n\nYou got a hole in your belly and gun in your hand Sleeping on a pillow of solid rock\n\nBathin’ in the city aqueduct\n\nThe highway is alive tonight\n\nWhere it’s headed everybody knows\n\nI’m sittin’ down here in the campfire light\n\nWaitin’ on the ghost of Tom Joad\n\nNow Tom said,\n\n“Mom, wherever there’s a cop beatin’ a guy\n\n“The Ghost Of Tom Joad” lyrics\n\nWherever a hungry newborn baby cries\n\nWhere there’s a fight ‘gainst the blood and\n\nHatred in the air Look for me Mom I’ll be there\n\n“Wherever there’s somebody fightin’\n\nFor a place to stand\n\nOr decent job or a helpin’ hand\n\nWherever somebody’s strugglin’ to be free\n\nLook in their eyes Mom you’ll see me.”\n\nWell the highway is alive tonight\n\nBut nobody’s kiddin’ nobody\n\nAbout where it goes\n\nI’m sittin’ down here in the campfire light\n\nWith the ghost of old Tom Joad\n\nWords and music by Bruce Springsteen\n\nThis was a refreshingly positive experience. With every post I make on Instagram, I get hit up multiple times for paid promotions. It’s always a sleazy approach like “I love your stuff! Let’s work together!” even though you know they sent that message so fast, they couldn’t possibly have listened to the song.\n\nThis guy Bobby asked me on TikTok if he could review me on his show tonight. I said yes, but I was thinking, “Wait for it… he’s going to hit me with a dollar amount, a pay-to-play thing.” I don’t do those. But he didn’t ask for anything. He’s got a pretty intelligent approach to it, he offers pay-to-play, but also gives free plays and reviews, no questions asked.\n\nHe played a few minutes of my song (the format is that each song gets roughly two minutes, so he can fit more into the show). He gave some kind feedback on it and all he asks is that viewers stay active in the chats, giving ratings for each song (he uses a 1-1,000 rating scale). Even though most of what got played was either hip hop or rap, he stayed open to other genres. My music is really different from everything else I heard tonight, but he gave it equal time and thoughtful consideration.\n\nIn the chats, it looks like people rated my tune anywhere from 600 to 1,000 with an average of maybe 800 or 900. One person said 2,000 but that’s not inside the range you’re supposed to use 🤷‍♂️🙃\n\nI was pleased, especially since most of the people there were making hip hop music. He asked everyone to add constructive criticism to any songs that they rated low, and said no hating on anyone. The overall thing was a nice surprise for sure.\n\nYou can catch his show and submit your music for consideration at: Bobby Everything\n\nNew Album on June 8th\n\nThis album has the song on it that was reviewed in the show.

The latest material is sonically improved at least a couple hundred percent.\n\nLyrics\n\nSometimes I find out things about me\n\nJust a little bit more than I’d ever want to know\n\nKind of put a damper on a real good mood\n\nJust when I was sure I was on a roll\n\nI was sure I was\n\nIn the face of greatness, we often feel small\n\nYeah, the Full Moon, she spits in my eye\n\nAnd wouldn’t we all just love to know\n\nOoh, yeah… exactly why\n\nI know I would\n\nI look for answers in the other dimensions\n\nI listen for stories that cannot be told\n\nI seek someone to take my confessions\n\nAnd if there is no one, then I want control\n\nGod knows, I could use some control\n\nControl\n\nIf you could only see what I saw\n\nYou’d surely say that I’d lost my mind\n\nBut I know it’s true that all are one and one is all\n\nI’ve seen it going on, all the time\n\nAnyway you turn the question,\n\nIt cannot be answered\n\nBut anyway you turn the answer,\n\nIt cannot be questioned\n\nI took a toothless profession in cancer\n\nOn a slighted word, best not to mention\n\nNo, no\n\nAnd I look for answers in the other dimensions\n\nI listen for stories that cannot be told\n\nAnd I’ll do anything for direction\n\nAnything short of sell my soul\n\nIf I’ve got one to bargain away\n\nAway\n\nAway\n\n©2022 Kevin Trent Boswell\n\nfrom the album Something in the Air, by Trent Boswell, 2022\n\nSupport for the Work\n\nSupport this work by becoming a patron and get perks like patrons-only releases, early access free music, poetry and other artistic goodies that help keep us from sliding into the abyss of modern commercialization of the arts.\n\nThank You\n\nSpecial thanks to the following people for their video contributions:\n\ncottonbro\n\nSosa Films\n\nMikhail Nilov\n\nTom Fisk\n\nSarowar Hussain\n\nAnastasia Shuraeva\n\nMART PRODUCTION\n\nSpace Space\n\nsabrina\n\nSamphan Korwonghttps://instagram.com/kws636\n\nOsman\n\nFrank Cone\n\nEndiae Genius\n\nGaurav Joshi\n\nVishva Patel\n\nLay-Z Owl\n\nAviv Perets\n\nThis is “Something Like A Rainbow”, my first Orchestral Pop song.\n\nIt’s only a string section, not an entire orchestra. But what sets this apart from anything that I’ve ever done before is that, in addition to writing the chord progression, the guitar and bass parts and the lyrics, I also wrote the string part. That’s a new one for me.\n\nAnd I didn’t just write something on guitar and then transpose it for strings. Instead, I wrote it the way a classical composer would.\n\nTo do this, I had to draw on the part writing rules that we learned in music theory class in college, something that I thought I’d never actually use. It was a long time ago, so I feel sure that I broke some of those rules in various places but remembering the basics (no parallel 4ths or 5ths, etc) got me through it.\n\nSomething Like A Rainbow\n\nLost and alone and wandering\n\nFinding a true friend there, in the rain\n\nHold fast, together\n\nWarmth in a lover’s arms\n\nLoving each other heals the pain\n\nA soft and gentle light, to lead the way\n\nSomething like a rainbow\n\nSo many things we were told we’d see\n\nMost of them never came to be\n\nBut no one can explain the redeeming grace\n\nThat shines from the light in your face\n\nA soft and gentle light, it leads the way\n\nSomething like a rainbow\n\nAnd it shines into forever\n\nWalk in its light, into forever\n\nSo many things we were told we’d see\n\nMost of them never came to be\n\nStill, no one can explain the redeeming grace\n\nThat shines when a smile is upon your face\n\nA soft and gentle light, it leads the way\n\nSomething like a rainbow\n\nSoft and gentle light, it leads the way\n\nSomething like a rainbow\n\nAnd its light goes into forever\n\nRide the light into forever\n\nAll music and lyrics ©2022 Kevin Trent Boswell, from the album Something in the Air\n\nSupport This Work:\n\nSpecial Thanks\n\nMuch appreciation goes to the people who provided video footage:\n\nMikhail Nilov\n\ncottonbro\n\nAnna Shvets\n\nAnastasia Shuraeva\n\nMiguel Á. Padriñán\n\nPNW Production\n\nMikita Yo\n\nMarc Onana\n\nAlex Kad\n\nZuzanna Musial, Stefano Barbieri\n\nHere is my cover of “Hoochie Coochie Man”. This tune was written by the preeminent Godfather of the Blues, Muddy Waters.\n\nThe lyrics are heavily laced with references to the Hoodoo conjure tradition of the American South. One commonly misunderstood line is:\n\nI got the John the Conqueror Root\n\nI’m gonna mess with you\n\nTo mess with someone was to put roots on them, meaning to cast spells on that person.\n\nThe root known as John the Conqueror (Ipomoea jalapa) is widely regarded as one of the most powerful roots or Plant Spirits; if not the most powerful.\n\nThe root, all by itself, was potent and to possess it was to hold power to exert one’s will. However, to possess a mojo hand (aka, mojo bag), made and empowered by a knowledgeable rootworker, was an awe-inspiring thing.\n\nIt was not a simple matter to travel to Louisiana and get a mojo, especially for a Black person, who had less opportunities and greater obstacles. If you wanted the magick, the only way to get it was to find a skilled doctor.\n\nThis was a man or woman who knew how to coerce the Spirits to work on their behalf. First, you had to find a rootworker and then you had to convince them to make a hand for you and pay them whatever their fee was, no questions asked.\n\nAny rituals they prescribed you or tasks assigned must be followed scrupulously. But once you had a mojo hand, especially one containing John the Conqueror, it meant that you were a force to be reckoned with.\n\nI’m doing all the guitar, bass and vocal parts on this track. I added Slight Return to the title as a little tip of the hat to another major influence of mine, the immortal Jimi Hendrix. Hendrix was well aware of the lore mentioned here and his song “Voodoo Child (Slight Return)” references similar themes.\n\nDuring the last verse, you’ll see a quote, placed over a pic of Muddy Waters. It comes from the movie Crossroads, starring Ralph Machio; not to be confused with the movie Crossroads, starring Britney Spears.\n\nIt’s the story of a young, classical guitarist who dreams of nothing but playing the Mississippi Delta Blues. He’s a classical music major at The Juilliard School of Music but is mostly obsessed with Robert Johnson, arguably the greatest blues man ever.\n\nSupport the creation of more\n\nmusic, poetry and madness\n\nby Magus, at:\n\nhttps://Patreon.com/Magus72\n\nThe images in this video are\n\n1) historic pictures of famous, Hoodoo rootworkers and practitioners of Voodoo (or Voudon, Voodou, etc) and a few that just look the part.\n\n2) pictures of myself playing guitar\n\n3) personal photos and video of workings I’ve done\n\n4) random, “bluesy” stuff that gives the appropriate, Mississippi Blues vibe or the Hoodoo/Voodoo, sorcery vibe\n\n5) images from The Key of Solomon, a European magickal grimoire (which became highly important in Hoodoo.\n\n6) stock footage, provided by:\n\nThanks to the following, for some of the images in the video.\n\ncottonbro\n\nArtem Podrez\n\nANTHONY SHKRABA\n\nMick Haupt\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Voodoo_Altar_New_Orleans.jpg\n\nThis is the video for Unchanged. The .mp3 song download is available for patrons, over at Patreon.\n\nIt’s an original, definitely in the vein of my signature brand, a type of madness so strange that I had to give it a new name. I call it Purple Mind Licorice Music®️.\n\nIt combines alternative rock, funk, jazz, folk, blues, heavy metal and psychedelia. It’s a long name but Parliament already has Funkadelic and well, let’s face it, Alterna-Funk-N-Roll isn’t nearly as sexy as Purple Mind Licorice Music. Why yes, I do tend to talk about my music like James Brown talked about his. Thank you for noticing.\n\nSide note, if you haven’t seen the film , it’s surprisingly good. I’m a big fan of The Godfather of Soul, The Minister Of New New Super Heavy Funk (even if he was a total wacko, in real life). But for whatever reason, I didn’t think the movie would be all that great. I was delightfully wrong.\n\nBesides, alternative is a lousy category. Any genre that contains Nirvana, REM, Alice In Chains, Weezer, Coldplay and Bush isn’t particularly helpful in guiding listeners’ decisions. They seriously need to scrap that garbage and revisit the drawing board.Back to the business at hand. I’ve played this song live in my band but we just never managed to get a decent recording of it.\n\nI’m doing the vocal and all the bass and guitar parts. Here, I abandoned my memories of how we played it in the band and just started from scratch, all by myself, just me and my computer drummer, Stinky the Robot.\n\nFake It ‘Til You Break It\n\nI’ve got a habit of improvising my lead guitar parts, as opposed to writing out a solo in advance. There are songs that I write solos for but those are special cases. Usually, I just improvise and keep the bits that I like.\n\nIf anyone takes issue with that, many years ago I read an interview with David Gilmour (Pink Floyd) in a guitar magazine. He said that’s the same process he uses in the studio.\n\nHe would take several, improv passes at a song, then cut and paste the bits he liked. Later, he’d go back and learn those parts for the live shows.\n\nComfortably Numb was done that way and I think that song did alright. It sold like over a thousand copies or something. Trust me… in my head, that joke was hysterical.\n\nOf course, I also have a habit of keeping what I regard as being some of “the more charming mistakes“, for better or for worse. There’s one or two of those in the jam section at the end of this tune. I was tempted to re-record those bits but if they make me giggle, then they stay. Giggles are a precious commodity, not to be wasted.\n\nUnchanged\n\nThese wounds, open and tender\n\nReveal your face to me\n\nInto the chalice of my arms\n\nThe blood of your suffering flows free\n\nIt’s a mild mannered possession,\n\nThis waiting for the rain\n\nEncumbered by the spell and\n\nGroggy in the slumbering delay\n\nA scrap of ribbon, fallen\n\nFrom a lover’s hair\n\nFound by the boots of boredom\n\nLament for things not yet dead\n\nA piece of my soul floats there\n\nDown in the puddle below\n\nSomewhere in a watch pocket\n\nAn insane notion explodes\n\nAll words and music\n\n© 2021 Kevin Trent Boswell\n\nThank You\n\nSpecial thanks to the following people for providing the video footage and photos.

It’s got a fun, upbeat vibe to the music but the lyrics (as the title suggests) are very heavy.\n\nIt’s a song about loneliness, disappointment and suffering. It’s about asking where you turn when all your best laid plans have fallen apart.\n\nWhen I do a cover song, I usually try to reinvent it to some degree. I try to put something of my own mark on it. In this case, it didn’t feel right to completely reshape the song. There are really only two ways that I’ve wandered away from the original.\n\nOne is that I had to somehow fill up the empty space left by Garth’s piano playing. I chose to do that with harmony guitar parts, because guitar is my instrument and I gave them a simple and slightly somber quality, to accent the lyrics.\n\nThe other is that I shortened the chorus and used heavy effects on the vocal harmonies. I’m doing all the vocal, guitar and bass parts on this. The drums are by Stinky the Robot, my computer-based drummer, who is even more difficult to work with than a real drummer, if that’s even possible.\n\nGratitude\n\nSpecial thanks to the following people for providing the evocative video footage that helps bring to light our social problem of the lost and disenfranchised. Homelessness and mental illness are entirely too prevalent and much more needs to be done.\n\nWe can’t be a healthy society unless we take care of our own and that means everyone, however unpleasant it might be to look into that chasm and think “There, but for the grace of God, go I.” We must do more… much more.\n\nIf you have the means to do so, please donate your money and your volunteer time to one or more of the many quality organizations that offer help to the homeless, the mentally challenged and to stray animals. Most of the people and animals on the street got there by bad luck and they deserve a second chance.\n\nMART PRODUCTION\n\nRODNAE Productions\n\nMental Health America (MHA)\n\nAnastasia Shuraeva\n\nSupport the creation of more music, poetry and madness by Trent Boswell, at:\n\nMusic video for “Into the Fold”.

I’ve played it live with my band quite a few times but unfortunately, we never caught it on tape.\n\nI’m playing the bass and guitar parts and singing. Everything that you hear on this track is me, except for the drums. That’s because I don’t have access to a live drummer right now. Besides, feeding and caring for a wild animal like that is expensive.\n\nHere’s the full video on YouTube. Don’t forget to hit the thumbs up 👍 subscribe ✅ and the notifications bell 🔔\n\nThe song is called blind in the sun and the lyrics are below. Originally, it was a poem and I set it to music (hence the Roman numerals in the lyrics).\n\nThe .mp3 file is attached to my Patreon page, so you can go there, download it (for free) and play it whenever you want.\n\nI forget sometimes that people don’t always follow my rather eccentric, artistic choices, so I will explain something about this track. I purposefully chose not to clean up the sloppier guitar licks on this track, because it’s the feel that I was going for… teetering on the edge of the abyss.\n\nGoing back and punching in smoother, cleaner guitar parts is easy enough. I just didn’t want ’em, not for this. I’ll mention two songs that inspired my playing on this. One is “God”, by Tori Amos. Her guitar player is way better than he sounds on that track. It’s dirty, gritty and foul, for a reason. The song is about existential angst and the loss of faith, so it’s gotta be grimy.\n\nThe other is “Come On (Let The Good Times Roll)” by The Jimi Hendrix Experience. On that song, he does what jazz musicians refer to as “going outside”, meaning that he lets his solos wander just a little bit out of time and out of key, on purpose. Of course, he brings it back in or it wouldn’t be interesting. I chose to step outside on this track but hopefully not too much.\n\nFeel free to share the link to this page or the Patreon page, or the YouTube link on your social media, that’s the best form of advertising there is for underground artists. I thank you in advance. Enjoy!\n\nJust click that big, unwieldy link, below, to listen to the track. Or go to the Patreon page. You can download the song from the Patreon page and have it for your very own. Just don’t forget to water it every few days and never feed it after midnight.\n\nBlind In The Sun\n\nhttps://c10.patreonusercontent.com/3/eyJhIjoxLCJwIjoxfQ%3D%3D/patreon-media/p/post/45543356/0114204adf4a4bb2b4c492b3e1d80cbd/1.mp3?token-time=1609345733&token-hash=2ZL8WItz55_ogZDHvUN7Am6ticXKPOwsOUgMUTJy7_k%3D\n\nI.\n\nBlind in the Sun⠀\n\nCan you cringe beneath\n\nThe shadow of a fly?\n\nYou’d better try\n\nRunning ‘cross the sand\n\nFire in the hearts of your band\n\nIn the joy of being alive\n\nStripped of delusion\n\nAnd so forwardly stride\n\nLost in the garden\n\nwith canonized illusions\n\nThere are the keepers\n\nOf the tower\n\nBut I am not a member\n\nOf the dark December\n\nThe light of the sun refracts\n\nIn my eye\n\nII.\n\nEverything is water\n\nElectric fluid matter\n\nIn a paper cup\n\nCalled Time\n\nIII.\n\nSomewhere in the North\n\nThere are real vampires\n\nI know you go to visit\n\nFrom time to time\n\nTo roll in the stench\n\nThe decadence of\n\nThirst for blood\n\nTo dine with a pack\n\nOf wild gods\n\nI have no intent\n\nOf adopting your bent;\n\nPartying down with the devil\n\nOn your shoulder\n\nI have no intent\n\nOf going where you went\n\nBeating on a skull\n\nIn a hellish midnight circle\n\nBut who am I to say?\n\nThat you are not ok?\n\nI will simply stay\n\nBehind\n\nCopyright 2020 Kevin Trent Boswell\n\nCopyright 2020 Kevin Trent Boswell\n\nLatest book release:\n\nremission\n\nOther Titles Available:\n\nDark Matter\n\non the page\n\nLiber Ex Liberi\n\nChaos Comes Apart\n\nin the current\n\nNext\n\nKevinTrentBoswell.com\n\nYouTube\n\nMagus & The Plastic Infinity\n\nthe music album, Flagship\n\nMusic Streaming, Amazon\n\nMusic Streaming, Apple Music\n\nMusic Streaming, Spotify\n\nSoundCloudBlind In The Sun.mp3"
