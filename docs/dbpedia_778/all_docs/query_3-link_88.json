        "text": "I was listening to Syro this morning while walking the dogs, and I realized that there have been a lot of long delayed or anticipated albums coming out recently. So many in fact, that I can’t even think of any more examples of the “notorious recluse” that the public is really waiting for.\n\nKate Bush used to fit the bill, but her last album is only three years old, and she’s performing live again.\n\nPeter Gabriel has two albums from the past four years.\n\nLeonard Cohen has gone long stretches of time between albums, but he released one this year (and one two years ago).\n\nDavid Bowie took ten years for The Next Day, but seems to be working again.\n\nMy Bloody Valentine fans waited twenty-two years for MBV, which is only a year old.\n\nThe most infamously delayed album, Chinese Democracy, is six years old now. I suppose that’s a long time without a follow up, but not as bad as the fifteen years it took to get released.\n\nEven if you count bands that broke up and weren’t really expected to release another album, this year is seeing the first album from The Pixies in twenty-three years and now the first Pink Floyd in twenty years.\n\nSo what are the new albums of legend that may or may not ever come out?\n\nThe closest I can think of is Blur, who haven’t released an album since 2003, but have been teasing the possibility of a new full-length for four years (two singles have come out in that time).\n\nOr if I go a little less mainstream, The Sisters of Mercy last put out an album in 1990, but they’ve been actively touring ever since and have debuted plenty of new songs in that time.\n\nSeems like we have a couple different definitions of ‘recluse’ here: people who just takes a long time in between record releases, and people who are reluctant to appear in public yet still ironically have a career in a business built around ‘public figures.’\n\nIn terms of real reclusiveness / withdrawing from society, I’d say someone like Scott Walker has much more of a claim to that title than Godflesh or Faith no More - the membership of those bands took a long long hiatus from working with their ‘flagship’ projects, but just look at all the records and gigs that people like Mike Patton or J. Broadrick have logged during that ‘downtime.’\n\nI have kind of a soft spot in my heart for the true recluses, the ones who aren’t naturally comfortable with being in front of a crowd - or being around people, period - and yet have some inexplicable need to create art that’s going to be judged in a public forum.\n\nThe most infamously delayed album, Chinese Democracy, is six years old now. I suppose that’s a long time without a follow up, but not as bad as the fifteen years it took to get released.\n\nI guess the followup is in the works, as well as the Chinese Democracy remix album. Granted there have been tours in between.\n\nI guess Tool can go without saying here because being reclusive is expected from them now. But it has been 8 years since their last album, which is their longest gap so far.\n\nI’d say Raymond Watts has more room to be called a recluse than most of the artists we’re mentioning. The last PIG album came out 9 years ago and it was essentially a reissue of an album he put out a year earlier under the moniker Watts with 3 bonus tracks. He’s put out a few demos that sound pretty good and a couple random collaborations, but it’s about time we at least get an EP.\n\nAnd I’m not sure Buzz McCoy would fall into recluse territory since TKK is on the road almost every year, but I heard he has a side project called Cinema 6 that he’s been working on for quite some time.\n\nHere’s one for the black metal fans, what the fuck ever happened to Thorns?! Their 2001 self titled debut is an amazing piece of work and then nothing. An announcement regarding a followup came out in 2008, and again nothing. Last thing I heard was that founding member Snorre Ruch had contributed riffs to the Satyricon album “The Age Of Nero.”\n\nTool - obviously. Eight years between albums. Five of which have been spent in their home studio “writing”. They now supposedly have around three “finished” songs. Three songs. After five years. Just…wow. I’m pretty much at the point where I’m ready to show those guys the door, in terms of being a “fan” or whatever…\n\nGodflesh, Soundgarden, Faith No More etc don’t count as those bands effectively “broke up” before eventually getting back together again.\n\nMy Bloody Valentine would be the obvious winners here though. Twnety two years tinkering on a follow up album is just…mindblowing.\n\nChinese Democracy did not take 15 years to write and record. It took about 10 years and the rest was spent dicking around with major labels. 10 years though is still pretty amazing (especially how it ended up sounding) and if I was a big GnR fan I wouldn’t be holding my breath for a follow up anytime soon. If Axl Rose were to announce that the moon orbits the earth, I’d have NASA on the phone within minutes verifying such a claim.\n\nMassive Attack take ages. Two album since releasing Mezzanine in 1998. They say another one is on the way but…yeah ditto with the holding your breath thing.\n\nKate Bush took time off to have a child or something I think. That’s fair enough I suppose.\n\nPeter Gabriel I have heard takes ages but in reality who cares about Peter Gabriel?\n\n[:|]\n\nAs for legit RECLUSE action, Andy Prieboy (formerly of Wall of Voodoo) is a really odd duck. He enjoys being the star on stage but is quite awkward and shy as soon as the show ends. He only last year started doing live shows again after about 15 years of silence, and he doesn’t even have his music put out on any hard copy nowadays . . . just releases the stuff on iTunes or whatever.\n\nHe’s completely unknown outside of a very very small circle of cultish fans, and that’s really his own doing. I (and many others who’ve heard him) think he’s insanely brilliant and talented, but he’s really cursed himself to obscurity. I don’t know what else, if anything, he does, to be honest, and I think his longtime girlfriend, Merrill Markoe is the primary breadwinner, unless the dude does some stock trading or moonlights as a security guard or something.\n\nOther than the MP3’s/ downloads he makes available, the last time he actually put out an album was in 1995.\n\nSeems like it’s about time here to bring up the whole constellation of artists in the English “post-industrial” / esoteric underground of the 1980s and beyond (Current 93, Coil, Nurse with Wound, Death in June, etc.)\n\nThough none of them were ever reclusive in the sense of putting out records, all were notable for avoiding public contact to some degree or another. Coil played next to no live dates until the 21st century despite being active since the early 80s, and when they finally did tour, it reportedly resulted in massive nervous breakdowns on behalf of founder John Balance. This was followed by another period of enforced seclusion that Balance’s partner Peter Christopherson reported on, and sadly by JB’s death in 2004.\n\nDavid Tibet / C93 and NWW are marginally more engaged with their public since the time they formed, but I still get the impression they’d be perfectly happy if they didn’t have to play to a public whatsoever. One upside of this approach is that their selectiveness about gigs generally leads to great venue choices and truly unique listening experiences…quality over quantity as always."
