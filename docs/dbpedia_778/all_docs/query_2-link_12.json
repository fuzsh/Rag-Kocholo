        "text": "I've been writing new introductions here, more or less on an annual basis, in large part because this page remains in written order — so do scroll to the end for the latest thoughts. But I also find it worthwhile to write new introductions, as part of revisiting with myself around what I'm doing here. The other challenge is not to make this opening entry too long — while still being appropriate for both first time & returning readers. Of course, there're the prior intros as well, which can still be read, starting from the previous year's entries (including reviews)....\n\nAnd most of those entries, maybe all, were oriented toward reviewing individual recordings, so that's largely become my writing prompt here, although I started with more open-ended notions.... And I've wanted to support younger performers as well, from the start here, although I soon found that many senior performers continue to have much to offer. So I've come to feel that I must first select for music here, for context if nothing else, hopefully without becoming too immersed in my own familiarities over time.... I thus listen to many less established artists, but I suppose often in a more prospective sense. In that, though, I also retain a broad preference for smaller ensembles (& especially their \"social\" dynamics), e.g. trios & quartets, i.e. beyond solos. (Yet I'm usually left soloing here....)\n\nHopefully I also retain an emphasis on learning too, and so on experimenting with music (& in turn elsewhere): I'll note striking albums here, maybe without seeming like finished products, but I also maintain a \"convenient\" list of favorite albums, i.e. for repeated listening & reference. In that sense, concepts of \"use\" arise here, and I try especially to interrogate what I'm getting out of music — which is already presented as a \"product\" by the time it reaches me. Much of that revolves around affectivity, but not necessarily arousal (or expression per se), rather notions of environment or ambience (& silence), therefore of modulating the everyday. (I'm not necessarily interested in \"argument....\") So I find much of this music — as well as the thrust of \"experiment\" in general — to be helpful in everyday life. It can be cleansing, and it can be a spur to (further) thought, but the impact is (hopefully) beyond mere thought....\n\nMuch of the \"cleansing\" then revolves around a decolonizing project — moving in accompanying theoretical discussions from e.g. Postmodern Aesthetics (2019) to a Decolonizing Tech series (2020-) — such that \"jazz\" figures a particular response to globalism & indeed decolonization. (And as opposed to \"post-\" formulations, jazz doesn't note simply the passing of history: It's been an active \"de-.\" So one might say that jazz is about consciously moving from one world to another....) Some of this has come as well to interrogate what is \"natural\": I've been especially interested in music outside of 12-tone equal temperament, for instance, and developments in that arena seem (finally) to have real momentum. (Some of this is called \"spectral music,\" but there're more indigenous-derived formations, plus ongoing explorations of \"acoustics\" per se....) Thus I've also continued to take an interest in that most (paradoxically) \"natural\" of instruments, the human voice. But anything from around the world seems to be coming into this (musical) space, part of a sort of generalized fusion....\n\nI've been interested in musical \"production\" as well, e.g. various combinations with electronics, which permeate recorded (& increasingly live...) performance anyway. (I've been broaching e.g. AI for a while here now.) And as noted, everything is already (multiply) mediated by the time it reaches me in this space, so I do try to focus on the result, however it might be made. Again, is it useful? And then \"how it's made\" can be an exciting topic as well.... (All of this points further to broad notions of music already as (a) technology....) And where or how is it useful? Most of what's discussed here is improvised, so the idea that it might be less appealing for repeated listening doesn't imply a flaw per se... it's just something less easy to register through all this mediation. (Subsequently illuminating immediacy is certainly easier said than done....) At some level, I also want to feel some kind of \"wow\" though, even if it passes. And there's just so much more music in this space than when I started, including more along lines that would've surely drawn my attention in prior decades.... (I also see elements of my own style appearing elsewhere....) So there's far more that I could be discussing within & around this general space, not only individual albums.\n\nIt can thus become something of a challenge to decide what to review here, as it'd be \"easy\" to write far more entries, if only to note other \"similar\" releases by musicians I've already appreciated. Ties of similarity & relation branch in all directions after all, but I'm still trying to write something here only when really prompted. (This does sometimes lead to gaps, e.g. where I forget something because I didn't write about it here — so I'm not entirely satisfied with my \"system\" either. There's also simply a matter of not duplicating what someone else has to say, although again, that can end up meaning subsequent lacunae....) And I want to remain open to new ideas, not always filling my head with what I'd heard before.... In any case, while I'm generally \"recommending\" any album that I actually discuss here, I don't want to imply that there aren't other albums of similar style & quality as well. Sometimes my choices simply have to be contingent, especially in order to avoid routine. (Although many people like to see their work mentioned, I don't believe that a routine discussion is actually very helpful. Maybe it would be better instead to have \"news....\")\n\nThat said, we're still in a summer lull, and I don't actually have anything lined up to review at the moment, such that I'm writing this intro into relative vacuum. So let's see what happens next....\n\nTodd M. McComb <mccomb@medieval.org>\n\n22 August 2022\n\nAnd as it happened, the very day that I finished the new intro above, String Noise Sounds was released by the Infrequent Seams label. The latter has been building an eclectic catalog, including appearing on streaming sites beyond Bandcamp, featuring various composed music albums too, along with improvisation. And indeed the violin duo \"String Noise\" — Pauline Kim Harris & Conrad Harris — had already appeared on the label playing composed music, as seems to be their norm: They have a variety of albums exploring contemporary compositions in the latest styles (i.e. post-Cage), as well as e.g. popular music arrangements, but String Noise Sounds (apparently recorded on two dates in 2022), is an improvised album (& so more typical of the space here). It also takes String Noise first to a quartet, which the very short (& somewhat confusing) notes state to be the original formation, here with Jessie Cox (drums) & Sam Yulsman (synths, piano) — then also with \"guests\" Bethany Younge (voice) & Jesse Stiles (electronic drone). The latter two are described emphatically as composers, and may appear only on the \"B\" side of this very long (nearly an hour & a half, so basically a double album) cassette. There's certainly voice low in the texture at times there, simmering breath, or muted screams... and I'm not sure how to distinguish someone playing \"drone\" amid someone playing synth. (None of the additional musicians was familiar to me previously.) In any event, the \"A\" opening is immediately striking, with shimmering metal & soon frenetic twittering suggestive of some kind of industrial jungle (with muttering voices only early), coming to open out around what present almost as harp arpeggios.... The opening track is also the longest, and doesn't feature piano, rather various electronics (perhaps in glissandi...) & spatialization. It can even come off as a sort of variant on Braxton's Diamond Curtain Wall Music. (Later tracks have passages that are more dominated by piano though, including playing classic styles at times, such that there can be a sense of \"genre\" evoked later in the program, even as it's passing....) String Noise Sounds is thus a world-making sort of album, sometimes evocative of other contemporary improvising string formations (e.g. Ernesto Rodrigues & e.g. String Theory), but generally challenging direct comparisons: The focus on developing through continuity does suggest various contemporary pan-stylistic bands though, particularly as the core violin duo can be rendered almost unrecognizable through the ensemble interactions, despite nearly constant (e.g. \"whistling\" & creaking) activity. That said, the more open textures here are probably the more striking overall, in what can seem like a relatively preliminary (& generally energetic) (re?)-exploration. Both dates-sides then end abruptly, each having settled into similarly aggressive & dense collective textures.\n\n25 August 2023\n\nThen speaking of composition, the past year also seems to have been big for releases of music by Pauline Oliveros (1932-2016): Per the previous entry, Altamirage — consisting of improvised duos between the composer & bassist James Ilgenfritz, plus performances of two of Oliveros' compositions from the 1960s — actually appeared late last year, as noted in the previous review of a \"K7 Commission\" release from Infrequent Seams, Ekphrastic Discourse (in January). Sound Pieces then appeared on Another Timbre from cellist Anton Lukoszevieze & Apartment House, consisting entirely of compositions (from 1975-1998): I've found Sound Pieces appealing, and have continued to listen since it appeared, but didn't write a review at the time. In large part, this reflects uncertainty on my part, both in terms of the general context of Oliveros' compositional output (as I have no real survey, etc.) & the technical specifics of the works themselves: Many are \"text pieces\" with little or no musical notation, but instructions or choices for the performer. Discussions are then sometimes framed around Oliveros' Deep Listening practice, which seems straightforward in an overall way, but about which I know few specifics. So I've been unsure where to start (but part of that is going to need to be developing my own language connections...). And I've been affected by the Apartment House readings (which consist of performances from late 2022 into 2023...), but they also tend to be very careful, relatively smooth (in the way this group plays a lot of post-Cage music...), maybe even tentative at times. In contrast, improvisations with Oliveros herself can be quite intense, including on Altamirage — where the (early) compositions are rather spiky as well, showing an almost Webernian concentration of gesture. (Oliveros ultimately combines this sort of concentration with close attention to human intimacy per se, yielding a powerful affective stance.) So there's a sense of wondering just \"how much\" Oliveros' text pieces really contribute to a musical outcome, with such a question actually fitting rather well into my prior comments on judging the usefulness of musical outcomes (i.e. as products), and I've indeed found this orientation to be especially clear through the lens of the most recent release here: Two or Three (pace Altamirage) is also an older recording (apparently from March 2018), released just last weekend (on Chicago's Amalgam Music), combining Oliveros' compositions with improvisation. In this case, the title composition — a commission from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, completed shortly before her death in 2016 — is performed in three versions, interspersed with longer improvisations. (The performers are Chicago sax frontman Mars Williams (b.1955), noted here way back in May 2012 with Extraordinary Popular Delusions, but perhaps best known for his An Ayler Xmas albums since 2016, and a musician currently recovering as I understand from a serious illness — plus CSO musicians Katinka Kleijn & Rob Kassinger on cello & bass.) And as usual here, I have no idea what is really specified in the composition, although it's described as offering the performer choices, but the fact is that the composed pieces come off more compellingly than the improvisations. (Of the latter, the first seems to be a memorial, almost a dirge at times, while the second is more open-ended & exploratory, but only really comes together around a typical free jazz, horn-centric dynamic....) Again there's this sense of Webernian pointillism, particularly at first, but weaving in more spectral shading as well, yielding a naturalistic (quasi-primitivist) counterpoint, a kind of haunting suspension or latency. (One thus gets a double sense of \"spectral\" here as well.) So how does Oliveros do it? What is the practical means by which her participation via texts makes for more compelling music? Again, I'm working with a very limited sense of what these pieces specify (i.e. tentatively myself...), but I've noted here in the past a sense of when free improvisation becomes more \"coherent\" (to pick one partly-useful word I've used...), and generally an issue with ongoing satisfaction isn't so much with the techniques or even the quality of the ideas per se, but rather in coming together into some kind of whole. And often there seem to be tacit agreements about where to go or what to play, sometimes a few comments exchanged between musicians to start, or maybe just a shared image or orientation that isn't even articulated. However, particularly as possibilities multiply, some kind of \"framework\" becomes more meaningful — or less universally implied (or tacit), I might say. Enter Oliveros, who seems to have anticipated this sort of scenario, the notion that maybe \"improvisation\" could use a further (variable) conceptual orientation or specificity.... (Note how e.g. Cage distrusted improvisation, albeit based on his practical experiences of what performers did under those circumstances. He thus didn't think \"past\" improvisation, i.e. to where we are today, basically not so much genre-bound anymore, but with \"too much\" in the way of possibilities for any particular moment.) So then given the \"choice\" framework for Two or Three, are we to guess e.g. that the orchestral musicians made the piece more contrapuntal than it might have been from others? I don't know, but I do know that these Oliveros albums seem to bring together something beyond the performers themselves. And I also know that a smooth, placid presentation wasn't how Oliveros appeared herself. (Even pictures of her meditating seem \"socially\" intense somehow.) However, there is also ultimately a sense of affective healing here, once again....\n\n28 August 2023\n\nHunt at the Brook (recorded in 2014) has felt like a pivotal album for me, in terms of finding my own interests in this space, i.e. as slowly moving away from following a variety of other sources (as can seem inevitable...), into more personal priorities & articulations. Moreover, that's been underscored by ongoing interest in the performers involved: Just this past May, I reviewed It used to be an elephant (recorded in 2022 & released on Daniel Thompson's Empty Birdcage label), a quintet combining the original trio with frequent collaborators Dirk Serries & Colin Webster. (That album comes off as more exploratory, preliminary again with its unusual ensemble....) And there I'd traced some historical relations as well, including to me in this space, so I'll skip over some of that now. Nonetheless, the recent release of two albums at once on Serries' \"A New Wave of Jazz\" label — Hunt at the Brook Again & with Neil Metcalfe — necessitates some further thoughts on chronology (as well as confirms that Hunt at the Brook was a significant project for the trio of musicians involved): The addition of Metcalfe on flute for the second album of this double release raises as well his participation (with Thompson) in Runcible Quintet, e.g. their own quartet formation on (half of) Four suggesting something of the quartet interaction here. Of course, the Runcible albums have more in the way of rhythmic articulation via drums, but there's a sort of tuneful \"anthropology music\" cultivated as well. (This is a notion I've been articulating here over the past few years, namely musical inspiration from \"natural\" sounds, e.g. zoomimesis, or in this case more in the way of outdoor resonances woven into a sort of harmonic tapestry....) And there's likewise a sort of pointillism much of the time underlying Hunt at the Brook, multiple relations woven more densely than a real (ecological) scene, evoking multiple perspectives & collisions in counterpoint.... So the chronology here implicates Runcible as well, the latter's most recent album Three having been recorded in March 2019 (& reviewed here in May 2020), followed by Hunt at the Brook Again in April 2019 & Hunt at the Brook with Neil Metcalfe in May 2019. And I'd already been emphasizing post-pandemic productions here, so this does come to seem like the past.... Still, both albums have been quite compelling, and further (even centrally...) illuminate subsequent productions: 2019 had opened for Thompson & Benedict Taylor recording the double duo album T'other in January (launching Thompson's new label...), as reviewed here in November 2020, i.e. only after I'd reviewed the horn-less SETT (recorded in November 2019, and first documenting the unusual double acoustic guitar formations that followed these trio & quartet chamber ensembles...). (Taylor himself also went on to record a series of duos that year, including Live Offerings 2019 with Serries, reviewed here in March 2021, plus e.g. Knotted Threads with Yves Charuest on Inexhaustible Editions.... Moving ahead then, he appears with Serries & e.g. with Stefan Keune for the middle disc of Live at Plus-Etage, Volume 1 too, recorded last September: That understated triple album, also produced by Serries, includes two striking duo recitals as well, from different musicians who also intersect this unit sometimes.) Meanwhile, I've had more of an \"in order\" (if sparser...) chronology for clarinetist Tom Jackson (who joined the core Hunt at the Brook trio later, replacing Alex Ward from Compost, as reviewed here in April 2013...), appearing e.g. with the trio album Nauportus with Thompson (reviewed already July 2019, but after the present recordings were made), and then Dandelion (actually recorded in the interim in 2021) with Serries instead on guitar. (The latter was also presented in big, dynamic 24bit sound — as are now Hunt at the Brook Again & Hunt at the Brook with Neil Metcalfe....) And then Thompson himself has recently e.g. reprised his duo with Webster, releasing However, Forward! (as recorded only last October) this month on Webster's Raw Tonk label, yielding a relatively tighter articulation for that ongoing formation.... So then one thing I've (apparently) learned from doing this sort of review over the years is that it becomes too easy simply to trace relations.... What about the specific music? Why do I return (even to 2019 yet again)? For one, there's always more to appreciate, even to learn! For instance, sometimes I feel smart for appreciating the original Hunt at the Brook, but the notes for this new release also tell me that I didn't pick up on title, which names the engineer & (studio) location. (So then I don't feel so smart.) Anyway, I'd instead focused on the outdoorsy quality (pace the previous), and even a sense of nostalgia, i.e. as \"also\" reflected in the track titles. (And admittedly, the fact that this was a substantial album, lengthy rather than short, figured into my interest in those days, i.e. offering more to chew on over time....) Now the \"new\" albums — & they're still significantly more recent than the original trio, even if one wonders why the delayed release... — dispense with track titles (as so often in this space...), figuring similar material inspirations into a denser & more detailed network, seeming to leave behind nostalgia per se (about which I've already expressed ambivalence...). (There's of course still the matter of my own familiarity....) So while Hunt at the Brook Again provides a remarkably taut & lively exploration of some of the earlier ideas in greater depth & concentration (as befitting a reprise five years later...), Hunt at the Brook with Neil Metcalfe then broaches some different interactions, more in the way of harmonic shading (e.g. via register between the two woodwinds), yielding almost a modernist vibe in more chordal sections (& incorporating e.g. traffic, beyond anything potentially idyllic...). A similar, more chordal (v. pointillist) approach then opens It used to be an elephant (without Metcalfe), before turning elsewhere.... Acoustic guitar particularly feels like a pivot for the quartet formation, articulating counterpoints rhythmically, the potentially chordal viola often functioning more like a horn, raucous even at times, almost an alto sax.... Hunt at the Brook with Neil Metcalfe can thus feel almost like three top lines — & regular readers will know that pairing flute with clarinet was likely to appeal to me... — yielding a \"different\" approach to (fluid) harmonic combinations, pace e.g. \"spectral\" ideas on (\"natural\") overtone relations. There's also some real \"fire\" on both albums, especially from violist Taylor, but the \"modernist\" feel also involves tangible affective modulation, a sort of sinking-calming at times (including dueling runs...), moody... maybe sometimes almost new age-y? But with its assertive opening & quicker pace of articulation & dynamics, Hunt at the Brook Again had already made Hunt at the Brook seem relatively more stark (or classic...), similar materials & inspiration worked further into more intricate articulations.... Both formations are still able to summon a sense of quiet (or even silence) as well, via basic fluidity figuring dynamics throughout. As far as musical parameters per se then, i.e. in addition to their articulation of an abstracted ecology, it's perhaps this sense for \"dynamics\" that most marks this group of colleagues as (sometimes) a collective. Theirs is thus a rich (rather than simplistic...) interaction with the world (& especially its outdoor sonic palette...), yielding a regime of actively shifting attention, figuration & human choice as well. Counterpoint per se then comes to feel like a condensation or embodiment of multiply intersecting experiences.\n\n11 September 2023\n\nMoving to a shorter & more recently recorded album, next I want to note Flight Rvw2349 by Georg Wissel (alto sax), Guilherme Rodrigues (cello) & Michael Vorfeld (percussion) — recorded live by Sacred Realism's Bryan Eubanks in Berlin this past April. The result is relatively short, basically including a restart midway, but capturing an intense sense of ritual sonic communion, especially through its opening gesture. (The reference is again to a \"spectral\" sense of harmony, of blending instrumental timbres via overtones, i.e. \"acoustics\" in the sense of e.g. John Butcher & Induction, there with more sense of intentionality or distance, here seeming more intimate per se....) Of course, I've noted Rodrigues here often, especially with his father Ernesto (e.g. with recent favorites Dérive & L'âge de l'oreille), but also in finding his own style, intuitive & sometimes warmly lyrical, but also with its own kind of starkness, linear & distended, e.g. articulated in trio (without Ernesto) on Kita, Rodrigues & Yamagishi (as reviewed here in July 2020). But while that album can come off as something of a (linear) travelogue, Flight Rvw2349 cultivates instead an intense sense of vertical resonance & place. (And a similar sweep & energy dynamic could describe another notable Rodrigues trio album to appear recently outside of Creative Sources, Zwosch, Zwosch & Zwosch from A New Wave of Jazz — pace the previous entry... — there with Carlos Zingaro & José Oliveira, also yielding a single 32' track, but recorded already in July 2021....) And I'd recently mentioned both Wissel & Vorfeld here as well: Wissel released a \"similar\" album in Thirty Nine Fifty Five (as mentioned in a March 2023 review of Etienne Nillesen & T.ON...), the second with his C/W|N trio, \"generally sparse but deeply fusing the instrumental resonances & timbres,\" i.e. involving a similar approach, but there more ethereal around sparse piano (versus rich cello tone). Wissel's horn thus ranges here from a sort of background resonance or accent to brief, piercing intensity — i.e. as the \"edge\" of a twisting, composite trio timbre. (There's some quietly intense vocalizing as one climax too, but I'm unsure of the source.) And then Vorfeld was e.g. involved in longtime favorite Nashaz (from which I eventually started talking about a \"nautical\" style of overtone relations...), plus more recently (again) with Sawt Out, that trio's Black Current & Machine Learning having been reviewed here together just this past July — all involving explorations of overtone alignments, often with high intensity. So this trio & its unassuming self-release (only on Rodrigues' Bandcamp site...) came as a surprise, but there was still plenty of reason to anticipate an intriguing result. And as far as the sense of ritual? I guess that's how acoustic resonance & timbral blending can present themselves, fusion of relations per se as always already a sort of ritual. (And I should note as well on this point Rodrigues' own solo album from last year, Acoustic Reverb, set in a variety of churches....) In that sense, one perceives the evocation of an evolving genre or scene here, while also being especially direct, i.e. with strong intimacy (as already suggested), but without much sense of superfluous ideas or busy-ness. (Such a sense of \"genre\" can come to mark tonality per se as itself a broad abstraction....) What one finds then, or so I think I hear, is the trio overcome by its own ritual intensity, coming to skulk about midway (so moving to some reflexive techniques...), trying to process (intellectually, emotionally) for themselves what just occurred.... (That would be as opposed to the sort of \"distance\" or planning suggested elsewhere above... but also not atypical of an improvised meeting....) So maybe they'll reconvene at some point. In the meantime, Flight Rvw2349 (the title of which eludes me too...) already has some electric moments.\n\n12 September 2023\n\nSestetto Internazionale is another ongoing collective developing its own sound, now with a third album, Due Mutabili from Munich live in March 2022. I'd reviewed the sextet's second album Live in Munich 2019 in March 2020, there including some fascinating six-way material at times, but also some tracks for reduced forces, a bit of odds & ends, maybe even seeming somewhat genre-bound in moments.... Their lineup of three soprano instruments against three \"harmonic backdrop\" instruments remained intriguing though, and Due Mutabili provides two substantial tracks documenting ongoing developments, also with more in the way of overall continuity (although, of course, still with passages of reduced forces, etc.). Moreover, there aren't many sextets that manage to stay together very long to develop a collective sound. In this case, there was actually a change from the previous album, with Philipp Wachsmann (violin, live electronics) replacing Alison Blunt, but the core of the group remains the soprano saxophone duo of Harri Sjöström & Gianni Mimmo, joined by violin on the front line, and then a timbrally rich \"continuo section\" of Achim Kaufmann (piano), Veli Kujala (quarter-tone accordion) & Ignaz Schick (turntables, sampler). Although the sextet does turn to what I might call \"intentional weirdness\" at times (e.g. the cartoonish, haunted or carnivalesque...), there's a growing sense of continuity as well maintained through the tracks: Sestetto Internazionale seems to be adopting something of the \"ontology of motion\" from the Move quintet (& e.g. their second album Move in Moers, as reviewed here in April 2021...), a group also founded by Sjöström (with vibraphonist Emilio Gordoa) & similarly involving Kaufmann: \"Move\" seems to retain more of a jazz reference though, i.e. with bass & drums, but the main difference from the evolution of Sestetto Internazionale is in the latter's double (& then triple, with violin...) top line, also distinguishing it from e.g. Evan Parker ensembles (i.e. around a single soprano, & to which I'd already compared Move...). There's also an electroacoustic component here then, and indeed Parker himself introduces the subsequent (acoustic) soprano duet album between Sjöström & Mimmo, the surprisingly full-bodied Wells (recorded in April 2022). So that original duo can still seem like something of a reduction of the larger group, or at least as evoking it, i.e. not unlike Parker's recent release with Sergio Armaroli, Dialog (on Ezz-thetics), on which he responds (later, in solo) to Armaroli's vibraphone solos: That album illustrates harmonic context & line as sorts of inversions of each other — & a similar nexus informs Sestetto Internazionale as well. But I wasn't turning to Armaroli arbitrarily: Kujala appeared with Sjöström on Armaroli's Windows & Mirrors (as reviewed here in December 2022), and also with Schick on Frank Gratkowski's Kuden (recorded in 2021) — which I'd mentioned in a brief \"accordion survey\" around a review of the trio album Stranger Becoming with Jonas Kocher (also in December 2022). I've been noting accordion regularly of late it seems, here with quarter tones extending pitch flexibility-fixity for the sextet, but also e.g. pairing with \"reedy\" horns or suggesting an electronic (e.g. synth) quality themselves. I also seem to encounter Schick in many places lately, e.g. with John Butcher on his \"celebration\" quartet album Lamenti dall'infinito (reviewed here in a series in February 2022), although his contributions can be less obvious at times (pace e.g. the static \"ticks\" opening the second track here, but then also \"cartoon\" eruptions...). And most of these instruments do have pitch flexibility, with Kaufmann's piano being the main exception, yet Kaufmann always seems to be able to contribute meaningfully to these sorts of tapestries.... (I'm not sure how he's able to transcend his own pitch limitations so regularly.) In any case, there does seem to be some real commitment to this sextet formation at this point — & Sjöström has self-released Due Mutabili, with e.g. Wells (released already in July) having made it onto streaming sites... — even as it can still seem rather exploratory. (It would probably also benefit from the clarity of 24bit recording.) The pregnant, rhetorical opening — plus the subtle entrances of the various instruments — will surely make an impression, though. There're also some feelings of routine developing over the long album, for better or worse, sometimes broken up by self-conscious novelty. However, the basic structural setup, combined with ongoing explorations of continuities (i.e. with further parallels to Anthony Braxton & ZIM), suggests much more potential — as well as seems to line up with broader explorations & trends....\n\nSo bringing Wachsmann into Sestetto Internazionale seems as though it could have led directly to his participation, with Sjöström, in an \"alternative\" Xpact quartet album — as also just released, on Wachsmann's Bead Records — Especially For You (recorded seven months later in October 2022, also in Munich). Apparently the concert was supposed to be part of a tour by Xpact — which I haven't actually reviewed (although it's an even longer running formation, sometimes now called Xpact II...) — but Stefan Keune & Hans Schneider couldn't attend, and so were replaced by Sjöström & Wachsmann, i.e. joining Erhard Hirt (guitar & computer treatment) & Paul Lytton (drums, cymbals, objects) from the original quartet. And without bass or the fire-breathing Keune (pace Hunt at the Brook Again thoughts here from earlier this week...), the quartet does come off completely differently: There's a generally ethereal, even thin thread maintained by electronics, often with subtle shifting & meandering otherwise. (The specter of Parker & his ElectroAcoustic Ensemble appears as well, especially with Lytton's participation, although the latter isn't apparently using electronics here himself.... And then, I'm unfamiliar with Hirt outside of Xpact.) The sound of accordion is also evoked from early in the proceedings, so presumably working with Kujala has made an impression on Wachsmann, who continues to be prolific himself.... So there're varieties of novel textures, some relatively understated, but also e.g. feelings of being asea, even evoking a sort of chaotic or imaginary realm, perhaps a kind of surreality — i.e. not really referencing physical space, but more a psychic space. There's again an issue with establishing-losing the feeling of novelty though, and the long (& often relatively unassertive) Especially For You ends up requiring sustained attention from the listener as well (i.e to its delicate continuities, rather than being actively gripping itself). In any case, pace the preceding, these are all flexible pitch instruments, and their interactions tend to feature airy (i.e. almost floating — as opposed e.g. to the basic gravity at times from the Sestetto...) & \"twisting\" textures. Thus it seems there would also be more to discover here, if the quartet does decide to develop its sound further. And of course Bead continues to be a label to watch (with, it seems, also some of their releases coming to streaming services...).\n\n13 September 2023\n\nNow the DDK Trio has released their third album (on the eclectic & often stimulating Meenna label out of Japan), A Right to Silence having been recorded over a 5-day residency in France during June 2021, and presented as three differing sequences: One might call these three different albums, as the three members of the trio each arranged material gathered over the course of the residency into a single album. And so I want to discuss this interrogation of the production process, but also to highlight the musical material involved, which itself involves precise sorts of austere post-Cage figurations. The musical articulations & surrounding rhetorical-affective implications thus seem more sophisticated for A Right to Silence than DDK's previous albums, Floating piece of space (recorded in 2014) & Cone of Confusion (2017). The music would also seem to go beyond the presentation of a \"triple\" album per se, particularly as the production itself extends the trio's stated non-influence-in-the-choice-of-the-other attitude — an attitude seemingly reflected from Cage, yielding for him a sort of \"affect at a distance,\" a notion more applicable to appraising the three versions of this album as a whole than it is to the musical interactions per se. There's thus a tangible sense of entering the production process for the listener: I've often wondered how e.g. the material appearing on a studio album was chosen, or ordered, because that's usually unstated. How much unused material is there, for instance? That's likewise unstated here.... What we're presented with, however, is a set of 14 different pieces, most appearing on all three programs (which consist of 10, 8 & 8 tracks respectively...), but not all, the pieces presented identically whenever they do appear, except for the possibility of inserting silences framing each, and in different orders. (There's an included discussion of this procedure, which is itself somewhat confusing, so I'm trying to run through it in some detail, because it's a new approach. One thing that does remain unspecified is how & when the individual pieces were named. I'm guessing it was collectively & after the programs were chosen.) The three versions are also personal choices, not chance orderings, so from a Cageian perspective, these would be performance choices. (One often lacks synchronicity with a musical performance, e.g. when discussing in this space, and such an interval is highlighted here.) And the result is three differing aesthetic narratives, although with considerable overlap, basically generating three perspectives on the material, yet yielding some kind of gestalt. These are thus relatively short quasi-ambient tapestries, which I'm usually disappointed to have end, even if they don't necessarily dominate my attention, while the differing versions do delay feelings of developing familiarity.... And as implied, the basic sound world of A Right to Silence recalls Cage as well, i.e. not so much indoor or outdoor sonic references (per various recent remarks here...), but sorts of \"human\" (i.e. musical-rhetorical) abstractions. (The articulation of piano chords, as well as the thin \"extended\" lines from others, specifically recall some of Cage's late sonic concerns....) The results can also feel like aural vignettes, intense or suspenseful in some moments (gestural, not unlike film music at times...), a sort of \"nuts & bolts\" approach that emphasizes precision & austerity over larger flow (e.g. contrasting with tapestries such as Due Mutabili, from the previous review...). It's also possible that illuminating the different individual perspectives removes the sense of \"naturalness\" (or magic) from the proceedings — such that the named (& \"instant composed\") pieces from DDK can come to seem pre-composed. (I'm not able to draw any clear conclusion on this point, however.) Their basic sound then overlaps with & differs from the field: DDK can sound quite pianistic around founder Jacques Demierre (b.1954), such that even when he's e.g. scuffling with strings, the results seem framed & piano-gestural.... And then accordion is becoming something of a theme itself, here again from Jonas Kocher (pace the previous review discussion & Stranger Becoming, a more ethereal, yet twisting or even flowery trio album...), who offers various held tones & pitch extremes in addition to some harmonic figurations, sometimes sounding like strings.... (And Demierre had appeared here previously only with Hans Koch — also from Stranger Becoming — i.e. with the duo album Incunabulum, reviewed July 2019.) The second \"D\" is then Axel Dörner, who's appeared in this space for a while (e.g. with Ernesto Rodrigues & the quartet Nor, first tentatively reviewed here in April 2015...), and most often performs windy breath or precise blasts of static here, again generally either in isolated figures or briefly repetitive backdrops. There's thus little in the way of traditional horn \"expression,\" but the trumpet register also makes for differing interactions from those of what seems like the most obvious ensemble comparison, HMZ: The latter trio employs tuba instead, and viol rather than accordion (but then adds harmonica for e.g. Ize, after already functioning similarly via held tones...), but the piano comes off differently as well, generally less pianistic (e.g. more gamelan...) than DDK, yielding again even to synth (& so more of the \"accordion sound\"). Ize is then the fourth album from HMZ (recorded back in 2018, although released during lockdown), their first having been recorded in 2012, so over a slightly earlier time interval than DDK.... It does also yield a sense of flow (as less abstracted & \"framed\" than DDK's here). Indeed HMZ seems to involve a somewhat newer timbral grammar, more impersonal: A comparison can be made as well to perhaps Demierre's most prolific ensemble, the LDP trio & their most recent (double) album Last Concert in Europe (released last year by Jazzwerkstatt), there showing a similar (to DDK) urge toward abstraction (& various scuffling), as well as extended exploration of dynamics, but also being more explicitly moody & even retaining some feeling of jazz. There's likewise a lingering question there of \"What about individual, human expression?\" i.e. that a group such as HMZ seems be leaving behind.... (So this is in some sense a question of musical generations, in the case of DDK involving those born in the 1950s, 60s & 70s.) Then when it comes again back to nuts & bolts, and the basic sound of A Right to Silence, there're other comparisons, specifically both younger & older: Great Waitress (& e.g. their landmark second album Flock, from 2013) involves reed instead of brass in an otherwise similarly constituted trio, there eerily fusing timbres into ritualistic sculptures. And then Nessuno involved both brass & reed in a quartet, again a little more old-fashioned in its sense of ensemble dynamics, but generating various textural suspensions as well, eventually with great (virtuosic...) intensity. A Right to Silence thus comes to feel as though it establishes its own (sometimes starkly, always precisely...) gestural sonic dynamic, embracing a sense of human distance between the musicians, multiple (production) versions aside.\n\n19 September 2023\n\nAnd Zyft — Henk Zwerver (acoustic guitar), Ziv Taubenfeld (bass clarinet) & Maya Felixbrodt (viola) — returns as well with Triangle Moments, just recorded in Amsterdam in June. The result is a more assertive & intricate trio interaction than for their first album, Midnight Tea Suite (favored here in April 2019, part of a rambling survey of Zwerver on Creative Sources...). Given the instrumentation then, there's a clear parallel to Hunt at the Brook Again & its review here earlier this month. One might even suggest some evocations of nostalgia in each case, more for the first album from the latter trio, and then Zyft's first outing still evoked more of a hint of rock/genre. So the \"Zyft\" name also suggests something unimportant, and it'd be difficult to assert that the trio really reaches for expression beyond itself (or beyond the everyday), but the forging of an egalitarian three-way interaction remains worthwhile in itself (as is the everyday...). Indeed Triangle Moments builds to a more unusual texture by the end, incorporating more extended technique, so there's still a sense of exploration.... (Although Zwerver has been relatively quiet since that prior batch of recordings, Taubenfeld has continued to raise his profile, e.g. with a Clean Feed leader album, while Felixbrodt is still someone I've heard only with this unit.... And viola does again bring some of the most intense & distinctive interjections here.) So there's some intensity at times, including to start, but generally more of a three-way conversation, perhaps one musician briefly taking the lead, soon back to a very collective feel & to composite (& contrapuntal, often pointillist around guitar) activity: The conversational style can quickly put the listening mind abuzz, but also opens up with time for more space to think. The compact Triangle Moments thus seems to invite a sort of local, yet far-ranging, \"political\" debate.\n\n25 September 2023\n\nFrom Another Timbre is then Parallaxis forma, a new album devoted to composer Catherine Lamb (b.1982), as recorded from June through August this year by Nicholas Moroz & Explore Ensemble (with vocalists Exaudi Music Ensemble & Lotte Betts-Dean). And I'm once again offering a review shortly after release, as is my habit & project here, even as that might seem especially tenuous for newly composed music, but I'm doing it in part now to affirm my ongoing interest in Lamb, whose Divisio spiralis I'd reviewed here as part of the Kairos album Aggregate Forms in March 2022: I've continued to find Lamb's music useful & appealing, regularly turning to a few pieces from time to time in the interim, so although Parallaxis forma (named after the longest piece on its program, as opposed to so many Lamb albums, which seem to have entirely different names...) doesn't really seem to be a groundbreaking album itself, I do want to trace its relations. In particular, Divisio spiralis (for string quartet) continues to be an amazing piece, and as I've listened to the JACK Quartet rendition more often, I've also come to hear more of the intonation lapses (that Christopher Otto does apologize for in the notes, part of the process of a human rendering...). Still, this fanning, multi-dimensional piece definitely evokes Nada-Brahma for me, sound revealing the mysterious beauty of the universe.... And that's actually typical of Lamb, if most developed (so far) there. Also mentioned then in that long review paragraph were Muto infinitas (2016/18) — also released by Another Timbre, increasingly a major label in the post-Cage space, and increasingly supportive of Lamb specifically — & the Prisma Interius series: Those continue to be my other favorite Lamb pieces, the former (understated) for quarter-tone flute & double bass, but finding endless subtle variation over nearly an hour.... I've listened to this piece dozens of times, and it exemplifies how Lamb's music doesn't lead into stasis, despite its smooth contours: It's indeed constantly changing in shade & color. (The music is thus completely unlike e.g. repetition of rhythmically contoured piano chords, i.e. \"traditional minimalism.\") And then the latter series climaxes (& ends?) with Prisma Interius IX: I didn't mention that piece specifically before, but it's also been recorded (by Ensemble Dedalus, cited here performing Erik M.'s Fata Morgana in a February 2023 review...) & released by New World Records in 2019, on the album Atmospheres Transparent/Opaque. I did mention a previous recording of VII & VIII though, released by Berlin's Sacred Realism, of which Lamb is a member. (And as it happens, I just mentioned Sacred Realism again here, since Bryan Eubanks recorded Guilherme Rodrigues' Flight Rvw2349, as reviewed earlier this month.... Indeed the coincidences are flying fast, as drummer Todd Capp's Oceans Roar 1000 Drums has just released its second album — today! — Gowanus, recorded last year in Brooklyn. Lamb herself doesn't play \"secondary rainbow synthesizer\" on the new album though, as she had on their first, i.e. as already mentioned here in that March 2022 review.... Anyway, it's worth noting that the group has connections in New York as well, bringing music of jazzy echoes & perpetual anticipation....) And moreover, Another Timbre has released Translucent Harmonies in this batch too, featuring Lamb's Prisma Interius VIII as half of its program! This is not with the larger chamber ensemble (including the \"rainbow\" synth, which captures & filters room resonance...) though, but rather the \"melodic duo\" of the piece (on violin & viola): With the series supposedly being \"about\" the filter, I'm not sure why the choice. In any case, it's indeed IX that's impressed me most, although I'd be interested to hear the full cycle in a single (unified? I assume that's best...) presentation. Turning back to Parallaxis forma then, the three works on the album all feature voices: I didn't mention Scelsi among the prior Lamb thoughts, but it's worth doing so here, particularly with her vocal music of abstract phonemes & vowel effects (while Scelsi can feature distinctive consonant attacks as well...), but also the slowly shifting microtones in general (of e.g. the Muto infinitas duo). However, Scelsi's works often come off as \"miniatures\" in comparison to Lamb's extended tapestries, i.e. as messages from other realms (as he put it...) versus the latter's offers to dwell there. That sort of nexus comes off especially with Pulse / Shade (2014) for four voices, actually released earlier this year by \"The Present\" (on album Ex Utero from Col legno...) too, but performed on Parallaxis forma via computer overlay & manipulation of a single vocalist: The latter was done for practical purposes of precision, especially for the opposite tempi progressions between the parts, and also yields a rendition twice the length.... The title piece had been mentioned in the prior review too, as already released on Norway's Hubro label (in 2019) from Ensemble neoN, and actually that from Explore Ensemble comes off rather more rhetorically, e.g. affectively suggesting despair & then hope (versus the earlier reading, which seems more in line with Lamb's preference for \"matter-of-fact\" expression — i.e. pace realism?). The most appealing (or at least new) piece on the new album is then probably the shortest, Color / Residua (2016/2020) for three voices & four string instruments, producing more of a composite effect, a sense of voices fluttering, even tricking me into thinking brass instruments appear.... And already in the prior review, I'd mentioned Lamb's teacher Tenney, as well as her influences from Indian dhrupad (itself originally a vocal music...), and these remain evident: Lamb's straightforward ordering of materials contrasts e.g. with the whimsical Cage, even builds to climaxes, i.e. despite the cool or often (e.g. rhythmically) uncontoured \"sound\" that the two might have in common.... And then the basic opening to sound, the sense of the sacred in sound, of moving beyond a \"linear\" articulation, beyond the sort of \"braiding\" I'd mentioned (inadequately) before, brings a kind of \"fanning\" as already noted above, i.e. a sort of ongoing opening to more (sonic) dimensions via shifting microtonal combinations (& even contrasting tempi...), i.e. continuous plays of consonance & dissonance over the smallest spaces, subtly sheering motion & constant change.... (Indeed, one might evoke the spectral in its double meaning here, again.) And then Lamb does seem to be developing her style, itself already obviously more practical than Tenney's (at times anyway...), since various musicians are releasing multiple versions of her works, i.e. is finding a way to indicate & notate these kinds of microtonal dimensions in ways that make practical sense to performers.... There already does seem to have been much development, in fact, from Parallaxis forma (2016) & then the Prisma Interius series (ending in 2018?), into the imposing Divisio spiralis (2019), and now with Lamb's increasing prestige from a 2020 composition prize (which in part prompted these next recordings, apparently...). So what's to come? (I guess she had e.g. a piece at the British Proms this summer too....) Of course, I'm also usually featuring performers here, less often composers per se. And so I've also noted Lamb as performer, but perhaps I should explicitly mention a previous Another Timbre release, Viola Torros (from 2019, seemingly a peak Lamb year...) with Johnny Chang (with each on viola), including as supplemented by e.g. rainbow synth for Lamb's Prisma Interius VI — although that earlier double album does still feel less multi-dimensional....\n\n26 September 2023\n\nTurning to an album released earlier in the year, recorded (in Berlin) only last November (so still less than a year ago...), Conundrum presents a sophisticated quintet interaction between Ernesto Rodrigues (here on violin), Guilherme Rodrigues, Ernesto's longtime colleague Nuno Torres (on alto sax), and German masters Alexander von Schlippenbach & Willi Kellers. I didn't review the album when it appeared, in large part due to the fame of von Schlippenbach — & because of course I already write so often about Rodrigues. Besides that I'm always turning away from piano here then, particularly beyond equal temperament (& indeed a relatively traditional piano sound is involved...), I simply didn't believe that these well-established musicians \"needed\" my attention. But then I started to fret that Conundrum wasn't getting enough attention elsewhere, because I do find it to be a rather compelling synthesis... with substantially polyphonic interactions & various active allusions. So as I'd also alluded in the review of Hunt at the Brook Again from September, my own aesthetic narrative takes me back to various (productive) familiarities, styles & combos that I particularly enjoy (& in which I've invested time...), even as I might be telling myself that I want to diversify more.... And there's an authenticity to discussing what one enjoys, so it's not something I want to dismiss in any way, but there's also a drive toward exploration that familiarities can blunt.... In any case, not that I have the (supernatural) ability to speak for anyone else anyway, but I'm still no expert on Schlippenbach's extensive & impressive career as an improvising pianist. Nor was I an expert on Günter \"Baby\" Sommer when I had the opportunity to write the liner notes for the release of the Rodrigueses' quartet album with Sommer, Not Bad (recorded in June 2022 & released in January 2023), but I could talk there a bit about differing generations & continuing to build new worlds.... I also didn't do justice to horn player Gonçalo Mortágua for that discussion, who I came to realize was basically making his debut — in an album featuring the Rodrigues approach to extended string timbres & spectral harmonies, while evoking e.g. a \"world vibe\" (which can be said of jazz in general, I suppose...). It also involved a relatively linear presentation of musical ideas... unlike Conundrum, which tackles more in the way of vertical dimensions & modes of harmonic motion. (There're some real jazz evocations from members of the quintet briefly too, but also quite a bit of prickly polyphonic intensity amid shifting timbres.) Conundrum certainly doesn't involve anyone's debut either, as these are all very experienced improvising musicians. And while I don't have much experience myself e.g. with Schlippenbach's Globe Unity Orchestra, or really as much focus on Ernesto's larger ensembles either, the two obviously come with extensive experience in forging larger groups, surely part of what makes this quintet session almost immediately flow.... (Despite my disclaimers, I've actually mentioned Schlippenbach a few times here: He'd appeared with Red Dhal Sextet, as reviewed in February 2014, as well as was noted with the quintet Intricacies — along with Kellers — from May 2015.... And Kellers himself first appeared here with the Grid Mesh quartet, as reviewed in November 2013.) And then let me highlight Torres (b.1977) a little more: Appearing on a variety of Rodrigues releases, going back here e.g. to New Dynamics (recorded in 2016) or Setúbal (reviewed in May 2020), Torres is able to play low in textures (e.g. spectrally, i.e. with a sense of geometric acoustics), but also can conjure more soloistic jazzy expression when needed. (The harmonics relation is also a little different here, because Ernesto is on violin, i.e. often higher in the texture.) Conundrum then appears to be the first recording of a little tour that Torres did with the two Rodrigueses (who were maybe also taking up the \"legends\" theme from Not Bad...) last November, with Conspiratorial and fulminate things happen (reviewed this May) & Brecht (mentioned in a January review) already appearing here, but there's also e.g. the more distended Letters to Milena.... And finally the title, Conundrum (with tracks named e.g. for mythical monsters...), does seem (perhaps) to refer to the challenges of combining tempered keyboard with contemporary spectral-timbral string concerns: Some old-fashioned (or \"classic...\") qualities reappear, but the result is surprisingly taut yet fluid as well, generally with much assertive momentum. It almost seems as though they've been playing together for a long time (as the saying goes...).\n\n17 October 2023\n\nThen appearing just this weekend from Poland's Fundacja Sluchaj, Duot with Strings (from a duo plus a quartet, yielding a sextet) presents some similar interactions & textures at times: The group is once again acoustic, but showing a distinct \"ea\" awareness (as even some of Rodrigues' all-acoustic releases are labeled...), no piano, but a string & percussion combination that almost suggests prepared piano at times.... Duot with Strings, recorded in Portugal in December 2021, also suggests a more open-ended exploration, between poles of smooth distension & crunchy counterpoint, which they execute with great fluidity. Indeed, this basic dynamic describes the Duot duo (i.e. Albert Cirera on saxophones & Ramon Prats on drums, launching with the album Duot from 2007, there still feeling explicitly jazzy at times...) already, as the two musicians' other work suggests as well: They were joined by Agustí Fernández to form Liquid Trio (& e.g. Liquid Quintet in turn... pace e.g. a review of The Liquid Trio Plays Bernoulli here in January 2018), but Cirera e.g. plays together with bassist Alvaro Rosso (& guitarist Abdul Moimême) in Dissection Room as well (as reviewed here in October 2018), the two senses of musical dissection & liquification operating together for Duot with Strings.... And they're operated along with the string quartet ZARM, formed by Carlos Zingaro (together with David Alves, also on violin, Ulrich Mitzlaf on cello — & Rosso) to explore a similar polar nexus, in that case stated to be sacred-profane. (And while David Alves was unknown to me, Mitzlaf had appeared e.g. with Zingaro on Chant from 2015, i.e. in another strings-focused ensemble.... Rosso is, of course, a veteran of the Lisbon String Trio. And do note further that this \"jazz string quartet\" is unusual in retaining the classic two violins, instead substituting double bass for viola/alto!) The result is then not only different senses of smoothness, including a sense at times that crunchy counterpoint can emerge within smoothness, but different sorts of polyphonic juxtapositions & even e.g. parallel (sometimes extended...) lines. Per the previous entry then, these two groups come together as a strong combination, one that seems made for each other (including with horn lying low at times...) — & a combination that often yields results rather different from historical styles or genres. There's a sense of growling mystery to open, but big echoing drums come along soon enough, active strings (including harmonics), and really no sense that one of the groups is dominating (or is more \"fundamental\" than...) the other. There's a sense of ritual then, of conjuring (interpenetrating) modes of intensity. And then the overall affective outcome seems to be in senses of transition (& indeed liminality) — itself a growing theme here of late (pace Braxton's ZIM & many other efforts), but distinctively expressed over six (thematic?) tracks on Duot with Strings (with space for more to come...).\n\n18 October 2023\n\nAs long as I'm thinking about albums featuring bowed strings, let me turn now to violist Jessica Pavone (b.1976) & her new album Clamor, recorded this year in Manhattan by Pavone's regular string ensemble (here a sextet), with guest soloist Katherine Young for the middle two (of four) tracks. Much to my surprise, I hadn't actually mentioned Pavone in this space yet, although I'd heard her in various music, including of course with Anthony Braxton. I guess the earlier \"J. Pavone String Ensemble\" albums, while exploring rich string textures & various harmonic ideas, also seemed both relatively repetitive & tonal — pace the Terry Riley reference often associated with Pavone's composed music. So contra e.g. Catherine Lamb's composed music (as reviewed here most recently last month...), there're more echoes of popular or ambient music from Pavone, meaning that although there's no shortage of harmonic relations being investigated, there's less of a strict sense of abstract spreading dimensionality.... There's still a sense of spatiality at times on Clamor though, particularly when higher or lower pitches are involved, even as its potency is more often in the affective-harmonic relational (emotional) domain. And it's quite a potent album, leaving a thundering silence when it concludes, intensely affective at times — especially around Young's howling bassoon, the ensuing liminal textures (with the strings) really prompting this review, i.e. more so than the more tonal-modulating framing pieces... — indeed seeming to take Pavone's compositional activity to a new level. Pavone has been quite prolific then, but as the generally smoother & abstract textures of her earlier string ensemble work give way to more rhetorical dynamism, its affectivity rises..... So maybe I should've already mentioned ... of Late (released last year) here, as it launches with newly assertive intensity, although ends up seeming less substantial overall: There the \"string ensemble\" is pared to a trio (again incorporating some vocalizing, as typical of Pavone... including for her solo viola album from Relative Pitch early last year, When No One Around You is There but Nowhere to be Found...). A previous \"structural\" precedent for Clamor can be noted in Lull (released in 2021) as well: That outing involves a string octet, plus drum & trumpet soloists on some tracks, but Clamor seems that much more fluid (as did ... of Late). And then Young is someone I'd noted here also with Braxton (e.g. DCWM), while the string ensemble consists of Pavone herself (also a soloist...) with Aimée Niemann (violin), Charlotte Munn-Wood (violin), Abby Swidler (viola), Mariel Roberts (cello, a soloist too...) & Shayna Dulberger (double bass). (And I'd actually noted the latter two, respectively in trio with Apocalypso in September 2013, and with Nate Wooley — a soloist from Lull — in Mutual Aid Music, as reviewed here in May 2021.) There's then a bit of folksy quality to Clamor at times as well — differing e.g. from Precepts (moving farther afield...), itself also composed music (with much performer freedom...) highlighting strings, or say Compassion & Evidence, a more improvisational & electronic exploration that nonetheless brings some similar long-form textural combos... — but then also a strong, even Scelsian sense of energy modulation (particularly evocative around bassoon...), i.e. of real instability & emergence.... And that's the theme then, technologies that women have developed over the centuries in order to overcome restrictions forced upon them.... (So I also need to state a decolonial perspective: It was modern imperialism that established patriarchy as the global norm. Indeed e.g. Brazilian theorist Boaventura de Sousa Santos posits that capturing the output of women's labor was effectively the main goal of modern imperialism, such that these days I sarcastically remark that the major marketing slogan for the West has become \"The best patriarchy for women!\" Any implication of \"progress\" in general thus worries me....) So there is indeed an exploration of new worlds here, but still with a sense of building to climaxes & release. And obviously a basic musical arc of this sort can't help but suggest sexual release per se (as it long has...), even as the result is sometimes more of a falling apart or a coming unwound.... (Note e.g. that the new Polwechsel vinyl survey, Embrace, specifically eschews a climax-release dynamic, including per its included discussion.... So that long-running, compositional-improvisation group marks a sort of polar opposite.) Clamor thus continues to suggest various senses of building — along with its senses of change (& even of decay).\n\n30 October 2023\n\nOf course musicians playing bowed strings are regular contributors to many improvisation outings these days, especially prolifically in Portugal around Ernesto Rodrigues — branching out there variously as well, with e.g. bassist João Madeira (& I've yet to see a real bio...) suddenly becoming one of Rodrigues' most frequent & dynamic colleagues over the past couple of years (including e.g. for their most recent album together, Dripping with Dirk Serries & José Oliveira, apparently inspired by the physical process itself, i.e. not unusually for projects involving Madeira...). Madeira has created a label (4DaRecord, with physical CDs) as well, and he's already released some intriguing material there, including from younger musicians (& not always including himself). But here I want to feature the soon-to-be-released trio album Open in Finder — with flautist Carlos Bechegas (b.1957) & cellist Ulrich Mitzlaff. So as it happened, the latter had only just appeared in this space with ZARM (i.e. another Portuguese string ensemble, arising from the pre-Rodrigues generation with Carlos Zingaro...) & Duot with Strings in a review last month.... But \"Bechegas\" (his name quoted in the credits here, not unlike \"Zingaro\" at times, although I don't know the rest...) was basically new to me, despite that he's apparently been around the improvisation scene for decades, his first prominent album being Open Secrets with Peter Kowald (while mostly releasing duos with bassists from that era...). There's a lengthy intervening interval with no releases, however, interrupted first (& only this year) by another trio album with strings, Secrets under Trees with both Rodrigueses — recorded in Germany in June 2023, but released last month prior to Open in Finder, itself recorded the month prior in Lisbon, both live... — featuring naturalistic concerns & inspirations around flute & strings textures, a counterpoint of overlapping lines & ongoing continuities, pushing forward virtuosically into exotic spectra & especially around outdoorsy evocations. (And I should note that the first \"Carlos Bechegas Trio\" release from Leo Labs in 1997 was with both Rodrigues & Oliveira! Bechegas employed electronics there as well, as opposed to these later acoustic albums....) There's also a wonderful ability not only to propel forward, but to slow time as well displayed on Secrets under Trees, an album title that also differs from most others from Bechegas in not beginning with \"Open...\" (& yet nonetheless returns to Open Secrets as touchstone...). So Open in Finder displays those qualities as well, with the strings shifted a range lower, and worked into more of a four-movement quasi-symphonic form, i.e. offering more (in number) expressive arcs than provided by the long-short (\"tone poem\") format of Secrets under Trees.... And a general sense of openness does seem to underlie Open in Finder too, from its mysteriously evolving start coming to include various string harmonics (sounding almost electronic at times...), and through a series of solo expressions that seem then to be extended by others, again often in overlapping lines, sometimes thinning textures, but also into a more bustling polyphony (or even e.g. quasi-unison glissandi...) at times. The virtuosic solo emphasis can sometimes recall Robert Dick too & e.g. his tour-de-force trio album Solar Wind, especially early in both interactions, there using a \"variant\" string instrument, while flute expression per se here might be compared also to Camilo Ángeles (e.g. in trio on Aqrabuamelu per a November 2022 review, or in duo with cello — an instrument central to both recent Bechegas albums — on El Espesor del Sueño, as noted subsequently here in a review of Vol. II this past April...). And although there're other examples, including from composed music, this combination still seems underexplored to me.... An emphasis on continuity-through-change remains tangible for Open in Finder as well then, including through a subtly rich & evolving pointillism that comes to animate (& involute) the long second movement, there indeed yielding a pastoral vibe, but with urban invocations elsewhere, including through & into nocturnal scenes (among a series of extended & adventurous textures...), naturalistic at times (once again...), but coming to suggest a more human-centered dynamic & perspective overall. Echoes of dance consequently arise & evolve too (perhaps figuring human animation per se...). The result is then multi-faceted, a social statement, and apparently a return to music production for Bechegas, seeming to end in a question....\n\n8 November 2023\n\nReturning next to a classic format, Puna — recorded in a Berlin studio in January 2021 — is actually the first release from a \"guitar trio\" consisting of Olaf Rupp, Meinrad Kneer & Rudi Fischerlehner. And guitarist Rupp has been something of a fixture here, most recently with the quasi-shamanic Myotis Myotis duo (reviewed November 2022), but e.g. regularly with Ernesto Rodrigues (e.g. around RRR, as first discussed in August 2018...), and back all the way to an entry from late 2011.... The other two are hardly unknowns, Fischerlehner most recently appearing here with the (also relatively traditional) trombone trio Der Dritte Stand (reviewed July 2022), and Kneer e.g. playing a \"connecting\" role on longtime favorite Colophony (from 2013).... Of course, Rupp & Fischerlehner have a long-running duo, Xenofox (whose most recent album The Garden Was Empty was recorded in May 2022, but released already in February this year... indeed showing the aftereffects of Puna), but that connection was strangely omitted from the release notes from Vienna's Klanggalerie. The latter also seems to be one of the few labels prominent in this space to mostly be eschewing download or streaming releases (per e.g. Skein's Spectra & Affrays, as noted here in a January 2023 review — or apparently Density Dots from a new Dirk Serries quintet, about to appear...), but then not for Puna — for unknown reasons! Beyond this point of confusion though, Klanggalerie seems to be undertaking more releases in this particular arena (amid their large catalog...), albeit generally in more \"classic\" guises than some other freely adventurous labels.... And Puna does have something of a classic quality, given its instrumentation, as well as what seems to be a desire from the trio to make a \"statement\" release — again (per the previous entry) suggesting something of symphonic form, with more gestural-procedural (& rock-ish) inner movements, but more varied (& pointillistic) textures in the more extended & balanced outer movements.... Per Xenofox then, which can almost be succinct via their long experience together, there're echoes of rock music to be found here, especially explicitly to open the third track, but often more subsumed (if already irrupting by the end of the long first track...), particularly within those outer movements, where clattering metallic percussion often pairs with throbbing pizzicato bass — & pace recent entries featuring improvising strings, it's more often a \"jazz bass\" from Kneer here — guitar often being in (ringing) plucking-percussive mode itself.... (A variety of bent tones is employed across the ensemble, plus e.g. hand drums & a big bass drum from early on....) Given Rupp's methods around figural clusters in spectral-harmonic motion & Fischerlehner's often rock-infused drumming then, there's also considerable energy coursing through Puna, yielding quite fast (& detailed) passagework at times, such that my main comparison has to be with the massive Ewen / Smith / Walter (II)... both albums suggesting more than a hint of punk, as well as involving long-term collaborations. (Or maybe I should note Minus X, the Xenakis double tribute album from guitarists Sharp & Kaiser, reviewed here in June: There's certainly no shortage of activity there either!) So there's a tremendous degree of simultaneous motion across the four movements of Puna, although varying in its orientations & intensities (including via a more mellow, yet echoing, vibe at times...), thus forging a sort of thorny musical jungle (of various allusions)... as a broad working-through of (quasi-jazz? & beyond...) guitar trio textures.\n\n10 November 2023\n\nAlthough it seems as though I only just reviewed vibraphonist Sergio Armaroli's Windows & Mirrors | Milano Dialogues (last December...), it also seems that there's more to say: I recently cited his basic sound world again in a review of Harri Sjöström's Due Mutabili (in September), and then finally took note of the \"About Cage\" series he curates for Da Vinci Classics (consequently updating my Number Pieces discussion last week...). And then Armaroli & colleagues continued to release albums from the same Windows & Mirrors sessions from April 2022: First there was More Windows & Small Mirrors | Milano Dialogues, part two (released this past February), involving the same quartet with Giancarlo Schiaffini & Veli Kujala, but more often in reduced formations (i.e. almost as an appendix to the prior quartet-focused album...). Now there's the generically named More Duos And Trios, released last month also on Leo Records, and recently appearing on streaming outlets: The title obviously references one of the earlier Armaroli recordings for Leo, Duos & Trios (released in 2020, as noted in my December 2022 review...), and does involve again that prior trio (i.e. without Kujala on accordion). And although the title sounds almost like an afterthought, More Duos And Trios ends up being the tightest release yet from this project! Whereas the first Duos & Trios seemed to be largely about integrating Sjöström into Armaroli's musical world (i.e. alongside Schiaffini, who appears e.g. on the Cage series, as well as with Armaroli for some of the releases in another extensive series, that one \"jazzier\" on the Italian Dodicilune label...), Windows & Mirrors | Milano Dialogues had then involved integrating Kujala, and ends up involving some relatively empty landscapes, spacious & hovering at times, also exploratory.... (Schiaffini on trombone had appeared as well on the other Armaroli quartet album that I reviewed in the interim, I Dream I Was An Earopean, recorded later in April 2022 with vocalist Phil Minton....) But More Duos And Trios is a second outing for the core trio, and usually ends up in strongly three-way interactions, i.e. exploring its basic reed & brass & vibes setup via increasingly sophisticated ensemble articulations.... Indeed it comes to recall In Search of Surprise (reviewed here in November 2021) from Udo Schindler & Etienne Rolin on horns, there contextualized by \"adding\" vibes at times (pace their duo followup, Plastic Narratives as mentioned in another February review...), generally punchier & more angular as well — as one of many prescient textural studies from Schindler. More Duos And Trios also continues to imply a sense of being \"studies\" then, i.e. with no real theme otherwise, various restarts for the tracks, simply coming to an end in time... but there're plenty of other recent explorations of this general sound world, lending a sense of centrality to Armaroli's work: When discussing both Windows & Mirrors & In Search of Surprise I'd noted the textural-structural similarities to Anthony Braxton's DCWM, i.e. two \"horns\" with worlds split-articulated across shimmering electronics — now for others, substituting shimmering vibes (possibly along with accordion, subsequently embraced by Braxton as well for ZIM...), with the basic resulting textures being increasingly interrogated across various musical contexts. Indeed, not only has Evan Parker been exploring similar combos (including with Armaroli himself, as previously noted...), but e.g. Steve Lehman & Ivo Perelman just released large ensemble albums augmenting a similar basic trio with vibraphone (although with trumpet, i.e. brass in higher register), respectively Ex Machina (with \"orchestra,\" including electronics...) & Seven Skies Orchestra (with string trio). Perelman enjoyed the combo so much that he subsequently recorded the focused duo Tuning Forks with Matt Moran (as released in September), seemingly turning more toward spectral approaches around ringing metal.... But one thing those efforts do have in common, including from Braxton (who offers some different configurations as well...), is that they're driven by a reed player (including sometimes Sjöström...). With Armaroli though, it's more as if the \"computer\" (or continuo...) background is leading, so there's a different sense of structure, of articulating extended (temporal) tapestries.... (And these are also very long albums, most well over an hour, meaning that there's no shortage of ideas either.) More Duos And Trios is also, perhaps, the final release for Leo Records, an institution in this space. (It comes alongside the appealing Density For Solo Vibraphone(s), much less discrete in its rhythmic-dynamic articulations, making a round number of 10 releases for Leo by Armaroli....) And I'd already mentioned in the first Armaroli review how changes to commercial regulations left Leo unable to ship product to the US, and I guess he doesn't want to shift to more of an online context now, although as noted, his recent albums do appear at least on Qobuz.... That's unfortunate, but new music does continue.... And indeed Armaroli becomes one of the most prolific builders of what seems to be an important (technical, acoustic) sound world for the 2020s — so when does this \"study\" work yield more of an artistic statement per se? Armaroli's solo work may already be there, but that's not really my focus....\n\n13 November 2023\n\nContinuing a sort of textural nexus explored in this space of late, as well as reprising an ensemble from an already noted album, in this case moving to the more singular title Archangel — itself recorded in September 2022 — from the more generic (but detailed...) Music for Two Organs & Two Bass Clarinets (as reviewed here in May 2018), Thanos Chrysakis returns alongside historical organist Peer Schlechta & their respective colleagues on low-range clarinets, Chris Cundy & Ove Volquartz. This is the first post-pandemic, improvised album from Chrysakis (here credited on chamber organ & voice — the latter subtly on only one track...) & his Aural Terrains label then, e.g. after most recently Five Shards (recorded in 2019 & reviewed here in August 2021, as a \"garden of horns cultivated by Chrysakis,\" i.e. with more timbral variety — & likewise more dynamic instability — than his usual deep reed focus lately...), but also after Music for Baritone Saxophone, Bass Clarinets & Electronics (also recorded in 2017, i.e. not long after Music for Two Organs & Two Bass Clarinets...). And while Archangel shows considerable development from the quartet's first album, becoming both more intricate & more immersive, it does retain a jazzier quality at times, particularly from the reeds, which are after all played by different musicians from those on Music for Baritone... — the latter with its close (textural) emphasis on reed grains, yielding a sort of overall (non-jazzy) smoothness.... It also turns out that Schlechta & Volquartz had only recently released another quartet album together, Cadenza del Crepusculo (recorded in November 2021, so prior to Archangel...) with John Hughes (bass — & actually a bassist on the enigmatic Pail Bug, discussed here at length in March 2012...) & Gianni Mimmo (soprano sax). Of course, the latter had only just appeared in this space with Due Mutabili (reviewed back in September), also released on his Amirani Records. One of the more striking aspects of Archangel, relative to the quartet's first album, is then its pairing of high pitches with the big organ bass (forging an immersive atmosphere overall, against which the clarinets exchange calls & sometimes jazzy lines between...), but Cadenza del Crepusculo (like the earlier quartet with Schlechta...) emphasizes more of the bass in general, i.e. from the pedals up, a growling flow, often seeming low & anticipatory.... I also saw the result described as \"medieval\" elsewhere, so need to add that Schlechta's specialty is early Baroque organs, i.e. historically tuned in versions of mean-tone yielding to well-temperaments, so very different from Pythagorean tuning with its ringing perfect fifths. (Mean-tone is almost exactly the opposite, whereas 12tet is very close to 3:2 fifths again....) And I can't really pick out the precise tuning on Archangel, but there appears to be a historical temperament at work, which actually contributes to the feeling of \"immersion\" involved (as buoyed by the chamber organ, presumably a synthesizer with variable tunings, \"framing\" the acoustic space with high pitches...). So besides the more idiomatic expression from the reed players, that's a key difference from Music for Baritone..., the latter invoking (relatively speaking) a sort of smoothness that relies (apparently) on 12tet. (Among favorites here, Sitsa may be the most similar in terms of combining organ to frame space, there with an eerie sheering quality, plenty of suspension, but also yielding a \"smooth\" feel overall....) So that aspect suggests a comparison with Werckmeister Musik (recorded in 2019) & its specific Baroque tuning (& synth sometimes sounding like organ...), there also yielding an immersive sense of flowing waves.... (The \"bent\" feel of the unequal temperament thus suggests a kind of envelopment — i.e. forges a territory via its internal contradiction.) Like Sitsa though, Werckmeister Musik suggests a rather more \"industrial\" context, i.e. versus the clear (evocation of a) church organ on Archangel. The latter aspect can be found interrogated by e.g. Tuning Out as well, but with the historical tuning further problematized (i.e. used differently from intended...) & rendered more often into pointillistic interactions. So that differs from the typically flowing (albeit with some clashes & stoppages...) & immersive quality of Archangel, itself seeming to take up various textural currents, especially (if indirectly...) from Anthony Braxton & DCWM, specifically here with the organ pair (versus e.g. vibraphone, or vibraphone plus accordion, pace the previous entry...) forging a similar sort of shimmering-glittering background tapestry, sometimes with clarinets blending more into the texture then, but more often in relief or recitative, i.e. projecting a sort of rhetorical-jazzy horn interaction as framed by various held tones, low & high. And Braxton does project a jazziness from his horns often enough as well, so that aspect is similar — even as I prefer the more \"integrated\" passages on Archangel: The big opening organ entry is dramatic, soon into senses of falling (as tuning is subtly implicated...), clarinets cautious at first, eventually coming more to the fore.... (And for the final track, Cundy turns to ocarina instead, adding another interrogation of the highs, yielding some differing textures, provocative again, but still relatively preliminary....) There's thus almost a sense that church music is yielding to jazz. (And of course this sort of fusion was already accomplished differently in the 20th century via gospel, i.e. with the organ-guitar trio....) But Archangel is also long (more than an hour... & available as well from Cundy's Bandcamp), and while it's certainly more sophisticated than the interaction on Music for Two Organs & Two Bass Clarinets (from five & a half years prior... itself still with e.g. \"jazzy chords\" from chamber organ...), there're still plenty of passages that seem to be routine continuations or more tentative ongoing explorations.... So will the quartet be ready for more in another five years? Or maybe this basic combination will be coming back sooner? There's enough to Archangel that one can really hear the potential (particularly given e.g. the spatial possibilities raised).\n\n21 November 2023\n\nMoving in a different & more traditional horn & drums direction, albeit less traditional with flute (again), while also reprising an earlier formation, The House On The Hill (recorded only this past June & recently released by Shrike Records) is at least the third album from a trio of Adrian Northover (soprano sax), Marcello Magliocchi (drums & percussion) & Bruno Gussoni (flutes): I'd included their first (to my knowledge...), The Sea Of Frogs (recorded in 2019 & released by Plus Timbre) in a double review around Northover, together with Xoo (with guitarist Daniel Thompson, an album around which I'd eventually start to foreground critical language around zoomimesis...), and it maintains more the dynamic of a horn & drums duo (also with some actual duo tracks...), doubled up sometimes. That's not so unlike the way that Runcible Quintet started off functioning as a double trio around Magliocchi — with Runcible (also with Northover) as an obvious reference point, their most recent album Three (recorded in 2019) having been reviewed here in May 2020.... That's with flautist Neil Metcalfe (whose participation on the recently released, but also recorded in 2019, Hunt at the Brook Again & with Neil Metcalfe not only reconnects him with Thompson, but embraces a similar sort of pointillism as opens The House On The Hill....), with the developing trio texture of Gussoni (b.1951) instead joining Northover & Magliocchi suggesting developments from Runcible nonetheless: Textures are more pared down here, i.e. without strings, so more airy, particularly for the trio's second album A Castle of Ghosts (recorded & released in 2022, also on Plus Timbre), there moving already into the world of post-pandemic recordings via a relatively open & atmospheric format... slowly building, but also de-tensioning at times. And then The House On The Hill opens with more incisive rhythmic emphasis, quickly pointillistic, seemingly more ambitious (than e.g. the solo \"world music\" flute opening A Castle of Ghosts...), but also moving more into flowing lines & (still airy) vertical textures at times, a sense of haunting indeed continuing to suggest itself.... And Gussoni is increasingly integrated into the proceedings by this point, yielding a distinctive (but subtle...) collective trio sound that nonetheless proceeds into areas of more extended techniques for some tracks, still retaining a sense of overall coherence across the variously evocative titles. (Of course flute has been a specific attraction here, so The House On The Hill suggests a comparison with the recent Open in Finder from Carlos Bechegas et al., as reviewed earlier this month — there with strings, and so embracing a completely different technology from this more \"primitivist\" trio recording in Italy....) So there's a sense of physical acoustics increasingly coming to the fore here, less zoomimesis or animalistic (or humanistic...) aspects of \"anthropology music\" per se, but more a sense of space or structure, e.g. a corrugated metal shanty rattling in the wind... a sort of detailed & impressionistic mix of shading & varying dynamism, closely attended. And Gussoni has been active since the 1960s (including e.g. with Peter Kowald, per his resume, pace the recent Bechegas discussion...), but this seems to be his most prominent release so far this millennium: The House On The Hill ends up evoking (non-idiomatic) \"world music\" then, and in a rather gritty & (e.g. physically) material way. The trio thus further develops a style projecting the beauty of everyday (& mostly outdoor) sounds.\n\n22 November 2023\n\nAnimals & Giraffes @ Medicine for Nightmares is then also the third album from the (extended) duo, released this week on Phillip Greenlief's Evander Music (& Bandcamp). And as opposed to the obvious comparison here, 13 Asperities from Gabriele Guenther & Trokaan Project (released in 2020), which involved mostly an established group of instrumentalists who also set a general tone (as well as continuity...) from the start, Animals & Giraffes continues to be very centered on poet & speaker Claudia La Rocco. This remains just as true of @ Medicine for Nightmares — recorded in San Francisco in September 2022 — even though a variety of other performers is involved, including others on backing vocals (& e.g. electronics). The latter aren't really textual though, per La Rocco's matter-of-fact quick turn of phrase style, but rather join the instrumentalists (including oboe & bass) in coloring the various intervening passages, almost as a series of little vignettes. Hence the long-range \"continuity\" is left to La Rocco, whose musical unmusicality (or at least unpitched-ness) is felt in cyclic returns of various textual snippets, forging a surreal atmosphere of overlapping déjà vu over two masterfully woven (mostly separate) sets. The result is highly potent, even dizzying, despite the superficial blandness — even if the musical parts wouldn't really make for an album by themselves (although they feature some quite extended textures in some moments... without development). Despite the varying instrumental or vocal forces at various points then (with Greenlief as ongoing partner...), @ Medicine for Nightmares is also La Rocco's most traditional album in terms of presentation: The first from Animals & Giraffes, July (released in 2017 on Edgetone Records) prominently included her conducting an interview, while the second, Landlocked Beach (reviewed here in April 2018) included live radio callers (to whom she responds capriciously): That bizarre album, released by Creative Sources, is also rather long (& edited from a much longer radio program...), including Jon Leidecker (on electronics) as third member. I thought at the time that some of the looping might have been from electronics, but it certainly seems at this point to be from La Rocco herself (& July had already involved a variety of instrumentalists for the different tracks as well). Per Greenlief then (who describes himself as working on the post-jazz continuum, a description I enjoy... & who likely has plenty to do with the time concepts here as well), @ Medicine for Nightmares — & I'd suggest hearing the two sets one at a time — involves \"other worldly electro-acoustic textures and a theater of voices,\" and a good deal of that is transformational or liminal material around La Rocco, adding to the spinning senses of intersecting time. (The additional performers include Kyle Bruckmann, who's appeared in this space already — along with newcomers Alexandra Buschman Roman & Adriana Camacho Torres.) So these recitals do continue to feel affectively transformative to me, but not in a straightforward direction: La Rocco seems to capture (with deceptive flatness — or actuality, that is...) some sort of tangible post-post- (transverse, becoming minor...) vibe that's amplified along the way via held tones & little splashes of color from her musician colleagues.\n\n24 November 2023\n\nJack Wright (b.1942) has been one of the seminal free improvisors in the US, particularly as a sax player. And in recent years, while he's still touring live, Wright has mainly (or even exclusively?) been performing & recording with a relatively small group of younger initiates. Both continued with his latest trio album Yaw, recorded in Mississippi during a July 2022 tour by his trio Wrest, featuring Evan Lipson & Ben Bennett. Based upon many hours of musical explorations together then, Wrest develops a unique & personal collective style, building considerably since their previous album Ingress (collected from three different tour dates in 2014...). Wrest is also a \"classic sax trio\" by configuration, so confronts a considerable tradition with novel textures & dynamic means for interacting. But as far as context, there're actually three musicians circling Wright these days (with guitarist Zach Darrup), so there're actually three different corresponding trios (all named!): Never, with Bennett & Darrup released Never (as reviewed here that September) in 2019, also on Bennett's Palliative Records, and then Not Nothing (also recorded in 2019, live in Chicago), there with some twang from the electric guitar (versus the acoustic trio Wrest). And Roughhousing, with Darrup & Lipson, released a trio (recorded live in Tennessee) on You Haven't Heard This (reviewed here in March 2017), itself arriving alongside Wright's book The Free Musics. Finally, there's a fourth trio minus Wright himself, Virtual Balboa, which released Petrichor (as a quartet, adding trumpet, as reviewed here in November 2021) on Creative Sources. There're also various duos, an especially notable recent example in this context being Augur from Wright & Bennett (made in studio a month after Yaw, August 2022), a lengthy & relatively stark album, very closely recorded.... (Percussionist Bennett is surely the most visible member of this cohort otherwise.) However, Wright has yet to record with the full quartet — pace e.g. The Unrepeatable Quartet (released back in 2013, from a different group). But he does have a new solo album, What is What on Relative Pitch, recorded in March 2023 — also apparently originally set to include material from July 2022 as well. (Wright's solo style is highly conversational, i.e. as if he's talking to himself, complete with alternations etc....) And bassist Lipson has probably been the least visible of these performers since You Haven't Heard This, but did release a \"statement\" solo album earlier this year too, Echo Chamber on Public Eyesore, exploring a dark acoustic space.... A sense of \"acoustics\" does shine through on Yaw then, as well as various percussive qualities arising from all three musicians (as Lipson had demonstrated extensively in solo as well...), combined with various extended howls & calls — a broad zoomimesis invoking amphibians & insects too... — so as to produce an active (& highly biological, but also e.g. with a train...) sense of outdoor landscape. Wright has long opined that the Southeast is \"the best\" part of the US for free improvisation (i.e. for audiences being open to the musical unknown...), and he captures here a considerable swath of its \"natural\" (sometimes eerie...) sounds. As the comment might suggest as well, his music sounds relatively unlike e.g. English efforts (including those that might otherwise be described similarly...) & indeed the \"urban elite\" musics in general. There's always a sense of pushing or stretching in all directions, a thirst for new (collective) sounds & how to articulate them together in a new way, but also a sort of swampy earthiness. (The living landscape starts to converse with itself: This seems very North American to me, in part contrasting with the fire & sky of jazz....) And Lipson's emergence contributes considerably to the overall impression here, particularly in tackling the \"sax trio\" format per se: I do take the \"classic\" combos seriously, i.e. the history that they have, and so this release brings a little extra gravity (pace Wright trio releases in general, which are always an event...), even as the result isn't bound by traditional idiom. So for further context, I last reviewed two sax trio albums in July, Nail in Ulrichsberg (with Michel Doneda) & Here and How (with John Butcher), and then if one can accept cello (for bass), since flipping this page, there's been Flight Rvw2349 (with Georg Wissel).... And as with most Wright releases, one of course wonders what one isn't hearing, Yaw having been selected for release from a concert tour: After various intense sequences, it also ends quietly, i.e. suggesting a lingering buzz of insects, such that I usually find myself wishing there was more....\n\n6 December 2023\n\nTurning to another horn trio, this time (again) around clarinet: Guillermo Gregorio (b.1941, originally from Argentina) has been active for decades too, including various earlier releases with which I have only limited familiarity. And although it wasn't his first mention here, Gregorio was actually featured in Jeff Shurdut's Kitchen Music Live Off-Broadway (that I helped produce, and then discussed extensively here in August 2015...), prompted in part by his past interactions with Fluxus: Jeff hasn't been putting music before the public lately, but that relation does continue to evoke the visual arts, around which Clifford Allen also orients his liner note comments for The Cold Arrow, Gregorio's latest album — recorded in the St. Louis area in September 2022, with Damon Smith & Jerome Bryerton (as released on Smith's Balance Point Acoustics). Allen specifically cites constructivism, and as a one-time mathematician, I might suggest the field of projective geometry, \"planar effect\" being an operative notion here, per track titles. And The Cold Arrow is not the first (recent) release by this trio either, with Room of the Present having appeared on Sluchaj in 2021, although recorded back in Chicago in 2007 & 2008.... Both programs are based around Gregorio compositions, but most of the music is improvised, and for that earlier album, Bryerton (whom I hadn't mentioned here, but who's appeared multiple times alongside Smith, himself of course increasingly a pillar of US improv...) includes some big drums, whereas the credits for The Cold Arrow state clearly that no drums were used — it's all metal, gongs & cymbals, etc. So the style becomes more austere. And that austerity is often articulated more in shifting resonances & slower textures (after e.g. a shrill & aggressive opening... as if already in the middle of something), not really in varieties of pointillism, e.g. per Smith's \"other\" clarinet trio (with Jason Stein), as cited here in a review (from February 2022) of their Volumes & Surfaces. (In fact, that was my previous discussion of clarinet trios in general, a format for which Smith is suddenly at the center here... that same later trio having also just released Hum, a live followup recorded in 2022.) The trio's dynamism & level of intensity seems to shift often & seamlessly then... indeed with a sense that some \"larger\" structure is being projected onto the linear-temporal space. This sort of \"surfaces\" (pace Smith's other trio...) approach would seem to be typical of Gregorio then, who also just happened to release Two Trios on ESP-Disk' as well — both pre-pandemic performances, the first with his long-running Chicago trio (with cello & vibraphone), mostly from before my time here... but also anticipating some horn & vibes (& related) interactions that I've been discussing in this space lately. And although there're some pricklier passages coming & going on both albums, there's also a sense of linear (yet angular) melody usually maintained by Gregorio (pace e.g. tuneful reedists such as Schindler & Perelman...). The result can be mysteriously affective, generally in bold strokes suddenly at different angles (mostly calm... often rhetorically flat), various blocks of (ritualistic) stasis suddenly yielding to something more animated & forward moving again... which somehow progresses to a new stasis. Much of this continues to suggest late 20th century high modernism to me, with the style becoming more starkly contoured & refined (but not minimalistic).\n\n8 December 2023\n\nBack in December 2017, I reviewed The Core-Tet Project featuring classical percussionist Evelyn Glennie as part of an improvising quartet: The project intrigued me not only because of Glennie herself — someone with a personal approach to hearing, and someone with a huge reputation as a percussion soloist in classical circles... — but also because it was released on a big classical label (Naxos), along with notes seeking to position it within contemporary classical developments. It doesn't seem the album made much of a splash in the classical community, where contemporary music of any sort remains an uphill battle..., but Glennie has now returned with another album alongside violist Szilárd Mezei — already part of the quartet on The Core-Tet Project — & his Polar Quartet (a more jazz-inspired group...): Capt's Look was recorded in Serbia in October 2022 (& just released on Warsaw's Sluchaj), and whereas The Core-Tet Project begins with the novel & aggressive texture of classical guitar & piano alongside pizzicato viola & percussion (eventually moving more into e.g. quasi-romantic viola & piano sonata textures...), Mezei's Polar Quartet includes another percussionist (Ivan Burka, mainly on vibes?), plus reed (Bogdan Rankovic, mostly on clarinet) & double bass (Ervin Malina). The result, at least from my perspective, is then a mo"
