        "text": "Various Artists \"1st COMPASSO: SAMBA & CHORO\" (Biscoito Fino, 2000)\n\nVarious Artists \"2nd COMPASSO: SAMBA & CHORO\" (Biscoito Fino, 2000)\n\nVarious Artists \"3rd COMPASSO: SAMBA & CHORO\" (Biscoito Fino, 2001)\n\nVarious Artists \"4th COMPASSO: SAMBA & CHORO\" (Biscoito Fino, 2001)\n\nVarious Artists \"5th COMPASSO: SAMBA & CHORO\" (Biscoito Fino, 2001)\n\nVarious Artists \"6th COMPASSO: SAMBA & CHORO\" (Biscoito Fino, 2001)\n\nVarious Artists \"7th COMPASSO: SAMBA & CHORO\" (Biscoito Fino, 2001)\n\nAn excellent series of live peformances of old-fashioned samba and choro, with a slew of talented traditionalists and jazz-oriented MPB artists. As the series picks up steam, the musicians become higher-profile, better known artists. The stars include Elton Medeiros, Guinga, Muicha, Francis and Olivia Hime, and Joyce. Far more numerous are the more obscure artists, such as Trio Madeira Brasil, Quarteto Maogani, Luciana Rabello, and others whose fortes lie with the older acoustic styles. A lilt of samba, a whiff of jazz, and a classical touch all combine in these fine performances staged in the Paco Imperial do Rio De Janeiro. Recommended!\n\nVarious Artists \"AFRO-BRAZILIAN RELIGIOUS SONGS: CANTIGAS DE CANDOMBLE\" (Lyricord Records, 1977)\n\n(Produced by Gerard Behague)\n\nReal-deal Bahian Orixa music recorded in 1967-75 by University of Texas scholar Gerard Henri Behague, one of the leading scholars of Afro-Brazilian religious music. This features plenty of heavy-duty African-based drumming, with keening choruses backing a lead vocal, all in praise of various deities such as Ogun, Oxala and Exu... If you want to look into candomble music, this is an excellent place to start.\n\nVarious Artists \"AGO PIXINGUINHA: 100 ANOS\" (Som Livre, 1997)\n\nThis is a very nice, very classy, very well-programmed and listenable tribute to choro pioneer Pixinguinha. This impressive 2-CD that gathers together classic performances of MPB stars such as Maria Bethania, Joao Bosco, Chico Buarque, Nana Caymmi, Paulinho Da Viola, Tom Jobim, Simone, Caetano Veloso and others, assembled by producer Herminio Bello De Carvalho, who worked with Pixinguinha in his twilight years, and who remembers him fondly in an essay included in a thick set of liner notes. There's also a long interview with Pixinguinha, and nice archival photos, as well as vintage choro recordings by Jacob Do Bandolim and Pixinguinha himself. A great introduction to his work, with plenty of information and memorabilia to back up the sweet-sounding music. Recommended!\n\nVarious Artists \"A ONDA QUE SE ERGUEU NO MAR\" (Universal Records, 2002)\n\nAn insider's view of bossa nova. Ruy Castro, who compiled this 2-CD collection wrote the book on bossa nova -- literally -- and assembled this set as a companion piece to his fine history of the style, Bossa Nova: The Story Of The Brazilian Music That Seduced The World, and to the as-yet untranslated sequel, A Onda Que Se Ergueu No Mar. Some of these selections seem a bit staid and don't do much for me, but then again, who am I to argue with an expert? Mostly this is a great sampler, and includes many songs and artists who are well off the radar, many of which are real gems and rare finds. Highly recommended.\n\nVarious Artists \"AS CLASSIFICADAS E VENCEDORAS DA 1a BIENAL DO SAMBA\" (RCA Camden, 1968)\n\nA souvenir of a 1967 song contest, the Festival Musical Popular Brasileira, sponsored by TV Record. The finalists featured performances by Wilson Miranda, Os Originais Do Samba, Cyro Monteiro, Os Caculas and the Samba 4, singing two songs by Herminio Belo da Carvalho. The more obscure participants included singers such as Aizita, Rosely and Zenaide, as well as a group called AZ3, with Os Acdemicos Da Pauliceia.\n\n- # >\n\nVarious Artists \"AXE BAHIA '96\" (PolyGram, 1996)\n\nVarious Artists \"AXE BAHIA '97\" (PolyGram, 1997)\n\nVarious Artists \"AXE BAHIA '98\" (PolyGram, 1998)\n\nVarious Artists \"AXE BAHIA '99\" (PolyGram, 1999)\n\nVarious Artists \"AXE BAHIA 2000\" (PolyGram, 2000)\n\nVarious Artists \"AXE BAHIA 2001\" (PolyGram, 2001)\n\nVarious Artists \"AXE BAHIA 2002\" (PolyGram, 2002)\n\nVarious Artists \"AXE BAHIA 2003\" (PolyGram, 2003)\n\nVarious Artists \"AXE BAHIA 2004\" (PolyGram, 2004)\n\nVarious Artists \"AXE BAHIA 2005\" (PolyGram, 2005)\n\nVarious Artists \"AXE BAHIA 2006\" (PolyGram, 2006)\n\nVarious Artists \"AXE BAHIA 2007\" (PolyGram, 2007)\n\nVarious Artists \"AXE BAHIA 2008\" (PolyGram, 2008)\n\nVarious Artists \"AXE BAHIA 2009\" (PolyGram, 2009)\n\nVarious Artists \"AXE BAHIA 2010\" (PolyGram, 2010)\n\nThis series features the big pop hits in contemporary axe music, mainly lightweight, booty-shakin' party tunes, which mix a heavy Caribbean soca influence with the sexy Afro-Brazilian rhythmic style. A good way to sample newer bands such as E O Tchan, Banda Eva, Timbalada and Netinho -- and to catch up on the current dance tunes. I'm not wild about most of this stuff, but chances are if you visit Brazil, this is the music you'll hear surging out of the radios and dance clubs. Many Brazilian readers have written to tell me they loathe this music and are embarrassed by it... Hey, tell me about it: North America came up with Taylor Hicks, Celine Dion and Britney Spears, so I know what you're talking about. Anyway, one glimpse at the artwork will tell you pretty much all you need to know about this series... Presumably the series continued past 2010, but I quit paying attention.\n\nVarious Artists \"AXE MUSIC\" (PolyGram, 1996)\n\nMore Bahian pop -- in one sense this is a sort of nondescript collection, although in a way that's kind of nice, since some of the artists are lesser-known one-hit wonder types...Highlights include a cover of Caetano Veloso's \"Baby,\" by someone called Sarajane, and a samba-reggae medley by Margareth Menezes.\n\nVarious Artists \"BACK TO NEW WAVE, v.1\" (Sony-BMG, 2000)\n\nThis series gathers examples of Brazilian \"new wave\" as well as guitar-oriented \"BRock,\" mainly dating back to the late 1980s. Includes younger rock artists such as Leo Jaime, Inimigos Do Rei, Dr. Silvana and Uns & Outros, as well as old-timers like Baby Consuelo, who came from the '70s tropicalia era, but went \"new wave\" to try and stay relevant.\n\nVarious Artists \"BACK TO NEW WAVE, v.2\" (Sony-BMG, 2000)\n\nA good representation of commercially-oriented, mainstream \"new wave\" pop, Brazilian style. This features several popular bands of the 1980s, including Radio Taxi, Dr. Silvana, RPM and Leo Jaime, as well as a tropicalia-era old-timer, Pepeu Gomes, who was trying to stay relevant by synthing-up his act. It's all very generic, but it does sound like the American and European pop it sought to emulate -- there are the simple, relentless drums, the tinny electric guitars, and the ever-present keyboards and synths. It's moderately interesting, in an intellectual/cultural-observer kind of way, although I personally don't find much here that I'd actually want to listen to, just for fun.\n\nVarious Artists \"BACK TO NEW WAVE, v.3\" (Sony-BMG, 2000)\n\nVarious Artists \"BAIAO DE VIRAMUNDO: TRIBUTE TO LUIZ GONZAGA\" (YBrazil/Stern's, 2000)\n\nA weird, modernized take on the forro tradition, featuring only a few well-known artists (such as Nana Vasconcelos and Nacao Zumbi), along with a slew of Brazil's most creative electronica artists. The typical accordion-and-triangle sound of forro is stripped apart, laid bare and slathered with skittery jungle, ambient dub and techno riffs, rendering it all but unrecognizable... deconstructed, as it were. The results are challenging and delightful. The only one of these artists I've heard of before is Otto -- all these other young'uns are a revelation. Definitely worth your attention!\n\nVarious Artists \"BAILAO DE PEAO\" (PolyGram/CMT, 1996)\n\nVarious Artists \"BAILAO DE PEAO v.2\" (PolyGram/CMT, 1996)\n\nVarious Artists \"BAILAO DE PEAO v.3\" (PolyGram/CMT, 1998)\n\nOutside of some 1940s recordings by the Stetson-ed samba-billy Bob Nelson, these collections were my first exposure to Brazilian \"country music,\" which, as far as I can tell, is a Brazilian outgrowth of the Mexico's poppy, commercial ranchero scene. A couple of Chet Atkins-y chickin' pickin' licks pop up on a tune or two, but on the whole, Gipsy Kings flamenco riffs and Spanish guitars reminiscent of Marty Robbins' \"El Paso\" are more common. I wasn't too thrilled, either as a Brazilian music fan, or as a country music know-it-all. This duets collection features stars of the genre such as Chitaozinho & Xororo, Tonico & Tinoco, and others.\n\nVarious Artists \"OS BAMBAS DO BANDOLIM\" (Kuarup, 1999)\n\nA first-rate collection of Brazilian mandolin playing, featuring choro masters such as Deo Rian, Joel Nascimento and Pedro Amorim. The picking is dazzling and flashy, and while it may all start to sound alike, it's pretty sweet stuff. Recommended!\n\nVarious Artists \"BASEMENTVILLE! v.2: THE SOUND OF JOVEM GUARDA\" (Misty Lane, 2000)\n\nI suppose this set could be considered jovem guarda, but whereas most of the better-known, more mainstream jovem guarda bands had a mostly watered-down, teenybopper pop style, most of the groups on this excellent set of garage rock obscuros really knew how to rock. Glancing at the scans of old album covers and LP labels, it seems that '60s punk bands generally were excluded from the major label rosters -- these releases on Mocambo, Palladium, GMD and Caravelle and others (with a few on CBS, Polydor and Continental) have a wildness that was largely missing in the Brazilian rock scene, at least until Gil and Veloso showed up. This reissue LP is highly recommended, although your best bet for tracking a copy down might be to contact Misty Lane Records directly, in their misty Roman lair.\n\nVarious Artists \"BATUCADA - THE SOUND OF THE FAVELAS\" (Mr. Bongo Records, 1996)\n\nAn killer collection of hardcore batucada-style percussion tracks, featuring masters of the style such as Padre Miguel, Dom Um Romeu and Jadir de Castro. Some shift away from the straight samba-school drumming into jazzier terrain: it's all good. And very, very intense. Highly recommended.\n\nVarious Artists \"BEATLES 'N' CHORO, v.1\" (Deckdisc, 2002)\n\nVarious Artists \"BEATLES 'N' CHORO, v.2\" (Deckdisc, 2003)\n\nVarious Artists \"BEATLES 'N' CHORO, v.3\" (Deckdisc, 2004)\n\nVarious Artists \"BEATLES 'N' CHORO, v.4\" (Deckdisc, 2005)\n\nVarious Artists \"BLACK ORPHEUS\" (Soundtrack) (Fontana, 1959)\n\nThe first major incursion of bossa nova into the minds and hearts of North America and Europe. Actually the album is largely made up of samba de enredo percussive tracks, although Jobim's non-Joao Gilberto bossa and Luiz Bonfa's acoustic guitar work made quite a splash. Internationally, Bonfa's \"Manha de Carnaval\" was an big hit, and although the bossa nova sound is still a little unformed here, it makes for lovely listening. Vinicius DeMoraes' \"A Felicidade,\" a collaboration with Antonio Carlos Jobim, is included, in a disjointed version, where the mellow melody is juxtoposed with the sounds of children at play and ambient sounds of Rio.\n\nVarious Artists \"BLACK RIO -- BRAZIL SOUL POWER: 1971-1980\" (Strut Records, 2002)\n\nCertainly one of the strongest sets of Brazilian funk and soul that has been compiled to date. Like other sets, this has a strong disco tinge, but it is mercifully short on the strained soul ballads by thin-voiced crooners such as Cassiano and Hyldon, opting instead for more rugged material bu the likes of Uniao Black, Copa 7 and Dom Salvador. Also included are big name artists like Banda Black Rio, Jorge Ben and Ben's one-time backup, Trio Mocoto, but also a slew of lesser known gems by Manito, Miguel de Deus, Eklipse Soul and others. This album's biggest coup is the inclusion of Antonio Carlos & Jocafi's surprise sizzler, \"Kabaluere,\" a bass-heavy funk bomb with a strong Isley Brothers feel, recorded in 1971, by this otherwise fairly wimpy songwriting duo. Also has one track by Gerson King Combo, whose music remains mysteriously un-mined by the retro crowd. This is a very strong collection; hopefully strut can come up with a follow-up volume or two of equal calibre. Recommended!\n\nVarious Artists \"BLOCO NA RUA -- A ERA DE OURO CARNAVAL DE SALAO\" (BMG-RCA, 2001)\n\nA great set of vintage, golden-era Carnaval sambas from artists such as Francisco Alves, Linda Batista, Silvio Caldas, Cyro Monteiro, Orlando Silva and other singers who are less well-known, such as Joel E Gaucho and Gilberto Milfort... This is a fine selection of songs from the 1930s, '40s and '50s... A little bit of this antique stuff goes a long way -- after a few of these songs, they'll all start to sound the same -- but it sure is nice! Recommended.\n\nVarious Artists \"BOSSA CUCA NOVA\" (Six Degrees Records, 1999)\n\nI can't say I cared much for this, though I have friends who think it's the bee's knees. Basically, this is a set of gentle bossa nova oldies (the original versions) with loud \"funky drummer\" snare drum tracks crudely laid down on top of them. Since the whole point of bossa nova was its gorgeous subtlety --especially in the rhythm -- these \"remixes\" seem rather self-defeating. To the credit of the producers, several tracks are lesser-known compositions, so they get points for going off the beaten track. Anyway, as I mentioned, I have friends who liked this record, so although I think this is all horribly, horribly wrong, you might disagree, and love it too. (This is also listed as an \"artist\" album, since the group called Bossacucanova laid down the new grooves, though the source material is from older recordings.)\n\nVarious Artists \"BOSSA NOVA\" (Soundtrack) (Verve Records, 2000)\n\nSlight modernizations of familiar themes, along with a classics such as the Getz/Gilberto \"Girl From Ipanema\", and a bit of new incidental music from Eumir Deodato. Nothing earthshaking, but no disservice to the form, either. Features contributions by Claudia Acuna, Djavan, Romero Lubambo, and Carol Rogers.\n\nVarious Artists \"BOSSA NOVA EXCITING JAZZ SAMBA RHYTHMS v.1\" (Rare Groove Records, 2000)\n\nVarious Artists \"BOSSA NOVA EXCITING JAZZ SAMBA RHYTHMS v.2\" (Rare Groove Records, 2000)\n\nVarious Artists \"BOSSA NOVA EXCITING JAZZ SAMBA RHYTHMS v.3\" (Rare Groove Records, 2000)\n\nVarious Artists \"BOSSA NOVA EXCITING JAZZ SAMBA RHYTHMS v.4\" (Rare Groove Records, 2000)\n\nVarious Artists \"BOSSA NOVA EXCITING JAZZ SAMBA RHYTHMS v.5\" (Rare Groove Records, 2000)\n\nAn authoritative series of early '60s bossa-jazz/samba-lounge recordings, ranging from deep material by the original Brazilians to varying degrees of pop kitsch from Brazilians, Europeans and North Americans alike. Personally, I'm not all that big on the whole loungecore/easy listening thing, but I can recognize that this is a pretty dandy package. The sound quality is good and the pacing is nice too. Includes a lot of rarities -- in order to get all of this stuff yourself, you'd have to spend way too much money, and pick up a lot of iffy old albums... and this way is soooooo much nicer, don't you think?\n\nVarious Artists \"BOSSA NOVA: SUA HISTORIA, SUA GENTE\" (Philips Records, 1975)\n\nA CD reissue of a three-LP set from 1975, this one digs pretty deep into bossa's roots... Includes dozens of long-lost artists, such as Mario Reis, Lennie Dale, Billy Blanco and Doris Monteiro who don't make it on many top ten lists anymore. Some of these tracks I don't care for -- the more lightweight stuff by Tamba Trio, for example, but for a taste of artists such as Carlos Lyra or Dick Farney, this is definitely worth it. Also has the superstars, and the super songs. The liner notes are the clincher -- they're rambunctiously affectionate and enthusiastic, random and sloppy. It's like reading a really great DIY zine on Brazilian pop, with little articles on artists, producers, styles, etc. Definitely recommended.\n\nVarious Artists \"BRASIL ANO 2000\" (Forma Records, 1969) (LP)\n\nTropicalia at its wankiest and most zonked out, with swathes of cerebral art-music, tribal/indigenous/world motifs galore, moody post-bossa acoustic tunes and a lot of excessiveness, indulgence and musical slack. Avantnik producer Rogerio Duprat, lyricist Jose Carlos Capinam and celeb provocateurs Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso collaborated on this oddball hodge-podge, with Gal Costa singing on several songs. Apparently this collects music from various films, some abandoned, others completed, stitched together with short snippets of this and that. It's weird, but a little too deliberately weird, and mostly not stuff that will sustain interest after a couple of initial auditions. Still, if you're on a serious tropicalia kick, you'll want to check this one out.\n\nVarious Artists \"BRASIL: A CENTURY OF SONG\" (Box Set) (Blue Jackel Records, 1995)\n\nVarious Artists \"BRASIL v.1: FOLK & TRADITIONAL\" (Blue Jackel Records, 1995)\n\nVarious Artists \"BRASIL v.2: CARNAVAL\" (Blue Jackel Records, 1995)\n\nVarious Artists \"BRASIL v.3: BOSSA NOVA ERA\" (Blue Jackel Records, 1995)\n\nVarious Artists \"BRASIL v.4: MPB\" (Blue Jackel Records, 1995)\n\nThis four CD set is meant to show the full sweep of Brazilian pop from the late 1800s, when samba was created, to the present day. It's available both as a box set, or as individual CDs. The first volume -- \"Folk and Traditional\" is the strongest: it contains a lot of early pop artists, such as Carmen Miranda, and Ary Barroso, as well as contemporary artists with an acoustic bent, such as Geraldo Azevedo and Joao do Vale. But with a lineup like that, why quibble over terminology? Later discs, especially the \"Bossa Nova Era\" and \"MPB\" are a bit thin and lack bite, at least in my humble opinion. One suspects they ran onto problems licensing the best stuff for inclusion in this anthology, which really is a shame. Well worth checking out, though, as it is one of the only collections of its kind available in the U.S.\n\nVarious Artists \"BRASIL 2 MIL: THE SOUL OF BASS-O-NOVA\" (Six Degrees Records, 1999)\n\nA killer collection of Brazil's best new artists. Includes cult favorites such as Lenine and Arnaldo Antunes, as well as better-known musicians such as rocker Chico Science and novo traditionalist, Virginia Rodrigues. The emphasis here is on smooth soul, triphop, and novo bossa nova, and vague hints of the Brazilian electronica scene -- it's interesting that Brazilian pop, which has often stumbled so badly over cheesy overproduction, is now finding such fertile ground in the dreamy, slow, chill-room vibe... Although this album fudges a little to select mellower tracks by occasionally rowdier artists, it's a strong song selection, and flows well as an album. A sweet peek at some of the new stuff which can barely be heard outside of Brazil proper -- highly recommended!\n\nVarious Artists \"BRAZIL '70s v.1: THIRTEEN LATIN-JAZZ AND BOSSA NOVA TRACKS\" (Superclasse Records, 2001)\n\nVarious Artists \"BRAZIL '70s v.2: TWELVE SAMBA-FUNK AND BOSSA NOVA TRACKS\" (Superclasse Records, 2001)\n\nThe Seventies are back with a vengeance on these idiosyncratically-selected, fusion-heavy, occasionally disco-y collections. Actually, on a couple of tracks the first disc dips back into '60s turf, with a nod towards Joao Donato; the second volume gingerly stretches into the early '80s to include some later material by Tim Maia. In between, there's plenty of slick material, including tracks by the likes of Dave Grusin and Sergio Mendes, as well as nuggets such as Gerson King Combo's \"Swing Do Rei\" (still out of print!) and Miriam Makeba (of all people!!) covering Jorge Ben's sly masterpiece, \"Xica Da Silva.\" If you like the SOUL SAMBA '70s collection, or the BOSSA NOVA EXCITING JAZZ series reviewed above, this retro set might also be right up your alley!\n\nVarious Artists \"BRAZILIAN BEATS\" (boxset) (Mr. Bongo Records, 2007)\n\nAn awesome and elegantly packaged collection of the first seven albums in the Brazilian Beats series, along with an additional disc of breakbeats and mixing from one of the deejays in the Mr. Bongo label's orbit. This is the motherlode of the European/UK Brazilian-lounge-club dance scene, with an impressive mix of modern, clubby dance music and various archival entries from a variety of styles, including rediscovered Brazilian funk and soul, sleek MPB pop, dazzling batucada drumming and a smattering of authentic acoustic samba songs and regional music such as forro. The first disc is particularly strong on \"lost gems\" of the booming Braz-jazz scene of the 1960s and '70s, with strong tracks from solid jazz players such as Milton Banana, Sambalanco Trio, Tenorio, Jr. and fusion-jazz cult figures such as Anna Mazzotti. Pianist/bandleader Dom Salvador's \"Barumba\" is a standout track; later on the series unearths wild gems like \"La Lupita\" by Nino Gomez and Joao Donato's unusual \"Cala Boca Menino.\" The series becomes progressively more clubby and electronic, particularly when showcasing the spazzy, hyperactive \"baile funk\" style, which is supposedly really big in Brazil. Along the way, standards and old faves from artists such as Jorge Ben, Joao Bosco, Orlandivo, Elis Regina and Tim Maia rub up against modern artists such as Marcelo D2, Seu Jorge and Ive Mendes, and novelty material such as the Barbatuques band, who use the human body to replicate the sounds and style of electronica and of Brazilian percussion. Although patterns run through the series, each volume has its own character, with the remixes and new stuff peaking on Volume 4, then giving way again to the retro, crate-digging vibe on later volumes. This really is an impressive collection -- even an old coot like myself who isn't that into the rap, techno and retro-fusion-disco tunes can find lots of to appreciate here, and music fans who use compilations as signposts to discover new artists and styles will find this box set a treasure trove that they can mine more deeply for years to come. Highly recommended!\n\nVarious Artists \"BRAZILIAN BEATS\" (Disc 1 of 7) (Mr. Bongo Records, 2007)\n\nVarious Artists \"BRAZILIAN BEATS\" (Disc 2 of 7) (Mr. Bongo Records, 2007)\n\nVarious Artists \"BRAZILIAN BEATS\" (Disc 3 of 7) (Mr. Bongo Records, 2007)\n\nVarious Artists \"BRAZILIAN BEATS\" (Disc 4 of 7) (Mr. Bongo Records, 2007)\n\nVarious Artists \"BRAZILIAN BEATS\" (Disc 5 of 7) (Mr. Bongo Records, 2007)\n\nVarious Artists \"BRAZILIAN BEATS\" (Disc 6 of 7) (Mr. Bongo Records, 2007)\n\nVarious Artists \"BRAZILIAN BEATS BROOKLYN\" (Disc 7 of 7) (Mr. Bongo Records, 2007)\n\nVarious Artists \"BRAZIL CHORO: SAXOPHONE, WHY CRY?\" (EMI Hemisphere, 1999)\n\nA nice solid collection of latter-day choro recordings, including old-timers like Pixinguinha, Radames Gnattali and Waldir Azevedo, as well as younger acolytes like Deo Rian, Severino Araujo and Paulinho Da Viola. This set is mainly from the 1960s and '70s, well after the heyday of the genre -- it's a bit on the flowery side, but still pretty darn good. If you can find it, it's a good introduction to the modern side of the style. Great liner notes, packed with concise, informative biographies of all the artists.\n\nVarious Artists \"BRAZIL CLASSICS 1: TROPICALIA\" (Sire/Fly Records, 1989)\n\nYou couldn't ask for a better sampler of post-bossa nova pop than this. Well, you could, but it'd be darned hard to find. In 1989, ex-Talking Head David Byrne spearheaded the \"Brazil Classics\" compilation series, which later became the foundation of his Luaka Bop label. He did a stupendous job cherry-picking the best of '70s and early '80s MPB, throwing in several super-catchy tunes such as Jorge Ben's \"Umbabarauma\" and Caetano Veloso's \"Ile Ale,\" songs which really stick in your head and win you over. Also included: \"Sonho Meu,\" perhaps the sweetest song recorded by either Gal Costa or Maria Bethania; several songs by Chico Buarque, including a wonderful duet with Milton Nascimento (\"Calice\"), and a couple of interesting tracks by the lesser-known female singer, Nazare Pereira. Admittedly, the second half of this record slides into cheesier terrain, but the slippage is relatively minor. This remains one of the best -- if not the best -- introduction to Brazilian pop available.\n\nLuaka Bop label. Although at the time some Brazilian purists complained that the series concentrated too heavily on well-known and outdated pop from the 1960s and 1970s, Byrne countered that he just wanted to put out records of music that appealed to him personally. More power to him. The BRAZIL CLASSICS discs are still the best introductions to non-bossa nova Brazilian pop you can find anywhere. >\n\nVarious Artists \"BRAZIL CLASSICS 2: O SAMBA -- SAMBA AND PAGODE\" (Luaka Bop Records, 1989)\n\nAs stunning as the first volume -- maybe even moreso. Includes seductive vocals by big-name stars such as Clara Nunes, Beth Carvalho, Martinho da Vila and Almir Guineto, as well as tracks by lesser-known but also excellent artists. Another Byrne-produced album which has perfect pitch. Highly recommended, and sexy as all hell.\n\nVarious Artists \"BRAZIL CLASSICS 3: FORRO, ETC.\" (Luaka Bop Records, 1991)\n\nReally fun, catchy, accordion-based dance music from the Northeastern regions of Brazil. This collection features more pop-oriented material than other forro discs, and in some ways that makes it even better. Minor complaint: the liner notes describing forro are kind of lame. \"A mixture of ska with polka in overdrive?\" Oh, puh-lease!! Ska?!? (The Rough Guide To World Music makes the same error in trying to pitch forro to yankees by using comparisons which they think will sound familiar. They compare forro to Zydeco, another accordion-based genre...) Maybe a more accurate description might be a mix of polka, samba and Columbian cumbia. But why quibble? Regardless, this disc is a really cool collection! Among other things, it's got a classic track by Jackson Do Pandeiro on it. I want more!\n\nVarious Artists \"BRAZIL CLASSICS: BELEZA TROPICAL 2\" (Luaka Bop Records, 1998)\n\nOOOPS. I stand corrected... Well, they've done it again. Although the cheesiness of Brazilian pop has continued unabated since the CLASSICS series started a decade ago, David Byrne has managed to pull several gems out of the murk, once again proving his skill as an anthologist. Along with the inclusion of a deceptively promising Gilberto Gil tune (his output has been terrible for decades), this disc also includes new stars such as Marisa Monte and Daniela Mercury, as well as relative unknowns such as the dreamy Lenine, and the rather Beat Happening-y Arnaldo Antunes. A couple of disastrous tracks (Sergio Mendes) but mostly a nice sampler of 1990s MPB that's worth checking out.\n\nVarious Artists \"BRAZIL CLASSICS AT 20: ANTI-AGING SOLUTIONS REVEALED\" (LP) (Luaka Bop, 2008)\n\nAh, vinyl. (Or, if you prefer, digital downloads...) Here's a vinyl-only (or, if you prefer, digital download...) homage to Luaka Bop's fab, seven-album series of compilation albums devoted to the wonders of Brazilian music. This album distills a baker's dozen of favorite songs from the Brazil Classics discs, stating with Jorge Ben's earthshaking soccer anthem, \"Umbabarauma,\" then easing into great tracks by Chico Buarque, Gal Costa, Martinho Da Vila, Luiz Gonzaga, Marisa Monte and others... The only downside to this bounty of beautiful music is that these really are the creme-de-la-creme of classic Brazilian pop: you'll have to look long and hard to find the other stuff that lives up to this high standard!\n\nVarious Artists \"BRAZILIAN BIG BANDS -- DANCING DAYS: 1904-1954\" (Fremeaux & Associes, 2005)\n\nGafieira music, the lively, big band-influenced dance jazz of the pre-bossa nova nightclubs, is one of Brazil's least well-known styles, eclipsed by the suave glamour of the bossa crowd and the various waves of rock and samba crossovers that followed. Gafieiras were dancehalls, homes to dancers and dance bands, and (in the best Brazilian tradition) many of the best bandleaders, such as Severino Araujo, Radames Gnattali and Zacharias, drew on many sources to craft their music. They played the kinetic frevo and choro styles, incorporated the muscularity and elegance of North American swing, and eventually gave in to the wave of mellower pop instrumentals and vocal music of the so-called \"radio singers\" era. The artists on this sturdy 2-CD set include some of the best musicians of the post-World War Two era, and their complex, lively music helped frame the musical vocabulary of Tom Jobim and other pioneers of the bossa nova style. Also included are earlier examples of large-ensemble recordings, including a protean recording of Ernesto Nazareth's \"Brejeiro,\" recorded in 1904 by the Banda Do Corpo Dos Bombeiros de RJ, and several tracks from the Orquestra Victor Brasileira in the 1930s, when samba hit the mainstream. The first disc is the strongest, the rawest, the most evocative, with rougher sound quality and more aggressive music. Disc Two largely charts the domestication of the music, with mellower, more mannered performances, swank arrangements that were closer to Stan Kenton and Doc Severinsen than to the street sambas of Rio and Bahia. But for students of Brazilian popular culture, particularly of Brazilian jazz, this collection is an invaluable treasure trove. Intelligently assembled and well documented, it helps fill a major gap in the hidden history of one of the world's most fertile musical cultures. Recommended!\n\nVarious Artists \"THE BRAZILIAN FUNK EXPERIENCE\" (Nascente Records, 2006)\n\nWell, I guess one person's booty-shaking funk explosion is another person's fusion/soft-pop/soul serenade... Especially when one of them is a British club DJ, and the other is a yobbish Yank living near Oakland. Anyway, I'm not trying to say that DJ Patrick Forge doesn't know his stuff -- clearly he does, and this disc is a nice bit of cratedigging, picking out some interesting and occasionally atypical oldies from folks like Alaide Costa, Joao Donato, Joyce, Elza Soares and Marcos Valle -- it's just that most of these tracks are hardly what I would consider (or advertise) as \"funk.\" To me, funk is more like George Clinton and Bootsy Collins, James Brown and The Bar-Kays, and less like Lionel Richie or Manhattan Transfer. (Okay, that's not an entirely fair contrast, but it's close...) Anyway, this set of tracks drawn from the Odeon vaults, with material dating from 1968-1980, and includes several rarities as well as some nice surprises (Djavan's 1978 recording of \"Nereci,\" with duet vocals by Mariazinha, is an album highlight. I'm skeptical of the \"funk\" label -- I think it's pretty misleading -- but folks who like downtempo soul'n'samba will probably enjoy this quite a bit. Certainly worth checking out!\n\nVarious Artists \"BRAZILIAN LOVE AFFAIR 3\" (Far Out Records, 2002)\n\nLounge-y Brazilian electronica and soft funk-fusion. I was actually surprised by how much I enjoyed this album, although others may find it a bit cloying. There were only a couple of tunes I found irritating; otherwise this is a nicely programmed, completely listenable album, featuring several fairly well-known new artists (Otto, Max De Castro, Joyce and others), some old-timers who are trying their hands at the new sound, and several bands that are well off the radar. It's easy listening of a pretty classy caliber. Recommended.\n\nVarious Artists \"BRAZILIAN LULLABY\" (Ellipsis Arts, 1999)\n\nIt probably shouldn't surprise you if I were to tell you that this disc is a little on the sleepy side... soporific, in fact. Pursuing their typically offbeat interests, the folks at Ellipsis slow things down a bit with this gentle set of lusophone sleepy-time tunes. Those of you who find yourselves complaining about modern Brazilian music being too mellow might wanna pass on this one... But maybe a few of you out there have some little pals who need some sleep to grow on, and this may help out. Most of the artists on here are folks I've never heard of, other than Monica Salmaso and Arnaldo Antunes... his tune \"Dorme,\" intoned in his trademark bullfrog grumble, is certainly one of the highlights of this collection.\n\nVarious Artists \"BRAZILIAN PEBBLES: ACID, FLOWERS AND FUZZ GARAGE PSYCHEDELIA\" (Baratos Afins, 2000)\n\nCool set of modern-day psychedelic and garage bands from Sao Paulo, ranging from \"Secret Agent Man\"-style surf-pop to totally trippy, echo-laden swirly stuff. A lot of variety and pretty cool bands. Particularly noteworthy are Nihilo, Os Espectros and Makina Du Tempo, who achieve the largest sounds on here, as well as the Superchunk-y Effervescing Elephant, whose \"J. Jenie Junk\" is pretty fun, despite being sung in English. Debts to numerous North American bands are plain, as are the inevitable nods towards hometown heroes, Os Mutantes. Well worth checking out, especially considering how little indiepop comes out of Brazil, and how good so much of it is. (NOTE: the Baratos Afins record store, which put this disc out, is probably the only place you're likely to find this album. Check out their website from the link above for mailorder info, as well as info on other Brazilian indie bands.)\n\nAndy Votel/Various Artists \"(ANDY VOTEL) BRAZILIKA\" (Far Out Records, 2008)\n\nA series of mash-ups and remixes of classic tropicalia and tropicalia-era rock and samba-pop, drawn from the archives of the RGE and Som Livre labels... In principle, I'm not that into the whole \"remix\" idea, though Votel does a nice job - this is listenable, and highlights a lot of well-chosen tracks. Still, it gets a little too \"clubby\" and beats-driven for me...\n\nVarious Artists \"BRAZIL NOW\" (Capitol/Metro Blue Records, 1998)\n\nBrazilian pop, mostly recorded around 1996, though with a handful of \"oldies\" thrown in at the end. Cheesy, but solid, ballad-oriented pop. It does stick to the old school, though, with tracks by old-timers such as Maria Bethania, Lo Borges, Nana Caymmi, and only barely hints at the younger crowd. Worth checking out, though probably not for everyone.\n\nVarious Artists \"BRESIL -- CHORO - SAMBA - FREVO: 1914-1945\" (Fremeaux & Associates/France, 1998)\n\nColossal. Enthralling. Essential. Legendary figures from the dawn of samba such as Pixinguinha, Noel Rosa, Sinho and Ary Barroso may seem distant and antique, but this excellent French compilation brings their music back with resounding immediacy. Two CDs worth of catchy, classy, crazy, playful creativity with an old-timey, jazzy feel. A lot of this would work well alongside old big band tunes, or Django Reinhardt records. HIGHLY recommended. Also check out the similar BRESIL: SAMBA collection.\n\nVarious Artists \"BRESIL -- LE CHANT DU NORDESTE: 1928-1950\" (Fremeaux & Associates, 2003)\n\nVarious Artists \"SAMBA -- BATUQUE - PARTIDO ALTO - SAMBA-CANCAO: 1917-1947\" (Fremeaux & Associates, 1998)\n\nThe second in this fabulous archival series of early Brazilian pop songs. Of course, this 2-CD collection has a tasty sampling of early Carmen Miranda recordings, but better yet are the two dozen other tracks featuring fabulous artists whose work has been next to impossible to find for decades. Noel Rosa, Bahianho, Mario Reis, Cyro Monteiro and others are all represented -- this is a HIGHLY recommended collection!!\n\nVarious Artists \"CHORO: 1906-1947\" (Fremeaux & Associates/France, 1998)\n\nAnother stunner in this incredible French series. A beautiful collection of mostly-instrumental music, featuring the legendary Pixinguinha and acoustic jazz pioneer, mandolinist Jacob do Bandolim. There is some teensy overlap between this and the first BRESIL comp, but it's pretty negligible considering how great both collections are. This collection is indispensable for anyone looking into the roots of Brazilian samba.\n\nVarious Artists \"BRIZZI DO BRASIL\" (Amitata Records, 2004)\n\nThe songs of Aldo Brizzi, an Italian MPB enthusiast who writes some pretty nice stuff, covered here by Arnaldo Antunes, Zeca Baleiro, Carlinhos Brown, Gilberto Gil, Margareth Menezes, Caetano Veloso and others among the cream of modern Brazilian singers. The only weak moment on here was Virginia Rodrigues's take on the song \"Cat's\" -- I guess I just have to face up to the fact that I just don't like her voice, which I find precious and cloying. Otherwise, this is a very rich, sumptuous record -- well worth checking out!\n\nVarious Artists \"CANTORES DO RADIO v.1\" (EMI-Brasil, 2000)\n\nVarious Artists \"CANTORES DO RADIO v.2\" (EMI-Brasil, 2000)\n\nTwo double-CD collections, which feature several of the greatest stars of the 1920s, '30s and '40s, legendary figures such as Joao do Barro, Aracy de Almeida, Noel Rosa and Carmen Miranda who rose to fame as stars of radio and film in the pre-bossa nova, pre-TV era. Mostly this is gorgeous stuff, jam packed with classic samba cancao material and big band-y vocals. The tracks on the second volume are of slightly later vintage - a handful of songs from the 1930s, and a few tilting into the 1970s, featuring artists like the Trio Do Ouro, Os Guaranis, Odette Amaral and even Cauby Peixoto (who is credited as being the first Brazilian vocalist to record a rock'n'roll tune). These two collections are part of EMI's impressive reissue series, Cantores Do Radio, which includes over two dozen separate titles. Recommended!!\n\nVarious Artists \"CAPOEIRA MATA UM: THE RHYTHM OF BAHIA/THE SOUND OF THE WORLD\" (Tropical Music, 2001)\n\nA strikingly varied set of songs based on the beat and boing-boing-boing of Bahia's homegrown martial arts form, capoeira. This is a much richer and more melodic set than most capoeira albums, which tend to stick to the rhythms and can get a little repetitious. Here, by contrast, artists from throughout the world modernize and play around with this distinctive sound -- there's fairly traditional material, mixed in with funk, samba, techno and pop stylizations... there's even one improbable free jazz track! This album is both challenging and a lulling delight to hear... Recommended!\n\nVarious Artists \"CARNAVAL BRESILIEN: 1930-1956\" (Fremeaux)\n\nVarious Artists \"CARTOLA: O SOL NASCERA\" (Revivendo)\n\nA stunning collection of antique samba recordings, written by Angenor de Oliveira (aka Cartola), one of the great early sambistas and a founder of the Estacao Primeira de Mangueira, one of Brazil's largest samba schools. Most of these recordings are from the early 1930s, although it spans into the early '80s as well. If you enjoy old Carmen Miranda records, then this disc full of forgotten singers such as Sylvio Caldas, Arnaldo Amaral and crooner Francisco Alves will be a real treat. Also includes a sprinkling of Cartola's own rare recordings -- which are lovely. A few tracks towards the end are a bit goopy, and the \"medley\" at the end is clumsily edited, but these are only minor imperfections in an otherwise killer historical record.\n\nVarious Artists \"CASA DA MAE JOANA\" (Blue Jackel/Natasha Records, 1998)\n\nBeautiful acoustic music -- one of the best modern collections you can find, if you're searching for the gentle balladry style of yesteryear. These are new recordings, but include several old masters, such as Ze Keti, Nelson Sargento and Wilson Moreira. Gorgeous songs and gentle sambas, with more emphasis on the melody than the rhythm... This brings to mind the wonderful albums made by the acoustic sambistas of the early '70s. Recommended!\n\nVarious Artists \"CASA EDISON E SEU TEMPO\" (CD/Book/DVD) (Biscoito Fino, 2002)\n\nUntil 1928, there was only one recording studio in Brazil, the Casa Edison in Rio de Janeiro, a business that grew out of an appliance store that sold refrigerators, typewriters and phonograms. The store's owner, Fred Figner, cut deals with Odeon and Parlaphone to provide Brazilian music, and became the locus for the birth of a national music culture. This massive book/CD/DVD collection is an insanely valuable historical resource, documenting the lifespan of the Casa Edison whirlwind. It includes massive amounts of primary source material: reproduced on the DVDs are thousands of scanned photographs and documents -- Figner's correspondence with labels and clients, various sales catalogs from the 1910's, '20s and '30s (including those for sound equipment such as the gorgeous trumpet-shaped gramophones, as well as the other items sold in the Edison stock), reproductions of labels on dozens of ancient 78s, typed and handwritten lyric sheets for dozens of early samba songs, and photos of numerous dimly-remembered music stars of yesteryear. For musicians, one of the greatest bonanzas is a DVD devoted to the original sheet music to dozens of old samba and choro tunes (including the original artwork, which, in true Brazilian fashion, sometimes included revealingly sensual or racially-tinged imagery.) The book is massive, and a bit unwieldy, but gorgeous and packed with valuable information. Best of all, there are four CDs worth of primal Brazilian pop -- old-school sambas, various half-forgotten styles, and musicians who beckon back to the misty origins of the modern Brazilian musical scene. Super-cool, if you are heavily into the early years of Brazilian music.\n\nVarious Artists \"CAYMMI: 90 ANOS -- MAR E TERRA\" (BMG, 2004)\n\nA pleasant, solid set of songs written by the great samba cancao composer, Dorival Caymmi. This 2-CD anthology is only partly a usual suspects gathering, with MPB heavyweights such as Maria Bethania and Gal Costa and samba revivalists such as Paulinho Da Viola and Ivone Lara; what makes this collection so valuable, though, is the inclusion of numerous tracks from the golden years of the samba cancao and the \"radio singers\" era, performances from the 1940s and '50s by Anjos De Inferno, Trio De Ouro, Francisco Carlos, Angela Maria and others, antique recordings (with great sound quality, coming straight from the original major label vaults), skillfully programmed alongside more modern recordings by the likes of Fafa De Belem, Elba Ramalho, Almir Sater, Jussara Silveira and Angela Ro-Ro. The selections are kind of capricious or unexpected -- there's even a track by Sarah Vaughan (and nothing by Caymmi himself, or any of his family) -- but what's most remarkable is the album's overall listenabilty... There are perhaps two or three tracks that I found icky and saccharine, whereas the rest of the record was quite nice... That's a pretty good batting average for an MPB set... Definitely worth picking up!\n\nVarious Artists \"OS CHOROS DOS CHOROES\" (RCA, 1977)\n\nA delightful collection of the best, classic Brazilian choro recordings. This nostalgia album originally came out in 1977, packed with lively performances from four giants of the choro style, saxophonist Pixinguinha, flautist Benedicto Lacerda, mandolin master Jacob Do Bandolim and bandleader Canhoto, all recorded in top form between 1946-52. This disc is a perfect introduction to the best of the genre, and is a delight to listen to... Highly recommended!\n\nVarious Artists \"CHOROS: SUCESSOS INESQUECIVEIS\" (Copacabana, 1998)\n\nAn interesting multi-label collection of latter-day choro recordings... Things kick off with an electrified version of Pixinguinha's, \"Odeon,\" with a fuzzed-out guitar wailing away over the chugging rhythm. Blasphemy, right? Yeah, totally -- except that the blasphemer in question is actually Pixinguinha himself, on one of his early 1970s revival albums... There are also later recordings by the likes of Severino Araujo, Waldir Azevedo, Altamiro Carrilho, Abel Ferreira and Deo Rian, as well as revivalists such as Os Choroes and Joel Nascimento, and even some nostalgia-trip numbers by rockers Lo Borges and Beto Guedes... A few tunes are painfully saccharine, but these thankfully are in the minority -- and though the overall tone is a bit too smooth and modern, there are still some lovely tracks here... High marks go to Os Choroes for the dazzling virtuoso flute work on their 1971 recording of \"Bentevi Atre-Vido...\" Whew! Now that's some real showboating!!\n\nVarious Artists \"CITY OF GOD\" (Soundtrack) (Milan Records, 2003)\n\nThe soundtrack to Fernando Meirelles' hard-hitting, gritty feature film about life in the favela slums. An excellent collection of vintage \"Black Rio\" Brazilian soul, including tracks by Tim Maia, crooner Hyldon and Wilson Simonal's hipsterdelic \"Nao Vem Que Nao Tem,\" which was previously anthologized on the SAMBA SOUL '70 album reviewed below. Also included are sweet samba tunes from Cartola, an elder of the Mangueira samba school, and the anthemic \"Metamorfose Ambulante,\" by rocker Raul Seixas. It's a fine set of classic songs to start with, but the new material that augments and connects these tracks is also pretty cool, '70s-styled funksploitation instrumentals by Antonio Pinto and Ed Cortez, along with a new samba-soul song by Seu Jorge, one of the best new artists in the style. This is a really groovy collection, definitely worth checking out!\n\nVarious Artists \"COISAS MINHAS: LUPICINIO RODRIGUES - 90 ANOS\" (RCA-BMG, 2004)\n\nThis 2-CD tribute to songwriter Lupicinio Rodrigues (1914-1974) highlights the contrasts of his work, from the stylistic differences between his more upbeat samba cancao and the slower romantic material that seems influenced by the Latin American boleros, to the different approaches artists have taken to his songs over the years. Disc One tilts towards older recordings, with artists from the golden age of samba cancao and the \"radio singer\" era -- Isaura Garcia, Nelson Goncalves, Cyro Monteiro, Orlando Silva, et. al. -- while Disc Two begins in the 1960s and works through recordings made in the '70s, '80s and '90s, showing the durability of his songwriting. While much of this collection is a bit florid and sleek, it's also pretty classy. Worth checking out.\n\nVarious Artists \"DANCE MUSIC FROM BRAZIL: CHOROS AND FORRO\" (Nimbus Records, 2000)\n\nA far-flung but fairly wimpy 4-CD set that features about four hours of mostly-instrumental music drawn from this label's vast catalog. It's not actually a proper compilation so much as a collection of albums... each disc features a separate group: Os Ingenuos, Oficina De Cordas, Camarao, and the Fred Dantas/Ailton Reiner ensemble each tackle a separate style -- choro, forro, etc. Like many choro albums, this disc might be best taken in small dose, but there is some truly fabulous musical virtuosity on display here. The forro disc has the greatest variety, but they're all worth checking out. A great introduction to the styles, and the label.\n\nVarious Artists \"DAORA: UNDERGROUND SOUNDS OF URBAN BRASIL\" (Mais Um Discos, 2013)\n\nVarious Artists \"DESTINATION: BRAZIL\" (Sugo Music/National Geographic, 2001)\n\nPart of an interesting series of musical \"journeys\" sponsored by the National Geographic. This has a nice selection of modern artists: Caetano Veloso, his niece Belo Velloso, Bebel Gilberto, Suba, Ana Caram and the like. The Quarteto Jobim-Morelenbaum provides a more traditionalist link to old-school bossa nova, and Fatima Guedes to the older acoustic sambas... The coolest part of this disc is the accompanying geographic/social info: a brief timeline of Brazilian history, descriptions of major musical styles and instruments, tips on various music festivals and, of course, one of those great National Geographic maps. Pretty mainstream, overall, but a nice introductory collection.\n\nVarious Artists \"O DOUTOR DO BAIAO: HUMBERTO TEXEIRA\" (Biscoito Fino, 2003)\n\nA splendid live tribute to composer Humberto Texeira, one of the great founders of modern Northeastern pop... Texeira's legacy tends to be overshadowed by his connection to forro star Luiz Gonzaga, but this fine concert album brings his work to the foreground, with rich, heartfelt renditions of his old baiao compositions from the middle the 20th Century. It's an all-star cast, packed with MPB royalty: Maria Bethania, Chico Buarque, Gal Costa and Gilberto Gil on call for the '70s old guard, Lenine and Rita Ribeiro representing the younger generation, Elba Ramalho and Fagner as Texeira's nordestinho stylistic stepchildren. High marks go to Caetano Veloso for his soft, piercing rendition of \"Baiao De Dois,\" although one of the most surprising artists on here is alt-rocker Lenine, who gives a similarly gentle, exploratory performance. This entire album is quite nice, actually, highlighting the fun, playful, bouncy aspects of Texeira's work, while liberating it from the manic, hyperactive feel of the original, old-school baiao recordings of the 1940s and '50s. This disc does for Texeira's legacy what the BAIAO DE VIRAMUNDO collection did for Gonzaga in 2000: it shows the elasticity and enduring appeal of these gloriously catchy old pop tunes. Recommended!\n\nVarious Artists \"ESCOLAS DE SAMBA\" (RCA, 2002)\n\nA great 2-CD collection of various Carnaval themes by the various escolas that dominate the parades from year to year. These are studio recordings, mainly drawn from the '80s and '90s, and are on the slick, poppy side, but still quite nice. Featured performers include Neguinho Da Beija-Flor, Jamelao, Quinho, Dede Da Portela, Dominguinhos Do Estacio and Sergio Do Porto. RCA has really been on a roll with all these \"100 Anos\" releases, and this is certainly one worth picking up if you want to check out the non-MPB end of the modern scene.\n\nVarious Artists \"ESTACAO LAPA\" (Deckdisc, 2005)\n\n(Produced by Joao Augusto & Teresa Cristina)\n\nA sweet set of acoustic samba performances and a smidge of choro, with a lovely repertoire curated by modern samba star Teresa Cristina. This album -- named after a Sao Paulo subway station -- features a great mix of performers, from old-timers such as Cristina Buarque, Dona Ivone Lara and Nilze Carvalho, to newer, more obscure players who are solidly in the contemporary roots samba scene. The record holds together well as an album, a delight to listen to from beginning to end. Recommended!!\n\nVarious Artists \"ESTACAO LAPA, v.2\" (Deckdisc, 2007)\n\nEXPLOSAO DO SAMBA (series) - see series discography\n\nVarious Artists \"FAVELA CHIC: POSTNOVE 1\" (BMG-France, 2001)\n\nVarious Artists \"FAVELA CHIC: POSTNOVE 2\" (BMG-France, 2002)\n\nThis series was assembled by the DJs at a hip Parisian nightclub , where it's said to be all the rage. This volume opens with several well-selected 70s rock and soul numbers, by the likes of Trio Ternura, Rita Lee and Toni Tornado; it moves into more modern remix tracks from labels such as Trama and Natasha, and then alternates back and forth between classic tropicalia and contemporary novo-tronica. It's not bad!\n\nVarious Artists \"FAVELA CHIC: POSTNOVE 3\" (BMG-France, 2004)\n\nVarious Artists \"FAVELA CHIC: POSTNOVE 4\" (BMG-France, 2006)\n\nVarious Artists \"FESTA BRASIL\" (Putumayo, 2000)\n\nSadly, this contemporary samba cancao collection reverts to Putumayo's older style of goofy, safely synth-poppy \"world music\" vibe... leaning towards overproduced feel-good material, of varying degrees of interest. Some of it's perfectly fine, some of it's pretty drekky -- Braz-pop purists may find it a bit bland, but it could still be a nice stocking stuffer for an uninitiated pal. And it collects tracks such as Gal Costa's version of the forro oldie, \"Chiclete Com Banana\", which is better heard here than on the original Costa album (which is pretty awful). Other artists include Zeca Pagodinho, Ivete Sangolo, Pepeu Gomes and Rita Ribeiro.\n\nVarious Artists \"FESTIVAIS v.1-2\" (Globo, 1997)\n\nThe exact provenance of these recordings is a little unclear... the liner notes are laudatory and expansive, yet not very specific about recording dates, etc. Still, looking at some of the artists included, it's clear that these tracks are not strictly drawn from the golden years of the MPB song competitions (which ended in 1971), and most tracks do not appear to have been recorded live, either. My guess is that this is a set that draws in part on studio recordings of songs that were originally presented at the old MPB festivals, as well as from the lesser ranks of soft pop artists of the times. Some of this material is painfully sappy, although several gems are included, such as Caetano Veloso's early hit, \"Alegria, Alegria,\" Gal Costa's version of \"Divino Maravilhoso,\" and \"Amigo e Pra,\" an actual live concert track by the MPB-4, which is one of the liveliest songs I've ever heard by them. An uneven 2-CD set which has a few cool tracks.\n\nVarious Artists \"FOCUS: O ESSENCIAL DE ESCOLAS DE SAMBA\" (BMG, 1999)\n\nA nice collection of recent Carnaval themes, including some by stars such as Martinho da Vila, who helped shape the modern sound of the escolas. These are all themes of recent vintage, from 1980-99, but that's hardly a liability. The sound quality is great, the melodies are rich... Sure, the rhythm gets a bit repetitive if you listen to the whole album all at once, but taken in small doses, this is pretty fab. A recommended record from a neglected style.\n\nVarious Artists \"FORRO: MUSIC FOR MAIDS AND TAXI DRIVERS\" (Rounder Records, 1989)\n\nForro music isn't for everyone, but this is one of the best collections of this manic accordion-based music currently available in the US: if you want to check the style out, this is a great place to start. The artist selection is off the beaten track, and the emphasis is fairly rootsy (this is Rounder after all...) The title refers to the distain that many of the more cosmopolitan Brazilians hold for the rural forro style... As in, \"What? You listen to forro? Good lord, why? Only taxi drivers listen to that!!\" Sort of like Mexican ranchera music in California. . But, hey, judge for yourself. This is pretty solid collection, with plenty of super-catchy material. This collection centers on little-known younger amateur artists, including Duda Da Passira, Toinho De Alegras, Jose Orlando and Heleno Dos Oito Baixos... For information about more well-known artists, check out my forro section...\n\nVarious Artists \"GAFIEIRA BRASIL\" (BMG, 1999)\n\nWahoo!! Some truly swingin' big-bandish samba-jazz from the 1950s, '60s and '70s, dance music that hearkens back to older styles like the maxixe and baiao, while fusing them with a hard-edged, American bandstand jazz. It's a style of Brazilian pop I haven't heard much of, made by artists who have been largely forgotten over the years. Os Velhinhos Transviados, Ases Do Ritmo, Fats Elpidio and others are anthologized along with 1950s bandleader Aristides Zacharias, someone I'd only known before from cheapo, budget label LPs (\"Romance In Rio!\", etc.) and whose work I'd dismissed as kitschy, sell-out, faux-Braziliania made for the North American easy listening crowd way back when... Well, it turns out he really rocks! Modern-day Brazilians don't seem to care for these guys much either; this album is the only place I know of that you can get any of their work on CD... A pity, because it's fun stuff, and deserves a fuller exploration in the digital reissue age... There are also some more recent recordings from Paulo Moura, who I guess is the main modern exponent of the gafieira style... Anyway, if you can track this disc down, it's totally worth it. (I got my copy through SomLivre.com...) Recommended!\n\nVarious Artists \"GLUCKLICH v.1\" (Compost Records, 1999)\n\nVarious Artists \"GLUCKLICH v.2\" (Compost Records, 1999)\n\nVarious Artists \"GLUCKLICH v.3\" (Compost Records, 1999)\n\nVarious Artists \"GLUCKLICH v.4\" (Compost Records, 2000)\n\nVarious Artists \"GLUCKLICH v.5\" (Compost Records, 2002)\n\nHouse-ish European takes on EZ-brazillica, some tracks with a vaguely Austin Powers/Sergio Mendes retro '60s feel. This kind of chill-room easy listening isn't entirely my cup of tea, but I suppose that for the style, these are strong collections. They include new recordings, as well as older, obscure recordings from the '70s and '80s. Highlights on v. 3 include Boozoo Bajou's swinging \"Night Over Manaus\" and \"Ye Mele\" by Brazil Selection. I have not heard the other volumes in this series, but imagine it is rather similar territory. [Check out the Compost website for more information.]\n\nVarious Artists \"GERACAO ANOS 80: SINGLES, VOLUME 1\" (Warner, 2007)\n\nSynthesizer pop come to Brazil: here is a top-notch collection of genuine, spazzy '80s New Wave, Brazilian-style, with a slight punkish vibe. I'm not sure, but I think this might actually be a straight reissue of the singles sampler that brought Kid Abelha to the top of the charts, and also introduced bands such as Ira!, Titas and Ultraje A Rigor. Also included is an energetic (though dorky) single by Lulu Santos, as well as tunes by AgentSS, Azul 29, the R&B-ish Brylho and (no, not the same band) Magazine. Anyone who would like to learn more about Brazilian new wave and punk/rock would do well to check this compilation out... It's pretty strong, even considering the genre. Amazing that Kid Abelha did so well, though: Paula Toller sounded just awwwwwful on these early recordings!\n\nVarious Artists \"HAIR\" (Brazilian Soundtrack) (Fermata, 1969)\n\nA cultural curio, but an unimpressive recording... The singers and the band are uniformly mediocre, at best. A fan of the original production might get a kick out of hearing it translated into Portuguese, but other than that there's really no \"there\" there. (Side note: apparently actress Sonia Braga was in the original cast; I'm not sure if she sings on this album...)\n\nVarious Artists \"HEARTS OF STONE/CORACOES DE PEDRA\" (Magica, 2000)\n\nYeah, baby!! Brazilian beat from the mid-'60s, with plenty of cover tunes but also a healthy dose of originals. The best known groups on here are (of course) Renato e Seus Blue Caps and Os Beat Boys, but mainly this is for-real, off-the-beaten-track, honest-to-goodness teen beat from the British Invasion days. For those of us who like kitschy cover tunes that don't suck, and who are trying to delve into the dim, misty past of Brazil's pre-tropicalia rock scene, this is an ultra-invaluable find. Plus, it's even got (gasp!) great, well-written liner notes. Okay, so when's volume dois come out?\n\nVarious Artists \"HIP HOP: CULTURA NA RUA\" (Eldorado, 1988)\n\nThis was, apparently, the first hip-hop collection in Brazil, featuring Thaide & DJ Hum, and others...\n\nVarious Artists \"HIP HOP: CULTURA NA RUA, v.2\" (Eldorado)\n\nVarious Artists \"HIP HOP: O PODER DE TRANSFORMACAO\" (Paradoxx, 1997)\n\nVarious Artists \"HISTORIA DA ODEON: 1902-1952 - AS PRIMEIRAS MUSICAS DO SECULO XX\" (EMI-Brasil, 2003)\n\nWow! This is easily one of the best and most exciting Brazilian reissues in recent years, a sweeping, 3-CD set that covers the first five decades of the Odeon label's illustrious career in Brazil. For a comprehensive, compelling look at the giddy, dynamic early years of samba cancao and other Brazilian pop, this collection is hard to beat. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.\n\nVarious Artists \"HISTORIA DA ODEON, v.2\" (EMI-Brasil, 2007)\n\nThis 3-CD set is a much-welcome, but too-brief followup to the earlier HISTORIA collection, which traced the history of the Odeon label in Brazil, from 1902-1952. That first volume is one of the finest archival releases to come out of Brazil in the digital era, and I've been greatly looking forward to this second set. In some regards, it's a little disappointing, largely because of the embarrassment of musical riches in the post-bossa nova era. EMI was at the forefront of the jazz-pop crossovers of the classic \"Musica Popular Brasileira\" (MPB) scene of the late 1960s and '70s, recording key artists such as Luiz Gonzaga, Jr., Ivan Lins, Milton Nascimento Marcos Valle, and others, as well as samba revivalists like pagode diva Clara Nunes and acoustic virtuoso Paulinho Da Viola. Accordingly, they rush into these years and largely gloss over the pre-bossa \"radio singers\" of the 1950s, and even pay scant attention to the bossa years, even though they had some great artists in their bossa nova roster. (The first recordings of Joao Gilberto, the master of the style, remain tied up in legal snarls, so his groundbreaking classic, \"Chega De Saudade,\" is, sadly, not included here, and there are some other omissions, though nothing else as fundamental as Gilberto...) Once in the thick of the MPB years, the selection is, of necessity, all too short, and subject to endless second-guessing and criticism. Odeon had an astonishing surplus of top talent and innovative musicianship in the early '70s, and for any given artist the choice of which single song to choose is maddening. They manage to include a few relative obscurities in alongside the stars (and this is good, since obscurities and new discoveries are what I look for in box sets...) but the time flies by quickly -- MPB's golden years are bracketed on the other side by an equally cursory overview of the 1980s and '90s, when rock and rap crept into the Brazilian pop scene, and the slick stuff got even slicker. Here again, the scope of the era -- from 1982-2002 -- is too much to do justice in a single CD. Several noteworthy artists are sampled, including rockers such as Os Paralamas Do Sucesso and Blitz, soul singers and modern pop stars, some obscure and some mainstream. With such a daunting sweep, and wit so much more music recorded in the second half of the century, as opposed to the first, perhaps EMI would have done well to divide this project into even more than these six discs -- the '70s MPB scene along could easily accommodate three of its own. Still, as a general overview of one of Brazil's greatest labels, this is an impressive collection, and a great introduction to dozens of great artists. Worth checking out, although fans of old-school samba will want to track down the first volume as well.\n\nVarious Artists \"HISTORIA DEL CARNAVAL, v.1\" (Ubatuqui, 1992)\n\nVarious Artists \"HISTORIA DEL CARNAVAL, v.2\" (Ubatuqui, 1992)\n\nVarious Artists \"HISTORIA DEL CARNAVAL, v.3: 1902-1952\" (Ubatuqui, 1992)\n\nA nice set of formal, studio-based recordings of various Carnaval theme songs... Although this series ranges from 1902 forward, this third disc actually only spans the last part of the dates listed: here are some groovy Carnaval themes from 1941-52, many of which have obvious and interesting elements of North American-style big band swing, particularly with the complex brass arrangements. These versions are generally by big-name samba-cancao stars such as Anjos do Inferno, Aracy de Almeida, Atualfo Alves, Francisco Alves, Carlos Galhardo, Orlando Silva and Trio Irakitan. There are also several less well-known, more generic artists (which is in keeping with later Caranval recordings) such as 4 Ases & Un Coringa, Joel & Escola and Vocalistas Tropicais... Also included in this list (and the main reason I picked this collection up) is the much vaunted avant-classical producer-arranger, Rogerio Duprat, who was apparently booked in 1950 and '52 to record some Carnaval themes (\"O General Da Banda\" and \"Lata D'Agua\". His arrangements are, frankly, a bit generic and don't really give much indication of the wild, genre-defying inventiveness he would contribute to the 1960s tropicalia scene, but it's still interesting to see a bit of his early roots. Sadly, the liner notes are confined to a general essay about the history of Carnaval as a Brazilian cultural phenomenon, and don't add much in the way of recording info, other than the years each song was written and recorded, and the names of the authors and performers. Similar in scope (if not breadth) to the Revivendo label's extensive Carnaval series.\n\nVarious Artists \"HOME OF SAMBA\" (Universal/Pure Brazil, 2004)\n\nA strong set of live, in-concert duets that pair major-league samba stars with Brazilian pop singers... These shows were originally recorded in the late 1990s and released as the four-volume \"Casa De Samba\" series, but they still sound as classy, vibrant and lively now as they did nearly a decade ago... The collaborators include Jorge Ben & Ivete Sangelo, Beth Carvalho & Zelia Duncan, Simone & Marthinho Da Vila, Nelson Sargento & Chico Cesar, and numerous other combinations... Caetano Veloso, who was in a particularly fruitful phase of his career, sings on a couple of tracks, bringing an irrepressible joyfulness to his parts... Some of the songs on this album drift into the overly-lavish pop styles of the MPB scene, but for the most part these are pretty solid, compelling performances. Worth checking out!\n\nVarious Artists \"JACKSON DO PANDEIRO: RETRATO E SAMPLEADO\" (BMG-Brasil, 1999)\n\nThis tribute to forro legend Jackson do Pandeiro features a bunch of younger contemporary Brazilian artists, along with old-timers such as Gal Costa, Chico Buarque and Elba Ramalho. Soul, trip-hop, dancehall and rap weave throughout about half of these tracks; the rest stick more closely to traditional forro arrangements. The two tracks by Lenine are disappointing, but on balance this is a nice set, with surprisingly few weak moments.\n\nVarious Artists \"JOAO BATISTA DO VALE\" (RCA, 1995)\n\n(Produced by Chico Buarque, Srgio Carvalho & Jose Milton)\n\nA nice all-star homage to songwriter Joao do Vale, organized by Chico Buarque, who kicks things off with a swank version of \"Minha Historia\" and is joined by other MPB luminaries: Alcione, Geraldo Azevedo, Maria Bethania, Joao Bosco, Paulinho da Viola, Raimundo Fagner, Edu Lobo and many others. The performances are uniformly solid (though at times a bit sedate) with Do Vale's forro roots weaving in and out in song after song. I'm not sure if all the songs on here were made specially for this compilation, or if some were taken from individual artists' albums. A nice spin on some great old songs.\n\nVarious Artists \"JOVEM GUARDA\" (Polydor, 1999)\n\nWell, THIS was a huge disappointment. I took one look at the cover in the stores and got all giddy: it's just what I was looking for!! A sampler of all the goofy Brazilian roqueiro acts that appeared on Roberto Carlos' 1960s TV show, Jovem Guarda! How cool is that?? Not very, as it turns out. Who would have ever imagined that, instead of putting out a collection of Mod-era oldies, Polygram would instead get all these geezers together for a 1995 studio session to re-record their songs? Yeah, many of the big names are here -- Erasmo Carlos, Wanderlea, the Fevers, Renato e Seus Bluecaps -- but in watery, smoothed out modern form, with all the vigor of an ABBA cover band playing at the county fair with a hangover. Sigh. The only mildly noteworthy track is Caetano Veloso relaxing and having a toss at a version of \"Road Hog,\" a song that Roberto Carlos used to do back in the day. Roberto, himself, is notably absent from this project.\n\nVarious Artists \"(AS 16 MAIS DA) JOVEM GUARDA\" (Globo/Universal, 2000)\n\nAnd ditto for this disc, which even has some overlap with the one mentioned above. The only improvement is the cooler cover art... but then again, that might not be such a great thing, after all, since you don't want to buy this disc either. Sigh.\n\nHerivelto Martins/Various Artists \"JUBILEU HERIVELTO\" (RCA Victor, 1957)\n\nThis is a tribute album released in 1957, honoring the career of Brazilian pop songwriter Herivelto Martins. Martins doesn't actually perform on the record, but the artists who do -- Nelson Goncalves, Dircinha & Linda Batista, Ivon Curi, Carlos Galhardo, Trio De Ouro, etc. -- represent the creme-de-la-creme of the pre-bossa \"radio singers\" era. If you like old-fashioned nostalgic music, this is a wonderful collection. Nice instrumental choro/jazz turns from Jacob Do Bandolim and Zaccarias, as well!\n\nCarlos Cachaca/Various Artists \"MANGUEIRA: SAMBAS DE TERREIRO E OUTROS SAMBAS\" (Arquivo Geral da Cidade do Rio de Janeiro, 1999)\n\nThis 2-LP set gathers historical recordings of a number of Mangueira samba school members, including a handful of recordings Cachaca made in the 1940s and '50s. The artists include Cartola, Jacob Do Bandolim, Nelson Cavaquinho, Clementina de Jesus, Ze Keti and many others who are more obscure; the music is mostly pretty awesome.\n\nVarious Artists \"O MELHOR DA JOVEM GUARDA\" (Som Livre, 2002)\n\nYay! This 3-CD set is perhaps the best-programmed of the major label JG collections, spanning the teenybopper back-catalogs of several different labels, and thankfully avoiding the bulk of their drippy-sounding, slower ballads. Plenty of rock'n'roll cover tunes, all at mid- to moderate tempo, with performances by plenty of well-known JG stars and tons of more obscure one-hit wonders such as Os Caculas, Dori Edson, Joelma, Giane, Vox Deorum, etc. The edition I got came packaged in a kooky metal tin, but I suspect the three discs may also be offered individually. At any rate, this is a top-flight collection, well worth looking for if you're curious about the Brazilian bubblegum beat. Fun stuff!\n\nVarious Artists \"MUQUIFO RECORDS APRESENTA: COMP_01|02 - ORGANICO | SINTETICO\" (Muquifo, 2001)\n\nA nice, 2-CD sampler of Brazilian electronica, with artists such as Superagua, DJ Dolores, Sons Of The Beat, etc., and erstwhile indie-rockers like Jupiter Apple in tow as well. The first disc (\"Organico\") is mellower, more melodic stuff, and while it isn't until the end of the disc that we start hearing sounds that seem distinctly \"Brazilian,\" it's a nice little chill room set. The \"Sintetico\" disc, predictably, is a little harder and more mechanical -- a fairly generic set of uptempo house music. Nothing special there, unless you're into that scene, in which case I suppose this is pretty decent. (But honestly, how the hell can anyone tell the difference between these artists?) Nice to know Brazilians are as capable of making club music as anyone else. I liked the first disc.\n\nVarious Artists \"MUSICANOSSA\" (Forma, 1968)\n\n(Arranged by Ugo Marotta)\n\nThis album seems to have been a project of Roberto Menescal, attempting to get something cooking in the post-bossa era. There are two tracks by his Conjunto Roberto Menescal and organist Ugo Marotta is credited as the album's arranger -- also, the backing on all the vocalists sounds pretty similar, so I'm thinking that's his band backing them as well. The singers are a mixed bag: a group called Agora 4 are chirpy and charming, while solo singers Magda and Regininha are both rather lackluster. Likewise with romantic singer Jorge Nery, who does a great duet with Johnny Alf (the lively, intricate \"Ponto De Vista\") but who sounds pretty drippy on his own. Lastly, there's a guy named Ze Luis, who's also kind of blah. This is okay in a time-capsule kind of way, worth listening to if you're digging deep into '60s Brazil, even though this set sounds kind of dated for '68. You don't have to knock yourself out tracking this disc down, although a handful of tracks are fun.\n\nVarious Artists \"MUSIQUE DU NORDESTE v. 1: 1916-1945\" (Buda Music/France, 1999)\n\nVarious Artists \"MUSIQUE DU NORDESTE v. 2: 1928-1946\" (Buda Music/France, 1999)\n\nTwo stunning CDs of distinctive and primordial music from the Northeastern states, including some of the earliest forro classics. This series is very similar to the Fremeaux collections listed above, though if anything, it digs a bit deeper, and has a stronger regional flavor. Most folks will enjoy the second disc more -- its melodies are more modern and gentle, whereas the first disc is a little starker and has a close affinity to the style of Portuguese fados and ballads found on the Heritage label. Featuring long-lost artists such as Luperce Miranda, Joao Pernambuco, Irmaos Valenca and -- of course -- forro founding father, Luiz Gonzaga. Highly recommended!\n\nMario Lago/Various Artists \"NADA ALEM\" (Som Livre, 1991)\n\nGuest performers abound in this heartfelt tribute to velha guarda poet-actor-songwriter Mario Lago, whose professional career began in the 1930s, when samba cancao stars such as Atualfo Alves, Carmen Miranda, Mario Reis and Orlando Silva recorded his early hits. The songs have a very distinctive feel to them; Lago certainly had a \"sound,\" which I suppose could be typified as not-too-lachrymose saudade, a romantic sense of longing and sadness... Although Lago is pictured on the album cover, I don't think he actually performs on the disc -- no matter, with elegant performances by Gal Costa, Paulinho Da Viola, Nelson Goncalves, Ivone Lara and Raphael Rabello, this tribute disc has its share of talent... Most of the arrangements are cheesy, but some are real gems, particularly Costa's reading of the title track, \"Nada Alem.\"\n\nVarious Artists \"NANDE REKO ARANDU: MEMORIA VIVA GUARANI\" (MCD Music World, 2000)\n\nContemporary composers take the music of the Guarani Indians into modern studios, giving the indigenous culture of the Amazon jungle a modern facelift in this intriguing set of tunes, sung by a children's chorus atop sleek modern arrangements... I had expected this album would either be filled with tacky \"remixes\" or it would be a set of dry, shrill field recordings. As it turns out, it's neither: the production sounds quite clean, and the songs are surprisingly listenable. The basic beat remains quite static -- a light, simple thump-thump-thump-thump on all the tunes-- and the melodies aren't terribly complex, yet there's a simplicity and sincerity to the project that comes through on the recordings, and even though it's not super-groovy or mind-blowingly rapturous, it's kind of sweet and compelling. Worth checking out, though you have to be in the right frame of mind.\n\nVarious Artists \"NA ONDE DO IE-IE-IE v. 1\" (EMI/Copacabana, 2000)\n\nVarious Artists \"NA ONDE DO IE-IE-IE v. 2\" (EMI/Copacabana, 2000)\n\nTwo excellent 2-CD sets of some of the best early-60s jovem guarda teenybopper rock. Other collections, particularly those on Polygram, tend to be a bit tepid, although these are packed with the chirpiness and spunk I was hoping for. If you want to check out the pre-tropicalia teen scene, with all its Fabian 'n' Funicello-esque charm, this is the collection I would recommend. Sure, it's not earth-shattering or Elvis, but these recordings are still fun and cute.\n\nVarious Artists \"NAQUELE TEMPO\" (Som Livre, 2004)\n\nA budget-line 4-CD set looking back at the good old days of the \"radio singers\" era... This collection bridges over several different record labels, and includes well-known artists such as Elizeth Cardoso, Vincente Celestino, Nelson Goncalves, Dick Farney, Angela Maria, Nora Ney, Cauby Peixoto and Orlando Silvam, as well as a slew of less-well remembered old-schoolers -- Wilma Bentivegna, Juca Chaves, Conjunto Farroupilha, Leny Eversong, Fernanda, Elza Laranjeira, Helena Lima, Rosana Toledo, and others. By and large, the song selection is not the strongest... it tilts towards the florid and overblown, and while I haven't heard tons of this old stuff, I'm sure a stronger set could have been compiled. Still, it's a valuable glimpse back into the pre-bossa nova olden days, and even if many of these artists were second- and third-stringers, it's nice to be able to hear their work.\n\nPixinguinha/Various Artists \"NAQUELE TEMPO: CHOROS E VALSAS\" (Revivendo, 1998)\n\nWartime and postwar chororecordings featuring duets with Pixinguinha and flautist Benedito Lacerda, as well as other choro and valsa stars, such as Custodio Mesquita and the legendary pre-bossa nova guitarist, Garoto. A great deal of the old-world gentility of the style is preserved in these recordings, which were made well after the style's real heyday in the 1920s, with the delicate society band fragility of the music fully intact. It's also easier to parse the music out, as these later renditions also have superior sound quality to the rollicking originals... Also of interest is the Hawaiian-style slide guitar employed by Garoto on several tracks made in the mid-'40s. Great stuff... Highly recommended!\n\nVarious Artists \"NATIVE BRAZILIAN MUSIC, v.1 (Columbia, 1942) (78 RPM album)\n\nOne of the great \"lost\" classics of world music history, these two folios of 78s -- a total of seventeen songs on eight discs -- are the only official U.S. release (to date) of a legendary recording session staged by classical music conductor Leopold Stokowski during a 1940 \"good neighbor policy\" trip to Brazil. Stokowski was an self-professed fan of Brazilian music and asked his colleague, composer Heitor Villa-Lobos, to invite some of the best local musicians he could find to take part in the session. And what a lineup he got! Onhand were choro and samba legends such as Cartola, Donga, Luiz Americano, Pixinguinha, Joao do Bahiana, Ze Espinguela, Ze da Zilda and other elite members of the classic early samba schools. This two-part collection represents only about half the forty tracks Stokowski recorded -- the other songs are apparently still in the Sony vaults, awaiting the day when the label will give them a proper digital-age release. Music scholar Daniella Thompson has led a fifteen-year effort of track the masters down and persuade the folks at Sony to reissue these songs (including the twenty-three unreleased tracks). Here's a link to an article she wrote about her quest as well as a petition on the Sony Legacy website, urging them to open their vaults.\n\nVarious Artists \"NATIVE BRAZILIAN MUSIC, v.2\" (Columbia, 1942) (78 RPM album)\n\nVarious Artists \"NATIVE BRAZILIAN MUSIC\" (MVL, 1987) (LP)\n\nThis was a Brazilian-edition LP, mastered from existing 78s from the original release. (Apparently the masters do still exist, they're just buried away somewhere up the the US...)\n\nVarious Artists \"NICOLA CONTE PRESENTS: VIAGEM, v.1 (FarOut Records, 2008)\n\nVarious Artists \"NICOLA CONTE PRESENTS: VIAGEM, v.2 (FarOut Records, 2009)\n\nVarious Artists \"NICOLA CONTE PRESENTS: VIAGEM, v.3 (FarOut Records, 2011)\n\nVarious Artists \"NICOLA CONTE PRESENTS: VIAGEM, v.4 (FarOut Records, 2012)\n\nVarious Artists \"NICOLA CONTE PRESENTS: VIAGEM, v.5 (FarOut Records, 2013)\n\nJair Rodrigues/Various Artists \"OBA OBA '84\" (Maracana, 1985)\n\n(Produced by Gianni Daldello)\n\n(Artistic directors: Franco Fontana & Luzie Mathias)\n\nThis was one of a series of albums commemorating, I believe, a European carnaval show (held annually in Italy? anyone know more about it?) that brought Brazilian artists to the Continent. Jair Rodrigues seems to have been the headliner in '84, with Chico Buarque singing on one song and bandolim virtuosa Nilze Carvalho playing a couple of beautiful tunes. The spotlight was really on vocalist Eliana Estevao, though: she sings several duets with Rodrigues and with Buarque, as well as one solo... She's got an okay voice, and I'm guessing she was part of Rodrigues's stage show at the time. The arrangements are generally pretty cheesy -- standard-issue, synth-heavy soft-jazz/funk MPB typical of the era... Side Two of the album is taken up with a gigantic potpourri medley of the kind Rodrigues all-too-often indulged in... He also sings a couple of solo songs, though his vocals are kind of inconsistent, especially on the fast-paced medley track.\n\nVarious Artists \"O CAFONA (Soundtrack)\" (Som Livre, 1971/2001)\n\nSee, if I were more thoroughly attuned to the whole '60s-soundtrack kitsch factor, I would probably \"get\" stuff like this and seem much cooler than I do. And sure, this soap opera soundtrack has its moments, mainly in an early Tim Maia funk/early '70s soft pop vein, but it's also a bit facile and musically unformed. The artists involved are mainly second-and-third stringers, with Carlos Lyra towards the top and numerous others holding up the lower rungs... But if you're already into the whole Italian & French sleazy-listening scene, then this Brazilian material should appeal to you as well... Recommended, sort of, even though it's not really my cuppa tea. This disc is part of a series of twenty soundtrack albums reissued in by Som Livre in an overview of many of Brazil's best TV programs.\n\nVarious Artists \"OI! A NOVA MUSICA BRASILEIRA\" (Mais Um Discos, 2010)\n\nA far-reaching, 2-CD sampler of modern Brazilian music, much of it with heavy pop, rock and electronica influences... I haven't heard this one yet, but look forward to checking it out!\n\nVarious Artists \"PHONO 73: O CANTO DE UM POVO\" (CD & DVD) (Universal Music, 2005)\n\nThis 2-CD/1 DVD collection is a remarkable document of an incredible concert, held in 1973 at the Palacio do Anhembi, with superstars such as Jorge Ben, Maria Bethania, Chico Buarque, Gal Costa, Gilberto Gil, Nara Leao, Ivan Lins, Elis Regina, Jair Rodrigues, Sergio Sampaiao, Raul Seixas, Caetano Veloso, Toquinho & Vinicius De Moraes (and others) all performing in protest of the cultural bans of the military dictatorship then in power. It was an amazing festival, packed with Brazil's top talent. Along with the two discs of live music is a trove of film clips taken from various performances - the footage is fragmentary and poorly edited (tragically so) but utterly compelling, an absolute must-see movie for fans of this era of Brazilian pop. These are the giants of the era, many of them at their youthful peak. Jorge Ben is electrifying; Gilberto Gil is a playful god; Chico Buarque is arresting though remote (plus you get to see him play a faux-rock song!); Caetano Veloso (singing his revival of the forro classic, \"Asa Branca\") is at his artiest, most elfin and most indulgent. One of the wildest performances is by rocker Raul Seixas, who blasts through American rock oldies like \"Tutti Frutti\" and his own crazy Brazilian hard-rock adaptations and his glam-rock persona is intense: you have to see it to believe it. The video content is frustrating but crucial, particularly since there isn't much footage like it to be seen anywhere today... It would be wonderful to see more complete versions of these performances (or anything of similar vintage) but I'm glad I got a chance to see the material that's on here. It's super-cool stuff.\n\nVarious Artists \"POSICOES\" (Odeon, 1971)\n\nMercifully short, this compilation EP explored the fringier fringes of Brazilian experimental rock -- a real find for freak-folk fans, but pretty wanky and irritating for the rest of us. This disc includes four bands: A Tribo was a short-lived supergroup that included Nelson Angelo, Joyce, Toninho Horta and Nana Vasconcelos, as well as Novelli... This disc includes two songs, \"Kyrie\" and \"Peba E Pobo,\" from A Tribo's lone release, a double single which also contained two other songs. Also on here are the psychedelic band Modulo 1000 (two songs also included on the CD reissue of their legendary album), the fusion-y Som Imaginario and a rock band called Equipe Mercado. It's all weird stuff, but hard to get into, at least for those of us who are not on drugs. Probably for a lot of you who are, as well. But a historical curio, for sure!\n\nVarious Artists \"PRAZER EM CONHECA-LO\" (Funarte, 1986)\n\n(Produced by Cristovao Bastos)\n\nAn homage to composer/pianist Custodio Mesquita... A cheerful, if somewhat goofy set, with theatrical, almost vaudevillian arrangements, and vocals by Amelia Rabello, Marcos Sacramento and old-timers Marlene and Rosana Toledo, with piano backing from producer Cristovao Bastos (who also contributes a lovely instrumental version of \"Enquanto Houver Saudade\") This didn't completely curl my toes, although there are a couple of songs that really stood out. Definitely worth checking out if you're into the swankier side of modern MPB (from artists such as Maria Bethania and Nana Caymmi, for example...) The title track was apparently written by samba-cancao legend Noel Rosa.\n\nVarious Artists \"LES PRECURSEURS DE LA BOSSA NOVA: 1948-1957\" (Fremeaux & Associes, 2008)\n\nThe history of Brazilian popular music is often seen to hinge on the release of a single song, Joao Gilberto's transcendent, revolutionary \"Chega De Saudade,\" a gentle, intoxicating ditty written by Tom Jobim that made bossa nova the new national music of Brazil, back in 1958, when it came out as a single. But like any other country, Brazil's cultural history is complex and multi-layered and obviously Gilberto and Jobim didn't just come out of nowhere. This magnificent 2-CD set -- compiled by the ever-fab French archival label, Fremeaux -- documents the many crosscurrents and interconnections that set the stage for bossa nova to explode in the late 1950s, first in Brazil and then across the globe. Both Jobim and Gilberto had long careers in the years before their ascent into the heavens: many of the rare tracks gathered here show their early work with other artists, including early versions of Jobim songs performed by the stars of the 1950's \"radio singers\" era, while other tracks feature Gilberto backing famous singers or, similarly, show Jobim acting as bandleader on various sessions. At some point, their paths collided, and Gilberto (for a while) became Jobim's voice, while Jobim was Gilberto's muse. Although \"Chega De Saudade\" is seen as the song that sparked a musical revolution, there are several other songs and albums that are considered \"the first bossa nova record,\" chief among these is perhaps the 1957 album Cancao Do Amor Demais, where Joao Gilberto backed romantic singer Elizete Cardoso on a series of newly-minted bossa classics. (The results are mixed: while the album was Gilberto's first big break, Cardoso is a pretty old-fashioned, corny singer... I've never been that fond of the record; turns out Gilberto didn't like it that much, either...) Bossa nova was a distillation of many trends in Brazilian music -- classic samba-cancao, the romanticism of boleros, and the influence of cool, melodic jazz and American-style pop vocals taken up by singers such as Dick Farney and Johnny Alf. Also gathered here are fabled pre-bossa artists such as guitarist Garoto (one of Joao Gilberto's idols) and his group Trio Surdina, as well as the vocal group Os Cariocas and divas and crooners such as Sylvia Telles, Doris Monteiro, Lucio Alves and Tito Madi... Even in this golden era of digital reissues, the songs on this collection remain hard to find and expensive to own, so having them all together in such as compact, well-curated collection is a rare treat indeed. Highly recommended -- a great way to explore deeper into the history of Brazilian popular song.\n\nVarious Artists \"PROIBIDO C.V. -- FORBIDDEN GANG FUNK FROM RIO DE JANEIRO\" (Sublime Frequencies, 2007)\n\nVarious Artists \"PUTUMAYO PRESENTS: ACOUSTIC BRAZIL\" (Putumayo, 2005)\n\nThis is a swell album of pretty-sounding acoustic tunes running the gamut from superstars such as Chico Buarque, Gal Costa and Caetano Veloso to less well-known newcomers like Marcio Faracao and Glaucia Nasser. The collection is very well selected and has a nice, cohesive feel, tuning into the prettiest, most delicate aspects of Brazil's samba and bossa traditions. Highlights include magical tunes by up-and-coming stars such as samba singer Tesesa Cristina, and surprisingly soft contributions by rockers like Lucas Santtana. This is a record that lovers of Brazilian music will enjoy, and that they can give to folks who aren't already familiar with the styles... It's very listenable and mellow, but it also has a real emotional and stylistic depth... It's a very nice set. Recommended.\n\nVarious Artists \"PUTUMAYO PRESENTS: BOSSA NOVA AROUND THE WORLD\" (Putumayo, 2011)\n\nA nice mellow set of neo-bossa nova from all across the world -- from Brazil (of course), Canada, Cape Verde, Mexico and even Norway and Serbia (where they probably really need the sunny vibes...) There are several tracks by French artists -- that nouvelle scene is still going strong, and very bossa-friendly -- although sadly nothing by Japanese guitarist Lisa Ono, who is an icon of non-Brazilian bossa worship. As with the best of these various-artist outings, this introduces listeners to several previously unknown artists; for me perhaps the biggest discovery was the German indie/agitpop duo, 2raumwohnung, who apparently have several really fun albums out. Time for a trip to the old Record Hut to track a couple down! Overall, another nice set from the folks at Putumayo -- didn't blow my mind, but it sure sounds nice on the stereo.\n\nVarious Artists \"PUTUMAYO PRESENTS: BRASILEIRO\" (Putumayo, 1999)\n\nA very nice collection, emphasizing sweeter, melodically-oriented tunes. Features a nice selection of tunes by big-name stars -- Jorge Ben, Clara Nunes, Joao Bosco, Beth Carvalho -- as well as several newer or lesser known artists such as Celso Machado and Nazare Pereira. In addition to sounding all-around nice, this collection has great liner notes... a welcome antidote to the normal dearth of information on Brazilian imports. One of several recent Putamayo releases pointing towards a new vigor in their song selection.\n\nVarious Artists \"PUTUMAYO PRESENTS: BRAZILIAN CAFE\" (Putumayo, 2009)\n\n(Various Producers)\n\nA mellow, acoustic-oriented set of modern Brazilian ballads. For the most part this is a collection of less well-known artists, which I personally appreciate. The album kicks off with a relatively restrained track by the MPB superstar Djavan, but after that the next most famous artist is guitarist-vocalist Rosa Passos. All the tracks are quite nice, and this is another wonderfully listenable collection from Putumayo, not gooey or cloying crossover stuff, but a rather classy collection that knowledgeably explores the contemporary Brazilian acoustic scene. The current trad-samba revival is represented by Teresa Cristina and Ana Costa (two great artists whose work is well worth tracking down) while more pop and bossa-oriented music is also well represented. Nice record; definitely worth a spin!\n\nVarious Artists \"PUTUMAYO PRESENTS: BRAZILIAN LOUNGE\" (Putumayo, 2006)\n\nNice...! A really beautiful set of mellow, modern bossa-electronica-samba crossovers, easy on the ears yet musically rich and spiritually fulfilling. There are plenty of heavy-hitters on here, including bossa elder Marcos Valle, Bebel Gilberto, Paula Morelenbaum (of the Jobim-Morelenbaum Quartet), manguebeat heroes Mundo Livre S/A (in a pleasantly mellow mood) and several hot younger artists such as Bossacucanova, BiD and the uber-mellow Katia B, as well as several fine artists I'd never heard of before (but will look into soon!). From start to finish, this is a well-programmed, revelatory set, relaxing but not somnambulent... It's one of those discs that wound up stuck in my stereo for a lot longer than I'd expected, getting played over and over, while delivering the goods every time. Recommended!\n\nVarious Artists \"PUTUMAYO PRESENTS: SAMBA BOSSA NOVA\" (Putumayo, 2002)\n\nPutumayo scores another hit with this excellent collection of sleek modern balladeers and Brazilian pop innovators... Included are Da Lata, Rossa Passos, Jussara Silveira, Rita Ribero, and my personal hero, Moreno Veloso (the son of the great Caetano Veloso). There are also several less well known artists on here, but the level of quality is consistently very high. This is a really nice, really listenable album... Highly recommended for anyone who wants to check out some more recent Brazilian material.\n\nVarious Artists \"QUARTIN\" (Far Out Records, 1997)\n\nMusic from Roberto Quartin's early-'70s jazz-oriented Quartin label... A little too jazz-oriented for my tastes... This disc includes a few tracks off Jose Mauro's excellent Obnoxius album, and some interesting instrumentals by guitarist Piri (backed up by Wilson Das Neves and a young Danilo Caymmi) ... Unfortunately, it also contains most of the tracks off of an instrumental jazz Jobim tribute album by alto sax player Victor Assis Brasil, every one of which I found to be tedious -- a braz-jazz cross between Charlie Parker and Kenny G, perhaps. I was able to part with this disc without much sorrow, especially considering the entire Mauro album is also available as a reissue.\n\nVarious Artists \"RACA BRASILEIRA\" (Som Livre, 1985)\n\nA nice, solid modern samba album, featuring the likes of Zeca Pagodinho and Jovelina Perola Negra. Not mind-blowing but catchy and pleasant. Recommended.\n\nVarious Artists \"RED HOT + LISBON: ONDA SONORA\" (Bar None Records, 1999)\n\nWow! Another winner in the \"Red Hot\" AIDS charity series. This follow-up to RED HOT AND RIO focuses on contemporary Portuguese pop, but the influences are overwhelmingly Brazilian. The highlight here is a bilingual duet between David Byrne and Caetano Veloso (who, as it turns out, have very similar voices...) Lisbon's sizable immigrant community is represented by several interesting traces of African traditional and pop music, including a collaboration between Angola's pop legend, Bonga, and Brazil's Marisa Monte and Carlinhos Brown. There are also heavy doses of club and ambient electronica. Some of these efforts are fluid and seductive; others are disappointing. In particular, the talents of DJ Spooky seem poorly utilized, and the lusophone rap of General D is predictably lackluster (he's no MC Solaar); probably the worst track on here is an insufferable fado by the ever-schmaltzy k.d. lang. Overall, though, this is an excellent album, well worth checking out. New to me: Smoke City, who are sort of a Portuguese Portsihead. Recommended!\n\nVarious Artists \"RED HOT AND RIO\" (Verve Antilles, 1996)\n\nAn ambitious and often lovely mix of Jobim standards with modern production and styles. Heavyweights such as Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, etc. team up with various U.S. hipsters, soul singers and rappers, to varying degrees of success. Everything But The Girl's version of \"Corcovado,\" David Byrne's duet with Marisa Monte or Stereolab teamed up with Herbie Mann are among the highlights. The efforts of \"quiet storm\" soul singers such as Maxwell and Incognito are less satisfying, though I'm sure their fans will appreciate them. Overall, this is a nice, far-reaching effort, very much in the spirit of experimentation and inclusion which makes MPB so exciting to begin with. (PS - this disc is a benefit for AIDS research, for the Red Hot foundation.)\n\nVarious Artists \"RED HOT AND RIO 2:\" (Entertainment One, 2011)\n\nAn impressive lineup of indie/pop/electronic artists step up for this tribute to the wild, eclectic Brazilian tropicalia scene of the 1960s and early '70s. Many of the original tropicalistas are on board as well, notably Caetano Veloso, Tom Ze, Rita Lee and the recently-reformed Os Mutantes. They inspire and interact with an avalanche of modern talent, including non-Brazilian hipsters like Beck, Of Montreal, Alice Smith, Mia Doi Todd (and numerous electronica artists) as well as younger Brazilian stars, such as Apollo Nove, Ceu, Bebel Gilberto, Seu Jorge, Curumin, Vanesa de Mata and others... Presiding as elders over this great cross-cultural confluence are Caetano Veloso (whose cosmic, ambient \"3 Mellowtrons In A Quiet Room\" update of \"Terra\" is an album highlight) and his longtime friend David Byrne, whose expansive, enthusiastic \"Brazil Classics\" series sparked popular interest in a wide variety of Brazilian styles back in the '80s and '90s: they do a groovy duet on \"Dreamworld/Marco De Canaveses,\" while numerous artists cover Veloso's work. High marks go to Marisa Monte (always a fave) for her version of \"Nu Com A Minha Musica,\" Superhuman Happiness for their electro-JPop take on \"Ile Aye,\" and Curumin, who really nails it on his reggaefied version of Gilberto Gil's \"Ela.\" Marisa Monte contributes a typically gorgeous performance on \"Nu Com A Minha Musica\" (a duet with Devendra Banhart) and Mia Doi Todd's contributions are also pretty solid. Not all of this 2-CD set appealed to me -- the stuff on the more electronic and R&B end of the spectrum wasn't my cup of tea (particularly John Legend's jazzy, well-intentioned \"Love I've Never Known\") but hey, variety is the spice of life, as the tropicalistas cheerfully taught us, lo those many decades past. Some cool stuff on here, with a little bit of something for everyone. Worth a spin!\n\nVarious Artists \"AS REVELACOES DA GRANDE CHANCE, v.2\" (Codil Ritmos, 1968) (LP)\n\nAn album commemorating the second \"Grande Chance\" competition hosted by TV Tupi, a talent show modeled after the popular \"song contests\" of the time, but concentrating solely on unknown artists. In this case, most of the artists were (and deservedly remain) really obscure, awkwardly performing romantic ballads and covers of current bossa hits and, in one case, a rock cover of the Peter Gunn TV theme. Nonetheless, the contestant who wound up winning became a genuine star and a champion of the roots-samba scene of the 1970s and '80s: singer Leci Brandao (credited as \"Lecy\" on the track listings) belts out an upbeat urban samba called \"Riqueza, Pobreza,\" kind of in the style of Leny Andrade or Elza Soares. It's not a great record, but it's an interesting snapshot of the time, and hearing the youthful Brandao in '68 is cool. Also, I think the Fabiola who sings \"Januaria\" is the same guy who later on recorded some interesting psychedelic stuff, so that's of interest as well.\n\nVarious Artists \"RIO BAILE FUNK: FAVELA BOOTY BEATS\" (Essay Records, 2004)\n\nA groovy, well-programmed collection of Brazilian party music, lively stuff that springs from a Brazilian fascination with the \"Miami bass\" style of dance/hip-hop music... As heard here, the insistent, often obnoxious baile funk doesn't always highlight the heavy low end of its Miami-based ancestors, but it does share a gleeful sense of hedonism, frivolity and abandon. This disc is a slick mix of no-brainer dancefloor favorites by artists such as Dennis DJ, Furacao 2000, MC Jack and others; although its hardly in the Brazilian pop mainstream, the baile funk scene had an explosive growth in the 1980s and '90s, fronting huge, rave-like dance parties amid monstrously large sound systems. As described in the album's liner notes, the scene fell prey to incidental violence and for a time the dances were legally procribed following a few notably disasterous shows. Still, it's hard to imagine such a spunky sound being kept down for long: I'm hardly a fan of club culture, dance music or 'lectro beats, but this is a fun album, with spazzy sampled beats, kooky, rapid-fire lyrics (often sampled and manipulated) that are more like rally chants than rapping or dancehall... The superfast, dat-datdat-daadad-dah beat somehow, miraculously falls short of simple monotony, and the whole effect is rather giddy and captivating. It's hardly your typical Brazilian pop, but it's definitely worth checking out.\n\nVarious Artists \"RIO BAILE FUNK: MORE FAVELA BOOTY BEATS\" (Essay Records, 2006)\n\nVarious Artists \"RODA DE SAMBA DE PARTIDO ALTO\" (Cedro Rosa, 2009)\n\n(Produced by Virginia Carvalho)\n\nFour younger artists -- backed by a cast of thousands -- recreate the funky, joyful vibe of the classic \"partido de alto\" albums of the roots-samba revival of the 1960s and '70s. Led by percussion and cavaquinho, singers Maquinhos China, Renatinho Partideiro, Serginho Procopio and Tiago Mocoto move jovially through a set of songs that recall the heyday of bands such as Os Originais do Samba, with surprisingly little in the way of modern, contemporary musical ornamentation. If you like the old style sound, you might really enjoy this loose, funky album.\n\nVarious Artists \"ROUGH GUIDE TO BRAZILIAN ELECTRONICA\" (Rough Guides, 2003)\n\nNice collection! The automatic compatibility of Brazilian bossa and samba with modern electronica has been taken as a given for many years, but the easy assumptions of many mixers -- particularly DJs in the European acid jazz/lounge/dance music cliques -- have not always borne the synthesis out. This collection stands out amidst the many bland \"Brazilian\" chill out discs, highlighting several artists with a genuine feel for Brazilian grooves and more to offer than the same old drum'n'bass sound and formless ambient meanderings. Interesting, creative stuff... well worth checking out, particularly as it will lead you to several of Brazil's more innovative modern artists, such as Fernanda Porto, Rebeca Matta and Ramiro Musotto. Recommended!\n\nVarious Artists \"ROLE: NOVOS SONS DO BRAZIL\" (Mais Um Discos, 2014)\n\nVarious Artists \"ROUGH GUIDE TO BRAZILIAN MUSIC\" (Rough Guides, 1998)\n\nAn odd, interesting mix of mainly modern musicians and styles. Not quite the sweeping overview the title might imply, but still a very interesting set. There are a few familiar names, such as Ivan Lins and Dominguinhos, but for the most part this disc is packed with artists that I had not previously heard of (and I'm reviewing this disc in 2003, so these songs, culled from the Pau Brasil, Velas and Atracao labels, is definitely off the beaten track."
