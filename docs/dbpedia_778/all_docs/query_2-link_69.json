        "text": "It seems like Camden’s version of Thinkpol has the reverse mission to Orwell’s original. Vaughan jokes, “We sound like Scientologists! It sounds like a cult!” In fact it’s more of a creative collective. “At the moment it’s based around NED, then we’re gonna branch out. Eventually we’ll bring more bands on the roster and expand it.” It is clear that everyone present in the room gets the creative buzz.\n\nRob, sat on the drum kit’s stool, jumps in: “I stayed over last night and during that time we achieved so much more than we would normally achieve during a week. It’s weird what energy does. We were doing a video till 3am yesterday and we cracked on with it when we woke up. Energy is contagious; it comes when you’re really working towards something.”\n\nIt certainly seems like energy was what brought them all together. Vaughan remembers the exact night. “I was playing a gig in Kilburn on my own, some of the NED stuff, like ‘Mass Manipulation’. I played on a banjo, but with loads of distortion, it was a bit of a crazy set. And Nicole came down. I must’ve played about a thousand gigs by then and she’d pretty much come to about 995 of them. And after that one I said ‘I don’t really fancy playing on my own. I just don’t like that, I don’t mind it, I can do it sometimes, but I like the feeling of being in a band, collaborating, being creative with people’. And out of the blue she just said ‘you need a beat, that’s all you need. I could just kick a foot drum for you, that’s all I’d do.’ I was shocked because she’s not at all a performer! The next day she bought that drum kit” - Vaughan points to the kit in the room. - “I came home and it was here!”\n\nThey started to play gigs together as a two-piece and originally that’s what they wanted to be. They grew thanks to Vaughan’s other band, Dirt Diggers. “They’re all amazing musicians; they’ve all done it for years, so it’s quite an established band in terms of our musical ability. My guitarist heard NED as a two-piece, he loved it, he wanted in”, Vaughan explains.\n\nThe official launch of NED’s debut album ‘A New Normal’ is taking place on the 19th July at The Wilmington Arms in Islington. Keith’s artwork, combined with the lyrics and videos released to date, seem to suggest there’s a pretty well thought through concept behind it all, however ‘concept’ is the word that Vaughan doesn’t associate with NED. “Every time I hear it I think of Emerson Lake and Palmer, you know?”, he laughs. He wouldn’t call ‘A New Normal’ a concept album, however he admits there is a running theme behind each song. “It’s basically how I view society by living and working in London. As a nation we accept all the changes that are happening right now. Even when our train ticket prices are being increased every second week of January we accept it and we move on. We live in a society where inflation is rising but no one’s wages are going up... it all becomes the new normal. The whole record is about questioning all these things. Maybe it will make some people pay attention...” He’s not interested in making NED a political force, but he’s clearly passionate making a statement.\n\nWith 2000trees having made itself THE festival for underground British music over the last few years it was perhaps inevitable that a sister event would have to spring up at some point, if only to make sure all the great bands had somewhere to play. Co-founder of both events, Simon Maltas, spoke to us about the festival's forthcoming debut this August.\n\n(((o))): Tell us a bit about yourselves - what's your background in festival planning and how did ArcTanGent come about?\n\nWell we started out in 2006 or 2007 simply as festival goers. We all had full time jobs but we were sick of going to and getting ripped off at some of the bigger festivals. It sounds like a cliché, or like I'm making it up, but the six of us were just sat around in our campsite at one of those massive festivals one night & we simply decided to start our own.\n\nA week or so later, slightly more sober, we decided we'd give it a bash and 2000trees was born! It was a very DIY process in the early days. We had to learn everything from scratch all the way from getting alcohol licenses, to event management and we even trained up as security guards! It was a massively steep learning curve, but it's been a great ride so far. Six years on, we're ready to launch the next event on the world! Now two of us (James and I) do this full time!\n\n(((o))): On a similar note, given that you already run 2000 Trees and Gocstock, what on earth possessed you to start another festival?!\n\nWell ArcTanGent came about because we still passionately believe that smaller festivals are way better and 2000trees is (in our mind) about the perfect size at 5,000 people. So rather than grow 2000trees and potentially lose some of the things that make it special (like its small and friendly atmosphere), we'd start another one and spread the love to Bristol! Bristol has an amazing music scene already. Loads of great 1 day, city-centre based events, but not an abundance of 3 day camping based festivals out in the surrounding countryside. Except Glasto obviously.\n\nWe also wanted to do something slightly different musically. It won't surprise you to learn that we're massive music fans at heart, especially James who books all our bands. Band wise 2000trees has a little bit of something for everyone and prides itself on finding new underground British music. ArcTanGent, on the other hand, is the first UK festival to book a line up focussed primarily on post-rock, math-rock and the weirder elements of our musical tastes. We joked originally that it was the sort of music you could watch while stroking your beard. If you don't have a beard, then ask someone else if you can stroke theirs :)\n\n(((o))): None of the bands on your line-up would be particularly out of place at 2000 Trees; is your aim to create something a bit more \"niche\", or will this also mark a change in musical direction for 2000 Trees - are you trying to separate out the styles a bit?\n\nDefinitely the first one, we've kicked the niche vibe around between us a lot, so it's great that you've picked up on that! Because there is a dedicated fanbase out there for this type of music that we felt wasn't really being catered for, we figured ArcTanGent could definitely fill that void. You will see some of these bands at other festivals but ArcTanGent is the only one where they are all in one place. For instance a couple of these bands would work well on The Cave stage (our heavier stage) at 2000trees, but it's obviously important for both festivals to retain a separate identity. 2000trees as I said above is a little bit of something awesome for everyone. ArcTanGent is aiming to be all awesome, all the time.... just as long as you're into that type of music!\n\n(((o))): For the debut year of a festival, the line-up is absolutely stellar! How have you managed that? Is it through contacts you've built up, favours you've pulled in or is it just that bands were really keen to play?\n\nWell that's all down to James, who books all our bands at both festivals. He has obviously made a load of contacts after 7 years at 2000trees, but really it all boils down to the fact that he knew who he wanted to book, and he just picked up the phone. He spends a hell of a lot of his time planning on who to book, and he's already drawing up some amazing bands for next year... including some from overseas! Next year is going to be even better!\n\nI also think once he floated the concept of the festival and the line up to all the bands/ agents it soon became clear that the bands themselves are big fans of the rest of the line up, so were all pretty up for playing. We're still getting loads of bands banging on our door asking to be added to the bill!\n\n(((o))): A number of the bands on your line-up are getting quite a lot of buzz at the moment (Tall Ships, ASIWYFA, TTNG to name but a few) but ArcTanGent is the first festival really to pull all these bands together in the same place - in some ways it's surprising it hasn't happened already. Was that one of the reasons you decided to put this festival together?\n\nYeah definitely. Personally speaking, this type of music is what I spend most of my time listening to at the moment... There's so much good stuff out there! So we simply figured there must be loads of other music fans who would love to see a whole weekend of these types of bands. It's been great, thanks to James and a lot of our partners; (Musical Mathematics, DIY, Fear of Fiction to name just a few), I've discovered so many new amazing bands in the last 6 months that I probably wouldn't have found on my own. So even for me it's expanded my musical horizons... something which is an awesome perk of the job!\n\n(((o))): I think everyone agrees that the UK festival scene is absolutely saturated at the moment. What, for you, makes a festival really stand out from the crowd? What plans do you have to make ArcTanGent different?\n\nWell, first and foremost as you've probably gathered number one is the bands, but as cheesy as it sounds, we honestly just want to make the best weekend possible for the punters. It kills me every year, that the one festival I'd love to attend as a punter would be 2000trees - but as it's still very DIY, we're too busy to sit on the grass with a cider and watch bands at our own festival.\n\nAs I am the licensee and bar/ food traders manager I would also say a massive part of what makes a festival great is properly decent bars and food traders. I spend so much of my time sourcing the best food traders possible from all the street food markets... you won't find any old festival food at ArcTanGent or 2000trees. We have our own onsite smokery for goodness sake! My favourite bit is obviously the bars though... what can I say? All local, all reasonably priced and all amazing tasting! No giant brewery/ mediocre pints in sight. This year we'll have Cotswold Lager, Bath Ales and some extra special local cider & perry options. Perfect for sipping in the sunshine and watching your favourite bands.\n\n(((o))): What are the best and worst parts of festival planning? Will you actually get to see any of the event itself, or will you spend the entire weekend running around problem solving?\n\nHa - yeah unfortunately the latter. Especially in year one! Having said that we know what we're doing now. In year 1 of 2000trees I think we had about 3 hours sleep a night. I reckon this year we'll be able to catch a few bands (even if it's just for a couple of songs).\n\nBest part... probably stood in front of the stage, or on the main stage looking out at 5,000 smiling people having an awesome weekend.... or afterwards seeing and hearing all the stories people post on facebook.\n\nWorst part... hmm i guess just the amount of planning that goes into one weekend! It takes up nearly 12 months our our year to properly nail it... a lot of my mates still think I sit in a hammock for most of the year! Having said that, if you were to ask me if we'd known then, what we know now, would we still have done it? Hell yeah! Beats being an accountant (no offence to accountants).\n\n(((o))): Are there any ArcTanGent surprises you have yet to pull out of the bag?\n\nYeah, there's a few for sure! The main stage is literally going to blow everyone's mind! I won't say too much more for now, but we think we're the only festival in the UK to have this stage as our main stage... it looks truly epic!\n\n(((o))): Who would be your absolute dream act to book for ArcTanGent? Who on the bill are you most looking forward to?\n\nJeez, such a tough question! James would say Mars Volta for sure... (Maybe one day if they reform).\n\nI would say some of the ace math rock bands from Japan, Toe or LITE just because I love a lot of the stuff coming out of Japan.... or this relatively unknown band from France called Pneu. They're pretty obscure, but I really rate them because they just seem fairly mental. Then there's bands like Mogwai, Explosions in the Sky, Battles... I can't pick just one! Arrrggh!\n\nWho am I most looking forward to? Again so tough! They are all brilliant... but probably Bo Ningen, Maybeshewill, Blacklisters, Arcane Roots, & The St Pierre Snake Invasion. Oh and a band we saw in London the other week, who we've yet to announce. They will seriously blow your mind!!! :)\n\n(((o))): Finally, if there's one reason our readers should get up & buy an ArcTanGent ticket, what would it be?\n\nBecause you won't get such an amazing line up, and altogether awesome weekend for that price (£59) anywhere else in the known universe... and if you don't we'll have to go and get a proper job, and no one wants that :)\n\nSee you at the bar!\n\nSi\n\nArcTanGent takes place at Fernhill Farm, Compton Martin, near Bristol. Tickets are available now from £59. Bargain - see you all there! We can't wait.\n\nSee that happy little Viking? His name is Vincent and, for a short time, he lived in a trash can. You can find him on watches, iPhone cases, stickers and tees, but more importantly he now lives on the records released on his creator's label, Hobbledehoy.\n\nOn a two hour train trip I began sketching Vincent for a comic idea that never came to fruition. It never went beyond that train trip actually. Now he’s the iconic figurehead of a label most people can’t pronounce… or remember what the company does. My marketing lecturers would be so proud!\n\nThat’s Tom Majerczac by the way. He’s the founder and owner of the Adelaide, South Australia based Hobbledehoy Records. Originally from Melbourne he moved to what is now colloquially known as Radelaide (can’t think why) and home to the best chicken yiros in Australia, but not before selling his less-than-immaculate 1987 Ford Laser and starting the label in 2006. Why did he do it?\n\nI want to support artists getting their music out how they want. By focusing on individual artists, developing them and not excessively releasing for the sake of a large catalogue I feel I can do that. So many great artists fade away that otherwise may have kept developing if they had that external support. That support comes from extensions of the label idea too. The other artists on the label will support them, as will likeminded artists elsewhere. This is all expressed in friendly cross promotion, touring together, advice, etc. The power of community is an important thing.\n\nAt a recent gig I observed to Tom that they were selling a lot of his records. He was quick to correct me; “Not mine, the bands’ records”.\n\nI run Hobbledehoy as a labour of love, flippantly calling it a full-time hobby… but that summarises things well. Increasingly spending more time on it outside of my full time day job, it’s a big part of my life. As time’s gone by, I’m becoming more fixed with the idea of working with my friends. The creation of the eighth Hobbledehoy record, ‘Modern Art & Politics’ by Arrows I think was the defining moment. I often romanticise this record, but it is very representative of a fundamental shift for both the band and Hobbledehoy. It hammered down many ideals/values that still guide me, steering away from the \"industry\" rubbish.\n\nThat focus on the music they love is one of the things we see time and time again from smaller labels. It’s the sort of thing that builds trust and reliability for music lovers. If you see a release from Pelagic, Prophecy or Bird’s Robe you know roughly what style of music it’s likely to be and that it will probably be good. One thing that varies is whether the label concentrates on its roster or looks at each release in relative isolation.\n\nI rarely make additions to the roster; my focus is on the artists not individual records. The first two records were by Adam Lees, performing under the name Oh Messy Life. Interestingly, Adam never intended to release his music. We created a plan that meant he could release his music how he wanted. I want to release music by my friends and heroes. Sometimes this can be surprisingly difficult to work within. Adelaide has some great bands, but it’s also very small. Eventually I’m sure there will be an Adelaide artist of some sort in the Hobbledehoy family.\n\nTom spends most of his spare time and time he should be sleeping working on the label. When a release is in the early stages he talks with the band about what they want – production, recording, mastering, artwork, manufacturing, promotion, distribution, touring, licencing… See why he gets no sleep?\n\nArrangements are all 50/50 profit splits between artists, artists owning masters. Hobbledehoy fronting manufacturing, marketing and sometimes additional costs such as mastering, press campaigns, merchandise, etc. One recent arrangement is the first time this has ever varied, with the band contributing to the manufacture cost for additional stock.\n\nAfter six years he’s had a bit of time to start reflecting on the lifestyle of running a label...\n\nStarting Hobbledehoy when I was 19 brought with it a lot of youthful assumptions. Bands don’t make as much money as you think, and neither do labels. So being completely transparent with your artists sales/expense accounts is highly valued, something many other independent labels won’t do. While it’s still a hobby, I wish I saw an accountant from the start! A lot of money and records have been lost from distributors (local and international) closing down. There have been some petty disputes with an inactive label in the past that has wasted many opportunities for an artist on the roster, which is really sad.\n\nObviously it’s not the champagne lifestyle. Surely there’s more to this than this not sleeping, not making money and shit loads of work? Of course there’s a fun side. Who could not have fun with Vincent smiling at you all the time?\n\nReleasing a couple of Blueline Medic records, my favourite Australian band; a Charge Group record, one of my favourite active Australian bands only just recently; working with This Will Destroy You on their latest record and touring with them; seeing Arrows build a fan base across the world, then having Parkway Drive ask to feature one of their songs in the latest DVD; touring Bob Nanna (Braid / Hey Mercedes) and releasing his solo record, only then to release records from his former bands too. All these things have been amazing, really they have.\n\nPhew, that’s better. How about some parting pearls?\n\nMy advice to anyone interested would be that nothing happens as you expect it would. So be adaptive and above all else, supportive to the artists you serve."
