        "text": "SOUND OF THE CITY\n\nIn the late 1950s, just as doo-wop began to fade, it was taken up by mostly Italian American groups in New York and New Jersey. Their teenage sonatas echoed their lives and loves. Some were nationwide hits, some were local hits and some are now rare collectors' items. This set includes Dion's unreleased 1st recording from 1956. 3 CD set - 59 tracks.\n\nSTARRY-EYED SERENADERS\n\nRomance has been the overriding preoccupation of songwriters and performers through the ages, and never more so than in the golden years of rock & roll. On Starry-Eyed Serenaders, music historian and producer Stuart Colman has intertwined an array of love songs, some famous, many much sought after, that together assert what the classic make-out ballad is all about. 2 CD set - 50 tracks. Limited quantity.\n\nSTEREO DOO WOP - Volume 1\n\n25 great stereo doo wop cuts...as you've never heard them before! Includes many alternate takes and mixes. Listen to the Eternals, Continental Five, Jarmels, Turbans and many others. 25 tracks.\n\nSTEREO DOO WOP - Volume 2\n\nAnother volume of 25 great stereo doo wop cuts...as you've never heard them before! Includes many alternate takes and mixes.
