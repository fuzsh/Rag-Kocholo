        "text": "In our study we analyse the characteristic features of rock concerts in Hungary during the last years of communist rule. We distinguish between „state rock”, a trend similar to pop music, and „concert rock”. During the 1980s we carried out participant observation at rock concerts and conducted interviews with young convert goers. We view rock concerts as scenes from a musical subculture in our study. The effects ot two types of rock concerts – hard-rock and underground – relating to the „voice of the rebel” and to the „voice of the conservative” (the revolt against authority manifested in concerts and its role int he socialisation of young people) are analysed, as is the role the concerts played int he lives of the fans. Underground concerts, ont he other hand, socialised young people for the roles of the intellectual, artist and bourgeois. Ont he basis of the above findings, we conclude that rock music played a politically progressive role under communism through its function of retaining the values of different social strata.\n\nFor American Balkan music tourists, it is disillusioning to reconcile the Balkan village (a long-imagined source of fascination) with the urbanity they encounter in Bulgaria. The Koprivshtitsa festival, however, does offer visitors images of the \" folk. \" Based on fieldwork and surveys conducted with tourists, the article examines the varied expectations that festival attendees hold for Koprivshtitsa as timeless village, cultural center, and contemporary town, and calls for an ethnomusicological consideration of the nature and role of fascination within musical tourism. It concludes by relating \" meaningful blindness \" (integral to these tourists' fascination) to their imaginings, arguing that sonic encounter in situ brings fascination not to an end but rather to a more self-aware stage of subject-to-object relationship, through the reciprocal witnessing of Selves and Others.\n\nIn this essay, which was published as the \"Coda\" to a compilation of essays about Hungarian popular music, I attempted to address the intricacies and complications involved in an apparently straightforward question: How is Hungarian-made music known and appreciated by non-Hungarians? I pointed out the irony in some local musicians’ re-claiming their Hungarianness, in particular those “others” whose ethnicity or choice of musical style is regularly questioned by ethnocentric, nationalist or downright racist discourses. Expressing a similar unease differently, other Hungarians would rather downplay their own and their music’s national identity in favor of the city or the region where they live and work. While witnessing the revival of nationalism in Hungary as in many other countries, popular music communities continue to take advantage of opportunities of connecting with each other through unique musical hybrids or adoption of “foreign” musical languages and identities across continents."
