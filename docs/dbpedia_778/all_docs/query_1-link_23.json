        "text": "Every once in a while a band comes along that completely blow you off your feet. Young Heart Attack were one such band when they arrived on the scene in 2004 in the midst of the glorious whirlwind of nostalgia surrounding rock music at the time. While the likes of The Strokes heralded the return of indie/alternative guitar music to the masses in 2001, The Datsuns and The Hives heralded the revival of the vintage garage rock sounds of the late 60s and early 70s in 2002. That in turn also led into a frenzy of Classic Rock influenced bands emerging from the wilderness and into the limelight, as a genre that had been impossibly uncool for a number of years, suddenly became in vogue again. Before long the high street was saturated with “Vintage” band t-shirts, spearheaded by celebrities sporting said fashion, explaining how they had always loved The Ramones, MC5, Motorhead and Thin Lizzy when questioned on their attire.\n\nNot that I was complaining at this sudden resurgence in a genre of music I held so close to my heart. Not having to whisper about the bands I liked to save ridicule was a welcome relief. What made it all the more exciting was the fact that it wasn’t the old bands that were leading the charge. It was groups of young musicians who were in their early 20s like myself, who had grown up with their dads record collections which had inspired them to form their own bands. In amongst all of these bands were Young Heart Attack from Austin, Texas. And they were really rather good indeed.\n\nTheir debut album ‘Mouthful Of Love’ was released on XL records in the UK in 2004 and was rapturously received by the UK music press. The band blended high energy Rock n Roll with huge musical hooks you could hang your hat on. The Boy/Girl co- vocalists of Chris Hodge and Jennifer Stephens really made them stand out from the pack at the time, with Stephens fast becoming something of a pin-up in rock circles.\n\nAlong with Hodge also playing guitar they were backed by a phenomenally powerful band containing Chris “Frenchie” Smith on guitar, Stephen T. Hall on Bass, and Joey Shuffield on drums. Their enthusiasm and rock n roll spirit was infectious and impossible to ignore. The title track and album opener ‘Mouthful Of Love’ opens at breakneck speed full of the rawness of Bon Scott era AC/DC and high octane guitar riffs, decorated with flourishes of Hammond Organ. Hodge and Stephens trade vocals on what is a phenomenal opening.\n\nBetter is to come with ‘Starlight’ which marries The Who’s stabbing guitars and ‘Won’t Get Fooled Again’ influenced keyboards with one of the most glorious choruses you are ever likely to hear on a rock album this side of the new millennium. Stephens singing “I’m Alive!” over and over again as Hodge punctuates the lines with “Starlight you burn so bright!” shows just how brilliant the co-lead vocals work between them.\n\nThe pace does not let up as El Camino gives a heavy dose of southern rock boogie-punk with an atmospheric, woozy mid-section breakdown, along with Tommy Shots with its blistering fretwork from Chris “Frenchie” Smith. The album takes a breather at the mid point with ‘Take Me Back Mary Jane’ that sounds like it could be one of the laid back, front porch blues numbers that Jack White prolifically knocked out during The White Stripes early days.\n\n‘To The Teeth’ raises the pace and volume up to 11 again with its ‘Communication Breakdown’ riff and punky delivery which segues directly into ‘Sick Of Doing Time’, full of uplifting “Hey, Hey, Heys” and fast, frentic guitars. As the album comes towards its end the high quality and consistency continues with ‘Over And Over’ with its exceptional breakdown and rebuild that sounds tailor-made for massive outdoor shows, and is one of the most powerful songs on the album. The album closes with ‘Misty Rowe’ which could almost be a signature song and probably encapsulates all that is great about the band in four and a half glorious minutes of balls out rock n roll with its thundering riff and the great vocal interplay between Hodge and Stephens.\n\nYoung Heart Attack – Misty Rowe (Music Video)\n\nAs an album it still remains one of my favourites released post-millenium. As with so many bands, label problems prevented them from capitalising on their initial success and after many struggles finally managed to get their second album ‘Rock And Awe’ recorded and released in 2007. While it had its moments, the title track in particular, overall it lacked that spark and fire that their debut had in abundance. For me I prefer to remember them for how they were in 2004 when their raw energy and spirit contributed to them writing a classic, high energy, rock n roll record that married all the best elements of the genre and condensed them into 34 rocket fuelled minutes."
