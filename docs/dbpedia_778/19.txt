Unfortunately this is the final album for Mylon & Broken Heart. Mylon did put out one more album in 1992 but this was really the last show for them. Mylon was still recovering from his heart attack in 1989 but the band did tour in support of this album so it doesn’t look like it was a messy breakup. Instead it looks like they went out as friends. The band didn’t do much after this though guitarist David Payton did release an album in 1991 which I just got my hands on but have not listened to yet. As for this album it’s yet another excellent Rock & Roll album that we came to expect of them. In fact I think this album may have some of their best Rock tunes. If you only have time for one track I truly recommend “World Changer” which is a kicker Rock & Roll track.

This was without a doubt one of Mylon LeFevre’s most successful albums. It had 4 CCM singles. Again And Again made it to #1, Mercy Seat to #3, Modern Man to #37, and Lamb Of God to #26. It also won the 1989 Dove Award for Recorded Song of the Year, Rock for “Won by One”. That’s a pretty darn successful album. It is also probably his best produced album with his usual producer Joe Hardy hitting it out of the park on this one. This was his first album with Star Song records after being done with Myrrh. It was nice to see he could bring his producer over with him as sometimes after a label change inside politics gets involved and complicates staffing matters but obviously not here. Really I can’t add much more than that. This is a must listen to album for anyone that listened to CCM music in the 80’s.

It was 1989 and time for another Mylon LeFevre album. In the late 80’s Mylon was consistently putting an album out every year. His offering for 1989 was another successful album. It actually received a Grammy nomination for “Best Gospel Vocal Performance By A Duo Or Group, Choir Or Chorus” but lost out to Daniel Winans. Having listened to both albums I believe Mylon’s was better but I wasn’t an academy voting member. The album spawned 3 singles with “Jesus, It’s You” making it to #1, “Movin’ On” to #12, and “Love Comes Down” to #22. While touring with Whiteheart in support of this album Mylon suffered a heart attack. Ironically the tour was called the Heart Attack tour, you can’t make up irony like that. It should be noted that he continued touring in the Philippines in 1990 against his doctor’s advice. Doctors stated that Mylon’s previous involvement with alcohol and drugs had a large role in his heart attack. As for the album I think it was toned down a bit from his previous release but still has some good Rock tracks on it.

In 1986 Mylon & Broken Heart released a “crossover” album using the Moniker Look Up on Columbia Records. Personally this is my favourite album from them. While the album isn’t overtly Christian it does contain a remixed version “Peace Begins Within” from the We Believe album and a cover of DeGarmo and Key’s “Love is All You Need”. The cover version by the way is just excellent. I’m a little confused as to why this was done as by 86 we already knew this crossover stuff didn’t really work. Now even more confusing is the list of guests on this album. Dana Key, Dave Perkins, Ed DeGarmo, Jimi Jamison (Survivor), Kerry Livgren, and Philip Bailey. That’s quite the lineup of Christian artists for a secular album. The last strange thing is that the album was produced by Dana Key, Ed DeGarmo, and Joe Hardy. But hey it worked, great album.

This live album was recorded in Mylon’s hometown of Atlanta, and it was a rock’n’roll homecoming. The crowd sounds great, and the band is working them. This is a great example of a live record. Interesting inclusion is the second track “It’s Alright” which appeared on Matthew Ward’s landmark album “Toward Eternity.” Mylon’s version is a different take and it works well for him.

1 – Introduction Jesus Is A Waymaker – 3:29

This was Mylon’s fourth album after his switch to Christian music. It was well received and paved the way for his best selling album to be released next (Crack The Sky). I feel the album was poorly engineered as the songs have a rock feel but not a sound to match. I am guessing that label (Myrrh) wanted it toned down but I have no proof of that. It’s just a suspicion given Myrrh’s track record on these matters. The mix was done by Joe Hardy who had worked with ZZ Top among other hard rock acts in the past so I doubt it was his doing . Anyway back to the album. I have actually read that some die hard fans consider this to be his best album and I agree that there are some great cuts that’s for sure but frankly the production was too poor for me to hold this album up as his best. My favourite track is “Gospel Ship” on which Mylon was allowed to rock. It has a bit of a traditional sound but it’s great. I have to mention the guest stars on this album. It really is an unbelievable list. Among the all stars contributing in some way are Rick Cua, Philip Bailey, Kerry Livgren, Leon Patillo, Greg X. Volz, Jerome Olds, Joe English, Larry Norman, and Russ Taff. That’s quite the group of guests.

The fifth album from Mylon LeFevre and Broken Heart did not disappoint. They continued their trip through the 80’s with an album with a sound perfectly suited to 1987. The album had 3 CCM singles, Closer Than A Heartbeat, I Belong, and For My Growing. I swear if you want to know what tracks to skip on an album just look at the CCM charts. The rest of the album was excellent and played well on real Christian radio. The album also received a Dove Award for 1988 Rock Album.

This is a fascinating sampler album (CD). It came out on Arrival Records, which is a Sublabel of K-Tel International. I had no idea until I found this album that K-Tel had distributed Christian albums. Even more of a surprise for me is that there were several of these albums. The quality of the CD is horrible, but I’ve cleaned up the recordings as best I could. K-Tel’s vinyl releases were well known for their horrible quality which was a result of cheap vinyl and cheap pressing. This album was released on CD so there was no need for the poor quality. I’ve always suspected that the licensing agreements for these songs included a stipulation that the quality be horrible in hopes people would buy the original album.

Include below is the info on which album the songs were released on

This is an album I missed back in 1983 and I’m a little surprised at that considering the talent assembled. There are backing vocals from 2nd Chapter Of Acts, Annie Herring, Matthew Ward, and Sevenfold among others. Phil Keaggy is on guitar and Kerry Livgren on keyboards. This is pretty much a super group with all that talent. The album itself is mainly easy listening which is probably why I missed it. The production quality is excellent and the assembled band is tight.
