There are 42 Madanika’s carved on soap stone and are placed at several parts of the Chennakeshava Temple. Every madanika is carved to a minute detail in different natya postures.

The other famous Madanikas are, The lady with parrot, Bhasmasura Mohini and the huntress. Ornaments worn by each of these shilabalike’s can actually be rotated (3D structures) showing the amount of stone mastery the sculptors possessed.\n\nSri kappe Chennigaraya temple was constructed similar to kesava Temple, with out mukha mandapam.

There is a pyramidal vimanam is on the sanctum sanctorum.\n\nThere is an interesting legend behind making of the Idol Kappechennigaraya. Jakanna, the main sculptor from Kaikala village, came to Belur and made the Idol of Keshava. On seeing the beautiful image, Dakanna another young sculptor told that there is a defect in the idol. Jakanna didn’t accept the same and told that if the defect is proved he will cut off his right hand. An examination was conducted in front of senior sculptors and country men. Dakanna applied sandal paste allover the body of the idol. The sandal paste dried after some time except on stomach naval portion and remained wet. As per the order of senior sculptors the wet portion was broke open. Immediately, water with a frog / therai came out. The senior sculptors praised the knowledge of Dakanna. Before the others came to normal, Jakanna cuts off his right hand with sword. Latter Jakanna came to know that Dakanna was his own son. The hand grew normal with the grace of Keshava Perumal.\n\nSince kappe means frog in kannada language was found in the Keshava idol, the idol was called as Kappechennigaraya and installed with inscription of Queen’s name Shantala Devi. Latter the same was replaced with a new one, but the name continued remained till date.\n\nThe Vira Narayana Temple... is just on the back side of the Kesava temple. This temple belongs to 12th Century. The temple is with Sanctum sanctorum, vestibule and Navaranga mandapam. The walls of the temple are decorated reliefs like Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma, Bhairava, Lakshmi, Parvati, Saraswati and others. Some of the panels are with the reliefs depicting the epic Ramayana and Mahabharata story.\n\nSomanayagi Temple... is dedicated to Maha Lakshmi. Even though the temple was built during Vijayanagara, which was destroyed during Muslims invasion.\n\nThe Andal temple...., also called Ranganayaki Temple, is on the northwest of the Kesava temple, built during Vijayanagara period. The sanctum sanctorum walls are decorated with 31 large images of deities of Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism. In addition to this it also has intricately carved Venugopala, Mohini and Lakshmi, as well as bas-reliefs depicting the legends of epic Ramayana, Mahabharata and Puranas.\n\nHISTORY AND INSCRIPTIONS\n\nAn inscription on the pedestal of Vijayanarayana image states that the image was caused to be made by king Vishnu ( Vishnuvardhana ).\n\nKappechennigaraya temple… when king Vishnuvardhana got the keshava temple constructed, Santala Devi, his chief queen made her contribution by causing an other Keshava temple to be built to the south of main temple similar in form to it which is popular as Kappechennigaraya temple. Kappechennigaraya image which is exactly like that of the keshava in the main shrine. Though small in size bears the name of the queen on the pedestal.\n\nThere are about 118 inscriptions recorded from this temple, covering the period from 1117 CE to 18th Century. These inscriptions records the endowments established in this temple, the sculptors who are responsible for the construction of this temple and the renovations carried out.\n\nThe Vishnuvardhana’s inscription records that this temple was constructed with the wealth, earned through his sword. Also it records that this temple was constructed to mark the liberation of Hoysalas from Chalukyas. He also constructed Chenna Kesava and Lakshmi Narayanar temples in the same complex. Chennakesava Perumal temple was constructed by his wife and Queen Shantala Devi.\n\nIn 1298 CE, the Vimanam wood work had rotted and fallen and was repaired, pillars were erected to support it. The temple suffered a heavy damage at the time of the Muslims invasion, in 1310 CE. The Vimana above the sanctum sanctorum was rectified more than twice in. After collapse of the Vimana above the Sanctum Sanctorum in 19th Century, the same was not reconstructed. The temple was kept closed till the time of Harihara -II of Vijayanagara King. In 1387 CE, the broken kalasa on the top of the Vimana was restored with gold plated kalasas.

There is a strong tradition and popular belief in this region that the architect of this temple is Jakanachari about whom is an interesting story for which so far no historic evidence has been found. Be that as it may, the temple may be said to be sculptural poetry immortalising the achievements variously of Vishnuvardhana and the sculptors like Dasoja, Chavana his son, Chikka Hampa, Malliyana, Eechana Maloja, Kenchamalliyanna, Malla and Hagoja who bestowed their best in creating this masterpiece.\n\nAfter 1935, Temple was repaired by the Mysore Government and Wodeyar Kings.
