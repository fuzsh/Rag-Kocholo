        "text": "30th October 2010\n\nThe first view of Kalleshwara Temple at Aralaguppe was disappointing. It looked like a normal Temple. The lake next to the Temple also did not inspire me much.\n\nThis was the Temple built by Nolambas, the dynasty that ruled the area before Hoysalas.\n\nThe great aspect of the Temple is the carvings on the ceiling. That is something different that is not commonly seen.\n\nThe Channakeshava Temple is typical of any Hoysala Temple. The Ekakuta Temple is well maintained and preserved. While the exterior of the Temple has extensive carving, the interiors are comparatively simple.\n\nKanchiraya Swamy Temple on a nearby hill provides some panoramic view of the surrounding area. A steep road takes to the top of the hill which on normal days would be peaceful. As mentioned by the villagers, the views from the top were simply great.\n\nHow to reach Aralaguppe?\n\nKibbanalli cross is 130 km from Bengaluru on Bengaluru-Honnavar highway. Take left turn here and drive for 6km to reach a small village Banasandra. Take a left turn and proceed 5 km to reach Aralaguppe."
