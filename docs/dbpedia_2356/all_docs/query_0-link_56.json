        "text": "Address\n\nAralaguppe Chenna Keshava Temple, Aralaguppe, Karnataka 572212\n\nDiety\n\nChenna Keshava\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Chennakeshava temple, dedicated to the god Vishnu, is located in Aralaguppe, a small town in Karnataka state, India. Aralaguppe has located 60 km from the city of Hassan.\n\nPuranic Significance\n\nThe temple in Aralaguppe was constructed around 1250 CE during the reign of King Vira Someshwara of the Hoysala Empire. It holds the status of a protected monument under the Karnataka state division of the Archaeological Survey of India.\n\nAralaguppe was not always a quiet village; it thrived under various dynasties, including the Ganga dynasty in the 9th century, the Kalyana Chalukyas, and finally, the Hoysalas in the 13th century. Its historical significance is evident through its magnificent temples. The older temple, built by the Gangas, is known as the Kalleshwara temple, while the other is the Chenna Keshava temple, constructed during the Hoysala rule.\n\nThe Chenna Keshava temple stands out for its unique dedication to Vaishnavism, which sets it apart from other temples dedicated to Lord Vishnu. The temple’s outer walls feature an impressive array of large statues, totaling ninety in number. Among these, 47 represent male deities, while the remaining sculptures depict female deities. Of the male sculptures, 44 portray Lord Vishnu in his various avatars, though unfortunately, many of these sculptures are now in a state of disrepair and ruins.\n\nCentury/Period/Age\n\n9th century A.D.\n\nManaged By\n\nArcheological survey of India.\n\nNearest Bus Station\n\nAralaguppe\n\nNearest Railway Station\n\nAralaguppe\n\nNearest Airport\n\nMysore"
