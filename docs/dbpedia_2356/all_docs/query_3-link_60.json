        "text": "Chennakesava Temple,Aralaguppe, Tumkur District\n\nWhile traveling from Bangalore to Shimoga, after Kibbanahalli cross and\n\n15 km before Tiptur a big signboard reads \"Way to Chennakesava\n\ntemple, Aralaguppe.\" A couple of kilometers on this deviation bring\n\nus to the spellbinding 13th century architectural beauty of Hoysalas.\n\nAralaguppe was known as 'Alariguppe' according to inscriptions from\n\nthe bygone era. The Chennakesava temple here has all the usual\n\ncharacteristics of the Hoysala architectural style, which is said to\n\nhave been introduced first in the Hoysaleshwara temple, Halebid.\n\nThe raised platform following the contours of the stellate plan of the\n\nmain temple, circumambulatory path ay to go round the temple, carved\n\nrepetitive friezes for basement cornices, introduction of a second\n\nchadya or eave between the figure sculpture, turreted pilasters and\n\ndecorative miniature towers, exuberant ornamentation of the figure\n\nsculptures, are all the predominant features of Hoysala architecture.\n\nIn the absence of any inscription available, this style alone has\n\nhelped the art historians to assign this temple to 13th century.\n\nThe Chennakesava temple stands on a raised platform in the centre of\n\nthe village. This is Ekakuta temple a single celled temple, with its\n\nstar shaped garbhagriha and tower is of a simple ground plan consisting\n\nof an antarala (vestibule), navaranga and an entrance ankana fitted\n\nwith pierced stone windows, which allows subdued light into the temple.\n\nThe temple follows the contours of the vimana and has a flight of steps\n\nin the front flanked by two miniature towers on each side.\n\nThe decorative friezes running around the temple wall provides many\n\nspectacular scenes. The row of six friezes carved one above the other,\n\nseparated horizontally by deeply cut recesses, consists of caparisoned\n\nelephants, horses, creepers, mythological frieze, makaras and lastly\n\nhamsas. The mythological friezes tell the story of Ramayana and\n\nBhagavata. The lowest friezes of elephants and horses are picturesque\n\nrepresentations of the turbulent wars fought by the Hoysalas to build\n\nand consolidate their empire. The makaras and hamsas are indicative of\n\nthe peacetime prosperity, wealth and happiness of the subjects.\n\nThe wall decorations are as profuse as in any other ornate Hoysala\n\ntemple.\n\nHere also we see the regular scheme of dividing the outer wall into two\n\nportions by a horizontally running cornice. The lower half has the\n\nsculptures standing below a canopy of creepers. Most of them are the\n\nChaturvimsati Murthy, the 24 forms of Vishnu and other deities with six\n\nhands and are the most spectacular iconographic specialty of this\n\ntemple. Because normally they are shown only with four hands. Above\n\nthese sculptures, the upper half of the wall shows varied forms of\n\nminiature towers, turrets on pilasters.\n\nThe vimana of this temple is in the shape of 16-pointed star and\n\nconsists of kuta aedicule each one rotated by 22.5 degrees, 45 degrees,\n\nand 22.5 degrees successively. The tower of the vimana with four talas\n\nhas a vedike and kuta roof at the top, which follows the contours of\n\nthe sanctum below. The top kalasa is missing.\n\nThe outer wall of navaranga is of staggered squares and represents a\n\nsaptaratha structure. Some of the sculptures here bear the name of\n\n'Honnoja' on their pedestal while some others have only 'Ho' as a short\n\nform of the sculptor's name. This terse name without any titles or\n\nclaims keeps us in darkness as far as the sculptor is concerned.\n\nThe navaranga is of the usual nine ankanas or divisions and has two\n\nniches containing Ganesha and Mahishasuramardini, both of exquisite\n\nworkmanship.\n\nA six-feet tall slightly damaged Keshava idol is kept in the navaranga\n\nand perhaps, was the original deity that adored the garbhagriha, but at\n\npresent there is a smaller idol for worship. The pillars that support\n\nthe navaranga and the ceilings are elaborately worked. The fine\n\nworkmanship of the pillars is eye-catching.\n\nBut unfortunately the exquisite beauty of this temple has been marred\n\nby another temple, which is built for Ugra Narasimha, annexing the\n\nsouthern wall of the Chennakesava temple. Unless one has access to the\n\ngarbhagriha of the Narasimha temple, it would be impossible to see the\n\nsculptural beauty of half the southern wall of Chennakesava temple.\n\nThough Mysore archaeological report 1935, talks of removing this\n\nobstruction and building a separate temple for Narasimha, perhaps due\n\nto the unwillingness of the local villagers the project has remained on\n\npaper only. If not for this one flaw, the condition of this temple is\n\nfairly good.\n\nPre-Hoysala shrine\n\nA pre-Hoysala shrine, the Kalleshwara temple attracted the attention of\n\nexperts, as the Natesha in the middle of the ashtadikpalakas panels\n\nover the mukhamantapa ceiling, is considered the most beautiful\n\nsculpture found in the State.\n\nConsisting of garbagriha, antarala, and a mukhamantapa (with three\n\nlateral shrines), the temple's sanctum sanctorum is adorned with a huge\n\nblack-granite Shivalinga.\n\nWhile the adhishtana is made of granites, the temple's walls and towers\n\nare constructed with bricks. The outer walls are insipid without\n\nprojections and recesses, but for the lone niche at the antarala that\n\ndivides the vimana from the mukhamantapa. Pilasters built closer at the\n\ntemple's interiors however, appears more refreshing.\n\nThe extraordinary ceiling of the mukhamantapa, with the Nolambas style\n\nportrayal of Umasahita (Shiva and Parvati together) at the central\n\npanel, is a stark contrast with the otherwise ordinary interior.\n\nThe image of Gajalakshmi on the doorway adds charm to the place. The\n\nfour lathe-cum-pillars, with cubical bases, supports the navaranga's\n\nceiling. Apart from the Shiva-Parvati panel, the ceiling has eight\n\nother carvings of ashtadikpalakas, depicted with their consorts and\n\nvehicles. Four vidyadharas, with garlands in their hands, face up to\n\nthe Natesha (with the expression of approaching him from the corners of\n\nthe panel's beams).\n\nThese garland-bearing vidyadharas are quite common to Nolamba\n\narchitecture; a clear evidence of the elegance and comprehensiveness of\n\ntheir style. The Natesha, meanwhile, is a remarkable three-dimensional\n\nimage, wearing jewels such as the katibandana and tassels. The dancing\n\nlord is accompanied by three bhutas playing a three-headed percussion\n\ninstrument. They are also seen with ayut and other symbols.\n\nThe northern and eastern lateral shrines contain idols of Keshava and\n\nSurya, while the southern one contains the Umasahita mounted over a\n\nlarge stele with a lotus pedestal and a prabhavali with a couple of\n\nflying vidyadharas."
