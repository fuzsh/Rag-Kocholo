        "text": "The Chennakesava Temple of Belur, Karnataka is a Hoysala style temple built in the 12th century AD. it is located in the town of Belur (about 200+) kilometres away from Bangalore, Karnataka. There are a number of things that are interesting about the structure and the history of the temple. However, my post is going to focus on a unique aspect of the temple- the elephant friezes carved out on the outer walls of the temple. There are about 650 elephants carved on the lower level of the outer wall but what makes the elephants stand apart is that not one animal is carved like another. Every elephant has been given a different style- some annoyed, some peaceful, some bedecked, some lazy. You really have to admire the sculptors and the master architect for giving the elephants their personality. Enjoy the photos!\n\nAnother older elephant post of mine here."
