During their reign, several temples in Belur were built under their patronage.\n\nBelur takes you back in time to get a glimpse into the art, design, and sculpture of a bygone era. The innovative architecture and beautiful carvings of the temples draw several thousand tourists every year.

Adorned with intricate carvings depicting scenes from the ‘Mahabharata’ and ‘Ramayana’, the temple took 103 years to finish. Also referred to as Keshava, it has been an active Hindu temple since its founding. Dedicated to Shiva, this little wonder of Belur is one of the lesser-known sites in Karnataka. This temple of Belur is a testimony to the cultural, artistic, and theological perspectives of the Hoysala empire.\n\n2. An Ancient Sculpture: Paathaaleshwara Temple\n\nOne of the most famous places in Belur, the Paathaaleshwara Temple is one of the ancient sculptures constructed by the Ganga kings. Known for the colour-changing lingam present at the temple, the place attracts thousands of tourists. Constructed by carving on stones, this Belur temple has fantastic architecture. Standing in near ruins, this little wonder of Karnataka is an understated one.\n\nOther Famous Religious Structures And Temples In Belur\n\nThe Chennakeshava temple complex at Belur comprises several other Hindu temples and minor shrines within a walled compound. Added during the repairs of the Vijayanagar Empire era, the compound entrance is from the east through Gopuram. The Chennakeshava temple complex has been presented to be listed under UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\n3. A Minor Shrine: Kappe Chennigaraya Temple\n\nBuilt by Queen Shantala Devi in 1117 CE, the Kappe Chennigaraya temple is a minor shrine located south of the main sanctum of the Chennakesava temple. Measuring 124 feet by 105 feet, it has two sanctums inside—one dedicated to Chennigaraya and the other to Venugopala. The idol of the deity draws several devotees every year. This temple of Belur is named after a local legend, wherein a kappe (frog) was once found near its navel.\n\n4. Depicts The Bhima Story From ‘Mahabharata’: Veeranarayana Temple\n\nLocated to the west of the Kesava temple, the Veeranarayana temple is a small but complete temple with a garbhagriha (sanctum) and a navrang (nine square halls) with 59 large reliefs on the outer walls. Measuring 70 feet by 56 feet, this temple of Belur is dedicated to Vishnu, Shiva, Bhairava (angry Shiva), Brahma, Parvati, Saraswati, Lakshmi, and others.

Dating back to the 12th century, this temple of Belur is notable because its tower is a miniature version of the major tower that once rose above the main Kesava temple.\n\n6. Showing Legends In The Puranas: Andal Temple\n\nAlso called the Ranganayaki shrine, the Andal temple is located northwest of the Chennakesava temple. Decorated with artwork such as nature and elephants, this Belur temple also displays 31 large images of deities from the Shaktism, Shaivism, and Vaishnavism traditions of Hinduism.

An extraordinary pillar, it stands by itself as it does not have a foundation. Made of a single stone, this pillar in Belur is a testament to the architectural skill of the Vijayanagar era.\n\n8. An Artistic Marvel: Narasimha Pillar\n\nCarved with miniature figures from top to bottom, such as the kadale basava (a tiny bull), Narasimha Pillar was built during the Hoysala era and looms at a height of 30 feet. Crafted out of soapstone, this pillar is situated inside the Chennakesava temple in Belur. An artistic marvel, it carries all the unique architectural features of the temple in a miniature form. Initially, this pillar was designed such that it could be rotated freely within a fixed circle.\n\n9. Popularly Known As The Big Tank: Vishnu Samudra\n\nPopularly known as the big tank, Vishnu Samudra in Belur was constructed during the reign of Narasimha Raya under Padmarasa’s supervision. While constructing the north end of the Chennakesava temple in a quadrangle, Basappa Naayaka of Uttanahalli added a few steps around the edge of the water on all three sides to use the holy water for sacred purposes. To this day, tourists and worshippers use this tank in the daily worship of the temple.\n\n10. The Celestial Nymphs: Madanikas\n\nAlso known as celestial nymphs, the madanikas are the most popular reason to visit the Chennakesava temple in Belur. Designed with utmost precision, the madanikas are bracket figures that grace the walls of the temple.
