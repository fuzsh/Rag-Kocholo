        "text": "The sun is out. The skies are blue. And my camera finger is twitching.\n\nThus, in the wee hours, one sets off in search of obscure Hoysala temples. This time, it’s the Chennakeshava temple at Aralaguppe. This little dot-on-the map is difficult to locate even with GPS.\n\nAralaguppe is about 60km from the town of Hassan, and 140km from Bangalore. Hassan was an important city during the Hoysala period, from the 10th century to the 14th. As a result, there are many ancient Hoysala temples in and around Hassan, including the famous ones at Halebidu and Beluru.\n\nThe Hoysala temple at Aralaguppe is unheard of by the tourist crowds, and is far away from the beaten track. For which one is thankful. Such temples allow Hoysala connoisseurs like me the liberty to take photographs at leisure, without a bunch of raucous idiots breathing down my neck.\n\nExcept that the bent old caretaker at this temple is a cranky nitwit.\n\nWouldn’t let me shoot photos of the outside of the temple, although it is freely permitted. Even after the presiding priest gave me permission to shoot outside and told the caretaker to back off, that crackpot kept following me around, cursing and threatening.\n\nI left the place after a few minutes, before I picked up a major argument with this cantankerous jackass. But not before I shot several photos,. Not as many as I would have liked, but enough.\n\nThe Chennakeshava temple, at the name indicates, is dedicated to Vishnu. This temple was consecrated in 1250 CE and has all the architectural components of a typical Hoysala temple.\n\nWhat makes this obscure temple different, and why I went looking for it, are the carvings of Chaturvimshati rupani, that is, Vishnu in 24 forms. In his four-armed version, Vishnu bears a conch, discus, mace and lotus in each of his arms. He may bear these objects in any of his arms, giving rise to different combinations. For those of you who remember your college mathematics, that happens to be 4! (four factorial), hence 24 forms.\n\nThis temple depicts all these 24 forms on its walls. I couldn’t count them all, but I think I got most of them in my camera. The chief sculptor of this small but impressive Hoysala temple was Honnoja, a famous sculptor of the era. His name can still be seen below some of the sculptures.\n\nThis is an ekakuta temple, i.e, it has one shikara tower (or vimana) above the primary deity’s garbhagriha (the sanctum). The temple is built on an elevated platform called the jagati. And like most other Hoysala temples, the outer walls have six horizontal friezes with rows of elephants, horses and depictions of various stories from our scriptures.\n\nAs is my practice, I paid for an archana and offered a generous dakshina to the priest. In spite of the boorish caretaker, I felt I owed it to the temple and the priest.\n\nEight hundred years ago, when Honnoja and his colleagues created these masterpieces in soapstone, little would they have known that one fine day in the 21st century, Yours Truly would arrive on the scene to write a blogpost on them, eh?\n\nThe marauders from the Delhi sultanate, who repeatedly plundered and desecrated all other Hoysala temples during the 14th century, and again during the 16th century, did not spare this little temple either. But here too, what remains is still awe-inspiring in its artistry, if not in size.\n\nAvoid this place.\n\nI won’t mince my words. Just avoid this hostile place. Even for a Hoysala aficionado like me, this place is not worth the aggravation and the trouble of the 3-hour journey it takes to get there.\n\nCheers … Srini.\n\nSept 5, 2022\n\nIt’s been many weeks since I last wrote a blogpost. Incessant rains and heavy flooding across Bangalore made it impossible for me to leave my home.\n\nThis Sunday though, the sun was shining and the skies were reasonably clear, and I leapt at the opportunity to get off my gluteals and head out into the countryside, with one of my many cameras in hand.\n\nMagadi is a historic town about 50 km from Bangalore. The town was founded by the Chola dynasty during the early 12th century. In those days, it was known as Maha Gadi (the great boundary) or Mahalakshmi Gadi, The colonial British anglicised the name to Magadi during the 19th century.\n\nHiriya Kempegowda, the Kannada chieftain who founded the city of Bangalore in the 16th century, hails from this part of Karnataka.\n\nMagadi has five ancient Shiva temples, one of which I’ve already written about. You can check it out here.\n\nThe town is also known for the Sri Ranganathaswamy temple, one of the most revered Vaishnava sites in south India. The temple was commissioned by the Cholas during the 12th century. Over the centuries. the temple was expanded by the Vijayanagar empire in the 16th century and by the Wodeyars in the 18th century.\n\nThe temple’s actual name one learns, is Paschima Venkatachalapathi, because the primary deity faces west. This deity was installed by Sage Mandavya long before the temple was commissioned by the Cholas, so goes the legend.\n\nAnother unique feature of this temple is the presence of a very rare Shaligrama shila inside the sanctum sanctorum. Scientifically, a shaligrama is a fossilised ammonite. The ammonites are a group of molluscs that went extinct about 66 million years ago. Like modern-day snails and oysters, these molluscs had soft bodies inside hard shells. The fossilised shells of these ammonites are shaped like conches and bear a strong resemblance to the primary icons of Lord Vishnu, i.e, his shankhu and chakra.\n\nFor the devout, shaligrams are direct representations of Lord Vishnu and are deeply revered. Shaligrams are found only on the banks of the Gandaki river, at the foothills of the Himalayas, in modern-day Nepal.\n\nGenuine shaligrams are very hard to find and there’s no shortage of counterfeits. For this reason, the Sri Ranganathaswamy temple at Magadi is especially important as a Shaligram kshetra.\n\nWhile you’re there, visit the Someshwara temple and check out Magadi lake as well.\n\nSri Ranganathaswamy temple is about 2 hours from Bangalore, by road. The road is being widened and is in a horrible shape. When I drove down, parts of the road were flooded due to shabby drainage systems.\n\nWatch out for rash drivers and avoid the carcasses of old trees that were chopped down to make way for “development”.\n\nNormal darshan timings are between 8.30am to 1.30pm and 4.30pm to 7.30pm.\n\nBottom line: Bad road and butchered trees notwithstanding, the temple is definitely worth the trouble. It’s a nice place for a weekend drive with the family. If you don’t carry your own food, you can have a simple but nourishing lunch at the temple. Besides, there are several shops and small hotels around the place.\n\nGPS co-ords: 12.958050247743005, 77.24251269781631.\n\nCopy and paste these co-ords into Google maps.\n\nCheers … Srini.\n\nChloritic schist. That’s the scientific name for Soapstone, that soft and obliging stone from which the Hoysalas created their magnificent temples. At any Hoysala temple, you will see that every inch of the place, both inside and out, has been carved in the most intricate manner. Even the high domed ceilings inside the sanctum are beautifully carved.\n\nI’ve written about the Hoysala dynasty in several of my earlier blogposts, especially this one. Do read them.\n\nIn spite of the horrific desecration done to them by Muslim marauders from the Delhi Sultanate, all through the 14th century, what remains of the once-mighty Hoysala temples is still awesome.\n\nThe ancient Hoysaleswara temple at Halebidu is one such. This temple was looted and desecrated not once, but twice by Muslim invaders. Since Halebidu was the capital of the Hoysalas, the treasures it held were great, and its destruction by the Muslims was equally great. Once known as Dwarasamudra, Gateway to the Ocean, the prosperous capital of the Hoysalas became known as Halebidu, or the Old Place, after the repeated invasions and pillage it suffered.\n\nTheir desecration aside, the temples at Halebidu and Beluru are the most sophisticated Hoysala temples you can see. Which is not surprising, since the original capital was at Beluru and then moved to Halebidu during the 12th century. Both these temples are massive showpieces of Hoysala regal power, architectural skill and sculptural artistry.\n\nThe temple at Belur is a Vaishnava one, dedicated to Chennakeshava (Handsome Krishna), while the one at Halebidu is Shaiva, dedicated to Shiva.\n\nThe Hoysaleswara temple is a Dvikuta, that is, there are two primary Shiva deities inside. One is Hoysaleswara, named after King Vishnuvardhana who commissioned the temple, and the other is Shantaleswara, named after his consort Shantala Devi. Therefore, there are two Nandi shrines outside. There were two vimanas (towers), both were demolished during the Muslim incursions. And there are two main entrances. The north entrance was for commoners of yore, while the south entrance was for the royals.\n\nThe twin-temples have the same general plan as other Hoysala temples, i.e, six-layered friezes all along the outside walls, topped by rows of elaborately carved figures of various deities and heroes from Hindu epics. I won’t describe these carvings in detail, or else this blogpost will go on ad nauseum.\n\nI’d rather let my photos speak. One picture, a thousand words, and that sort of thing. If you want to seriously appreciate the place, and if you’re a seriously amateur photographer like me, what you need to do is to read up, ensure your camera is fully charged (mine wasn’t), and get to the temple really early (I didn’t).\n\nHalebidu, like Beluru, always has a sizable crowd of visitors. The signboard outside says the temple is open from sunrise to sunset, so try your best to get there as early as you can. The place gets crowded even on a weekday.\n\nI went to Halebidu at 3pm, since I had spent the morning at Belur. Even at that hour, with the sun blazing overhead, there were several European tourists, and groups of chattering schoolkids.\n\nTake your time at this place. If you do your homework, you will not need a guide, but if you do hire one, make sure he is an official guide appointed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). He should have an ASI ID on him. The tariff for Indians is Rs.300 per head, but I don’t know if a group discount is applicable. These guides tend to rush along, so you need to slow him down and make him properly explain everything. I hired a guide, made him take me around for a good half-hour and then spent the next two hours slowly going around on my own, taking photographs.\n\nAs always, remember it’s an ASI site, so hand-held photography is freely allowed. Tripods and video photography are not allowed without written permission from the ASI, and that’s not easy to get.\n\nAfter two hours of patient photography, the sun got the better of me, and I had to call it a day. Halebidu and Beluru require a day each, if you want to properly appreciate and document the splendor of the Hoysalas.\n\nI’ll have to wait till the on-going Covid virus scare dies down, but I will visit Halebidu again, this time for an entire day. The Hoysalas deserve that much at least.\n\nRoad distance from Bangalore is about 200km. The nearest major town is Hassan, about 160km from Bangalore. The road is good, almost till the end. Ensure your vehicle has a FastTag sticker on its windshield. Otherwise, the toll-gates on the way will make you miserable and you will lose a lot of time if you have to pay cash.\n\nStart from your home real early. I left at 4.30am, and still took four hours to get there. Food and drink on the highway are not a problem. And at Belur and Halebidu, there are KSTDC hotels that serve decent vegetarian fare. I lunched at the Mayura Shantala-KSTDC hotel opposite the Halebidu temple, and was not disappointed.\n\nThe major irritants at Halebidu are the pesky guys selling dubious guidebooks at inflated prices. Treat them like they do not exist and they will leave you be, once they realise they’re wasting their time with you.\n\nSo, bold traveler, whenever the government deems it’s safe to leave your home, get yourself to Halebidu and tip your hat to the Hoysalas. You will not regret it.\n\nCheers … Srini."
