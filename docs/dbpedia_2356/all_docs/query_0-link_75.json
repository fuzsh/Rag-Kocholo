The lathe turned pillars and heavily ornamented navaranga ceiling panels adorn the Mahamantapa – we were asked not to take pictures inside.\n\nThe two-eave external wall structure is filled with sculptures, decorated deities and reliefs along side well-chiselled miniature towers.\n\nOn the southern side there’s a Narasimha temple.\n\nWhat a marvel!\n\nLocation: https://goo.gl/maps/gk5zAZzQ1ifViqvn7\n\n#drive #heritage #nature"
