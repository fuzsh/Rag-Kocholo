        "text": "The Mysterious temple Chennakesava Belur, Hassan District, Karnataka a Well-known Hindu temple also known as the Keshava, Kesava, or Vijayanarayana Temple of Belur. It was constructed in the 12th century during the Hoysala Empire and is devoted to Lord Vishnu. Belur is a popular tourist destination all year long and is also listed as a UNESCO world heritage site.\n\nThe Chennakesava Temple is built in the Hoysala style of architecture. Some of the highlights of the Chennakesava Temple include the intricate carvings on the walls and pillars, the Hoysala emblem on the ceiling of the main shrine, the Gravity pillar, the hanging bell, and the Nandi bull statue outside the temple.\n\nHassan City is 40 km away, and Bangalore is 220 km away. The Hindu god Vishnu has a form called Chennakesava, which translates to “handsome Kesava.”\n\nIn 1117 CE, King Vishnuvardhana ordered its construction on the Yagachi River bank in Belur, also known as Velapura, the first capital of the Hoysala Empire.\n\nThe temple took 103 years to complete and was built for three generations. Throughout its history, it has been repeatedly destroyed by war, looted, and rebuilt.\n\nThe temple is renowned for its elaborate and exquisite architecture, which features numerous carvings and sculptures. The temple’s enormous bronze bell at the entrance is one of its distinguishing features.\n\nLocation: Belur, Hassan District, Karnataka, India.\n\nRead more\n\n#chennakeshava temple #temples in Belur #temples in Karnataka #old hindu temples #old temples in India #vishnu temples #hoysala architecture temples"
