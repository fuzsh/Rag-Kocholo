Also you can return to the Index of Contents for which links have been provided at several places in the Blog.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nKarnataka is a veritable treasure chest of temples and monuments. In Northern part of Karnataka, Badami, Pattadakal and Aihole showcases the temple building skills of Badami Chalukyas. Hampi region of Vijayanagara dynasty. In Central part,Belur, Halabeid etc with its beautiful temples belonging to the Hoysala Empire. Western Chalukya Empire / Kalyani Chalukya in the Tungabhadra region – Dambal, Itagi, Lakkundi etc. This blog in 4 parts covers some of the above temples visited during 13 Dec 2021 to 20 Dec 2021 (8 Days) Part 1 describes temples covered on Days 1 & 2. Part 2 of the blog describes temples covered on Days 3 & 4. Part 3 of the blog describes temples covered on Day 5. Part 4 of the blog describes temples covered on Days 6,7 & 8.\n\nIn Central & Northern Karnataka, there could be more than 1000 Temples of architecture different from that of Chola, Pandya and Chera dynasty in South India.. It was very saddening to see several temples without idols in Garbagraha, many with idols damaged / disfigured by the Muslim invaders from time to time.The invaders not only looted all the valuables of the temples but also caused innumerable damage to temples and idols. Most of the temples have been reduced to the state of Monuments – for visitors to look at the architectural beauty only. The saving grace is that many temples have been handed over to the Archaeological department of Central / State Government. Poojas are being conducted in few temples and it is very nice to visit these temples. Temples berift of idols miss divinity. Hindu temples are not just prayer halls like Church or Mosque. God resides in the temples after elaborate and continous poojas. It will be great if the Government can ensure that Poojas are conducted at least in big temples (also by installing idols wherever missing / damaged).The great efforts of our ancestors in building magnificient temples should not go as waste – due to the unkindly acts of the invaders.\n\n2 Google Map of North Karnataka Temples\n\nEmbedded Interactive Google Map of North Karnataka Temples is given below. By clicking on a location, photo of the temple, web links for more details of temple, Video (Youtube) links if any can be seen.\n\n3 Google Maps of Implemented Tour Program Day 1 & 2\n\n4 DAY 1 Hoysala temples\n\nWhile one normally associates Hoysala temples with the magnifi cent ones in Belur and Halebid, Chenna Keshava Temple, Aralaguppe, Sri Veeranarayana Swamy Temple, Belavadi , Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple. Javagal and Amrutheshwara Temple, Amruthapura are yet other examples of the brilliance of the Hoysala school of architecture covered in Day 1. Poojas are being conducted in the previous 3 temples mentioned above.We had visited Belur and Halebid earlier and so included in this blog. To return to the Index of Contents, Click Here.

The temple was built around 1250 during the rule of the Hoysala Empire King Vira Someshwara.The temple is a protected monument under the Karnataka state division of the Archaeological Survey of India.\n\nPhotographs and videos cannot truly convey the real beauty of this place. You have to visit it in person to have the true experience.\n\nIt is an Ekakuta temple with Lord Vishnu in the form of Chenna Keshava. There is a seperate sannadhi for Ugra Narasimha. This temple is simple and elegant, an Ekakuta type (jagati), housed on a raised star-shaped poly angled platform. Architecturally, the plan is 16-star pointed (stellate) with a good design with tower and shrine.\n\nAralaguppe flourished under the Ganga dynasty in the 9th century and then under the Kalyana Chalukyas and then the Hoysalas in the 13th century. It’s important place in these kingdoms can be seen through its spectacular temples. The older one, built by the Gangas is called Kalleshwara temple and the other is the Chenna Keshava temple that was built under the rule of the Hoysalas.\n\nStarting from the top, the friezes depict hansa (birds) in the first frieze, makara (aquatic monsters) in the second, epics and other stories in the third (which in this case is from the Hindu epic Ramayana and stories of Krishna), leafy scrolls in the fourth, horses in the fifth and elephants at the bottom. The cella (sanctum) contains an image of Keshava (a version of the Hindu god Krishna) raised on a large pedestal. The image of Vishnu in the garbhagriha is magnificen\n\nAt every angle, there is an intricately carved elephant. As usual, the temple has six pattikas, with carvings of Elephants, Horses, Creepers, Puranic tales, Crocodiles, and Swans, counting from bottom to the top. The outer wall has amazing carvings of Lord Vishnu and his consorts and various other forms of Vishnu.\n\nThere is an elaborately carved doorway and ornately carved mandapa ceiling. The mandapa ceiling is an engineering marvel .The statue of Lord Chenna Keshava on an elevated pedestal inside the garbha griha is another work of pure art.\n\nThe vimana of this temple is constructed in a full star deign. Its navaranga is the only sapta-ratha hall among the Hoysala creations. The vimana measures 4.8m while the temple as a whole measures about 20 m. With its attributes like series of bands, double eaves on external walls and profuse embellishments, the temple would be assigned to the matures Hoysala architectural phase.\n\n4.2 Sri Veeranarayana Swamy Temple, Belavadi\n\nSri Veeranarayana Swamy Temple (Trikutaachala), 7XJW+R78, Belavadi, Karnataka 577146 Sri Veeranarayana Swamy Temple (Trikutaachala), is located at Belavadi (also known as Ekachakranagara), Karnataka at a distance of 225 kms from Bangalore and 30 km from Chikamagalur and 11 kms from Halebidu,. The Veeranarayana temple is a nationally protected monument of India, managed by the Archaeological Survey of India.\n\nWhile one normally associates Hoysala temples with the magnifi cent ones in Belur and Halebid, , this temple is yet another example of the brilliance of the Hoysala school of architecture. Belavadi is an ancient town which has been referenced in the Mahabharatha andis believed to be the place where Bheema killed the demon Bakasura and protected the village..\n\nThe temple has three separate square sanctums connected through an unusually large square ranga-mandapa (103 feet). The main shrine faces east and is dedicated to Viranarayana (Vishnu). The north facing shrine is dedicated to Venu gopala, while the south facing shrine is for Yoga-Narasimha. (Trikutaachala)\n\nBuilt with soap stone this architectural gem is a sight of stupendous beauty and was built in theearly 13th century by king Veera Ballala II. This ornate trikuta (three shrined) temple was built in 1200 C.E. by Hoysala Empire King Veera Ballala II. The material used is Soapstone. Each of the three shrines has a complete superstructure (tower on top of shrine) and is one of the largest temples built by the Hoysala kings. While the famous temples at Belur and Halebidu are known for their intricate sculptures, this temple is known for its architecture The entrance is awe inspiring with aslanting roof fl anked by two massive stone elephants on either side.\n\nThe plan of the temple is unique in that two of the shrines face each other and are located on either side of a wide and spacious open mantapa (hall) containing thirty seven bays. The temple complex has two closed mantapas, one with thirteen bays and another with nine bays, at the end of which is a central shrine. This third shrine is an older construction and exhibits a standard architectural idiom containing all the basic elements of a Hoysala temple. The inner walls of the older shrine are plain, but its roof is well decorated.\n\nIn all, the temple complex has fifty nine bays (hence it has many pillars), most of which are lathe-turned and bell shaped, while a few have decorative carvings on them. According to Foekema, the outer wall of the temple is of the “old style”, with one eaves running around the temple where the superstructure meets the wall of the shrine. Below this are miniature decorative towers on pilasters (aedicule). This is followed by a second eves. A panel of Hindu deities and their attendants (frieze) are below this eves followed by a set of five moldings that form the base of the wall\n\nThe temple complex has two closed mandapas with 13 and 9 bays respectively. The oldest shrine is of Veera Narayana Swamy and is housed in the sanctum of the inner mandapam. Theouter mandapam has the shrines of Lord Krishna (called Gopal Krishna as He is holding a flute) and Yoga Narasimha and are opposite to each other. The outer hall is replete with several pillars which are bell shaped. The figures that stand out are the ones of Krishna dancing on Kaliya, and of Garuda. The central shrine has an idol of Veera Narayana, with four arms, standing on a lotus. This figure is eight foot tall. This is the central shrine, and the oldest.\n\nThe northern shrine has a seven foot tall idol of Yoganarasimha in a sitting posture, holding the Shanka and Chakra, with Sridevi and Bhoodevi standing on either side. The Prabhavati is carved with the ten avatars of Vishnu.\n\nThe southern shrine has an enchanting eight foot image of Venugopala Krishna, standing with his right leg in front of his left leg, leaning against a tree, is blissfully playing his flute. He is surrounded by various figures – Shravan Kumaras with folded hands, Gopikas, who are so lost in the music that one has forgotten to cover herself properly, a cow feeding her calf, lost in the music, Gopalas who are dancing to the Venu Gana. On either side of Venu Gopala stand Rukmini and Satyabhama.\n\nThe halls are filled with ancient idols and relics that reflect a glorious past. The cielings have ornate carvings and detailed patterns that are testimony to the superior craftsmanship that existed during those times.\n\nThe outer walls of the temple are adorned with intricate carvings and running pilasters withequally grand towers on top. The sculptures are a treat for the eyes with the camera doing littlejustice to the splendid work on display..\n\nOne of the most unique properties of this temple is that on 23rd March (Equinox) each year, themorning rays of the sun fall directly on the Garbagriha from the entrance door, which is at a distance of 270 feet.\n\nThough I had contacted Archakar one day before, he locked the temple and went away on his private work Prashant Bharadwaj – Bhattar 9449707098. Temple timings are : 8am to 6pm. 2pm to 4 pm closed\n\n4.3 Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple, Javagal\n\nSri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple.573125, Javagal, Karnataka 573125 Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy Temple.is located at Javagal, Karnataka at a distance of 225 kms from Bangalore and 20 km from Halebidu is a 13th century Hoysala era temple gem and is the ancestral village of Indian cricketer Javagal Srinath. Daily puja, mangalarti and archana is offered in the temple.Contact Srivatsan Bhattar, Mob: 9448894575\n\nIt is a Trikuta temple – the main deity of this temple is Sridhara. The other two shrines are dedicated to Venugopala and Lakshmi Narasimha . As the main deity of this temple is Sridhara, some people also refer this temple to as Sridhara templeIt was completed between 1250–1260 A.D. by King Vira Someshwara of the Hoysala Empire. This temple is a protected monument under the Karnataka state division of the Archaeological Survey of India.\n\nThe temple is a compact illustration of a square plan typical of Hindu temple architecture, but one where the three sanctums share a common mandapa (hall). These sanctums are dedicated to Lakshminarasimha, Sridhara and Venugopala. It is notable for its lavish artwork consisting of over 100 panels, all intricately carved both outside and inside. Many of these panels depict legends from the Ramayana.\n\nLike most Hoysala era temples, the Lakshmi Narasimha temple at Javagal stands on a jagati (raised platform), beautiful moulding friezes and sculptures on the outer walls and lathe turned pillars, sukanasi and garbha griha on the inside. Where it differs from the other temples is that even though it is home to three shrines, it has only one shikhara. And its outer wall panel sculptures, reliefs and friezes are folkish in character and much different from the other Hoysala temples where the work is more intricate, well planned and laid out.\n\nThe temple plan is square, similar to other Hoysala temples. It is a trikuta (three shrined) temple, one where only the middle shrine has a superstructure (tower or shikhara) and a sukhanasi (nose or tower over the vestibule) The three equal size shrines are all square in plan and are connected by a common closed hall (mantapa). The closed hall is preceded by an open porch. The lateral shrines are connected directly to the hall while the middle shrine has a vestibule that connects the sanctum (cella) to the hall.\n\nThe temple stands on a platform (jagati), a feature common to many Hoysala temples. The platform, in addition to its visual appeal, is meant to provide devotees a path for circumambulation (pradakshinapatha) around the temple. It closely follows the outline of the temple, giving it a good elevated look.\n\nWhile entering the temple, one sees a mantapa with two elephant balustrades that were built in the Vijayanagara period. Then, one is greeted by a Garuda sthamba, two dwarapalas Jaya and Vijaya and then the ranga mantapa with the lathe turned pillars. From here, one can enter the main temple complex and its three shrines. If one stands in the vestibule, straight ahead would be the sukanasi and the garbha griha of Sridhara, to your left would be the shrine of Venugopala and to your right would be the shrine of Lakshmi Narasimha. The sukanasi and the vestibule connecting the 3 shrines have beautiful carvings, ceiling work and sculptures.\n\nOn the outside of the temple, as one takes a clockwise pradakshinam (circumambulation), one will notice the six equal width rectangular moldings or friezes close to your feet. Staring from the top, these friezes depict hansa (birds), makara (crocodiles), Hindu epics and other stories, leafy scrolls, horses and elephants. Right above these friezes, you will see close to 140 beautifully carved sculptures that include Chaturvimsati murtis (24 different aspects of Lord Maha Vishnu), Hari hara, Brahma, Goddess Parvati, Tandav Ganesha and more. Most of these sculptures were sculpted by the famous Hoysala temple artisan Mallitamma. To return to the Index of Contents, Click Here.

It was built to compete with the Chennakesava temple which was under construction as a Vaishnava temple. The Hoysaleswara Temple is surrounded by ponds, mantapas and lakes. It is well known for the sculptures and architecture of Hoysala period.\n\nHalebidu temple is another great example of temple architecture the twin temples of Hoysaleshwara, Kedareshwara built by Vishnuvardhana and Ballala-II at Halabidu.

The 4 Madanika figures (striking elegant dancing poses) on the wonderfully engraved columns of Navaranga are unique creations of Hoysala workmanship. The Garbhagriha is stellar in shape and its zigzag walls make the figures of 24 forms of Vishnu look different at different times of the day due to light.\n\nThe temple was built by master craftsmen – Dasoja and Chavana, a father and son duo, hailing from Balliganve, a centre of Kalyana Chalukya art in Shimoga district. It is said that Shantaladevi, the accomplished queen of King Vishnuvardhana is the model for one of the sculptures in the Vavaranga – Darpana Sundari. This work of art alone, speaks for the beauty of the magnificient temple. The temples of Kappe Chennigaraya, Soumyanayaki, Andal and other Vaishnava manifestations surround this main temple.

In Hindu scriptures, this place was called as Yamalapuri. These two rivers viz., Thunga and Bhadra originate in Varaha Mountains in Sahyadri range of Western ghats, encircle the village Kudali and flow as a confluent thereafter. This is why this place is known as Kudali, which means confluence of two rivers.\n\nAs per Legend, Srimachhankara Bhagavatpada defeated Mandana Mishra believed to be the incarnation of Brahma and his wife Ubhayabharati, incarnation of godess Saraswathi, in a debate. As per the terms of the debate, defeatist Mandana Mishra renounced the world and became the disciple of Sri Shankara and was renamed as Sureshwaracharya. Ubhayabharati decided to return to her world since Mandana Mishra renowned the world. At that moment Sri Shankara bonded her with Vanadurga verses and prayed her to settle down at the proposed Dakshinamnaya Peetham in the south.\n\nShe consented to the request with a condition that she would be following Sri Shankara, but would not move further if he looks back. At Kudali Sangam, since the Acharya did not hear the sounds of the auklet bells of Ubhayabharati, he looked back with anxiety. The next moment Ubhayabharati stood her grounds as if rooted as per the terms of agreement. Since then she has settled down in that very place and is being worshipped as Sharadadevi.\n\nFrom this unexpected incident, as Sharadadevi decided to stay at Kudali, the Acharya again prayed her to go along with him to Sringeri. Accepting his request, Sharadadevi agreed to reside in Sringeri with complete grace only during Navaratri festival and symbolically on other days. Accordingly, even as on now, Sharada is in a sitting posture in Sringeri.\n\nSri Adishankara established four monasteries in the four directions of the country and assigned a pontiff to each one of them for the smooth functioning of Vaidika dharmoddhara work. In the south, he established Sharadapeetha at Sringeri for the Propagation of Yajurveda and assigned this responsibility to Sri Sureshwaracharya, who thus became the First pontiff.\n\nUnder this tradition, Sri Narasimha Bharati III enthroned the peetha at Sringeri as 46th Pontiff in 1546. From 1546 to 1556, he stayed at Sringeri, looking after the responsibilities of Sharada Peetha. In between, as per the tradition of the mutt he selected a disciple, induced him to renunciation initiation and christened him as, “ Sri Vidyaranya Bharati Swamigalu”.\n\nThe senior swamiji then decided to visit all the holy places and left Sringeri in Nala Samvatsara in 1557AD, on a pilgrimage. The senior pontiff, visited several holy places and spent almost 20 years in pilgrimage. Back in Sringeri, the concerned did not get any message about the whereabouts of the senior pontiff for almost 12 years. During this period, there was fall of Vijayanagar Empire. This brought problems to Sringeri mutt and to its properties. Due to the misunderstanding between the locals and the junior swamiji, he left Sringeri to Kudali where he started living in the old mutt.\n\nThereafter, the management of the mutt and a few leaders thought that the absence of a pontiff is an insult to the mutt and hence brought a new person to head the mutt and christened him as Sri Ramachandra Bharati Swamiji and accepted him as their guru.\n\nIn 1576 Sri Narasimha Bharati III while returning to Sringeri after 20 years of pilgrimage, ouched Kudali and rested there. Surprisingly, he met his disciple and the successor Sri Vidyaranya Bharati Swamigalu, to whom he had handed over the reins of the mutt at Sringeri, and learnt all the developments. Since this was the place where Sharadamba first stayed, he decided to stay there and did so accordingly.\n\nThe chieftain of Basavapattana Sri Hanumappa Nayak got built a big building for the mutt and temple to Sri Vidyashankara and also donated fertile lands. the followers of the mutt established Dakshinamnaya Sri Jagadguru Sharadapeetham in Kudali permanently on 22.10.1576,\n\n5.2.2 Tunga bhadra sangama Kudli\n\nTunga bhadra sangama Kudli, 2M5F+6X8, Kudli, Karnataka 577227 Tunga bhadra sangama Kudli Karnataka is located at , Kudli, Karnataka at a distance of 300 kms from Bangalore and 18 kms from Shimoga.\n\nRiver Tunga enters the village from south and flows westwards.
