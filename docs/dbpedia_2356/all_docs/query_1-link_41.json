        "text": "The Konark Sun Temple, located in Odisha, India, is a 13th-century CE marvel dedicated to the Hindu Sun-god Surya. Built around 1250 CE by King Narasimhadeva I of the Eastern Ganga dynasty, this architectural masterpiece symbolizes a grand stone chariot with 24 wheels and seven horses, representing the chariot of Surya. Originally towering over 200 feet, much of the temple now lies in ruins, including the main tower, while the audience hall remains standing. Famous for its intricate sculptures, including erotic art, the temple showcases the Odisha style of architecture. The cause of its destruction remains a subject of debate, with theories suggesting damage by natural forces or destruction by invaders. Known as the \"Black Pagoda\" to early European sailors, it served as a navigational landmark alongside Puri's Jagannath Temple, the \"White Pagoda\". Partially restored during British India, it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984, attracting pilgrims and tourists, especially during the Chandrabhaga Mela. The temple's image is featured on the Indian 10 rupee note, underscoring its cultural significance. The name \"Konark\" derives from \"Kona\" (corner or angle) and \"Arka\" (sun), indicating its dedication to the sun god Surya, who is depicted in Vedic iconography as riding a chariot across the sky. The temple complex, though primarily in ruins, remains a testament to ancient Indian architecture and artistry. #IndianKnowledgeSystems #IndianKnowledgeForum #templesofindia #hindutemple #india\n\nUMAMAHESWARA ON WEST WALL OF THE SAHASRALINGA TEMPLE ( 10TH TO 11TH CENTURY CE ) CHANDPUR, LALITPUR, UTTAR PRADESH. Uma is seated on the left lap of Shiva who is four-armed, holding Trishula and Naga in upper arms and Matulunga in right normal arm. The left normal hand is seen in Kucha Sparsa Mudra.Beneath them Vahanas of both are shown. Rishava looks up to his master and the Lion seems to be at ease at Uma's foot. A dancing figure shown below them could be Skanda. Inside the Lalitpur Range Forest of Lalitpur District of UP, is the Chandpur Jahajpur Group of Temples. These temples are millennia old structures that have been badly damaged by various forces to be so neglected that the forest had engulfed them until rediscovered about a 100 years ago. For the lack of knowledge of this cluster's original name, this group is being referred as the Chandpur Jahajpur Group of Temples after the name of the nearest village. Here scattered inside the forest are the remains of structures dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu and the Jain deities. A total of 6 complexes exist within shouting distance of each other. This area is at a distance of about 15 kms from the famous Gupta Era Dasavatar Temple of Deogarh. Comparing the sculptures found here with the masterpieces of Deogarh I would attribute their carvings to a later era. At the Shiva Temple complex of this group, there is an unusual iconographic representation of large Sahasra Linga (thousand lingas in one). Its uniqueness is due to four deities carved at the base from where the thousand tiny lingas begin to form a single phallic emblem. Source: Indian Heritage Ark\n\nINCREDIBLE INDIA !! SURVAYA KI GARHI Hidden in the vicinity of Shivpuri in Madhya Pradesh, is a small fortress, no less than a reservoir of architectural brilliance and that of cultural richness. The Survaya Ki Garhi is a hidden jewel of heritage in MP, important to the state. Located 20 km outside of Shivpuri, close to the Shivpuri–Jhansi Road, lies the small town called as Survaya Ki Garhi. A serene lake adds to the old-world charm of this small and quaint town. An ancient temple dedicated to Lord Shiva is also located in the town, hence making it historically significant. It used to be earlier known as ‘Saraswati Pattam’. With the new-age modern developments around the city, it is not difficult to feel like a tourist in Rome, when every turn leads to an ancient relic, right next to the modern buildings. While it is a small fort (garhi) complex with moat, it was originally a Hindu monastery that taught yoga! Allegedly, it was built by a local king known as Avantivarman for his guru Purandar, and was part of a 5 such monasteries in the area. It was partially destroyed by a local mughal chieftan and subsumed to make the current castle complex. One can clearly see the difference between the small stone pieces for later building as compared to the larger and less smooth ones used to construct the temples and the monastery building. It was apparently partially restored in 1916 by the Brits. The group of temples belong to the period of 10th-11th century. The Survaya ki Garhi, on the inside of it, hosts a group of temple & monastery fortress which was built much later, probably to prevent the invaders from destroying the temples. Among the treasure, the architecture pattern owes itself to the Kachchaphaghta style of early medieval India where theme of music, dance and demi-gods is visible in the gorgeous sculptures. The temples here are not huge, but the exquisite sculptures & carvings on the temples are breath-taking. Sculpture of Lord Ganesh is depicted on the column of the wall. #historicalplaces #traveller #incredibleindia #travelling #ancienthistory #ancient #photo #architecturelovers #culture #beautiful #trip Follow Satish Kakri\n\nAiravatesvara Temple’s Optical Illusion (Kumbakonam) The Airavatesvara temple complex, built by Rajaraja II, at Darasuram features a 24-m vimana and a stone image of Shiva. Among the intricate carvings dated between 1146 and 1170 is an elephant or a bull? After more than 900 years, it remains a key surviving example of Chola architecture and craftsmanship (a UNESCO World Heritage Site). But what makes the temple all the more exceptional is that within this craftsmanship is one of the world’s oldest optical illusions. The bas-relief depicts the two separate animal bodies, with their heads overlapping and merged to become one shared aspect of the two figures. This results in the visual trickery. When you solely focus on the left-hand animal, you will see a complete bull, including horns; however, when you focus solely on the right-hand animal, you will see a complete elephant, including a trunk. The Airavatesvara Shiva temple has a water tank, has a connected channel that brings in Cauveri River water where Hindus gather annually to take a dip. The local people narrates how Airavata ( Indra's malla) white elephant was restored to clean, white skin after he took a dip in this tank. While this is one of the most well-preserved examples of its age, similar images can be seen at the Vijaya Vittala Temple in Hampi as well as Rameshwaram Temple on Rameshwaram Island. This Hindu motif is thought by some to depict the half-male, half-female (Ardhanarishvara) form of Lord Shiva, while others similarly consider it to represent unity among the deities of Hindu faith. #sanatandharma #AiravatesvaraTemple #heritage #ancientindia #templesofindia #incredibleindia\n\nMallikarjuna temple (Kuruvatti, Bellary district) Karnataka This temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, worshipped here as Mallikarjuna.

Exploring Advanced Technology in Ancient Civilizations on Earth. ?????????-----...........🤔 This remarkable sculpture can be found within the Palitana Jain Temples, situated atop the Shatrunjaya hills near Palitana in the Bhavnagar district of Gujarat, India 🇮🇳. It's not just a magnificent work of art; it also boasts a surprisingly intricate architectural design. On the left, you can observe a figure holding a Khartal, a musical instrument that produces sound by clapping sticks together. On the right, another figure is depicted inscribing something on a medieval-era clay tablet. Palitana is home to around 860 Jain temples, perched atop a remote, rocky hill. Though most are relatively small, they feature exquisite carvings, and some have a history dating back nearly a millennium. To reach these temples, one must ascend over 3,000 steps from the base to the mountain's summit, reflecting the belief in India that temples gain greater spiritual significance when they require considerable effort to reach.\"😊\n\nLet’s transport ourselves back to our early historic times where we live in a cave, carving it painstakingly!! We are here alluding to the beautiful Bedse Caves, carved out more than 2000 years back offer significant glimpses into our early world. Located near Pune, these caves hold a unique distinction as they are one of the few Theravada cave monuments in the region, dating back to the 1st century BCE. Unlike the more elaborate Mahayana caves found elsewhere, Bedse embodies the simplicity and austerity, a characteristic of Theravada Buddhism. The two main caves, a chaitya (prayer hall) and a vihara (monastery), showcase Theravada principles. The chaitya features a large stupa, a hemispherical structure representing the Buddha, but lacks the elaborate figural sculptures commonly seen in Mahayana caves. Similarly, the vihara exhibits a more functional design, with simple living quarters for monks rather than the ornate decorative elements found in Mahayana counterparts. Bedse caves, therefore, offer a glimpse into the early Theravada tradition, showcasing its focus on meditation and monastic life through their unadorned yet powerful presence. They stand as a testament to the diversity of Buddhist expression in ancient India. #PleachIndiaFoundation\n\nThe Parashurameshwara Temple in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, is a significant temple dedicated to Lord Shiva.

Each of them left their mark in the country. If you talk about the most prominent remnants of Indian history, the first thing that comes in mind are its majestic forts. Indulged into several historical tales, the forts are the live witness of the several royal legends. The stories of the Princely clans of the region are legends. These valiant rulers have been long gone but their legacy still lives. The important feature of architecture was the use of the arch, the dome, and the minaret. The Forts, Palaces, Mahals and Temples are reminiscences of the glories of the rulers. Forts are famous for their style, design, and material used like marble or red sandstone. The remnants of those times or the old historical monuments remind us of what our culture has been through and who influenced the historical events. The forts built by these ruling clans are magnificent specimens of military strategy, splendid beauty and historical value. The sheer brilliance of the marvelous monuments will inspire awe within you. There are approximately 1000 or more forts in India. Some of the famous ones that one should visit, the most splendid forts; Amber Fort (Jaipur), Junagarh Fort (Bikaner), Mehrangarh Fort (Jodhpur), Jaisalmer Fort, Gwalior Fort, Golkonda Fort (Hyderabad), Chittorgarh Fort, Jhansi Fort etc. You can discover many glorious aspects of the rich past of India through still existing magnificent forts. There are the 4 types of forts; major types of forts are hill forts, forest forts, sea forts and forts on plains. Forts were constructed for strategic purposes. Most of the forts in India are actually castles or fortresses. But when the British Government in India were cataloging them in the 17th–19th century they used the word forts as it was common in Britain then. Chittorgarh Fort is the largest fort in India covering 700 acres on top of a 590 ft hill, complete with towers and walls that have stood since the Maurya Empire rulers built it in the 7th century. Mehrangarh (Mehran Fort), Jodhpur, is also one largest forts. Built around 1460 by Rao Jodha, the fort is situated 410 feet (125 m) above the city and is enclosed by imposing thick walls. The Jaisalmer Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is India's only 'living' fort. Built in 1156 by the king Rawal Jaisal, the fort has a population of around 5,000 people, mostly descendants of Brahmin and Rajput families who once lived here. One of the finest architecture in Rajasthan, the Lohagarh fort or Iron Fort derives its name from the fact that it is one of the strongest castle ever made in history and could never be conquered, not even during the British rule. https://lnkd.in/g4szzC28 #fort #किला #किले #गढ़ #दुर्ग #लालकिला #unescoworldheritagesite #unescoheritage #UNESCO #Palace #fortofindia #incredibleindia🇮🇳\n\nThe Kailasa temple Ellora Caves, Maharashtra, India This is a megalith carved out of one single rock and is considered one of the most remarkable cave temples in the world because of its size, architecture and sculptural treatment. This temple is dedicated to Shiva. The Ramayana, Mahabharat, scenes from Hindu epics and Puranas is exquisitely carved here. Contrary to many other ancient rock structures, this temple complex was built from top to bottom rather than bottom to top. The job was done with no better tools than a chisel and hammer. Scaffolds were not used at all. Due to the size of the excavation and the splendour of the design, this cave is an unrivalled masterpiece of Indian architecture, the temple complex covering an area twice the size of the Parthenon in Athens. It is estimated that the artists removed three million cubic feet of stone, weighing approximately 200,000 tonnes, to excavate the temple. The rocks here is basalt, a hard, black volcanic rock. In 1682, Mughal islamic emperor Aurangzeb ordered the destruction of this magnificent temple. He sent 1,000 people to destroy the temple for three years. Although they were able to break and disfigure some statues, they were unable to destroy the main structure. But most of the paintings were destroyed and the carvings were significantly damaged.
