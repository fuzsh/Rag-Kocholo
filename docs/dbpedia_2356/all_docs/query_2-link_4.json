        "text": "It is an architectural wonder to see the old temple structures in Karnataka’s Hassan district. The Chennakesava Temple, located in the village of Belur, is one of the most impressive specimens of Hoysala architecture in the world (Also Chennakeshava). In the 12th century the temple was made by the Hoysala prince, Vishnuvardhana, when the town of Belur served as the capital of the Hoysala state. The temple is dedicated to the god Shiva. Since the Hoysalas ruled over the region for more than three centuries, pilgrims from all over the region have flocked to the Chennakesava Temple in Belur to marvel at the intricate works of art and sculpture on display to experience the site’s spiritual charm from a bygone era.\n\nHistory of Belur Chennakeshava Temple\n\nChennakeshav Temple, the most prominent monument in the Hoysala dynasty, is said to be connected to the military successes of King Vishnuvardhana, who ruled the country from 1117 to 1117 AD. The monarch had fought against the Western Chalukyas and the Cholas, both of whom he had vanquished in combat. Following a gathering of the best architects and artists in the country, it was decided to establish new designs and styles that would become the trademark of the complex.\n\nThe Layout of Chennakesava Temple, Somanathapura\n\nA temple similar to Hassan, the Chennakeshava Temple in Belur is regarded as one of the country’s finest specimens of Hoysala architecture. A massive rajagopuram or gate archway rises above them as one approaches this gigantic tower. East is the most popular architectural orientation for temples, and the temple’s central feature is positioned in the middle, facing east.\n\nSmaller temples dedicated to the goddess Sowmyanayaki, a Lakshmi reincarnation, are found behind the Kappe Channigraya temple in a secluded location. Located to the left of the Chennakeshava temple, you’ll come upon the Ranganayaki Temple.\n\nIn addition to a pair of magnificent pillars portraying the Hindu god Garuda and a lamp, one of the temple’s most notable features is a fountain. The first and second are attributed to the Vijayanagara period, with the first being attributed to the Hoysala period in between.\n\nThe Architecture of Chennakesava Temple, Somanathapura\n\nThe Chennakesava temple, made of soapstone and based on Hoysala architecture, has a highly detailed finish that is reminiscent of the Hoysala period. Because of its vast grandeur, this temple is considered to be one of the first creations of the Hoysala dynasty’s reign. At its tallest point, the temple towers 37 metres above the ground. On the outside of the building, there are depictions of dancers in various stances.\n\nArt of Chennakesava Temple, Somanathapura\n\nThere are some of the finest examples of sculpture and art in the entire complex on the temple’s pillars. One of the most well-known temple pillars is the Narasimha pillar. There are 48 pillars in total, each with its own carvings and decorations. Madanikas, or celestial damsels, are depicted on the four central pillars. Tourists and art enthusiasts alike are drawn to the lady with a parrot and the huntress, two of the most popular madanikas in the world.\n\nYou can uncover several references to the Mahabharata and Ramayana if you pay attention to the minutiae of the temple’s wall carvings. You’ll see hints of sexiness tucked away among the fine details if you look closely. Horses, elephants, and lions are frequently depicted in wall sculptures.\n\nMantapa doorways depict the Hoysala King slaying what scholars believe to be either a Tiger or Lion, which is shown in the temple. A tiger, the regal emblem of the Cholas, is also said to symbolise their defeat. The Temple’s enormous complex has a number of other significant works of art. The Gajasura Samhara (a sculpture of Lord Shiva), a sculpture of Ravana, a sculpture of Durga defeated Mahishasura, and several others are examples of this type of artwork. There are also a number of smaller shrines at the temple’s entrance. Furthermore, we can learn about the lifestyle and culture of the Hoysala period by studying the signatures left by the painters of the period on these various sculptures.\n\nArtists\n\nSome Hoysala artists used inscriptions to sign their work. They also gave information about themselves, their families, guilds, and origins. Inscriptions on stone and copper plates tell more about them. Ruvari Mallitamma was a talented artist who created over 40 sculptures. Dasoja and Chavana, from Balligavi in modern Shimoga, made significant contributions. Chavana is credited with five madanikas and Dasoja with four. Malliyanna and Nagoja sculpted birds and creatures. Some of the sculptures in the mantapa are attributed to Chikkahampa and Malloja. These painters also contributed to other prominent Hoysala temples within 50 km of Belur.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Hoysala Dynasty played a significant role in developing the region known as Karnataka, and they made significant cultural contributions. A journey to this dynamic state would be completed without taking in the scale of the architecture, the intricate details, and the inventive styles that are associated with the Chennakeshava temple.\n\nThis complex of structures, which recently marked its 900th anniversary of existence, has witnessed the numerous faces and layers of Karnataka’s rich and varied history. It presently rests peacefully and majestically on the banks of the Yagachi River, providing as a focal point for visitors and a continual reminder of the enduring legacy left by one of South India’s most powerful kingdoms, the Cholas."
