While researching into the history and significance of the Belur-Halebid temples, I came across quite a few interesting websites, including the superb travelogue by our own TBHPian @akbaree\n\n@akbaree had recommended a book titled 'A complete guide to Hoysala Temples by Gerard Foekema' which is a good and comprehensive source of information on Hoysala temple architecture. Unfortunately I could not buy the book since it was out of stock in the shops I checked with. However, significant portions of the book are available via Google-books. [The maps and some sections are not available online]\n\nTo quote from the book:\n\nQuote:\n\nMore than a hundred of Hoysala temples survive today, and I think more than 10 of them to be of interest to the average tourist. The most important message I have to convey is that the large temples in Belur and Halebid give a marvelous impression of Hoysala sculpture, but only a poor impression of Hoysala architecture, because they are seriously incomplete. Visiting a few other villages in the neighborhood of Belur and Halebid is very rewarding, because there smaller but complete temples can be found. Several of these small and modest temples perfectly show the logic and beauty of Hoysala architecture...\n\nThe thought of covering all the temples listed in the book was quite appealing. I looked up these places in the Eicher & TTK road maps and found that not all of them are marked. I filled in the gaps by looking up these places on G-maps, Mapmyindia and also by reading up directions to these places on different websites.\n\nSlowly the route started to take shape. Of the places mentioned in the book, we dropped Amritapura & Basaralu since they would involve too much of a deviation from our route plan. [which is why my log is titled 'an incomplete guide to...']\n\n13 out of the 15 places from the book were penciled in. Also, there are several other places, which also have beautiful Hoysala temples, but are not mentioned in the book... added in a couple of those as well, ending up with a list of 17 places to be covered.\n\nThe list of places we visited over the three days:\n\nDay 1\n\nTuruvekere\n\nAralaguppe\n\nArsikere\n\nHaranhalli\n\n(Overnight stay at Halebid.)\n\nDay 2\n\nHalebid\n\nHulikere\n\nBelvadi\n\nJavagallu\n\nBelur\n\nDodda Gadduvalli\n\nKoravangala\n\n(Overnight stay at Hassan)\n\nDay 3\n\nMosale\n\nNuggehalli\n\nGovindanahalli\n\nKikkeri\n\nHosaholalu\n\nSomanathapur\n\nTo be continued with pics and comments...\n\nLast edited by hotstuff : 2nd April 2009 at 03:06.\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Dec 2008\n\nLocation: Campus @ IIMA !\n\nPosts: 368\n\nThanked: 120 Times\n\nTuruvekere & Aralaguppe...\n\nWho were the Hoysalas?\n\nIn a chronological context, Karnataka was ruled over by the following kingdoms:\n\nPre-historic age.\n\nEarly years Satavahanas\n\n325 A.D.- 540 A.D. Kadambas of Banavasi\n\n325 A.D.- 999 A.D. Gangas of Talkad\n\n500 A.D. - 757 A.D. Chalukyas of Badami\n\n757 A.D. - 973 A.D. Rashrakootas\n\n973 A.D. - 1198 A.D.

Wodeyars of Mysore\n\n1956 Present day Karnataka is formed.\n\nTo quote from the Wikipedia:\n\nQuote:\n\nThe Hoysala Empire was a prominent South Indian Kannadiga empire that ruled most of the modern day state of Karnataka between the 10th and the 14th centuries. The capital of the Hoysalas was initially located at Belur but was later moved to Halebidu.\n\nThe Hoysala rulers were originally hill people of Malnad Karnataka, an elevated region in the Western Ghats range. In the 12th century, taking advantage of the internecine warfare between the then ruling Western Chalukyas and Kalachuri kingdoms, they annexed areas of present day Karnataka and the fertile areas north of the Kaveri River delta in present day Tamil Nadu. By the 13th century, they governed most of present-day Karnataka, parts of Tamil Nadu and parts of western Andhra Pradesh in Deccan India.\n\nThe Hoysala era was an important period in the development of art, architecture, and religion in South India. The empire is remembered today primarily for its temple architecture. Over a hundred surviving temples are scattered across Karnataka, including the well known Chennakesava Temple at Belur, the Hoysaleswara Temple at Halebidu, and the Kesava Temple at Somanathapura.\n\nThe Hoysala rulers also patronized the fine arts, encouraging literature to flourish in Kannada and Sanskrit.\n\nWikipedia also has a good write-up about Hoysala architecture:\n\nHoysala architecture - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nMore than a 1000 temples were probably built during the Hoysala period. However only a few have survived relatively intact to this day. Some were just abandoned and disintegrated over the centuries; some were renovated and rebuilt to an extent that they no longer resemble their original design.\n\nOf the temples that survived, around 20 temples are recommended as 'must see' for anyone interested in Hoysala architecture. Our trip was planned to cover most of these temples...\n\nThe planning:\n\n[1] First we listed down the places to cover and the temples to see at each place.\n\n[2] Charted out the places on a rough map to give us an idea of the order in which to cover these places.\n\n[3] We decided that our first night-halt would be at Halebidu and the second night-halt would be at Hassan.\n\nAs you start seeing the pics, you might feel that many temples look quite similar... yes, they do. While the overall architecture might follow some standard patterns, what differentiate the temples are the carvings on the walls, the level of intricacy in the design etc. So each temple is different if you observe it from close quarters.\n\nMost of these temples either have guides, caretakers or priests who can walk you through the temples and explain the significance of each.\n\nThe trip:\n\nWe planned to make an early morning start, but both of us could wind-up only close to 11pm the previous evening and by the time packing is done and we fall asleep, it is around 2am. So, we wake up at 6.30am and finally start off at around 7.30am.\n\nSaturday morning traffic was light and we reached Nelamangala without any trouble and took the right turn towards Kunigal. On our previous drive along this road ( http://www.team-bhp.com/forum/travel...-highways.html ) we had seen that there are some good hotels after Kunigal where we could stop for breakfast.\n\nI will not delve into the specifics of the route since the map should give you a good idea about the location of each place and we did a lot of 'stop-and-ask' throughout the trip to find our way around.\n\nSpotted this scenic archway along the way...\n\nThe route to Turuvekere, our first place to see...\n\nGreen...\n\nTURUVEKERE\n\nWe enter Turuvekere!\n\nIn Turuvekere we covered three temples, the Chennakesava temple, the Moole Shankara temple and the Gangadhareeshwara temple.\n\nChennakesava temple...\n\nNext we headed towards the Moole Shankara temple and found that it was locked. We asked around to see who had the key and were directed towards a nearby house. After enquiring about where we were from and our interest in the temple, they offered us some coffee and snacks and then just handed us the keys to the temple!\n\nThe Moole Shankara temple...\n\nHmmm... This is the first time we unlocked a temple!\n\nWe spent some time here, locked the temple again, handed over the keys and proceeded towards the Gangadhareeshwara temple...\n\nThe Nandi, which is around 7ft tall...\n\nA unique 'Stone bell'! You can actually strike it with a stick and it sounds like a normal bell!\n\nARALAGUPPE\n\nAfter Turuvekere, we proceeded towards Aralaguppe, though we knew that it was somewhere around, we asked some locals to guide us and they mentioned the route options and suggested the best route that would be kind on the Xing...\n\nOne 'unique' experience I had at this temple was being stung on my hand by a wasp. Nothing serious though...\n\nThe Keshava temple at Aralaguppe...\n\nIt was close to 2.00pm by the time we ready to leave from Aralaguppe, we would be driving through Tiptur on the way to our next destination, so lunch stop was at Tiptur."
