My question is what should I mention (college name or university name) in \"Name of school/institution\" field while creating my express entry profile? However ECA by WES only mention university name.\n\nIs there a separate option for University?\n\nNo. Here is screenshots. https://imgur.com/cyfet6D\n\nI just now checked in my express entry profile, it is the College Name and not the university name. All the best!\n\nI used the name of the university that awarded the degree to keep the ECA and the EE profile the same in terms of information provided.\n\nDid writing the name of the university work for you?\n\nDear I have same issue. I studied from XYZ university affiliated institute ABC. The degree is of XYZ but has institute ABC mentioned on it. I am yet to go for ECA. On WES list of universities, XYZ is mentioned but not the affiliated institute ABC. Is it okay? Should I go with WES?\n\nDear I have same issue.

Then in the address for that period of time, should I write the awarding institute city's address or the college in which I studied, the address of that should be added? I was not a resident of the awarding body's city for one day, so how should I convince through my application? The name of the city is also a part of the name of the awarding body's name. Really confused on this matter..... !!!!\n\nWhat if the awarding institute is in another city.

I am also confused same way\n\nWell for ECA I entered the name of the city in which the degree was awarded. That is the name of the city of the board. I am still at the ECA stage of the application, so I haven't further proceeded. However, on ECA, the education institute and the board's name both are mentioned by ICES.\n\nHi All,\n\nI have noticed that the University Name mentioned on WES report is different than University name on Degree Certificate . Which University name should I mention in 'Name of school/institution\" field' from WES or Degree Certificate . Also what is the city ( as my University and College Locations were different.\n\nPlease advise"
