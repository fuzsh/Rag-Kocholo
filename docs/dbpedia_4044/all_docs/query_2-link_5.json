        "text": "Congratulations on your student's admission to Lane College! We are excited for your student to join us at Lane. Over the next few years, you’re going to hear the word dragon a lot and we are proud to have your student as a Lane College Dragon. We’re also proud to have you as part of our Dragon family and this page will provide resources that you may find helpful as the parent and family of a new Lane student.\n\nFamilies of new students often have questions about the financial aid process, residential housing, dining plans, and a host of other topics. If this page doesn’t answer your question, we will. You may always call us at 731-426-7533 or email us at admissions@lanecollege.edu and we are happy to answer any question you may have.\n\nAs your student prepares to join Lane, we want to share information on the learning environment at Lane, our financial aid process, life on campus, our hometown, important dates to remember, and additional resources.\n\nThe thing we hear most from parents is “I never knew a private education was this different than public schools. This has changed our whole world. And I never knew it was so incredibly affordable.” We want you to say the same thing so please reach out to us as often as you need. We are happy to help.\n\nLEARNING AT LANE\n\nOne of the things that often makes Lane College a student’s HBCU of choice is our emphasis on experiential learning. Lane College students do not memorize textbooks and take a bunch of standardized tests. We think students learn best when they are having fun, so we’ve packed our curriculum with hands-on learning and fun experiences. The fun will begin from their first day and we will continue to offer a full program of activities and events to make your student’s experience engaging and transformational.\n\nAs you may know, our classes are small and offer one-on-one opportunities for research and engagement. Many classes will only have about a dozen students and our classes are taught by teachers committed to delivering an exceptional private HBCU education – not graduate assistants.\n\nWe offer more person-to-person support than most schools. That means more one-on-one support for your student in learning labs, health and counseling services, spiritual guidance activities, and career planning. It also means more one-on-one support for you as you have questions or concerns.\n\nOUR FINANCIAL AID PROCESS\n\nMost Lane students receive financial aid, and we will help you with each step of the financial aid process. You can follow the link below to learn more about FASFA and the financial aid process.\n\nThe financial aid process can seem daunting, but we have experts who can help you each step of the way. As you have questions, please email us at FinancialAid@lanecollege.edu or call us at 731-426-7602. You can talk to a financial aid counselor who will explain how we make Lane College incredibly affordable.\n\nLANE LIFE\n\nTwo questions we hear most often from parents of new students are “Where will my student live?” and “Where will my student eat?” Don’t worry, we’ve got both of these covered.\n\nA dozen residence halls and living communities have been created to give your student a safe place to live and learn. We have a lot of different options. Some halls are single-sex and others are co-ed. Other residential options are designed as living communities and are built around shared interests. Our residence halls are more than a place for your student to rest their head. Our residence halls offer convenience, comfort, a place to study, and provide 24-hour security with resident assistants and frequent social activities.\n\nThere is nothing like Mama’s cooking, but we get as close as we can. Whether it’s fried fish and spaghetti or a vegetarian diet, we take our dining operations seriously. From traditional soul food to internationally inspired menus, we provide a variety of options seven days a week and from morning until night. We also provide a free community pantry for students to stock up on snacks and midnight essentials.\n\nA comfortable place to live and something delicious to eat is just the beginning of campus life at Lane. There are over a hundred student clubs and organizations, NCAA varsity sports, as well as professional development and networking opportunities. We know college is about more than just getting a diploma, and we have a full calendar of social activities for your student to discover the power of their potential.\n\nWe know that nothing matters if we can’t keep your student safe. In addition to residential life, dining services, and campus life activities, we believe our safety protocols are among the best. We have dedicated 24/7 security operations and are designated as a LiveSafe campus. Your student will have access to our LiveSafe Dashboard on their phone and will be able to access a variety of services to keep them safe. We also have access to medical staff on-campus and at no charge and operate a comprehensive wellness program throughout the year.\n\nOUR TENNESSEE HOME\n\nLife is easier in Tennessee and we are proud to call Jackson, Tennessee our hometown. Tennessee is a state of rolling hills, beautiful foliage, distinct seasons, relaxed affordability and enduring civil rights. Centered a short distance between the musical meccas of Memphis and Nashville, Jackson is the perfect mix of town and country, historic town square and progressive city, community block party and city festival. Jackson is a true college town with six colleges operating a short drive from the town center. A community focused on a safe and affordable undergraduate education, Jackson is a town of friendly people. With hundreds of restaurants, eateries, and lots of excursion opportunities, the possibilities abound with things to do. Tree-lined streets of stately older homes are combined with modern loft-style apartments. There’s an active community recreation department that hosts festivals, parades and outings; live community theatre; vibrant church communities; and a flourishing calendar of activities. There is always something to do. Jackson is one of Tennessee’s larger and more progressive cities, but maintains a distinctive and gentile southern charm that allows it to provide an exceptional college experience. In short, it’s the perfect choice for an undergraduate education.\n\nIMPORTANT DATES TO REMEMBER\n\nWith dozens of activities on the campus daily, it can be hard to keep track of everything happening on campus. Here are dates that are especially important to parents of new students.\n\nJune 5 - New Student Orientation\n\nJune 7 - Dragon Academy Begins\n\nJune 14 - Summer II Classes Begin\n\nJune 26 - New Student Orientation\n\nJuly 31 - Housing/Residential Life Move-in Begins\n\nAug. 2 - Classes Begin for First Time Students\n\nAug. 6 - Classes Begin for Returning & Transfer Students\n\nAug. 20 - Last Day to Initiate and Complete Registration\n\nSept. 30 - Fall Break\n\nNov. 20 - Jan. 4 - Christmas Break\n\nRESOURCES\n\nWe know that student success improves when you engage appropriately in your student’s college experience. We also know that gathering resources can be a daunting task. We’ve compiled a list of resources to help. Please take some time to learn about the campus resources that help your student navigate the challenges and successes of college life. If you don’t see what you are looking for, we’re just a call or email away. Contact us at admissions@lanecollege.edu or call us at 731-426-7533."
