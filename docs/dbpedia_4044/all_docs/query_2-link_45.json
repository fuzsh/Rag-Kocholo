I would not have been able to be in this position without you and the CTC program. I'm looking forward to my final semester and closing this chapter. The Homeland Security and Emergency Management program is excellent and I'm glad that I chose CTC for it.\n\nWhy CTC\n\nCTC is an exceptional college. I started there with my ESL classes and now I'm finishing my associates. I'm so proud to be a CTC student. I love all my professors. The only problem is that I'm going to miss my college and all the staff so much when I'm done with my major. Thank you CTC.\n\nWhy CTC\n\nGraduated in May of 2015 after being out of school for 17 years. Love the online classes, made it real easy to get my degree since I also work full time. Just re-enrolled to get a second Associates degree."
