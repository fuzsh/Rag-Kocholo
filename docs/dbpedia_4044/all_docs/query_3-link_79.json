        "text": "Some parents of college-bound teens overweight a college’s name. Giving substantial weight to a name is OK for students who have a reasonable chance of admission to Harvard, MIT, Stanford, etc. Being around that level of students for four years plus the career-door-opening diploma, and those institutions’ fully meeting financial need make those institutions a reasonable aspiration.\n\nThe concern is with parents and students who insist that less-selective institutions, especially large privates, are worth the money and, importantly, the sacrifices that many high school students make to help ensure their admission.\n\nWhy is that a problem? Because universities usually acquire their brand name heavily on factors having little to do with the quality of students’ experience or outcomes.\n\nFactors that build a university's brand but help students little\n\nResearch. A university’s reputation is enhanced by its research productivity. How does that color your judgment? Their PR departments trumpet their research findings to the media, and so you see those universities’ names again and again. That creates a positive impression of that university’s brand because few among the public separate a university's research results from its teaching results.\n\nUniversities may insist that good researchers make good teachers. But that contention is hard to support because researchers, by temperament, training, and rewards, are different from transformational teachers. For example, most successful researchers focus on a field’s cutting edge, usually esoterica of less value to students. Contrast that with the instructor who spends much time preparing for classes that teach students what they most need to know while guiding students to love learning and grow in critical thinking skills. So it’s little surprise that Ernest Boyer, the late president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, said, with tongue only partly in-cheek, “Winning the campus teaching award is the kiss of death when it comes to tenure.”\n\nLeviathan sports teams. Some universities build their brand because their sports teams are long-time powerhouses. Yes, it can be fun to root for a winning football or basketball team, but that shouldn’t unduly influence a student's choice of college.\n\nBeing private. Some people perceive a college as better if it’s private—the often untrue “you get what you pay for” meme. Examples of private colleges that also are perennial sports powerhouses: USC, Syracuse, and Gonzaga. In fact, because public colleges are heavily funded by our tax dollars, the actual amount that a college spends per student may be at least as great at similar-size public institutions.\n\nLarge size. Larger institutions are better known but may have grown large because of factors having little to do with the student experience: They’re located in a populous area or are older and so have had longer to build their brand. Of course, size has advantages: for example, more choices of courses, professors, and extracurriculars; but also disadvantages: typically larger classes, bureaucracy, and lack of personal attention. It’s easy to get lost in the crowd.\n\nFactors more likely to enhance a college student’s success and happiness\n\nA student’s success and happiness at college often have more to do with who s/he is than on where s/he goes. For example, even if a college is well selected, a student is unlikely to be happy and successful there if unmotivated or viewing college as a chance to go wild away from parents’ watchful eyes.\n\nThat said, the following factors are likely to enhance your child’s college experience and outcomes:\n\nSelectivity. Some students thrive as the small fish in a selective pond, that is, where most of the college’s students are brighter and more motivated. The positive peer influence and higher level of instruction rub off. Other students do better as the big fish in the less selective pond: where they can do well without undue stress and studying, boosting their self-esteem and leaving ample time for extracurriculars. Looking back, many graduates believe their extracurriculars were more valuable than were their courses.\n\nToo many students who wouldn't be best off at the most selective college to which they could be admitted succumb to peer, parental, and even counselor pressure to do unpleasant, developmentally dubious activities to get into the most selective college possible. For example, they may take an expensive, time-consuming SAT preparation course, the SAT three times, and a course schedule filled with Advanced Placement (college-level) classes even though that schedule requires so much studying that valuable extracurriculars, let alone a personal life, suffer. They might take up a rarely beloved musical instrument like tuba or wake in the cold pre-dawn to row crew. Some parents hire pricey consultants to primp and too often heavily edit their child’s college applications.\n\nParents who push all that may be teaching their kids a bad lesson: that it’s worth making these sacrifices to get a designer label, even when the cost-benefit of that label, like that of designer-label clothes, is far from clear.\n\nAnd if all that effort “succeeds” and the student gets admitted to the most selective institution possible, s/he’ll likely have to continue grinding to get reasonable grades, again thus being deprived of what are often more valuable experiences such as being a peer counselor, leadership in student government or clubs, hosting a show on the campus radio or TV station, or writing for the student newspaper.\n\nLocale. Some students do better in warm weather, others in a four-season climate. Some are wise to attend a college within laundry distance of home while others, for example, those with over-controlling parents, are wise to go further away.\n\nPolitics: Some students are better off at a college with a decidedly liberal or conservative culture. A review of the data co-authored by a liberal and a conservative found that at most colleges, faculty is overwhelmingly liberal, and student bodies are liberal but less so. That said, a small percentage of distinctly conservative colleges remain, for example, Hillsdale and some religious colleges.\n\nCost: The rich might be able to afford the sticker price even of private colleges ($300,000 for four years and many students take longer) even for more than one child, even including graduate school. But even they should consider the opportunity cost: Might some of that money be better spent?\n\nBut for the not rich, cost matters, a lot. Much financial aid is not grant but loan, which of course must be paid back with interest. And college loans are among the few that cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. A smart option, even for many bright, motivated students, is to start at a community college, where instruction tends to be, surprisingly, better. Then transfer to an in-state public university chosen on the criteria above and perhaps on it having the desired major.\n\nThe COVID Wild Card\n\nOf course, with Omicron accelerating, all bets could be off. Remote teaching and too often non-learning, and eviscerated extracurricular opportunities could make deferring college a wise choice. That has long been worth considering: After 13 years (K-12) of being chained to a student desk, many students could use a year in the real world, perhaps spending a few months in a structured interim-year travel program and then working as an “intern” in a family member’s or their friend’s place of employment. The student often then resumes education with renewed interest and, often, a career they’re eager to pursue.\n\nThe takeaway\n\nSociety venerates labels and with a purchase like college, whose quality is difficult to assess and is perceived of high importance, it's hard to buck the norm. After all, few teens or parents would find it easy to tell friends, “Oh, my child was an A student but is going to start at community college.” But wisdom requires pitting the value of a college’s name against the core criterion: What is a wise use of the college-bound student’s time and the family’s money?"
