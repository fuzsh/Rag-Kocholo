        "text": "Because Long Beach City College seeks to provide an inclusive and non-discriminatory environment, LBCC students, including transgender and gender non-conforming students, may opt to identify themselves with a preferred name that is different from their legal first name.\n\nA preferred name is a first name that may be used instead of a legal first name. As long as the use of this different name is not for the purpose of misrepresentation, LBCC allows students to use a first name different than the legal name on certain College records such as Class Rosters, Student Self-Service (Oracle), Canvas, Starfish, PeopleSoft email from Instructors.\n\nYour legal name must be used for financial aid documents and official academic transcripts. Note that this process will not change your name legally.\n\nLong Beach City College will permit any student who wishes to choose to identify themselves within LBCC information systems with a preferred name in place of their legal name. To change your preferred name, please follow these three simple steps:\n\nGo to your Viking Student System on the LBCC website.\n\nChoose your Primary or Preferred Name under Personal Information in the Student Center.\n\nClick Names and Add a New Name.\n\nClick here for instructions to change your Affirmed Name and/or Gender\n\nFor more information on the process please contact Enrollment Services.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow can I set my preferred name?\n\nUsing the My LBCC Viking Student System, go to the Student Account tile and click on the Update Profile Information link on the left side panel.\n\nClick on the Personal Details link.\n\nIf you do not currently have a Preferred name, click the Plus sign to add a preferred name.\n\nTo update your Preferred name, click on the Preferred name type. Edit the First Name field and click Save.\n\nTo no longer use your Preferred name, click on the Preferred name type. Enter your official name in the First Name field and click Save.\n\nThis update will be reflected throughout PeopleSoft immediately, while Starfish and Canvas will reflect the change within the day.\n\nWill I be able to get a new College Services/ID card with my preferred name?\n\nStudents updating their ID cards to reflect their gender identity may have a free one-time update of their ID card to reflect their preferred name.\n\nAre there special situations in which I cannot use my preferred name?\n\nThere may be some situations where it may be necessary to clarify that your preferred name is different from your legal name. Examples of this include official interactions with law enforcement, business processes, verification of medical records, academic transcripts and financial aid. At LBCC, your legal name will still be used for financial aid document and your official academic transcripts.\n\nMay I change my middle name or last name through this option?\n\nNo. This service only applies to first names.\n\nAre there any restrictions on my preferred first name?\n\nChoice of a preferred first name must be appropriate and cannot be an attempt at misrepresentation or fraud.\n\nCan I change my email address to better match my preferred name?\n\nWhile you cannot change your student ID log-in email, you may change your preferred email address at any time within your Viking Student System.\n\nCan I delete my preferred name?\n\nYes, the same way you added your preferred name within the Viking Student System, you can edit or delete it if you decide that you prefer to use your legal name at LBCC.\n\nTell me again, where will my preferred name be used at LBCC?\n\nYour preferred name will be used: on your student self-service records; Canvas; Starfish; PeopleSoft Delivered Roster; Grades and Attendance Roster; Print Roster and PeopleSoft Emails from Instructors. You can also update your LBCC student ID card.\n\nWhat if I want to make my preferred name my legal name?\n\nYou will need to do that via the Court system in the State of California. Please visit the California Courts website on Changing an Adultâ€™s Name for more information.\n\nAre there any restrictions on my preferred name?\n\nChoice of a preferred first name must be appropriate and cannot be an attempt at misrepresentation or fraud. Preferred names submitted that are considered offensive, obscene, lewd, or disruptive to the learning environment will not be approved."
