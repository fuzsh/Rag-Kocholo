        "text": "MCC is committed to fostering an inclusive campus environment where all students, faculty, and staff feel safe and welcomed to pursue their academic and professional goals. As an institution that strives to meet the needs of our diverse community, we encourage self-expression and are dedicated to a campus that is respectful and supportive of these inclusive ideals.\n\nChosen Names and Pronouns\n\nStudents, faculty, and staff of MCC may choose to identify themselves using a chosen name that differs from their legal name, except when an individual’s legal name is required by law, policy, or business needs.\n\nFor some, a chosen name is an important part of their identity and may align more closely to the person’s gender identity. Gender Identity is the concept of self as male, female, gender non-conforming, or other gender identities.\n\nFor others, a chosen name is a professional name and aligns more closely with a name used to achieve educational and professional status. Where technically feasible, a person’s chosen name will appear instead of, or in addition to their legal name in select college systems and documents. A chosen name is not required, and if it is not provided, a person’s legal name will be displayed.\n\nAdditionally, individuals may choose to provide MCC with pronouns. Pronouns indicate a person’s gender identity, and every attempt will be made to use these pronouns when addressing individuals.\n\nMCC defines each of the following name types:\n\nLegal Name:\n\nThe name recorded on official/legal identification, such as driver’s license, social security, or any other official government-issued identification card.\n\nChosen Name:\n\nThe name an individual wishes to be known by, different from a legal name. This is the name an individual has elected to be addressed by while at MCC.\n\nProfessional Name:\n\nA name that aligns with a person’s professional achievements and status\n\nNickname:\n\nA substitute, or abbreviation of a legal first name\n\nCommonly Used Pronouns:\n\nShe:\n\nA pronoun to use when someone’s identity is female (Her and Hers)\n\nHe:\n\nA pronoun to use when someone’s identity is male (Him and His)\n\nZe:\n\nA singular gender-neutral third-person pronoun used when someone’s gender is unknown or when the individual identifies as neither male or female (Hir and Hirs). Ze is pronounced “zee.” It can also be spelled zie or xe and can be used to replace she/he/they.\n\nThey:\n\nA common singular pronoun that encompasses all gender identities (Them and Their)\n\nNone:\n\nUse a person’s name in place of a pronoun\n\nExpectations for Chosen Names\n\nChosen names cannot be used for fraudulent or illegal purposes, or to misrepresent oneself.\n\nChanges to Chosen Name will be reviewed daily by the Records and Registration office.\n\nMCC reserves the right to deny requests for Chosen Names. Individuals whose Chosen Names are denied will have their name reverted to their Legal Name and will receive communication with further instructions/details. Any appeals to this decision will be referred to the Assistant Vice President of Student Affairs.\n\nUnder FERPA, a student’s name, including chosen name, may be disclosed to the public as directory information unless the student opts out. To revoke disclosure, please visit the MCC FERPA information page. The process and procedure to implement chosen names may be modified at the College’s discretion.\n\nHow to Provide a Chosen Name in Self-Service\n\nAccess Self-Service and select the username in the top right corner. Select User Profile, and Edit Personal Identity. Enter first, middle, and/or last name(s) that differ from your legal name, select pronouns, and select save."
