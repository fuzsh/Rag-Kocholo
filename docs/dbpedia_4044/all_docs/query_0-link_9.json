        "text": "Lane College was founded by the Christian Methodist Episcopal (CME) Church, one of the nation’s early black church denominations, in 1882. One of the church’s main priorities was establishing a school to educate the newly freed African Americans following the Civil War. Today, Lane College provides students with a profoundly transformative undergraduate education–intellectually, spiritually and socially–and has been for almost 150 years. They have nurtured business leaders and spiritual leaders, novelists, scientists, physicians, public servants, scholars and teachers in nearly every field of endeavor.\n\nFacilitated through the Institute for Capacity Building, the institution is now a UNCF cohort member in the HBCU Transformation Project, a first-of-its-kind effort to improve student enrollment, graduate success and institutional effectiveness rates at historically black colleges and universities."
