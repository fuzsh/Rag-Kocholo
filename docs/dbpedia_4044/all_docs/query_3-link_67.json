For legal name changes, see near the bottom of the page for how to tell Swarthmore about a legal name change.\n\nChosen names: Swarthmore College recognizes that some students may choose to use a name other than their legal name to identify themselves.\n\nThis policy is intended for those who have a reason for utilizing a chosen name instead of, or in addition to, their legal name, such as non-binary individuals, international students, and individuals in the process of gender transition. The lists below show where the chosen name can be used and where the legal name must be used.\n\nChosen Name\n\nAlumni Office records\n\nAthletic rosters\n\nClass rosters\n\nCollege ID (OneCard)\n\nCommencement program\n\nCygnet\n\nDiploma\n\nDash Directory\n\nDegree Candidate List\n\nEmail\n\nFaculty Advising Lists\n\nMoodle\n\nmySwarthmore login\n\nResidence Life Lists\n\nLegal Name\n\nFinancial Aid\n\nHealth Services\n\nPaycheck\n\nStudent Employment\n\nStudy Abroad documents\n\nTime entry\n\nTranscripts\n\nFor students who want their Swarthmore email userid to reflect their chosen name, it is possible but much more involved to change the network/email userid to follow the matching pattern for the chosen name. This would require scheduled down-time, so expect to work closely with the registrar on this.\n\nWe routinely use the chosen name on your college ID card because of its importance in the college social life. However, keep in mind that college id is potentially also voter id, you might need other id for that purpose.\n\nPlease be advised that because we use your legal name in the administrative computer, sometimes the legal name appears in an unexpected context. If it does and you would like it not to, the registrar can usually figure out how to use the chosen name in that context instead.\n\nIf you want to use your chosen name across the college, please contact the Gender and Sexuality Center, or the Registrar's Office staff. Either office is available in person or by email. Legal name changes: For students and recent alumni to change your legal name, the college, usually the Human Resources Department, will need to see your new social security card, or a photocopy of it, before we can change your legal name in the computer for your transcript, etc. Alumni also need to tell the Alumni Records Office. Please let the Registrar's Office guide you if you have any questions about which Swarthmore office to see.\n\nYou may speak with any of the deans about name changes and other support for students. Swarthmore is committed to creating inclusive, respectful, and supportive spaces for all students."
