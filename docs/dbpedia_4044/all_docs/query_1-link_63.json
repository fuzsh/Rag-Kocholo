        "text": "Please make all checks payable to The Ohio State University and include the student's name and OSU ID number in the Memo line. Failure to include this information with your payment may result in processing delays.\n\nSubmit your personal check payment to:\n\nThe Ohio State University\n\nPO Box 183248\n\nColumbus, OH 43218-3248\n\nPayments must be postmarked by the fee payment deadline in order to avoid late fees. Please allow 1-2 weeks from the time you send your payment for it to post to your account. All mailed payments are processed within 2-3 business days of receipt at the Office of the University Bursar.\n\nResources\n\nPrint a Payment Coupon from My Buckeye Link - coming soon!\n\nHow to Complete a Paper Check\n\nWe recommend contacting your College Savings Plan administrator to begin the withdrawal process at least 4 to 6 weeks prior to the fee payment deadline to ensure that funds are received by the fee payment deadline. As proof of enrollment for the term, you may submit to your plan administrator a copy of your statement of account.\n\nCollege Savings account payments should be made out to The Ohio State University. Each item sent should include the student's name and OSU ID number. Failure to include this information with your payment may result in processing delays.\n\nSubmit your 529 College Savings Plan payment to:\n\nThe Ohio State University - 529 Plan\n\nPO Box 183248\n\nColumbus, OH 43218-3248\n\nFor 529 payments sent via FedEx, UPS or other courier that requires a physical mailing address (non-PO Box), please use:\n\nThe Ohio State University - 529 Plan\n\n2nd Floor, Student Academic Services Building\n\n281 W. Lane Avenue\n\nColumbus, OH 43210\n\nPayments must be postmarked by the fee payment deadline in order to avoid late fees. 529 payments are not necessarily mailed the day you request the funds, as companies require processing time prior to mailing. We recommend initiating your 529 withdrawal 4-6 weeks prior to the fee payment deadline. All mailed payments are processed within 2-3 business days of receipt at the Office of the University Bursar.\n\nNote: if a refund is generated from excess 529 funds, it will be issued to the student.\n\nResources\n\nRequest Withdrawal from 529 College Savings Plan - coming soon!\n\nTo submit a check in person, please visit the secure payment drop box on the first floor of the Student Academic Services Building (across from the elevators). Your check should be made payable to The Ohio State University and include the student's name and OSU ID number in the memo line. Failure to include this information with your payment may result in processing delays.\n\nThe payment dropbox is regularly checked by a member of the Office of the University Bursar payment processing team.\n\nTOPP enrollment is optional. To participate, you must sign up each semester through your My Buckeye Link account. A $30 non-refundable enrollment fee is assessed each term you enroll and due with the first payment plan installment.\n\nWhen you enroll in TOPP, you automatically authorize any federal financial aid on your account to pay non-institutional charges that you may have incurred which are TOPP eligible (for example, Student Health Insurance).\n\nFor assistance with TOPP, please contact Buckeye Link.\n\nThe first TOPP installment and $30 enrollment fee are due at the semester fee payment deadline. Subsequent installments are due approximately every 30 days after the first installment. Installment due dates may fluctuate based on semester start dates. Please refer to your statement of account for exact due dates.\n\nSample TOPP Payment Installment Due Date Schedule\n\nSemester1st Install & Enrollment Fee2nd Install3rd Install4th InstallAutumnAugustSeptemberOctoberNovemberSpringDecember or JanuaryFebruaryMarchMarch or AprilSummerApril or MayJuneJuly\n\n-\n\nEnrollment in TOPP after the first installment due date may reduce the number of installments available for the term. For example, if you enroll in TOPP for Autumn semester after the first installment due date, your charges may split into three installments instead of four, resulting in a larger balance due per installment.\n\nIf you submit a paper check or electronic payment and it is returned from the bank, your balance will become immediately due. Additionally, your account may be subject to a $30 returned check charge. You will be notified via email if your payment has been returned. Reasons a payment could be returned include:\n\nAccount closed\n\nAccount cannot be located\n\nInsufficient funds in the account\n\nStop payment\n\nAdditional reasons a paper check payment could be returned include:\n\nNo signature\n\nUnauthorized signature\n\nCheck incorrectly written\n\nYou are encouraged to submit a replacement payment as soon as possible after you are notified of the return to avoid collections activity on your account. When you submit your new payment, please also include $30 for the returned check charge in addition to the original amount.\n\nIf you made your payment online and it was rejected for insufficient funds in the account, your ability to pay online in the future may be restricted. Please contact the Office of the University Bursar for additional information.\n\nMultiple instances of payments being returned from any bank may result in a hold being added to your student account. Your payment options may also be limited, requiring you to pay your bill using only certified funds (i.e., cashierâ€™s check or money order). If the situation requires it, further disciplinary action may also be taken."
