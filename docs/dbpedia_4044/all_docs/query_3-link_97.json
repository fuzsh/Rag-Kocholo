        "text": "What is a Preferred or Chosen Name?\n\nPreferred or Chosen Names A Preferred/Chosen Name is the name an individual at LCC (employee or student) wishes to be known by in the community. A Preferred/Chosen name differs from the individuals legal first name and is not meant to be used to record a nickname (e.g. Becky for Rebecca). LCC's policy covers Preferred/Chosen First Name. Surnames can be changed only through a legal name change.\n\nWhat is a Legal Name?\n\nLegal Name A Legal Name is the name that appears on an individual's passport, driver's license, state identification (i.d.), birth certificate, or U.S. Social Security Card.\n\nHow many times may I change my preferred or chosen name?\n\nWe ask that you limit your name change to once an academic year.\n\nThe processes related to changing your name are complex and time consuming. We realize that some individuals may not realize their preferred or chosen name the first time through the process and we support your right to be identified by your preferred name.\n\nWho can elect to use a Chosen Name?\n\nAnyone at Lansing Community College, employees and students.\n\nDo I Need to Provide Any Documentation Before I Elect a Chosen Name Or Identity?\n\nNo, you will need to fill out forms with you preferred or chosen name or identity. LCC is working to incorporate your preferred identities throughout the campus systems.\n\nDo I Have to Use a Chosen Name?\n\nNo, it is up to each individual to elect to use a preferred or chosen name.\n\nAre Individuals Required to Get a New ID/Star Card If They Elect A Chosen Name?\n\nNo, individuals may keep their current ID or Star Card for as long as they desire. If you wish to have a new Star Card printed, please go to the LCC Police Department office and request a new Star Card with your Chosen or Preferred name.\n\nWhat are Chosen Pronouns?\n\nChosen Pronouns and their proper usage provide a clear indication of your intention to be accepting, courteous, and respectful in identifying individuals in a way that is consistent to who they are. The most commonly used pronouns are listed below and is not meant to be an exhaustive list. You may access more resources by visiting the Understanding Pronouns website, or NPR's Guide to Understanding Gender Identity Terms.\n\nPronoun Sounds Like Variations He/Him You already know this one! His, Himself She/Her You already know this one! Hers, Herself They/Them Yes, it's okay to use this referring to a singular person! Theirs, themself Ze (or Zie) Zee (like \"see\" with a \"Z\"). Can also be spelled as xe Name Whatever their name is! Some people do not want to use pronouns at all and will ask you to refer to them by their name alone.\n\nIs a Chosen or Preferred Name the Same as a Nickname/Alias?\n\nNo, a Chosen and/or Preferred name are different name types from verbal nicknames. Opting to use a chosen or preferred name will not impact your verbal or unofficial nickname if you have one.\n\nWhat If I Forget or Make a Mistake Mis-Naming or Mis-Pronouning someone?\n\nAccept and acknowledge the mistake.\n\nApologize and correctly identify the individual, even if that individual is not present.\n\nPractice correctly naming and pronouning the individual until it is habitually done correctly.\n\nRemember that learning an individual's name and their pronouns are important because our identities based in words matter\n\nAt Lansing Community College individuals interested in learning more about diverse cultures and identities are encouraged to contact the Centre for Engaged Inclusion where you may enroll in various trainings, achieve various credentials, and engage with the campus and community.\n\nHere are suggestions to make your classroom and/or workspace more trans-friendly and inclusive:\n\nTo support everyone on LCC's campus we need to:\n\nPrioritize Student Autonomy\n\nAsk Once\n\nRespect Student Privacy\n\n1. Prioritize Student Autonomy\n\nIf a student has identified a name for themselves that is different than their legal name, it is important for administrators to allow them the autonomy, as adults, to determine how they should be represented. This means that we should make every effort to ensure only their chosen name appears on both records and technology – especially any information that students or others outside of Lansing Community College will see. Therefore, providing the student's legal name on documents with their chosen name in parentheses behind it is not an effective solution.\n\nNot only is using the chosen name supportive of the student, but according to Lambda Legal, it is also protecting private student records under FERPA. Providing this autonomy to students over their names can lead to inconveniences for administrators, but there are also ways to strategically use technology to minimize those inconveniences. For example, numeric usernames and identifiers are static, unchanging, and just as easy to use to look up a student or compare records across systems as a name or email field might be – if not more. Depending on how the system's search functions are configured, it may also be possible to search for students by their legal names while also keeping them hidden from display, further easing this dilemma.\n\n2. Ask Once\n\nSome campuses have begun streamlining the name change process so that students can visit an easily discoverable webpage, change their name, and not need to update their record anywhere else. Accomplishing this necessitates that the campus streamline all name records to be updated through a student information system on an automated basis\n\n3. Respect Student Privacy\n\nFor many students who pursue a name change, privacy is non-negotiable. Hearing a \"birth\" or legal name is not just distressful to the student, but it can lead to bullying from peers. Additionally, college is when a student begins to develop their professional branding and identity – associating the student's academic and student involvement records with a name they no longer use can prove challenging later in life, especially for those with high profile student activities such as athletics. Access to legal name should be restricted on an absolute need-to-know basis for employees who are trained in respecting student name and gender privacy.\n\nThere are many reasons a student may not want to update their campus records, especially if their family is not aware of their name change.\n\nNames hold power. Together, we can support students in owning that power as part of their individual identity development. Respecting student privacy and autonomy can only support students in growing to be their fullest selves.\n\nThis policy applies to all students, faculty and staff, and it provides support for any of our LCC community members who may decide to identify by preferred/chosen name. Chosen names are names that an individual wants to be known by or identifies with in the Lansing College community and may be different from the individual's official name of record. The policy allows all members of the LCC Community to identify and use a gender identity instead of, or in addition to, their sex where possible. A person's chosen name and gender identity pronouns should be used whenever possible. Chosen names will appear in all College systems where available and technically feasible (e.g., class rosters, grade rosters, etc.) and also can include the use of chosen names in conversation, email communication or formal settings. The non-binary options found in the policy also are used by entities with which the College interacts. Examples include College Board, Educational Testing Service and other common/national applications, as well as some states that also have non-binary gender values available for selection. Instituting these policies also ensures we align with shifts in the educational ecosystem and stay ahead of advancements in equity.\n\nThere are a few notable exceptions to this policy:\n\nProspective students and employees will be required to provide their full legal name when they apply for admission or employment with the College.\n\nChosen names should not be used for the purpose of misrepresentation, avoiding legal obligations or in any way that violates LCC policies or federal, state or local laws.\n\nChosen names that are not possible to implement (names with symbols or images) are prohibited.\n\nThere may be instances where the approach, timeline or participants vary for implementation.\n\nWith this new initiative, Lansing Community College not only acknowledges all gender identities but also establishes norms of respect between students, staff and faculty. It also shows LCC's commitment to equity and inclusion. We encourage you to share information about the Preferred and Chose\n\nAdditional information for Higher Ed leaders who want to support trans* individuals from Nicolazzo Z\n\nFor higher ed leaders who want to support transgender students on their campuses, Nicolazzo recommends several strategies to help create a welcoming environment.\n\n1: Recognize the power of a name. Transgender students report discomfort when faculty use their legal name instead of their preferred name. And because it can be difficult for students to change their name within the institution, allowing students to name themselves within the classroom can have a big impact, writes Nicolazzo. Nicolazzo recommends asking students if there are any discrepancies between the names on the roster and the names students use—especially before calling roll.\n\n2: Use student-specified pronouns. Assure students they can use the pronouns they feel most comfortable with in your class, writes Nicolazzo. And let students know if there are ways to make name or pronoun changes administratively.\n\n3: Consider the necessity of transgender-inclusive facilities. Transgender students ranked gender-neutral restrooms as the most important resource on campus in a survey by Clark University and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. So Nicolazzo suggests that professors \"demand to [teach] only in buildings with transgender-inclusive restrooms.\" If that's not possible, Nicolazzo recommends listing the closest gender-neutral restrooms on the syllabus.\n\n4: Pull from transgender resources. When compiling course texts and creating your syllabus, be sure to include transgender voices. \"Even if your class is not focused on gender, it's still important to draw on diverse knowledge bases, which includes transgender communities,\" writes Nicolazzo.\n\n5: Educate yourself. \"Don't expect transgender students to teach you about all things transgender,\" writes Nicolazzo. It can be exhausting for your transgender students. Plus, there is a wealth of information out there about the transgender experience.\n\n6: Protect your students' safety and privacy. Just because a student discloses their gender identity to you doesn't mean you should talk about or share that information with others, Nicolazzo points out. \"Being out is not always the safest or best option for them.\" And if you notice transphobia or hear transphobic comments in or outside the classroom, say something, writes Nicolazzo. \"Educators need to create classrooms where those sorts of violent statements are not tolerated.\" After all, when transgender students experience harassment, they often leave college.\n\n7: Remember that transgender students are more than their gender identity. \"Remember not to flatten us to our gender, as this becomes exhausting and limits our possibilities,\" writes Nicolazzo. Engage with students around their other interests and experiences.\n\n8: Be patient with yourself. Commit to \"learning and implementing gender-aware practices,\" writes Nicolazzo. But recognize that unlearning gender socialization takes time. And if you make a mistake, own up: \"Owning those mistakes and then not making them again is essential,\" notes Nicolazzo.\n\nSources: Green et al., New York Times, 10/21/18; Nicolazzo, Inside Higher Ed, 10/12/18; Jashik, Inside Higher Ed, 10/22/18"
