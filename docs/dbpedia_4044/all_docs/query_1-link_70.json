Welcome to the 2023 Lane College Homecoming.\n\nI'm Darlette Carver Samuels.\n\nI serve as Vice President for Institutional Advancement and Chief of Staff.\n\nAnd I am delighted to have an alum with me.\n\nWe've been together for four years.\n\n- This is it.\n\n- This is it, Ryan Spann.\n\n- They brought me back.\n\nHow y'all doing?\n\nSo happy to be here.\n\n- It's good to be here.\n\nThis is a beautiful, beautiful Homecoming Day.\n\nAnd we're just so excited to have Ryan as our Parade Marshall.\n\nWe have Jada Simone Brown, who was crowned Miss Tennessee Volunteer.\n\n- Can we start saying The Miss Tennessee now?\n\n- Okay, we can say The Miss Tennessee.\n\n- I just feel like that's what we wanna say this year.\n\n- The Miss Tennessee Volunteer.\n\nAnd it's such a delight to have her to serve as our Parade Marshall.\n\nThis is the first time.\n\nI mean, she's just a history maker.\n\n- Oh yeah.\n\n- This is the first time that we've had a student to serve as our Parade Marshall, but of course, noteworthy that she should be leading this parade.\n\nJoining us today is Darren Likes.\n\nDarren Likes serves on the board of...\n\nThey have the special title, the Working Committee.\n\nDarren Likes.\n\n- Hello there, good morning.\n\n- Good morning.\n\nIs your microphone on?\n\nGood morning.\n\n- All right, hold on.\n\n- So, Darren Likes is a community volunteer.\n\nHe's been working with the Miss Tennessee Volunteer Organization for several years.\n\nAnd you have been escorting our Parade Marshall this morning.\n\nTell me about just what she's feeling, how she's feeling.\n\nShe looked like she's just been up, just ready to go this morning.\n\n- Well, she had a early call time.\n\nWe had hair and makeup this morning at 5:30 AM- - Ooh.\n\n- At my studio, which means I was up at 4:30 'cause she was early.\n\nBut it was great.\n\nShe looks amazing and just so excited to be the Parade Marshall.\n\nI mean, it's really surreal for her this morning.\n\nIt all still feels really new to her, being Miss Tennessee Volunteer.\n\nShe said it earlier this morning, It seems like July was just yesterday for her.\n\nBut I'm so proud and she's excited to be the Parade Marshall this morning.\n\n- Well, we're just excited to have you, Darren.\n\nI mean, you've been a long-time friend of the college.\n\nOf course, you supported us during Founder's Day.\n\nAnd then you're just making sure that Jada is good, that she's where she needs to be.\n\nAnd I reflect, Ryan, on just looking through the videos that have been posted.\n\n- Oh yeah.\n\n- That during that moment, when it was just Jada and the first runner up, and when they called Jada's name, I think we all just felt the emotion in all of that.\n\n- Oh yeah.\n\n- Absolutely.\n\nI've worked with the Miss Tennessee Pageant for almost 20 years, and I've been a board member for the past 10 and I've been longing for the day for us to crown a Black Miss Tennessee Volunteer in Jackson.\n\nSo I'm just, I'm thrilled.\n\nIt's still surreal for me too, it doesn't seem real, but she's been a great Miss Tennessee so far.\n\n- Well, we definitely have to say thank you to, of course, the Lane College family, but also Travis Franklin, Jr. for serving us- - Whoa, that's a big one.\n\nWe gotta, yeah, Travis Franklin.\n\nWe gotta- - You wanna pause?\n\nAs Darren would say- - He couldn't be here today.\n\nAnd he reached out to me last night, and said, \"I hate that I can't be there, \"but I just know that I'm gonna be able to watch it \"on TV, and see her come by and wave.\"\n\nI was a part of it.\n\nSo I just wanted to make sure, Travis Franklin.\n\n- So pause?\n\n- Pause.\n\n- Travis Franklin, Jr. for serving as her pageant coach and now her business manager.\n\nBut she has this team that's very supportive.\n\nEmily Ann, Jeannie Beth.\n\nCome on, Tammy Sparks.\n\n- Tammy Sparks, LaShonda Williams.\n\nSo they're here, they're right behind.\n\n- Stacy McIntyre.\n\n- Stacy King McIntyre.\n\n- Oh my gosh, you better.\n\n- Huge part, huge part.\n\n- Yes, so, thank you so much, Darren.\n\nI just wanted to lead with you because we are leading with Miss Tennessee Volunteer today.\n\n- Thank you for having me.\n\n- Could you tell us something about Miss Volunteer that we don't know?\n\n- Well, it's been in Jackson for 70 years.\n\n- A secret, a secret though.\n\n- A secret?\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- A secret, well, not really a secret, but I will tell you that I will be doing Miss Tennessee Volunteer, Jada Brown's portrait- - Whoa.\n\n- This year, that will forever hang in the Miss Tennessee room in the Civic Center.\n\nSo she'll be the first Black woman to be in that room, and she'll be there forever.\n\nSo, that'll be a really, really historic moment.\n\nAnd hopefully everyone will come out whenever she hangs that portrait.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- Another product of Lane College, that's all.\n\n- Thank you for giving us the inside scoop.\n\n- Thank you.\n\n(Ryan laughing) The inside scoop, first here.\n\n- There it is.\n\n- Happy Homecoming, Lane College.\n\n- Happy Homecoming.\n\nThank you so much, Darren.\n\n- Thank you.\n\n- Well, we're excited.\n\nIt's my understanding, Ryan, that they've left the campus.\n\nAnd we started our day with the prayer breakfast.\n\nAnd it was a delight to have those persons from... We had Olivia Abernathy, who's a Madison County commissioner who offered prayer.\n\nAnd we had Bishop Bond, and Reverend Mormon, and April Webster, and then our board chair.\n\nIt was just a delight to open up with that.\n\n- I went last night to the 20... Oh, I'm sorry, the 20 under 40, that's what it was, and there was opening remarks by Dr. Hampton.\n\nIt was amazing.\n\nIt felt like we got a light sermon, but- - [Darlette] (laughing) Well, you know, he is a preacher.\n\n- But that's what we needed.\n\nThat's what we needed in that moment.\n\nBut I think now, this morning, knowing that we starting this thing off right, getting some prayer in, having some breakfast.\n\nWe're gonna press down and shake it together, like the Reverend Dedmon used to say.\n\n- Shake down, shake up.\n\n- Over there at New St. Luke Baptist Church.\n\nI don't wanna start calling out churches here in Jackson.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n(both laughing) - I'm excited to see everybody come today.\n\nI'm so excited.\n\n- We are.\n\n- We couldn't ask for better weather.\n\nI mean, it's crisp, that's the word I wanna say.\n\nCrisp.\n\n- Crisp, it is.\n\nIt's a nice, crisp, sunny day.\n\nAnd it's perfect weather for- - A parade?\n\n- A parade.\n\nAnd you know who else has been so helpful to us?\n\n- Who?\n\n- And that is the police chief.\n\n- Okay.\n\n- Tom Corley has been magnificent.\n\nHe's been so magnificent that he is trying to tell us something from there.\n\n(Ryan laughing) - Hopefully, he doesn't he gimme a ticket for my parking.\n\nI might go over this morning downtown.\n\nI just wanna say that from the City of Jackson, I will make sure I take care of any type of municipality violations today.\n\n- Yes, and then we have our alum, Deputy Chief Derek Tisdale.\n\nThey go hand in hand.\n\n- Whoa, Deputy Chief, hold on, is he a product of Lane College as well?\n\n- He's Deputy Chief.\n\nYes, a product of Lane College.\n\n- Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, all right.\n\n- You wanna pause?\n\n- Well, I just feel like now I can get outta tickets.\n\nWhen things go wrong here in Jackson, I would be all right.\n\nI just need to drop some names.\n\nI'm not gonna drop it too hard though.\n\n(Ryan laughing) - Well, yeah, he's a good supporter of Lane College, and just having that community support is so important for all of us and definitely for Lane College.\n\nAnd so, it's my understanding now, Ryan, I kind of received a report that, you know, we had COVID and we had to take a break, but I believe we're back to where we were before 2020 in terms of the number of entries.\n\n- For the parade?\n\n- Yes.\n\n- Oh my goodness.\n\nI think last year, I will say it was nice to just come back together.\n\nWe were happy to be here, that was the goal.\n\nI think this year definitely, for me, getting here Thursday, I got here with my son Thursday night, and I could just feel the energy in Jackson.\n\nIt was more people, the hotels were booked, all the restaurants you got, what is it called?\n\nStanding seating, we're waiting, for waiting, and now here we are today and everything worked out.\n\nI'm just so excited to see more people.\n\nAnd the kids are already lined up.\n\nYou all can't see it yet, but the kids are lined up.\n\n- And can we get this one kid over here?\n\n- Yes, we can.\n\nCan we get the baby?\n\n- I have to introduce everyone.\n\n- Please.\n\n- Come on over, Kristin and Chad, we have to introduce the family.\n\n- Please, please, please.\n\nHere, one sit down right here.\n\nThere we go.\n\nAnd then you get the baby.\n\nThere we go.\n\n- So, yeah, I'm taking personal privilege.\n\n- As you should.\n\n- Ryan, meet the family.\n\n- Hello, hello, hello.\n\n- So there we are.\n\n- State your name, and occupation.\n\nNo.\n\n(all chuckling) - My name is Kristen Sparks.\n\nThis is Zoe Sparks.\n\n- Hi, Zoe.\n\n- And my husband, Chad Sparks.\n\n- Yay.\n\nAnd so, that's my daughter.\n\nThat's our oldest daughter.\n\nThat's our son, but son-in-law.\n\n- Son-in-law.\n\n- The son.\n\nAnd then that's the grand baby.\n\n- Bonus son.\n\n- Yes, Zoe.\n\n- Zoe's so cute.\n\n- So, this is Zoe's first Lane parade.\n\n- Zoe, look, and you already on the dignitary booth.\n\nThis is amazing.\n\n- I know (chuckling) - I don't know how we can top it next year, Zoe.\n\n- So Kristen, you grew up on the campus of Lane College, literally grew up- - Yes.\n\n- On the campus.\n\nAnd so you always try to make a point to come back to Lane College's Homecoming.\n\nTell me about why is it that you feel like, Oh yes, we gotta go back?\n\n- It's just so nostalgic to come back and enjoy the Homecoming festivities.\n\nIt reminds me of my childhood.\n\nWe would wake up at 6:00 AM.\n\n- Come on.\n\n- To just run around with our mother, and we just had a lot of fun.\n\nAnd we want Zoe to experience the excitement and joy of Homecoming.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- Right, Zoe?\n\n(laughing) - Thank you.\n\n- Could you give us one of your favorite Lane College memories from Homecoming?\n\n- My favorite Lane College...\n\nThe parade has always been my favorite memory.\n\nWe always used to enjoy it, sitting here on the stage and watching all the bands perform.\n\n- Did Dr. McClure give you a hot 20 one time when he shook your hand?\n\n- [Kristin] I don't know.\n\nWe had a lot of good moments with Dr. McClure.\n\nHe used to, yeah, fun times.\n\n- [Darlette] You said a hot 20?\n\n- [Ryan] A hot, you know when you shake a hand, when you used to- - Oh, he'll slip a 20?\n\n- And it would just come to you.\n\nAnd you would just keep moving.\n\nHe'd say, \"Go fast.\"\n\n- Kristen had a scholarship.\n\n- Oh yeah, I did, I did.\n\n- So she had several 20s.\n\n- Come on, that's exactly what we need.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- You can't get it done without a scholarship.\n\n- Well, thank you, Kristen.\n\n- Thank you.\n\n- Thank you, Zoe.\n\nThank you, Chad.\n\n- Thank you, Zoe!\n\nIt's was so nice to meet you.\n\nCan't wait to see you next year when you bigger.\n\n- (laughing) And, Ryan, how are your little ones?\n\n- Good, good.\n\nNile just turned two.\n\nWell, he turned two last January.\n\nAnniston is eight.\n\nWe are now, we purchased our first home.\n\nI mean (growling).\n\n- Oh, congratulations, a homeowner.\n\n- Lemme say that, thank you.\n\n- That's important, that's major.\n\n- We had to wait about a year.\n\nThe market was tough.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- But with a lot of help, a lot of family, prayers, we got it done and we are now Atlanta residents or homeowners in South Atlanta.\n\nSo we're super-excited to be able to be in our first home, and grow up in it.\n\n- Yes.\n\nNow, Ryan, okay so, remind me of your graduation year.\n\n- I graduated in 2011.\n\n- 2011, SGA.\n\n- I was the Student Government Association President.\n\nAnd I was just so happy to get an opportunity to matriculate, just be around all the people.\n\nIt was a lot of folks that pushed me at Lane College.\n\nAnd I think that's what I try to strive to do every day, when I find a mentor or a mentee to work with, and just say, \"Hey, if I could do it.\"\n\nI told Ms. Boyd yesterday in the bookstore, I said, \"You did a lot of stuff for me.\"\n\nAnd I said, \"If it wasn't for you, it wouldn't be me.\"\n\nSo I just am so blessed to be here today.\n\n- [Darlette] So tell me about the sweatshirt now.\n\n- Oh, wait a minute, yes, the sweatshirt.\n\nI'll wait for the camera to come back so I can plug the Lane College bookstore.\n\nI have to thank my mother.\n\nShe went over there on Wednesday.\n\nThey were running low and she said, \"I didn't wanna have to fight, but I did and I got you something to wear.\"\n\nSo look, we knew what we were gonna do today with the red.\n\n- Wow, look at you.\n\n- You look amazing though, with this blazer.\n\n- So, Ryan?\n\n- Yes.\n\n- I would like for April Deberry to come over.\n\nWe wanna thank our- - She's coming.\n\n- Oh, we'll have Lisa to come over.\n\nLisa will come over and then we'll grab one of the parade judges.\n\nBut Lisa serves as our Director of Annual Fund.\n\nAnd she always says, \"I'm the one, I'm the money, I raise the money.\"\n\n- This the money, this the money bag.\n\nShe said, \"I don't have a lot, but just know that when I get the email out, you respond to me.\"\n\n- You respond to me.\n\n- \"'Cause I wanna acknowledge that when you get that email, don't put it in the junk file.\n\nGo on and do the pay.\n\nYou know you had it.\n\nWe send it on Fridays, we don't send it on Wednesdays.\"\n\nI'm sorry, here's your mic.\n\n- Well, Lisa, we're so excited to, you know, it's another Homecoming, and one, we have to pause.\n\nSo Ryan and I have this thing that we're doing throughout and that's pause.\n\n- Yes.\n\n- Mute, mute.\n\nYou ready, Lisa?\n\n- I am.\n\n- I wanna thank you for all of your hard work.\n\nLisa has been with us since 2016.\n\nNow really, she's already had an association with Lane College.\n\nBut officially, she came on board in 2016.\n\nAnd she's not just my colleague, but she's my sister.\n\nSo, I enjoy that she has my back and I have hers, and- - Amen.\n\n- And it's just a wonderful...\n\nI need you next.\n\nIt's just a wonderful time to, I wanna talk about the judges here.\n\n- Oh yeah, we're gonna get 'em.\n\n- But, Lisa, tell me, you have some sponsors.\n\nYou've been out there making sure that everything is well supported.\n\nAnd so, talk to us about what it means for that community support.\n\n- Good morning and Happy Homecoming.\n\n- Good morning, good morning, good morning.\n\n- So glad to be here this morning.\n\nAnd I definitely wanna thank our sponsors and everybody that supports Lane College Homecoming.\n\nThis just does not happen overnight.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- We start planning, as soon as this one is over, we'll be planning for the next one.\n\nBut everything takes funds and support and so we wanna thank our community supporters.\n\nWe wanna thank, first of all, the city of Jackson for all of their support and everything they do for us to make sure we're safe during Homecoming.\n\nEverything that they provide.\n\nTeam Clean.\n\n- Oh yeah.\n\n- And Mr. Michael White and their team for always sponsoring and helping us with Homecoming.\n\nCadence Bank and everything that they do for us.\n\nCapital City Residential Services.\n\nLiz and the team, we definitely wanna thank them.\n\n- Liz and John?\n\nLiz and John?\n\n- Liz and John, yes.\n\nThey're our good friends and we thank them for all they do to support Lane College.\n\nThey're our new friends and they're doing great things.\n\nDefinitely wanna thank the Potts Family, who is a Lane-ite, for their support.\n\nThe Picard family, and Voresa Booker and husband for their support for sponsoring Homecoming this year.\n\nAnd everyone else that supported us or are continuing to support us.\n\n- And Lisa also you mentioned the city of Jackson and rightfully so.\n\nAnd then you have to break it down, is that commission, the Community Economic Development Commission, who each year, Ryan, has increased their support of the Lane College Homecoming.\n\nLori Nunnery.\n\n- Yes.\n\n- Just appreciate her and that commission for saying, yes, Lane College is an organization that we need to support.\n\n- It's a powerful economic development department here in Jackson.\n\nThe business, I just drove around yesterday and I said, \"Well, I didn't know that Georgia Pacific was here.\"\n\nI said, \"Well, here we are.\"\n\n- Oh yeah, there's another good friend.\n\n- Yes and we're excited that they're here from Georgia Pacific.\n\n- I'm gonna call 'em out.\n\nWe need internship programs.\n\nAs soon as you open up a facility- - Well, you know, he's ready.\n\n- I want you here.\n\n- Yes, they are.\n\nThey've offered.\n\n- Oh, they did?\n\nOkay, perfect.\n\n- From the Georgia Pacifics to the CVSs, we have great partners at Lane College.\n\n- Yeah, we do.\n\n- Doing great things.\n\n- I credit me and the opportunities that I ever got was because of the folks, I'm thinking about Reverend Dedmon and the Career Services Department, oh, way, way back.\n\nHe got me on up there to Tennessee Valley Authority.\n\nAnd they said, \"Ryan, what's your best skill set that you can bring to the job?\"\n\nin my interview.\n\nYou know what I said?\n\nI said, \"I'm amazing at PowerPoint.\n\nIf that's what you need, I can do that.\"\n\nThey said, \"Oh no, we need some interpersonal skills.\"\n\nI said, \"Oh, I'm good at picking up coffee too.\n\nI don't know what else you need from me.\"\n\n(laughing) They gave me a job though, so it worked out real well.\n\n- They wanted those soft skills, huh?\n\nThat you were good... Look at, Ryan comes in, no script, Lisa.\n\n- Oh, he's off the cuff, as the young people say.\n\n- But what script are we doing?\n\n- He off the dome.\n\n- We're here to raise money.\n\nWhat's Dr. Logan say?\n\nWe're here to raise money for the school and the children that will matriculate through it.\n\nSo yes, we don't need a script.\n\nWe just know what we need to do when we get here.\n\n- That's right.\n\nFor those that are here and for those that are coming.\n\n- So Lisa, what's your favorite part of Homecoming?\n\n- Oh, big question.\n\n- I mean, you're involved in so much, but surely it's something that you say, \"Oh, I'm looking forward to this.\"\n\n- Or, \"I can't miss.\"\n\nThat's the big one.\n\n- So really the game.\n\nI'm a sports fanatic, so- - Oh my goodness.\n\nI should've known.\n\n- Even after everything that's going on, it's about a football game.\n\n- Oh, come on now.\n\n- And that's my favorite part.\n\n- Okay.\n\n- Is the game.\n\n- Cool, you know, I don't know, I thought you would've said something else like the Hall of Distinction.\n\n- That's how, you know... - I thought she was gonna go there, but that's up her alley now.\n\n- It is.\n\n- Don't mess with her on a Sunday.\n\n- I can only be who I am.\n\n- Well, you said football, and I was reading about the president's tent.\n\nIs there anyone that can give me an update about what the president's gonna be doing in his tent?\n\nI heard that there was- - Watching the game.\n\n- Well, they said that you could get invited to this tent.\n\nI said- - Hold on.\n\nWhat happens in the tent.\n\n- Okay, all right.\n\n- Stays.\n\n- You finish it.\n\nOkay.\n\n(Darlette and Lisa laughing) - I said, \"Man, there's a tent now?\"\n\n- Look, we'll talk offline about the tent.\n\n- There's a tent?\n\nOh man, I gotta show up to the tent today, everyone.\n\n- It's a beautiful day, we're so grateful.\n\nIt's a pretty parade.\n\nJust rode the route, people are everywhere.\n\n- Really?\n\nWonderful.\n\n- Very excited about our parade.\n\nWe have, I think, record-breaking entries in the parade.\n\nThat's what Miss M...\n\nI'm so excited.\n\nI saw two weeks ago, my city, Fairburn, Georgia, they put on a small event and Tennessee State's Aristocratic Man showed up.\n\n- Okay.\n\n- And so, we were able to enjoy them a couple weekends ago.\n\nAnd I said, well, wait a minute, hold on now.\n\nWe gotta get here for the Silent Storm.\n\nThis the real band that's gonna come through and really tear it down.\n\n- That's right.\n\n- So we're excited to see them this morning.\n\n- They're on their way.\n\nThey left campus and they're on their way.\n\n- Well, tell 'em to go slow.\n\nDon't rush themselves.\n\n- And all of our beautiful queens in their pretty cars.\n\n- Well, we have...\n\nYes, of course, we have Lane's marching band, but also Stillman College.\n\nOur board chair is a graduate of Stillman and one of our great friends, Donald Comer from FedEx, is on the board at Stillman.\n\nAnd they wanted to come and join in and fellowship with us and celebrate and have a good time, so we're excited about having them.\n\n- We are and they're here strong.\n\n- They're here strong?\n\n- Yes.\n\n- Could we give the location on Stillman?\n\nCould we give the location on Stillman, for the folks at the house that might not know?\n\n- I appreciate that.\n\nTuscaloosa.\n\n- All right, here we go.\n\n- Tuscaloosa, Alabama.\n\n- Not too far of a trip.\n\nI like it.\n\n- Yes.\n\nLisa, will you pass the mic to one of the judges?\n\nI'm interested because it's gonna be a long parade.\n\nAnd I understand you said that you rode the route and people are ready, you saw floats, all of that.\n\n- Bands, cars.\n\n- And so I wanna know what are they judging?\n\nWhat's the criteria?\n\n- Okay.\n\n- Okay.\n\n- Oh, are we supposed to keep them incognito?\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- It's okay?\n\n- I guess that's the point of- - Bring April Deberry over here since she's right there on the end.\n\n- Okay, I'll leave it on.\n\n- Ryan, so you got here early.\n\n- I got here Thursday.\n\nI flew on Southern Airways from Atlanta.\n\n- There's Morgan.\n\nReally?\n\n- Yes, I did.\n\nIt was a bumpy ride, but man, we surely pulled up.\n\nHello, hello, hello, good morning.\n\n- Hello, April.\n\n- Hello, good morning.\n\nGood morning, good morning.\n\n- So, April, good morning.\n\nSo I understand, so Ryan and I are being a little nosy.\n\nWe're being a little nosy.\n\n- Okay.\n\n- So, you all have the front-row seat so we figured that you all are the judges.\n\n- We are judges.\n\nWe have all three judges right here.\n\nMyself, I'm the tabulator and we are so excited.\n\n- What are you looking for?\n\n- We are looking for- - Now, when I say in terms of looking for, so you're judging the bands?\n\nYou're judging the floats?\n\n- We're judging the bands, we're judging the cars, we're judging the floats.\n\nWe're looking for the personality.\n\nWe're looking for the creativity.\n\nWe're looking for how everything is just put together.\n\n- Okay.\n\n- Well now, you know that it's a pretty big parade.\n\n- It's a pretty big parade.\n\n- 80 entries.\n\n- I see- - You ready?\n\n- We're ready, we're ready.\n\nWe've been looking forward to it.\n\nI was just talking to one of my judges a few minutes ago.\n\nI was telling her we have a great crowd downtown this year.\n\n- Yes.\n\n- Great, and I mean, there's so many people.\n\n- And what about this weather?\n\n- The weather is wonderful.\n\nIt's wonderful.\n\n- Can we just zoom in on your sweatshirt right now?\n\n- Alright!\n\n- I just wanna acknowledge that- - You wanna zoom in on my sweatshirt.\n\n- It's the tears.\n\n- I'm leaning too.\n\n- The tears look so nice, you know?\n\n(Darlette laughing) It's the white and the red, put it together.\n\n- And this shirt has a story for me.\n\n- Really?\n\n- It does.\n\n- Please share.\n\n- I don't know if you all know, but I went back to school.\n\n- Put your microphone, April.\n\n- I went back to school when it was the LEAP program.\n\n- Oh, come on, LEAP program!\n\n- I was the LEAP program.\n\n- You better preach, April.\n\n- And I went back at 32-years-old.\n\nAnd I had a lot of ups and downs with me being a single parent.\n\nBut I was able to hang in there.\n\nI was able to join a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful sorority through Beta Chi.\n\n- All right.\n\n- I was the oldest one on my line.\n\n- Wow.\n\n- And I was able to graduate Lane College in 2014 at the age of 40.\n\n- Ooh.\n\n- Amen.\n\n- I mean, that's the story that we try to tell.\n\n- April, there was a reason for you to come over here and sit with us.\n\nWe didn't need to talk about that judging criteria.\n\n- The age of 40.\n\nAnd I tell you, Lane College, it was something that I needed.\n\nYou know, when you're a single parent and you're trying to make more money, trying to take care of your children, and you just don't know how you was gonna do it and then you saw there was an opportunity for you to go back to college.\n\nYou knew it was gonna be hard, but I went back, I studied.\n\nIf I wasn't able to pass some classes and I had to retake it, I would talk to my advisor and try to get back in there.\n\nAnd I graduated at the age of 40 from Lane College.\n\n- And what was your degree in, April?\n\n- Sociology.\n\n- There we go.\n\n- And right now, I work for Quinco Mental Health and I've been with Quinco Mental Health now for eight years.\n\nAnd thanks to Lane College.\n\nThank you, Lane College.\n\nI am so appreciative.\n\n- I love your story.\n\nI love the sweatshirt.\n\nI want that sweatshirt, for sure.\n\nI love the sweatshirt.\n\n- And I'm just so happy to be here.\n\n- We're happy to have you.\n\n- Happy Homecoming 2023!\n\n- Do you mind if we get the next judge, Miss LeShore, to come on over?\n\n- Yeah, we have to represent, Ryan.\n\n- Oh, you know we always gotta do that.\n\n- Yes, Ryan has already- - Please, come on.\n\ncalled you out in front of the public.\n\nWell, Ryan, look at here.\n\n- Oh look.\n\n- I know, when you have the police come over, that means you need to watch out and get ready.\n\n- Get ready.\n\n- Hello, I see Beta Chi.\n\n- Hello, hello, hello.\n\n- Hello, hello, hello, good morning.\n\n- Introduce yourself please.\n\n- My name is Trina LeShore.\n\nI am an alum of Lane College, 2007.\n\n- But see, you left something off.\n\nGo ahead and add what you got on that year though?\n\nWhat did they give you that year that you earned?\n\n- I am the valedictorian.\n\n- Really?\n\n- We sitting up here with somebody different.\n\n- I am not surprised.\n\n- I wasn't that person.\n\nI wasn't that person.\n\n- I am not surprised.\n\n- Because I was at the Homecoming parties, she was studying, that's where she was at.\n\n(Trina laughing) - Sweet, and you earned your degree in which discipline?\n\n- Interdisciplinary Studies.\n\n- Wow, and now an educator.\n\n- I'm an educator, 18 years.\n\n- For 18 years.\n\n- Mm-hmm.\n\nI'm currently employed at Jackson Central-Merry High School.\n\n- Whoa.\n\n- Right across the tracks?\n\n- It's some Cougars around here.\n\nI'm not gonna say I went there, but I did.\n\n- Look at Clara.\n\nIt is so good to have you.\n\n- Thank you.\n\n- And so now you're here, 'cause yes, you're alum.\n\n- She's judging today.\n\n- You're judging today.\n\n- Yep.\n\n- Could you tell us what you're looking for?\n\n- And this is not the first year.\n\n- It's not my first year.\n\nI typically do it every year.\n\nI wouldn't wanna be any other place.\n\n- Okay.\n\n- I think this is my sixth year in a row- - Wow.\n\n- That I have been a part of this and I'm so grateful that Lane asks me to do this every year.\n\nBut we are looking for creativity amongst our participants.\n\nWe're looking for originality.\n\nWe're looking for competitiveness.\n\nWe wanna see somebody that's some go-getters that really wants it and really puts on a show in front of the judges' stand.\n\n- [Ryan] Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\n- Thank you so much.\n\n- All right, you're welcome.\n\n- [Darlette] Madam Valedictorian.\n\n(laughing) -

Yeah, so you said about Dr. Vaulx, you said he served as interim president.\n\n- He was there for me.\n\nI mean, it was everything you needed.\n\nHe was just nothing but cordial.\n\nHe was always accepting of the students and just an amazing man.\n\nDoes his wife have a dragon on her jacket?\n\n- Yes!\n\n- When did that come out?\n\n- [Darlette] See, you said that you wanted to just do a collection.\n\n- I show up to these events and people always surprise me in what they pull out of the jackets.\n\n- [Darlette] Well, it's such a delight.\n\nSo we've seen our Parade Marshall.\n\nShe will come and join us shortly.\n\nAnd Dr. Logan Hampton and Susan Hampton come to join us.\n\n- Well, it looks like I see the mayor down there too.\n\n- [Darlette] The mayor is coming.\n\nAnd so now the board chair is here.\n\n- Okay.\n\n- Bishop Marvin Frank Thomas, Senior, serving as the board chair of the Lane College Board of Trustees.\n\nAnd just happy to...\n\nHe closed us out for the parade, I mean for the prayer breakfast.\n\nAnd so, we're going to have- - Look at all these Corvette C8s just driving around as if they're Toyota Camry's today.\n\nThis is it.\n\n- And Ryan, when you get a chance.\n\n- Mm-hmm?\n\n- [Darlette] Try to get, and Morgan probably can help you, get Jada on over here so that we can- - One second.\n\n- [Darlette] And so we have our Madison County Commissioners.\n\n- There we go.\n\n- Sheila Godwin and Juanita Jones.\n\nSo happy to have them.\n\nSo happy to have them here with us.\n\nSo now this is a party bus.\n\n- [Ryan] Oh yeah.\n\nWe need a party bus 'cause it's a party with a purpose, is what we gotta say.\n\n- This the party bus.\n\n- [Ryan] Hello, hello, hello.\n\nPlease take a seat.\n\n- Hello, Jada!\n\nI'm gonna hand you the microphone.\n\n- Jada, good morning.\n\n- Good morning!\n\n- [Darlette] We're just, it's just...

Well see, now he's preaching.\n\nYou said you started off preaching, what was it, yesterday?\n\n- Yesterday, yesterday.\n\nBut you know what?\n\n- So however we come together, it's gonna be great.\n\nNo, but I mean it's a tribute to the team.\n\nThe team's been working.\n\nThey've been working- - Since last year.\n\n- [Dr. Hampton] Exceptionally hard.\n\nI mean, I don't know if they ever stop working on Homecoming.\n\nI mean, once it's one ends and another begins.\n\nI was just talking to one of our partners from Arizona State who's in town this week working with our Luminosity Scholars and she's staying in a hotel.\n\nShe's staying in a hotel where the visiting team is staying.\n\n- Okay.\n\n- And she said to me, she's like, \"That was the only hotel in town that had a room.\"\n\n(men laughing) She was like, \"I'm in the wrong place.\"\n\n- [Ryan] The hotel rates tend to go up when we do this, I'll say that from a person external from the city.\n\nBut definitely, you can see it.\n\n- [Darlette] Well, I don't experience that.\n\nI continue to sleep at 545 Lane Avenue on campus, so I don't get to experience the changes in the hotel room rates.\n\nBut we thank you for coming home.\n\n- Thank you.\n\n- And we thank you for paying for those rooms.\n\n- Yes.\n\n- [Dr. Hampton] But in your case, we thank you also for your donations and for your contribution directly to the college.\n\n- [Ryan] Just as much as what you can do, we also wanna get the donations.\n\n(parade participants yelling) I did wanna ask you really quick, before you get out here and you gotta continue kissing babies and shaking hands, anything that you would like to highlight this year for some of the alumni, some of the folks here in Jackson, any way that they can support the school directly?\n\nAnything maybe you'd like to highlight for them to be able to do it?\n\n- [Dr. Hampton] Well, anytime that we have a group of alums that are in town, we wanna celebrate the comeback and to give back.\n\nTo continue to make an investment in our scholars.\n\nOur scholars come from some of the same backgrounds that our alums came from.\n\nI mean, we have first gen and we have low to moderate-income families.\n\nWe have persons who are coming from, 60% of our students are from the State of Tennessee, 40% from outside of the State of Tennessee.\n\nWe're a private institution.\n\nAnd so as a private institution, we operate on student fees, what the students pay, and what our alum donate.\n\n- Okay.\n\n- And so yes, we invite our alum to make an investment in our students.\n\nTo come back and to give back.\n\nAnd just exciting last night with our 20 under 40, it was just an exciting moment that those young people that we decided to say we wanted to celebrate individuals under 40 who made a significant contribution in their field.\n\nWe just wanted to celebrate them because we wanna continue that legacy.\n\nWe want to lift them up so we might inspire our current students.\n\n- [Ryan] Oh yeah.\n\n- [Dr. Hampton] We wanna lift them up to encourage them to continue to be engaged with the college.\n\nBut they were so inspired that they decided, as a group, to endow a scholarship.\n\n(parade participants yelling) And so a part of their celebration and a part of us celebrating them, they gave back to the college.\n\nAnd for me, that's just the way it should happen.\n\nIt wasn't something that we leaned on them to do.\n\nIt's just, it was their inspiration and with our help and with our assistance.\n\n- [Ryan] An inaugural class, we gotta say that.\n\n- [Dr. Hampton] Yeah, it was an inaugural class.\n\n- [Ryan] So we gonna do it again.\n\n- Oh yeah.\n\n- Oh, every year.\n\n- [Dr. Hampton] So as we think about the 20 under 40, there are so many of our alums that are making their mark in their chosen careers and we need to celebrate those persons.\n\nWe started the Hall of Distinction some years ago to celebrate our more seasoned, legacy alums because I got to a point where we send out, we get this announcement, and we send an announcement out across the nation, across the world of a Lane alum- - Monthly.\n\n- Who had passed.\n\n- Oh, yeah.\n\n- You know, who had died.\n\nAnd I said to the team, we've gotta see these people and celebrate them before they transition.\n\n- Give them their flowers.\n\n- [Dr. Hampton] And so we started the Hall of Distinction to celebrate our seasoned alums that have had an entire career.\n\n- Oh yeah.\n\n- [Dr. Hampton] And for their entire career, we celebrate their contribution.\n\n- [Darlette] Now, Mr. President, I gotta jump in, okay?\n\nBecause he is a preacher now.\n\nHe's the president but he also a preacher.\n\nAnd North Parkway is doing a wonderful job over there.\n\nBut I gotta ask you this quick question.\n\n- [Dr. Hampton] That is North Park.\n\nI love their colors.\n\n- [Darlette] Yeah, that's North Parkway Middle School.\n\n- [Ryan] They got 'em, right?\n\n- [Darlette] As we think about, we're celebrating our Parade Marshall, Miss Tennessee Volunteer.\n\nWhat were you doing, were you there, were you watching?\n\nHow were you, were you like, they went to the top 15, they went to the top 10.\n\nTell me what were- - So you are picking now?\n\n- No, I'm not, I wanna know.\n\n- Yes, you are.\n\nYes you are.\n\n- Well, it's a light moment.\n\n- I was traveling.\n\n- Okay.\n\n- [Dr. Hampton] So I was traveling back to Jackson on the evening of the pageant.\n\nAnd so about the time that I arrived back in town, I get a text message that Miss Lane has made, I think it was the top 15.\n\n- Okay.\n\n- And so I'm going in the house and I'm about to turn on the TV to turn the pageant on.\n\nAnd I go, no, I wasn't watching before she made the top 15, so I can't turn it on.\n\nSo then- - [Darlette] Jada's listening to you, by the way.\n\n- [Dr. Hampton] Then she made the top 10.\n\nThen I got a text she was in the top 10.\n\n- [Ryan] You gotta turn it on.\n\n- [Dr. Hampton] I'm like, I gotta turn it on.\n\nSo I'm like, I got the remote in hand now, and I go, no.\n\nI'm an old athlete.\n\nYou kinda get those- - You get nervous.\n\nYou get nervous.\n\n- You get that weird stuff in your head, like, you gotta keep doing what you were doing.\n\nAnd I was like, no, I wasn't watching this.\n\nAnd then she makes the top five and it was like- - [Ryan] Everyone was sweating bullets then.\n\n- [Dr. Hampton] Now I'm just starting to walk around the house.\n\nAnd then I get the text that she won.\n\nI run to the TV, turn it immediately on.\n\n- [Ryan] So you've gotten to see an SIAC Women's Basketball championship.\n\n- Here, here.\n\n- In your tenure.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- Now, we have a Miss Tennessee.\n\nThen also- - I mean, that's 70 years.\n\nThat's a 70-year tradition right there.\n\n- You got a strong 10 years.\n\nI don't know what else you're gonna bring us, Dr. Hampton.\n\n- Hey, listen, all I do is win, win, win, win, win, no matter what.\n\n- [Ryan] We beat Tennessee State University under you.\n\nCome on.\n\n- All I do is win, win, win, win no matter what.\n\n- You're so funny.\n\n- Thank you, Dr. Hampton.\n\n- Well thank you so much, Dr. Hampton.\n\nIt's been a delight talking to you.\n\n- [Dr. Hampton] Are you gonna say something about the distinctive- -

There we go.\n\n- And started working as the Dean of Students.\n\nSo, I mean, it's a great moment, the two significant institutions in my life, sharing the same stage on such a significant day.\n\nI mean, it was a very, very pleasant surprise.\n\nThank y'all so much.\n\n- That's amazing.\n\nThat's amazing.\n\nAnything that you could give us from your favorite Homecoming memory?\n\nYour favorite Homecoming memory at Lane College maybe you could share.\n\n- Well, as the Dean of Students, you're very careful and you pray for Homecoming.\n\n- [Ryan] That's true.\n\n- [Marvin] But I can't remember who we were playing, but Dr. Wesley McClure, I think, it may have been his first or it must've been his second year.\n\n- Not the second year.\n\n- 'Cause I was here with him two years.\n\nBut we had lost so many games and we were getting ready to play somebody, I can't remember who it was.\n\nBut there was an atmosphere on campus that this was going to be the game that Lane will eventually break that losing streak of so many, I mean, I don't even want to tell you how many games that the college had lost prior to that particular game.\n\n- Oh, yeah.\n\n- And as excited as I was about our possibilities of winning, I had a sense of what that might mean for me as Dean of Students.\n\n(Ryan laughing) But anyway, it was, to be present and a part of Lane College when we won that first game after having lost so many games and then to have the joy that our students did not completely turn the town upside down nor the campus.\n\n(everyone laughing) But they celebrated in such a respectful and appreciative way, because it was a great moment for athletics at Lane College.\n\nSo I was very, that was the one that I remember.\n\n- [Ryan] Whew, I remember ringing the bell every time they would come home from those long trips.\n\n- Yeah.\n\n- And they would be all the way across the country.\n\nAnd then you'd know at two o'clock in the morning, it didn't matter if it was 2:00 AM on Sunday, they would ring that bell and we knew what time it was.\n\n- So, Ryan, you would, so Bishop, now we're, Mr.\n\nChair, were you affiliated or did you become a member of Alpha Phi Alpha during the time at Stillman?\n\n- No, I worked when I was a student at Stillman, so I didn't, and I really didn't have any interest.\n\nAnd then, a few years afterwards, some of the members of the graduate chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha, Delta Phi Lambda in Tuscaloosa approached me about their fall line.\n\nAnd one of my best friends and I, we, along with some others, we went through the process and that was in 1984.\n\n- Wow.\n\n- So I joined the fraternity in 1984.\n\n- [Darlette] Yeah, I did that for Ryan.\n\n- Thank you.\n\n- Okay.\n\nOkay.\n\n- I am a 2009 initiate here at Lane College in Beta Pi.\n\nBut definitely, we appreciate every opportunity we get to talk to you and we just thank you.\n\n- [Marvin] Yeah, my son came through Beta Pi.\n\n- Okay.\n\n- Yes.\n\n- Yeah, Marvin Thomas, Jr. - There you go.\n\n- Yeah, yeah.\n\n- Mr. Lane.\n\n- [Marvin] And then, well, when I was the Dean of Students, even though I came as an Alpha, well, the Alphas had to remind the other members of the Greek community to lighten up on the dean.\n\n- [Ryan] Come on.\n\n- [Marvin] But thank y'all so much.\n\n- Thank you so much, Mr.\n\nChair.\n\nThat was the Board Chair for the Lane College Board of Trustees and the Presiding Prelate of the First Episcopal District, Marvin Frank Thomas, Sr., joining us today.\n\nAnd we were delighted with, I saw a hope, there was an entry that passed by and we did not recognize the Hope Lodge.\n\nThe 144 PHA Masons.\n\nSo glad to have them with us.\n\nAnd we wanna thank TRTV.\n\n- Okay.\n\n- [Darlette] We wanna thank them for every year, Thomas Varhese and his crew, E2 plus TV6.\n\nE2, E plus TV6, you got it?\n\n- [Ryan] There you go, we got it.\n\n- E plus- -
