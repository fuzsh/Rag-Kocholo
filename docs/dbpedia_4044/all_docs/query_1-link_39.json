It's a community revival of sorts and a North Nashville family reunion wrapped in one — the John Merritt Classic. Though it brings thousands from across the city and region to Tennessee State University, it all started years ago with one man, John Merritt, the coach who took Tennessee State to its highest level of football in the program's history. Affectionately known as \"Big John\", Merritt dominated and revolutionized the game of football during his coaching career, compiling a record of 172-33-7 at TSU and 232-65-11 overall. His former players and the Big Blue Nation still remember Merritt's signature cigar smoke after wins.\n\nTSU IN THE JOHN MERRITT: The Tigers have played in the John Merritt Classic 22 times dating back to the first event in 1999. The Tigers are 16-6 in ht event TSU won the first six John Merritt Classics from 1999-2004. The Tigers took down Alabama A&M three years in a row, followed by wins over Prairie View A&M, South Carolina State, and AAMU.

The two programs first met in 1916, ending in a 0-0 tie, followed by a 7-7 tie in 1927, and a 6-6 tie in 1929. TSU's first win against Lane came in 1933 as they won 37-6.

Watkins grabbed the first interception of the season for the TSU defense in the loss to MTSU, as the lengthy corner made an incredible gain in front of an MTSU receiver on the sideline while managing to get his foot in bounds. The interception was also the first of his collegiate career. Watkins has 10 tackles, 1 tackle for loss, and two pass breakups to go along with his interception through the first three games.\n\nRUNNING THROUGH HALE: Junior running back Devon Starling knows a thing or two about playing in Hale Stadium.
