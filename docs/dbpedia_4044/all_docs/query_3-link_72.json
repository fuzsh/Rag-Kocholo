        "text": "No. You can only indicate the name that you use for your first name. To change your middle or last name on your college record you will need to change your legal name. To change your legal name, students must complete the Change of Data Form, which can be obtained in the Student Records Office, Frost 223. More information can be found in the HCC Student Handbook under the section Changing Biographical Data.\n\nTo change a first name on an HCC identification card, current students must first complete the Name In Use Form in Online Services, and then go to Student Engagement located in the Campus Center second floor, CC 227, across from the bookstore. Students should tell staff they have changed their first name through Online Services and want a new ID card showing the correct name. The change will be confirmed and a new ID card will be issued. There is no fee unless the student already has an ID card and does not turn it in at the time the new ID card is issued.\n\nIf the first initial of the name a student uses differs from the legal/previously listed first name, it will be reflected five minutes after you submit the request, and will affect the following:\n\nHCC Campus Account (Computers, Email*, Rave)\n\nOnline Services including transcripts, faculty rosters and advising lists\n\nDegreeWorks\n\nDiplomas, awards, and recognitions.\n\nCanvas accounts will be merged within 1-2 business days. During that time, you may not be able to access all your course material. Please consider this when deciding when to submit your request.\n\n*A student will only be able to access their email using the new username and address, and others will be able to email them using both, so no emails will be lost. DegreeWorks will reflect the change the next day."
