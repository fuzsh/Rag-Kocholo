(March 22, 2021) – Lane College breaks into a number one spot in America’s Best Colleges as winner of “Best HBCU in Tennessee” according to Intelligent.com.\n\nIntelligent.com, a trusted resource for rankings and higher education planning, has announced the 2021 top colleges. Each institution is evaluated based on curriculum quality, graduation rate, reputation, and post-graduate employment.\n\n“March Madness is always a fun time for rankings and Lane College is delighted to break into the number one spot and to be named the Best HBCU in Tennessee. We are especially humbled to be named the 2021 best because Tennessee has more than a half dozen outstanding HBCU colleges and universities.,” said President Logan Hampton.\n\nOver the past year, as America has faced dual pandemics of the COVID-19 virus and racial inequality, Lane College has launched aggressive new initiatives and programs to respond to each.\n\nLane, traditionally a residential campus, pivoted the curriculum to online during the pandemic and dramatically upgraded the campus technology infrastructure to provide a best-in-class virtual learning environment.
