        "text": "College Name\n\nState University of New York at Delhi or SUNY Delhi are the official names for the college as recommended by faculty and staff in 2002 and formally adopted by the President's Cabinet. These are the only two names that should be used when communicating with prospective students, current students and their families, as well as alumni, the community and public officials.\n\nCollege Logo\n\nPrinting of the logo in alternate colors, shapes, sizes and fonts requires prior approval by the Office of Marketing and Communications.\n\nThe logo should never be used to imply endorsement of a product or service not provided by SUNY Delhi, or incorporated into another logo, without prior approval by the Office of Marketing and Communications.\n\nUse of the logo by other than authorized college employees is prohibited unless approved in writing by the Vice President for Marketing and Communications. Likewise, the development of additional logos for departments, functions of the college, etc. must be approved in advance by the Vice President for Marketing and Communications.\n\nAuthorization and access to logos are available by calling the Office of Marketing and Communications at 607-746-4870.\n\nAthletic Logo\n\nThe athletic logo, the Bronco, may be used only by the Athletic Department, Campus Store or by special permission from the Office of Marketing and Communications. It should not be used in place of, or alongside of, the SUNY Delhi logo. The Bronco is a unique symbol for the college's athletic teams, and as such, should not be used to represent academic or administrative units of the college, nor by individuals employed by the college. Exceptions for athletic-related events must be approved by the Office of Marketing and Communications."
