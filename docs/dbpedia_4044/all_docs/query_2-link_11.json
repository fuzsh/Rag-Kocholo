        "text": "Congratulations to you. We are proud of you already. Yes, we think you deserve recognition, too. You have played a key role in preparing your student to enter college and we are excited to tell you more about Lane.\n\nWe’re sure you have a lot of questions about what life is like at Lane (and why Lane is ranked as the best HBCU in Tennessee). We invite you to explore our website to learn more about us. If your schedule permits, we would love to have you visit us in person. You can contact admissions@lanecollege.edu and we would be happy to schedule a private tour, or a one-on-one conversation, to tell you more about our historic HBCU.\n\nAs you consider the right college for your student, we want to share some information on the learning environment at Lane, our admissions process, life on campus, our hometown, important dates to remember, and additional resources.\n\nLEARNING AT LANE\n\nA Lane education provides your student with a dynamic curriculum that combines world-class faculty with hands-on experience. And we deliver our instruction in a private, Christian, and compassionate community that is very different than public schools.\n\nThe thing we hear most from parents is “I never knew a private education was this different than public schools. This has changed our whole world. And I never knew it was so incredibly affordable.”\n\nClasses at Lane emphasize experiential learning. Our students do not memorize textbooks and take a bunch of standardized tests. We think students learn best when they are having fun, so we’ve packed our curriculum with hands-on learning and fun experiences.\n\nOur classes are small and offer one-on-one opportunities for research and engagement. Many classes will only have about a dozen students and our classes are taught by teachers committed to delivering an exceptional private HBCU education – not graduate assistants.\n\nWe offer more person-to-person support than most schools. That means more one-on-one support for your student in learning labs, health and counseling services, spiritual guidance activities, and career planning. It also means more one-on-one support for you as you have questions or concerns.\n\nOUR ADMISSIONS PROCESS\n\nIt is free to apply to Lane and we are accepting applications now. Most Lane students receive financial aid, and we will help you with each step of the financial aid process. You can follow the link below to apply and we will get everything started. There is no obligation with an application and many students apply to more than one school. The application allows us to find the perfect mix of students for our campus and to begin the process of preparing a financial aid award letter. As you have questions, please email us at admissions@lanecollege.edu and we will reach out to help. You can also talk to one of our admissions counselors by calling 731-426-7537. We would love to hear from you.\n\nLANE LIFE\n\nTwo questions we hear most often from prospective parents are “Where will my student live?” and “Where will my student eat?” Don’t worry, we’ve got both of these covered.\n\nA dozen residence halls and living communities have been created to give your student a safe place to live and learn. We have a lot of different options. Some halls are single-sex and others are co-ed. Other residential options are designed as living communities and are built around shared interests. Our residence halls are more than a place for your student to rest their head. Our residence halls offer convenience, comfort, a place to study, and provide 24-hour security with resident assistants and frequent social activities.\n\nThere is nothing like Mama’s cooking, but we get as close as we can. Whether it’s fried fish and spaghetti or a vegetarian diet, we take our dining operations seriously. From traditional soul food to internationally inspired menus, we provide a variety of options seven days a week and from morning until night. We also provide a free community pantry for students to stock up on snacks and midnight essentials.\n\nA comfortable place to live and something delicious to eat is just the beginning of campus life at Lane. There are over a hundred student clubs and organizations, NCAA varsity sports, as well as professional development and networking opportunities. We know college is about more than just getting a diploma, and we have a full calendar of social activities for your student to discover the power of their potential.\n\nWe know that nothing matters if we can’t keep your student safe. In addition to residential life, dining services, and campus life activities, we believe our safety protocols are among the best. We have dedicated 24/7 security operations and are designated as a LiveSafe campus. Your student will have access to our LiveSafe Dashboard on their phone and will be able to access a variety of services to keep them safe. We also have access to medical staff on-campus and at no charge and operate a comprehensive wellness program throughout the year.\n\nOUR TENNESSEE HOME\n\nLife is easier in Tennessee and we are proud to call Jackson, Tennessee our hometown. Tennessee is a state of rolling hills, beautiful foliage, distinct seasons, relaxed affordability and enduring civil rights. Centered a short distance between the musical meccas of Memphis and Nashville, Jackson is the perfect mix of town and country, historic town square and progressive city, community block party and city festival. Jackson is a true college town with six colleges operating a short drive from the town center. A community focused on a safe and affordable undergraduate education, Jackson is a town of friendly people. With hundreds of restaurants, eateries, and lots of excursion opportunities, the possibilities abound with things to do. Tree-lined streets of stately older homes are combined with modern loft-style apartments. There’s an active community recreation department that hosts festivals, parades and outings; live community theatre; vibrant church communities; and a flourishing calendar of activities. There is always something to do. Jackson is one of Tennessee’s larger and more progressive cities, but maintains a distinctive and gentile southern charm that allows it to provide an exceptional college experience. In short, it’s the perfect choice for an undergraduate education.\n\nRESOURCES\n\nWe know you play a vital role in the success of your student. We also know that gathering resources can be a daunting task. We’ve compiled a list of resources to help. If you don’t see what you are looking for, we’re just a call or email away. Contact us at admissions@lanecollege.edu."
