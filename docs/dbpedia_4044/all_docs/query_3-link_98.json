        "text": "GGC recognizes that individuals may wish to use a preferred or chosen first name instead of a legal name for a variety of reasons.\n\nIn keeping with GGCâ€™s mission to ensure that all community members feel included in a welcoming environment, students and employees may choose to provide an optional preferred first name that will appear in the specific applications listed below.\n\nIf provided, the preferred first name will be displayed in the following systems:\n\nGrizzly Den within Banner\n\nMyCourses\n\nClaw Mail / Office 365 / Microsoft Teams\n\nClass Picture Book\n\nMentee Picture Book\n\nStarRez\n\nAdditional applications may be added to this list in the future.\n\nStudent and employee legal names will remain unchanged in all other college-related systems. By providing a preferred first name, students and employees understand that a preferred first name may not be used for purposes of misrepresentation, and Georgia Gwinnett College reserves the right to remove a preferred first name that is not in keeping with the intended purpose of this service.\n\nPlease note:\n\nLegal names will be required for students enrolled in eCore courses.\n\nPreferred names will not be used in cases where legal name is required, including but not limited to, financial aid documents, official transcripts, diplomas, human resources and payroll records, and federal immigration documents.\n\nTimeline\n\nPreferred first names will be enabled in the specified applications beginning August 3, 2022. Because this is a new offering, some previously entered data may need to be updated. Please follow the preferred name change process to update your information if necessary. If you need assistance, please contact @email.\n\nHow to Request a Preferred First Name Change\n\nStudents\n\nCheck and update preferred student first name via Grizzly Den within Banner.\n\nOnce a preferred first name is entered it may take up to 2 business days for the change to be reflected in the applications that support preferred first name.\n\nEmployees\n\nCheck and update preferred employee first name via OneUSG.\n\nOnce a preferred first name is entered it may take up to seven business days for the change to be reflected in the applications that support preferred first name.\n\nRelated Information\n\nLegal name changes: If you have legally changed your name, students should visit the Registrar office and employees should visit Human Resources to update your legal name in college systems.\n\nGGC directory profile update request\n\nFrequently Asked Questions"
