        "text": "Use a preferred name\n\nDeclare/change to preferred first name\n\nChange your legal name or other biographical data\n\nCreate an email alias\n\nUse a preferred name\n\nThe College recognizes that some students may prefer to use a first name other than their legal name to identify themselves. As long as the use of a preferred first name is not for an improper purpose, students may request their preferred first name be used where possible in the course of College business and education. We are striving to create an educational environment where students may use a preferred first name wherever a legal name is not required on internal documents, communications, systems, and web portals. The full policy can be found in the Student Handbook.\n\nAt present, preferred first name will appear on:\n\nFaculty Class Rosters\n\nStudent ID cards\n\nDiplomas and Honor Certificates\n\nBlackboard\n\nNavigate\n\nIn the future, we plan for additional student record processes to include preferred first name.\n\nIn accordance with policy, a student’s legal name shall be used on all College documents, systems and communications external to the College and/or where a legal name is required. Examples include, but are not limited to:\n\nFinancial Aid Records\n\nStudent Account Records\n\nHealth Records\n\nPayroll Records\n\nStudent Personally identifiable Information\n\nStudent Directory Information\n\nOfficial Transcripts\n\nFederal Immigration Documents\n\nInteractions with Government Agencies\n\nDeclaring a preferred first name does not change a student’s legal name. Changing Biographical Data section of the Student Handbook documents how to change a student’s legal name on all College records.\n\nDeclare/change to preferred first name\n\nNew or Returning Students\n\nA new student is a first-time NSCC applicant and has never enrolled in a course. A returning student is someone who has not been enrolled in a course in the last 2 years.\n\nA preferred first name can be declared on the admissions application or at the time of re-admission.\n\nCurrently Enrolled Students\n\nComplete the Preferred First Name Form. Your request will take 5-7 days to be processed.\n\nQuestions regarding the process can be forwarded to records@northshore.edu from NSCC student email.\n\nAn email notification will be sent to your NSCC email address when the system is updated to include your preferred first name. Upon receipt of the notification, you can pick up a new student ID at one of the campus libraries.\n\nOnce your preferred first name has been added, it will be used by the College until you withdraw the request. The College reserves the right to modify, change, alter or rescind at any time and at its discretion the Changing Biographical Data Policy.\n\nIf the use of a preferred first name is for an improper use, including but not limited to misrepresentation or attempting to avoid a legal obligation, a student may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including expulsion.\n\nChange your legal name or other biographical data\n\nTo change your legal name and/or gender on College records, you must complete the form below and upload two documents:\n\nA certified copy of a court order indicating a legal name change and/or gender change has been granted.\n\nA goverment-issued photo ID showing the new legal name and/or gender (for example: Mass ID, driver's license, or passport)\n\nIf you present evidence to the College that your name, gender, or other biographical information has been legally changed, the College will recognize that change in our records and in the application of our policies.\n\nYou will be notified by college email when the process has been completed, or if additional documentation is required.\n\nLegal Change of Name or Gender Request\n\nProcess to create an email alias\n\nLog into your NSCC Email Account\n\nOnce you open your NSCC email inbox, click on your profile picture, then click My Account.\n\nUnder \"Personal info & privacy,\" click \"Your personal info\".\n\nIn the Name field, click on the arrow to continue with changing your name.\n\nUpdate the first name field to reflect your preferred first name, then click Done.\n\nChanges will take approximately 30 minutes to reflect your preferred first name.\n\nNorth Shore Community College is an accredited nonprofit public institute of higher education where all are welcome and each is challenged."
