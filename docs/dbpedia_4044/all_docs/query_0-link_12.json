        "text": "Jackson, a city in Madison County, Tennessee, USA, serves as the county seat. Situated approximately 70 miles (110 km) east of Memphis, it holds significant importance as a regional trade center for West Tennessee. As of the 2020 United States census, the city’s total population stood at 68,205. Jackson plays a central role in the Jackson, Tennessee metropolitan area and is part of the combined statistical area known as Jackson-Humboldt, Tennessee.\n\nWith its substantial population, Jackson takes the title of Madison County’s largest city and is the second-largest city in West Tennessee, next only to Memphis. Notably, it houses the courthouse for the Tennessee Supreme Court, specifically serving West Tennessee, due to its prominence in the region during the establishment of the court in 1834.\n\nDuring the antebellum era, Jackson functioned as a pivotal market city for an agricultural region heavily reliant on cotton cultivation—the primary commodity crop. Its importance surged in 1851 when the city evolved into a vital railroad hub, connecting major markets in the north, south, east, and west. This strategic development attracted numerous traders and railroad workers during the late 19th century, especially after the American Civil War, when railroads were constructed.\n\nJackson’s railway connectivity was so robust that it enjoyed the daily service of 15 passenger trains up until the 1960s. However, due to industry restructuring, this service reduced, leading to job losses. Nevertheless, the city’s economy adapted and embraced new businesses, with a focus on major manufacturing in the area.\n\nThe SS Lane Victory is an exceptional American cargo ship that belonged to the Victory-class and played crucial roles in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. In 1989, it was thoughtfully preserved and transformed into a museum ship, now located in the San Pedro area of Los Angeles, California. As one of the few surviving Victory ships, it holds great historical significance and has been honored with the designation of a U.S. National Historic Landmark.\n\nThe ship’s name, “SS Lane Victory,” pays tribute to Lane College, which was founded in 1882 in Jackson, Tennessee, as a high school for black youths. The college was established by Isaac Lane, a respected bishop of the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church in America, and the ship’s name serves as a lasting commemoration of this institution’s important legacy."
