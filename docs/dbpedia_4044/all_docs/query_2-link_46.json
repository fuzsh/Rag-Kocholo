        "text": "In a concerning trend for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), the NFL Draft of 2024 closed without any HBCU prospects being selected. This absence marks the second occurrence in the past four years, mirroring the 2021 draft, sparking concerns over the visibility and evaluation of talent from these institutions. The recurring oversight has catalyzed the establishment of platforms like the HBCU Legacy Bowl and the NFL-backed HBCU Combine, aimed at amplifying exposure for HBCU talents. Despite these efforts, the draft outcomes have shown only a marginal increase in the selection of HBCU players. After the 2021 draft’s disappointment, Deion Sanders, the then-head coach at Jackson State, expressed his frustration on social media, advocating for greater recognition of the deserving athletes at HBCUs. The 2022 draft saw a slight improvement with four HBCU athletes picked, but this number dwindled again by 2023. Last year, Jackson State’s cornerback Isaiah Bolden was the sole HBCU player drafted, selected 245th overall by the New England Patriots. Over the past five drafts, HBCU representation has been minimal, with just eight players drafted, highlighting a significant underrepresentation. This year, players like Virginia State’s cornerback Willie Reed and Howard University’s left tackle Anim Dankwah, standing at an impressive 6-foot-8, were on draft radars but ultimately overlooked. This ongoing issue raises critical questions about the evaluation processes and the need for enhanced mechanisms to ensure that HBCU athletes receive the recognition and opportunities they rightfully deserve. #HBCU #NFLDraft2024 #BlackCollegeFootball #HBCULegacy #SportsEquality #UnderrepresentedAthletes #BlackExcellence #CollegeSports\n\nIn honor of HBCU Week, Randstad USA's African Heritage BRG is sharing fun facts about HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) each day this week to increase awareness of their value and significance. See below for our Day 1 post from earlier this week. Thanks to our HALO (HBCU Alumni Leadership & Outreach) team for putting together our programming for HBCU Week! Anissa Patman, Regan Toomer, Tamara Lapsley, Felisia Martin, Lorraine Reece. HBCU Week Day 1: Prior to the Civil Rights Movement, Black Americans had limited routes of obtaining a college degree. The creation of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) helped to fill that void. These public and private institutions helped Black Americans pursue professional careers, earn graduate degrees, and advance their education in an inclusive environment. On February 25, 1837, Cheyney University of Pennsylvania became the nation's first HBCU. Today, there are currently 107 HBCUs serving more than 228,000 students in 20 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Alabama is home of the most HBCUs totaling 14 schools. There are several benefits of attending an HBCU, including affordability, after-college preparedness for students, and overall student experience. HBCUs are ripe with traditions and a culture that defines each institution. Attending a step show, cheering on your school at the Battle of the Bands, gathering with friends and alumni during Homecoming, or just hanging on the Yard are part of what makes attending an HBCU special. Let’s not forget about our Black fraternities and sororities, which are the heartbeat of HBCUs and affectionately known as the Divine Nine. HBCU graduates go on to work in prestigious professions. In fact, 50% of all Black lawyers and 70% percent of Black doctors in the U.S. are graduates of an HBCU. In addition, HBCU graduates comprise 80% of Black judges and 50% of Black public school teachers. HBCUs not only provide inclusive and diverse educational experiences, they also provide a nurturing and supportive environment for underserved communities. Students are surrounded by other young people with similar backgrounds, unique perspectives, and the ultimate goal of obtaining a college degree at a reputable university. HBCUs provide that and so much more. #hbcusmatter #diversityequityinclusion #collegesuccess #recruitment\n\nThe upcoming launch of the summer pilot program marks an exciting moment for the SF HBCU Satellite, responding to the Black community, but benefiting the entire City, driving economic growth and fostering diverse talent pipelines. #HBCU #SummerProgram #CommunityImpact In a couple of weeks, the summer pilot program will be launched, with one article hailing the summer cohort as the vanguard of the SF HBCU Satellite. This summer's programming is poised to lead the way in what could be a significant movement. The Satellite was recommended at Dream Keeper community meetings and and by the reparations advisory committee, along with longstanding requests from Diane Gray and others, this initiative not only benefits the Black community but also brings economic advantages to the city and boosts the talent pipeline. According to reports, HBCUs have a substantial economic impact on communities, with students from these institutions experiencing increased earning power. Consider these numbers: - 25% of African American graduates with STEM degrees hail from HBCUs - 70% of Black doctors in the country are HBCU alumni - 80% of Black judges have graduated from these esteemed schools\n\nDid you know that Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) represent only 3% of the nation's educational institutions, yet their impact is profound? Consider this: 25% of African-American college graduates earn their degree at an HBCU. 50% of African-American public school teachers graduated from an HBCU. 50% of all future African American lawyers graduate from an HBCU. 80% of all African American judges graduated from an HBCU. 38% of all African American healthcare professionals graduated from an HBCU. 41% of all degrees in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and math) were earned by African American students graduated from an HBCU. These statistics underscore the pivotal role HBCUs play in shaping the landscape of higher education and professional attainment for African American students. They are not just institutions of learning but pillars of opportunity, fostering success and excellence across various fields. By providing targeted education and support, HBCUs are instrumental in bridging the gap and ensuring equitable access to opportunities for underrepresented communities. They serve as engines of social mobility, propelling students toward fulfilling careers and contributing to the nation's workforce. As we strive for economic growth and diversity, it's imperative that we recognize and invest in the invaluable contributions of HBCUs. By supporting these institutions, we not only empower individuals but also enrich our society as a whole, driving progress and prosperity for generations to come. Let's celebrate the legacy and impact of HBCUs, and commit to championing their mission of empowerment and excellence. Together, we can build a future where every individual has the opportunity to thrive and succeed. #EmpowerHBCUs #DiversityInEducation #EconomicGrowth\n\nHBCUs saved my career before it even started. Graduating high school with an impressive 5.5 GPA, I thought the world was at my feet. Little did I know, the path to greatness wasn't a straight line, but a winding journey. After just one semester at Bethune-Cookman, I found myself teetering on the edge of flunking out. It was a wake-up call. The illusion of having it all crashed, but in the wreckage, I tapped into my HBCU Community. In the midst of my struggle, two pillars emerged: Drs. Mowatt and Yahya. These Black male educators became more than mentors; they were beacons of wisdom, guiding me through the storm. Their support was my compass, steering me back on course. Surrounded by daily displays of Black excellence, I learned a vital lesson – my journey needn't mirror anyone else's. It was a revelation that reshaped my mindset. Life, as I realized, is 10% what happens and a staggering 90% how you respond. Failing early and often became my mantra, a stepping stone rather than a stumbling block. This newfound resilience propelled me not only to graduate with a bachelor's degree but two master's degrees as well. To my fellow high achievers and perfectionists: Embrace your mistakes; grace starts with yourself. HBCUs aren't just institutions; they are transformative spaces where challenges morph into triumphs, and dreams find wings. #HBCUJourney #BlackExcellence #TriumphOverAdversity #iseeyouhbcu #bethunecookman #blackmaleeducators\n\nHBCUs are a crucial source of underrepresented talent, with their graduates bringing diverse perspectives that drive innovation and growth. According to a Gallup report on minority college graduates, Black/African-American HBCU graduates report better outcomes than B/AA graduates of predominantly white institutions on many measures. Recognizing this value, 75% of companies actively recruit from HBCUs. However, University Recruiting leaders note they face substantial challenges recruiting at HBCUs, including standing out to students amidst intense competition. Join us for a webinar on June 12th at 1PM to learn how to maximize your impact in HBCU recruitment. We’ll explore best practices for launching and maintaining HBCU partnerships and attendees will hear from a panel of top UR leaders as they address the most pressing HBCU recruiting questions.
