His depth of project experience and metallurgical knowledge enhances the ability of the Board to guide management as we continue to unlock value at Candelones. Our recent PEA on our oxide project, and the recent multi-million ounce Mineral Resource Estimate for the sulphides sets the basis for future planning. Steve’s innovative experience in both heap leaching and sulphide processing will help on all fronts as we continue to move our projects up the value chain.”\n\nThe Company also announces that the Board of Directors has approved the grant of stock options (\"Options\") to directors of the Company allowing for the acquisition of an aggregate of up to 200,000 common shares of the Company (\"Shares\") with an exercise price of $0.22 per Share and an expiry date of June 1, 2026.

The Company is focused primarily on exploring and developing its gold assets in the Dominican Republic. The Candelones oxide gold deposit is within the 100% owned Neita Fase II exploration concession located in Dajabón province, in the northwest part of the Dominican Republic. The Candelones project area is about 20 kilometers south of the town of Restauraćion. The oxide deposit occurs at surface as a result of the tropical weathering of underlying mineralization. Unigold has been active in the Dominican Republic since 2002 and remains the most active exploration Company in the country. The Neita Fase II exploration concession is the largest single exploration concession covering volcanic rocks of the Cretaceous Tireo Formation. This island arc terrain is host to Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide deposits, Intermediate and High Sulphidation Epithermal Systems and Copper-gold porphyry systems. Unigold has identified over 20 areas within the concession area that host surface expressions of gold systems. Unigold has been concentrating on the Candelones mineralization and continues to expand the deeper sulphide resources with on-going drilling.\n\nForward-looking Statements\n\nCertain statements contained in this document, including statements regarding events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results, financial position and cash flows, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.
