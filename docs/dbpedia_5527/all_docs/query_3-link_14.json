        "text": "Our hometown is where our roots lie; that is where our ancestors were born. I was born in Loma De Cabrera Capotillo in the Dominican Republic. Loma de Cabrera is the second largest city in the province of Dajabón, Dominican Republic. It is located in the northwest portion of the country, in the Cibao region. The Dominican Restoration war was a guerrilla war between 1863 and 1865 in the Dominican Republic between nationalists and Spain. On August 16, 1863, was el Grito de Capotillo (the Scream of Capotillo) which was a scream that the soldiers made after they won the war did the scream to let the others know that they won the war. In 1986 They built a monument with all the names of the soldier that fought in the war. Where they make the Grito de Capotillo, there is a Dominican flag and the flag stick that has all the soldiers name written.\n\nLoma de Cabrera is the birthplace of well-known merengue artist Fernando “El Mayimbe” Villalona. He was the first person to be called El Mayimbe, and is one of the influences in the Dominican Republic. Rafael Furcal, the former Major League Baseball shortstop, is the biggest influence in Loma De Cabrera because he helps with the community and he has his own organization for baseball players that want to make it to the MLB (Major League Baseball).The poet Cristino Gómez wanted to become the government of Loma De Cabrera, but then he decides to became a teacher. He teaches people that want to become writers, and painter Juan Andújar was the first painter from Loma De Cabrera to won five different awards. These 4 famous people went from the bottom to the top because of the hard work and dedication.\n\nThe river named Dajabón, also known as Massacre, runs through Loma de Cabrera. The same river separates the city of Dajabon from Haiti. Loma de Cabrera has a very popular river falls called “Balneario El Salto”, which is a very popular tourist place for Dominican residents. It is one of the deepest rivers in Loma De Cabrera. You are going to see people in the river in the morning, but more people go in the afternoon and leave the river around 8 pm. This river is always full of people. The best way to go to this river is to spend the whole day in the river. People go an have a cookout by the river spend the all day in the river and they play games, eat, and drink. I like to go early so I can take the best spot to prepared everything for the cookout, but when I don’t go to do a cookout, I like to go after 6 pm to the river because there are no people in the river, and it is calm and you can relax.\n\nThe economy of Loma de Cabrera is based on agricultural production, especially Plantain, Yucca, cocoa, rice, and milk. Most of the people in Loma De Cabrera live from the farm like selling the milk to a milk company that is called “la codal”. They get paid around 5000 Dominican pesos every two weeks. But people from the community and other places can go and buy the milk for 100 Pesos a gallon. The other biggest business is the sale of dulce (caramel) and cashew nuts. you can buy the dulce in a bottle or in a bar, The bar is 75 pesos and the bottle is 150 Pesos.\n\nThe week of August 16 is the week of the Dominican Restoration. The week of August 16 is a week of celebration, that takes place in the monument in Capotillo Loma De Cabrera is a litter community north to Loma De Cabrera where all the farms are and the Monument where all the soldier names. the. In this celebration, people set up little store where they sell alcohol, food, and necklaces. The government of Loma De Cabrera gives school material to children like backpack, notebook, and pencil. what I like most about of the week of August 16, is the different famous people that you can see and the different artists. I can spend time with my friend and family and have a great time.\n\nThere is also the most famous religious place called La Virgen (the virgin). Where they have a little house with the statue of La Virgen De La Altagracia. People that live close to La Virgen go every time that they want to talk to the Virgin and they light a candle. Many people go walking in a group because they say the Virgin helps them more if you go walking. One time with my family we wanted to experience how people felt when they walked to La Virgen, so me and my family walk to La Virgin and prayed to her it is was the most relaxing moment of my life, we walk back home happy without any problems in our mind and our relationship as a family has grown up and we have communicated better after that day.\n\nLoma De Cabrera is always going to be in my heart. For me there is no place like it. I can be living in the most beautiful place in the world, but I will never feel the same like living in my hometown where everyone takes care of each other, with the best river, and places where you can relax and have fun. No matter where you live, there is no place like your hometown because you will never forget those childhood memories and the place where your parents took care of you and you grew up."
