Whether you're giving a first-aid demonstration to local schoolteachers, hiking through the jungle to survey remote communities, or spending the afternoon taking vital signs in a rural clinic, your efforts allow us to better serve the residents of Restauración and the surrounding communities.\n\nAll volunteers have the opportunity to participate in both the clinical and health education aspects of operations on-site, and activities can range from participating in a nutritious cooking class with mothers from the community to shadowing in one of the local health clinics.\n\nOver the course of your trip you'll receive an unfiltered experience in health care field work abroad, and learn about the tremendous impact that even one person can have. At our end, so as to maximize your contribution, we will tailor your experience based on current needs, your interests, training, and amount of time that you spend with us on-site in Restauración.\n\nWant to volunteer in the Dominican Republic in the future? Fill out the form below to get in touch with us and let us know you’re interested, and we’ll keep you posted!"
