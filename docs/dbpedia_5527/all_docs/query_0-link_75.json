        "text": "The Haitian capital is in a state of panic. Billowing black smoke now stains the capital in multiple clouds, their acrid scent mingling with the tension that hangs heavy in the air. Burning tires, trash, and piles of torched broken glass from Molotov cocktails litter the streets. Masked gangs roam the shadows of once-vibrant sections of the city, now abandoned and in ruin. It is haunting to see the city's frayed edges.\n\nHaiti stands at a precipice, teetering as heavily armed criminal gangs lay siege to the government in a violent bid for power. What was once a simmering crisis has erupted into full-blown chaos, as brazen gang leaders like Jimmy \"Barbecue\" Cherizier openly challenge Prime Minister Ariel Henry's legitimacy.\n\nThe unravelling in Haiti has accelerated at a startling pace over the past week, with events careening towards outright state collapse. Armed gangs have dramatically escalated their tactics, staging a coordinated and brazen nationwide assault that included storming two major prisons and freeing around 3,700 inmates.\n\nThe jailbreaks in Port-au-Prince and the nearby Croix des Bouquets prison represent a massive influx of manpower for the criminal militias. Among those sprung were even suspects charged in the 2021 assassination of former President Jovenel Moïse –a grim sign that the gangs aim to rewrite the rules by force.\n\nTheir declared motives are clear: force the resignation of interim Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who is reportedly under the watch of the US Secret Service in Puerto Rico after travelling to Kenya last week and unable to land back in Haiti due to the unrest. Gang leader Barbecue, a former police officer accused of orchestrating previous massacres, issued an ominous declaration of unified intent across the capital's gangs.\n\n\"All of us, the armed groups in the provincial towns and the armed groups in the capital, are united,\" Barbecue stated, casting himself as a military commander preparing for the final offensive. \"The government could fall at any time.\"\n\nAnd in many ways, it already has. With gangs now controlling an estimated 80 per cent of the capital region, basic governance and services have grounded to a halt across much of Port-au-Prince. Schools, businesses and neighbourhoods have shuttered in fear of the spiralling anarchy. Up to 15,000 residents have already fled their homes to take shelter at ad-hoc displacement camps.\n\nThe police have proven incapable of responding, suffering casualties and station assaults that forced a distress call for military backup that never materialised. Journalists arriving at the main penitentiary on Sunday found its doors flung open, debris and bodies strewn about as the last several inmates cowered in fear of the crossfire.\n\nIt paints a portrait of a nation disintegrating by the hour, with even its core institutions like the criminal justice system being dismantled through impunity. Gangs have effectively checkmated the state's authority, seizing all leverage to demand political capitulation.\n\nThe escalations have only amplified calls from both inside Haiti and overseas for Henry to resign and cede to a transitional governing council that could stabilize the crisis. With his mandate expired, protest movements had already been demanding his exit before gangs initiated their latest onslaught.\n\nHenry had agreed to step down by February 7 but refused, exacerbating public anger. Opposition voices, including former acting Prime Minister Claude Joseph, have accused him of obstructing the path to new elections by clinging to power, calling the turmoil a \"nightmare\" as \"criminals are using violent means to force him to step down.\"\n\nFor Henry, the bitter irony is that his quest to Kenya was focused on finally approving a long-stalled multinational security force to help combat the gangs. Instead, the ensuing chaos has made the prospect of any such intervention seem more remote than ever before.\n\nAs the world watches Haiti's warped descent unfold, it has become increasingly clear that any solution will require far more robust international commitment and resources than currently envisioned. Permissive environment or not, assertive military deployments may be required alongside incentives for the gang hierarchies to stand down.\n\nHaiti's waking nightmare threatens to morph into a permanent acute crisis destabilising the entire Caribbean region through refugee deluges and abetting the rise of a narco-terror state. For a nation battered by so many man-made and natural calamities, the final indignity remains losing its sovereignty to roving criminal armies imposing their barbaric brand of order on the populace.\n\nThe images are jarring – Barbecue holding improvised press conferences while brandishing assault rifles, his foot soldiers with wrapped faces manning machine guns by his side. The former cop turned outlaw has morphed into a self-styled guerilla commander, his G9 gang federation representing the vanguard of an expanding criminal rebellion.\n\nThe gangs' motives are layered– a mix of criminality, political opportunism, and a warped lust for dominance over this ill-fated Caribbean nation. But their tactics over the past week have been undeniably brazen and coordinated. They have unleashed a wave of destruction; they have struck at key infrastructure like the main airport and port to choke off vital import routes. Police stations have been firebombed, while officers suffered casualties in open street battles against the gangs' high-calibre weaponry.\n\nThe situation is complicated, said a Haitian politician speaking to THE WEEK, “the gangs are taking over the streets, killing, raping women and children, all of this, the people are living a nightmare and hoping for a savior...they are tired of these fellows. In comes this guy, Guy Philippe.”\n\nThe scenes are sickeningly reminiscent of the brutal coup d'etat in 2004 that ousted then-president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, an event that was orchestrated in part by another former police officer turned gang leader – Guy Philippe. Now, Philippe has surfaced again alongside Barbecue's gang alliance in demanding Henry's resignation. It's a combustible mix of old menaces and new emergent threats.\n\nTo understand how Haiti reached this nadir, one has to revisit the traumatic chapters that laid the kindling for the current crisis and the rise of gangs as a de facto force in national affairs.\n\nEchoes of previous upheavals\n\nThe ghost of Guy Philippe has long haunted Haiti. The former coup leader's reemergence today carries echoes of the 2004 rebellion that removed Aristide in a hail of violence and chaos remarkably similar to current events.\n\nAt the time, Philippe commanded a rebel army that emerged from the slums of Port-au-Prince. His forces swiftly took over swaths of the country as they advanced on the capital, feeding on widespread discontent with Aristide's leadership and allegations of corruption. The rebels encountered minimal opposition from Haiti's overstretched and underpaid police and military.\n\nAs the rebels closed in, the US, France and Canada took the controversial step of deploying troops in what was viewed by Aristide's supporters as a modern-day coup enabling the gangs' final push. Faced with an untenable situation, Aristide was swept onto a US plane and into exile, clearing the path for Philippe and his men to be feted as liberators upon their arrival at the national palace.\n\nBut their reign was fleeting. A UN peacekeeping mission soon took over from the US-led forces, restoring a thin veneer of order after the chaos. Yet Philippe's legacy as a menace was only beginning.\n\nIn the years after the coup, criminality metastasised as he and his rebel army effectively transformed into one of Haiti's earliest hyper-violent gangs, leaching off drug trafficking routes and other illicit commerce. They carved territory in the slums of Cite Soleil and brought massacres, kidnappings and terror to those densely populated neighbourhoods.\n\nPhilippe eventually went into hiding in 2007 after being charged with a slew of crimes by the interim government. But his legacy and the culture of violence he seeded persisted and mutated, taking on a self-perpetuating life of its own.\n\nJust out of US federal prison, Philippe aims to take over the country\n\nIn a brazen power play, Philippe has reemerged with ambitions of taking control of the country he once helped tear apart through violence. Just months after being released from nearly six years in US federal prison and deported back to Haiti, the 54-year-old has allied himself with the powerful gang federation led by Barbecue in a bid to overthrow the interim government.\n\nPhilippe's return comes with the memory of his previous insurrection in 2004 when he commanded a rebel army sparking years of chaos and emboldening criminal gangs. After initially being hailed as a revolutionary force, Philippe transformed his militia into one of Haiti's first major criminal syndicates.\n\nHis illicit activities came to a head in 2017, when Philippe won election to the Haitian Senate representing the central plateau region. However, he was arrested by US drug authorities just before being sworn into office, facing money laundering conspiracy charges tied to Colombian cocaine traffickers.\n\nIn the US, he ended up cutting a plea deal, receiving a nine-year sentence that saw him incarcerated from June 2017 until being released from an Atlanta federal prison on November 30, 2023. He was then swiftly deported back to Haiti despite concerns raised by some former US diplomats about potential destabilising impacts.\n\nAccording to reports from The Wall Street Journal, Philippe told Reuters last week, \"Ariel Henry should resign. I think he should stay where he is now... and let Haitians decide their fate.\" He has advocated for the creation of a three-person transitional council to take the reins of governance amidst the chaos, aligning with Barbecue's armed rebellion against the interim prime minister.\n\nIn recent days, Barbecue's G9 gang federation has launched one of its most audacious offensives yet, battling to encircle Prime Minister Henry's residence as he remains stranded outside Haiti. With Philippe now asserting involvement, the revolt takes on the air of an outright criminal coup attempt.\n\nThe New York Times reports US officials are monitoring Philippe's reemergence with \"great concern.\" For a Haiti already teetering towards collapse, his return represents one of the darkest echoes from its tumultuous past resurfacing. Philippe's brazen quest for power could ensure the nightmare's most damaging chapters still lie ahead.\n\nHow gangs grew in power\n\nHaiti's modern gangs can be traced back to the proliferation of local neighbourhood \"bakala\" groups that originally formed as self-defence militias and security brigades in the slums of Port-au-Prince in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nAs political instability grew under Presidents Aristide and Préval, these bakala crews became radicalised - some aligning with pro-government militants, others with opposition groups seeking Aristide's ouster. The 2004 coup provided an opening for former members of the disbanded Haitian military to co-opt certain bakala outfits into more organised criminal enterprises.\n\nIn the power vacuum after Aristide's removal, these armed gangs exploded in number and expanded into drug running, kidnapping and extortion rackets. Within three years of the coup, the UN had identified over 30 criminal organizations operating in the Port-au-Prince area alone. These ranged from local street crews and former pro-Aristide militants to more sophisticated outfits with international ties delving into regional drug trafficking, illegal immigration, and kidnapping rackets.\n\nAmid this expanding underworld, dons like Amaral Duclona emerged to rule whole swaths of the capital's most miserable slums like a feudal lord. His revolutionary taxes – extortion fees paid by businesses and citizens alike – became a fact of life in neighbourhoods like Cite Soleil and La Saline. Bloody turf wars between Duclona and rivals like Evens Lamine repeatedly cancelled out tenuous police pacification efforts.\n\nIf Haiti government held any illusion it could reassert control over these areas, it was shattered in 2010. The catastrophic magnitude 7.0 earthquake that levelled Port-au-Prince extinguished what little remained of civic governance and infrastructure. Police outposts were obliterated, prisons collapsed freeing scores of inmates, and the government itself ceased to function for weeks.\n\nIt proved to be a blitzkrieg opportunity for gangs, who fanned out to scavenge and loot from the ruins, preying on the desperation of displaced multitudes crammed into squalid tent camps. Arms smugglers enjoyed a windfall, flooding the eager black market with a fresh supply of high-powered American and Yugoslavian weaponry leached from collapsed armouries.\n\nThe gangs had taken the baton from Philippe's revolutionary army. But this time, there was no political ideology or figurehead calling the shots beyond the enrichment of criminal elites. Just Darwinian gang warfare writ large over a traumatised nation.\n\nFor ordinary Haitians, it meant increasingly being caught in the crosshairs. Massacres sparked by petty disputes over territory became a regular occurrence, with women and children caught in the crossfire. Sexual violence and forcible recruitment of child soldiers proliferated. Common criminals showed little hesitation about deploying military-grade ordnance in turf battles, recounted former Haitian presidential candidate Level François in an extensive interview with THE WEEK.\n\nOne particularly harrowing flashpoint came in late 2022 with a massacre in the Cite Soleil neighbourhood. Nearly 200 people were killed in a door-to-door killing spree by the G9 federation, a powerful alliance of gangs including Barbecue's crew. What set off this cataclysm of bloodshed according to local accounts? A mere rivalry over hotly contested cannabis trafficking territories.\n\nHellish lives that had once been grim now plunged into outright dystopian for the moth-eaten slums and outer reaches of the city where gangs reigned supreme. With the national police unable to enter, these essentially became ungoverned zones, suffering perpetual food and medical deprivation alongside the spiralling violence.\n\nA UN statistic laid it bare: Haitians were now at greater risk of being kidnapped by gangs than in eight different United Nations peacekeeping missions around the world. For a country that has seen more than its share of calamities, it was a chilling distinction of just how illusory the government's hold remained.\n\nGangs gain economic stranglehold\n\nWhile the gangs blossomed amid chaos, seizing political power was never the initial motivation. Their aims were rooted in something more primordial – controlling economic arteries to maximise profitability from their criminal enterprises.\n\nTo the gangs, unchallenged port dominance and unrestricted movement of contraband across the border with the Dominican Republic were invaluable strategic assets. These hubs enabled the lucrative trafficking that has fuelled their rise: the funnelling of drugs, weapons, ill-gotten fuel supplies, and even United Nations food aid into their fiefdoms.\n\nExtortion rackets reaching into the business community were emboldened by this growing stranglehold over commercial activity. According to some estimates, gangs siphoned over $500 million per year from Haiti's formal economy to pad their illicit revenues.\n\nToday’s reality\n\nWith both the airport and key maritime terminals besieged amid the current chaos, these vital economic chokepoints have now become the frontline of a high-stakes gang gambit to extort political concessions from the state. If taken, it would formalise the criminal underworld's takeover of Haiti's commercial destiny.\n\nBut the gangs have also proven flexible in branching out beyond just physical contraband to adapt to new profit streams from Haiti's instability. One of the most lucrative for prominent gangs like G9 and G-PEP has been good old-fashioned kidnapping and ransom.\n\nRich and poor have proven equal victims for abduction crews targeting everyone from wealthy business scions to impoverished street vendors or schoolchildren seized outside their homes. Hostages have been guarded at remote gang prisons, overcrowded houses or even dilapidated warehouses while demands are made over WhatsApp to distraught families.\n\nTo outsiders, the amounts demanded can seem comically small: ransoms rarely exceeding $500,000 from even elite captives. But in a country where the average income hovers below $500 per year, even a $1,000 payment is immense leverage to extract from desperate Haitians.\n\nOn the gang's side, the economics are irresistible. With almost zero overhead cost beyond henchmen's wages and a few gallons of gas to mobilise, ransom remains a shockingly profitable revenue stream. A handful of kidnaps can generate more liquid capital than months of illegal cross-border smuggling operations.\n\nTheir methods have grown increasingly sadistic and wanton. Once hostages' funds are deemed fully drained, many meet grisly fates like execution or dismemberment, their battered bodies dumped along roadsides. Minors are sometimes butchered first to expedite payments as a grotesque warning. This intensely psychological warfare has stoked public terror across all strata of Haitian society.\n\nFamilies and whole communities now carry the psychological scars as the new normal has set in. Workers cling to their homes, too fearful to travel for their jobs. Children miss stretches of school. Markets stand empty as people simply try to avoid going outside and risking the wrong chance encounter with a roaming abduction crew.\n\nThe paralysis has subtly crippled Haiti's efforts at economic recovery and mobility. According to Haitian economist Knewton Vincent, the kidnapping crisis has likely wiped out 5 per cent or more of the country's entire GDP over the past five years via the compounding impacts of curtailed commercial activity. For a nation already the Western Hemisphere's most impoverished, the effect has been utterly destabilizing.\n\nPolitics in a vacuum\n\nWhile the gangs have steadily tightened their grip on Haiti's jugular, the civilian political leadership in Port-au-Prince has proven inept or incapable of stopping the malignancy.\n\nFor years after the 2004 coup, a succession of weak transitional governments appointed with international oversight proved unable to assert control beyond the capital while gangs flourished with impunity elsewhere. The interim regimes were too preoccupied with power struggles and unwinding the legacy of Aristide-era cronyism, allowing the gangs to expand their dominion with minimal contest.\n\nEven as a modicum of democracy was restored via national elections in 2011, chaos still predominated. Devastating natural disasters like the 2010 earthquake and Hurricane Matthew only exacerbated the sense of civic paralysis at the highest levels. The underwhelming presidencies of Michel Martelly and Jovenel Moïse saw the revolving door spin with scandal after scandal, further draining legitimacy from government institutions.\n\nWhile the gangs grew bolder over his tenure, Moïse himself became increasingly accused of adopting autocratic tendencies as he ruled by decree and sought to consolidate power. His increasingly isolated leadership ultimately ended in brutal fashion: Moïse appointed Ariel Henry as the new prime minister and just days later was gunned down in a murky 2021 assassination at his private residence that has never been fully resolved.\n\nThe motives behind who orchestrated the hit – some believing it was Hendy who masterminded it, as you will see below – and why, remain clouded. But it crystallised just how transient governing authority had become in Haiti. With Moïse gone, the transition process to replace him devolved into disarray as rival premiers jockeyed to fill the power void over the next two years of interim rule.\n\n“Henri was put as prime minister after the death of president Moïse, but in the Haitian Constitution the prime minister is not the head of the state, so he plays the role of what would be called as vice-president in, say, the United States Constitution, but because they only put him as prime minister and never put in a president, he is playing both the role of president and prime minister. But that complicates manners worse when the constitution says that if the president who appointed a prime minister steps down or for some reason is no longer in power, the entire government falls –which means the prime minister everybody else– and they have to come up with a new government. But given the situation in Haiti they did not do that,” noted François. Henri remains in office as prime minister and president.\n\n“But things get even more complicated when the time comes that even if the president Moïse were not assassinated, his term would have ended in 2019.” François expanded.\n\nBoth sides accused the other of illegitimacy and leveraged different sectors of the gang influence to try gaining leverage. The result was a further deterioration of order and consolidation of gang territorial control amid the political gridlock.\n\nHenry emerged from this morass to be the interim leader recognised by the United States and United Nations as a devoted constitutionalist looking to stabilise Haiti.\n\nBut from the outset, his credibility among Haitians remained compromised by the unsavoury cloud surrounding Moïse's assassination, being tapped by Moïse shortly before his death to serve as prime minister. Henry was also present at the late president's swearing-in ceremony alongside figures like former military intelligence officers now charged in the assassination plot.\n\nWhile Henry denied involvement, phone records later revealed he had been in contact with one of the main suspects just hours after the killing. The spectre of being complicit – whether as perpetrator or exploitative beneficiary – in the nation's most traumatic political crime has undoubtedly undermined Henry's moral authority. He now faces the prospect of being swept from power by the very gang elements who've stoked crisis for years.\n\nEmboldened gangs leverage crisis\n\nFor years, the gangs have crossed the murky line between pure criminal interests and politics when it suited them. At times they've allied with politicians and parties. At others, they've simply undermined the entire system through bloodshed.\n\nWhat is happening now is an acceleration towards an unprecedented endgame: removing the civilian government entirely and installing a gang federation as the direct power brokers over Haiti's future.\n\nThe brazenness is breathtaking\n\nGangs like G9 have spilled out from their strongholds, escalating their tactics dramatically with bids to capture institutional pillars of the crumbling Haitian state. They've launched direct assaults on the presidential palace and airport. Barbecue and gang allies like the former revolutionary leader Guy Philippe are openly threatening \"civil war\" if Prime Minister Henry refuses to resign.\n\nHenry himself has been rendered impotent, forced to shuttle between foreign locations like Kenya and Puerto Rico as his capital descends into lawlessness. He appears powerless to stop the momentum galvanising behind the gangs, who clearly see an opportunity to fully dismantle the current interim government before Haiti's scheduled elections in 2024.\n\nWhile the catalyst for the initial unrest remains murky, gang elements may have calculated that the moment to apply maximum pressure had arrived. Henry's political standing among both the public and international community was already tenuous. The gangs likely assessed they could foment enough disruption through jailbreaks, blockades and street battles to send the transitional process into full upheaval.\n\nPhotos of heavily armed gang members proudly brandishing rocket launchers, grenades and sniper rifles atop collapsed prison walls sent an unambiguous message: the state's authority in enforcing even basic rule of law had collapsed. If the brazen jailbreaks could happen without repercussion, what deterrent would stop their advances on greater institutional prizes?\n\nGeopolitical impact\n\nThe prospect of gang influence over Haiti's ports, airports and ministries is staggering geopolitically. Already, illicit profits from trafficking through the country allow groups like G9 to wield a formidable arsenal better suited for a guerrilla army. Territorial control over customs checkpoints and windfalls of ransom payments have directly fuelled their growth, training, and acquisition of military-grade munitions like heavy machine guns and armoured vehicles.\n\nIf this stranglehold extends to maritime terminals, airports and government offices, the transformation becomes complete. Gangs could weaponise the official levers of the state to extort foreign capital on an entirely new scale while opening direct pipeline access to global smuggling chains. Haiti would risk becoming a narco-state on the doorstep of the United States.\n\nFor the United States, already facing the migrant crisis from Haiti's unravelling, the national security implications would be severe. A gang-controlled Haitian state could not only supercharge illicit drug and human trafficking flows, but become a regional hub for outside criminal syndicates and terror proxies from as far as China, Russia, Iran and Venezuela. The island's strategic location in the Caribbean remains prized.\n\nInternational efforts so far inadequate\n\nThe world community has hardly been oblivious to Haiti's peril, issuing increasingly dire warnings about the resurgence of gang dominance over the past half-decade. But to date, efforts to reinforce the nation's sovereignty have proven insufficient.\n\nThe most consistently reliable presence has been the United Nations peacekeeping missions deployed to Haiti since the 2004 coup. Yet while they've provided a thin veneer of stability in Port-au-Prince through rotations of troops and police trainers, their mandates have always stopped short of engaging the gangs head-on.\n\nOriginally envisioned as supporting an elected government and transitional forces, the \"blue helmet\" deployments soon devolved into open-ended operations of limited efficacy. Endemic corruption, the horrific earthquake of 2010, and public relations disasters like the cholera outbreak sparked by UN troops only compounded the sense of failed stewardship.\n\nBy 2017, Haiti's anaemic national police force numbered an embarrassing 15,000 officers – less than half the UN's minimum advised level. The lack of manpower, combined with inadequate training and crippling budgets, continued to inhibit their ability to project authority beyond the fringes of the capital.\n\nFrustrated by the status quo, the United Nations moved towards downsizing its Haiti mission after 2017. But the draw-down corresponded with a resurgence in gang violence and territorial encroachment that rendered the police even more over-matched.\n\nBy late 2022, UN assessments grimly warned that criminal armies like G9 controlled somewhere around 60-80 per cent of the capital region through indiscriminate intimidation. Entire neighbourhoods had become no-go zones, with the government's presence limited to fleeting forays by demoralised police units lacking ammunition and gear.\n\nIt was under these dire circumstances that the United States and others began more concerted efforts to shore up the beleaguered Haitian state through bolstering the national police and supporting Ariel Henry's transitional government.\n\nA first step involved sanction campaigns targeting some of the most egregious gang figures, freezing their assets and restricting their international movements. But these seem to have done little to deter the recent escalations by players like Barbecue and their collaborators.\n\nMore substantively, the Biden administration has tried to marshal an international security assistance deployment to provide mentors, training, and beef up operational capacity for Haiti's overwhelmed police ranks.\n\nAt the White House's urging, the UN Security Council approved just such a mission in July 2022. However, nearly a year later, its proposed military deployment led by Kenya and accompanied by smaller contingents from other nations has yet to materialise fully on the ground.\n\nThe reasons are manifold: concerns over safety and optics of intervening in Haiti's endemic chaos, political squabbling over the mission's rules of engagement, and a general reluctance among Western powers to commit boots beyond a limited advisory posture.\n\nThe United States in particular has rebuffed calls to deploy American soldiers into the security maelstrom, with Pentagon leadership fiercely opposed to any sort of stabilization operation requiring direct military engagement. The Biden administration has instead tried cajoling other nations to lead the effort, offering logistical support and funding commitments.\n\nIn truth, the funding commitments have hardly been opulent, especially given the scale of what's being billed as one of the UN's highest priority humanitarian interventions. Washington has so far committed around $164 million towards the effort – barely 5 per cent of its announced annual military aid budget for Ukraine.\n\nSimilarly, modest sums have come from allies like Canada ($37 million) and offshore tax havens like The Bahamas ($1 million) located within proximity of Haiti's instability.\n\nIt raises legitimate questions about the overall level of resolve behind the international community's efforts. Haiti's latest crisis has expanded for months with only incremental outside response, creating a vacuum that emboldened gangs have dramatically escalated into their audacious push to topple the government outright.\n\nFires engulfing Haiti will extend regionally\n\nAs dire as the humanitarian suffering has been within Haiti from this proliferation of gang rule, it's also fuelling a series of secondary crises that will have severe regional consequences if left unattended.\n\nMost glaring is the explosion in Haitian refugee outflows straining resources on both surrounding territorial lands and shorelines. Over just the past year, the United States has tracked an 800 per cent increase in migrant interdictions of Haitian boats attempting to reach Florida.\n\nALSO READ: How migrants risk death in Darién jungle to get to US\n\nUS border agents have also apprehended over 100,000 Haitians attempting to enter from Mexico, representing one of the largest diasporas of any nationality being processed in American custody. Many migrants recount harrowing tales of fleeing gang violence, kidnappings and privation in making their decision to abandon the country at any cost.\n\nBut the United States is hardly alone in grappling with the exodus. Large groups have meandered South America from Chile to Colombia through the Darien Gap into Panama and to the US border in Mexico. Both the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos islands have reported being overwhelmed by continual Haitian refugee arrivals, often in grossly inadequate transport vessels like flimsy sail boats or overloaded freighters.\n\nRecovery operations are frequent, with dozens of Haitians plucked on a near-weekly basis from sinking crafts on the open ocean.\n\nThe maritime entries correspond to spikes in Haitian refugee flows stressing other Caribbean territories like Cuba, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. All three nations have deployed additional naval and coastguard assets in an attempt to gain control of their outer archipelagos from unchecked migrant landings.\n\nALSO READ: Stranded in the Atacama: Undocumented plight of immigrants caught between desperation and diplomacy\n\nYet Haiti's proximity as an origin point for refugees renders much of the Caribbean without a sustainable interdiction capability. Cuba alone is projected to surpass 50,000 Haitian refugee admittances this year, exacerbating food and housing pressures under the communist state's cratered economy.\n\nThe Dominican situation is even more incendiary, with Haitians comprising over 1.2 million of the country's immigrant populace. Entire cities, including the nation's second largest Santiago, have ballooned into de facto bi-national communities as waves of Haitian labour migrants crossed the border in recent decades seeking economic opportunity.\n\nBut the Dominican Republic's current government under President Luis Abinader has taken a harsh stance against the uncontrolled influx under banners of nationalism and preserving ethnic identity. Sweeping deportations and migrant detentions have regularly provoked outcries from human rights monitors about deprivations of due process.\n\nThe mass internal dislocations within Haiti now stand to further inflame these tensions. Dominican border forces are already engaged in aggressive interdiction against the tide of inbound refugees fleeing gang violence, erecting new walls and firing on Haitians attempting to enter illegally.\n\nMany regional analysts warn that uncontrolled flows risk tipping the island of Hispaniola – which Haiti shares with the Dominican Republic – towards a sustained period of ethnic conflicts, economic crises from refugee drains, and even military escalations along their shared 400km land border if the situation remains unresolved.\n\nPerhaps the only spectrum of Haitian society ironically insulated so far from the immediate effects of the gang chaos has been the nation's oligarch elite. For decades, Haiti's tiny cabal of ultra-rich industrial tycoons has sent their families into exile abroad while maintaining financial interests on the island through political corruption and gang payoffs.\n\nBut as their homeland becomes further destabilised by internal conflict and paralysed government, their continued investment is now open to question. If the oligarchs decide to finally sever capital ties completely, it could potentially deprive Haiti of one of its last remaining revenue streams for services and security.\n\nMore grimly, a starving government purse in Port-au-Prince could give already ascendant gang coalitions like G9 justification to fully nationalise the oligarch's assets, becoming the de facto keepers of the island's monetary reserves and commercial economic output. Coupled with maritime control, it would represent the final linchpin in a criminal organisation achieving true statehood on paper.\n\nA worst-case future\n\nGiven this harrowing scope, it's worth contemplating what the worst-case scenario portends if Haiti's descent into gang rule becomes fully manifested.\n\nAs horrific as the suffering has already been for Haitians, a complete vacuum of governance opens the gates to even more unspeakable degradations. Public services would inevitably collapse amid the security vacuum, furthering the spread of pestilence like cholera and disease pandemics with no functioning hospitals or sanitation.\n\nFood insecurity, already endemic, would become outright famine as traditional distribution lines are cut off by warring gangs exercising localised dominance over territory. Populations in gang-controlled zones would likely be starved into complete fealty amid humanitarian shortages.\n\nLaw and order could devolve entirely to the martial codes of whichever criminal syndicate was locally dominant. Their foot soldiers, many former street children forged into ruthless killers, would likely employ rape and torture as enforcement tools on a systematic basis.\n\nWith gangs entrenched as rulers, the exploitation of Haiti's future generations could become an entrenched practice, with children pressed into service as ammunition couriers or re-emerging as child soldier cadres enforcing orders as young as six or seven years old.\n\nThe island itself could become a permanent security black hole attracting a continual stream of opportunists, terror proxies, and international criminal franchises looking to establish forward bases.\n\nFlush with cash from illicit trade rackets, the new gang oligarchy could conceivably leverage modern accessories like drones and cyber warfare as offensive capabilities, turning Haiti into a vast criminal superstate with the Caribbean as its empire.\n\nWhile such a dystopian vision might seem hyperbolised, the contours already linger beneath the surface of what currently haunts the shattered Haitian republic. In every corner, the nation's resilient people already navigate a daily gauntlet of fear from abduction gangs who dismember with impunity and leave bodies rotting as public warnings.\n\nThe question is whether the final vestiges of the international order have either the resources or the resolve remaining to keep the island from fully subsuming into its Heart of Darkness. If not, the fires now engulfing Port-au-Prince could erupt into a conflagration burning the region for generations to come."
