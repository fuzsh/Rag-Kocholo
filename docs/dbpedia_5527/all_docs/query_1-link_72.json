Jamaica: Moneague, 26.VIII. 1934, Darlington (2 females USNM –most likely belonging to this species).\n\nDiagnosis. Dorsally very similar to other species of the genus, except for (frequently) very elongate body and elytra markedly sinuate subapically. Underside dark, at least in part, darker than in any other Laccomimus species. Median lobe of aedeagus distinctive, apex ending in characteristic small, bird head-like expansion ( Fig. 103 a, b).\n\nDescription. Habitus ( Fig. 65). TL: 2.1–2.5 mm; MW: 1.0– 1.3 mm (holotype: TL: 2.3 mm; MW: 1.2 mm); A- TL: 2.3 mm; A-MW: 1.2 mm (NUM: 67 exs); body elongate, drop-shaped, elytra often markedly sinuate subapically.\n\nColour. Head and pronotum paler than elytra. Head testaceous or reddish-brown, frequently darker between eyes; pronotum testaceous to reddish, often with darker, elongate marking along hind margin. Elytra brown, with quite sharply defined pale subbasal band, often fragmented in spots; subapical lateral yellow band extending to apex; a third, lateral, less defined yellow marking is frequently visible. Underside brown or dark brown, normally head, prosternum, epipleura, metacoxal processes, and last abdominal ventrite paler. Dark areas always present, at least in part, although very variable in extension. Antennae and mouthparts testaceous. Legs uniformly testaceous except for dark metatarsi.\n\nStructures and sculpture. Head smooth, shiny, with fine microreticulation of rounded cells. Pronotum with microreticulation as on head, shiny, with faint iridescence. Few scattered punctures mostly along fore and hind margins. Elytra with subapical sinuation quite pronounced; smooth with quite impressed reticulation and intense iridescence. Prosternal process ( Figs 29–31) slightly elevated, rounded at tip. Lobes of metacoxal processes rounded in both sexes ( Fig. 40).\n\nMale. Last abdominal ventrite tectiform, with antero-lateral sides markedly sinuate ( Fig. 42). Outer claw of forelegs scimitar-shaped ( Figs 50; 70). Median lobe of aedeagus, in left lateral view ( Fig. 103 a, b), slender but robust, base and distal portion forming a very wide angle, then straight, regularly narrowed to apex, ending in characteristic small, bird head-like expansion. In dorsal view ( Fig. 113) similar to that of L. pumilio . except for a visible constriction on left side, close to base, and apical fourth strongly narrowed with hooked tip; dorsal lamina straight along its whole length; ejaculator groove wide, gradually narrowed to apex. Left paramere ( Fig. 103 c) curved, gradually tapering to apex.\n\nFemale. Last abdominal ventrite triangular, very narrowly rounded to subtruncate at apex ( Fig. 43). Lateral tergites thin, partly membranous. Gonocoxal blade as in preceding species; ramus ( Fig. 120) similar to that of L. pumilio . except for teeth a bit larger.\n\nDistribution. Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil (Mato Grosso), Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, Panamá, Paraguay, Venezuela, Virgin Islands ( Figs 126; 128).\n\nEcology. Field data suggest a wide ecological range with collections from both stagnant and running waters. In Young’s letter to Spangler, the following field observations are given for this species in the Virgin Islands: “adults and larvae of Laccomimus were collected from shallow water at the edge of the pond in an open field on St. Croix (…). They were found beneath a mat of wiry grass growing over the margin of the pond. By bending the mat of vegetation back onto the bank and anchoring it, the shallow margins of the pond were exposed and could be easily worked with a dip net. Vegetation accumulated in working the pond margin with the net was dumped onto a ground cloth. Adult Laccomimus were surprisingly agile. They jumped rapidly much like fleas as soon as they were dumped onto the cloth and they often jumped completely off the cloth and escaped. Most of the adults would have escaped without the rapid use of a suction bulb aspirator. The slow-moving larvae could be easily hand picked from the cloth.” In Calilegua National Park ( Argentina) some specimens were collected from the margins of a large vegetated pond at 750 m a.s.l., partially exposed to direct sunlight, with turbid water rich in organic matter, sparse marginal vegetation and absence of floating vegetation (Fig. 130).\n\nEtymology. The specific name is a noun in the genitive case which was given in litteris by Frank N. Young and Paul J. Spangler, in honour of the collector Carlos Bordon (cf. Young 1974: 2, 3).\n\nNotes on variability. In spite of its wide distribution, no relevant morphological variation was observed between populations. An exception is the partially dark underside, which is always present, but varies in extent (often this is the only diagnostic feature to distinguish females of this species). The shape of the median lobe is very constant among the studied specimens."
