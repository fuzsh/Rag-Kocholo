The formal association has been in operation since 1990 but lacked the capital to make major changes to the way they farmed. The grant will give them the opportunity to significantly increase their volume and yield. The $4,000 CCF grant will pay for much of the materials needed for the construction of the greenhouse and represent the first economic development project approved (as a pilot) under the CCF. The 30 families in the association will benefit directly from the produce grown in the new greenhouse. Approved October 2015\n\n91: Four Communities near Elias Pena - Construct 80 Efficient Cooking Stoves Working through a committee of community leaders of the communities of Comendador, Pinzon, Hato Viejo and Sabana Larga (all located within 20 minutes of each other in the outskirts of Elias Pena), PCV Bruno Estrada has assisted the communities to cooperate in developing a cooking stoves construction project. A total of 80 households and 440 persons will benefit from the project. The environmentally-friendly cement and clay stoves emit significantly reduced harmful gases, reduce costs of fuel through their efficiency, reduce the need to cut trees for fuel and vent smoke out of the kitchens and away from harm to children playing in the kitchens while their family cooks. A $4,000 CCF grant pays for the purchase of cement and the clay piping that is needed for the construction. Approved October 2015\n\n90: Jabonico (Sanchez Ramirez) Potable Water Well- drilling project The small rural town of Jabonico located in the central foothills has been without accessible clean water for more than a year as a result of a failed water source. Assisted by PCV Tiven Buggy, the community formed a six-member Water Committee to develop a plan and financing for a solution to the water problem impacting the lives of the 60 families and 310 people living in the town. The community requested a $3,455 CCF grant for the costs of drilling a new well near the community and building a 500-gallon storage tank. The community will provide all of the labor and pay for the cement, rebar, cement blocks and a water pump to bring the water to existing water lines and into the homes. A maintenance and replacement fund has been established that each benefitting family pays into monthly to sustain the new water supply system. Half of the grant funds will come from the Robert Kultsad Memorial Fund. Approved September 2015\n\n89: Villa Jaragua (Barahuco) - Construction of 50 Healthy, Fuel-Efficient Stoves PCV Katy Falletta helped organize the community around its number one priority – reducing costs of cooking and reducing the dangerous fumes from their current inefficient stoves. Several of the families to be benefitted, currently do all of their cooking on open, three stone cooking areas while many others are using cost-inhibiting gas stoves for much of their cooking. This project is a continuation of a successful, recently completed, project which constructed 35 stoves. The current project will use a CCF grant of $3,752 to pay for materials to construct 50 new stoves benefitting 300 persons. The beneficiaries will provide the labor and provide some of the materials costs. Approved September 2015\n\n88: Candelon (Dajabon) - Construction of 15 Sanitary Latrines . Located in the northwest Province of Dajabon and near the Haitian border, the small, rural community of Candelon, with its 75 households, has been actively working with PCV Hannah Cranford to improve health in the community. The PCV’s community diagnostic revealed that 60% of the homes surveyed used latrines that serve multiple homes and almost on-half of those were in very poor condition. A project to construct new latrines was developed in partnership with the community’s “Healthy Homes” project, headed up by a group of female health promoters focused on community health. They requested a $3,017 CCF grant to help pay for the costs of materials to construct 15 new pit latrines serving 60 persons in the town. Approved September 2015\n\n87-15: Mariano Cestero and Vara de Vaca (Dajabon) - Development of a Community Library/Computer Learning Center Two small communities composed of 491 residents located near the Haitian border town of Restauracion have long been interested in improving basic education for its children and adults. Reading materials available in the community consisted of 15 books. The closest library materials were 7 miles away. A committee of youth, the “Grupo de Jovenes par el Desarrollo Comuntario”, formed in 2014 to begin planning for the creation of a library and learning center. With the help of Education Promotor PCVs Julie Pangborn and Emerson Roberts-Donnelly, the Committee focused on creating a library/literacy/internet center to extend the educational opportunities for students and for adults who never had the opportunity to obtain an adequate education. The Committee secured vacant building in need of rehabilitation owned by the Ministry of Agriculture, for re-use as a library/computer center. A major fund-raising effort was made to obtain resources. Instrumental in the feasibility of the project was the $4,000 CCF grant contributed to purchase building materials and installation of a new, reliable power source for the new library building. Approved August 2015\n\n86: Restauracion (Dajabon) - Community Library The organizational/planning effort of the Committee for the Development of Restauracion Municipal Library, with the assistance of PCV Kinnerly Croisant, developed a feasible plan to create a new community library for the town of 3,000 residents and 2,000 more in the surrounding area. The plan includes opening up space for a computer room, expanded books and reference material space and the installation of a battery powered generator to extend the hours of use. Fifteen hundred books will be added to the reconstructed library. The Community Challenge Fund will support the project with $512 to purchase chairs and desks. Approved August 2015\n\n85: Punta Larga & Hernandez Alonzo (Sanchez Ramirez) – Improved Cooking Stoves The small community of 100 households located in the central mountain range has been using open cooking fires for centuries. The health issues associated with the inefficient burning of wood in a confined, unvented building are well-documented. The community planned to use the $2,814 CCF grant to construct 30 stoves. As the first few stoves were going into use, the popularity of the new, clean, fuel-efficient stoves quickly increased. Five more stoves were added to make the total 35 stoves constructed benefitting 175 Dominicans. Twelve stoves were reserved for women who completed a Health course delivered by PCV Jocelyn Dorland. Approved May 2015 – Completed October 2015\n\n84: Batey 80 (La Romana) – Solar Electrification of School Library Batey 80, located in the agricultural area of the southeastern coastal plain, is among the poorest of communities in the country. PCV Sarah Twing worked with group of enthusiastic teenagers to plan and develop a small library in the community school. The town of 400 had no place for evening study nor any reference materials and books for reading and study. The CCF provided a $2,120 grant for the solar energy system to provide lighting for evening study and computer learning. Approved May 2015 – Completed August 2015\n\n83: Copey & Manzanillo (Monte Cristi) - Construction of 40 Improved Cooking Stoves Located near the northern Haitian border, the communities of Copay and Manzanillo, working with PCV Brownen Raff, submitted a request for a $3,834 CCF grant to pay for materials to build 40 Improved Cooking Stoves serving 220 people. Beneficiaries agreed to cook with the new energy-efficient, healthy stoves a minimum of 90% of the time, significantly reducing environmental and health impacts as well as costs of cooking with other methods. The Everett, Washington Rotary Club provided a special donation of $3,000 to the Challenge Fund toward the CCF grant for the project. The two communities of 4,000 residents had already completed construction of 30 stoves in an earlier project and used that experience to continue with the current project. Approved February 2015 – Completed September 2015\n\n82: La Mabrigada (San Juan) – Construction of Sanitary Cement Floors in Homes Of the 80 homes in the community of La Mabrigada, resting in the foothills of the central mountain range, almost one-half had dirt floors. PCV Nicole Winters had been working with community leaders to improve hygiene in the homes of families. A second component of the public health program was to improve sanitation in the home by constructing cement floors. A CCF grant of $2,996 to pay primarily cement and sand to construct floors in 34 homes, benefitting 210 residents was approved to support their efforts. Approved February 2015 – Completed August 2015\n\n81: La Lima (Santiago Rodriguez) - Construction of 15 Pit Latrines Only 30% of the homes in the small community of 250 tucked into the northcentral mountain range. The project, a key component of the Hogares Saludables conducted by PCV Grayson Caldwell, was identified as the community’s number one priority. The ten local Health Promotors selected the fifteen families to be included in the construction project. A CCF Grant of $3,884 provided most of the materials needed for the project. Approved February 2015 – Completed October 2015\n\n80: Hato Viejo (Elias Pina) – Development of Community Library in School Hato Viejo, a rural community of 500, was without a library. PCV Jimmy Graham helped organize the community around the development of a small library in the school. The 100 students in the school were without shelves to hold even their meager, overused books and reading materials. With a CCF grant of $284 to pay for the cost of materials for shelving, community members constructed the bookshelves. The Program Support Fund and other resources were used to purchase additional reading materials to supply the library. Approved January 2015 – Completed May 2015\n\n79: Ranchito de los Peralta, Angostura and Caonao (Puerto Plata) Construction of 30 Duncan Improved Cooking Stoves. The Duncan Stove project in the community of 450 persons is a continuation of a previous stove project extending the stove construction project to 30 more families representing almost 1/3 of the homes in the community. PCV Rivkah Cohen assisted community leaders to set up the project which included the contribution of $700RD by each participating family. A $3,307 CCF grant was the primary source of funds to pay for construction materials. Approved February 2015\n\n78: Gurabito de Yaroa (Puerta Plata) Development of Library in School The community of 400 located in the mountains of Puerto Plata lacked a library for 105 students in the elementary school and the multi-grade school. PCV Katherine Buckingham, working with teachers in the school developed priority list of books and reading materials which were purchased with FDR Program Support Funds. The CCF grant of $268 paid for the materials to construct shelving to hold the books. Approved January 2015\n\n2014 PROJECTS APPROVED\n\n77: Los Guineos (Sanchez Ramirez) – Construct 15 Sanitary Latrines Working tin the agricultural community of Los Guineos, home to 1,000 people, PCV Laura Thompson conducted a community diagnostic to determine the primary needs and interests of the residents. She found that the majority of homes in the two poorest neighborhoods of the five neighborhoods in the community did not have latrines. To begin working toward meeting that need, the community planned for the construction of latrines and applied for a CCF grant of $1,943 to construct 15 pit latrines. Approved December 2014 – Completed March 2015\n\n76-: Punta LargaKulstad, a former water project Volunteer in the DR. Approved July 2014 – Completed February 2015"
