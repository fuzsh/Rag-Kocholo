The agents of the Border Police (Polifront), responsible for monitoring the border who witnessed the scene did not intervene in the face of a crowd very motivated and revolted by this closure on the Haitian side\n\nHaitians threw a damaged border gate into the massacre river and entered Dajabón province in large numbers to buy food and other goods to take to Haiti.\n\nLet's remember that this is the second incident of its kind after that of November 28 where individuals sawed off the chains that kept the border gate on the Haitian side closed, allowing Haitians to transport large quantities of goods to Haiti for a few hours in trucks and 3-wheel motorcycles before the intervention of the Haitian police authorities and the installation of new chains.\n\nFor the moment, a meeting is planned between the Haitian authorities and it is not known whether they will prevent Haitians from participating in the commercial exchange this Friday at the Dajabón border market...\n\nLet's remember that the other binational markets are functioning and the doors are open on these days on the Haitian side as in Anse-a-Pitre https://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-41118-haiti-flash-dajabon-binational-market-closed-pedernales-open.html except in Ouanaminthe where the departmental authorities of the North-East and municipal condition the reopening of the doors on the Haitian side, by the lifting of all the Dominican restrictive measures taken against Haiti and the Haitians... Prime Minister a.i. Ariel Henry, during a meeting with these said authorities, on December 6 https://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-41155-haiti-ouanaminthe-pm-meeting-on-the-situation-in-the-border-area-with-local-authorities.html had however strongly urged the local authorities to avoid any individual decision and to favor a collective approach and consensual, in concert with the central power, with a view to better harmonization of the actions to be undertaken. Obviously without effect...\n\nVery angry Haitians at the border have threatened to rebel if there is another attempt to close the Haitian border gate.\n\nOn the Dominican side, on the orders of the Director of the Specialized Land Border Security Corps (Cesfront), Freddy Soto Thormann, surveillance was reinforced on the border bridge on the Dominican side to deal with any eventuality.\n\nSee also :\n\nhttps://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-41155-haiti-ouanaminthe-pm-meeting-on-the-situation-in-the-border-area-with-local-authorities.html\n\nhttps://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-41131-haiti-flash-tension-rises-at-the-border-dajabon-militarized.html\n\nhttps://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-41123-haiti-flash-the-pnh-violated-dominican-territory-at-the-border-video.html\n\nhttps://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-41118-haiti-flash-dajabon-binational-market-closed-pedernales-open.html\n\nhttps://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-41044-haiti-economy-merchants-and-transporters-call-for-the-reopening-of-the-haitian-border.html\n\nhttps://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-40970-icihaiti-flash-ouanaminthe-border-bridge-prohibited-under-penalty-of-very-heavy-fines.html\n\nhttps://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-40752-haiti-flash-haiti-keeps-its-door-closed-the-dominican-government-will-not-give-in.html\n\nhttps://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-40698-haiti-flash-partial-reopening-of-the-dominican-border-new-measures-and-an-embargo.html\n\nSL/ HaitiLibre"
