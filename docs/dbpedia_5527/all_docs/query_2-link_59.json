        "text": "SANTO DOMINGO: The Dominican government on Sunday began building a wall that will cover more than half of the 392-kilometer (244 miles) border with Haiti, its only land neighbor, to stop irregular migration and the smuggling of goods, weapons and drugs.\n\nWhile the two countries share the island of Hispaniola, they are worlds apart in terms of development. Crime-plagued Haiti is one of the poorest nations in the Americas while the Dominican Republic, a popular Caribbean tourist destination, has prospered in recent decades amid marked political stability.\n\nMany Haitians cross the border clandestinely in search of work in the fields or in the construction industry in the Dominican Republic.\n\n“The benefit for both nations will be of great importance,” said Dominican President Luis Abinader shortly before pushing the button to begin pouring concrete into the foundations of what will be the wall in the province of Dajabón, some 230 kilometers northwest of the capital.\n\nAbout 500,000 Haitians and tens of thousands of their descendents live in the Dominican Republic, a Spanish-speaking nation of about 11 million people, according to the most recent immigration survey conducted in 2018.\n\nAbinader estimated the border wall will reduce the smuggling of commercial goods, weapons and help fight organized crime in both nations.\n\nHe started the project, which aims to build a 164 kilometer wall, ahead of the anniversary of the Dominican Republic’s independence from Haiti on Feb. 27, 1844.\n\nAbinader said the first phase of the project will be completed within nine months at the latest.\n\nThe 20-centimeter-thick concrete wall topped by a metal mesh will be 3.9 meters (12.8 ft) high and will have fiber optics for communications, movement sensors, cameras, radars and drones.\n\nThe project also includes the construction of 70 watchtowers and 41 access gates for patrolling.\n\nLONDON: British foreign minister David Lammy is set to travel to Israel in an attempt to prevent an all-out war in the Middle East, Sky News reported on Thursday, citing a diplomatic source.\n\nAlso on Thursday, a Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office statement quoted Lammy as urging UK’s partners in the Middle East to “choose peace” amid rising tensions in the region.\n\nCommenting on the restart of negotiations on a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza, Lammy said: “We are at a crucial moment for global stability. The coming hours and days could define the future of the Middle East, that is why today, and every day, we are urging for our partners across the region to choose peace.\n\n“As the UK made clear at the UN Security Council this week, the situation in Gaza is devastating. The strike on the Al-Tabeen school demonstrated that Palestinians in Gaza have nowhere safe to turn.\n\n“These talks are an opportunity to secure an immediate ceasefire that protects civilians in Gaza, secures the release of hostages still cruelly held by Hamas and restores stability at a dangerous moment for the region,” he added.\n\nLammy said Britain would continue to push for a ceasefire and would work with allies to achieve one, as he pointed to discussions between Prime Minister Keir Starmer and leaders in the US, France and Germany, as well as the presidents of Iran and Egypt.\n\n“It’s clear from these conversations that a ceasefire would not only protect civilians in Gaza, but also pave the way for wider de-escalation and bring much-needed stability for the Middle East,” he said.\n\n“It is in the interests of both Israelis and Palestinians for a deal to be agreed, urgently. I urge all parties to engage in the negotiations in good faith and show the flexibility needed to reach an agreement.\n\n“I thank Qatar, Egypt, the US and all international partners for their efforts in co-ordinating this vital moment.”\n\nSTOCKHOLM: Sweden on Thursday announced the first case outside Africa of the more dangerous variant of mpox, which the WHO has declared a global public health emergency.\n\nThe country’s public health agency confirmed to AFP that it was the same strain of the virus that has surged in the Democratic Republic of Congo since September 2023, known as the Clade 1b subclade.\n\n“A person who sought care” in Stockholm “has been diagnosed with mpox caused by the clade I variant. It is the first case caused by clade I to be diagnosed outside the African continent,” the agency said in a statement.\n\nThe person was infected during a visit to “the part of Africa where there is a major outbreak of mpox clade I,” state epidemiologist Magnus Gisslen said in the statement.\n\nThe patient “has received care,” Gisslen said. The agency added that Sweden “has a preparedness to diagnose, isolate and treat people with mpox safely.”\n\n“The fact that a patient with mpox is treated in the country does not affect the risk to the general population, a risk that the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) currently considers very low,” it said.\n\nThe outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has killed 548 people since the start of the year.\n\nWHO declared the outbreak in the DRC and neighboring countries a public health emergency of international concern on Wednesday.\n\nFormerly called monkeypox, the virus was first discovered in humans in 1970 in what is now the DRC.\n\nIt is an infectious disease caused by a virus transmitted to humans by infected animals but can also be passed from human to human through close physical contact.\n\nThe disease causes fever, muscular aches and large boil-like skin lesions."
