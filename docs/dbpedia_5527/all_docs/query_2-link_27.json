They asked for suspended exports by air and sea of products included in the prohibition of Haiti, until the restriction is removed by road. He also asked the Dominican government provide assistance to producers and traders affected this ban, the creation of funding mechanisms and tax breaks to encourage those affected and allow the expansion of border trade.\n\nLikewise, they stated that is requested to the Government of Haiti a greater flexibility with their citizens buying products on the binational market, because many times these purchases are seized and destroyed, even those that are not banned, which causes problems on both sides of the border.\n\nRecall that this decision is also part of the context of the resumption of bilateral dialogue on October 13, where it was agreed that in the next 15 days will gather Ministers of Industry and Commerce of the two countries, entrepreneurs and representatives of the European Union, as well as Customs officials to define an agreement to enhance trade and standardization of land transport between the two countries https://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-15450-haiti-dominican-republic-resumption-of-bilateral-dialogue.html\n\nSee also :\n\nhttps://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-15487-haiti-social-the-desperation-and-hunger-affect-haitians-at-the-border.html\n\nhttps://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-15427-haiti-flash-fenatrado-strengthens-its-blockade-at-the-border.html\n\nhttps://www.icihaiti.com/en/news-15425-icihaiti-flash-fenatrado-imposes-a-border-blockade.html\n\nhttps://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-15405-haiti-economy-trade-totally-paralyzed-at-the-border-of-dajabon.html\n\nhttps://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-15369-haiti-politic-against-the-restrictions-from-haiti-dr-gets-support-from-several-countries.html\n\nhttps://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-15338-haiti-politic-application-of-bans-measures-at-border.html\n\nhttps://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-15250-haiti-economy-the-ccio-congratulates-the-transport-restriction-measures-on-dr-products.html\n\nhttps://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-15247-haiti-economy-restriction-of-products-from-dr-also-a-protectionist-measure.html\n\nhttps://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-15236-haiti-economy-restrictions-on-transport-of-dominican-products-wilson-laleau-persists.html\n\nhttps://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-15196-haiti-economy-adih-support-the-transport-restriction-on-23-products-from-dr.html\n\nhttps://www.icihaiti.com/en/news-15229-icihaiti-economy-the-economic-forum-supports-the-transport-restriction-on-23-products-from-dr.html\n\nhttps://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-15199-haiti-politic-dr-open-to-dialogue-with-haiti.html\n\nhttps://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-15156-haiti-notice-import-ban-by-road-of-certain-products-from-dr.html\n\nhttps://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-15196-haiti-economy-adih-support-the-transport-restriction-on-23-products-from-dr.html\n\nhttps://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-15196-haiti-economy-adih-support-the-transport-restriction-on-23-products-from-dr.html\n\nhttps://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-15196-haiti-economy-adih-support-the-transport-restriction-on-23-products-from-dr.html\n\nhttps://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-15156-haiti-notice-import-ban-by-road-of-certain-products-from-dr.html\n\nSL/ HaitiLibre"
