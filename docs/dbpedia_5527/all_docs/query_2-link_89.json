        "text": "Bad credit is a big sin to mankind.\n\nMy credit cards debt kept me in a complete state of dilemma and almost caused me depression because it was drooped to a very low score of 424. I already had eviction and several collections including car loan, It was obvious I won’t get approved for anything at the same time I was trying to build my business but everything was very tough and difficult until I came across “INVISIBLE FRIEND CREDIT GROUP” on several sites.I decided to email him on invisiblefriend6661 (AT) gmail DOT com . I had to make very serious research because I was afraid of losing my money. Five days after I contacted them, my scores were raised between (TU:760, EQ:790, EXP: 773). Credit cards debt appeared as paid on time, eviction and others were discarded. I was very curious at first until I pulled my report and confirmed the great job done. He also helped me build my business credit. How well should I appreciate INVISIBLE FRIEND CREDIT GROUP for this job well-done other than sharing my experience with GUYS ? you can give them a try for all sort of credit related issues and you will be glad you did. (209) 878 7391) Thanks."
