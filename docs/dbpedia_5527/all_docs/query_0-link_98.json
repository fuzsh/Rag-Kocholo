        "text": "Some dishes are known and enjoyed equally all around the country: Mangú, our mashed plantains with vinegar red onions breakfast dish, Arroz blanco, the Dominican white rice, Habichuelas guisadas, stewed red kidney beans, and carne guisada (stewed meat, typically Pollo guisado chicken, but also pork or beef).\n\nAll over the Dominican Republic, Mangu con Los Tres Golpes – mashed green plantains with fried cheese, salami, and eggs – is served for breakfast, and La Bandera Dominicana – the Dominican flag – is served for lunch.\n\nEverywhere Habichuelas con dulce, our red beans dessert, is served for Lent and Easter, and Pasteles en hoja and Lechon asado are Christmastime staples. And we all celebrate joyous occasions with Sancocho, our national stew.\n\nMany of our traditional dishes are also common throughout Latin America – part of our common Spanish heritage - but many of these are uniquely Dominican.\n\nThe occasional visitor could be forgiven for thinking there are no regional cuisines in the Dominican Republic just because this is a small country. This is true to a point, but to us Dominicans, it is evident that each region has dishes that represent them.\n\nFollow us on a culinary tour of the Dominican Republic and learn about some of the most iconic regional Dominican food.\n\nLa Linea - the Northwest region\n\nThe Northwest region of the country is popularly known as \"La Línea,\" which includes the provinces of Montecristi, Dajabón, Mao, and Santiago Rodríguez.\n\nThe Northwest Line has a variety of ecosystems, some with impressive coastlines, beautiful golden sand beaches, and tropical desert forest vegetation, with hills covered with bushes, cactus, and mesquite trees (cambrones).\n\nIt is also where most of the salt consumed in our country comes from.\n\nChivo liniero\n\nWild oregano grows in the area, and the large goat population that feeds on it --purportedly seasoning themselves as they walk and breathe-- is the best-known part of its cuisine.\n\nThe northwest's flagship dish is Chivo liniero (or Chivo guisado picante), a braised, spicy goat seasoned with aromatic herbs, abundant oregano, and ajicitos picantes (Scotch bonnet peppers). We love it served with Moro de habichuelas (rice with beans), some Tostones (fried plantains), and some slices of Dominican avocado.\n\nLambí guisado\n\nIn the coastal areas, there is a small but important fishing industry. Seafood dishes are a staple of Liniero cuisine, and Lambí (conch) is one of the delicacies of Montecristeño cooking.\n\nTostones and Arroz blanco are my choice of side dish with Lambí guisado (stewed conch).\n\nCasabe\n\nCasabe, a cassava bread, is one of our most ancient foods, and the staple of the indigenous Taino diet. While casabe is consumed in several Latin American countries, it is a very important part of Dominican cuisine and is eaten in every corner of the country.\n\nSantiago Rodríguez, however, is considered the capital of Casabe production in the Dominican Republic and a source of pride for this province, formerly a Montecristi municipality.\n\nCasabe is enjoyed as a snack (loved smeared with Mambá, the Dominican savory peanut butter) and served toasted alongside Habichuelas con Dulce in this region.\n\nCibao region\n\nThe Northern region shares some dishes with the Cibao Valley (the central part of the island). The valley is an agricultural region with fertile land, majestic mountains, and a moderate climate.\n\nSantiago de los Caballeros is the capital of the Cibao region and the second-largest and wealthiest city in the Dominican Republic. La Vega, Moca – where the best yuca comes from –and Bonao are also part of this fertile and industrial center, and all boast a rich culinary tradition.\n\nIt's not uncommon to find some dishes that are known by different names than in the rest of the country – most notably Arepa, which is Torta in the Cibao and North region. But dishes like Guanimo and Buche perico originate in this region and were virtually unknown elsewhere in the country.\n\nArepa\n\nArepa is one of our favorite desserts, and it's made with cornmeal (corn flour), milk, and raisins. The most popular is the sweet version, but Arepa salada, a savory version, is also well-known.\n\nArepa is cooked in a Dutch oven (caldero) over hot coals; more hot coals are placed on the lid. This is the origin of the expression \"como la arepa: fuego por arriba, y fuego por abajo\" (like arepa: fire on top, fire underneath), meaning to be in the crossfire or a tight spot.\n\nBuche perico\n\nBuche perico – a corn, vegetables, and pumpkin stew – has become more popular after we published the recipe years ago, even though it had already appeared in cookbooks by cibaeña authors in the first half of the last century.\n\nBuche perico is typically served as a substitute to Habichuelas guisadas, and we love it with Arroz blanco (and Concón!) and some avocado slices.\n\nGuanimo\n\nLike arepa, guanimo is a dish that has a savory and a sweet version. The sweet version is the most popular, but the savory one, Guanimo salado is the first time I encountered this dish in my native Montecristi.\n\nGuanimo is a tamal-like dish made with cornmeal, and cooked inside corn husk, although I have heard of people cooking them in plantain leaves, as we do Pasteles.\n\nThere's an expression in this region, \"como un guanimo\" (like a guanimo) used to pejoratively describe a lady wearing clothes too tight for her figure.\n\nYaroa\n\nYaroa – which reminds me of Canadian poutine – is the Dominican version of loaded fries. It is a newcomer to street food and was created in Santiago as a nighttime food for partygoers. Perfect with one of our Dominican juices or una fría – a frosty-cold beer.\n\nThere are two versions of yaroa, one with mashed ripe plantain as the base and one with French fries. It is topped with ground beef, melted cheese, and drizzled with mayonnaise and ketchup.\n\nOur yaroa recipe combines both versions, so you don't have to choose which of these flavors is best.\n\nSanto Domingo and San Pedro\n\nSanto Domingo and the Southeast have always been a magnet for immigrants, which has left an imprint on the region's cuisine.\n\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, a wave of immigrants from the Middle East arrived on our shores and settled mainly in San Pedro de Macorís and Santo Domingo. With them came several dishes that later became part of our culinary heritage.\n\nKipe (or quipe)\n\nKipes or quipes are the Dominican version of the Lebanese kibbeh, but instead of using lamb (which is not a popular meat in our country) we use beef, as well as changing some of the spices and taste of the traditional Middle Eastern dish.\n\nIt is one of our blog's most popular Dominican dishes, and a must during the Christmas celebrations.\n\nTipili\n\nTipili or Tipile is the Domnican version of tabbouleh, a popular Middle Eastern bulgur salad. As with kipe, the ingredients have been changed to adapt it to the Dominican taste, most notably in not adding as much parsley as the Lebanese version and leaving out mint.\n\nDominicans of Middle Eastern descent typically make it closer to their ancestral version.\n\nNiños envueltos\n\nNiños envueltos, a rice and meat cake wrapped in cabbage leaves, evolved from the Egyptian malfouf mahshi. However, several countries outside of MENA also have similar dishes in their repertoire.\n\nArroz con fideos\n\nArroz con fideos, a rice pilaf with golden brown noodles mixed in, is the Dominican version of ruz bil shereya, another Middle Eastern dish.\n\nGuavaberry\n\nAnother group of immigrants who settled in the southeast was \"cocolos,\" who came from the British Caribbean.\n\nThey gave San Pedro Guavaberry, an alcoholic beverage that is only made in San Pedro de Macorís, and is now part of their Christmas tradition. Made with a fruit Dominicans call Arrayán – guavaberry in English – this delicious liqueur contains cinnamon, cloves, allspice, rum, and sugarcane.\n\nYaniqueque\n\nThere are two versions of yaniqueque in our country, and both sides swear theirs is the original, one from Samana (which we mention further down) and cocolo Johnny cake, which we turned into the better-known Yaniqueques. Curiously, these are known as Arepas or Arepitas in parts of La Linea, which – to keep with a theme – sprinkles some extra confusion on our national food conversation.\n\nDomplines - Dominican dumplings - are a popular dish of Cocolo origin, and virtually unknown in many areas of the country. It is an inexpensive, filling, and comforting dish for those who grew up with it.\n\nThe Southwest region\n\nSouthwestern cuisine bears the imprint of our African ancestors and has several dishes in common with neighboring Haiti. Baní, known for producing salt, and seemingly every colmado owner in Santo Domingo, is best known for some of the best Dominican dulces (desserts).\n\nFurther west, Azua – which I consider my native Montecristi's spiritual sister – is also recognized for its great goat meat.\n\nSan Juan de la Maguana is known as \"el granero del sur\", or the South's granary, and boasts fertile lands and great quality habichuelas. Let's not forget Barahona, where the best plantains come from, and the rest of the Southwest, with its seafood production and unique dishes.\n\nMany dishes here have different names than in the rest of the country, as is the case of Chacá, the Southern version of Maíz caquiao, which we mentioned above.\n\nChenchén\n\nChenchén, or Dominican grits, originate in this region of the country. Stewed goat meat is also popular in this region of the country, and it's commonly served with Chenchén, as we show above. I also served some Arepitas de yuca (and Arañitas) with it.\n\nChacá\n\nAnother case of dishes known with different names in different regions is Chacá soup-like hominy dessert known in the North and Cibao as Maíz caquiao, which we have mentioned already above.\n\nChambre\n\nChambre – also known as Chapea – is a Dominican stew that combines rice, guandules (pigeon peas), red beans, and meat—a hearty, inexpensive solution to weekend meals."
