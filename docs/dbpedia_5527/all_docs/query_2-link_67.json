        "text": "National Holidays and Remarkable Dates\n\nThe Dominican national spirit, built over four centuries, finds multiple expressions in the diversity of religious, secular and patriotic celebrations that are reflected in the annual commemorative calendar.\n\nDuring their holidays, Dominicans remember that they are part of a history that defines their present. They convey values, affirm their identity and provide context and reference to their culture. They integrate music, dances, songs, beliefs, costumes and gastronomy that relate to them.\n\nThey are celebrations in which they express “devotion, joy, color… their love for life and their desire to share with others,” according to the publication “The Dominican / All Things Dominican,” of Global Foundation for Democracy and Development (2016).\n\nDominicans always have something to celebrate. There is never a lack of positive reasons, as shown in the festive yearbook, which is full of Patron Saint festivities, national celebrations, birthdays of heroes, fairs and family gatherings.\n\nSecular and religious festivities\n\n1 of January – New Year\n\nThe New Year celebration begins shortly before midnight on December 31st with family and street parties, or in nightclubs. To attract good luck, some Dominicans traditionally dress in white, wear new outfits, burn incense, paint their houses and buy new household goods.\n\nHoly Christ of the Bayaguana Miracles\n\nOn January 1st, at the conclusion of the Los Toros del Cristo de Bayaguana festival, which has colonial roots, the faithful congregate for the auction of the bulls and calves that have been donated to the Church, as well as for the Mass and the procession of the Holly Christ. The celebration begins on December 28 with the entrance of the bulls to the Shrine and with the songs of praise by the pilgrims. Horsemen dressed as cowboys ride through the streets and the irreverent sticks its face in a clothes, food and drinks market. The holy image arrived in Bayaguana in 1606 with its founders, uprooted from the towns of Bayahá and Yaguana by the Spanish Governor Antonio Osorio.\n\nJanuary 6 – The Three Wise Men\n\nOn this date, Dominican boys and girls wait for the toys that the Three Wise Men from the East, who brought gifts to the little Jesus, will bring to them. The previous night the children put their offerings under their beds, or at the foot of the Christmas trees: candy and cigarettes for the kings and grass and water for the camels. On the 5th, the city of Santo Domingo holds its version of the celebration with a parade of the Three Kings mounted on horseback.\n\nJanuary 21 – Our Lady of Altagracia\n\nThe veneration of the spiritual mother of Dominicans is one of the oldest and most widespread. Her image in oil paint dates back to the late 15th or early 16th century, and goes hand in hand with the foundation of Higuey in 1505. In Santo Domingo this veneration goes back to the La Altagracia chapel of the Nicolás de Bari hospital, the first in the New World. The festivities in her honor begin in the Basilica of Higüey, starting on January 12 with novenas, prayers, and a great pilgrimage accompanied by drums and call and response songs. The day of La Altagracia is a holiday and the festivities in her honor take place all over the country.\n\nFebruary 2 – Our Lady of La Candelaria\n\nThis title of the Virgin Mary is celebrated in the municipality of Sabana Grande de Boyá, in the province of Monte Plata, in the municipality of Guerra, in the province of Santo Domingo, and in the capital district of San Carlos.\n\nFebruary 16 – Saint Elijah or the Baron of the Cemetery\n\nThe blending of popular religious beliefs have named St. Elias as the Baron of the Cemetery and the head of the Guedé Division. The first deceased that is buried in each cemetery is identified as this Baron and the faithful offer him food, flowers, candles, songs and prayers.\n\nMarch 3 and 4 – San Benito de Palermo\n\nThe community of Guayabal, in the province of Azua, marks San Benito’s festivity with prayers, music, food and dances.
