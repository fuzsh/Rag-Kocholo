        "text": "This is not the first and will not be the last armed conflict over water rights in the strange new world of environmental degradation.\n\nEvery adult Haitian and most adult Dominicans know why the river demarcating the border between the Republic of Haiti and the Dominican Republic is called the Rio Masacre. As you may read in our article “Ukrainians of the Caribbean/Ucranianos del Caribe.” It is those ‘Parsley Murders’ that cannot be forgotten. In addition to the approximately 50,000 Dominican citizens subjected to judicial and extra-judicial murder under Trujillo’s reign, an estimated 20,000 Haitians were murdered indiscriminately by executive order of the El Jefe to ‘clear’ the borderlands of any Haitian presence on either bank. Actually, the killings were not quite indiscriminate. One was allowed to live if one could pronounce the Spanish word for parsley, persejil. If that extra syllable proved too much of a tongue-twister to people of African ancestry used to saying the simple French persil, then one was hacked to death. This was in the 1930s, and the term ‘genocide’ had not yet been coined by Polish lawyer Raphael Lemkin, but that is exactly what it was, the racial-ethnic and linguistic ‘cleansing’ of an entire people from a given area.\n\n“This history is uppermost in the minds of most Haitians when they hear of the Dominican Republic closing its border and even deporting Haitians and threatening armed intervention if Haiti follows through with its canal project to divert water from the Rio Masacre,” according to the Rev. Jean-Robert Simbert Brice, trilingual associate pastor of Saint John’s Catholic Church in Worcester, Massachusetts. Père Jean-Robert commented further to his penitent after Confession recently that in fact the Rio Masacre canal project had been agreed between Haiti and the Dominican Republic under Trujillo in the 1950s. Well, that was a long time ago, and nobody in the DR seems to remember it, certainly no Dominicans this observer has spoken with lately.\n\nPère Jean-Robert added one other interesting comment from the Haitian perspective: “The Dominican perception of Haiti geographically and agriculturally is that the Haitian third of the Island of Hispaniola is an ecological disaster and an agricultural wasteland. The Haitian view is that, if they had access to some water from the Island’s main freshwater stream, they could rebuild both the ecology and the agriculture of Haiti. Perhaps the Dominicans who grow and sell us virtually all of our food do not want to lose such a market. Perhaps that is why they do not want us to have the water.” If you can budget a few hours to hear the response, ask any Dominican to weigh in on that idea.\n\nThe Dominican Republic does have a fantastically diversified agriculture, to the extent Puerto Rico had before the American invasion and would have again if in control of its own post-colonial economy. Everything from world-standard avocados to cacao and chocolate production to sugar cane to medicinal herbs powers the Dominican economy. Not only raw materials but cheap, cheap labor, some of it off the books and on the barter system, and some labor practically free. This is the free and undocumented labor of Haitians, doing mostly night work in security and manufacturing, living in the forests surrounding the great haciendas, terrified of deportation to the hell-on-earth that Haiti’s oligarchy and lack of a functioning state has made for its own people. ‘Negrito-power’ is how this black slavery is sometimes referred to by Dominican elites. President Luis Abinader may daydream about a sweeping deportation of the entire Haitian population resident in the Dominican Republic, but the part of his political base with deep pockets will not let that happen.\n\nAbinader is cooperating with the UN to allow at least humanitarian relief supplies across the Rio Masacre, including a peacekeeping force from Kenya on the Haitian side. Despite sending in menacing looking armored vehicles to patrol the river’s right bank, the Dominican leader is probably not going to cause more blood to flow here. The major difficulty for the DR of coming to an accommodation with Haiti is the almost complete lack of a functioning government on the left bank where gangs reign supreme.[1]\n\nNone of this prevents local politicians from turning this dilemma into political capital. Accordingly EL JAYA, daily newspaper of record for the northern Dominican coastal city of San Francisco de Macorís, on 22 September 2023, a speech was given by a senatorial candidate from the north to his constituents not anywhere in the DR, but in New York City. The DR allows dual citizenship, and this means absentee voting by the Dominican diaspora. Salvador Holguín of Dajabón Province took the opportunity to draw attention to himself as one concerned about the folks back home by telling his ex-pat constituents in New York that they had better call their relatives in the border areas and tell them to beware of the marauding gangs of Haitians. Holguín called on his fellow citizens and other residents on the border, to beware of “the fearsome band of Haitians called G9, Jimmy Chérisier (‘Barbecue’), that he will support economically and with weapons the construction work of the canal on the Masacre River.”\n\nMeanwhile on the left bank, EL JAYA reports that the Haitian Organization of the People in Struggle (OPL) called on Port au Prince “to defend the rights of Haitians on Dominican soil, in the face of the conflict with the DR over the construction of the canal.”[2]\n\nHeaven only knows what that can mean. Does peace have a chance? Perhaps at the border, but within Haiti and for Haitians resident in the Dominican Republic peace is an open question, just as it is for Dominicans living on the other two thirds of the Island of Hispaniola, once the capital region of New Spain.\n\nAll because of water.\n\n--Guy Christopher Carter ©September 29, 2023\n\n[1] https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article279552779.html | https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/un-expert-calls-quick-end-haiti-dominican-republic-border-shutdown-2023-09-18/ | https://gadebate.un.org/en/78/dominican-republic | https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/14/dominican-republic-to-shut-border-with-haiti-from-friday-president-says | https://www.counterpunch.org/2023/09/21/what-is-behind-the-canal-conflict-between-the-dominican-republic-and-haiti/ | https://haitiantimes.com/2023/09/19/haitians-protest-dominican-presidents-visit-to-columbia-amid-canal-conflict-photos/ | https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2023/0918/Dominican-Republic-closes-Haitian-border-as-water-dispute-escalates"
