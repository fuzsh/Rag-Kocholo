Unless granted Germany will impose retaliatory duty on Dominican tobacco, whose principal market is Hamburg.

In addition, $7,500,000 of 4 per cents were to be issued and the $4,250,000 outstanding of 1893, 1894, and 1895 issues exchanged into them. These new bonds were to be known as “French reclamation bonds,” although the French claims were paid out of their proceeds only partly or not at all. The bonds remaining after refunding former issues were to go to the Improvement Company for $1,000,000, to be furnished the Government for the discharge of its floating indebtedness and $150,000 for the [Page 590] payment of the French diplomatic claims. This $1,500,000 was not finished as agreed, and the Improvement Company afterwards returned the Government $1,750,000 of the 4 per cents. The Improvement Company authorized to dispose of $2,500,000 additional 4 per cents as its compensation for building 18 miles of railroad from Santiago to Moca and improving the existing line from Puerto Plata to Santiago. This arrangement was never carried into effect.\n\nAugust 16.—Railroad from Puerto Plata to Santiago formally opened. In the fall of 1898 the Improvement Company makes unsuccessful efforts to float the 4 per cent conversion bonds and the railroad bonds. Foreign and domestic creditors press Heureaux hard.\n\n1898.\n\nJanuary 13.—Eighteen hundred and sixty-seven treaty (commerce, friendship, and extradition) with the United States abrogated by notice from the Dominican Government. Other treaties with the great commercial nations also abrogated to get rid of “favored nation” clause.\n\nFebruary 17.—U. S. S. Brooklyn, Commodore Crowninshield and Captain Cook, and Montgomery, Captain Converse, visit Santo Domingo.\n\nApril.—Spanish gunboat at Samana.\n\nMay 24.—Employees of French Cable Company at Santo Domingo suppress American consul’s message in regard to shipment of Canet guns on French steamers to Spaniards in Cuba or Porto Rico.\n\nJune 2.—Revolutionary expedition in Fanitta, which had been fitted out in New York and was led by Jimenez and Augustin Morales (brother of ex-President) lands at Monte Christi. Takes town, but is quickly defeated by government forces; Morales killed and Jimenez escapes. Heureaux attempts to confiscate Jimenez’s harbor and other concessions at Monte Christi, but a German bank claims that they had previously been transferred to it.\n\nJuly.—American consulate raised to consulate-general.\n\nJuly 7.—Heureaux makes and Dominican Congress ratifies secret treaty with Haiti, by which Santo Domingo virtually cedes disputed territory for $1,000,000, of which $600,000 was to go to Haitian claimants against Santo Domingo and $400,000 was to be paid in cash. The official accounts of Santo Domingo show that only $200,000 of this sum was received; disposition of the balance unknown; possibly was never paid; possibly was secretly divided between Haitian officials and Heureaux. About this time Heureaux drew draft on Haitian Government in settlement of claim, which, being insufficient in amount, was returned by claimants’ representative. Heureaux did not appoint the commissioner to the Holy See provided for in the arbitration clauses, and, though joint commissioners to survey the boundary line were appointed, they disagreed at the outset and abandoned their work. The only provision of the treaty carried into effect was the payment by Haiti.\n\nAugust 15.—German minister arrives and blocks the confiscation of Jimenez’s concessions.\n\nSeptember 10.—American Weather Bureau station established in Santo Domingo after permission had been asked and obtained of Dominican Government.\n\nOctober 17.—Heureaux in negotiations with Spanish Government for purchase of two small gunboats.\n\nDecember 5.—Columbus monument within Santo Domingo cathedral dedicated.\n\nEarly in 1898 Heureaux, being unable to extract any more temporary loans from local merchants, determined to make an issue of paper money. The French bank, now under the control of the Improvement Company, which had the exclusive right of issue, refused for several months, but finally yielded after its manager was convinced that a further refusal would imperil his life. An issue of $1,600,000 in addition to the already outstanding notes of the bank, redeemable in silver, was made, the Government assuming responsibility for its redemption, although it was nominally by the bank. These new notes were legal tender of 2 to 1 as compared with American gold, but a panic immediately ensued; merchants protested against receiving them and farmers refusing to market their produce. The opposition was especially determined in the cacao and tobacco regions of the Cibao. Heureaux visited the different towns in person, threatening and coercing recusants and making especial arrangements with large merchants. But in spite of his efforts the market value of the notes rapidly depreciated.\n\n[Page 591]\n\nIn 1898 foreigners were installed as agents at every custom-house; smuggling and corrupt understandings between employees and importers were consequently diminished, but on the other hand Dominican prejudice against the Improvement Company increased and Heureaux, as the backer of the Improvement Company lost ground with the office-holding classes as well as with the farmers and retailers. The revenue at the disposal of the Improvement Company materially increased before the currency emission, and the bond interest payments were met in April and October.\n\n1899.\n\nThe paper money drops to 10 to 1 with a further downward tendency. Revenue receipts demoralized. Heureaux determines to return to a metallic basis and promises to effect redemption by July 1.\n\nApril—Semiannual bond interest defaulted. Heureaux endeavers to secure European protectorate.\n\nMay.—Heureaux visits Mole St. Nicolas and confers with Haitian President about boundary question and mutual protection against revolutionary movements.

Fatal shot fired by Ramon Caceres, member of a land-owning family known to be opposed to Heureaux’s financial policies and relations with foreign capitalists. Caceres and his relatives believed that Heureaux had come to Moca with the purpose of putting them out of the way. Vice-President Figuereo succeeds to the Presidency.\n\nAugust.—Revolutionary movement in Monte Christi Province by friends of Jimenez; they send for the latter. About the same time Caceres and Horacio Vasquez, his cousin, start a revolutionary movement at Moca, which quickly spreads to Santiago.\n\nAugust 25.—Minister of war is defeated at Monte Christi; his troops desert him. Provisional Government installed at Santiago; whole Cibao gives its adhesion. Vasquez marches on capital.\n\nAugust 30.—Figuereo resigns.\n\nSeptember 6.—Provisional Government installed at capital; Horacio Vasquez, President; Brache, Ferrera, Moya, Caceres, and Cuzman, ministers.\n\nOctober 20.—Election held; followers of Vasquez and of Jimenez in accord; old Heureaux party takes no part.\n\nNovember 15.—Jimenez inaugurated Constitutional President and Vasquez Vice-President; Carvajal, Alvaro, Leonte Vasquez, A.

Amount owed Improvement agreed upon by compromise at $4,500,000, to be paid in installments of $225,000 annually, but deadlock ensues because Improvement refuses to give up Puerto Plata-Santiago Railroad. Fifty thousand dollars paid to Sala American who had been partner of Heureaux and furnished goods for government.\n\nOctober 11.—Monte Christi Province pronounces against Vasquez under leadership of Navarro and Demetrio Rodriguez.\n\nOctober 21.—Government forces take town of Monte Christi; Navarro and Rodriguez surrender under conditions, but small local “jefes” keep up a guerrilla warfare continuously through the fall and following spring.\n\nThe Vasquez administration started in with a vigorous effort to settle the debt, foreign and domestic, and to reform the financial administration; Tejera reduced salaries and expenses and practiced rigid economy; Vasquez and Sanchez were inclined to propose lease of Samana Bay to American Government for cash rent, but nothing definite was done. Until the insurrection broke out in Monte Christi in October Tejera’s financial plans appeared to be likely to bring some order out of the confusion inherited from the Jimenez administration, but the expenses of fighting and the failure to agree with the Improvement Company weakened the financial and international standing of the administration.\n\n[Page 593]\n\n1903.\n\nJanuary 31.—Protocol signed by which Dominican Government agreed to submit to arbitration the question of the delivery of the railroad and the amount of interest and yearly installments on the $4,500,000.\n\nFebruary 23.—First provisional installment paid in accordance with the Improvement protocol.\n\nMarch 6.—Government, on demand of American minister, withdraws decree reducing port charges; American representations based on protest of Clyde Steamship Company, whose concession contains a clause exempting it from payment of port charges and forbidding reduction to other ships or lines.\n\nMarch 6.—American chargé obtains agreement to pay Ros, harbor concessionaire at Marcoris, $40,000 as remuneration for dues lost by refusal of shippers to pay. Tejera resigns as minister of finance rather than sign this agreement\n\nMarch 14.—Sugar tax of one-tenth cent per pound.\n\nMarch 23.—Political prisoners at capital escape under leadership of Pedro Pepin and take fort and government buildings. Vasquez was at this time in Santiago, and hastens at once toward the capital with forces gathered in the Cibao. Insurgents solicit Figuereo to form proposed provisional government; he refuses; Wos y Gil accepts,\n\nApril 1.—Insurgents defeated with great loss at Pajarito.\n\nApril 6.—Pedro Pepin killed in sortie. Desperate fighting under walls of capital.\n\nApril 18.—Assaulting party under Cordero and Alverez penetrate city but is annihilated. Vasquez gives up and flees to the Cibao and thence to exile.

Guayabin comes from eastern Monte Christi and joins them. Practically whole Cibao comes under control of insurgents.\n\nOctober 30.—German and Spanish consuls succeed in getting falling Wos y Gil administration to sign protocol recognizing and giving specific security to claim of German-Spanish commercial firm. The debt was contracted in Heureaux’s time and was claimed to be due by him personally.\n\nNovember.—Morales remains at Puerto Plata while Horacista forces march on capital. Insurrectionary movements in Azua and Barahona.\n\nNovember 4.—Wos y Gil besieged in capital. American (Baltimore and Newport), French, German, Dutch, and Italian war ships arrive. Horacista forces led by Eliseo and Raul Cabrera, Epifanio, Rodriguez, and Carlos Ginebra. Later are joined by Guelito Pichardo, Demetrio Rodriguez, Sanchez, and chiefs from Azua. Wos y Gil sends expedition by sea to neighborhood of Puerto Plata; it deserts him; he is without money.\n\n[Page 594]\n\nNovember 24.—Wos y Gil gives up and capital occupied by insurgents. Morales forms provisional government at Puerto Plata; Reynoso, Alfau, Enrique Jimenez (nephew of Juan I.), Pou, E. Cabrera, Victoria, and Ginebra, ministers. Vasquez and Caceres decline to be candidates for President; Horacistas refuse to accept Jimenez as candidate. All the chiefs of the successful revolution agree to hold an election in January and to submit to the result. Morales makes agreement with Raul Cabrera and Caceres that in return for Horacista support he will give them control of the cabinet and most of the provincial governorships. Intrigues for advantages between the Horacistas and Jimenistas.\n\nDecember 5.—Morales arrives at capital. Guelito Pichardo and Manuel Machado succeed Reynoso and Alfua in cabinet.\n\nDecember 10.—Jimenez and his partisans determine not to allow Morales to become President; they control the governorships in nearly all the Provinces, because the officials nominated by Wos y Gil had been selected from among anti-Horacistas. Anti-Morales pronunciamentos in Santiago, La Vega, Puerto Plata, San Francisco de Macoris, and Monte Christi. Horacistas under Caceres, Guayabin, and Cespedes gather for resistance. Jimenez goes to Monte Christi and makes it his headquarters on account of facilities there for getting munitions. Confused fighting near Santiago, La Vega, Moca, San Francisco, Samana, and Sosua. Both sides short of ammunition. Jimenistas dependent on supplies received by the Clyde Line and Horacistas on those from Morales at Santo Domingo.\n\nDecember 13.—Plot to take capital itself from Morales; fails and Jimenista governor takes asylum.\n\nDecember 17.—Morales goes to Macoris and issues decree exempting sugar from taxation for twenty years on cash payment of $15,000 by planters.\n\nDecember 18.—Morales leaves Macoris for north coast, carrying 500,000 rounds of ammunition.

Small bands stray out in the woods near La Vega and Barahona.\n\nMarch 30.—Morales goes to Cibao to make arrangements for decisive campaign against Monte Christi.\n\nApril 30.—Export duties increased; cacao $1.50 and sugar 10 cents per quintal; sugar planters refuse to pay.\n\nThroughout April and well into May hard fighting with varying results in Monte Christi; Epifanao, Rodriguez, and Cespedes generals on Government side; Arias and Demetrio Rodriguez of insurgents. Azua and Barahona are not completely pacified and Perico La Sala stays out near La Vega. Rest of country quiets down, exhausted.\n\nApril 25.—Elections called for May 30.\n\nMay 1.—Protocols signed with Italian minister recognizing preferential contracts of Bancarlari and Vicini, and fixing November 1 as date of beginning payments on them and on the previous Italian protocol of July 4, 1903.

With Admiral Sigsbee makes tour of all ports of the Republic.\n\nJuly 14.—Arbitral tribunal in Improvement Company case gives award. Requires Dominican Government to pay $450,000 for two years and $500,000 thereafter. Consternation among the members of Government, who think that it is impossible to meet such an amount, since, taken with all other annual obligations contracted since 1900, the total is more than revenues. Equal consternation among representatives of foreign creditors, who think they will receive nothing if so much is diverted to the Improvement Company. Government repudiates outstanding treasury orders heretofore accepted from local merchants as payment of customs. Great opposition to such action among merchants, especially in the north. Government finances in hopeless confusion; no money in treasury and no credit.\n\nAugust 19.—On behalf of his own and the German Government, Spanish chargé protests against execution of the award.\n\n[Page 596]\n\nOctober 17.—Possession of Puerto Plata custom-house delivered to John T. Abbott, vice-president of Improvement Company, and appointed by President as financial agent ad hoc. This was on demand of American minister after strenuous diplomatic resistance by the Dominican Government. Latter reserves right to attack hereafter the reasonableness of the award, and begs the Improvement Company to allow it, at least temporarily, to use a portion of the revenue from that port in paying salaries in the northern provinces. Improvement at first allows such help at the rate of $20,000 a month—Puerto Plata revenues run from $50,000 to $100,000 a month—but withdraws it in a week. This action increases already bitter feeling existing toward Judge Abbott and his company, especially on the part of the Government and the political and commercial community at Puerto Plata and Santiago. Merchants who had made short-time loans on the security of the current customs are deprived of means to collect; employees are dismissed and salaries cut down, while the authorities at Santo Domingo are compelled to draw from the already depleted revenues of Santo Domingo and Marcoris funds to meet budget expenses in the Cibao. Improvement Company offers to guarantee the Government $30,000 monthly if the latter will request Judge Abbott to take charge of all four northern ports. Horacistas threaten revolution against Morales if he consents.\n\nNovember 12.—Italian chargé protests against award on the ground that it interferes with the government’s ability to begin payments in November on Italian protocols. French chargé insists that the payment of $310,000 a year to French and Belgian bondholders be immediately resumed.\n\nNovember 27.—President Morales begs that American Government take charge of custom collections at all ports as soon as his Horacista ministers become convinced that loan can not be obtained to meet improvement installments of $37,500 monthly and to facilitate arrangement with other foreign creditors.\n\nNovember 30.—German war ship Bremen makes visit to capital. Her commander sees Dominical officials and European charges, but not the American minister.\n\nDecember.—Minister of finance returns from Santiago and Puerto Plata, having met with no encouragement in regard to proposed provisional loan; finds it impossible to obtain from creditors concessions necessary to enable Government to continue in existence.\n\nDecember 15.—Belgian chargé arrives from Habana to insist on renewal of payments to French and Belgian bondholders interrupted since early in 1902. He and French chargé intimate to American minister that system similar to that in force at Puerto Plata under award should be applied to the southern ports upon whose revenue receipts those payments are first chargeable. French fleet proceeds from Martinique to Port au Prince, and its intention of soon visiting Santo Domingo is announced.\n\nDecember 30.—Negotiations looking to collection of customs by American Government at all ports begun.\n\n1905.\n\nJanuary.—Spanish chargé endeavors to block Morales’s negotiations with American Government by assuring Tejera that German banks stand ready to furnish money for refunding loan. Tejera declines to bring suggestion before his associates of the Horacista party, which controls the executive council and Congress.\n\nJanuary 21.—Draft of proposed customs-collecting and debt-arranging convention signed; is immediately published by Morales in order to reassure public, which believes that annexation had been extended; insurrectionary plots cease; terms when known are exceptionally well received throughout the country except at Monte Christi. Admiral Sigsbee proceeds there. General amnesty declared.\n\nJanuary 29.—Local banker at Santo Domingo agrees to advance $75,000 a month to Government on security of turning over to him of the revenues of all ports except Puerto Plata; these advances to be temporary and pending the negotiation and ratification of a convention.\n\nFebruary 4.—In view of Governor Arias’s hostile attitude the Government requests the United States to take charge of Monte Christi custom-house under provision of improvement award.\n\nFebruary 7.—Convention signed and sent to Washington.\n\n[Page 597]\n\nFebruary 10.—Admiral Sigsbee obtains Arias’s consent and Lieutenant-Commander Leiper, U. S. Navy, is peaceably installed in charge of Monte Christi custom-house as collector under the award.\n\nMarch 14.—Italian war ship Calabria arrives; her commander has instructions to insist on fulfillment of Italian protocols; on being informed of the provisions of the pending convention and of the financial position of the Dominican Government he becomes convinced that an acceptance of its terms by all parties offers the best security for an ultimate discharge by the Dominican Government of its obligations.\n\nMarch 20.—Calabria leaves for Kingston.\n\nMarch 20.—News of Senate’s adjournment without ratifying the convention received at Santo Domingo. Immediate activity in revolutionary plottings throughout the Republic. Government doubles guards and arrests prominent Jimenistas.\n\nMarch 23.—Belgian chargé formally demands immediate resumption of payments to French and Belgian creditors. Threatens to withdraw at once to Habana. Italian chargé, at request of Italian creditors, sends for Calabria.\n\nMarch 24.—Minister of finance proposes that American minister take charge of all customs collections as agent for Dominican Government, paying 45 per cent thereof to Government for its budgetary expenses and holding 55 per cent for the creditors. American minister declines. Minister of finance then proposes that the President of the United States suggest an experienced customs man and a bank of deposit. Finding upon inquiry that such arrangement met the approval of all foreign creditors represented at Santo Domingo, American minister communicates the proposition to Washington.\n\nMarch 28.—Calabria returns and remains about two weeks.\n\nMarch 29.—President of United States consents to suggest American for customs receiver and an American bank to act as depositary.\n\nMarch 31.—Dominican Government issues decree putting into effect proposed financial modus vivendi.\n\nApril 4.—George R. Colton’s name is suggested by President Roosevelt and he is immediately appointed general customs receiver by Dominican Government.\n\nApril 10.—Dr. J. H. Hollander arrives as special agent to investigate details of Dominican financial situation.\n\nApril 25.—Colton enters upon the discharge of his duties; leaves Dominicans in custom-houses; puts Americans in central office, in traveling auditor’s department, and on Haitian frontier. Organizes customs guard to prevent contraband over Haitian frontier, and puts into effect rigid and exact accounting system. The customs revenues immediately began to rise, and by the end of a year were almost double what they had been under exclusively Dominican administration. The proportion received by the Dominican Government gives the latter a larger and more regularly paid cash income than any administration had ever had at its disposal. Salaries paid promptly and armed forces begin to be put on better footing.\n\nMay 11.—Admiral Bradford replaces Sigsbee in Dominican waters.\n\nJune 1.—Lamarche made minister of interior and Leonte Vasquez of public works.\n\nJune 9.—Law providing for rural guard on Cuban system passed.\n\nJune 21.—American gold made legal standard.\n\nJune 24.—Epifanio Rodriguez resigns as minister of war to take governorship of La Vega in place of Guayabin, who is disgruntled with Morales because the latter has not protected him from criticism in Congress on account of alleged arbitrary acts. Perez takes war portfolio.\n\nJuly 1.—Candelario de la Rosa heads small insurrectionary movement in Barahona Province; suppressed in few weeks.\n\nAugust 7.—Montolio, formerly Morales’s private secretary, succeeds Pelegrin Castillo as minister of justice.\n\nSeptember.—Under modus vivendi administration running with smoothness unprecedented in Dominican history; power now being worth having and permanency of Government assured; rival ambitions in ruling combination begin to clash. Sanchez, Perez, B. Pichardo, and Montolio line up with Morales, giving him five of the eight votes in the executive council. The straight-out Horacista ministers, Velasquez, Lamarche, and Leonte Vasquez, fear they will be dismissed, but know they can count on the support of Caceres and Horacio Vasquez, a majority of Congress and the much-feared Horacista generals from the Cibao, as well as the dominant element in the capital.\n\n[Page 598]\n\nOctober 20.—Caceres, having become convinced that Morales is intriguing to expel Horacistas from participation in the administration and to replace them with Jimenistas or independents, suddenly visits the capital and demands the dismissal of Perez and B. Pichardo. Morales yields with bad grace. Perez sent as governor to Puerto Plata.
