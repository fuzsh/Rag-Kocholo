        "text": "Mujer Rayana\n\nSolidarity and Womanism in the Dominican-Haitian Border\n\nAmanda Alcántara\n\nThe border between the Dominican Republic and Haiti is often described as a region with many contradictions, namely a history of ongoing violence, coupled with the cultural porosity of the area. Harvard Professor Lorgia García Peña describes those of the area as having “Rayano consciousness” (border-citizen consciousness) in her book The Borders of Dominicanidad: Race, Nations and Archives of Contradictions, pointing out several examples, including Sonia Marmolejos, a rayana woman who received a lot of international attention after she nursed babies to health with her breast milk following their rescue during the 2010 earthquake that devastated Haiti.\n\nThis consciousness exists amid a history of anti-Haitianism in the Dominican Republic, one that caught international attention in 2015 when the government enacted a campaign attempting to grant documents to workers of Haitian descent, followed by threats of deportation for those who did not obtain them by the set deadline. It was close to one year after this campaign when I traveled to Dajabón, a Dominican province in the northern side of the border, asking: What about the women of this region?\n\nSo much of the historiography of the border and news reports surrounding the area and the issues around Haitian immigration in Dominican Republic lack a feminist perspective that centers on women.\n\nIn 2016, I began to study the history of women in Dajabón and how the region’s contradictions manifest in the lives of working-class Dominican women, Haitian women, and those with mixed national identity. For the project, twenty-seven women who were either of Dominican descent, of Haitian descent, or both, were interviewed.\n\nWhat I found was that women in Dajabón contributed tremendously to the regions’ entrepreneurship and economic development, driving them, for example, to form women-centered organizations which seek to educate women, raise awareness in the community, and protect worker’s rights.\n\nThe fact that women are centered in this work gives space for womanist thought. Alice Walker describes womanist as, “A woman who loves another woman, sexually and/or non-sexually. She appreciates and prefers women's culture, women's emotional flexibility...[she] is committed to the survival and wholeness of an entire people, male and female. Not a separatist, except periodically for health…loves the spirit…loves struggle. Loves herself” (Walker). Womanism is often used to specifically discuss feminism that centers on black women (Rodriguez).\n\nYet, even as what as a womanist thought exists in the region, the very conditions that create the need for such women-centered groups and organizations, in addition to entrepreneurial unprotected work, affects such efforts for solidarity.\n\nRace in the Dominican Republic and Its Effects in Dajabón\n\nDuring the recent global debates surrounding anti-Haitianism in the Dominican Republic and the nation’s history with anti-blackness, one fact is traditionally ignored: anti-blackness is not inherent to Dominican culture or society. Rather, it is a result of a nation economically controlled by elites, a nation with a history of international pressure to divest from black nationalism. As Kimberly Eison Simmons reminds us, “[…] Dominicans have been denied their blackness by the state.” Often when people discuss the roots of anti-blackness in Dominican Republic, they begin with the dictatorship of Rafael Leónidas Trujillo and the 1937 massacre of Haitian immigrants. Yet, as several historians and academics have pointed out, including García Peña, the history of anti-Haitianism in the Dominican Republic precedes the Trujillo Era and is largely influenced by US foreign intervention and policy. In 1906, for example, when contraband and exchange along the Dominican-Haitian border was the norm, the US intervened to stop it (Moreta). The current rhetoric not only ignores this, but also fails to acknowledge how the black Dominican population also faces economic struggles.\n\nFurthermore, the form of racism that exists in the Dominican Republic today must be understood in relation to the nation’s history of oppression and the resistance to it, in addition to the nation’s role in post-slavery struggles within the larger Latin American, Caribbean, and North American context. In his Introduction to Dominican Blackness, Silvio Torres-Saillant writes about Dominicans’ evolving perceptions of blackness and the historic movements to reclaim blackness in opposition to the state’s anti-Haitian campaign. He notes that much Dominican historiography leaves out grassroots anti-racist struggles in favor of promoting the oppressive (and ultimately colonial) perspectives of the elite.\n\nThe intellectual elites [. . .] monopolized the conceptualization of Dominicanness as the ideological descendants of the Spaniards and white creoles who directed the colonial system in Santo Domingo. When they imagine Dominican history and the Dominican people only the experience of their ancestors comes to mind, the experience of all others, meaning the majority of the population, receiving only tangential, if any, treatment. Thus, the actions, the suffering, and the dreams of black Dominicans are largely ignored by José Gabriel García (1834–1910), the reputed founder of Dominican historiography. The December 1522 slave rebellion, for instance, matters to him only as an illustration of the ills that befell the administration of Governor Diego Colón. (Torres-Saillant 38)\n\nFor women living in the Dominican Republic, as a disenfranchised and marginalized group inhabiting the intersections of blackness and womanhood (Crenshaw 1244), such anti-blackness is even more marked. Perceptions of blackness in the Dominican Republic affect women in a very specific way—from perceptions of beauty that lead to chemically altering one’s hair1 to the over-sexualization of women’s bodies.\n\nIn her book Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza, Gloria Anzaldúa describes how, for Chicanas who grew up in border towns, material and symbolic borders function as open wounds. Black women’s bodies are places of exploitation, embodying the border as a harshly contested site between vying systems of power. For Haitian women—as a disenfranchised group—the border often passes from being symbolic into becoming a concrete and violent threat that offers no protection from the state against gender violence.2\n\nMy research shows that while there are clear points of similarity in experiences, national identity also plays a role in the relationships between Haitian women, Dominican women, and Dominican women of Haitian descent, thus becoming a barrier to building solidarity.\n\nNonetheless, there are many organizations and groups in Dajabón seeking to empower women on both sides of the border regardless of the racial and ethnic background of the women involved. These organizations provide a framework to approach womanist thought. Oftentimes, though, the work of such organizations is met with many challenges such as a lack of sustainability in the long term given that many of the organizations rely on grants, some of which are international.\n\nThere are Centros de Madres in every municipio of the province that provide workshops for women and families. There are also different initiatives that seek to teach women entrepreneurial skills like a group of women doing artisanal work with recycled materials which are later sold, the growth of peanuts through shared crops in the community of El Pino (these peanuts are harvested by women, and sold generating income), the Centro Pon/Puente which provides workshops, Solidaridad Fronteriza which deals with violations of human rights, and la Red Janok Siksé which promotes the defense of human rights, among other entities.\n\nOf the women that I interviewed, particularly women of Dominican descent, most of them shared that they had not been discriminated against and some tied discrimination to low-self-esteem. One woman, forty-seven years of age, shared that she had experienced discrimination based on her dark skin color, but she also added “If you catalog yourself as discriminated, then you will be. It’s something personal. When your self-esteem is as low as the ground, anything they tell you will make you upset.”3 Because the state does not provide a definition of racism that is widely understood, there is no basis by which to understand racism as a systemic ill as opposed to a personal one. Cultural anthropologist Yadira Perez Hazel argues that different types of racism are recognized by different censor markers: “In the Dominican Republic, the human sense of touch, smell, hear, taste and sigh are called upon to mediate, evaluate, legitimate, and negotiate day-to-day encounters and occurrences.”\n\nSimilarly, a twenty-six-year-old Haitian woman who travels to Dajabón everyday shared that she has never felt discriminated against by Dominicans and she repeated the words of the other woman who I interviewed almost verbatim, “A person who feels discriminated because of his or her skin color is a person with low self-esteem, and I wasn’t born that way.” When asked specifically if she has ever been discriminated against, she said that she hadn’t ever experienced discrimination against her by a Dominican person, yet later on she shared a story of being discriminated against by the military agents who did not want to allow her to enter the country despite the fact she worked at the organization Centro Puente. She shared that one time a guard also tried to touch her inappropriately.\n\nThe role of the US also affects perceptions of race today on an interpersonal level especially as international actors are ever-present either via nongovernmental organizations, non-profits, or religious missionary work. Several of the women whom I interviewed, especially those with visibly dark skin, expressed that they felt pride in their skin color because “a los gringos les gusta” (“American white men like it”).\n\nWhen speaking about their natural hair, one Dominican woman said, “I’m of the kind that lives like this, without any shame…the majority of foreigners like it natural.” Another woman of mixed ethnic descent (that is half-Dominican, half-Haitian) said, “I feel proud of my color, I find that Americans are very attached to us. To this color. From any of those countries, they find someone with my skin color and they’re very proud of that color.”\n\nThe lack of framework by which to understand racial discrimination against black women reflects in the thoughts expressed by some women doing solidarity work. Perez Hazel writes about the boundaries of blackness: “I argue that the Dominican state is invested not only in controlling the boundaries of blackness and Dominican identity but in maintaining this existing ambiguity and state of precarity as a means of manipulating power.” Blackness is simply perceived as a color, not a race; it is everyone and it is no one.\n\nCentro Pon/Puente, a binational organization that works in Dajabón and Ouanaminthe, hosts different workshops for and by women, including classes on self-esteem, hygiene, cooking (Dominican cooking for Haitian housemaids), human rights classes, and more. The women who attend these meetings are mostly living in poverty, therefore finding new forms of sustenance is empowering. I was able to interview two of the women working in this organization, one of Dominican descent, whom we shall call Carmen, and another of Haitian descent, whom we shall call Jean.4\n\nCarmen shared with me her story of significant hardship. She was given away as a child to another family where she had to work hard to fend for herself. She married very young and says that finding Padre Regino (a Jesuit priest who started Solidaridad Fronteriza) changed her life. She shared that she was able to finish school and get into social work with the organization that she is in now. She shared with me that the first workshops led by Centro Pon/Puente were binational, and even remarked that sometimes Dominican women had to travel to Haiti and even share a bed with Haitian women when attending events together. When asked about the relationship along the border between Dominican and Haitian women, she said, “It’s mandatory. You either have a relationship with them [Haitian women] or you’re screwed.” When asked what she thinks of Haitian women, she answered, “They tolerate a lot. Here they kill more [women], but over there they beat them more.” She added, “We have to tolerate all business matters, ‘you may not speak my language, but I need you.’” She shared several times that she believes Haitian women tolerate too much and mentioned again that there is machismo in the Dominican Republic, but in Haiti it is worse.\n\nJean lives in Ouanaminthe, but she travels to Dajabón to work with Centro Pon/Puente. Her work involves recruiting women in Haiti to participate in the different workshops. Jean shared that there’s racism in the Dominican Republic, and she added “but in Haiti, too.” When asked if she has ever been mistreated because of her own skin color, she said that she had not. Jean travels every day from Ouanaminthe to Dajabón and the trip takes her about an hour. She shared, however, that one time she was in the market, and because of the packed conditions there and the large traffic of people, she witnessed how a pregnant Haitian woman was sexually assaulted by a Dominican man.\n\nNeoliberalism and Market Competition\n\nOver the past century, the Dominican Republic has seen an economic shift which has greatly affected the entire community and has encouraged entrepreneurship but has negatively affected black women. An article titled “Small Entrepreneurs and Shifting Identities: The Case of Tourism in Puerto Plata” (Northern Dominican Republic) focuses on the way small entrepreneurs in this area have had to shift their labor strategy and their identities in order to cope with the ongoing changes that began in the 1980s.\n\nOn the one hand, it has been noted that tourism is often approached as a means for progress for developing countries. On the other hand, the effectiveness of this industry to provide a steady income for local entrepreneurs and residents is limited. Therefore, these entrepreneurs and residents are increasingly unsatisfied about their (lack of) possibilities to participate in the ‘processes of modernization” (Roessingh and Duijnhoven).\n\nThe Heritage Foundation states: “In 2015, a streamlined bankruptcy law was adopted. A liberalized investment regime has facilitated growth around free trade zones and contributed to economic expansion of about 5 percent annually over the past five years.” Given that this economic shift prioritizes free markets, black Dominican women have inevitably suffered.\n\nMost, if not all, of the women I interviewed expressed incredible pride in their work, while at the same time referencing its hardships from lack of worker and workplace protection to a lack of recognition given that the region’s market brings hundreds of shoppers from around the island. This pride in their labor as a marker of worth is tied to the view of racism as a choice in that it seeks autonomy within the confines created by the current systems. The labor conditions under a neo-liberal system that prioritizes free markets promotes this belief of self-worth attached to work. “The ideological appropriation of a myth of a racial democracy and myth of a male breadwinner, and the imposition of neo-liberal Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) on the Dominican Republic in the early 1980s…the intersection of both these myths creates a foundation of internalized racism and machismo, among Afro-Dominican working-class women, which serves as nourishment for the evolution of neo-liberal Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs)” (Rodriguez). SAPs—international loans—often require the implementation of free market programs vs. building local sustainable economic models.\n\nDuring my first day in Dajabón, I met a woman who does solidarity work with Haitian women migrants and Dominican pepeceras. Pepeceras are women who sell “pepes” or used clothing. Maricela Elena, the President of the Asociación de Mujeres la Nueva Esperanza Dajabón, known more commonly as ASUMONEDA, shared with me that the selling of pepes began in the eighties and nineties when Dominican Dajabóneras would cross to Haiti to purchase clothing that had been donated by international communities. ASOMUNEDA was formalized on April 25, 1993 in order to fight for the rights of the women engaging in this work; the first lucha pursued was to legalize the selling of pepes. Women would travel to Haiti then return to the Dominican Republic to sell the clothing items, often in larger towns in the Central and Eastern parts of the island from Puerto Plata to Santo Domingo. Maricela Elena shared with me that because this market was initially illegal, the women would often have the clothing taken from them (often by border patrol agents who would then sell it themselves). “During that time, we were abused, and many times they even sent us to jail.”\n\nShe also said that they often faced sexual violence while purchasing clothes in Haiti. Eventually, however, the women united to form ASOMUNEDA and won the fight to make the work legal. Maricela Elena said that “ASUMONEDA came about to protect women, we accomplished that today pepes are no longer contraband.”\n\nI argue that a womanist thought indeed is emerging in the consciousness of many of the women living in the border region. Some of the quotes from women I interviewed reflecting this include:\n\n“Us Haitian women have courage. We work a lot. There’s an economic violence against us that forces us into these conditions.”\n\n“We do not let ourselves be left as cowards, we always find a way of stimulating our self- esteem.”\n\n“Dominican women are so strong in this life, that if her husband leaves and she has no food left to eat, she finds garbage, and turns on a fire to cook and feed her children.”\n\n“Us women are so strong, because despite the programs that we have, we still push forward.”\n\n“Us women are better with money and as administrators. We are not wasteful nor bad spenders. If a man earns two thousand pesos and gave one thousand to the household, he feels that he doesn’t owe anymore.”\n\n“We are smarter; we think before we act. Men need to be taught too as well.”\n\nDespite such examples of womanist thought, neoliberalism and anti-Blackness in the Dominican Republic—functioning together—effectively disarm black women by disavowing their shared blackness as a heritage that could serve to connect them. Instead, a myth of racial equality exists that does not view race as a unifier. When asked what they think of the word “Negra,” Dominican women responded:\n\n“I think when someone says negra, they mean color but aside from that, I see no other distinction because as a woman I have the same thing that another woman may have. Because we are all Dominican, but we’re not Dominican, we’re a mixed race, we don’t know what we are.\"\n\n“People think the word negra is an insult. Negra isn’t an insult.”\n\n“I use the word negra for affection.”\n\nASUMONEDA has about 300 members across the border of the Dominican Republic and Haiti, and it functions as an organization in the Dominican Republic, (it is not binational). When asked how the organization has changed over the last several years, one member complained that the market has been taken over by Haitian women. “They took the business from us” she said. “It is impossible to compete with them because their prices are too low.” In Ouanaminthe, one of the women who I interviewed there shared that she actually hated travelling to Dajabón because of the bad treatment that she received, but also precisely because of these cheap prices. She noted that she has to “sell more” in Dajabón. Another Haitian woman who I interviewed in Ouanaminthe shared that she too dislikes going to the market, specifically employing the word “economic abuse” to describe how the precarious living conditions in Haiti force her and other women to travel. “When a Haitian woman can’t eat or meet her necessities, many times she goes to bed without eating…that’s economic abuse, Haitian women suffer from that.” She also shared that in the space where the market is held, Dominican women get to have the spots that are inside and sectioned off, while Haitian vendors have to sit outside on the floor. When the market closes and it is time for them to leave, she also confirmed that the workers are treated badly by CESFRONT.\n\nMarket competition, accompanied by a national identity enforced by the state, then push Dominican and Haitian women in this region apart, despite similarities in struggle ranging from economic violence to domestic violence. Thus, Haitian women are then subjected to an added layer of state violence.\n\nViolence Against Women in Dajabón\n\nSystemic racism and sexism work hand-in-hand to prevent true solidarity work in the border, reflecting the need for an intersectional approach when considering the region. Hilda Peña, the director of an organization called la Red Janok Siksé, explained that there are situations of sexual violence in the border region against both Dominican and Haitian women. When trying to open a new Centro de Madres in one of the local towns, the men fought back until they were invited, they were very ambivalent at first and this caused many women to stop attending the meetings. Many men forced their wives to stop going. One woman shared: “Many times the woman does everything in the household, and yet the man comes home and asks, ‘You still haven’t cooked?’ That’s prejudice.” She also shared that many men believe women have to live below them, and they started getting upset when women began to learn at los Centros de Madres that they can exist side-by-side with their partners, not below them. “The moment you explain to him that you’re to live side-by-side, he befriends another female.”\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2016, Dajabón was the region with the largest index of feminicides in the Dominican Republic (OPD: Observatorio politico dominicano). Of all the women that I interviewed, twelve had been victims of domestic violence, some still actively living with their abusive partners. When I returned to Dajabón to present on this research, during the Q&A a man complained that it is the women’s fault that they do not stand up for themselves. “They like it,” he said.\n\nFurthermore, Haitian women are also subjected to violence by state officials or people with whom they work. Peña, who at the time was also the past director of Solidaridad Fronteriza, shared that when someone is undocumented the authorities do not want to take her case. Cases of human rights violations against Haitian women happen often in the border region, particularly as women try to enter the country to work in the binational market. Solidaridad Fronteriza, an organization that itself had to pick the name “Fronteriza” instead of “Solidaridad BiNacional” to ensure funding, takes on complaints against border patrol agents and seeks to bring them to justice.5 One particular complaint was of a Haitian woman, Marie (name changed), whom I interviewed. She shared that she was in the market when a CESFRONT (Specialized Border Security Corps) guard approached her and asked her for money. Marie runs a money pool, so she had the day’s money on her when she was stopped. When she refused to give it up, the CESFRONT guard slammed her against the wall and started taking her belongings. Her daughter who she pointed to, no older than eleven years, was there and she took out her cell phone to record. At that moment, the CESFRONT guard grabbed the girl by the neck and took her phone. “I jumped to fight him, so he let her go and in that moment, he grabbed me and threw me against the wall. I returned to grab her so that he would let her go and she was also fighting so that they would return the cell phone. In that moment they grabbed me and hit me…all I could say was that ‘this isn’t going to end like this.’” She was not able to recuperate all of the money taken from her, but they did return the money from her sales that day, and her merchandise. CESFRONT did not return the money pool money.\n\nOther cases show the limitations in place when seeking to bring justice to cases of sexual violence. One particular complaint shared with me was one where a Haitian woman defended herself from a sexual attack where the guard also stole money from her. Peña shared with me that having the border patrol steal from these women is not uncommon; “CESFRONT picks them and takes their merchandise…they take everything.” In the example of the woman who defended herself from sexual violence, they were able to seek some form of justice by having CESFRONT return the woman her money. The proof required the guard to show his genitals. She claimed that he had tried to force her into performing oral sex on him, and she bit him. When they made him take off his pants, the bite marks were there. Yet the sexual violence committed against her was not addressed or brought to justice, showing how violence against women (particularly sexual violence) continues to be seen as interpersonal and private, and therefore not something that the state can confront or address.\n\nFifty-five percent of violations against human rights in the border are against women, according to a report by Solidaridad Fronteriza. “Uno se siente impotente,” Peña said (“One feels helpless”).\n\nAccording to an extensive qualitative research report put together by Colectiva Mujer y Salud and Mujeres del Mundo (Collective Women and Health and Women of the World), Haitian women are subjugated to sexual violence, violations of labor rights, macuteo (the act of “shaking down” for money), and other forms of abuse. The research states: “Haitian migrant women, as well as those who have been displaced or who are in transit on the Dominican-Haitian border, find themselves at risk of suffering violence against women (VAW) in various contexts…There are high levels of routine violence against women in the region, which takes on various forms: physical, sexual, economic, and verbal/psychological violence, as well as high risks of illicit human smuggling and trafficking, including for purposes of forced sex work” (“Making Visible”).\n\nThe Solidarity Work Continues Despite Challenges\n\nBecause of the importance of financial independence and the women’s shared experience of living in poverty or being working class, much of the solidarity work in the region centers on selling products. Women come up with creative ideas to get ahead in light of the economic hardships that they face on a daily basis.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, women organized a fair where they sold artisanal products made from recycled material—a trade taught by a workshop given by a local Dominican woman. The fair was organized with the support of different local organizations. The women were up early in the morning getting everything ready; they had been planning for months and I was lucky enough to witness the final product. The goal of the fair was to showcase and sell their art. With recycled materials, mostly plastic bottles, the women make candlestick holders, figurines, pencil holders, and other items. With natural materials, like higüera, they made lamps. The group included about twelve women from different towns in Dajabón, some of them of Haitian descent. I interviewed one of the women who said that she was married to a Dominican man. She was abandoned as a child and raised by an uncle who abused her before coming to the community of Los Indios in Dajabón “en los tiempos de Balaguer” (during the Balaguer years). She shared: “I’ve been through a lot of hardships…now I’m learning to make artisanal products with this woman,” she said, pointing to the instructor.\n\nThe name of the group is “Domay artesanias/atizana,” a combination of the words Dominicana and Ayiti. The card that you receive when you purchase artisanal products from this group is in both Spanish and Haitian Creole. The card reads: “The Border Network of Women Artists is an organization of women from different communities in the northern border of Haiti and the Dominican Republic…thanks to the activities of the network, we’re improving our participation in our family’s decisions and in our communities.”\n\nWhile the women of the region continue pushing for solidarity work, regardless of the national barriers, the region is filled with contradictions. As some of the Dominican women say things like “you have to work with Haitian women”—at times resentfully—moments of solidarity also emerge, including expressing concern in moments where racial consciousness seems to defy the state’s teachings and an urge to learn Haitian Creole for many locals.\n\nOne of the last interviews I conducted was with a woman, Laura, from a community called Los Indios. Given the fact that this community is said to have been a home of Taínos, and the national identity of the Dominican Republic is often explicitly tied to a Latin Americanist indigenous romanticism, I admit that I expected Laura to center indigeneity in her beliefs. Yet, she surprised me when I asked her what she thinks of the word negra: “I say we all have dark skin, except some of us have lighter skin, and others darker.”\n\nAuthor’s note: This essay is adapted from my master’s thesis for the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, New York University, submitted May 2017.
