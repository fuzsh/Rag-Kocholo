General Information\n\nCapital Santo Domingo de Guzman Population 9,445.281 (2012) Geo. Coordinates 19 00 N, 70 40 W Area 48,442 Km². Currency Dominican peso Independence February 27, 1844 Government Democratic Republic Official Language Spanish Official Religion Roman Catholic National Bird \"Cigua Palmera\" National Flower Flor de la Caoba\n\n2. Geography\n\n3. Culture\n\nThe first permanent colony of Europeans in the Western Hemisphere was established in the Dominican Republic. Santo Domingo was founded in 1496 by the brother of Christopher Columbus; the first permanent city in the New World. The colonial center of Santo Domingo was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1990.The Colonial Zone, bordered by the Río Ozama, has an impressive collection of 16th-century buildings, including palatial houses and majestic churches that reflect the architectural style of the late medieval period.\n\nThe city's most important colonial buildings include the Catedral Primada de America, which is the first Catholic Cathedral in the New World; the Alcázar de Colón, once the residence of Don Diego Colón, the son of Christopher Columbus who became viceroy of the colony; the Monasterio de San Francisco, the ruins of the first monastery in the Americas; the Museo de las Casas Reales (Museum of the Royal Houses) a museum of colonial life and the former Palace of the Governor General and the Palace of Royal Audiences; the Museo del Hombre Dominicano (Museum of the Dominican Man), with exhibits on pre-Columbian life on the island; the Museo de Arte Moderna (Museum of Modern Art), with works by Dominican artists.\n\nPuerto Plata, on the North coast of the island, has the Museo de Ámbar, which displays unusual pieces of Dominican amber with plants, insects and small animals embedded inside them; the Parque Colón, a historic square; the Fortaleza Ozama, the oldest fortress in the New World; the Panteón Nacional, a former Jesuit now hosting the remains of various renown Dominicans; and the Iglesia del Convento Dominico, the first convent in the Americas.\n\nArt, music, and literature developed in part along Western patterns, with a strong African cultural component. The African heritage is especially notable in the country's folk culture, particularly the music. The best representation of the blend between the Spanish and African traditions is the popular national song and dance, the merengue. Merengue music can be heard everywhere on the island, and every summer Santo Domingo holds a two-week merengue festival at which the world's finest merengue bands and merengue dancers appear.\n\n4. History\n\nIn essence, Santo Domingo's history is the history of the Europeanization of the Americas.\n\nBefore the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492, the Taíno Indians populated the island of Hispaniola, including the part now occupied by the Dominican Republic. At that time, a chieftain or cacique ruled the island through a complex, centralized government, a fact completely lost on the Europeans, who dismissed the natives as \"savages.\" The Taíno civilization effectively ended on October 12, 1492, with the arrival of Christopher Columbus, who declared Hispaniola \"the most beautiful land that human eyes have ever seen.\"\n\nThroughout its first century, Santo Domingo was the launching pad for much of the exploration and conquest of the New World. The expeditions that led to Ponce de Leon's \"discovery\" of Puerto Rico, Hernan Cortes' conquest of Mexico and Balboa's sighting of the Pacific Ocean all started from Santo Domingo.\n\nIn 1586, the famous English pirate Francis Drake invaded and pillaged Hispaniola. This weakened Spanish dominion over the island, and for more than 50 years all but the capital was abandoned and left to the mercy of the pirates. In 1655, the French invaded the West portion of the Island. After several treaties and forced annexations, the portion of the island controlled by Santo Domingo was reduced to less than half. Later, in 1822, the Haitians, commanded by Toussaint Louverture, took over the entire island, and the island's Spanish-speaking residents had to fight for their lost independence. Finally, on February 27, 1844, the Spanish part of the island regained its independence after 22 years of Haitian rule thanks to a group of patriots headed by Juan Pablo Duarte, Francisco del Rosario Sánchez and Ramón Matías Mella, being the Puerta del Conde the main scenario of this relevant event.\n\nAfter the independence was achieved, and the Dominican Republic created, various political factions struggled for control of Santo Domingo and skirmishes continued along the newly-created border with Haiti. In 1861, Santo Domingo annexed itself to Spain. This lasted for four years and culminated with the “Restoration” of Independence. After that, Santo Domingo was governed by several autocrats, most notably by dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo (who took power after the 1916-1924 occupation by the United States), which lasted from 1930 to 1961 and ended with the execution of the dictator. The early 60s were again a period of unrest, marked by a coup, revolts and second invasion by the United States.\n\nPresident´s have been elected by a democratic voting process since 1966.\n\n5. Government\n\nwww.presidencia.gob.do\n\nCountry Name:\n\nConventional long form: Dominican Republic\n\nConventional short form: DR\n\nLocal long form: República Dominicana\n\nType of Government: Representative Democracy\n\nAdministrative Divisions:\n\nCapital City of Santo Domingo (National District) and 31 provinces : Azua, Baoruco, Barahona, Dajabón, Duarte, El Seibo, Elías Pina, Espaillat, Hato Mayor, Hermanas Mirabal, Independencia, La Altagracia, La Romana, La Vega, Maria Trinidad Sánchez, Monseñor Nouel, Monte Cristi, Monte Plata, Pedernales, Peravia, Puerto Plata, Samaná, San Cristóbal, San José de Ocoa, San Juan, San Pedro de Macorís, Sánchez Ramírez, Santiago, Santiago Rodríguez, Santo Domingo, Valverde.\n\nIndependence:\n\n27 February 1844 (Independence from Haiti)\n\n16 August 1865 (Restoration of Independence from Spain)\n\nConstitution:\n\n26 January 2010\n\nLegal System:\n\nBased on French civil codes; Criminal Procedures Code modified in 2004 to include important elements of an accusatory system; accepts compulsory ICJ jurisdiction.\n\nSuffrage:\n\nUniversal suffrage after 18 years of age; married people regardless of age. Note: members of the armed forces and national police cannot vote.\n\nExecutive Branch:\n\nLegislative Branch:\n\nThe bicameral National Congress (Congreso Nacional) consists of two houses, the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. .The Senate is composed of 32 senators who represent the Dominican provinces and the National District, while the Chamber of Deputies has 190 members apportioned among the provinces by their population; seven (7) of these deputies represent Dominicans living abroad.\n\nThe Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have equal power in the legislative process. However, while the Senate is empowered to legislate on treaties and presidential appointments, the revenue-raising bills must originate in the Chamber of Deputies which also has the power of impeachment.\n\nThe meeting of the two chambers is called Asamblea Nacional.\n\nThe most recent legislative election was held in 2010. The next one is scheduled for 2016, with subsequent elections to be held every four years.\n\nJudicial Branch\n\nThe highest court in the Dominican Republic is the Constitutional Court (Tribunal Constitucional). It was created by the Constitution drafted in 2010 to ensure the supremacy of the Constitution, the defense of the constitutional order, and the protection of fundamental rights. It is composed by 13 judges appointed by the National Magistrate Council to serve a nine-year term.\n\nThe Supreme Court (Suprema Corte) is in charge of administrating justice, including guaranteeing the rights, social peace and the development of democracy within a legal framework characterized by equality, honesty, transparency, independence and excellence.\n\nIt is comprised of 17 magistrates, chosen by the National Magistrate Council, who are subject to an evaluation every 7 years.\n\nPolitical Parties:\n\nThe main political parties in the Dominican Republic are the Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC), the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD) and the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD). A further 23 participated in the 2012 elections, achieving voting totals ranging from 0.11% to 5.87%. Political parties are publicly funded.\n\n6. Economy\n\nThe Dominican Republic is a Caribbean representative democracy that enjoyed strong GDP growth until 2003. Although the country has long been viewed primarily as an exporter of sugar, coffee, and tobacco, in recent years the service sector has overtaken agriculture as the economy's largest employer due to growth in tourism and free trade zones. Growth turned negative in 2003 with reduced tourism, a major bank fraud, and limited growth in the US economy (the source of about 80% of export revenues), but recovered in 2004 and 2005.\n\nWith the help of strict fiscal targets agreed in the 2004 renegotiation of an IMF standby loan, President Fernandez has stabilized the country's financial situation. Although the economy continues to grow at a respectable rate, unemployment remains an important challenge. The country suffers from marked income inequality; the poorest half of the population receives less than one-fifth of GNP, while the richest 10% enjoys nearly 40% of national income. The Dominican Republic's development prospects improved with the ratification of the Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) in September 2005.\n\n7. Baseball\n\n8. Golf\n\nThe Dominican Republic is one of the premier golf destinations in the Caribbean. Thanks to the tropical climate play is possible all year-round.\n\nThe majority of the golf courses are found along the coast in the country's burgeoning resorts, each with its own distinct identity, carefully designed with the coastline and hills incorporated. Over 25 designer courses, set amidst breathtaking coastlines with mountain backdrops and lush green fairways, await in our tropical paradise and more promising courses are soon to be opened.\n\nwww.casadecampo.com\n\nwww.golfguide-do.com\n\n9. Flag\n\nThe Dominican Flag is divided into four sections by a white cross. The upper left section is dark blue; the lower left is red. On the right side of the cross the colors are reversed. The coat of arms appears in the center of the cross, and reads \"God, Fatherland, and Liberty\".\n\n10. Fauna\n\nDue to its isolation over millions of years large mammals are not endemic on Hispaniola. Among the few mammals native of the island are bats, the bottlenose dolphin, Antillean Manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus) and two small land animals in danger of extinction, the Solenodon and the Hutia.\n\nAntillean Manatee Rhinoceros Iguana\n\nCow, pigs, donkeys and horses were all imported by the Spaniards. The European also brought mice, rats and cats on their ships. Mongooses, originally imported from India to combat the rats, have become a pest. Eighteen species of bats have been found in the country. Bird life is very rich on Hispaniola and 254 species (22 endemic) are known, about half of which live in the aquatic environment. Two indigenous birds that are now difficult to find are the Hispaniolan parrot and the perico.\n\nAmong the most famous local reptiles (1411 species with 83% of them endemic) are the American crocodile, the rhinoceros iguana and the ricard iguana. All three are endangered species but can often be seen in Isla Cabritos National Park. All snakes on the island are nonpoisonous. Frogs, mainly tree frogs, are abundant and can be quite noisy, living on palm and banana trees as well as telephone posts. Lizards are seen everywhere and 21 different species are known. The lizards all have in common a thin, often colorful skin along their throats, which is blown up like a balloon when they are threatened.\n\n11. Flora\n\nThe tropical climate of Hispaniola and the variations in elevations, rainfall and soil have produced a variety of plant habitats, ranging from dry areas to coniferous forests in the mountains. About 36% of the 5,600 plant species on the Island of Hispaniola are endemic.\n\nThe lush vegetation is found in the humid forests of the eastern mountain region. Local mahogany is abundant and was used in the construction of the first cathedral in 1540. Other native trees are the ceiba (silk cotton tree) known for its enormous size and long life (up to 300 years), Dominican magnolia, the bija and mammon tree. There are tree ferns and numerous bromeliad, orchids in the country's forests, such as Sierra de Bahoruco National Park. Higher mountain zones are dominated by the creolcan pine tree, while the desert and semiarid areas dominated by cacti agaves terrain. For more information go to www.agricultura.gov.do\n\n12. Natural Resources\n\ncountry abounds in gold, silver, amber, larimar, ferronickel, bauxite, coal, tin, marble, salt, gypsum, and stone.\n\n13. Climate\n\nMaritime tropical averaging 78 degrees Fahrenheit and ranging from 73 degrees in winter to 82 degrees in summer, the hottest month is August, the coolest is January. Trade winds keep the air cool and fresh; temperatures can drop up to 30 degrees in the mountains. Rains are more likely in May/June and August to October. Average monthly temperatures in the Dominican Republic (in degrees Fahrenheit) are as follows:\n\nTempertures in 2006\n\nJan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Min 68 66 67 69 71 72 72 73 72 72 70 69 Max 84 85 84 85 86 87 88 88 88 87 86 85\n\n14. Major cities\n\nThe capital is Santo Domingo de Guzman, the oldest and largest city in the Caribbean with a land area of 144 square miles and a population of over 2.2 million (1990); Santiago de los Caballeros is second with 690,548; San Cristóbal 409,381; La Vega 335,140; Duarte 272,277; San Pedro de Macorís 212,886; Puerto Plata over 255,061; La Romana 158,132; La Altagracia (Higüey) 112,396; Samaná 49,537.\n\n15. Museums\n\nThe Dominican Republic’s national museums celebrate all aspects of the Dominican life, many treasured from the past and many that impact the present. The museums are located throughout the whole island. In Santo Domingo one can find the museums of Dominican Man, Natural History and Geography, Dominican Family, Royal Houses (colonial), as well as the Pre-Hispanic Art Museum, the Viceroy Museum and Alcazar, the Museum of Antique Coins, the Gallery of Modern Art, and the Larimar Museum. Walking the streets of Santiago you could see the Tomás Morel Folklore Museum and the Cultural Center Eduardo León Jiménez. Puerto Plata hosts the Amber Museum and in Altos de Chavón you can visit the Archaeological Museum.\n\nFor more information about the country and it´s attractions, please visit:\n\nhttp://www.godominicanrepublic.com/\n\nColumbus Lighthouse\n\nMuseum of the Dominican Man Gallery of Modern Art National Library Museum of Natural History\n\n16. Language and Religion\n\nSpanish is the official language of the Dominican Republic. English is widely spoken especially in tourist areas. Traffic signs and most menus in restaurants are in Spanish. A French dialect is heard along the Haitian frontier. Roman Catholicism is the dominant religion. There is a small Protestant community and a small percentage of the people follow African animist religious beliefs\n\n17. Education\n\nThe Dominican Republic provides free compulsory education to children between the ages of 5 and 13. Some 85 percent of the population aged 15 or older is literate. In the 2000 school year 1.4 million pupils attended primary schools. While virtually all children attend primary school, only 59 percent of secondary school-aged children were enrolled.\n\nThe Autonomous University of Santo Domingo, the oldest university in the western hemisphere, was authorized in 1538, although classes did not begin until 1558. Four faculties were established, those of philosophy, medicine, theology, and jurisprudence, and the university attracted students from Mexico, Cuba, Venezuela, and elsewhere in Central America. The institution was originally called the Universidad de Santo Tomás de Aquino and was run by Dominican friars. It now occupies a modern campus known as University City.\n\nThe Catholic University Madre y Maestra was founded in Santiago in 1962. Other universities include Pedro Henríquez Ureña National University (1966) and Eugenio María de Hostos University (1981), both in Santo Domingo; Northeastern Catholic University (1978) in San Francisco de Macorís; and Central University of the East (1970) in San Pedro de Macorís. Art and music are taught in the national School of Fine Arts, and there is also a National Conservatory of Music.\n\n18. Holidays in the Dominican Republic"
