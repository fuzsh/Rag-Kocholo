He added that the presence of the military device only obeys preventive measures, by instructions of the Army commander, Major General Carlos Antonio Fernandez Onofre.\n\nHaitian vandals entered the Codevi industrial complex on Thursday, broke glass doors, loaded food, and smashed emergency vehicles of the company, which forced the executives to remain with their doors closed while members of the internal security of the complex and military guard the place.\n\nThe market is reopened.\n\nThe bi-national market was reopened yesterday, although the mayor of the municipality, Santiago Riverón, had announced its suspension after the riots in Codevi. “We made the decision to announce the suspension of the market because we feared that the Codevi situation would happen here, but then we received some calls and decided to continue, because the market is a humanitarian issue and also we were guaranteed security,” he said.\n\nThe president of the Association of Exporters of the Binational Market, Porfirio Fernandez, showed concern for the climate of insecurity and the losses due to the lack of reduction in trade.\n\nWhen the border gate opened, Haitian nationals stocked up on food products to take them back to their country. The market mobilizes millions of pesos and is the primary economic source of Dajabón and the other towns of the Northwest."
