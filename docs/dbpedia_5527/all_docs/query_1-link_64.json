        "text": "10.7 million people were analysed in 31 provinces. From September to November 2023, 1.2 million people (11 percent of the population analysed) were in IPC Phase 3 or above, 2.3 million people (22 percent) were in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) and 7.2 million people were in IPC Phase 1 (Minimal). Six provinces were in Crisis (IPC Phase 3) including Elías Piña, Independencia, Monseñor Nouel, Monte Cristi and Valverde.\n\nFrom December 2023 to April 2024, border area instability is expected to impact the food security situation - with six provinces in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above) including Dajabón. It is estimated that 1.1 million people will be in IPC Phase 3 or above, with 19,000 people in Emergency (IPC Phase 4). 21 provinces will remain in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed) and five provinces will remain in IPC Phase 1 (Minimal). In general, El Niño is expected to affect productivity in most provinces. Minimum wage is expected to increase and, monetary and food subsidies will be provided to prevent the deterioration of household purchasing power.\n\nFrom May to August 2024, the return of the rainy season and stabilization of the border situation is expected to improve productivity and improve employment and purchasing power. 1.0 million people - 9 percent of the population will be in Crisis or worse (IPC Phase 3 or above), and 2.2 million people - 21 percent of the population will be in IPC Phase 2 (Stressed).\n\n1. Urgent humanitarian food assistance actions are required for people who are in conditions of acute food insecurity crisis or emergency.\n\n2. In coordination with the different state institutions, identify at the level of provinces, municipalities, districts, urban areas and rural sections those areas that have a higher proportion of households that have exhausted their reserves and are employing Crisis or Emergency strategies in order to promote response objectives aimed at protecting livelihoods and reducing food consumption gaps in households in Phase 3 and 4.\n\n3. Maintain social protection programs focused on populations with vulnerable livelihoods, such as: informal trade, day labor with irregular wages, urban and rural communities with higher poverty rates, households with people with disabilities, among others, taking advantage of the information that will be available with the Population and Housing Census.\n\n4. Promote immediate social protection response plans for populations in Emergency (Phase 4) with special attention to households with children with acute malnutrition, to reduce food consumption gaps and save lives.\n\n5. Maintain fuel pricing, other food subsidies and continue with economic relief measures as a universal social protection measure that will protect households from inflation."
