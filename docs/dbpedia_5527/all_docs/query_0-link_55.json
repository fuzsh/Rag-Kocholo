        "text": "Description\n\nGEO1_DO identifies the household's province within the Dominican Republic in all sample years, except 2002. Provinces are the first level administrative units of the country. GEO1_DO is spatially harmonized to account for political boundary changes across census years. Some detail is lost in harmonization; see the comparability discussion. A GIS map (in shapefile format), corresponding to GEO1_DO can be downloaded from the GIS Boundary files page in the IPUMS International web site.\n\nThe full set of geography variables for the Dominican Republic can be found in the IPUMS International Geography variables list. For cross-national geographic analysis on the first and second major administrative level refer to GEOLEV1, and GEOLEV2. More information on IPUMS-International geography can be found here.\n\nComparability — General\n\nWhere boundaries changed over time, units were harmonized to create units with boundaries that remain stable over time.\n\nBoundary changes:\n\nAround 1960, Julia Molina changed its name to María Trinidad Sánchez province\n\nIn 1961 José Trujillo Valdez became Peravia; Libertador became Dajabón; Benefactor became San Juan; and Trujillo became San Cristóbal.\n\nIn 1965 San Rafael became La Estrelleta, but in 1972, La Estrelleta province became Elías Piña\n\nIn 1968, La Romana province formed from La Altagracia\n\nBetween 1960 and 1970, there were changes in boundaries between the provinces of Puerto Plata and Santiago\n\nIn 1972, Name of La Estrelleta province changed to Elías Piña\n\nIn 1982, Monseñor Nouel province formed from La Vega\n\nIn 1982, Monte Plata province formed from San Cristóbal\n\nAround 1984, Hato Mayor province formed from El Seibo\n\nIn 2000 San José de Ocoa province formed from Peravia\n\nIn 2001 Santo Domingo province formed from Distrito Nacional\n\nIn 2007 Salcedo became Hermanas Mirabal\n\nAfter 1980, there were changes in boundary between Baoruco, Barahona.\n\nThe 2002 sample of Dominican Republic is not included in GEO1_DO, it is only available as a year specific variable GEO1_DO2002. The 2002 microdata sample identifies municipalities and municipal districts, whereas all the other census years (2010, 1981, 1970, and 1960) identify municipalities. The boundaries of some municipalities are different from the other census years."
