Present: Senators Kerry, Menendez, Cardin, Shaheen, Udall, and Lugar. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN F. KERRY, U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS The Chairman. This hearing will come to order. Good morning. I appreciate everybody being here. This is the fifth in a series of hearings on Afghanistan and Pakistan, and today we will examine perhaps one of the most important aspects of the war, which is the enemy: Who are they? What do they think? What are the possibilities of either dividing them or working with some components of them? Many, many questions surrounding the various forces that are at large in the western part of Pakistan and in Afghanistan itself. We're a little bit under the gun today because we have the joint session with Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel. We will have to end this hearing punctually in order to get over to the Senate and begin that session. So I ask each of the witnesses if you would summarize your testimony. Your complete statements will be placed in the record as if read in full, and that'll give us more time to ask questions. In order to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaeda and prevent Afghanistan from becoming a terrorist sanctuary, we clearly need to understand exactly who we're fighting, what motivates them, what binds them together, and, most importantly, what could drive them apart. Today we'll attempt to gain a deeper understanding of insurgent and extremists groups that inhabit the region and better understand the nature of this conflict. Osama bin Laden may have been at the center of it all, but his death does not signal the end of terrorism. Al-Qaeda still exists, motivated by the same vitriol and warped ideology that has always been the organization's trademark. The Abbottabad raid, how- ever, did send an unmistakable message: The United States is committed, capable, and unrelenting in its pursuit of those who seek to do us harm. The extent of bin Laden's operational significance will become clear when we finish analyzing the material that was removed from his compound. But one aspect of his legacy is already apparent. Even after 9/11, he played a central role in motivating disparate groups to unite against the United States and other western nations. Nowhere is this phenomenon more apparent than in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where strong connections among extremists groups exist at both the organizational and individual levels. Terrorists and insurgents work together against coalition forces and to indiscriminately murder innocent civilians, aid workers, civil servants, and children. Their motivation, which should offend all faiths, is to destabilize the region and to establish a safe haven where they can, and plot attacks against the United States and our allies. People ask why we are still in Afghanistan. This is the reason. Al-Qaeda and the Taliban are names well known to Americans. But other groups are actively plotting, actively killing, every day. The Haqqani network has expanded its reach beyond North Waziristan in Pakistan and provides sanctuary to al-Qaeda and the Afghan Taliban. The Tehrik-i-Taliban, otherwise known as the Pakistani Taliban, and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi systematically work to undermine the Government of Pakistan. Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed continue to launch attacks that risk sparking war between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan. So I'd like to take 1 minute, if I can, to highlight the threat posed by Lashkar-e-Taiba. This group, responsible for the vicious Mumbai attacks of 2008, is capable of not only destabilizing the region with another attack against India, but through its extensive alumni organization and network of training camps throughout Pakistan it could threaten the United States homeland. We also face threats from individuals seeking to fulfill their own personal objectives. Najibullah Zazi, a legal United States resident born in Afghanistan, conspired to bomb New York City's subway system in 2009 after he received training in Pakistan. Faisal Shahzad, who attempted to detonate a car bomb last year in Time Square, was linked to the Pakistan Taliban. Unfortunately, these are just two examples of a new generation of would-be terrorists who have grown up in the shadow of extremist militancy. These lone wolves are as potentially dangerous as any one organization. Even though these groups and individuals have overlapping interests, fissures do exist among them. They're separated by ideologies, nationalities, and tribal or sectarian backgrounds. Our focus now ought to be less on who will succeed bin Laden and more on how to exploit those fissures and dismantle the networks that he spawned. So this is a critical moment in the war in Afghanistan. Our security gains in the south--and they are real--coupled with bin Laden's death, have, at least in my judgment and certainly in the judgment of the people I talked with in Afghanistan last weekend, have created some political space. So it's important that we seize that opportunity. Middle- and low-level Taliban fighters, many of them want to come in from the battlefield. We need to work with the Afghan Government in order to make sure that those who wish to lay down their arms can in fact do so, and as reconcilable elements of the insurgency enter into the peace process--and I think it's possible for some of them to do that--we need to ensure that Afghans are able to avert both Taliban rule and a return to civil war. That is a delicate balancing act. Of course, we can't forget the impact that Pakistan has on the future of Afghanistan. I've many times said that Pakistan is the key to diminishing the insurgency in Afghanistan itself. What happens in Pakistan may do more to determine the rate at which American troops can withdraw, the rate at which the Afghan troops can stand up, and the degree to which governance can be improved in Afghanistan. We also need to remember that terrorists and insurgents are continuing to exploit the 1,200-mile porous border that separates the two countries. And we will have to work very closely with Pakistan in order to deal with the problem of the sanctuaries as purveyors of violence in both nations. The good news here is that there is common ground between the vital national interests of Pakistan and the United States, even at the same time as there are some divergent interests. It will take adroit and persistent diplomacy to convince the Pakistani military leaders that the real threat to their sovereignty comes not from its eastern border and not from across the Atlantic, but from violent extremists in their own country. We obviously have a lot to discuss here today, and to help us do this we have Peter Bergen, currently the director of the National Security Studies Program at the New America Foundation and an expert on al-Qaeda and bin Laden; Dr. Paul Pillar, a 28- year veteran of the CIA and director of graduate studies and faculty member at Georgetown University; and Dr. Christine Fair, also a professor at Georgetown University's Center for Peace and Security Studies and an expert on extremist groups in South Asia. I thank each of you for coming in this morning. Senator Lugar. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD G. LUGAR, U.S. SENATOR FROM INDIANA Senator Lugar. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for calling this hearing. I note that it is the fifth in a series of hearings that we have had on Afghanistan and Pakistan. I join you in welcoming our distinguished witnesses. Like the chairman, I remain hopeful that we will soon hear from the Defense Department and the State Department in public session about their plans in the region going forward. At this hearing we are attempting to define the nature of the terrorist threats that confront us in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is important because we are devoting enormous resources to these two countries, with the primary goal of fighting terrorism. Both Afghanistan and Pakistan affect clear United States national security interests. In previous hearings, however, I have contended that the resources being spent in Afghanistan are far greater than the current threat warrants. The United States has almost 100,000 troops in Afghanistan, with another 32,000 deployed in the region to support the mission. According to the Congressional Research Service, there were an estimated 87,000 military contract personnel in Afghanistan at the beginning of this year. More than 1,000 civilian personnel are assigned to the United States Embassy. The United States effort in Afghanistan is costing approximately $120 billion a year. The question before us is whether Afghanistan is strategically important enough to justify the lives and massive resources that we are spending there, especially given that few terrorists in Afghanistan have global designs or reach. To the extent that our purpose is to confront the global terrorist threat, we should be refocusing resources on Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, parts of North Africa, and other locations. Our government should be working on an approach that allows us to achieve the most important national security goals in Afghanistan--especially preventing the Taliban from taking over the government and preventing Afghan territory from being used as a terrorist safe haven--at far less expense. The Pakistan side of the border has a fundamentally different dynamic. Despite the death of Osama bin Laden, al- Qaeda and other terrorist groups maintain a strong presence. There is no question that the threat of these groups, combined with worries about state collapse, a Pakistani war with India, the safety of the Pakistani nuclear arsenal, and Pakistan's intersection with other states in the region make it a strategically vital country worth the cost of engagement. The question is how the United States navigates the contradictions inherent in dealing with the Pakistani Government and Pakistani society to ensure that our resources and diplomacy advance our objectives efficiently. The importance of getting this right is reinforced by the utterances of Osama bin Laden, who called the terrorist acquisition of nuclear and chemical weapons ``a religious duty.'' This effort has not died with bin Laden. Al-Qaeda and its affiliates have so far been unsuccessful in obtaining nuclear material or a nuclear device, experts believe. But many of our top military and intelligence officials continue to regard the terrorist acquisition of a nuclear weapon as the biggest threat to the United States national security. Pakistan's military leaders have given repeated assurances that the country's rapidly expanding nuclear arsenal is well- secured. But we also know that the A.Q. Khan network was enabled by members of Pakistan's nuclear establishment. Further, if Pakistan succumbs to violent extremism or economic collapse, confidence in the security of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal and technology could erode rapidly. This underscores the importance to United States national security of a stable Pakistan and of continued engagement on terrorism and nuclear security issues. I look forward with you, Mr. Chairman, to the recommendations of our expert witnesses today. Thank you. The Chairman. Thanks, Senator Lugar. I appreciate it very much. We will start with Mr. Bergen, then Mr. Pillar, and Ms. Fair. Thank you. Mr. Bergen. STATEMENT OF PETER BERGEN, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL SECURITY STUDIES PROGRAM, NEW AMERICA FOUNDATION, WASHINGTON, DC Mr. Bergen. Thank you, Senator Kerry. Thank you, Senator Lugar. In my 5 minutes I wanted to focus on the issue of Taliban reconciliation. Senator Kerry talked about the political space that has opened up for the possibility of reconciliation. Obviously, the death of Osama bin Laden provides an enormous opportunity for the Taliban, one which I think if they don't take suggests that they are unlikely to take such an opportunity again. As you know, Osama bin Laden swore an oath of allegiance to Mullah Omar, a religious oath, calling him ``the commander of the faithful.'' Now, Mullah Omar is now in the position to say: That was a personal arrangement; I don't really need an oath of allegiance from al-Qaeda any more. And let's see if he takes this opportunity, because I see several problems with the idea of reconciliation and some opportunities. The problems, briefly, are: The moderate Taliban has already reconciled. You know their names: Mullah Zaeef, Mullah Muttawakil, the Foreign Minister. They've had 10 years to reconcile. The people who aren't reconciled are pretty hard core. Second, they've had 10 years to reject---- The Chairman. How many hard core do you think there are? Mr. Bergen. How many hard-core Taliban? The Chairman. When you say ``hard-core,'' what are you talking about? Mr. Bergen. Well, I mean people who generally believe in the idea that Mullah Omar is the leader of all Muslims, that al-Qaeda is a good thing. I mean, they've had 10 years to reject al-Qaeda. As you know, al-Qaeda's embedded with the Haqqani Network right now. We've also the problem the Taliban is not the Taliban; it's the Talibans. So any negotiation will be several groups. We've seen that peace deals with the Taliban on the other side of the border in Pakistan--a border, by the way, that they don't recognize--they've reneged on every peace agreement they've been involved in. They had a peace agreement in Waziristan in 2005 and in 2006 and in Swat in 2009. They took those peace agreements as opportunities to essentially regroup and take over more territory. We've run a controlled experiment on what life under the Taliban looks like very recently in Pakistan. In Swat they beheaded policemen, they burned down the girls' schools, and they imposed a reign of terror, and that's the Taliban that I think is the hard core, that hasn't really changed their spots. We also saw, with the arrest of Mullah Baradar last year in Pakistan, effectively arguably the No. 2 of the Taliban, that the Pakistanis have a veto over these negotiations. So any negotiation involves them. And that's not the end of the world, but it is a factor that we need to consider going forward. The Northern Alliance also has an effective veto. I mean, Dr. Abdullah, who is well known to both the chairman and the ranking member, isn't going to give up everything he's fought for if there are significant territorial concessions or concessions of principle to the Taliban. And of course, he is likely to be the next President of Afghanistan in 2014. So the Northern Alliance have a veto as well as the Pakistanis over these negotiations. Hitherto the negotiations that have gone on in Mecca and the Maldives have amounted to nothing. I mean, one Afghan official joked to me that the reason that people went to the Maldives for the negotiations was simply they wanted a vacation. But there was nothing really serious coming out of this. In the case of Mullah Mansour, the supposed No. 2 in the Taliban who turned out to be a Quetta shopkeeper posing as a leader of the Taliban, indicates that we know really very little of what's going on inside this movement. So lack of knowledge is not helpful when you're negotiating. Finally and most importantly in terms of the problems with negotiating with the Taliban, what do the Taliban really want? Have they described what the future of Afghanistan they want, a future that involves democracy, that involves elections, that involves women going to work, that involves girls being educated, that involves rights for ethnic minorities? I don't think so. These are all very, very big problems. Then let me now turn to opportunities, now that I've described the problems. The opportunities, of course, are any kinds of negotiations help gather information about the opposition. We can create splits in the movement. Hezb-e-Islami, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's group, may do a deal. They're the sort of lowest hanging fruit. And once you do a deal with one aspect of the insurgency, you create the possibility of further splits. Americans are tired of the war. As the chairman alluded to and as Senator Lugar alluded to, the Taliban have taken a lot of hits in southern Afghanistan. In any negotiation, the recognition of a mutually hurting stalemate is sort of a sine qua non. The founding of the High Peace Council, yes, it has problems, but it's brought into the tent a number of spoilers from the Northern Alliance so that they're involved in a potential deal is a good thing. Recent reports in the Washington Post and Der Spiegel that negotiations are proceeding in Germany, third party sponsors of negotiations might include Turkey and Qatar, these are good things. Finally, most importantly on the opportunities, three- quarters of Afghans favor a political solution, and this is very important. So the political context is there. That number goes up to 94 percent in Kandahar, so an overwhelming number of Afghans want negotiations. Finally on a personal note, I've been visiting Afghanistan since the civil war in 1993 and I spent a fair amount of time under the Taliban and have a pretty good sense of what life was actually like there. I think it's going to be quite hard for this group. I think there's a classic problem in intelligence circles called mirror imaging, which you're both familiar with, which is the idea that other people will behave like us. In fact, the hard core of the Taliban are religious fanatics. When Mullah Omar awarded himself the title of ``commander of the faithful,'' he's not just the commander of the Taliban; he's the commander of all Muslims. And the history of negotiations with religious fanatics, particularly ones with delusions of grandeur, is not encouraging. [The prepared statement of Mr. Bergen follows:] Prepared Statement of Peter Bergen Senator Kerry, Senator Lugar, and other members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. My testimony will attempt to answer nine questions: 1. Why should the United States continue to fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan almost a decade after 9/11 and now that Osama bin Laden is dead? 2. Is progress being made in Afghanistan, both generally and against the Taliban? 3. What effect might the killing of bin Laden have on near- and long-term U.S. global security interests, and on core al-Qaeda's goals and capabilities? 4. What is the relationship between the Taliban and al-Qaeda? 5. How might that relationship be changed by the death of bin Laden? 6. What are the impediments to ``reconciliation'' with the Taliban leadership? 7. Given those impediments, why try and negotiate with the Taliban and are there reasons to think those negotiations might eventually work? 8. Might the Haqqani or Hezb-e-Islami (Gulbuddin Hekmatyar) factions of the Taliban be willing to consider a settlement? 9. There is an agglomeration of extremist groups operating in the lawless region near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, including the Pakistani Taliban, al-Qaeda, and other affiliated and sectarian groups. How should policymakers prioritize which of these to work against? * * * * * * * 1. Why should the United States continue to fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan almost a decade after 9/11 and now that Osama bin Laden is dead? President Obama has publicly defined the task in Afghanistan rather narrowly, as preventing the return of al-Qaeda to the country; in short, a countersanctuary strategy.\\1\\ Part of the reason for this relatively narrow public description of the Afghan strategy is, of course, political: there aren't many Americans who would countenance the return of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. But there are other reasons the United States remains in Afghanistan even if they don't have the political heft that invoking the threat from al-Qaeda does. First, conceding the return of the Taliban to power in part or the whole of Afghanistan would be a foreign policy reversal for the United States. Second, when the United States overthrows a government it has a moral obligation not to exit without setting the conditions for a slightly more stable and prosperous country. Third, when the Taliban were in power in Afghanistan they played host not just to al-Qaeda, but also to many other Islamist terrorist and insurgent groups from around the globe. Fourth, some kind of regional settlement in South Asia that encompasses Afghanistan will likely lower the risks of war between the nuclear-armed states of Pakistan and India. Fifth, and this is hard for many foreign policy ``realists'' to grasp: the Taliban are the Taliban. When they were in power in Afghanistan, their regime was characterized by its large-scale massacres of the Shia,\\2\\ its incarceration of half the population in their homes, and a country that became the world capital of jihadist terrorism. Evidence for what the Taliban are likely to do should they return to power in Afghanistan in some shape or form is provided by a controlled experiment on this question that has gone on over the past several years in Pakistan. In the onetime Pakistani tourist destination of Swat between 2008 and 2009 the Taliban imposed a reign of terror, beheading policemen whose bodies were left to rot in public, burning down girls' schools, and administering public lashings to women for supposed infractions such as adultery.\\3\\ It was a formula that they had already followed for several years in the tribal areas of Pakistan, the home base of the Pakistani branch of the Taliban. And the Taliban haven't changed their spots in Afghanistan either. According to a United Nation report released in March, of the some 2,800 civilian casualties of the war in 2010, three-quarters were caused by the Taliban.\\4\\ The massacre at the Kabul Bank branch in the eastern city of Jalalabad earlier this year was emblematic of this trend. Footage of the February 19 attack was captured by the bank's security cameras and shows a Taliban fighter ordering Afghan civilians to enter a room and then firing on them. At least 40 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the assault.\\5\\ And for those who think that the Taliban have lightened up on one of their signature policies-- preventing girls from being educated--consider that a concerted campaign of chemical weapon attacks has taken place against around a dozen girls schools across Afghanistan since the spring of 2009. Afghan girls have been poisoned with organophosphates, a nerve agent used in insecticides, in schools in Balkh and Kunduz in the north, and in Kabul, Ghazni, Kapisa, and Parwan in central Afghanistan. Those attacks have sickened and hospitalized hundreds.\\6\\ The recent evidence from Pakistan and Afghanistan shows that the notion that should the Taliban come back to power in parts of Afghanistan that they will suddenly morph into some kind of Pashtun version of the Rotary Club is a delusion. Despite this, earlier this year, George W. Bush's Ambassador to India, Robert Blackwill, writing in Foreign Affairs, made the argument that a modus vivendi could and should be reached with the Taliban: ``Washington should accept that the Taliban will inevitably control most of the Pashtun south and east'' and therefore the United States should accept that the de facto partition of Afghanistan is ``the best alternative to strategic defeat.'' \\7\\ It's strange that a diplomat who had spent years in South Asia was advocating partition in a part of the world where it is well known that the 1947 partition of India and Pakistan caused 1 million civilian deaths.\\8\\ And not even the Taliban are calling for the partition of Afghanistan, which is an older nation than the United States. (The first Afghan state was founded in 1747). The Blackwill plan was the most extreme expression of a now-common sentiment amongst the American foreign policy establishment: Let's just get it over with in Afghanistan, which is predicated on the belief (hope, really) that the Taliban are jus' sum' plain' ol' country folks who may not have the best manners in Central Asia, but nonetheless are men we can and should do business with because they represent our best exit strategy from the Afghan morass. American liberals, who were vocal in their opposition to Taliban when they imposed a theocratic reign of terror on Afghanistan before 9/ 11, have been strikingly silent on the issue of what a return to power of the Taliban in some shape or form in Afghanistan would mean for the rights of women and ethnic minorities. For those who say that Afghanistan is a conservative Islamic country and that therefore the Taliban's social policies just aren't that unusual, it's helpful to note that when the Taliban were in power there were 1 million kids in school and almost none of them were girls, while today there are 7 million kids in school and 37 percent are females.\\9\\ 2. Is progress being made in Afghanistan, both generally and against the Taliban? In addition to the sevenfold increase in the number of kids in school, positive developments in Afghanistan over the past several years have included the following: GDP growth was a robust 22 percent between 2009 and 2010; \\10\\ access to some form of basic health care was available to around 9 percent of the population a decade ago and is now accessible to 85 percent; \\11\\ the phone system barely existed before the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan, now one in three Afghans has a cell phone; \\12\\ the Taliban had banned almost all forms of media other than their own ``Voice of Sharia'' radio network, while there are now ``scores of radio stations, dozens of TV stations and some 100 active press titles,'' according to the BBC; \\13\\ around 6 million Afghan refugees have returned home since the fall of the Taliban; and so crowded with cars and people has Kabul become that the city's epic pollution is now killing more Afghans than are dying in the war.\\14\\ Because of all the tangible ways that their lives are getting better 59 percent of Afghans say their country is going in the right direction.\\15\\ By comparison, that metric is exactly reversed in the United States. In a New York Times poll released in April, 70 percent of Americans said their country is going in the wrong direction.\\16\\ The positive feelings a majority of Afghans have about the way things are going help account for the surprisingly high marks that they continue to give the U.S. military after nearly a decade of occupation, which scored a 68-percent favorable rating among Afghans in a BBC/ABC poll released in December.\\17\\ (In Iraq at the height of the war in 2007 BBC/ABC found that only 22 percent of Iraqis voiced support for the U.S. military presence in their country.) \\18\\ Afghans' faith in their future can be explained by the fact that they know that, despite all the problems that they face today--the corruption of the central government and the police and the resurgence of the Taliban--their lives are far better now than during the brutal Soviet occupation of the 1980s, the devastating civil war of the early 1990s, and the theocratic rule of the Taliban that followed. This past fall U.S. military officials publicly asserted that many Taliban safe havens in Helmand and in Kandahar had been eliminated.\\19\\ This is not only the assessment of the Pentagon, but the judgment of the International Council on Security and Development (ICOS), a think tank that has done field work in southern Afghanistan for many years and has long been critical of Western policies there. ICOS issued a report in February observing, ``NATO and Afghan forces now control a greater number of districts in Helmand and Kandahar than before,'' including key Taliban strongholds such as Marjah in Helmand and Arghandab in Kandahar.\\20\\ General David Petraeus told the Senate Armed Services Committee in March that in one recent 3-month period 360 insurgent leaders were killed or captured.\\21\\ According to a wide range of observers, as a result the average age of Taliban commanders has dropped from 35 to 25 in the past year.\\22\\ Some U.S. military officials believe this is a good thing, as the younger commanders are ``less ideological,'' while Thomas Ruttig, one of the world's leading authorities on the Taliban, says that the reverse is the case: the younger Taliban are more rigid ideologically.\\23\\ The sharply stepped up military campaign against the Taliban has caused some hand-wringing that Petraeus isn't following counterinsurgency precepts, which have been grossly caricatured as winning ``hearts and minds'' (see ``Three Cups of Tea''), as if counterinsurgency is some kind of advertising campaign to win loyalties. In reality, counterinsurgency is a set of commonsense precepts about how to avoid the kind of ham-handed tactics and repressive measures that will turn the bulk of the population against you, while simultaneously also applying well-calibrated doses of violence to defeat insurgents. Another common critique of the stepped-up campaign against Taliban commanders is that the United States should not be killing those commanders at the same time it is saying that we should talk with them. This critique bears little relation to the history of the last two decades of Afghan warfare, in which all sides have constantly fought and talked with each other simultaneously. Indeed, the Karzai government has had substantive contacts with elements of the Taliban since as early as 2003, according to a former Afghan national security official familiar with those discussions. An additional approach putting pressure on the Taliban are what the U.S. military terms Village Stability Operations, in which small teams of American Special Forces live permanently ``among the population'' in remote areas of provinces such as Uruzgan and Zabul where the insurgents once had unfettered freedom of movement. There the U.S. Special Forces are helping to train local community militiamen known as Afghan Local Police (ALP). The Government of Afghanistan has technically authorized 10,000 of them, but American officers believe that the numbers will rise to something more like 24,000.\\24\\ One says, ``ALP is the development that the Taliban most fear, we see it in the intelligence.'' When Petraeus first arrived as the commander in Afghanistan last summer setting up the ALP was his first big fight with Karzai, who was concerned quite reasonably that arming tribal militias might replicate some of the warlordism that has plagued Afghanistan since the early 1990s. Karzai agreed to the program in July, and there are a number of measures in place that make it avoid some of the obvious pitfalls of setting up even more armed Afghan groups.\\25\\ The program is not administered by the U.S. military but the Afghan Ministry of Interior, which keeps tabs on it through district police chiefs who are responsible for issuing guns to the community policemen. Candidates for the local police are selected by the local village shura (council), while everyone admitted to the program has to submit to biometric scans. 3. What effect will the killing of Osama bin Laden have on near- and long-term U.S. global security interests, and on core al-Qaeda's goals and capabilities? After the fall of the Taliban, bin Laden didn't, of course, continue to exert day-to-day control over al-Qaeda, but statements from him have always been the most reliable guide to the future actions of jihadist movements around the world, and this remained the case even while he was on the run. In the past decade bin Laden issued more than 30 video- and audiotapes.\\26\\ Those messages reached untold millions worldwide via television, the Internet, and newspapers. The tapes not only instructed al-Qaeda's followers to continue to kill Westerners and Jews; some also carried specific instructions that militant cells then acted on. In 2003, bin Laden called for attacks against members of the coalition in Iraq; subsequently terrorists bombed commuters on their way to work in Madrid and London. Bin Laden also called for attacks on the Pakistani state in 2007, which is one of the reasons that Pakistan had more than 50 suicide attacks that year. \\27\\ In March 2008 bin Laden denounced the publication of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in a Danish newspaper, which he said would soon be avenged. Three months later, an al-Qaeda suicide attacker bombed the Danish Embassy in Islamabad, killing six. Materials recovered from the Abbottabad compound in northern Pakistan where bin Laden was killed paint a picture of a leader deeply involved in tactical, operational, and strategic planning for al-Qaeda, and in communication with other leaders of the group and even the organization's affiliates overseas.\\28\\ Bin Laden exercised near-total control over al-Qaeda, whose members had to swear a religious oath personally to bin Laden, so ensuring blind loyalty to him. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the operational commander of the 9/11 attacks, outlined the dictatorial powers that bin Laden exercised over his organization: ``If the Shura council at al-Qaeda, the highest authority in the organization, had a majority of 98 percent on a resolution and it is opposed by bin Laden, he has the right to cancel the resolution.'' \\29\\ Bin Laden's son Omar recalls that the men who worked for al-Qaeda had a habit of requesting permission before they spoke with their leader, saying, ``Dear prince: May I speak?'' \\30\\ The death of bin Laden eliminates the founder of al-Qaeda, which has only enjoyed one leader since its founding in 1988, and it also eliminates the one man who provided broad, unquestioned strategic goals to the wider jihadist movement. Around the world, those who joined al- Qaeda in the past two decades have sworn baya, a religious oath of allegiance to bin Laden, rather than to the organization itself, in the same way that Nazi party members swore an oath of fealty to Hitler, rather than to Nazism. That baya must now be transferred to whoever the new leader of al-Qaeda is going to be. Of course, even as the al-Qaeda organization withers there are pretenders to bin Laden's throne. The first is the dour Egyptian surgeon, Ayman al-Zawahiri, who is the deputy leader of al-Qaeda, and therefore technically bin Laden's successor. But Zawahiri is not regarded as a natural leader. and even among his fellow Egyptian militants Zawahiri is seen as a divisive force and so he is unlikely to be able to step into the role of the paramount leader of al-Qaeda and of the global jihadist movement that was occupied by bin Laden.\\31\\ There is scant evidence that Zawahiri has the charisma of bin Laden, nor that he commands the respect bordering on love that was accorded to bin Laden by members of al-Qaeda. Another possible leader of al-Qaeda is Saif al-Adel, also an Egyptian, who has played a role as a military commander of the terrorist group, and since 9/11 has spent many years living in Iran under some form of house arrest. Adel has been appointed the ``caretaker'' leader of the terrorist organization, according to Noman Benotman, a former leader of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, a militant organization that was once aligned with al-Qaeda, but in recent years has renounced al-Qaeda's ideology.\\32\\ Benotman, who has known the leaders of al-Qaeda for more than two decades and has long been a reliable source of information about the inner workings of the terrorist group, says that based on his personal communications with militants and discussions on jihadist forums, Adel has emerged as the interim leader of al-Qaeda as it reels from the death of its founder and eventually transitions, presumably, to the uncharismatic Zawahiri. A wild card is that one of bin Laden's dozen or so sons--endowed with an iconic family name--could eventually rise to take over the terrorist group. Already Saad bin Laden, one of the oldest sons, has played a middle management role in al-Qaeda.\\33\\ One of the key issues that any future leader of al-Qaeda has to reckon with now is dealing with the fallout from the large quantities of sensitive information that were recovered by U.S. forces at the compound in Abbottabad where bin Laden was killed. That information is likely to prove damaging to al-Qaeda operations. Jihadist terrorism will not, of course, disappear because of the death of bin Laden. Indeed, the Pakistan Taliban have already mounted attacks in Pakistan that they said were revenge for bin Laden's death,\\34\\ but it is hard to imagine two more final endings to the ``War on Terror'' than the popular revolts against the authoritarian regimes in the Middle East and the death of bin Laden. No one in the streets of Cairo or Benghazi carried placards of bin Laden's face, and very few demanded the imposition of Taliban-like rule, al-Qaeda's preferred end state for the countries in the region. If the Arab Spring was a large nail in the coffin of al-Qaeda's ideology, the death of bin Laden was an equally large nail in the coffin of al-Qaeda the organization. 4. What is the relationship between the Taliban and al-Qaeda? There is plenty of evidence for the continuing cozy relationship between al-Qaeda and important factions of the Taliban: For much of the past decade al-Qaeda has been harbored largely by the Haqqani network, the ferocious Taliban militia based in Pakistan's tribal regions. According to a July 2009 WikiLeaks cable from the U.S. consulate in Peshawar, which abuts the Pakistani tribal regions, Jalaluddin Haqqani, the veteran jihadi commander who has been the longtime head of the Haqqani network, is ``considered to have a close relationship'' with Mullah Omar. Haqqani's relationship with bin Laden stretches back to the mid-1980s, according to the Palestinian journalist Jamal Ismail who worked with bin Laden doing this time period. Another Palestinian journalist, Abdel Bari Atwan, who spent days interviewing bin Laden in 1996, points out that bin Laden did Mullah Omar a big favor when he introduced the Taliban leader to his old buddy Jalaluddin Haqqani, who later rose to become arguably the Taliban's most feared military commander.\\35\\ Cooperation between the Taliban and al-Qaeda can be seen in the suicide bombing that killed seven CIA officers and contractors in the American base at Khost in eastern Afghanistan on December 30, 2009. The suicide bomber, Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi, was a Jordanian doctor recruited by al-Qaeda.\\36\\ Two months after Balawi's suicide attack al-Qaeda's video production arm released an interview with him videotaped some time before he died in which he laid out how he planned to attack the group of Agency officials using a bomb made from C-4.\\37\\ In another prerecorded video, the chief of the Pakistani Taliban, Hakimullah Mehsud, appeared alongside Balawi saying the attack was revenge for U.S. drone strikes directed at the Taliban.\\38\\ The Taliban began to reemerge as a serious threat in Afghanistan in 2006, launching a serious campaign of suicide bombers and IED attacks. Sami Yousafzai, a leading reporter on the Taliban, has documented that they were taught these techniques by Arab jihadists. That same year Taliban commander Mullah Dadullah explained his links to al-Qaeda. ``Osama bin Laden, thank God, is alive and in good health,'' he told CBS. ``We are in contact with his top aides and sharing plans and operations with each other.'' \\39\\ Three years later, Mustafa Abu Al- Yazid, one of al-Qaeda's founders, described his group's rapport with the Taliban during an interview, ``We are on a good and strong relationship with them,'' he said, ``and we frequently meet them.'' U.S. officials such as CIA director Leon Panetta have publicly said that there are only a few dozen members of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.\\40\\ In addition, U.S. officials point to other ``foreign fighters'' operating in Afghanistan in particular in the east and to some degree in the north of the county; for instance, Uzbeks affiliated with the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, which is deemed a terrorist group by the U.S. Government.\\41\\ A briefing slide prepared by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), which leaked out in January 2010, showed a map of insurgent groups operating in Afghanistan in which the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan was shown to have a presence in five provinces in northern and southern Afghanistan. The leaked DIA briefing asserts that al-Qaeda ``provides facilitation, training, and some funding'' to the Taliban in Afghanistan, while the Taliban also maintain a ``mutually supportive relationship'' with Chechen and Central Asian fighters.\\42\\ On April 26 NATO officials announced that the Saudi al-Qaeda leader, Abu Hafs al-Najdi, had been killed in an airstrike in Kunar province in northeastern Afghanistan. The NATO announcement noted that Najdi was one of 25 al-Qaeda leaders and fighters who had been killed in the past month.\\43\\ This suggests that there are still a small but not insignificant number of al-Qaeda militants as well as other foreign fighters who continue to operate in Afghanistan. A nuanced account of the Taliban-al-Qaeda relationship is provided by Anne Stenersen, a research fellow at the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment. In a paper for the New America Foundation last year she pointed out that al-Qaeda functions mostly in the east of Afghanistan because of its longstanding ties to the Taliban Haqqani Network that is prevalent in this region, while al-Qaeda and the Quetta Shura in southern Afghanistan have diverged strategically in the past decade.\\44\\ Some of this is an accident of geography; when al-Qaeda leaders fled Tora Bora in eastern Afghanistan after the fall from power of the Taliban during the winter of 2001 they moved into the adjoining tribal regions of Pakistan, many hundreds of miles from the Quetta Shura's base in southwestern Pakistan, and into the welcoming arms of the Haqqani network. In short, al-Qaeda is embedded with the Haqqani Taliban, but not with the Mullah Omar Taliban. 5. How might the relationship between the Taliban and al-Qaeda be changed by the death of bin Laden? Now that bin Laden is dead, there is a real opportunity for the Taliban to disassociate itself from al-Qaeda, as it was bin Laden who, sometime before the 9/11 attacks, swore an oath of allegiance to Taliban leader Mullah Omar as the Amir al-Mu'minin, ``The Commander of the Faithful,'' a rarely invoked religious title that dates from around the time of the Prophet Mohammed. Mullah Omar could now communicate to his followers that the new leader of al-Qaeda does not need to swear an oath of allegiance to him as ``The Commander of the Faithful.'' This would be an important step for the Taliban to satisfy a key condition of peace talks with the U.S. and Afghan Governments; that they reject al-Qaeda, something that hitherto the Taliban has not done. If Mullah Omar does not take advantage of this opening in the near future, it is hard to imagine that he ever will. 6. What are the impediments to ``reconciliation'' with the Taliban's leadership? There are nine significant problems. First, who is there exactly to negotiate with in the Taliban? It's been a decade since their fall from power and the ``moderate'' Taliban who wanted to reconcile with the Afghan Government have already done so. They are the same group of Taliban who are constantly trotted out in any discussion of a putative Taliban deal: Mullah Zaeef, their former Ambassador to Pakistan; Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, their Foreign Minister; and Abdul Hakim Mujahid, who was the Taliban representative in the United States before 9/11. This group was generally opposed to bin Laden well before he attacked the United States. Bin Laden told intimates that his biggest enemies in the world were the United States and the Taliban Foreign Ministry, which was trying to put the kibosh on his anti-Western antics in Afghanistan. And today the ``moderate'' already-reconciled Taliban don't represent the Taliban on the battlefield because they haven't been part of the movement for the past decade. The key Taliban figure is still their leader, Mullah Omar, a.k.a., ``The Commander of the Faithful.'' The title indicates that Mullah Omar is not just the leader of the Taliban, but also of all Muslims, suggesting that Mullah Omar is not only a religious fanatic, but also a fanatic with significant delusions of grandeur.\\45\\ Negotiations with religious fanatics who have delusions of grandeur generally do not go well. Almost every country in the world--including the Taliban leader's quasi-patron, Pakistan--pleaded with Mullah Omar in the spring of 2001 not to blow up the giant Buddhas of Bamiyan, Afghanistan's greatest cultural patrimony. But he did so anyway. After 9/11, Mullah Omar was prepared to lose his entire regime on the point of principle that he would not give up bin Laden to the United States following the attacks on Manhattan and the Pentagon. And he did. Since his regime fell, Mullah Omar has also shown no appetite for negotiation or compromise. He is joined in this attitude by some senior members of his movement, such as Maulavi Abdul Kabir, a Taliban leader in eastern Afghanistan, who said in January, ``neither has there been any peace talk nor has any of the Islamic Emirate (the Taliban) shown any inclination toward it.'' \\46\\ Second, the Taliban has had 10 years to reject bin Laden and all his works, and they haven't done so. For this reason, Saudi Arabia, which has hosted ``talks about talks'' in Mecca between Afghan Government officials and some Taliban representatives,\\47\\ has soured on the process. For the Saudi Government, which is squarely in al- Qaeda's gun sights, a public repudiation of al-Qaeda by the Taliban is a nonnegotiable demand. And it hasn't happened. Third, ``the Taliban'' is really many Talibans, and so a deal with one insurgent group doesn't mean the end of the insurgency writ large. It's not clear that even Mullah Omar can deliver all of the Taliban that he nominally controls in southern Afghanistan, because they are often fissured into purely local groups, many of whom are a long way from Taliban headquarters across the border in Quetta, Pakistan. As Ambassador Richard Holbrooke commented 3 months before he died, ``There's no Ho Chi Minh. There's no Slobodan Milosevic. There's no Palestinian Authority.'' \\48\\ Instead, there are several leaders of the various wings of the insurgency, from the Quetta Shura in southern Afghanistan, to the Haqqani Network in the east, as well as smaller insurgent groups, such as Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e-Islami in the northeast. Fourth, the history of ``peace'' deals with the Taliban in Pakistan shows that the groups can't be trusted. Deals between the Pakistani Government and the Taliban in Waziristan in 2005 and 2006 and in Swat in 2009 were merely preludes to the Taliban establishing their brutal ``emirates,'' regrouping and then moving into adjoining areas to seize more territory.\\49\\ Fifth, the arrest in Pakistan last year of Mullah Baradar, the Taliban No. 2 who had been negotiating directly with Karzai, shows that the Pakistani military and government wants to retain a veto over any significant negotiations going forward.\\50\\ That isn't necessarily a bad thing, as certainly Pakistan's legitimate interests in the post- American Afghanistan must be recognized, but it also demonstrates that negotiations with the Taliban will not be as straightforward as just having the Afghan Government and the insurgents at the negotiating table. Sixth, another key player in any negotiations with the Taliban are the former leaders of the largely Tajik and Uzbek Northern Alliance who fought a bitter several-years war with the Taliban and who now occupy prominent positions in Afghanistan, for instance, the Minister of the Interior, Bismullah Khan, and Dr. Abdullah, Karzai's main rival for the Presidency in 2009, who is--at least for now--the most likely candidate to succeed Karzai in the 2014 Presidential elections. These leaders are not going to allow all they fought for to be reversed by a deal with the Taliban that gives them significant concessions on territory or principle. Dr. Abdullah is withering in his assessment of Karzai's olive branches to the Taliban who Karzai has described as his ``brothers,'' saying to me that this simply confuses ``our own soldiers which are fighting'' the Taliban. Seventh, the several meetings over the past 3 years between Afghan officials and Taliban representatives to discuss ``reconciliation'' in Mecca and in the Maldives have hitherto produced a big zero. A senior U.S. military officer dismissed these talks as ``reconciliation tourism,'' while an Afghan official joked with me that in landlocked Afghanistan, ``Everybody wanted to go to the Maldives for a meeting.'' Eighth, the debacle involving Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour last year shows how much of a fog surrounds the whole reconciliation process.\\51\\ Mullah Mansour was portrayed as one of the most senior of the Taliban leaders who was allegedly in direct negotiations with the Karzai government in the fall of 2010. Except it then turned out he wasn't Mullah Mansour at all, but a Quetta shopkeeper who had spun a good yarn about his Taliban credentials so he could pick up what a British Government report characterizes as ``significant sums.'' \\52\\ Finally, and most importantly: what do the Taliban really want? It's relatively easy to discern what they don't want: international forces in Afghanistan. But other than their blanket demand for the rule of sharia law, the Taliban have not articulated their vision for the future of Afghanistan. Do they envision a democratic state with elections? Do they see a role for women outside the home? What about education for girls? What about ethnic minorities? Richard Barrett, a British diplomat who heads the United Nations' group that monitors al-Qaeda and the Taliban, pointed out at a conference at the New America Foundation last year that ``it's difficult to deal with an insurgent group, which doesn't actually put forward any real policy.'' A similar point was made by Mohammad Stanikhzai, the point person in the Afghan Government dealing with the Taliban, when I met with him in December, who explained, ``For the governance, I don't think they [the Taliban] have a clear plan.'' 7. Given these problems, why try and negotiate with the Taliban, and are there reasons to think those negotiations might eventually work? Reaching an accommodation with the Taliban is going to be quite difficult, but that doesn't, of course, mean that it isn't worth trying. Even if peace talks are not successful immediately, they can have other helpful effects, such as splitting the facade of Taliban unity. Even simple discussions about the future shape of negotiations can help sow dissension in the Taliban ranks, while if such discussions do move forward in even incremental steps more intelligence can be garnered about what exactly is going on inside the shadowy Taliban movement. Also, getting the Taliban to enter into any negotiations means that they will no longer get to occupy the moral high ground of fighting a supposed holy war, but are instead getting their hands dirty in more conventional political back-room deals. Audrey Cronin of the National Defense University has systematically examined how and why terrorist/insurgent groups come to some kind of peace deal and has laid out some general principles about what that usually takes, which are worth considering in the context of Afghanistan.\\53\\ First, there must be recognition on both sides that a military stalemate has been reached. (In the early 1980s the American academic William Zartman coined the term a ``mutually hurting stalemate'' to describe the moment when combatants will start considering a peace settlement.) \\54\\ That recognition may now exist to some degree, given that over the past 6 months or so the Taliban have taken heavy losses in their heartlands of Kandahar, while the U.S. public has increasingly turned against what is already America's longest war. In March, 64 percent of Americans said the war was ``not worth fighting,'' up from 41 percent in 2007.\\55\\ An important shift in the Obama administration's stance on Taliban negotiations was recently signaled by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. While giving the Richard Holbrooke memorial lecture at the Asia Society in New York on February 18, Clinton said that previous American conditions for talks with the Taliban--that they lay down their arms, reject al-Qaeda, and embrace the Afghan Constitution--were no longer preconditions that the Taliban had to meet before negotiations could begin, but were ``necessary outcomes'' of the final peace process.\\56\\ Judging by the lack of media attention in the States at the time to this shift, this subtle but important distinction was probably also not well grasped by the Taliban, but it does represent a somewhat more flexible American position about dealing with the Taliban. Indeed, U.S. officials are already in some kind of talks with Taliban representatives, according to reports in the New Yorker and Washington Post.\\57\\ Similarly the Afghan Government has now adopted ``reconciliation'' as its official policy, setting up a ``High Peace Council'' in the fall to help facilitate those negotiations, a body that is made up, in part, of a number of leaders from the former Northern Alliance who are less likely to act as spoilers of a peace process if they feel they are a part of it. Successful negotiations often require a capable and trusted third- party sponsor. This condition seems also to be lacking right now: the Saudis are, at best, lukewarm about facilitating talks with the Taliban; the Pakistanis are not really trusted by any of the parties in the conflict, even by much of the Taliban, and while the United Nations may have some role to play in negotiations, Taliban attacks on U.N. personnel in Afghanistan last year don't suggest this avenue has much immediate promise. (Murmurings about a role for Turkey in facilitating a deal may have some potential given that Turkey has an Islamist government and is also a key member of NATO.) A peace deal also generally requires strong leadership on both the government and insurgent sides to force a settlement. Neither Hamid Karzai nor Mullah Omar fit this particular bill. Finally, Cronin explains that the overall political context must be favorable to negotiations for a deal to succeed. Here there is some real hope: While fewer then one in ten Afghans have a favorable view of the Taliban, a large majority is in favor of negotiating with them. Nationally, around three-quarters of Afghans favor talks, while in Kandahar the number goes up to a stratospheric 94 percent.\\58\\ All that said, the bottom line on the Taliban reconciliation process is that nothing of any real note is currently happening. According to a Western official familiar with the record of discussions with the Taliban, the chances of a deal with the Taliban similar to the Dayton Accords that ended the Balkans war in the mid-1990s or the Good Friday Agreement that ended the IRA campaign against the British Government are ``negligible'' for the foreseeable future. The official says that Mullah Omar needs his council of ulema (religious scholars) to sign off on a peace deal and there is ``no sign of this right now.'' Senior U.S. military officials tell me that it is their view that Mullah Omar is living at least some of the time in the southern Pakistani megacity of Karachi. 8. Might the Haqqani or Hezb-e-Islami (Gulbuddin Hekmatyar) factions of the Taliban be willing to consider a settlement? This is relatively plausible given that Hezb-e-Islami (Party of Islam) has long shown a far greater inclination to engage in conventional politics than the other insurgent groups. Hezb-e-Islami has a more nuanced take than other insurgent groups about what its preconditions are for talks with the Afghan Government; while much of the Taliban want foreign forces out before real talks can begin, Hezb- e-Islami has indicated that talks can begin in parallel with a timetable for withdrawal being agreed upon. For the moment, the Haqqanis are probably irreconcilable as they are too close to al-Qaeda. 9. There is an agglomeration of extremist groups operating in the lawless region near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, including the Pakistani Taliban, al-Qaeda, and other affiliated and other sectarian groups. How should policymakers prioritize which of these to work against? Policymakers should prioritize those South Asian groups that now threaten the West. One of bin Laden's most toxic legacies is that even terrorist groups that don't call themselves ``al-Qaeda'' have adopted his ideology. According to Spanish prosecutors, the late leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud, sent a team of would-be suicide bombers to Barcelona to attack the subway system there in January 2008. A Pakistani Taliban spokesman confirmed this in a videotaped interview in which he said that those suicide bombers ``were under pledge to Baitullah Mehsud'' and were sent because of the Spanish military presence in Afghanistan. In 2009 the Pakistani Taliban trained an American recruit for an attack in New York. Faisal Shahzad, who had once worked as a financial analyst in the accounting department at the Elizabeth Arden cosmetics company in Stamford, CT, travelled to Pakistan where he received 5 days of bombmaking training from the Taliban in the tribal region of Waziristan. Armed with this training and $12,000 in cash, Shahzad returned to Connecticut where he purchased a Nissan Pathfinder. He placed a bomb in the SUV and detonated it in Times Square on May 1, 2010, around 6 p.m., when the sidewalks were thick with tourists and theatergoers. The bomb, which was designed to act as a fuel-air explosive, luckily was a dud and Shahzad was arrested 2 days later as he tried to leave JFK airport for Dubai.\\59\\ Also based in the Pakistani tribal regions are a number of other jihadist groups allied to both the Taliban and al-Qaeda, such as the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and the Islamic Jihad Union that have trained dozens of Germans for attacks in Europe. Two Germans and a Turkish resident in Germany, for instance, trained in the tribal regions and then planned to bomb the massive U.S. Ramstein Airbase in Germany in 2007. Before their arrests, the men had obtained 1,600 pounds of industrial strength hydrogen peroxide, enough to make a number of large bombs.\\60\\ The Mumbai attacks of 2008 showed that bin Laden's ideas about attacking Western and Jewish targets had also spread to Pakistani militant groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), which had previously focused only on Indian targets. Over a 3-day period in late November 2008 LeT carried out multiple attacks in Mumbai targeting five-star hotels housing Westerners and a Jewish-American community center. The Pakistani- American David Headley played a key role in LeT's massacre in Mumbai, traveling to the Indian financial capital on five extended trips in the 2 years before the attacks. There Headley made videotapes of the key locations later attacked by the 10 LeT gunmen.\\61\\ Sometime in 2008, Headley hatched a plan to attack the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, which 3 years earlier had published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed that were deemed to be offensive by many Muslims. In January 2009 Headley traveled to Copenhagen, where he reconnoitered the Jyllands-Posten newspaper on the pretext that he ran an immigration business that was looking to place some advertising in the paper. Following his trip to Denmark, Headley met with Ilyas Kashmiri in the Pakistani tribal regions to brief him on his findings. Kashmiri ran a terrorist organization, Harakat-ul-Jihad Islami, closely tied to al-Qaeda. Headley returned to Chicago in mid-June 2009 and was arrested there 3 months later as he was preparing to leave for Pakistan again. He told investigators that he was planning to kill the Jyllands- Posten's cultural editor who had first commissioned the cartoons, as well as the cartoonist Kurt Westergaard who had drawn the cartoon he found most offensive; the Prophet Mohammed with a bomb concealed in his turban.\\62\\ One of the more predictable foreign policy challenges of the next years is a ``Mumbai II'': a large-scale attack on a major Indian city by a Pakistani militant group that kills hundreds. The Indian Government showed considerable restraint in its reaction to the provocation of the Mumbai attacks in 2008. Another such attack, however, would likely produce considerable political pressure on the Indian Government to ``do something.'' That something would likely involve incursions over the border to eliminate the training camps of Pakistani militant groups with histories of attacking India. That could lead in turn to a full-blown war for the fourth time since 1947 between India and Pakistan. Such a war would involve the possibility of a nuclear exchange and the certainty that Pakistan would move substantial resources to its eastern border and away from fighting the Taliban on its western border, relieving pressure on all the militant groups based there, including al-Qaeda. The Pakistani Taliban, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Harakat-ul-Jihad Islami, the Islamic Jihad Union and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan are all based or have a significant presence in Pakistan's tribal regions and have track records of trying to attack Western and/or American targets and should therefore all be considered threats to American interests. ---------------- References \\1\\ Barack Obama, ``Remarks by the President on a New Strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan,'' Washington, DC, March 27, 2009, (http:// www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-by-the-President-on-a-New- Strategy-for-Afghanistan-and-Pakistan/). \\2\\ Barbara Crossette, ``Rights Group Tells of Taliban Massacres,'' New York Times, February 19, 2001, (http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/19/ world/rights-group-tells-of-taliban-massacres. html). \\3\\ Jane Perlez and Pir Zubair Shah, ``Truce in Pakistan May Not Mean Peace, Just Leeway for Taliban,'' New York Times, March 5, 2009, (http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/06/world/asia/06swat.html). \\4\\ United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan, ``Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict: Annual Report 2010,'' March 2011, Kabul,Afghanistan.

The Chairman. Thank you very much. Mr. Pillar. STATEMENT OF PAUL PILLAR, PH.D., DIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES AND FACULTY MEMBER, CENTER FOR PEACE AND SECURITY STUDIES, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, WASHINGTON, DC Dr. Pillar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Afghanistan- Pakistan region has understandably been linked in American minds with extremism and terrorism for quite some time, but this link is not based on the inherent qualities of the region or the conflicts that bedevil it. There is no intrinsic connection between Afghanistan and international terrorism. In fact, Afghan nationals have been conspicuously rare in the ranks of international terrorists. Najibullah Zazi, whom you mentioned in your opening statement, Mr. Chairman, is a rare exception, but even he left Afghanistan at age 7 and lived in the United States since he was 14. What we know today as the Afghan Taliban constitute a highly insular, inward-looking group that is concerned overwhelmingly with the political and social order of Afghanistan; the leadership, that is, is so concerned. It concerns itself with the United States insofar as the United States interferes with its plans for that political and social order. The motives of the rank and file who have taken up arms under the Taliban label are at least as locally focused as those of the leadership, and probably hardly any of them have any perspectives that reach beyond Afghanistan's borders. The key point, in other words, is that the Afghan Taliban are not an international terrorist group. The connection between Afghan Taliban and al-Qaeda is an aspect largely of 1990s-era history. Back then, before 9/11, bin Laden provided material and manpower assistance to the Taliban as it waged a civil war against the Northern Alliance, and of course the Taliban provided hospitality to bin Laden in return. It was largely a marriage of convenience, even though they both had radical, although by no means identical, ideologies. As for any prospect of the Taliban and al-Qaeda reestablishing anything like that marriage that they had back in the 1990s, Taliban leaders are acutely aware that the biggest setback their movement ever suffered, their being swept from power in the opening weeks of Operation Enduring Freedom, was a direct result of an operation conducted by al-Qaeda. They have no incentive to do anything to facilitate a repeat of that experience. Besides, both the Taliban and al-Qaeda are well aware of the fact that the standards for the use of military force, United States military force, in Afghanistan have changed drastically since pre-9/11 days. Unlike back then, the establishment of anything remotely resembling al-Qaeda's earlier presence in Afghanistan would become a target for unrestricted use of United States air power, and that would be true whether or not the United States was conducting a counterinsurgency on the ground. I agree with Peter that bin Laden's death does affect the calculations of the Taliban's leadership, mainly for the reasons that Peter mentioned: that the previous gratitude of Mullah Omar and the Taliban leadership was more to bin Laden personally than to the al-Qaeda group. I would just add that probably also entering the Taliban leaders' calculations are the implication of the raid against bin Laden for what the United States is able and willing to do to hit targets important to it, even targets nestled deep inside Pakistan. And it can't have escaped the Taliban leaders' notice with regard to what that means for what we might do in Quetta or elsewhere. Finally, a word about what the successful U.S. operation against bin Laden indicates regarding the role of U.S. military forces in counterterrorism, including what this means for collecting the necessary intelligence. The raid at Abbottabad deep inside Pakistan illustrated that United States military boots on the ground are not necessary for even the precise type of intelligence required for such an operation. The same point's been, of course, repeatedly demonstrated by the drone strikes in the Northwest. Collection of intelligence is certainly an important part of counterinsurgency, but it is almost all intelligence pertinent to the counterinsurgency itself, rather than intelligence relating to terrorism that would hit the United States elsewhere. The intelligence work that reportedly underlay the successful operation was typical of the work aimed at terrorist targets. It involved piecing together fragments of information from a variety of technical and human sources and following up leads through intelligence and law enforcement resources. Interrogation of captured detainees is often part of that mix, but the most important detainees, such as 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, have been captured, not on a battlefield in the course of an insurgency, but instead as the result of themselves having been the targets of this kind of painstaking multisource intelligence work. Clearly, the raid demonstrated the usefulness of nearby military assets, but those are not the large forces involved in a counterinsurgency. Rather, they involve drone bases, bases for launching the kind of raid that took place at Abbottabad, and that is something far different. Thank you and I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement of Dr. Pillar follows:] Prepared Statement of Paul R. Pillar South Asia, and more particularly the portion of it encompassing Afghanistan and Pakistan, has come to be associated strongly with extremism and terrorism. That association is understandable, given the connection of the area with one of the most traumatic events in U.S. history. The lines of contention in the region are complex, however. Different dimensions of conflict there, such as between moderation and extremism, or what may pose a terrorist threat to the United States and what does not, do not coincide with each other. the afpak region and terrorism The connection of this region with militant Islamist terrorism is rooted in the insurgency against the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s. That insurgency became the biggest and most prominent jihad, attracting militant Muslims from many different countries. Although the anti-U.S. terrorist group we came to know as al-Qaeda did not develop as such until the late 1990s, its connection with Afghanistan and South Asia is based on the earlier effort against the Soviets. When Osama bin Laden left Sudan to take up residence in Afghanistan in 1996, he was returning to the scene of his earlier contribution, which was chiefly logistical, in helping the Afghan insurgents to defeat the Red Army. There is no intrinsic connection between Afghanistan and international terrorism. In fact, Afghan nationals are conspicuously absent from the ranks of international terrorists. A rare exception was Najibullah Zazi, who was arrested in 2009 for allegedly plotting to bomb the New York City transit system. But even Zazi had left Afghanistan with his family for Pakistan when he was 7 years old, and he had lived in the United States since he was 14. Pakistan has developed its own connections with international terrorism. This has included groups, most notably Lashkar-e-Taiba, with some capability to operate far afield. But the primary focus is still within South Asia, and specifically on the Kashmir dispute and other aspects of confrontation with India. In short, the link between this region and international terrorism is not based on inherent qualities of the region or of the conflicts that bedevil it. Instead it is more of a historical accident related to an attempt by the Soviet Union to quell an insurgency in a bordering state, with the link greatly enhanced in American minds by the residence in Afghanistan--10 years and more ago--of people associated with the 9/11 terrorist attack. Current violence in Afghanistan is a continuation of an Afghan civil war that began after a coup by Marxist-Leninists in 1978 and, although the lineup of protagonists has changed from time to time, has never really stopped. After the departure of the Soviets in 1989, the fall of the pro-Soviet Najibullah regime in 1992, and internecine fighting among the warlords who had pursued the insurgency, a new movement known as the Taliban--benefiting from Pakistani backing and the support of an Afghan public disgusted by the warlords' violent squabble--asserted control by the mid-1990s over all but the northern tier of the country. The civil war continued as a fight between the Taliban and a mostly non-Pashtun collection of militias known as the Northern Alliance. The intervention in late 2001 of a U.S.-led coalition, in what we call Operation Enduring Freedom, was a tipping of the balance in this civil war. It was enough of a tip for the Northern Alliance to overrun Kabul and to drive the Taliban from power. The current phase of the Afghan civil war, although commonly seen as a fight between the internationally backed government of Hamid Karzai and a terrorist-associated Afghan Taliban, is a far more complicated affair with multiple dimensions. The ethnic element is a large part of the conflict, with the Taliban largely Pashtun and other ethnic groups having a major role in the government forces. Other relevant divides are between Sunni and Shia and between rural interests and the urban elite. the afghan taliban The Afghan Taliban constitute a highly insular, inward-looking movement whose leadership is concerned overwhelmingly with the political and social order of Afghanistan. It concerns itself with the United States only insofar as the United States interferes with its plans for that political and social order. It is a loosely organized movement in which the leadership group known as the Quetta Shura, led by Mullah Omar, is the most important but not the sole point of decisionmaking. The motives of the rank and file who have taken up arms under the Taliban label are diverse and at least as locally focused as those of the leadership. Those motives include assorted grievances such as ones associated with collateral damage from military operations and resentment over what is seen as foreign military occupation. Probably few of the rank and file are driven primarily by a religiously based desire to remake the Afghan political order, and hardly any of them have perspectives that reach beyond Afghanistan's borders. The Afghan Taliban are not an international terrorist group. They have not conducted terrorist operations outside Afghanistan. There is nothing in their record or their objectives that suggests that they will. the taliban and al-qaeda The connection between the Afghan Taliban and al-Qaeda is an aspect of 1990s-era history. As the Taliban leaders were in the midst of their war against the Northern Alliance, and bin Laden was establishing a new home for himself and his followers after leaving Sudan, each side had something to offer the other. Bin Laden provided resources and manpower to the Taliban's prosecution of the civil war. The Taliban provided bin Laden hospitality. Although the two sides both had radical (though hardly identical) Islamist ideologies, the relationship was largely a marriage of convenience, and not without frictions. The basis for the marriage is largely gone. The Taliban cannot provide the hospitality they did when they were the government of three-fourths of Afghanistan. Bin Laden (before his death) and what is left of his organization within the region can provide little material support. As U.S. officials have repeatedly observed, there is minimal al-Qaeda presence in Afghanistan, with personnel numbering only in the scores. Any prospect for the Taliban and al-Qaeda to reestablish anything like the relationship they had in the years prior to 9/11 is severely constrained by the changes (some of them irreversible) that have since taken place in all of the parties concerned: the Taliban, al-Qaeda, and the United States. Taliban leaders are acutely aware that the biggest setback their movement has ever suffered--their being swept from power in the opening weeks of Operation Enduring Freedom--was a direct response to an al-Qaeda operation. They have no incentive to do anything that would facilitate a repeat of that experience. Al-Qaeda leaders are also unlikely to perceive an advantage in having more of a presence on the northwest side of the Durand Line than they already do on the southeast side of it. This is especially so because the Taliban and al-Qaeda alike know that the standards for use of U.S. military force in Afghanistan have changed drastically since pre-9/11 days. Unlike back then, the reestablishment of anything remotely resembling al-Qaeda's earlier presence in Afghanistan would become a target for unrestricted use of U.S. air power. This would be true whether or not the United States was still waging a counterinsurgency on the ground in Afghanistan. And such use of force would be far greater than the still major restrictions on anything the United States can do militarily in Pakistan. the afpak theater and terrorist threats to the united states Bin Laden never intended whatever organization he controlled to be the entire story as far as jihadist terrorism is concerned. The very name of his group-- al-Qaeda, or ``The Base''--implies that it would instead be a foundation or starting point from which bigger things would grow. This in fact is what happened. The overall violent jihadist movement to which the name ``al-Qaeda'' is customarily but loosely applied now goes well beyond anything bin Laden controlled or that his surviving associates in South Asia have been directing. Bin Laden's role in recent years was far more as a source of inspiration, ideology, and ideas (including operational ideas) than command and control. This role was confirmed by what has so far become publicly known about the material seized in the raid at Abbottabad. Most of the initiative, planning, and preparations for terrorist operations under the al-Qaeda label in recent years has come from outside South Asia. Some of it has come from formally named affiliates--most notably, though not exclusively, from the Yemen-based group calling itself Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Some has come from less formally affiliated groups and individuals, including during the past few years several individuals in the United States. Even though ``links'' are sometimes traced back to South Asia, the initiative is largely coming from the periphery. This pattern implies that the situation on the ground in the AfPak region is not one of the more important factors determining the degree of terrorist threat to Americans. To the extent that control of a piece of real estate matters, whether that real estate is in Afghanistan is hardly critical. Other places, such as Yemen, are available. This is in addition to the question of how much the control of any piece of real estate affects terrorist threats. A lesson from terrorist operations in recent years--including 9/11, most of the preparations for which took place well away from South Asia, including in Western cities--is that the effect is less than that of many other factors shaping terrorist threats, and that virtual space is more important than physical space in planning and coordinating terrorist operations. The point is not that terrorist groups will not use physical space when they have it-- they do--but that it is not one of the more important determinants of how capable they are and how much of a threat they pose. impact of bin laden's death The demise of bin Laden ends a period of well over a decade in which this most wanted of men was able in effect to thumb his nose at the United States and the West merely by staying at large and alive for so long. As such, his removal has dealt a psychological blow to his followers. Revelation of some of the circumstances in which he had been living and operating (or not operating) may also help to lower somewhat his standing even in death. For reasons mentioned earlier, the overall impact of bin Laden's death on the terrorist threat facing the United States is not as great as the enormous reaction to this event would suggest. The national catharsis that the killing of bin Laden involved is understandable, however, and undoubtedly affects the political environment in which further decisions within the United States about the AfPak theater will be taken. Bin Laden's departure will affect decisions within South Asia as well, and particularly the Taliban leadership's calculations regarding al-Qaeda and negotiations to resolve the conflict in Afghanistan. Any sense of debt among Mullah Omar and the Taliban leaders, dating back to the assistance that bin Laden gave them in the 1990s, was more to bin Laden personally than to his group. With bin Laden gone, the Afghan Taliban probably feel freer than before to renounce any prospect of future ties with what is left of al-Qaeda. For the Taliban leaders, al- Qaeda now means to them less a former ally in past phases of the civil war and more a source of potential trouble, with shades of the enormous trouble that al-Qaeda caused the Taliban in 2001. Probably also entering the Taliban leaders' calculations are the implications of the raid against bin Laden for what the United States is able and willing to do to hit targets important to it, even targets nestled deep inside Pakistan. What the United States did at Abbottabad could be done as well at Quetta or elsewhere. This fact may also incline the Taliban leaders more toward negotiations because of reduced confidence in their own security during an indefinite continuation of the conflict. Factoring in the Pakistani military's likely thinking-- following the embarrassment of Abbottabad, any reduced leverage of Pakistan against the United States, and what this may mean regarding future hospitality in Pakistan--would make the Taliban leaders even less sure of being able to wage their insurgency indefinitely from havens beyond the Durand Line. In brief, the net effect of bin Laen's death has probably been to improve the opportunities for negotiations to wind down the war in Afghanistan. military forces and counterterrorism The successful U.S. operation against bin Laden sheds additional light on the role of U.S. military forces in counterterrorism, including with regard to the collection of necessary intelligence. Military force is one of several tools that can be used for counterterrorism, intelligence being another one. It can be used in several specific ways for counterterrorist purposes, ranging from the elimination of a terrorist leader, as was the case with the bin Laden operation, to striking back at a state that has perpetrated a terrorist act. And of course, the United States maintains and uses military forces for many other functions besides counterterrorism. Today in Afghanistan--although Operation Enduring Freedom began as a direct and justified response to a terrorist act--U.S. military forces and their coalition partners are performing some of those other functions, which involve trying to stabilize the Afghan state and waging a counterinsurgency that is part of the current phase of the Afghan civil war. The raid at Abbottabad, deep inside Pakistan, illustrated that U.S. military boots on the ground are not necessary for even the precise type of intelligence required for such an operation. The same point has been repeatedly demonstrated by the strikes against other terrorist targets with missiles launched from unmanned aircraft over northwest Pakistan. There is no reason to suppose that the forces involved in waging a counterinsurgency, which are large in number and focused on securing territory and defeating insurgents, will be a significant factor in collecting intelligence on international terrorism. It is not as if insurgents who are observed or captured on the battlefield are, when they are not waging a guerrilla war, involved in hatching international terrorist plots or even have access to those who do. Collection of intelligence is certainly an important part of counterinsurgency, but it is almost all intelligence pertinent to the counterinsurgency itself, not intelligence having to do with the sort of terrorism that might otherwise threaten Americans. The intelligence work that reportedly underlay the successful operation against bin Laden was typical of the work aimed at terrorist targets, although obviously the very high priority of this particular target meant that disproportionate time, effort, and resources were devoted to it. The work entails the exploitation of fragmentary reporting from a variety of technical and human sources. It also entails painstaking following up of leads through intelligence and law enforcement resources. Interrogation of detainees sometimes contributes to the mix, although the most important detainees, such as 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, have been captured not on a battlefield in the midst of an insurgency but instead as the result of themselves having been the targets of the same kind of painstaking, multisource intelligence work. The raid at Abbottabad points to the value of nearby military assets, but they are assets of a very specialized sort. They include staging areas or bases for the operation of drones or the launching of raids. They include highly skilled forces specially trained to accomplish the sort of task the SEALs did at bin Laden's compound. These are assets far different in size from a counterinsurgency force charged with securing large amounts of territory. A final consideration to remember in any discussion of the use of military force in counterterrorism is how such use may affect broader perceptions and emotions that in turn affect the propensity of some individuals to resort to terrorism, including anti-U.S. terrorism. The effects include resentment and anger in the areas immediately affected, particularly over unavoidable collateral damage to civilians and their property. We have seen much of this in the war in Afghanistan, and it has been reflected in the increased numbers of those willing to take up arms under the banner of the Taliban. The effects also include lending credibility to the fraudulent, but unfortunately influential, extremist narrative according to which the United States is determined to kill Muslims, occupy their lands, and plunder their resources. The Chairman. Thank you very much, Dr. Pillar. Dr. Fair. STATEMENT OF C. CHRISTINE FAIR, PH.D., ASSISTANT PROFESSOR, CENTER FOR PEACE AND SECURITY STUDIES, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, WASHINGTON, DC Dr. Fair. Thank you, Senator Kerry, Senator Lugar, and esteemed colleagues, for the opportunity to discuss Pakistan's militant landscape, with particular focus upon Lashkar-e-Taiba as I was requested to do. As you know, Pakistan has raised and nurtured a number of militant groups, Lashkar-e-Taiba being just one, to operate in India and in Afghanistan. These are distinct from the Pakistani Taliban, which has been ravaging the state, although part of the Pakistan Taliban does draw personnel from rebel erstwhile proxies. Rather than speaking of militants generally, I have focused upon the differences across these groups, to understand why Pakistan will not abandon Lashkar-e-Taiba in particular. To state at the outset, none of the groups that I will discuss will be significantly and adversely affected by Osama bin Laden's demise. When we disaggregate this complex militant market, we see that these Islamist militant groups differ significantly in their theological orientations and this, as I'm going to argue, is important. Al-Qaeda in Pakistan and elsewhere is Wahhabi. The Afghan Taliban are Deobandi. The Kashmiri groups actually draw from a number of traditions, including Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, which is Jamaat-e-Islami; a number of Deobandi groups, such as Jaish-e- Mohammed, Hargatho Jihad Islami and so forth, and Lashkar-e- Taiba, which is Ahl-e-Hadith in its orientation. In addition, there are sectarian groups. This is almost exclusively Deobandi--who are targeting Shia in Pakistan. They include the Besa Bey Pakistan and Lashkar-e-Jhungvi. In addition, these groups kill other Sunni Muslims, such as Sufis or Barelvis. They also attack Ahmediyyas and non-Muslims. Then finally, there is the Tehreek-e-Taliban-e-Pakistan, or the Pakistani Taliban. They are also Deo"
