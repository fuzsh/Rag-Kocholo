        "text": "The death toll from a three-day Israeli raid on the occupied West Bank rose to 20 on Friday, Israel and the Palestinian Red Crescent said, while violence raged on in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIt came as US-based aid group Anera said an Israeli strike killed four Palestinians accompanying its convoy on Thursday. The Israeli military reported it had struck armed assailants.\n\nThe UN's World Food Programme on Wednesday said it had suspended aid operations after one of its vehicles was hit by an Israeli strike.\n\nIn the United States, Vice President Kamala Harris pledged she would not change Washington's policy of supplying weapons to Israel if elected to the top job in November. But she stressed it was time to \"end this war\" in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has described its raids on towns and refugee camps across the northern West Bank as \"counter-terrorism\" operations.\n\nThey have killed at least 20 Palestinians since Wednesday, the military and the Palestinian Red Crescent said.\n\nPalestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad have said at least 13 of those killed were their fighters.\n\nThe military earlier said it killed four Hamas militants in an air strike near the northern city of Jenin on Friday.\n\nWitnesses told AFP the strike hit a car in the town of Zababdeh, southeast of the city.\n\nIsraeli troops pulled back from other West Bank towns late Thursday but fighting raged on around Jenin, long a hub of militant activity.\n\nAn AFP journalist reported loud explosions from the city's refugee camp and thick plumes of smoke rising from the area.\n\n-AFP\n\n'An already explosive situation': UN warns on West Bank violence\n\nThe United Nations has warned the military operation which Israel launched in the West Bank early on Wednesday is \"fuelling an already explosive situation\" in the territory and has pressed Israel to end it.\n\nOn Friday, Israel announced it killed Hamas commander Wassem Hazem and two others in the West Bank city of Jenin.\n\nIsrael has described its raids on towns and refugee camps across the northern West Bank as \"counter-terrorism\" operations.\n\nIsraeli forces have killed at least 16 Palestinians in the raids since Wednesday, a toll confirmed by the Palestinian health ministry.\n\nAn AFP journalist reported loud explosions from the city's refugee camp and thick plumes of smoke rising from the area.\n\nIsraeli troops pulled back from other West Bank towns late Thursday but fighting raged on around Jenin, long a hub of militant activity.\n\n- AFP\n\nUN official questions global commitment to 'international legal order' amid Gaza war\n\nJoyce Msuya, acting head of the UN's humanitarian office (OCHA), expressed concern over the impact of the Gaza war on civilians.\n\n\"What we have witnessed over the past 11 months... calls into question the world's commitment to the international legal order that was designed to prevent these tragedies,\" Msuya said.\n\n\"It forces us to ask: What has become of our basic sense of humanity?\"\n\nThe current fighting was sparked by Hamas' October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1 199 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 40 602 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry.\n\nThe UN rights office says most of the dead are women and children.\n\nCalling on the Security Council and wider international community to use its leverage to end the war, Msuya urged the release of hostages and \"a sustained ceasefire in Gaza\".\n\n- AFP\n\n'Civilians in a state of limbo': UN official bemoans Gaza situation\n\nJoyce Msuya, acting head of the UN's humanitarian office (OCHA) complained about the humanitarian situation in Gaza amid Israeli evacuation orders.\n\nMsuya's comments came after the UN had to halt the movement of aid and aid workers within Gaza on Monday due to a new Israeli evacuation order for the Deir al-Balah area, which had become a hub for its workers.\n\n\"More than 88% of Gaza's territory has come under an (Israeli) order to evacuate at some point,\" Msuya said, adding that civilians, \"in a state of limbo\", were being forced into an area equivalent to just 11% of the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"The evacuation orders appear to defy the requirements of international humanitarian law,\" she added.\n\nIsrael's war against Palestinian militant group Hamas has come under increasing scrutiny as the civilian death toll rises, but international powers including the US have failed so far to help negotiate a ceasefire.\n\n- AFP\n\nUN aid official questions world's 'humanity' as Gaza war rages\n\nA top UN aid official on Thursday questioned \"what has become of our basic humanity\", as the war in Gaza rages and humanitarian operations struggle to respond.\n\nJoyce Msuya, acting head of the UN's humanitarian office (OCHA), said that \"we cannot plan more than 24 hours in advance because we struggle to know what supplies we will have, when we will have them or where we will be able to deliver.\"\n\n\"Civilians are hungry. They are thirsty. They are sick. They are homeless. They have been pushed beyond... what any human being should bear,\" she told the Security Council.\n\n- AFP\n\nIsrael tells US shots fired at WFP vehicle in Gaza after 'communication error'\n\nIsrael told the United States that an initial review found that shots were fired at a World Food Programme (WFP) vehicle in the Gaza Strip after a \"communication error\" between Israeli military units, the deputy US envoy to the United Nations said on Thursday.\n\n\"We have urged them to immediately rectify the issues within their system,\" Deputy US Ambassador to the UN Robert Wood told a UN Security Council meeting on Gaza.\n\n\"Israel must not only take ownership for its mistakes, but also take concrete actions to ensure the IDF does not fire on UN personnel again.\"\n\nThe WFP temporarily suspended movement of its employees across Gaza on Wednesday, saying at least 10 bullets struck one of its clearly marked vehicles as it approached an Israeli military checkpoint.\n\nWFP said in a statement that a convoy of two armoured vehicles received \"multiple clearances by Israeli authorities to approach\" the Wadi Gaza bridge checkpoint on Tuesday evening.\n\nBullets hit one of the vehicles, but no one in it was hurt.\n\n- Reuters\n\nIsrael agrees to 3-day 'humanitarian pauses' in Gaza to allow polio vaccinations\n\nIsrael has agreed to a series of three-day \"humanitarian pauses\" in Gaza to allow UN health officials to administer polio vaccinations in the territory, the World Health Organization said Thursday.\n\n\"The way we discussed and agreed, the campaign will start on the first of September, in central Gaza, for three days, and there will be a humanitarian pause during the vaccination,\" said Rik Peeperkorn, the agency's representative for Palestinian territories.\n\nThe vaccination rollout will also cover southern and northern Gaza, which will each get their own three-day pauses, Peeperkorn told reporters, adding that Israel had agreed to allow an additional day if required.\n\nIsraeli authorities did not immediately respond to AFP's request for comment, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday night the new measures were \"not a ceasefire.\"\n\nHamas said it supports the \"UN humanitarian truce.\"\n\nThe United States and European Union have both voiced concern over polio in Gaza, after the first case there in 25 years was confirmed this month in an unvaccinated 10-month-old baby.\n\n- AFP\n\nIsrael army says kills 7 in West Bank raids including militant leader\n\nIsrael's military said troops killed a Palestinian militant leader and six others on Thursday, the second day of large-scale \"counter-terrorism\" operations in the occupied West Bank.\n\nA military spokesperson gave an overall death toll of 16 Palestinian militants since Israeli forces launched coordinated raids across the northern West Bank on Wednesday. The Palestinian health ministry reported at least 15 dead.\n\nA military statement said five were killed on Thursday in the Tulkarem refugee camp including Muhammad Jaber, also known as Abu Shujaa. Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad said he was its commander in the nearby Nur Shams refugee camp.\n\nAccording to Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani, \"he was a head of a terror network in Nur Shams\", also accusing Jaber of \"inciting\" young Palestinians to carry out attacks against Israelis.\n\nShoshani told an online media briefing that Jaber was killed in \"a significant exchange of fire\" between Israeli forces and \"armed terrorists hiding\" in a mosque in the Tulkarem camp.\n\nTulkarem governor Mustafa Taqatqa rejected the army's account, saying the five men were not inside the mosque when killed.\n\n\"A rocket was fired at a house and the young men were not in the mosque,\" Taqatqa told AFP.\n\nShoshani said that one member of the Israeli security forces was injured in the operation that killed Jaber.\n\n-AFP\n\nNear Gaza border, loved ones shout messages to Hamas-held hostages\n\nWearing a sticker on her shirt that read \"328\" - the number of days her son has been held hostage - Rachel Goldberg-Polin went near the Israel-Gaza border on Thursday to deliver a message.\n\n\"Hersh! It's Mom... I pray to God he brings you back. Right now. I love you, stay strong, survive,\" she yelled into a microphone in hopes the 23-year-old Israeli-American might hear her.\n\nShe was joined by dozens of other relatives of hostages who are still held in the Gaza Strip nearly 11 months since Hamas' unprecedented attack on southern Israel triggered the ongoing war.\n\nThe Palestinian militants seized 251 hostages during the 7 October attack, 103 of whom are still captive in Gaza including 33 the military says are dead.\n\nThose who made the trip on Thursday to kibbutz Nirim embraced and supported one another as they tried to find words of comfort and encouragement.\n\n- AFP\n\nDeadly Israeli raids in West Bank as Gaza war rages\n\nIsrael launched a large-scale operation on Wednesday in the occupied West Bank, where the military said it killed Palestinian fighters, as the nearly 11-month-old Gaza war showed no signs of abating.\n\nThe military said its forces killed nine militants while the Palestinian health ministry reported 11 deaths in the West Bank, where violence has surged during the war sparked by Gaza rulers Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel. Children were among those killed, according to the United Nations, while Hamas said the fatalities included three members of its armed wing in the Jenin refugee camp.\n\nThe war in Gaza has killed more than 40 000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, while Israel's offensive has caused widespread destruction and displacement. Early on Wednesday, Israel launched coordinated raids across four northern West Bank cities - Jenin, Nablus, Tubas and Tulkarem - where the military has focused much of its recent operations. Armoured columns entered two refugee camps, in Tulkarem and Tubas, as well as Jenin, where an AFP correspondent said gunfire and explosions were heard into the evening.\n\nThe Red Crescent said the Palestinian health authority claimed Israeli forces killed 11 people and wounded 24 in the raids. Its West Bank chief Younes al-Khatib said ambulances came under Israeli fire and \"one of our staffers was hit\".Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the Israeli operations took place \"in close proximity to four hospitals\" and at least some \"have been surrounded\", affecting the movement of medical teams. Guterres \"calls for an immediate cessation of these operations,\" a later statement from his office said.\n\nPalestinian president Mahmud Abbas cut short a visit to Saudi Arabia and headed home to \"follow up on the latest developments\", Palestinian official media said. Jordan's King Abdullah II told visiting US lawmakers a Gaza truce was needed \"to stop the cycle of violence in the region\", according to a royal statement.\n\nViolence also raged in the Gaza Strip, where the civil defence agency reported Israeli strikes killed at least 12 people, and in Lebanon, where Israel's military said it killed a \"significant\" Palestinian militant.\n\n- AFP\n\nIsraeli army says it failed West Bank town during settler terror attack\n\nThe Israeli military said on Wednesday it had \"failed\" in its response to a settler attack in the occupied West Bank earlier this month that Palestinian officials said killed one man.\n\nThe 15 August raid on the northern West Bank village of Jit came amid soaring violence in the Palestinian territory during the Gaza war and growing international concern over an uptick in attacks by Jewish settlers.\n\nMajor General Avi Bluth, head of the military's Central Command which operates in the West Bank, was quoted in a statement as saying the attack was \"a very serious terror incident in which Israelis set out to deliberately harm the residents of the town of Jit, and we failed by not succeeding to arrive earlier to protect them\".\n\nJit residents have said about 100 settlers armed with knives and firearms set fire to cars and homes in the village.\n\nThe military, releasing on Wednesday a summary of its investigation, said the group wore masks, threw rocks and Molotov cocktails and set three vehicles and two buildings on fire.\n\nThe Palestinian health ministry said a 23-year-old Palestinian man, Rashid Sada, was shot dead in the attack.\n\nLast week, Israeli police and the Shin Bet internal security service said they had arrested four suspects for \"terrorist\" acts in connection with the incident.\n\nThe military's investigation found that the first troops at the scene \"did not manage to fully gauge the situation\" and \"needed to act more decisively\", the statement said.\n\n\"Several members of the rapid response team from a nearby (settlement) community, who were not in active reserve duty, arrived at the scene without authorisation, dressed in uniform, and acted contrary to the authority defined for the members of the rapid response team,\" it added without elaborating.\n\nTwo members of the team \"were dismissed, and their weapons were confiscated\", it said.\n\nThe statement said the shooting that killed Sada and wounded another Palestinian occurred before more Israeli forces managed to disperse the assailants.\n\n\"The troops acted assertively, risking their lives, containing the rioters, and pushing them out of the town using crowd dispersal means and firing into the air,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Half an hour after the incident began, all Israelis were removed from the town.\"\n\nBluth was quoted as saying the case \"will not be closed until we bring the perpetrators to justice\".\n\n- AFP\n\nFate of Gaza ceasefire deal in Hamas leader's hands, says US intel official\n\nThe fate of a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas is \"largely a question that is going to be answered\" by the leader of the Palestinian militant group, Deputy CIA Director David Cohen said on Wednesday.\n\nCohen did not refer to Hamas' leader, Yahya Sinwar, by name. The Israelis were showing seriousness in the negotiations, Cohen told an intelligence and national security summit in Washington.\n\nMediators from the US, Egypt and Qatar have been working to strike a deal between the sides and prevent a broader regional war.\n\nOn those efforts, Cohen said: \"There may be episodes where people would step back from the brink, but I don't think anybody can be confident that that effort to control escalation is something that ... any party in that region\" can control.\n\n-Reuters\n\nUnder pressure, Netanyahu promises Israel is 'working tirelessly to bring all our hostages back'\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has faced growing criticism from protesters accusing him of blocking a deal and prolonging the war for political gain, said Israel was \"working tirelessly to bring all our hostages back\".\n\nHostage rescues are rare.\n\nThe Israeli military rescued Kaid Farhan Alkadi, 52, in a tunnel in southern Gaza.\n\nHe is only the eighth freed alive by Israeli forces since the military began its ground operations in the Gaza Strip on 27 October.\n\nScores were released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israel during a week-long truce in November - the only one in the war so far.\n\nIn a video issued by Netanyahu's office after he spoke with Alkadi, the hawkish leader said \"military presence on the ground and continuous military pressure on Hamas\" are required to secure the captives' release.\n\nA key sticking point in negotiations has been Israel's insistence on keeping control of a Gaza-Egypt border strip to stop Hamas from rearming, something the militant group has refused to countenance.\n\n- AFP\n\n'The only way': Israeli hostage group calls for negotiations to return all Hamas captives\n\nIsraeli campaign group the Hostages and Missing Families Forum welcomed the release of Kaid Farhan Alkadi, 52, in a tunnel in southern Gaza, but stressed that \"a negotiated deal is the only way\" to ensure the return of other captives.\n\nAt Israel's Soroka Medical Centre where Alkadi was taken to, hospital director Shlomi Kodesh told AFP he \"appears to be in good condition\".\n\n\"But anyone who was in tunnels for such an extended period of time is prone to significant medical problems\" and Alkadi was kept for \"continued evaluation\", Kodesh told AFP.\n\nA resident of Rahat, a predominantly Bedouin Arab town in southern Israel, Alkadi had been working as a guard at a warehouse in one of the areas militants stormed on 7 October, according to the military.\n\n- AFP\n\nIsraeli hostage Kaid Farhan Alkadi was rescued 'when he was alone'\n\nThe Israeli military said a hostage was rescued on Tuesday from a Gaza tunnel, more than 10 months after the Israeli Bedouin man was seized during the Hamas attack that triggered a devastating war.\n\nThe Israeli military said forces had found Kaid Farhan Alkadi, 52, in a tunnel in southern Gaza \"when he was alone\", despite a previous assessment that militants \"and explosives\" were there.\n\nHe is one of 251 people abducted by Palestinian militants during the 7 October attack on southern Israel, 104 of whom are still captive in Gaza including 34 the military says are dead.\n\nTalks aiming to secure a Gaza truce and hostage release deal meanwhile continued in Qatar, a US official said.\n\nNeither Israel nor Hamas have confirmed their participation.\n\n- AFP\n\nNamibia says it barred ship carrying weapons bound for Israel\n\nNamibia's government says it stopped a ship carrying weapons destined for Israel from docking, in what state media described as \"a bold move\".\n\nThe New Era reported that justice minister Yvonne Dausab was responsible for the final decision to prevent the MV Kathrin from using its harbours.\n\nRegistry data shows that ship sails under the flag of Portugal, while tracking data shows it left port in Vietnam on Thursday, bound for Walvis Bay.\n\nThe Namibian previously reported that the Namibian organisation Economic and Social Justice Trust had called for the ship to be denied port access, on the suspicion that it carried arms destined for Israel.\n\nNeither paper nor the organisation said what weapons the ship carried, or why it was thought to be carrying weapons.\n\nDausab said Namibian police had confirmed the vessel was carrying explosives.\n\n\"Upon receiving reports that a vessel may be carrying weapons intended for Israel, I addressed a letter to Cabinet, international relations ministry, works ministry, as well as the safety and security ministry, advising and reminding them of our international obligations, not only under the Genocide Convention but also as articulated in the recent advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice (ICJ),\" the minister said, as quoted by New Era.\n\n\"It is against this background that I requested the relevant authorities not to allow the vessel MV Kathrin to dock at the Walvis Bay port.\"\n\n- Phillip de Wet\n\nHouthis a 'wild card' risk for Israel says top US military leader.\n\nAir Force General CQ Brown, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff cautioned that there was the risk to Israel posed by Iran's militant allies in places such as Iraq, Syria and Jordan who have attacked US troops as well as Yemen's Houthis, who have targeted Red Sea shipping and even fired drones at Israel.\n\n\"And do these others actually go off and do things on their own because they're not satisfied - the Houthis in particular,\" Brown said, calling the Shia group the \"wild card\".\n\nIran has vowed a severe response to the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, which took place as he visited Tehran in July and which it blamed on Israel.\n\nIsrael has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement.\n\nBrown said the US military was better positioned to aid in the defence of Israel, and its own forces in the Middle East, than it was on 13 April, when Iran launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, unleashing hundreds of drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles.\n\nStill, Israel, the US and other allies managed to destroy almost all of the weapons before they reached their targets.\n\n\"We're better postured,\" Brown said.\n\nHe noted Sunday's decision to maintain two aircraft carrier strike groups in the Middle East, as well as extra squadron of F-22 fighter jets.\n\n- Reuters\n\nIsraeli settlers kill Palestinian in West Bank, military strike kills 5 others\n\nIsraeli settlers shot dead one Palestinian and wounded three others in the occupied West Bank's Bethlehem, while five others were killed in an Israeli strike on the Nur Shams refugee camp near the city of Tulkarm, the Palestinian health ministry said.\n\nThe Israeli military said its aircraft struck a militant operations centre in the camp, and that troops were separately blocking routes and conducting searches in the West Bank following reports of an abduction.\n\nIt was looking into reports on the settler raid, it added.\n\nPalestinians regularly accuse Israeli security forces of standing by and allowing groups of violent settlers to attack their houses and villages and the incidents have attracted increasing concern internationally.\n\nThe US and a number of European countries have imposed sanctions on violent settlers and repeatedly called on Israel to do more to curb the attacks.\n\n- Reuters\n\nRisk of broader war eases a bit after Israel-Hezbollah exchange, says top US general\n\nThe near-term risk of a broader war in the Middle East has eased somewhat after Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah exchanged fire without further escalation but Iran still poses a significant danger as it weighs a strike on Israel, America's top general said on Monday.\n\nAir Force General CQ Brown, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke to Reuters after emerging from a three-day trip to the Middle East that saw him fly into Israel just hours after Hezbollah launched hundreds of rockets and drones at Israel, and Israel's military struck Lebanon to thwart a larger attack.\n\nIt was one of the biggest clashes in more than 10 months of border warfare, but it also ended with limited damage in Israel and without immediate threats of more retaliation from either side.\n\nBrown noted Hezbollah's strike was just one of two major threatened attacks against Israel that emerged in recent weeks.\n\nIran is also threatening an attack over the killing of a Hamas leader in Tehran in July.\n\nAsked if the immediate risk of a regional war had declined, Brown said: \"Somewhat, yes.\"\n\n\"You had two things you knew were going to happen. One's already happened. Now it depends on how the second is going to play out,\" Brown said while flying out of Israel.\n\n\"How Iran responds will dictate how Israel responds, which will dictate whether there is going to be a broader conflict or not.\"\n\n- Reuters\n\nIn Chicago's Little Palestine, locals protest and mourn amid Gaza war\n\nStanding outside his local mosque in suburban Chicago, Robhi Gharallah observed that Israel's war in Gaza is on everyone's mind in his neighbourhood.\n\n\"We're praying. We're protesting. We're raising funds. We're doing all we can for Gaza,\" Gharallah said after Friday prayer.\n\nBut Gharallah said there is one action he and his neighbours are uncertain about - and that is how to vote in the upcoming presidential election.\n\nGharallah lives in Bridgeview, Illinois, an area informally known as Chicago's Little Palestine. It is in Cook County and is home to an estimated 22 518 Palestinian Americans - one of the largest Palestinian communities in the US.\n\nBut he said Palestinian Americans are facing a dilemma in the next election, with both the Republican candidate Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Kamala Harris showing staunch support for Israel.\n\n\"There is no good in Ammar nor Amira,\" Gharallah said, using male and female names in Arabic to represent Trump and Harris.\n\n\"We are American citizens, and we want to vote, but we don't know for whom. Whether you vote for this one or this one, it's the same thing. And if you don't vote, it's like you don't exist [politically].\"\n\nBridgeview was in the national spotlight this month, as the Democratic National Convention arrived in Chicago.\n\n- Al Jazeera"
