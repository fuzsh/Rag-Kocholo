But this one was of particular interest to the National Security Agency, and contained clues that put the sender's husband in the cross hairs of a CIA drone.\n\nDays later, Hassan Ghul -- an associate of Osama bin Laden who provided a critical piece of intelligence that helped the CIA find the al-Qaida leader -- was killed by a drone strike in Pakistan's tribal belt.\n\nThe U.S. government has never publicly acknowledged killing Ghul.

He was captured in 2004 and helped expose bin Laden's courier network before spending two years at a secret CIA prison. Then, in 2006, the United States delivered him to his native Pakistan, where he was released and returned to the al-Qaida fold.\n\nBut beyond filling in gaps about Ghul, the documents provide the most detailed account of the intricate collaboration between the CIA and the NSA in the drone campaign.\n\nThe Washington Post is withholding many details about those missions, at the request of U.S. intelligence officials who cited potential damage to ongoing operations and national security.\n\nThe NSA is \"focused on discovering and developing intelligence about valid foreign intelligence targets,\" an NSA spokeswoman said in a statement provided to The Post on Wednesday, adding that the agency's operations \"protect the nation and its interests from threats such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\"\n\nIn the search for targets,Even so, former CIA officials"
