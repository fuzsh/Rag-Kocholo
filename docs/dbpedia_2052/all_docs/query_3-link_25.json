        "text": "An explosion in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killed one person and injured 11 others, Taliban police spokesman Khalid Zadran told RFE/RL on August 11, an attack apparently targeting the country’s minority Hazara community.\n\nZadran said the explosion was caused by a bomb planted in a minibus in Kabul's Dasht-e Barchi area, where many Shi'ite Hazara reside.\n\nNo group immediately claimed responsibility, but the Sunni-led Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) branch has carried out numerous attacks since the Taliban seized power in August 2021, often targeting Taliban officials, foreign nationals, the Hazara community, and others it considers incompatible with its extreme interpretation of Islam.\n\nA female resident told RFE/RL that the Taliban authorities have failed to protect residents of the Dasht-e Barchi area.\n\n\"Explosions in Dasht-e Barchi occur regularly without anyone taking responsibility for maintaining security,\" she said.\n\n\"The Taliban say they have ensured security, but that's only words. They don't care who's killed or what attacks occur. If they're genuinely ensuring security, why do explosions keep happening?\"\n\nShi'ite Muslims, the country's largest religious minority, have complained that the Sunni Taliban has not done enough to protect them from terror attacks and have accused the Taliban itself of abuses, including \"killing, torture, and forced displacement.\" Most Shi'a in Afghanistan are members of the historically persecuted Hazara ethnic minority.\n\nA report this year by the U.S. State Department cited several examples of terror attacks against the Hazara community and stated that religious freedoms have continued to deteriorate under harsh Taliban rule in Afghanistan.\n\n\"Consistent with trends observed in past years, many suicide bombings and other attacks on civilians targeted Shi’a Muslims, particularly ethnic Hazara,\" by the IS-K terrorist group, it said.\n\nThe report identified IS-K as the \"most serious threat\" in the Central and South Asia region and said the group was \"projecting terror beyond Afghanistan.\"\n\nThe U.S. report also cited UN officials in Afghanistan as saying the Taliban \"had marginalized the minority Shi'a Muslim population in an effort to force them to leave the country.\"\n\nBulgarian investigative journalist Christo Grozev has urged Western news organizations to withdraw any correspondents working in Russia, saying the value of having reporters there is outweighed by the risk of having them seized and used by the Kremlin as assets in future prisoner swaps.\n\n\"This is a period of time when information from Russia cannot be reported honestly,\" the Bellingcat journalist told Bulgarian public broadcaster BNT in an interview released on August 10.\n\n\"Therefore, the added value of having your representative there is very small compared to the risk of our [journalistic] colleagues being arrested and simply becoming an asset in a [prisoner] swap fund for the future.\"\n\nThe remarks come after a major exchange of detained and imprisoned persons was conducted on August 1 between the United States, Germany, and other Western nations on one side and Russia and Belarus on the other.\n\nBNT, CNN, and others have reported that Grozev took part in preliminary negotiations on the prisoner exchange, actions he has indirectly confirmed in a series of interviews.\n\nRussia got back eight prisoners held in the West, including a member of its FSB security service convicted of murder in Germany, and 16 people were released from Russian and Belarusian jails. They included journalists Evan Gershkovich of The Wall Street Journal and Alsu Kurmasheva of RFE/RL, both U.S. citizens.\n\nThe 32-year-old Gershkovich was detained in Russia in March 2023 while on a reporting trip in Yekaterinburg. He was sentenced in July to 16 years in prison on spying charges that were rejected by the United States and his WSJ employer.\n\nKurmasheva, a 47-year-old mother of two, was arrested in Kazan in October 2023 and first charged with failing to register as a \"foreign agent\" under a punitive Russian law that targets journalists, civil society activists, and others. She was subsequently charged with spreading falsehoods about the Russian military -- charges she and RFE/RL denied -- and sentenced to 6 1/2 years.\n\n\"The arrest of foreigners in Russia is planned,\" Grozev said.\n\n\"It is planned with the aim to fill a [prisoner] swap fund. Our colleagues from The Wall Street Journal published an extensive investigation practically proving the arrest of Evan had been set up as a planned operation -- not the result of some alleged counterintelligence about him collecting secret information.\"\n\n“They were planning to arrest someone with his status because they knew\" it would become a major issue in the United States.\n\nGrozev said the list of people considered for the prisoner swap changed over the years of negotiations.\n\n“The original list was put together in early 2022. Of course, among the Russian opposition figures who needed to be released, the central figure was Aleksei Navalny.\"\n\n“On the other side, the central figure was Putin's personal assassin, Vadim Krasikov. Four more people were added on both sides. The original list was five-on-five [prisoners to be exchanged],\" he said.\n\nOver the course of 2023, \"both sides expanded [the list] to eight-on-eight. A large part of those eight by the Russian side were the same people who were eventually released -- of course, with the exception of Aleksei Navalny,\" who died in a remote Russian prison before the swap was finalized.\n\nGrozev said Berlin held the most important \"bargaining chip\" for the Kremlin -- Krasikov, who had been sentenced to life in prison for murder.\n\nThe Germans were so angry about Navalny's death that they \"bet it all on one card in the negotiations with Russia,\" Grozev explained.\n\n\"The Germans said: We are giving up the idea [of a prisoner swap] of one-on-one -- a symmetric swap. From now on, for our release of Vadim Krasikov, we want you to release practically all the big names held in Russian prisons -- the Russian opposition figures who have spoken up against the war [in Ukraine].\"\n\n\"That is how the list changed -- six or seven names from the Russian opposition were added. I didn't take part in this last stage [of negotiations], but I know how it developed. The German government was really angry and was ready to drop any deal with Russia. But in the end, they managed to free more people than was actually considered possible at the beginning.\"\n\nBELGRADE -- Serbian police have removed protesters opposed to lithium mining from two railway stations in the capital, Belgrade, where they were blocking train traffic.\n\nRiot police used shields to disperse the protesters at the Prokop and Novi Beograd railway stations at around 5.30 a.m. on August 11, participants told RFE/RL.\n\nThe Internal Affairs Ministry said the railway traffic disrupted by the protests had been restored. The ministry warned that criminal charges will be brought against those who caused the traffic disruption and endangered public safety.\n\nOn August 10, tens of thousands of protesters rallied in the Belgrade city center and then split into two groups that separated and headed to the railway stations. Some of the protesters forced the trains to stop by lying or sitting on the tracks.\n\nThe protesters demanded a halt to Anglo-Australian metals and mining giant Rio Tinto's lithium project in Jadar in western Serbia over fears it could pollute nearby land and water.\n\nProtesters who had spent the night of August 10-11 at the train stations also demanded that authorities release three demonstrators who had been detained by police.\n\nZlatko Kokanovic, one of the organizers of the protests, told RFE/RL the three activists were detained at the Prokop station.\n\n\"Ivan Bjelic, Nikola Ristic, and Jevdenije Dimitrijevic were arrested. They are accused of disobedience and reckless behavior,\" Kokanovic said.\n\nKokanovic on August 10 had vowed more rallies would take place in other cities across Serbia.\n\nInterior Minister Ivica Dacic insisted police had intervened without the use of coercive measures and no one was injured.\n\n\"A total of 14 persons have been brought on suspicion of having committed criminal offenses, three on misdemeanor [charges], and two foreign citizens because of their presence at the protest near important state institutions,\" Dacic said.\n\nSerbian President Aleksandar Vucic said the protests were \"a mockery of democracy\" and added that stopping traffic at railway stations and roads was \"the implementation of violence, will, and terror of the minority against the majority.\"\n\nIn 2022, the Serbian government had rejected the project in the wake of massive public protests amid concerns over its impact on the environment.\n\nBut it reinstated the plan on July 16 this year, days after the Balkan state's Constitutional Court said the government had acted unconstitutionally when it withdrew permits for Rio Tinto.\n\nThree days after the court ruling, a Critical Raw Materials Summit was held in Belgrade, where a memorandum of understanding between the European Union and the Serbian government on a \"strategic partnership\" on sustainable raw materials, battery supply chains, and electric vehicles was signed.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the mining of lithium, a key component in batteries for electric vehicles and mobile devices, is necessary for Europe \"to remain sovereign in a changing world and not be dependent on others.\"\n\nScholz pledged that mining would be carried out \"in compliance with the highest standards of environmental protection, and Germany will help in this.\"\n\nWith reporting by Reuters\n\nKYIV -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy condemned Moscow's latest deadly attack on civilian areas of Kyiv and urged his Western allies to lift restrictions on the use of weapons deep inside of Russia, even as he for the first time indirectly acknowledged his forces' cross-border offensive in Russia’s Kursk region.\n\n\"The Russians have no geographical restrictions on the use of such weapons -- since the first days of the full-scale war, the entire territory of our state has been under constant threat of attack,\" Zelenskiy wrote on X on August 11.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians.

Three others, including a 13-year-old child, were seriously wounded in the attack, it added.\n\nFragments of a missile fell on residential buildings in the Brovary district, neighboring the capital. Kyiv's military administration said the city's air-defense systems had been activated.\n\nFive other regions were being attacked by Russian drones, according to Ukraine's air force.\n\nCities across Ukraine have been regularly hit by Russian air strikes from missiles and drones. There has been growing concern among many Ukrainians in recent days that Moscow might intensify its air raids in response to Kyiv's recent incursion into Russian territory.\n\nIn Russia, Kursk regional Governor Aleksei Smirnov said 13 people had been injured by debris from a downed Ukrainian missile that fell on a residential building during the night. Two of the injured were in serious condition, Smirnov said on August 11.\n\nResidents of the nine-story building were to be evacuated to temporary accommodations, according to Igor Kutsak, mayor of the regional capital, Kursk city.\n\nThe whole city was under an air-raid alert, the official said on Telegram. He posted a photo that showed an apartment building with blown out windows and damaged balconies.\n\nIn the neighboring Voronezh region, Russian authorities claimed that debris from a downed Ukraine-launched drone damaged an administrative building and a utility facility in the provincial capital of the same name. There were no injuries, they added.\n\nRussia’s Defense Ministry said on August 11 that its air-defense units destroyed 16 Ukrainian-lunched drones over the Voronezh region, while 14 drones and four Tochka-U tactical ballistic missiles were downed over the Kursk region.\n\nThree drones were downed over the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, and one drone each was destroyed over the Bryansk and Orlov regions, the ministry said on Telegram.\n\nThe claims cannot be independently verified.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters, AFP, and AP\n\nTens of thousands of protesters opposed to lithium mining in Serbia packed the streets of Belgrade on August 10 and marched to two railway stations where some of them blocked train traffic.\n\nThe protest started at the center of the Serbian capital and then split into two groups that separated and headed to Prokop station and Novi Beograd station. Some of the protesters forced the trains to stop by lying or sitting on the tracks.\n\nThe protesters demanded a halt to Anglo-Australian metals and mining giant Rio Tinto's lithium project in western Serbia over fears it could pollute nearby land and water. They carried the banners saying \"No to the mine, exploitation, eviction\" and \"Rio Tinto march from Serbia\" and chanted, \"You will not dig\" and \"Treason, betrayal!\"\n\n\"There is no turning back, we are defending Serbia,\" said Zlatko Kokanovic, an environmental activist who called on the protesters to continue their action peacefully.\n\nThe protest took place at the invitation of the Alliance of Environmental Organizations of Serbia after the government failed to meet a deadline that opponents to mining set to ban the mining of lithium and the opening of mine in Jadar in the west of the country.\n\n\"It seems that we have been victimized as a future mining colony and landfill. We will not allow that. That is why we are here today to raise our voices, to disagree and to defend survival in our country,\" actress and environmental activist Svetlana Bojkovic told the gathering.\n\nThe Serbian government on July 16 reinstated a plan for a lithium mine in the Jadar region operated by Rio Tinto.\n\nThe Serbian government rejected the project in 2022 after massive environmental protests, but reinstated the plan days after the Balkan state's Constitutional Court said the government had acted unconstitutionally when it withdrew permits for Rio Tinto.\n\nThree days after the decision a Critical Raw Materials Summit was held in Belgrade, where a memorandum of understanding between the European Union and the Serbian government on a \"strategic partnership\" on sustainable raw materials, battery supply chains, and electric vehicles was signed.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the mining of lithium, a key component in batteries for electric vehicles and mobile devices, is necessary for Europe \"to remain sovereign in a changing world and not be dependent on others.\"\n\nScholz pledged that mining would be carried out \"in compliance with the highest standards of environmental protection, and Germany will help in this.\"\n\nWith reporting by Reuters\n\nBelarusian journalist and political activist Andrey Hnyot, who is under house arrest in Belgrade awaiting a final decision on his extradition to Belarus, has been removed from the Interpol wanted list.\n\nThe international police agency's warrant for Hnyot’s arrest was issued at the request of Belarus, which accuses him of tax evasion. Hnyot has denied Minsk's accusations and called them politically motivated.\n\n\"Andrey Hnyot is no longer the subject of Interpol's notification,\" according to a decision of the General Secretariat of Interpol. The decision was forwarded to the media on August 10 by his lawyer, Vadim Drozdov.\n\nHnyot said in a statement to RFE/RL that Interpol informed representatives of the European Union in Serbia that the warrant \"was suspended and the data deleted due to the violation of Articles 2 and 3 of the Interpol Statute.\"\n\nHe said that those provisions refer to politically motivated criminal prosecution.\n\n\"As far as I know, representatives of the EU brought this important information to the attention of the government of Serbia and the judiciary. However, this did not result in my release,\" said Hnyot.\n\nHnyot pointed out that the process of his extradition is ongoing and he is under house arrest until the final decision.\n\n\"That will be my only and last chance to challenge the illegality of my extradition,\" he said, adding that he has not been able to receive adequate medical care and has no source of income to pay rent or buy food and medicine.\n\nHnyot was arrested in October 2023 at the Belgrade airport after arriving from Thailand, where he was in exile.\n\nHe spent seven months in Belgrade Central Prison before being transferred to house arrest on June 5.\n\nThe High Court in Belgrade on June 13 issued a ruling on the extradition that would send him back to Belarus, but it is not yet final.\n\nDrozdov said that Interpol responded to his request to delete Hnyot from its information system with a decision made on August 5.\n\n\"This means that no country will be able to detain him at the request of Belarus,\" said Drozdov in a statement.\n\nHnyot fled Belarus for Thailand in 2020 after criticizing the regime and participating in massive protests that occurred after the presidential election in which authoritarian leader Alyaksandr Lukashenka declared victory.\n\nWestern countries do not recognize the results of those elections, and after violence against demonstrators, the European Union imposed sanctions on Minsk.\n\nBrussels called for Hnyot’s release on June 13 a blistering warning for authorities in EU candidate Serbia, and several media and nongovernmental organizations did the same.\n\nHnyot 's lawyer has informed the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg about the case.\n\nAccording to his statements, the court sent a letter to the authorities in Serbia that it expects that Hnyot will not be immediately extradited after a final decision by the High Court, allowing time for him to address the European Court.\n\nHnyot currently wears an ankle-bracelet monitor and is confinement to a modest, 20-square-meter apartment in Belgrade.\n\nThe prospect of a forced return to a regime that Hnyot describes as \"torture, blood, nightmare\" is motivating.\n\nHe told RFE/RL’s Balkan Service in mid-June in his first interview after his transfer to house arrest that he works \"from morning to night\" on his defense.\n\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has voided the inquiry that led to an Olympic bronze medal for American gymnast Jordan Chiles in the women’s floor exercise.\n\nThe ruling by the CAS on August 10 said the inquiry filed on behalf of Chiles after the final in the event on August 5 came outside the 1-minute time limit allowed by the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG).\n\nChiles was awarded the bronze medal after her inquiry was filed, but the CAS agreed with an appeal filed by the Romanian Gymnastics Federation on behalf of gymnasts Ana Barbosu and Sabrina Maneca-Voinea, who were bumped into fourth and fifth place, respectively, by the judge's decision.\n\n\"The inquiry submitted on behalf of…Chiles in the Final of the women’s Floor exercise was raised after the conclusion of the one-minute deadline…and is determined to be without effect,\" the ruling said.\n\nIt also said the initial score given to Chiles, which initially put her in fifth place, \"shall be reinstated.\"\n\nThe CAS said the final ranking was up to the FIG but said it should “assign the medal(s) in accordance with the above decision.”\n\nThe decision means Barbosu, 18, will receive her country's only medal in the gymnastics competition.\n\n\"I can barely express my emotions. I can't believe it,\" Barbosu told Romanian media. \"When I heard the news, I was afraid it wasn't true, and once I was sure, I hugged my parents and called everyone who had helped me.\"\n\nIt has been an emotional roller coaster for Barbosu, who thought she won bronze on the night of the competition and began celebrating only to leave the floor in tears with Maneca-Voinea after the revision of the scores.\n\nChiles initially was given a score of 13.666 that put her in fifth place behind Maneca-Voinea. U.S. coach Cecile Landi called for an inquiry, and after a review, judges boosted Chiles’s total by 0.1. That was enough to leapfrog Barbosu and Maneca-Voinea for bronze.\n\nThe Romanian Gymnastics Federation welcomed the decision and congratulated its two gymnasts.\n\n\"We laugh with one eye, we cry with one,\" it said on Facebook. \"Following this decision, Ana Maria Barbosu gets the bronze medal while Sabrina Maneca-Voinea ends the competition on the 4th place.\"\n\nUSA Gymnastics said in a statement it is “devastated” by the ruling.\n\n\"The inquiry into the Difficulty Value of Jordan Chiles' floor exercise routine was filed in good faith and, we believed, in accordance with FIG rules to ensure accurate scoring,\" the organization said.\n\nThe Belarusian Foreign Ministry on August 10 summoned the Ukrainian charge d'affaires over alleged airspace violations after authoritarian leader Alyaksandr Lukashenka claimed Ukrainian drones had flown over the country's border with Ukraine.\n\n\"The Belarusian side demanded that comprehensive measures be taken to rule out any such future incidents in the future which could lead to further escalation of the situation in the region,\" TASS quoted the ministry's press service as saying.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians.

Ukraine and Belarus share a nearly 1,100-kilometer border.\n\nLukashenka's remarks come amid a Ukrainian incursion inside Russia. The cross-border action in Russia's Kursk region has been described as the biggest attack on Russian soil since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his country's unprovoked, full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nUkraine has so far not commented on Lukashenka's remarks.\n\nLukashenka said \"about a dozen\" drones had violated Belarusian airspace in the eastern Mogilev region bordering Russia on August 9.\n\nLukashenka said others were later destroyed near the Russian city of Yaroslavl. Earlier on August 10, the Russian Defense Ministry said Russian forces had intercepted six drones in the Yaroslavl region.\n\nLater, Viktar Khrenin, Belarus's defense minister, said Lukashenka had ordered him to reinforce Belarus's border with Ukraine.\n\n\"Considering the situation in Ukraine and in the Kursk region of Russia, the commander in chief of the armed forces has given orders to reinforce troops in the Gomel and Mazyr tactical areas in order to respond to such provocations,\" Khrenin said.\n\n\"Special operations forces, ground troops, and rocket forces, including Polonez and Iskander systems, have been tasked with deploying to the designated areas.\"\n\nHe said Belarus regarded the violation of its airspace as a provocation and \"was ready to respond.\"\n\nDuring his entire imprisonment in Russia, Andrei Pivovarov yearned for one thing: freedom.\n\n\"To be released. You always count the days, hours, months. The only [desire] is to break free. Any person, politically oriented or not, sitting in prison, wants to be free,\" Pivovarov told Current Time.\n\nPivovarov, 42, was part of the biggest prisoner exchange between the West and Russia since the Cold War.\n\nIn the exchange on August 1, Russia got back eight prisoners held in the West, including a member of its FSB security service convicted of murder in Germany, and 16 people were released from Russian and Belarusian jails. They included Pivovarov, dissidents Vladimir Kara-Murza and Ilya Yashin, and U.S. citizens Evan Gershkovich, Paul Whelan, and RFE/RL journalist Alsu Kurmasheva.\n\nPivovarov, the former executive director of the now-defunct pro-democracy Open Russia movement, was detained in May 2021 after being taken off a Warsaw-bound plane just before takeoff from St. Petersburg and sentenced to four years in prison in July 2022 on a charge of heading an \"undesirable organization.\"\n\nThe \"undesirable organization\" law, adopted in 2015, was part of a series of regulations pushed by the Kremlin that squeezed many nonprofit and nongovernmental organizations that received funding from foreign sources, mainly from Europe and the United States.\n\nAfter his trial in Krasnodar, the St. Petersburg native was convicted and sentenced in July 2022, when Russia's full-scale war and Russian President Vladimir Putin's intensified crackdown on dissent were in full swing.\n\nFrom January 2023, Pivovarov was held in isolation at Penal Colony No. 7 in Russia's Karelia region.\n\nSince his release and transfer to Germany, Pivovarov has given numerous interviews but is hoping to find time now to rest and spend time with his family.\n\n\"I would like to exhale. Plus, during all this time I was deprived of the opportunity to communicate with my son, so I would really like to meet him, spend time with him,\" Pivovarov told Current Time, adding he has no plans to abandon his \"political work.\"\n\nPivovarov admitted that voicing opposition to Putin's regime is easier from abroad but with possible drawbacks.\n\n\"When you are in Russia, any unification, any coordination is automatically a criminal offense. At the same time, having a platform abroad, where we are now, on the one hand, to be honest, diminishes the weight of our words, because it is easy to say something while sitting outside in the sun and knowing that no policeman is coming for you,\" Pivovarov explained. \"On the other hand, this allows us to say more than what people in Russia can afford.\"\n\nBreathing life into Russia's opposition, largely silenced by Putin's repression and infighting, will be a formidable task, admitted Pivovarov, saying the goal should be \"not to unite but to establish a dialogue, contact.\"\n\n\"Of course, there will still be disputes,\" he said.\n\nPivovarov was also asked about comments he made at a Bonn press conference on August 2, when he appeared to suggest that Western sanctions against Russia were unfairly impacting ordinary Russians, triggering some criticism, especially among Ukrainians.\n\n\"There was no phrase about the unfairness of sanctions. I don't remember all the words verbatim, but there was no phrase about the unfairness of sanctions. Sanctions are effective, and they work. I'm talking about, for example, a housewife -- a stupid example -- but it seems typical to me. And she has, let's say, a small child, and she cooks at home. So that she has the opportunity to buy at least some more or less normal products, so that her small everyday world becomes a little simpler,\" Pivovarov offered.\n\nPivovarov said Russian opponents of Putin shared common goals with Ukrainians.\n\n\"Our goals are the same. We want to work together to ensure that the war ends, that the regime in Russia changes, and that, ultimately, Putin ends up in the dock. This is our main goal,\" he said. \"We just look at this from the perspective of Russian society, and in this regard we can be more useful.\"\n\nRussia has imposed what it called anti-terror measures in Kursk, the site of a Ukrainian military incursion, and two nearby regions as well as Bryansk and Belgorod.\n\nThe announcement was made early on August 10 by the National Anti-Terrorism Committee. In a statement, it said the decision had been made by Aleksandr Bortnikov, head of the FSB intelligence service, in response to Ukraine's \"unprecedented attempt to destabilize the situation in a series of regions.\"\n\nThe committee said the measures included the possible evacuation of residents, limits on transport, beefed-up security around sensitive sites, and wire taps.\n\nRussian media reported on August 10 that more than 76,000 people have been evacuated from border areas in the Kursk region since Ukraine launched the surprise cross-border offensive on August 6. TASS quoted Artem Sharov, an official from the regional Emergencies Ministry, as saying that those evacuated \"have been temporarily relocated to safe places.\"\n\nDozens of temporary accommodation facilities have been set up in Kursk and other regions, Sharov told journalists, according to TASS.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said on August 10 that fighting was continuing region and that the army has conducted air strikes against Ukrainian forces.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians.

The unverified images show completely destroyed buildings and evidence of a large fire. Two craters -- possibly the result of missile or drone strikes -- are also visible.\n\nThe head of the UN's nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has urged Ukraine and Russia to show restraint in the fighting in the Kursk region, the site of one of Russia's largest nuclear power stations.\n\n\"At this juncture, I would like to appeal to all sides to exercise maximum restraint in order to avoid a nuclear accident with the potential for serious radiological consequences,\" Grossi said in a statement.\n\nRussia's diplomatic mission in Vienna, quoted by Russian news agencies, said it had told the International Agency for Atomic Energy (IAEA) that fragments had been found at the station, possibly from downed missiles, but there was no evidence of any direct attack on the facility.\n\nElsewhere, unconfirmed reports spoke of a Russian column having been destroyed in the Kursk region with many casualties. Video circulating on social media showed what appeared to be many burned-out military transport vehicles on the side of a road in or near the town of Rylsk.\n\nTwo ethnic Armenians in Kursk who spoke with RFE/RL's Armenian Service by phone said the Russian authorities had banned large gatherings and mass events in the region through August 11.\n\n\"It can be said that we are at war now,\" said one of the men, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nHe said Ukrainian troops had captured two towns that are 60 to 70 kilometers away from the city of Kursk in addition to the Gazprom facility.\n\nUkrainian special forces conducted an amphibious raid on the Russian-occupied Kinburn Spit in the Black Sea, killing about 30 Russian soldiers and destroying six armored vehicles, Ukraine's military intelligence said on August 9.\n\nRussian forces have occupied the Kinburn Spit, which juts into the Black Sea northwest of Crimea, since the start of Moscow's full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nMoscow's military vantage point on the spit is seen as one of the reasons why Ukraine cannot reopen its ports of Mykolayiv and Kherson and export goods from them via its Black Sea shipping corridor.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians.

The department said the charges against him included export-control violations, smuggling, wire fraud, and money laundering.\n\nPetrov's lawyer declined to comment on the numerous charges brought against his client, which collectively carry a potential penalty of over 150 years in prison, according to AP.\n\nPetrov was arrested in Cyprus at the request of the United States and was extradited on August 8.\n\n\"Our charges allege that, after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the defendant and his co-conspirators formed an elaborate tech-trafficking syndicate to supply microelectronics to Russia's military-industrial complex,\" said Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen of the Justice Department’s National Security Division.\n\nU.S. Attorney Damian Williams added in the statement that Petrov concealed where he was sending the electronics and knew that shipping them violated U.S. export controls relating to Russia.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said the extradition reflected the Justice Department's determination to cut Russia off from the Western technologies that fuel the Russian military.\n\nCourt documents quoted in the statement say Petrov worked for LLC Electrocom VPK, a Russia-based supplier of critical electronics components for manufacturers supplying weaponry and other equipment to the Russian military. Petrov and two co-conspirators, who are identified only as Russian nationals also working for Electrocom, operated an illicit procurement network in Russia and elsewhere overseas.\n\n\"They fraudulently procured from U.S. distributors large quantities of microelectronics subject to U.S. export controls on behalf of Electrocom,\" the Justice Department said.\n\nThey used shell companies and other deceptive means to conceal that the electronics components were destined for Russia, the department said. The technology they procured has significant military applications, including in Russian guided missiles, drones, and electronic-warfare and communications devices, it added.\n\nAuthorities said Petrov falsely claimed that he was purchasing the items for fire-security systems and other commercial uses for companies in Cyprus and countries other than Russia.\n\nWith reporting by AP\n\nJailed Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi and other women inmates in Tehran's Evin prison were injured earlier this week in clashes that erupted after a spate of executions, Mohammadi’s family says.\n\nMohammadi’s husband, Taghi Rahmani, said Mohammadi suffered breathing problems and severe chest pain after being punched in the chest and was transferred to the prison's clinic.\n\nRahmani, who spoke by phone to RFE/RL from Paris, said several women came under attack by guards during the clashes on August 6. Mohammadi was hit in her chest, and her arm was bruised, he said.\n\nThe injured women were later taken to the prison clinic for treatment and were returned to their ward.\n\nRahmani said the news agency of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps claimed the clash was a riot, but he said it should be made clear that it was a protest in which the women in Evin prison chanted in the prison yard against the death penalty.\n\nHe added that he and the rest of Mohammadi’s family were worried about her health especially because she was hit in the chest. Mohammadi had surgery for blocked arteries in 2022.\n\nRahmani added that Mohammadi, who is renowned as a staunch advocate for the Women, Life, Freedom movement, cannot contact her sister in Iran and she hasn’t been allowed to contact her children for 2 1/2 years. She also has had no contact with her lawyer.\n\n\"These restrictions make all of us worried about her situation in that ward where other women are also facing difficult conditions,\" Rahmani told RFE/RL.\n\nBefore Rahmani spoke with RFE/RL, Mohammadi's family issued a statement about the clash on August 8. It said several women who stood in front of the security forces were severely beaten.\n\nIt said the women in Evin prison had been actively protesting against executions in Iran, and following the execution of Reza Rasaei, several prisoners gathered in the prison yard to voice their dissent, chanting slogans against the death penalty.\n\nOne woman suffered a nervous breakdown and passed out and another prisoner also fainted from the emotional strain, the statement said, adding that Mohammadi and several other prisoners protested against the locked doors that were preventing the critically ill inmates from being taken to the prison clinic.\n\nIranian authorities acknowledged a confrontation took place on August 6 but blamed Mohammadi for a \"provocation\" and denied any of the prisoners had been beaten.\n\nTwo prisoners \"had heart palpitations due to the stress,\" but medical examinations determined that their general condition \"is favorable,\" Iran's prison administration said in a statement, according to the Tasnim news agency.\n\nMohammadi, 52, has been campaigning for human rights in Iran for decades and has been in and out of prison for the last 20 years. She has been convicted five times since March 2021 and is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence for \"spreading propaganda\" against the Islamic republic.\n\nThe executions that took place this week drew outrage from rights groups. The Norway-based Iran Human Rights group said 29 people were executed at two prisons in the Tehran satellite city of Karaj on August 7 alone.\n\nRasaei, 34, was the 10th man executed by Iran in connection with the \"Women, Life, Freedom\" protests that erupted after the death of a woman in police custody. The Iranian judiciary said Rasaei was executed on August 6.\n\nWith reporting by AFP\n\nThe Qonaev City Court in Kazakhstan's southeast said on August 9 that businessman Muratkhan Toqmadi, who was sentenced in 2018 to a lengthy prison term for his alleged involvement in the killing of a banker, has been granted early release.\n\nKazakh media reports quoted sources on August 9 as saying that Toqmadi was expected to be released on August 10 -- the day a court decision made in late July will come into force.\n\nThe announcement came almost 2 1/2 years after Toqmadi called on President Qasym-Zhomart Toqaev to review his case after he retracted his testimony against Mukhtar Ablyazov, a fugitive outspoken critic of Kazakhstan's government and former banker.\n\nIn a letter made public in March 2022, Toqmadi said he confessed to the killing of Erzhan Tatishev on a hunting trip in 2004 and falsely testified in 2018 that he killed Tatishev at the behest of Ablyazov because he was tortured and faced psychological pressure imposed on him by the National Security Committee.\n\nTatishev at the time was the head of TuranAlem bank, which was later renamed BTA. After Tatishev's death, which was ruled an accident at the time, Ablyazov became the bank's chief. He has been living abroad since 2009.\n\nIt remains unclear if Toqmadi was granted an early release because he had served a significant part of his term and used his right to apply for early release or because his case was revised.\n\nToqmadi’s letter to Toqaev came after deadly unrest in January that resulted in the removal of former Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbaev and his clan from the political scene.\n\nIn February 2018, Toqmadi, who was initially sentenced in 2017 to three years in prison for extortion and illegal firearms possession, entered a guilty plea at the murder trial, which ended with him being sentenced to 10 1/2 years in prison.\n\nIn November that year, Ablyazov was tried in absentia, convicted of murder based on Toqmadi's testimony, and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nIn a separate trial in absentia that ended in 2017, Ablyazov was convicted of embezzlement, abuse of office, and organizing a criminal group and sentenced to 20 years in prison.\n\nAblyazov has denied all the charges, saying they are politically motivated.\n\nWith reporting by KazTAG, Tengrinews, and Aq Zhaiyq"
