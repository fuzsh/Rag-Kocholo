It plays a lot of diverse kinds of music, has several \"specialty\" shows that are good, and plays a lot of new stuff I've never heard before . While run by students, they either come in with, or learn, an appreciation for all sorts of music - you can hear Black Flag, Dave Brubeck, and Lefty Frizzell all in the same day, sometimes the same hour.\n\nSo - on to the reason for my question: please recommend to me, and if possible, provide a streaming link to, _your_ favorite independent and/or college streaming radio station(s). I would prefer, for college stations, that it be student-run with a faculty advisor, rather than run with university employees, but that's a \"nice to have\" not a \"have to have\" requirement.\n\nAbout Ask MetaFilter\n\nAsk MetaFilter is a question and answer site that covers nearly any question on earth, where members help each other solve problems.
