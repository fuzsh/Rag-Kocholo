        "text": "In a cinder-block classroom at the edge of Biola University's manicured campus in a Los Angeles suburb, Craig Detweiler was blasting the music of Nick Cave at his Intro to Mass Media class. Two dozen students were arranged in a horseshoe of swivel chairs, and they were looking blankly at a photo of Cave, a sullen goth-rocker, which Detweiler's laptop was projecting onto a pull-down screen.\n\nIntro to Mass Media is a required class for every mass-communications major at Biola. Each week of the course is devoted to a different type of media. This week, in late March, was music. Lesson 1, on Monday, was the history of music; Lesson 2, today's class, focused on contemporary music.\n\n\"Soooo . . . any Nick Cave fans?\" Detweiler asked, pacing the room. No one answered.\n\nDetweiler has spiky silver hair and exuberant blue eyes, and he was wearing a Hawaiian shirt and trendy shoes. He brings a kind of affable sarcasm to a complicated job; he is the chairman of a mass-media department at a university that until 1977 banned all films. \"This stuff is pretty hard and dark,\" he offered, as Cave growled and howled through the speakers of his laptop. \"But did you know that Nick Cave wrote an introduction to the Gospel of Mark for a special edition of the Bible published in the U.K.? What do we think of that?\" Students spun their chairs and gnawed pen tops.\n\nLike a lot of Christian colleges in the United States, Biola has in recent years made serious efforts to compete academically with secular and more mainstream religiously affiliated colleges. That hasn't meant a reduced emphasis on religious teachings. If anything, the school has intensified its commitment to cultivating devout Christians. But it does mean that the school has expanded its curriculum in areas of study like psychology, bioethics and popular culture, and that it is encouraging a new level of engagement with the secular world. Detweiler, a screenwriter who is something of a maverick on campus and in the evangelical Christian community, is on the front lines of that effort at Biola."
