        "text": "Robin Campillo follows his previous 120 BPM with this nostalgic look back to the early 1970’s when his family was stationed in Madagascar. Following a ten year old boy who is obsessed with comics, makes a new friend and tries to sort out what is going on with the adults. We see the world and the events surrounding his family through his eyes.\n\nThis is a nice memory play of a film. While there is a through line on some level this is more a series of set pieces connected together over time. It’s a film that plays better in a way when you see it a second time as you catch little bits from early in the film that you didn’t know were important later. I discovered this when I went back to check something I thought I missed and saw a couple of things early on that enriched later events.\n\nYou will forgive me if I don’t say a great deal, I am still pondering the film after seeing the film a while ago. I find my reaction is not so much wanting to discuss the film, but press it into people’s hands and just have people see it for themselves.\n\nIt’s really nice film that’s worth your time.\n\nI'm guessing the title confuses you. What exactly is a chessboxer? It's a person who participates in the mixed sport of chessboxing where after a round of fighting the fighters play chess before fighting again... It is an actual sport and it requires fighter be as mentally sharp as they are physically.\n\nIt is also the name of a short film which heralds the arrival of director writer director Albin Pepe as a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe film CHESSBOXER is the story of a chessboxer who wins a big match and promptly gets into trouble by slugging his opponent who said he cheated. On the outs, he has to fight his way back to respectability.\n\nShot in black and white, the film is a moody throwback to the boxing films of old but with a modern sensibility. It’s a film that feels classic despite being modern.\n\nPepe kills it.\n\nThis is a perfectly made film. Pepe is a genius. Using the deep black and whites he hides the lack of a large cast in the boxing scenes by having every question disappear in the dark. He also uses the monochromatic images to heighten emotion. Unsurprisingly his editing is masterful. The linking of shots and sequences shows a sense of dramatic construction that most filmmakers never understand. Everything comes together in a pitch perfect film.\n\nForgive me for stumbling over my words about the technical aspects of the film, I’m trying to be brief.\n\nThe technical aspects of the film aside, the film moves us. Everyone involved sells their roles so we are invested in their lives. This is a film that has one of the best casts that I’ve run across this year.\n\nI genuinely love this film- to the point I’m blathering nonsense. (That is a rave)\n\nHighly recommended After you see this you are going to be like me and want to see what Albin Pepe does next.\n\nAfter the end of the world a man tries to reckon with his past and future as his dead wife returns and weird things begin to happen.\n\nThis is going to be a tough film to write on. I say that because there is a point where there is a shift and what you thought at the start is found not to be so much true anymore. This is a film where what you know changes everything that has gone before, and as such I can’t say too much because too few have seen it.\n\nThe one thing that I will say is that the real key to how you like this film will depend upon what you think of Graham Skippers performance. Skipper is on screen pretty much the entire time and if he isn’t in the frame he is just outside it. It’s a performance that, for me, walked the fine line between being good and being over the top. My feeling is that much of it would have been better on stage where some of his bigness would have not seemed over powering because it wasn’t in a close up.\n\nIf you like twisty genre films this is worth a look\n\nKind of a found footage film has a filmmaker and his girlfriend going to see her family and running into a stranger along the way and everyone films each other as the past gets kicked up.\n\nI’m still trying to sort out what I feel about this film. It’s a kind of sort of found footage film of the sort I don’t like (where people film things no one would film) and part of it is a film that uses the conceit to make things more real. It’s a film where the performances drift depending upon the type of scene it is (drama, thriller, ect). It’s a film that is trying to examine relationships and our pasts and at the same time be a scary movie.\n\nIt's a film that wonderfully is trying to juggle a bucketful of balls of style and themes – and it manages to keep many of them in the air while at the same time it’s letting a bunch of them crash. It’s a film that works and doesn’t but always remains intriguing.\n\nFrankly OLD WOUNDS is a film I need to revisit before I can really know what I think.\n\nMy uncertainty aside there is enough going on here that it’s worth a look for the curious film fan.\n\nThe story of the making of CALIGULA is legendary. From battles behind the scenes, to censorship trouble there is enough going on to fill several books or a long miniseries. The films was written by novelist Gore Vidal who was so unhappy with what was being done he wanted his name removed. Tinto Brass the director did what he could, but was removed by producer Bob Guccione who chopped the hell out of the film and added a lot of graphic sex. It made a mint and so many people were curious that the film was recut into an R rated version.\n\nIn whatever cut you only saw a pale shadow of what Gore Vidal wrote and what the actors were doing. Recently filmmaker Thomas Negovan went back to the original footage and using Gore Vidal's script as guide assembled the almost 100 hours of alternate takes into a new version of CALIGULA what is minus anything the Guccione shot (there is graphic sex, but no penetration)\n\nI'm a fan of the film. I've been in awe of the film since I first saw the R rated version in a theater four decades ago. My feelings are mixed up in the spectacle and the audacity of what is on screen. That the film was \"Hollywood's\" (albeit via an inde producer) attempt at integrating hardcore sex makes more sense when you look at the time than it does now, when you consider some of the serious porn films that were being made in the late 70's (see here for a brief discussion). The problem of course was that the graphic sex stopped the film dead and resulted in a ton of material being chucked out.\n\nLike Negovan I always wondered what the film would have been like had it not been fought over and just a been the historical epic most people thought they were making. Having seen the ULTIMATE CUT, I now know and I am deeply impressed.\n\nFrankly had this version been released 45 years ago the film would have been hailed as very good, and very adult epic. It's not for the squeamish or the prudish (there hardcore is gone but there is a lot implied). I am also certain that while the film would have developed a cult following, it would have been largely forgotten like so many films of the period. That isn't a knock on the film but a statement of truth.\n\nThe truth is that this restored version of the rise of Caligula is a revelation. It's a film that impresses with the spectacle but also with the depth of characters and the themes. Watching the full film I was struck by how much the film has to say about life today. Listening to Peter O'Toole's Tiberius rant about plots and how society is made it clear that he is a twin of a certain ex-president , demagogue and snake oil salesman. The portrait of cutthroat politics is what we are seeing in America now. One completely understands why John Gielgud's character kills himself rather than stay in the cesspool.\n\nI know why Malcolm McDowell and the others would frequently speak of the lost masterpiece they thought they were making.\n\nIs it that masterpiece? Probably not, but it is light years ahead of what was originally released. It's probably damn close to being that masterpiece and it's definitely worth seeing and re-evaluating.\n\nFrankly if I was to say that there is any flaw in this film it's in that it only really uses alternate takes. While I know there are reasons for it, a couple of sequences seem less emotional, the death of the drunk soldier at the start and the death Caligula's son, for example, are less affecting.\n\nHonestly if you love movies you need to see this, more so if you were either in love with this film or merely liked it. This cut will knock your socks off.\n\nA filmmaker with a questionable grip on reality has his horror films start to intrude into his life.\n\nI really didn't like this film much. The problem is that Lincoln, the main character is more than bit odd. He is a guy who is a bit too in his own head and his own world which makes the intrusion of his fantasy world into his reality making perfect sense. He's so disconnected from reality that everything that follows is more or less a foregone conclusion.\n\nThe problem of having a main character who is already nuts when the film starts rarely works. The problem first became noticeable to me was in the film FALLING DOWN. The Michael Douglas' character was billed as being a regular guy, but the truth was he wasn't wrapped too tight going in. He was in fact already broken as the film started. While Lincoln isn't that broken he is close and it's clear there is a problem. When we get films like this I find it hard to connect because it isn't watch a regular person, it's instead gawking at a person breaking apart.\n\nI'd take a pass but I have read some reviews that loved this. If you do see this stay past the first ten minutes, the film opens with scenes from Lincoln's film and it's not very good, however what follows is worth trying.\n\nTHE BUILDOUT is a one of a kind.\n\nThe film is the story of two friends dealing with a shared grief who decide to bike through the desert before one of them goes to join a religious order… but in actuality it isn’t and it’s so much more. The film is more a mental and psychic journey that mirrors the journey of the women on screen.\n\nI am going to assume that when you watch THE BUILDOUT you are going to sit and give yourself over to the film. I’m going to hope that you see it in a darkened theater or room with no distractions. I say that because the film is very deliberately put together. The POV shift from objective to subjective, from standard cinematic presentation to found footage and back again. This is a trip of a film that you need to go on from start to finish with out taking any side breaks or looking away.\n\nI’m not going to say a lot about the film not because it’s bad, but because while the film does ponder friendship, loss and moving on, as well as several other themes and subjects (religion, aliens), I found the one discussion I had about the film ended up not just discussing the film and it’s topics but our own feelings and our own lives. The discussions focused on how the film kicked up feelings and made us fell in regard to our own lives. The discussion was a give and take and not just a statement of “fact”. Because of this I’m not going to “review” the film but point you to it. You need to see it and experience it and discuss it and how it effects you with other people who’ve seen it.\n\nFilms like THE BUILDOUT are why cinema is a social pursuit.\n\nHighly recommended\n\nI WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU ALONE is one of the best films at Popcorn Frights and one of the great discoveries of 2024. A small scale, seemingly run of the mill horror film which ups the chills by degrees as it goes.\n\nThe plot has Richard getting out of prison. He is gets what he thinks is a cushy care taker job, but is something else entirely. His job is to stay in houses where people died and perform ceremonies that will cleanse the house of evil spirits. It doesn’t help that his boss is a bit crazy and that there is witch tree in the back with a witch supposedly buried under it…it all goes wrong as he is locked into the house.\n\nIt gets worse.\n\nWatching the film I was just kind of going along thinking this was just going to be the run of the mill sort of thing, and then it started to go side ways and I started muttering to no one in particular. “That’s messed up” was definitely said a couple of times.\n\nBrilliantly made the film turns things on their head by having a lot of the scary stuff in the day light. The monsters are not in the dark hidden by shadows but right there in front of us. It makes the shadows even more scary. Frankly there are images in this film which will haunt my dreams (the ones that made me mutter “that’s messed up”\n\nIf you love horror films you have to see this. Even if you don’t love it like I do I think you will enjoy that joyous fact it isn’t a retread of every other horror film out there.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nI need to be up front regarding my viewing of ELECTRIC CHILD. My viewing of the film, which has to do with AI, came after seeing 8 to 10 films dealing with AI and similar themes since June. Normally I can divorce myself from the subject matter and take each film on its own, but I know that I was thinking about how the film echoed other recent films.\n\nThe plot of the film has a couple welcoming their first child into the world. As they celebrate the joyous occasion, they are informed that because of a genetic defect their baby will probably not survive very long. Uncertain as to what to so the husband begins to wonder if the AI program that his is working on may provide a way of keeping the child alive in some form.\n\nMoody film seeks to explore the various ins and outs of what dealing with an AI means. Is AI a living thing?\n\nBecause of the recent viewing of AI related material, I find it hard to actually discuss how the film handles the subject matter. Some bits are better than similar bits in other films, some bits are not as good. Because it would end up in a word soup, I’m going to stay away from discussing that aspect.\n\nI will however speak about it as a drama. As a drama the film is okay. For me the way the film uses dialog, the dialog seems to be used to give specific information and not so much to give emotional information or build character, which to my eyes seemed to be coming visually from the characters behaviors and expressions. While we do get to know the characters to some degree, a great deal is left unsaid. In a weird way I kept wanting to get a sense of life outside of what we are seeing. Everyone seems to be existing in a limited and very controlled world. As a result, I felt like I was watching people in a glass box, not watching people before me.\n\nIt's not bad but it wasn’t compelling.\n\nVIDEOTEKA frustrates me.\n\nThis is a beautifully made anthology horror film with mood and atmosphere to burn that doesn’t manage to stick any of the four tales landings.\n\nThe premise of the film is that a robbery goes down and one of the robbers breaks into an abanfoned old school VHS video store to hide out. He decides to put on a tape to pass the time. He finished the film and then tries to leave only to find a car has been parked against the door to the shop. He then watches another film and then another.\n\nThe first film (BALANAR) concern a man during medieval times calling on the gods, the second (DUBAI) concerns a soccer player and youth, and the third involves a prophecy…. And I apologize for not being more detailed on the third film (THE PROPHECIES OF KUPRES) because my interest started to wane just about the time the film started. It waned because I didn’t want to get invested in a story that wouldn’t end.\n\nThe problem with all of VIDEOTEKA is that a great deal isn’t said. Everything is geared toward mood and the occasional shock. There isn’t a great deal put into the actual stories with the result that all of them get to a certain point and just stop. Well they end, but the ending leaves you wondering “why are you ending here?” None of the endings felt like endings, or at least satisfying ones. Even the ending of the wrap around story is disappointing. (I want to tell you what is but I can’t take away the way the ending will make you scream WTF)\n\nI was so locked and loaded for the film during the first videotape. The film builds and builds toward something. The girl with white eyes screams are chilling….and then the film stops. And so does the momentum of the film. After that I could feel the progression play over and over again in the remaining two tapes and the wrap around. Worse you see turns that make no sense- the whole car in front of the video store door being the most glaring.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, there is some great stuff here, the stories all work up to a certain point, the problem none of them conclude satisfyingly.\n\nWhile things on screen don’t make a lot of sense, the release plans for the film are a bit of a head scratcher as well. Before I realized that the film is making a world premiere at Popcorn Frights I went searching for information on the film, particular for a clue that I missed something with the endings of the tales. What I discovered is that there are two versions of the film, one for the local audience and one for the international one. The local version removes the first story, which really shocks me because that is the best of the bunch- it may not end well but it throws up some absolutely chilling images- some of which have truly haunted my dreams since I saw the film.(The girl with white eyes is the reason to see this film).\n\nShould you see the film?\n\nIf you can accept that this is a flawed film with some wonderful pieces I think you should give it a go. Just understand you are going to have issues with it, but at the same time bits of it are going to stay with you no matter how hard you try to forget them.\n\nSmall scale thriller concerns a young man on an outing with friends who begins to annoy his buddies by insiting that he is seeing a zombie just outside the window. They don’t see it of course.\n\nWhat is going on is not what it appears or is it going to go how you think it will. What is happening is something else and as a result this is a nice little palette cleanse of film from your typical horror stuff. When I saw this it was after literally three festivals of heavy genre choices. I didn’t want a film that followed the well worn paths of horror and suspense, so when I started this gem of a film and found it taking it’s own path I was delighted. I knew I was going to see something where I wasn’t going to have figured it all out ten minutes in.\n\nWatching this at home I paused the film went to get some popcorn and then came back and curled up on the couch,.\n\nIs THERE A ZOMBIE OUTSIDE going to shake the pillars of heaven? No. But it will entertain, which having slogged through too many weak horror/thrillers of the last few weeks is more than enough to make me recommend this."
