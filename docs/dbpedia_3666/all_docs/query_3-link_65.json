        "text": "CENTER, Texas (KTRE) - Homeowner John Childress is all smiles Wednesday, with a roof on his home and work being done to repair damages.\n\nCoincidentally, he had that same smile a month ago, even though the circumstances were a lot different.\n\n“Initially it was overwhelming, with the amount of damage that was done,” said Childress.\n\nA tornado left John and his wife Sheila’s home with their second-floor roof missing, their barn destroyed and debris scattered across their land.\n\nA month later, John says things look better than they used to.\n\n“With the help of our church friends and community friends, we’re making steady day by day progress,” said John.\n\nJohn says so far they’ve dried out the second story roof, and due to heavy rain that came after Beryl, they’re working to dry out moisture from the middle part of the home.\n\n“That didn’t help us, but it also highlighted some other areas that we didn’t initially know that we had damage to,” said John.\n\nLike a broken ridge beam on top of the garage and two to three cracked rafters.\n\nPower was restored to parts of the home a week after the storm, but due to moisture mitigation, the Childress’s are living in a trailer on the property.\n\n“It’s different, but it’s doable,” said John.\n\nAs for the barn, John says it’s a total loss.\n\nWhile their insurance has been helping them recover as much as possible, John said God has played the biggest role.\n\n“I might not be sitting here in front of you today talking with you. I have to give him that credit and say, ‘where do you lead me next?’” said John.\n\nJohn said the home may not be fully livable for three to six months, but he and his wife are prepared to stick it out."
