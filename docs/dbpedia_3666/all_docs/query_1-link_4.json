        "text": "EVERYDAY MIRACLES follows a young faith healer, who he tries to escape his past and start over on his own. With a strong Christian worldview, EVERYDAY MIRACLES had the potential to be something great with some good acting, but it falls short due to a poorly paced script and some awkward serious moments.\n\nThe movie opens with a young man named Cotton as he walks, drunk, down a deserted road while trying to find a ride. Cut to later that night. A storm, and a loud noise coming from the barn outside, wakes up young Emily and her father, Clay. Clay makes his way outside to see what the ruckus is about and finds Cotton passed out in his barn.\n\nThe next morning arrives, and Cotton and isn’t sure where he is. Cotton heads outside and meets Clay and Emily. Clay gives Cotton some work around the farm for the day. However, before getting to work, Cotton heads up to the house to get some food from Max, the young woman who comes to help Clay cook and clean. While working later that day, Emily comes to talk to Cotton and fills him in on her and her father’s life, and how her mother and older brother died in a car accident.\n\nAt the end of the day, Cotton asks Clay if he could continue to work for him. Clay lays some ground rules and also tells Cotton he can stay on the cot in the barn, and Cotton accepts. The next day, Clay and Emily head to church, and Cotton stays back at first. However, Clay spots Cotton outside the church listening in during the service. While working on the farm later that day, Cotton performs what looks like a miracle when he calms a horse that’s having a bad day.\n\nA few days later, a man shows up to the farm to leave a flyer for a revival that’s taking place nearby. Cotton immediately knows that his past has caught up with him and fills Clay in on his life before the farm.\n\nCotton explains that his family holds revivals and that his father was a preacher. However, his father passed away, and it was then just Cotton, his mother and his younger sister. Cotton then explains how his mother is convinced that Cotton has the gift of healing people and exploited that gift to earn money for the family. That’s when Cotton ran away.\n\nNow that Cotton’s mother has found him, he’ll have to confront the past he left behind while finding a way to continue to live the new life he’s found for himself.\n\nEVERYDAY MIRACLES has veteran actors that could have helped the movie shine. Gary Cole does a great job as one of the main characters, but his performance wasn’t enough to keep the movie afloat. Sadly, the script moves way too quickly, and most of the moments meant to be serious came out being more cringeworthy and awkward than inspirational.\n\nThat said, EVERYDAY MIRACLES has a strong Christian worldview with themes of forgiveness and faith at the forefront. Church scenes, revivals and depictions of prayer are seen throughout the movie. Marriage and taking care of others is also extolled. MOVIEGUIDE® advises caution for younger children because of some violence in EVERYDAY MIRACLES."
