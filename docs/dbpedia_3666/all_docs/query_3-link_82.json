The creation story\n\nOrigin\n\nThe Old Testament\n\nStory\n\nHave you ever wondered how this beautiful universe came into being? This creation story is what you need to look back in time. In the beginning, there was nothing. There was no time, no light, no darkness – nothing existed but God.\n\nThen God decided to bring forth his power. On the first day, God created the heavens and earth. But the earth had no form. So God said ‘let there be light.’ And there was light! And that is how night and day were born.\n\nOn the second day, God created all the oceans, lakes, and rivers.\n\nOn the third day, God commanded dry land to appear on earth. Soon, God created all the beautiful trees and plants you see today.\n\nThen came the fourth day! God filled the sky with the sun, the moon and countless stars.\n\nBut there was more to come!\n\nOn the fifth day, God breathed his life into the waters and created the sea creatures. He also created all the beautiful birds on the fifth day.\n\nNext, God called forth living beings – animals of all shapes and sizes – to fill the earth on the sixth day. Reptiles, insects, and animals now called earth their home. God also created the first humans – Adam and Even – on the sixth day of creation.\n\nNow that the earth was ready and buzzing with life, God declared the seventh day as the day of rest! This is a perfect old testament bible stories for children.\n\nLesson\n\nGod is the creator of everything we see.\n\n2. The story of Adam and Eve\n\nOrigin\n\nThe Old Testament\n\nStory\n\nAfter God had created heaven and earth and filled it with life of all kinds, he decided to create humans in his image.\n\nSo, God took some clay and molded it into the shape of a man. Then God breathed into the clay man and gave it life! Soon, the man opened his eyes and saw the wonder that was heaven. God named the first man ‘Adam’.\n\nGod loved Adam very much and created a beautiful garden for him. The Garden of Eden became Adam’s home.\n\nBut God soon saw that Adam was lonely and needed company. So he took a rib from Adam and created a beautiful woman. He called her ‘Eve.’ Now Adam and Eve were very happy in their beautiful home. They had all that they could ever need. All the beauty of God’s creation was theirs. But God forbids them from eating the fruit from a tree in the middle of the garden. That was the tree of knowledge.\n\nBut Satan did not like this happy family. So he took on the form of a snake. He called Eve and tempted her to eat the fruit of knowledge. Eve could not resist the temptation and along with Adam took a bite of the forbidden fruit.\n\nSoon, everything changed. Adam and Eve were no longer the happy and carefree souls. God was very sad that his children had disobeyed him. But he could not stop the consequences. So he told them ‘Now you’ll have to suffer. You’ll have to earn your living and live in pain. Nothing will come easy for you. And one day you’ll die.’ This is one of the best kids bible stories from the old testament.\n\nLesson\n\nWe should obey God’s laws.\n\n3. The birth of Jesus\n\nOrigin\n\nThe New Testament\n\nStory\n\nWaiting for Christmas? Did you know that Christmas is the birthday of Jesus Christ? Do you know the wonderful story of Jesus’s birth?\n\nWhen Mary gave birth to baby Jesus, it was nighttime. Some shepherds, who were tending to their sheep nearby, were startled when an angel appeared before them. But the angel had brought good news! He told the shepherds that their Savior had finally come, and it was time to see him.\n\nSoon, other angels appeared and showed the way to find baby Jesus. So, the shepherds made their way to Bethlehem, following the wonderful, bright star in the sky.\n\nNot just the shepherds, the three wise kings too made their way to see baby Jesus – their savior. And so all the world converged at a modest manger to see the Savior of the world! It was a time to rejoice and celebrate.\n\nLesson\n\nJesus is the savior of man.\n\n4. The Baptism Of Jesus\n\nOrigin\n\nThe New Testament\n\nStory\n\nThe baptism of Jesus is one of the major events in the Bible. It is described in all the first three Gospels of the New Testament- Matthew, Mark, and Luke.\n\nJesus himself was the son of God, but before he started God’s work, he went to John the Baptist to get baptized in the Jordan River. When John saw that Jesus was coming to him, he said that he needed to be baptized by Jesus. But Jesus made him understand and John consented.\n\nJohn took Jesus to the river Jordan and baptized him. The minute Jesus came out of the water, heaven opened and John saw the Spirit of God come unto Jesus like a dove. He also heard a voice from the heavens saying, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.”\n\nLesson\n\nJesus is the Son Of God who came to earth for us.\n\n5. The First Miracle In The Cana\n\nOrigin\n\nThe New Testament\n\nStory\n\nThe New Testament of the Bible is full of miracles and healings performed by Jesus, but do you know when these miracles began?\n\nThe Gospel of John mentions that the first miracle by Jesus happened in the Cana city of Galilee. It was a wedding in Cana to which Jesus’ mother Mary, Jesus, and his disciples were all invited.\n\nThe wedding was in full swing, but Mary suddenly came and said to Jesus that the organizers had no wine left. Then she went to the servants and instructed them to follow whatever Jesus told them.\n\nJesus saw six stone jars and told the servants to fill them with water to the brim. Then he instructed them to take some from the jar to the master of the banquet.\n\nWhen the master of the banquet tasted the water, it was turned into wine. He called the bridegroom aside and said that they had saved the best wine for the last. He rejoiced with the wine served to him but did not know where the wine was from.\n\nJesus had turned the water into wine.\n\nLesson\n\nJesus’ presence is sufficient to witness miracles in our lives.\n\n6. Jesus’ 40 Days Of Temptation\n\nOrigin\n\nThe New Testament\n\nStory\n\nWhen we fall into troubles and temptations, remember that even Jesus was tempted by the devil. Let’s read how Jesus came out from those temptations.\n\nOnce, the devil led Jesus into the wilderness and Jesus fasted for forty days and nights there. After those forty days of fasting, when Jesus was hungry, the devil came to him to test him, saying, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.”\n\nBut Jesus told him that man does not live on bread alone, but the word of God keeps us alive.\n\nThen, the devil took Jesus to the highest point of the temple of the holy city and tempted him by saying, “If you are the Son of God,” he said, “throw yourself down. For it is written:\n\n‘He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’\n\nBut Jesus warned the devil to not test the Lord.\n\nThirdly, the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain and showed him the world and its splendor. He said to Jesus that if he will worship the devil, he can have everything.\n\nBut Jesus told the devil to stay away from him, stating that the Bible says to worship the Lord only.\n\nThe devil ran away from him and God sent angels to attend him.\n\nLesson\n\nWhen we see temptations around us, remember to not fall unto them, and God will help us to overcome every temptation.\n\n7. Jesus Brought A Girl Back To Life\n\nOrigin\n\nThe New Testament\n\nStory\n\nJesus healed many sick and even raised the dead Lazarus. But do you know, Jesus also raised a little girl from death?\n\nOnce, there was a man named Jairus, who was one of the synagogue leaders. His twelve-year-old daughter was sick, so he went to Jesus and requested him to come to his house and put his hands on her.\n\nBut when Jesus was going to his house, some people from the house of Jairus came and informed him that the girl was dead.\n\nJesus reassured Jairus and told him to believe. When Jesus reached his home, people were wailing and crying, but Jesus went in and told them that the girl was only sleeping and not dead.\n\nEveryone started laughing at what Jesus said, but Jesus said to let everyone out, except for the girl’s parents and his disciples. He then went near the girl, took her hand, and said, “Talitha koum!” meaning “Little girl, I say to you, get up!”\n\nAnd the girl came to life and stood up.\n\nLesson\n\nIf we trust Jesus, he can even do things that seem impossible.\n\n8. Jesus stops a storm\n\nOrigin\n\nThe New Testament\n\nStory\n\nDo you know of the miracles Jesus performed? Want to hear a cool miracle story?\n\nOnce, Jesus Christ was traveling through the Sea of Galilee with his disciplesiA dedicated follower that believes in their leader’s teachings . But soon a violent storm engulfed them. Water filled the boat, and it began to sink. Jesus was asleep, so his disciples woke him up.\n\nSo Jesus woke up, stood facing the sea, and commanded it to be calm. And just like that, the storm withered away! It is a very short bible story for kids and it is easy for you to act out.\n\nLesson\n\nWith faith in God, nothing is impossible.\n\n9. Jesus walks on water\n\nOrigin\n\nThe New Testament\n\nStory\n\nWhat happens when you throw a rock in the water? It sinks, right? What will happen if you try to walk on water? You’ll drown. But not Jesus!\n\nA long time ago, Jesus asked his disciples to wait for him on the boat while he went up to a mountain to pray. As the disciples waited for the boat for Jesus, a strong storm blew the boat away to the middle of the sea. The disciples tried hard to row the boat back to the shore, but to no avail.\n\nThe disciples were worried about Jesus and wondered what they could do to get their master to the boat. Suddenly, they saw a man walk into the water! The disciples panicked, thinking that a man was about to drown. But it was Jesus, and he did not drown. Instead, he walked over the water and reached the boat safely.\n\nOne of Jesus’s disciples, Peter, asked if he too could walk on water. Jesus said yes, as long as he kept Jesus as his focus.

The Lord himself appeared to Moses in the middle of a burning bush.\n\nAs Moses looked on with wonder, God spoke out “Remove your sandals as you stand on sacred ground.” Then he told Moses that the people of Egypt needed him, so he was to go back to save the Hebrew slaves.\n\nMoses was confused and said, “I am but a common man. How can I convince the Pharaoh to let slaves go? And in any case, the sons of Israel, the Hebrews in Egypt won’t follow me!”\n\nGod knew that Moses still did not trust his strength, so he said, “ Throw your staff to the ground.” Moses did as the Lord said, and lo behold, the staff turned into a serpent! And as Moses picked up the serpent it again became a staff!\n\nMoses finally understood that he was God’s chosen one. With complete faith and trust in the Lord, Moses left for Egypt to save the sons of Israel.

But when she could not hide him any longer, she prepared a papyrus basket coated with tar and pitch for him and placed baby Moses inside the basket. Then, she placed the basket among the reeds of the Nile river bank and instructed his sister to keep an eye on the basket from a distance.\n\nLater that day, when Pharaoh’s daughter came to take a bath in the Nile River, she saw the basket and instructed her slave to fetch it. She opened it and saw a crying baby inside it, so she took pity and took him in.\n\nWhen Moses’ sister saw this scene, she ran to Pharaoh’s daughter and asked her if she should bring a Hebrew woman to nurse the baby.\n\nAnd that’s how Moses was saved and even nursed by his own mother.

However, Pharaoh changed his mind suddenly and decided to chase after them.\n\nHe sent all his horses, chariots, horsemen, and troops to capture the Israelites again. Seeing the Egyptians approaching, the Israelites became terrified since they couldn’t go further because of the Red Sea. They cried out to the LORD, but Mosed told the people not to be afraid as God would fight for them.\n\nThe Lord instructed Moses to raise his staff and stretch it over the Red Sea. So, when Moses stretched his hand over the sea, a strong wind blew and parted the sea, creating the dry land in between.\n\nIsraelites started walking through the dry land to cross the sea, but Egyptians kept chasing them there too. When all the Israelites safely made their way to the other side, Moses stretched out his hand again, and the sea returned to its place.

God instructed him to take his soldiers and march around the city once a day for six days. They should also have seven priests carry trumpets of rams’ horns in front of the ark. On the seventh day, God told him to march around the city seven times, with the priests blowing their trumpets. Upon hearing the last trumpet sound, all the Israelites should shout together and the wall will crumble down.\n\nJoshua and the Israelites did the same as God instructed them for seven days.

Build many rooms in the ark and put a coat of tar on it. “\n\nOnce the ark was ready, God said to Noah “ Take your family to the ark as I don’t want you to die with the corrupt. Also, take a pair of each living being so that life can begin again.”\n\nNow when all was ready according to God’s command, it began to rain. It rained, without a break, for 40 days.

They all speak and understand each other and settle on the beautiful plain in a place called Shinar.\n\nThey then decided to build bricks and make a tower that reaches to the heavens. So that, they will make a name for themselves and will not get scattered over the Earth.\n\nGod came down to see the city and the tower the people were building. He saw that nothing they planned would be impossible for them because they all worked together and spoke the same language. God knew that their pride and ambition for fame could drive them away from Him.\n\nTherefore, God decided to confuse their language so they wouldn’t understand each other anymore. Suddenly, everyone started speaking in different languages.\n\nSince they couldn’t communicate, the people stopped building the city and the tower and God scattered them all over the Earth.\n\nLesson\n\nAlways listen to God and work together in ways that honor him.\n\n18.

On the third day, they reached the mountain. Abraham then instructed his servants to stay at a distance and took Issac with him. Abraham built an altar, a place for an offering, and prepared some wood.\n\nJust as he was about to sacrifice Isaac, an angel from God appeared and stopped him.

He too wanted to see Jesus Christ. But he was a short man and could not see over the crowd.\n\nSo, Zaccheus hit upon a clever idea. He climbed to the top of a tree so he could see who Jesus was.\n\nAs Jesus was passing under the tree, he looked up and said “\n\n“Zaccheus, come down, I must stay at your house today.”\n\nThe jubilant Zaccheus climbed down and began walking with Jesus towards his home.\n\nBut the crowd was not pleased with this change of events. Most people in Jericho did not like tax collectors as most of them were greedy and dishonest.\n\nJesus’ followers did not want their savior to be kind to such a sinner. But Zaccheus was a changed man. He promised Jesus that he would give half of his earnings to the poor and also return the money he had grabbed from common folks.\n\nThis is just what Jesus had hoped for. He blessed Zaccheus and showed that one must hate the sin, not the sinner.\n\nLesson\n\nHate the sin, not the sinner.\n\n36. Parable of the lost sheep\n\nOrigin\n\nThe New Testament\n\nStory\n\nMany stories in the Bible are in the form of parablesiSimplified version of a story to convey the message to the reader that is usually a life lesson or good morals . Parables make the real teachings of the Bible easy to understand.\n\nThe kind lord Jesus spent a lot of his time with sinners. One day, as was his routine, Jesus sat sharing his teachings with a group of tax collectors and sinners.\n\nBut many people, including the Jewish spiritual leaders, named Pharisees, did not appreciate this kind of meeting. Jesus knew that it wouldn’t be an easy task to change people’s minds. So he told them a story to make Jesus’ intentions easier to understand.\n\nThe story went something like this – “If you are a shepherd with 100 sheep and if you lose one, what would you do? Won’t you leave the remaining 99 and go search for the one lost sheep? And when you find him, won’t your heart be full of joy and happiness? And when you reach home, you’ll call all your friends and family and celebrate because you found your lost sheep.”\n\nJesus continued, “Just as you will rejoice about the lost sheep, so will the heavens rejoice when even one sinner repents and reaches out to the Lord.”\n\nLesson\n\nBringing one man to see the light of God is a reason to rejoice.\n\n37. The parable of the prodigal son\n\nOrigin\n\nThe New Testament\n\nStory\n\nHere’s another story within a story! This popular parable also reflects Jesus’ love, grace, and acceptance for everyone.\n\nIt was another beautiful day, and Jesus was trying to explain why he loved sinners so much. So he told the story of the Prodigal Son!\n\n“There once lived a man with two sons” Jesus began. “The younger son developed a greed and asked his father to give him his part of inheritance early. The man loved his sons very much and gave him what he asked for.\n\nSoon, the younger son took all the money and went to a far away land. With the recklessness of youth, he spent all the money on meaningless expenses. Soon he had no money left. This was also the time when famine struck the land. With no money, the younger son began to starve.\n\nWith no other option available, he went to a rich man’s house and asked for a job. The rich man had only one job on offer – that of feeding the pigs! No other man was willing to accept such a dirty job. Amidst this hardship, the younger son soon realized what a blunder he had committed! He said to himself “I will go and beg for my father’s forgiveness. I will ask him to make me his servant”.\n\nWith that thought in mind, he returned to his father’s house. When the father saw his younger son, he was overjoyed. He hugged him. But the son was filled with repentance and wanted to work as his father’s servant. But the father would have none of it! He ordered the best clothes and shoes for his beloved son and hosted a feast in his honor too!\n\nBut the elder son was unhappy and refused to attend the feast. Seeing this, the father asked why he was so unhappy. To this, the elder son replied, “I have never left your side and loved you always. And yet you love my younger brother more.\n\nOn hearing this, the old man smiled and said, “Your brother has returned and repented. That is surely a reason to celebrate. As for you, my son, you own all that is mine, now and forever!”\n\nUpon hearing this story, the people understood exactly why Jesus loved the sinners because they returned from their sin!\n\nLesson\n\nGod loves all his children equally.\n\n38. The Parable Of A Sower\n\nOrigin\n\nThe New Testament\n\nStory\n\nDo you know how and where a sower should seed? Let’s hear this interesting story of a sower.\n\nA sower went out to sow seeds for the plantation. As he scattered the seeds, they fell on different types of ground.\n\nSome seeds fell on a hard path and birds quickly came and ate the seeds.\n\nOther seeds fell on rocky ground, where there was not much soil. The seeds sprouted quickly, but because the soil was shallow, the plants couldn’t grow strong roots. So, when the sun came up, the plants withered and died.\n\nSome seeds fell among thorns, so the thorns grew with seeds and choked the plants.\n\nFinally, there were some seeds that were scattered on a good soil. These seeds grew into strong, healthy plants, bearing crops that were a hundred, sixty, or thirty times what was sown.\n\nLesson\n\nKeep your heart open to God’s words and teaching and let it grow in your heart.\n\n39. The Parable Of A Wedding Feast\n\nOrigin\n\nThe New Testament\n\nStory\n\nTo simplify his teachings about the kingdom of heaven, Jesus compared it with the wedding banquet. Let’s read about this parable.\n\nOnce, a man threw a wedding banquet for his son. He invited some special guests to the banquet, but they all refused to come.\n\nHe sent his servants to the guests, stating that the oxen and fattened cattle had been butchered and prepared for the wedding banquet.\n\nBut the guests paid no attention to his invitation, and some even mistreated and killed his servant. The King got angry and had all the murderers killed and their cities burned.\n\nHe then asked his servants to go to the street corners and invite everyone they could find. And so, the wedding hall was filled with guests of all types of people.\n\nHowever, the king noticed a man who was not dressed properly for the banquet. He was thrown out in the darkness.\n\nLesson\n\nWe all should prepare our hearts to the Lord, and accept Jesus Christ as our savior.\n\n40. The Unforgiving Servant’s Parable\n\nOrigin\n\nThe New Testament\n\nStory\n\nForgiveness and forgiving are important virtues that Jesus talks about in his teachings. Let’s read one such parable on forgiveness.\n\nOnce, there was a king who had accounts to settle with his servants. One of his servants owed him ten thousand bags of gold but he was unable to pay. Therefore, the king gave out an order to sell him, his wife, and his children to repay the debt.\n\nHearing this, the servant began to plead and begged on his knees to be patient. The king took pity on him and eventually canceled his debts.\n\nAs he was going back to his house, the servant met his fellow man who owed him a hundred silver coins. He demanded his money immediately and started choking him.\n\nThe fellow servant begged for more time on his knees, but the wicked servant refused his pleas and threw him in prison. When other servants saw this, they went to the king to tell him about the wicked servant. The king summoned the first servant back and said to him that he should have forgiven and shown mercy to his fellow servant just as he had been forgiven.\n\nLesson\n\nSince God forgives us and delivers us from our sins, we should also learn to forgive.\n\n41. The Rich Man And Lazarus\n\nOrigin\n\nThe New Testament\n\nStory\n\nThrough the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, Jesus warns us to not run after money.\n\nThere was a rich man who used to dress up in purple linen and lived a luxurious life. At the gate of his house lived a beggar named Lazarus, who had sores all over his body. He used to sit outside to eat the crumbs from the rich man’s table. His sores were so bad that dogs used to lick them.\n\nOne day both the beggar and the rich man die. The angels took Lazarus to heaven to Abraham’s side. But the rich man was sent to Hades. When he was being tormented and saw Lazarus by Abraham’s side, he requested Abraham to let Lazarus dip the tip of his finger in water and cool off his tongue because he was in great agony.\n\nBut Abraham replied that Lazarus had received all bad things before and was now being comforted. He also said that it is impossible to cross.\n\nThe rich man then begged Abraham to send Lazarus to his five brothers to warn them, saying that they would listen to the dead and repent.\n\nUpon hearing this, Abraham replied that if they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, the dead can not convince them either.\n\nLesson\n\nAll the world’s riches and earthly possessions mean nothing in front of God if our hearts are not with God.\n\n42. The Parable Of Ten Virgins\n\nOrigin\n\nThe New Testament\n\nStory\n\nJesus used to talk in parables so that everyone could understand his teachings. Let’s read one of the popular parables of ten virgins.\n\nHere, Jesus tells everyone to be prepared for the kingdom of heaven. He gave an example of five virgins who carried their lamps along with extra oil in jars to meet the bridegroom. The other five foolish virgins took their lamps but did not bring any extra oil. While waiting for the bridegroom, everyone became drowsy and fell asleep.\n\nAt midnight, the bridegroom came and there was a sound in the city to come and meet him. All the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps. But then the foolish virgin saw their lamps going dim and asked the wise one for some oil.\n\nHowever, wise ones refused to give them any, fearing that it might not be enough.\n\nWhen the foolish virgins went to the seller to buy some oil, the bridegroom arrived. The wise virgins who were ready went with the bridegroom to the banquet and the door was closed.\n\nWhen foolish virgins came, knocking on the door, the bridegroom refused to recognize them.\n\nLesson\n\nTrust in God and be in his presence at all times since we do not know when the kingdom of heaven will come upon us.\n\n43. The story of Lazarus\n\nOrigin\n\nThe New Testament\n\nStory\n\nDeath is the ultimate reality. Nobody can cheat death. But Jesus? Well, he can do anything!\n\nJesus had two very good friends – Mary and Martha. One day, Jesus got the news that his friends’ brother Lazarus was on his death-bed. The news filled Jesus with sadness for he knew how much his friends loved their brother. But he did not rush to meet the dying man for he knew that God had plans for him.\n\nSoon, Lazarus died. Jesus went to meet his friends four days after Lazarus’ death. But before Jesus could reach their home, he met Martha. She was angry because she felt that Jesus had let them down. She had faith that if Jesus had come on time, her brother could have been saved. So Jesus said to her “I am the resurrection and the life. Anyone who lives and believes in me, even though they are dead, yet shall they live.”\n\nSaying this, Jesus asked Martha to lead him to Lazarus’ grave. Once there, he said, “Lazarus, come forth.” And with those short three words, he breathed back life into Lazarus’ body!\n\nFinally, the world could see that God had sent his son to save them! The story of Lazarus is one of the popular short Bible stories for children.\n\nLesson\n\nGod has a plan for our lives.\n\n44. The last supper\n\nOrigin\n\nThe New Testament\n\nStory\n\nThe story of the last supper has been told a million times. It is even the subject of a famous painting! So, do you want to know what happened at the last supper?\n\nJesus, the Son of God, knew that his time as a mortal was nearly over. His job on earth was nearing completion. But there was still some work to do. He knew that his final gift to mankind would be his death on the cross.\n\nBut before that, he had a few more things to share. So, on his last night alive, he called his apostles for the last supper. He spent the evening sharing his wisdom and knowledge because now it would be up to the apostles to spread the word of God.\n\nThen Jesus got down on his knees and washed their feet. This was a teaching on how to treat each other once Jesus was gone.\n\nThen all of them sat down for supper. Jesus shared food and drinks with them. He told the apostles that they must remember him whenever they had their supper.\n\nAs they were eating their supper, Jesus told his friends that one of the 12 apostles would betray him. Though Jesus knew that it was Judas who would betray him, he did not confront him because he knew that it was all God’s plan.\n\nSoon Judas left the table on some pretense and returned with soldiers to arrest Jesus. Peter tried to protect him, but Jesus told him not to. He knew that it was time for the final sacrifice.\n\nLesson\n\nLove even those who betray you for they too are doing God’s work.\n\n45. The good news\n\nOrigin\n\nThe New Testament\n\nStory\n\nMany think of Jesus’ crucifixion as a sad event. But if you read the Bible you’ll understand that it was the greatest gift that God could ever give you!\n\nAfter Jesus’ arrest, he was taken to the high priest. It was a trial only in name. Jesus’ guilt was already established in the minds of his enemies.\n\nHe was insulted, beaten up and spat upon! His enemies wanted him dead. So, the high priest ordered that Jesus be killed by crucifixion.\n\nSo, the Son of God was nailed to the cross where he died hours later – hungry and thirsty. But before he died, he asked his father, God, to forgive us! That was Jesus’ ultimate sacrifice.\n\nJesus’ brokenhearted followers buried their savior in a cave-tomb and covered its entrance with a large stone.\n\nOn the first day of the next week, Jesus’ friends Mary Magdalene, Peter, John, and Simon came to the tomb to worship. But what they saw shocked them!\n\nThe stone covering the cave’s entrance was rolled to the side, and Jesus’ grave was empty!\n\nAt first, they thought robbers had stolen their savior’s body. But Mary saw two angels inside the cave and as she turned to return saw Jesus standing by her side!\n\nYes, the Messiah had risen from the dead! Jesus went back to his friends – the 12 apostles. They all were overjoyed to see their friend and savior again. They also knew that Jesus was God’s very own son.\n\nJesus told them that God sacrificed him, the Lord’s son, to wash away humanity’s sins. And whoever believed in him and came to him with complete faith will live on forever in heaven.\n\nLesson\n\nGod sacrificed his son to wash away our sins.\n\n46. The new Heaven and Earth\n\nOrigin\n\nThe Book Of Revelation\n\nStory\n\nDid you wonder who wrote the Bible? Do you wonder how they knew God’s words? Here’s a story about the revelation that the apostle John experienced.\n\nJohn was the blessed one to have the truth revealed to him. In his words “ On the day the Savior was nailed to the cross, I was there. I saw him die in pain and agony. But soon he was alive again! He was, after all, the Living One!\n\nThen the angels also showed me many more wondrous things. I saw the Holy City, the beautiful Jerusalem, waiting for all believers.\n\nI also saw the new Heaven and Earth, waiting for God’s children. God spoke to me and said ‘I am the Alpha and Omega. I am everything. I built all this for my children – for you. Whoever believes in me will never go thirsty. To the hungry I will give food. This beautiful new world is now all yours!’”\n\nSo, John wrote down everything God told him and gave us this beautiful book called the Holy Bible! The New Heaven and Earth is one of the simple and short Bible stories for kids.\n\nLesson\n\nThe Bible is God’s word.\n\n47. The good samaritan\n\nOrigin\n\nThe New Testament\n\nStory\n\nHere’s a very interesting story from the Bible, which explains the true meaning of justice.\n\nThere once lived a man who knew all there was to know about the law.\n\nOne day, he asked Jesus “How can I achieve eternal life?”\n\nJesus replied, “Follow the law. Do you know what the law to eternal life is?”\n\nThe expert replied, “Yes if I love the Lord with all my heart and soul. And if I treat my neighbor with the same respect, I will achieve eternal life.”\n\nJesus was happy and said, “You are right. Follow this simple rule and you will be saved.”\n\nBut the law expert was still not sure. So he asked his savior “ But who is my neighbor? Is it the person staying next to me?”\n\nJesus realized that the law expert was confused so he told him a story. He said, “ One day a man was traveling to Jericho from Jerusalem. But a gang of robbers soon overtook him and robbed him of all that he possessed. They even took his clothes and beat him ruthlessly.\n\nThe poor man could not walk to safety. A priest soon passed by but did not try to help the man. Levite, too, ignored the wounded man and went his way.\n\nBut a SamaritaniPeople belonging to the Ancient city of Samaria, in Israel, as depicted in the Bible or someone helpful passing by took one look at the man and took pity on him. He washed his wounds and tied a neat bandage. But that was not the end of the Samaritan’s kindness. He then took the wounded man to an inn and nursed him back to health.”\n\nNow Jesus asked the law expert a question “ “Which of the three – the priest, the Levite, and the Samaritan – do you think was a neighbor to the robbed man?”\n\n“The Samaritan for he showed mercy to the poor man.” The law expert replied.\n\nLesson\n\nLove all beings as you would love God.\n\n48. A roaring rescue\n\nOrigin\n\nThe Old Testament\n\nStory\n\nThis interesting story will teach an important lesson to kids, of having faith and strength even during times of trial.\n\nBabylon was ruled by King Darius. He had appointed several men as advisors, soldiers and various ministers. Daniel was appointed as the leader of advisors. He was a religious man who had immense faith in Christ. But others did not like Daniel and wanted to get him removed from the position.\n\nThey devised a plan and approached the king. The plan was to convince the king to make a new law saying, people of Babylon should only pray to King Darius. If any person is found offering prayers to someone other than King Darius, they will be punished and thrown into the lion’s den.\n\nDaniel was aware of the new law but could not stop himself from offering his prayers to God. He was also very dear to King Darius but when the other men complained about Daniel’s prayers, the king had no choice but to punish Daniel.\n\nKing Darius punished Daniel by imprisoning him in the lion’s den, but said ‘May your God rescue you Daniel.’ Daniel showed no signs of worry and started offering his prayers to Christ.\n\nOn the following day, King Darius visited the den and asked if Daniel was doing ok. Daniel was delighted to see the king was concerned about him and replied, saying, “My lord majesty, my God has shut the mouths of lions and kept me safe.” Hearing this, King Darius opened the door and set Daniel free. Everyone was surprised to see Daniel come out safe and healthy.\n\nKing Darius punished the men who schemed against Daniel and issued a decree stating that the people of Babylon must fear the God of Daniel.\n\nLesson\n\nGod is mightier than any of our fears. Therefore, trusting and honoring the almighty will ensure we are on the right path in life.\n\n49. Survival Of Daniel’s Friends In Fire\n\nOrigin\n\nThe Old Testament\n\nStory\n\nWe learned how God was with Daniel during the times of trial, and this story is about Daniel’s friends.\n\nDaniel along with his three friends- Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego (or Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah in Hebrew), were brought to Babylon to serve at the king’s court. During those times, King Nebuchadnezzar set a decree to fall down and worship his gold image. But Daniel’s three friends only worshiped and bowed to God. One day, a few officials of Babylon informed the king about this matter. Raging with anger, the king summoned the three of them to be questioned.\n\nDaniel’s three friends remained certain and refused to bow before their gods or the king’s gold image. Therefore, Nebuchadnezzar commanded to throw them in a fiery furnace, tied firmly. The flame was so high that it even killed the soldiers who went to throw them in the furnace.\n\nHowever, the king saw that there were four men, instead of three, walking freely and unharmed in the furnace, with the fourth one looking like the son of God.\n\nThe king called them out and praised their God who saved them from the hot fire. He also promoted all three of them in his province.\n\nLesson\n\nWhen life gives you challenges, hold onto God and trust him because he can deliver you from every problem.\n\n50. David And Goliath\n\nOrigin\n\nThe Old Testament\n\nStory\n\nA long time ago in a faraway place, there were two tribes of people, the Israelites and the Philistines. The Philistines had a big, scary giant named Goliath. He challenged the people of Israel to a fight, but everyone was scared because Goliath was so strong and tough.\n\nBut then came a young shepherd named David. He was not a big warrior, he was just a child who took care of sheep. David heard about the challenge and said, ‘I’ll do it!’ People were surprised because David was small and did not wear heavy armor like the other fighters.\n\nDavid went to face Goliath with his sling and five smooth stones. Goliath laughed at David because he looked so small.\n\nBut David did not give up. He trusted in God and used his sling to aim a stone right at Goliath’s forehead. The giant fell to the ground, and David grabbed Goliath’s sword to finish the job. The Israelites were astonished and overjoyed. They cheered, and David showed everyone that even if you are not the biggest or strongest, you can still be really brave and do amazing things when you trust yourself and believe that God is on your side.\n\nLesson\n\nEven the smallest can be the bravest. Trust in yourself and God and face challenges with courage.\n\n51. Peter And John Healed A Lame Man\n\nOrigin\n\nThe New Testament\n\nStory\n\nAfter the resurrection of Jesus Christ, Peter and John along with other disciples of Jesus continued spreading the Gospel of Jesus and performed miracles. Let’s hear one of the miracles that Peter and John performed in Jesus’ name.\n\nOne day when Peter and John were going to the temple in the afternoon, they saw a lame man sitting by the temple gate called beautiful. He was lame by birth and was put at the temple gate every day to beg. When Peter and John passed by him, he asked them for money. But Peter and John asked him for his attention.\n\nHe was expecting something from them, but then Peter looked at him, and said that he did not have any silver or gold, but commanded him to walk in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. After saying this, Peter helped him to stand and he instantly got strength in his feet and ankles. He jumped, walked and praised God, and went into temple courts with them.\n\nLesson\n\nWe can do anything in Christ if it’s God’s will.\n\n52. Paul Encountering Jesus\n\nOrigin\n\nThe New Testament\n\nStory\n\nWe all know about Paul the Apostle who spread the Gospel- The Good News. But do you know, he was once a person who used to torture Christians? Let’s learn how his life was transformed.\n\nEarlier, Paul was called Saul and he used to torture and prison Jesus’ disciples and his people. One day, he was going to Damascus to get the acceptance letters from the synagogues to capture the Lord’s people. But, God had other plans for him!\n\nWhen he was near Damascus, suddenly, a bright light flashed around him from heaven. He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?” Saul asked who the voice belonged to and he heard a voice saying that he was Jesus.\n\nAll his men were speechless because they could only hear the sound but not see anyone. Finally, when he stood up and opened his eyes, he could not see anything. His men took him to Damascus by hand where he remained blind for three days and did not eat or drink anything.\n\nAfter three days, a disciple named Ananias got a vision from God to go to Saul and restore his sight. Ananias obeyed God and went to Saul to restore his sight. Once he got his eyesight back, he got up and was baptized. From then onwards, his life was transformed and he became the apostle Paul.\n\nLesson\n\nJesus always has a plan for our lives, we just need to listen to his voice.\n\nTo receive blessings is to help those in need, and true happiness is in giving. These Bible stories for children are excellent ways to make children understand the art of living and help them distinguish virtue from vice. Early exposure to such stories etches in young minds that counter hatred never yields anything good but destroys peace. The holy book is a treasure trove of ancient wisdom, and these stories are just a drop in the ocean that is the Bible. So guide your child to the path of righteousness through these fascinating stories.\n\nTabitha was a woman of faith who used her gifts to help others. She was a loyal follower of Jesus Christ. She was an example of courage and generosity, inspiring us to be kind and generous."
