        "text": "Movie Review\n\nEasy, he said. A sure thing, he said. A great payday for 15 minutes of work, he said.\n\nWell, Mr. Besegai said wrong.\n\nSure, any good crook would know that easy, lucrative, sure crime heistsare rare. And robbing Boston’s corrupt mayor? Yeah, that adds a few layers of difficulty.\n\nBut this caper doesn’t come with a good crook.\n\nThis is Rory’s first robbery. Ever. The former Marine might’ve been hired because of his military training, but he was a mechanic. Change a sparkplug, and Rory’s your guy. Be Jason Bourne? Not so much.\n\nCoppy, the crew’s ever-chatty second man, has at least some experience in crime. Why, he even did a three-year stint behind bars—which, come to think of it, doesn’t exactly instill confidence. (Ideally, you try not to get caught.)\n\nAnd the point man, Scalvo? Well, let’s just say he’s seen Scarface a few too many times.\n\nBut Besegai insists that even this crew can pull it off. All they need to do is raid Mayor Miccelli’s re-election victory party. Boston businessmen and contractors will be lining up to drink his champagne, kiss his ring and pay his obligatory bribe. The crooked politician will probably pocket several hundred thousand dollars in tax-free graft before the liquor’s gone—and it’ll be all in cash.\n\nSo all our crew must do is get in after the party’s over, tie up a handful of straggling workers, force the mayor’s lackey to hand over the moolah and leave by 6:07 p.m., before an armored truck arrives.\n\nEasy. Lucrative. And as sure a sure thing as the mayor’s own inevitable victory.\n\nOnly the mayor doesn’t win.\n\nOnly someone already hauled away most of the money, so all that’s left is some spare change.\n\nOnly Scalvo—seriously disappointed at the paltry heft of the heist—starts demanding that the mayor and the remaining officials hand over their wallets and jewelry, including Miccelli’s treasured bracelet. And that little dalliance puts them well past their 6:07 departure time.\n\nAnd then the mask-less Scalvo (who, again, watched way too much Scarface) decides that maybe it’d be best to shoot everybody.\n\nWell.\n\nOnly three people wind up getting shot: Scalvo, dead. The chief of police, dead. And Coppy gets hit in the shoulder\n\nHe and Rory stagger out of the facility, steal the armored car (which arrived, right on time, at 6:07) and thunder through Boston. They don’t have much of a haul, which’ll upset Mr. Besegai. They do have Mayor Micelli’s bracelet, which ticks off the pol. The two crooks have no money, no friends, Coppy’s bleeding bad and still won’t stop talking.\n\nEasy, he said. Yeah, right.\n\nPositive Elements\n\nOur two main characters, Rory and Coppy, have clearly made some poor life choices. But in some respects, they’re not so bad.\n\nRory is perhaps the most relatable of the two. He’s not interested in making a late-in-life career switch to crime: He wants to reconnect with his teen son. But he feels like he has too many debts on his ledger to make that reconnection. He needs $32,480 to make the necessary amends, and this seems like the only realistic avenue open to him. He won’t do the job for less, and he won’t accept more. And yeah, while taking the job was unquestionably wrong, there’s something to be said about reconnecting with your kid.\n\nCoppy’s own checkered past comes with an asterisk. During another robbery, he was with a guy who was literally left holding the bag. That bag would’ve earned the guy eight-to-10 years in the slammer, thanks to his prior arrests. So he took the blame and was sent to the clink for three years.\n\nWe must introduce a third character to our little party: Not Scalvo (heavens, no, not in this section), but rather Rory’s conscientious psychiatrist, Dr. Donna Rivera. She clearly cares for Rory’s well-being—and she goes to some pretty outlandish lengths to keep him alive and shepherd him to a better place—mentally, emotionally and, at times, physically.\n\nViolent Content\n\nAfter the three would-be robbers gather up wallets and jewelry from Mayor Miccelli and his inner circle, Scalvo—worried because they’ve seen his face—seems ready to shoot everyone in the room. The police chief also reaches for his gun, leading to a very brief shootout. Scalvo and the chief are killed: We see a small bullet wound in Scalvo’s forehead as he gets shot, though it’s suggested later that the aftermath was much worse. (“Was he a handsome guy?” someone asks Rory and Cobby. “I couldn’t tell with his head blown off.”) The chief’s body lies bloodied on the floor.\n\nThose are the movie’s only two fatalities, believe it or not—though it’s not for lack of trying.\n\nBesegai sends a friendly hit man to kill Cobby and Rory, but the two are saved by a serendipitously exploding house. (Characters get knocked down but not seriously injured.) A bar also blows up. Dozens of lawmen—including several snipers—fire into a Boston office building, leading to a lot of property damage but just one minor injury.\n\nCobby is shot, and he whines—quite regularly—that he’s on the verge of death. We see the wound a couple of times, and Rory convinces Dr. Rivera to remove the bullet. She’s a psychiatrist, sure, but she does remember plenty of her traditional medical training from her residency. “Honestly, gunshot wounds are my favorite,” she reassures Cobby. “I liked finding [the bullets].”\n\nWe see a couple of frenetic car chases and lots of unsafe driving. Cars and trucks and even tank-like vehicles take a beating, and airbags occasionally deploy. But it doesn’t seem like anyone gets seriously injured. Cobby and Rory take Dr. Rivera hostage—with her permission, of course. Dr. Rivera agrees to the plan, but only if Rory threatens to kill her if she doesn’t go along. (Rory weakly obliges.)\n\nSomeone smashes up a workplace. People are threatened. Guns are brandished. An armored truck guard fires off a couple of shotgun rounds. We hear a threat aimed at the removal of a critical piece of the male anatomy.\n\nNear the beginning of the movie, Rory confesses to Dr. Rivera that he’s dealing with thoughts of suicide. He says that he has a plan in place: If things didn’t get better in a year (he told himself at the time), that he’d “cash in [his] ticket.” When Dr. Rivera asks how long ago he set that plan in motion, Rory confesses, “About a year ago.”"
