Years in the studio from a young age lead to a BFA in Choreography from the University of California, Irvine where she worked with Israel “El” Gabriel, Loretta Livingston, Molly Lynch and Diane Diefenderfer. This is where a personal love for Pilates started and continued throughout the next decade and a half, during which time Jessica also ran numerous arts and education non-profits as well as obtained her California Teaching Credential in Physical Education. During her time within the local school district and after-school programs, Jessica choreographed and produced roughly fifty musical productions in addition to her work with local theater companies like Out of the Box! and On the Verge Summer Repertory Theater Company, in which she was a founding member and producer. Now a business owner and trainer at Groove Pilates in Montecito, Jessica continues to volunteer in the SBUSD theater classrooms teaching dance and choreographing musicals, most recently Anything Goes! at Dos Pueblos High School. When she’s not working, Jessica enjoys time with her husband and two children at their Goleta home.\n\nMATTHEW FLOYD MILLER (Dialect Coach) is delighted to be working with Ensemble again, and with these amazing artists!

Proudly stationed at Ensemble Theatre Santa Barbara, she had the privilege of orchestrating the intricate dance of stagecraft for a range of productions. From the soul-stirring melodies of The Pianist of Willesden Lane to the comedic charm of The Thanksgiving Play and the thought-provoking dialogue of War Words, her journey as Production Stage Manager has been defined by a passion for the craft. In addition to her PSM credits, she lent her expertise as an Assistant Stage Manager to noteworthy productions such as Ring of Fire: The Music of Johnny Cash, Seared, Selling Kabul, and The Children, ensuring each performance runs seamlessly. Beyond ETC at the New Vic, her stage management journey has been quite the adventure. From the Black Hills Playhouse in South Dakota, where she handled 10 different musicals and plays, to Cedar Point’s live entertainment in Ohio. In Chicago, she managed “Always… Patsy Cline,” and in Portland, Maine, she worked on four productions at Portland Stage. Each place brought its own challenges and rewards, shaping her into the versatile stage manager she is today. A heartfelt thank you to my sister Jen and dear friends Haley and Fausto for their unwavering support, joining me in celebrating the transformative power of live theater. Here’s to the next act, filled with countless moments of collaboration and artistic fulfillment."
