A05459, RULES REPORT NO. 88, BRONSON, D'URSO, BLAKE, FAHY, STECK, COLTON, REYES. AN ACT TO AMEND THE STATE FINANCE LAW, IN RELATION TO THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF CONSULTANT CONTRACTS BY STATE AGENCIES. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: ON A MOTION BY MR. BRONSON, THE SENATE BILL IS BEFORE THE HOUSE. THE SENATE BILL IS ADVANCED. AN EXPLANATION IS REQUESTED, MR. BRONSON. WE ARE ON DEBATE. MEMBERS WHO ARE IN THE AISLES, PLEASE TAKE YOUR SEATS. GENTLEMAN, GENTLE LADY, WOULD YOU PLEASE TAKE YOUR SEATS? WE HAVE A DEBATE GOING ON. HELLO, NICE TO MEET YOU. PROCEED, MR. BRONSON. SHH. MR. BRONSON: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. THIS BILL IS IN RESPONSE TO NEW YORKERS ACROSS THE STATE ASKING FOR STATE GOVERNMENT TO FIND COST EFFICIENCIES AND TO REIN IN STATE SPENDING. THIS BILL, WHEN ENACTED, WILL INDEED SAVE MILLIONS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS. ESSENTIALLY WHAT THE BILL DOES IS IT WOULD REQUIRE WHENEVER A STATE AGENCY IS ANTICIPATING LETTING OUT A CONTRACT TO 8 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 CONSULTANTS AND THAT CONTRACT IS GOING TO COST MORE THAN $750,000 OVER A 12-MONTH PERIOD, THAT THERE MUST BE A COST ANALYSIS DONE COMPARING THE COST OF LETTING THE CONTRACT OUT VERSUS THE COST OF HAVING STATE EMPLOYEES DO THE WORK. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MR. GOODELL. MR. GOODELL: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. SPEAKER. WOULD THE SPONSOR YIELD? MR. BRONSON: YES, MR. SPEAKER, I WILL. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MR. BRONSON YIELDS. MR. GOODELL: THANK YOU, MR. BRONSON. I KNOW WE PASSED A SIMILAR BILL, I BELIEVE LAST YEAR, THAT WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR. HAS THIS BILL BEEN CHANGED? MR. BRONSON: IT HAS NOT. MR. GOODELL: AND IS THERE ANY INDICATION THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS CHANGED? MR. BRONSON: I CERTAINLY -- MR. GOODELL: AT LEAST IN HIS PERSPECTIVE? MR. BRONSON: I CERTAINLY HOPE SO. MR. GOODELL: YOU AND I SHARE THAT FROM TIME TO TIME. BUT GETTING BACK TO THIS. PART OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE GOVERNOR EXPRESSED WAS THAT THE COST OF THE STUDY MIGHT EXCEED THE SAVINGS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE ACHIEVED; WHAT'S YOUR VIEW ON THAT? MR. BRONSON: I THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE SET AS A PRIORITY THAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO SAVE TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND THE -- IT'S -- IT'S NOT A STUDY THAT HAS TO BE DONE, IT'S AN ANALYSIS DONE BY THE 9 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 AGENCY AND, IN FACT, THERE ARE SOME AGENCIES THAT ALREADY DO THIS. SO, I THINK THAT IF THE GOVERNOR BELIEVES THAT CERTAIN AGENCIES SHOULD DO THIS, I THINK THAT THE LOGIC SHOULD APPLY THAT ALL AGENCIES OUGHT TO DO THAT COMPARISON ANALYSIS. MR. GOODELL: AND DOES THIS BILL CONTAIN A COST-SAVING THRESHOLD? IN OTHER WORDS, DOES THE STUDY HAVE TO INDICATE THAT, FOR EXAMPLE, THERE'D BE A SAVINGS IN EXCESS OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT BEFORE YOU WOULD GO WITH A CONTRACTOR? MR. BRONSON: I BELIEVE IT'S 10 PERCENT. MR. GOODELL: SO IF THIS BILL WERE IMPLEMENTED, THEN, WE WOULD SPEND UP TO 10 PERCENT MORE BY NOT GOING WITH A CONTRACTOR THAN WITH GOING WITH AN OUTSIDE CONSULTANT? MR. BRONSON: THERE WOULD BE FLEXIBILITY SO THAT -- I MEAN, WE DON'T WANT AN EXACT KIND OF COMPARISON, AND SO THERE'S AN EXACT, YOU KNOW, FOUNDATION LINE. SO, WE WANT TO GIVE SOME FLEXIBILITY AND THAT'S WHY WE ALSO HAVE CERTAIN AREAS WHERE THE CONTRACT WOULD BE LETTED OUT BECAUSE OF -- OF A SPECIALITY AREA OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE. MR. GOODELL: AND HOW WOULD THIS APPLY IN THE CONTEXT OF DESIGN-BUILD? MR. BRONSON: IT WOULD -- SO, IN -- IN DESIGN-BUILD, DEPENDING ON IF THAT'S AUTHORIZED AND, AS YOU KNOW, THAT'S ONLY AUTHORIZED IN LIMITED SITUATIONS ACROSS THE STATE AND, CERTAINLY, IN NEW YORK CITY WE -- WE HAVE DONE IT MORE OFTEN, BUT I THINK THAT THE SAME WAY THAT YOU -- EXPERTS ARE USED IN A DESIGN-BUILD 10 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 SCENARIO, WE WOULD DO THAT ANALYSIS HERE. BUT WITH THAT, WE'RE -- THE ARGUMENT OF USING DESIGN-BUILD IS BECAUSE OF THE EFFICIENCIES OF HAVING ONE PERSON GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE PROJECT. SO, I THINK THERE WOULD BE SOME LIMITATIONS JUST OUT OF A -- A PRACTICAL NATURE OF DESIGN-BUILD. MR. GOODELL: ONE OF THE OTHER CONCERNS THAT WAS RAISED WAS NOT ONLY THE COST OF DOING THE STUDY, BUT THE STAFF RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO DO THE STUDY. MR. BRONSON: OH. MR. GOODELL: COULD A STATE AGENCY CONTRACT WITH A PRIVATE CONSULTANT TO DO THE COST ANALYSIS OF HIRING PRIVATE CONSULTANTS FOR A -- A PARTICULAR PROJECT? FOR EXAMPLE, PRICE WATERHOUSE AND SOME OF THE OTHER LARGER FIRMS DO A LOT OF THAT COST ANALYSIS WORK. SO, MY QUESTION IS, COULD THE STATE AGENCY HIRE AN OUTSIDE CONSULTANT TO EVALUATE THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF OUTSIDE CONSULTANT CONTRACTS? MR. BRONSON: I PRESUME THAT THEY COULD. MR. GOODELL: SO THIS DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT THE COST ANALYSIS BE PERFORMED IN-HOUSE? MR. BRONSON: I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT A COST ANALYSIS IS GOING TO COST OVER $750,000, SO MY SENSE IS IF THEY -- THEY BELIEVE THEY WOULD NEED THAT OUTSIDE EXPERTISE, IT'S POSSIBLE, BUT LET ME GET BACK TO YOUR PREVIOUS QUESTION, MR. GOODELL, BECAUSE I -- I DIDN'T GIVE A COMPLETE ACCURATE ANSWER. ON DESIGN-BUILD, THAT WOULDN'T APPLY HERE BECAUSE PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS, PUBLIC PROJECTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN 11 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 THIS BILL. MR. GOODELL: NOW, YOU ALSO HAVE SPECIAL PROVISIONS IN THE EVENT WORK THAT'S CURRENTLY BEING DONE BY STATE EMPLOYEES IS CONTRACTED OUT AND AFFECTS 50 OR MORE EMPLOYEES? MR. BRONSON: YES, WE DO. MR. GOODELL: AND IN THAT CASE AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THE EMPLOYEES AND THEIR BARGAINING UNIT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUBMIT A BID -- MR. BRONSON: YES. MR. GOODELL: -- FOR WORK. IS THERE A TIMEFRAME ON WHICH THEY ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THAT BID? MR. BRONSON: I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S IN THE STATUTE. MR. GOODELL: SO, ONE OF THE CONCERNS -- ANOTHER ONE OF THE CONCERNS WAS THAT THIS COULD DELAY THE PROVISION OF CRITICAL SERVICES WHILE EITHER THE STUDY IS BEING DONE OR ALTERNATIVE BIDS ARE BEING SOLICITED FROM EMPLOYEES; WHAT'S YOUR VIEW ON THAT? MR. BRONSON: WELL, I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THE -- THE STATE AGENCY AND THE WORKERS WITHIN THAT WOULD -- WOULD, I MEAN, THEY -- THEY WANT TO BE COMPETITIVE, THEY WANT THESE PROJECTS. SO, YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE UNDUE DELAY IN -- IN SUBMITTING THEIR PROPOSAL. MR. GOODELL: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. BRONSON. I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. MR. BRONSON: THANK YOU. MR. GOODELL: ON THE BILL, SIR. 12 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: ON THE BILL, MR. GOODELL. MR. GOODELL: I APPRECIATE MR. BRONSON'S COMMENTS ABOUT THE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO A COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS BEFORE WE CONTRACT OUT ANY SERVICES THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING PROVIDED BY THE STATE AGENCY ITSELF; HOWEVER, THIS BILL IS CLEAR THAT THE PURPOSE OF THAT COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS IS NOT NECESSARILY TO SAVE THE STATE MONEY. BECAUSE WHAT IT SAID IS EVEN IF THE COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT THE STATE TAXPAYERS WOULD SAVE 10 PERCENT OR LESS -- I'M SORRY, YEAH, UP TO 10 PERCENT, WE WOULD STILL KEEP IT IN-HOUSE. AND SO IF OUR FOCUS IS TO PROVIDE THE BEST QUALITY SERVICE FOR OUR RESIDENTS AT THE LOWEST PRICE, THEN WE SHOULDN'T PASS A LAW THAT SAYS WE'LL CHARGE YOU UP TO 10 PERCENT MORE JUST TO KEEP IT IN-HOUSE. AND I WILL SHARE -- AND IN A PREVIOUS LIFE, IT SEEMS LIKE AN ETERNITY AGO, I WORKED FOR COUNTY GOVERNMENT AND WE ROUTINELY CONTRACTED SERVICES OUT OR BROUGHT THEM BACK. AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT MAINTAINING THAT COMPETITIVE FOCUS AND ALWAYS FOCUSING ON THE BOTTOM LINE OF THE BEST SERVICE FOR THE BEST PRICE WAS A GREAT BENEFIT FOR OUR TAXPAYERS. THIS CHANGES THE EQUATION BY SAYING WE'LL KEEP IT IN-HOUSE EVEN IF IT COSTS UP TO 10 PERCENT MORE, AND DEPENDING ON -- WE'RE ONLY DEALING WITH CONTRACTS OVER $750- SO THAT 10 PERCENT MORE COULD BE QUITE SUBSTANTIAL. FOR THAT REASON, I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING IT AND RECOMMENDING MY COLLEAGUES THAT THEY PUT THE TAXPAYERS FIRST, QUALITY FIRST, SERVICE FIRST AND ENCOURAGE THE CONTINUED USE OF COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE GETTING THE BEST BANG FOR 13 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 THE BUCK FOR OUR RESIDENTS. THANK YOU, SIR. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: READ THE LAST SECTION. THE CLERK: THIS ACT SHALL TAKE EFFECT ON THE 90TH DAY. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THE CLERK WILL RECORD THE VOTE. (THE CLERK RECORDED THE VOTE.) MR. BRONSON TO EXPLAIN HIS VOTE. MR. BRONSON: TO EXPLAIN MY VOTE, MR. SPEAKER. THIS BILL, INDEED, IS ABOUT SAVING TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND FINDING EFFICIENCIES. IN NEW YORK STATE, WE SPEND OVER $2 BILLION A YEAR ON CONSULTANTS AND, IN MANY CASES, THESE CONSULTANTS PERFORM WORK THAT COULD BE DONE BY PROFESSIONALS WITHIN THE STATE WORKFORCE. BY SOME ESTIMATES, THE STATE SPENDS 32, 32 PERCENT MORE ON STATE CONTRACTS FOR PERSONAL SERVICES TODAY THAN IT DID A DECADE AGO, AND THE COST OF SERVICES PROVIDED BY CONSULTANTS IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN SERVICES PROVIDED BY STATE EMPLOYEES. OVER THE YEARS, VARIOUS COMPTROLLERS HAVE CONDUCTED STUDIES AND ANALYSIS THAT REVEAL SAVINGS IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THESE STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE BY COMPTROLLERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE, REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, AND THEY HAVE COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION: THAT WE SAVE MONEY WHEN OUR PROFESSIONAL STATE EMPLOYEES PROVIDE THESE SERVICES. THERE HAVE BEEN -- THE SENATE TASK FORCE ON GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY ESTIMATED THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF 14 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 TRANSPORTATION COULD SAVE ABOUT $46 MILLION PER YEAR BY IMPLEMENTING A SIMILAR POLICY TO THIS. THE FEDERAL OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET ISSUED A DIRECTIVE TO FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THAT CALLS FOR THEM TO PERFORM A COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS BEFORE ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS AND TO INITIATE PILOT PROGRAMS IN THIS REGARD. THIS PROGRAM WOULD WORK. IT WOULD SAVE TAXPAYER DOLLARS. THE ANALYSIS WOULD SHOW WHEN WE SHOULD BE USING STATE EMPLOYEES. I ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE FOR THE TAXPAYERS AND VOTE YES ON THIS BILL. I WITHDRAW MY REQUEST AND I WILL BE VOTING IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MR. BRONSON IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. ARE THERE ANY OTHER VOTES? ANNOUNCE THE RESULTS. (THE CLERK ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS.) THE BILL IS PASSED. MR. RAMOS. MR. RAMOS: MR. SPEAKER, AT THIS TIME, CAN WE GO TO RULES REPORT NO. 79, PAGE 3, MR. COLTON. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THE CLERK WILL READ. THE CLERK: ASSEMBLY NO. A04816, RULES REPORT NO. 79, COLTON, WEPRIN, ZEBROWSKI, JAFFEE, LAVINE, M.G. MILLER, ARROYO, MCDONOUGH, BLAKE, LAWRENCE, ABINANTI, DICKENS, D'URSO, GOTTFRIED, MONTESANO, CRUZ, COOK, FERNANDEZ. AN ACT TO AMEND THE PENAL LAW, IN RELATION TO PROHIBITING THE MANUFACTURE, TRANSPORT OR SHIPMENT OF UNDETECTABLE KNIVES AND PROHIBITING THE POSSESSION OF 15 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 SUCH KNIVES. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: ON A MOTION BY MR. COLTON, THE SENATE BILL IS BEFORE THE HOUSE. THE SENATE BILL IS ADVANCED. AN EXPLANATION IS REQUESTED, MR. COLTON. MR. COLTON: YES, THANK YOU. THIS BILL PROHIBITS THE MANUFACTURE, TRANSPORT, SHIPMENT OR POSSESSION OF AN UNDETECTABLE KNIFE, WHICH THE BILL DEFINES AS A KNIFE WHICH DOES NOT UTILIZE MATERIALS THAT ARE DETECTABLE BY A METAL DETECTOR, THAT IS CAPABLE OF READY-USE AS A STABBING OR CUTTING WEAPON, AND WAS COMMERCIALLY MANUFACTURED TO BE USED AS A WEAPON. THESE WEAPONS PRESENT A SERIOUS SECURITY RISK TO ANY BUILDING THAT NEEDS TO USE METAL DETECTORS FOR THE PREVENTION OF VIOLENCE OR TERRORIST ACTS, WHICH IS WHY THIS BILL HAS HAD THE SUPPORT OF PBA'S AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. FOR THE SAKE OF CLARIFYING IN THE RECORD, THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT IS NOT TO INCLUDE POSSESSION OF SUCH KNIFE WHOSE INTENT IS TO BE USED SOLELY BY A CONTRACTOR OR AN ELECTRICIAN OR OTHER TRADE AS A WORKERS' TOOL. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MR. RAIA. MR. RAIA: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. WILL THE SPONSOR YIELD FOR A COUPLE QUESTIONS? ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MR. COLTON, WILL YOU YIELD? MR. COLTON: YES, CERTAINLY. MR. RAIA: THANK YOU, MR. COLTON. \"COMMERCIALLY MANUFACTURED TO BE USED AS A WEAPON.\" IS THERE A KNIFE THAT EXISTS THAT 16 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 ISN'T CAPABLE OF BEING A WEAPON? MR. COLTON: WELL, THIS HAS TO BE SPECIFICALLY COMMERCIALLY MANUFACTURED FOR THE -- AS A USE AS A WEAPON. WE'RE REFERRING TO KNIVES THAT ARE ADVERTISED ON THE INTERNET AS BEING NON-METALLIC, CAPABLE OF PIERCING A DRUM OR A CAR DOOR. BASICALLY, MAKING IT VERY CLEAR THAT THESE ARE WEAPONS. THEY ARE IN VARIOUS SHAPES AND FORMS. FOR EXAMPLE, ONE IS IN THE SHAPE OF A CONE WHICH YOU CAN PULL THE TOP OFF AND YOU HAVE A WEAPON. THESE CAN EASILY PASS THROUGH METAL DETECTORS; THEY ARE NOT DETECTABLE AND THEY ARE, IN FACT, WEAPONS. IN MY DISTRICT A FEW YEARS AGO, WE HAD A DEMONSTRATION THAT WAS ORGANIZED TOGETHER WITH THE OFFICE OF SCHOOL SAFETY OF NEW YORK CITY AND WE HAD A NUMBER OF THESE WEAPONS WHICH WERE PURCHASED ON THE INTERNET FOR $9, $10, $15 AND YOU HAD THEM ON SOMEBODY AND THAT PERSON WAS -- WALKED THROUGH THE METAL DETECTOR AND, IN FACT, IT DID NOT SET OFF THE METAL DETECTOR. ALSO, ONE OF THESE WEAPONS WAS USED GOING THROUGH METAL DETECTORS IN A COURT IN CALIFORNIA AND THE COURT OFFICER WAS STABBED WITH THE WEAPON. AND THAT'S WHY CALIFORNIA PASSED A VERY SIMILAR LAW TO THIS WHICH PROHIBITED THESE UNDETECTABLE KNIVES USED AND MANUFACTURED COMMERCIALLY SPECIFICALLY AS WEAPONS, AND ADVERTISED AS SUCH. SO, THAT LAST ELEMENT IS REQUIRED. MR. RAIA: I AGREE, JUST SO THERE'S, YOU KNOW, FULL CLARITY HERE, I AGREE WITH YOU THIS IS, YOU KNOW, A GOOD PIECE OF LEGISLATION. I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN MAKE IT BETTER. 17 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 AND ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS, AND I KNOW WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION IN THE PAST, I'M A FISHERMAN AND WE USE CERAMIC KNIVES. YOU CAN GO TO BED BATH & BEYOND AND SPEND A WHOLE A LOT OF MONEY ON A SET OF CUTLERY THAT DOESN'T HAVE ONE PIECE OF METAL IN IT, THEY'RE ALL CERAMIC. IS THERE AN EXEMPTION FOR CERAMIC KNIVES? MR. COLTON: THESE ARE NOT INTENDED TO COVER CERAMIC KNIVES BECAUSE CERAMIC KNIVES ARE NOT COMMERCIALLY MANUFACTURED AS WEAPONS. THEIR PURPOSE IS TO, YOU KNOW, CUT FOOD AND FISHING LINES AND SO FORTH. MR. RAIA: BUT IF I TURN AROUND AND USE IT AND STAB SOMEBODY, GUESS WHAT? IT'S NOW A WEAPON. MR. COLTON: BUT IT WOULD NOT COME UNDER THIS SECTION BECAUSE IT SPECIFICALLY BY DEFINITION HAS TO BE COMMERCIALLY MANUFACTURED TO BE USED AS A WEAPON. IT HAS TO BE INTENT OF THE MANUFACTURER TO MAKE A WEAPON. AND, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE INTERNET ADS, YOU WILL FIND THAT THE ADVERTISEMENTS SAY SPECIFICALLY THESE ARE USED FOR WEAPONS, COVERT WEAPONS, COVERT, YOU KNOW, RAZOR SHARP NON-METALLIC. IT'S -- IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THERE'S NO USE OTHER THAN A WEAPON, THAT'S WHY IT WAS MANUFACTURED. MR. RAIA: I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, BUT THAT APPARENTLY IS IN THE EYES OF THE BEHOLDER AND, YOU KNOW, A FISHERMAN THAT GETS APPROACHED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT ON THE WATER MAYBE THEY, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NOT HAVING A GOOD DAY AND ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMEBODY'S HANDCUFFED AND THE POLICE OFFICER THOUGHT IT COULD BE USED AS A WEAPON AND NOW, YOU KNOW, YEAH, THE CHARGE WILL PROBABLY BE 18 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 KICKED, BUT YOU JUST COST SOMEBODY A DAY ON THE WATER. I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE STAGEHANDS, THE FOLKS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY. I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THERE'S AN EXEMPTION FOR THEM, BUT -- BUT OUR WELL-MEANING POLICE OFFICERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS, YOU KNOW, HAVE DISCRETION AND IF I'M CARRYING A, YOU KNOW, A -- A NORMAL CERAMIC KNIFE AND IT'S USED IN A THREATENING MATTER, THEN THAT'S CONSIDERED A WEAPON. SO, I AM A LITTLE CONCERNED. I, YOU KNOW, I KNOW THIS HASN'T PASSED IN -- YOU KNOW, HASN'T BECOME LAW IN THE PAST. IT PROBABLY WILL THIS YEAR AND I WOULD HOPE YOU'D CONSIDER SOME CHAPTER AMENDMENTS TO REFINE IT EVEN FURTHER. I'D LIKE TO SEE A PICTURE OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, QUITE HONESTLY. YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME CLAUSE, THINGS THAT YOU HOLD IN YOUR HAND, RIGHT, THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CUT A FISH WITH, THOSE ARE EASY, BUT THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE YOU'RE USING CAN APPLY TO ANY KNIFE AND THAT CONCERNS ME. BUT IN ANY EVENT, I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING MY QUESTIONS AND IT WOULD BE MY HOPE THAT WE'D SEE A CHAPTER AMENDMENT THAT FURTHER REFINES WHAT -- AND EXPLAINS WHAT A KNIFE THAT'S SOLE PURPOSE IS FOR A WEAPON. THANK YOU. MR. COLTON: YES, I WOULD CERTAINLY CONSIDER THAT, AND WE WILL LOOK AT THAT. THANK YOU. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MR. MANKTELOW. MR. MANKTELOW: YES, WOULD THE SPONSOR YIELD FOR A QUESTION, PLEASE? MR. COLTON: YES, OF COURSE. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MR. COLTON YIELDS. 19 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 MR. MANKTELOW: THANK YOU. AND I APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THIS BILL. JUST ONE QUICK QUESTION. IF I'M A MANUFACTURER IN NEW YORK STATE AND I MANUFACTURE KNIVES FOR OUR MILITARY, AM I GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO DO SO? MR. COLTON: YES, AS LONG AS YOU DON'T DO A PLASTIC KNIFE SPECIFICALLY TO BE USED AS A WEAPON, AND THAT IS DETERMINED BY THE WAY YOU ADVERTISE IT, THE WAY YOU SELL IT. A CERAMIC KNIFE PURCHASED IN BJ'S IS NOT MANUFACTURED FOR PURPOSE OF BEING A WEAPON. MR. MANKTELOW: OKAY, SO -- SO BACK TO MY QUESTION. SO, IF OUR MILITARY IS LOOKING FOR A CERTAIN TYPE OF KNIFE AND/OR WEAPON AND IT FALLS UNDER THESE PARAMETERS, AM I STILL GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO DO THAT AS A MANUFACTURER? MR. COLTON: YES. THE SECTION OF THE LAW OF THE PENAL CODE SPECIFICALLY EXEMPTS KNIVES TO BE USED FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OR FOR MILITARY. THERE'S A SPECIFIC EXEMPTION IN THE ACTUAL -- SECTION 265 OF THE PENAL CODE. MR. MANKTELOW: OKAY, I SAW THAT AND I WAS JUST QUESTIONING THE MANUFACTURING PART, BECAUSE I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T LOSE THAT. MR. COLTON: YES. MR. MANKTELOW: OKAY. I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. MR. COLTON: THANK YOU. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: READ THE LAST SECTION. THE CLERK: THIS ACT SHALL TAKE EFFECT NOVEMBER 20 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 1ST. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THE CLERK WILL RECORD THE VOTE. (THE CLERK RECORDED THE VOTE.) ARE THERE ANY OTHER VOTES? ANNOUNCE THE RESULTS. (THE CLERK ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS.) THE BILL IS PASSED. MR. RAMOS. MR. RAMOS: CAN WE GO TO RULES REPORT NO. 161, PAGE 6, MS. GLICK. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THANK YOU. THE CLERK WILL READ. THE CLERK: ASSEMBLY NO. A07169, RULES REPORT NO. 161, GLICK, JAFFEE, SIMON, BLAKE, DE LA ROSA, ENGLEBRIGHT, ROZIC, ORTIZ, CRUZ, WILLIAMS, EPSTEIN, REYES, GOTTFRIED, M.G. MILLER, JOYNER, RAMOS, FALL, FERNANDEZ, CRESPO, WEPRIN, GRIFFIN. AN ACT TO AMEND THE EXECUTIVE LAW, IN RELATION TO EQUAL PAY DISCLOSURE WITH RESPECT TO STATE CONTRACTS. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MS. GLICK, AN EXPLANATION IS REQUESTED. MS. GLICK: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THOSE BUSINESSES CONTRACTING WITH THE STATE TO PROVIDE DATA ON THE PAY FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES BASED ON RACE, GENDER AND, LET ME SEE, AND ETHNICITY AND TO PROVIDE THAT TO THE COMPTROLLER. THE PURPOSE IS TO INCENTIVIZE CONTRACTORS TO DEMONSTRATE HOW WONDERFUL THEY ARE IN 21 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 TERMS OF ELIMINATING THE WAGE GAP THAT HAS EXISTED PARTICULARLY BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN, BUT ALSO AMONG RACES. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MR. GOODELL. MR. GOODELL: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. WOULD THE SPONSOR YIELD? ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MS. GLICK, WILL YOU YIELD? MS. GLICK: OF COURSE. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THE SPONSOR YIELDS. MR. GOODELL: THANK YOU, MS. GLICK. AS YOU KNOW, THIS BILL CALLS FOR THE AVERAGE WAGE INFORMATION TO BE SEPARATED BY THE CONTRACTOR OR BY JOB CATEGORY AND THAT, OF COURSE, IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT BECAUSE YOU WOULD EXPECT TO PAY DIFFERENT JOBS DEPENDING ON WHAT THEY DO PERHAPS A DIFFERENT WAGE. WAS IT -- WAS IT YOUR INTENT THAT THEY WOULD USE A STANDARDIZED DESCRIPTION FOR THE JOBS? IN OTHER WORDS, FOR MANY YEARS WE USED TO HAVE THE DICTIONARY OF OCCUPATIONAL TITLE THAT LISTED ABOUT 12,000 DIFFERENT JOB CATEGORIES THAT WAS USED BY IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE SO THAT THERE WAS A UNIFORM DESCRIPTION FOR JOB CATEGORIES. SO, WOULD IT BE YOUR INTENT THAT A COMPARABLE DICTIONARY OF OCCUPATIONAL TITLES WOULD BE USED TO DESCRIBE THE JOB CATEGORIES? MS. GLICK: THE COMPTROLLER -- THIS FORM WOULD BE FILED WITH THE COMPTROLLER AND PRESENTED. IF THEY'RE -- ONE PRESUMES THAT THEY WOULD USE THAT STANDARD DELINEATION OF JOB CATEGORIES, UNLESS THE COMPTROLLER FOR SOME REASON DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT'S APPROPRIATE. 22 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 MR. GOODELL: THIS LANGUAGE REQUIRES THAT THE INFORMATION BE SUMMARIZED BY PAY AVERAGES CALCULATED BY GENDER, RACE AND ETHNICITY AND EXPRESSED IN ABSOLUTE PERCENTAGES. SO, WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT GROSS AVERAGES BY JOB, BY RACE, BY GENDER AND ETHNICITY? MS. GLICK: IT WOULD BE NON-WORKER SPECIFIC SO THAT THERE WOULD BE AN ABILITY TO, IN THE AGGREGATE, DETERMINE WHETHER THERE ARE DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE PAY THAT CONTRACTORS ARE PAYING TO THEIR EMPLOYEES. MR. GOODELL: I NOTE THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT EQUAL PAY, EQUAL WORK ISSUES, THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHER FACTORS OTHER THAN JUST THE PAY AND THE JOB CLASSIFICATION, SUCH AS SENIORITY, EDUCATION, EXPERIENCE. DOES YOUR BILL -- OR THIS BILL MENTION A BREAKOUT THAT REFLECTS ANY OF THOSE OTHER CRITERIA THAT ARE RECOGNIZED BY ALL OF US AS BEING RELEVANT IN DESCRIBING PAY DIFFERENTIALS, EVEN WITHIN A CLASSIFICATION? MS. GLICK: NO, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT DOES. IT WOULD -- THE CATEGORIES ARE THE -- WHETHER SOMEBODY IS MANAGERIAL OR IN A DIFFERENT CATEGORY. SO, TO SOME EXTENT, IT MIGHT REFLECT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE INSUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF PEOPLE IN A PARTICULAR CATEGORY OR THAT FREQUENTLY WOMEN OR PEOPLE OF COLOR DON'T RISE TO MANAGERIAL LEVELS AT THE SAME RATE OR TO THE SAME EXTENT AS MALE COUNTERPARTS. MR. GOODELL: DOES THIS PAY REPORTING REQUIREMENT APPLY COMPANY-WIDE OR IS IT JUST THE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE EMPLOYED IN NEW YORK, OR JUST THE EMPLOYEES THAT WOULD BE INVOLVED IN THE STATE CONTRACT? 23 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 MS. GLICK: IT IS NOT DETAILED IN THE BILL. THOSE WOULD BE LEFT TO REGULATIONS THAT WOULD BE PROMULGATED BY THE COMPTROLLER. MR. GOODELL: THAT'S A PRETTY IMPORTANT ISSUE, BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A LARGE NATIONAL CORPORATION, FOR EXAMPLE, AND WE REQUIRE THEM TO DISCLOSE ALL THEIR WAGE CATEGORIES FOR ALL THEIR EMPLOYMENT CHARACTERIZATIONS FOR ALL THEIR NATIONAL OPERATIONS IN ORDER TO BE QUALIFIED TO BID IN NEW YORK, BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE SOME OF THOSE NATIONAL CORPORATIONS BIDDING BECAUSE IT JUST ISN'T COST-EFFECTIVE FOR THEM TO COLLECT THAT DATA. IF WE COME BACK TO THIS AT SOME POINT, WE MIGHT WANT TO MAKE IT SPECIFIC THAT IT'S AT LEAST, AT A MAXIMUM, NEW YORK EMPLOYEES OR EMPLOYEES THAT PRIMARILY WORK IN NEW YORK. MS. GLICK: I HEAR THAT -- THAT SUGGESTION AND IT'S WELL-RECEIVED. MR. GOODELL: NOW, I THINK MY LAST QUESTION, HOPEFULLY - NOT FOR THE DAY, BUT ON THIS BILL - WE HAVE EXECUTIVE ORDER 162 THAT ALREADY REQUIRES SOME PAY REPORTING. HOW IS THIS BILL DIFFERENT THAN EXECUTIVE ORDER 162? MS. GLICK: WELL, THE EXECUTIVE ORDER IS A LITTLE MORE BROAD AND IS NOT -- LET ME -- THAT'S A VERY BROAD STATEMENT. I HAVE THE EXECUTIVE ORDER HERE AND IT SUGGESTS THAT THERE BE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED RELATED TO COMPENSATION OF THE INDIVIDUALS, BUT IT DOES NOT ACTUALLY REQUIRE THE -- THAT THERE BE A REPORT THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND, PRESUMABLY, THE COMPTROLLER WOULD PUT IT ON A WEBSITE 24 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 SO THAT INDIVIDUALS IN THE PUBLIC, TAXPAYERS WHO MAY WANT TO SEE HOW THEIR TAX DOLLARS ARE BEING USED AND WHAT THE -- WHICH COMPANIES ARE WORKING TO NARROW THEIR WAGE GAP, THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE. MR. GOODELL: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS, MS. GLICK. ON THE BILL. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: ON THE BILL, SIR. MR. GOODELL: I THINK ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES IN TERMS OF TRYING TO OPERATE THE STATE GOVERNMENT IS TO TRY TO OBTAIN THE BEST PRICE AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT ON STATE CONTRACTS, WE WANT TO MAXIMIZE THE COMPETITION. AND SO, WHEN WE IMPOSE DETAILED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ON THOSE WHO WANT TO BID FOR STATE CONTRACTS, IT HAS THE EFFECT OF DOING TWO THINGS: FIRST, IT RAISES THE COST TO THE STATE TAXPAYERS BECAUSE EVERY CORPORATION THAT THEN BIDS HAS TO INCLUDE IN ITS BID THE COST OF THE DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING; THEY DON'T DO IT FOR FREE. SO, THAT MEANS THE BID GOES UP. AND FOR SOME COMPANIES, THE TIME AND MONEY IT TAKES TO PUT THAT INFORMATION TOGETHER WILL MEAN THEY DON'T BID AT ALL BECAUSE THERE'S NO ASSURANCE THEY MIGHT EVEN BE THE WINNER. SO, THEY'RE JUST NOT GOING TO PUT THE TIME AND EFFORT INTO PREPARING THAT DATA. THE SECOND ISSUE THAT IS OF GREAT CONCERN TO BUSINESSES IS BUSINESSES DON'T WANT TO REPORT THEIR AVERAGE WAGE THAT THEY PAY FOR EVERY JOB CATEGORY BECAUSE THAT'S OFTEN VERY CONFIDENTIAL, IT'S VERY PROPRIETARY. AND THE LAST THING THEY WANT IS A PUBLIC DOCUMENT SHOWING TO ALL OF THEIR COMPETITORS WHAT THE AVERAGE WAGE IS 25 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 FOR EVERY ONE OF THEIR JOB CATEGORIES. AND IF YOU'RE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR, THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE YOU'RE PAYING A PREMIUM BECAUSE THEY HAVE REALLY HIGH SKILLS AND THEY MAY HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE AND A LOT OF SENIORITY, FACTORS THAT ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THIS LEGISLATION. AND ON THE REVERSE SIDE, YOU MAY BE A START-UP AND NONE OF YOUR EMPLOYEES IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE AND SO THAT WOULD GIVE A MISLEADING PERCEPTION THAT YOU DON'T PAY GOOD WAGES. FOR THESE REASONS AND OTHERS, THE BUSINESS COUNCIL IS VERY OPPOSED, AS IS THE ASSOCIATION OF GENERAL CONTRACTORS. AND ALL OF THOSE WHO ARE IN OPPOSITION STRONGLY CONFIRM THAT THEY ARE IN COMPLIANCE AND AGREE AND WHOLEHEARTEDLY ENDORSE EQUAL PAY TO EQUAL WORK, AND THEY ALSO NOTE THAT MANY OF THESE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO THE EXTENT THEY'RE RELEVANT ARE ALREADY COVERED UNDER AN EXECUTIVE ORDER. SO, I DON'T THINK THE BILL IS NECESSARY. I THINK IT HAS SOME REALLY DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS ON THOSE WHO ARE SEEKING TO COMPETE WITH US FOR STATE CONTRACTS. AND SO, THEREFORE, I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING IT. AGAIN, I APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MS. GLICK. MS. GLICK: LET ME JUST SAY THAT WE HAVE HAD MANY YEARS OF WAGE DISPARITY BASED ON GENDER, BASED ON RACE OR ETHNICITY AND, SOMETIMES, THAT SECRECY PERPETUATES THE DISCRIMINATION. AND SO, IT IS IMPORTANT, WHEN IT IS THE STATE, COMPANIES WISH TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE STATE, THAT THE STATE REQUESTS AND REQUIRES THAT THEY DISCLOSE THAT INFORMATION. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL BE A DISINCENTIVE TO -- AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, PARTICULARLY NOWADAYS I THINK PEOPLE WILL WANT 26 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY ARE TREATING THEIR EMPLOYEES FAIRLY AND DO NOT HAVE A GREAT DISPARITY BASED ON GENDER OR RACE. SO I WOULD URGE A YES VOTE. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: READ THE LAST SECTION. THE CLERK: THIS ACT SHALL TAKE EFFECT JANUARY 1ST. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THE CLERK WILL RECORD THE VOTE. (THE CLERK RECORDED THE VOTE.) ARE THERE ANY OTHER VOTES? ANNOUNCE THE RESULTS. (THE CLERK ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS.) THE BILL IS PASSED. MR. RAMOS. MR. RAMOS: MR.

ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: READ THE LAST SECTION. THE CLERK: THIS ACT SHALL TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THE CLERK WILL RECORD 27 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 THE VOTE. (THE CLERK RECORDED THE VOTE.) ARE THERE ANY OTHER VOTES? ANNOUNCE THE RESULTS. (THE CLERK ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS.) THE BILL IS PASSED. MR. GOODELL. MR. GOODELL: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER, FOR ALLOWING ME TO INTERRUPT THE PROCEEDINGS. BEHIND ME, AS YOU CAN SEE, WE HAVE 60 YOUNG AND ENTHUSIASTIC 4TH GRADERS FROM GREENFIELD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN SARATOGA COUNTY, WHICH IS IN ASSEMBLYWOMAN MARY BETH WALSH'S DISTRICT. AND THEY'RE HERE ON THEIR ANNUAL END OF THE YEAR TRIP TO THE CAPITOL AND THE MUSEUM. AND THEY ARE SO THANKFUL THAT WE'RE HERE WORKING AN EXTRA DAY JUST FOR THEM SO THAT THEY CAN SEE US IN ACTION. IF YOU WOULD WELCOME THEM, AND THEY'RE ACCOMPANIED BY THEIR 4TH GRADE TEACHER, DAVE SHIPPEE, AND SEVERAL CHAPERONES WHO ARE ANXIOUS FOR US TO CONTINUE. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: CERTAINLY. ON BEHALF OF MS. WALSH, THE SPEAKER AND ALL THE MEMBERS, WE WELCOME THIS 4TH GRADE CLASS AND YOUR TEACHERS, AND PARENTS I PRESUME ARE WITH YOU, HERE TO THE NEW YORK STATE ASSEMBLY. WE EXTEND TO YOU THE PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR, HOPE THAT YOU HAVE HAD A GOOD TRIP HERE IN ALBANY. YOU HAVE JOINED ON OUR LAST DAY, LIKE YOU WILL SOON HAVE THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL. WE'RE ALSO ANXIOUS TO GO HOME. AND HOPE YOU HAVE A GREAT SUMMER AND ALWAYS KNOW THAT YOU'RE WELCOME HERE. THIS IS THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE. AND PLEASE COME BACK AND VISIT US, AND GOOD 28 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 LUCK WITH A GREAT SUMMER AND A GREAT FALL SCHOOL YEAR. IT HAPPENS. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. (APPLAUSE) MR. RAMOS. MR. RAMOS: MR. SPEAKER, CAN YOU PLEASE RECOGNIZE MR. CROUCH FOR A BRIEF ANNOUNCEMENT? ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MR. CROUCH FOR THE PURPOSES OF AN ANNOUNCEMENT. MR. CROUCH: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. THERE WILL BE A REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE IN THE PARLOR IMMEDIATELY. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE IN THE PARLOR. MR. RAMOS. MR. RAMOS: MR. SPEAKER, THERE IS NO MAJORITY CONFERENCE AT THIS TIME. THE HOUSE WILL STAND IN RECESS UNTIL THE MINORITY FINISHES THEIR CONFERENCE. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THE HOUSE WILL STAND IN RECESS. (WHEREUPON, AT 11:24 A.M., THE ASSEMBLY STOOD IN RECESS.) * * * * * A F T E R T H E R E C E S S 12:26 P.M. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THE HOUSE WILL COME 29 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 TO ORDER. MR. RAMOS. MR. RAMOS: MR. SPEAKER, I'D LIKE TO CALL -- CALL UP CALENDAR 250, PAGE 50, MS. WEINSTEIN. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THE CLERK WILL READ. THE CLERK: ASSEMBLY NO. A05619, CALENDAR NO. 250, WEINSTEIN, PERRY, HYNDMAN, COLTON, ABINANTI, TAYLOR, WRIGHT, WALKER. AN ACT TO AMEND THE REAL PROPERTY ACTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS LAW, IN RELATION TO THE FAILURE TO RAISE THE DEFENSE OF LACK OF STANDING IN A MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE ACTION. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: ON A MOTION BY MS. WEINSTEIN, THE SENATE BILL IS BEFORE THE HOUSE. THE SENATE BILL IS ADVANCED. MR. GOODELL. MR. GOODELL: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. ON THE BILL. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: ON THE BILL, SIR. MR. GOODELL: WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS ALLOWS A PERSON WHO IS IN FORECLOSURE TO SAVE ONE OF HIS DEFENSES UNTIL RIGHT TO THE END, IF NOT EVEN PAST THE END OF A FORECLOSURE SALE AND SET ASIDE THE PROCEEDING. AND THAT'S THE DEFENSE THAT THE PLAINTIFF WHO IS BRINGING THE LAWSUIT HAS TO PROVE THAT THEY OWNED THE NOTE OR MORTGAGE, WHICH, BY THE WAY, THE PLAINTIFF HAS TO PROVE WHETHER OR NOT THE DEFENDANT EVEN APPEARS. SO THE WAY THE CURRENT LAW WORKS IS WHEN A PERSON 30 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 GOES INTO DEFAULT ON THEIR MORTGAGE, THEY RECEIVE A NOTICE, A 90-DAY NOTICE THAT SAYS YOU'RE IN DEFAULT, YOU NEED TO BRING THIS UP TO DATE. IF YOU DON'T IT BRING UP TO DATE, A MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE MIGHT OCCUR. AFTER THAT 90 DAYS WHEN THEY SERVE THE SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT, WHICH IS A SUMMONS, IT'S A VERY CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU HAVE TO ANSWER. IF YOU DON'T ANSWER WITHIN A CERTAIN TIME PERIOD, TYPICALLY 20 OR 30 DAYS, A DEFAULT JUDGMENT MAY BE TAKEN AGAINST YOU. THE COMPLAINT LISTS ALL THE FACTS THAT SUPPORT THE ACTION. IN ADDITION TO THE SUMMONS THAT IS NORMALLY SERVED, THERE'S A SPECIAL NOTICE JUST THE MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE ACTIONS IN BOLD PRINT THAT SAYS, YOU NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO THIS, YOU NEED TO ANSWER IT. IF YOU DON'T ANSWER, YOU'RE AT RISK OF LOSING BY DEFAULT. AND IF YOU DO APPEAR AND ANSWER, THEN THERE'S MANDATORY SETTLEMENT CONFERENCES WHERE THE COURT SUPERVISES DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE BANK AND THE PERSON WHO IS IN DEFAULT TRIES TO REACH A SETTLEMENT. AND IF THAT'S NOT SUCCESSFUL, THEN TYPICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THE LENDING INSTITUTION MAKES A MOTION FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF A RECEIVER. THE RECEIVER REVIEWS ALL THE FACTS, MAKES SURE EVERYTHING IS IN ORDER, CALCULATES THE AMOUNT DUE, REPORTS TO THE COURT AND THEY SCHEDULE A MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE. AND THE MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE IS TYPICALLY ON FOUR TO SIX WEEKS NOTICE, PUBLIC NOTICE AS WELL AS NOTICE TO THE DEFENDANT. AND AFTER THEY HAVE A FORECLOSURE SALE, THE REFEREE WHO IS IN CHARGE OF ALL OF THIS THEN MAKES A FURTHER REPORT TO THE COURT, ASSIGNS A REFEREE DEED AND THE PROPERTY TRANSFERS. UNDER CURRENT LAW, YOU CAN RAISE A QUESTION 31 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 CHALLENGING THE STANDING OF THE -- OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION IN YOUR ANSWER. YOU HAVE AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO FILE A LATE ANSWER AS LONG AS IT'S NOT TOO LATE. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO FILE A LATE ANSWER EVEN AFTER IT'S QUITE LATE, WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE COURT. YOU CAN BRING UP A STANDING ISSUE DURING THE PRE-SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE. THIS BILL SAYS THAT IF YOU DEFAULT, YOU CAN EVEN WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE FORECLOSURE SALE, AFTER SOMEONE ELSE HAS APPEARED, AFTER SOMEBODY ELSE HAS SUBMITTED A HIGH BID. WE ALREADY HAVE MULTIPLE SAFETY PROCEDURES IN PLACE, MULTIPLE NOTICES, PRE-TRIAL CONFERENCES, SETTLEMENT CONFERENCES. WHAT THIS DOES IS SLOWS THE ENTIRE PROCESS ONCE MORE BY SAYING YOU CAN SAVE THIS DEFENSE UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE THE FORECLOSURE, EVEN THOUGH YOU APPEARED ON EVERYTHING UP TO THAT POINT AND NEVER OPENED YOUR MOUTH ABOUT IT, YOU CAN WAIT UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE THE FORECLOSURE, KICK THE WHOLE PROCESS OFF ANOTHER FOUR TO SIX WEEKS, IF NOT MORE, AND IF YOU DIDN'T APPEAR, YOU CAN JUST SIT BACK, WAIT FOR THE PUBLIC NOTICE, WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE FORECLOSURE AND RAISE IT FOR THE FIRST TIME. SO, THIS IS AN AUTOMATIC ONE- TO TWO-MONTH EXTENSION FOR A PERSON WHO IS IN A HOUSE THAT'S BECOMING A ZOMBIE PROPERTY WITHOUT MAKING ANY PAYMENTS. THE CURRENT PROCESS WORKS. THERE IS MORE PROTECTIONS IN THE CURRENT PROCESS THAN ANY OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING AND THIS IS OVERKILL THAT WILL SLOW THE PROCESS FURTHER, DISRUPT THE PROCEEDINGS AND ADD UNCERTAINTY EVEN AFTER THE FORECLOSURE SALE OVER WHETHER OR NOT THE DEED IS VALID. FOR THOSE REASONS, I WOULD RECOMMEND A VOTE AGAINST IT. THANK YOU, SIR. 32 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: READ THE LAST SECTION. THE CLERK: THIS ACT SHALL TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THE CLERK WILL RECORD THE VOTE. (THE CLERK RECORDED THE VOTE.) MS. WEINSTEIN TO EXPLAIN HER VOTE. MS. WEINSTEIN: YES, THANK YOU. I WOULD URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO, AGAIN, SUPPORT THIS BILL AS -- AS WE DID PASS IT LAST YEAR. THE DEFENSE OF STANDING, WHICH MEANS THAT THE PLAINTIFF ACTUALLY HAS THE MORTGAGE NOTE AND IS IN PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF IT AND IS THE PROPER PARTY TO BRING THIS ACTION, MUST BE RAISED IN THE VERY EARLY PART OF THE PROCEEDING AS A FORECLOSURE PROCEEDING. AS WE KNOW, MANY DEFENDANTS DO NOT HAVE ATTORNEYS WHEN THEY FIRST ARE SERVED WITH FORECLOSURE NOTICES. SOME DON'T EVEN HAVE -- GET THE NOTICE AND BY APPEARING IN COURT, THEY, WITHIN SOMETIMES 20 DAYS OR 30 DAYS, WILL WAIVE THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE THIS DEFENSE OF -- OF STANDING. SO, THAT -- IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE LET PARTICULARLY UNREPRESENTED INDIVIDUALS, WHICH ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE FACING FORECLOSURE, HAVE THE ABILITY TO RAISE THIS DEFENSE AND NOT TO LOSE THEIR HOME BECAUSE OF A QUIRK IN THE LAW THAT REQUIRES THEM TO RAISE THIS EARLY. WE'VE MADE AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL THAT HAVE SATISFIED, THOUGH I DON'T BELIEVE THEY'VE WITHDRAWN THEIR OPPOSITION, BUT HAVE SATISFIED THE LAND TITLE PEOPLE WHERE THEY WANTED SOME EXACTITUDE, AND I WOULD URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MR. ABINANTI TO 33 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 EXPLAIN HIS VOTE. MR. ABINANTI: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I THINK THIS IS A VERY GOOD PIECE OF LEGISLATION; I COMPLIMENT THE SPONSOR ON THIS. I'D LIKE TO JUST SUPPLEMENT WHAT THE SPONSOR SAID. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IN LAYMAN'S TERMS, THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL EFFORT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PLAINTIFF IN THE LAWSUIT IS, IN FACT, THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PERSON OR THE BANK THAT DOES, IN FACT, OWN THE MORTGAGE. BECAUSE OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS THESE DAYS, THE BANKS PASS THESE THINGS AROUND. THEY DON'T ALWAYS PASS AROUND ALL OF THE PAPERWORK THAT'S SUPPOSED TO GO WITH THEM. AND WE HAVE MANY UNREPRESENTED INDIVIDUALS WHO GET -- WHO SUFFER FORECLOSURE FOR WHATEVER REASON. AND YOU'LL FIND SOMETIMES THE COURTS WILL APPOINT LAWYERS TO REPRESENT THOSE WHO DON'T APPEAR IN COURT, AND BY THE TIME THE LAWYER FINDS OUT THAT THERE'S A DEFECT, THE ENTIRE PROCEEDING HAS GONE ON BECAUSE THE BANKS OR THE PLAINTIFFS WHO ARE MOVING THE PROCEEDING IN THE FIRST PLACE, DON'T RESPOND TO THE REQUEST. SO, IT SOMETIMES TAKES A LONG TIME TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE BANK THAT IS, IN FACT, IN COURT DOES, IN FACT, OWN THE MORTGAGE AND DOES, IN FACT, HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE THE PROCEEDING GO FORWARD. SO THIS IS JUST AN ADDITIONAL PROTECTION TO MAKE SURE THAT THE -- IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE, THAT THE -- THE FORECLOSURE IS GRANTED TO THE BANK OR THE LENDER THAT HAS THE RIGHT TO DO SO. THIS WILL NOT TIE UP A PROCEEDING, THIS IS JUST MAKING SURE THE SYSTEM WORKS IN TODAY'S ELECTRONIC WORLD. SO, I -- I COMPLIMENT THE SPONSOR FOR PUTTING THIS IN, I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION. 34 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MR. ABINANTI IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. ARE THERE ANY OTHER VOTES? ANNOUNCE THE RESULTS. (THE CLERK ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS.) THE BILL IS PASSED. MR. RAMOS. MR. RAMOS: MR. SPEAKER, CAN WE GO TO RULES REPORT NO. 269, PAGE 9, MS. WEINSTEIN. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THE CLERK WILL READ. THE CLERK: ASSEMBLY NO. A05630, RULES REPORT NO. 269, WEINSTEIN, LUPARDO, ZEBROWSKI, TAYLOR, BRONSON. AN ACT TO AMEND THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW, IN RELATION TO REFORMING THE STATUTORY SHORT FORM AND OTHER POWERS OF ATTORNEY FOR PURPOSES OF FINANCIAL AND ESTATE PLANNING; AND TO REPEAL CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF SUCH LAW RELATING TO STATUTORY GIFT RIDERS. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MR. RA. MR. RA: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. WILL THE SPONSOR YIELD? ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MS. WEINSTEIN, WILL YOU YIELD? MS. WEINSTEIN: YES. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THE SPONSOR YIELDS. MR. RA: THANK YOU. I FIGURED RATHER THAN HAVING YOU DO AN EXPLANATION TO THIS SOMEWHAT OF A TECHNICAL BILL, I WOULD JUST, YOU KNOW, JUST LAY OUT A FEW QUESTIONS -- 35 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 MS. WEINSTEIN: SURE. MR. RA: -- SO WE CAN JUST -- FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR COLLEAGUES, UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS BILL DOES. ONE OF -- ONE OF THE PIECES, JUST IN TERMS OF THE STATUTORY GIFT RIDER; THAT IS REPEALED FROM THE BILL, CORRECT? MS. WEINSTEIN: CORRECT. MR. RA: OKAY. THE OTHER ISSUE AND THIS IS ONE THAT HAS -- THERE HAVE BEEN CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED WITH REGARD TO IS THE SIMPLIFICATION OF A POWER OF ATTORNEY. NOW I KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN CONCERNS RAISED BY MANY INDIVIDUALS THAT THIS PROCESS IS COMPLEX AND OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO EXECUTE POWERS OF ATTORNEY FOR VARIOUS REASONS, BUT -- BUT OFTENTIMES, YOU KNOW, THE COMPLEXITIES OF IT MAY -- MAY CAUSE SOME HARDSHIP TO -- TO FAMILIES AND, YOU KNOW, AND LOVED ONES OF INDIVIDUALS IN NEED OF A POWER OF ATTORNEY. SO, CAN YOU JUST GO THROUGH WHAT -- WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE HERE IS THAT AN AGENT WOULD BE ABLE TO SIGN FOR A PRINCIPAL EXECUTING THE POWER OF ATTORNEY? MS. WEINSTEIN: YES. MR. RA: SO UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, THOUGH, IS THERE ANY REQUIREMENT THAT THE PRINCIPAL, YOU KNOW, BE UNABLE TO SIGN FOR THEMSELVES? MS. WEINSTEIN: I -- I -- I DON'T THINK THAT THERE IS AN ACTUAL REQUIREMENT IN THE STATUTE, BUT WHEN THE AGENT SIGNS FOR THE PRINCIPAL, IT NEEDS TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED BY ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL. MR. RA: IT WOULD NEED TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED BY -- BY SOMEBODY ELSE. 36 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 MS. WEINSTEIN: SOMEBODY ELSE BEYOND THE AGENT. THERE'S AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT REQUIREMENT. MR. RA: OKAY. AND THE -- THE OTHER ISSUE IS THIS IDEA OF -- IT TALKS ABOUT SUBSTANTIAL CONFORMITY. MS. WEINSTEIN: CORRECT. MR. RA: NOW, I KNOW THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THIS IS AIMED AT ADDRESSING IS PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, EXECUTING A POWER OF ATTORNEY AND THEN THEY END UP IN A SITUATION WHERE SOME ENTITY, A BANK, WHOEVER ELSE SAYS, NO, THIS DON'T COMPLY WITH THE STATUTE, AND NOW THEY -- THEY'RE UNABLE TO CONDUCT WHATEVER THE TRANSACTION THEY'RE LOOKING TO CONDUCT. BUT ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT'S BEEN RAISED WITH THIS IS IF WE RELAX THIS, WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE BURDEN ON, WHATEVER IT IS, A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION OR WHOEVER ELSE HAS TO LOOK AT IT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL CONFORMITY. COULD THAT NOT BE OPEN TO DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS BY DEPENDING ON THE ENTITY THAT'S LOOKING AT IT? MS. WEINSTEIN: WELL, AS YOU SAY, MR. RA, THE CURRENT STATUTE REQUIRES EXACT LANGUAGE -- THE EXACT LANGUAGE, AND BECAUSE OF VERY MINOR LANGUAGE CHANGES THAT DON'T AFFECT THE -- THE SUBSTANCE OF THE POWER OF ATTORNEY, THOSE POWER OF ATTORNEYS HAVE BEEN REJECTED. SOME FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OFTEN HAVE ASKED FOR THEIR OWN FORM TO BE USED, BUT CLEARLY, IF THE PRINCIPAL IS NO LONGER COMPETENT, THEN THAT'S WHY THE POWER OF ATTORNEY IS BEING USED. YOU CAN'T -- THAT PRINCIPAL CAN'T NOW SIGN A DIFFERENT FORM. SO, WHAT \"SUBSTANTIAL CONFORMITY\" MEANS IS THAT MINOR TECHNICAL ERRORS WILL NOT INVALIDATE THE -- THE FORM. THERE IS A 37 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 PROCESS SET UP WHERE THE -- THE INSTITUTION THAT'S BEING PRESENTED WITH THIS POWER OF ATTORNEY THAT WILL MEET THE -- THE NEW STATUTE THAT WE'RE ADOPTING, CAN ASK FOR AN ATTORNEY'S LETTER TO VERIFY THAT THE -- THAT THE PERSON IS THE -- THE AGENT IS -- THAT THE AGENT IS ACTING AS DIRECTED BY THE PRINCIPAL. THEY CAN -- THEY HAVE SEVEN -- SEVEN DAYS TO LOOK AT IT, LOOK AT THE POWER OF ATTORNEY IF THEY HAVE CONCERN, GET THAT CLARIFICATION. THERE ALSO IS, IF IN GOOD FAITH AND ON THE FACE OF IT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S ACCURATE, THEY CAN ACCEPT THE POWER OF ATTORNEY WITHOUT HAVING NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THEM. I THINK IN THE PARA DYNAMIC, THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION HAS MORE OF AN ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO CHECK THE VERACITY OF THE -- OF THE POWER OF ATTORNEY VERSUS THE PRINCIPAL, WHO NOW HAS A POWER OF ATTORNEY THAT CAN'T BE -- BE USED. SO -- SO WE DO PUT IN PROTECTIONS, BOTH FOR THE PRINCIPAL SO THAT THERE ISN'T ABUSE, BUT ALSO FOR THE INSTITUTIONS THAT IN GOOD FAITH ACCEPT THESE POWERS OF ATTORNEY. MR. RA: OKAY. NOW, YOU MENTIONED THE -- THESE SEVEN DAYS. ONCE THAT SEVEN DAYS HAS BEEN, YOU KNOW, HAS ELAPSED AND, YOU KNOW, SUPPOSE THE INSTITUTION HAS NOT -- HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO, TO THEIR SATISFACTION, VERIFY THAT THE DOCUMENT, MAYBE THEY STILL HAVE A CONCERN. I MEAN, ARE THEY UNDER AN OBLIGATION TO ACCEPT IT, WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL PENALTIES IF THEY DON'T ACCEPT IT? MS. WEINSTEIN: IF -- IF THEY DON'T ACCEPT IT, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO INCLUDE IS THE ABILITY FOR THE AGENT TO START -- TO BRING A LEGAL ACTION ON BEHALF OF THE PRINCIPAL TO HAVE THE INSTITUTION ACCEPT THE -- THE POWER OF ATTORNEY, AND THERE WOULD THEN BE A PROCEEDING THAT WOULD NEED TO TAKE PLACE. 38 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 MR. RA: OKAY. AND THEN A -- A COURT WOULD -- WOULD DETERMINE WHETHER THE ENTITY IS ACTING UNREASONABLY AND IT COULD EVEN AWARD ATTORNEYS' FEES, AS WELL, CORRECT? MS. WEINSTEIN: ATTORNEYS' FEES, AS WELL AS DAMAGES. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, A CREDIT CARD PAYMENT WASN'T PROCESSED OR RENT PAYMENT WASN'T PROCESSED AND THERE ARE LATE FEES OR OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES THAT THE PRINCIPAL -- THE NOW INCAPACITATED PRINCIPAL INCURS BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE TO ACCEPT THE POWER OF ATTORNEY THAT SUBSTANTIALLY CONFORMS TO THIS STATUTE, YES. MR. RA: BECAUSE ONE OF THE -- ONE OF THE, YOU KNOW, ISSUES THAT, YOU KNOW, I'VE SEEN IN SOME MEMOS AND I THINK CONCERNS SOME OF US IS THAT, YOU KNOW, CURRENTLY IF YOU'VE GOT, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING IN THE CORRECT FORM, IT'S PRETTY CLEAR FOR -- THAT THE INSTITUTION, YOU KNOW, UNLESS THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY THAT WAVES A RED FLAG THAT SOMETHING LOOKS REALLY OFF, THAT THEY -- THEY CAN RELY ON THAT BEING IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATUTE AND MOVE FORWARD. YOU KNOW, A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION OR SOME OTHER INSTITUTION THAT'S PROCESSING A LOT OF TRANSACTIONS, YOU KNOW, MIGHT HAVE A LOT OF THESE THAT ARE -- THAT ARE, YOU KNOW, PILING UP AND THEY HAVE TO VERIFY THEM. AND I -- I'M CONCERNED WHETHER THE SEVEN DAYS IS SUFFICIENT FOR THEM TO -- TO DO THAT IN ALL INSTANCES. MS. WEINSTEIN: WELL, I WOULD JUST MENTION THAT THIS BILL WAS THE RESULT OF SEVERAL YEARS OF THE STATE BAR ASSOCIATION MEETING WITH STAKEHOLDERS, MEETING WITH, REALLY, A BLUE RIBBON PANEL TO DEVELOP THIS -- THIS NEW FORM TO ELIMINATE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS OF THE 39 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 FORM BEING -- THE POWER BEING REJECTED. AND WE WOULD ANTICIPATE, IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES THAT -- THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF CASES THAT THE FORM WILL BE IN -- AS PRESCRIBED IN THE STATUTE AND IT WILL BE IN VERY LIMITED CASES WHERE THERE WOULD BE A QUESTION ABOUT THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE FORM. I THINK THE BIG CHANGE HERE IS THAT WE WILL ALLOW PRINCIPALS, WE WILL ALLOW PEOPLE WHO ARE ELDERLY, WHO ARE DISABLED TO BE ABLE TO ACC -- HAVE THEIR AGENT ACCESS FINANCIAL -- THEIR FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS WITHOUT BEING FORCED TO HAVE TO SIGN A -- A POWER OF ATTORNEY THAT IS -- THAT INSTITUTION DEVELOPS WHEN THEY'RE NO LONGER COMPETENT TO -- TO DO THAT. MR. RA: OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR. SPEAKER, ON THE BILL. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: ON THE BILL, SIR. MR. RA: JUST TO REITERATE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS WITH THIS, YOU KNOW, ONE -- ONE OF THE PIECES ALLOWS AN AGENT TO -- TO SIGN ON BEHALF OF A PRINCIPAL WITH -- WITHOUT REALLY ANY -- WITHOUT REALLY ANY NEED FOR THE PRINCIPAL TO BE IN ANY WAY INCAPACITATED OR, YOU KNOW, UNABLE TO SIGN FOR THEMSELVES. BUT THEN FURTHER, THERE'S SOMETHING THAT, YES, THERE ARE TECHNICAL ISSUES TO -- TO POWERS OF ATTORNEY AND OTHER INSTANCES WHERE, UNFORTUNATELY, YOU KNOW, TRANSACTIONS ARE REJECTED FOR THAT REASON AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD WORK ON, BUT GETTING AWAY FROM KIND OF THE STANDARD COULD CAUSE AN ISSUE WHERE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, OTHER TYPES OF INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE TO RECEIVE A POWER OF AN ATTORNEY AND -- AND DETERMINE ITS VALIDITY HAVE TO REALLY SPEND SOME TIME VERIFYING THAT IF, YOU KNOW, THAT DOCUMENT WAS 40 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 SIGNED BY THE PROPER PARTIES AND COMPLIES WITH THE LAW SO THAT THEY CAN PROCESS THE TRANSACTION, WHICH REALLY COULD ALLOW, YOU KNOW, THIS INDIVIDUAL TO DO ANY NUMBER OF THINGS ON BEHALF OF -- OF THE PRINCIPAL. SO, FOR THOSE REASONS, I -- I HAVE CONCERNS WITH -- WITH THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THANK YOU, SIR. MR. GARBARINO. MR. GARBARINO: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. WILL THE SPONSOR YIELD FOR A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS? ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: WILL YOU YIELD, MS. WEINSTEIN? MS. WEINSTEIN: YES, OF COURSE. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THE SPONSOR YIELDS. MR. GARBARINO: THANK YOU, MS. WEINSTEIN. THIS IS GETTING RID OF THE STATUTORY GIFTS RIDER, CORRECT? MS. WEINSTEIN: YES, THE SEPARATE STATUTORY GIFT RIDER, AND IT DOES, AS RELATES TO GIFTS, ALLOWS THE -- THIS NEW STATUTORY FORM TO ALLOW -- TO INCREASE GIFTS WITHOUT THIS EXTRA GIFT RIGHT OR PROVISION WE HAVE NOW, ALLOWS THE DOLLAR AMOUNT TO GO FROM $500 TO $5,000. MR. GARBARINO: NOW, I KNOW A LOT OF SPOUSES, HUSBANDS AND WIVES, HUSBAND/HUSBAND, MARRIED COUPLES USE THIS FOR ESTATE PLANNING IN CASE THEY NEED TO DO, YOU KNOW, MEDICAID PLANNING, THEY HAVE THE SPOUSAL (INAUDIBLE) AND ALL THAT, AND IF SOMEBODY NEEDS TO GO ON MEDICAID, THEY USE THE POWER OF ATTORNEY TO TRANSFER THE ASSETS 41 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 FROM ONE PERSON'S NAME TO THEMSELVES. IF THEY HAVE THIS DOCUMENT AND RIGHT NOW YOU NEED THE STATUTORY GIFT RIDER, WHICH SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZES THE AGENT TO ALLOW TO MAKE TRANSFERS TO THEMSELVES WHICH, IF YOU PUT IN THE MODIFICATIONS TO MAKE UNLIMITED GIFT TRANSFERS, HOW DO THEY -- WITH THIS -- WITH US GETTING RID OF THE STATUTORY GIFT RIDER, HOW ARE THEY STILL GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT? OR IS THERE GOING TO BE A GIFT RIDER AFTER THIS, OR... MS. WEINSTEIN: NOT A GIFT RIDER, BUT THERE'S A SECTION FOR MODIFICATION SO THEY CAN -- THEY -- THEY CAN -- THEY CAN JUST INCLUDE IN THE MODIFICATION SECTION THAT -- THAT INFORMATION -- MR. GARBARINO: SO WHAT -- MS. WEINSTEIN: -- THAT ALLOWS TO GO BEYOND WHAT THE -- WHAT THE POWER OF ATTORNEY WOULD ALLOW IN TERMS OF JUST THAT $5,000 LIMIT. MR. GARBARINO: SO IN THE -- IN THE MODIFICATION SECTION OF THE POWER OF ATTORNEY THEY GET TO SAY, MY AGENT CAN MAKE UNLIMITED TRANSFERS OF ANY AMOUNT. MY AGENT CAN MAKE GIFTS TO THEMSELVES, MY AGENT -- SO ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE IN THE STATUTORY GIFT RIDER NOW, IN THAT SEPARATE THREE PAGE DOCUMENT, ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE PUT INTO THE MODIFICATION SECTION OF THE POWER OF ATTORNEY? MS. WEINSTEIN: YES, CORRECT. AND THIS WAY IT ALSO, YOU DON'T HAVE TO SIGN SEVERAL DIFFERENT DOCUMENTS. RIGHT NOW, AS YOU SAY, YOU HAVE TO SIGN THE POWER OF ATTORNEY, THEN THE GIFT RIDER -- MR. GARBARINO: AND THE GIFT RIDER NEEDS TWO 42 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 WITNESSES, I UNDERSTAND. MS. WEINSTEIN: RIGHT, SO THIS WILL ALL BE CONSOLIDATED INTO THE POWER OF ATTORNEY. MR. GARBARINO: BUT WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING THAT'S IN THAT GIFT RIDER -- IS THERE A REASON WE DIDN'T MAKE THAT PART OF THE POWER OF ATTORNEY FORM WHERE IT'S AN EXTRA -- IT WOULD JUST BE SOMETHING WHERE THEY INITIAL INSTEAD OF THEM HAVING TO HAVE -- HAVE TO PUT THAT IN THE MODIFICATION SECTION? MS. WEINSTEIN: YOU KNOW, THE INTENTION WAS -- WE HEARD, THE STATE -- WE HEARD -- THE STATE BAR HEARD FROM MANY PEOPLE ABOUT THE CUMBERSOMENESS OF THE -- THE SEPARATE GIFT RIDER AND THE IDEA IS TO GO BACK TO HAVING A SINGLE FORM AND JUST HAVE THAT -- THAT LANGUAGE ABLE TO BE ADDED -- ADDED INTO IT AND STILL HAVE THE PROTECTIONS OF A -- OF A GIFT RIDER. SO, IT HAS TO BE AFFIRMATIVELY ADDED. MR. GARBARINO: IT HAS TO BE AFFIRMATIVELY ADDED. OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. ON THE BILL, MR. SPEAKER. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: ON THE BILL, MR. GARBARINO. MR. GARBARINO: I REMEMBER WHEN THESE CHANGES CAME OUT, IT USED TO BE VERY EASY, IT WAS A ONE-PAGE DOCUMENT TO FILL -- FILL OUT FOR A POWER OF ATTORNEY AND THERE WERE SOME GOOD PROTECTIONS ADDED, I BELIEVE, BUT IT WAS -- IT IS -- WAS VERY BURDENSOME TO DO THESE DOCUMENTS. PEOPLE HAD TO SIGN THREE TIMES, INITIAL FIVE TIMES, IT WAS MAYBE SIX, YOU HAD TO MAKE SURE YOUR AGENT WAS THERE TO SIGN AND 43 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 ACCEPT THE POWER. I KNOW WE'RE KEEPING THAT -- MY CONCERN IS, THOUGH, ONE OF THE BIG THINGS WITH -- WITH ESTATE PLANNING FOR SPOUSES IS -- IS THIS GIFT RIDER AND BEING ABLE TO PREPARE FOR MEDICAID IN CASE ANYBODY NEEDS TO GO INTO A NURSING HOME, BUT -- BUT NOT LOSE ALL THEIR ASSETS, AND THIS -- THIS -- THESE TRANSFER RULES ARE VERY IMPORTANT. AND BY NOT SPECIFICALLY MOVING IT FROM THE GIFT RIDER TO THE POWER OF ATTORNEY, REQUIRING IT TO BE ADDED IN THE MODIFICATION CENTER, CONCERNS ME THAT THE WORDING MIGHT NOT BE CORRECT IF AN ATTORNEY DOES IT, THAT IF SOMEBODY DOES IT ON THEIR OWN, THE WORDING MIGHT NOT BE CORRECT, SOMETHING MIGHT BE LEFT OUT, AND THIS DOCUMENT THAT THESE MARRIED - OR EVEN NOT MARRIED, BECAUSE LOT OF TIMES, IT'S SINGLE -- PARENTS HAVE THEIR KIDS DO IT - THAT THESE ELDERLY PEOPLE HAVE THESE DOCUMENTS THAT THEY RELY ON AND SAY, OKAY, I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT MY ASSETS FROM MEDICAID SO MY SPOUSE OR MY CHILDREN CAN GET THESE ASSETS. BY NOT HAVING THE SPECIFIC WORDING IN THE ACTUAL FORM AND RELYING ON SOMEONE ELSE TO PUT IT IN AND MAKE SURE IT'S THERE, MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S THERE, I'M -- I'M CONCERNED THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO MAKE MISTAKES. I'M CONCERNED THAT A LOT OF THINGS ARE GOING TO BE LEFT OUT OF THE DOCUMENT AND THEN THESE DOCUMENTS THAT -- THAT THESE PEOPLE RELIED ON WON'T BE EFFECTIVE AND THEIR ESTATE PLAN WILL JUST BE BLOWN UP. SO I HAVE -- I AGREE WITH MAKING THE FORM EASIER FOR THE PERSON WHEN EXECUTING IT, BUT I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD LOOK AT AS A POSSIBLE CHAPTER AMENDMENT TO PUT THIS SPECIFICALLY IN THE POWER OF ATTORNEY FORM INSTEAD OF RELYING ON SOMEONE TO ADD IT, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S GOT TO BE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, 44 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 JUST THAT YOU AFFIRMATIVELY HAVE TO INITIAL NOW, SO THAT COULD'VE BEEN AN EASY FIX AND MAYBE WE CAN LOOK FOR A CHAPTER AMENDMENT IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THANK YOU, SIR. READ THE LAST SECTION. THE CLERK: THIS ACT SHALL TAKE EFFECT ON THE 180TH DAY. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THE CLERK WILL RECORD THE VOTE. (THE CLERK RECORDED THE VOTE.) ARE THERE ANY OTHER VOTES? ANNOUNCE THE RESULTS. (THE CLERK ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS.) THE BILL IS PASSED. MR. RAMOS. MR. RAMOS: MR. SPEAKER, CONTINUING ON THE DEBATE LIST, WE'D LIKE TO CALL UP RULES REPORT NO. 470, PAGE 15, BY MCMAHON, RULES REPORT NO. 467, PAGE 15 BY ARROYO, AND RULES REPORT NO. 434, PAGE 14, BY JACOBSON. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THE CLERK WILL READ. THE CLERK: SENATE NO. S05248-B, RULES REPORT NO. 470, SENATOR BIAGGI (MCMAHON, COLTON -- A08093-A). AN ACT TO AMEND THE LABOR LAW, IN RELATION TO PROHIBITING WAGE DIFFERENTIALS BASED ON PROTECTED CLASS STATUS. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MR. GOODELL. MR. GOODELL: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. WOULD 45 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 THE SPONSOR YIELD? ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MS. MCMAHON, WILL YOU YIELD? MS. MCMAHON: I WILL. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THE SPONSOR YIELDS. MR. GOODELL: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MS. MCMAHON. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING UNDER CURRENT LAW, IT'S ILLEGAL FOR ANY WAGE DISCRIMINATION TO OCCUR IN ANY NEW YORK EMPLOYER BASED ON SEX. IT'S THE EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK. THAT'S CURRENT LAW, BUT IT'S LIMITED TO -- BETWEEN THE SEXES, CORRECT? MS. MCMAHON: THAT IS CORRECT. MR. GOODELL: AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO EXPAND THAT ANTI-WAGE DISCRIMINATION TO INCLUDE ANY OTHER PROTECTED CLASS. MS. MCMAHON: YES, ALL THE PROTECTED CLASSES AS SPECIFIED IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS LAW. MR. GOODELL: AND IT -- IS IT YOUR INTENT, THEN, THAT THE SAME STANDARDS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN PLAY FOR DETERMINING WHETHER THERE'S A VIOLATION, WHICH IS EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK, WOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE SAME STANDARD, THAT WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE STANDARD UPON WHICH THAT CALCULATION OR EVALUATION IS MADE? MS. MCMAHON: WE ARE CHANGING THE LANGUAGE TO EXPAND THE EXISTING PAY EQUITY PROVISIONS TO REQUIRE EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK, OR SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR WORK, WHEN VIEWED AS A COMPOSITIVE SKILL, EFFORT AND RESPONSIBILITY AND WHEN PERFORMED UNDER 46 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR WORKING CONDITIONS. MR. GOODELL: SO THE REFERENCE TO \"SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR WORK WHEN VIEWED AS A COMPOSITIVE SKILL, EFFORT AND RESPONSIBILITY AND PERFORMED UNDER SIMILAR WORKING CONDITIONS,\" IS THAT THE EXACT SAME STANDARD THAT'S USED CURRENTLY BY THE FEDERAL EEOC IN EVALUATING PLANS UNDER EQUAL WORK FOR EQUAL PAY UNDER FEDERAL LAW? MS. MCMAHON: THAT LANGUAGE IS FOUND IN THE EEOC REGS, YES. MR. GOODELL: AND SO THIS BILL IS NOT IMPLEMENTING EQUAL PAY FOR DIFFERENT OR COMPARABLE WORK, WE'RE STILL IN THE EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK STATUS? MS. MCMAHON: THIS IS NOT A -- A COMPARABLE WORTH STATUTE, IT IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR WORK. MR. GOODELL: USING THE SAME STANDARDS AS THE FEDERAL EEOC DOES FOR EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK, CORRECT? MS. MCMAHON: THE SAME LANGUAGE, YES. MR. GOODELL: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ON THE BILL, SIR. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: ON THE BILL, MR. GOODELL. MR. GOODELL: I APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION FROM MY COLLEAGUE. WITH WE FIRST REVIEWED THIS LANGUAGE, THERE WAS A CONCERN WHETHER THAT LANGUAGE WAS INTENDED TO IMPLEMENT A COMPARABLE WORK STANDARD, WHICH WE'VE HAD EXTENSIVE DEBATES THAT HAVE GONE ON FOR MANY, MANY HOURS. AND UPON FURTHER REVIEW, IT 47 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 BECAME APPARENT, AT LEAST TO ME AND AS THE SPONSOR THANKFULLY HAS CONFIRMED, THAT WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE STANDARD UPON WHICH WE MAKE THESE EVALUATIONS, BUT WE'RE MERELY PICKING UP THE LANGUAGE USED BY THE FEDERAL EEOC IN EVALUATING THE FEDERAL STANDARDS FOR EQUAL PAY AND EQUAL WORK, WHICH REFLECTS THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE TITLE THAT'S PLACED ON A JOB CATEGORY, IT'S ACTUALLY A SUBSTANTIVE EVALUATION TO ENSURE THAT EQUAL PAY IS ACTUALLY BEING PAID FOR EQUAL WORK. AND BASED ON THAT CLARIFICATION - AND I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE'S COMMENTS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH - I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND RECOMMEND THE SAME TO MY COLLEAGUES. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THANK YOU, SIR. READ THE LAST SECTION. THE CLERK: THIS ACT SHALL TAKE EFFECT ON THE 90TH DAY. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THE CLERK WILL RECORD THE VOTE. (THE CLERK RECORDED THE VOTE.) ARE THERE ANY OTHER VOTES? ANNOUNCE THE RESULTS. (THE CLERK ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS.) THE BILL IS PASSED. THE CLERK: ASSEMBLY NO. A07936-A, RULES REPORT NO. 467, ARROYO, BLAKE, REYES, M.G. MILLER, D'URSO, GOTTFRIED, RIVERA, CRUZ, GLICK. AN ACT TO AMEND THE STATE FINANCE LAW, IN RELATION TO PROHIBITING STATE CONTRACTS WITH VENDORS THAT FORBID EMPLOYEES FROM LITIGATING DISCRIMINATION OR HARASSMENT CLAIMS. 48 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MR. GOODELL. MR. GOODELL: THANK YOU, SIR. ON THE BILL. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: ON THE BILL, SIR. MR. GOODELL: THIS BILL BASICALLY SAYS THAT ANYONE WHO WANTS TO CONTRACT WITH THE STATE OF NEW YORK CANNOT HAVE BINDING ARBITRATION INVOLVING ANY OF THEIR EMPLOYEES RELATING TO ANY CLAIMS INVOLVING DISCRIMINATION, SEXUAL ASSAULT OR HARASSMENT, NEGLIGENT HIRING, SUPERVISION OR RETENTION, OR SIMILAR MATTERS. AND IT'S IRONIC THAT TWO BILLS AGO WE VOTED ON A BILL THAT -- OR UPCOMING, I APOLOGIZE, WE HAVE A BILL THAT'S COMING UP AND WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY VOTED ON MULTIPLE BILLS THAT HAD MANDATORY ARBITRATION, MANDATORY ARBITRATION ON SALARY DISPUTES, MANDATORY ARBITRATION ON ANYTHING THAT WE THINK IS IMPORTANT. BUT ON THIS BILL, WE BAN MANDATORY ARBITRATION ON EMPLOYEE DISPUTES INVOLVING ANY CONTRACTOR WITH THE STATE OF NEW YORK. AND MOST PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES TO ARBITRATION, BUT ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES FOR BOTH AN EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYER IS IT'S NON-LITIGIOUS, IT DOESN'T INVOLVE THE COURTS, IT'S USUALLY FASTER AND LESS EXPENSIVE AND INVOLVES AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY. SO, FOR -- FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES WHO LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING BINDING ARBITRATION BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO HIRE A LAWYER OR FILE A SUMMONS OF COMPLAINT OR GO THROUGH THE COURT SYSTEM, THE BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISIONS THAT ARE SOMETIMES CONTAINED IN CONTRACTS ARE VERY BENEFICIAL, AND I WOULD HATE TO ELIMINATE THAT OPTION 49 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 FOR ANY EMPLOYEES. THANK YOU, SIR. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: READ THE LAST SECTION. THE CLERK: THIS ACT SHALL TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THE CLERK WILL RECORD THE VOTE. (THE CLERK RECORDED THE VOTE.) MRS. ARROYO TO EXPLAIN HER VOTE. MS. ARROYO: WELL, I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH MY COLLEAGUES. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MRS. ARROYO, MRS. ARROYO, BRING YOUR MIC UP. MRS. ARROYO: OH, MY MIC. HOW ABOUT THAT? ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THANK YOU. MRS. ARROYO: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE CONCERN OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE ABOUT THIS BILL, BECAUSE WE ARE ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. ALL OF US, EACH ONE, IS HERE TO REPRESENT THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT. IT'S MY FIRST BILL OF THE YEAR AND I'M HAPPY TO BE IN DISCUSSION WITH YOU. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS ALL OF YOU. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MRS. ARROYO IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. ARE THERE ANY OTHER VOTES? ANNOUNCE THE RESULTS. (THE CLERK ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS.) 50 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 THE BILL IS PASSED. THE CLERK: ASSEMBLY NO. A08228-B, RULES REPORT NO. 434, JACOBSON, BURKE. AN ACT TO AMEND THE ELECTION LAW, IN RELATION TO CHANGE OF ENROLLMENT BY PREVIOUSLY REGISTERED VOTERS. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: ON A MOTION BY MR. JACOBSON, THE SENATE BILL IS BEFORE THE HOUSE. THE SENATE BILL IS ADVANCED. MR. JACOBSON, A [SIC] EXPLANATION IS REQUESTED. MR. JACOBSON: MR. SPEAKER, THIS IS A MAJOR ELECTION LAW REFORM. AS OF NOW, IN ORDER TO CHANGE YOUR REPORTING ENROLLMENT, YOU CAN CHANGE IT UP TO THE 25TH DAY BEFORE AN ELECTION, GENERAL ELECTION. IT BECOMES EFFECTIVE AFTER THE GENERAL ELECTION. THIS BILL MAKES TWO MAJOR CHANGES. FIRST, ALL CHANGES OF ENROLLMENT WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, EXCEPT FOR THOSE BETWEEN FEBRUARY 14TH AND SEVEN DAYS AFTER THE JUNE PRIMARY. THIS IS A MAJOR ADVANCEMENT. THIS MEANS NOW THAT -- THIS IS A MAJOR CHANGE BECAUSE PREVIOUSLY WHEN WE HAD THE SEPTEMBER PRIMARY, THE CHANGE IN ENROLLMENT WAS 11 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE SEPTEMBER PRIMARY. IF WE DON'T PASS THIS BILL, THE CHANGE OF ENROLLMENT WILL BE EIGHT MONTHS BEFORE THE JUNE PRIMARY, AND WITH THIS BILL IT'S A LITTLE OVER FOUR MONTHS BEFORE THE JUNE PRIMARY. THIS IS A MAJOR CHANGE, A MAJOR REFORM. ALSO, BY HAVING THE FEBRUARY 14TH DEADLINE, THIS WILL NOW ENABLE MANY PEOPLE TO VOTE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY A LITTLE OVER TWO MONTHS OF A CHANGE BEFORE THAT PRIMARY. THIS LEGISLATION PRESERVES -- IT EXPANDS THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO CHANGE THEIR ENROLLMENT 51 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 WHILE SAFEGUARDING THE ENROLLMENT -- THE PETITION PROCESS, IT AVOIDS PARTY RATING AND, AT THE SAME TIME, ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MR. RA. MR. RA: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. WILL THE SPONSOR YIELD FOR A COUPLE QUESTIONS? MR. JACOBSON: ABSOLUTELY. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MR. JACOBSON YIELDS. MR. RA: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, AND THANK YOU FOR THAT THOROUGH EXPLANATION. AND I KNOW, AS MANY OF US KNOW, THAT -- THAT THE CURRENT -- THE CURRENT LAW, YOU KNOW, REQUIRES THAT IT TAKE -- BE DONE BY A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DAYS PRIOR TO THE GENERAL ELECTION, 25TH DAY, AND THAT IT DOESN'T TAKE EFFECT UNTIL THE NEXT YEAR. SO, JUST, THE FEBRUARY 14TH DATE, WHY IS THAT DATE CHOSEN? MR. JACOBSON: THAT DATE IS CHOSEN BECAUSE PETITIONS FOR THE JUNE PRIMARY WILL GO OUT AROUND THE 26TH OF FEBRUARY. IT CHANGES WHAT DAY THE JUNE PRIMARY IS BECAUSE IT'S THE FOURTH TUESDAY OF JUNE. THIS YEAR, IT WENT OUT FEBRUARY 26TH. THIS ENABLES TIME FOR THE BOARD OF ELECTIONS TO GET THE FINAL LIST OF VOTERS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE TO SIGN THE PETITION PROCESS. AND IT ENABLES PEOPLE ENOUGH TIME TO MAKE THEIR ENROLLMENT CHANGE THAT THEY DESIRE. MR. RA: OKAY. AND, YOU KNOW, AND AS YOU SAID, BASICALLY WHAT THEY DO EACH YEAR IN CALCULATING OR DETERMINING OUR POLITICAL CALENDAR IS THEY HAVE THOSE CERTAIN DATES IN STATUTE, WHEN PETITIONS ARE DUE AND -- AND THEN YOU WORK BACKWARDS FROM THERE. SO, I'M JUST CURIOUS, WHY -- WHY A DATE CERTAIN RATHER THAN, YOU KNOW, A 52 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 DATE TRIGGERED BY -- BY A MILESTONE IN OUR POLITICAL CALENDAR? MR. JACOBSON: I THINK BECAUSE IT GIVES CERTAINTY. I THINK IT'S EASIER TO TELL VOTERS, THIS IS YOUR DEADLINE. IF YOU START SAYING IT'S SO MANY DAYS BEFORE THE HALF MOON OR, YOU KNOW, DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF DAYS IN THE MONTH, I THINK IT'S TOO CONFUSING. I THINK IT'S BETTER TO HAVE A DATE THAT IS CERTAIN SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GO AROUND AND SAY, LOOK, YOU WANT TO CHANGE, IT'S FEBRUARY 14TH. MR. RA: THANK YOU, MR. JACOBSON. MR. SPEAKER, ON THE BILL. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: ON THE BILL, SIR. MR. RA: YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY WE'VE HAD A VERY BUSY SESSION WHEN IT COMES TO THE ELECTION LAW. I THINK WE STILL HAVE SOME THINGS TO COME WHEN IT COMES TO -- COME TO THE ELECTION LAW. SO THERE HAS BEEN, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF CHANGES THAT OUR VOTERS ARE GOING TO BE NOTICING AND SEEING AND IT'S GOING TO AFFECT THE WAY THEY PARTICIPATE IN OUR -- IN OUR DEMOCRACY. AND, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE THE NEW JUNE PRIMARY DATE, WHICH, YOU KNOW, WE'RE -- WE'RE SEEING FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WE WILL GO THROUGH A STATE CYCLE NEXT YEAR, ALONG WITH A FEDERAL CYCLE. AND -- AND I DO RECALL, YOU KNOW, IN 2016 PEOPLE SHOWING UP TO THE POLLS AND -- AND BEING SOMEWHAT FRUSTRATED IF THEY DID NOT REALIZE THEY WERE ENROLLED IN ONE POLITICAL PARTY OR THE OTHER. BUT I -- I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO KEEP IN MIND, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE STATES IN THIS COUNTRY THAT APPROACH THIS MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. THERE ARE STATES THAT, YOU KNOW, HAVE OPEN PRIMARIES, THERE ARE STATES THAT HAVE VERY CLOSED PRIMARIES. THERE ARE STATES AND DIFFERENT 53 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 PARTIES WHERE MAYBE THEY DETERMINE THAT -- THAT THEY WANT TO LET PEOPLE VOTE IN CERTAIN -- IN CERTAIN PRIMARIES. BUT THERE IS ALSO, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE THINK OF REGISTERING IN A POLITICAL PARTY, ITS PRIMARIES ARE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SELECT THAT -- THAT PARTY'S CANDIDATE. AND I -- I THINK OUR CURRENT SYSTEM DEFINITELY IS -- IS RIGID, AND PROBABLY TOO RIGID, TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE CAN MAKE THOSE CHANGES, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE ALL CHANGE OUR MINDS AND SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. AND MAYBE YOU FEEL, YOU KNOW, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS GONE TOO RIGHT OR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS GONE TOO LEFT AND YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR REGISTRATION. BUT WE ALSO, I THINK, NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT BEING DONE IN A MORE TRANSACTIONAL MANNER THAN, OKAY, I WANT TO BE ABLE TO VOTE IN THIS PRIMARY OR THE OTHER. SO, THAT IS ONE OF MY CONCERNS. I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A CONTINUING AREA THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT AS WE DEAL WITH ALL THE CHANGES IN REGISTRATION, DIFFERENT PRIMARY DATES AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS TO COME AS WE GO THROUGH A FULL, YOU KNOW, POLITICAL CYCLE WITH THESE CHANGES IN EFFECT. THANK YOU. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THANK YOU, SIR. MR. DENDEKKER. MR. DENDEKKER: WILL THE SPONSOR YIELD FOR A QUICK QUESTION, TOO? ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MR. JACOBSON, WILL YOU YIELD? MR. JACOBSON: ABSOLUTELY. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THE SPONSOR YIELDS. 54 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 MR. DENDEKKER: SO THE -- THE DATE IS FEBRUARY 14TH AND THAT WOULD BE BEFORE THEN AN IMMEDIATE ENROLLMENT CHANGE -- MR. JACOBSON: CORRECT. MR. DENDEKKER: -- UP UNTIL YOU SAID A WEEK AFTER THE PRIMARY? MR. JACOBSON: THAT'S CORRECT. MR. DENDEKKER: OKAY. SO WHAT HAPPENS A WEEK AFTER THE PRIMARY, SOMEBODY GOES BACK IN. IS IT THEN IMMEDIATE AGAIN? MR. JACOBSON: YES. MR. DENDEKKER: SO, IN THEORY, COULD SOMEONE REGISTER IN ONE PARTY ON FEBRUARY 13TH AND THEN AFTER THE PRIMARY, CHANGE THEIR REGISTRATION BACK TO A DIFFERENT PARTY AND THEN VOTE IN THE GENERAL? MR. JACOBSON: YES, THAT COULD HAPPEN, BUT IT... MR. DENDEKKER: AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE EVENT OF A SPECIAL ELECTION? MR. JACOBSON: EXCUSE ME? MR. DENDEKKER: WHAT HAPPENS IN THE EVENT OF A SPECIAL ELECTION? MR. JACOBSON: WHAT HAPPENS IN A SPECIAL ELECTION? THE RULES DON'T CHANGE. MR. DENDEKKER: SO IT WOULD STILL BE FROM THE FEBRUARY 14TH DATE TO THE DAY OF THE PRIMARY, ONLY BECAUSE THE SPECIAL ELECTION DOESN'T HAVE PARTY ENROLLMENT? IS THAT A PARTY PRIMARY? 55 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 MR. JACOBSON: NO, I DON'T -- I DON'T THINK -- IF SOMEBODY -- IF THERE'S A SPECIAL ELECTION AND THE SPECIAL ELECTION OCCURS BEFORE FEBRUARY 14TH, WHICH WOULD BE UNUSUAL, OBVIOUSLY SOMEBODY COULD CHANGE THEIR ENROLLMENT. BUT IF THE SPECIAL ELECTION OCCURS BETWEEN FEBRUARY 14TH AND THE JUNE PRIMARY, THEN THEIR ENROLLMENT CHANGE WOULD NOT TAKE EFFECT. THIS WAY, YOU CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE OBLITERATING THE WILSON-PAKULA AUTHORIZATION UNDER 6-120. SEE, PART OF THE REASON HERE IS WE -- IF -- IF YOU DON'T -- IF YOU DON'T CHANGE BY FEBRUARY 14TH FOR THE JUNE PRIMARY, YOU'RE NOT GETTING RELIGION IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE MONTH BEFORE, YOU'RE DOING IT BECAUSE YOU TO GAME THE SYSTEM, YOU WANT TO -- YOU WANT TO RAID A PARTY. IT MIGHT BE ONE OF THE MINOR PARTIES, IT MIGHT BE A MAJOR PARTY. YOU MIGHT HAVE -- YOU MIGHT ALREADY HAVE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION AND NOW YOU WANT TO GET INTO THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY. SO THIS WAY, WE PRESERVE THE PARTY -- WE PRESERVE THE PARTY STRUCTURE, THE PETITION PROCESS; YET, GIVING PEOPLE MORE CHANCES TO -- TO CHANGE THEIR ENROLLMENT. MR. DENDEKKER: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. JACOBSON. MR. JACOBSON: THANK YOU. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MR. JACOBSON. MR. JACOBSON: ON THE BILL. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: ON THE BILL, SIR. MR. JACOBSON: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I AM PROUD TO SPONSOR THIS MAJOR ELECTION REFORM BILL. THIS BILL WILL CHANGE 56 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 HOW REGISTERED VOTERS CAN CHANGE THEIR PARTY ENROLLMENT. NOW, A CHANGE OF REGISTRATION DOES NOT TAKE PLACE UNTIL THE TUESDAY AFTER THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION, AND THE CHANGE OF REGISTRATION MUST BE MADE 25 DAYS BEFORE THE GENERAL ELECTION OR YOU MUST WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE FOLLOWING YEAR'S GENERAL ELECTION FOR THE CHANGE TO TAKE EFFECT. THIS BILL MAKES TWO MAJOR CHANGES. ENROLLMENT CHANGES WILL TAKE PLACE IMMEDIATELY UPON RECEIPT BY THE BOARD OF ELECTIONS, EXCEPT THOSE RECEIVED AFTER FEBRUARY 14TH AND BEFORE THE 7TH DAY AFTER THE JUNE PRIMARY. PREVIOUSLY, CHANGES TO THE ENROLLMENT WE REQUIRED TO BE MADE, AS I SAID, 25 DAYS BEFORE THE GENERAL ELECTION, WHICH WAS 11 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE OLD SEPTEMBER PRIMARY. WITH THE CHANGE TO A JUNE PRIMARY AND WITHOUT THIS BILL, THE CHANGE WOULD BE EIGHT MONTHS PRIOR TO THE PRIMARY. AND UNDER THIS BILL, THE CHANGE WILL BE ONLY MADE ABOUT FOUR MONTHS PRIOR TO THE JUNE PRIMARY, AND THE CHANGE WILL BE ABOUT TWO-AND-A-HALF MONTHS PRIOR TO THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY THIS YEAR, WHICH IS SCHEDULED FOR APRIL 28TH. THERE IS A NEED FOR UNIFORM PARTY CHANGE PROCESS THAT APPLIES TO ALL PARTIES, AND THAT'S ESSENTIAL BECAUSE IMPLEMENTING DIFFERENT RULES FOR DIFFERENT PARTIES WOULD CREATE ADMINISTRATIVE CHAOS AND IMPOSSIBILITIES FOR BOARDS OF ELECTION THAT WOULD CAUSE VOTER CONFUSION. MORE -- MORE OFTEN, PARTY CHANGES OFTEN IMPACT MORE THAN ONE PARTY. IT IMPACTS NOT ONLY THE PARTY YOU'RE LEAVING, BUT THE PARTY THAT THE VOTER WANTS TO ALIGN WITH. THE CURRENT LAW AND THIS LAW IS INTENDED TO AVOID PARTY RAIDING, WHERE MEMBERS OF ONE PARTY CHANGE PARTY ENROLLMENT SHORTLY BEFORE A PRIMARY TO VOTE IN ANOTHER PARTY'S 57 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 PRIMARY IN ORDER TO EITHER SELECTED THE WEAKEST CANDIDATE AGAINST THE VOTER'S PREFERRED GENERAL ELECTION CANDIDATE, OR IN DIFFUSING VOTER CONTEXT, PROVIDE A SMALL NUMBER OF VOTES REQUIRED IN A SMALL PARTY'S PRIMARY TO STRATEGICALLY DELIVER THE NOMINATION. THIS HAPPENS MANY TIMES. YOU HAVE, ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU SEE 100 PEOPLE REGISTER IN THE GREEN PARTY OR THE REFORM PARTY, AND YOU KNOW SOMEBODY'S UP TO SOMETHING. AND SO, WE'RE NOT -- WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS THAT PEOPLE WOULD DECIDE JUST BEFORE THE PRIMARY, OKAY, THE OTHER PARTY -- MY PARTY DOESN'T HAVE A PRIMARY SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO RAID THE OTHER PARTY. IF -- IF WE DON'T PROTECT -- IF WE HAVE PARTY RAIDING, WE THEN MAKE THE POSSIBILITY OF A MINORITY PARTY TO BECOME COMPETITIVE, OR A MAJORITY PARTY IMPOSSIBLE. THIS BILL WILL PRESERVE THE VOTERS' OPPORTUNITY OF CHOICE AS OPPOSED TO ONE PARTY DOMINATING THE -- THE PROCESS, BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A TOWN OR A CITY WHERE ONE PARTY IS DOMINANT, IF -- IF YOU ALLOW A CHANGE JUST BEFORE THE PRIMARY AND NOW THEY THEN RAID THE OTHER PARTY, WELL THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE VOTERS WON'T HAVE A CHOICE IN NOVEMBER. THIS CHANGE -- THIS BILL -- THIS CHANGE IS INTENDED TO BALANCE THE STATE'S STRONG INTEREST IN THE INTEGRITY OF THE BALLOT, THE INTEGRITY OF THE PARTY SYSTEM AND THE RULES GOVERNING VOTER PARTICIPATION AND PARTY PROCESSES WITH THE INCREASED VOTER INTEREST AND PARTICIPATING IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS. THIS BILL IS ANOTHER MAJOR ELECTION LAW REFORM FOLLOWING OUR EARLIER SUCCESSES THIS YEAR IN ESTABLISHING EARLY VOTING, THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE 58 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 PRIMARIES, ALLOWING PEOPLE WHO MOVE FROM ONE COUNTY TO ANOTHER TO CARRY THEIR REGISTRATION WITH THEM, AND PRE-REGISTRATION OF 16- AND 17-YEAR-OLDS. WE ALSO TOOK THE FIRST STEP IN AMENDING OUR STATE CONSTITUTION TO ENACT SAME-DAY REGISTRATION AND NO REASON ABSENTEE BALLOTS. I AM PROUD TO HAVE SPONSORED THIS BILL AND I URGE ALL MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MR. SMITH. MR. SMITH: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. WILL THE SPONSOR YIELD FOR A QUESTION? MR. JACOBSON: SURE. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THE SPONSOR YIELDS. MR. SMITH: SO I THINK I HAVE A CONCERN WITH THIS BILL, AND I'M THINKING THROUGH IT AND I UNDERSTAND THE INTENTION; I THINK THE INTENTION'S GOOD. BUT MY CONCERN NOW, NEXT YEAR WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY AND IT'S LIKELY TO ONLY BE A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY, SO UNDER THIS BILL, WHAT'S THE STOP - I'M A REPUBLICAN - WHAT WOULD STOP ME ON FEBRUARY 13TH FROM SWITCHING TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, VOTING IN THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY AND THEN FOLLOWING WHATEVER DAY THE PRIMARY IS THE - I'M SORRY, THE JUNE PRIMARY - SWITCHING BACK TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY? MR. JACOBSON: BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE SMART ENOUGH NOT TO SWITCH AGAIN. BUT REALISTICALLY -- (LAUGHTER) MR. SMITH: TOUCHÉ. 59 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 MR. JACOBSON: REALISTICALLY, I DON'T THINK THAT THE PEOPLE SWITCHING IN A PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY WILL BE ABLE TO RAID THE PARTY HAVING A PRIMARY IN THE SAME WAY THAT YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO RAID THE PARTY HAVING A PRIMARY IN JUNE. IN JUNE, IT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO DO IT. IN A PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY, I -- I DON'T THINK YOU'RE VOTING FOR ONE OF THE DEMOCRATS OR GETTING SOME REPUBLICANS TO DO THAT IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT, IN THEORY IT COULD HAPPEN, BUT I THINK THAT THE -- THE REAL THING WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE PROTECTING THE -- OUR JUNE PRIMARY AND OUR PARTY PROCESS THERE. MR. SMITH: OKAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MS. BYRNES. MS. BYRNES: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. WILL THE SPONSOR YIELD? MR. JACOBSON: OF COURSE. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MR. JACOBSON WILL YIELD. MS. BYRNES: QUICK QUESTION, THOUGH, SIR. YOU INDICATED THAT YOU THOUGHT IT WAS UNLIKELY IN A PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY, BUT I THOUGHT YOU INDICATED IT COULD BE RIPE FOR ABUSE IN OTHER PRIMARIES. BUT ALL THE PRIMARIES NOW ARE IN JUNE. SO, THERE IS NO DIFFERENTIAL -- DIFFERENTIAL -- THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE AND PEOPLE COULD EASILY, IN LIKE A TOWN LIKE I HAVE WHICH IS DOMINATED BY REPUBLICANS, GO BACK AND SWITCH AND SAY, YOU KNOW, WE WANT TO GET THE DEMOCRATIC LINE, TOO, AND -- AND THEN RE-REGISTER AGAIN A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER. 60 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 MR. JACOBSON: WELL, THE PRES -- MS. BYRNES: IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT -- WE'RE NOT RESTRICTED ONLY TO LOOKING AT PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES, WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF OUR PRIMARIES. GOOD PEOPLE HERE WHO ARE REGISTERED DEMOCRATS, AND I AT ONE POINT IN MY POINT IN MY LIFE PARTICIPATED IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY, BUT YOU COULD ALSO HAVE THE SAME THING WHERE PEOPLE ARE SWITCHING INTO YOUR PARTY JUST TO RUN AGAINST YOU IN PRIMARIES NEXT YEAR FOR YOUR ASSEMBLY SEATS. SO, I THINK THIS IS -- JUST SEEMS TO BE RIPE FOR FRAUD UNLESS YOU ARE DISAGREEING, SIR. MR. JACOBSON: I THINK IT'S, FIRST OF ALL, I -- THE ORIGINAL BILL HAD IT THE 30TH OF DECEMBER, WHICH THEN WOULD'VE BEEN FURTHER, BUT I THINK THAT THIS BILL, WHILE IN THEORY THERE COULD BE SOME RAIDING IN THE PRESIDENTIAL, I THINK THAT IN REALITY, THE RAIDING CAN REALLY OCCUR WHEN YOU HAVE A PRIMARY WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF VOTERS. MS. BYRNES: RIGHT. MR. JACOBSON: SO -- SO WHEN YOU HAVE A SMALL NUMBER OF VOTE -- AND THAT PRIMARY FOR FEDERAL AND STATE IS IN JUNE; THE PRESIDENTIAL'S IN APRIL. SO, YOU REALLY WON'T BE ABLE TO RAID IT IN THE SAME WAY. I'M SURE YOU'RE GOING TO TRY, BUT I THINK THAT IN A SITUATION WHEN YOU HAVE A JUNE PRIMARY AND YOU HAVE -- AND SAY YOUR TOWN HAD 2,000 REPUBLICANS AND 1,000 DEMOCRATS, ALL RIGHT, AND NOW -- NOW THE -- NOW YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO BALLOT AND SO FORTH. IT WOULD BE A LOT EASIER FOR YOU TO RAID THE PARTY IF YOU WERE ABLE TO CHANGE A MONTH BEFORE THE PRIMARY THAN DOING IT BACK IN APRIL. THE MAIN THING IS WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE YOU -- WHERE 61 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 ONE NOMINEE THEN WILL CHANGE THE PARTY CLOSE TO THE PRIMARY OR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BALLOT PROCESS IN ORDER TO -- TO CORRUPT THE SYSTEM. NOW -- MS. BYRNES: BUT WE ARE MAKING IT FAR MORE LIKELY FOR IT TO HAPPEN UNDER YOUR NEW BILL THAN UNDER THE CURRENT EXISTING LEGISLATION, OR CURRENT LAWS. MR. JACOBSON: THAT'S TRUE, BUT WE'RE BALANCING THAT WITH THE INTEREST TO ALLOW MORE PEOPLE TO SWITCH THEIR PARTY CLOSER TO THE PRIMARY. IT'S A BALANCING ACT. SO, IT'S A BALANCING ACT. WE COULD HAVE KEPT IT THE WAY IT WAS AND IT WOULD BE EIGHT MONTHS AND THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE SAYING, BUT, YEAH, BUT WE'VE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WE'RE ENCOURAGING, FIRST TIME VOTERS TO GET INTO THE PROCESS, AND MOST PEOPLE VOTE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. SO, IT'S A BALANCING ACT AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID. MS. BYRNES: ON THE BILL. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: ON THE BILL, MA'AM. MS. BYRNES: JUST FROM THE BRIEF DISCUSSION I'M HEARING TODAY, I THINK THAT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US WITH THE PRIMARIES BEING MOVED UP, WITH THIS POTENTIAL CHANGE, COULD BE WAY MORE RIPE OURSELVES FOR PRIMARY CHALLENGES, BOTH FROM WITHIN AND WITHOUT. AND I THINK THAT THE INTEGRITY OF THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW, WHILE PEOPLE DO HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION WELL IN ADVANCE AS TO WHAT PARTY THEY WANT TO BELONG IN, THEY'RE MAKING A PHILOSOPHICAL DECISION THAT THEY WANT TO BE A REPUBLICAN, THEY WANT TO BE A DEMOCRAT, THEY WANT TO BE A CONSERVATIVE, THEY WANT TO BE A WORKING FAMILY MEMBER, AND NOW 62 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW MANIPULATION WHERE CURRENTLY AT LEAST MOST PEOPLE REGISTER TO VOTE BASED UPON PHILOSOPHY. IN THE FUTURE, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE SEEING PEOPLE DO IT TO MANIPULATE THE SYSTEM. I'LL BE VOTING AGAINST THIS. THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THANK YOU. MR. BLAKE. MR. BLAKE: ON THE BILL. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: ON THE BILL, SIR. MR. BLAKE: FIRST, I WANT TO COMMEND ASSEMBLYMEMBER JACOBSON FOR PUTTING FORTH THIS LEGISLATION AND I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ON SOME OF THE POINTS THAT ARE BEING RAISED AND COUNTER THEM VERY DIRECTLY. SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHY WE NEED THIS BILL, THIS IS IN CONTINUATION OF THE BILL THAT I PUT FORTH IN TERMS OF MOVING THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY ITSELF UNTIL APRIL 28TH. NOW, WHY WE HAVE TO DO THAT? WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS EASIER FOR MORE PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE. DOING THIS BILL, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT HOW THE FIRST CAUCUS IS ON FEBRUARY 3RD AND THE FIRST PRIMARY IS ON FEBRUARY 11TH, IT GIVES MORE LIKELIHOOD FOR PEOPLE TO BE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS THAN OTHERWISE. THE FEBRUARY 14TH DATE, AS WE SAW FROM LAST YEAR, THE TURNOUT WAS TRIPLE THE TIME OF A REGULAR ELECTION. AND SO, WE WANT MORE PEOPLE TO BE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS, FIRST OF ALL. SECOND, TO THE POINT THAT HAS BEEN RAISED OF PEOPLE JUMPING AND SWITCHING AND TRYING TO MANIPULATE, THAT IS JUST NOT THE CASE AND WE HAVE TO STOP THAT ARGUMENT AROUND FEAR-MONGERING THAT IS HAPPENING THERE. WHY IS THAT NOT THE CASE? BECAUSE AS BEEN STATED IN 63 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 THE MEMO, IT IS VERY CLEAR, IF YOU REGISTER AFTER THAT DATE, IT WOULD TAKE EFFECT AFTER THE JUNE PRIMARY AND SO, THEREFORE, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE SOMEONE THAT'S REGISTERING FOR ONE PARTY AND THEN MOVING AND MAKING A CHANGE FOR THE PRIMARY THAT'S HAPPENING IN JUNE. THE REALITY IS THIS: WE SHOULD BE MAKING IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE, NOT HARDER. WE SHOULD BE MAKING IT EASIER FOR YOU TO GET REGISTERED, NOT HARDER. WE SHOULD BE MAKING IT EASIER TO BE A PART OF THE PROCESS, NOT HARDER. THIRD AND FINALLY, WHY DO WE HAVE TO DO THIS? CURRENTLY, WE'RE IN A SCENARIO WHERE SOMEONE MIGHT BE REGISTERING IN OCTOBER, OR IN THE OTHER BILLS THAT HAPPENED EARLIER THIS YEAR, AT THE END OF DECEMBER, TO TAKE EFFECT FOR AN ELECTION HAPPENING NEXT YEAR. THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE IN ANY WAY. AND SO, BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE'LL BE GREATER PARTICIPATION, BECAUSE IT WILL BE EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO BE ENGAGED, AND, LASTLY, BECAUSE WE PUT IN THE SAFEGUARDS WHICH ARE REFERENCED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SPONSOR'S MEMO, THAT SOMEONE, WHEN THEY GET REGISTERED BEFORE AND/OR FEBRUARY 14TH, WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE THEIR REGISTRATION GOING TO THE JUNE PRIMARY. TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE OTHER SIDE, WE ALLOT FOR THAT PROTECTION. SO, TO CHAIRMAN LAVINE, TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER JACOBSON AND OTHERS ON THE ELECTION COMMITTEE, THIS IS A VERY STRONG BILL TO MAKE SURE MORE PEOPLE CAN PARTICIPATE AND MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE, AND I WILL DEFINITELY BE VOTING IN HE AFFIRMATIVE. THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THANK YOU, SIR. 64 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 MR. SMITH FOR A SECOND. MR. SMITH: WILL THE SPONSOR FOR ONE FINAL QUESTION? ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MR. JACOBSON, WILL YOU YIELD? MR. JACOBSON: SURE. MR. SMITH: OKAY, THANK YOU. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THE SPONSOR YIELDS. MR. SMITH: SO AS I'M THINKING ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE, ESPECIALLY WITH THE NEW TIMELINE WE HAVE FOR OUR ELECTIONS, SO NOW WE'RE GOING INTO 2020. I KNOW -- I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO MYSELF PERSONALLY, I'VE ENJOYED THE SUPPORT OF THE REPUBLICAN, CONSERVATIVE AND INDEPENDENCE PARTIES. NOW, OUR PETITION PROCESS FOR NEXT YEAR CONCLUDES I BELIEVE RIGHT BEFORE APRIL, THE END OF MARCH; IT'S ABOUT A MONTH PROCESS. SO UNDER THIS, IF I WERE TO, FOR EXAMPLE, GET WORD THAT I WAS NOT TO RECEIVE THE INDEPENDENCE PARTY'S NOMINATION NEXT YEAR, I COULD CONCEIVABLY SWITCH TO THE INDEPENDENCE PARTY ON FEBRUARY 13TH, STILL RECEIVE THE WILSON-PAKULA FROM MY OWN REPUBLICAN PARTY, CARRY PETITIONS - I'M A NOTARY PUBLIC, I CAN ACTUALLY CARRY PETITIONS THEN FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THE INDEPENDENCE PARTY. THE OPPORTUNITY TO BALLOT PROCESS, AT THAT POINT, WOULD BE NIL BECAUSE I WOULD BE ABLE TO THEN APPEAR -- MY NAME WOULD APPEAR ON THE INDEPENDENCE PARTY WITHOUT THE INDEPENDENCE PARTY SIGNING A WILSON-PAKULA. YOU KNOW, SO WITH THAT CONCERN, WITH RESPECT TO OUR MINOR PARTIES, DOESN'T THIS NOW ESSENTIALLY WITH - AND WE DON'T HAVE TOO 65 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 MANY MINOR PARTIES THAT ARE THAT SIGNIFICANT - ELIMINATE THE WILSON-PAKULA PROCESS. YOU KNOW, THE SAME SCENARIO COULD BE SAID WITH THE CONSERVATIVE ONE, IN MY CASE, THE WORKING FAMILIES LINE IN OTHER CASES. I IMAGINE, AS I MENTIONED, MY REPUBLICAN PARTY, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, MIGHT BE HAPPY TO SIGN A WILSON-PAKULA TO AVOID AN OPPORTUNITY TO BALLOT. WHAT'S TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING? MR. JACOBSON: THE ANSWER IS NO, YOU COULD'VE DONE IT THIS YEAR WITH THE OLD RULES. YOU STILL COULD'VE CHANGED AND FIGURED YOU WERE GOING TO GET ENDORSED AND NOMINATED BY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY; SO YOU COULD'VE DONE IT THIS YEAR. THIS IS A BALANCING ACT BETWEEN THE NEED FOR MORE PARTICIPATION AND SAFEGUARDING OUR PROCESS. MR. SMITH: OKAY. I MEAN, I THINK WITH RESPECT TO THAT, THE CONCERN, THEN, WOULD BE SOMEONE COULD SWITCH, ONLY BE A MEMBER OF THE PARTY FOR ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AND THEN SWITCH BACK TO THEIR ORIGINAL PARTY. I IMAGINE THE PRESS WOULD NOT REALLY APPRECIATE THAT, SO MAYBE THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING, BUT -- BUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR. JACOBSON: THANK YOU. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: READ THE LAST SECTION. THE CLERK: THIS ACT SHALL TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THE CLERK WILL RECORD THE VOTE. (THE CLERK RECORDED THE VOTE.) MS. SIMON TO EXPLAIN HER VOTE. 66 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 MS. SIMON: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL. AS SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW, I HAD A BILL TO CHANGE ENROLLMENT THAT WOULD'VE BEEN A SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME, 25 DAYS, WHICH I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED, BUT I DO UNDERSTAND THE COMPETING CONCERNS HERE AND I THINK THAT THIS WILL ACTUALLY MAKE A VERY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE AND BE SOMETHING THAT IS MANAGEABLE GOING FORWARD AND MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY REALLY UNDERSTANDS WHAT THOSE TIMEFRAMES ARE AND BE LESS CONFUSING FOR VOTERS. SO, I AM HAPPY TO VOTE FOR THIS AND ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO DO SO. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MS. SIMON IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. ARE THERE ANY OTHER VOTES? ANNOUNCE THE RESULTS. (THE CLERK ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS.) THE BILL IS PASSED. MR. RAMOS. MR. RAMOS: MR. SPEAKER, I'D LIKE TO CALL UP BILL NO. 567 ON CONSENT, AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO ON TO RULES REPORT NO. 499, PAGE 17 BY WALLACE; RULES REPORT NO. 404 -- 404, PAGE 13 BY PAULIN; CALENDAR NO. 325, PAGE 55 BY PEOPLES-STOKES; RULES REPORT NO. 334, PAGE 12, DINOWITZ; RULES REPORT NO. 1187 -- I'M SORRY, 487, PAGE 16, BY DINOWITZ.

AN ACT TO AMEND THE EDUCATION LAW, IN RELATION TO THE PRACTICE OF REGISTERED PHARMACY TECHNICIAN. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: ON A MOTION BY MS. ROMEO, THE SENATE BILL IS BEFORE THE HOUSE. THE SENATE BILL IS ADVANCED. READ THE LAST SECTION. THE CLERK: THIS ACT SHALL TAKE -- TAKE EFFECT ON THE 180TH DAY. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: THE CLERK WILL RECORD THE VOTE. (THE CLERK RECORDED THE VOTE.) MS. ROMEO ON THE BILL -- TO EXPLAIN HER VOTE. MS. ROMEO: THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER. I JUST RISE VERY BRIEFLY TO EXPLAIN MY VOTE. I WANTED TO THANK THE CHAIR OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE, STAFF AND ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT WORKED TO GET THIS BILL TO THE FLOOR THIS YEAR. LAST YEAR, WE RECEIVED SOME WORD FROM THE STATE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT THAT HOSPITALS AND PHARMACY TECHNICIANS WERE OUT OF COMPLIANCE, AND A LOT OF GROUPS CAME TOGETHER VERY QUICKLY TO PUT THIS LANGUAGE TOGETHER THAT WILL ALLOW NOT ONLY JOBS TO BE RETAINED, BUT ALSO TO AVOID FINANCIAL BURDENS ON HOSPITALS TO CREATE BOTH REGISTERED AND UNLICENSED PHARMACY TECHNICIANS TO HAVE STANDARDS OF PRACTICES CODIFIED INTO STATE LAW. AND I WANTED TO THANK EVERYONE THAT CAME IN SUPPORT ON PROTECTING THESE JOBS AND ALSO PROTECTING OUR HOSPITAL INSTITUTIONS. THANK YOU. 68 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MS. ROMEO IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. ARE THERE ANY OTHER VOTES? ANNOUNCE THE RESULTS. (THE CLERK ANNOUNCED THE RESULTS.) THE BILL IS PASSED. THE CLERK: ASSEMBLY NO. A06787-B, RULES REPORT NO. 499, WALLACE, EPSTEIN, MOSLEY, M.G. MILLER, SIMON, GOTTFRIED, L. ROSENTHAL, REYES, OTIS, SIMOTAS, QUART. AN ACT TO AMEND THE EDUCATION LAW, IN RELATION TO THE USE OF BIOMETRIC IDENTIFYING TECHNOLOGY. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: READ THE LAST SECTION. THE CLERK: THIS ACT SHALL TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: WE'LL WITHDRAW IT. AN EXPLANATION IS REQUESTED, MS. WALLACE. MS. WALLACE: THIS BILL DIRECTS THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION TO STUDY AND REPORT ON WHETHER THE USE OF BIO -- BIOMETRIC IDENTIFYING TECHNOLOGY IS APPROPRIATE FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND IF SHE DETERMINES THAT IT IS, TO DEVELOP GUIDELINES FOR SUCH USE. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: MR. GOODELL. MR. GOODELL: THANK YOU, SPEAKER. WOULD THE SPONSOR YIELD? MS. WALLACE: YES, I WILL. ACTING SPEAKER AUBRY: WILL YOU YIELD, MS. WALLACE? MS. WALLACE YIELDS. 69 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 MR. GOODELL: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MS. WALLACE. WHAT IS -- WHAT IS THE PUBLIC POLICY CONCERN THAT WE'D WANT TO STOP THIS TYPE OF IDENTIFICATION EQUIPMENT FROM BEING UTILIZED? MS. WALLACE: WELL, SO AS YOU MAY KNOW, SEVERAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE ALREADY TRIED TO ACQUIRE OR ARE INTERESTED IN ACQUIRING OR HAVE ACQUIRED WHAT IS COLLOQUIALLY KNOWN AS \"FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE\" THAT THEY PLAN TO USE IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AROUND THE STATE. AND RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY GUIDELINES WHATSOEVER ON THE USE. THERE ARE VERY -- THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RELIABILITY OF THAT SOFTWARE, THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW IT SHOULD BE USED, WHO IS GOING TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION AND SO FORTH. SO THIS LEGISLATION WOULD ASK THE COMMISSIONER TO LOOK MORE DEEPLY AT THE ISSUE AND TO DEVELOP A UNIFIED STATEWIDE POLICY -- UNIFORM STATEWIDE POLICY ON THIS ISSUE. MR. GOODELL: OF COURSE, AS YOU KNOW, A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CONCERN ALL ACROSS OUR STATE AND THE NATION, IN FACT, ABOUT SCHOOL SECURITY. AND THE QUESTION THAT MANY SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS ARE ASKING OF US IS SHOULDN'T WE UTILIZE ALL THE TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO US TO MAXIMIZE THE SECURITY OF OUR SCHOOLS? CERTAINLY WE HAVE NO OBJECTIONS TO VIDEO CAMERAS AND THEY'RE WIDELY USED TO HELP IN SCHOOL SECURITY. WE HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY IN OTHER WAYS THAT IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS. THE PROBLEM WITH A SECURITY CAMERA IS THE RESOLUTION IS NOT ALWAYS VERY GOOD; IT'S EASY TO CONFUSE PEOPLE. SO, MY QUESTION IS THIS: IF YOU'VE THROWN A STUDENT OFF OR YOU'VE HAD PROBLEMS, WOULDN'T IT BE A HELPFUL TOOL FOR A SCHOOL 70 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 THAT'S CONCERNED ABOUT SECURITY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS TYPE OF SOFTWARE AVAILABLE TO IDENTIFY THAT THE INDIVIDUAL THAT'S SHOWING UP, TRYING TO GET INTO THE SCHOOL, IS ONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY HAVE SERIOUS SECURITY ISSUES CONCERNING? MS. WALLACE: WELL, MR. GOODELL, AS YOU MENTIONED, ALL OF US WANT TO KEEP STUDENTS SAFE, RIGHT? AND I, MYSELF, AND I'M SURE MANY MEMBERS IN THIS -- IN THIS -- EVERYONE HERE HAS ADVOCATED FOR RESOURCES FOR OUR LOCAL DISTRICTS AND ALSO STATEWIDE TO HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACQUIRE THE TOOLS TO KEEP STUDENTS AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE. BUT, IT'S FUNNY THAT YOU MENTIONED ABOUT THE UNRELIABILITY OR THE LACK OF RESOLUTION ON REGULAR VIDEOS; IN FACT, ACTUALLY, THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW RELIABLE FACIAL RECOGNITION SOFTWARE IS. THERE'S A LOT OF STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT IT'S NOT THAT RELIABLE AND, IN PARTICULAR, IT'S LESS RELIABLE WITH REGARD TO CERTAIN GROUPS OF PEOPLE, CHILDREN BEING ONE OF THEM, WOMEN BEING ONE OF THEM, AND PEOPLE OF COLOR BEING ANOTHER ONE. SO -- SO ONE OF THE THINGS I'M ASKING THE COMMISSIONER TO DO IS LOOK AT THE RELIABILITY OF THE PARTICULAR SOFTWARE. IT COULD BE THAT SOME SOFTWARE IS VERY, VERY RELIABLE AND OTHERS ARE NOT. AND SO, PERHAPS WE SHOULD ESTABLISH A THRESHOLD OF RELIABILITY BEFORE WE EVEN ALLOW THESE TO BE ACQUIRED IN THE FIRST PLACE. YOU MENTIONED THE LIMITED RESOURCES. I MEAN, THERE'S ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN WESTERN NEW YORK AREA THAT HAS ALREADY SPENT $1.4 MILLION TO ACQUIRE THIS SOFTWARE WITH -- I'M NOT REALLY CLEAR IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH MORE MONEY IT'S GOING TO COST IN THE FUTURE TO CONTINUE TO UPKEEP THIS 71 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 SOFTWARE, WHO'S GOING TO -- DO YOU NEED TO PAY AN ADDITIONAL PERSON TO MONITOR IT, AND ARE THERE MORE EFFECTIVE AND MORE RELIABLE WAYS TO KEEP OUR STUDENTS SAFE AT A LESS EXPENSIVE COST? SO, WE WANT TO MAKE THAT WE'RE GOOD STEWARDS OF TAXPAYER RESOURCES AND THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO BE SPENDING EXORBITANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY, WE'RE DOING IT IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND COST-EFFICIENT MANNER IN THE WAY THAT'S GOING TO DEFINITELY KEEP OUR STUDENTS SAFE. RIGHT NOW, IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT A LOT OF THE -- A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ACQUIRING THIS SOFTWARE ARE JUST RELYING UPON THE REPRESENTATIONS OF THE VENDOR. AND WHILE I'M SURE THE VENDOR MIGHT HAVE GOOD INTENTIONS, ONE OF THE INTENTIONS OF THE VENDOR IS TO MAKE A PROFIT, RIGHT? SO, I WOULD LIKE SOMEBODY WHO IS A LITTLE BIT MORE DISINTERESTED AND TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AND TO DEVELOP SOME MORE STATEWIDE GUIDELINES ON IT. MR. GOODELL: YOU MENTIONED THAT ONE SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF HAS SPENT $1.4 MILLION. WOULD THIS LAW PREVENT THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT FROM BEING ABLE TO USE ANY OF THE EQUIPMENT THAT THEY'VE ALREADY SPENT $1.4 MILLION TO ACQUIRE? MS. WALLACE: YES, IT WOULD TEMPORARILY; YES. MR. GOODELL: AND DOES THIS, THEN, AUTHORIZE THE STATE TO REIMBURSE THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT THE $1.4 MILLION? MS. WALLACE: I THINK IF IT'S ULTIMATELY DETERMINED THAT WE WOULDN'T BE USING IT, THEN WE NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER THAT SHOULD HAPPEN, WHETHER THE SCHOOL SHOULD BE GIVEN A CREDIT, MAYBE, FOR A DIFFERENT KIND OF MORE EFFECTIVE, RELIABLE 72 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 SOFTWARE. BUT THAT CONVERSATION HASN'T TAKEN PLACE YET BECAUSE WE DON'T EVEN KNOW YET WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO SAY IT'S OKAY AS LONG AS YOU DO THIS, THIS AND THIS. MR. GOODELL: NOW, YOU MENTIONED THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS MOVED FORWARD. ISN'T THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LOCALLY-ELECTED BOARD OF EDUCATION RELYING ON THEIR SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT AND THEIR PROFESSIONAL STAFF TO DO A COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS? I MEAN, UNDER OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNANCE, DON'T WE PLACE THAT PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY ON THEM? MS. WALLACE: WELL, I THINK THAT THAT OCCURRED WITHOUT A LOT, REALLY, WITH ALMOST NO INPUT FROM THE COMMUNITY AND STAKEHOLDERS. AND I THINK THAT THIS, YOU KNOW, THERE NEEDS TO BE A BROADER CONVERSATION; IN FACT, SINCE I'VE INTRODUCED THIS LEGISLATION, THERE HAS BEEN WIDESPREAD SUPPORT FOR THIS LEGISLATION. I THINK EVERYBODY RECOGNIZES IT MAKES SENSE TO DO A DEEPER DIVE BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD. MR. GOODELL: IS THERE ANYTHING UNDER EXISTING LAW THAT WOULD PREVENT THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION -- I'M SORRY, THE STATE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT FROM ISSUING GUIDELINES OR MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS AREA? MS. WALLACE: THERE IS NOTHING, NO, BUT THERE'S NOTHING REQUIRING THEM TO DO THAT EITHER. MR. GOODELL: SO THEY CAN DO THIS WHETHER OR NOT WE ADOPT THIS LAW? MS. WALLACE: THEY CAN, BUT RIGHT NOW ONE OF MY 73 NYS ASSEMBLY JUNE 20, 2019 CONCERNS IS, YOU KNOW, I MENTIONED THE SCHOOL THAT HAS ALREADY SPENT A LOT OF MONEY. I KNOW THERE ARE OTHER SCHOOLS WHO ARE CONSIDERING THAT AND I THINK BEFORE WE LET THEM GO OUT AND EXPEND THIS MONEY WITHOUT KNOWING HOW RELIABLE THE SOFTWARE IS, WE SHOULD JUST PAUSE AND LOOK MORE DEEPLY INTO IT. BECAUSE IF WE LET OTHER SCHOOLS ACQUIRE IT, THEN THAT'S GOING TO EVEN COMPOUND THE"
