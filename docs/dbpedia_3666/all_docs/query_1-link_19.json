It's time to shed some light on this concerning issue and work together to protect our senior citizens! Elder abuse can take many forms - physical, emotional, financial, or even neglect. And sadly, it often goes unnoticed or unreported. It's essential to recognize the signs and take action to prevent and stop the mistreatment of our older population. üìç Together, let's educate ourselves and our community about elder abuse: üîç Recognize the signs: Keep an eye out for unexplained injuries, sudden behavioral changes, withdrawal from activities, financial exploitation, or a decline in hygiene. Trust your instincts and speak up if something doesn't seem right. üí¨ Speak up: If you suspect someone is being abused, report it to the appropriate authorities. You could be their voice when they're unable to speak for themselves. Remember, it's better to be safe than sorry. üö´ Break the silence: Don't shy away from these uncomfortable conversations. By openly discussing elder abuse, we can remove the stigma and encourage victims to come forward. Share informative resources, helpline numbers, or support organizations to provide assistance to those in need. üíô Respect and value our elders: Treat our senior citizens with the respect and kindness they deserve. They have a wealth of wisdom and experience to offer. Make an effort to spend time with them, check on their well-being, and ensure they have the quality care they need. üåê Spread the word: Share this post to help spread awareness about elder abuse and encourage others to take a stand against it. Together, we can create a safer and more compassionate world for our aging population. Remember, just one small action can make a significant impact in someone's life. Let's protect our elderly loved ones, ensure their well-being, and put an end to elder abuse, once and for all. üíú #ElderAbuseAwareness #RespectOurElders #StopTheAbuse\n\nNORM THERAPY¬ÆÔ∏è #1 IN ABUSE CARE Reporting early Child Abuse can help to prevent it. Each report could save a child's life. Watch the video to learn a second way to report Child Abuse. People often hesitate to report Child Abuse because they do not want to get personally involved in another family's home situation.

You raise awareness. But you can also prevent it (child abuse) by not letting it be a secret. The true character of a society is revealed in how it treats its children. Child abuse is one of those issues that's very difficult to talk about because it's surrounded by guilt and shame and so on, but us avoiding that issue doesn't help those kids in need out there who need support. Child abuse damages a person for life and that damage is in no way diminished by the ignorance of the perpetrator. It is only with the uncovering of the complete truth as it affects all those involved that a genuinely viable solution can be found to the dangers of child abuse. Whilst child abuse may be committed behind closed doors, it should never be swept under the carpet.I believe the best service to the child is the service closest to the child, and children who are victims of neglect, abuse, or abandonment must not also be victims of bureaucracy. They deserve our devoted attention, not our divided attention.If you can give your child only one gift, let it be enthusiasm.One person of integrity can make a difference.Don't forget that the most effective form of child abuse is giving a child everything they want.\n\nI've been seeing and hearing a lot about preventing elder abuse, lately... It's a big, complex issue, to be sure --from scams ('grandpa, I lost my phone and I need $1200 to...\") to misuse of funds through a Power of Attorney, using Grandma's property as collateral for a mortgage without their knowledge, and violence & neglect in care situations (at home and in institutions) there are so many ways the elderly and frail are vulnerable... But talking about prevention, I think we need to go to the source of where 'people think it's okay to treat people who are weaker and less able' comes from. Child care. When the care of children is still considered 'care' when children's dearest possessions and basic freedoms are used in punishments and threats, wherever it's still considered acceptable to hit people who are smaller or less capable 'because they're frustrating' or 'deserve it,' and whenever adults make self-serving decisions about children and their bodies (don't get me started on how intersex babies have been treated by the medical system 'so adults aren't embarrassed to talk about their non-specific gendered child's reality')... ...while any of this is still true and 'fine' and happening, we cannot be shocked or surprised by how those children grow up to treat their grandparents, or parents, in an equivalently-vulnerable state... Let's stop it at the source: treat children as the human beings they are <3\n\nü§ó This World Elder Abuse Awareness Day on 15 June, Redland City Council encourages the community to check in on our seniors. Elder abuse is defined as any act or lack of appropriate action, within a relationship of trust, which harms an older person. You may notice these changes in behaviour: üòü Fear of one or many persons üòü Depression, anxiety or withdrawal üòü Sleep patterns or eating habits üòü Reluctance to talk openly Respect, dignity and being safe means seniors have a right to: ‚úîÔ∏è Choose how their money is spent ‚úîÔ∏è Decide what happens in their home ‚úîÔ∏è Access the things they need ‚úîÔ∏è Being free to be with who they choose. ‚úîÔ∏è Decisions that consider their best interests If you have concerns, call the Elder Abuse Helpline on 1300 651 192 for free, confidential advice and referral. ü§ó Together, we can stop elder abuse.

The episode detailed a disturbing case in Houston, where maintenance workers discovered a two-year-old girl, bound and neglected, on the brink of death. As an ER doctor, I encounter various forms of child abuse, each leaving an indelible mark on my conscience. This particular case, where a child suffered unimaginable neglect and maltreatment, underscores the hidden horrors that some children endure in silence. This incident compels us to look deeper and act with greater urgency. It's a stark call to action for all healthcare professionals, educators, and community members to be vigilant and proactive. Recognizing the signs of abuse and knowing how to intervene can save lives. Through this post, I wish to spread awareness about our pivotal role in safeguarding children. Let's educate ourselves and our communities about the signs of abuse and the appropriate steps to report our concerns. Our collective efforts can make a significant difference in the lives of vulnerable children. Together, we can help prevent such tragedies and ensure a safer environment for our children. Let's pledge to be the vigilant eyes and compassionate hearts our children desperately need.

Is harm coming to their child. That harm could be as small as a fall. To something as tragic as the harm that came to this 15 year old girl. Reports suggest she rejected flowers from a 17 year old. I'm sure some harsh words were exchanged. And a big argument followed. But no child should go to school thinking it could be the final day. And so parent should send their child to school. Thinking they'll never see their child again. The loss of this young girl is yet another youth tragedy. And the impending prison sentence of the boy is also a tragedy. Have we reached a stage where our children are not safe? Have we reached a stage where even school journeys are not safe? What can we do about it? More parental awareness. More youth awareness. More school awareness. The discussion should never stop. The training should never stop. The simple fact is, we need to do more. Much more. Responsibility doesn't lie with one stakeholder. We're all in this together. Parents. Children. School. Police. The community. This article is simply heart breaking. We need to do more to keep our girls safe. We need to do more to involve our boys in the conversation. This isn't about demonising a gender. And turning girls into victims and boys into monsters. This is about working together to keep all our children safe. I've simply had enough of this. And I've had enough of worrying for when my children get older. People like me are available to speak in your schools. In your workplace. In your institutions. About how to keep children safe and to keep the conversation going. And this isn't a sales pitch. This is me reaching a stage of sadness. If your school or workplace isn't doing enough. Now isn't the time to remain silent. And hope that somebody else will do something about it. Now is the time to make something happen. To speak up. To take action. Because, God forbid, the next child could be yours. Or mine. Are we prepared to take that risk? #parenting #youthcrime #youthviolence #gangs #enoughisenough https://lnkd.in/ee_E65qh"
