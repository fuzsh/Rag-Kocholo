        "text": "MILBURN, Okla. (KXII) - According to Colorado’s Kiowa County Independent newspaper, 62-year-old Dewayne Scribner of Milburn was arrested last week on suspicion of numerous internet child sex crimes.\n\nThey report that last month, Scribner started chatting online with an investigator from the Kiowa County Sheriff’s Office posing as a 13-year-old girl.\n\nBecky Rasmussen with the nonprofit Call to Freedom said that these crimes are all too common.\n\n“By the grace of god, these weren’t real young girls but the reality is this is happening to real young girls,” Rasmussen said. “There are perpetrators who do not have good intentions ... and they will exploit and victimize young people.”\n\nAs the conversation progressed, Scribner re-engaged numerous times, even expressing interest in meeting the two younger “friends” of the decoy, ages 10 and 12.\n\n“He was offering them things that they may like, trying to make connection with them, actually asking for pictures as well,” Rasmussen said.\n\nThe chats continued getting more inappropriate, with Scribner describing what he wanted to do to the girls and offering them drugs like weed and meth.\n\nLast week, Scribner made the 9-hour drive to a motel in Eads, Colo. where he was arrested without incident.\n\n“We really need to realize that this addiction has no boundaries or borders,” Rasmussen said. “A lot of this is in the dark, it’s hidden and so they want to stay hidden.”\n\nIn Scribner’s vehicle, deputies found a loaded handgun, sex toys, Viagra, meth and marijuana.\n\n“There’s a lot of intersections between guns, drugs, and human trafficking,” Rasmussen said. “These individuals that are perpetrating these young kids, they don’t have any boundaries ... this is simply evil.”\n\nScribner is facing multiple felony charges including enticement of a child, internet sexual exploitation of a child, and inducement of child prostitution (attempted).\n\nAs of Monday, Scribner remained in the Prowers County Jail on an $8,000 bond.\n\nRasmussen said that education is key to keeping children safe from real online predators.\n\n“You have to trust your kids, but I would educate them,” Rasmussen said. “Be involved, create a safe place for your kids to disclose if something is happening ... but also equip them to make good decisions by attending a prevention training in regards to safety and healthy relationships.”"
