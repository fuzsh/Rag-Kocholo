        "text": "In an world filled with tumultuous events, we need to cling to hope in God. Fortunately, there are countless Bible verses about strength that are worth reading, pondering and integrating into our lives. The scriptures are filled with Bible verses that provide comfort and strength, especially in the hard times that we encounter. It’s essential that we remain steadfast when hard times hit and never give up — rely on God to navigate choppy waters.\n\nWant to dive deeper into Great American Pure Flix Originals? Subscribe to the Great American Pure Flix Insider email newsletter\n\nFor more hope and encouragement during hard times, Great American Pure Flix has a library of movies and shows that touch on these subjects and show how we can rely on God during these times. This includes fan favorites such as \"A Thousand Tomorrows,\" \"God's Country Song,\" and \"Vindication\" as well as new exclusives and originals including \"Finding Faith\" and \"The Blind.\"\n\nBible Verses about Strength in Hard Times\n\nIsaiah 41:10 (NIV)\n\n“So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.”\n\nFear can overtake us, but God is all-powerful and will offer us all the strength we need. Take this Bible verse about strength into account when you face tough times.\n\nIn \"The Blind,\" Phil Robertson was heavily into a life of imbibing on drink and partying when he hit his lowest point. He lost his wife, the love of his life, his job, his children and his finances. It was at this moment of fear that he was able to see God for who He truly is - a God who he could rely on for a firm foundation in strength and mercy.\n\nPhilippians 4:12-13 (NIV)\n\n“I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. I can do all this through him who gives me strength.”\n\nTrue happiness can be found in Christ. When you’re looking for Bible verses about strength, this scripture is an important one. No matter what you’re facing, turn to God and He’ll sustain you. In the Original series \"Vindication,\" Gary faces many trials - both on duty as a detective and at home with his estranged daughter. It's through his faith in God that he is able to be strong both on the job and as a father.\n\nPsalm 46:1-3 (NIV)\n\n“God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging.”\n\nThis is a powerful Bible verse about strength and comfort. No matter what life throws at us, we can have confidence that God will meet us where we are and guide our path forward.\n\nIn \"Finding Faith,\" faith-advice columnist Victoria has lost her hope after losing her mother and her marriage at the same time. Her world has been turned upside down and it's the first time in her life she's unsure if her faith is still firmly rooted in Christ. Through comfort, prayer and scripture, Victoria is able to see how God has always been her refuge and comfort, like Psalm 46 says.\n\n2 Thessalonians 3:16 (NIV)\n\n“Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with all of you.”\n\nPaul discusses prayer in 2 Thessalonians and promises believers that God will protect them from evil. In Paul’s final greeting at the end of the chapter, he offers well wishes, pining for God’s peace to be on readers. This is yet another powerful reminder of the Lord’s power over our lives.\n\nEven though Ali is dealing with a life-threatening sickness in \"A Thousand Tomorrows,\" she tells her husband, Cody, that she knows God is real because of the peave she feels inside. Peace doesn't come from external circumstances but our soul's internal posture towards our Lord God.\n\nPhilippians 4:6 (NIV)\n\n“Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.”\n\nUncertainty breeds anxiety — and anxiety can overtake us. Prayer is an essential ingredient to build strength and trust in God. During moments of suffering and worry, it is important to take grievances and fears to the Lord.\n\nIn \"Finding Faith,\" Victoria and her husband, Billy, have been trying for two years to reconcile and overcome the distance that has separated them. Victoria tells him and their mediator that she's afraid to trust him again because of their past. When she finally brings this fear to God, she's able to let go and trust God that this time will be different with Billy.\n\nDeuteronomy 31:6 (NIV)\n\n“Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the Lord your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you.”\n\nGod holds the power to give men and women strength and courage — essential ingredients needed to help push back against fear and terror. God never leaves us, as this Bible verse about strength proclaims.\n\nREAD ALSO: 5 Powerful Prayers For Heart Change And Life Transformation\n\nIn \"Moonrise,\" country artist Will Brown is still struggling with the grief of his wife's death. He is terrified to move on because of his perceived role in her passing. His inability to move forward causes him to be stuck in the past. When Will learns to let go, trust in God and His strength for each one of us, he finds that he is no longer afraid.\n\nMark 12:29-31 (NIV)\n\n“‘The most important one,’ answered Jesus, ‘is this: ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no commandment greater than these.’”\n\nAmong the more powerful Bible verses about strength in hard times are Jesus’ words in Mark 12. He boils down the most important commandments to this: love God and love others. If each of us relies on the first, the second flows naturally.\n\nIn \"The Blind,\" at Phil Robertson's lowest moments, he did the bare minimum to scrape by and be able to score his next drink. His sole focus was himself and his greed. Once he saw the light and proclaimed his faith in God, he learned how to put God first in his life and marriage and use his faith and talents to bring others to Christ.\n\nPsalm 22:19 (NIV)\n\n“But you, Lord, do not be far from me. You are my strength; come quickly to help me.”\n\nThis verse reminds us once again that God can quickly help us when we fall. In a world in which life can change in a split second, this Bible verse about strength reminds us that help can also quickly be found in the Lord.\n\nIn \"Finding Faith,\" Victoria struggles to hear and know that God is close to her after her mother is suddenly taken away from her and her marriage is falling apart. With the help of her hometown's preacher, she finds a way to call on God to be her strength and courage when she cannot find it within herself.\n\nIsaiah 40:29 (NIV)\n\n“He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak.”\n\nIn our weakness, we can find strength in the Lord. Life might get us down, but when it does we should reflect on Bible verses about strength to remember and rediscover Truth, as we take our struggles to God in prayer.\n\nIn the Great American Original Movie \"Sun Moon,\" Kelsey's sister, Liz, stand strongs for her when her fiance leaves her right before their wedding. Liz's strength helps bolster Kelsey during her hard time. The tables are turned when their mother dies. With their mother gone, Liz is the one who is weak and Kelsey is the one who stands strong for her sister. God gives strength to those who fall on hard times.\n\nLuke 12:25-26 (NIV)\n\n“Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life? Since you cannot do this very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?”\n\nWorrying can lead to emotional and spiritual paralysis. These Bible verses about strength and comfort remind us that worrying does little to change a tough situation. When fear creeps into your life, make an effort to take it to God.\n\nREAD ALSO: 5 Tips for Learning How to ‘Pray Without Ceasing’\n\nHannah in the Original movie \"Just in Time\" loves to be in control about everything, including her business and having a family. Her need for control causes her to worry and fret when things don't go her way. But she quickly realizes that not everything can go the way she plans for it all the time. This Bible verse reminds us that when we continue to seek control and worry that our live isn't going the way we want, we're not truly putting our trust in God. Instead, Bible verses about strength in hard times remind us those time when we feel most \"out of control,\" we must have faith and trust in God and His will for our lives.\n\nIsaiah 12:2 (NIV)\n\n“Surely God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid. The Lord, the Lord himself, is my strength and my defense; he has become my salvation.”\n\nWhere do you find your strength? Throughout the Old and New Testaments, it’s clear that God wants us to rely on Him and to see Him as our defense in all we face.\n\nIn \"The Blind,\" Phil Robertson rebuilds his foundation on his faith in the Lord after he is baptized. He knows that he would not have gotten out of the dark path he was walking if it were not for the salvation and redemption the Lord has shown him. When he repented and focused his life on Christ, his strength and hope were renewed. Christ and his redemption helped him to bring back his family and his success.\n\nJohn 16:33 (NIV)\n\n“I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.”\n\nWhen life feels oppressive or situations become difficult, it is often helpful to remember what Christ went through — and His victory. Our reliance on Him can then help guide us through the darkest of times.\n\nIn \"Finding Faith,\" Victoria is feeling distance with God after her mom's passing and her marriage is struggling. While visiting her father back home, she tries to find God but is consumed by the past hurts life has thrown her way. During this dark time is when she prays the hardest and looks for Him the most, so that she can lean on Him and feel His strength, peace and comfort.\n\nProverbs 18:10 (NIV)\n\n“The name of the Lord is a fortified tower; the righteous run to it and are safe.”\n\nAmong the many Bible verses about strength in hard times are those that urge us to see God as a shield or fortress. Proverbs 18:10 is just one of the verses that helps bring this concept to life.\n\nIn \"Just in Time,\" married couple Hannah and Rowan have a hard time connecting anymore. Rowan feels like they're on two different pages about what they want from their relationship. After the events that take place on Easter weekend lead them back to being closer together, the couple realizes the foundation of their relationship wasn't firmly rooted in the Lord. This Bible verse about strength reminds us that when we build our foundation on the Lord, He is a \"fortified tower\" that we can always trust to guide our ways.\n\n1 Peter 4:11 (NIV)\n\n“If anyone speaks, they should do so as one who speaks the very words of God. If anyone serves, they should do so with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen.”\n\nThe chaos of life can sometimes distract us from God and Truth. But Peter reminds us that we should always rely on God to fulfill tasks and duties. It’s the Lord’s power that sustains us and when we rely on Him, we can be sure that we’re on track to achieve His plan for our lives.\n\nIn \"The Girl Who Believes in Miracles,\" Sara asks God to answer larger-than-life prayers. She believes in Him so wholeheartedly, in His goodness, love and mercy that she is not afraid to ask Him to provide in the hardest of situations.\n\nPsalm 32:7-8 (NIV)\n\n“You are my hiding place; you will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance. I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will counsel you with my loving eye on you.”\n\nThis Bible verse about strength and comfort calls God our “hiding place” and promises His protection for those who seek Him. With God’s counsel, our lives are full and complete.\n\nIn the Original series \"A Thousand Tomorrows,\" despite the troubles Ali Daniels is battling with her life-threatening disease, she continues to stay close to the Lord. Ali knows that her faith is the single thing that can give her hope, peace and strength during this hard time. She seeks God and asks Him to always be with her.\n\nExodus 15:2 (NIV)\n\n“The Lord is my strength and my defense; he has become my salvation. He is my God, and I will praise him, my father’s God, and I will exalt him.”\n\nPraising God means seeking His face as we navigate life. It also means abiding by His standards and understanding that His plans might not be our own. As we learn to exalt God, we are able to live our lives to the fullest.\n\nIn \"Finding Faith,\" Victoria has a hard time seeking God while her world is crumbling around her. She tries as hard as she can to seek Him in her crisis of faith but has truthfully lost hope. Despite her circumstance, she still truly believes God is there in her midst and with her through her hard times. She knows that while she may not be able to hear Him, He has never abandoned her.\n\n2 Corinthians 12:9-10 (NIV)\n\n“But he said to me, ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.’ Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me. That is why, for Christ’s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.”\n\nThe Christian walk can be challenging, with Paul reminding believers that, despite the difficulties, he finds strength in the Lord. It’s important to remember that accepting Christ doesn’t mean life will be simple — but that, through God, we will be sustained.\n\nIn the Original series, \"Sons of Thunder,\" after being released from prison, a former biker gang member tracks down his ex-fiancé at a ranch on the brink of foreclosure to reconcile, but the biker gang that he betrayed isn’t far behind. Jacob finds the strength to face them through his faith in God.\n\nEphesians 3:16 (NIV)\n\n“I pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit in your inner being.”\n\nThe Holy Spirit isn’t merely a relic of the past; it’s something believers are called to accept in their hearts — and it’s a guiding light that assists in our everyday lives. The Holy Spirit can help change hearts and minds.\n\nIn \"The Blind,\" Phil Robertson has gone down a dark path that has led him away from God, his family and his children. At his lowest point, he realizes that he needs to change his ways if he wants to truly get back his family. This movement of the Holy Spirit led him to a journey of redemption and salvation. His story is a unbelievable testimony to the work the Spirit can do to change the hearts and minds of many.\n\nPsalm 18:32 (NIV)\n\n“It is God who arms me with strength and keeps my way secure.”\n\nIt’s essential to put on the armor of God when it comes to navigating the day-to-day issues we face. The best way to be sure that our ways are kept “secure” is to check in with God throughout each and every day. You can check in with prayer, scripture reading, listening to Christian music or by watching Christian-themed movies and shows.\n\nHabakkuk 3:19 (NIV)\n\n“The Sovereign Lord is my strength; he makes my feet like the feet of a deer, he enables me to tread on the heights.”\n\nLife sometimes leaves us with an array of questions, especially when we face pain. One special Bible verse about strength is Habakkuk 3:19. While the Prophet Habakkuk had questions for God about why his people were suffering in captivity, he also relied on the Lord for his strength. We should do the same, even when we grapple with difficult questions.\n\nIn \"Just in Time,\" Hannah is grappling to answer why her marriage is strained, work is overwhelming and her life hasn't turned out the way she dreamed it would be. Her questions bring her to meeting a man named Franklin, who helps her find her way back to God and to understanding that suffering will occur, but it's with God's strength that we're able to get through those hard times.\n\nJoshua 1:9 (NIV)\n\n“Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.”\n\nThe final Bible verse about strength is Joshua 1:9, which implores us to be both strong and courageous, pushing fear and discouragement to the side. God never leaves nor forsakes us — and that’s an important reality to remember."
