        "text": "The Out-Laws SEX/NUDITY 5\n\n– A man in a restaurant pretends to choke himself and mimics masturbation with his hands in front of his crotch, as a woman looks disgusted. A clothed woman under covers in a bed sits on a man’s groin and twists his ears as he moans sexually. A man yells and thrusts his pelvis. A woman slaps a man on the buttocks. A clothed woman licks two keys, presses them to her chest and grunts loudly while opening a safe (seeming to imply sexual activity).\n\n► Two different couples kiss for a few seconds in different scenes. An older man kisses a younger man on the mouth for five seconds and laughs. A man kisses an older man, who complains about the younger man “using tongue.”\n\n► A man sings about having sex with his fiancée, his in-laws walk in and he is embarrassed. A woman’s mother says she participated in an orgy with a famous football player. A man says another man fantasizes with a mannequin or blow-up doll. A woman talks about masturbating and lactating.\n\n► A woman wears mid-thigh shorts and a man turns away from the camera and lifts his shirt to show hair below the waist extending into his trousers.\n\nThe Out-Laws VIOLENCE/GORE 5\n\n– In two scenes a man shoots a second man in the forehead at close range and blood spurts from the back of the head as the victim dies. A robber shoots two men dead in a warehouse and they fall (without visible blood).\n\n► Two armed bank robbers point guns at men and women as they run to the back of the bank and get on the floor. Two armed bank robbers enter a bank and punch two guards unconscious. A woman pulls out two large handguns from under a baggy shirt and shoots the ceiling as people in a bank scream, a robber flips a man to the floor, the bank manager is sprayed in the face by a dye-packet and cries, and another robber is tossed into three different walls until his attacker has a heart attack and falls; the robber performs CPR and revives him. Robbers steal an armored car and are chased by police cars as money flies out the back, a cruiser flips over and another armored car flips over (no injuries are seen), an armored car breaks through a cemetery’s wall, destroys headstones, pushes a coffin into a hole before coming to a stop and the robbers walk away as we hear a pop and see smoke puff from their vehicle.\n\n► A woman and several armed people enter a building and kidnap a woman at gunpoint and the first woman threatens to kill the victim a couple of times; a swat team enters with automatic rifles and open fire while fistfights occur outside in the street (several people fall, but without visible blood), many glass tables and windows shatter loudly as people yell, a man is flipped over and we see punches and head-butting. At a dinner party in a restaurant, flames rise in the background and a man’s shirt sleeve catches fire; a woman squirts oil onto his arm and his entire arm in flames as the scene ends (he is not injured). In a kitchen, a man is startled by guests, screams, and falls to the floor without injury. A woman bangs her head on a counter and is not hurt. A woman pours red syrup across her throat and pretends to be dead. Two robbers are arrested by the police and FBI.\n\n► A man and a woman in a tattoo parlor have tattoos put on their shoulders (we see other designs on their arms) as another man screams as soon as a needle touches his arm. A man drives a high-powered sports car erratically, blocks an intersection and is honked at by other drivers until an FBI agent chases and arrests him. A man falls into a bush when he is chased by a large dog, a slug crawls up his nose, he sneezes, many dogs come running, and the man climbs a tree and falls when the branch breaks (no injuries are visible).\n\n► A man vomits copious amounts of goo (we see the goo) on a sidewalk twice in one scene, inside a bank lobby later, and in several playbacks of him vomiting into bushes. A woman puts a blackened diaper into a bank’s drive-through pneumatic tube and when the teller gets it, the woman makes an obscene hand gesture and shouts before driving away. A woman says her husband gets diarrhea when traveling. A man spits out a dental retainer. A man gets accidentally locked into a bank vault every day. Two men go tandem skydiving and yell at each other loudly. Two women argue briefly, a man and a woman argue several times, and two men argue for several seconds while shouting. Two men and a woman argue loudly in a few scenes and the older of the two men growls and gnashes his teeth.\n\nThe Out-Laws SUBSTANCE USE\n\n– A man gives a woman an EpiPen shot in the thigh and then says that it was only a vaccine (the woman was OK and it is unclear whether she was having an allergic reaction to something), a woman says she took a weed gummy (we do not see this), a man says he has morphine in his EMT truck and his friend declines taking some (for recreation). A champagne cork pops in close-up and the scene cuts to two couples at a table with glasses of champagnes as one couple chugs theirs, a man chugs a bottle of beer, two men and a woman sit at a table drinking shots in a bar and one man is drunk after one shot slurring his words and giggling, a man at a cafe table sips a tall cocktail while another man holds a glass of wine and a few other tall cocktails are seen but not touched, a woman sips wine at a cake decorator’s causing her to slur her words and stumble, a man drinks from a flask in the backseat of a moving car, a table at a wedding has about eight bottles of various liquors and clean glasses on it, and men and women hold and do not drink from glasses of wines. A man smokes a cigarette in a bank twice and a pack of bills catches fire but the flames are doused.\n\nBe aware that while we do our best to avoid spoilers it is impossible to disguise all details and some may reveal crucial plot elements.\n\nWe've gone through several editorial changes since we started covering films in 1992 and older reviews are not as complete & accurate as recent ones; we plan to revisit and correct older reviews as resources and time permits.\n\nOur ratings and reviews are based on the theatrically-released versions of films; on video there are often Unrated, Special, Director's Cut or Extended versions, (usually accurately labelled but sometimes mislabeled) released that contain additional content, which we did not review."
