        "text": "Video animation used to be something only big brands could afford. Today it’s easy and inexpensiveto make an animated video – thanks to Biteable’s leading online animated video maker.\n\nCreating animated videos is now as simple as selecting your favorite character, animated infographic, or effect, and then editing the text. Start now and make your first animation in minutes.\n\nAll the big brands make animated videos. They do it because animation is fun, disarming, and easy for people to engage with. But there’s another reason: animated videos have storytelling power.\n\nBright colors, big symbols, and movement pull the viewer in and help them understand your point faster. And here’s the good news: you don’t have to create an animation from scratch to make a splash. Choose from Biteable’s huge animation library instead.\n\nThe Biteable online animated video maker is the best in the business. It has a huge range of cartoon characters and effects including 2D, 3D, infographics, and stop-motion animation styles — all created in Biteable’s in-house video animation studio.\n\nBiteable’s studio artists spend countless hours animating video scenes so you don’t need to hire a studio to do it for you. Animated videos are now literally at your fingertips.\n\nTo help you make amazing animated videos, Biteable comes fully loaded with templates and video animation scenes. Our animation templates are the smart shortcut to making animated videos.\n\nOnce you’re in the Biteable animated video maker, simply choose from one of hundreds of templates. Editing your animated videos is as simple as entering text. Or get more creative by swapping in animated scenes, changing out backgrounds, adding a voice-over, or choosing a premium soundtrack.\n\nWhen your done creating your animated video, share it instantly with a single, trackable link.\n\nThe starting point of any animated video is deciding what you want to achieve. It might be promoting a product, or it could be engaging your audience on social media. Another option is explaining your business on a website.\n\nWhatever your goal for your animated videos, Biteable makes achieving that goal child’s play. Once you’re logged in, use the template search bar to find exactly what you’re looking for. We’ll serve you up a variety of animated video templates to meet your needs. Creating animated videos with Biteable couldn’t be simpler.\n\nOnce you’ve picked a template, you’ll want to customize it. Replace the example text with your own. Swap out scenes by selecting from hundreds of pre-built animated options. Lastly, drop in your own photos, video clips, and logo.\n\nOther options include changing the colors to match your brand (or your mood) and selecting a music track. Make an animated video that really pops with bright colors and a thumping soundtrack, or go for subdued tones and a mellow tune.\n\nGo ahead. Create an animation you’re proud of.\n\nIf you’d like more control, you can also create an animated video – like an intro or explainer – from scratch. Start by surfing the Biteable scenes library (accessed by clicking the plus symbol on your timeline) and picking the style that works best for you. Add more scenes to the animated video creator until you’ve got what you need.\n\nDepending on the scenes you’ve chosen, add text and images, then choose your colors and music. If you’re making animation for social media, keep each video under 30 seconds. If you’re making animated videos for your website, we recommend making no longer than two minutes.\n\nStorytelling can be daunting if it isn’t your day job. Hiring a writer to make an animated video script is prohibitively expensive. The solution? We call them templates, and they guarantee a great story every time.\n\nBiteable animated video templates are crafted for you by professional writers and video makers. They’re designed to require as little editing as possible so you can make a top-notch animated video in a jiff.\n\nGreat animated videos stretch the realm of believability but are still relatable to the viewer. Walking this fine line between reality and fantasy traditionally takes years of experience.\n\nAll Biteable’s animated video scenes and effects are created by our in-house studio team. They’re video animation professionals that do only one thing: animate. Their wealth of experience ensures that every animated video you make with the Biteable animated video maker will be perfectly polished and wonderfully effective.\n\nWhether you want your audience laughing, crying, or shopping, your animated video needs to evoke emotion. Biteable’s large library of animated scenes makes this easy.\n\nGet your followers smiling with one of our friendly cartoon characters. Or get them hyped with one of our funky and energetic scene sets. If your audience is professionals, win them over with our Diverse Workplace animations set. (Bonus: you can easily edit the skin tone and hair color of any characters in Diverse Animations.)\n\nWhatever you want your audience to feel, you’ll find a Biteable animation for the job.\n\nWhat are you waiting for? Start creating animated videos today!\n\nJust like our other answer, we’ll always choose Biteable as the best app for making animated videos. But don’t take our word for it. Do your research. The best online app for you will be the one that combines a level of ease with top-quality animations that meet your needs.\n\nWhen it comes to online animated video makers, look no further than Biteable.\n\nWhy choose stock animations when you can create an animated video that stands above the rest? Biteable designs all of its animations in-house. It’s part of what makes the online video maker the best on the market. Not only that, but many of Biteable’s character animations were built with diversity in mind.
