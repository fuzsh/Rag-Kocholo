        "text": "#1 New York Times bestseller with more than 11 million copies sold! When 4-year-old Colton Burpo emerges from life-saving surgery with remarkable stories of his visit to heaven, his family doesn’t know what to believe. Heaven is For Real details what Colton saw and his family’s journey towards accepting their young son had visited the afterlife.\n\n“Do you remember the hospital, Colton?” Sonja said. “Yes, mommy, I remember,” he said. “That’s where the angels sang to me.”\n\nColton told his parents he left his body during an emergency surgery–and proved that claim by describing exactly what his parents were doing in another part of the hospital during his operation. He talked of visiting heaven and described events that happened before he was born and how he spoke with family members he’d never met. Colton also astonished his parents with descriptions and obscure details about heaven that matched the Bible exactly, even though he had not yet learned to read.\n\nWith disarming innocence and the plainspoken boldness of a child, Colton recounts his visit to heaven, describing:\n\nMeeting long-departed family members\n\nJesus, the angels, how “really, really big” God is, and how much God loves us\n\nHow Jesus called Todd, Colton’s father, to be a pastor\n\nThe Battle of Armageddon\n\nRetold by his father, but using Colton’s uniquely simple words, Heaven Is for Real offers a glimpse of the world that awaits us, where as Colton says, “Nobody is old and nobody wears glasses.”\n\nHeaven Is for Real will forever change the way you think of eternity, offering the chance to see, and believe, like a child.\n\nPraise for Heaven is for Real:\n\n“A beautifully written glimpse into heaven that will encourage those who doubt and thrill those who believe.” —Ron Hall, coauthor of Same Kind of Different as Me"
