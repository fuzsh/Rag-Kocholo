        "text": "Suggestions for Teaching\n\nThis section provides a sample outline to help you prepare to teach. It also includes examples of questions and invitations you might use.\n\nAs you prepare to teach, prayerfully consider each personâs situation and spiritual needs. Decide what will be most helpful to teach. Prepare to define terms that people might not understand. Plan according to how much time you will have, remembering to keep lessons brief.\n\nSelect scriptures to use as you teach. The âDoctrinal Foundationâ section of the lesson includes many helpful scriptures.\n\nConsider which questions to ask as you teach. Plan invitations to extend that will encourage each person to act.\n\nEmphasize Godâs promised blessings, and share your testimony of what you teach.\n\nWhat You Might Teach People in 15â25 Minutes\n\nSelect one or more of the following principles to teach. The doctrinal foundation for each principle is provided after this outline.\n\nThe Divine Mission of Jesus Christ\n\nGod sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to earth to redeem us from sin and death.\n\nBecause of Jesusâs atoning sacrifice, we can be cleansed of our sins and sanctified as we repent.\n\nAfter Jesus was crucified, He was resurrected. Because of His Resurrection, we will all be resurrected after we die. This means that each personâs spirit and body will be reunited, and each of us will live forever in a perfected, resurrected body.\n\nFaith in Jesus Christ\n\nFaith is the first principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\nFaith in Jesus Christ includes having confidence that He is the Son of God and trusting in Him as our Savior and Redeemer.\n\nFaith in Jesus Christ is a principle of action and power.\n\nWe strengthen our faith by praying, studying the scriptures, and obeying the commandments.\n\nRepentance\n\nFaith in Jesus Christ leads us to repent. Repentance is the process of turning to God and turning away from sin. As we repent, our actions, desires, and thoughts change to be more in harmony with Godâs will.\n\nWhen we sincerely repent, God forgives us. Forgiveness is possible because Jesus Christ atoned for our sins.\n\nAs we repent, we feel peace as our guilt and sorrow are healed.\n\nRepentance is a lifelong process. God welcomes us back every time we repent. He will never give up on us.\n\nBaptism: Our First Covenant with God\n\nBaptism is how we first enter a covenant relationship with God.\n\nBaptism has two parts: baptism by water and by the Spirit. When we are baptized and confirmed, we are cleansed of our sins, giving us a new start in life.\n\nWe are baptized by immersion, following Jesusâs example.\n\nChildren are not baptized until they are eight years old. Children who die before that age are redeemed through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\n\nWe partake of the sacrament each week in remembrance of Jesusâs sacrifice and to renew our covenants with God.\n\nThe Gift of the Holy Ghost\n\nThe Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead.\n\nAfter we are baptized, we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost through the ordinance of confirmation.\n\nWhen we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, we can have His companionship throughout our lives if we are faithful.\n\nThe Holy Ghost sanctifies us, guides us, comforts us, and helps us know the truth.\n\nEndure to the End\n\nEnduring includes continuing to exercise faith in Christ each day. We continue to keep our covenants with God, repent, seek the companionship of the Holy Ghost, and partake of the sacrament.\n\nAs we faithfully seek to follow Jesus Christ, God promises that we will have eternal life.\n\nThe Gospel of Jesus Christ Blesses All of Godâs Children\n\nLiving the gospel deepens our joys, inspires our actions, and enriches our relationships.\n\nWe are most likely to be happyâboth as individuals and as familiesâwhen we live by the teachings of Jesus Christ.\n\nThrough the gospel of Jesus Christ, families are blessed in this life and can be united for eternity and live in the presence of God.\n\nQuestions You Might Ask People\n\nThe following questions are examples of what you might ask people. These questions can help you have meaningful conversations and understand a personâs needs and perspective.\n\nWhat do you know about Jesus Christ?\n\nWhat does it mean to you to have faith in Jesus Christ?\n\nWhat changes do you want to make in your life?\n\nWhat is your understanding of repentance?\n\nWhat is your understanding of baptism? What can you do now to prepare for baptism?\n\nHow could the Holy Ghost help you in your journey to return to Godâs presence?\n\nWhat is a challenge that you or your family is facing? May we share some ways the gospel of Jesus Christ could help?\n\nInvitations You Might Extend\n\nWill you ask God in prayer to help you know that what we have taught is true? (See âTeaching Insights: Prayerâ in the last section of lessonÂ 1.)\n\nWill you attend church this Sunday to learn more about what we have taught?\n\nWill you read the Book of Mormon and pray to know that it is the word of God? (You might suggest specific chapters or verses.)\n\nWill you follow Jesusâs example and be baptized? (See âThe Invitation to Be Baptized and Confirmed,â which immediately precedes lessonÂ 1.)\n\nMay we set a time for our next visit?\n\nDoctrinal Foundation\n\nThis section provides doctrine and scriptures for you to study to strengthen your knowledge and testimony of the gospel and to help you teach.\n\nThe Divine Mission of Jesus Christ\n\nHeavenly Father sent His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, to earth to make it possible for all of us to experience joy in this world and eternal life in the world to come. âAnd this is the gospel, the glad tidings,Â â¦ that [Jesus Christ] came into the world â¦ to bear the sins of the world, and to sanctify the world, and to cleanse it from all unrighteousness; that through him all might be savedâ (Doctrine and Covenants 76:40â42).\n\nAs mortals, we all sin, and we all die. Sin and death would prevent us from having eternal life with God unless we had a Redeemer (see 2Â NephiÂ 9). Before the world was created, Heavenly Father chose Jesus Christ to redeem us. In a supreme expression of love, Jesus came to earth and fulfilled this divine mission. He made it possible for us to be redeemed from our sins, and He ensured that we will all be resurrected after we die.\n\nJesus lived a sinless life. At the end of His mortal ministry, He took upon Himself our sins by His suffering in Gethsemane and when He was crucified (see 1Â Nephi 11:33). Jesusâs suffering was so great that it caused Him âto tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every poreâ (Doctrine and Covenants 19:18). After His Crucifixion, Jesus was resurrected, gaining victory over death. Together, these events are the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\n\nOur sins make us spiritually unclean, and âno unclean thing can dwell with Godâ (1Â Nephi 10:21). In addition, the law of justice requires a consequence for our sins.\n\nJesusâs atoning sacrifice provides the way for us to become cleansed of sin and sanctified as we repent. It also provides the way to satisfy the demands of justice (see Alma 42:15, 23â24). The Savior said, âIÂ â¦ have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent; but if they would not repent they must suffer even as Iâ (Doctrine and Covenants 19:16â17). If not for Jesus Christ, sin would end all hope for a future existence with Heavenly Father.\n\nIn offering Himself as a sacrifice for us, Jesus did not eliminate our personal responsibility. We need to have faith in Him, repent, and strive to obey the commandments. As we repent, Jesus will claim on our behalf His rights of mercy of His Father (see Moroni 7:27â28). Because of the Saviorâs intercession, Heavenly Father forgives us, relieving us of the burden and guilt of our sins (see Mosiah 15:7â9). We are spiritually cleansed and can ultimately be welcomed into Godâs presence.\n\nJesusâs divine mission was also to save us from death. Because He was resurrected, we will all be resurrected after we die. This means that each personâs spirit and body will be reunited, and each of us will live forever in a perfected, resurrected body. If not for Jesus Christ, death would end all hope for a future existence with Heavenly Father.\n\nFaith in Jesus Christ\n\nThe first principle of the gospel is faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Faith is the foundation for all other gospel principles.\n\nFaith in Jesus Christ includes having confidence that He is the Only Begotten Son of God. It includes trusting in Him as our Savior and Redeemerâthat He is our only way to return to Godâs presence (see Acts 4:10â12; Mosiah 3:17; 4:6â8). We are invited to exercise âunshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to saveâ (2Â Nephi 31:19).\n\nFaith in Jesus Christ includes believing that He suffered for our sins in His atoning sacrifice. Because of His sacrifice, we can be cleansed and redeemed as we repent. This cleansing helps us find peace and hope in this life. It also allows us to receive a fulness of joy after we die.\n\nFaith in Jesus Christ includes trusting that through Him, we will all be resurrected after we die. This faith can sustain and comfort us in times of loss. The sorrow of death can be dispelled by the promise of the Resurrection.\n\nFaith in Jesus Christ includes believing and trusting that He took upon Himself our afflictions and infirmities (see Isaiah 53:3â5). He knows by His experience how to mercifully support us through lifeâs challenges (see Alma 7:11â12; Doctrine and Covenants 122:8). As we exercise faith, He helps us press forward through hardships.\n\nThrough our faith in Him, Jesus can heal us physically and spiritually. He is always ready to help us as we remember His invitation to âlook unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear notâ (Doctrine and Covenants 6:36).\n\nA Principle of Action and Power\n\nFaith in Jesus Christ leads to action. We express our faith by obeying the commandments and doing good each day. We repent of our sins. We are loyal to Him. We strive to become more like Him.\n\nAs we exercise faith, we can experience Jesusâs power in our daily lives. He will magnify our own best efforts. He will help us grow and resist temptation.\n\nStrengthening Our Faith\n\nThe prophet Alma taught that building faith can begin with a simple âdesire to believeâ (Alma 32:27). Then, for our faith in Jesus Christ to grow, we need to nurture it by learning His words, applying His teachings, and obeying His commandments. Alma taught that as we patiently, diligently nurture the word of God in our hearts, âit shall take root [and become like] a tree springing up unto everlasting lifeââthus strengthening our faith (Alma 32:41; see verses 26â43).\n\nRepentance\n\nWhat Is Repentance?\n\nRepentance is the second principle of the gospel. Faith in Jesus Christ and our love for Him lead us to repent (see Helaman 14:13). Repentance is the process of turning to God and turning away from sin. As we repent, our actions, desires, and thoughts change to be more in harmony with Godâs will. Forgiveness of sin is made possible through Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice.\n\nRepentance is much more than exercising willpower to change a behavior or overcome a weakness. Repentance is sincerely turning to Christ, who gives us the power to experience a âmighty changeâ in our hearts (Alma 5:12â14). As we experience this change of heart, we are spiritually reborn (see Mosiah 27:24â26).\n\nThrough repentance, we develop a fresh view of God, ourselves, and the world. We feel anew Godâs love for us as His childrenâand our Saviorâs love for us. The opportunity to repent is one of the greatest blessings God has given us through His Son.\n\nProcess of Repentance\n\nWhen we repent, we recognize our sins and feel genuine remorse. We confess our sins to God and ask for His forgiveness. We also confess very serious sins to authorized Church leaders, who will support us as we repent. We do what we can to make restitution, which means trying to correct the problems our actions may have caused. Genuine repentance is best demonstrated by righteous actions over a period of time.\n\nRepentance is a daily process throughout our lives. âAll have sinned, and come short of the glory of Godâ (Romans 3:23). We should continually repent, remembering that we âcan do all things through Christ which strengthenethâ us (Philippians 4:13). The Lord has assured us that âas often as my people repent will I forgive them their trespassesâ (Mosiah 26:30).\n\nBlessings of Repentance\n\nRepentance is a positive principle that brings joy and peace. It brings us âunto the power of the Redeemer, unto the salvation of [our] soulsâ (Helaman 5:11).\n\nWhen we repent, our guilt and sorrow are healed in process of time. We feel the influence of the Spirit in greater abundance. Our desire to follow God grows stronger.\n\nâToo many people consider repentance as punishmentâsomething to be avoided. â¦ But this feeling of being penalized is engendered by Satan. He tries to block us from looking to Jesus Christ, who stands with open arms, hoping and willing to heal, forgive, cleanse, strengthen, purify, and sanctify usâ (RussellÂ M. Nelson, âWe Can Do Better and Be Better,â Ensign or Liahona, May 2019,Â 67).\n\nBaptism: Our First Covenant with God\n\nFaith in Jesus Christ and repentance prepare us for the ordinances of baptism and confirmation. Baptism is the first saving ordinance of the gospel of Jesus Christ. As we receive this joyous ordinance of hope, we make our first covenant with God.\n\nAn ordinance is a sacred act or ceremony performed by the authority of the priesthood. Some ordinances, like baptism, are essential to our salvation.\n\nThrough ordinances, we make covenants with God. These covenants are sacred promises between us and God. He promises to bless us as we keep our promises with Him. We should have a strong commitment to keep our promises with God.\n\nGod has provided ordinances and covenants to help us come unto Him and have eternal life. As we receive priesthood ordinances and keep the associated covenants, we can experience âthe power of godlinessâ in our lives (Doctrine and Covenants 84:20).\n\nThe Baptismal Covenant\n\nThe Savior taught that baptism is necessary for us to enter the kingdom of heaven (see John 3:5). It is also necessary for us to become members of the Church of Jesus Christ. Our Savior set the example by being baptized (see Matthew 3:13â17).\n\nWhen we are baptized and keep our covenant, God promises to forgive our sins (see Acts 22:16; 3Â Nephi 12:1â2). This great blessing is made possible through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who âloved us, and washed us from our sins in his own bloodâ (Revelation 1:5). God also promises to bless us with the companionship of the Holy Ghost so we can be sanctified, guided, and comforted.\n\nIn our part of the baptismal covenant, we witness that we are willing to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ. We also promise to always remember Him and keep His commandments. We promise to love and serve others, âto mourn with those that mourn; â¦ comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all placesâ (Mosiah 18:9; see verses 8â10,Â 13). We express a determination to serve Jesus Christ to the end of our lives (see Doctrine and Covenants 20:37; Mosiah 2:17).\n\nOur covenant commitments associated with baptism are a great responsibility. They are also inspiring and joyful. They create a special relationship between us and Heavenly Father through which He perpetually extends His love.\n\nBaptism by Immersion\n\nJesus taught that we need to be baptized by immersion for a remission of our sins (see Doctrine and Covenants 20:72â74). Baptism by immersion is symbolic of the death, burial, and Resurrection of Jesus Christ (see Romans 6:3â6).\n\nBaptism by immersion also has powerful symbolism for us personally. It represents the death of our old life, the burial of that life, and our emergence in spiritual rebirth. When we are baptized, we begin the process of being born again and becoming spiritual sons and daughters of Christ (see Mosiah 5:7â8; Romans 8:14â17).\n\nChildren\n\nChildren are not baptized until they reach the age of accountability, which is eight years of age (see Doctrine and Covenants 68:27). Children who die before that age are redeemed through the Atonement of Jesus Christ (see Moroni 8:4â24; Doctrine and Covenants 137:10). Before children are baptized, they should be taught the gospel so they will be prepared for this important step in their lives to make a covenant with God.\n\nThe Sacrament\n\nOur Heavenly Father wants us to be faithful to the covenants we make with Him. To help us do this, He has commanded us to meet often to partake of the sacrament. The sacrament is a priesthood ordinance that Jesus introduced to His Apostles just before His Atonement.\n\nPartaking of the sacrament is the central purpose of sacrament meeting each week. Bread and water are blessed and passed to the congregation. The bread represents the Saviorâs sacrifice of His body for us. The water represents His blood, which He shed for us.\n\nWe partake of these emblems in remembrance of the Saviorâs sacrifice and to renew our covenants with God. We receive anew the promise that the Spirit will be with us.\n\nThe Gift of the Holy Ghost\n\nReceiving the Gift of the Holy Ghost\n\nBaptism has two parts. Jesus taught that we need to be âborn of water and of the Spiritâ to enter the kingdom of God (John 3:5; emphasis added). Joseph Smith taught, âBaptism by water is but half a baptism, and is good for nothing without the other halfâthat is, the baptism of the Holy Ghostâ (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith [2007],Â 95).\n\nBaptism by water must be followed by baptism of the Spirit to be complete. When we receive both baptisms, we are cleansed of our sins and are spiritually reborn. We then begin a new spiritual life as disciples of Christ.\n\nWe receive the baptism of the Spirit through an ordinance called confirmation. This ordinance is performed by one or more priesthood holders who lay their hands upon our head. First they confirm us a member of the Church, and then they confer the gift of the Holy Ghost upon us. This is the same ordinance that is referenced in the New Testament and the Book of Mormon (see Acts 8:14â17; 3Â Nephi 18:36â37).\n\nThe Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead. He works in unity with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. When we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, we can have His companionship throughout our lives as we are faithful.\n\nHow the Holy Ghost Blesses Us\n\nThe gift of the Holy Ghost is one of Heavenly Fatherâs greatest gifts. The Holy Ghost cleanses and sanctifies us, making us more holy, more complete, more like God (see 3Â Nephi 27:20). He helps us change and grow spiritually as we seek to follow Godâs precepts.\n\nThe Holy Ghost helps us learn and recognize truth (see Moroni 10:5). He also confirms truth to our hearts and minds. Additionally, the Holy Ghost helps us teach truth (see Doctrine and Covenants 42:14). When we learn and teach truth by the power of the Holy Ghost, He carries it unto our hearts (see 2Â Nephi 33:1).\n\nAs we humbly seek direction from the Holy Ghost, He will guide us (see 2Â Nephi 32:5). This includes prompting us in how we can serve others.\n\nThe Holy Ghost provides spiritual strength to help us overcome weakness. He helps us resist temptation. He can warn us of spiritual and physical danger.\n\nThe Holy Ghost will help us through the challenges of life. He will comfort us during times of trial or sorrow, filling us with hope (see Moroni 8:26). Through the Holy Ghost, we can feel Godâs love for us.\n\nEndure to the End\n\nWhen we are baptized and confirmed, we enter into a covenant with God. Among other things, we promise to keep His commandments and serve Him for the remainder of our lives (see Mosiah 18:8â10,Â 13; Doctrine and Covenants 20:37).\n\nAfter we have entered the gospel path through baptism and confirmation, we make every effort to stay on it. When we get off the path even a little bit, we exercise faith in Christ to repent. The blessing of repentance allows us to return to the gospel path and retain the blessings of our covenants with God. As we sincerely repent, God is always willing to forgive and welcome us back.\n\nEnduring to the end means staying faithful to God to the end of our livesâthrough good times and hard times, through prosperity and adversity. We humbly allow Christ to shape us and make us more like Him. We look to Christ with faith, trust, and hope regardless of what comes in our lives.\n\nEnduring to the end does not simply mean holding on until we die. Instead, it means focusing our lives, thoughts, and actions on Jesus Christ. It includes continuing to exercise faith in Christ each day. We also continue to repent, keep our covenants with God, and seek the companionship of the Holy Ghost.\n\nEnduring to the end includes âpress[ing] forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men.â Our Heavenly Father promises that as we endure to the end, we âshall have eternal lifeâ (2Â Nephi 31:20).\n\nThe Gospel of Jesus Christ Blesses All of Godâs Children\n\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ is for all of Godâs children. The scriptures teach that âall are alike unto Godâ regardless of our background or situation. He invites âall to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto himâ (2Â Nephi 26:33).\n\nThe gospel blesses us throughout our mortal lives and throughout eternity. We are most likely to be happyâboth as individuals and as familiesâwhen we live by the teachings of Jesus Christ (see Mosiah 2:41; âThe Family: A Proclamation to the World,â ChurchofJesusChrist.org). Living the gospel deepens our joys, inspires our actions, and enriches our relationships.\n\nLiving the gospel of Jesus Christ can also protect us from making choices that would harm us physically or spiritually. It helps us find strength and comfort in times of trial and sorrow. It provides the way to a joyous eternal life.\n\nOne of the great messages of the restored gospel is that we are all part of Godâs family. We are His beloved sons and daughters. Regardless of our family situation on earth, each of us is a member of the family of God.\n\nAnother great part of our message is that families can be united for eternity. The family is ordained of God. Heavenly Fatherâs plan of happiness enables family relationships to continue beyond the grave. Sacred temple ordinances and covenants make it possible for families to be together forever.\n\nThrough the light of the gospel, families can resolve misunderstandings, contentions, and challenges. Families torn by discord can be healed through repentance, forgiveness, and faith in the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ helps us develop stronger family relationships. The home is the best place to teach and learn the principles of the gospel. A home established on gospel principles will be a place of refuge and safety. It will be a place where the Spirit of the Lord can abide."
