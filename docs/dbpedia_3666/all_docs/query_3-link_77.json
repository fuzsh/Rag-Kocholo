        "text": "We first read about Abram, a rich landowner who lived in Harran, in Genesis 11. Abram had most everything he could want, except a child. His wife, Sarai, was barren. But God’s will has a way of overriding any human limitations, and He clearly commanded Abram in Genesis 12:\n\n“Go from your country, your people and your father’s household to the land I will show you. I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you…” (Genesis 12:1-2).\n\nAbram pulled up stakes and left his home, travelling to a land he’d never seen before. Along the way, God gave more details about His promise, knowing the cry of Abram and Sarai’s heart was to have a child. During another conversation, Abram asked God directly, “Sovereign Lord, what can you give me since I remain childless.” God’s answer left no room for doubt, “…a son who is your own flesh and blood will be your heir” (Genesis 15:4).\n\nTheir names changed when God made a covenant concerning their future. God spoke this over Abram, and it concerned Sarai as well:\n\n“You will be the father of many nations. No longer will you be called Abram,your name will be Abraham, for I have made you a father of many nations. I will make you very fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you” (Genesis 17:4-6).\n\n“God also said to Abraham, ‘As for Sarai your wife, you are no longer to call her Sarai; her name will be Sarah. I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her” (Genesis 17:15-16).\n\nIn both cases, God chose to refine their names. For example, Abram means “exalted father,” and in Harran as well as on his journey, he played a fatherly kind of role for immediate family such as his nephew Lot. As Abraham, or “father of many nations,” he seeks to fulfill his role of protector to God’s larger family. Sarai, whose name means “princess” becomes Sarah, “my princess,” and grows into a woman who trusts God’s promises rather than scoffing at them in disbelief.\n\nPhoto credit: Flickr/Ted\n\nJacob’s birth just seconds after his twin Esau illustrates how accurate his name was. The baby whose name meant “to grasp the heel of” came out literally holding onto his brother’s foot. Coming of age, Jacob’s goal seemed to be getting what Esau was entitled to as the eldest, living out another definition of his name: “supplanter”, or “one who replaces another.”\n\nMany years later, Jacob is about to face his brother after all his trickery, and is afraid Esau will be seeking revenge on him. Genesis 32 tells what happened as he prepared for the meeting:\n\n“That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two female servants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok. After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions. So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak. When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man. Then the man said, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.”\n\nBut Jacob replied, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”\n\nThe man asked him, “What is your name?”\n\n“Jacob,” he answered.\n\nThen the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome” (Genesis 32:22-28).\n\nThis new name commemorates Jacob engaging directly with God. But the blessing Israel receives begins a change in him. Over time, he lets go of his need to gain for himself and instead acknowledges the Lordship of God over his life, taking on the stature of patriarch.\n\nPhoto credit: Wikimedia/Public Domain: Gustave Doré\n\nImagine going from being one of many fishermen on the sea of Galilee to a pillar of Christ’s church. That is the life change that Peter experienced. His name change came from the Lord Himself. Simon means “he has heard” or “to listen,” probably a good description for someone who spent most of his time out at sea. But everything changed the day his brother Andrew brought Him to meet Jesus.\n\n“Jesus looked at him and said, ‘You are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephas’ (which, when translated, is Peter)” (John 1:42).\n\nPeter didn’t have any idea at that moment what an amazing role God had in mind for him. But he knew enough to obey Jesus’ call to join Him. A fuller explanation came later on.\n\n“And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven” (Matthew 16:18-19).\n\nJesus considered Simon worthy of a tremendous honor, one he would have to grow into. As Peter, he experienced failure and forgiveness, then learned the power of being known and accepted completely by his Savior. Eventually, he lived up to his new name, “rock,” by preaching boldly and helping to build Christ’s church on earth.\n\n“Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd…” (Acts 2:14).\n\n“Now as Peter went here and there among them all, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda. There he found a man named Aeneas, bedridden for eight years, who was paralyzed. And Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; rise and make your bed.” And immediately he rose (Acts 9:32-34).\n\nThough He has definitely led me through different seasons in my life, God hasn’t ever bestowed a new name on me. But learning about how He has done that for others reminds me of several important truths:\n\nGod is in control of my life\n\nGod knows me intimately and loves me completely\n\nGod has specific work for me to do\n\nGod desires to move me out of my past and into a greater future\n\nGod wants me to keep my eyes fixed on Him and His plans\n\nNo matter what name I may be known by in the world, I want to represent His well.\n\nPhoto credit: Wikimedia/Public Domain: Pietro Perugino\n\nEditor's note: An earlier version of this story included Paul, who was known as Saul before his conversion. His name, however, was not directly changed by God, so the section has been removed.\n\nHeather Adams is an author, speaker, and singer living in Connecticut.
