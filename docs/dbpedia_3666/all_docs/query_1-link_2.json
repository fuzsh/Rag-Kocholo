        "text": "ON FIRE is an incredible story about a family trapped by a wild forest fire with little hope for escape. ON FIRE is a thrilling, fast-paced movie with some subtle but solid Christian, moral content stressing family, sacrifice, faith, and prayer, but the movie has intense and scary action sequences and at least 26 obscenities and profanities.\n\nDave lives with his pregnant wife, Sarah, their teenage son, Clay, and Dave’s elderly father. They both work and have barely enough money to support Dave’s father and themselves.\n\nAfter practice one day, Dave and Clay notice that there is smoke coming from the ridge of a neighboring town. Dave is sure that the fire will not be able to pass the valley that separates the two towns and is unworried.\n\nHowever, in just a few hours, their home is covered in smoke. Dave drives to a hardware store to buy equipment to fireproof his house and tells Sarah and Clay to be ready to evacuate. Unfortunately, the fire engulfs their town quicker than the authorities can anticipate, and everyone is ordered to evacuate immediately. Separated from his family with no cell service, Dave works out a way to get to his family.\n\nMeanwhile, Sarah and Clay try to get Dave’s father to come with them in the car. Although he is stubborn, he agrees when he is offered a pack of cigarettes. While driving, the ash and smoke make visibility impossible, and they nearly hit a deer. Forced to swerve from the main road, Sarah crashes, knocking her unconscious.\n\nWhile Dave finds his wife, child, and father, the night is about to go from bad to worse. Will Dave and his family be able to work together and escape the fire?\n\nON FIRE is a thrilling movie, with great performances from the leading cast. It does a great job making viewers feel like they’re stuck in the fire with Dave and his family. The story is compelling and intense, but it also has some Christian elements. For example, in Dave’s house there is a cross on the wall. While fleeing the fire, Sarah suggests that they pray. In a later scene, she prays that God would guide them through the night.\n\nBy the end of the movie, faith overcomes their fear. It doesn’t avoid the tragedy of the fire, but it provides Dave, Sarah and Clay with the faith and determination to help one another survive. The movie has some strong themes of sacrifice, the importance of family, and the strength of love in a marriage. It also honors and respects first responders.\n\nSadly, these uplifting redemptive and moral elements are marred by at least 26 obscenities and profanities, including one “f” word. ON FIRE also has an intense scene where a neighbor catches fire and is burned badly. The peril and intensity is constant and is elevated by Sarah being pregnant with their daughter. So, MOVIEGUIDE® advises strong and extreme caution.\n\nThat said, ON FIRE is an uplifting, intense, moral movie about faith and perseverance for mature audiences."
