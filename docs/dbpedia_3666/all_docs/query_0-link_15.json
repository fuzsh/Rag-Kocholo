        "text": "Amanda Beard was just 14 years-old the first time she made an appearance in the Olympic Games and walked away as the second youngest swimmer in history to medal with one gold and two silvers. Over the course of the next twelve years she would be the recipient of eight USA Swimming National Titles, hold the FINA World Record and World Champion title for the 200-meter breaststroke, make three more appearances in the Olympic Games–accumulating another gold, two more silvers and a bronze–and serve as the USA Olympic Swimming Team Captain twice, thus carving her name deeply into the face of sports history.\n\nAlmost eclipsing her incredible athletic achievements, Amanda’s celebrity status has allowed her to enjoy immense success as a brand representative as well as a nonprofit advisor and has frequently put her in the spotlight as a model and correspondent for print and television media outlets worldwide. She has graced the pages of countless sports and lifestyle magazines and been a guest and host on numerous national TV shows.\n\nAmanda became a first time co-author in 2012 with the release of the autobiographical New York Times Bestseller In the Water They Can't See You Cry. She used the personal recount as an opportunity to share aspects of her life previously kept private and in doing so managed to connect deeply with a new audience. She currently shares her story of professional and personal triumph via motivational speaking engagements and passes on her swimming expertise via clinics and private lessons.\n\nAmanda’s most recent entrepreneurial endeavor is as Co-Founder of Beard Swim Co., a learn-to-swim program with a philosophy that the ability to swim is one of the greatest gifts you can give a child. Keeping kids water safe is a mission that has become even closer to Amanda’s heart since having children of her own. She currently accepted a position at the University of Arizona were she is coaching the next generation of future Olympian’s. She is married to photographer Sacha Brown, with whom she has a son Blaise and a daughter Doone.\n\nDuring a 43-year Hollywood career, which spanned the development of the motion picture medium as a modern American art, Walter Elias Disney, a modern Aesop, established himself and his product as a genuine part of Americana.\n\nDavid Low, the late British political cartoonist, called Disney “the most significant figure in graphic arts since Leonardo.” A pioneer and innovator, and the possessor of one of the most fertile imaginations the world has ever known, Walt Disney, along with members of his staff, received more than 950 honors and citations from throughout the world, including 48 Academy Awards® and 7 Emmys® in his lifetime.\n\nWalt Disney’s personal awards included honorary degrees from Harvard, Yale, the University of Southern California, and UCLA; the Presidential Medal of Freedom; France’s Legion of Honor and Officer d’Academie decorations; Thailand’s Order of the Crown; Brazil’s Order of the Southern Cross; Mexico’s Order of the Aztec Eagle; and the Showman of the World Award from the National Association of Theatre Owners.\n\nThe creator of Mickey Mouse and founder of Disneyland and Walt Disney World was born in Chicago, Illinois, on December 5, 1901. His father, Elias Disney, was an Irish-Canadian. His mother, Flora Call Disney, was of German-American descent. Walt was one of five children, four boys and a girl.\n\nRaised on a farm near Marceline, Missouri, Walt early became interested in drawing, selling his first sketches to neighbors when he was only seven years old. At McKinley High School in Chicago, Disney divided his attention between drawing and photography, contributing both to the school paper. At night he attended the Academy of Fine Arts.\n\nDuring the fall of 1918, Disney attempted to enlist for military service. Rejected because he was only 16 years of age, Walt joined the Red Cross and was sent overseas, where he spent a year driving an ambulance and chauffeuring Red Cross officials. His ambulance was covered from stem to stern, not with stock camouflage, but with drawings and cartoons.\n\nAfter the war, Walt returned to Kansas City, where he began his career as an advertising cartoonist. Here, in 1920, he created and marketed his first original animated cartoons, and later perfected a new method for combining live-action and animation.\n\nIn August of 1923, Walt Disney left Kansas City for Hollywood with nothing but a few drawing materials, $40 in his pocket and a completed animated and live-action film. Walt’s brother Roy O. Disney was already in California, with an immense amount of sympathy and encouragement, and $250. Pooling their resources, they borrowed an additional $500 and constructed a camera stand in their uncle’s garage. Soon, they received an order from New York for the first “Alice Comedy” short, and the brothers began their production operation in the rear of a Hollywood real estate office two blocks away.\n\nOn July 13, 1925, Walt married one of his first employees, Lillian Bounds, in Lewiston, Idaho. They were blessed with two daughters — Diane, married to Ron Miller, former president and chief executive officer of Walt Disney Productions; and Sharon Disney Lund, formerly a member of Disney’s Board of Directors. The Millers have seven children and Mrs. Lund had three. Mrs. Lund passed away in 1993.\n\nMickey Mouse was created in 1928, and his talents were first used in a silent cartoon entitled Plane Crazy. However, before the cartoon could be released, sound burst upon the motion picture screen. Thus Mickey made his screen debut in Steamboat Willie, the world’s first fully synchronized sound cartoon, which premiered at the Colony Theatre in New York on November 18, 1928.\n\nWalt’s drive to perfect the art of animation was endless. Technicolor® was introduced to animation during the production of his “Silly Symphonies.” In 1932, the film entitled Flowers and Trees won Walt the first of his 32 personal Academy Awards®. In 1937, he released The Old Mill, the first short subject to utilize the multiplane camera technique.\n\nOn December 21 of that same year, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the first full-length animated musical feature, premiered at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles. Produced at the unheard of cost of $1,499,000 during the depths of the Great Depression, the film is still accounted as one of the great feats and imperishable monuments of the motion picture industry. During the next five years, Walt completed such other full-length animated classics as Pinocchio, Fantasia, Dumbo and Bambi.\n\nIn 1940, construction was completed on Disney’s Burbank studio, and the staff swelled to more than 1,000 artists, animators, story men and technicians. During World War II, 94 percent of the Disney facilities were engaged in special government work including the production of training and propaganda films for the armed services, as well as health films which are still shown throughout the world by the U.S. State Department. The remainder of his efforts were devoted to the production of comedy short subjects, deemed highly essential to civilian and military morale.\n\nDisney’s 1945 feature, the musical The Three Caballeros, combined live action with the cartoon medium, a process he used successfully in such other features as Song of the South and the highly acclaimed Mary Poppins. In all, 81 features were released by the studio during his lifetime.\n\nWalt’s inquisitive mind and keen sense for education through entertainment resulted in the award-winning “True-Life Adventure” series. Through such films as The Living Desert, The Vanishing Prairie, The African Lion and White Wilderness, Disney brought fascinating insights into the world of wild animals and taught the importance of conserving our nation’s outdoor heritage.\n\nDisneyland, launched in 1955 as a fabulous $17 million Magic Kingdom, soon increased its investment tenfold and entertained, by its fourth decade, more than 400 million people, including presidents, kings and queens and royalty from all over the globe.\n\nA pioneer in the field of television programming, Disney began production in 1954, and was among the first to present full-color programming with his Wonderful World of Color in 1961. The Mickey Mouse Club and Zorro were popular favorites in the 1950s.\n\nBut that was only the beginning. In 1965, Walt Disney turned his attention toward the problem of improving the quality of urban life in America. He personally directed the design on an Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow, or EPCOT, planned as a living showcase for the creativity of American industry.\n\nSaid Disney, “I don’t believe there is a challenge anywhere in the world that is more important to people everywhere than finding the solution to the problems of our cities. But where do we begin? Well, we’re convinced we must start with the public need. And the need is not just for curing the old ills of old cities. We think the need is for starting from scratch on virgin land and building a community that will become a prototype for the future.”\n\nThus, Disney directed the purchase of 43 square miles of virgin land — twice the size of Manhattan Island — in the center of the state of Florida. Here, he master planned a whole new Disney world of entertainment to include a new amusement theme park, motel-hotel resort vacation center and his Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow. After more than seven years of master planning and preparation, including 52 months of actual construction, Walt Disney World opened to the public as scheduled on October 1, 1971. Epcot Center opened on October 1, 1982.\n\nPrior to his death on December 15, 1966, Walt Disney took a deep interest in the establishment of California Institute of the Arts, a college level, professional school of all the creative and performing arts. Of Cal Arts, Walt once said, “It’s the principal thing I hope to leave when I move on to greener pastures. If I can help provide a place to develop the talent of the future, I think I will have accomplished something.”\n\nCalifornia Institute of the Arts was founded in 1961 with the amalgamation of two schools, the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music and Chouinard Art Institute. The campus is located in the city of Valencia, 32 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles. Walt Disney conceived the new school as a place where all the performing and creative arts would be taught under one roof in a “community of the arts” as a completely new approach to professional arts training.\n\nWalt Disney is a legend, a folk hero of the 20th century. His worldwide popularity was based upon the ideas which his name represents: imagination, optimism and self-made success in the American tradition. Walt Disney did more to touch the hearts, minds and emotions of millions of Americans than any other man in the past century. Through his work, he brought joy, happiness and a universal means of communication to the people of every nation. Certainly, our world shall know but one Walt Disney.\n\nCounty Notes: Walt Disney\n\nOpened Disneyland in Anaheim in 1955\n\nDied at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange\n\nAnimator, Producer, Entrepreneur\n\nHas two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Film and Television\n\nInducted into the Anaheim Walk of Fame\n\nHolds record for most Academy Awards earned and nominations\n\nHas earned two Golden Globes, Emmy Award, and other honors\n\nMaj Gen William Lyon, USAF [Ret]\n\nMarch 9, 1923 – May 22, 2020\n\nGeneral William Lyon, without question, led an achievement-filled life. Even more impressive is the fact that his many accomplishments were so wide ranging. He made his mark as a successful businessman, a decorated member of the military, and an active philanthropist in the community.\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nWilliam Lyon was born on March 9, 1923, in Los Angeles, California. His father emigrated from Russia as a teenager, and his mother grew up on a small farm in Kentucky. Together they instilled in their son a solid work ethic and a fierce commitment to doing the right thing. Those founding principles guided his life.\n\nThe Lyon family moved several times between San Francisco and Los Angeles, but most of Bill’s studies were completed in Southern California. Bill and his brother, Leon, who was 3 years his senior, attended Page Military Academy in Hollywood as boarding students. He finished his elementary education at University School, then attended public middle school in Westwood. Bill followed Leon to Beverly Hills High School. While there, he discovered his love of airplanes and thirst for flying after paying $1 to take a ride around the Culver City airfield in a two-seater Porterfield. At 16, he got his pilot’s license taking lessons in a 50 hp Luscombe at an airfield in Van Nuys. Bill graduated from Beverly High in 1941 after a brief period at the Menlo School in Palo Alto.\n\nIn the fall of 1941, Bill enrolled at the University of Southern California. He became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity and joined Naval ROTC with the dream to join the Navy as a pilot. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in December of 1941, Bill attempted to enlist in the Navy. He was rejected due to a deviated septum but had nasal surgery and tried again. When he failed the medical exam a second time due to his nose, he concluded “God did not want [him] to be a Navy pilot.” Determined to contribute to the war effort, Bill left USC to attend the Dallas Aviation School and College, graduating August 12, 1943, with a commercial instructor’s license. He immediately found work instructing pilots for the war, ironically training naval air cadets.\n\nFAMILY\n\nWilliam Lyon and Miriam Marquardt were married on September 14, 1946. Together they had two daughters, Mary Susan and Christine Ann. Unfortunately, Miriam passed away suddenly in January of 1970.\n\nIn August of 1971, Bill married the former Willa Dean Harwell from Haskell, Texas, adding her children Marcia and Byron Russell to the family. In September of 1973, Bill and Willa Dean welcomed their son William Harwell into their blended family. Together they have 5 children, 7 grandchildren, and 6 great grandchildren.\n\nMILITARY\n\nAs World War II raged on, young Lyon decided to enlist again, but this time in the Army Air Force as a ferry pilot. He was designated a flight officer on June 3, 1944. This marked the beginning of a distinguished military career of more than 35 years. During World War II, Bill flew a variety of aircraft including C-46s, C-47s, B-24s, B-25s, A-20s, T-6s and P-38s. He completed ferry and air transport assignments in the Pacific as far west as Australia, in North Africa as far east as India, and in both England and Scotland.\n\nIn 1951, then Captain Lyon left his job as a copilot for Frontier Airlines to volunteer for active duty in the Air Force as the Korean War was heating up. After several stateside assignments, he deployed to South Korea on March 10, 1953. There, Lyon flew 75 combat missions in C-46s and C-47s, many of which involved dropping troops and saboteurs deep behind enemy lines at low altitude in the dark of night.\n\nGeneral Lyon’s military contributions further extended to serving as Chief of Air Force Reserve from 1975 to 1979, where he was responsible for managing a $700,000,000 budget as well as the activities of some 53,000 Air Force reservists. He is credited as the catalyst behind bringing the Air Force Reserve up to active duty standards and for implementing the policy of Total Force.\n\nGeneral Lyon received numerous awards and decorations, including the Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal (with three oak clusters), and the Presidential Unit Citation.\n\nWilliam Lyon’s military affiliations included his service as board chairman of the United States Air Force Academy Research and Development Institution, chairman (and later chairman emeritus) and director of the USAF Falcon Foundation, as well as serving as a member of the Air Force Academy Foundation.\n\nIn addition, General Lyon served as chairman of the American Air Museum in Britain and founded the Lyon Air Museum at John Wayne Airport in Orange County in 2009.\n\nBUSINESS\n\nAfter returning from Korea in 1954, William Lyon started building homes for returning military personnel and others attracted to the Golden State. During his 60-year career, spanning several entities, General Lyon has been responsible for the production of well over 100,000 residential homes. Ranked as the 18th largest homebuilder in 2019, William Lyon Homes merged with Taylor Morrison Home Corporation in early 2020 creating the nation’s 5th largest publicly traded homebuilder.\n\nGeneral Lyon’s business success was not limited to homebuilding. In 1985, he established a multifamily real estate company to further diversify his real estate holdings which led to the acquisition, development, and management of over 10,000 apartment units. In 1981, he and a partner purchased AirCal, a regional air carrier based in Newport Beach, California. General Lyon served as their Chairman & CEO until 1987 when he merged AirCal with American Airlines. In 2003, a group of founders and investors opened Commercial Bank of California in Costa Mesa, CA. William Lyon served as a board member and founding Chairman of the Board.\n\nRemarkably, General Lyon was involved in three initial public offerings spanning over three decades: AirCal Airlines in 1983, The Presley Companies in 1991, and William Lyon Homes 2013.\n\nCOMMUNITY\n\nWilliam Lyon and his wife, Willa Dean, have always been active supporters of community organizations. After 30 years of service, he retired as a director on the Segerstrom Center for the Arts Board, having been a former chairman. General Lyon was the founding chairman of the Orangewood Children’s Foundation and served as a chairman of the Boy Scouts of America, Orange County Council. Additionally, he served as board chairman of the Alexis de Tocqueville Society of The United Way.\n\nGeneral Lyon served as a Lifetime Trustee of the University of Southern California. Additionally, he served on the board of USC Marshall School of Business and as a member of the President’s Cabinet of Chapman University.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nUniversity of Southern California\n\nDallas Aviation School and Air College\n\nPOLITICAL ACTIVITIES\n\nFounding Member, CRAFT (California Republicans Aligned For Tomorrow), 2007 - 2010\n\nCalifornia Republican Party, Chairman, Team California – 2004, 2006\n\nFounding Member, Republican Party California Team 100\n\nFounding Member, New Majority Orange County, Republican Party\n\nBOARD AFFILIATIONS\n\nChairman Emeritus, William Lyon Homes\n\nDirector Emeritus and Founder, Commercial Bank of California\n\nBoard Member, American Airlines\n\nLife Member, USC Board of Trustees\n\nBoard Member, USC Marshall School of Business – Board of Leaders 2005\n\nMember, President’s Cabinet of Chapman University\n\nMember, Chapman University’s Center for Real Estate & Finance Board of Advisors\n\nLife Member, Board of National Association of Home Builders\n\nBoard Member, Woodside Credit\n\nChairman of the Board, Lyon Air Museum\n\nU.S. Chairman of the Board, The American Air Museum in Duxford, England (2009 – 2014)\n\nBoard Member, Fidelity National Financial, Inc.

Where others saw the sprawl of agricultural life and bedroom communities, he dreamed of dazzling stages and lofty galleries where the people of Orange County would thrill to the greatest artists.\n\nHenry Segerstrom had the entrepreneurial drive and grandeur of spirit to call these visions into existence: first South Coast Plaza, which he made into a retail center recognized internationally as a premier destination for luxury shopping, and then Segerstrom Center for the Arts, a multidisciplinary cultural powerhouse to rival any in the world.\n\nBut it was not only his private generosity and ability to inspire others, both extraordinary, that made these achievements possible. Henry Segerstrom’s personal magnetism—the superb intelligence and grace that imbued everything he did—enabled him to win over the celebrated people who would breathe life into his creations. He developed relationships with the heads of Louis Vuitton, Hermès, Gucci, Cartier, Courrèges, Yves Saint Laurent, Halston, Tiffany & Co., Nordstom, and many others, recruiting their brands for South Coast Plaza. He personally helped to bring the most distinguished figures in the performing arts to the stages of Segerstrom Center for the Arts, among them Mikhail Baryshnikov, Gustavo Dudamel, Plácido Domingo, Renée Fleming, Rudolf Nureyev, and Luciano Pavarotti. He sought out Isamu Noguchi and commissioned him to create California Scenario, one of the artist’s most important public sculpture gardens, for Segerstrom Center for the Arts, and enlisted Richard Serra to make Connector, the monumental sculpture that anchors the Center’s Argyros Plaza. Insisting on the highest standards for the Center, he worked side by side with architects and landscape architects including Cesar Pelli, Frank Gehry, Kathryn Gustafson, and Thom Mayne, who recognized and respected his taste and expertise in design.\n\nHenry Segerstrom sought for the people of Orange County exactly what he demanded of himself: only the best.\n\nHis loyalty to Orange County ran deep. Born in Santa Ana in 1923 into an immigrant farming family, he graduated from Santa Ana High School, where he served as class president, and then entered Stanford University at age 17. But the attack on Pearl Harbor cut short his studies. Answering his country’s call, he enlisted in the Army and was deployed to the European front in the field artillery, where he rose to the rank of captain. He was severely injured in the Battle of the Bulge, for which he was decorated with the Purple Heart. During the three years his recuperation required, he refused to remain idle but completed his Bachelor of Arts and Master of Business Administration degrees from Stanford.\n\nEventually, he became Managing Partner of his family’s farm operation, C.J. Segerstrom & Sons, the platform he needed to imagine and create South Coast Plaza and subsequently Segerstrom Center for the Arts.\n\nHenry Segerstrom also extended his passion for the arts and charismatic leadership beyond Orange County. He contributed his time, resources, and skills to institutions including Carnegie Hall, which honored him with its Medal of Excellence in 2010, and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, of which he was a founder. He also served from 1999 to 2002 as National Chairman of the Business Committee for the Arts, after having received the organization’s Leadership Award in 1993. Among his many other philanthropic achievements, he was particularly proud of his role in establishing the Center for Social Innovation at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business.\n\nA dedicated public servant, Henry Segerstrom was elected to the Orange County Water District Board, on which he served for more than 20 years, eventually as its chairman. Among his many honors, he was knighted by His Majesty King Carl XVI Gustav of Sweden, received honorary doctorates from Western University and Whittier Law School, and in 2008 was given the highest honor of the Stanford Graduate School of Business, its Ernest C. Arbuckle Award.\n\nHenry Segerstrom passed away in 2015—but his incomparable legacy for Orange County remains as an ongoing testament to his vision, work ethic, profound passion for quality, and unparalleled sense of style. “I believe in my own heart,” he said, “that in our lifetime we are put on Earth to do more than just make ourselves happy. Be bold. Do something to help others. Now is the time for us to invest in future generations.”"
