        "text": "In the past few years, we’ve battled numerous global challenges, including a pandemic, food crises, conflict and inflation. In the face of these, we found that our dollars were stretched as thin as they could go. To continue serving the children in our program, we had to make a change.\n\nPrior to this change, we had the longest period without a rate change in Compassion’s history. But our previous rate made it hard to fund effective child development programs. That’s why our rate has now been adjusted to $43.\n\nIf you have further questions about this rate change, please see our rate change FAQs here.\n\nChild sponsorship is donating monthly to a child in need monthly and supporting them through personal messages and prayer. Your donation allows a local church to welcome that child into their program, offering them the essentials they need to thrive, including medical care, food, clean water, education and most importantly, an introduction to Jesus. Your sponsorship of $43 per month will cover these essentials.\n\nAt Compassion, we partner with local churches within the community because they know each child personally. This means the child will receive what they need specifically to journey out of poverty. Learn more about how child sponsorship helps.\n\nA simple definition of poverty is lacking the resources needed to meet basic needs, such as food, clean water and medical care. However, the true definition of poverty goes deeper.\n\nPoverty is extreme hunger, losing a loved one to a preventable illness and not knowing how to read or write. Poverty is feeling hopeless, powerless and overwhelmed by need in all areas of life.\n\nOur Child Sponsorship Program allows you to support your sponsored child until they reach the age of 18 to 22, depending on the country.\n\nWe hope you’ll be able to support your sponsored child until he or she completes the program, but we recognize that circumstances sometimes change. You may discontinue your sponsorship at any time.\n\nIt’s important to know that a child’s circumstances may change too. For example, sometimes families move beyond the reach of our program. We’ll let you know if circumstances change for your sponsored child and will give you the opportunity to support another child in need.\n\nYes. We encourage sending monetary gifts as a sign of love and support for your sponsored child. These funds, handled by staff and volunteers who know your sponsored child, are used to purchase necessary or desired items that will benefit them most.\n\nYou can also give to your sponsored child's family, helping them acquire essential items like furniture, livestock or food supplies. Learn more about gift-giving.\n\nAs a sponsor, you can write to your sponsored child, either through physical mail or online through our website or app. Once you become a sponsor, we’ll provide guidance and practical tips about writing to the child you’re supporting.\n\nAfter you send a message, our field staff will translate and deliver it to your sponsored child. We recommend writing two to six times a year, but you may write to the child you sponsor as often as you like.\n\nYour sponsored child will write to you at least twice a year — and up to six times per year, depending on the frequency of your messages. A tutor or staff member will help children who don’t yet read and write.\n\nYou’ll also receive an annual message from a local leader, such as a pastor or staff member, to help you learn even more about your sponsored child’s region.\n\nWhile we encourage each of our sponsors to write to their sponsored child, you are not required to send messages. Even if you don’t write to your sponsored child, they will write you at least twice per year.\n\nCompassion understands that writing can be a time-consuming process and strives to make your writing experience as easy as possible. We offer both printed and online message templates for your convenience.\n\nRemember, you don’t have to say much to let your sponsored child know you care. Even just a birthday and Christmas card each year can be incredibly meaningful!\n\nJesus is at the heart of our ministry, influencing our programs and actions. Your sponsored child will have the opportunity to hear about Jesus and be encouraged to develop a relationship with God.\n\nThrough our partnership with the local church, children are connected to a local Christian community where they are offered a Bible, learn more about the gospel and can grow in their faith."
