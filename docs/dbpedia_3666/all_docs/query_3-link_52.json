        "text": "As you can see from the photos, we at Sunflower Apartments (subsidized senior high-rise in Merriam, KS) had a fantastic time Friday morning courtesy of our good friends, Natasha Belcher-Hess, and her husband, Don Hess, of KC Shoe Stop and KC Secured Health Solutions! Natasha & Don brought in a TON of pastries and contracted with Ms. Rachel Larson, owner & operator of Fika Coffee KC, to serve up some of the best coffee in the area – hot and cold! My people didn’t just come for the treats; they had a LOT of good questions that Don & Natasha were more than capable of answering. We like folks who know their business! I’ve known and worked with Natasha and Don for many years. They are darn good people – trustworthy and personable – and they have my stamp of approval. If you have questions about Medicare Advantage Plans or standardized Medicare supplemental insurance, and/or an interest about Medicare-approved diabetic footwear, contact them: you will not be sorry! (913) 486-1190\n\nWhen someone does a good job, I tell people about them. ~~~~ One of my residents, an older adult who no longer drives, was having trouble getting some highly important prescriptions filled. Even though it's not part of my regular duties, this was something urgent, so I volunteered to drive over to Ken's Pharmacy to see if they could get the job done for her. I thrilled to say they stopped what they were doing to attend to my resident's needs. Ken and his staff were kind, courteous, concerned, and moved swiftly to get the scripts filled. My resident was very pleased when I got back to work and handed her her medications! Before today, I only knew Ken's by reputation; I'd never set foot in the shop. The interaction I had with them today exceeded my expectations, and I will happily and confidently send them business!\n\nThis is Bluejacket Pool in Overland Park, KS. I was there earlier this evening with my youngest son, Sam. Today was not pool weather. It was in the high 70s at the time of this shot. So why the crowd? Today was the final day for this pool, Overland Park has decided to close it permanently, and folks came out in droves to make the statement that the pool matters to them. The city says, and I quote: \"The pool has reached the end of its useful life, as outlined in the Overland Park Parks and Recreation Master Plan.\" I dunno, looks pretty useful to me.\n\nMy youngest son, 31 year-old Sam, pictured earlier today, is a person with autism and epilepsy. He is not a small man, and he’s the very definition of flat-footed. Sam’s on the Wibit at Tomahawk Aquatic Center in Overland Park, KS. When this feature was first installed, it took him a whole lot of attempts to figure out how to walk across the inflated tubes to get to the rungs of the Wibit’s pyramid – which had its own learning curve – but once he figured it out, he had it down pat. It looks easy, but trust me: it isn’t. I’ve seen plenty of macho dads give it a try only to fall, quite ungracefully, on their tails and end up floundering upside-down in the pool. I think about such efforts and successes when I have difficulty learning something new. More than once, my youngest son has proved an inspiration.\n\nJohnson County Northeast Offices 6000 Lamar, Mission, KS. I came to advance vote (north side of the hall) and renew vehicle tags (south side, just across the hall). Voting took 7 minutes and everyone I dealt with smiled at me and made me feel like a million bucks. To renew my tags, I endured a queue-time of 5 hours and 23 minutes for a job that took the young girl behind the desk right at 8 minutes to do. To her credit, she smiled big enough that I forgot about any earlier impatientence. Any day that involves voting AND smiles is a good one.\n\n[Your Friday moment of peace & wonder begins now.] I’m sure you’re curious as to whether the amazing creature pictured here happens to be a fearsome Tasmanian Devil. Set any worries aside, this feline cutie – once fed – is as mellow as they come. You are looking at Tomato-Box Kitty, one of several ferals I care for. (I’ll get to her name in a moment.) Where did she come from? I have no idea. I greet her and others like her when they arrive, and I keep the food coming thereafter. The arrangement seems to work for all concerned. ~~~~ See the rust-colored band around the kitty’s upper-middle? From the top of the band to her nose, Tomato-Box is a short-haired black cat. Beginning at the top of the band and going out to her tail, Tomato-Box is a long-haired black cat. My next-door neighbor to the east has a home-made wooden box – a tomato-box planter – that she plants tomatoes and peppers in each year. As soon as my neighbor is finished planting and turns away, Tomato-Box Kitty – apparently no lover of vegetables – promptly rips the plants out of the box and banishes their remains from Eden. The box is hers. That’s where she lives. [End Friday moment of peace & wonder.]"
