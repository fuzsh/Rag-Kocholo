        "text": "I don’t mean to offend any of you art connoisseurs, but this Picasso painting, Dora Maar, is downright ugly in my estimation. However, it is true that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I guess that’s why someone paid 95.2 million dollars for that painting at auction. Truthfully, I dislike most of Picasso’s work, yet some of it has sold for more than 100 million dollars. As they say, to each his own.\n\nAs for me, I would rather have a Thomas Kinkade. His artwork may not be as famous or as costly as Picassos’, but it is far more aesthetic. Known as the “painter of light,” Kinkade offers us a more realistic and pleasant portrayal of the world. Even so, his paintings only sell from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand.\n\nEven if I had ninety-five million dollars to spend on a single painting I wouldn’t, especially not a Picasso. He may be considered an artistic genius but I just can’t get past the grotesque appearance of his subject matters.\n\nI can’t even begin to imagine why someone would choose a ‘disfigured’ painting like Dora Maar over one that is serene, such as Kinkade’s Stillwater Cottage. Then again, I can’t imagine why my Lord, Jesus Christ, would find such value in me. If not for His grace, my life would still look more like a Picasso than a Kinkade. It wouldn’t matter though. Ugly as my life was, Jesus paid much more than $95 million dollars for me; He paid for me –and for you – with His own life.\n\nLike the Picasso, I may not seem attractive to some. But again, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. It doesn’t matter if I like Picasso’s work or not, he will always be considered a great artist and his work will always be highly prized.\n\nLikewise, it doesn’t matter if others like the way my life looks or not –and that includes my physical appearance – because I was created by THE artist who created the heavens and earth and colored our world with beauty and splendor. As long as my life is one of the ‘paintings’ in God’s gallery, I will continue to have value beyond what this world can afford.\n\nThe same holds true for you too, dear reader. Don’t ever let anyone devalue you. Even if you feel your life is a mess, you aren’t finished yet. You are a work in progress. God knows all your shortcomings and inadequacies and He still thinks you are beautiful. That’s all that matters!\n\n“The Lord does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.” (I Samuel 16:7)\n\nRays of Light Volume I now in print.\n\nClick here to order book\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nOne particularly memorable day, the pastor had a special treat planned. As congregants entered the small country sanctuary, they were greeted by the delightful aroma of fresh-baked brownies. And if I know Pastor Cory, he probably arranged for everyone to sing “Lord, I’m hungry” during Worship.\n\nStepping up to the pulpit, he stated “Today I want to speak to you about the ingredients for living a godly life.” “But first,” he offered “I want everyone to enjoy a brownie.” And they did. Everyone knew that they were about to witness another of the pastor’s illustrated sermons and they were eating it up – pardon the pun.\n\nNext, the pastor uncovered a tray of baking goods and explained that he was going to show the congregation just how to make the wonderful brownies they were enjoying. “Then” he added with an authoritative tone, “I will show you how this relates to your walk with Christ.\n\nCarefully measuring the powdered cocoa and pouring it into the mixing bowl, the pastor advised the congregation that choosing the right ingredients was of utmost importance. He then added the remaining ingredients one-by-one –flour, sugar, butter, etc—until the delicious-looking batter was nearly complete.\n\nThe pastor offered a nugget of wisdom with each addition. They were being well-fed spiritually but some were wishing they had another brownie; that is until…\n\n“The batter is nearly ready to bake, but there is one more secret ingredient to add,” the pastor said with an impish grin. As he lifted a baggie from the tray, he told everyone “I personally gathered this doggie poop a little while ago; it’s quite fresh.”\n\nAs everyone stared in disbelief, the pastor squeezed a small amount into the batter and stirred briskly. “Don’t worry” he said. “It’s only a tiny amount, you can’t even taste it, but it sure does add to the brownie.\n\nI can only imagine how the expressions changed as each person realized he or she had just eaten one of those ‘special’ brownies. Of course there was no poop in the ones they had eaten, but the very thought was enough to make one feel suddenly disgusted, or worse.\n\nPastor Cory had copied the idea for the secret ingredient brownies from a caring father who felt the need to answer his teenagers ‘why not’ questions in a very impacting way. The man had been badgered by his teens, “Why can’t we watch this movie, there’s just a little violence and language in it? What harm could there be in that?”\n\nThis conscientious father had chosen to use his ‘special’ brownies to show his teens that even a tiny amount of something bad can ruin the whole. “The small amount of ‘bad’ in the movie may not seem all that harmful, but it is as disgusting to God as this poop is to you,” he admonished, “and it is harmful whether you can “taste” it or not.\n\nNeedless to say, the movie was not watched and the brownie batter was discarded.\n\nNext time any of us sit down to watch that popular movie or read that best-selling novel, we should ask, “Is there any poop in here, even just a little?” If the answer is yes, there’s a good chance that it won’t seem nearly as appealing all of a sudden.\n\nMore importantly, we should ask if the Lord would be pleased with our choice. As the saying goes, WWJD (What would Jesus do?), . Remember, whatever ye eat, or drink, (or watch or read) or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God. (I Corinthians 10:31)\n\nHaving said all that, anyone want my recipe for cheesecake? –just kidding.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nImagine how you would feel if at some point during your engagement your fiancé said to you, “I love you and I can’t wait to marry you, but there is something you should know. I love someone else more, and I always will.” Mine did. Then he handed me a cassette tape and asked me to listen.\n\nI quickly hurried to my dorm room. With fumbling hands and pounding heart, I turned on the cassette player. My thoughts whirled during the brief music intro, then I listened to the following words:\n\nI’ll sing you a love song cause you came to my mind.\n\nIt’s not a typical love song, cause it’s one of mine.\n\nWhen I say that I love you, you know that it’s true;\n\neven though you’re number two.\n\nIt’s not that I love you less than best,\n\nFor each day I love you more and more and more.\n\nBut there can only be one first place in my heart,\n\nAnd you know who that’s for — The Lord!\n\nI know — Jesus is number one in my heart\n\nso second place will have to do for you.\n\nBut I’m counting on spending the rest of my life\n\nin love with the two of you…. (©Mickey and Becki Moore)¹\n\nMy heart leapt for joy! My prayer had been answered. I know that many people, when praying for their future spouse, offers the Lord a check list of things they desire in a mate. I only asked for three things (that he wouldn’t snore was one of them) and left the rest up to the Lord and His infinite wisdom.\n\nNumber one on my list was that I be my husband’s second place love. I prayed that he would be a godly man who loved the Lord even more than me and that he would forever do so. Not only did the Lord grant me that desire, but he confirmed it through my loving fiancé when he handed me that tape.\n\nThe Lord has such an incredible way of dropping us little ‘love notes’ which say “I heard you and I have answered your prayer.” And His timing is perfect. When Mickey and Becky Moore recorded Love Song for Number Two back in the seventies, they didn’t know the Lord would use it to confirm my prayers a decade later, but He did.\n\nA few days ago, my friend announced her daughter’s wedding date. Kati is the same age as my daughter so that unhinged me a little, being that they are both so young. But I have to face facts; my daughters are now young women who will marry one day in the near future and I must be ready. My prayer for my children is, and has always been, that they also marry godly spouses who love the Lord even more than them; because I know that the very best marriages in the world are built on godly foundations.\n\nIf you are reading this blog and you are single, but plan to marry one day, please believe me that the very best place to be is in second place. If the Lord is number one in your spouse’s heart he or she will naturally love you the way God intended.\n\nFinally, never forget that as much as you and your spouse love each other, God loves you both even more. He wants you to have a healthy, happy marriage and it will be if the Lord is in the center of it …\n\na threefold cord in not quickly broken (Ecclesiastes 4:12).\n\n****************\n\n[You may enjoy the song here: Love Song for Number Two]\n\n[¹Moore, Mickey and Becki.

After a quick scan of the crowded dining room, we spotted her at the table of an elderly couple. She and the woman were chatting away like two old school chums.\n\nBack then our little golden-haired beauty was a real people-person whom didn’t know a stranger. She had walked right up to the couple’s table and began to entertain them with her natural charm.\n\nJust as our small clan reached the table, I heard miss sunshine say, “Watch what I can do!” In an instant she turned and did the splits right there in the aisle. My heart skipped a few beats because one of the wait staff was walking towards her lugging a huge tray of hot food. Fortunately, her daddy was able to scoop her up in the nick of time, to the amusement and giggles of all.\n\nIt was quite obvious that our little girl had brightened the day for that motherly old woman. Turning her gaze towards my baby boy, she sweetly asked, “What do you do, you cute little thing?”\n\nWithout hesitation he replied, “I can count to ten in Spanish. Uno, dos, tres……”\n\n“Splendid!” she chirped. “And what about you?” she then asked my oldest.\n\n“I can count to ten in French. Un, deux, trois…”\n\nMy oldest daughter, anticipating her turn to impress the friendly couple, was already thinking. “What do I do?” she responded, as though asking herself the question. After a brief pause, her pensive look melted into a toothy grin.\n\n“I TALK!” she proudly answered.\n\nPeriodically, a friend will say to me, “I really want to do something special for the Lord, but I don’t have any special talents or gifting.” First, let me say that I believe everyone has some type of spiritual endowment with which to bless others, even if it is not easily recognizable.\n\nSecond, and this is very important, everyone has the ability to share their faith. You may not be the outgoing, social type but that’s okay. Even an introvert can find occasion to talk to others about the Lord.\n\nThis may be very surprising to those who know me personally, but I used to have great difficulty talking to anyone. However, it eventually occurred to me that I could better serve my Lord and Master if I were a bit more sociable (okay, maybe a lot more). I prayed about the situation and asked for help in taking steps towards this goal.\n\nSlowly, but surely, the Lord not only enabled me to talk to others, but to enjoy doing so. Now, by the Grace of God, I too am a people-person who does not know a stranger. I engage others in conversation every chance I get and look for opportunities to speak an encouraging word into their lives, especially those who do not know Jesus Christ as their Savior.\n\nIf you, dear reader, are uncertain as to what your spiritual endowment is, pray about it until you know then serve with confidence. Each of us have a different job to do, but every laborer is valuable and every job important. Finally, remember, Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men (Colossians 3:23 NIV).\n\nAbove all, let us all continue to share the Gospel with others. Jesus said if we don’t praise Him, the rocks will cry out. I’m sure the same is true about sharing our faith. No matter what, the Lord will find someone who is willing to speak out on His behalf. Will you be the one to say, “I TALK?”\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nPhoto: Cake Picture Gallery\n\nOnce upon a long time ago, I was reading Christian nursery rhymes¹ to my children. This Mother Goose adaptation really caught my eye:\n\nHumpty Dumpty sat on a wall,\n\nHumpty Dumpty had a great fall.\n\nHumpty Dumpty shouted, “Amen!”\n\nGod can put me together again.¹\n\nIt really is that simple –not easy, but simple.\n\nFor those of you who have suffered through heinous circumstances and might be convinced that you can never be whole again, I want you to know that I wholeheartedly understand. Truthfully, if it had not been for the grace of God I would have killed myself twenty-five years ago. I was already dead inside, disposing of the rest seemed only logical.\n\nHowever, I had been conditioned from birth to believe I couldn’t do anything right. Those degrading remarks replayed in my head like a broken record until I was convinced that I would botch even suicide and leave myself in a far worse condition. So, I prayed to God to take my life. I did not know God or if He even listened to the prayers of men. But if He did, I figured He could do a far better job of getting rid of me and my messed up life than I could.\n\nPraise God, He did take my life, but not the way I expected Him too!\n\nYou can read about how the Lord Jesus came to my rescue and gave me an entirely new life on the ‘My Testimony’ tab at the top of this page.\n\nAs a child I used to listen to the Humpty Dumpty rhyme and it brought me great sadness. I could relate to the poor egg. Whenever I heard the rhyme, I felt like I too was an egg (a rotten one) which had been boiled in the heat of hell and then cracked beyond repair. It’s a shame I did not know THE King back then.\n\n“All the king’s horses and all the king’s men couldn’t put…” me (or Humpty) together again, but THE king Himself did so! He made me whole, and He has given to me beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that I might be called a tree of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.\n\n(Isaiah 61:3)\n\nThe King longs to do the same for you because you are His child, even if you don’t know Him. He healeth the broken in heart, And bindeth up their wounds. (Psalm 147:3)\n\nYou may find, as I did, that emotional healing is a long journey. Nevertheless, the King will walk with you every step of that journey if you allow Him to. And He will never leave you nor forsake you. (Hebrews 13:5)\n\nI too would like to walk with you through your journey. If there is anything I can pray with you about, please use the contact button to leave me a private note and I will add you to my prayer list.\n\nLife is too short to live it broken and wounded. It is time to say, “Amen, God put me to together again!”\n\n¹Ainsborough Decker, Marjorie. The Christian Mother Goose’ Book of Nursery Rhymes.

He would then playfully tell us “That’s the way it was. If you don’t like it, you can just go butt a stump!” I’ve never seen anyone foolhardy enough to do this, but I did watch my drunken step-father once butt heads with an old goat. You would’ve had to been there to fully appreciate the comical skirmish so I’ll jump straight to its conclusion; the goat cleaned his clock. It seems that even docile goats can get quite aggressive when provoked.\n\nThe embarrassing defeat never dampened his love of head-butting though. I doubt he ever locked heads with another four-legged grass-eater, but he continued to derive pleasure from butting heads with me (and everyone else) every chance he got. If anyone knew how to get my goat, he did!\n\nBeing a control-freak, he found those head-to-head conflicts to be an exhilarating way to boost his own ego, but I became more frustrated with each passing day. Then someone gave me a very wise piece of advice. She told me, “He can’t get your goat if you don’t tell him where you keep it tied.” She was right. With this little nugget of wisdom I was able to turn the tables.\n\nAfter all these years I have never forgotten this and have, in fact, tried to instill the concept in my children. Unfortunately, they still haven’t quite figured it out. Frustrating as this is, it is certainly understandable. You see, it really irks me when……oops, I almost led you to one of my goats. Never mind.\n\nMore to the point, I don’t tend to make New Year’s resolutions because frankly, I’m never disciplined enough to follow-through on them for more than a day or two. Even so, I have realized lately that I have allowed a few people to find out where my own goats are tied and have therefore resolved to fix this little faux pas before any serious problems arise.\n\nAfter all, there is a reason I keep certain of my goats tethered in the first place; they are not docile and it doesn’t take much to rile them. Some of these goats used to graze peacefully in the meadows of nonchalant but after a season of agitation, they became a bit aggressive and had to be constrained. I prefer to keep them that way.\n\nYou may ask, “Why don’t you just get rid of them altogether?” Truthfully, not all goats are bad; some merely need to be tamed. They can be very useful for refining us and teaching us to respond properly to adverse stimuli.\n\nNo matter how careful I am, someone always manages to get one of my goats at some point. So, I can either choose to butt heads with them, or I can take the higher road and cultivate the wisdom of Proverbs 19:11 The discretion of a man maketh him slow to anger; And it is his glory to pass over a transgression.\n\nAdmittedly, I sometimes butt heads instinctively, but I am working toward the latter. I won’t call it a New Year’s resolution since I’m not very successful with those, but I am continuing to strive toward greater long-suffering. Others may choose to be confrontational but from now on, I don’t plan to join them.\n\nHey, if they don’t like that they can “just go butt a stump!”\n\nRead Full Post »"
