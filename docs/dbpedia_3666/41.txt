AGCI is a faith-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Our work to take down Systemic Trauma and stand up for every child who needs family depends on the financial support of our global Trauma Disruptor community.

We work relentlessly to receive the highest grades possible for accountability and transparency.

Not only can you trust us with your generosity, you can trust our efficacy as the only international organization that qualifies as both a TBRI® ambassador and is Hague-accredited.

All God’s Children International is a ministry that disrupts trauma and advocates for children so they get the love and hope that every child deserves.

We believe every gift, regardless of the size or type of contribution, must be stewarded in a manner that is consistent with our calling to disrupt trauma and advocate for each child.

All God’s Children International is accredited by the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA). We are committed to the utmost standards of stewardship, financial responsibility, and accounting practices. An independent public accounting firm audits our financial statements annually. Our current financial statement is available upon request.

Under state and federal laws, our Board of Directors must have official control of the organization’s funds and the freedom to allocate these funds in a manner which will carry out the expressed mission of AGCI. We will exert every effort to honor any stated donation designation or preference. In certain circumstances, where the project or need is overfunded or cannot be carried out in accordance with the donor’s preference, the funds will be used for similar projects or needs approved by our Board of Directors.

Contributions to AGCI may be tax-deductible. Please contact your tax accountant or visit irs.gov (Publication 526) for further information.
