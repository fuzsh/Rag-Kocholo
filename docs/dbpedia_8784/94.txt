Mauritius Currency History:

The local rupee was established by law in 1876 as the local currency of Mauritius. Before the introduction of the Mauritian Rupees the currency of Mauritius was the Indian Rupees. The rupee was chosen due to the massive inflow of Indian rupees following the Indian immigration to Mauritius.

The local (Mauritian) rupee was introduced in 1877, replacing the Indian rupee, sterling and the Mauritian dollar, with the Mauritian rupee equal to one Indian rupee or half a Mauritian dollar.
