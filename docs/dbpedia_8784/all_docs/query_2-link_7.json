        "text": "Overview of Currency in Mauritius\n\nAs we saw earlier, the currency in Mauritius is the Mauritian rupee.\n\nAs the official legal tender in Mauritius, it's the sole currency recognized by the Mauritian government, and you can use it to settle all financial obligations in the country, from paying for your hotel stay, to the entrance fee at the Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Botanical Garden, to a bite to eat in Flic-en-Flac.\n\nNote that if you plan to buy a large sum of rupee banknotes and bring them home unused with you after your holiday, you'll probably get a bad deal on the exchange rate by swapping rupees back into your home currency since most banks and exchange offices mark up the rupees more than usual, partially to account for its inflation. This means that if you buy rupee banknotes, you should try to budget carefully to avoid bringing any home.\n\nYou can learn more about the Mauritian rupee currency here.\n\nBest Currency to Take to Mauritius\n\nBecause it's the local currency and because you won't have any trouble buying goods with it, the best country to have on hand and spend while visiting Mauritius is, unsurprisingly, the Mauritian rupee.\n\nHowever, if you arrive in Mauritius with another currency on hand, it doesn't necessarily mean you won't be allowed to pay in Mauritius. Especially if you're carrying a popular tourist currency like the pound sterling, the euro, or the US dollar, you'll find it easy to exchange them for rupees at banks or currency exchange offices across Mauritius â even if those currencies aren't official or used commercially in Mauritius.\n\nYou can check out the prevalence of a few of the most popular tourist currencies in Mauritius below:\n\nBritish pounds in Mauritius\n\nYou cannot use British pounds to pay while visiting Mauritius. However, you can withdraw rupees from Mauritian ATMs or exchange your pounds for rupees at a local bank or currency exchange office. If you're from the UK, we recommend using Revolut's travel debit card, which has market-low currency exchange charges.\n\nUS dollars in Mauritius\n\nUS dollars aren't accepted in Mauritius, but you can sometimes pay with them at the airport, hotels, resorts, or shops and restaurants in major tourist areas. If you're from the USA, we recommend using Chime's debit card, which charges no foreign exchange fees, to make low-cost card payments while travelling in Mauritius. However, out-of-network ATM withdrawal fees and over-the-counter advance fees may apply.\n\nEuros in Mauritius\n\nEuros aren't accepted in Mauritius, but you can sometimes pay with them at the airport, hotels, resorts, or shops and restaurants in major tourist areas. If you're from the European Union or EEA, we recommend using Revolut's or N26's debit cards, both of which charge no foreign exchange fees, to make low-cost card payments while travelling in Mauritius.\n\nCanadian dollars in Mauritius\n\nCanadian dollars are easily converted for rupee banknotes in Port Louis and other major tourist centres, but they'll not be accepted if you try to buy something. Exchanging Canadian dollars for rupees is typically slightly more expensive than exchanging US dollars or pounds. We recommend checking out KOHO's debit card for international travel. KOHO charges just 1.5% on foreign currency transactions abroad, which beats most credit cards and other debit cards in Canada.\n\nAlthough the Mauritian rupee is the best currency to use and other tourist currencies can be easily exchanged, exchanging currencies in the form of cash almost invariably leads to poor exchange rates for tourists (we've seen as high as 20% commissions, although the average is between 5% and 15% of the amount exchanged).\n\nFor this reason, it's generally a better idea to use your credit or debit card to pay at local points of sale wherever possible or (if cash is urgently needed â which can happen in Mauritius) to withdraw some money from a local ATM. This will let your card provider handle the conversion, which is usually, although not always, a better deal than bringing foreign currency into Mauritius and exchanging it there. However, as we'll see below, a conversion-friendly debit card is the best choice of all!\n\nChangeGroup\n\nChangeGroup is a reliable option if you need physical Mauritian rupee in cash on hand before your flight abroad to Mauritius. Although it's generally more affordable than exchange offices in Port Louis for buying rupee banknotes, it's still quite pricey compared to using your card, hovering around 15%. This is why we tend to recommend Revolut and Wise for spending in Mauritius.\n\nFX Margin to Rupee: 10% - 16%\n\nHome Delivery: For a fee\n\nCash Pick Up: Free\n\nGuaranteed Buyback: For a fee\n\nAvailability: UK, USA, Australia, Germany, France, Austria, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, Finland\n\nHow to Pay in Mauritius\n\nWhen it comes to paying your way in Mauritius, you'll have the following three options broadly speaking:\n\nMethod 1: Cash\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, cash is an important medium of exchange in Mauritius. Pretty much all shops, restaurants, and commercial establishments around the country will accept Mauritian rupee banknotes, and we recommend having some on hand when you travel. Foreign cash can be purchased before your trip from your bank in your home country, or during your trip at a local Mauritian bank or currency exchange office or (most affordably) from an ATM.\n\nNote that in Mauritius, currency exchange offices normally go by the name money changers, so if you want to exchange your home currency for Mauritian rupee, be on the lookout for signage with this name.\n\nCash Prevalence in Mauritius: Very prevalent\n\nCost to Exchange: 5% - 20% on average\n\nMethod 2: Credit Card\n\nAlthough cash is king in Mauritius, credit and debit cards issued by major global providers like VISA and Mastercard are commonly accepted too. If your card is issued by American Express, Diner's Club, or another card company, there's a good chance they'll also be accepted in Mauritius, but we recommend checking with your bank or card provider directly to make sure that Mauritian rupee currency conversion is indeed supported, and that card machines and ATMs in Mauritius commonly support cards of this type.\n\nCard Prevalence in Mauritius: Prevalent\n\nCost to Exchange: 2% - 5% on average\n\nMethod 3: Travel Debit Card\n\nJust like credit cards, prepaid debit cards (which are also normally issued by VISA or Mastercard) provide an excellent way to pay while visiting Mauritius, the main difference being that you normally pay lower fees and exchange rates. Depending on where you live, you'll probably have options from your bank or a third-party provider to use a commission-free debit card or a multi-currency card which can help you dodge high Mauritian rupee conversion costs, including DCCs.\n\nAccording to our analysis of dozens of providers, the top two options for travelling to Mauritius, in general, are the following:\n\nRevolut\n\nRevolut is an excellent option for paying in Mauritius. Its all-in-one mobile finance app and debit card offer competitive exchange rates to the Mauritian rupee and low fees. Moreover, you can easily manage everything through your money through Revolut's user-friendly app.\n\nMonthly fee: $0\n\nCard type: Mastercard debit\n\nCard payment cost in Mauritian rupee: 0.5% - 1.5%\n\nCash withdrawal fee: 0% - 2%\n\nMauritian rupee balance: No\n\nMauritian rupee bank details: No\n\nWise Account\n\nThe Wise Account is another great option for paying in Mauritian rupee. It gives you the lowest possible currency exchange rates with complete transparency and no hidden fees. It also allows you to hold and manage over 50 currencies in one account and provides fast and secure cross-border money transfers at a fraction of the cost of traditional banks.\n\nMonthly fee: $0\n\nCard type: VISA debit\n\nCard payment cost in Mauritian rupee: 0.5% - 1.5%\n\nCash withdrawal fee: 0% - 2%\n\nMauritian rupee balance: No\n\nMauritian rupee bank details: No\n\nWise and Revolut are excellent options that are available in many countries around the world. However, depending on where you live, you might have access to better deals still. We go over a few of them below:\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nRevolut: Best spending and budgeting app.\n\nWise: Best for multiple foreign currency balances.\n\nUnited States\n\nChimeÂ®: Best all around; no fees for non-USD transactions.\n\nRevolut: Best all-around spending app.\n\nWise: Best for foreign currency spending and holidays.\n\nCanada\n\nKOHO: Best all around; just 1.5% on foreign transactions\n\nWise: Best for foreign currency spending and holidays.\n\nEuropean Union\n\nRevolut: Excellent for spending abroad.\n\nN26: Best full bank account with low fees (even abroad)\n\nbunq: Best credit card (also a fully-licensed bank)."
