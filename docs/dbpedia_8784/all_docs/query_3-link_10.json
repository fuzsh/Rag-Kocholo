        "text": "Mauritius currency\n\nThe rupee\n\nThe preferred currency for Mauritius is our local money: namely the ‘rupee’. Many tourists have asked me if they can use foreign currency on the island. Mauritians prefer payment in local currency. Some establishments will accept your foreign money but then you’ll lose on the exchange rate plus your change will be given to you in rupees.\n\nThe Mauritius currency symbol is MUR. Like elsewhere we have paper money, coins and cents. Have a look at the image below to see them all.\n\nMauritius Rupee notes come in the following denominations:\n\n2000, 1000, 500, 200, 100, 50 and 25 rupees notes.\n\nMauritius Rupee Coins:\n\nRs 20, 10, 5, 1.\n\nThere are 100 cents in one rupee.\n\n50, 20 and 5 cents coins.\n\nTips for best exchange rates\n\nWhere should you buy Mauritius currency?\n\nDon’t change your money into rupees before you travel to our country. Change your money into rupees on arrival at Mauritius airport. The money exchange counters will be open even if you arrive in the middle of the night. Keep in mind you should be offered a better rate for large amounts.\n\nDon't worry if for some reason you did not have time to exchange your money at the airport. We have foreign exchange offices and ATM machines throughout the island. You'll have better rates at money changers than at banks or hotels.\n\nCredit cards are widely accepted in Mauritius: Visa, MasterCard, Diners and American Express. Check with your bank if they charge a fee to process cash withdrawals from ATM machines overseas.\n\nPassports are usually required for money transactions. Bank debit cards and credit cards will require your PIN number.\n\nWarning: Check with your bank if your debit/maestro card will be accepted in ATM in Mauritius. New Security regulations mean you might not be able to use these types of bank cards to withdraw money at ATM in non-European countries.\n\nIf you still have some travellers cheques from a previous holiday you will find it difficult to change them on the island as they are being phased out.\n\nHow much money to take?\n\nYou can spend your holiday in Mauritius as inexpensively as on any other tropical island or you can stay in 5 star plus hotels, travel by helicopter, dine in gourmet restaurants and splash out with your credit cards.\n\nThe spending money you need depends on what you want to do according to your budget. So it’s a little difficult for me to give you an answer.\n\nChanging money into Mauritius currency\n\nWe have a well-respected foreign exchange called Shibani Finance Co. Ltd with 16 branches across the island including the arrival and departure halls at the airport. The company was awarded “the Laurier d’or 2015” (Gold Laurel in English) by the Federation International du Tourisme on 24th January 2015.\n\nFor instant exchange rate and to see how much our Mauritius money is worth:\n\nhttp://www.shibanifinance.com/pages/exchangerate.php\n\nNames and currency codes\n\nAED UAE Dirham\n\nAUD Australian Dollar\n\nCAD Canadian Dollar\n\nCHF Swiss Franc\n\nCNY Chinese Yuan Renminbi\n\nDKK Danish Kroner\n\nEUR Euro\n\nGBP British Pound Sterling\n\nHKD Hong Kong Dollar\n\nINR Indian Rupee\n\nJPY Japanese Yen\n\nNOK Norwegian Krone\n\nNZD New Zealand Dollar\n\nSAR Saudi Arabian Riyal\n\nSEK Swedish kronor\n\nSGD Singapore Dollar\n\nUSD US Dollar\n\nZAR South African Rand\n\nThomas Cooks has branches on the island where you can also change money.\n\nHow did we land up with a Mauritius currency called the rupee?\n\nIt has to do with our fascinating history and Indian immigration which started in the nineteen century. Indians were brought over to the island to work in sugar plantations as cheap labour. It triggered an influx of Indian rupees and the name stuck!\n\nThe Mauritius rupee became the official currency in 1876 and was put into circulation a year later.\n\nHome > Travel to Mauritius > Mauritius currency"
