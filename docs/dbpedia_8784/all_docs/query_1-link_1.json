        "text": "The official currency in Mauritius is the Mauritian Rupee (MUR).\n\nThe exchange rate makes you feel like you’re a millionaire. Clearly it fluctuates but one rupee is worth around 2p, which means you can have Rs25,000 in your wallet and feel very wealthy although it’s actually worth about £500. The smallest note is Rs25, worth around 50p. You’ll use notes far more than coins, which are of little value. A 10-cent coin is worth less than a quarter of a penny.\n\nOf course, you’ll want to get the best exchange rate and there are a few ways to make sure you get great value when you’re picking up your spending money.\n\nUsually we advise travellers to buy your currency in the UK before you fly.\n\nBut in the case of currency in Mauritius it’s better to leave it until you arrive because, surprisingly, the best exchange rates for the rupee are on the island itself. And the airport, which usually offers the worst rates of all, has good deals.\n\nA safe alternative is to take a prepaid travel card. It can be used at cash machines, and with chip and pin and credit card readers worldwide. Of course, there’s always travellers’ cheques. Few businesses accept them as direct payment today, but they’re still a great way to pick up a bargain exchange rate, and then change back to cash when you need it.\n\nWithdrawing Mauritian rupees from a local cash machine is also an option, as there are plenty of ATMs around the island. But make sure you’re aware of any charges and limits your bank may have. Some may charge you to withdraw in a foreign country, so make sure you check before you head out on holiday."
