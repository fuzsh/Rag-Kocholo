Currency notes are available in denominations of 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000.US Dollar is widely accepted in Mauritius, so you can carry those as well for emergencies.

So getting exchanged to the local currency can be very cost-effective.\n\nTo enjoy the lucrative rate of exchange, exchange bigger amounts of money. The rate in Mauritius is much better. When you arrive at the airport in Mauritius you will see a host of exchange bureaus at the arrival halls. Just bring your own currency and change it over there for a better deal. If you do not manage to change at the arrival halls there are branches of authorised money exchangers, where you can get your exchange done, before you begin your Mauritius trip.\n\nVisa, MasterCard, Diners and American Express debit and credit cards are widely accepted all over Mauritius. But you will need to confirm with your bank if your debit card will be accepted in Mauritius’ ATMs as it varies from bank to bank.\n\nTo save yourself the hassle of exchanging money while on your trip, get in touch with SOTC before you start your holiday.\n\nMauritius Currency\n\nKnown for its lagoons, beaches, and reefs and based in the Indian Ocean, Mauritius is an island nation that makes for a perfect laid back vacation destination.

Before this, the Mauritian currency was the Indian rupees. Mauritian rupee was chosen keeping in mind the huge inflow of the Indian rupees because of the number of Indians migrating into Mauritius.\n\nThe Indian rupee, the Mauritian dollar, and the sterling were replaced in the year 1877 with Mauritian rupee. During this time, 1 Mauritian rupee equalled to half a Mauritian dollar and one Indian rupee. The exchange rate of pound sterling was 10.25 rupees during that time.\n\nBest place to exchange currency in Mauritius\n\nCarrying Mauritius currency is a must when traveling to Mauritius. If by any chance you missed out exchanging your money in your home country, then there are many places in Mauritius to get your local currency exchanged for Mauritius country currency.\n\nAs soon as you land into the Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport in Mauritius you will find many exchange bureaus where you can get your money exchanged for Mauritian currency. However, be aware that you may not get the best exchange rate here. Instead, you can reach the city center and get your money exchanged at a legal money exchange counter where you are sure to get a better deal on the exchange rate. Always check the ongoing exchange rate to know of the present exchange rate so that you do not get charged astronomically.\n\nAnother way to get your money exchanged in Mauritius is to withdraw money from the ATMs at the airport. If your bank has a tie-up with a bank in Mauritius then withdrawing money from that ATM will save on the ATM fees. Make sure to intimate your bank about your travel dates and that you may use your card in a foreign land during your travel period. You may also get your local money exchanged for Mauritius country money by approaching a bank.\n\nWhichever method that you choose, make sure to carry your passport for any kind of money transaction in Mauritius.\n\nDigital transactions in Mauritius\n\nCards, mobile payments, and digital wallets are all accepted in Mauritius. It is a good idea to make purchases using your credit card instead of carrying cash everywhere in Mauritius. However, you would still need some Mauritius currency because smaller outlets may not accept digital payments.\n\nAll the major debit and credit cards are accepted in Mauritius. This includes MasterCard, Visa, American Express and Amex cards. Make sure to check with your bank before you leave your home country if your bank card is accepted in Mauritius. As per some regulations in the country, not all bank cards can be used in Mauritius. There is also a fee on swiping your card in payment outlets in Mauritius. Inform your bank about your travel dates and that you may be swiping your card in Mauritius.\n\nDigital transactions are becoming popular in Mauritius and people have embraced it. Rest assured that any digital transaction that you carry out in Mauritius at the legal outlets will be safe without any risk of data theft or fraud.\n\nTipping in Mauritius\n\nYou do not want to sound impolite or rude when traveling so know the tipping etiquettes in advance before traveling to a foreign country. It can be vexing to figure out how much to tip, whom to tip and when to tip.\n\nIn Mauritius, you should not feel obliged to offer tips. You can tip anyone who offers good service to you, of course. A 5-10% percent of the bill amount should be good enough to tip. The tipping policy here is pretty straightforward. You tip the employees that offer service. This includes the bartender, driver, tour guide, porter, bellmen or anyone who has been helpful. The amount can be decided based on the type and how satisfied you are with the service. Always tip the person in the Mauritius island currency and at the end of their service."
