        "text": "An Australian Traveller's Money Guide to Currency Exchange in Mauritius\n\nBreathtaking powder-white beaches, lushly carpeted volcanic peaks and fields of swaying sugar cane mark out this gorgeous Indian Ocean island. With stunning mountainous sceneries, beautiful beaches and some of the best hotels, luxury spa and experiences in the world, Mauritius has something for everyone. If you're looking for a holiday full of fun and relaxation, look no further.\n\nCheck out our handy and comprehensive guide – perfect for finding the best way to take your money to Mauritius.\n\nWhat currency is used in Mauritius\n\nConverting Mauritian currency to Australian dollars\n\nCurrency exchange in Mauritius\n\nHow to buy currency before you leave\n\nUsing bank cards in Mauritius\n\nThe average costs of things in Mauritius\n\nWhat Is the Best Currency to Use in Mauritius?\n\nThe best currency to use in Mauritius is the Mauritian Rupee. It’s represented by the international code MUR and the currency symbol ₨.\n\nThe Mauritian Rupee comprises a mixture of banknotes and coins. Mauritian currency come in denominations of 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 notes and 1 Rupee is divided into 100 cents.\n\nCan I Use Australian Dollars in Mauritius?\n\nAs the local currency is the Mauritian Rupee, bear in mind that Australian dollars are not accepted in Mauritius. In fact, the Aussie dollar has no value to locals and will need to be converted into Mauritian Rupee to make your trip a smooth one.\n\nWhat Currency Do They Accept in Mauritius?\n\nAs the unit of currency in Mauritius is the Mauritian Rupee, it is strongly recommended for you to acquire the local banknotes and coins prior to your trip. There are also foreign exchangers located at the airport to exchange currencies including Australia, US or New Zealand dollars for the local currency.\n\nUsing Your Bank Card in Mauritius\n\nIn Mauritius, ATMs are widely available in most towns in the island and at large shopping centres. Most hotels, restaurants and large retailers accept major credit and debit cards.\n\nWhether you choose to pay with your card in Mauritius is still up to you, as long as you’re aware of the fees and charges incurred by the respective cards.\n\nDebit Cards\n\nDebit cards in Mauritius are best used for ATM withdrawals and card payments. They’re reliable, secure and convenient, which makes them a must-have while you’re out and about.\n\nDepending on which card you use, you may face excessive bank fees for each transaction. These fees may include foreign ATM withdrawal fees and conversion fees.\n\nTo make your trip hassle-free, look for a bank card that’s designed for frequent travellers. Some travel-friendly debit cards that waive a portion of the charges include Wise, ING, Citibank and Revolut.\n\nCredit Cards\n\nYou’ll be able to use credit cards at most locations around Mauritius and at ATMs, but remember to have cash on hand when you’re exploring smaller islands.\n\nSome credit cards come with attractive features for frequent travellers, including complimentary travel insurance, rewards points, and additional security measures.\n\nBut the perks are countered by some exorbitant charges if you use your card overseas, including:\n\nInternational transaction fees\n\nHigh exchange rate margins\n\nATM fees\n\nPotential ‘cash advance fees’ if you use an ATM\n\nAs with debit cards, there are some exceptions. Bankwest Platinum and 28 Degrees cards are designed for travellers and waive the currency conversion fees.\n\nPrepaid Travel Cards\n\nLock in a favourable exchange rate with prepaid travel cards. Bonus: You also get a handy back-up card!\n\nEven though they are convenient, you could end up with hidden fees. Some travel cards still impose the following:\n\nCurrency conversion fees\n\nUncompetitive exchange rates\n\nInternational ATM withdrawal fees\n\nReload fees\n\nInactivity fees\n\nCurrency Converter for Mauritian Rupee\n\nThe Mauritian Rupee (MUR) is relatively stable to the Australian dollar (AUD) and the New Zealand dollar. Converting AUD to AED is easy with our currency conversion tool.\n\nSimply enter in the value and currencies to figure out how much it would cost you to buy Mauritian Rupees with S Money today. We use the same mid-market rate you’d find on Google or XE.com.\n\nAUD to MUR\n\nFrom\n\nAustralian Dollars (AUD)\n\n⇆\n\nTo\n\nMUR\n\nSo is this a good rate?\n\n30.8611\n\nLow\n\n29.5759 Average\n\n31.4245 High\n\n33.273\n\nToday's rate is lower than the average rate to buy MUR. This chart compares today's rate to the average rate from the past 90 days.\n\nHow to Exchange Currency in Mauritius\n\nHaving local bills in your wallet while you explore Mauritius would make travelling easy. Mauritius is an island nation with plenty of ATMs that widely accepts major credit cards, but you'll probably need cash for the small islands.\n\nATMs in Mauritius\n\nThere are ATMs scattered throughout Mauritius so it’ll be easy for you to find one. There are ATMs in banks, hotels, most towns in the island and at large shopping centres.\n\nImportant note: Make sure you notify your bank about your travels. If you don’t, they could consider any purchases in Mauritius as suspicious activity and freeze your card.\n\nCurrency Exchange in Mauritius\n\nThere are various ways to convert your AUD into MUR. At the airport, there are foreign exchange currency shops and ATM machines with reasonable exchange rates where you can withdraw funds using your credit card. There are also bank branches located around Mauritius for you to exchange currency as well.\n\nTravellers Cheques\n\nWe would not recommend travellers cheques as they are hardly used in Mauritius and banks will charge a high commission and exchange rate. You’ll get more value out of alternatives such as ATM withdrawals and direct cash exchanges.\n\nBuying Mauritian Rupee Before You Go\n\nBuying Mauritian Rupees before you leave home can be a seamless process, with three main options to suit your needs:\n\nBuy MUR online and have it delivered or collect it in-store.\n\nBuy from a bureau de change.\n\nBuy at your home airport.\n\nSince bureau de change desks at Australian airports are renowned for their poor rates, we recommend avoiding them and picking up your currency ahead of time.\n\nA fuss-free way to secure your travel money is to order it online. It can be delivered to your door or made available for pick-up at a convenient location. Online currency providers offer competitive deals you’re unlikely to find elsewhere. For example, S Money offers the same rate listed on Google and XE.com.\n\nIf you’re in the city, an alternative is to visit a CBD bureau de change. Suburban outlets don’t have the competition to keep prices low and banks often supply high fees and poor rates.\n\nHow Much Cash Should I Bring to Mauritius?\n\nAvoid having leftover foreign cash at the end of your trip! If you’re not sure where to start, we’ve got you. Simply calculate your budget and plan accordingly.\n\nNow, your budget depends entirely on whether you prefer to backpack or a more luxurious experience. It’s also highly affected by your travel itinerary.\n\nHere are some of the average costs to help you calculate your own budget (all quoted in Mauritian Rupees):\n\n5,200 MUR\n\nOne night stay at a 3-star hotel\n\n1,000 MUR\n\nMeal at restaurant\n\n95 MUR\n\nBottle of beer\n\n38 MUR\n\nLocal transportation\n\n275 MUR\n\nA movie\n\nTrack the best time to buy currency\n\nWe match the currency exchange rate with the rate shown on Google or Xe. In real time.\n\nThis means you never pay over-inflated rates and can be 100% positive you are getting the most competitive rate for currency exchange.\n\nCheck out the daily rates:\n\nNot ready to buy yet?\n\nYou can get a free rate tracker!"
