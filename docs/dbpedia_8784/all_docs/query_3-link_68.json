        "text": "No, you'll get more for your Mauritian rupees if you sell when the Mauritian rupee buyback rate is low. This is due to a quirk of how British currency providers display their buyback exchange rates.\n\nWhen you buy Mauritian rupees, the exchange rate you get is the amount of Mauritian rupees you'll receive for every pound that you spend, so for example a rate of 61.8595 means you'd get Rs. 61.8595 for each £1 that you spend. You can calculate the total amount of Mauritian rupees you'd receive for a given amount of sterling by simply multiplying the sterling amount by the exchange rate.\n\nWhen it comes to selling Mauritian rupees, the buyback rate is expressed in terms of how many Mauritian rupees you'd need to sell in order to get £1, so a buyback rate of 61.8595 means you'd need to sell Rs. 61.8595 to get £1. To calculate the sterling value of a given amount of Mauritian rupees, you need to divide the Mauritian rupee amount by the buyback rate. Since you're dividing by the buyback rate, a lower buyback rate means you'd get more sterling compared to a higher buyback rate.\n\nOur product comparisons are completely unbiased and we never allow companies to pay to be at the top of any results. Instead, some companies pay us a small commission for referring customers to them which helps to fund our costs and keeps our service free to you. This does not affect the quotes you receive or the price you pay.\n\nWe carry out stringent and regular checks on the companies that feature on our website, but even so we cannot guarantee their solvency. Please conduct your own due diligence before transacting with a company, and pay by card wherever possible as cards offer more financial protection than paying by bank transfer."
