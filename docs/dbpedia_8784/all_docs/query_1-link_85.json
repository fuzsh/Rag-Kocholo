        "text": "Useful Tips\n\nMauritius is a safe holiday destination, easily accessed by air with a lot of great experiences to live. We have gathered some useful information for your stay in Mauritius to take place in the best possible conditions.\n\nGeneral\n\nAlthough the official language is English, Mauritians are fluent in French and Creole.\n\nTime zone is Universal Time plus four hours (GMT/UTC +4).\n\nThe national currency is the Mauritian rupee, split in 100 cents. One euro is equivalent to about 45 Mauritian rupees.\n\nThe electrical plugs used are the British three-square pin and two round pin plugs. Voltage 220/230V.\n\nTips are not mandatory but are welcome based on your appreciation.\n\nAt the airport\n\nIf you do not have a pre-arranged transfer, you will easily find a taxi at the airport. Agree on the amount of the trip with the driver before embarking.\n\nATMs are available for currency exchange and cash withdrawals.\n\nDress Up\n\nCasual outfits (shorts, t-shirts, flip flops) are generally accepted throughout the day. Nevertheless, please dress soberly as you enter places of worship. Before travelling, check with your hotel for evening attire – many have dress codes (pants, no T-shirts, no flip flops).\n\nAccommodation\n\nWhen choosing your accommodation, make sure that it is listed with the Tourism Authority to ensure compliance with security standards and measures (http://www.tourismauthority.mu/en/)\n\nPlease use the safe provided by hotels, guest rooms and other tourist residences to keep your valuables, passport and money.\n\nBe sure to close all room windows and doors when you go out.\n\nAt the beach\n\nDo not purchase products or services from unauthorised persons. If in doubt, ask for their operating licence.\n\nAlways ask for the price before any purchase.\n\nWatch out for those that are too tenacious.\n\nMake sure your purse is out of sight and don’t bring valuables with you.\n\nBeaches are accessible to all in Mauritius, but in front of private residences and hotels, the public can only stand or walk within the high water mark.\n\nMarkets\n\nAlways ask for the price before any purchase. Bargaining is accepted in markets.\n\nTransportation\n\nHitchhiking is not practised in Mauritius\n\nIf you are organising a transport with your accommodation, agree on the rate before confirming your trip.\n\nTaxis offer tours, but be aware that some proposals may be motivated by commissions guaranteed by some traders.\n\nDriving\n\nCars drive on the left-hand side in Mauritius, giving way to vehicles coming from the right.\n\nVisitors holding a valid driver’s licence issued by the relevant authorities have the right to drive while staying in Mauritius.\n\nWildlife\n\nThere are no dangerous or deadly poisonous animals in Mauritius. There are, however, some species with painful stings, and in some rare cases that cause allergies, such as wasps or bees. Please consult a doctor or pharmacist if this happens.\n\nThe lagoons are protected by the reefs, so no shark attacks to fear. There are nevertheless a few creatures to watch out for, such as stone fish and lionfish whose stings are extremely painful, sea urchins, and jellyfish which are nastily itchy. The presence of these jellyfish is usually indicated as it happens occasionally. It is recommended to see a doctor in all cases.\n\nSea outings\n\nWhen you go out to sea, make sure that the boat you are taking has a registration number beginning with “PC” assigned to those used for commercial purposes.\n\nFollow the instructions of the skippers and accompanying staff. Wear the required lifejacket or other required equipment at all times and do not ride on the bow of motor boats.\n\nWe are lucky to be able to watch dolphins and whales in our waters, respect them and the environment around when you go out to sea.\n\nSecurity in your place of residence\n\nUse the safe provided at your accommodation to store your valuables, passport and money.\n\nDon’t take all your devices and other objects with you during your outings (computers and other electronics).\n\nIf you misplace your room magnetic key, report it immediately to your place of residence for fast deactivation.\n\nAnd in general, don’t leave anything in plain view in your car.\n\nEmergency Numbers\n\nPolice: 999 or 112\n\nFire Services: 995 or 115\n\nSAMU Ambulances: 114\n\nNational Directory: 150\n\nTourist Info: 152\n\nWeather: 171 and 96 for cyclone reports\n\nAirline information: 603 3030"
