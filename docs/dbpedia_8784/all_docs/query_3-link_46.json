        "text": "What Is the Seychelles Rupee (SCR)?\n\nSCR is the abbreviation for the Seychelles rupee, the official currency of the island nation of Seychelles. Seychelles is an archipelago of 115 landmasses in the Indian Ocean off the East Africa coastline. One rupee can be subdivided into 100 cents. The Central Bank of Seychelles controls and manages the rupee through its monetary policy.\n\nIn native Creole Seychellois (Seselwa) dialect, it is known the roupi. As of February 2021, 1 SCR is worth approximately U.S. $0.047.\n\nUnderstanding the Seychelles Rupee\n\nSeychelles established rupees as the national currency in 1914 while it was still a British colony. The country also accepted currency from its neighbor, the Mauritian rupee. The British Board of Commissioners of Currency continued to issue banknotes in 1918, 1928, and 1951.\n\nSeychelles gained independence in 1976, and the Seychelles Monetary Authority assumed the responsibilities of issuing money. By 1979, the Central Bank of Seychelles took full responsibility for monetary policy and the circulation of currency. Newer, more secure series of notes came in 1989, 1998, and 2011 with the 2011 issue using a holograph. The most recent series of Seychelles rupees were issued in 2016 as the nation celebrated 40 years of independence.\n\nUntil 2008, the value of the Seychelles Rupee was pegged to a basket made up of 59% euros (EUR), 31% British pounds (GBP), and 10% US dollars (USD). The Rupee was freely floated on November 2, 2008, and lost 43% of its value in the first day of forex trading.\n\nAt first, the country only issued banknotes in denominations of 50 cents and then 1, 5, and 10 rupees. Coins came into use in 1939. The SCR coins come in values of 1, 5, 10, and 25 cents, and then 1, 5, and 10 rupees. Paper currency now includes denominations of 25, 50, 100, and 500 rupees. The colorful currency features wildlife that calls the islands or the surrounding ocean home. The 50-rupee note shows a tuna, an aquatic bird, and tropical fish. The 100-rupee note depicts a tortoise, seagulls, and some more fish.\n\nSeychelles Economy\n\nSeychelles is now part of the African Union and the United Nations (UN). The island nation consists of numerous islands, some of which are inhabitable, and covers a land area about 2.5 times the size of Washington, D.C. Around 90% of the nation's 96,000 inhabitants live on Mahe, the largest island in the chain. Major economic activities include tourism, fishing, coconut harvesting, and growing vanilla beans. Agricultural products include sweet potatoes, bananas, and cassava. Most of the islands are made of granite and are unsuitable for farming. The nation sets aside 42% of its land mass for conservation.\n\nThe services sector, including tourism, produces 83.7% of the nation's annual GDP which brings in about $2.9 billion in economic activity. Tourism employs around 26% of the islands' 51,000 laborers. The country has a large disparity in income and poverty is widespread. According to World Bank data, Seychelles experienced a 1.8% annual inflation rate and has a gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 5.3%, as of 2019, which is the most current year of available data. Most of the growth in GDP is due to the nation's robust tourism industry. The government believes Somali pirates cost the country millions per year in lost revenue."
