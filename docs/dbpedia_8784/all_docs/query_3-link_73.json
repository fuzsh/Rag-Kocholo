Just feel a bit nervous taking nothing. Can I please check this is what people that have been to Mauritius have done? Just take their UK card?\n\nThanks and happy bank hol weekend!\n\nWhen we went to Mauritius I took currency but my husband didn't as he was going to change money at the airport.\n\nLuckily I had taken currency as the airport exchange was closed for 2 hours when we landed.\n\nI would bring currency if I were you. When we landed the exchanges at the airport were closed and I didn't really see anywhere else to do it whilst I was there. Much easier to have cash on hand.\n\nWe went last year, had pre-arranged transfers so no cash needed there, then just withdrew cash in resort (or could have done cash back at the hotel reception IIRC).\n\nCan't remember the last time I exchanged cash ahead of a trip anywhere now.\n\nWe didn't bring currency when we went to Mauritius, used bank cards to take out cash when we got there. I haven't changed currency before going anywhere in about 10 years.\n\nI also can't remember the last time I took foreign currency with me abroad. I just use my vmcredir card and get cash out of the ATM with my debit card.\n\nThanks everyone. Do you exchange pounds to local currency at the exchange bureaus in the airport or just plug in UK debit card at an atm and withdraw local currency?\n\nThere is a currency exchange desk in the airport lobby where you exit after customs. Use your bank card there, the exchange rates are good.\n\nWe changed ours at the airport as at the time the rate was the same all over Maritius.\n\nHo ho ho\n\nThe number of times I've seen people caught short - eg on arrival in Egypt (cash required for visa on arrival) Senegal (ATMs taking Visa card only and with only a few taking Mastercard; and don't even get me started on the dearth of working ATMs in Munich and the 'cash is king' approach for shops and services.\n\nYes, I would get the bulk of my cash via ATM in my destination but would a,ways take some cash with me"
