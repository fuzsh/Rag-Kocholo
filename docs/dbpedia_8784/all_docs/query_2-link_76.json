In 1971, the Royal Mint released a new set of coins and banknotes with the likeness of Queen Elizabeth II. Since 1987, the monarchy has not appeared on any currency printed subsequently. Mauritius became a republic in 1992, thus ending the relationship with the Commonwealth. The most commonly used bills for Mauritian rupees are the 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 notes and 1 Rupee is divided into 100 cents."
