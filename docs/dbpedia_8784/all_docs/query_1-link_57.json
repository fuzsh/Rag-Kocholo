You can also use ATMs and local exchange services in Mauritius for additional rupees.\n\nWhat is the best currency to take to Mauritius?\n\nThe ideal currency for Mauritius is the Mauritian rupee (MUR), the official currency. It’s widely accepted for everyday expenses like shopping, dining, and transport.\n\nEuros (EUR) and US dollars (USD) are also accepted, especially for exchange into Mauritian rupees. Carry some EUR or USD if you’re visiting popular tourist spots.\n\nNevertheless, having Mauritian rupees for smaller transactions is crucial.\n\nCan I use UK debit or credit cards in Mauritius?\n\nMajor credit and debit cards work in most urban and tourist areas. However, be aware that\n\ncard acceptance might be limited in remote areas. Carrying cash is advisable.\n\nATMs allow withdrawals in Mauritian rupees, but check for any fees.\n\nInform your bank about your travel plans to avoid any account issues.\n\nIs it better to have cash or card in Mauritius?\n\nBoth are useful. Cash, especially in Mauritian rupees, is recommended for everyday transactions. Credit cards are handy in cities and tourist areas.\n\nHow much cash should I take to Mauritius?\n\nYour budget depends on your travel style and duration.

Over £100 daily is enough for upscale hotels, fine dining, and excursions.\n\nAlways have enough cash for areas with limited ATM or card services.\n\nHow to minimise ATM fees in Mauritius\n\nUse ATMs of major banks for lower fees and withdraw larger amounts less frequently. Check if your home bank has partner banks in Mauritius for potentially lower fees.\n\nShould you tip in Mauritius?\n\nTipping is less standard but appreciated. In restaurants, 5-10% is common. For tour guides and drivers, 5-10% of the tour cost is usual. Hotels and porters appreciate modest tips.\n\nIn remote areas, consider small gifts instead of cash.\n\nIs Mauritius affordable?\n\nMauritius can be budget-friendly. Costs vary with travel style, but options suit various budgets.\n\nA cafe coffee in Port Louis might cost around 50 MUR (£1). A three-course meal in a mid-range restaurant could be about 1,500 MUR (£30).\n\nMauritian rupee currency\n\nMauritian rupee banknotes\n\nMauritian banknotes are a fascinating blend of vibrant colours and intricate designs.
