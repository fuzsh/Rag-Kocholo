        "text": "Money & Currencies in Mauritius\n\nWhen travelling nothing puts your mind more at ease than knowing you are in control of your money and that it’s safe but, keeping your money secure in the bank is one thing and really understanding the buying power of that money in whichever country is another thing entirely.\n\nThere is probably nothing more important than take the necessary precautions and educating yourself on what your hard earned money can buy for you when on vacation. Especially knowing the difference between what everything should reasonably cost and knowing when you might be being ripped off on taxi fares, gifts, trinkets, food, alcohol etc.\n\nPlease take the necessary time to acquaint yourself with the local money and currency customs of whichever country you’re in before you arrive. In our Mauritius.co.za – Travel Guide we aim to provide as much valuable information to help you get over the hurdle of getting to grips with the buying power of the The Mauritian Rupee in Mauritius.\n\nSymbol: Rs\n\nCentral bank: Mauritian Reserve Bank\n\nSubunit: Rupee\n\nBanknotes: Rs10, Rs25, Rs50, Rs100, Rs200, R500, Rs1000, Rs2000\n\nCoins: 1,5,20,50 cent coins and 1,5,10,20 Rupee Coins/li>\n\nISO code: MUR\n\nWhich currencies are accepted in Mauritius?\n\nThe Mauritian Rupee is the currency of Mauritius. The The Mauritian Rupee is subdivided into 100 cents. The monetary unit is the Mauritian Rupee (Rs.) which is divided into 100 cents (cs). It is advisable to travel with Mauritian Rupee, Euros or US Dollars. ZAR can be exchanged at Mauritius Airport where one will receive a more favourable rate of exchange than at the hotels.\n\nCurrently circulating banknotes\n\nEach denomination bears a hand engraved portrait of a prominent Mauritian figure, which appears on the left.\n\nDenomination Portrait Vignette\n\n25 rupees Moilin Jean Ah-Chuen Rodrigues\n\n50 rupees Joseph Maurice Paturau Le Caudan\n\n100 rupees Renganaden Seeneevassen Court House\n\n200 rupees Sir Abdool Razack Mohamed Mauritian Market\n\n500 rupees Sookdeo Bissoondoyal University of Mauritius\n\n1000 rupees Sir Charles Gaëtan Duval State House\n\n2000 rupees Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Bull & Sugarcane Cart\n\nThere is also a drawing of the Bank of Mauritius building and a portrayal of the statue of justice on each of the denominations.
