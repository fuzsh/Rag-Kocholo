Change in MUR rate from previous day is -0.04%.\n\nIn case you are looking to get the best Mauritius Rupee rates in your area, try BookMyForex. You can buy as well sell MUR at the best exchange rates with BookMyForex which provides foreign exchange at live and transparent rates. Since the currency exchange market is highly volatile, Mauritius Rupee rates keep on changing throughout the day. You can check live Mauritius Rupee rates online at BookMyForex.com and place an order to buy or sell Mauritius Rupee online at the live rates.\n\nWe at BookMyForex through our several banking tie-ups are able to consistently offer the best Mauritius Rupee Exchange Rates throughout India. We've invested significantly in our infrastructure to ensure that you receive rates that are live and accurate to the last second. The rates visible here aren't the base rates that are shown on most sites. These are rates at which you actually buy or sell MUR or send a MUR international remittance at these rates. You can even freeze the live Mauritius Rupee rates on our site at any moment. Moreover, the rate alert feature on our site allows you to get notified via email when the rates touch the level that you want.\n\nMoney changers have always used a static rate for MUR exchange purposes. This rate is sometimes termed today's MUR rate or MUR rate today. There, however, exists no such thing such as a Mauritius Rupee Exchange Rate Today. Mauritius Rupee rates, just like the rate of any other financial security vary every second. Money changers necessarily need to protect themselves from currency fluctuations that occur in the live market and in order to do that they create a large margin on these so called today's MUR rates. With our strong technology infrastructure and our excellent tie ups, we're able to provide our customers with perfectly live and transparent exchange rates.\n\nWe'd like to think we're helping bust the Mauritius Rupee Exchange Rate Today myth and revolutionizing the foreign exchange markets in India by transparently exposing live MUR rates to the masses. BookMyForex hosts a full suite of forex products and you can buy or sell MUR forex cards, MUR traveler's cheques and MUR currency notes. In addition you can also make international remittances using MUR swift transfers and MUR Demand Drafts."
