        "text": "Are you planning a trip to Mauritius but you’re uncertain about the daily costs? We’ve compiled some facts about costs and money in Mauritius. Stay one step ahead when preparing your holiday to this gorgeous island paradise.\n\nWhat currency should I take with me?\n\nStressed about getting your hands on some rupees? Don’t be. You can take South African and US currency with you and exchange it on arrival. There are many Bureau De Changes and they offer similar rates.\n\nWe highly recommend getting smaller notes as haggling is an integral part of the market culture in Mauritius. It’s likely that you will find yourself in a situation in which you will have to barter. Plus, it’s really fun!\n\nHow much money should I convert?\n\nIt’s well-advised to avoid converting too many cash rupees as it’ll cost you much more to convert them back. Finding a good exchange rate is challenging and the fees are considerably larger than those charged for exchanging to the local currency.\n\nThe bulk of your spending using Mauritian rupees will be at the local markets, vendors, taxi rides and perhaps, a few handicrafts at the bazaar.\n\nCredit Cards\n\nMost stores, hotels, bars, and restaurants accept payments via credit card, specifically Visa and Maestro. Amex is quickly becoming more available as well. Watch out for an extra fee of 3% recorded as a ‘bank charge’. Ask in advance about any extra fees charged.\n\nDaily Costs\n\nIdeally, you would be doing a bit of a balancing act with your holiday budget. Let’s review some of the costs of visiting Mauritius:\n\nPRODUCT\n\nMauritian Rupee US Dollar South African Rand Cocktail 320 MUR $8.69 R129.99 Still water (1l) 35 MUR $0.95 R14.22 Can of Coke 60 MUR $1.63 R24.37 Meal at mid-range restaurant 450 MUR $12.23 R182.80 Milk (1l) 43 MUR $1.17 R17.47 Beer (bottle) 28 MUR $0.76 R11.37 Wine 300 MUR $8.15 R121.87 Fast food meal 200 MUR $5.43 R81.24 Cappuccino 89 MUR $2.42 R36.15 Espresso 69 MUR $1.87 R28.03 Cigarettes 182 MUR $4.94 R73.93\n\nThese prices are general estimates and your travel consultant will be able to provide more detailed feedback on what to expect cost-wise.\n\nHoneymoon discounts\n\nPlanning your honeymoon? Newly-weds can look forward to honeymoon discounts but make sure to bring along a copy of your marriage certificate as hotels may ask to see it.\n\nTipping\n\nMauritian travel etiquette results in employees paying close attention to your needs to earn a good tip. It’s advisable to wait until the end of your stay to tip hotel staff members apart from the porters, assisting with your luggage upon arrival.\n\nAt restaurants, it’s customary to tip between 10-15%\n\nAt a spa, guests are expected to tip 5-10% unless the service fee is included\n\nTour guides are usually tipped 10% (and the driver 5%) of the cost of the tour\n\nA helpful taxi driver would expect 100-200 rupees\n\n100 rupees is the standard for attentive hotel staff"
