        "text": "The rupee (plural Rupees) is the official currency of Mauritius and is divided into 100 Cents.\n\nHistory of the rupee in Mauritius\n\nThe rupee was established as a currency in Mauritius in 1876. The government of Mauritius chose the rupee mainly because the country had an influx of Indian rupees very large as a cause of immigration from India to Mauritius and, as a result, the Rupiah indicates circulated for some time in the country.\n\nThe rupee of Mauritius began its circulation in 1877 and replaced the Indian rupee, the pound sterling and the Mauritian dollar. This replacement was made at an exchange rate of 1 rupee of Mauritius = half a dollar of Mauritius and 1: 1 with the Indian rupee. The pound sterling had a value of 10.25 rupees at that time.\n\nThe Mauritian rupee also circulated in the Seychelles until 1914 when it was replaced at the same time by the Rupee of Seychelles.\n\nNotes and coins of the Mauritian rupee in use\n\nIn Mauritius circulate bills of 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 rupees.\n\nAs for the coins, they circulate of 5, 10, 20 and 50 cents, and of 1, 5 and 10 rupees."
