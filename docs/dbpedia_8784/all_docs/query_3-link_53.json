        "text": "Travel Advice\n\nMauritius is a year-round destination. Temperatures during the warm, dry months, between April and October, are usually in the mid-20s (degrees Celsius), rising to the upper 20s in the summer months between November and March.\n\nCurrency\n\nYou will be required to declare all types of foreign currency when entering/exiting Mauritius and therefore we advise that you only change money as required. Most international airports have banks where money can be changed and facilities are usually available at reputable hotels and lodges.\n\nSafety\n\nMauritius is a very secure destination. As with travel in all foreign countries, it is advised that you keep an eye on your personal belongings. The main tourist attractions in Mauritius are its islands and here there is virtually no crime.\n\nPhotography\n\nMost types of film material are readily available in all major centres and holiday resorts. Please be sensitive when photographing people. The scenery in Mauritius makes for excellent photography.\n\nPassport & Visa Requirements\n\nGuests visiting Mauritius must be in possession of a passport that is valid for at least six months from the date of travel and should have two blank pages available in their passport. Visitors who intend travelling to neighbouring countries and back are advised to apply for multiple entry visas."
