        "text": "Mauritius Currency - All You Need To Know About Currency In Mauritius\n\n₹ 26,575 onwards View Packages\n\nTop Hotel Collections\n\nResorts\n\nBest Hotels\n\n5-Star Hotels\n\nVillas\n\nView All Hotels In Mauritius\n\nThe currency of Mauritius is the Mauritian Rupee, with one Rupee divided into 100 cents. The currency code is MUR and the symbol used is 'Rs.' Although Mauritius is an African country, its currency uses the Rupee, which is commonly seen in several Asian countries, including India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Indonesia. At present, the currency circulates in the country in a total of thirteen face values, i.e., seven in the form of paper notes and the remaining six in coin form.\n\nThe currency of Mauritius originated from the Indian Rupee. There was an influx of Indian rupees into the island that occurred after the immigration of Indian workers to work in sugar plantations. The Mauritian Rupee came into existence as the official currency in 1876 and has been in circulation in the country since 1877, replacing the Indian Rupee, the Mauritian Dollar, and the British Pound Sterling.\n\nMauritius Currency Notes\n\nSymbol: Rs\n\nUnique to Mauritius alone, this currency consists of banknotes as well as coins. Currency notes of MUR 25, MUR 50, MUR 100, MUR 200, MUR 500, MUR 1,000 and MUR 2,000 are widely accepted and circulated, although the MUR 2000 note can be pretty rare. The currency notes vary in size and colour.\n\nEach of the notes has an image of the Bank of Mauritius building and a statue of justice on one side. They also feature portrait pictures of various historically significant people of Mauritius on this side. The reverse side depicts different aspects of Mauritius and the value of the notes written in Indian languages such as Hindi and Tamil. For example, the MUR 200 note features a portrait image of Abdool Razack Mohamed, an influential Mauritian minister, and the Mauritian Market on the reverse side. This pattern can be seen in all the notes, with each of them having different pictures.\n\nMauritius Currency Coins\n\nThe currency of Mauritius uses coins for its smaller denominations, and mainly includes the MUR 1, MUR 5, MUR 10 and MUR 20 coins. The 5, 20 and 50 (or ½ Rupee) cents coins also exist, but these are hardly circulated anymore. All the coins have a portrait image of Seewoosagur Ramgoolam or the 'Father of the Nation,' with symbolic representations on the reverse side. For example, the MUR 5 coin features an image of a sea and palm trees on its reverse side, while the MUR 10 coin shows a labourer cutting sugarcane in the field.\n\nATMs and Credit Card Facilities in Mauritius\n\nAll major debit and credit cards are widely used and accepted in Mauritius, such as Visa, MasterCard, and American Express. However, it is always best to ensure that your card will be accepted in Mauritius by your bank. It is good to use a credit card for large purchases instead of cash.\n\nMany ATMs are located within convenient reaches, such as the State Bank of Mauritius (SBM) ATM and the Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB) ATM. These can be found in the main town areas, outside banks and inside supermarkets, malls, and the airport. One can withdraw money from one of these accessible ATMs using an international debit card. However, some banks may charge an extra fee to process cash withdrawals from ATMs overseas.\n\nSince the introduction of more convenient options like credit cards and ATMs, the use of traveller's cheques has reduced drastically, and they are slowly being phased out.\n\nPlaces to Exchanging Currency in Mauritius\n\nCurrency Exchange Counters: There are plenty of exchange bureaus located at the Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport in Mauritius at the arrival and departure areas, where you can exchange their currency for the local currency.\n\nATMs: You can also withdraw money or exchange foreign currency at one of the available ATMs (Automated Teller Machine) available at the airport, including Barclays Bank, HSBC, and Mauritius Commercial Bank.\n\nExchange Bureaus: If you wish to exchange money outside the airport, there are some branches of exchange bureaus all over the island, such as Thomas Cook and Shibani Finance. All major currencies are accepted here.\n\nBanks: At banks such as Barclays Bank, Mauritius Commercial Bank and State Bank of Mauritius, you can get money using foreign currency, traveller's cheques, bank debit cards and credit cards.\n\nCan I Pay using Foreign Currency in Mauritius?\n\nMost places in Mauritius do not accept foreign currency, and Mauritians prefer being paid in the local currency. However, even if some currencies like USD or EUR are accepted by a few significant establishments such as hotels, the exchange rate will not be very favourable, and you will lose some amount of money in the process. Also, the change will be paid to you in Mauritian rupees rather than in the currency of your choice.\n\nIs Indian Rupee accepted in Mauritius?\n\nNo, however, you can exchange it at a reasonable rate.\n\nHow Much Mauritian Rupees Should I Carry?\n\nThe amount you wish to carry with you would vary from budget to budget. It also depends on the duration of the trip, the accommodation, a preferred mode of transportation and the activities you choose to do during your vacation. While some people may prefer to spend little on shopping and food and spend more on activities like water sports, others may choose to spend their holiday in luxury while staying in a 5-star hotel, dining in gourmet restaurants and shopping for hours. Thus, the amount you would need is subjective.\n\nThe major expenses for your holiday include accommodation, travel, activities, and food. Since the hotel and flights are covered, you must budget for activities, food, and travel within the country. To give you an idea of the various basic expenses you would incur, here is a list of several essential items and their costs in Mauritius:\n\nMeal (at an inexpensive restaurant): MUR 150-300\n\nA bottle of water: MUR 15-40 (However, tap water is safe for drinking.)\n\nA bottle of beer: MUR 50-150\n\nMilk (1 litre): MUR 35-60\n\nA loaf of white bread (500 grams): MUR 10-35\n\nTaxi (for 1 kilometre): MUR 60-100\n\nGasoline (1 litre): MUR 40-52\n\nCurrency Exchange in Mauritius: Tips and Tricks\n\nIt is recommended to exchange your money in Mauritius on arrival, rather than in your home country to avail of lower exchange rates.\n\nTry to visit a local private money exchange bureau such as Shibani Finance or Thomas Cook, as these will offer you better rates than banks or hotels.\n\nKeep in mind a budget for your trip, and how much you wish to exchange into the local currency, so you can do so at one go and thus, avail a better rate. (The more significant the amount, the better the price!)\n\nConverting the Mauritian currency back to your local currency will be a loss for you. So, if you are unsure of how much money you will require, it is best to convert the currency bit by bit. There are plenty of accessible exchange bureaus in Mauritius, should you run out of the local currency at some point.\n\nDue to some regulations, make sure to check with your bank if your credit card will be accepted in Mauritius and whether they charge a fee to process cash withdrawals overseas.\n\nBe sure to have your passport with you, as a valid passport is required for almost any money transaction, including withdrawal, transfer, and exchange.\n\nFacts About the Currency of Mauritius\n\nThe Mauritian Rupee is one of the only three rupee-denominated currencies globally that use the Cent as a subunit since the cent is commonly a subunit of dollar currencies. The other two currencies are the Sri Lankan rupee and the Seychellois rupee.\n\nThe currency was used in Seychelles until 1914, after which the official currency of Mauritius is the Rupee.\n\nWith fast-growing financial, industrial and tourism sectors, Mauritius is considered by most as one of the rapidly developing nations in the world. The beauty and charm of the island make it a paradise for tourists from all over the world and a popular honeymoon destination. With the tips, tricks and information listed above on the Mauritius currency and budgetary factors, you can enjoy your vacation hassle-free!
