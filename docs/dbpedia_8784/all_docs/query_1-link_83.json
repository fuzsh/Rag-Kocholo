        "text": "MUR – Mauritius or Mauritian Rupee\n\nMonetary System\n\n1 Mauritian rupee (MUR) = 100 cents\n\n2013 – 2021 Issues\n\nOn 22 August 2013, the Bank of Mauritius issued new 25-, 50-, and 500-rupee banknotes on polymer. The 25- and 50-rupee notes were printed by Oberthur Technologies on Innovia Security’s Guardian substrate, whereas the 500-rupee note was printed on De La Rue’s Safeguard substrate (formerly called Flexycoin). The new polymer notes will circulate in parallel with the preceding paper banknotes upon which their designs are based. The notes contain numerous new security features such as transparent windows showing the image of the dodo, numbers printed with magnetic ink which become fluorescent under ultra violet light, and swing features printed in iridescent ink, which change to a different color when observed in transparency or when tilted.\n\nDescription: 25.00 MUR – Mauritius Rupee Size: 135 x 65 mm\n\nViolet and brown.

Polymer (Safeguard).\n\n2010 – 2017 Issues\n\nThese notes are like the preceding issues, but with improved security features. The 200- and 500-rupee banknotes now have a multi-image holographic patch at upper right front. On the 200-rupee note, the patch is of a dodo and the denomination. On the 500-rupee note, the patch is of a deer and the denomination. On the 1,000-rupee note, there’s a depth image hologram of the Bank of Mauritius Tower with a key and the denomination in the background.\n\nDescription: 200.00 MUR – Mauritius Rupee Size: 150 x 72 mm\n\nGreen.

Watermark: Dodo bird head. Printer: (De La Rue). 160 x 76 mm. Paper.\n\n1999 – 2017 Issues\n\nThese notes restored the traditional order of the text on front as English/Tamil/Hindi. Furthermore the designs were modified slightly to incorporate a screen trap pattern in areas that had been white. The 100-rupee note changed colors noticeably. The portrait on the 1,000-rupee note is much more flattering, and the Château of Réduit (official residence of the president) replaced the sega (Mauritian folkloric) dancers on the back because some people were offended by the stereotype of Creoles as dancers. Finally, silver foil ovals were added to the front of the 500- and 1,000-rupee notes. All denominations 100 rupees and larger have a wide iridescent stripe on back on all dates.\n\nDescription: 25.00 MUR – Mauritius Rupee Size: 135 x 65 mm\n\nViolet and brown.
