        "text": "1)What is the best way to travel to Mauritius?\n\nThe quickest way to travel to Mauritius is by booking a flight from India to Mauritius. The shortest flight would be a direct one from Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi to the Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport in Port Louis (the capital city of Mauritius). The flight duration is around 6-7 hours on average. You can also catch flights from Bangalore, Chennai and Mumbai.\n\n2)Can I travel to Mauritius by sea?\n\nIf you’d like to take the long, leisurely and luxurious route to Mauritius, then a cruise is ideal. You can start your trip at the Chennai or Mumbai port. The trip from Mumbai is around 13 days, while the trip from Chennai is 12 days long. If you’re already in a close location – say Madagascar – a short boat ride should get you to Mauritius.\n\n3)What is the time difference between India and Mauritius?\n\nIndia is one hour and thirty minutes ahead of Mauritius.\n\n4)Is Mauritius a safe destination?\n\nMauritius is considered to be a safe destination for Indian travellers; however, caution is always a good policy. The risk of muggings, scams and pickpocketing are low. However, make sure drivers don’t overcharge you for any trip you take. In terms of natural disasters, November to May is cyclone season on the island, so check the weather before you book your tickets.\n\n5)What are a few popular places in Mauritius?\n\nMauritius is a treasure trove of natural wonders – Trou Aux Biches, Belle Mare Plage, Ile Aux Cerfs, Pereybere, La Cambuse are all beautiful beaches and allow you to relax or participate in some water adventure sports. You can also take a hike along the seven shaded sands of Chamarel – which is breathtaking. Black River Gorges Park, in south west Mauritius, is a perfect place to hike, relax and camp. Other than these beautiful attractions, you also have the Tamarind Falls, Parc Francois Leguat Wildlife Park, the Botanical Gardens, Eureka House, Sugar Museum and more.\n\n6)What are the liquor laws in Mauritius?\n\nIn Mauritius, it is illegal to serve, sell or supply alcohol to anyone who is under 18 years of age.\n\n7)What is the currency of Mauritius?\n\nThe Mauritian Rupee is the official currency of the Republic of Mauritius. Furthermore, US dollars are accepted in Mauritius as well, so you can stock up on those too. Although credit cards are widely accepted everywhere, it’s a good idea to carry a prepaid forex card from Thomas Cook as they are safe, secure and reloadable if you run out of money.\n\n8)Will I get Wi-Fi connectivity? Can I buy a local sim card in Mauritius?\n\nWi-Fi is available in 350 public spots, across the island, including Community centres, Women centres, Youth centres, Social welfare centres, Post Offices and Village councils. This is an initiative by the Ministry of Technology, Communication and Innovation. Anyone with a valid mobile number and a Wi-Fi enabled device can access this internet for free. There are three operators in Mauritius, from whom you can buy a prepaid sim – Emtel, Orange and Chilli. If you are visiting the Rodrigues Islands or Agalega, Orange has the best connectivity. Your hotel will provide Wi-Fi, and you can also look at cafes for Wi-Fi.\n\n9)What is the food like in Mauritius? Can I get Indian food? What about vegetarian options?\n\nMauritian food is a mixed pot of flavours and is heavily influenced by the diverse residents who live on the island. You will find a lot of Indian food, as well as Chinese, Creole and French cuisines. For Indian food, look at popular restaurants like Le Tandoor, Namaste Restaurant, Delhi Taj Restaurant and La Chaumiere Masala. Vegetarian food is served aplenty in Mauritius, and you can visit restaurants like Lambic, Chez Tino, La Faya to enjoy their vegetarian selections.\n\n10)Are there any laws to know in Mauritius?\n\nKeep the driving laws in mind, if you are renting a car to drive in the island. Driving in Mauritius is on the left. Obey the speeding laws and do make sure you follow the safety signs posted on the beach.\n\n11)What are the transport options available in Mauritius?\n\nIn Mauritius you have the option of using the well-connected public bus system (be sure to check the timings before you make your plans for the day). If you would like to travel with a bit more convenience, a public tax is an excellent (though slightly more expensive) way to travel around the island. Hotels also allow you to rent out bikes, scooters and cars. The Mauritian railway is perfect for long distances and connects you to other cities and towns in Mauritius. You can also hire a helicopter for an aerial tour or a boat to explore the islands."
