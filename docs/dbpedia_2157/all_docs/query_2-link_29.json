Ferdinand-Philippe, duke of Orleans. Portrait of King Louis Philip of Orleans son. Neoclassicism\n\nMary Evans Picture Library makes available wonderful images created for people to enjoy over the centuries\n\nMedia ID 8267391\n\n© Mary Evans Picture Library 2015 - https://copyrighthub.org/s0/hub1/creation/maryevans/MaryEvansPictureID/10211683\n\n1780 1867 Auguste Dominique Ingres Neo Classicism Orleans Philip Philippe Aisa\n\nEDITORS COMMENTS\n\nThis striking portrait of Ferdinand-Philippe, Duke of Orleans, was painted by the renowned French artist Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres in 1867. The Duke, who was the son of King Louis-Philippe I of France, is depicted in the image in the neoclassical style, reflecting the artistic trends of the time. Born in 1780, Ferdinand-Philippe was the eldest surviving son of King Louis-Philippe and his wife, Maria Amalia of the Two Sicilies. He was educated in the military and served in the Napoleonic Wars before becoming the Duke of Orleans in 1830, following the abdication of his father and the establishment of the July Monarchy. The Duke of Orleans was known for his support of the liberal and constitutional causes, and he played an important role in the political and social life of France during the mid-19th century. He was a patron of the arts and sciences, and he established the Société des Gens de Lettres, a literary society that supported French writers and intellectuals. In this portrait, Ingres captures the Duke's regal presence and intellectual sophistication. The Duke is depicted in a formal sitting position, dressed in the robes of a duke, with a serious expression on his face. The artist's masterful use of light and shadow creates a sense of depth and texture, bringing the Duke's features to life. The neoclassical style of the portrait reflects the artistic trends of the time, which were influenced by the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. The clean lines, geometric shapes, and idealized forms of neoclassical art were a departure from the more romantic and emotional styles of the previous century. This portrait of Ferdinand-Philippe, Duke of Orleans, is a testament to Ingres's artistic skill and the Duke's important role in French history. It is a valuable addition to any collection of French art or historical portraits.\n\nRate this comment thumb_up thumb_down\n\nMADE IN AUSTRALIA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
