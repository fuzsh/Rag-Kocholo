        "text": "Advertisement\n\n10. King Philippe, Belgium\n\nNet worth: $14 million\n\nFew records are found on King Philippe's net worth, but in 2013, the monarchy claimed to be worth roughly $14 million.\n\nBelgium's Civil List covers all expenditures directly incurred by King Philippe, set at roughly $13,801,830 annually in 2013, and additional support services are also financed by the government.\n\nBelgian Royal properties are owned either by the State or by The Royal Trust, a financially independent and autonomous public institution. The Trust properties can never be sold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. King Felipe VI, Spain\n\nNet worth: $20 million\n\nThe King of Spain reportedly cut his salary by 20% to $267,447 in 2015, according to CNBC.\n\nThe royal family has eight royal palaces, five royal county residences, and ten monasteries and convents. In 2015, their royal lifestyle cost Spain $8.9 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. King Harald V, Norway\n\nNet worth: $30 million\n\nKing Harald V doesn't pay taxes on his wealth and has spent some of said wealth purchasing a royal yacht.\n\nThe Norwegian monarchy reportedly costs the state $72 million a year. In 2017, the Norwegian government allocated roughly $32,214,394 to the royal house and $14,88,900 to the King and Queen for personal expenses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n7. Queen Margrethe II, Denmark\n\nNet worth: $40 million\n\nQueen Margrethe II has reigned over Denmark since 1972.\n\nThe Danish Civil List grants the royal family $12.8 million a year, which covers the Queen's activities, royal household's operations, and private expenses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6. King Carl XVI Gustaf, Sweden\n\nNet worth: $70 million\n\nKing Carl XVI Gustaf received $7.6 million in funds for official duties in 2015, and the Palace Administration received nearly $7.4 million from the state the same year.\n\nThe royal family's net worth includes private ownership of Solliden Palace, a summer home in the Baltics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. Queen Beatrix, Netherlands\n\nNet worth: $200 million\n\nQueen Beatrix may have abdicated the throne in 2013, but that doesn't prevent her from remaining the most prominent figure in Dutch royalty.\n\nThe current King of Netherlands, King Willem-Alexander, was allocated a budget of $47 million, which covers official visits and overseas tours. He also has a personal fortune consisting of real estate, investments, and a stake in Shell Oil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. Queen Elizabeth II, England\n\nNet worth: $530 to $600 million\n\nThe British royal family's net worth is made up of property, art, and investments.\n\nMuch of the net worth comes from The Crown Estate, which includes Buckingham Palace and the crown jewels. While this belongs to the British state and not the Queen, she does own her residences at Balmoral Castle and Sandringham Palace.\n\nQueen Elizabeth has an estimated private wealth of $530 million as of 2016, according to Forbes.\n\nFrom 2016-2017, the Sovereign Grant, calculated as a percentage of Crown Estate profits, was roughly $57,931,768. The Queen received around $20,167,835 generated from property rental sources.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Prince Albert II, Monaco\n\nNet worth: $1 billion\n\nPrince Albert II of Monaco reportedly owns about a fourth of the land he reigns over; the Philadelphia-area home of his mother, Grace Kelly, which he purchased in 2016 for an estimated $754,000; an antique car collection; shares in the Monte Carlo resort Societe des Bains de Mer; and a pricey stamp collection, all of which contribute to the House of Grimaldi's net worth.\n\nMonaco spent $52,788,294 on the royals in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Prince Hans Adam II, Liechtenstein\n\nNet worth: $3.5 billion\n\nPrince Hans Adam II of Liechtenstein receives an untaxed token expense allowance of $270,709 in lieu of a salary.\n\nThe expense allowance may seem to be a small sum compared to other royals, but the Princely House of Liechtenstein is reportedly worth $3.5 billion in large part due to its privately owned bank, LGT Group, and investments made through the Prince of Liechtenstein Foundation, which oversees real estate, forest, and winery assets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Grand Duke Henri, Luxembourg\n\nNet worth: $4 billion\n\nThe Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg doesn't receive a salary, but has been granted around $324,851 every year since 1948 to carry out functions.\n\nThe 2017 budget also allows for $12,181,914 for the Grand Duke's household cost. The ownership, administration, control, and income of the private fortune of the Grand Duke's House belong exclusively to the holder of the crown.\n\nThe family reportedly has a $4 billion fortune.\n\nRead next\n\nRoyals Royal Family Queen Elizabeth II\n\nMore...\n\nAdvertisement"
