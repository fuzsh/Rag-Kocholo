        "text": "Among the gifts received in celebration of the Metropolitan Museum’s 150th anniversary is an impressive pair of gilt-bronze candelabra (fig. 1). Executed for Ferdinand Philippe, duc d’Orléans (1810–42) and prince royal, eldest son of French King Louis Philippe (1733–1850), they belonged to a famous surtout de table, or ornamental centerpiece for a formal dining table (fig. 2).‍[1] Commissioned by the duke in 1834, the monumental table decoration took five years to complete and was delivered to his apartment in the Pavillon de Marsan at the Tuileries Palace in Paris on April 20, 1839.‍[2]\n\nFerdinand Philippe died in a carriage accident three years later, on July 13, 1842 (fig. 3). In 1853, his widow, the former Duchesse Hélène of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1814–58), sold the centerpiece at auction, together with many other artworks from her late husband’s collection.‍[3] The centerpiece was divided into multiple lots and the sculptural groups created by Antoine-Louis Barye (1795–1875), as well as their supports, candelabra, decorative tazze (dishes on a stem), and the plateau for the surtout, all designed by Claude-Aimé Chenavard (1797–1838), were widely dispersed.\n\nCommanding high prices at the auction, Barye’s hunting compositions and animal combats, all now in public collections, have received their share of attention over the years;‍[4] by contrast, the decorative elements of the surtout sold for much less than their initial cost and have been long forgotten.‍[5] Yet, I intend to demonstrate that the candelabra, tazze, bases of the sculptures, and plateau were essential contributions to the splendor of the table decoration. Indeed, not only did these elements identify the patron by referencing the duke’s interests, but they also contributed to the complexity of the surtout, which is richly varied in its choice of materials, eclectic in style, and global in its iconography. The exquisite craftsmanship displayed in its creation and the large sums lavished on the centerpiece (a total of 433,925 francs) show that Ferdinand Philippe was a keen supporter of the decorative arts, a fact that is frequently overshadowed by his better-known patronage of the fine arts, especially painting.‍[6] Furthermore, by selecting the influential Chenavard as the designer of the surtout, the heir to the throne showed a commitment to improving industrial design in France.\n\nThe recent gift of the two candelabra to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York offers a wonderful opportunity to reexamine this extraordinary centerpiece, which was arguably the duke’s most important commission. I intend to reconstruct the surtout as a true collaborative effort and discuss it as a high point of Ferdinand Philippe’s art collection.\n\nFerdinand Philippe as Patron\n\nHandsome and well educated, the popular Ferdinand Philippe enjoyed a brilliant military career and was known for his diplomatic acumen. But his foremost legacy is as a discerning patron of the arts. As a child, he and his younger siblings received lessons from the Dutch-born Romantic painter Ary Scheffer with whom the duke developed a lifelong friendship.‍[7] Fond of music (especially of opera) and literature, Ferdinand Philippe built an important library with many beautifully illustrated books as well as a wide-ranging art collection, annually spending large sums on acquisitions.‍[8] Above all, he took a keen interest in contemporary art, visiting the Paris Salons beginning in 1831, when he purchased Eugène Delacroix’s Assassinat de l’évêque de Liège (Murder of the Bishop of Liège; Musée du Louvre, Paris) for 2,000 francs.‍[9] He subsequently bought or ordered works by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps, Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier, Delacroix, Scheffer, and other living painters.‍[10]\n\nAlthough less numerous than his purchases of paintings, the duke also acquired sculptures, commissioning portraits cast in bronze of family members and of his favorite horses.‍[11] The heir to the throne clearly appreciated the work of Antoine-Louis Barye and early on was one of his principal patrons. Starting in 1833, he bought more sculptures (and watercolors) from Barye than from any other sculptor, including the numerous animal groups for his celebrated surtout de table.‍[12]\n\nIn addition to contemporary paintings, the duke purchased medieval and Renaissance objets d’art, including Palissy ware and Urbino majolica. He decorated his apartment in the Tuileries Palace with furniture from the holdings of the Garde Meuble (furniture repository) made by celebrated cabinetmakers of the ancien régime, such as André-Charles Boulle, Jean-François Oeben, and Jean-Henri Riesener.‍[13] But he also took an interest in contemporary decorative arts. Ferdinand Philippe visited the Expositions des Produits de l’Industrie (Exhibition of industrial products) multiple times, demonstrating his support of French industrial arts, and added contemporary decorative arts to his collections.‍[14] In 1839, for instance, he commissioned a unique bookstand in the Renaissance style, now also in the Metropolitan Museum’s collection (fig. 4). Its design attributed to the architect Charles-Auguste Questel, the piece was executed in the workshop of Georges-Alphonse Jacob-Desmalter and was likely intended for the display of a book of hours that had been specially created for the duke as well.‍[15]\n\nBut by far his most important commission in the field of decorative arts was the monumental surtout de table, which took a small army of artists and artisans five years to complete. By ordering an elaborate centerpiece, the duke clearly distinguished himself as an important patron of the decorative arts. In doing so, he followed established royal traditions since table decorations were commissioned in court circles in the late seventeenth century.‍[16] Generally made of silver or silver gilt, most of these surtouts were eventually melted down, but several are known from contemporary accounts. In July 1749, for instance, the duc de Luynes recorded in his memoirs that Louis XV went to see a centerpiece created for Clemens August, Elector of Cologne, by the silversmith Jacques-Nicolas Roettiers.‍[17] Other celebrated table decorations were made by François-Thomas Germain, which included one for Joseph I, King of Portugal, in 1764.‍[18] By the late eighteenth century, precious metal was substituted by porcelain, often in combination with gilt bronze. A particularly grandiose Sèvres surtout de table, designed as a part of the so-called Service de l’Empereur (Emperor’s service), was ordered by Napoléon Bonaparte in 1807. Used three years later for the emperor’s wedding to Marie-Louise at the Tuileries Palace, this table decoration conveyed imperial ambition.‍[19] The biscuit porcelain figures of the surtout were based on antique sculptures taken as war bounty during Napoléon’s successful military campaigns.‍[20]\n\nThe Commission of the Surtout de table\n\nThe commission of the surtout de table was a newsworthy event. The weekly journal L’Artiste first mentioned Ferdinand Philippe’s table decoration in 1834. It reported that “the duke of Orléans just ordered from Messrs. Chenavard and Barye a very important work: a centerpiece of goldsmith work, the subject and manner of execution of which are left entirely up to the taste of the two artists.”‍[21] According to this article, which provides a rare description of the surtout, the table decoration was to measure twenty-one pieds long (ca. 268.53 in.) by five wide (ca. 63.9 in.) and consist of fifteen figure and animal groups cast in gold and silver using the lost-wax technique.‍[22] The additional elements of the centerpiece, such as the supports for the sculptural groups, the candelabra, and the various tazze, would be embellished with designs decorated with niello in the Florentine manner and enriched with inlays of the most brightly colored stones.‍[23] A mosaic of malachite, lapis lazuli, and precious marbles was to decorate the plateau of the surtout. This description reflects the creative ideas of the artists at an early stage.\n\nPreparatory models were submitted to Ferdinand Philippe for approval, which may have led to changes in the centerpiece’s design and execution.‍[24] The Revue des Arts (Arts review) of the same year anticipated that the duke’s commission would compare favorably to masterpieces of Florentine goldsmith work.‍[25] Exhibited at the Paris Exposition de l’Industrie (Exposition of Industry) of 1844, the main components of the surtout were described in glowing terms: “the most beautiful work of this kind that has been executed in modern times. . . . It is impossible to see a composition more animated and better rendered . . . We do not believe that the Florentines and the Ancients themselves have ever produced anything more beautiful.”‍[26]\n\nThe accounts of the duc d’Orléans record the involvement of many designers, modelers, sculptors, and artists, including James Pradier, Jean-Jacques Feuchère, Antonin-Marie Moine, Eugène-Louis Lami, and Jean-Baptiste-Jules Klagmann.‍[27] In addition, there were bronze casters, gilders, stonecutters, and cabinetmakers participating in the manufacture of the surtout, as well as joiners who were in charge of assembling the various parts.‍[28] Many of their names are unfamiliar to us today, but the main participants are well known: Chenavard was responsible for the surtout’s overall design and Barye provided the principal bronze groups.‍[29]\n\nClaude-Aimé Chenavard\n\nThe son of a manufacturer of wall hangings, carpets, and furniture for clients of diverse socioeconomic classes, Chenavard was active as a designer and interior decorator.‍[30] Intent on improving the industrial arts, he published Nouveau recueil de décorations intérieurs (New collection of interior decoration) (1833–35) with forty-two plates illustrating tapestries, furniture, bronzes, vases, and other furnishings, followed in 1835 by Album de l’ornameniste (Ornamentalist album).‍[31] The Album, which included seventy-two engravings, was advertised as illustrating “fragments d’ornements dans tous les genres et dans tous les styles” (fragments of ornament in all genres and in all styles). By chance, a copy of Chenavard’s earlier Recueil des dessins de tapis, tapisseries et autres objets d’ameublement (Collection of designs for carpets, tapestries and other furnishings; 1827), formerly in the library of the duc d’Orléans, is now in the Metropolitan Museum’s collection.‍[32]\n\nChenavard provided models for the Beauvais and Gobelins manufactories, and, from 1830 on, also for the Sèvres porcelain factory.‍[33] Although the plates show a wide range of historic influences, Chenavard is primarily credited with having stimulated the revival of the Renaissance style in France.‍[34] For instance, he supplied designs for vases in the Renaissance style to Alexandre Brongniart, director of the Sèvres manufactory, that were shown at the Salon of 1831. The following year, the so-called “Vase de la Renaissance” (Renaissance vase), executed in hard-paste porcelain, was included in the exhibition of Royal Manufacturers in Paris. Its novel aesthetic sparked interest and excitement and was hailed as a substitute for the prevalent but tired neoclassical style.‍[35]\n\nIn 1836, the artist supplied the drawing for a standing cup that became known as the coupe Chenavard (Chenavard cup; fig. 5).‍[36] Executed in different color combinations, both the cup’s form and ornamentation have a stylistic affinity to French sixteenth-century metalwork and pottery. But while the interlaced decoration in low relief is reminiscent of Saint Porchaire ceramics, composed of different inlaid pastes, the brilliant tones are typical of the nineteenth century.‍[37]\n\nFrequently featured in L’Artiste, Chenavard enjoyed a prominent status during his lifetime.‍[38] The design for Ferdinand Philippe’s surtout de table was among the artist’s most important commissions, for which he was paid 114,000 francs over a five-year period. Upon completion, the artist would have received a further sum of 30,000 francs.‍[39] Sadly, he died before the work was finished.\n\nLouis-Antoine Barye\n\nA prominent sculptor of the Romantic era, Barye specialized in animal sculptures, which were known for their energy and lifelike realism, the result of his close observation of live specimens in the menagerie of the Jardin des Plantes (botanical garden) in Paris, as well as the study of skeletons at the nearby Galerie de Paléontologie et d’Anatomie comparée (The Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy).‍[40] At the Salon of 1831, the artist showed a few animal studies, as well as the plaster group Tiger Devouring a Gavial, securing him a reputation as an animalier (sculptor of animals).‍[41] Following a successful exhibition of his work at the Salon of 1833, Barye was named a chevalier in the order of the Légion d’Honneur and began to attract royal patronage.‍[42]\n\nThe Surtout\n\nFerdinand Philippe’s surtout was centered on nine sculptural groups by Barye, including five spectacular large hunts and four smaller violent animal combats, which, due to their “jeweler’s intricacy,” are considered to be among the best work the sculptor produced.‍[43] The majority of these bronzes were cast in the lost-wax technique by the Parisian founder Honoré Gonon.‍[44] This process allowed for great refinement and exquisite detailing of the surfaces, which were patinated in the “Florentine style” and subsequently gilded.‍[45] Since the wax models and the molds were destroyed during the casting process, the bronze groups of the surtout are unique, as noted by the 1842 inventory drawn up after the death of Ferdinand Philippe.‍[46]\n\nBarye’s sculptural groups were placed on elaborate supports. The animal sculptures of the centerpiece are all in public collections and well published. By contrast, their bases, the candelabra, decorative tazze, and the plateau, all designed by Chenavard, were until ten years ago only known from inventory descriptions and a few sketches (fig. 6).‍[47] During the past decade, several of these pieces have come on the art market, making it possible to gain a better idea of the overall aspect and iconography of the surtout.\n\nA reconstruction, seen in figure 6, tentatively maps the location of the supports, Barye’s sculptures surmounting them, as well as the other elements of the table decoration. In the center was a sizable square base that supported the largest sculpture, the Tiger Hunt, placed on an arch-like pedestal elevating it high above the table (fig. 7). The whereabouts of the pedestal is unknown, but a preliminary sketch is in the Musée du Louvre, Paris.‍[48] Fortunately, the duke’s inventory and account descriptions provide further information. These sources allude to the fact that the pedestal included camels loaded with Levantine merchandise with their driver standing nearby.‍[49] Barye’s smaller groups depicting fierce animal combats, unprecedented as far as table decoration is concerned, enriched the corners of the stepped support on which the arch rested (fig. 8).‍[50] Chrysoprase, a pale-green gemstone further embellished with gilt-bronze mounts, was used to decorate the stepped base.‍[51]\n\nFour additional hunting scenes by Barye were placed on either side of this large central grouping: the Lion Hunt and Wild Bull Hunt stood on low rectangular bases, while the Elk Hunt and Bear Hunt were supported by high, round, temple-like pedestals (fig. 9).‍[52] According to the inventory, the latter incorporated an arcade, from which six horsemen appeared.‍[53] Sold separately at the time of the 1853 auction, their whereabouts are still unknown, except for one of the low rectangular supports, which appeared on the art market in 2015 (fig. 10). Showing the monogram of Ferdinand Philippe on all four sides, it is made from a variety of materials and is eclectic in design and enigmatic in iconography.‍[54] Its architectural shape is embellished with Renaissance ornament, including round-arched niches, jeweled vases, hard-stone columns, garlands of vine leaves and grapes, and damascened panels of Boulle-like decoration (fig. 10). Groups of children frolic on the stand’s long sides, while a lion, boar, bear, and tiger guard its corners.\n\nTo alternate with Barye’s four hunting groups, there were six standing dishes, or tazze, executed in gilded and silvered bronze and mounted with “jewels” of precious stones.‍[55] A pair of these tazze was sold on the art market in 2011 (fig. 11).‍[56] The bowl of one of them, overflowing with dead fowl, is surmounted by an owl, while a catch of fish and crustaceans, surmounted by a pelican, fills the other.‍[57] In contrast with vessels of earlier centerpieces, which were intended to hold flowers, fruits, or delicacies, these were purely decorative. Their stems are embellished with pieces of chrysoprase and mounted with faceted amethysts and ruby carnelians. Different tones of gilding further enrich these works. Hunters described as Native Americans and fishermen from the “North” populate the feet of these two cups, which also include Ferdinand Philippe’s monogram on their bases.‍[58] Two additional tazze, laden with game, are still missing, as are two others filled with fruits.‍[59] According to contemporary descriptions, Chinese gardeners, Norman peasants, hunters from the South Seas, an African in combat with a lion, an African fisherwoman, a Neapolitan fisherman, and an Egyptian and a crocodile were all included in the design.‍[60]\n\nThe choice of these figures, executed by different sculptors, including Pradier and Feuchère, and the use of gemstones mined in different parts of the world lent the surtout a global character, further emphasized by Barye’s bronze groups featuring people from India in the Tiger Hunt, Tartars in the Elk Hunt, and Arabs in the Lion Hunt.‍[61] Other figures, such as the horsemen in the Wild Bull Hunt and the mounted hunter in the Bear Hunt are dressed in sixteenth-century-style European armor. Since Barye did not travel outside Europe, the inspiration for some of these subjects derived from miniatures and from illustrated books in the duc d’Orléans’s library.‍[62] Made available to the sculptor, they included volumes on history, travel, and hunting, indicative of the patron’s personal interests, which were thus echoed and integrated in the surtout as well.\n\nThe Candelabra\n\nDecorative but also practical, fourteen eight-light candelabra illuminated the duke’s table. According to the ducal accounts, four small génies, or putti, embellished the base of each one, while a seated female musician was placed on top. Until two pairs of candelabra appeared on the art market in the past few years—one of which was donated to the Metropolitan Museum—their appearance remained unknown (figs. 1, 12–16).‍[63] As luck would have it, the design for the light-bearing component of the surtout, a beautifully finished drawing by Chenavard, was already in the Metropolitan Museum’s collection (fig. 17).‍[64] Although the differences between the rendering and the executed candelabra are obvious, certain motifs remained the same. Among these are the music-making female crest figure in historic dress, the snake coiling around the stem, and the recurrent use of colorful “jewels.” The putti on the foot are now seen frontally and each has an instrument, possibly a direct reference to the duke’s love of music.\n\nWhile a certain Mr. Combettes was responsible for “la plus grande partie des ornements” (the largest part of the ornaments), the sculptor Jean-Jacques Feuchère (1807–52) was credited with modeling the figures of the candelabra.‍[65] The son of the ciseleur, or chaser, Jacques-François, Jean-Jacques Feuchère created both small decorative works, as well as public monuments.‍[66] At the Salon of 1831, he submitted a relief representing an angel playing a musical instrument, which received a favorable response from the critics.‍[67] The artist returned to the subject in his drawing Virgin and Child Adored by a Lute-Playing Angel. The depiction of an elongated figure in an elegant mannerist style is reminiscent of the lute-playing female crowning one of the Metropolitan Museum’s candelabra (figs. 12, 18).\n\nThe Iconography\n\nHunting has long been an aristocratic and privileged pastime that not only connotes prestige but also asserts power, martial prowess, and bravery.‍[68] Representations of the hunt signal dominion of man over nature, of human intellect over animal instinct, and of life over death. Hunting is also about food and, for that reason, a hunting theme was not uncommon for a surtout de table used in the dining room, where nature’s bounty is to be enjoyed. Barye’s hunting and animal groups certainly epitomize all these connotations while the tazze further emphasize the reference to meals by including fish, fowl, and fruit in their decoration.\n\nThe presence of animals not native to Europe, fishers and hunters from different continents, and the use of precious and semiprecious stones from all over the world, moreover, give the table centerpiece a global and encyclopedic character, the latter echoed in the stylistic eclecticism of the piece, which encompasses elements from classical antiquity, the Renaissance, and the baroque periods.\n\nThe surtout appears to have exemplified the broad interests and capabilities of its patron. Although better known as a military man than as a hunter, the animal scenes must have reflected Ferdinand Philippe’s interest in the sport, which had been practiced by many of his ancestors. The hunt demanded good judgment and quick decisions; the same acumen were required on the battle field. The global character of the surtout marked him as a man of the world who had traveled both in Europe and the Islamic world, while its broad-based nature reflected his collecting activity, ranging from medieval objects to contemporary art. The presence of his monogram on four sides of the only known support of the surtout and on the base of the two rediscovered tazze (fig. 11) suggests that it must have been ubiquitous throughout the table decoration, clearly linking the centerpiece to its patron.\n\nThe 1853 Sale of Ferdinand Philippe’s Art Collection and the Provenance of the Candelabra\n\nAt the 1853 sale, the surtout was divided into multiple lots. Even the candelabra were not sold together but offered as lots comprising either one or two pairs. The catalogue descriptions make it clear that there were different designs, with and without pendeloques, or pendants.‍[69] Chenavard’s drawing includes tassel-shaped pendants attached to the candle branches with bejeweled swags suspended in between. While the thin metal chains connecting the arms are still present, a close inspection of the Metropolitan Museum’s pair shows a tiny metal loop underneath the candle branches, indicating that there once existed hanging elements. It thus is reasonable to identify the museum’s candelabra as part of lot 113: “Two candelabra with pendants and precious stones, two stones missing, estimated together with two other similar ones.”‍[70] The catalogue for the sale informs us that these candelabra stood at the four corners of the surtout’s plateau, or tray (fig. 6). Although described as a mosaic in the L’Artiste in 1834, this plateau, the whereabouts of which is currently unknown, was executed in black wood, probably ebony, and inlaid with copper ornament reminiscent of Boulle work, according to the auction catalogue.‍[71]\n\nWell-known collectors, such as Count Anatoly Nikolaievich Demidoff and Richard Seymour Conway, fourth Marquess of Hertford, dealers, and museum directors battled for the late duke’s artworks, which commanded steep prices at the auction.‍[72] Valued at 2,900 francs, the lot comprising the Metropolitan Museum’s candelabra was acquired by a certain “Gambard,” a major buyer who purchased other pieces from the surtout as well.‍[73] This buyer was most certainly Ernest Gambart, a publisher of fine art prints who became a leading picture dealer in London.‍[74] Born in Courtrai, Belgium, Gambart established the French Gallery in 1854, one of the first commercial galleries in London located at 120/121 Pall Mall, where he arranged exhibitions for the sale of contemporary art.‍[75] While not documented, it is likely that Gambart acquired the candelabra and other components of the surtout to show and trade at his gallery.\n\nAt an unknown date, the candelabra came into the possession of Sir James Watts (1804–78), a successful textile merchant who served from 1855 to 1857 as mayor of Manchester. He may have purchased the pair for his estate, Abney Hall in Cheadle, Cheshire, which was remodeled during the 1850s in the gothic revival style after designs by the architect Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin. During the Manchester Great Art Exhibition of 1857, Watts hosted Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli and Prince Albert, consort of Queen Victoria, who referred to Abney Hall as “one of the most princely mansions in the neighborhood.”‍[76] By descent, the candelabra came in the possession of Watts’s granddaughter, Lady Eleanor Campbell-Orde (1908–96). They were at one point at Kilmory Castle, a large nineteenth-century manor house in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, the estate of the Campbell-Orde baronets until 1938.‍[77]\n\nFerdinand Philippe’s Dining Room at the Tuileries Palace\n\nGiven Ferdinand Philippe’s death several years after the completion of the surtout, it is not likely that this lavish centerpiece was used frequently. The only contemporary description mentioning the table decoration is by François d’Orléans, Prince de Joinville, younger brother of Ferdinand Philippe, who recalled in his memoirs a magnificent costumed ball of 1842. Foreign diplomats and members of the aristocracy in national or historic dress were present as were many artists: Delacroix in Moroccan, Hornace Vernet in Arab, and Franz Xaver Winterhalter in sixteenth-century Florentine costume. Listening to Algerian music, the guests were seated at an enormous table “in front of the famous table center executed after the designs of Chenavard, by Barye . . . Admirable work, [a] masterpiece worthy of Benvenuto Cellini.”‍[78]\n\nThe larger elements of the surtout were displayed primarily in the dining room on the marble tops of three buffets, or sideboards, while the remaining pieces were stored on shelves inside.‍[79] Designed by Questel and supplied by the royal cabinetmaker Louis-Alexandre Bellangé, these pieces of furniture, just like the dining table, must have been extremely well constructed in order to carry the enormous collective weight of the bronzes (one of the candelabra alone weighs over fifty-six pounds).‍[80] According to the duke’s inventory, they were made of mahogany, carved with figures, and mounted with gilt bronze.‍[81] Crimson damask hangings lined the walls forming the background for a selection of contemporary paintings from the duke’s collection, including works by Ingres, Delacroix, and Scheffer.\n\nFour hunting scenes by Louis-Godefroy Jadin in richly carved and gilded frames served as Supraportes above the doors. In addition, Alexandre Bellangé, cousin of Louis-Alexandre Bellangé, supplied four Boulle-work cabinets and Renaissance-style dining chairs for the room after designs by Questel.‍[82] Made of gilt wood and upholstered in crimson brocatelle, the seats’ covers were fitted with fringe and gilded nails. The dominant color in the room was a deep red, which, combined with the dark mahogany of the sideboards, surely brought elegant contrast to the gilded and patinated surfaces of the surtout and harmonized with the “jewels” on its tazze, candelabra, and supports.\n\nFerdinand Philippe’s taste was certainly eclectic; he acquired medieval and Renaissance objects and furnished his apartment with furniture from the ancien régime. In his support of young artists, the duke favored modern art, spending generously on works by living painters. However, his visits to and purchases made at the Expositions des Produits de l’Industrie indicated a clear support of the French industrial arts. This is also borne out by the commission of the magnificent surtout on which he lavished more funds than on any other artwork. Two years after Ferdinand Philippe’s death, components of the table decoration were shown to great acclaim at the exposition of 1844, honoring the duke as an important patron of the decorative arts, a fact that is largely forgotten today."
