        "text": "Rather than allocate an apartment at the Grand Trianon with the rest of the family, Louis-Philippe gave the nearby Petit Trianon to the Duke of Orleans, his eldest son and heir to the throne.\n\nThe Duchess of Orleans occupied the same bedroom as Marie-Louise, Napoleon’s second wife. Her bed was replaced with a larger, simpler one because like his father, the Duke of Orleans slept with his wife. Marie-Louise’ chairs were retained but recovered in the deeper blue fabric to match the bed.\n\nAt the Petit Trianon, the Queen’s bedroom and boudoir are displayed as they were in the time of Marie-Antoinette. The furniture during the time of Marie-Louise and the Duchess of Orleans is exhibited in the attic.\n\nThe boudoir furniture of the Duchess of Orleans (right) can also be seen there.\n\nThe young Duke of Orleans was an enthusiastic collector of antique furniture and objets d’art.\n\nWhen he furnished his apartments in the various royal residences he was able to select from a wide range of different styles in the royal Garde-Meuble (storage facility). He also searched markets for furniture and art from various periods, mixing it with contemporary styles. Like his father, installing bathrooms and flushing toilets in his apartments was essential.\n\nHis marriage to Hélène de Mecklembourg-Schwerin had taken place at the Chateau of Fontainebleau.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess’ apartment were located In the former rooms of Anne of Austria. The bedroom was part of the 11 room apartment which had formerly been used by Pope Pius VII, both on his way to Napoleon’s coronation and then as a gilded cage during his 18 months of captivity following Napoleon’ excommunication."
