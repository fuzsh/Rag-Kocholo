According to Giscard, the count described an aborted plan to run for the presidency in the early 1960s. Giscard said the count had approached then-President Gen. Charles de Gaulle, asking to be appointed president of the French Red Cross--which he said would be the ideal platform from which to promote his royalist views. If elected, the count would have proposed a constitutional reform to set up a monarchy similar to Britain's, Giscard wrote. De Gaulle didn't try to talk the count out of his plan, but said he could not give him the post, Giscard wrote. The count then abandoned the project.\n\nHBRC\n\nNavigate the Boys' Historical Clothing Web Site royal pages:\n\n[Return to the Main French Bourbon pages]\n\n[Return to the Main Orleans page]\n\n[Return to the Main royal pages]\n\n[Austria] [Belgium] [Denmark] [France] [Germany] [Italy] [Luxenburg]\n\n[Monaco] [Netherlands] [Norway] [Romania] [Russia] [Spain] [United Kingdom]\n\nCreated: February 24, 2003\n\nLast updated: 10:45 PM 7/26/2008"
