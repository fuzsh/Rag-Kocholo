Taken around 1830 by Francois-Seraphin Delpech, this lithograph captures the essence of a young prince destined for greatness. Ferdinand Philippe was born in exile on the island of Sicily, but his birthright as heir to the House of Orleans was never forgotten. When his father ascended to the throne as King Louis Philippe I of France in 1830, Ferdinand Philippe became the Crown Prince at just twenty years old. In this portrait, he exudes confidence and poise with a direct gaze towards the camera. Dressed impeccably in royal attire complete with an elegant collar and epaulettes adorning his shoulders, Ferdinand Philippe embodies both power and grace. The intricate details captured by Delpech's skilled hand bring out every nuance of this historical figure's personality. The lithograph technique adds depth to the image while preserving its timeless quality. As we admire this remarkable piece from Heritage Images, we are transported back to a pivotal moment in French history when monarchy met revolution. Ferdinand Philippe stands as a symbol of hope for a nation seeking stability under new leadership. Whether you appreciate artistry or have an interest in European history, this print is sure to captivate your imagination and spark curiosity about one man's journey from exile to becoming Prince Royal of France.\n\nRate this comment thumb_up thumb_down\n\nMADE IN AUSTRALIA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
