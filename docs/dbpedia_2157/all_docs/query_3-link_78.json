        "text": "We know that the British royal family has a laundry list of castles and properties to their name, from Buckingham to Windsor, but what about their Spanish counterparts? Turns out, the properties owned by the Spanish royal family stunningly amount to...zero. Yep. In fact, King Felipe VI is considered one of Europe’s “poorest” monarchs, worth just over $2.4 million. In comparison, last year the British monarchy was reportedly worth about $461 million. So, what about all these royal properties in Spain? They’re actually managed by the Patrimonio Nacional, aka the National Heritage, as the Spanish crown surrendered the properties to the government. Though the government manages the estates, the monarch still has the right to use the properties. The portfolio consists of royal palaces, country residences and monasteries founded by the crown, plus 51,000 acres of forest and 1,455 acres of historical gardens. So, here are 18 properties owned by the Spanish royal family (at least, historically), from the imposing royal palace in Madrid to an island getaway on Majorca."
