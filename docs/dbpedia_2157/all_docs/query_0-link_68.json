        "text": "Embed from Getty Images.\n\nLouis-Napoléon Bonaparte, Napoléon III, Emperor of the French, the last monarch of France, reigned 1852 – 1870\n\nThere were monarchies in France, with several interruptions, from the establishment of the Kingdom of the Franks in 486 until the fall of the Second French Empire in 1870. Descendants of Hugh Capet (reigned 987 – 996), founder of the House of Capet, were the first rulers to adopt the title of King of France, with Philippe II (reigned 1180 – 1223), the first French monarch to do so.\n\nThe Capetian line was succeeded by cadet branches, the House of Valois and then the House Bourbon, which ruled without interruption until the French Revolution abolished the monarchy in 1792. Napoléon Bonaparte made himself Napoléon I, Emperor of the French and reigned 1804 – 1815. Napoléon I’s four-year-old son by his second wife was Napoléon II, Emperor of the French for sixteen days. Ultimately, the Bourbons were restored in the aftermath of Napoléon I’s defeat and final exile and reigned from 1815 – 1830. The House of Orléans, descendants of King Louis XIV’s brother Philippe I, Duke of Orléans, reigned from 1830 – 1848 with Louis Philippe I, as King of the French. In 1848, the Second Republic was declared, once again ending the monarchy in France.\n\nCharles-Louis Napoléon Bonaparte (typically known as Louis-Napoléon), the son of Louis Bonaparte, (younger brother of Emperor Napoléon I) and Hortense de Beauharnais (the daughter of Emperor Napoléon’s first wife, Joséphine de Beauharnais and her first husband) became Prince-President of the Second Republic. He was able to have the French Senate declare him Emperor. In 1852, the Second Republic ended and the Second French Empire was declared. Louis-Napoléon took the throne as Napoléon III, Emperor of the French. In 1870, after France’s defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, the Third Republic was declared, ending, for the last time, the French monarchy.\n\nBelow is an indexed listing with links to articles and information about the French Royal Family at Unofficial Royalty.
