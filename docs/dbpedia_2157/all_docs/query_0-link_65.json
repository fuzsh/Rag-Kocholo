        "text": "The Peerage\n\nGeneall\n\nJohann The Younger # 1801 + # 2053\n\nWikipedia\n\nPhilippe d'Orléans Count of Paris, Louis Philippe Albert , Philippe VII King of the Frence (in exile), Prince Royal, Captain Philippe d'Orléans, Louis-Philippe II\n\nPhilippe d'Orléans was the grandson of Louis Philippe I, King of the French. He was a claimant to the French throne from 1848 until his death.\n\nBorn: 24 August 1838\n\nDied: 8 September 1894, Stowe House, Stowe, Buckinghamshire, England\n\nFather: Ferdinand Philippe d'Orléans Ferdinand Philippe, duc d'Orleans\n\nMother: Helene of Mecklenburg-Schwerin Duchess Helen of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\nSpouse: Princess Marie Isabelle d'Orléans María Isabel Francisca de Asís Antonia Luisa Fernanda Cristina Amelia Felipa Adelaida Josefa Elena Enriqueta Carolina Justina Rufina Gasparina Melchora Baltasara Matea d'Orléans y de Bourbon, infante d'Espagne et comtesse de Paris\n\nWhen Prince Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orléans, died in a carriage accedent 13 July 1842, his eldest son, Philippe became Prince Royal, heir-apparent to the throne of the King of the French. His grandfether Louis Philippe I, King of the French abdicated in 1848 and there was a minor effort to place Phillippe on the throne, under the name of Louis-Philippe II, with his mother, Helene of Mecklenburg-Schwerin as regent. This was not successful, and Phillippe and his mother, fled, and the French Second Republic was proclaimed.\n\nPhillippe volunteered to serve as a Union Army officer in the American Civil War along with his younger brother, the Duke of Chartres. As Captain Philippe d'Orléans, the Count of Paris served on the staff of the commander of the Army of the Potomac under Major General George McClellan for nearly a year. He distinguished himself during the unsuccessful Peninsular Campaign. Phillippe was an historian, journalist and outspoken democrat. His history of the American Civil War is considered a standard reference work.\n\nIn 1864 he married his paternal first cousin Princess Marie Isabelle d'Orléans (1848–1919), Infanta of Spain. She was daughter of Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain and Prince Antoine, Duke of Montpensier (1824–1890), the youngest son of Louis-Philippe of France and Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily.\n\nIn 1873, anticipating a restoration of the monarchy by the largely monarchist National Assembly that had been elected following the fall of Napoleon III, the Count of Paris withdrew his claims to the French throne in favour of the legitimist claimant, Henri V, best known as the Comte de Chambord. It was assumed by most that the Count of Paris was Chambord's heir, and would thus be able to succeed to the throne upon the childless Chambord's death, reuniting the two claims that had divided French monarchists since 1830. However, Chambord's refusal to recognize the tricolor as the French flag sabotaged hopes of a restoration, and Chambord died in 1883 without ever specifically recognizing his Orléanist rival as his heir. Upon the Count of Chambord's death, the Count of Paris was recognized by most monarchists as Philippe VII of France. This succession was disputed by the Carlist descendants of the Bourbon kings of Spain, who argued that being descended directly from Louis XIV their claim was greater than that of the Orléanists'; however, this argument pointedly ignored Philip V of Spain's renunciation of his and his descendants' claim to the French throne pursuant to the Treaty of Utrecht. The Count of Paris lived in Sheen House, Sheen in Surrey, England, where his grandfather had sought refuge after his abdication.\n\nPhillippe and his wife had eight children:\n\nAmélie d'Orléans, Princess of Orléans (1865–1951). She married Carlos I of Portugal in 1886.\n\nPrince Louis Philippe Robert d'Orléans, Prince of Orléans, Duke of Orléans (1869–1926). Married Archduchess Maria Dorothea of Austria daughter of Archduke Joseph Karl of Austria in 1896,\n\nHélène d'Orléans, Princess of Orléans (1871–1951). She married Emmanuel Philibert, 2nd Duke of Aosta in 1895.\n\nCharles d'Orléans, Prince of Orléans (1875–1875).\n\nIsabelle d'Orléans, Princess of Orléans (1878–1961). She married Prince Jean D'Orléans, Duke of Guise in 1899.\n\nJacques d'Orléans, Prince of Orléans (1880–1881).\n\nLouise d'Orléans, Princess of Orléans (1882–1958). She married Prince Carlos of Bourbon-Two Sicilies in 1907. Through her daughter Maria Mercedes of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, she was the grandmother of King Juan Carlos I of Spain.\n\nFerdinand d'Orléans, Prince of Orléans, Duke of Montpensier (1884–1924). He married Marie Isabelle Gonzales de Olañeta et Ibaretta, Marchioness of Valdeterrazo in 1921.\n\nTitles in pretence\n\nTitular King of the French\n\n(26 August 1850 – 8 September 1894)\n\nPreceded by Louis-Philippe I\n\nLouis Philippe I d'Orléans, roi des Français\n\nSucceeded by Philippe VIII\n\nPhilippe d'Orléans, duc d'Orléans\n\nTitular King of France and Navarre\n\n(24 August 1883 – 8 September 1894)\n\nPreceded by Henri V\n\nHenri d'Artois, duc de Bordeaux, comte de Chambord\n\nSucceeded by Philippe VIII\n\nPhilippe d'Orléans, duc d'Orléans\n\nHeir apparent of the Throne of the King of the French\n\n(13 July 1842 – 24 February 1848)\n\nPreceded by Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orléans\n\nFerdinand Philippe, duc d'Orleans\n\nSucceeded by Robert, Duke of Chartres\n\nRobert Philippe d’Orléans, duc de Chartres"
