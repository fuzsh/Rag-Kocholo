Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orléans (1810-1842)

By Henri de Triqueti (1804 – 1874)

Marble, circa. 1843 - 1844

Prince Ferdinand-Philippe of Orléans was Prince Royal of France. Born Ferdinand Philippe Louis Charles Henri Joseph of Orléans in Palermo, Italy, he was the eldest son of the future king Louis-Philippe of France and Princess Marie Amalie of Bourbon-Sicilies.

Returning from Plombières, where he was going to his wife, the Duke was about to leave for Saint-Omer to review part of the army on operations on the Marne, of which he had been made the commander, when he went to Neuilly-sur-Seine on 13 July 1842 to say goodbye to his family. The horses of his carriage ran off out of control at Sablonville in the Hauts-de-Seine département, he jumped from the carriage and broke his head on the pavement - a few hours later he died, aged only 32. Alfred de Musset evoked the accident in his poem Le Treize Juillet (in the collection Poésies nouvelles). His funeral service was held in Notre Dame and, when there was not enough black textile to cover the church, the architect Visconti had the idea of using black paper. He was interred in an elaborate tomb in the Chapelle Royale, in Dreux, Eure-et-Loir.
