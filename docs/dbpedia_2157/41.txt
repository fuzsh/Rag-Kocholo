Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orléans, born on September 3, 1810, was a prominent member of the French royal family during the 19th century. As the son of Louis-Philippe I, who held the title of King of the French during the July Monarchy, Ferdinand Philippe played an active role in the political landscape of his time. He married Duchess Helene of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and the couple had four sons, including Philippe, Count of Paris, who would become a key figure in the family's later claim to the French throne. Tragically, Ferdinand Philippe's life was cut short when he met his demise in a carriage accident on July 13, 1842, in the gardens of the Palais Royal in Paris. His death had significant repercussions for the Orléans family, impacting their political influence and dynastic aspirations in France. Approximate Vignette Image Size: 5 ins x 4 ins .
