FORMER NFL linebacker Clark Haggans has died aged just 46.

The Super Bowl XL champion was picked by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the fifth round of the 2000 NFL Draft.

Haggans spent seven seasons with the Steelers, famously sacking Seattle’s Matt Hasselbeck on the opening drive of the 2005 Super Bowl on the way to victory.

During his stellar Steelers career, Haggans recorded 332 tackles, 12 forced fumbles, and 32.5 sacks.

He began his pro football journey as a defensive end at Colorado State University.

Haggans' 33 sacks for the Rams remain a school record, and he was inducted into the CSU Hall of Fame in 2015.

The 6ft4 star spent 13 total seasons in the league, playing for the Arizona Cardinals and the San Francisco 49ers after leaving Pittsburgh.

He retired in 2013 and would go on to become a prominent supporter of the Black Out Child Abuse Campaign charity.

NFL fans paid tribute to Clark on social media after his death was announced on Tuesday.

One wrote: "Clark was loved. He will be missed dearly by all of us that knew him. Most of all he loved his kids beyond measure. RIP Clark."

Another said: "Thanks for the memories, Clark."

And a third added: "My all-time favorite football Ram. This play below was the first game of my freshman year at CSU at the old Mile High Stadium. I’ll never forget this play. Thanks for the memories!"

Haggans' cause of death has not yet been revealed, per Colin Dunlap of 93.7 The Fan.
