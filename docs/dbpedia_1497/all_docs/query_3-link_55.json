        "text": "Numbers stick in the memory.\n\nFaces of football players are obscured by helmets, so fans tend to vividly remember the numbers worn by their favorite star players.\n\nWhen a number is mentioned, who in CSU football history comes to mind? For some, it’s easy. For other numbers, it’s quite the debate. In this daily series leading up to the start of fall camp in late July, I pick some of the most notable numbers in Colorado State University football history and decide who wore it best. Criteria is how the player performed at CSU and his overall impact on the program.\n\nWho wore it best: Colorado State University football team No. 12\n\nNo. 96: Clark Haggans\n\nThe defensive end was one of the key pieces of the excellent CSU teams of the late 1990s. Haggans, who played at CSU from 1996-99, was a two-time all-conference selection. His 33 career sacks is still a school record. He holds two of CSU’s top single-season sack marks with 12 in 1997 and 10 in 1998.\n\nAfter his college career, Haggans was selected in the fifth round of the 2000 NFL draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He played eight seasons with the Steelers, recording a sack in Super Bowl XL as Pittsburgh beat Seattle. Haggans played 172 career games in the NFL and recorded 46.5 sacks.\n\nHaggans was inducted into the CSU athletics Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nOther notable No. 96’s\n\nAndre Sommersell — Linebacker from 2000-03 was “Mr. Irrelevant” as the final pick in the 2004 NFL draft by the Oakland Raiders.\n\nStan Hornung — Defensive lineman from 1982-83 was all-conference in 1983. Father of former CSU basketball player and current CSU basketball director of player development Pierce Hornung.\n\nSteve Norton — Defensive lineman from 1990-93 was all-conference in 1993.\n\nWho wears it now?\n\nRedshirt senior kicker Wyatt Bryan.\n\nWho wore it best?\n\nThis is the second installment of a daily series of the best players, by jersey number, in Colorado State University football history.\n\nSunday: No. 12, Gary Glick\n\nToday: No. 96, Clark Haggans\n\nFollow sports reporter Kevin Lytle at twitter.com/Kevin_Lytle and at facebook.com/KevinSLytle."
