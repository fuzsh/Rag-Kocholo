        "text": "FORT COLLIINS — SONNY Lubick isn’t a camera buff. In fact, the Colorado State University coach rarely looks into the camera when being interviewed.\n\nThat’s not to say Lubick minds being on television.\n\nHe’s a bit miffed the Rams’ Mountain West Conference title game against leader Texas Christian University Saturday at 5 p.m. from Fort Worth, Texas, won’t be televised.\n\n“I know there are a lot of (television) contracts out there, so there’s not much we can do,” Lubick said, voicing his displeasure that CSU fans won’t be able to watch the game on television.\n\nThe Rams are the only team with a legitimate shot at beating TCU for the conference title with just one loss. TCU is 6-0 in MWC action, and poses a lot of problems for CSU’s defense.\n\n“You can expect a ton of offense from them,” Lubick said.\n\nA CSU victory would put the Rams atop the conference at 5-1 with just two MWC games to play — a home game on Nov. 12 against San Diego State and the season finale at UNLV on Nov. 19.\n\nThe Rams will no doubt need to call on their defense against TCU, but provide some offensive numbers to think about:\n\nn Senior quarterback Justin Holland has thrown for 2,281 yards in just eight games, the most amount of yards in the fewest games in school history.\n\nn Holland needs just one touchdown pass to reach 21 for the season, which would be a school mark, surpassing the old mark held by Moses Moreno and Matt Newton.\n\nn The Rams have scored 34 points via turnovers in the past two games.\n\nn Sophomore tailback Kyle Bell has gone over 100 yards in four games this season, and has carried the ball 30 or more times in four games. His 107.2 rushing yards per gamed is second in the MWC and 20th nationally.\n\nn The Rams defense forced four second-half turnovers last week at New Mexico State, converting them to 17 points. The Rams have generated nine turnovers in the last two weeks, and their plus-9 on the season makes them 28th nationally.\n\nn CSU punter Jimmie Kaylor has a 45.6-yard average, which ranks him fifth in the nation, and may be the best defensive weapon the Rams have this week, hoping to run any field position the Horned Frogs can come up with.\n\nn One more victory would make the Rams bowl eligible, marking the 11th time in Lubick’s 13 seasons as the head coach\n\nIs that enough to make the Rams television worthy? I think so.\n\n* IN THE PROS: Ten former CSU football players are on active National Football League rosters, led by Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Joey Porter. Also playing on Sunday afternoons are Jason Craft, linebacker New Orleans Saints; Joel Dressen, wide receiver New York Jets; Clark Haggans, defensive lineman Pittsburgh Steelers; John Howell, defense Seattle Seahawks; Blain Saipaia, offensive lineman St. Louis Rams; Cecil Sapp, running back Denver Broncos; Bradley Van Pelt, quarterback Denver Broncos; Brady Smith, defensive tackle, Atlanta Falcons; Dexter Wynn, special teams Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nHaggans and Porter are teammates with former University of Northern Colorado standout defensive lineman Aaron Smith, and Wynn is teammates with former UNC punter Dirk Johnson, now punting for the Eagles.\n\n* MEN’S BASKETBALL: The Rams will play an exhibition game at home Monday night at 7 against Regis University.\n\nThe Rams have eight new faces on the roster, but are led by sophomore Jason Smith, a former standout from Platte Valley High School.\n\nSmith was the MWC Freshman of the Year last season, averaging 10.5 points and 5.8 rebounds.\n\nCSU will travel to UNC to face the Bears in a 7 p.m. game Nov. 18, and will have faced Regis and CSU-Pueblo in exhibition games before traveling to Butler-Hancock Sports Pavilion.\n\nThe Rams have lost 20 straight road games.\n\nSamuel G.
