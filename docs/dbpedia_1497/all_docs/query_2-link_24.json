        "text": "A solid linebacker who made more than one appearance in the Super Bowl, the Steelers star was a credit to the game where ever he went. Indeed, he will be missed by both those who played with him and those who knew him as a person.\n\nClark Haggans passes away\n\nAccording to a statement from the Pittsburgh Steelers, former NFL linebacker Clark Haggans has died at the age of 46 years old. There has been no official word on his cause of death. Incidentally, the news was first reported on Tuesday night on a Pittsburgh radio show.\n\nOut of Colorado State, Haggans was of course drafted in the fifth round of the 2000 NFL Draft by the Steelers. He would go on to spend his first eight seasons in Pittsburgh, winning a Super Bowl during his time with the men in black and gold. Perhaps his biggest career highlight was when he sacked quarterback Matt Hasselbeck of the Seattle Seahawks on the opening drive of Super Bowl XL in 2005. The Steelers would go on to win the big game 21-10. In his last four seasons in Pittsburgh, Haggans - a starter - posted 332 tackles, 32.5 sacks, 12 forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries, and one interception.\n\nThe later years of Clark Haggans\n\nFollowing his time in Pittsburgh, he would make a move to the Arizona Cardinals with whom he played from 2008 to 2011, reaching a Super Bowl with them as well during that first season in 2008. Unfortunately, he would not taste victory on that occasion as the Cardinals lost to his former team 27-23."
