        "text": "Clark Haggans, a starting outside linebacker for the Pittsburgh Steelers’ Super Bowl XL championship team in 2006, died Monday in Fort Collins, Colo., at age 46.\n\nAccording to the Larimer County coroner’s office, an autopsy was performed Wednesday. Officials said cause and manner of death are pending further investigation, but no foul play was evident.\n\nA native of Torrance, Calif., Haggans was the Steelers’ fifth-round pick in 2000 after he set a Colorado State record that stands today with 33 career sacks. He played 107 games with the Steelers over the course of eight seasons, making 61 starts and recording 321⁄2 sacks. He sacked quarterback Matt Hasselbeck on Seattle’s first possession of Super Bowl XL, following a regular season that featured a career-high nine sacks in 13 games.\n\n“He’s full-speed, the whole game,” defensive end Aaron Smith said in 2007. “I don’t know how the man does it, but it’s amazing to watch him play. He’s got such a motor, and I don’t think people realize how athletic he really is, too.”\n\nHaggans recorded 61⁄2 sacks as a pass rush specialist off the bench in 2002. He moved into the starting lineup on a regular basis in 2004 when the Steelers cut Jason Gildon. Haggans often played opposite college teammate Joey Porter in the Steelers linebacking corps.\n\n“Clark never stops — ever,” defensive end Brett Keisel said in 2007. “It seems like, during the course of a game, when guys are starting to wear out and their energy levels are starting to drop, that’s when Clark really feasts on the opponent.”\n\nHaggans signed with the Arizona Cardinals in 2008 and played with the team until 2011, recording 14 more sacks. He suited up for nine games with the San Francisco 49ers in 2012 before retiring.\n\n“I pinch myself every day,” Haggans said in 2009. “Just to be out here in the NFL is kind of crazy.”\n\nHaggans was with the Cardinals but on injured reserve for the February 2009 Super Bowl won by the Steelers."
