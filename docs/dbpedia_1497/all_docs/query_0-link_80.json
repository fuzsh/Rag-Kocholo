Haggans holds the Colorado State all-time sack record to this day, with 33 sacks recorded.\n\nPittsburgh Steelers\n\nThe Steelers drafted Haggans out of the fifth round of the 2000 NFL Draft. He became a regular starter at left outside linebacker in 2004 when the team released long-time starter Jason Gildon.\n\nHaggans recorded six quarterback sacks in 2004, and had nine sacks during the 2005 regular season. Haggans was second on the Steelers defense in tackles for Super Bowl XL, and also recorded a sack, helping the Steelers defeat the Seattle Seahawks. In 2008, Haggans became an unrestricted free agent.\n\nArizona Cardinals\n\nOn March 26, 2008, Haggans agreed to a one-year contract with the Arizona Cardinals.

Without Haggans, the Cardinals would reach Super Bowl XLIII, but would lose to his old team, the Pittsburgh Steelers, 27-23.\n\nAn unrestricted free agent in the 2009 offseason, Haggans was re-signed to a three-year contract by the Cardinals on March 17.
