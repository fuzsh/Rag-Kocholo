        "text": "Clark Haggans: “I was happy I was drafted – and to go and see Joey there with open arms. They should have played that Reunited song. I had no idea about the process. I didn’t know what the process was if you got cut – I asked Joey when they’d let me know. When I didn’t get a call I asked Joey what to do – that they didn’t call me and tell me I made the team. He told me they didn’t do that and laughed, I asked what to do now, and he told me to “Show up for practice Monday, fool!” The rest was history.\n\nI met a lot of good dudes along the way that I’m still close with now. And how Mr. Rooney was. Going back to Pittsburgh to visit the team – it wasn’t like how other teams did it. I’d have guys ask me – “They did what for you? When I went down to my team, they told me I wasn’t welcome there now that I’m not playing for them.”\n\nIt’s like going to a high school reunion when you’re a Steeler. No matter who you are.”\n\nAndre Frazier: “Haggans – no one worked harder than him. He was a machine. I guess that’s why his career was so long. He didn’t make the splash plays like Porter – he wasn’t as physically gifted I don’t think. But his effort and hard work was amazing.”\n\nJerome Urban: “I joked with Clark Haggans when he came to Arizona. We laughed years later about the Super Bowl and how he had “The best jump ever” on the play where we got the holding call when it was debatable whether Clark was offsides or not.”\n\nAl Woods: “The funniest thing I remember is when the rookie linebackers didn’t do what they were supposed to. One time they filled up a guy’s car completely with popcorn. Ah – when Haggans filled up Garvin’s car? Yeah – that’s who it was!”\n\nArnold Harrison: “Haggans was a guy that stood out – he saw something in me. The NFL is competitive and guys usually don’t help others to take their spot. But he saw I could be someone who could help the team – that I earned my way. It was like a family. I ended up getting cut my rookie year but they brought me back due to an injury to Clark.”\n\nNakia Codie: “I will say one of the funniest people on the team to me was Clark Haggans. Great guy, great athlete, and a great personality.”\n\nRodney Bailey: “My roommate was Kendrell Bell – he and Haggans were some of the funniest guys. They all had their personalities, but we all came together. We were a tight unit.”"
