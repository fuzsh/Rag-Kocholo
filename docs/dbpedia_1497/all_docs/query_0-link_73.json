        "text": "1998 Record: 8-4 (5-3) | 1998 statistics | 1999 schedule\n\nHead coach: Sonny Lubick\n\nReturning starters: 10 (offense 3, defense 6)\n\nOutlook\n\nThe memories of last year's disappointing 8-4 season are still fresh in the minds of Rams fans. Heck, the memories of 1997's 11-2 finish that included a Western Athletic Conference title are still vivid. Let those images serve as perspective, as this year an eight-win season would be considered an unqualified success.\n\nRoad games with Colorado, Brigham Young and Wyoming won't provide a cushion from the hard realities of rebuilding. Coach Sonny Lubick must go about repairing an inconsistent running game, breaking in an inexperienced offensive line and putting some teeth back in a defense that three times allowed more than 40 points and eight times gave up 30 or more.\n\nOffense\n\nThe teams that form the new Mountain West have a reputation as aerial artists, but CSU does its best work on the ground. The team rushed for 2,631 yards in its Holiday Bowl-winning season two years ago. But the Rams managed just 1,978 yards on the ground last fall. The health of senior running back Kevin McDougal will be paramount. McDougal was limited to seven games and 547 yards last year because of hamstring and shoulder troubles after racking up 1,111 yards the previous season. Unlike recently, when CSU rotated backs in its single-back offense on nearly every series, McDougal will work as the featured back.\n\nThe success of that experiment might depend on a new-look offensive line, which boasts only two returning starters and one senior. Junior tackle Tim Stuber might be as good as any player at his position in conference. The line's lone senior, Blane Saipaia, was slated to move from tackle to center, but he is back at his original spot after sophomore Jason Koontz proved he could start in the middle. The only bad news for the group came when tackle Broc Finlayson's broke his right foot last week. He is expected to be out for up to six weeks. Broderick Lancaster could play either guard or tackle.\n\nWhile things are settling down on the line, the backfield remains up in the air. Quarterback Steve Cutlip has had been nursing a sore forearm, and has been throwing on a limited basis after missing six workouts. Fortunately, Jon Boyer has returned to the team to provide some depth. Boyer played in two games last year as sophomore, but following spring drills, he considered enrolling at a junior college. Just after fall camp opened, he notified Lubick he wanted to return to the team. Regardless of Cutlip's health Matt Newton could get the call behind center. Whoever it is throwing the ball, there are plenty of targets. Receivers Dallas Davis and Pete Rebstock have looked sharp in practice and Frank Rice appears fully recovered from last year's knee surgery. Davis must become the big-play guy this year after playing in a supporting role in '98.\n\nIt's a good sign if: McDougal's surgically repaired shoulder holds up.\n\nIt's a bad sign if: An untested group of lineman doesn't come together.\n\nDefense\n\nThere are significant holes to fill in each position group. Maybe the biggest is at linebacker, where Willie Taylor, the school's all-time leader in tackles, will be missed. Strong side linebacker Rick Crowell, a preseason candidates for the 1999 Butkus Award, will be expected to take his play to the next level. Ula Tuitele in the middle and Tony Colacion opposite Crowell at the other outside spot, should be the other starters.\n\nThe heart of the secondary is Erik Olson. The senior strong safety had 47 tackles last year despite missing three games with a leg injury. Olson is a three-year starter. Junior John Howell is competing with sophomore Aaron Sprague for the free safety position. Howell was a top backup and spot starter his first two seasons at Colorado State. But he played in just one game a year ago and received a medical redshirt after suffering a pulled hamstring which ended his season early. Junior cornerback Terrence Gibson started the final eight games a year ago. He is back, along with Andy Engelstad, the odd-on choice to play the other corner position. A year ago Engelstad alternated between cornerback and safety.\n\nClark Haggans is the team's top returning pass rusher and needs just four sacks to break the school record. A number of players are battling for time at the tackle positions, including Casey Wolf, Greg Pollard, Ron Cieslinski and Jamie Bennett. Sophomore Mike Mackenzie (6-2, 265) is the leading candidate to fill the other end position.\n\nIt's a good sign if: No one emerges from a host of candidates to fill gaps on the line.\n\nIt's a bad sign if: Howell's tender hamstring doesn't hold up.\n\nSpecial Teams\n\nThe kicking game will be solid. Punter Deone Horinek was second-team all-conference a year ago and finished sixth in the nation with a 44.83 per-punt average. Junior C.W. Hurst is in line to take the kicker's spot. Hurst made one of two field goals last season and also handled kickoff duties"
