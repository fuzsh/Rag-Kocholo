        "text": "As Colorado State was about to take the field for the Holiday\n\nBowl against Michigan back in December 1994, 22 freshmen ran to\n\nthe front of the pack and led the charge onto the turf at Jack\n\nMurphy Stadium. It had been the best season in the 101-year\n\nhistory of Colorado State football: The Rams went 10-2 in the\n\nregular season and won the WAC title for the first time, which\n\nwas reason enough to go wild. But something more was in the air.\n\nBefore surging through the tunnel and past their teammates, the\n\nfreshmen had pledged to each other that their class would\n\nsurpass the accomplishments of that season's seniors.\n\n\"We all kind of looked at each other and went crazy out on the\n\nfield,\" says defensive back Myron Terry. \"Our entire class had\n\nredshirted, so we knew we had to get our aggressions out then.\n\nAll of us had a feeling that good things were going to happen\n\nfrom that point on. Colorado State wasn't known as a football\n\npowerhouse when we got there, but the senior class had set the\n\nschool record for wins, and it was up to us to keep it going.\"\n\nThe brief sojourn on the San Diego sod was the only action those\n\nfreshmen saw that night, but four years later the Rams, bolstered\n\nby the class of '99, have now joined the ranks of the nation's\n\nelite.\n\nThe transformation, under coach Sonny Lubick, has been\n\nremarkable. The Rams have won more games (41) in his five\n\nseasons in Fort Collins than they did in all of the '80s (36).\n\nLast season Colorado State had an alltime-high 11 wins and took\n\nits third WAC title in four years. Lubick calls this senior\n\nclass his best yet, and 17 starters return from a team that\n\nended '97 by winning nine straight.\n\nA major concern, however, is replacing quarterback Moses Moreno,\n\nwho threw for 2,257 yards and 20 touchdowns last fall.\n\nFifth-year senior Ryan Eslinger, who has thrown just 27 passes\n\nin college, will begin the season as the starter. Despite his\n\nlack of experience, his teammates have confidence in him. \"Ryan\n\nis a big part of our class, and with all due respect to Moses\n\nMoreno, Ryan is a better athlete,\" Terry says. Eslinger has the\n\nluxury of playing behind 6'4\", 285-pound center Mike Newell and\n\n6'6\", 310-pound left guard Anthony Cesario, neither of whom\n\nallowed a sack last season. He also has a pair of 1,000-yard\n\nfullbacks to hand off to in senior Damon Washington, the\n\nstarter, and junior Kevin McDougal.\n\n\"We're really not going to change anything offensively,\" says\n\nLubick. \"We've operated out of the one-back set pretty\n\neffectively for several years now, and we return a couple of\n\ntremendous runners. But our quarterback has to be confident,\n\nbecause we're not going to run the ball every down.\"\n\nColorado State's biggest strength is its swarming defense.\n\nLinebackers Nate Kvamme (110 tackles) and Willie Taylor (92) and\n\ndefensive end Clark Haggans (66 tackles, 11 sacks) are punishing\n\npass rushers, and Terry (six interceptions) is the stalwart of\n\nthe secondary.\n\nThe Rams will be tested early. They open with Michigan State and\n\nthen play rival Colorado, whom they haven't beaten since 1986.\n\nUnlike in previous years, though, these are games Colorado State\n\nis supposed to win. \"When I took over I hoped to turn this into\n\na .500 program, and I think people would have been happy with\n\nthat,\" says Lubick. \"But with the success we've had, people are\n\nexpecting us to win every game. It's time to see if this group\n\ncan deal with a little success.\"\n\n--B.J. Schecter\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: TIM DEFRISCO Two for 2K Both McDougal (above) and Washington are coming off 1,000-yard seasons.
