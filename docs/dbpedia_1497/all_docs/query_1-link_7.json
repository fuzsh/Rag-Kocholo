        "text": "PITTSBURGH -- Former Steelers outside linebacker and Super Bowl champion Clark Haggans died at the age of 46, a team spokesperson confirmed Wednesday morning.\n\nThe Larimer County coroner's office said in a release that it responded to a residence in Fort Collins, Colorado, on Monday to investigate the death of a male who was identified as Haggans. An autopsy was completed Wednesday with the cause and manner of death pending further investigation, the coroner's office said. No foul play was evident.\n\nA fifth-round pick by the Steelers out of Colorado State in the 2000 NFL draft, Haggans spent eight seasons in Pittsburgh and started alongside college teammate Joey Porter on the team that defeated the Seattle Seahawks to win Super Bowl XL in 2006. Haggans had five tackles and sacked quarterback Matt Hasselbeck on the opening drive of the game, putting an exclamation point on a season where he recorded a career-best nine sacks and four forced fumbles.\n\nHaggans was a full-time starter during his final four seasons in Pittsburgh and finished his Steelers career with one interception, 12 forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries, 332 tackles and 32.5 sacks.\n\nAfter Pittsburgh, Haggans spent four seasons with the Arizona Cardinals and retired after one final season with the San Francisco 49ers in 2012. He holds the Colorado State record with 33 career sacks and was inducted into the school's hall of fame in 2015.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."
