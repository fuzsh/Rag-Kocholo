        "text": "There is no doubt, in all aspects of life, there are some things that really are underappreciated—especially when it comes to the Pittsburgh Steelers. In this series as we approach the 2021 NFL regular season, I will examine former (and some current) Pittsburgh Steelers that can sometimes be forgotten when we talk about Steelers history. Some of these Steelers had brief careers, some excellent longevity. However, while every player has played a role, some have gone under the radar despite their contributions. This could be due to the era they played in, the talent in that era, or even just some of the Steelers teams they played on.\n\nToday we look at a Steeler who hoisted the franchise’s 5th Lombardi trophy while filling in big shoes at the start of his prime run with the Steelers.\n\nPhoto By Grant Halverson/Getty Images\n\nClark Haggans​\n\nIn 2004, the Pittsburgh Steelers not only drafted future Hall of Fame quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, but they also let go of the team’s all-time sack leader, Jason Gildon. The big question was who was going to be the next guy across from rising Joey Porter to wreak havoc on opposing offenses. In 2000, the Steelers had drafted a linebacker out of Colorado State with their 5th round pick: Clark Haggans.\n\nClark Haggans was a multi-sport athlete at Palos Verdes Peninsula High School; earning letter honors in football, basketball, and track. After leading his teams to two undefeated seasons in high school as a tight end and defensive tackle, he would enroll at Colorado State and joined the football program as a walk-on—where he would foreshadow his NFL career playing alongside Joey Porter. During his time at Colorado State, he would become the team’s all-time sack leader (a record he still holds) and receive All-Mountain West Conference honors in 1999.\n\nIn 2000, he would be selected as the 137th overall pick by the Pittsburgh Steelers; the same team that drafted his teammate Joey Porter the season before. During his first four years, he grew his role in the rotation of the defense and had solid production despite only logging four starts during that time frame. Once Jason Gildon departed the Steel City, Haggans was called upon to fill the large void. He didn’t look back.\n\nOver the next four seasons, he became the steady starter at outside linebacker across from his longtime teammate Porter and another rising star in James Harrison. During this span, he would record 233 tackles, 25 sacks, and 8 forced fumbles. His greatest season came in the 2005 season where he would record 9 sacks and 4 forced fumbles on the AFC’s top-ranked defense. He would end the season getting Steeler Nation “One For The Thumb”. He would hold down the fort until his departure following the 2007 season. He would still go on to play five more seasons in the NFL, but it always felt like Pittsburgh is where he belonged.\n\nKnown for his complimentary pass rush and play in the run defense, Clark Haggans was a consistent force along the defensive line for the Steelers. Though his numbers weren’t flashy like his counterparts’ were, he was a respected Steeler who ground out the tough work and was a key contributor to the Steelers’ 5th Lombardi run.\n\nSo I raise a toast alongside Steeler Nation and say to Mr. Haggans: Thank you for your contributions, dedication, and for being a Pittsburgh Steeler!\n\n#SteelerNation\n\nSupport SteelerNation by clicking here to read the story.."
