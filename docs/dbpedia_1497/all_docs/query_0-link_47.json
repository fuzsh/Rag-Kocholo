        "text": "FORT COLLINS — Mohamed Kamara thought last year’s season finale against New Mexico was going to be his last game at Colorado State.\n\nThere were times when he thought the final game of the 2021 season was his last with the Rams.\n\nBut this Saturday against Nevada, it’s real this time. It’s Kamara’s last home game in front of the CSU fans that have come to love him over the last five years. He’ll participate in the pregame Senior Day festivities like he did a year ago. Except this time, he’ll be surrounded by a bunch of teammates who started their careers elsewhere.\n\n“The lone kid that’s been here all those years is Mo Kamara,” coach Jay Norvell said this week, listing off all the players that will be honored.\n\nIn today’s day and age, players like Kamara — who has spent all five years at one school under three different head coaches — are becoming more and more rare.\n\n“It’s really impressive,” CSU defensive line coach Buddha Williams told The Denver Gazette. “Not too many guys stick around. A guy of his stature could’ve left and got money elsewhere, but how competitive he is, his pride, that speaks volume to his character.”\n\nIt wasn’t always a given that Kamara would stay with the Rams, though.\n\nNorvell spent countless hours on the phone with Kamara and his parents when he first took the job in Fort Collins, calling it his biggest recruiting job of that year. He said the same thing last year when he had to convince Kamara and others like cornerback Chigozie Anusiem to come back for their extra year of eligibility.\n\nFor everyone involved, it’s paid off.\n\n“I couldn’t be prouder of Mo,” Norvell said. “I think he’s grown as a player so much in these last two years, but I’m more proud of him as a leader. You talk about setting an example in practice and preparation and just being relentless with his effort and physicality.”\n\nBut a universe exists where Kamara never ends up at CSU in the first place.\n\nThe Rams don’t typically get players from his hometown of Newark, N.J. Kamara originally signed to play at Temple, where his older brother Amara played, and his other offers out of high school included Rutgers and Boston College.\n\nWhen he did join the Rams and got to Fort Collins, it was admittedly daunting. Campus was empty in the summer when he arrived and he was forced to make friends in a place that couldn’t be more different from where he grew up.\n\nFive years later, he has zero regrets.\n\n“That was the best decision of my life,” Kamara told The Denver Gazette. “The reason why is because I’ve been humbled. I was able to grow as a man, get my school paid for and was able to play football. I can say I’m very blessed.”\n\nDespite all the numbers Kamara has put up this season and the records he has a chance to break in the final few weeks, that’s what’s most impressive to Norvell. Not only has he proven his worth on the field, but he’s done it off of it as well.\n\n“We always talk about planting trees you don’t see,” Norvell said. “As a senior, you wonder how you can really contribute to the program. Well, you contribute by being a good example. You show the younger players how to prepare, how to practice.\n\n“We have a talented defensive line and a lot of good young players. They see how Mo practices, they see how he prepares and that passes on to our younger players. When you have a good program, your older players teach your younger players how to play. That’s so important.”\n\nKamara will be able to look back on his time and see his influence reflected in up-and-coming Rams players like Marshon Oxley and Nuer Gatkouth, but his personal achievements are nice, too.\n\nHe’s already put together one of the best seasons by a defender in program history with 11.5 sacks and 14 tackles for loss. He’s likely on his way to winning Mountain West defensive player of the year and joining the likes of Joey Porter, Shaquil Barrett, Greg Myers and others as one of the best defenders to ever play for the Rams.\n\nThe big number he’s chasing right now, though, is 33. That’s the all-time sack record held by Clark Haggans and right behind with 29 in his career is Kamara. He doesn’t shy away from it, either.\n\n“I would love to get the sack record,” Kamara said. “Just because it’s not just me getting the sack record, it’s the whole defense. It’s all of us.”\n\nKamara has already accomplished two of the three things on his list from when he agreed to come back for this final season.\n\nGraduate? Check.\n\nRaise his NFL Draft stock? Check.\n\nThe only thing left? Make a bowl game and help put CSU back on the map.\n\nWith two games left, he and the Rams have a chance to get there.\n\n“For me personally, it would (feel) like I did something,” Kamara said.\n\nAsk anyone around him and they’ll tell you, he’s already accomplished that.\n\n“He is the university, in my mind,” Williams said. “People will know Mo’s name for years to come.”\n\nKing’s prediction\n\nColorado State 31, Nevada 13\n\nThe Rams give themselves a chance to play for a bowl game next week in Hawaii with a big win over Norvell’s former team. CSU made things more difficult that they should’ve been last week against San Diego State, but a big lead this week should be no problem to hold onto against a Wolf Pack team that has one of the Mountain West’s worst offenses, led by former Colorado QB Brendon Lewis."
