        "text": "DALLAS - Before he became one of the best linebackers in football, James Harrison was just another Pittsburgh Steelers project, a raw player plucked from practice squad anonymity so confused by the complexities of Dick LeBeau's defense that he would stop cold in the middle of a play, with no idea where to run as the action continued around him.\n\nHarrison was not alone in his bewilderment. Clark Haggans, who spent eight years with the Steelers before signing with Arizona, said that in his rookie year of 2000, he chose the opposite tack. When he did not know what to do, he blitzed - the team is nicknamed Blitzburgh, after all - hoping that he had guessed right.\n\n\"'Oh, I was supposed to cover? My bad,'\" Haggans says now. \"I knew I had to get it right or I'd be gone.\"\n\nHe added: \"Around the NFL, you play them because of the money you're giving them. Pittsburgh doesn't do anything until you know your football.\"\n\nFor 40 years, Pittsburgh has churned out linebackers as reliably as the old mills forged steel. Jack Lambert's jersey remains a best-seller 21 years after he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and his ferocious play - pummeling quarterbacks, pounding running backs - set the standard for a franchise that today will try to win its seventh Super Bowl with old-school defense.\n\nGreat linebacking may be a Pittsburgh tradition but it is the current iteration of the Steelers that has come close to perfecting the care and feeding of linebackers, unearthing them even in the draft's late rounds, sometimes changing their positions, keeping them in the pipeline and making them sit, marinating in a difficult defense until its details seep in.\n\nIt is an approach summed up by the position's current guru, linebackers coach Keith Butler.\n\n\"I don't like rookies,\" Butler said. \"I don't trust them. And until I'm comfortable with them, they won't play. I usually get comfortable with them around their second or third year.\"\n\nThe Steelers' regimen makes a mockery of drafting for need and free-agent spending sprees. They have so many linebackers that they are able to let productive veterans go when it is time for their next big contract because there is a younger, often less expensive, version ready to step in.\n\nThis season's group - part of the league's top-ranked rushing defense (62.8 yards per game allowed) and the league's leading sack defense (48) - might provide the clearest example of the Steelers' method for building a seamless unit.\n\nHarrison, who bounced among practice squads and did a stint in NFL Europe, did not start every game until his fifth year, after Joey Porter - groomed the same way - left as a free agent. When Haggans left as a free agent in 2008, LaMarr Woodley, a second-round pick in 2007, stepped in to start and had 11.5 sacks. Lawrence Timmons was a first-round pick in 2007, but did not become a regular starter until 2009, when he had seven sacks. James Farrior is the lone free agent, and he started immediately after leaving the New York Jets and signing with the Steelers in 2002.\n\nButler has been linebackers coach for eight seasons - an eternity by NFL standards, especially considering he has worked for two head coaches. He looks for two things when studying college linebackers: whether they can run and whether they can hit. Those things, Butler said, he cannot teach.\n\nThen the scouting department looks for flaws - off-field incidents or some kind of physical shortcoming. Those players are downgraded on the Steelers' draft board. If other teams draft those players, it frees other players to drop to lower rounds, where the Steelers hope to scoop them up.\n\nOnce they are in Pittsburgh, Butler puts young linebackers through something of a linebacking university, conducting 45-minute sessions each Thursday and Friday morning. In those tutorials, Butler calls out the defense, and the players must say what their responsibility is. Their learning curve is steepened because the Steelers frequently draft defensive ends and turn them into linebackers, as they did with Woodley.\n\nThose players must learn to rush while standing up instead of having one hand on the ground, and to recognize offensive formations. All linebackers learn at least seven pass-coverage techniques, and the Steelers like to bolster their depth by having each linebacker able to play inside or outside. The defense also may have to make a half-dozen adjustments depending on whether the offense puts a player in motion.\n\nHaggans recalls Butler making fun of players if a mistake showed up on film, but he also said older players are like extra coaches helping younger players. The linebackers bond by spending extra time together, Butler included.\n\nStill, the education takes time. Harrison had the team's secretaries type up wristbands of play calls and his responsibilities - base defense on one arm, substitution packages on the other - to help him learn the defense. Haggans said it took him two years before he understood where players would be and why they were running a certain defense. Even Farrior, a five-year veteran before arriving in Pittsburgh, said he did not fully absorb the system right away. He offers the same advice to each young player as he arrives.\n\n\"It's going to be overwhelming. You're not going to get it your first time around,\" Farrior said he tells them. \"We always tell them when the light turns on and you start to get it, that's when the fun happens.\"\n\nHarrison remembers when he wondered if he understood what coaches were saying. He said he finally grasped the defense about three years ago - not coincidentally in 2008, the season he had 16 sacks and was named the NFL's defensive player of the year."
