It has been several months since the death of former Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Clark Haggans at just 46-years-old.

Now we know what took him back in June.

Steelers Now’s Alan Saunders reported Monday that the Larimer County coroner’s office announced that Haggans died of “complications from chronic alcohol abuse.”

Haggans was a collegiate standout at Colorado State, earning first-team all-Mountain West honors. He was eventually inducted into the Colorado State University Athletics Hall of Fame. Following his time with the Rams, the Steelers selected Haggans in the fifth round, 137th-overall, of the 2000 NFL Draft, and he played for the team through the 2007 season.

Will Levis shined in his first start for Titans. Will the former Penn State QB get his second start Thursday against the Steelers?

He had six sacks in 2004 and nine in 2005. He was also second on the team in tackles and recorded a sack in the team’s Super Bowl XL win.

Haggans left the Steelers following the 2007 season for the Arizona Cardinals in 2008. Haggans was on the team, but was placed on injured reserve and did not play for the Cardinals that year in Super Bowl XLIII against his old team, the Steelers. He went on to play for the Cardinals through the 2011 season.

He closed out his career with the San Francisco 49ers in 2012.

Haggans finished his career with 520 tackles, 46.5 sacks and an interception.
