However, the game against Atletico Madrid will be played at the Stadio San Vito-Gigi Marulla in the city of Cosenza.\n\n• Their home kit is a blue and red striped shirt and blue shorts and socks, whilst they don a white shirt, with a diagonal red and blue stripe, and white shorts and socks for away trips.\n\n• Crotone have only ever had one foreign coach, Croatia's Ivan Juric, the man who led the team to Serie A for the first time in their history. Juric had stints at Sevilla FC and Albacete, as well as at Crotone themselves, during his playing career. Following his success last season, Genoa CFC have signed him as their head coach for this campaign."
