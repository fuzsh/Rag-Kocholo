        "text": "With how the opening 30 or so minutes went between Juventus and Crotone on Monday night, there was plenty of time to talk about things that weren’t happening on the field. A few of the things would have had you scratching your head, too. There was talk about how there’s 16 teams in Serie A — which obviously isn’t true. There was talk about how Crotone are, despite being in 20th place, still capable of staying up because they’re not far off from being outside of the relegation playoffs — which, as you probably know, isn’t a thing that happens in Serie A.\n\nThe match announcers also wanted you to know that Cristiano Ronaldo had only scored one goal in his last five games.\n\nCall that putting it on a tee and it then being punted right out of Allianz Stadium.\n\nAs if he had AirPods in his ears listening to the broadcast, Ronaldo unofficially respond to that little stat above by turning a game that was scoreless into one Juventus was controlling in a matter minutes. Ronaldo’s pair of headers within the span of eight minutes was the driving force in Juventus avoiding another disastrous result against the worst team in the league and a win everybody expected them to get. Throw in Weston McKennie’s second-half strike and Juventus cut the Serie A deficit back down to single digits with their 3-0 win over dead-last Crotone.\n\nGo ahead and exhale now.\n\nJuventus was able to beat the worst team in the league.\n\nThis wasn’t a repeat of what happened in mid-October.\n\nJuventus, after two really bad losses against Napoli and Porto, are victorious again.\n\nAnd they had their leading man leading the way. Rather good when that happens no matter the opponent, no matter the context and no matter the circumstances.\n\nJuventus needed this win in the worst possible way knowing how the last week or so went. Then you throw in how the Milan derby went a little more than 24 hours earlier and beating Crotone was the only option. (Yes, more than before, if that is a thing.) It wasn’t only about getting back to single digits in terms of how many points they trail Inter by, but jumping a couple of teams at the same time was also possible — and exactly what happened.\n\nJuve entered the game in six points and on the brink of dropping out of the top six.\n\nAfter Monday night’s win, Juve’s sitting in third place — and, don’t look now, but only four points off second place — and back into a position where we can start reminding everybody that they’ve still got a game in hand to play. (Yes, even though it’s against a team that just beat Juventus, whatever.)\n\nThis could have been a tricky game for the simple fact that it’s after a disappointing Champions League result and with some many players out injured. This team is far from healthy, far from fresh and has basically been trying to grind their way through the last two months with a game every three or four days. This was a refreshing win in the simple fact that it was rather comfortable after Ronaldo’s pair of headers found the back of the net. (And, let’s be honest, Juve could have led by more than just two goals at halftime based on the chances they created.)\n\nAnd when you’ve got Ronaldo doing Ronaldo things in the air like he did Monday night, that usually results in good things for the team that signs his paychecks.\n\nRANDOM THOUGHTS AND RANDOM OBSERVATIONS"
