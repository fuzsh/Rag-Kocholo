        "text": "Juventus leads the TV ratings as well. The national team break is the perfect moment to review the TV ratings and the stadium attendance data of the Serie A teams. The black-and-white of Turin are dominating the ranking with an average of 2 million viewers per game, even due to the big matches that Juventus played against Inter and AC Milan who reached an overall peak of 3 million spectators on average.\n\nIn second place we find AC Milan with an average of 1.4 million spectators per game. The red-and- black TV audience was definitely affected by the two matches played at 3 pm against Udinese and Pescara in which only 450,000 viewers on average were staring at the TV. Inter and Napoli are following in third and fourth position of this particular ranking.\n\nCrotone sits at the bottom of the ranking just behind Empoli and Atalanta. The newly promoted team collected a mere 136,000 TV viewers on average. Three of Crotone’s games had an audience of less than 20,000. We are talking about Sassuolo-Crotone (18,000), Crotone-Genoa (17,000), and Crotone-Chievo (6,000). Although the numbers reported above are not “exciting” at all, the red-and-blue from Calabria are not the least followed team so far. Only 307 people have followed Genoa-Empoli on Mediaset Premium, while 4,812 people decided to switch their TV on to watch Empoli-Chievo.\n\nOverall, the top teams are those collecting the big chunk of TV ratings. Juventus, AC Milan, Inter, Roma, and Napoli reached a peak of 6.9 million TV viewers against the 6 mln of the remaining 15 teams.\n\nIn the chart above we wanted to highlight that the calculations relating to TV audience on Premium are made based on the number of games played by a team and broadcasted on a Mediaset pay-TV format. This is the reason why for some clubs, the “total” will not be equal to the sum of the average audience of Sky and Premium."
