        "text": "FC Crotone is a football club from the town of Crotone currently playing in Serie B. it was founded inÂ 1923.\n\nThroughout their entire history Crotone led a mostly unremarkable existence as a lower division side. The clubâs fortunes promised to take a turn for the better in the 2000s as they made their first run into Serie B in the 2000/01 season. Throughout the decade, the team tried to get a toehold in the league but teetered on the brink between the second and the third tier. Since 2009/10 Crotone regularly compete in Serie B. The farthest Crotone climbed up in the league table was the 8th place in the 2009/10Â season.\n\nThe team are often nicknamed the Pythagoreans or the Sharks and wear red and blue uniforms. They play their home matches at the 9,631-seater Stadio EzioÂ Scida."
