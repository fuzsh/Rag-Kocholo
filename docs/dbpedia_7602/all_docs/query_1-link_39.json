        "text": "Antonio Calanni/Associated Press\n\nThe month of December could prove pivotal for AC Milan’s season. Prior to the winter break they will face three of Serie A’s bottom four teams in an eminently winnable run of games. Before that, however, they must take care of Coppa Italia business against Crotone on Tuesday.\n\nCrotone only avoided a Serie B relegation play-off last season thanks to Catania’s demotion for their role in a match-fixing scandal. But after coming so close to dropping down a division, the club has been revitalised this season under new coach Ivan Juric.\n\nThey will visit the San Siro to take on Milan as the second-placed team in Serie B, where they lie just one point behind table-topping Cagliari. It’s been an astonishing turnaround, one that means Milan cannot afford to take them lightly.\n\nThe Rossoneri dismantled Sampdoria in impressive fashion on Saturday, winning 4-1 with their best team performance of the season. Afterward, Sinisa Mihajlovic was full of belief about his side’s upcoming run of games.\n\nHe told Mediaset Premium (h/t Football Italia): “The objective is to win all the next games leading up to the Christmas break. I am convinced we’ll do better in the second half of the season, especially as we face the big teams on our own turf.”\n\nMarco Luzzani/Getty Images\n\nMilan’s Coppa Italia fourth-round meeting with Crotone precedes league fixtures against Carpi, Hellas Verona and Frosinone, and Mihajlovic is understandably confident of taking the spoils from all four games.\n\nCrotone are not to be underestimated, however. Juric’s men have only lost once in their last 14 games in all competitions and will go to San Siro full of ambition and without pressure.\n\nMihajlovic will be desperate for his side to grab nine more points in Serie A over the coming weeks, but if Milan are to start December strongly, they must beat Crotone in cup action.\n\nDate: Tuesday, 1 December\n\nTime: 8 p.m. GMT (3 p.m. ET)\n\nVenue: San Siro, Milan, Italy\n\nTV Info: Not available\n\nLive Stream: Bet365 (UK)\n\nForm Guide\n\nMilan 4-1 Sampdoria\n\nJuventus 1-0 Milan\n\nMilan 0-0 Atalanta\n\nLazio 1-3 Milan\n\nMilan 1-0 Chievo\n\nSpezia 0-1 Crotone\n\nCrotone 3-0 Ternana\n\nVirtus Lanciano 1-1 Crotone\n\nCrotone 3-1 Avellino\n\nPescara 4-1 Crotone\n\nTeam News and Predicted Lineups\n\nMilan used a 4-4-2 system for the first time this season against Sampdoria. It worked well, hence the system will continue to be used against Crotone.\n\nNow Mihajlovic has a good idea of what his best lineup is, he will probably use the Crotone game as an opportunity to take a look at those players who have been out of form or underused this season so far.\n\nMattia De Sciglio, Luiz Adriano and Keisuke Honda could all do with the run out after some poor displays in recent months that have earned them respective average ratings of 6.78, 6.50 and 6.28 with WhoScored.com.\n\nDe Sciglio has featured fairly regularly because of injuries to both Ignazio Abate and Luca Antonelli, though he has not yet established himself in either full-back position.\n\nIn his last outing, against Atalanta, the 23-year-old looked nervous as he picked up a yellow card before being hooked during the interval.\n\nAdriano has scored three goals in 13 Serie A appearances in his maiden Milan year, but his all-round performance has not been up to scratch. The Brazilian would relish the chance to reassert himself against Serie B opposition.\n\nMeanwhile, Honda has been restricted to substitute appearances of late. The Japanese playmaker has taken part in seven games in the last two months but only totalled 49 minutes of action in the process.\n\nGiuseppe Bellini/Getty Images\n\nWhile De Sciglio, Adriano and Honda need a confidence boost, others need a break.\n\nJuraj Kucka worked his socks off in an energy-sapping central-midfield display against Sampdoria and could be replaced by Andrea Poli for this match. Likewise, Mihajlovic may rest Alex and bring in Philippe Mexes at centre-back.\n\nMilan are still without Mario Balotelli, with CEO Adriano Galliani telling Milan Channel (h/t Football Italia): “We hope to have [Balotelli] ready for December 20 against Frosinone.”\n\nAndrea Bertolacci will remain out for a similar period of time, and Mihajlovic will also not be able to call upon long-term absentee Jeremy Menez, goalkeeper Diego Lopez or midfield enforcer Nigel de Jong.\n\nCrotone will be delighted they are able to travel to the San Siro without serious injury concerns following their 1-0 away to Spezia on Friday.\n\nTactically, Juric, who was a technically proficient midfielder as a player, is influenced by Gian Piero Gasperini. The Croat played for Gasperini at Genoa before following him to Inter as a coach, and he prefers to use the 3-4-3 system Gasperini has utilised so well with the Grifone.\n\nAgainst Milan, Juric will be able to call upon experienced Brazilian centre-back and club captain Claiton, who spent time with Milan as a youngster, to marshal his defensive line.\n\nFurther forward, Ante Budimir is likely to lead the attack, where he should find support from Romanian winger Adrian Stoian and Federico Ricci, who is on loan from Roma.\n\nMilan (4-4-2): Gianluigi Donnarumma, Mattia De Sciglio, Philippe Mexes, Alessio Romagnoli, Luca Antonelli; Keisuke Honda, Andrea Poli, Riccardo Montolivo, Giacomo Bonaventura; M’Baye Niang and Luiz Adriano.\n\nCrotone (3-4-3): Alex Cordaz, Eloge Yao, Claiton, Gian Marco Ferrari; Giuseppe Zampano, Andrea Barberis, Leonardo Capezzi, Bruno Martella; Adrian Stoian, Ante Budimir and Federico Ricci.\n\nPlayers to Watch\n\nM’Baye Niang (Milan)\n\nMarco Luzzani/Getty Images\n\nAfter scoring his first league goals for Milan against Sampdoria, M'Baye Niang will be determined to continue his good form.\n\nThe French forward has shown energy, desire and no little skill since returning from a successful spell on loan at Genoa in the second half of last season, and he could prove to be the perfect foil to Carlos Bacca up front for Milan.\n\nSince returning from injury Niang has started all of the Rossoneri’s last three fixtures and could further cement his place in the side with another strong display against Crotone.\n\nEloge Yao (Crotone)\n\nEloge Yao joined Crotone on loan from Internazionale in the summer, and the Ivorian has played an integral role in the club’s excellent start to the campaign.\n\nDespite being just 19 years of age, he has bookmarked a regular spot in Juric’s back three, playing 14 of the Rossoblu’s 15 Serie B fixtures so far.\n\nThe athletic young defender would surely love nothing more than to send the city rivals of his parent club out of the cup in their own backyard.\n\nKey Battle\n\nAlessio Romagnoli (Milan) vs. Ante Budimir (Crotone)\n\nAlessio Romagnoli has quickly developed into a leader at the heart of Milan’s defence since joining the club from Roma in the summer following a protracted pursuit.\n\nPer Squawka, he has the highest performance score of all Milan’s centre-backs this season, though he cannot allow for any complacency against Crotone as he will be up against a difficult opponent in Budimir.\n\nHis physicality and persistence can give a defence headaches, meaning Romagnoli will need to be on his game if Milan are to keep a clean sheet.\n\nOdds (via Oddschecker)\n\nMilan: 4-11\n\nCrotone: 10-1"
