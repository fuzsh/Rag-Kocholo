        "text": "Promoted side Crotone completed a great escape and sent Empoli down with a 3-1 win over Lazio in Serie A on Sunday.\n\nThe southern club were eight points adrift of safety at one stage but a stunning revival saw them close the gap for good, with Andrea Nalini and Diego Falcinelli firing up an agitated crowd with first-half goals.\n\nLazio, who had Bastos sent off, replied with a Ciro Immobile penalty after the break but Nalini would add gloss to the historic result.\n\nEmpoli, for whom a seven-game losing run proved fatal, joined Palermo in the drop zone as the Sicilians triumphed 2-1 thanks to Ilija Nestorovski and substitute Bruno Henrique, with Rade Krunic notching for the doomed Tuscans.\n\nFrancesco Totti called time on his 24-year career as a Roma player with a well-timed substitute appearance that inspired the Giallorossi to beat Genoa 3-2 on the final day of the season.\n\nHad Roma failed to win, Napoli would have beaten them into the Champions League group stage courtesy of their 4-2 triumph at Sampdoria.\n\nDries Mertens closed out his remarkable campaign with a 28th goal as Napoli took the lead, and Lorenzo Insigne's wonder-strike put them two ahead before Marek Hamsik put Samp to bed shortly after the break.\n\nNaples-born striker Fabio Quagliarella and Ricky Alvarez scored for the hosts, with Jose Callejon netting Napoli's fourth.\n\nPescara were relegated weeks ago but returned to Serie B with their heads held high after holding Fiorentina to a 2-2 draw.\n\nIn the early game, AC Milan suffered a painful conclusion to their poor season as Fabio Pisacane fired Cagliari to a 2-1 stoppage-time win.\n\nInter enjoyed the last day, however, putting Udinese to the sword before a summer rebuilding project under a new head coach begins.\n\nEder, Ivan Perisic and Marcelo Brozovic fired the Nerazzurri clear before half-time and, after Eder completed his brace, Gabrielle Angella's own goal confirmed the 5-2 home win at San Siro, even though Andrija Balic and Duvan Zapata struck late consolations."
