        "text": "by Franco Ficetola\n\nW ith their late-April draw against Modena, FC Crotone mathematically gained their first-ever promotion to Serie A. Raffaele Palladino’s historic goal for the club succeeded in restoring to Italy’s top flight a piece of Calabria, a region that has had no exponents in Serie A since Reggina’s relegation in 2009.\n\nCrotone’s success was really quite extraordinary and unexpected. Last summer, everybody thought Serie B would be dominated by Cagliari, a team accustomed to Serie A and so deemed certain to achieve promotion without problems.\n\nThis is in fact what happened, because Cagliari ended the season as Serie B champions, mainly because Crotone’s players have been on vacation since the day promotion was secured with three games remaining. Regardless, this doesn’t diminish the value of what coach Ivan Jurić’s boys achieved this season, ruling the championship right from the start.\n\nWhat’s amazing about Crotone is that chairman Raffaele Vrenna didn’t spend a single Euro last summer on transfer fees to build this team.\n\nYes, you read it right, Crotone is completely made up of loanees, free agents and home-grown players, their dominance in games demonstrating just how well this club acted during transfer windows, recruiting some of the most cost-efficient players around.\n\nMisfits and free agents: the FC Crotone way\n\nWhen Crotone’s general manager went to Hamburg asking for striker Ante Budimir, St Pauli’s chairman probably thought it was just a dream: he finally had the chance to get rid of a player that scored no goals in 19 appearances in 2.Bundesliga in 2014/15, showing not even the slightest clue of what he would become in Italy.\n\nOn a free loan to Crotone, Budimir scored 17 goals in 41 appearances, proving himself as one of the most promising centre forwards in Italy and arousing interest from clubs like Roma and Fiorentina.\n\nAnother player on loan to Crotone is Federico Ricci. The right winger who grew up in Roma scored 11 goals this season, showing uncommon skills and speed, leading Inter Milan to consider him as a possible purchase this summer.\n\nSEE ALSO: The Serie A shopping list – 7 under-the-radar talents on Premier League scouts’ shortlists\n\nThe last component of the Pitagorici (Pythagoreans in English) forward trio is Raffaele Palladino, a man who, having played for Juventus, Genoa and Italy’s national team, added an essential pinch of experience to a very young team. He joined the club as a free agent in November due to Parma’s recent bankruptcy.\n\nHaving the right mix of experience and freshness, Crotone’s midfield also proved the shrewdness of the club’s transfer strategies. Midfielders like Leonardo Capezzi, Andrea Barberis and Bruno Martella defend and attack with the same dedication and were instrumental in dictating the pace and helping the defence throughout the season.\n\nThe rearguard, guided by captain Claiton, has one of the team’s most talented players: Eloge Koffi Yao. The Ivorian-born centre back can also play as right full-back, and is currently on loan from Inter Milan. Being only 20 he still has a lot of room for improvement, but has already shown great technique and a good physique, and could potentially become one of the most complete defenders in Italy in three or four years time.\n\nThe ability in choosing the right players during transfer windows, a group of footballers both talented and willing, and a coach with some good ideas in mind like Jurić: here’s what it takes to achieve promotion to Serie A.\n\nThere’s curiosity on whether the same strategy that brought them to top division will allow Crotone to avoid relegation in 2016-17 season. The task is very arduous, also because Jurić has already decided to leave for Genoa, but nobody knows how far a team fuelled by the support of a whole region can go.\n\nSouthern comfort\n\nThe pride Crotone supporters feel is the same felt by supporters of every team in southern Italy that manages to reach Serie A.\n\nIt’s a pride driven by the chance for such clubs to represent this whole part of the country in the top league, competing against the northern clubs, historically the major part of Italian football.\n\nThis ‘Southern pride’ involves many other aspects of life, and has its roots in the different ways the economy of these two parts of Italy has developed through history, a factor that goes way beyond just sport.\n\nTHE FAMOUS 14 – SOUTHERN-BASED PARTICIPANTS IN SERIE A HISTORY:\n\nNapoli, Cagliari, Bari, Palermo, Catania, Lecce, Foggia, Avellino, Reggina, Catanzaro, Salernitana, Frosinone, Messina, CROTONE\n\nAs far as football is concerned, though, the imbalance between the south and north of Italy is evident and undeniable: Crotone is just the 14th club from southern Italy in the history of Serie A, out of 65 clubs that have played in this championship since its foundation as it is now in 1929.\n\nWhat are the reasons behind this disproportion? The answer is history. Nothing more and nothing less.\n\nItalian football’s northern dominance\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, football clubs were founded in northern Italy under the influence of some English gentlemen: Genoa, Udinese and Milan, for example.\n\nIn 1898 the first Italian football tournament was held, but until 1910 it only involved teams from the northwest, mainly from the cities of Genoa, Milan, and Turin. In the 1910s the championship was slowly expanded to include teams from the northeast, remaining thus confined to the northern part of Italy.\n\nIn the meantime, the rest of the nation was trying to create its own football movement. But without an English influence in terms of knowledge of this sport, it was difficult to keep pace with the already well-established northern clubs.\n\nIn the rare friendly matches organised between southern and northern teams, those from the south were inevitably and heavily defeated every single time, even if they played minor northern teams.\n\nThere were several attempts by the Italian Football Federation to include southern teams into a national league during the 1920s, but southern clubs were continuously relegated because of their poor level.\n\nIn 1929, it was finally taken the decision to create Serie A and Serie B, which were quite similar to the ones we know today and involved the whole nation.\n\nAround the same time, some teams in central and southern Italy begun to fuse together, giving birth to clubs like Roma, Bari, Napoli. The south slowly started to improve its football level and that was the beginning of ‘modern’ football in Italy.\n\nL ooking at history, it’s easy to understand the reasons behind the big imbalance between Italy’s two halves. It’s clear that being almost 30 years late in this sport has had some implications.\n\nAlthough having showcased some glorious teams over the years, like Maradona’s Napoli of the late Eighties or Riva’s marvelous Cagliari, southern Italy still has much to do to catch up with the north, in terms of football.\n\nSince the creation of Serie A, a team from the south has won the Scudetto only three times (Cagliari 1969/70, Napoli 1986/87 & 1989/90). With the exception of three clubs from central Italy (Roma, Lazio and Fiorentina) with seven titles between them, all remaining Scudettos were won by northern clubs.\n\nThis trend probably won’t be changed easily, especially in the near future. But now Crotone are ready to write a new page in the history of southern football, with all their enthusiasm, their strength and their passionate supporters.\n\nThose who already believe that the final chapter of the book will be titled ‘relegation’ might be proved wrong.\n\nFollow Just Football on Twitter @JustFootball, Instagram or Facebook for more football features, analysis and opinion.\n\n(main image credit: FC Crotone Official via Twitter.)"
