Croton FC is designed for players looking to dedicate more effort to soccer. Games are extremely competitive and require a higher level of commitment in terms of practice/game attendance. Travel is generally within one hour. The cost of participating in this program is materially more as teams receive weekly sessions with a trainer and may play in tournaments each season.
