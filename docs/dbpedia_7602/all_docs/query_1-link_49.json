        "text": "With around 3.5 billion fans worldwide, football is the single most popular sport in the world, harnessing the power to captivate nations like no other sport. Modern football, as we know it today, originated in 19th-century England, but the present-day love for the sport knows no borders. Across the globe, certain countries stand out as the epitome of football fanaticism, where the game transcends mere entertainment and becomes an intrinsic part of the national identity. With an unwavering devotion to the sport, which countries are craziest about football? Ticketgum conducted this comprehensive study to get all the answers.

Fans are flocking to these stadiums in their thousands, as last season’s Premier League averaged 40,236 devoted attendees per match.

Here’s what we found:\n\nEngland’s domestic broadcast deal value over £1.6 billion per season\n\nEngland’s Premier League broadcast deal is currently priced at a whopping £1,632,000,000 per season, making it the only country in the world with a broadcast deal worth over a billion pounds per season. The Premier League has consistently secured substantial broadcasting contracts, making it one of the most lucrative football leagues in terms of TV rights. Sky Sports and BT Sport are two major broadcasters that hold the rights to televise Premier League matches in the UK, and have now been joined by Amazon Prime which has the rights to stream up to 20 matches per season. These contracts allow them to broadcast live matches, highlights, and related programming.\n\nGermany spends just under £1 billion on football broadcast deals\n\nFootball broadcast deals in Germany are not far behind, totalling £926,500,000 — that’s just under one billion pounds. The main broadcasters of the German Bundesliga are Sky Deutschland, a long-time provider of live match coverage, and DAZN, a sports streaming service which has now secured a portion of Bundesliga broadcasting rights.\n\nSpain has the third-most costly broadcast deals\n\nFigures remain high in Spain, where broadcast deals have reached £850,000,000 to provide coverage of La Liga matches. Broadcasting rights for the Spanish La Liga are predominantly held by Movistar Plus (owned by Telefónica) but also shared with DAZN.\n\nHighest Attendance in Football for the Main Leagues Across the Globe\n\nA key factor investigated in this study of the most football-crazy countries in the world was the average attendance rates for the main football league in each country. Germany came out on top with one of the biggest football fan bases in the world, averaging 42,992 devotees at each match. This was followed by Argentina, where an average of 40,768 football fans attended each Primera División game. Coming in at third place was England, boasting an average attendance of 40,236 attendees per match, showcasing the enduring popularity of the English Premier League. Spain followed closely in fourth place, with an average of 29,584 fans filling stadiums for each fixture, indicating that Spain has one of the biggest football fan bases in the world. Italy secured the fifth position with an average of 29,537 attendees per match, reflecting the passionate support for Serie A. Brazil, a nation known for its intense love for the sport, claimed the sixth spot, with an average of 28,296 attendees at each match. France, in seventh place, maintained a strong showing with an average of 23,708 attendees per match in Ligue 1. The United States, in eighth place, demonstrated a growing interest in soccer, drawing an average of 21,981 fans per match, showcasing the sport's upward trajectory in the country. Mexico, with its rich football history, secured the ninth position, attracting an average of 20,500 attendees per match, underscoring the nation's passion for Liga MX. The Netherlands rounded out the top ten, with an average of 19,388 fans in attendance at each match, reflecting the Dutch Eredivisie's dedicated following.\n\nMethodology\n\nTicketgum researched the football scene in 42 different countries to identify which are the most fanatic about football. A number of different variables were obtained in order to do so. The first was a count of football stadiums and their capacity, which was calculated as an average.\n\nOnly stadiums with a capacity of 10,000 or more were reported on, to ensure a consistent approach across each country as some didn’t report on stadiums of a smaller size. This data was obtained from Wikipedia.\n\nAverage attendance to 22/23 games of the main domestic league of each country was obtained through Transfermarkt. Some countries lacked 22/23 data, so older season data were used as a stand-in. Transfermarkt was also used for guidance on each country’s market value. A domestic league with a higher attendance and a bigger total market value of players would imply the league is bigger and centric to the country's sports scene.\n\nSome countries lacked data for average attendance at domestic leagues, namely Qatar, Ghana, and the Philippines. For these countries, the average attendance of all other countries was used as a stand-in figure so as to not hinder or benefit these countries in the rankings for this variable.\n\nNext, the estimated % of adults who were interested in watching the 2022 Qatar World Cup was obtained from a survey performed by tgmresearch.com. Scotland and China were excluded from this survey. For Scotland, a value of 1.6 million people that watched the Qatar World Cup was obtained from the scottishdailyexpress.co.uk. This was then compared to the number of 18-64 year olds in the country (adults) from scot.gov.uk to obtain a % of people who watched the World Cup. For China, the peak viewership was 100 million. This again was compared to the estimated number of 18-64-year-olds.\n\nThen, the domestic football league broadcast deals for each country (sourced from Wikipedia in £) as of June 2023 were obtained. This was done only for the main domestic league in each country. This league only included the biggest leagues, so if a country had no value, it was assigned the average of the rest of the countries as it did not impact its ranking.\n\nFinally, each of these variables was combined as an average percentrank.\n\nBlog categories\n\nAlso on Ticket Gum\n\nIn-Depth Review of the Tottenham vs Man United Match Experience\n\nIn the latest Tottenham vs Man United match, we dive into the game highlights, key moments, and fan experiences.
