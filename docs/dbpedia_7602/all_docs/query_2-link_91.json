        "text": "Simy Nwankwo and Serie A club Salernitana are headed for a contentious summer as tensions escalate between the two parties, Soccernet.ng reports.\n\nNwankwo joined Salernitana on a season-long loan with an obligation to buy from Crotone in August 2021. The club quickly exercised this option, acquiring the full rights to the striker for a fee of €3.5 million on January 9, 2022.\n\nHowever, by the end of that month, Nwankwo was loaned out to Serie B side Parma for the remainder of the season, with an option to buy. His stint at Parma was underwhelming, netting only one goal in 12 league appearances, leading the club to pass on a permanent deal.\n\nThe following season saw Nwankwo loaned to Benevento, where he failed to score in 22 Serie B matches.\n\nReturning to Salernitana last year, he managed three goals in 15 games, but his efforts were insufficient to prevent the club’s relegation from Serie A. Salernitana are now looking to offload the 32-year-old forward.\n\nAccording to Nico Schira, Nwankwo has rejected an offer of €600,000 per season for two years from Iranian club Persepolis, leaving him surplus to requirements at Salernitana.\n\nThis decision poses a significant financial strain on the club as they struggle to find a market for the player.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/FcCrotoneOff/status/1428369571929485322\n\nNwankwo made history as the first African top scorer in an Italian professional league (2019-20 Serie B) and remains Crotone’s all-time top scorer with 66 goals in all competitions."
