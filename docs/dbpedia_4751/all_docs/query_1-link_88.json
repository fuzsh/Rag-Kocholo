        "text": "The $2 billion AirTrain project, which would have connected Midtown Manhattan to LaGuardia Airport, is dropped following a report by an expert panel released Monday that called for improved bus service.\n\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul , who paused the LaGuardia AirTrain project in 2021, embraced the report’s recommendation calling for better bus service in place of the project. She had asked the The Port Authority of New York & New Jersey, the airport’s operator, to study alternative mass transit options to LaGuardia at the time."
