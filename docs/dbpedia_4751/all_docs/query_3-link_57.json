        "text": "PLAY flies to New York Stewart International Airport - Main Terminal. The airport is located in the Hudson Valley, approx. 90 min. away from Times Square and is serviced by taxis, car hires, a train line and the Stewart Airport Express bus route which operates in tandem with PLAY flights and brings passengers to New York City in approx. 75 minutes. Share rides such as Uber and Lyft are also available. More information can be found on Stewart International Airport's official website.\n\nThe Fabulous City of New York\n\nThe Big Apple, the city that never sleeps, New York City, hardly needs introduction. With approx. 9 million inhabitants and nearly 70 million visitors in 2019, this is arguably one of the most happening cities in the world and a mecca for any self-respecting globetrotter. Every street corner feels like a filmset and for first-time visitors, this city feels oddly familiar. That doesn’t make it any less exciting and fabulous though. But instead of waxing on about Central Park and the Statue of Liberty, the amazing museums, first-class restaurants and romantic bookstores, we’re taking a different approach.\n\nOur Approach to the Great State of New York\n\nWe’re offering cheap flights to New York Stewart International Airport, which is quite frankly, a novel approach. It’s a 90-minute bus ride from Times Square, but this small and comfy airport is situated in the southwest of the Hudson Valley, an upstate New York paradise. This area is home to luxury spas, outdoor adventures, scenic boat tours and wonderful ski areas. This is a place of affordable accommodation and beautiful landscapes. It doesn’t hurt that it’s home to the world’s largest Legoland park and Woodbury Common, one of the most popular outlet malls in the United States and of course, just a stone’s throw away from Manhattan.\n\nNew York State has so much to offer whether you enjoy the great outdoors, historic sites, a championship-level shopping spree, Legos, theme parks or the most vibrant and exciting city in the world. Get a cheap flight to upstate New York, travel through a tiny and friendly airport with minimum waiting times and comfortable service, book great accommodation for less, enjoy the great state of New York or grab a bus to Manhattan and play more because you paid much less."
