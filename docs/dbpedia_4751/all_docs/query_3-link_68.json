The wrinkle is that I don't know exactly when I'll be able to leave Boston, so I can't make a reservation.\n\nWhat are the chances I can show up at the airport and get on a flight without a reservation, without a long delay?\n\nDo they still have unlimited-capacity Air-Shuttles where you just walk on?\n\nWill I run into a steep penalty if I do make a reservation, and then have to change it (fly either earlier or later)?\n\nIs there a big discount for reserving in advance, i.e., a penalty for buying a ticket at the airport?\n\nI realize this question is extremely elementary but I'm lacking spoons and I hope y'all can spare a moment and give me some quick answers.\n\nAbout Ask MetaFilter\n\nAsk MetaFilter is a question and answer site that covers nearly any question on earth, where members help each other solve problems.
