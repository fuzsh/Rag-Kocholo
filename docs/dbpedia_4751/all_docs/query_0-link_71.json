        "text": "The Leading New York Airport at a Glance\n\nJohn F. Kennedy International Airport, or JFK Airport, is also known as New York Airport, even though four airports serve in total the city of New York. However, JFK is considered the main and leading airport of the “big apple city”, as well as one of the busiest USA airports. What’s more, it is listed among the most important aviation hubs globally.\n\nOpening its door back in 1948, its initial name was New York International Airport. Still, it was most commonly known as Idlewild Airport after the Idlewild Beach Golf Course, which was completely torn down in order to make way for the new airport. Nevertheless, it received its present-day name in 1963, when the 35th president of the United States, John F. Kennedy, was assassinated. As a tribute to his high-profile political career, the leading airport of New York city was renamed John F. Kennedy International Airport or JFK Airport.\n\nNew York Airport is located in the southeastern area of Queens County, approximately 16 miles (26km) from Manhattan, and belongs to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Welcoming more than 62 million passengers annually, JFK Airport handles flights from all over the world. In fact, it is considered the principal air gate to the entire North American area.\n\nJFK Airport’s Layout\n\nNew York Airport consists of 6 terminals, 131 gates, and 4 runways. Even though the terminals are only 6, terminal buildings 7 and 8 are also to be found, as T3 and T6 were demolished in the past decade. JFK airport’s arrangement resembles a huge “U” shape. However, the in-between terminal transfers are troublesome since the airport shuttles operate landside. Thus, with the exemption of transfers between T2 and T4 for Delta passengers and between T5 and T8 for American-JetBlue clients, to travel from one JFK terminal to another, New York airport passengers have to pass through security control.\n\nThe City of New York\n\nIt’s not just another metropolis. New York is THE metropolis, the cultural, arts, and business center of the world. The “city that never sleeps” is the land of opportunity. The place where everything is possible. And that’s perhaps why it simply mesmerizes its visitors. With the imposing skyscrapers, the idyllic Central Park, and the bustling Times Square, NY is the city of contrast. Verily, the Broadway theaters and the numerous museums coexist with a wild nightlife and a sophisticated gastronomy scene, whereas classy Manhattan gives place to utterly diverse neighborhoods, such as Chinatown, Little Italy, and Harlem. On the other hand, its landmarks (Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn Bridge, etc.) can only be described as iconic. Overall, the city of New York resembles no other. Hence, a journey to New York couldn’t but be simply unforgettable."
