        "text": "There are three major airports serving New York City: John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), LaGuardia Airport (LGA) and Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR). Each has strengths (and weaknesses) regarding location, airlines, destinations served, amenities, services and ground transportation options. This guide will help you decide which airport works best for you when planning your New York City flights.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK)\n\nSprawling John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) is the largest and busiest New York City airport and is where you’ll often catch a connecting flight on an international trip. From its location in Queens, about 15 miles southeast of Midtown Manhattan, the airport serves more than 60 million passengers annually with 5 terminals – 1, 4, 5, 7 and 8 –, 130 gates, 70 domestic and international airlines and flights to and from about 200 destinations. A major renovation project underway promises upgraded facilities airport wide, a new Terminal 6 by 2028 and a new Terminal 1 by 2030.\n\nAirlines serving JFK Airport\n\n70 airlines fly to and from John F. Kennedy International Airport. Here are some of the key airlines in each terminal.\n\nTerminal 1 airlines include Air France, Air New Zealand, Asiana Airlines, Korean Air, Lufthansa, SWISS, Turkish Airlines and others.\n\nTerminal 4 is home to Delta Air Lines, El Al, Emirates, Hawaiian Airlines, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Virgin Atlantic and others. Jet Blue’s late night (10:30 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.) international arrivals park at Terminal 4 as well.\n\nTerminal 5 serves all departing Jet Blue flights as well as flights for Cape Air.\n\nTerminal 7 airlines include Aer Lingus, Air Canada, Alaska, ANA (All Nippon), Condor, Icelandair, SAS, Sun Country and others.\n\nAnd Terminal 8 is home to flights for American Airlines, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Finnair, Level, Qantas, Qatar Airways and others.\n\nWhere to eat, shop and relax at JFK Airport\n\nYou will find a variety of shops, food courts, sit-down dining options and services in each terminal. Venues and operating hours can change, so it’s always a good idea to consult JFK’s terminal-specific directory before you travel, especially if you’re flying with pets, traveling with kids, or have a special need.\n\nDining spots popular with travelers at JFK Airport include Eat & Go Istanbul and Taste NY in Terminal 1; the Palm Bar & Grill, Shake Shack and Blue Point Brewery in Terminal 4; and Deep Blue Sushi, La Vie (Mediterranean) and AeroNuova (Italian) in Terminal 5. True Burger is popular in Terminal 7 while Terminal 8 has New York Deli and Bobby Van’s Grill.\n\nShopping highlights at JFK Airport include Coach, Mont Blanc and Michael Kors in Terminal 1; Kate Spade, LEGO and Pandora in Terminal 4; and Brighton Collectibles and Ron Jon Surf Shop in Terminal 5. There’s a Kiehl’s (cosmetics & skin scare) in Terminal 7 and, in Terminal 8, Bulgari, Michael Kors and Tag Huer/Mont Blanc shops.\n\nUnique services and amenities to seek out at JFK include Minute Suites (short-stay nap/work/relax rooms) in Terminal 4 and the post-security outdoor rooftop terrace in JetBlue’s Terminal 5 that doubles as a “Wooftop” pet relief station. There are also about 20 lounges.\n\nTraveling between JFK and New York City\n\nThe easiest, but most expensive, way to travel between JFK and New York City is by taxi, Uber or Lyft. NYC taxis charge a $70 flat rate, plus tolls, tips, and a variety of surcharges for rides to and from Manhattan. Taxi stands are located outside the arrivals area of each terminal. Uber and Lyft services are also available to and from JFK, but keep in mind that rates fluctuate by demand and can often end up costing more than taxis. A handful of shared shuttle van companies also serve JFK.\n\nIt will be less expensive to travel between JFK and Manhattan by subway or train, but the journey will take a bit longer. JFK’s AirTrain, which you can ride free between terminals, connects to NYC’s public subway, rail and bus network at Jamaica and Howard Beach Stations. The AirTrain ride to those stations is $8.25 and a subway ride from there into the city costs an additional $2.90.\n\nFrom the Jamaica Station, you can also take the Long Island Railroad (LIRR) to the Grand Central Madison Station or to Penn Station in Manhattan. JFK’s ground transportation page or the staff at the Port Authority Welcome Center in arrivals can help with more details and fares.\n\nLaGuardia Airport (LGA)\n\nLaGuardia Airport (LGA), like JFK Airport, is also located in Queens but is about 8 miles from Manhattan and is the closest airport to Manhattan. The area’s third busiest airport serves more than 30 million passengers a year from 3 terminals: A (also known as the Marine Terminal, or MAT), B, and C.\n\nBuilt on the former site of an amusement park, the airport was named for three-term New York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia in 1947. Long belittled and berated for having crowded and outdated facilities, a major makeover delivered a revamped Terminal B and a brand-new Terminal C, both filled with art and plenty of modern amenities.\n\nAirlines serving New York’s LaGuardia Airport (LGA)\n\nEight airlines operate from New York’s LaGuardia Airport (LGA). Together they offer direct flights to almost 90 destinations. Most are domestic flights, but there are also flights from LGA to destinations in Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean.\n\nHead to Terminal A (the Marine Terminal) for flights on Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines.\n\nFlights on Air Canada, American, JetBlue, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines operate from Terminal B. Delta/Delta Shuttle flights are in Terminal C.\n\nWhere to eat, shop and relax at New York’s LaGuardia Airport\n\nTerminal A, also known as the Marine Air Terminal (MAT), is a charming Art Deco building that served as seaplane terminal for Pan Am Airways’ “flying boats” in the 1940s. The building’s rotunda sports James Brooks’ WPA-era mural “Flight.” Post-security amenities in Terminal A include a Cibo Express (snacks and gifts) and Salotto (Italian cuisine).\n\nThe wide range of dining options in Terminal B include Brooklyn Diner, Dos Toros Taqueria, Hill Country (Texas-style BBQ), Hunt and Fish (steak and seafood) and Shake Shack. Shops include FAO Schwartz, McNally Jackson Books, The Bowery Bay Shops and The Dean, a men’s shop.\n\nTerminal B amenities include a Be Relax spa, two kids play areas (one airport-themed and one NYC-themed), indoor green space with plants and benches, site-specific art installations, and multiple airline and membership lounges.\n\nThe water feature in Terminal B puts on great themed shows with choreographed lighting, video projection, music and 4,000 gallons of recirculated water.\n\nDining options in the multi-concourse Delta Air Lines’ terminal include Bubby’s, Chuko Ramen, Essex Burger, Flatiron Tavern & Provisions, and many others. Shops include Beekman 1802 (skincare), Le Labo (fragrances) and Briggs & Riley (luggage). Terminal C also has a sensory room, a wide array of public art, and the largest Delta Sky Club in the system.\n\nTraveling between LGA to New York City\n\nThe easiest, but most expensive way to travel between LaGuardia Airport and New York City is by taxi or rideshare services such as Uber or Lyft. Taxi fares will run $35 to $45 (more during rush hour), plus taxes and tip. Uber and Lyft rates also spike by demand.\n\nThere are a variety of public transportation options between LaGuardia Airport and New York City. If you are headed to destinations in Uptown Manhattan, the M60-SBS bus (Fare: $2.90) leaves from LaGuardia Terminals A, B and C and connects to numerous subway lines along 125th Street.\n\nFor Midtown Manhattan destinations, use the free LaGuardia Link Q70, which leaves from Terminals B and C and travels to the Jackson Heights, Queens station. From there you can connect to various subways lines (Fare $2.90), or the Woodside stop, where you can board a Long Island Railroad (LIRR) train that stops at Penn Station and Grand Central.\n\nFiguring out your best public transportation option be daunting, but both the MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) website and the LGA website have helpful and detailed fare and route information for using inexpensive public transportation between LGA and New York City. There are also staffed information desks at the arrivals level.\n\nNewark Liberty International Airport (EWR)\n\nLocated about 16 miles from Manhattan, in New Jersey, Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) is the third major airport for the New York City area. The airport serves more than 49 million passengers a year from three terminals – A, B and C – which are connected by the AirTrain. A major hub for United Airlines, the airport’s name was changed from Newark International Airport to Newark Liberty International Airport in 2002.\n\nAirlines serving EWR\n\nMore than 30 airlines serve Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), flying to domestic and international destinations.\n\nTerminal A airlines include Air Canada, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, and United Airlines.\n\nAirlines operating out of Terminal B include Aer Lingus, Air France, Air India, Alaska Airlines, Allegiant, Austrian Airlines, British Airways, El Al, Emirates, Frenchbee, Icelandair, JetBlue (international arrivals), Lufthansa, Porter, Scandinavian, Singapore Airlines, Sun Country, Spirit, Turkish Airlines, and United Airlines (international arrivals) and others.\n\nTerminal C is the main terminal for United Airlines at EWR.\n\nWhere to eat, shop and relax at EWR\n\nDining and snacking highlights in the recently redeveloped Terminal A at EWR include the Office Tavern Grill, Bang Cookies, Playa Bowls, Beechers, Carlito’s BBB Taqueria, Tonnie’s Minis (cupcakes in a cup!), Smokehouse BBQ and others.\n\nIn addition to airline/membership lounges, amenities in Terminal A include a Be Relax spa and a sensory room.\n\nShops and dining options in Terminal B at EWR are on three post-security concourses, or satellites, and the pre-security connector. Pre-security options include Smashburger and the Budweiser Brewhouse. On B1, there’s Malone’s Fish Market, Sora Japanese Cuisine & Sushi Bar and a few other options. Unusual Times is on the B2 satellite.\n\nAnd B3 is home to StrEAT Market, Piattino (pizza/bistro), and a Vino Volo. In addition to branded vending machines, kiosks and small shops offering candy, electronics, accessories and duty-free items, including a Wired shop in the B2 satellite and a Lick candy in B3.\n\nThere are at least five airline and membership lounges in Terminal B.\n\nThere are three concourses and 58 gates in United Airlines’ Terminal C at EWR airport, with a wide variety of shopping and dining options.\n\nConcourse 1 (C70-C99) dining choices abound with restaurants that include Abruzzo Italian Steakhouse, Daily (farm-to-table), Little Purse (dumplings), and the dizzying Global Bazaar food hall where the choices include noodles, burgers, sushi, and pastries and chocolates made on-site at Melange Bakery Café and Chocolatier.\n\nConcourse 2 (C101 -C115) has Garden State Diner, Happy Clam, Little Purse, Proof Whiskey Bar, Vanguard Kitchen and other dining choices.\n\nAnd good bets in Concourse 3 (C120-C138) include Caps Beer Garden, Flora Café, Saison (French) and Classified, United’s invitation-only ‘secret’ restaurant tucked behind Saison.\n\nShop for gifts, necessities and accessories at Cibo Markets, Coach, Hudson Booksellers, InMotion Entertainment, Johnston & Murphy, Tumi and other outlets. United Airlines has multiple lounges in Terminal C.\n\nGetting to and from EWR\n\nThe easiest, but most expensive, way to travel between EWR and New York is by taxi, shared van or rideshare service. Taxi fares to the city will run $60 to $80, not including taxes, surcharges and tips. An easy option is the Coach USA New Airport express bus, which stops at each terminal and at Penn Station, Grand Central Station and Bryant Park in New York. (Fare: $18.70); discount for roundtrip. The AirTrain also connects to NJ Transit, PATH and Amtrak trains at the Newark Liberty International Airport Station for destinations in New York, Newark, and elsewhere.\n\nWhat is the closest airport to Manhattan?\n\nAt about 8 miles, LaGuardia Airport (LGA) is the closest airport to Manhattan. John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) is about 15 miles from Manhattan and Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) is about 16 miles from Manhattan.\n\nBest New York Airport to fly into\n\nWhich airport you choose can depend on a variety of factors, including available routes and fares from your city, the airlines you like to fly, the time of day you want to arrive, which part of the city you’ll be staying in and how you plan to get to the city.\n\nJFK for example, has the most nonstop flight options but it can be a long and expensive taxi ride into town, while the Express Bus from Newark Liberty International Airport makes it a breeze to get downtown Manhattan, if you plan your arrival just right.\n\nHow this guide was created\n\nI am a veteran travel journalist and one of those odd people who really loves spending time in airports, which I consider modern-day crossroads where so much of the drama, drudge, hope and excitement of the journey is on display. This guide draws on knowledge and skills accrued from years of documenting airport operations and amenities, and from many trips to and through the New York City airports."
