        "text": "The favored model of the American airline industry since its deregulation in 1978, airport hubs have formed the backbone of the country’s present-day aviation network and marketplace. Nowadays these hub-and-spoke systems have become ubiquitous in the U.S. travel sphere, replacing most previous point-to-point models offered by airlines.\n\nBy providing greater efficiency and profitability, the hub system seems here to stay, so lets took a look at how this transportation model can benefit both the airline and the passengers they carry.\n\nWhy Hubs Matter for Passengers\n\nIn a perfect world, every flight would be nonstop, and you'd be jetting off to your destination without any extended connection times or roundabout routings. But in that perfect world, your airfare would likely cost triple.\n\nSo why do hubs matter for passengers? The almighty dollar. If airlines can reduce costs by running an efficient hub-and-spoke system, they can, in theory, pass along the savings to the customer. While airport connections aren’t always ideal, hubs allow for carriers to provide more extensive route networks, streamlined operations, and lower fares.\n\nAnd those low fares come in several forms.\n\nSome of the best-unadvertised savings in the entire aviation marketplace come in the form of hub attacks by competing airlines. These fare wars often instigated by rival carriers trying to undercut prices on select routes from a competitor hub airport, sometimes to the tune of hundreds of dollars.\n\nAs an example, Delta might try to drum up sales in a market such as Houston (IAH) that are traditionally dominated by United Airlines by listing fares to destinations in say, Europe or Hawaii, for half the going price. By instigating a fare war, Delta can cut into United’s hub profits and sway customers who are generally handcuffed to United’s monopolized airfares to try their product instead.\n\nThese so-called fare wars often escalate quickly with multiple airlines getting in on the action targeting rivals’ hometown hubs across the country. By knowing which hub is nearest to you and which airlines tend to undercut prices when a fare war kicks up might be key in grabbing a rock-bottom fare during one of these short-lived unadvertised sales and save big.\n\nWhy Hubs Matter for Airlines\n\nConsolidated route networks play a big part in how airlines can shed overhead on their overall operational costs. Hubs allow airlines to funnel feeder flights with lower passenger volumes through strategically placed airports without having to allot larger aircraft on less popular city-to-city pairings. Thus, adjusting for the total number of travelers on routes and reducing empty seats – the bane of every carrier’s bottom line.\n\nFor example, instead of offering a nonstop point-to-point option between two smaller cities like Des Moines (DSM) and Dayton (DAY) that would more than likely fly half empty, these two markets connect through a midway hub like Detroit (DTW) or Chicago (ORD). This allows the airline to better utilize its aircraft and corral passengers between the two points at a profitable schedule while reducing its risk of low passenger loads.\n\nHubs also provide airlines with a centralized work base for employees, allow for more timely mechanical fixes, and provide additional options for aircraft swaps or adjustments, all of which significantly reduce operating costs compared to a point-to-point system.\n\nRelated: The Best and Worst Airlines for 2021\n\nA List of Airport Hubs Across America\n\nThe following is a list of major U.S.-based carriers and the location of their airport hubs cities.\n\n(Red dots indicate hubs – Yellow for focus cities)\n\nAlaska Airlines\n\nFocused on West Coast markets, Alaska Airlines operates five hubs with its primary hub and headquarters located at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport (SEA). Focus cities of San Diego (SAN) and San Jose (SJC) round out the carrier’s prodigious Pacific Coast presence.\n\nHubs\n\nSeattle/Tacoma (SEA) – Primary Hub\n\nAnchorage (ANC)\n\nLos Angeles (LAX)\n\nPortland (PDX)\n\nSan Francisco (SFO)\n\nFocus Cities\n\nSan Diego (SAN)\n\nSan Jose (SJC)\n\nAmerican Airlines\n\nAs the world's largest airline, American routes its nearly 200,000,000+ annual passengers through its ten major U.S. hubs. Following its merger with US Airways in 2013, American added Phoenix (PHX), Philadelphia (PHL), Washington DC (DCA), and Charlotte (CLT) to its roster of hub airports. While unofficial, Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) is considered the airline’s primary hub and home to the company’s global headquarters.\n\nHubs\n\nDallas/Fort Worth (DFW) – Primary Hub\n\nCharlotte (CLT)\n\nChicago–O’Hare (ORD)\n\nLos Angeles (LAX)\n\nMiami (MIA)\n\nNew York–Kennedy (JFK)\n\nNew York–LaGuardia (LGA)\n\nPhiladelphia (PHL)\n\nPhoenix (PHX)\n\nWashington DC–National (DCA)\n\nRelated: American Airlines 777-300ER Business Class Review\n\nDelta Air Lines\n\nConsidered to be the first mega-hub in America, Atlanta’s Hartsfield–Jackson International Airport (ATL) is also the world’s busiest and the primary hub for hometown Delta Air Lines. After finalizing its merger with Northwest Airlines in 2010, Delta inherited hubs at Minneapolis (MSP) and Detroit (DTW) and upgraded its presence in Boston (SEA) in 2019 bringing its total hub count to nine.\n\nHubs\n\nAtlanta (ATL) - Primary Hub\n\nBoston (BOS)\n\nDetroit (DTW)\n\nLos Angeles (LAX)\n\nMinneapolis/Saint Paul (MSP)\n\nNew York–Kennedy (JFK)\n\nNew York–LaGuardia (LGA)\n\nSalt Lake City (SLC)\n\nSeattle/Tacoma (SEA)\n\nFocus Cities\n\nRaleigh/Durham (RDU)\n\nUnited Airlines\n\nChicago-based United Airlines operates a total of seven hubs in the States, including its prime base at hometown O'Hare (ORD) airport. Its merger with Continental Airlines in 2010 has resulted in the addition of Newark (EWR) and Houston-Intercontinental (IAH) to its roster of hub airports. Cleveland Hopkins International (CLE) a former Continental hub has been disbanded by United in favor of increased service at other regional airports.\n\nHubs\n\nChicago–O’Hare (ORD) - Primary Hub\n\nDenver (DEN)\n\nHouston–Intercontinental (IAH)\n\nLos Angeles (LAX)\n\nNewark (EWR)\n\nSan Francisco (SFO)\n\nWashington DC–Dulles (IAD)\n\nRelated: The 15 Most Exciting New Airline Routes for 2022\n\nHawaiian Airlines\n\nHonolulu-based Hawaiian Airlines operates two hubs in the 50th state – its headquarters at Daniel K. Inouye/Honolulu International Airport (HNL) and its secondary outpost on the island of Maui at Kahului Airport (OGG). Kona International Airport (KOA) and Lihue Airport (LIH) serve as focus cities for the airline.\n\nHubs\n\nHonolulu–Oahu (HNL) - Primary Hub\n\nKahului–Maui (OGG)\n\nFocus Cities\n\nKona–Big Island (KOA)\n\nLihue–Kauai (LIH)\n\nFrontier\n\nFrontier Airlines forgoes maintaining multiple hubs across its network and relies on a patchwork of focus cities to connect its low-cost customers to their destinations. The budget carrier supports a solitary hub at Denver International Airport (DEN) of which most of its West Coast connections route through. On East Coast operations, Frontier tends to lean toward a point-to-point model but often routes passengers through one of its nine focus airports.\n\nHubs\n\nDenver (DEN) – Operating Base\n\nFocus Cities\n\nAtlanta (ATL)\n\nChicago–O’Hare (ORD)\n\nCleveland (CLE)\n\nLas Vegas (LAS)\n\nMiami (MIA)\n\nOrlando (MCO)\n\nTampa (TPA)\n\nPhiladelphia (PHL)\n\nTrenton (TTN)\n\nRelated: Is Frontier’s New High Cost Airport Fee a Scam?\n\nSun Country Airlines\n\nUltra low-cost carrier Sun Country’s route network is primarily connected through its sole hub at Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport (MSP). Over the last several years the airline has rapidly expanded its route network outside the confines of its Minnesota hub by adding focus airports at Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) and Las Vegas (LAS).\n\nHubs\n\nMinneapolis/Saint Paul (MSP) – Primary Hub\n\nFocus Cities\n\nDallas/Fort Worth (DFW)\n\nLas Vegas (LAS)\n\nRelated: How to Find the Cheapest Flight for Your Next Trip\n\nAirlines With Operating Bases and Focus Cities Instead of Hubs\n\nNot all airlines rely on the hub-and-spoke system; many provide point-to-point networks to route passengers on strategically chosen flight paths to compete with legacy carriers.\n\nJetBlue\n\nNew York-based JetBlue prefers to maintain a single operating base at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK) instead of proclaiming a primary hub. The airline's low-cost model is heavily reliant on nonstop point-to-point offerings rather than funneling its passenger through the more common hub system. With focus airports in five other cities like Boston (BOS), Orlando (MCO), Ft.
