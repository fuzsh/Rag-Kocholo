        "text": "Flying into New York City is an exciting but sometimes confusing voyage. The New York metro area has three major airports, as well as several smaller airports, and various airline options, public transit options and connections between all of them. Depending on where you’re looking to end up in New York City, how much you want to spend and what types of flexibility or amenities you’re looking for, you can decide between the city’s two international airports, LaGuardia International Airport (LGA) or John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), both in Queens, or Newark International Airport (EWR) in Newark, New Jersey. Here’s how to choose.\n\nInternational Airports In And Around NYC\n\nNew York’s three major airports include LaGuardia International Airport (LGA) or John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), and Newark International Airport (EWR). Several smaller airports operate in the surrounding mento area, including the suburban Westchester County Airport (HPN) - home to Bark Air!- and Teterboro Airport (TEB) in suburban New Jersey. New York Stewart International Airport (SWF) in the Hudson Valley is another option for international flights.\n\nWhen To Fly Into LGA\n\nLaGuardia is located in East Elmhurst Queens, and just minutes away from communities in Flushing, Astoria, and Jackson Heights. If you’re staying in Queens, LaGuardia can be a great option. LGA is notoriously not connected to the city by subway, but offers several public buses, as well as rideshare pickups, to get into Manhattan and the outer boroughs. If you’re staying in Harlem or the Upper West Side, the Q60 also operates direct bus service. LGA is a hub for Delta Air Lines and American Airlines.\n\nWhen To Fly Into JFK\n\nJohn F Kennedy airport is an easy commute to and from Queens, Brooklyn, and Long Island. The airport connects to the Long Island Railroad (LIRR) and the MTA subway, so you can really get anywhere from this airport. JFK is also larger than LGA and offers several more airlines and flights, so you may find more flexibility flying through JFK, which is known as New York’s busiest airport. Travelers can also commute to Manhattan via Blade helicopter to and from JFK.\n\nJFK is also home to the retro-inspired TWA Hotel, which is great for layovers, late arrivals, or early departures. JFK is a hub for American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and JetBlue, which has its own terminal, T5, offering an outdoor dog run, and more amenities.\n\nWhen To Fly Into EWR\n\nNewark airport is in New Jersey, so if you’re ending up in New Jersey or Pennsylvania, this airport is certainly your best bet. It’s also closest to Midtown and Lower Manhattan via NJ Transit or by car. Commuting to EWR from Brooklyn or Queens can be tedious and expensive by car, but sometimes it’s the best options for flight times or specific airlines. Travelers can also commute to Manhattan via Blade helicopter to and from EWR.\n\nEWR is a major hub for United Airlines."
