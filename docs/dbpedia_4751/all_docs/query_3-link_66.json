        "text": "Here's a breakdown of your options for getting to the airport via public transportation.\n\nIf youâ€™re coming from...\n\nUptown Manhattan: Take the M60 bus all the way.\n\nMidtown Manhattan: You have a few options: You can take the subway or the Long Island Rail Road to Queens, then the free LaGuardia Link Q70 bus. The subway fare is $2.90, but it may take a bit longer; LIRR fares vary, but may be a shorter trip.\n\nTips\n\nAllow plenty of time. Depending on your route and what traffic is like, your trip could take up to an hour or more.\n\nPay Select Bus Service fare before you board. Use a sidewalk kiosk near the bus stop to get a receipt as proof of payment. Pay using OMNY, a MetroCard, or with exact change in coins.\n\nLaGuardia Link Q70 bus service is free.\n\nTransfers from the subway to the bus are free for two hours. You still have to get a receipt from a kiosk for Select Bus Service, but you won't be charged.\n\nKeep bus aisles and seats clear. Stow your bags on luggage racks if you can.\n\nOption 1: Take the M60 Select Bus from uptown Manhattan\n\nFare: $2.90 for most riders.\n\n1.

Stay on the M60 bus until you get to LaGuardia.\n\nThe M60 stops at every airport terminal.\n\nRemember to pay the Select Bus fare before you board.\n\nOption 2: Take the subway to Queens and then take the LaGuardia Link Q70 bus.\n\n1. Take the E, F, M, R to Jackson Heights-Roosevelt Avenue, or the 7 to 74 St-Broadway.\n\nFollow signs for the Q70 bus. (You can also look for the yellow airplane icon.)\n\nExit the turnstiles and walk straight through the doors to the bus lanes. You can board an airport-bound Q70 bus there.\n\n2. Take the Q70 toward LaGuardia airport.\n\nThe Q70 stops at airport terminals C and B.

The easiest way to buy them is from a ticket machine at Penn Station or on your phone, with the TrainTime app.\n\n2.
