Designed for busy business travelers, AA shuttle flights allow passengers to check in up to 20 minutes before departure if you aren't carrying checked baggage and up to 30 minutes before departure when you check bags. Also, there will be dedicated check-in desks and dedicated gates, so you'll know exactly where to go in the airport.\n\nShuttle services also offer the following enhanced amenities:\n\nFree snack basket, beer, wine and spirits in First Class\n\nFree snacks, beer and wine in Main Cabin\n\nFree magazines and newspapers in the boarding lounge\n\nThis expands on American Airlines' east coast shuttle service, which now includes flights between Washington National (DCA) — NYC's LaGuardia (LGA), Washington National (DCA) — Boston (BOS), and Boston (BOS) — NYC's LaGuardia (LGA):\n\nNew Domestic Routes\n\nAmerican Airlines is also announcing new service on domestic nonstop routes, including:\n\nThree routes from Philadelphia (PHL) to Fort Wayne, Indiana (FWA); Oklahoma City (OKC); and Pensacola, Florida (PNS)\n\nNew service from both Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT) and Dallas (DFW) to Panama City, Florida (ECP) and South Bend, Indiana (SBN)\n\nService from Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD) to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, Pennsylvania (AVP)\n\nThese routes will be loaded into American Airlines' network on January 22, but travelers are going to have to wait until June 7 for flights to begin.\n\nWith this new announcement and previous route expansion announcements, American Airlines is adding 52 new nonstop routes from its hubs in 2018:\n\nhttps://player.vimeo.com/video/251639732"
