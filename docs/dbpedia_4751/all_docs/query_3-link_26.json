        "text": "LaGuardia Airport (LGA) has undergone a complete rebuild over the last several years which has seen the old, outdated facility of yesteryear replaced with a brand-new, state-of-the-art facility with modern terminals and facilities.\n\nWith a cost of about $8 billion, this massive project has transformed one of the countryâs most-loathed airports into one of the very best. The new airport also brings with it more capacity for air service, faster security screening times for passengers, and enhanced bus service to and from the airport (though the city recently killed off the proposed AirTrain link).\n\nSo, now that the airportâs totally new, letâs review how you can get between the various terminals at LaGuardia.\n\nLaGuardia Airport Layout\n\nThere are 3 terminals at LaGuardia Airport â A, B, and C. Theyâre not connected to each other, so passengers must ride the airport shuttle bus if they have flights in different terminals.\n\nTerminals B and C are located near each other, while Terminal A is around a mile away from both B and C. The terminal shuttle bus (covered later in this article) is the best way to get between terminals at LGA. It also stops at the parking lots and the car rental transfer point.\n\nPre-security (Landside) Ground Transportation at LGA\n\nTerminal Shuttle Bus\n\nLaGuardia Link buses operate 24 hours a day, arriving every 8 to 10 minutes at peak times and every 15 minutes during off-peak times.\n\nThe shuttle buses are GPS monitored, so you can use LaGuardiaâs handy tracker to see live bus arrival times. Select your stop to check when the next bus is scheduled to arrive.\n\nPost-security (Airside) Ground Transportation at LGA\n\nWalkways\n\nNone of the terminals at LaGuardia are connected to each other, so itâs not possible to walk between them if you have to connect to a flight in another terminal. However, with central security checkpoints in all of the terminals, passengers can walk between the various concourses inside the terminals without needing to clear security again.\n\nLGA Terminal Layout\n\nLGA Terminal A (Marine Air Terminal)\n\nTerminal A, also known as the Marine Air Terminal, was LGAâs original terminal for seaplane flights during the 1930s and 1940s. The original building â including the Art Deco rotunda â still stands, now with a connecting concourse area for flight departures.\n\nThe terminal has 6 gates numbered A1 to A6 with arrivals and departures on the same level and just a few shops and restaurants. JetBlue is the only airline to operate flights from Terminal A.\n\nGround transportation services are located outside of the rotunda, along with the only pick-up and drop-off point for shuttle buses to the car rental lots.\n\nLGA Terminal B\n\nTerminal B is centrally located on airport property and is home to Air Canada, American Airlines, JetBlue, Southwest, and United Airlines. Facilities in the main terminal span 4 levels.\n\nLevel 1: Ground Transportation\n\nPassengers may access ground transportation services on level 1, including the MTA bus and car rental shuttles.\n\nLevel 2: Baggage Claim\n\nBaggage claim is located on level 2, along with the lost and found office and a welcome center. Taxis are available at the east side of the arrivals curb.\n\nLevel 3: Check-in and Security\n\nCheck-in and the security checkpoint are located on level 3.\n\nLevel 4: Restaurants and Shops\n\nLevel 4 has a good selection of shops and restaurants that are located after clearing the security checkpoint. Thereâs also a large water feature in the center of the concessions area and an American Express Centurion Lounge.\n\nConcourse A\n\nConcourse A has 19 gates numbered 11, 12, 14 to 20, and 22-31.

The main terminal building is bright and spacious, with floor-to-ceiling windows and impressive architectural features. Facilities are located across 4 floors before passengers move through to the departures area with 4 interlinked concourses.\n\nLevel 1: Baggage Claim\n\nBaggage claim is located on level 1, with a welcome center, Starbucks, and a small convenience store.\n\nLevel 2: Check-in\n\nThe ticketing and check-in desks for Delta Air Lines and WestJet are located on level 2.\n\nLevel 3: Security Checkpoint\n\nThe security checkpoint is located on level 3, along with a small selection of shops, a Starbucks, and a pet relief area.\n\nLevel 4: Delta Sky Club\n\nThereâs a large Delta Sky Club on Level 4 after clearing security.\n\nConcourse A\n\nConcourse A has 11 gates numbered 60, 60A, and 61 to 69. Once clearing security, turn left and walk along the corridor (with moving walkways), take the escalator down, and continue to follow the corridor into the concourse. From security, the furthest gate is around a 10-minute walk. Thereâs a food court at the entrance to the concourse and several shops.\n\nConcourse B\n\nConcourse B has 9 gates numbered 70 and 72 to 78 and is a short walk turning left out of the security checkpoint.

Itâs easy to reach Concourse D from the security checkpoint by walking for 5 minutes and then taking the escalator down 1 level. Walking to the furthest gate takes an additional 5 minutes.\n\nA small food court is located at the entrance of the concourse, and there are a couple of convenience stores.\n\nEstimated Walking Times Between Terminals\n\nItâs not possible to walk between any of the terminals at LaGuardia Airport, so passengers must ride the terminal shuttle bus.\n\nEstimated Walking Times to Gates\n\nTerminal A: 2 minutes to all gates\n\nTerminal B:\n\nGates 11 to 31: 4 to 6 minutes\n\nGates 40 to 59: 6 to 10 minutes\n\nTerminal C:\n\nGates 60 to 69: 9 to 11 minutes\n\nGates 70 to 79: 5 to 7 minutes\n\nGates 80 to 89: 8 to 10 minutes\n\nGates 90 to 99: 5 to 10 minutes\n\nFlight Connections at LGA\n\nIf you have a connection on a different airline, youâll need to allow plenty of time to ride the terminal shuttle bus in case traffic is heavy.\n\nBut, if your connection is operated by the same airline, you wonât need to exit the terminal you arrived in to make your connection.\n\nRegardless of the terminal, if checked luggage isnât tagged through to the final destination, passengers will need to reclaim their bags, check-in, and re-clear security anyway.\n\nAccessibility\n\nLGAâs terminals are all accessible to passengers with disabilities or mobility concerns. The terminal shuttle buses are accessible to wheelchair users and the airport parking lots have dedicated parking spaces close to the terminal entrances.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nLaGuardia Airport has notched a dramatic turnaround in recent years. From being one of the worse to being one of the best in the country, travelers have been raving about the new facilities and faster security process. The redevelopment of the airport will continue to make the travel experience better for the 30 million or so passengers that pass through LGA each year.\n\nHowever, if you find yourself needing to move between terminals at LGA, make sure you leave yourself plenty of time because the airport still lacks a train system for getting between terminals as well as a direct connection to New Yorkâs transit system."
