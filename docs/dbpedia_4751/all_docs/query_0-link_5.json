        "text": "LaGuardia Airport (LGA) operates domestic flights to the East Coast and central areas of North America with a longstanding maximum flight radius of up to 1,500 miles for LGA flights, excluding Denver (DEN) and Saturday flights.\n\nLGA is the busiest U.S. airport (for passenger numbers) without a direct route to Europe. Itâs been criticized for its outdated facilities, but after half a decade of redevelopment, LGAâs new Terminal C and revamped Terminal B offer a more streamlined passenger experience with spacious and modern amenities.\n\nAs a domestic hub for Delta Air Lines, the airline was a significant contributor to LGAâs expansion project.\n\nQuick Information\n\nAirport: LaGuardia Airport (LGA)\n\nTerminals: 3 total, including A, B, and C\n\nAirport Address: LaGuardia Road and 94th Street, Queens, NY 11371\n\nDistance from Manhattan: 8 miles (13 km)\n\nWebsite: laguardiaairport.com\n\nPhone Number: 718-533-3400\n\nDestinations Served: 86\n\nFlight Information: Departures and arrival information can be viewed online\n\nLGA Terminal Map\n\nAirlines Operating From LGA\n\nTerminal A\n\nFrontier Airlines\n\nSpirit Airlines\n\nTerminal B\n\nTerminal C\n\nLGA Airport Terminals\n\nLaGuardia Airport has 3 terminals â A, B, and C â that are not linked to each other, so passengers must ride the airport shuttle bus should they need to travel between terminals.\n\nThe Grand Central Parkway runs along the south of the airport, so if youâre traveling to LGA by car, you can access your required terminal easily by taking the signposted road system from the parkway.\n\nEach terminal has parking facilities close by and car rental facilities are mostly south of the Grand Central Parkway, accessible by shuttle bus.\n\nTerminal A\n\nTerminal A is also known as the Marine Air Terminal, as it was initially built to manage seaplane operations. Terminal A is located on the west side of the airport and is occupied by Frontier and Spirit.\n\nDepartures is accessible from the circular art deco rotunda that leads through to the check-in area. The departure concourse has 6 gates numbered A1 to A6 with arrivals located on the same level as departures.\n\nTerminal B\n\nTerminal B is in the central area of the airport and has 2 concourses. Terminal B recently underwent a major redevelopment and its new departure and arrivals areas were unveiled in June 2020. The terminal now consists of 4 levels, including a new concessions level with shops and restaurants.\n\nLevel 2 â Baggage Claim\n\nThe baggage claim carousels can be found on level 2, along with a welcome center and shop. Passengers can be picked up curbside, and a taxi rank is located on this level for on-demand taxi services. Passengers can access the walkway to the Terminal B parking garage from the west end of the terminal.\n\nLevel 3 â Ticketing and Check-In\n\nAirline ticketing and check-in desks are located on level 3, and the security checkpoint is just beyond the ticketing desks, providing access to the departure concourses.\n\nLevel 4 â Shops and Restaurants\n\nPost-security, an escalator takes passengers up to level 4, where there are quick- and full-service dining options and shopping.\n\nOther amenities include a meditation room, nursing room, and pet relief area.\n\nPassengers can access the eastern and western concourses by walking across the concourse bridges from this level.\n\nEastern Concourse\n\nThe Eastern Concourse is a newly developed concourse with 19 gates numbered 40 to 49 and 51 to 57. Thereâs a good selection of shops and restaurants, including LGA Duty-Free and Shake Shack. An Admiralâs Club is located on the upper level and a childrenâs play area is on the lower level entering the concourse.\n\nGates 11 to 31\n\nGates 11 to 31 are located at the northern end of Terminal B and passengers can reach the concourse from level 4 of the terminal. Air Canada, American Airlines, JetBlue, Southwest, and United Airlines operate flights from the 19 gates, numbered 11, 12, 14 and 20, and 22 and 31.
