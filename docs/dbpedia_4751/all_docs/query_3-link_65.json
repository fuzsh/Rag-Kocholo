        "text": "Please allow plenty of time for unexpected traffic delays, airport check-in, and security procedures. Estimated times are exactly that. Traffic is especially unpredictable getting into the airports and is beyond our control.\n\nReservations are required for all travel to La Guardia Airport from all locations in Connecticut and Westchester. The first vans of the day arrive into La Guardia at approximately 5:45am every day subject to travel conditions and at least once per hour after that. When booking your reservation you will be provided an estimated pickup time. Please allow us up to 15 minutes after the estimated time to allow for other pickups in the area or possible unanticipated traffic delays. All our vehicles are tracked with GPS so you can contact us at anytime for an update if you wish.\n\nPlease switch on your mobile phone after landing so we can communicate with you and provide estimated pickup time and location and driver details. If the mobile phone does not work on the US cellular system we will try to make contact on WhatsApp. Please collect any checked luggage and proceed to the Ground Transportation Welcome Center inside the terminal. If you are “ready to go” and have not heard from us on your mobile phone please dial 27 from the courtesy telephones at the Welcome Center for GO Prime Time Shuttle.\n\nShuttles operate at random intervals from approximately 7:30am to 9:30pm at La Guardia when available. Average waiting time for our Shuttle service is currently 30 to 40 minutes once “ready to go” at the Welcome Center. Wait time is not measured from Landing or Gate Arrival time. When possible anticipated schedule changes will be communicated the day before travel to the mobile phone or the email address provided for the traveling passenger(s)."
