        "text": "There are currently no International Flights into LaGuardia (LGA) with the exception of Air Canada flights from Toronto and Montreal. Custom clearance for those flights is done before departing Canada. For international travelers arriving at JFK or EWR who then have connecting flights at LGA, they are required to collect baggage after immigration, clear customs and exit security. Upon reaching LGA they will then re-clear security. When booking connecting flights at different airports, international passengers should have a minimum of 3-5 hours to avoid missing connections.\n\nDuring inclement weather when there are erratic flight delays, flights may land but sit on the tarmac for some extended period of time and do not make to the gate until some time (due to unavailability of the gate, as all the flight start landing at the same time after the weather clears), we switch to a Dispatch only when the flight is at the gate model, or when you call us that you are ready.\n\nEach Terminal at LGA has its own pick area, which is subject to change during ongoing construction. Pickup Point will change depending upon whether it is an outside pickup or inside pickup (inside the terminal). Always stay alert and please free to call your driver or the car company when in doubt. A text message or email may provide you a link for the driver location.\n\nPick up points for each terminal are listed below under “Meet Your Driver” heading.\n\nThe total $8 billion transformation of LaGuardia Airport makes it is the first new major airport built in the United States in the last 25 years. LaGuardia Airport (IATA LGA), named after former NYC mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, primarily accommodates airline service to domestic (and limited international) destinations. As of 2019, it was the third-busiest airport in the New York metropolitan area, behind Kennedy (JFK) and Newark (EWR) airports, and the twenty-first busiest in the United States by passenger volume. The airport is located directly to the north of the Grand Central Parkway, the airport’s primary access highway. While the airport is a hub for both American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, commercial service is strictly governed by unique regulations including a curfew, a slot system, and a “perimeter rule” prohibiting most non-stop flights to or from destinations greater than 1,500 miles.\n\nIt was the Bowery Bay Beach Club. Located on the north shore of Long Island where the Easy River connects with the Long Island Sound, Bowery Bay was opened in 1886 by Willaim Steinway, founder of the world-renowned Steinway & Sons Piano. By 1900 Bowery Bay, by then offering a bathing pavilion, beach, boathouse and “Gala Amusement Park”, was renamed North Beach and was compared to Coney Island. But the club’s popularity was fleeting. Prohibition, post-WW1 anti-German sentiment and the industrialization of the surrounding areas and pollution of the Queens waterfront quickly led to its demise in the mid 1920’s.\n\nThe strongest support to develop the airport for commercial flights began with an outburst by New York mayor Fiorello La Guardia (in office from 1934 to 1945, a long-time aviation advocate who criticized both the federal and state governments’ slow progress in establishing municipal airports in the city. Returning on a TWA flight one day in 1934 from Chicago into Newark (the only commercial airport serving the New York City region at the time) he saw his ticket read destination, “New York”. He demanded to be taken to New York, had his plane turned around, where upon arrival he arranged a news conference and urged New Yorkers to support a new airport within their city.\n\nMayor LaGuardia continued his push for development in Curtiss Airport and the City soon leased the field for $1 per year, with an option to purchase the property. When the airport was officially dedicated New York Municipal Airport – LaGuardia Field on January 5, 1935 LaGuardia received a lease the same day from TWA making it the first major US airline to serve New York City directly. While it would still be years before TWA arrived at LaGuardia Field, Mayor LaGuardia had begun fulfilling one of his ultimate goals: extracting New York City from “the humiliating position of seeing all its passengers and mail traffic go to a nearby state.”\n\nAt LGA Laguardia airport, the best way of getting airport transfer or transportation is to pre-book your ride with a legitimate Private Hire, limo or Black Car service. The other good options are to get a taxi at the airport-controlled taxi line or get an Uber or Lyft. The Information Counter just outside the Customs Hall can guide you to the Taxi Line or your Private Hire, Black Car or Uber-Lyft pick up area. Know your fare in advance. At LGA, Taxi Fare for Manhattan is fixed. If you are going someplace other than Manhattan, ask the Taxi Dispatcher for an estimated fare to your destination. Cost of your pre-arrange Private Hire, Black Car or limo ride should also be fixed and include all charges including tolls, taxes and credit card fees, etc. Only pay by credit card, even in a taxi. Before entering into a taxi, make certain that the driver will accept a credit card. Get a receipt. Please note down the Taxi License Number in case you forget something in the taxi. To avoid “Lost & Found” problems, using a legitimate Private Hire or Black Car Company that tracks your ride history and offers the surest way to get your property returned.\n\nIn 2023 LaGuardia Terminal B was named World’s Best New Airport Terminal and received a 5-Star rating based on global passenger survey conducted by airport rating firm Skytrax Air Travel guide.\n\nMembers only lounges: Air Canada Maple Leaf Lounge; American Airlines Admirals Club; American Express Centurion Lounge; United Club.\n\nTerminal B has lots of options to either sit and relax with your food or grab something quickly on the way to your gate: Bar 212 (American classics); Bar Veloce (Mexican); Dos Toros Taqueria (Mexican); Dunkin’ (coffee); Grean Leaf’s (sandwiches, bowls); Irving Farm (coffee); Junior’s (cheesecake); Mi Casa (Mexican); Shake Shack (burgers); Tony’s (pizza); Wendy’s (Burgers); 5 Boroughs (sandwiches); Beechers (grilled cheese), Brooklyn Diner; Eli’s ( bagels from Zabars); Hill Country (BBQ); Hunt & Fish Grill (diverse, upscale); Il Viaggio (Italian): La Chula (Sandwiches); Mulberry Street (Italian); NY Creperie (sweet & savory); Panorama Bar (American); Starbucks; Spirit & Bell (cocktails); Sweetleaf (artisanal coffee); Zaro’s (breakfast, sandwiches).\n\nShopping: Bowery Bay (NY iconic brands); The Dean (barber services); District Market (beverages, souvenirs); FAO Schwartz (toys); Gotham News (travel essentials), Hudson (newspapers, snacks); INMOTION (electronics); LGA Duty Free; MAC (everyday wear); Mad Ave Markets (snacks, periodicals); McNally & Jackson (bookseller): MYC Aglow (souvenirs, snacks); The Scoop (snacks, travel essentials); WH Smith (travel essentials).\n\nAmenities: BE RELAX (massage, manicures); Childrens Play Spaces; Meditation Room; Minute Suites (private space)\n\ncan seamlessly access their gates using the latest technologies such as hands-free bag drop and Digital ID screening.

Vehicles are inspected for safety by the TLC every four months. Drivers are licensed after mandatory classes, background checks, driving record checks and drug testing. Insurance filings of the vehicles and driving records of the drivers are monitored on a continuous basis, with direct computer links to the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and other agencies.\n\nBlack Car and Limo Companies are only allowed to pick up by prearranged reservations or by calling a company you know after arriving at the airport. If your car company is a small company, you should make a reservation because it may not have a vehicle readily available for on demand service."
