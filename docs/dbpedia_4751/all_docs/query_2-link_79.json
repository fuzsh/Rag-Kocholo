        "text": "First, the flight was schedule to leave at 12:08. Delayed to 12:38. It is 12:58 and I am sitting at the gate. The staff are not communicating with us (just tell me it’s gonna be five hours if that’s the case, quit hufflepuffing around like you’re trying to board us when the plane isn’t even here and you don’t know where your crew are. I’m still waiting for any communication about the further delay. This is a rebooked flight from a cancelled flight yesterday, when the airline failed to fulfill its fiduciary responsibility to hotel and cover transport for overnight cancelations. Asking about the food on the flight? What food?!? Delta doesn’t serve meals unless you pay for them and you really want me to give delta a high rating for passing out processed snacks (fun size!)? Can we be for real. Delta is cementing itself in history as one of the cheap, stingy, outdated, glory days are over airlines, and it shows. I took this flight knowing delta was going to provide below level service but this is beyond burgers!! I can’t believe a multi billion or dollar company looked straight in my eyes yesterday and I told me this wasn’t their fault and there for the extra cost in hotel and hundreds of dollars in Ubers are MY RESPONSIBILITY. The only thing I am at fault for is believing delta is reputable company worthy of my dollars. I’m not even sure I want to be compensated unless it is cash because I would rather die never traveling again than to put money in their pockets.\n\nFlight was delayed. Had to get rebooked. Diamond medallion but stuck in a crappy seat. Rebooked flight then got delayed again. Then when we finally boarded, we waited another hour for a new crew. Then landed in JFK and sat for another 40 minutes waiting for a crew to come to the gate to be able to deplane. Hot mess all around, which unfortunately is becoming the norm for Delta\n\nThe flight was oversold and they kept on announcing they were looking for a volunteer to give away their seat, but the announcement has to be louder and clear @ gate 88 and also must precise. Additionally, the departure time kept on changing. But overall it was fine since it was a short flight.\n\nMy seat was changed at the last minute and I was moved to the last row, right next to the bathroom despite selecting my seat well in advance. I was also made to check my carry on due to space but when I got on the plane there was significant empty overhead space. Picking up my carry on from the luggage carousel added time to my trip which had already been extended due to delay.\n\n3 hours late and all they have is was a $12 meal voucher. That’s not even enough to cover fast food.\n\nFriendly flight attendants. Comfort plus seats were very comfortable and had lots of leg room. 10A and 10 B.\n\nOur flight to Zurich was delayed by almost 3 hours, so we missed our next flight. There was no indication it would be delayed this much. We were told the gate had changed and then it apparently took over 2 hours to load the \"catering\" on the plane. We were not compensated in any way for the trouble.\n\nThe 1st class male crew member was very pleasant - the short female with round glasses , maybe in 50’s had no personality- never spoke when delivering my food, drink, & never smiled the whole trip! In fact looked annoyed when the boarding proses was happening- I would never hire this woman - unfriendly . Have never dealt with a crew member like her-\n\nA regional sized plane was used for a cross country flight with no overhead bin space. I had to \"pink check\" my laptop and my medications. I was NOT pleased!!!!\n\nBest airline! Always friendly and welcoming. Skyclub was great and loved the fast free wifi on board. I also love that you can pre-order your meal on the app!\n\nIn-flight staff was very helpful and excellent. However, the flight was delayed by 90 minutes. Also the boarding process should be expedited in case of delayed flights. This will help the passengers trying to make international connections.\n\nThe walk from baggage claim to the taxi is very difficult for older people I will never fly into JFK again. It is physically challenging\n\nFlight was delayed by almost 5 hours. Suitcase was not loaded despite the flight being near empty (my colleagues’ suitcases did reach JFK, unlike mine). Had to argue on phone to get JetBlue to deliver the case to my hotel. Never again\n\nGreat. Loved that there was WiFi on flight to keep in touch and excellent service of beverages and snacks.\n\ngreat flight. Pilot was communicative, flight attendants were excellent. Really nice experience except my tv didn’t work.\n\nOverall, the flight was better than the flight I took to go to Florida, which had a bunch of problems. The crew is really nice and the plane was new so it had a small problem when we were on the runway, but the flight itself was great. They even made some time back up, which is always a good thing.\n\nEverything was good except for deplaning in NY. Took way too long!!\n\nJet Blue keeps getting iit wrong. 4 hour mechanical delay followed by terrible boarding experience. This is my third horrific jet blue flight in 2024. I am going to try to avoid this loser in the sky\n\nno wifi and the aircraft was very old with tiny 4” screens.\n\nAfter we landed, we were held on the plane for 30 minutes. There was no one at the gate once we landed and we forced to sit on a plan that had already over an hour delayed.\n\nWorst experience flying American Airlines. I fly with them often, so I was super disappointed in the service I received at gate 30 in LGA on May 24, mid-day. The flight was delayed twice. I was patiently waiting in the American Airlines lounge when I received the notice on my app that the plane was boarding 45 minutes before its newly re-scheduled take off of 4 pm (from the orginal 1:45 pm then 3:00 pm). It took me 5 min to travel from the lounge to the gate and when I arrived there at 3:20 flight gate attendant told me the flight had closed and that they announced for passengers multiple times. I showed them the notification on my app and they were really rude and unempathetic. The person who rescheduled my flight at customer service wasn't any happier but was at least helpful in getting me on the next flight.\n\nWas lucky to have a employee at the AA checkin counter that had compassion and understood they ordeal that we went through with our original flight being diverted, needing to stay in the aircraft and then flying to the original destination; adding hours to the trip and forcing us to miss our connection and our rebooked connection. She was able to get up on standby on the highest priority on the next flight to the closest airport we need to be at and it all worked out despite being many hours late.\n\nThey gave my seat away although it was a connecting flight with them and the flight was a bit delayed.\n\nHorrible people at the gate, they force me to check in my carry on, even thought no one behind me has to do it. I had to get out of the airport in NY to get my bag and go thru security again on my way to Honk Kong. The worst part is the employee threatened me with loosing the flights if don’t comply.\n\nHorrible. Flight was delayed and very bumpy. I was super unhappy\n\nThe agents at the gate were rude. The stwards were pleasant. The seats were comfortable. The tray table had crumbs on it. A passenger talked constantlt and very loudly for the entire flight annoying many passengers. The stewards did not ask her to speak in a lower voice but my travel partner did.\n\nCut off carry ons, had to check, got on and there was plenty of bin space. Disappointing.\n\nLiterally the worst experience ever and I had my service dog with me. Flight was supposed to leave at 1:51 PM but the plane arrived late. They boarded us around 3 PM and kept us on the plane for an hour saying that due to weather conditions in Miami, we could not takeoff yet. After waiting for an hour, they deplaned. And then they will not give us our bags back that we could just leave and schedule for another flight. Every hour they kept updating saying we have to wait another hour without any explanation as to what was going on. Eventually, I went to customer service to change my ticket, but by the time I made it to the front of the line, they started boarding my flight again. And then when we got onto the flight, they said there were two flight attendants That were past their shift. They kept us on the plane for about another 40 minutes until they told us they had no other flight attendance and had to deplane again. Then I gave us hotel vouchers and told us we would be on a flight at 6 AM the next day. At this point it is about 9 PM. I get to the hotel with my dog, who hasn’t been able to go potty for about eight hours. When I arrived at the hotel, I got a text alert saying my flight has been canceled at 6 AM and they moved past to 5 AM, however the hotel shuttle doesn’t leave early enough to make it to the airport for 5 AM flight. So me and some other passengers got a cab after about three hours of sleep to get back to the airport. This was the worst experience ever.\n\nOne of the worst flights I have ever taken Delayed over an hour without communication from the crew; very scary Entertainment not working Crew NASTY cabin cold\n\nMay never fly American again Delay in take off WITHOUT EXPLANATION Cabin freezing Crew NASTY entertainment did not work entire flight\n\nHorrible experience, they cancelled the flight , and we had to lose money on car rentals and hotels and tickets for extraction\n\nDidn’t board the flight asked for a flight credit for future flights wasn’t given it. One of the children were to scared to board the flight\n\nWe were delayed departing and also it took 40 min before we were able to exit the plane after landing and there was no AC I felt like I’m going to die\n\nTo long of a delay and way to long on the plane. I know weather sucks, but I felt the flight crew did the bare minimum.\n\nflight was delayed two hours delayed another two hours and ultimately cancelled\n\nI didn't like that before both flights we had to wait for an hour sitting on the plane for maintenance reasons while this could have been done earlier. I also didn't like that we had to pay even for water. The small water bottle is 5 dollars. I also didn't like that the ticket didn't include either carry on or check in bag, are we supposed to travel without anything? I'm not happy with that.\n\nTerrible experience, will definitely NEVER fly with Spirit again (this was my first AND last time). They canceled the flight JUST minutes before we were about to board, with no warning, no reason, and no recourse. We managed to get on a different, much more expensive one-way flight home (with United) later that night, and arrived early the next morning, although by that point, the garage with our car had already closed for the day. So we were left having to pay an exorbitant $200 Uber ride to get home. Trying to fly with Spirit is definitely “penny wise and pound foolish,” absolutely NOT worth whatever meager savings they promise (and then still nickel and dime you for everything from water to a carry-on bag).\n\nWe received several notifications of a delay but the flight ended up leaving on time without us even tho we were in the airport eating very close by. We received no notification that the flight moved back to its original time.\n\nPoor response to delay, getting on plane, off plane and back on again\n\nThis was the return leg of my journey with Spirit Airlines. Despite its reputation, I found no issues as it got me from point A to B safely and without delay, especially with no mechanical delays, which is fantastic in my book! The staff, from ground crew to cabin crew, were all pleasant and hassle-free. The flight was smooth from takeoff to landing. I have absolutely no complaints about this no-frills airline!\n\nBooked two aisle seats and were switched to an aisle and middle. Not happy.\n\nBetter than expected.on time. Friendly staff in NY however MYR not so nice.\n\nThe trip was unremarkable which is good. Crew was very professional and courteous.\n\nOnline check-in was not user-friendly. Too many fees, not cost effective.\n\nDid not realize seats did not recline. Best to travel in an exit row... No question\n\nFRONTIER SUCKS! The agent downstairs tricked me into booking, just to get to the gate. At the gate, they told me they couldn't help. I then called Customer Service. They and the gate attendants kept blaming each other. Neither side was willing to help the customer.\n\nWorst experience I have seen. The flight was cancelled without any reason.\n\nGood for the price. My only complaint is that the pilot should keep the air flowing while passengers are waiting to getting out of airplane.\n\nI arrived 1 hour prior to boarding, and they said I was too late for a domestic flight. First time I heard that :-("
