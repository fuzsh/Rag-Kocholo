        "text": "The term “hub” is borrowed from the anatomy of a wheel—the center of a wheel is the hub, from which spokes radiate to the outer edge. The hub-and-spoke system allows airlines to serve more cities with fewer planes, since they can funnel travelers into a few hubs rather than serve their full slate of destinations with direct flights from every airport.\n\nIn addition to hubs, sometimes airlines ramp up service in “focus cities.” The best way to understand focus cities is as a smaller hub, typically serving more limited routes within a region."
