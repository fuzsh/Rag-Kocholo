Whether you’ve had your fair share of hustle and bustle and are eager to relax oceanside, or you crave sitting by the fire in a small cabin in the woods, now is the time to make travel a priority.\n\nEnjoy walking through Central Park? Perhaps it is time to enjoy a promenade on a completely different island, maybe somewhere that’s warm year-round. Or trade your park strolls for hiking trails or learn how to mountain bike. If New York’s serious vibe has you ready for a new type of warmth, there’s nothing like Southern hospitality to give you the pick-me-up you need. If you need to take a break from your hectic day-to-day schedule, now’s your chance! You can count on Southwest to help you get there so you can let your adventurous side take over."
