        "text": "CHARLESTON, W.Va. (WSAZ) - Passengers flying out of the West Virginia International Yeager Airport have a new option when planning their next vacation.\n\nBreeze Airways has been operating in Charleston since May 2023, but now they’re offering flights to the Newark Liberty National Airport in the greater New York City area.\n\n“We’ve had a great partnership with Breeze Airways so far. This is the first time that they have entered into a New York City market in any of the three New York City airports, so it just goes to show that the market here is working and we hope that they continue to expand,” said Paige Withrow, Chief Marketing Officer at CRW.\n\nBreeze Airways spokesperson Gareth Edmondson-Jones said the Charleston market fits the description for markets they look to expand in.\n\n“The thing about Breeze is that we look for pockets of opportunity where other airlines don’t have service.”\n\nFlights from Yeager to Newark begin on Nov. 14 with dates available around the weekend when flight traffic is highest.\n\n“So for the Newark flights were flying Thursdays and Sundays, but as those fill up then we add Fridays and Mondays and we grow from there,” Edmondson-Jones said.\n\nThe Newark Airport may not be a direct flight to New York City, but with public transportation, you can get there quickly.\n\nThe new addition will allow people to travel farther. “Newark is a huge hub that has over 1,000 flights a day in over 30 airlines so a lot of room for our passengers to take this flight and connect somewhere else,” Withrow said.\n\nIt’s been 11 years since flights to the New York area have been available from Charleston, and Breeze Airways hopes to make this a long term travel destination from Yeager Airport.\n\nThe flight to Newark is year-round, and Breeze Airways is running a promotion where you can get 35% off any flight through Aug. 9.\n\nFor previous coverage >>> Breeze Airways announces flight from W.Va. to New York-Newark"
