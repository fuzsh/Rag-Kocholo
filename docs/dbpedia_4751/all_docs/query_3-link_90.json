        "text": "It was good for lax to sea even tho it was delayed by an hour. That is not this crews fault however.\n\nTook off and landed at the correct airports so they did pretty good.\n\nI am extremely dissapointed with Alaska Airlines. I had two minors traveling along, I used the unaccompanied minor program to escort my kids and bring them to mom on the other side of the flight. Unfortunately they just left them at the gate on the other side and did not bring them to mom. The person working for the airline flat out just told the kids they were not going to bring them to mom and just left them sitting there at the gate!!! These are two kids traveling alone. This is horrible and security should have been called\n\nFlight was excellent , crew were very helpful and kind. No entertainment was needed as it was an overnight flight. Keep up the great work. Thank you ðŸ˜Š\n\nMore transparency about the fact that the aircraft is a Boeing 737-max. The flight was fine and the plane is comfortable but giving all the issues that aircraft has had, there needs to be more transparency that Alaska is using it.\n\nGreat airline. Had no problems and minor delay due to weather. Staff was friendly. Would definitely fly them again.\n\nWas on a red eye departed at 9pm and arrived at 5 am...we were all asleep before snacks and drinks. We were happy we got on seated and comfortable. We arrive sleepy safe and sound. That's a win! Thank you Alaska Airlines and staff!\n\nThis is where things were a bit upsetting first the wheelchair assistance person not only was playing games at first leaving us to wonder. When I did get another person to help she took me to the gate the Alaska Airlines person Alex was rude. I didn't have a seat assigned which was not helping my travel anxiety, he honestly didn't seem to care when he step away I came to another agent named John who was very empathetic and kind. He looked in his computer and gave me a seat realizing my situation.\n\nFlight was okay. Flew with my dog who was supposed to be brought to cargo 30 minutes after flight but they took and hour and a half. Heâ€™s a living breathing animal who had been locked in a crate for 6 hours already. The fact that he wasnâ€™t prioritized over suitcases of clothes makes me never want o fly Alaska again.\n\nSoda cans were mini-size; snacks were teeny. Options for entertainment on trans-continent flights were bad - no seat screens and no way to support device (as seen on other airlines) so had to hold device in position. Just overall, not good (compared to United)\n\nMy Flight was cancelled and there was no other options available for me to Travel on that date and my options for the next day was all connecting flights that would have me in the airports all day before reaching my destination\n\nFirst, the flight was schedule to leave at 12:08. Delayed to 12:38. It is 12:58 and I am sitting at the gate. The staff are not communicating with us (just tell me itâ€™s gonna be five hours if thatâ€™s the case, quit hufflepuffing around like youâ€™re trying to board us when the plane isnâ€™t even here and you donâ€™t know where your crew are. Iâ€™m still waiting for any communication about the further delay. This is a rebooked flight from a cancelled flight yesterday, when the airline failed to fulfill its fiduciary responsibility to hotel and cover transport for overnight cancelations. Asking about the food on the flight? What food?!? Delta doesnâ€™t serve meals unless you pay for them and you really want me to give delta a high rating for passing out processed snacks (fun size!)? Can we be for real. Delta is cementing itself in history as one of the cheap, stingy, outdated, glory days are over airlines, and it shows. I took this flight knowing delta was going to provide below level service but this is beyond burgers!! I canâ€™t believe a multi billion or dollar company looked straight in my eyes yesterday and I told me this wasnâ€™t their fault and there for the extra cost in hotel and hundreds of dollars in Ubers are MY RESPONSIBILITY. The only thing I am at fault for is believing delta is reputable company worthy of my dollars. Iâ€™m not even sure I want to be compensated unless it is cash because I would rather die never traveling again than to put money in their pockets.\n\nFlight was delayed. Had to get rebooked. Diamond medallion but stuck in a crappy seat. Rebooked flight then got delayed again. Then when we finally boarded, we waited another hour for a new crew. Then landed in JFK and sat for another 40 minutes waiting for a crew to come to the gate to be able to deplane. Hot mess all around, which unfortunately is becoming the norm for Delta\n\nMy seat was changed at the last minute and I was moved to the last row, right next to the bathroom despite selecting my seat well in advance. I was also made to check my carry on due to space but when I got on the plane there was significant empty overhead space. Picking up my carry on from the luggage carousel added time to my trip which had already been extended due to delay.\n\n3 hours late and all they have is was a $12 meal voucher. Thatâ€™s not even enough to cover fast food.\n\nFriendly flight attendants. Comfort plus seats were very comfortable and had lots of leg room. 10A and 10 B.\n\nOur flight to Zurich was delayed by almost 3 hours, so we missed our next flight. There was no indication it would be delayed this much. We were told the gate had changed and then it apparently took over 2 hours to load the \"catering\" on the plane. We were not compensated in any way for the trouble.\n\nThe 1st class male crew member was very pleasant - the short female with round glasses , maybe in 50â€™s had no personality- never spoke when delivering my food, drink, & never smiled the whole trip! In fact looked annoyed when the boarding proses was happening- I would never hire this woman - unfriendly . Have never dealt with a crew member like her-\n\nA regional sized plane was used for a cross country flight with no overhead bin space. I had to \"pink check\" my laptop and my medications. I was NOT pleased!!!!\n\nBest airline! Always friendly and welcoming. Skyclub was great and loved the fast free wifi on board. I also love that you can pre-order your meal on the app!\n\nIn-flight staff was very helpful and excellent. However, the flight was delayed by 90 minutes. Also the boarding process should be expedited in case of delayed flights. This will help the passengers trying to make international connections.\n\nThey put me on a chair in between two men, one overweight who was almost falling on top of me, and the other was even uncomfortable because I was half falling because of what the other was pushing me. I stayed with. my feet were swollen from fluid retention and from being unable to accommodate myself. it was very uncomfortable. I asked for help but they told me that the flight was full and they couldn't help me. I got off the plane almost unable to walk due to the inflammation. and then at FLL airport I asked for help because I couldn't go to my next flight, which was a connection.\n\nThe walk from baggage claim to the taxi is very difficult for older people I will never fly into JFK again. It is physically challenging\n\nFlight was delayed by almost 5 hours. Suitcase was not loaded despite the flight being near empty (my colleaguesâ€™ suitcases did reach JFK, unlike mine). Had to argue on phone to get JetBlue to deliver the case to my hotel. Never again\n\nGreat! I love Jet Blue. My favorite airline! Very efficient, clean and timely.\n\nGreat. Loved that there was WiFi on flight to keep in touch and excellent service of beverages and snacks.\n\ngreat flight. Pilot was communicative, flight attendants were excellent. Really nice experience except my tv didnâ€™t work.\n\nOverall, the flight was better than the flight I took to go to Florida, which had a bunch of problems. The crew is really nice and the plane was new so it had a small problem when we were on the runway, but the flight itself was great. They even made some time back up, which is always a good thing.\n\nEverything was good except for deplaning in NY. Took way too long!!\n\nJet Blue keeps getting iit wrong. 4 hour mechanical delay followed by terrible boarding experience. This is my third horrific jet blue flight in 2024. I am going to try to avoid this loser in the sky\n\nGreat checkin experience and flight crew were very friendly and helpful\n\nOur flight was delayed several times. It left 9 hours after scheduling. We had to sleep in the airport.\n\nMy flight was delayed for a whole day, so I lost a day of my vacation.\n\nStaff did not care, and very clearly did not want to be serving passengers. Requests were ignored repeatedly. Toilets filthy. Bins were just trash bags hung around the place that were never emptied. It was a challenge to even get a glass of water on a 14 hour flight.\n\nFlight was delayed by an hour and We had to rush and run so we will make it to our connecting flight! And then when we reached Naples, Italy , our luggages were all DELAYED!!! It was a real inconvenience to us!!\n\nEverything was pretty good except for food. They need to improve on it compared to other airlines.\n\nI had a great flight. Everything went smoothly and the flight arrived early.\n\nThere was no screens on board AND the WiFi didnâ€™t work. My seat was broken and couldnâ€™t recline so I couldnâ€™t even sleep. The flight attendants didnâ€™t offer anything to make it more comfortable. It was such an old cramped plane, when the person in front of me reclined I couldnâ€™t even open my tray table. All the United ads talk about guaranteeing everyone gets a screen!\n\nTerrible! The plane was old and you are required to connect your own device to their Wi-Fi rather than have entertainment options in the back of the seat in front of you. The Wi-Fi went out during the flight and there was only one plug for the devices every two seats. Three out of five surrounding my family did not work. The seats and spaces under them were so small I could not fit my backpack, which Iâ€™ve always brought on flights and fit before no problem. The crew were unpleasant and patronizing.\n\nLeft 2 hours later for delayed I had to take care a kid with special need since people donâ€™t want to move to accommodate the rest of the family. . It wasnâ€™t bad but that made me upset that people can be that selfish.\n\nWay better than I expected. The plane was so clean- the seats seemed brand new; although not super comfortable as they were lightly cushioned.. The crew helped me lift my bags up to the overhead bin which not many airlines do. I knew there would not be internet or food/snacks but you could buy some if you wanted .\n\nSpirit airlines is very bad airline staff doesnt know how to treat passangers they didnt allow us in the flight we reached 45 minutes ago from flight departure but they denied nd said you are late Very disappointed i never reccomend spirit airlines\n\nThey charge you for everything. Even water. They accepted my dog as a service dog in my reservation. Then they asked for a DOT form that was impossible to provide. I had to pay $175 for my service to fly with me, that would protect me from death if I ate peanuts. They did not however, serve peanuts on the plane.\n\nTraveling on Spirit Airlines was awful. It was by far the worst airline we ever traveled on. There is no food service at all unless you paid for it. Even a cuppa coffee or a water was $5 . Iâ€™ve never been in a seat so close to the one in front of me. There was literally 10-12 inches from my face to the seat back in front of me. We actually all had to laugh at the size of the tray table. Never see a tray table so small, and I donâ€™t even see the point of it. By booking through Spirit, but after I paid for checked luggage, water, coffee, I wouldâ€™ve been better off going with our usual airline where everything was included. It actually wouldâ€™ve been cheaper and way more comfortable. We joked that we were actually surprised they didnâ€™t give us tokens just to use the bathroom. My daughter even knows she would never travel on Spirit again, and sheâ€™s not high maintenance at all. Aweful\n\nFlight kept being delayed on airport board without any announcement. We were delayed almost 2 hours. Finally boarded and we had no pilots so we sat on a hot plane with screaming kids and no pilots for 40 minutes. Finally he came aboard and did paperwork for 10 minutes before we took off. No apologies or any explanations or even excuses from ANY staff in the entire process. Worst experience ever on the ground and the air I have had.\n\nDelays delays and more delays in both LAX and San Jose. And then I said something else flight was supposed to arrive in Portland at 12:04 but didn't land until 2:30 PM which made me late for my appointment.\n\nMy flight was uncomfortable and crammed. There were no pockets to store things, I couldnâ€™t move my seat back slightly. Beverages including soda cost extra. My husband flew on another spirit airline flight, which was delayed a total of 48 hours, only to be canceled.\n\nHorrible, first flight delayed. They switched my connecting flight while I was en route and even though I was originally supposed to be on the flight going back home to boston, refused to let me board and told me I would have to wait for next flight that was 14 hours later. Ended up renting a car and driving 6.5 hours back home. Still getting messages about flight and it is now showing that the other flight they put me on is now canceled and I would have to wait 24 hours for the next one. I will never book with spirit again\n\nOverall it was a miserable experience... I will never fly spirit for more than a 3 hour flight or overnight."
