If your destination lies away from the west side or Queens or Brooklyn then travel is likely to be both expensive and time-consuming.\n\nTravel Options\n\nThere are several options for travellers to and from Newark Airport.\n\nNew Jersey Transit is a relatively easy option to get from EWR to midtown NYC ad back. It takes approximately 30 minutes and cost around $13. Trains between Penn Station and EWR run nearly all day.\n\nThe Newark Airport Express Shuttle takes travellers to all EWR terminals and midtown Manhattan. Rates start at $17 and takes around 17 minutes.\n\nTaxi rides will likely run from $50-$70 to and from Manhattan and even more from other boroughs.\n\nRide shares like Uber and Lyft will run anywhere from $30-$50 or more depending on the time of day\n\nLaGuardia Airport (LGA)\n\nAnother frequent choice for domestic travel is LaGuaria airport with popular airlines such as Delta, American Airlines, JetBlue, United and more. If your destination includes midtown or uptown Manhattan or the north side of Brooklyn LGA is your closest option.\n\nTravel Options\n\nPublic options are limited to and from LGA since you’ll first need to take a bus. Bus fares are relatively inexpensive however and rates to multiple locations run around $3.\n\nTaxi rides are an option to midtown Manhattan with rates starting anywhere between $25-$40 (plus tip and tolls).

Kennedy International Airport (JFK)\n\nIf you’re staying in lower Brooklyn (farther south than Williamsburg) or the east side of Brooklyn, JFK is likely your closest option.
