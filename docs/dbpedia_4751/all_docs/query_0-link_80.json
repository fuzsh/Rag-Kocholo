        "text": "Getting To Binghamton from New York City/Newark Airports\n\nThere are two convenient modes of transportation to reach Binghamton from New York City/Newark airports.\n\nBus\n\nThe easiest way to reach Binghamton from NYC and Newark airports is by bus.\n\nOurBus is a bus rideshare service offering direct service to Binghamton from JFK International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport on select dates. You can find more details about this service and available dates on the OurBus website. If you are interested in using that service, you will need to review that page carefully for instructions on selecting a time slot in advance.\n\nRegular buses from several bus companies depart daily from the Port Authority Bus Terminal (located in Manhattan) to the Binghamton Bus Station.\n\nFollow signs at the airport to “Ground Transportation” to get a taxi, shuttle, train, or bus to the Port Authority Bus Terminal. See details for each airport below. Once you are at the bus terminal go to Greyhound Bus Lines, Coach USA Bus Lines, or Trailways in order to purchase a bus ticket to Binghamton.\n\nFor more information about bus options to Binghamton, see the Greater Binghamton Transportation Center website. Some of these bus carriers may depart from alternate locations in NYC that are not the Port Authority Bus Terminal.\n\nJFK airport to the Port Authority Bus Terminal:\n\nEach mode of transportation has its own costs and benefits. Check individual transit providers' websites for current pricing.\n\nSuper Shuttle and Go Airlink NYC:\n\nSuper Shuttle and Go Airlink NYC serve all three airports: John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), LaGuardia Airport (LGA), and Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR). You can find the ride that suits your schedule by visiting their website and booking online.\n\nAirTrain:\n\nThe AirTrain is the cheapest and quickest way to travel from JFK Airport to Port Authority during the day and night.\n\nTake AirTrain to Jamaica then transfer to the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) which goes to Penn Station. At Penn Station, you can either take the subway (A, C or E line) one stop uptown to 42nd Street, a taxi, or walk (10 - 15 minutes) to the Port Authority.\n\nOr you could take AirTrain to Jamaica and the E Train directly to the Port Authority. It is a cheaper ride than the LIRR but a longer one.\n\nTaxi Cab:\n\nTaxi cabs can take from 30-60 minutes from the airport to Manhattan. Tipping is customary for good service.\n\nUber or Lyft\n\nNewark Liberty Airport to the Port Authority Bus Terminal:\n\nEach mode of transportation has its own costs and benefits.

There are other airports close to the Binghamton area, but transportation to Binghamton from these airports may be expensive or difficult."
