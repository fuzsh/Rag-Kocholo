Navigating LaGuardia Airport: A Guide to All Terminals and Airlines

LaGuardia Airport (LGA) serves over 20 million passengers annually across its four terminals. A, B, C, and D. Unlike most major airports, the terminals at LGA are not connected airside, meaning travelers must utilize the free airport shuttle buses when moving between terminals post-security.

Terminal A

Known historically as the Marine Air Terminal, LaGuardia Terminal A opened in 1939 as the first terminal built explicitly for commercial aviation. The Art Deco building was designed to handle seaplane traffic and maintain that maritime theme.

Inside, the dome leads to the check-in hall and TSA security checkpoint. The single TSA line is relatively quick, given Terminal A’s lighter passenger load than other LGA terminals.

The departure concourse features just six gates numbered A1–A6. Passengers will find concessions like CIBO Express and duty-free shopping. JetBlue exclusively uses Terminal A LaGuardia for flights in and out of LGA.

Terminal B

Laguardia Terminal B is the airport’s largest and most recently redesigned terminal. Its four-level structure has separate floors for passenger drop-off, baggage claim, ticketing/check-in, and departure gates.

On Level 4 of Terminal B, passengers will find two concourses—the Eastern Concourse (gates 40–59) and Western Concourse (gates 11–31)—connected by a pedestrian sky bridge. Between the two concourses lie over 30 departure gates used by Air Canada, American Airlines, JetBlue, Southwest, and United.

Concessions at LaGuardia Airport Terminal B range from quick-bite eateries like Shake Shack to full-service restaurants like Avra Estiatorio. Additional amenities include an Admirals Club lounge, a pet relief area, a children’s play zone, and more.

Terminal C

In 2022, LaGuardia Airport opened an entirely new Terminal C, costing over $4 billion. The mega terminal consolidates all previous Delta Air Lines and WestJet gates and check-in under one roof.

LaGuardia Terminal C contains four concourses—C1 through C4—seamlessly connected behind the security checkpoint for easy connections. The four concourses provide 37 departure gates for Delta and WestJet’s LGA flights.

Similar to Terminal B, there is abundant shopping and dining spread throughout C1-C4. Sit-down restaurants, quick bites, news/gifts, and duty-free airside are available. Additional amenities in Terminal C include a mammoth Delta SkyClub, a children’s play area, a workout room, and nursing stations.

LGA Airport Lounges: How to Access Luxury Pre-Flight

After going through LaGuardia Airport security, passengers with extra time can enjoy one of the many lounges and clubs available in LaGuardia Airport Lounges Terminal B and Terminal C post-security. These premium spaces provide comfortable seating, free food/drinks, WiFi, and other amenities for a relaxing pre-flight experience.

However, having extra time at LGA does not grant access to these lounges. Most lounges require paid entry, elite frequent flyer status, or specific credit cards to qualify for complimentary entry. Below is how travelers can access each central lounge at LaGuardia Airport based on their airport profiles.

Terminal B Lounges

Air Canada Maple Leaf Lounge – Available only to premium cabin passengers and elite Air Canada frequent flyers (no paid entries).

American Airlines Admirals Club – Complimentary for AAdvantage Executive Platinum, Platinum Pro, Concierge Key elites, and credit card holders. Day passes start at $59 for non-elites.

Centurion Lounge – Free for Platinum and Centurion American Express cardholders. Delta SkyMiles reserve card also grants complimentary access. Otherwise, it is not open to paid day pass visitors.

United Club – Access for United Premier elites and those with eligible United credit cards. Paid day passes cost $59.

Terminal C Lounges

Delta Sky Club – Delta’s most prominent lounge location is open exclusively to Delta SkyMiles Diamond/Platinum elites, Delta SkyClub members, and certain Delta credit card holders. No paid day use permitted.

So, in summary, some lounges permit paid access daily for around $59 per person. However, most rely heavily on airline status or premium credit cards to restrict capacity for top customers. Review each lounge’s eligibility terms before visiting LGA to prevent unexpected denial during your pre-flight experience.

Tips for Access

If you don’t currently qualify for LGA lounge access, here are two tips:

Add a family member with credit card lounge access as an authorized user on their card. As a provisional card member, their eligibility grants complimentary entry when traveling together. Just have them book the flights/tickets.

Consider applying for a premium travel credit card with airport lounge access benefits. Cards like The Platinum Card from American Express, the Delta SkyMiles Reserve Card, and more provide cardholders and often travel companions complimentary entry. Airport lounge access is a key cardholder perk with these products.

With sound preparation using the above guidance, you can unlock elevated pre-flight experiences in LGA’s premier lounges and clubs. Enjoy luxury amenities with food, drinks, comfortable seating, and WiFi regardless of your economy ticket.
