        "text": "By Andrew Deak\n\n(02/08/2019)\n\nIn recent years we’ve seen a massive change from one-time purchases to subscription and cloud. Microsoft and Adobe are at the forefront of these innovative changes. All three segments of Microsoft, Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing are hitting all-time highs and firing on all cylinders. Although recently a lot of focus has been pushed towards the enterprise leaving consumers slightly out of the light. An acquisition of Adobe would allow Microsoft to synergize its diverse portfolio of products to empower our consumers, education, and enterprise, not only in the cloud but in physical products as well.\n\nCreative Suit\n\nOne of the main selling points for Microsoft’s Surface line is its touch screen, the pen and its ability to adjust position on certain products. Having live demos in-store or weekly events teaching how Surface products can empower your creativity or business through the Adobe suite can potentially draw more customers towards the Microsoft Adobe brands. Just like Microsoft currently does with its Office Suite, this has the potential to expand the market share in the personal computer space as a byproduct. These products synergize with the idea of education and learning and can be bundled with Windows and Office for educators. This also feeds into the ethos of high margin recurring revenue from cloud products and services. This cash can be used in the further development of products, new acquisitions, buying back stock, pay down debt and much more.\n\nAdobe has been expanding its 3D modeling and textures capabilities with Fuse and Allegorithmic. This has the possibility to become a powerful tool for Microsoft game developers. Which can lead to a potential future acquisition of Autodesk for 3D modeling, architecture, construction, engineering, and entertainment. This would be beneficial because they are currently transitioning to a subscription model and who better to help then Microsoft and Adobe.\n\nQuickly another good acquisition would be Pixologic which owns ZBrush which is used for 3D/2.5D sculpting, texturing and painting. These three acquisitions Adobe, Autodesk and Pixologic would make Microsoft the king of creativity. These will synergize with reducing cost for game developers, which Microsoft has plenty of game studios. As well as future acquisitions of game studios can also integrate these tools to reduce costs. After Microsoft owns all these products, it can be bundled or sold separately to developers.\n\nAdobe, Pixologic, and Autodesk have huge potential for enterprise and consumer alike. Using models created on a Surface Studio and importing it to a HoloLens would streamline the process pulling more and more companies into Microsoft’s ecosystem. On the consumer side using Microsoft’s powerful Surface products will enhance your experience using something like the Surface Pro for drawing or Surface Book for drawing, engineering, architecture, and the possibilities are limitless.\n\nCreative Cloud\n\nCurrently, Adobe utilizes both Azure and Amazon Web Services, acquiring Adobe and moving all its cloud operations to Azure would greatly improve margins. Adobe's Creative Cloud client is extremely intuitive and powerful which can be combined with Office.\n\nCurrently, Microsoft has Office 365 Home and Personal, but there can potentially be a third for creatives. Which would include something like Photoshop or Premiere to get them into the ecosystem.\n\nThe Microsoft Office app which contains all office apps in one place is extremely underutilized, on the other hand, the Creative Cloud app which contains all of Adobes apps in one place is extensively used. This leads me to believe it can be synergized with the Creative Cloud client for a better, more intuitive user interface.\n\nMarketing, Analytics, E-commerce\n\nWith Adobe’s recent acquisition of Marketo and previous acquisitions, they’re solidifying themselves in a growing marketing cloud. This would allow Microsoft to expand past its three core businesses growing and expanding its presence in Marketing, Analytics, and E-commerce.\n\nAdobe has real-time analytics that can be integrated with Azure, marketing, enterprise, and small businesses. These businesses can use that data and analytics to better empower their businesses. Adobe Analytics can be combined with Microsoft’s existing Dynamics and PowerBI.\n\nRecently Adobe Acquired Magento pushing its way into the E-commerce space which is growing and can be integrated with Microsoft’s cloud, analytics, office and marketing suits making Microsoft/Adobe the foundation for any business. Proving a simple intuitive platform for any business or consumers that assists them in achieving whatever they desire all in one Microsoft platform would be the eventual goal.\n\nAdobe Sign\n\nCurrently, DocuSign is used to sign most legal documents in Microsoft stores, and I assume incorporate as well. Adobe has its own signing program that allows digital signatures. Swapping from DocuSign to Adobe Sign will cut costs internally due to Microsoft no longer needing to pay for services from DocuSign. With Windows having ~85% Operating System market share, Microsoft can integrate AdobeSign into Windows and this will leave Microsoft in a strong position to take market share from DocuSign.\n\nFinancials\n\nAdobe’s revenues have been hitting highs of $9 billion dollars with about $2.6 billion as net income, again all-time highs. Adobe has been growing revenues 20% year over year. Adobe currently has around $9 billion dollars in liabilities primarily from funding its recent $4.75 billion-dollar acquisition for Marketo. Adobe currently runs a profit margin of 25-30%. With Adobes high-profit margin and large growth, it invokes a higher P/E ratio. Adobe doesn’t pay a dividend; they’re focused on using its income to reinvest into the company with R&D or acquisitions. Adobe has been slowly buying back stock although due to its elevated P/E I would assume that management believes using its cash for acquisitions or R&D would result in greater value-added.\n\nTechnologies (Chips)\n\nBoth Microsoft and Adobe are technology companies and must purchase server chips from Nvidia, Intel, AMD or etc. This acquisition would allow the development of a new chip that can be made in house to reduce costs. Apple, Google, and Samsung already design their own chips. Amazon started adding its designed chips to Amazon Web Services. Using what Adobe has designed so far and adding that to what Microsoft has developed can streamline the process with potential for quicker integration, lower costs and higher performance.\n\nChallenges\n\nAdobe is a $126 billion-dollar company and acquiring something that large presents challengers. Such as debt, stock or cash financing for the acquisition. Microsoft has a net cash balance of approximately $50 Billion dollars thus making it a good idea to use some combination of stock, cash, and debt for the purchase but using a majority stock for the acquisition will allow Microsoft to maintain higher levels of cash on the balance sheet as a safety precaution. Adobe is currently sporting a relatively elevated P/E, which will draw flak from some investors and a potential for the acquisition to be rejected on the basis of anti-competitive claims. Due to the relative success of Adobe and its ability to grow revenues and earning it may present a problem if they aren’t even willing to sell the company.\n\nMicrosoft and Adobe in recent years have been strengthening its relationship with the Open Data Initiative and creating integrations between Microsoft services and Adobe services. Which begs the question, why an acquisition instead just working closer together?\n\nFuture and Conclusion\n\nAdobe is a household name for creatives. Their brand is known for its community, creativity, innovation, and clarity. Recently Microsoft, Adobe and SAP have been working closely together with the Open Data Initiative. Microsoft and Adobe have been becoming more intertwined on the enterprise side. There will be a challenge in absorbing a company the size of Adobe but in the long term the reduction of cost due to synergies, expanding customer base, expanding database, expanding product portfolio and more will result in a greater value-added. Using existing infrastructure from Microsoft and Adobe and merging them will create a better solution for the consumers which will allow Microsoft to become the epicenter for creativity and productivity solutions for the consumer to enterprise.\n\nConcluding, I believe that Microsoft acquiring Adobe with Satya Nadella at the helm with assistance from Shantanu Narayen of these decades-old technology companies can continue to prosper and push for innovation and improvement for centuries more to come.\n\n“We want to empower every person and origination on the planet” -Satya Nadella"
