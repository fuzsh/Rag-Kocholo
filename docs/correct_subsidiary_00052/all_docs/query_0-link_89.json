FLA files typically include vector image data for use in animations, timelines to control animation playback, and audio; they may also include \"bitmapped\" video content. FLA files may include or reference ActionScripts (similar to JavaScripts) to provide interactivity.1 FLA files are comparable to source code and are typically saved as Flash files for Internet delivery; see SWF_7 and SWF_8.\n\nTemporary note (March 2010): Although Adobe Systems Inc. had acquired Macromedia in 2005, the specification for version 8 of the SWF file format (SWF_8), together with documentation of the FLV format, was published that year under the Macromedia brand. It is not clear to the compiler of this Web page if the specifications for the FLA project format were revised, although in 2005 the creating application was assigned number 8. See SWF_Family for links to SWF specifications. Comments welcome."
