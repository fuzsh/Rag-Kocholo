Warnock started as the Founder-President of Adobe during the first 2 years of the company and then became the CEO of Adobe for a period of 16 years. He retired from the position of CEO in 2000 and as the CTO of the company in 2001. Warnock served as the Chairman of the Adobe Board from April 1989 to January 2017.

This page description language, later known as PostScript, described such objects as letters and graphics in mathematical terms, without reference to any specific computer or printer. Any device capable of interpreting the language would be able to generate a representation of the page at any resolution the device supported. When Xerox declined to bring the technology to market, Warnock and Geschke formed their own company to do so, naming it after a creek near their homes.\n\nAdobe - Mission and Vision\n\nThe Adobe mission statement is “to move the Web forward while also giving Web designers and developers the best tools and services in the world.” This statement shows that Adobe is all about the transformation and development of the technological niche through its software.\n\nAdobe's vision is of empowering digital businesses.\n\nAdobe - Name, Tagline, Logo and its Meaning\n\nThe name of the company, Adobe, comes from Adobe Creek in Los Altos, California, which ran behind Warnock's house. That creek is so named because of the type of clay found there, which alludes to the creative nature of the company's software. Adobe's corporate logo features a stylized \"A\" and was designed by Marva Warnock, a graphic designer who is also John Warnock's wife.\n\nThe Adobe logo was designed by Marva Warnock, a graphic designer and wife of one of the company’s founders, John Warnock.\n\nThe current Adobe Systems logo features the alphabet “A” portrayed in white on a red background.

The company targets its offerings at individuals, small/medium businesses, and enterprises that wish to use digital media and marketing services for varying purposes.\n\nValue Proposition\n\nAdobe offers three primary value propositions: accessibility, innovation, and brand/status.\n\nThe company creates accessibility by offering a wide variety of options.
