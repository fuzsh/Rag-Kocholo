        "text": "I'm currently VP, Technology at Apple, working with an incredibly talented team.\n\nPreviously I was CTO at Adobe, where I helped define and bring to life Creative Cloud for creative professionals, and Adobe Marketing Cloud for marketing professionals. I had joined Macromedia in 1996, and led its move to Web publishing, including the creation of Dreamweaver and a whole new generation of tools and technologies to advance expressiveness on the Web. Adobe acquired Macromedia in 2005.\n\nPrior to Adobe/Macromedia, I was with a startup called General Magic where I had the great opportunity to work with some of my heroes who had created the Mac, as well as with some amazing like-minded young engineers. We worked intensely to pioneer handheld personal communicators supporting multimedia email, network services, and mobile agents running on the network in the mid-1990s.\n\nEarlier, I was a Mac software developer. I helped develop the first Mac release of FrameMaker and then led their core technology team. Frame Technology was also acquired by Adobe. Prior to this, I helped establish one of the first Mac software startups in 1984.\n\nI began programming when I was young, and studied interactive computer graphics at the University of Illinois, working with artists and engineers in the Electronic Visualization Laboratory.\n\nFOUNDATION\n\nMany great thinkers developed the foundations that influence what we do today. Some that inspire me from early computing include:\n\nAs We May Think by Vannevar Bush (July 1945)\n\nMan-Computer Symbiosis & The Computer as a Communication Device by J.C.R.
