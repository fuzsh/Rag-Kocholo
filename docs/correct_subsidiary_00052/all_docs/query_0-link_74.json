        "text": "As I am typing this, 1000’s of companies across the world are actively disabling and uninstalling all instances of Adobe Flash. For Microsoft Windows 10 machines, Microsoft provided an update (KB4577586) that must be installed, to uninstall, its previously well-integrated 3rd party Adobe Flash product. Google Chrome Browsing already is removing it in its December 2020 update.\n\nIt was announced three years ago the day would come for the end of Flash, and here we are. Back in the day, I even dabbled in designing some flash components for use in websites. But luckily that was soon replaced with new web standards (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) which became the norm and are suitable for mobile devices, which Adobe Flash was not.\n\nSome brief history for you history buffs.\n\nThe internet was once a land of text blocks and dreary backgrounds. But everything changed in late 90’s when a company called Macromedia acquired an animation tool called FutureSplash and rebranded it as Macromedia Flash 1.0.\n\nThen In 2005, Adobe acquired Macromedia for $3.4B and set out to make it even more ubiquitous. The true downfall of Flash began in 2007, when Apple decided not to support it on the new iPhone. In 2010, Steve Jobs penned the famous open letter “Thoughts on Flash,” which laid out a viscious critique of the technology:\n\nRapid energy consumption\n\nPoor performance on mobile devices\n\nSecurity dependence on one company (Adobe) made it a huge risk\n\nFlash simply wasn’t made for the rising mobile world. And soon, new web standards (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) became the norm.\n\nFast forward to 2017 when Adobe announced it would discontinue Flash. It offically ended end of 2020 (Dec 31, 2020). Just like there are still pockets of Windows 7 devices out there, there will more likely be pockets of Flash for those applications that built around it vs the other way around.\n\nSo if your reading this and you haven’t yet, make sure to install Microsoft’s update (KB4577586) and the latest Google Chrome Browser to remove the security holes, Adobe Flash provides free of charge, to Windows devices.\n\nIn the past month, several antivirus companies have discovered a new ransomware variant known as Cryptolocker. Ransomware is a type of malware on the rise that holds your precious files hostage for money.\n\nIt does that by searching your computer and shares for popular file extensions and encrypts them preventing you from accessing them ever again unless you pay up.\n\nThis type of ransomware does not spread to other PCs or replicate by itself. This program needs your interaction to do its evil work. Ransomware needs you to launch the program on your PC. Of course, like phishing scams, It does this by trying to trick you into opening up some random attachment from a random email.\n\nThis attachment (could be a picture, zip file or other) contains the simple script to get it started doing its havoc on your PC.\n\nIf your PC gets infected then your files will more then likely be encrypted shortly after and will not be able to access them. It is impossible to decrypt the files without the private key.\n\nRead More\n\nHave you ever stopped and thought about how many online sites you visit that require a username and password?\n\nAccording to a study by Microsoft an average user has about 25 accounts that require passwords, and alarmingly types an average of 8 passwords per day. That was several years ago and it is much greater then that today.\n\nBecause of this a slew of products are available to help you “contain” all your username and passwords for online sites and they all can be accessed by one “master” password.\n\nWhy LastPass?\n\nI have used several similar products that provide this functionality but have found LastPass to be the best. I have used LastPass for several years now and it “manages” over 300 sites in my LastPass “Vault”.\n\nYes this number of sites is probably not the norm, but when you include: forums, online stores, email accounts, health accounts, financial accounts, business accounts, social media, etc…the accounts, usernames and passwords add up rather quickly. With LastPass I only have to remember ONE single password to access any of the sites securely.\n\nAs a technology engineer and business owner where everything is in the “cloud”, security is one of the most important aspects.\n\nSecure\n\nNo one at LastPass will ever have access to your sensitive information as it is 256-bit AES encrypted. The decryption occurs on your local device (PC, android, IOS etc..). And all data passing to the cloud uses SSL.\n\nRead More"
