But we don’t wait for the future, we create it.\n\nWe are builders, makers, and inventors, driven by a deep empathy for our customers and users.\n\nWe are open-minded and celebrate new ideas. We have the courage to disrupt the market and ourselves through bold bets and ideas we turn into reality.\n\nWe own the outcome.\n\nWe think and operate like owners. We take initiative, have a bias toward action, and assume ownership for end results, not just our part.\n\nWe are reliable and have clear points of view. We’re decisive and learn from our mistakes.\n\nWe raise the bar.\n\nWe aim high and we play to win. We relentlessly focus on execution, celebrate excellence and are intellectually honest about where we must do better.\n\nWe deliver both speed and quality by doing fewer things better. Our success is measured by the success of our customers and users.\n\nWe are genuine.\n\nThe ability to be yourself is core to who we are. We embrace and respect diversity.\n\nWe support and challenge each other by being honest and direct. We always act with sincerity, integrity and the highest of ethics.\n\nWe do this for our employees, partners, customers and communities."
