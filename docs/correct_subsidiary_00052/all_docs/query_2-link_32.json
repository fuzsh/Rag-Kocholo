        "text": "Adobe announced it is acquiring Workfront Inc. for $1.5 billion to add a collaboration tool to its marketing software by fitting into its Experience Cloud. The deal is expected to close sometime from December to February 2021, Adobe said Monday in a statement. Workfront, based in Lehi, Utah, will take its 3,000 corporate customers and 1 million users to the software maker best known for Photoshop.\n\nSuresh Vittal, VP of platform and product for Adobe Experience Cloud, said that the two companies often work together and encounter one another’s sales teams. As the pandemic has played out, it began to make more sense to bring in-house this kind of tooling that works well in a distributed environment. “The new normal distributed marketing team, distributed experience delivery teams, people having to work remotely — we started to see new use cases emerge around the idea of work management, around the idea of content velocity, around the idea of providing compliance and governance capabilities, so no asset escapes the organization, and it goes through this process of passing through creative and the marketing teams and getting out there and really representing your brand in the right way,” Vittal explained.\n\nWorkfront will be Adobe’s fifth-biggest acquisition, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The purchase marks the first major action by Anil Chakravarthy, an executive vice president, who joined Adobe in January after serving as chief executive officer of Informatica LLC. Chakravarthy said in an interview that Adobe and Workfront have more than 1,000 mutual clients. “Every customer that we talk to is investing more and more in digital marketing,” he said. “They want to get more efficiency out of digital marketing efforts. They want to get more agility and speed into their digital marketing efforts. As the investments grow, the amount of work involved in marketing is growing exponentially, and they really need a system to be able to manage work, so they get the right efficiency, productivity, and collaboration across their teams.”\n\nWorkfront has raised about $375 million to date, according to Crunchbase. Workfront said last year that it had generated $200 million in revenue in 2018."
