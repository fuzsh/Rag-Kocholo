        "text": "If you sell or give your Adobe software to an individual or business, you can transfer the license accordingly. Transferring the license allows the new owner to register the software in their name.\n\nImportant: Educational versions of Adobe-branded products are not eligible for a transfer of license. You can, however, transfer educational versions of Macromedia-branded products to a new owner.\n\nIf you transfer a license for a product suite, then the license applies to the entire suite of products. Individual products within a product suite are not eligible for a transfer of license.\n\nThe transfer of a license includes all versions of that product. If you sell or donate your registered copy of an Adobe product license, then you transfer your rights to all versions of that license as well.\n\nSupport contracts that are attached to a license do not transfer to the new licensee. Support contracts are legally nontransferable as specified in the terms and conditions of the contract.\n\nExcept in Germany, Adobe does not permit transfers for OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) versions of software.\n\nAfter Adobe receives the completed Transfer of License form from both parties, Adobe registers the software to the new owner. Registration ensures that Adobe recognizes the new owner as the legal licensee who can receive customer service and support.\n\nOnce both parties have submitted a Transfer of License form, allow three to four weeks for Adobe to process your license transfer request.\n\nEducational versions of Macromedia-branded products are eligible for a transfer of license. The new owner must provide proof of educational status to complete the transfer. If you are unable to provide a valid, current student ID that includes name, date, and a photo, then see Education/Students: How to buy. This page includes a list of education qualifications.\n\nAdobe acquired Macromedia in 2005. If you are the registered owner and you are transferring a Macromedia-branded product, it's required that you remove the software from your computer."
