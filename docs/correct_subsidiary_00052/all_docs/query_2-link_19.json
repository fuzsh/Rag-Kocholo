As we reported at the end of last month, the deal is worth $600 million in cash and adds a roster of new features to Adobe Marketing Cloud.\n\n“With the completion of the Neolane acquisition, Adobe’s lead in digital marketing is extended further, bringing critical cross-channel campaign management capabilities to the Adobe Marketing Cloud,” said Brad Rencher, senior vice president and general manager of Adobe’s Digital Marketing business, in a statement.\n\nFounded in 2001 and headquartered in Paris, France, Neolane has offices around Europe, North America and Asia and provides services for customers including Accor Hotels, Alcatel-Lucent, IKEA, Samsung, Sony and Dior.\n\nNeolane is the sixth product in Adobe Marketing Cloud’s suite, which also includes Analytics, Target, Social, Experience Manager and Media Optimizer. The acquisition of Neolane allows Adobe to add tools such as handling leads, marketing resource management, high-volume email marketing campaigns and a real-time offer recommendation engine. Adobe has been busy building out Marketing Cloud this summer–another major new feature is an interface that allows users to collaborate across all Marketing Cloud products."
