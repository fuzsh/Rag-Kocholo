        "text": "In April 1995, Real Networks released RealAudio, a proprietary audio format that offered the ability to stream audio to a plugin called the RealAudio player.\n\nYou would take your music and using their Real Producer to convert it to their format and then anyone who wanted to listen to it could download the player and go from there.\n\nIn 1997, they introduced the RealVideo format, so you could do the same with video.\n\nThe combination was also called RealMedia, but the latest version of Real Producer no longer creates the RealMedia format.\n\nThe BBC were heavy users of RealAudio until 2011.\n\nFutureWave was a company that made SmartSketch in 1993, a drawing package for pen devices running PenPoint OS, but when that failed, they ported it to Windows and Mac.\n\nAs the Internet became popular, they realised their vector animation tool could challenge Macromedia’s Shockwave system. In 1995, they modified their program to include frame-by-frame animation and called it FutureSplash and tried to sell it to Adobe, but they refused.\n\nMicrosoft used FutureSplash for it’s Online TV Network MSN; Disney used it for the animations in their subscription service Disney’s Daily Blast; Fox launched The Simpsons using FutureSplash.\n\nIn 1992, a merger between Authorware (a graphical programming system) and Macromind-Paracomp (the creators of Macromind Director) created Macromedia.\n\nMacromedia made a product they called Director, this was authoring software for creating interactive as well as kiosks. Authorware was used in learning environments. Macromedia made a plugin for Director called Shockwave that allowed anything created in Director to be displayed on a web browser.\n\nIn 1996, Macromedia acquired FutureWave software that created FutureSplash Animator, and animation tool designed for pen inputs. The plugin was considerably small to be installed into web browsers, so Macromedia renamed “Splash” to Flash, and Macromedia Flash was born.\n\nAdobe acquired Macromedia in 2005, and began to expand the capabilities of flash. They introduced Flash Video and 3D support.\n\nIn 2008, Adobe decided to create the Open Screen Project where they abolished the licencing fees for Flash and open it up for developers to use in their products.\n\nSince the primary use of Flash products were for a time when most people used dial-up modems and the advantage of Flash being quick to download to give an immersive experience had waned because the Internet had got faster, and the problem with the immersive experience meant that the user was trapped in their environment.\n\nThe mid 2000s saw the introduction of Cascading Style Sheets and Flash was driven by the video sites that were the precursor to YouTube.\n\nHowever, towards the end of the 2000s, the age of the smart phone appeared on the scene, gone was the simple web pages and it came browsers that could use the full features of the Internet. In 2010, Steve Jobs wrote a letter to Adobe saying they would not include Flash in any of their mobile devices citing the fact it would drain their batteries, Adobe knew that it was the beginning of the end for Flash.\n\nIn 2015, Adobe announced that Flash developers should switch to Adobe Animate and that all support for Flash would end in 2020."
