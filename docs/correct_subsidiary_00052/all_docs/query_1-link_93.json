T5 or not, you can always bill them as you would Canstock. Whether you receive the payment is another story. I suspect noone cares because they are not the end client. Whatever you charge will be refunded, so it's just extra paperwork with no net difference.\n\n« Reply #27 on: April 03, 2019, 07:47 »\n\n+1\n\nI can almost guarantee this is a reaction to Pond5.

However benign the intentions were here, I think this highlights an area which would really benefit from improvement in contributor communications.\n\nAt least two other agencies - Shutterstock and Alamy - provide clear explanations of what changed whenever the upload agreement/contributor terms of use are updated. As these documents are long and dense, it is hard otherwise to figure out what the changes are. They also send contributors email, as well as information on the contributor web site prior to requiring acceptance of the new terms.\n\nIt really helps to build trust with contributors when the agencies communicate with us over pricing, licensing and upload/contract changes.\n\nExamples, FYI\n\nShutterstock terms - note the helpful summaries of each section on the right\n\nhttps://submit.shutterstock.com/legal/terms\n\nSS summary of changes the last time they happened in 2015\n\nhttps://www.shutterstock.com/blog/2015-contributor-terms-of-service-updates\n\nAlamy's terms and their contract change record\n\nhttps://www.alamy.com/terms/contributor.asp\n\nhttps://www.alamy.com/terms/contributor-contract-changes.asp\n\nUncle Pete\n\nGreat Place by a Great Lake - My Home Port\n\n« Reply #36 on: April 03, 2019, 10:32 »\n\n0\n\nI can almost guarantee this is a reaction to Pond5.

But when it's collecting royalties, I believe this is exempt. (I am not purchasing a good or a service from them but collecting a royalty). They would collect GST from Canadian Buyers though.\n\nBUT they are lawfully required to give T-5's, but I am not sure it follows the same deadline of Feb 28 like T-4's.\n\nI did have this conversation with a long gone small Canadian stock company, they asked for invoices through Paypal to collect your percentage - they probably weren't big enough for mass pay and didn't want to incur extra fees. But they were pretty shocked to be asked that.\n\n« Reply #41 on: April 03, 2019, 18:11 »\n\n0\n\n9.1. Relationship. If you reside in the United States, your relationship is with Adobe Systems Incorporated, a United States company. If you reside outside of the United States, your relationship is with Adobe Canada Services Corporation, a Canadian company.\n\n[/i]\n\n.. now this is interesting... if we got our royalties with deduction, will someone from Adobe explain exact meaning of this...\n\nI can answer your because answer is pretty straightforward.\n\nDid you ever get 1042-s forms?\n\nNo\n\nNow read this (just first 8 words)\n\nhttps://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/who-must-file\n\n[/quote]\n\nThat does not explain it at all. It sounds like Adobe has a subsidiary that is incorporated in Canada, and all payments to non-US photographers are from the Canadian company. That means the recipients should all be filling out Canadian tax forms, not US tax forms.\n\n« Reply #42 on: April 04, 2019, 01:48 »\n\n+1\n\nThat does not explain it at all.

On adobestock site, we have w8ben form to fill and 30% of our US based earning taken away or \"withheld\". Canadian companies dont have legitimate right to act as US withholding agent.\n\nIf AS take 30% of US based earning (and they do), demand w8 forms (and they do), they are not canadian but us based company, and in that case they MUST provide 1042s forms as not only tax return, but as evidence that IRS have even \"seen\" that money. Understand now?\n\nIn this case, after June 2018, all non us based contributors, have to get all money that was \"withheld\" back to their account balance.\n\n« Reply #43 on: April 04, 2019, 03:25 »\n\n+5\n\nBelow the page with new terms.

We believe Adobe Stock will continue to grow and evolve to become the #1 destination and that contributing directly will provide the best benefit to you and to our customers.\n\nMake sense?\n\nThanks,\n\nDennis\n\n« Reply #49 on: April 04, 2019, 13:02 »\n\n+3\n\n...As a result, also all existing contributors had to accept the terms of use dated June 2018 upon login to the portal.\n\nKirsten,\n\nThank you for explaining the background of this login surprise for contributors.

You haven't got time to read minute complicated documents on the fly, but you have to check the box regardless, it was a cheap trick and unnecessary. Not solid feedback maybe, but in lieu of an apology, which Kirsten didn't quite manage, it's what you get.\n\nRelated Topics\n\nSubject / Started by Replies Last post\n\nSV subscription terms\n\nStarted by hatman12 SnapVillage.com\n\n3 Replies\n\n4293 Views October 04, 2007, 17:27\n\nby epixx\n\nMoneybookers - changes in terms of use\n\nStarted by madelaide Microstock Services\n\n4 Replies\n\n7458 Views November 11, 2009, 17:11\n\nby madelaide\n\nNew Envato terms - what is different?\n\nStarted by pancaketom PhotoDune\n\n2 Replies\n\n4740 Views April 30, 2014, 18:01\n\nby Jo Ann Snover\n\nAdobe have updated their terms of use\n\nStarted by dragonblade Adobe Stock\n\n4 Replies\n\n1331 Views February 21, 2024, 08:03\n\nby SuperPhoto\n\nChange to Adobe terms & conditions outrages many professionals\n\nStarted by The Mighty Jungle General Stock Discussion\n\n16 Replies\n\n2065 Views June 13, 2024, 23:39\n\nby Uncle Pete\n\nSponsors\n\nMicrostock Poll Results\n\nSponsors"
