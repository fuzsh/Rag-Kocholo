        "text": "The productivity tools of the future will be web-based, multi-player, and infused with a new generation of capabilities for creative expression that Adobe is uniquely positioned to provide. This is the mission we’re on with Adobe Express. Figma, with their introduction of FigJam, entered the exciting (and dynamic!) whiteboarding and ideation space. By bringing together capabilities for brainstorming, content creation and collaboration, we have an opportunity to provide communicators, knowledge workers, and creators with a new generation of productivity tools.\n\nFigma has built a phenomenal team, product and community and we want to preserve this. I’ve been talking to Dylan, Figma’s co-founder and CEO, for a few months and have left every conversation inspired by our shared vision, passion and purpose. Dylan will continue running the business with autonomy and we’ll work closely with him and the team to bring the very best of Adobe to solve customer problems, unlock new creative capabilities using our core technology, and continue Figma’s success in market. We have no plan to change Figma’s prices. We also share their commitment to education; their products will remain free for students and educators.\n\nTo Dylan and the entire Figmate family and community: welcome! I joined Adobe through the acquisition of Macromedia. I felt immediately welcomed and empowered to participate in shaping the future of Adobe. We learned a lot from each other and a lot from our communities – and in the process, created a better Adobe. Sixteen years later, I’m still inspired by our mission to unlock the creative potential in everyone. I can’t wait to work with all of you as we imagine a bold future together.\n\nIn addition to historical information, this communication contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities law, including statements regarding the expected timing, completion and effects of the proposed transaction, product plans, future growth, market opportunities, strategic initiatives, industry positioning, and customer acquisition and retention.
