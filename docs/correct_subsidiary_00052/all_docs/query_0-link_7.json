        "text": "Adobe acquired Macromedia in 2005. Based on your post, it sounds like you are using the last known Macromedia version of Flash for that year which was Flash 8. Operating systems have come a long way since then and it's very likely you are experiencing bugs based on how old that software is and how new your OS likely is. Unless you are simply referring to Adobe as \"Macromedia\" for some other unknown reason.\n\nSo, what version of Flash (rebranded as Animate many years ago) are you actually using? What platform? What kid of bugs are you seeing?\n\nAlternative software requires your own research honestly. These are peer-to-peer Adobe forums and you may not get first hand advice for alternate software. A simple google search will yield several results. I do hear great things about DaVinci Resolve however.\n\nAnimator and content creator for Animate CC"
