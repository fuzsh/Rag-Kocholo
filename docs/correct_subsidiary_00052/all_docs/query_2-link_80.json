        "text": "For years, Adobe has dominated the design industry.\n\nHowever, a lot of analysts saw the design-software startup Figma as a real threat, in part because of its double annual recurring income.\n\nAccording to a company press release, Adobe put a significant wager on the future of design by announcing plans to purchase Figma for $20 billion, eliminating its largest competitor in the process.\n\nFigma, founded in 2012 by Dylan Field and Evan Wallace, had a simple thesis: Web-based apps facilitate collaboration between people better than desktop programs like Adobe Photoshop.\n\nAdobe made a 2x offer to buy the business on the premise that web-first collaborative design platforms will be the way of the future. We see that with the rise of websites like Canva.\n\nAdobe’s extravagant spending may have more to do with fear than wise business decisions. Figma is in direct competition with Adobe’s XD software. Adobe is eating it rather than fighting it. Investors are concerned that the company is paying too much out of desperation to eliminate competitors, and I’m inclined to agree.\n\nAdobe’s two-birds, one stone strategy"
