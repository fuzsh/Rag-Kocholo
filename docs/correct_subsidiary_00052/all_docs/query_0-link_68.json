Articulate wasn’t the juggernaut that it is today, and aside from learning how to program Flash, Macromedia Captivate was your next best option. During those years there weren’t many other alternatives.\n\neLearning Development: What’s new in Flash CS4?\n\nUpside Learning\n\nAdobe’s CS4 suite is the second major release since Adobe acquired Macromedia. The new Adobe CS4 suite has some new exciting and time-saving features in all its products.

LTG, Macromedia, Adobe, and Smart ideas (for the most part) LTG acquiring Rustici (makers of the SCORM engine and Watershed LRS, among other items) is a great idea. At the time, I hated it.\n\nThe Open Screen Project – Will It Succeed?\n\nUpside Learning\n\nAlso there are strong reasons for HTML 5 not being able to replace Flash as pointed out by a former Macromedia person Jeremy Allaire in this article.

Rapid elearning development software changed the game.\n\nAdobe Captivate Prime: Adobe's Best LMS Effort to Date\n\nThe Logical Blog by IconLogic\n\nThis workflow has been around for over 10 years from Adobe (well, technically Presedia, then Macromedia, and then Adobe Systems).

However, if you have to prioritize Flash vs. HTML 5 vs. ??? then I would put learning Flash (especially scripting in Flash) way down on priority list at this point. These things do eventually die out. How valuable are your Authorware scripting skills at this point?\n\nThe King is Dead\n\neLearning 24-7\n\nThe weapons including Authorware, Macromedia Director, DazzlerMax, Toolbook were the ones that separated the knights from the common folk. Eventually the land saw Macromedia Breeze and Dreamweaver enter the lands, with these items called templates.\n\nInnovators' Dilemma in Learning/eLearning\n\nTony Karrer\n\nDoes anyone from Saba, SumTotal, Adobe/Macromedia/eHelp, Lectora, etc. The fact that the discussion around Product Vendor Blogs and Innovation came back that it may be there but is hidden suggests that they aren't going to be the source. What will be the source?\n\nTechsmith Camtasia Studio 8\n\nSteve Howard\n\nIt has been a few years since Adobe/Macromedia’s software releases have generated such a buzz in the Community.
