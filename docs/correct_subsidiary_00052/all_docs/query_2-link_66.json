        "text": "It seems like yesterday that we received the news of Adobe acquiring Figma. Yet, on September the 15th, 2022, Adobe announced its merger agreement to acquire the renowned collaborative design platform. A year later, what were the effects of Figma's acquisition? Has it really changed? We'll analyze the innovations and changes this merger brought and how these affected the business and the design worlds. Let's jump right into it!\n\nIf you're new to this topic, don't worry! You can take a look at our article about the beginnings of this business titans' joint venture. To refresh our memory, let's start by recapping how Adobe's bought was at first before delving into what has changed.\n\nHow Was The Process of Adobe Acquiring Figma?\n\nAdobe completed the acquisition of Figma for an estimated $20 billion in September 2022. The deal was structured equally between cash and stock, with Figma's CEO and staff receiving roughly 6 million additional restricted stock units. These stock units will mature four years after the transaction's completion. Further, Dylan Field, Figma's Co-Founder and CEO, keeps leading the Figma team while reporting to David Wadhwani, Adobe's Digital Media President.\n\nIn business terms, Adobe saw Figma as a strategic investment that would significantly impact its future. The purchase helped to expand Adobe's product line by incorporating Figma's web-based collaborative capabilities and speeding up the delivery of Adobe's Creative Cloud technology on the web.\n\nAdobe's Changes on Figma's Settings\n\nAfter a year of integration, it's time to take stock of this acquisition's impact on the design landscape. Many questions might arise regarding this topic since such a significant acquisition was alarming for some users when it launched. That's why, to make things clear, here are some of the most recent changes Adobe did to Figma:\n\nIntegration and Synergy. The interoperability between Figma and Adobe's design software suite has proven to be a game-changer for many designers, unlocking new levels of collaborative creativity and streamlining workflows. With this integration, designers can transition between platforms seamlessly, resulting in a more efficient and fluid design process.\n\nFunctionality and Features. Figma has seen a surge in innovation post-acquisition, with many new functionalities on the platform. From advanced prototyping to robust design systems, Figma expanded its toolkit to offer unprecedented precision and creativity. In its Figma Config 2023, we witnessed features such as Variables and DevMode while also several upgrades in its well-known Autolayout. Not only do all these advances enhance teamwork among designers, but they also bring development teams to the table to truly honor the spirit of collaborative work!\n\nCommunity and Collaboration. The acquisition has significantly impacted the Figma community as it has grown and strengthened. This integration with Adobe has allowed for a broader network of designers, enabling enhanced collaboration and knowledge-sharing. Adding several of Adobe's collaborative features cemented Figma as a platform that fosters teamwork and creativity, enhancing seamless joint work.\n\nHow Has Figma's Acquisition Impacted Adobe's Business?\n\nBeyond its significant role for UX/UI designers and teams worldwide, Adobe's acquisition of Figma has significantly impacted Adobe's business.\n\nFirst, it undoubtedly expanded its product portfolio. Adobe's purchase of Figma has broadened its product range, incorporating Figma's collaborative, web-based capabilities, resulting in an accelerated delivery of Adobe's Creative Cloud technologies on the web.\n\nAlso, Adobe has significantly cemented its market position in design software following the acquisition, reflecting its investment in cutting-edge tech and product offerings.\n\nAnother significant edge of this merger was the elimination of competition it brought. By blending both companies' business proposals, Adobe cut one of its major competitors in the software landscape.\n\nIt was such an acquisition that, in June 2023, Adobe discontinued its own Adobe XD for purchase as a single application from its store. Nonetheless, it still offers technical and customer support for its in-house prototyping tool!\n\nWhat Does The Future of Figma Look Like?\n\nA year has passed, and we can say this acquisition will keep bringing many benefits and opportunities for Figma. After all, the purchase was also a market expansion opportunity for Figma as well! Adobe was founded 30 years before Figma (1982 vs. 2012), giving the first a more consolidated customer base, community, and even a solid presence in specific regions or industries that perhaps weren't even on Figma's business strategy plans. Hence, this increased reach will drive more revenue and improvement opportunities for Figma.\n\nNonetheless, as we all might know, acquisitions can be challenging and bring uncertainty. Figma has done a remarkable job at staying true to its core values despite the merger, yet ensuring a smooth transition and maintaining its services' standards will be key to not only attracting new users but also taking care of its existing user base.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAfter Adobe acquired Figma, the design landscape underwent a huge transformation. However, Figma was seamlessly integrated into Adobe's ecosystem, providing more efficient and creative teamwork. With new features and functionalities, teams have an expanded toolkit that improves their work quality. This alliance between Figma and Adobe seems particularly promising, and we look forward to seeing how it keeps evolving!"
