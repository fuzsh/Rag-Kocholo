        "text": "Marketo is now officially part of the Adobe family, after acquiring the martech company for $US4.75 billion.\n\nAnnounced in September, the deal brings together strengthens Adobe’s B2B play and appeal to mid-market customers. It also helps dobe compete against rival marketing clouds Oracle and Salesforce.\n\nWith the acquisition now closed, Marketo CEO Steve Lucas will continue to lead the Marketo team as part of Adobe’s Digital Experience business, reporting to Brad Rencher, executive vice president and general manager, Digital Experience.\n\n“Marketo is the long-standing leader in B2B marketing,” said Steve Lucas, CEO, Marketo. “As a part of Adobe, we see an extraordinary opportunity to further accelerate Marketo’s momentum and deliver combined value to marketers around the world.\n\nMarketo Engagement Platform will become part of Adobe Marketing Cloud, a suite of software products designed to help marketers manage, optimise and activate their campaigns across multiple channels.\n\nWhen the deal was announced Gartner analyst Chris Ross described the deal as strategically sensible but warned the acquisition will require time to integrate and the impact of the deal will play out over a long horizon.\n\n“There will likely be some quick-hit integration, or shared technology opportunities. For example, it would make sense to see Adobe’s Sensei AI capabilities quickly integrated to power enhanced features within the Marketo platform. I would expect to see other quick snap-in, snap-on technology integrations in the near-term,” he said.\n\nRencher said the addition of Marketo will help Adobe deliver on its vision to “reimagine customer experience management.”\n\n“The combination of Adobe Experience Cloud and Marketo’s Engagement Platform provides an unrivaled set of solutions for delivering transformative customer experiences across industries and companies of all sizes—making every business an experience business,” Rencher said."
