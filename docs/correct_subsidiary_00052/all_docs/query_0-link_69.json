It seems that they’re about to enter the web app contest now, planting their flag on the same fields as Google, MSN, Zoho and the rest. What interests me most is their online word processor, Buzzword, recently acquired from Virtual Ubiquity; reports are that it’s heads, if not heads and shoulders, above the competition; but alas it’s what I call a transpiring beta and I’ve only just now sent in my email request for an account, with nothing leaking my way yet out of the system.\n\nIn the meantime, I’m playing with Adobe’s Share, a place where you can lodge files and either share them with the world or with only a select few. You can ship out email invites to your chosen few, publish the URL how you will, or, as I tried to do here, embed a preview in a website. I’ve uploaded a JPEG, showing certain Toronto Slawyers enjoying themselves at a recent wine and cheese, and a PDF, an article “Thinking Like a Lawyer” by Jane Gionfriddo. You may find that the preview doesn’t work — this is a beta, after all — but clicking on the image or using the menu provided will take you to Adobe Share and the documents themselves."
