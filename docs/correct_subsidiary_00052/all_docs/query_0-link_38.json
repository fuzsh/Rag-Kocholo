        "text": "Adobe Flash Player\n\nThe ubiquitous Adobe Flash Player, mainstay of popular browser-based games and animations which peaked during the early 2000s. Includes titles such as Bloons Tower Defense, QWOP and N.\n\nFirst released by FutureWave as “FutureSplash Animator” 1) in 1993, who offered to sell the platform to Adobe Systems in 1995. Adobe initially declined the offer. It didn't really start gaining traction until FutureWave was acquired by Macromedia in 1996, who then renamed the platform to “Macromedia Flash Player”. In an ironic series of events, Adobe then acquired Macromedia, and ended up inheriting the entire Macromedia product line which included their Flash player. Adobe continued development of it from 2005 and the rest is history.\n\nTools to develop Flash media were fleshed out and widely available, encouraging professional studios and amateur devs alike to develop software using it. Popular sites such as Newgrounds, Miniclip and Armor Games would host almost exclusively Flash-based content. Most browser came with built-in or easy to install plugins to play Flash media, and it being one of the most easily accessible and portable platforms, it quickly rose to be the standard for interactive web applications. YouTube initially used Flash to play their videos.\n\nAs web browser engines and JavaScript matured, Flash's functionality was seen as redundant and development slowed down on the platform. Due to this, and the increasing security flaws, Adobe officially deprecated Flash in 2017 and opted to focus on the Adobe Air platform. Flash support was removed from most mainstream browsers circa 2021. 2)"
