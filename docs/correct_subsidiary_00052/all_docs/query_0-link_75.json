        "text": "Hi,\n\nAdobe Flex is a collection of technologies released by Adobe Systems for the development and deployment of cross-platform rich Internet applications based on the proprietary Adobe Flash platform. The initial release in March 2004 by Macromedia included a software development kit, an IDE, and a J2EE integration application known as Flex Data Services. Since Adobe acquired Macromedia in 2005, subsequent releases of Flex no longer require a license for Flex Data Services, which has become a separate product rebranded as LiveCycle Data Services.\n\nPat please help me understand in what ways you want to compare Flex with SRM.?\n\nSRM is a complete ERP product where as Flex i kind of add-on.\n\nThanks\n\nZameer Sayed"
