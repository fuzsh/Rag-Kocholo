You will also see the organization's path and can determine the organization's placement within the hierarchy. For example, in the screenshot, the admin is a member of the organization Athletic Shoe Division and this organization's Global Admin Console path is ACME HQ > Athletic Shoe Division, where Athletic Shoe Division is a child of the organization ACME HQ.\n\nIn the event of a security incident involving our software solutions, notifications are sent to the appropriate compliance officers. To help ensure prompt notification, as a System admin, you must specify who your security, data protection, and compliance officers are. For details, see Privacy and security contacts.\n\nUsing console settings you can add custom notes for your end users to communicate with them about how to get assistance if they encounter issues or require support.\n\nChoose a default email language for your organization, to receive emails about the account statuses, such as subscription changes or credit card expiration. If you have a teams membership purchased directly from Adobe, you can change your team name from the Console Settings.\n\nAsset settings give an organization control over how its employees share its assets outside the organization. Asset Settings are used along with other organizational policy enforcement systems (not provided by Adobe) to ensure that assets are only shared with appropriate external individuals and organizations."
