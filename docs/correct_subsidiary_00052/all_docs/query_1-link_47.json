        "text": "So popular in the digital world, many people may have heard of it, but don’t really know what Adobe is. Adobe has numerous products and ways of using them, which go beyond the PDF tool and the Photoshop program. And to enjoy the services offered and understand a little more about the rise of the brand over time, check out the complete post with everything you need to know about Adobe.\n\nAdobe History\n\nAdobe Systems Incorporated, known simply as Adobe, is nothing more than a company responsible for developing software. Created in 1982 in California, USA, and founded by Charles Geschke and John Warnock, Adobe was born with the purpose of making physical copies of computer texts and images. And of course this has brought about a revolution in desktop publishing.\n\nThe first product was created the same year the company was founded: PostScript, a programming language, which made visual information available to a device. It is worth remembering that at this time there were dot-matrix printers (the most used, which drew with dots); and plotters (for graphical, high-resolution results). Within two years, the revenue was already more than $2 million.\n\nIn 1987, the first program appeared : Illustrator, and from then on the company has only grown. Photoshop, Premiere, Adobe Acrobat and Reader, PageMaker etc. are just some of the successful programs created by the company.\n\nIn 2003, the Adobe Package was created, which brought together the main programs for editing images, videos, and diagramming, with the aim of making life easier for the professional who deals with these services.\n\nStarting in 2008, Adobe decided to expand its niche. From software developer, it bet on data, real-time information analysis, and with this, in 2020, it had a turnover of $3.4 billion, according to Forbes. The company has more than 17,000 employees, working around the world, and in Brazil, its headquarters are in São Paulo.\n\nToday, the company has 3 main technology pillars\n\nDocument Cloud\n\nCreative Cloud\n\nExperience Cloud\n\nWhat is the Adobe Suite?\n\nThe Adobe package was created in 2003, and can be defined as a set of software developed by the company, going from one end to the other, from creation, editing and post-production of videos and images. And the most interesting of all is that this package makes it possible to migrate, i.e. transfer images, videos or any other type of document from one platform to another.\n\nCurrently, the package is called Creative Cloud and consists of more than 20 applications for photography, video, design, web, user experience, and social networks, as well as color palettes and font families. In addition to Creative Cloud, we have Adobe Experience Cloud and Document Cloud.\n\nUnderstanding Adobe Experience Cloud, Creative Cloud and Document Cloud\n\nAdobe Experience Cloud\n\nThe Adobe Experience Cloud, as the name suggests, provides services and experiences for customers, bringing engagement to your e-commerce. And of course you need to know it when it comes time to create your online store from scratch.\n\nExperience Cloud brings unique experiences to your customers, focusing on engagement and personalized user experience. Its applications and services help your e-commerce to leverage sales in many ways, it is an integrated end-to-end digital experience suite that offers customer-facing tools focusing on public data insights, content and marketing automation, e-commerce, customer journey, digital signup and more!\n\nWhen you purchase the license, you get access to the following applications:\n\nAdobe Commerce\n\nAdobe Experience Manager Sites\n\nAdobe Experience Manager Assets\n\nAdobe Experience Manager Screens\n\nAdobe Experience Manager Forms\n\nAdobe Analytics\n\nAdobe Customer Journey Analytics\n\nAdobe Real-Time CDP\n\nAdobe Audience Manager\n\nAdobe Target\n\nAdobe Campaign\n\nAdobe Journey Optimizer\n\nAdobe Marketo Engage\n\nAdobe Advertising\n\nAdobe Workfront\n\nCreative Cloud\n\nAdobe Creative Cloud has applications, web services and other creative resources such as: photography, graphic design, video editing, UX design, drawing and painting, social networking, etc.\n\nBy purchasing this package, you get access to: Photoshop, Illustrator, Acrobat DC, Premiere Pro, InDesign, and Adobe Express.\n\nThese applications, together with Adobe Experience Cloud and Adobe E-commerce are the tripod of your online store’s success, which when implemented and used correctly, guarantee the best performance for your virtual business.\n\nDocument Cloud\n\nFinally, Adobe Document Cloud brings solutions for PDF and electronic signature. The package includes: Adobe Acrobat, Acrobat Sign, Acrobat PDF Pack, Acrobat Export PDF and mobile apps (Adobe Acrobat Reader, Adobe Scan and Adobe Fill & Sign).\n\nLearn about the main Adobe Products available\n\nThe main software that comes in the Adobe suite are must-haves for anyone working in photography, video, and other areas of technology when it comes to Creative Cloud. For the digital experience products related to the Adobe Experience Cloud package, we will look at the most commonly used, and especially at Adobe Commerce, formerly the Magento platform (enterprise version), which has everything that is indispensable for creating a secure, flexible and scalable online store.\n\nAdobe Commerce\n\nA world leader in innovation for digital commerce, the Adobe Commerce platform is used by 1 in 4 existing online stores. Enjoy advanced, out-of-the-box features with numerous available functionalities and capabilities that can be added as e-commerce demands new solutions.\n\nBroadly speaking, it is a multi-channel commerce platform that aims to provide exceptional shopping experiences for any business model and any type of consumer.\n\nThe platform handles around $155 billion in transactions annually. There is no other technology that delivers the same experience, flexibility, and scalability of online shopping. To learn more about the differentiators of the Adobe Commerce platform, please visit.\n\nPhotoshop\n\nPhotoshop is a two-dimensional image editor that is considered to be the market leader in professional image editors. It has gone through 14 editions and is now called Adobe Photoshop Creative Cloud.\n\nIn the past, the purpose of the program was basically to edit photos that would be used in printed material. Nowadays, the program allows infinite adjustments, from the simple lighting of an image to the development of the entire visual part of an advertising campaign, for example.\n\nIt is perhaps the darling of the stars, because it eliminates all imperfections. Photoshop is so popular that many people have even verbalized the word. “Photoshopping” is used a lot when we are going to work with image editing.\n\nAdobe Experience Manager\n\nAdobe Experience Manager combines digital asset management with the power of a content management system to deliver personalized experiences faster.\n\nThe platform has several functionalities, such as Experience Manager Sites, which creates and manages your digital experience across all channels with automated tools that make it easy to scale; Experience Manager Assets, which offers intelligent automation tools to quickly provision, adapt and distribute your assets across audiences and channels; and Experience Manager Forms, which performs registration and digital forms; and also Experience Manager Screens that seamlessly connects online and physical experiences with screens and digital signage built on the industry’s best content and experience management platform. All these resources operate in cloud service, i.e., in the cloud with maximum performance, optimal service level agreements, and enterprise-class security.\n\nAdobe Marketo Engage\n\nThe platform is a marketing hub that integrates all your systems with artificial intelligence, marketing automation, lead engagement, and helps deliver inputs to the sales team. In other words, this tool allows you to simplify, automate, and measure marketing tasks and workflows to increase operational efficiency and revenue.\n\nThrough Marketo Engage, it is possible to follow customers anywhere, interacting online and offline, including e-mails, social networks, paid media, SMS, and events. In addition, the tool delivers personalized content at the right time using detailed profiles, real-time behavioral and demographic data, and the power of AI to personalize web experiences, landing pages, and emails.\n\nIt also allows sales and marketing teams to create more coordinated journeys by running marketing data directly into CRM, lead generation/scoring, and account management. Finally, it checks the effectiveness of each type of content and whether your customer journeys are working with advanced journey and marketing analytics, which connect sales and marketing data to give an overview of the entire customer journey.\n\nReal Time CDP\n\nThis is one of the great things about the Adobe Experience Cloud ecosystem, with CDP, you create real, personalized segmentations with known data from your system with the behavior of your online consumers.\n\nAdobe Real-Time CDP is advanced data management, built primarily for marketers.\n\nWith this tool, marketing and IT teams can see beyond what the data has to offer in real-time. The Adobe Real-Time Customer Data Platform enables marketers to collect, normalize, and govern B2B and B2C data and unify it into real-time profiles that can be activated on any channel.\n\nAdobe Target\n\nThrough artificial intelligence, Adobe Target creates and optimizes large-scale A/B tests in a simple way. The tool ensures full utilization of all customer behavioral data and the implementation of strategies that help achieve business goals.\n\nWith a powerful personalization engine, it allows you to deliver personalized content based on algorithms to determine the right digital experience to suit an individual in real time, no matter where that interaction takes place. In addition, it assists in eliminating assumptions using A/B and multivariate testing to learn the most effective combination of content, layout, UX and more across websites and other digital properties.\n\nAdobe Analytics\n\nAdobe Analytics is a tool that merges, joins, and analyzes data from any stage in the customer journey, turning large streams of web data into useful, real-time insights.\n\nThrough artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other advanced technologies, features such as efficient attribution to know what happens at each conversion and invest in the most appropriate way; artificial intelligence and machine learning to reveal opportunities and answers for everyone in one click; and predictive analytics, which performs anomaly detection, performs contribution analysis, and issues intelligent alerts.\n\nIn this way, Adobe Analytics is an ally in helping to get a complete picture of the customer.\n\nLightroom\n\nKnown as Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, the software was created with the goal of quickly editing and storing digital photos. Lightroom also manipulates images, from organizing them in folders to editing and post-production.\n\nThe difference is that Photoshop edits images at the pixels, making definite changes, while Lightroom generates information so that the image is masked with another color, making it less heavy. In this way it is possible to maintain the original characteristics of the image.\n\nSince Lightroom does not have some editing functions, such as cropping, overlays, merges, and other features, it is best suited for beginners in the image editing business. Having mastered it, it is recommended to migrate to Photoshop.\n\nIllustrator\n\nThe first program created by Adobe, Illustrator is a vector graphics editor. As the name suggests, it develops illustrations, and is widely used by designers.\n\nThe tool is also widely used for making logos, as well as all the vectorial part of websites, campaigns, and printed material. It is also possible to create animations in Illustrator, but in this case the image is made in Illustrator, and then sent to After Effects to be animated.\n\nAfter Effects\n\nAfter Effects is a software package responsible for creating motion graphics and visual effects, and is widely used in post-production for video, film, DVD, and Flash productions.\n\nWith it, you can create an animation from scratch or import images in static vector format. In addition, with this program, we can create vignettes, special effects, graphic elements, as well as manipulate colors.\n\nKnown as the Photoshop of video, it also integrates with other software such as Illustrator, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, etc.\n\nPremiere\n\nAdobe Premiere is a professional video editor, very similar to After Effects. The difference is in the type of video: Premiere edits non-linear video, while After edits animations, all in motion.\n\nPremiere has two features: for beginners and for those who already have experience with the tool. In this second case, it is possible to manipulate specific parts of the video divided into categories such as audio, narration, soundtrack, and video.\n\nIn Design\n\nInDesign is software for page layout and organization, which has come to replace PageMaker. InDesign is the preferred program of desktop publishers and journalists, because it is responsible for putting together all the graphics for books, magazines, packaging, printed newspapers, etc. With it, you can also insert animations and sound and visual features, and export the document for printing.\n\nWith the advance of online reading platforms such as PDF and e-books, the program has also been updated, making it possible to create beautiful pages by means of layouts geared to the development of digital materials.\n\nStock\n\nStock is nothing more than a bank that provides images, vectors, graphics and illustrations for use by designers and other professionals. And the interesting thing is that all these available features can be used in conjunction with other Adobe tools, and you don’t have to pay a license fee to use the image bank.\n\nDreamweaver\n\nDreamweaver is software that allows you to create a website using drag-and-drop, making it perfect for anyone who wants to develop or edit website layouts without having to create programming code. Although it does not require that much programming, it does require a minimum of knowledge in the area to work with the program.\n\nMoreover, it supports the main programming languages on the market, automatically creating the codes during the layout preparation, not to mention that Dreamweaver is responsive, i.e. it is possible to adapt the site to the mobile version.\n\nAcrobat\n\nWidely known, Acrobat consists of a set of features responsible for reading or converting PDF files. Among its functions, Acrobat is able to: convert files to PDF; read PDFs; produce PDF documents from a physical copy; and create 3D documents.\n\nWEBJUMP: The leading Brazilian Adobe Commerce Gold Partner in Latin America\n\nWEBJUMP was created, in 2007, with the intention of developing websites and portals. However, in 2011, we created our first Magento E-commerce – already in the enterprise version – for Caçula de Pneus, an official Pirelli reseller, and since then we have only evolved, so much so that today we are the largest and main Brazilian Adobe Gold Partner and the only one with the Specialized Commerce seal in Latin America. In addition, we have the largest number of certified developers of the brand.\n\nThe Magento platform became Adobe Commerce – except for the open source version – and, with so many awards and certifications we received for our excellence work, we were recognized as leaders in the segment of enterprise project development, with the best technology available in the market; therefore, today, we are official Adobe partners.\n\nThe platform continues to be our main tool when people come to us, whether to acquire the Adobe license, to hire our team to create a specific e-commerce, or to have squads and support 100% dedicated to a project. Flexibility, scalability, and security are our pillars to deliver excellence and value in the projects developed for our clients."
