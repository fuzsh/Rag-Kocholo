        "text": "Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald:\n\nWhy do you have to be such a smart-ass?\n\nSheridan Crane:\n\nWhen I'm around you, SOMEONE has to be smart.\n\nIvy Winthrop Crane:\n\nYou know, there is an old Chinese proverb that says, 'Man who talks with fake Chinese accent, man with something to hide.'\n\nJulian Crane:\n\nThere's another Chinese proverb that says 'Wife like you can go to HELL.'\n\nGwen Hotchkiss:\n\nWhat do I have to do to get you to admit what's going on here, Ethan? Walk in on you and Theresa in bed making love? What's she going to tell me then, huh? That she was just fluffing your pillows and just happened to slip underneath you?\n\nIvy Winthrop Crane:\n\nYou were always so good in the kitchen. I wish I'd taken \"Home Ec\" in school.\n\nGrace Bennett:\n\nOh well you were probably too busy cramming for \"How to Be a B*tch 101.\"\n\nIvy Winthrop Crane:\n\nYou know Grace, you're usually so passive I'd forgotten that you had any wit.\n\nGrace Bennett:\n\nI wouldn't worry about it. Because I hear that memory loss is common in menopausal women.\n\nSheridan Crane:\n\nAren't you freezing out here without your coat on?\n\nLuis Lopez-Fitzgerald:\n\nI was just gonna go out and chop some fire wood... It's one of two things you can do, in this kinda weather to keep warm.\n\nSheridan Crane:\n\nWhat's the other?\n\nLuis Lopez-Fitzgerald:\n\nOh... it's a guy joke.\n\nSheridan Crane:\n\n...Oh, I get it.\n\n[Tabitha imagines being burned alive while Kay, Miguel, Pilar, Eve, T.C., Sam, Grace, and Charity watch]\n\nFather Lonigan:\n\nI condemn you to death for being an evil witch.\n\n[sprays her with holy water; Tabitha screams]\n\nFather Lonigan:\n\nThat's for all the times you called me Father \"Blind as a Bat.\"\n\n[laughs maniacally]\n\nFather Lonigan:\n\nAll right, fellas, nuke her!\n\n[Miguel, T.C., and Sam slowly push her into the furnace while the women nurse Endora]\n\nTabitha Lenox:\n\nWait, what about my baby?\n\nGrace Bennett:\n\nOh, don't worry. We're going to teach her to be good.\n\nCharity Standish:\n\nI'm going to take her to mass every day.\n\nTabitha Lenox:\n\nOh, no!\n\nGrace Bennett:\n\nAnd I'm going to teach her to make tomato soup cake.\n\nTabitha Lenox:\n\nNo, no, no!\n\n[to Luis]\n\nSheridan Crane:\n\nI trusted you to get Marty back for me. But you failed me. You not only failed me, but you failed our son. And now Marty is with Beth, a maniacal freak, who not only stole my child, but proved you to be the world's biggest fool!\n\n[Fancy pleads with Ivy for the Bennetts to attend Alistair's New Year's party]\n\nIvy Winthrop Crane:\n\nThat ad gives me the willies and we are *not* attending his murder.\n\nNoah Bennett:\n\n[smiling] Actually, when you put it like that...\n\nIvy Winthrop Crane:\n\nNoah!\n\n[In the Roman catacombs, Chad and Luis find a switch that activates a trapdoor]\n\nLuis Lopez-Fitzgerald:\n\nJust like in Indiana Jones.\n\nChad:\n\nWatch what you say. We don't want a giant ball rolling after us.\n\nSheridan Crane:\n\n[Sheridan is possessed] Theresa must die. I must kill her.\n\n\"The Creature\":\n\nFabulous! Let's go do it now while you're in the mood. I happen to know she's up in the mansion. We'll sneak in, find the b*tch, and I'll keep an eye out while you kill her!\n\nSheridan Crane:\n\nTheresa must die!\n\n\"The Creature\":\n\nYes... so, how do you wanna do it? Stab her? Choke her? Drown her? Shove her out of a window? What?\n\nSheridan Crane:\n\nI'll decide when I get there.\n\n[Everyone has to convince Father Lonigan to baptize Tabitha to avert a volcanic eruption]\n\nJulian Crane:\n\nThe threat to Harmony is real.\n\nEve Russell:\n\nWe saw the volcano erupting in a magic bowl.\n\nFather Lonigan:\n\nEve, have you been drinking again?\n\nEve Russell:\n\nNo.\n\nFather Lonigan:\n\nPopping pills.\n\nEve Russell:\n\nNo.\n\nFather Lonigan:\n\nSmoking weed.\n\nEve Russell:\n\nOh, no!\n\nAlistair Crane:\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the reception will be starting momentarily. I want you all to have a great time. It's going to be a fun evening. It's going to be an evening that you won't want to miss for one second.\n\nSam Bennett:\n\nAs if any of us wants your damn cake. Alistair: You know, Sam, I don't care if you starve to death. But I thought you might be curious about this wedding gift I have for each and every one of you. Some of you will enjoy it. Others won't.\n\nAlistair Crane:\n\nYou know, Sam, I don't care if you starve to death. But I thought you might be curious about this wedding gift I have for each and every one of you.
