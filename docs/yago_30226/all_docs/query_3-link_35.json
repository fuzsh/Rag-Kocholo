        "text": "iParenting Media Award Winner\n\nHelping children overcome their fear of pooping with colorful illustrations and a thoughtful story.\n\nRyan is scared to use the potty. He is afraid to have a poop, because he's afraid it's going to hurt. He does NOT want to go. This story, along with Ryan's \"poop program,\" will help young children gain the confidence they need to overcome this common problem and establish healthy habits. Includes a Note to Parents by the author.\n\nFrom the Note to Parents:\n\nThe book includes a “poop program” that I use with children between the ages of 3 and 6. While the program is ostensibly for the main character, my hope is that your child will want to follow these steps as well. How you approach the program will vary somewhat depending on your child’s age. Most 3- to 4-year-olds do not need to do the program in a formal way. Instead, you can incorporate parts of the program into your daily routine—make the needed dietary changes, reward successful pooping with stickers, and consider reviewing how poops come out of the body. Most 5- to 6-year-olds are interested in doing the full program, though it is still important to be flexible. For example, if a 5-year-old does not want to do Potty Practice, I would adjust things accordingly."
