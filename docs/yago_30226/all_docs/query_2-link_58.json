        "meta_description": "Passions was a decade long soap opera created by James E. Reilly, the same man who pulled Days of our Lives out of a ratings slump in the 1990s. Centered around the inhabitants of Harmony, a small seaside town in Maine, Passions excels at creating romantic triangles on the show, and controversy in the fans off the show. The show is based around five core families: the Standish/Bennett clan, the Winthrop/Crane clan, the Lopez/Fitzgerald clan, and the Johnson/Russell clan. Every other character can be directly (and romantically) connected to someone in one of the other clans.Passions premiered on July 5, 1999, and last aired on NBC on September 7, 2007, before being picked up to air on DirecTV starting September 17, 2007. DirecTV canceled the show at the beginning of 2008, and the final episode aired August 7, 2008.",
