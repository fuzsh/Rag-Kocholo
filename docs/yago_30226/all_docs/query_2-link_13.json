        "text": "Monday Feb. 3, 2003 Episode #911\n\nBeth pretends to be concerned about her mother's second heart attack and plays on Luis's sympathy. He assures Beth that he'll be there for her. Beth takes this as a commitment by Luis to her, even though that's not exactly what he meant. Sheridan wonders if she has the strength to be faithful to a comatose Antonio. Pilar has faith in her and is certain she will. Tabitha tries to convince the dark side to get her powers back, but they refuses to grant her request. They also tell her, however, that they will send her help soon. A suspicious Sam finally speaks up and says he still feels Ivy and David may have been working together. Ivy taunts Eve about her sister. Meanwhile, Liz pretends to be Eve and tries to seduce a sleepy TC. Kay's frustration grows as Ivy does everything she can to convince everyone that Kay is lying. In order to make her case, Ivy suggests that Grace's best friend, Eve, conducted the DNA test that proved John was Grace's son, which means David could not possibly be a fraud. A guilt-ridden Eve grows nervous, but everyone agrees with Ivy's logic. However, despite the fact that he trusts Eve, Sam still isn't convinced that David and Grace were married. Kay refuses to back down from her story, contending that the Cranes have enough money that Ivy could have hired an imposter. A distraught John begs Kay to put an end to this, but she maintains that she knows that Ivy and David are in cahoots to break up Sam and Grace, just as surely as she knows that Tabitha is a witch! Eve leaves, privately hoping that she can get to TC and tell him about her sordid past before someone else does. She's stunned to find TC in bed with Liz.\n\nTuesday Feb. 4, 2003 Episode #912\n\nKay damages her credibility when she insists that Tabitha is a witch. No one believes her and that only makes everyone think that she is also wrong about Ivy and David plotting against Sam and Grace. Kay is frustrated when everyone assumes that her head injury is making her delusional. Sam apologizes to David and asks a reluctant Grace to apologize to Ivy. Kay is adamant that she's telling the truth -- about David and Ivy as well as Tabitha. Julian and Rebecca make plans to pay off a mysterious informant who will supply them with damning evidence against Theresa that will turn Ethan off for good. Later, Ethan, Fox, Theresa and Gwen walk in on Rebecca and Julian having one of their kinky intimate moments rolling in dough. The scheming duo covers when everyone wants to know why they have a million dollars lying around. Ethan announces he wants to move out of the mansion right away. Theresa isn't happy to hear this. Fox eavesdrops as Rebecca tells Gwen what she plans to use the money for. Simone becomes furious when she spies on Chad and Whitney, who look like they are closer than ever. Vowing that Whitney won't steal Chad from her, Simone picks out a large knife. Eve plans to tell TC the truth about her past, but is stunned to find her husband and Liz in bed together. A groggy TC tries to explain what happened to a furious Eve. He thought he was in bed with her! He explains that Liz was sleepwalking. Eve doesn't think it's quite so innocent, however. Eve wakes Liz up by dumping water on her face and accuses her of trying to seduce TC -- quite consciously.\n\nWednesday Feb. 5, 2003 Episode #913\n\nGrace and Sam apologize to Ivy and David, and infuriate Kay because they don't believe her. They try to calm down Kay and ask her to come back home, but Kay refuses and makes it clear she won't unless Grace leaves. Kay wants to stay with Tabitha and blackmails her into letting her stay by threatening to prove to everyone that she's a witch. Rebecca convinces Gwen that it would not be a good idea for her and Ethan to leave the mansion. Gwen tries to explain to Ethan why she suddenly doesn't want to move out, but he is confused by her change of heart. After overhearing Rebecca, Fox tells Theresa about the informant. Theresa is certain nothing will come of it and is thrilled to learn that Ethan won't be leaving. Simone interrupts Chad and Whitney's romantic moment by waving a knife at them. Whitney makes up a quick excuse for being with Chad; Simone doesn't buy it, but continues to pretend that she doesn't know that Chad and Whitney are secretly seeing each other. Eve doesn't believe Liz's sleepwalking story, but TC assures Liz he doesn't blame her. Once they are alone, Liz threatens Eve. Eve tells Liz she's going to come clean with TC so she won't have a hold on her any longer. Liz tells TC, Simone and Whitney about how hard her life became once her sister left, and how badly she wants revenge; however, she's not ready to tell them who her sister is. Simone privately decides to use Liz's story to her advantage. Eve and TC are patching things up when she's called to the hospital.\n\nThursday Feb. 6, 2003 Episode #914\n\nKay strong arms Tabitha into letting her move in and gets settled into Tabitha's place. Tabitha realizes she can't do away with her obnoxious house guest without raising suspicions that Kay could be telling the truth about Tabby being a witch. Kay searches for ways to prove Tabby is a witch to insure the fact that she keeps the upper hand, reasoning if that she can prove that she was right about this then she can prove that she was right about Ivy and David's scheme. Frustrated, Tabitha asks the friends in the basement when her new helper will arrive. The friend inform her that her helper is already here -- it's Kay Bennett! Grace is upset with the fact that she has had to welcome Ivy back into her home and tries to deal with Ivy living there. Sam tries to get through to Grace about their relationship and wonders if she'd rather be with David. Grace is sure Ivy is after Sam, but she doesn't believe David is involved. Despite the uncomfortable accommodations, Ivy plans to stay at the Bennetts' forever -- or until she can force Grace out of Sam's life. Ivy asks Sam for help getting out of bed, then makes sure that Grace sees them. Grace privately tells Ivy that her plan has backfired -- Grace isn't fooled, and she and Sam want Ivy out of there today! Beth is secretly delighted when she believes her mother is dead. But that's not the case and when she hears that she is still alive, Beth lashes out at her mother for disappointing her. Luis catches Beth trying to smother her mom, but she makes up a story to cover her evil deed, brushing off Mrs. Wallace's attempt to warn Luis that Beth is not as good as she seems. Sheridan and Luis pray for a miracle. Pilar apologizes to Sheridan for her harsh words, and tells Sheridan and Luis that she realizes that their relationship hinges on what happens to Antonio. Suddenly, Antonio takes a turn for the worse.\n\nFriday Feb. 7, 2003 Epispde #915\n\nMonday February 10, 2003 Episode #916\n\nLiz subtly tries to cause more problems between Eve and TC. She convinces TC that he and his daughters are being neglected. The confrontation between TC and Eve leaves Eve feeling guilty and insecure. Then, Eve decides to clear her work schedule to make more time for TC and the girls. No sooner has she decided this, however, then she gets a call from the hospital regarding Antonio. When she hears about Antonio's condition, Liz insists on going to the hospital as well. Just when everyone is ready to give up hope, Antonio's eyes open. However, everyone is alarmed when he doesn't respond and they realize he is still in a coma. Selfish Beth prays Antonio stays a vegetable for the rest of his life so she can have Luis. A distraught Sheridan stays by Antonio's side, while Luis realizes that this means that he has truly lost Sheridan. Having recovered from her head injury, Kay tries to convince everyone that Tabitha is truly a witch. She states her case to David and Ivy. Sam begins to wonder if Kay is really telling the truth. Ivy and David fear their lives are about to be destroyed. Tabitha interrupts Kay and privately admits to her that she is indeed a witch, but her life will be miserable if she tells anyone. Using a magical bowl of water, Tabitha shows Kay a future in which Miguel has married Charity, leaving Kay miserable. While Kay absorbs this, Tabitha shows her a future that's more to her liking -- which, Tabitha tells her, can be hers if she withdraws her accusations and agrees to work with Tabitha. Kay readily agrees. She rejoins her parents and apologizes for all the accusations she's made. It doesn't take long for David and Ivy to realize that Kay's still suspicious of them, though.\n\nTuesday February 11, 2003 Episode #917\n\nEthan watches disapprovingly as Theresa yawns and bumbles her way through a crucial business meeting at Crane Industries.

Fox warns Theresa that Ethan will never forgive her for evicting his mother. Ivy returns to the mansion for her belongings and tells Rebecca she's never going to leave the Bennetts' place now that she's so close to winning Sam back. Meanwhile, Grace reminds her husband how Ivy's continued presence under their roof is making an already chaotic situation even worse. Sheridan bemoans the fact that Antonio's pitiful condition may mean she and Luis will never be together. An exhausted Theresa nods off during Ethan's presentation to their important clients. Rebecca promises an impatient Gwen that she'll soon have enough ammunition to send their mutual enemy packing. Ethan suggests to a bristling Theresa that she's incapable of handling both motherhood and a fast track career.\n\nWednesday February 12, 2003 Episode #918\n\nGrace prods Sam to evict Ivy from their house but he refuses to concede that his old flame has been trying to wreck their marriage. At the Crane mansion, Gwen points out to a sputtering Ivy that she's been behaving exactly like her worst enemy by attempting to break up the Bennetts.
