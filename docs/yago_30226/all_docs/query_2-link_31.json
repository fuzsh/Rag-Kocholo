        "text": "Quiz Answer Key and Fun Facts\n\n1. I am one of the four ladies who gave birth to babies in the fall of 2003. My little girl gave us a scare, but she was released from the hospital on Thanksgiving. Who am I?\n\nAnswer: Kay Bennett\n\nKay seduced Miguel into sleeping with her so she could get pregnant, and now she hopes to use baby Maria to get Miguel for good. All of the other choices had babies too, but Sheridan's was kidnapped by Beth, Tabitha's was a healthy baby girl, and Gwen's baby girl died.\n\n2. I am a very manipulative character on the show. I have schemed and lied. I have even gone so far as to kidnap a woman and steal her baby. Who am I?\n\nAnswer: Beth Wallace\n\nBeth's mother really wants her scheming daughter exposed. Beth kidnapped Sheridan and stole her baby boy, just so she could pass it off as her own child with Luis. The only thing I don't get is how Luis didn't realize that Beth was faking a pregnancy.\n\n3. I am a character with a very short temper. Julian Crane ruined my life and my tennis career. Who am I?\n\nAnswer: T.C. Russell\n\nAnother thing is that T.C. disapproves of Chad Harris, the man who was dating his daughter, Whitney.\n\n4. I am a woman who always gets what I want. Ivy is basically my only friend, even though I had an affair with her ex-husband, Julian. I despise Theresa. Who am I?\n\nAnswer: Rebecca Hotchkiss\n\nRebecca will also stop at nothing to see that her daughter, Gwen is happy. She blames Theresa for the death of her granddaughter.\n\n5. I make a mean tomato soup cake, and I normally make it for every big event in Harmony. I once had amnesia, and I had a twin sister who died. Who am I?\n\nAnswer: Grace Bennett\n\nKay is Grace's daughter, and they do not get along at all. Kay accuses her of loving and spending more time with Charity.\n\n6. I am the town doctor, and I have a very dark past. I had an affair with the most hated man in Harmony, Julian. I once was a lounge singer. Who am I?\n\nAnswer: Eve Russell\n\nEve has had her fair share of problems. Ivy knows of Eve's past relationship with Julian, and decided to blackmail Eve so she could destroy Sam and Grace's marriage.\n\n7. My parents created me during a one night stand. My mother is a witch. My father is a millionaire. Who am I?\n\nAnswer: Endora Lennox\n\nEndora was produced when Julian and Tabitha had a fling. She is referred to as 'a demon baby'.\n\n8. I am the girl who has special powers. I have premonitions that normally came true. I met the man I fell in love with at the Harmony Carnival. My cousin once had an affair with my boyfriend. Who am I?\n\nAnswer: Charity Standish\n\nCharity was the daughter of Grace's twin, Faith, who died in a fire.\n\n9. I fell in love with Whitney Russell, but it was her sister who fell for me. Ethan and I are good friends. I am a music producer. Who am I?\n\nAnswer: Chad Harris\n\nSimone was obsessed with Chad, and even thought that he was her boyfriend. Chad never had his eye on Simone, because he was always attracted to her sister, Whitney.\n\n10. When I first arrived in Harmony, I thought I was going to be reunited with my long lost mother. Turns out, she really isn't my mother, and my father lied to her about me. Who am I?\n\nAnswer: John Hastings\n\nJohn is not really Grace's son because she was not really married to David before the amnesia.\n\n11. When I first arrived in Harmony, I was in love with Antonio, but I soon turned my sights to my sister's husband. I bought 'the Blue Note' shortly before it burned down. Who am I?\n\nAnswer: Liz Sandbourne\n\nEve's family didn't know when Liz arrived that she was Eve's sister.\n\n12. I cheated on my girlfriend with her cousin, but I was seduced and didn't know who it really was. I have a daughter named Maria, and my mother is Pilar. Who am I?\n\nAnswer: Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald\n\nPoor Miguel, he has been through a lot, from almost being killed by zombie Charity, and almost losing Charity, to being threatened by Sam when he got Kay pregnant.\n\n13. I am chief of police in Harmony. Ethan, Jessica, Noah, and Kay are my children. I had an affair with Ivy when she first married Julian. Who am I?\n\nAnswer: Sam Bennett\n\nSam lost everything when Grace chose David over him. Oh well, I guess he has Ivy to cheer him up!\n\n14. I am another one of the ladies who had a baby in the fall of 2003. I am a witch, and I live next door to the Bennetts. Who am I?\n\nAnswer: Tabitha Lennox\n\nTabitha made Timmy (he was a doll), and he became the light of her life until his death (the actor that played him ironically died on the same day). Tabitha's baby girl Endora is going to help her destroy Charity.\n\n15. I have tried to kill my own daughter. I have even gone so far as to dress as a woman to ruin her life. I am a very rich and powerful man. I saved Theresa's life when she was on death row. Who am I?\n\nAnswer: Allistair Crane\n\nThe woman who helped Beth kidnap Sheridan and steal her baby wasn't a woman after all. 'Charlie' was really Allistair Crane! Thanks for taking the time to play! Keep watching 'Passions'!\n\nSource: Author butterbean05\n\nThis quiz was reviewed by FunTrivia editor ladymacb29 before going online.\n\nAny errors found in FunTrivia content are routinely corrected through our feedback system."
