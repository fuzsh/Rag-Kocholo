        "text": "Quote ethesaphylickfan: -Luis and Sheridan would have realized that they couldn't live without each other and broke things off with Fancy and Antonio.(Fancy told Luis they were expecting but later on found out that it was a false test and their marriage wasn't legal.)Luis and Sheridan,finally after 9 long years and two failed marriage attempts....tied the knot in front of their son,Marty,family and friends.Their first dance as man and wife was of course.....the tango! :)\n\n-Fancy was heartbroken but finally realized who was truly the man that captured her heart and she let Luis and Sheridan be happy.However after realizing the only man that made her truly happy(Noah Bennett) was involved with another woman,she tried one last time because his marriage to Paloma was not legal because of a paperwork mistake.At first Noah was dedicated to spending his life with Paloma who at that time was expecting but like Fancy who bought a similar pregnancy brand,the test was inaccurate.This gave Noah some breathing room to figure who was truly the woman in his heart.Paloma was not about to lose the man she loves and made it clear to Fancy where she stood and their friendship suffered because of it.Fancy however decided to give up on Noah after witnessing a touching moment between Noah and Paloma.Fancy went to both of them and told them she would bow out gracefully and apologized for interfering in their lives.What she didn’t know was that the touching moment she witnessed a day earlier was actually Noah and Paloma reminiscing about their past moments together which was right before they ended their relationship.Paloma told her that there was no need to apologize and in fact she thanked her because she finally realized she loved Noah but she wasn’t in love with him.(She was still hung up over her first love back in Puerto Arena.) Noah and Fancy reunited and two years later became man and wife.\n\n-Julian & Eve stayed together and made each other happy for the rest of their lives\n\n-Whitney came back into town and found a new love even though it took her a very long time to date again after losing the love of her life(and father of her children…Chad).She and Theresa rekindled their friendship and Miles became like a little brother to Little Ethan.\n\n-Theresa moved out of the Crane Mansion because she wanted a fresh start and her,Ethan,Little Ethan and Jane moved into a luxurious house across town.Theresa handed over her position as CEO to Julian Crane but still was a very prominent figure in Crane Industries.\n\n-Sam & Ivy continued their relationship and Ivy and Pilar rekindled their friendship.However,after Pilar met a charming man who swept off her feet,Sam began to feel jealous.He was so surprised he felt that way and kept it to himself until finally he revealed to Pilar that even though they have been good friends for many years,he has always wondered what could have happened between them.To Sam’s surprise,Pilar admitted that she used to have the same thoughts but this was of course way before Grace was in the picture.She revealed to him that she gave up on the idea when she found out that Sam and Ivy became an item(many years ago).What also came as a shocker(to us viewers) was that they were each other’s first crushes and in fact their first kiss was with each other.Pilar dismissed that kiss as being silly and meaningless(back when it happened) even though she and Sam both felt the opposite.Sam broke things off with Ivy because even though he forgave her for all the manipulative and selfish things she did,he couldn’t forget how much pain and anguish she inflicted on his family.He couldn’t spend his life with a woman without wholeheartedly trusting her and after finding out about her mischiefs,their trust was never able to get repaired.After a heartbreaking goodbye,Ivy moved out of town.Sam and Pilar,after a period of time,decided to see if their was a possibility of a relationship.They quickly fell in love and got married a year later,to everyone’s surprise.(and delight…)On their wedding day,Ivy made an appearance in Pilar’s room as she was getting ready.She told her that even though it breaks her heart to see the man she has loved almost all her life wed someone else,she couldn’t be happier for Pilar.She thanked her for her years of friendship and constructive advice and told her that after living in another town for a year,she doesn’t want to have regrets anymore.Her life used to be consumed with regrets and that got her to do things she never thought she would ever even contemplate of doing.She tells a tearful Pilar that she was diagnosed with breast cancer and that is why she had to come home.Pilar asked Ivy for her blessing because she knew she loved Sam just as much as Pilar loved Martin,and she knew it would be difficult to endure a loss(think back to Martin/Katherine).Ivy gave her the blessing even though she reassured Pilar there was no need because Pilar truly deserved happiness and she wished her the best.Pilar told her she didn’t have a maid of honor because she always thought it would have been her but since she wasn’t there,she decided to not have one.Pilar asked her if she would do her the honor of being the MOH but told her she understands completely if she decided not to.To Pilar’s surprise,Ivy accepted.She told Pilar that she was the only true friend she has ever had and she would be honored to be her maid of honor.Ivy talked to Sam briefly before the wedding and they finally got their permanent closure.Sam and Pilar got married.Ivy continues to battle cancer with the support of her family and friend,Pilar.\n\n-To everyone’s shock,Fox comes back.The “Fox” that died was actually an imposter and the real fox(played by Justin Hartley) was brainwashed and was living in a different country,all thanks to the evil Alistair Crane.Tabitha and Endora figured out the story and tracked down the real fox.With their magic,his memory returned and with that returned his love for Kay Bennett.Charity also came back into town for the anniversary of Grace’s death.Once Miguel saw Charity,for some reason,all his feelings for her resurfaced.Kay began to get insecure again but then once saw Fox,she couldn’t believe what was happening.After months of back and forth,Miguel and Kay broke things off and rekindled their loves with Charity and Fox.Miguel and Charity got married a couple months later and Fox and Kay got married a year later.\n\n-Alistair is in fact still alive except this time he is rotting in prison.\n\n-Tabitha is raising a rebellious,spunky teen all the while enjoying her life.\n\nSO THERE YOU HAVE IT…that ^ is just 1 of the MANY possibilities of what could have happened to these beloved characters,if passions was still on air."
