        "text": "5 years after the series finale of Passions we catch up with the residents of Harmony. Have they finally found happiness or will the never ending drama found in Harmony keep them ensnared forever? Revenge is a dish best served cold. Cast heavy! #PostSeries\n\nAt this point, she had nothing left to lose.\n\nPart 2 of 3 of the “Home” series. Sequel to “Better Than This.”\n\nThis is a stupid joke fanfic for a small community that watches Passions (1999) every other Saturday with YouTuber Jeff Holiday and his friend Ian. This isn't for Passions fans in general but a very small subset.\n\nTimmy wants to go on vacation but he can't go if he and Tabitha are caught up in all the drama in Harmony. He enlists the help of Jeff and Ian to solve everyone's problems in town with their 4th wall breaking powers, be it jail or a threesome...\n\nThis is an origional work done by the authors, Passions Fan and Furkrastinl8r. It's about love, crime, weddings, births, witchcraft... We put our own passions and styles into it. It's based off of the soap opera, Passions. We hope you enjoy it! It's weirder than Passions! It is a script including micropreemies written by two people who were born as micropreemies at 1 pound in the 80's!\n\nIt's July 2003 in the New England town of Harmony. In an effort to stop Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald and Charity Standish from consummating their love, Tabitha Lenox casts a spell that reverberates throughout the entire community and alters the course of everyone's storylines. Eve and TC Russell are sent back in time to their youth, when Julian and Eve were still a couple, and shortly after their son was kidnapped by Alistair's henchman."
