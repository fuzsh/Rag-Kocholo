        "text": "Kay is the sister of Noah and Jessica. She rarely gets along with Jessica as she is always teasing her. She developed a crush on Miguel while she was still a teenager. She stopped at nothing to win him over. She even used her best friend, Simone, and his best friend, Reese, to get closer to him. However, Miguel fell in love with her cousin, Charity. Kay then began working on anything she could do to get rid of Charity. Her crush on Miguel seemed to become the most important thing in her life. Even after finding out that Charity's long lost aunt might be Kay�s mother and would make her mother happy to meet her, Kay did all she could to make sure the two never met. While trying to break Charity and Miguel up, she pretended to support their relationship. Kay worked even harder after Miguel admitted to her in a mineshaft that he probably would have asked her out if Charity had never come to town.\n\nIn an effort to get Miguel, she sold her soul to Hecuba and helped to arrange for the demons of Hell to attack Charity, but at the same time, the demons were after Kay too. Fortunately for Kay, she was able to get her soul back and escape Hell�s demons. After finding the Book of Spells, she decided to work some magic to take care of Charity. Her first spell entombed Charity into a block of ice and then she created a Zombie Charity. The plan began to backfire as the Zombie Charity started forming a mind of her own with her own plans. The Zombie Charity began to make threats to Kay's family along with Miguel. To protect everyone, Zombie Charity was defeated and Kay moved on to even more means of winning over Miguel.\n\nThe next plan was to use essence from Charity to make Miguel think that she was actually Charity. This worked and Miguel and Kay slept together, but he was appalled when he found out the truth. Charity was finally found and Miguel was so happy to have her back. Kay was obviously upset and more determined to have Charity dead. She also became upset with her mother, Grace, and started yelling at her and blaming her for everything that was going wrong in her life and was upset that she would not help her destroy their relationship.\n\nCharity and Miguel started making plans for their wedding. The day the wedding came, Kay fainted in the church and everyone found out that she was pregnant. This did postpone the wedding, but did not break up the couple. Miguel made sure that everyone knew that he would have never gone after Kay. Kay ended up moving out of her parents� house during a blizzard out of anger because she could not live with their rules. Tabitha let her move in with her, but only after Kay blackmailed her. Kay also decided that she wanted to learn and practice witchcraft like Tabitha so that she could put an end to Miguel and Charity's relationship. Miguel avoided Kay even more after finding out about her dark side.\n\nKay gave birth to her child, Maria, and even though Maria's life was in danger several times, Kay could not give up trying to get Miguel. She proved just how heartless she could be when it came to winning over Miguel - using her own child�s health issues and the death of her niece as new means. Tabitha and Simone both tried telling her they would never be together because of love if it were something she forced to happen.\n\nTo Kay's excitement, Miguel and Charity broke up after he caught her with Reese. Miguel still wanted to be with Charity however and Kay had to work even harder to get him. She turned to Tabitha and witchcraft. For fear of going to prison, Kay did not want to kill her, but the spell Tabitha put on her turned her into a dog so she could attack Charity and not be recognized. Kay, in dog form, almost killed Charity, but Miguel was there and threw a spear at the dog. Once hit, she turned back into her human form, but no one saw this happen. Miguel found her with the spear and thought he had missed the dog and accidentally hit her. The damage left her unable to ever have another child again. Kay was so angry with Miguel because he would not leave Charity and blamed him for everything that had ever gone wrong.\n\nMiguel decided to leave Harmony, which finally helped Kay get her life back in order. She continued to live with Tabitha and started working extra to make money for her and Maria. She also made amends with her family for all the hurtful things she had done to them. She later met Fox Crane and formed a relationship very quickly. They spent a lot of time together and wanted to do something very special for him and turned to Tabitha again for a little witchcraft. Although Tabitha warned her that she would have to pay the price, Kay still wanted her to cast a spell on him to help him be more successful in his business. The price: he started spending more and more time at the office - and with Valerie.\n\nOnce Valerie was no longer in the picture, Kay and Fox�s relationship really started to grow. That is until Miguel came back to Harmony after giving up on his search for Charity. Miguel admitted his love for her. Although she could not help still be attracted to Miguel, she told him that her and Fox were really happy together. Later on, Miguel started up a new relationship with Siren who had just come to town, which made Kay very jealous. Kay learned that Siren was a mermaid and was scared that he would fall under the mermaids curse. Kay tried telling people but no one believed her."
