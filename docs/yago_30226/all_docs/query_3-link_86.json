        "text": "Finishing the Future: Marion spoke at the class meeting of our 45th reunion as follows:\n\nRemarks for Wellesley 1966 Reunion Class Meeting June 5, 2011\n\nFinishing the Future – Marion Kane\n\nI want to start my remarks by trying to redeem myself from the talk I gave at our 20th reunion on What Makes Us Happy. I spoke about the little things in life that made me laugh including the plastic pink flamingos that adorned my front lawn and got covered with snow each winter with only their little necks sticking out. It was that image that led to the profusion of pink flamingos that have flocked to each of our reunions ever since.\n\nI was telling this story to a friend this spring and she replied “You know, Marion, the pink flamingo is the symbol for the passage of the soul from dark into light.” “Really, I replied,” who would ever have guessed.” So I looked up pink flamingos on the web and here is what I found:\n\n“According to many, the flamingo of East Africa might have contributed to the myth of the phoenix. This bright pink or white bird nests on salt flats that are too hot for its eggs or chicks to survive. So it builds a mound several inches tall and large enough to support its egg which it lays in that marginally cooler location. The convection currents around these mounds resemble the turbulence of a flame. In zoology, flamingos are part of the family Phoenicopteridae, from the generic name Phoenicopterus or “phoenix-winged.”\n\nIt is this image that I want us to hold in our minds as I talk about Finishing the Future.\n\nI am sure we have all thought at some time about what we would do if we were told we only had a year left to live.\n\nAs some of you know, my husband Dan and I confronted that reality in 1994 when he was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig’s disease. Dan spent that year in many creative ways. He gathered all of the things he had written and put them into a book for me and each of the kids and friends and family; he pulled all of our financial information together, transferred assets, closed bank accounts; he made sure all of his relationships were up to date and visited with many friends; and he continued his work as a patent lawyer – actually going to work and finishing a patent application the day before he died.\n\nAs sad as that year was for all of our family, it held many gifts as well. Dan was “finished” when he died and it started me thinking about how to live so we are finished when we die. And it was important to learn these lessons at 50 when I still had lots of time to put them into practice. I wondered how much more and better we would live if we got beyond our fear of death at 20 or 30 or 40.\n\nIn the years that followed I had and started many conversations about thinking creatively about the end of life. The more I explored the subject, the more I found that many people\n\nnever have that conversation early enough in their lives. As a result, we live out our lives without confronting and embracing death and consequently we miss many opportunities to position our selves to be “finished” when we die.\n\nAll of this came home to me when I was diagnosed with metastatic ovarian cancer three years ago. It was at a time when I had already announced that I would be retiring from the Barr Foundation that year and moving from Boston back to Maine. And I had made plans to do something I always wanted to do when I retired – spend the winter in New Zealand. So life went on amid surgery and chemotherapy and I had good conversations with my oncologist about my interest in quality of life, not quantity.\n\nWhen I got back from New Zealand, I joined the boards of several nonprofits in Maine and the advisory committee of the local hospice. All of which have kept me busy and engaged but also given me time to think about what I need to do to finish my life.\n\nAnd that is where you all come in. When I agreed to participate on this panel, I had something of an ulterior motive in the back of my mind. Perhaps my Wellesley classmates are the ones who can help jumpstart conversations about creatively embracing the end of life with their families and friends. It also occurred to me that a memorial service may be the best place to initiate that conversation. It is a supremely teachable moment. People attending a memorial service are unusually open and unguarded. And while they often hear from others about the person who has passed away, they rarely hear from the persons themselves about the experience of confronting death and the tools their life gave them to deal with it. So I have written something to be read at my memorial service and perhaps you will want to do something along these lines as well. And since most of you will not be there I wanted to share it with you now.\n\nReflections on a life’s journey\n\nAs many of you know, several years ago I expressed an interest in making some kind of contribution to the conversation about end of life. Having lived with Dan through his 15 month illness from ALS and death in 1995, I was profoundly moved by the thoughtful way he conducted his final journey. Walking with him on that path had many gifts for me. It taught me that you can’t measure a life in terms of time and that there is an art to being “finished” when you die. It also helped me face my worst fear – losing my life partner and best friend. I looked death in the face and in the process lost my fear of it. And together we made treatment and life choices that gave him an incredibly high quality end of life.\n\nSince that time I have thought often about what accounted for that quality ending and here was what I observed:\n\n1. It is important to have a philosophical context for your life. This can be a religious or spiritual framework, a belief system, or reflections on the meaning of your life.\n\n2. The importance of living fully and doing what you want to do when you have the opportunity. Both Dan and I had adventurous lives, filled with travel and new experiences and lived with no regrets.\n\n3. Give something back to the community. There has been tremendous satisfaction in seeing things that Dan and I helped start grow and thrive and provide value to the community.\n\n4. Plan ahead of time for the end of life. What do you want to leave behind, what ceremonies are important to you, putting financial records in order, being clear about disposition of property, open communication\n\n5. Make sure that your relationships are up to date. This is particularly important when you have the gift of time to spend with those you love and who have loved you.\n\nIt struck me as I planned to retire that leaving a job you have loved and a life you have loved have many similarities. If you care about a smooth transition, you plan for the transition way in advance of the event – putting systems in place and sharing everything you have learned and know with those who should have that information all along the way. I have often said that the test of a good executive director is that he/she can walk out the door and no one will notice that they are gone. Somehow I think the end of life should be that way too. This is not to diminish the grief and sadness of losing someone you love but rather the sense of closure that leaves those behind you able to carry forward with the knowledge and equipment they need to live rich, satisfying lives and to get beyond the fear of death.\n\nDan was a scholar of the philosopher Alfred North Whitehead who believed that when you love someone you actually physically exchange parts of yourself with them. Therefore when all of the people who loved you gather together as for a memorial service, they can physically recreate you just for that moment in time. I have actually experienced that at many memorial services and it strengthens my belief that we don’t really die but rather distribute ourselves around and are carried forward in parts by those who loved us.\n\nI had a wonderful experience just before I left the Barr Foundation. At our last staff meeting, the staff went around the table sharing things that they had learned from our time together. One said she learned about “quantum physics”, another about “emergence,” another about systems thinking. When I left that meeting I realized that it had really been an encounter with immortality. Dan taught me all about quantum physics and systems thinking and emergence; I incorporated them into my work and the design of the Barr Foundation, and now my staff was going out into Boston and incorporating those ideas into their thinking and the way they carried out their work.\n\nWhen I said I wanted to get involved in end of life issues, it wasn’t clear to me how I would engage in that conversation. That was before I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and never imagined that maybe I would engage in this conversation with my own end of life journey. And it has been a rich journey. I have not been afraid of death, nor have I lived in pain or sadness. I have had the gift of time to say goodbye to the many people I have loved and to tie up all of the loose ends of my life. I regret that I won’t see my granddaughter grow up or my children grow old but I can imagine that the gift of immortality, of all of the bits and pieces of life lessons and moments we shared and time together will be carried forward and I rest peacefully with those thoughts.\n\nI am reminded of one of my favorite passages from The Little Prince. It is when the little prince makes friends with a fox who explains that if the little prince will just take the time to tame him it will be as if the sun came to shine on his life. The fox explains “You see the grain-fields down yonder? I do not eat bread. Wheat is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the color of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me. The grain, which is also golden will bring back the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat...”\n\nSo listen for the wind in the wheat. Thank you all for the innumerable ways you have enriched my life and for coming to this celebration.\n\nFrom the Record Book\n\nFALMOUTH MA - Marion Meschter Kane died Aug. 20, 2012. Born in Philadelphia on Jan. 2, 1945, she was the second of three daughters to Barbara and Kyrel Meschter. After Germantown Friends School, she attended Wellesley College, graduating in 1966, with a degree in English literature. While at Wellesley, Marion met her husband Daniel H. Kane Jr. of Centerport, N.Y., and they were married in 1967. Moving to San Francisco, Marion worked for Sierra Club magazine and Dan as a patent attorney. They had two sons, Dan and Christopher. In 1972 they moved to Mount Desert Island, ME, to help start College of the Atlantic. While raising her young children, Marion worked as feature writer for the Bar Harbor Times and later became the director of public relations at College of the Atlantic. In 1983 she left the college to join former College of the Atlantic president Ed Kaelber in starting Maine Community Foundation and from 1990 to 2000 served as its president. During her time with Maine Community Foundation she played an active role in different communities across the state, giving away more than 20 million dollars in grants statewide. In 2000 Marion moved to Boston to serve as the first executive director of the Barr Foundation, a position she held until she retired in 2008. In addition to her roles with Maine Community Foundation and the Barr Foundation, Marion was active in many other charitable organizations and served on numerous boards ranging from Somes Meynell Wildlife Sanctuary and Maine Chapter of the Nature Conservancy to Dentaquest Foundation and Center for the Prevention of Hate Violence. Marion's deep love of Maine, and Mount Desert Island, was a defining part of her life. More recently she traveled extensively, spending time with the Kalahari Bushmen in Africa, living for three months in New Zealand, and exploring the jungles of Ecuador. After retiring to Falmouth she spent much of her time enjoying her young granddaughter, Tessa, gardening, and creating beautiful watercolor paintings and fabric art.\n\n[shortened from (http:// obituaries.pressherald.com/obituaries/mainetoday-pressherald/obituary.aspx?pid=159368412)\n\nBarbara Bryan: “Marion Meschter Kane--At the 45th reunion, she spoke with such caring and calm about our end-of-life journey and how we can help make it a rich and loving aspect of our lives. I felt she was speaking directly to me; I have often thought of how she seemed to glow with life energy, even as she contemplated her own death. I have been grateful ever since for her generosity in sharing.”\n\nPamela Worden: “In honor of Marion Meschter Kane I listen - as she asked us to do - I listen for the wind in the wheat ... I will never forget her grace, her courage, her generous spirit or her delicious sense of humor. I miss her.”\n\nDiana Chapman Walsh: “Marion and I had both come to Wellesley from Philadelphia, both from families with Quaker roots, both with ties to Pocono Lake Preserve. Those were our initial bonds. We lived in the same dorm, Severance Hall, during our freshman year, and had many friends in common through the four years. Sometimes we would travel home together for vacations. One Christmas Marion had a large green book bag filled with books and materials she was taking home for a term paper she planned to finish over the holiday break (finals came afterwards in those tough-old-days). We were getting ready to board the plane, which we could see below from a window in the boarding area. Suddenly Marion bolted for the stairs and down on to the runway, where all the passengers watched with amazement and empathy as she dashed back and forth scooping up the books and papers that were flying in every direction from the book bag, which had split open. I can still see her there, the wind in her hair. This was long before TSA but I suspect even they wouldn’t have managed to stop her.\n\nWe laughed over the decades about that incident, and many more. The pink flamingo joke went on for years. The rusting junkyard birds peeking up from the piles of snow in her front yard, and Marion's impulsive rejoinder to her sons' unwillingness as teenagers to be seen in her company. Her telling of the story at our 25th reunion turned it into such a hilarious and piquant life parable that flocks of plastic pink flamingoes would reappear all over campus every five years when our class would return for another reunion. Dozens of them were stored in the garage of the president’s house while I was in residence there. Some students seemed to infer that the president had a flamingo fetish; I became the unwitting collector of an amazing array of flamingo-themed trinkets presented with a flourish by students.\n\nWhen I left Wellesley and Marion left the Barr Foundation, we reconnected. Each of us was in the process of contemplating the closing chapters of the full lives we had in many ways launched together as college students and now felt so blessed to have lived. She was encouraging me to consider being her successor at Barr. I discovered in that exploration what an extraordinarily creative leader she had been there. And thus began for us an extended final conversation -- off and on through her last five years -- about the things that mattered most in our lives.\n\nMarion had told me she wanted to make a study of what it would mean to be ready to die when the time came and she shared some of her writings on the subject. I felt enormously privileged to have had those encounters with her. When our class officers approached me about a program for our 45th reunion. I suggested that they ask Marion if she would be part of a panel discussion they were organizing. She agreed and gave a talk on that Saturday afternoon that none of the hundred plus classmates in the room will ever forget. She read us the piece she was writing about her impending death and said it would be read at her memorial service. It has been widely circulated, with Marion’s permission, and it has become a subtle, but powerful, wave front out into the world, bringing others into a new orientation toward one of the greatest fears that has gripped our secular culture and distorted our decision making.\n\nMarion was fearless. She was brilliant and beautiful, elegant and kind. She was silly and sophisticated, intuitive and analytical, open to adventure and possibility, and so much more. Above all, though, I will remember her for her generosity of spirit. Albert Schweitzer said he would make of his life his argument. Marion did something else. She lived her values, embodied them fully, and then offered her life, gently and without the touch of vanity or coercion that accompanies an argument, to anyone who might find in that life inspiration, instruction, light. Many did. I surely do.”\n\nJudith Peller Hallett: “Her words at our 20th on the inspiration she derived from her own pink flamingos brought our class an inspirational symbol for our lives; her words at our 45th about how she would like to be remembered after her death have been inspirational in other, powerful ways. She and I came from the same Philadelphia suburb, and from the moment I met her she personified a sublime and generous grace.“\n\nWeezie Knight: “Who of us will forget the poignant and moving narrative Marion gave at our last reunion speaking of her brave struggle with cancer and her “veiled” prediction that she might not make it to our next reunion because of her then recent diagnosis of ovarian cancer. She was a lovely person, so friendly and gracious. I will always treasure my time with her rehearsing and performing our Junior Show – Rite on Time.”\n\nSara Stoker: How much I miss one of our room mates - Marion Meschter Kane - all of us have her dear tacky flamingoes and here's one - if I can that Kitsy's daughter, Becky, posted. (See color photo on Marion’s page in color photos) So dear Marion, you and your sentiments on being sure to always have a sense of humor, are with us for generations!! We so love and admire you! And love to your sons.\n\nKitty Dibble: “My memories of Marion Meschter Kane are typically as bright and cheery as she was. My pink flamingo and its holiday costumes is a tradition that I know will be carried on by my grandchildren. Who among us will forget her reading her own “obituary” at last reunion’s class meeting? One of my earliest memories is my asking Marion to help me find a good quote to engrave on a silver dish, a gift for my soon-to-be husband’s ordination. She shared a favorite quote from 2nd Timothy, 1:7, “For God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power and of love, and of a sound mind.” This quote has been a touchstone all my life, but I would just like to add a fourth gift, a sense of humor! Marion was a true gift to all of us.”\n\nFrom the Record Book\n\nJoan Edmonds--`Anything She Set Out To Do, She Did'\n\nAugust 29, 2000 By Heather Vogell, Tribune staff writer.\n\nJoan Edmonds Brophy, 55, who left a career as an innovative reading teacher to become a prominent Chicago lawyer while raising eight children, died of breast cancer Saturday, Aug. 26, at St. Francis Hospital in Evanston.\n\nMrs. Brophy balanced a family and two demanding careers with grace and humor, her friends and family said.\n\nAs a teacher, she designed a successful reading curriculum that her school used for many years. As an attorney, she had a knack for grasping the human drama behind dry legalese and counted the Archdiocese of Chicago among her clients.\n\nAs a law student at DePaul University, she graduated first in her class while juggling her parental duties, once staying up all night to sew a Halloween costume for her daughter, said her friend Julie Badel.\n\n\"She was the perennial Wonder Woman,\" Badel said. \"Anything she set out to do, she did.\"\n\nMrs. Brophy attended Wellesley College in Massachusetts as an undergraduate and received a master's degree from Boston College.\n\nShe worked in public schools in Washington's troubled Anacostia section before moving to Chicago in 1969. While in Washington, she volunteered for the Hubert Humphrey-Edmund Muskie campaign, where she met her future husband.\n\nIn Chicago, Mrs. Brophy taught at Kenwood High School, developing a reading program that became popular with students and teachers.\n\nWhile she worked there, a teacher was murdered by her ex-husband, who committed suicide.\n\nMrs. Brophy was outraged to find that their two orphaned children could not receive survivor benefits because they had been in their mother's custody. The Chicago Board of Education did not allot such benefits to women. Mrs. Brophy found the children a lawyer and sued, alleging illegal gender discrimination under the state constitution.\n\nThe state legislature eventually passed laws providing survivor benefits to all female employees of the Chicago school board. But Mrs. Brophy, one of five founders of the Illinois Democratic Women's Caucus, thought the benefits should be extended to all women in the state.\n\nSo at age 30, with five children, she signed up for night law classes at DePaul.\n\n\"That drove her to law school, so she wouldn't have to wait calmly on the sidelines while somebody else did or didn't do what they're supposed to do,\" said her husband.\n\nMrs. Brophy excelled at law, becoming the editor of the law review and finishing a four-year program one year early. Three years later, she received an advanced law degree from DePaul, walking across the commencement stage 10 days before her son Thomas, her sixth child, was born.\n\nAn East Rogers Park resident, she became a partner with Mayer, Brown & Platt, where she worked for the last 15 years. She specialized in employee benefits and pensions.\n\n\"Joan was a remarkable woman who lived the fullest of lives,\" said Diana Chapman Walsh, president of Wellesley College and a former roommate of Mrs. Brophy. \"She was that special friend who saw--and evoked--the essential goodness in those who were blessed to know her as a friend.\"\n\nMrs. Brophy is also survived by three other sons, Michael, Patrick and John; three daughters, Kathleen Migly, Christina and Margaret; three sisters, Jill Edmonds Meyer and Julie and Lucy Edmonds; a brother, John Rolland Edmonds; and two grandchildren.\n\n[Source: http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-08-29/news/0008290053_1_chicago-school-board-survivor-benefits-law- school]\n\nLibbet Dunlop Richter: “In college Joan Edmonds Brophy and I had both lived in Bates and shared the many traumas of dating relationships and academic challenges. She later served with me as an alumnae class officer. I remember a delightful afternoon stuffing envelopes for a mini-reunion in my dining room with help from one of her children. Her spirit was always upbeat and optimistic, even facing cancer; these are among the qualities that, I am sure, made her a great attorney, working for the welfare of women and children. “\n\nRosemary Metrailer: “Joan Edmunds Brophy: I miss your beautiful smile, our wonderful lunches at ZA House, and our endless talks about politics, dear friend.”\n\nDiana Chapman Walsh: “Joan was my very good friend for 38 years. Some of who I am I owe directly to her. We were friends from the first day of college. She was with me in our sophomore year when I met my husband at a mixer (I thought he had his eye on her), and was a bridesmaid in our wedding. I was in her wedding too and we were relishing the prospect of growing old together. We didn’t make it. But we were lucky to have the times we did. I watched her take up a career as a teacher, after we graduated. This was something she had wanted for a very long time and she was passionate about that work.\n\nShe and her quirky, loving husband, Tom Brophy, created a huge, chaotic blended family at the end of the el in Chicago. Joan went back to law school, and became a successful lawyer at Mayer Brown and Platt. She treasured her work there and her caring colleagues.\n\nI always marveled at Joan’s amazing, old-fashioned family. I’d visit from time to time and be blown away by the complexity of it all, just managing the logistics. The loaves of bread stacked up in the kitchen said it all. The complexity of it, and the gift of it, this family full of laughter and joy and love, a family bound by deep currents of feeling, a family that could dwell in its joy and in its sorrow.\n\nWhenever Joan and I came together, we picked up where we had left off, as though the world had simply been on hold for a time, waiting for us to put aside our other obligations and come back to our ongoing conversation. It meandered unselfconsciously into every nook and cranny of our lives. There were no secrets between us—not one--and we knew one another so well.\n\nTom and I spoke several times during the last days of her life. In one of our conversations, the day after Joan died, he had moved beyond the overwhelming grief and was celebrating her life. He told me wonderful stories about her last days. “She did it,” he said, with pride and jubilation. Joan completed her life as she had always lived it, with grace and generosity to the end. And she managed everyone around her as she always had, with a light and irresistible touch--Joan at her loving, laughing best. She loved to laugh.\n\nMy favorite of Tom’s stories was about the presidential election. Joan was a died-in-the-wool Democrat and so was Tom. They had watched the two conventions together, he said, although Joan was very sick. Afterward, deferring to Tom’s expertise in things political as Joan always did, she asked when the post-convention polls would give an indication of how Gore had done. Then she slipped into one of the long, deep sleeps that consumed her toward the end. A couple of days later, she awoke and, as though picking up a thread from a moment moment before, asked Tom if the polls were in. When he said yes and that Gore had done well, she said lightly that it was time to go back to the hospital. She didn’t want an ambulance, so they took the car. On the way, Joan asked Tom, “Do we have time for a quick stop, honey?” He couldn’t imagine what she needed, but said, “Sure, why?” “I want to pick up an absentee ballot,” Joan said. “Well, Joan,” Tom replied, “Why not? After all this is Chicago.”\n\nJoan was a grand lady, smart, passionate, caring, kind, loving, and courageous -- always deeply courageous. She saw straight into my soul from the moment we met. We all have in our lives a few special people, who, for whatever reason, are able to see us whole. And, in the seeing, they help to make us whole. They are the mirrors and the teachers in our lives who guide us in our lifelong process of growing into our best selves. Joan was one of the ones whose belief in my essential goodness helped me to learn to trust it and to believe it was real. She is an indelible part of who I am in this world and always will be.”\n\nWeezie Knight: “Joan Edmonds Brophy: Joan or Joanie was always so cheerful and welcoming. She had a way of laughing and smiling that lit up her entire face, and made you feel so appreciated. I went on a ski weekend with her our freshman year, and will never forget how we laughed and laughed as we repeatedly fell on the slopes, not very good at our new found sport. I will always think of her as Diana Chapman Walsh’s roommate, and I know how Diana suffered from Joanie’s loss. All of us who knew Joan miss her terribly.”"
