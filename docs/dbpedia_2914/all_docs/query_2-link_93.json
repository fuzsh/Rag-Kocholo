        "text": "When you deplane at Norfolk International Airport, you’re immediately outside of both Norfolk and Virginia Beach and primed to start your Virginia adventure. While there aren’t any public transit options, there are designated shuttles and, of course, rental cars—which is the most convenient way to get around during your stay and enjoy everything this area has to offer.\n\nIf you start or intend to spend most of your stay in Norfolk, you’re in for a culturally rich treat. Norfolk is home to several world-class performing arts companies, which makes seeing a show both an easy and convenient choice for out of towners. See what’s being put on by the Virginia Stage Company, one of the country’s leading regional theatre companies. If music is more your jam, stop by the Virginia Symphony Orchestra to see what’s playing this season or explore the Granby Street area for live music any night of the week in small, intimate clubs. Norfolk is also a big festival destination, so depending on the timing of your visit you may be able to enjoy outdoor entertainment or a food festival at Town Point Park downtown.\n\nMaybe you’re traveling to the area for beach-bound fun in Virginia Beach rather than a taste of Norfolk. On the Atlantic Coast at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay, this resort town boasts miles of beaches and endless fun in the sun for beach bums of all ages. Play in the water, grab a surfboard and catch some waves, join a game of beach soccer, or simply lay out and soak in the sun. If you want to get away from the beach for a while, consider visiting one of the 18 National Register of Historic Places sites in town. One of these sites is the Adam Thoroughgood House, which is one of the country’s oldest surviving homes from the colonial era."
