This city’s expansive waterfronts and rich naval past invite potential residents, making it an interesting place to live. Is Norfolk a good place to live? It is not that simple as there are several factors that make this city livable. Affordability is influenced by cost of living, economic stability determined by job opportunities; future for young people shaped by educational prospects; safety affecting residents’ welfare; as well as overall quality of life which is determined by daily life experiences.\n\nLooking at what sets Norfolk apart, it can be seen that its geographic position matters most.
