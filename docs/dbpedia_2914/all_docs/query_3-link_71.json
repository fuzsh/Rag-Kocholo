        "text": "The airport is staffed and occupied by the Norfolk Airport Authority 24 hours a day, seven days a week, all year long. Even in the event of inclement weather conditions, a combination of administrative, police, fire, parking, janitorial, building maintenance, and field maintenance personnel are always on the job.\n\nVery infrequently, the runways are closed for maintenance or snow clearing; however, every effort is made to avoid disrupting airport activity. Decisions to take-off or land in questionable weather are largely the decisions of the individual airlines and though you may hear that “the airport is closed,” it may or may not be true.\n\nDuring major weather events, Norfolk Airport Authority’s Emergency Operations Center becomes operational to continually monitor and communicate weather conditions and airfield status reports with the airlines and other airport tenants. Should the airfield become unusable due to flooding, lighting or other required infrastructure requirements, we have the right and responsibility to close the airfield by issuing a Notice To Air Missions (NOTAM) that will close any portion of the airfield that is deemed unsafe, including closing the entire airport if necessary.\n\nIn real time, the airlines decide to stop flight operations well before winds and rain reach the expected potential. Prior to weather events, all loose items are secured and aircraft may be removed from the flight line and hangars when significant concerns exist. During extreme conditions only those with an operational/security requirement are permitted on the field. Additionally, shelter areas for passengers and employees are provided. Once conditions improve, assessment of the impact to the airfield is made to determine priorities required to resume normal operations.\n\nHourly parking is $5.00 per each half hour, or any part thereof, up to a maximum of $25.00 per day.\n\nDaily parking (East parking lot and garages) is $3.00 per each half hour, or any part thereof, up to a maximum of $12.00 per day.\n\nEffective January 15, 2023, cash is not accepted for parking stays. Contactless payment (Apple Pay, Google Pay), all major credit cards and VISA and Master Card debit cards that can be processed as credit cards are accepted. Debit cards cannot be used if a PIN is required. Staffed self-service and credit card only lanes are open 24 hours daily to serve all garages and Hourly surface lots. Self-pay kiosks are open 24 hours daily to serve the Daily East surface parking lot.\n\nAirport Police Officers are sworn state certified law enforcement officers and are vested with police power of arrest under Section 144 (c) (01) Charter of the City of Norfolk, Acts of the General Assembly of Virginia of 1918, as amended. They like, the City of Norfolk, the City of Virginia Beach, the City of Portsmouth, and the City of Hampton police officers, take an oath to support the constitution of the United States, the state of Virginia, and the laws of their agency’s jurisdiction.\n\nAirport Police Officers have general law enforcement duties, including maintaining regular patrols and responding to calls for service, like other police departments, however, Airport Police Officers also enforce federal laws and regulations.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration requires both commercial and recreational operators of Model Aircraft to provide notice to FAA Norfolk Tower prior to operating within 5 miles of the airport.\n\nThe operator must contact FAA Norfolk Tower at (757) 460-4102 to discuss proposed activity. FAA Norfolk Tower will assess the activity and provide feedback on whether the intended activity is allowed based on the location with respect to controlled airspace.\n\nThe FAA defines Model Aircraft as:\n\n• Flown strictly for hobby or recreational use\n\n• Weighs less than 55 pounds\n\n• Operates in a manner that does not interfere with, and gives way to, any manned aircraft\n\nNote: If Model Aircraft flown for commercial purposes does not meet the standard of Model Aircraft, the user may be required to obtain a Certificate of Authorization from the FAA prior to operating.\n\nRead FAA’s guidelines for Model Aircraft usage at: https://www.faa.gov/uas/"
