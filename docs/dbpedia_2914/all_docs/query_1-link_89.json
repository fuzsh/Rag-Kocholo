        "text": "From rural Alaska Native villages to coastal towns to urban cities, Alaska is home to a broad range of communities, each with their own unique activities, cultures, and attractions. The state's three largest cities — Anchorage, Juneau, and Fairbanks — are the state's air service hubs and are ideal jumping off points for Alaska adventures.\n\nIf you're traveling by cruise ship, you will explore the beautiful port towns along the Inside Passage region, which is home to Juneau, Alaska's state capital, along with the Tlingit, Haida, Eyak, & Tsimshian peoples. Southcentral Alaska is the traditional homeland of the Athabascan and Sugpiaq people and is the state's most populated region, with over half of the state's population and the biggest city - Anchorage. The hub of Interior Alaska is Fairbanks, connecting to the communities surrounding Denali National Park and Preserve, Athabascan villages, and the Alaska Highway.\n\nThe Arctic region is home to Utqiaġvik, the United States' northernmost city, along with many Inupiaq villages, remote communities, Nome, and Prudhoe Bay. The communities of Southwest Alaska stretch from Bethel and the Yup'ik and Cup'ik villages in western Alaska, to Kodiak and Sugpiaq villages on Kodiak Island, to Unalaska/Dutch Harbor and Unangax̂ villages and communities located along the Aleutian Islands.\n\nAlaska Cities and Population by Region\n\nArctic\n\nCity Population Sub-Region Anaktuvuk Pass 425 Brooks Range Bettles 23 Brooks Range Coldfoot 34 Brooks Range Kotzebue 3,102 Western Arctic Nome 3,699 Western Arctic Prudhoe Bay/Deadhorse 1,310 Arctic Coast St. Lawrence Island 640 (Gambell) Western Arctic Unalakleet 765 Western Arctic Utqiaġvik (Barrow) 4,927 Arctic Coast Wiseman 5 Brooks Range\n\nInterior\n\nCity Population Sub-Region Anderson 177 Fairbanks Area Cantwell 200 Denali National Park Area Central 66 Fairbanks Area Chena Hot Springs 10 Fairbanks Area Chicken 12 Alaska Highway Circle 91 Fairbanks Area Delta Junction 918 Alaska Highway Denali Park 163 Denali National Park Area Eagle 83 Alaska Highway Ester 2,416 Fairbanks Area Fairbanks 32,515 Fairbanks Area Fort Yukon 428 Northeast Interior Galena 472 Western Interior Healy 966 Denali National Park Area Kantishna seasonal Denali National Park Area Manley Hot Springs 169 Fairbanks Area Nenana 358 Fairbanks Area North Pole 2,243 Fairbanks Area Northway 234 Alaska Highway Paxson 26 Alaska Highway Ruby 139 Western Interior Salcha 977 Fairbanks Area Tok 1,243 Alaska Highway\n\nSouthcentral\n\nCity Population Sub-Region Anchor Point 2,105 Kenai Peninsula Anchorage 291,247 Anchorage Area Big Lake 3,833 Mat-Su Valley Chickaloon 254 Mat-Su Valley Chistochina 60 Copper River Valley Chitina 101 Copper River Valley Cooper Landing 344 Kenai Peninsula Copper Center 338 Copper River Valley Cordova 2,609 Prince William Sound Eagle River and Chugiak 23,036 Anchorage Area Eklutna 70 Anchorage Area Gakona 169 Copper River Valley Girdwood 2,000 Anchorage Area Glennallen 439 Copper River Valley Halibut Cove 60 Kenai Peninsula Hatcher Pass n/a Mat-Su Valley Homer 5,522 Kenai Peninsula Hope 161 Kenai Peninsula Kasilof 525 Kenai Peninsula Kenai 7,424 Kenai Peninsula Kennicott/McCarthy 107 Copper River Valley Kenny Lake 234 Copper River Valley Lake Louise 15 Copper River Valley Moose Pass 228 Kenai Peninsula Nikiski 4,456 Kenai Peninsula Ninilchik 845 Kenai Peninsula Palmer 5,888 Mat-Su Valley Portage Glacier Area n/a Anchorage Area Seldovia 235 Kenai Peninsula Seward 2,727 Kenai Peninsula Skwentna 62 Mat-Su Valley Soldotna 4,342 Kenai Peninsula Sterling 5,918 Kenai Peninsula Sutton 1,038 Mat-Su Valley Talkeetna 1,055 Mat-Su Valley Trapper Creek 499 Mat-Su Valley Valdez 3,985 Prince William Sound Wasilla 9,054 Mat-Su Valley Whittier 272 Prince William Sound Willow 2,196 Mat-Su Valley\n\nSouthwest\n\nCity Population Sub-Region Adak 171 Aleutian Islands Afognak Island 169 Kodiak Island Akhiok 63 Kodiak Island Eastern Aleutians Akutan: 1,589\n\nCold Bay: 50\n\nFalse Pass: 397\n\nKing Cove: 757 Aleutian Islands Bethel 6,325 Yukon Kuskokwim River Delta Dillingham 2,249 Bristol Bay Iliamna 108 Alaska Peninsula King Salmon 307 Alaska Peninsula Karluk 27 Kodiak Island Kodiak 5,581 Kodiak Island Larsen Bay 34 Kodiak Island McGrath 301 Alaska Peninsula Naknek 470 Alaska Peninsula Old Harbor 216 Kodiak Island Ouzinkie 109 Kodiak Island Port Alsworth 186 Alaska Peninsula Port Lions 170 Kodiak Island Pribilof Islands St. Paul: 413\n\nSt. George: 67 Pribilof Islands Sand Point 578 Aleutian Islands Unalaska/Port of Dutch Harbor 4,254 Aleutian Islands\n\nInside Passage\n\nCity Population Sub-Region Angoon 357 Northern Region Elfin Cove 24 Northern Region Gustavus/Glacier Bay 655 Glacier Bay Area Haines 2,080 Northern Region Hyder 48 Southern Region Hoonah/Icy Strait Point 931 Northern Region Juneau 32,355 Northern Region Kake 543 Southern Region Ketchikan 8,192 Southern Region Metlakatla 1,454 Southern Region Pelican 98 Northern Region Petersburg 3,398 Southern Region Port Protection 36 Southern Region Prince of Wales Island 5,753 Southern Region Sitka 8,458 Northern Region Skagway 1,240 Northern Region Tenakee Springs 116 Northern Region Wrangell 2,127 Southern Region Yakutat 657 Northern Region\n\nPopulation data taken from the 2020 U.S. Census."
