        "text": "Current Virginia Cities\n\nAlexandria, in Fairfax and Arlington Counties, was named for John Alexander, an early owner of the tract in Fairfax County on which the town was located. The act to establish Alexandria was passed in 1749. Its site had previously been known as Hunting Creek Warehouse and as Belhaven. Alexandria was incorporated as a town in 1779 and was ceded to the federal government in 1789 for use as part of the site of the new national capital. It officially became part of the District of Columbia in 1801 and was renamed Alexandria County by Congress. By an act of 9 July 1846, Alexandria County, including the town of Alexandria, was retroceded to Virginia, which took jurisdiction over the area on March 20, 1847. The town was incorporated as a city in 1852. Area: 15.2 square miles. Population: 128,283 (2000), 150,006 (2009 estimate).\n\nBristol, on the Virginia-Tennessee border in Washington County, originally was called Goodson, for Samuel Goodson who founded the town in 1850. Goodson was incorporated as a town in 1856, four years after the town of Bristol, Tennessee, was laid out in Sullivan County, Tennessee, contiguous to Goodson. In 1890, Goodson was incorporated as a city, and its name was changed to Bristol for its Tennessee neighbor. Today the two cities have separate governments but share a public library. When the Virginia-Tennessee boundary was settled in 1901, Bristol, Virginia, received from Bristol, Tennessee, the northern half of the main street between the two cities. Area: 12.9 square miles. Population: 17,637 (2000), 17,690 (2009 estimate).\n\nBuena Vista, in Rockbridge County, was built on the site of the abandoned Buena Vista iron furnace. This furnace, which was in operation as late as 1855, was named probably for the Mexican village near which General Zachary Taylor won an important battle in the Mexican War in 1847. Buena Vista was laid out in 1889 and incorporated as a town in 1890. It was incorporated as a city in 1892. Area: 6.8 square miles. Population: 6,349 (2000), 6,222 (2009 estimate).\n\nCharlottesville, in Albemarle County, was named for Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, the wife of King George III, and was established in 1762. The county seat of Albemarle County, Charlottesville was incorporated as a town in 1801 and as a city in 1888. Area: 10.3 square miles. Population: 40,099 (2000), 42,218 (2009 estimate).\n\nChesapeake, which is named for the Chesapeake Bay, comprises the former Norfolk County and the former city of South Norfolk. It was formed by court order on January 1, 1963 with the merger of the county and city, both of which thereby became extinct. Area: 340.7 square miles. Population: 199,184 (2000), 222,455 (2009 estimate).\n\nColonial Heights, in Chesterfield County, is located on the heights overlooking the Appomattox River and takes its name from the fact that the Marquis de Lafayette placed his artillery, known as the Colonials, on the heights to shell British positions in Petersburg in 1781. The campaign to have Colonial Heights incorporated as a town began in 1920 and was accomplished by court order in 1926. Colonial Heights became a city by court order on March 19, 1948. Area: 7.5 square miles. Population: 16,897 (2000), 17,823 (2009 estimate).\n\nCovington, in Alleghany County, was named probably for General Leonard Covington (1768–1813), of Maryland, who died in the War of 1812 and for whom several other United States towns and counties were named about the same time. It was established in 1818 and first incorporated as a town in 1833. The charter was repealed in 1839 and the town was incorporated again in 1873. The county seat of Alleghany County, Covington became a city by court order on December 22, 1952. Area: 5.7 square miles. Population: 6,303 (2000), 6,149 (2009 estimate).\n\nDanville, in Pittsylvania County, was named for the Dan River on which the city is located. Danville was established in 1793, was incorporated as a town in 1830, and became a city in 1890. The town of North Danville, incorporated in 1877 and renamed Neopolis in 1894, was added in 1896. Area: 43.1 square miles. Population: 48,411 (2000), 44,400 (2009 estimate).\n\nEmporia, in Greensville County, was formed in 1887 from the merger of Hicksford and Belfield. Because of friction between the two villages, Benjamin D. Tillar, a county native and member of the Virginia House of Delegates, named the town after Emporia, Kansas, the hometown of one of his associates in the Atlantic and Danville Railroad. Emporia comes from the Latin word meaning place of plenty where business is transacted. The General Assembly revoked the town charter in 1888, a year after it had incorporated Emporia, and did not reincorporate the town until 1892. Emporia became a city by court order on July 31, 1967. Area: 6.9 square miles. Population: 5,665 (2000), 5,635 (2009 estimate).\n\nFairfax, in Fairfax County, was first called Providence. It was established at the site of the county courthouse in 1805. After the town named Fairfax in Culpeper County was changed to Culpeper in 1859, Fairfax County took the name Fairfax for its county seat. Incorporated by the General Assembly as a town on 15 January 1875 and reincorporated in 1892, Fairfax became a city by court order on July 1, 1961. Area: 6.3 square miles. Population: 21,498 (2000), 24,665 (2009 estimate).\n\nFalls Church, in Fairfax County, was named for an Anglican church erected about 1769.

The origin of the name is unclear. It could have been named for Benjamin Franklin, patriot and statesman; for a man named Franklin who kept a store in the vicinity; or for the exclamation of a railroad section foreman who drove a spike into a crosstie and exclaimed, “This shall be Franklin!” It was a post village in 1855 and was incorporated as a town in 1876. Franklin became a city by a court order of December 22, 1961. Area: 8.4 square miles. Population: 8,346 (2000), 8,814 (2009 estimate).\n\nFredericksburg, in Spotsylvania County, was named for Frederick Louis, Prince of Wales, eldest son of George II.

Area: 8.2 square miles. Population: 6,837 (2000), 6,880 (2009 estimate).\n\nHampton was located in Elizabeth City County, which is now extinct. It takes its name from Hampton Creek, earlier called Southampton River in honor of the earl of Southampton, an important figure in the Virginia Company of London. An Indian town stood on the site in 1607, when Captain John Smith visited the area. The colonists established a village there in 1610 and a trading post in 1630. Hampton was established by an act of assembly in 1680 and was designated as a port of entry in 1705. It was first incorporated as a town in March 1849, but the act was repealed the following December. It was incorporated again in 1852, but the act of incorporation was repealed in 1860. The General Assembly incorporated the town of Hampton in 1887 for a third time, and it became a city by court order on March 4, 1908.

Francis Eppes, who arrived in Virginia on the ship Hopewell, patented land near Charles City Point in 1635. He named part of his property Hopewell Farm. The town was known as City Point until 1913, when E. I. Du Pont de Nemours and Company purchased Hopewell Farm and established a factory and a settlement for munitions workers there. Hopewell was never incorporated as a town but was incorporated as a city by act of assembly on February 26, 1916 to take effect July 1, 1916. Area: 10.2 square miles.

The Old Dominion Land Company bought land there in 1880 and began laying out a new village in October.
