        "text": "Please respect your fellow guests, volunteers, vendors and Garden staff while enjoying the peaceful beauty of nature. Norfolk Botanical Garden is an accredited outdoor museum and is committed to providing a safe, inclusive and respectful environment for all to enjoy. Garden staff, volunteers, vendors and all visitors have the right to an environment free from abusive and/or threatening behavior, including the use of derogatory or offensive language. In the event of any such behavior or other harmful conduct towards Garden staff, volunteers, visitors or property, Norfolk Botanical Garden reserves any and all rights permitted by applicable law, including a request to leave the premises, contacting emergency services, revocation of membership privileges and prosecution. Norfolk Botanical Garden also reserves the right to determine what constitutes unacceptable behavior.\n\nYes! Wheelchairs are available to rent for free from our Baker Hall Visitor Center. We hold on to an ID while you have the wheelchair checked out. Wheelchairs are available on a first come, first served basis. It’s also important to note that some of our pathways are permeable, packed gravel pathways. These paths can be a little tricky to navigate with wheelchairs, strollers, or wagons but it is doable. There are portions of the permeable pathway that are on a slight incline/decline including the road from the back of Baker Hall to the Rose Garden, the road from Rose Garden bridge to NATO Bridge and the road from Rose Garden Bridge to Wildflower Meadow.\n\nClick here to find out what is in bloom when you are visiting. The Director of Horticulture also publishes weekly recommendations which you can find on a chalkboard inside the Baker Hall Visitor Center.\n\nPicnicking is welcomed and encouraged. Please leave the area as you found it. The Garden follows City of Norfolk rules in regards to open container alcohol which means it is not allowed on property.\n\nSingle-use plastics are the number one pollutant on land and in our waterways. Our mission is to LEAD through environmental action and INSPIRE through education and connection to nature. Please bring a reusable container to be filled at the many cold, filtered water dispensers located throughout the Garden (indicated on the Garden map by a water droplet symbol).\n\nThe Garden is a self-guided walking tour. We do offer guided tram tours which are included with Garden admission. Tram times vary based on the season and day of the week, so we encourage you to check the website or call 757-441-5830 ext. 0 for the tram schedule before visiting."
