        "text": "Since its grand opening in 1972, Chrysler Hall has served as the premiere performing arts center of Hampton Roads. After celebrating our 40th season the number of events hosted annually has grown to more than 140, with attendance of more than 150,000 patrons a year. Many regionally based arts organizations call Chrysler Hall their home including Virginia Symphony Orchestra, Norfolk Forum, the Virginia Arts Festival, Broadway in Norfolk, and Generic Theater. During any given season, Chrysler Hall will host acclaimed artists from every discipline such as major Broadway productions, classical concerts, contemporary artists, family theatre and comedy events.\n\nLittle Hall\n\nThe Generic Theater holds a unique place in the cultural life of Hampton Roads as the area’s “off-Broadway” playhouse. Since 1981, it has challenged and delighted audiences with new and off-beat theater fare. The Generic is always looking for plays of artistic merit which, for a variety of reasons, are unlikely to be produced on other stages. They feature a full regular season, premiering new and local works in their home “down under” Chrysler Hall (also known as “Little Hall”).\n\nStage Left Lounge\n\nThe Stage Left Lounge is Chrysler Hall’s best-kept secret! Available as an upgrade on select performances, the Stage Left Lounge preshow package is a must for anyone who wants early access in an inviting atmosphere. Exclusive to ticketholders."
