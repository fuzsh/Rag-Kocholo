        "text": "One of the more distinctive cities in Virginia, Norfolk is a bustling, busy place with an exciting vibe and a phenomenal downtown right on the water. If you’re planning on living in Norfolk (or just arrived) and have questions about your new town, iStorage has your answers! Read on to discover the pros and cons of living in Norfolk, VA, below and get to know this fantastic city and everything it offers!\n\nLiving in Norfolk, VA\n\nLiving in Norfolk combines small-town charm with big-city amenities and attractions. The city is a genuine melting pot of cultures, people, and cuisines and offers the best of many worlds. Most communities here are quiet, safe, and well-kept, with good schools and responsive, respectful police departments. The air is clean, thanks to being so near the coast, and there’s more to do here than in many similar cities thanks to a true community-minded spirit.\n\nWhat is Norfolk, VA, Known For?\n\nNorfolk is known for having America’s largest naval station and also being the HQ of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Norfolk is also known as a coastal city with miles of pristine beaches, lovely seaside communities, and abundant wildlife to explore and enjoy. Lastly, Norfolk is recognized as an affordable, safe place to live, with multiple housing options and a large retired population.\n\nFactors to Consider if Moving to Norfolk, VA\n\nWeather\n\nThe weather in Norfolk is a combination of many things, but if we’re being honest, one of the most prominent is the humidity. Being right on the Atlantic coast is the reason, and it makes for good weather most of the year that’s never sweltering or freezing but is highly humid for about 6 months. Norfolk sees about 120 days of precipitation annually.\n\nCost of Living\n\nWe’re glad to report that the overall cost index in Norfolk is 8 points below the national average at 91.8/100. Indeed, all of the significant cost indices in Norfolk are below average, except for slightly higher healthcare. As you’ll see below, housing costs are a major reason for the city’s affordable cost of living. In short, Norfolk is an affordable city, especially for the east coast.\n\nSchool System\n\nThere’s no sugarcoating the fact that Norfolk’s’ schools could do a little better. Niche gives them a C+ which is average, but if you want your kid to be above average, that won’t cut it. Larchmont Elementary School is the best in the city, with an A-. No other school gets better than a B+ (there are 3), and the rest are all B or lower. That’s not great, considering there are 47 public schools in the city.\n\nRecreation Activities\n\nRecreation is where Norfolk truly shines, thanks to being on the Atlantic coast. There’s much to see and do here, especially from May through October. Boating and fishing opportunities are abundant, and there are just as many parks, recreational areas, and more. Several museums are in Norfolk, as well as forts, theatres, and minor-league baseball.\n\nReal Estate Costs\n\nReal estate prices are one of the main reasons Norfolk is an affordable city. The housing cost index is 83.1, 17 points lower than the U.S. average. It should be noted that just over half of the folks who live in Norfolk rent their homes (56%), which is surprising when you consider the median home cost is an affordable $223,300. Median rents are $1,114 for a 2-bedroom apartment, which is affordable compared to similar cities.\n\nPros and Cons of Living in Norfolk, VA\n\nPROS\n\nAffordable housing\n\nVibrant arts and culture\n\nBeautiful beaches\n\nLarge military presence\n\nPhenomenal cuisine\n\nHighly diverse city\n\nRich cultural heritage\n\nCONS\n\nTraffic problems\n\nHigher than-average crime rates\n\nLower-than-average schools and test scores\n\nLimited jobs\n\nBest Neighborhoods in Norfolk, VA\n\nNorfolk has many top-rated communities, so we suggest taking at least a few days to see them all before settling on one to call home.
