Despite these numbers, the safety perception in Norfolk varies, with certain areas being more prone to crime than others.\n\nDowntown Norfolk and areas like Ghent are generally considered safe, and the public transportation system is deemed safe during commuting hours. Visitors and residents are advised to be aware of their surroundings and to stay in well-populated and well-lit areas, especially at night.\n\nThe city’s approach to safety is multi-faceted, focusing on improving public safety through a combination of advanced technology, community policing, and public engagement.\n\nBy addressing crime with a broad strategy, Norfolk aims to enhance the overall well-being of its community and maintain a safe environment for its residents and visitors."
