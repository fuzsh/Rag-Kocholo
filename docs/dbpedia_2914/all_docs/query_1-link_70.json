        "text": "Nauticus, also known as the National Maritime Center, is a maritime-themed science center and museum. It is conveniently located on the downtown waterfront in Norfolk, Virginia. This location offers visitors easy access to the museum and its exhibits, as well as stunning views of the waterfront.\n\nUSS Wisconsin at Nauticus\n\nOne of the major attractions at Nauticus is the USS Wisconsin, one of the largest battleships ever built. It arrived at the museum on December 7, 2000, marking the 57th anniversary of its launching in 1943. The USS Wisconsin opened for main deck tours on April 16, 2001, offering visitors a unique opportunity to explore this historic battleship.\n\nExhibits and Features at Nauticus\n\nNauticus offers a wide range of features and exhibits for visitors of all ages. The museum features hands-on exhibits, interactive theaters, aquaria, and digital high-definition films. It also offers an extensive variety of educational programs. Nauticus has a high-definition large screen theater that shows several nautically-related films on a rotating basis. In May 2023, Nauticus opened a new exhibit called Norfolk in Time. Another new exhibit, Aquaticus, aimed at younger patrons, opened in June 2023."
