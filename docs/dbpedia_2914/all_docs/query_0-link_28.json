        "text": "Companies located in areas with an affordable cost of living are better able to attract and retain skilled employees. Greater Norfolk’s national average cost allows companies to offer competitive wages to employees while maintaining reasonable labor expenses. In turn, this increases the value of employee earnings and company profits moreover other cities across the country. Living in the Hampton Roads region is cheaper than the national average in terms of housing, transportation, and health care.\n\nThe Cost of Living Index is interpreted as follows. The national average is set as the base of comparison and is thus 100. Any value above 100 indicates the Cost of Living in the selected area is higher, meaning it is more expensive to live there compared to the national average. Any value below 100 indicates the Cost of Living in the selected area is lower, meaning it is cheaper to live there compared to the national average. In the table for the Norfolk, VA MSA Cost of Living, the Composite Index is 100.2, meaning it is very slightly more expensive to live in the Norfolk, VA MSA compared to the national average, or, it is 0.2% more expensive to live in the Norfolk, VA MSA compared to the national average.\n\nNorfolk, VA MSA Cost of Living Index 2023 Annual Average\n\nCategoryIndex (National Average = 100.0)Composite Index100.2Groceries100.3Housing93.1Transportation96.2Health Care94.9\n\nSource: The Council for Community and Economic Research (C2ER), Cost of Living Index, 2023 Annual Average, Section 1 Index, Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) – Urban Area Noted\n\nThe overall Cost of Living in the Norfolk, VA MSA is lower than the Cost of Living in many of its direct competitors, as noted in the accompanying table, making it a very attractive location for businesses.\n\nCost of Living Index – 2023 Annual Average"
