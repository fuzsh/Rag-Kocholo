        "meta_description": "Located in the heart of Coastal Virginia near the Chesapeake Bay, Norfolk is a city of mermaids anchored by a vibrant downtown and steeped in maritime history. Home to the world’s largest naval base and the North American headquarters for NATO, Norfolk is known for its Navy presence and so much more. The city’s rich and proudly diverse culture flows through its museums, burgeoning performing and visual arts scenes and fabulous festivals. With 144 miles of shoreline, Norfolk is perfectly situated for water activities like kayaking, sailing, boating and sprawling on the sand for a relaxing beach day. There’s also plenty to do on land, whether exploring the Elizabeth River Trail, wandering among blossoms at the Norfolk Botanical Garden, visiting over 700 species at the Virginia Zoo, cheering on the Norfolk Tides or learning about the city’s fascinating architecture or vivid murals through a walking tour. The passion and creativity of local chefs, bakers and makers truly shines through Norfolk’s dynamic culinary scene. All within city limits, diners can indulge in plump oysters from nearby estuaries, farm-to-table fare, international eats and delicate pastries, plus exceptional varieties of Virginia wines and beers, craft cocktails and specialty coffees. Equally imaginative is Norfolk’s shopping scene, from antiques and locally crafted wares to the finest fashion and furniture. Whether visiting to learn, work, play or stay, Norfolk welcomes any and all to chart their course and experience as much of this unique city as possible.",
