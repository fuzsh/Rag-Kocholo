Students grow into confident, compassionate leaders through a supportive network of mentors, confidants, and advocates.\n\n“The lessons I've learned regarding discipline, teamwork, and mental strength have been crucial to my development as a person.\" Dillon '16\n\n“The student-teacher relationships at NA are a facet of this school that makes NA stand out from any other school.\" Emily '18\n\nStudents and faculty come together at round tables for family-style lunch, a beloved NA tradition. An array of delicious and healthy choices every day makes lunch an eagerly-anticipated event. Conversations flow, as students share stories--about class projects, new pets, and everything in between.\n\nPlayed in the Kennon Forum (The Pit) in the center of campus, Pit Ball is played by defending your step from contact with a ball using only your feet.\n\nOpen lockers are the school's most visible emblem of the Honor System and the way that it shapes every aspect of school life. Open and trusting relationships are a hallmark of school culture; students treasure the honesty that characterizes their interactions with their teacher-coaches and peers."
