He was nominally king of Spain from June 6, 1808 to December 11, 1813, but from June 13, 1812 he was back in France.\n\nBonaparte was born as Giuseppe Buonaparte to Carlo Buonaparte and Letizia Ramolino at Corte in Corsica. As a lawyer, politician, and diplomat, he served in the Cinq-Cents and was the French ambassador to Rome. He married Julie Clary on August 1, 1794 in Cuges-les-Pins, France. They had had three daughters, Julie Joséphine Bonaparte (1796-1796), Zénaïde Laetitia Julie Bonaparte (1801-1854) and Charlotte Napoléone Bonaparte (1802-1839). He claimed the surviving two daughters as his heirs. He also sired two children with Maria Giulia, the Countess of Atri (Giulio, born 1806 and Teresa, born 1808).\n\nThe Château de Villandry had been seized by the French Revolutionary government and in the early 1800s Joseph's brother, Emperor Napoleon, acquired the château for him. In 1806, Bonaparte was given military command of Naples, and shortly afterward was made king by Napoleon. He became later after his sister's husband, Joachim Murat, was made king of Naples. The Spanish people nicknamed him Pepe Botella (\"Bottle Joe\") and the usual hypothesis has to do with an alleged tendency to drunkennes.\n\nRead the entire wikipedia article here.\n\nMarie Julie Bonaparte (née Clary), Queen Consort of Naples and Sicily, Queen Consort of Spain and the Indies (December 26, 1771, Marseille – April 7, 1845, Florence) was the wife of King Joseph Bonaparte of Naples and Sicily, later Spain and the Indies.\n\nJulie Clary was born in Marseille, France, the daughter of François Clary (Marseille, St. Ferreol, February 24, 1725 – Marseille, January 20, 1794), a wealthy silk manufacturer and merchant, and his second wife (married on June 26, 1759) Françoise Rose Somis (Marseille, St. Ferreol, August 30, 1737 – Paris, January 28, 1815). He had been previously married at Marseille, April 13, 1751 to Gabrielle Fléchon (1732 – May 3, 1758), without issue.
