        "text": "Robert de Clary, a knight from Picardy, who presents the nonofficial view of the Crusade, as it appeared to an ordinary soldier.\n\nOn the 16th of August 1798 he married Desiree Clary (1777-1860), the daughter of a Marseilles banker, and sister of Joseph Bonaparte's wife.\n\nHis sister Anna, who inherited it, married Freiherr Hieronymus von Clary, who assumed the additional name and arms of Aldringen.\n\nHis successor, Count Clary, began by withdrawing the ordinances which had been the cause of so much trouble, but it was now too late to restore peace.\n\nClary explained that this was impossible, but he gave a formal pledge that he would not use it.\n\nAfter a brief interval he was succeeded by Count Thun and then by Count Clary, whose government repealed the decrees that had to a certain extent granted equal rights to the Bohemian language.\n\nBy evening I was beginning to feel restless and had really achy thighs so had a bath with clary sage burning in the background.\n\nIn addition this is one of the few sites in the county where meadow clary grows.\n\nThey suggested I take a bath, so Graham ran me a bath with more lavender and clary sage oils.\n\nAfter spending a short time in Paris, where he was disgusted with the excesses of the Jacobins, he settled at Marseilles and married Mlle Julie Clary, daughter of a merchant of that town.\n\nIt opens with the citric brilliance of mandarin and bergamot, the richness of the Thuja tree and the edgy herbal pungency of Clary sage."
