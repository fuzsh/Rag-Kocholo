        "text": "Désirée and Julie Clary were the daughters of François Clary, a silk manufacturer and merchant in Marseille, France.\n\nDésirée became engaged to Joseph Bonaparte. Joseph's brother, Napoleon Bonaparte was introduced to the Clary family.\n\nReportedly, it was Napoleon who suggested that Joseph should be engaged to Julie. Instead Napoleon should be engaged to Désirée.\n\nThe Clary sisters and Bonaparte brothers approved this suggestion.\n\nJoseph married Julie. Désirée became engaged to Napoleon. She did not marry Napoleon.\n\nSuppose Napoleon marries Désirée. He does not meet Josephine. What happens then?\n\nDepends on Napoleon's sense of destiny...\n\n...lf he gets to Paris, there could still be the whiff of grapeshot to deter the Paris mob...\n\n...Someone else has been reading Anne-Marie Selinko. Desiree will not stand in his way and she's younger than Josephine, so I see a Napoleonic dynasty. But it's bad news for Marshal Bernardotte and Scandinavia...\n\nThe drama that Napoleon endured with Josephine was a bit ridiculous at times and clearly became a distraction. It was said I think by Augereau (not the best source, but still) that Napoleon's concern and obsession over Josephine's whereabouts leading up to the battles during the third relief of Mantua almost cost the Army of Italy dearly and that while Napoleon was stellar as usual in battle, it was a near run event.\n\nMaybe him marrying someone who was less holding over his emotions and temperament as well as being likely more down to earth would help him."
