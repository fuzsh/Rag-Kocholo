        "text": "Queen Consort of Naples then Spain\n\nMarie-Julie Clary, the daughter of a rich merchant and shipowner of the city, was born in Marseille on December 26, 1771.\n\nShe married on August 1, 1794 in Cuges-les-Pins [43.27609, 5.70198], a village in the heart of the Sainte-Baume massif (southeast France), Joseph Bonaparte, older brother of Napoleon.\n\nDependent on her husband's political career, Julie thus became Queen of Naples in March 1806. However, it was not until March 31 1808, two years later, that she joined him there. Yet not for a long time: on May 21, Joseph received the order from Napoleon to join him in Bayonne, and he left his kingdom three days later.\n\nIn July 1808, Joseph abdicated the crown of Naples to become King of Spain and the Indies. But Julie did not accompany him to Madrid, preferring to stay in Paris, in Fontainebleau or in their castle of Mortefontaine [49.11002, 2.60335] surrounded by a 750 hectare park, in the Oise department. However, she made herself useful to her husband by being a wise advisor, and, quite unofficially, his ambassador in Paris.\n\nAfter the fall of the French Empire, she successively stayed in Prangins in Switzerland, then – separated from Joseph – in Frankfurt am Main, Brussels [Bruxelles], and finally Florence [Firenze], in the Serristori Palace.\n\nIt was in the Tuscan capital that Julie died on April 7, 1845. She was buried there in the Santa Croce basilica [43.76867, 11.26220], alongside her husband, who died eight months earlier after having returned to end his life with her."
