        "text": "The year 2012 has been a tumultuous for those who value the world and characters created by Edgar Rice Burroughs a hundred years ago in 1912. It is a year that began with hope, tinged with concern, as the rollout for Disney’s John Carter promised that at last, after 100 years, moviegoers around the world would be exposed to Barsoom — but, based on the trailers and posters being offered by Disney, there was a very real concern as to how many prospective fans, unimpressed by what they were seeing, would ignore the film when it opened. When the film opened at $30.6M in the US — far below the $55-60M needed for it to be considered a successful launch, it seemed likely it would quickly pass into oblivion.\n\nBut in spite of the mixed critical response and indifferent box office figures — the reaction of fans who saw the film and were unexpected enchanted by what they saw was swift and impressive. Six days into the theatrical run Erik Jessen, one of the editors who worked on the movie, started a Facebook group with some other members of the crew, giving it the name “Take Me Back to Barsoom! I Want John Carter to Have a Sequel!” Other sequel focused groups, started for other movies with similar box office results such as Prince of Persia and Van Helsing, had faield to take route. The Prince of Persia group topped at at 325 members; Van Helsing never drew more than 160.\n\nBut unlike the others, what would become known as the Back to Barsoom Facebook Group did not fade away after a few hundred members joined. Within two days its ranks had grown to 5,000 members and it continues today with more than 11,500 members from more than 70 countries who have found something special in the cross-century collaboraton of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Andrew Stanton.\n\nOne of the members of the Facebook Group, Jan Austin, started a petition (you can click here and add your signature) which has garnered 5,500 signatures, with petitioners invited to give their reasons for petitioning for a sequel. The group sponsored Last Trip to Barsoom — a sendoff for the film on its last day of its theatrical run at El Capitan Theater in Los Angeles; they sponsored a table at Comic-con; group members Maddie Gan and Daria Brooks, in addition to seeing the film 39 times in theaters, handed out DVDs and Blu-rays to first responders in their area; and on December 1 sponsored a special screening at the Aero theater in Santa Monica. Meanwhile here on the John Carter Files, our hit counter rolled past the 4 Million mark on Christmas Eve, and John Carter and the Gods of Hollywood, released in early December, is off to a promising start with an average user rating of 4.9 out of 5 stars after the first 16 reviews are in, plus our original John Carter Fan Trailer now has 212,000 views, and our second, “Heritage” is almost to 150,000 views.\n\nThose signing the petition are given the opportunity to voice their reasons for supporting the call for a continuation of John Carter in theaters. Following is a selection of their responses — voice from all over Jasoom, calling for a return to Barsoom. (Sign the petition of you haven’t done so, and/or leave your thoughts about the continuation of the John Carter film franchise at the bottom of this post.)\n\nAlso — remember to use the Facebook Share button and/or the Tweet This Button at the top to help spread the word.\n\nFans Explain: “Why I’m Signing the John Carter Sequel Petition”\n\nJan Austin,,,,Burbank, California,2012-03-29,Take John Carter Back to Barsoom! We want a John Carter Sequel!\n\nJoachim Rafaelsen,DrÃ¸bak,,1440,Norway,2012-03-29,”The John Carter of Mars trilogy may well turn out to be the most important epic adventure saga of our time and fans all over the world are falling in love with this movie. The future and legacy of this popcultural icon is in the hands of the Walt Disney company. I hope and believe that they are ready to carry the torch with pride. Finish the trilogy and it wil surely be loved and cherished for generations. The greatest marketing failure in the history of cinema or the new “”Star Wars””… Your call Mr. Ross.”\n\nKhanada Taylor,Houston,TX,77099,United States,2012-03-29,Great idea to do a petition! Everyone I know who has actually seen the film loves it. It’s those who have not seen it and who have formed uninformed opinions of it that are dissing it. Better launch and marketing would have made a world of difference for a film that soars! So nice that the fans are pulling together to change the tide of this film’s reception! We want our sequel!!! Go Barsoom!!!\n\nJohn Swinford,Redmond,WA,98052,United States,2012-03-30,”Because the movie was better than the box office makes it seem, and I believe a sequel could be even better.”\n\nAdam Seebach,bloomingburg,NY,12721,United States,2012-03-30,People have waited for so long to see A Princess Of Mars adapted for the big screen. I myself have been waiting since junior high. This adaptation was done beautifully and I’ll be damned if I’m not gonna get a sequel just because the film was marketed to audiences poorly. Screw That!\n\nMichael Harrold,St.Mary of the Woods,IN,47876,United States,2012-03-30,John Carter was a wonderful film and there is an eager audience wanting the story to continue!\n\nGary Hatch,Encino,CA,91436,United States,2012-03-30,”The Movie was excellent! However, the marketing left a lot to be desired. I would very much like to see more John Carter movies!”\n\nBrian Fasick,Middleville,MI,49333,United States,2012-03-30,”JOHN CARTER is exceptional film making by extraordinarily talented people. It deserves sequels as a quality franchise, and properly marketed WILL be financially rewarding.”\n\nKavin Kalai Selvan,Petaling Jaya,,47301,Malaysia,2012-03-30,”Hi M.Ross,first of all i have to say that the movie critics have it all wrong and the movie is freakin bloody awesome.At first i didnt know what John Carter was about the entire marketing of John Carter for me was one billboard on a major highway so when i walked into the cinema wiht my sibilings i didnt know what to expect.After the movie i did somethinmg i have done in a long TIME,i stayed back until the entire credits were over lookin for a sign of a sequel.My siblings and i were the only ones left in the hall(not including clean up crew) immediately i went homw and started googling John Carter sequels,u can only imagine my horror upon discovering the movie critics giving a horrible review which frankly is reserved for the entire twilight series. Concluding my plea to you Mr.Ross is not to let the potential money bag slip throught your fingers,now it may seem like a flop all u hvae to do is give it time=Good things come to those who wait. Thank you Sir(if u have taken the time to read this)”\n\nJack Mort,Belvedere,SC,29841,United States,2012-03-30,”John Carter is a fantastic film, one of the best I have ever seen. I am a lifelong fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs and this film captures the spirit of what E.R.B. intended for his readers to feel.”\n\nJulien Dupuy,Paris,,75017,France,2012-03-30,”I love this movie, Andrew Stanton did an amazing job. We need more movies like John Carter, it’s Hollywood at its best.”\n\nThomas Lesourd,beuvron en auge,,14430,France,2012-03-30,Because it’s a f****ng good film !\n\nFerdinand Abueg,Taguig City,,1634,Philippines,2012-03-30,”This is a movie that has shaped many successful epic movies that a lot of people have learned to love. John Carter is a great film pm its own merit, and there’s still a lot to Barsoom that can be explored.”\n\nLou Matos,Brooklyn,NY,11201,United States,2012-03-30,I really want to see more of this world in sequels. Disney’s fail will prevent that. But the fans will let their voices be heard.\n\nJeff Carlisle,Columbus,OH,43214,United States,2012-03-30,”I am signing because this was the best adventure film I have seen in years–and most of the people I know who have seen this film enjoyed it immensely. Had it not been for major mistakes in Marketing (including changing the name from JOHN CARTER OF MARS), I think this film would have done spectacular business. I can’t wait to go back to Barsoom!”\n\nBrad Blake,San Jose,CA,95127,United States,2012-03-30,”There remains a HUGE John Carter Worldwide Audience that will see a second and third movie, with budgets in line at $150M per film, you cannot miss! This first one is a remarkable film, and it’s such a tragedy the marketing was off target and for whatever reason Disney moved on. All of us surely hope you’ll reconsider green lighting two sequels.”\n\nJordan Connatser,Rossville,GA,30741,United States,2012-03-30,”Because I LOVE John Carter, I haven’t felt that way seeing a movie in a long time :)”\n\nTony Simmons,Panama City,FL,32405,United States,2012-03-30,”My column in today’s Panama City News Herald and online at NewsHerald.com sums up my feelings on this.”\n\nRobert Stanton,Papillion,NE,68133,United States,2012-03-30,”This is the finest movie ever made. Period. The aliens were not muppets, the supporting cast and casting overall was perfect. This movie could not have been better made. Perfect pacing, scope and attention to detail. What a ride, what a ride! Do you like old-time Westerns? Roman-style intrigue? Science fiction? Welcome to the originator of all these genres, Edgar Rice Burrough’s faithful rendition of John Carter a Princess of Mars!”\n\nLawrence Taylor,Bremerton,WA,98312,United States,2012-03-30,Just read second book. I want to see it! Mikhail Zhivuhotsky,Minsk,,220040,Belarus,2012-03-30,”The first movie was amazing! It’s not “”The biggest bomb in history””, it can be modern classic! Please, take John Carter back to Barsoom!”\n\nPeter Hawke,Bethlehem,PA,18018,United States,2012-03-30,A fantastic film. Have seen it 5 times. Best movie so far this year. I want a sequal.\n\nMark Wheatley,Westminster,MD,21158,United States,2012-03-30,”More than ever, we need the SENSE OF WONDER that can be found in JOHN CARTER!”\n\nTerry Kennedy,Ajax Ont,,L1S3W4,Canada,2012-03-30,”I thought that the movie was well done and worthy of a sequel,it stayed very true to the source material and was fun to watch.”\n\nAndrew Steger,Fort Collins,CO,80525,United States,2012-03-30,Because the movie was great fun and deserved more and better support from Disney. Andrew Stanton has done nothing but help bring billions to Disney and deserved more respect and support for the movie. The movie at this point has made over $265 million worldwide and will continue to grow.\n\nKai Sacco,Miami,FL,33137,United States,2012-03-30,I think it’s safe to say that the bad marketing single-handedly killed John Carter’s chances at the box office. Why bury the movie’s chances if the studio itself is at fault for it’s demise? The feedback from the general audience has been overwhelmingly positive and the movie itself received more favorable reviews than initially anticipated. TAKE US BACK TO BARSOOM!\n\nHoward Rosen,Middletown,NY,10941,United States,2012-03-30,I want another John Carter film. This movie was too good not have sequels. The Critics were wrong and the viewers are right. Bring us back to Barsoom.\n\nJohannes Rebhan,Daisendorf,,88718,Germany,2012-03-30,”A failure in properly advertising the right elements of the movie to the audience (that clearly IS out there), should not be the doom of a great potential franchise. The possibilities for this franchise are massive, easily in the scope of a new Star Wars, because it’s such a different license, with a great mixture of Sci-Fi / Fantasy / Mythology / Mystery, that after 100 years, it’s still relevant and strong. Don’t let this opportunity slip! Grasp it! Push for a proper marketing campaign for the Bluray/DVD and you’ll see just how much money Barsoom is going to make you!”\n\nKaren Rush,Beaumont,TX,77706,United States,2012-03-30,”The movie is fabulous–every single aspect of it! A wonderful adaptation of the Princess of Mars. Great acting and effects. All I dreamed it could be–please complete this classic story! And sell us some stuffed toy woolas!”\n\nDAVE VANNER,SHREWSBURY,,SY2 6SP,United Kingdom,2012-03-30,BECAUSE I LOVED HE BOOKS AND I LOVE THE FILM….THE DIRECTOR GOT IT SO VERY RIGHT BUT YOU GUYS PROMOTED IT SO WRONG\n\nSharon Yates,Nantwich,,CW5 6DE,United Kingdom,2012-03-30,”As a life long ERB fan, and loving this movie we need John Carter back on Barsoom…and soon!”\n\nMartin Andersson,Gothenburg,,414 81,Sweden,2012-03-30,”The movie blew me away — an excellent pulp action adventure of the old school, a worthy movie version of an important classic of its genre. It deserves better than it got.”\n\nKathy Lucero,El Paso,TX,79904,United States,2012-03-30,”John Carter is a beautiful movie…Masterfully done..and deserves a sequel…ERB fans love this movie, and we really want a sequel…with the same cast….Thanks and best wishes…”\n\nAndres Pedraza,Del Water Gap,PA,18327,United States,2012-03-30,”The movie was magnificent. Don’t let malicious, so-called critics kill this franchise. Especially since worldwide revenues far surpass US revenues on the film and may even eliminate the ‘loss’.”\n\nSteve Hathaway,Hercules,CA,94547-2706,United States,2012-03-30,I thought the movie was better than most critics had made it out to be. I particularly liked the 19th century segments and the Dejas Thoris character and actress. I would love to see sequel.\n\nBenoÃ®t PrÃ©zeau,Boucherville,,J4B 1S1,Canada,2012-03-30,”There are not many sci-fi movies with original visual designs, John Carter is one of them and I would like to see more of them.”\n\nDaniel Winston Ames,Springfield,VA,22152,United States,2012-03-30,Loved the books and movie and just have to have a sequel. Gods of Mars is one of the best 2nd stories ever…\n\nSanford Williams,Geneva,AL,36340,United States,2012-03-30,JOHN CARTER is a timeless epic hero that deserves both a franchise and merchandising.

The only reason this movie is not doing so well is the marketing and the prejudices, everyone seems to think that every sci-fi movie with a big budget is meant to flop, specially if it comes from Disney, and also the marketing for this movie is completely and absolutely pure crap!!! It’s the worst marketing I’ve ever seen for a movie! And it makes me think that some people there didn’t believe in this movie from the very beggining, so it’s extremely important for me to show them wrong and fight for an amazing movie that could’ve been such an amazing thing (the AMAZING thing it REALLY IS!!!) if only the marketing was done on the right way and people didn’t have so much stupid ideas on their heads!

Or add jonny depp as a villian or something, his movies which are mostly bad still do well for some reason. John Carter was an awesome movie, it really left me an awe. It had all the right elements, it was funny, action packed, good mix of drama, and epic! I hope for a sequel, i never heard of the book series before the movie and now i will check them out.

But because good storytelling is important. Creating magic. Giving people dreams and wild adventures. Isn’t that what Disney once was? You could be that again.

It is all too obvious that someone at Disney fell asleep at the wheel here. There are 11 books here to open the door to numerous sequels. I am really heart broken that the first movie well may be the last also. It is so sad that much of what made the books so good was left out of the movie. John Carter was the best swordsman on two planets and that was downplayed in the movie except for the one scene where he obliterates so many Tharks. His famous line “”While I live, I hope!”” was nowhere to be found. The action in this movie could have been much like “”Alien”” with traps and surprises galore.

I’d love to see “”John Carter”” become a franchise. Or at the very least, a trilogy. I mean, come on, there are EIGHT books featuring John Carter, and even more Barsoom books than that. Star Wars has MORE than 6 movies now. I’d love for John Carter to get the same. Hell, they could pull a James Bond, and just keep making movies set in that world. Make a long-lasting franchise. Hell, I’d love to see a “”Pirates of Venus”” series take off. 11 Barsoom books, and 5 Venus books. That’s a lot to pull from. Hell, call Venus Cosoom, and I’d be totally happy with a new story featuring a cross-over! This movie could be a one-time marketing and budgeting disaster or a lucrative franchise. It’s all about playing your cards right. AVATAR had a smaller budget than this film. I see sequels to this movie easily getting made for far less than either movie. Pirates of the Caribbean got made for 140 million, and On Stranger Tides got made for 150-250 million.

Now, where’s my DVD??”\n\nRob Reed,Davison,MI,48423,United States,2012-04-16,”This is officially my all-time favorite film. I know it doesn’t align perfectly with the book, but it embraces the spirit of the book and the imagery and characters are amazing. It certainly added more than it took away. I want to see Tars and Woola again. And SPOILERS: I want to see John and Tars fight those crazy sounding plantmen and banths. I want to travel to the sea inside Barsoom, before Cameron steals it for Avatar 2. I want John to meet his son. And another thing. The critics can suck it, they wouldn’t know a great film if it hit them upside the head. DONT LISTEN TO CRITICS! And Disney should be ashamed of themselves for their marketing and treatment of this fine film. The studio head should be fired, unless he wisely greenlights a sequel. Then he’s a genius.”\n\nRogerio Prado Mendonca,Sao Paulo,,08330240,Brazil,2012-04-16,I loved the movie.\n\nPierina Short,”Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire”,,EN8 8BD,United Kingdom,2012-04-16,”Simply because, John Carter deserves a sequel!!, and I deeply appreciate this film, and would love to see more.”\n\nBrenna Ring,San Diego,CA,92115,United States,2012-04-16,The only other movie to have touched my heart as much as the John Carter of Mars movie is Lord of the Rings. Lord of the Rings was a megaseller and this one deserves to be too. My family and I have seen John Carter of Mars once a week and we still leave the theater with a smile on our face. We enjoy it just as much now as when it first opened. See the movie again and again.

(That and to see Gods of Mars and Warlord.)\n\narie auble,Lexington,KY,40504,United States,2012-04-17,”This film was simply spectacular, and captured my imagination. I think the slow start was due to poor marketing, not the film itself. I strongly believe that sequels will be a success if made, and predict this film will gross a profit after the blu ray and dvd sales. I know I’ll be picking up a 3d copy day one. I hope the series continues as I would love to see more stories in this captivating world.”\n\nBrittany Schmitt,Cheterfield,VA,23832,United States,2012-04-17,”I loved this movie and the story is great. It let me escape within the wonders of another world. It had such good, honest themes of genuine heroism, self-sacrifice, and trying to find the heart to heal and fight again for something good. I love the fact that the story is one hundred years old but still made it to the screen. I want to see more of the books come to life, and will be very disappointed if I don’t get the chance to. ”\n\nAddie Abrahms,Granada Hills,CA,91344,United States,2012-04-18,I loved John Carter.

It was exactly the type of film Disney needed to break its “”kiddie”” image. The plot was engaging. The actors were well cast in their roles. The villains were typical Disney villains! Action, romance, humor, what more could you ask for? The presentation of Barsoom/Mars left me wanting much, much more! Who dropped the ball at Disney and why do they still have a job is what I want to know! As Tars Tarkas exclaims in the film, “”Who is to blame!?!?!?”” Why was the marketing campaign virtually non-existent? Why didn’t the posters mention the fact that this man was on Mars? Where are the toys? The film deserves a sequel. Perhaps even many sequels. Revamp your publicity & marketing strategy and build on your John Carter brand with sequels as entertaining as this film-if not more so.”\n\nLen Prescott,Edmonton,,T5T0X4,Canada,2012-04-18,Lets return to Barsoom and continue the fantastic journey of John Carter and friends.\n\nLaura Figueroa,”Mexicali, B.C.”,,21038,Mexico,2012-04-18,I want the sequels.

My personal anticipation of the movie’s release was equal to that of the Lord of the Rings trilogy: hope that is would be worthy of the books, fearful that it would try to rewrite a sacred tome. The screenwriters and director Stanton did a masterful job in balancing these with an excellent movie. Though the marketing was less than adequate, the international response has been excellent by all reports. The source material is strong, with not only two more books in the John Carter/Dejah Thoris story arc, but many more behind that.

Star Wars did this. Robots, lightsabers, side buns, and awesome helmets only complimented an age-old tale of friendship and hope overcoming a great evil. John Carter has also done this. Four-armed green martians, ships that ride on solar rays, exotic princesses with actual brains and brawn, and CGI so seemless from the actual actors created a whole world that everyone though they knew so much about. Mars, the red planet, given a past, a civilization spanning millenia. Showing how easily a majestic and powerful planet can turn to ashes and dust from its own overconsumption. The plant life: non-existent. The people: falling to war and strife. Did no one notice the parallels of Zodanga to some parts of Earth? A congested city using nature-oppressive fuels to maintain an unstable economy. Oh, I think the John Carter movie has a lot to tell people. And then, a hero. A man, who has lost everything, given a second chance on a new world. That is the apex of this movie…a new world where anything is possible. Everyone wants to go back to Pandora. Why not Barsoom? I….want to be taken back to Barsoom. ~John Carter for Jeddak of Mars 2012″\n\nJohn Couch,Bakersfield,CA,93309,United States,2012-04-30,”I loved the film John Carter.

While it’s far from perfect, it’s one of the things that Walt Disney would be very proud of. This is the greatest Disney movie they’ve made since Tangled, and Andrew Stanton did an amazing, marvelous job at directing his first live action feature. This is one of the few live action Disney epics which has a great story, unforgettable characters, and the Disney magic, along with the Pirates of the Caribbean movies and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

Everyone who is a sci fi fan appreciates the fathers of Sci Fi. If more people had known this movie was based on the works of a Victorian Sci Fi writer, more people would have seen it.

A blend of Star Wars and Avatar. Please make part 2 and have merchandise as well. I have John Carter pre-ordered on Amazon so I can watch it again\n\nMichelle Rippy,Rock Hill,SC,29730,United States,2012-05-11,The movie was completely awesome. I think a success far beyond what the $$ it brought in showed. It’s problem was that it wasn’t a recent book and not many people understood it. but it definitely deserves a squeal.\n\nMarcello Gentili,Genzano di Roma,,00054,Italy,2012-05-12,”The film and the story are awesome, they deserve a sequel!”\n\njimmy devereux,shanks,WV,26761,United States,2012-05-12,”i loved the books when i was little, it was great to see the movie stay on target”\n\nJohnny Lowery,Ozark,AL,36360,United States,2012-05-12,A very good movie deserves a sequel. Also the book has been out 100 years. Time for some press!!\n\nSean Wohlken,Oakland,CA,94612,United States,2012-05-12,”I never read the books or even heard about them, but the movie was AMAZING! I hold this movie in the same regard as I hold Avatar. I need a sequel! I actually care about the characters. I need to know what’s going to happen to them. Please take me back to Barsoom!”\n\nSteve Willbanks,Mesa,AZ,85202,United States,2012-05-13,”As a long-term (decades) fan of the characters and books, I found this film to be an absolutely wonderful adaptation. In an era when it’s easy to find disappointment with many films, this one stood out as the exact opposite; exceeding our expectations. Please don’t let poor marketing and ill-informed ‘buzz’ destroy what could be an otherwise successful series. My family agreed enough to see it twice, to want to buy it on Blue Ray, when it’s released, and to certainly go see any sequels that are produced (and there are 8 of us).”\n\nIan Hazlett,Plano,TX,75023,United States,2012-05-13,”John Carter is a great action-adventure movie with interesting characters you can actually care about. That doesnâ€™t happen very often at the movies. JC was made with sequels in mind so everyone can enjoy ERBâ€™s classic stories brought to life on the big screen. I paid to see JC multiple times at the theatre and Iâ€™ll buy it on Blu-Ray, so get us back to Barsoom so we can see the rest of this story in JC 2 and 3! I see a lot of fans here willing to pay to see sequels despite the fact that Disney all but abandoned this movie before it ever hit theatres.”\n\nMiles Kitts,Brisbane,,4035,Australia,2012-05-14,Awesome movie that should be followed up by sequels!\n\nMark Lipka,Quarryville,PA,17566,United States,2012-05-14,”John carter is such a lovingly crafted, sincerely emotional, action-packed, and FUN movie. It’s a rare gem! What a shame if it ends now!”\n\nEdgar Cossy,ParanÃ¡,,3100,Argentina,2012-05-15,”Because John Carter is one of the best action movies in many years. I love it, my wife loves it, and so anyone whom I talked to about it. It’s an action movie with heart and soul, something pretty odd lately.”\n\nRev. Laurel Phoenix, CHt”,Roswell,GA,30077,United States,2012-05-15,”My kids and I all enjoyed John Carter immensely, and it didn’t do as well because there was absolutely NO advertisement about it until a week before it was released. As a James Purefoy fan, and a tremendous fan of all 12 Barsoom books, I was very much anticipating the movie, and it was every bit as good as I knew it would be. Had you advertised it as you did any one of your big budget Pixar movies, there was no way it wouldn’t have been seen. I saw n’er a review or preview for it ever and you should all be ashamed of yourselves for your failure to advertise this movie properly. My children and I can’t wait to buy the DVD so we can enjoy it again and again, and if you fail to make another John Carter movie, you are doing everyone a huge disservice and my esteem for Disney will drop to the pits. This is a nice, clean, exciting sci-fi series which my 8 yr. old son & 11 and 20 yr. old daughters all enjoyed as much as I did as a kid… and still do as an adult. Out of 12 books, there is no reason, had you advertised this appropriately, you shouldn’t make several sequels from the original. Bring us back to Barsoom with John Carter, Kantos Kan & Woola!”\n\nAdam Gray,Marseille,,13000,France,2012-05-16,”I was hoping for a John Carter movie, and I would love a trilogy, since my childhood. The first movie is GREAT, with great actors and for me it’s as awesome as Star Wars in 1977. A sequel would be fantastic, but it needs a better publicity I think, and better posters in the street. Please, bring us back to Barsoom… Please… Best wishes from France.”\n\nThomas Atkinson,Linthicum,MD,21090,United States,2012-05-16,”I have been a fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs’ Barsoom for many secades. “”John Carter was a fine movie that did not deserve its shoddy marketing. It could and should have been a big summer blockbuster! Let it have its sequels — and promote them better! ”\n\nStephen Irving,Melbourne,,3194,Australia,2012-05-17,”Loved the film, great work by Stanton & his whole team, dserves another shot on Barsoom”\n\nThomas Heasman,worthing,,BN12 6DF ,United Kingdom,2012-05-18,John carter was a simply spectacular film and was left with a cliff hanger ending\n\nJohan Berghmans,Maastricht,,6217 CR,Netherlands,2012-05-18,”This is one of the greatest movies I’ve ever seen. Many critics compared it to being a copy of other “”older”” movies, forgetting the fact that its story is much older. And that many science fiction books, stories, moves in the 20th en 21st century have their roots in Burrough’s novels. I’d be thrilled if the planned sequels would still be produced.”\n\nCailey Marshall,Central Point,OR,97502,United States,2012-05-18,”I’m a fan of the books, and I think that many people enjoyed John Carter and would if they gave i"
