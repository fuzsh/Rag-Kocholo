        "text": "Popular jazz band that came to fame in the Weimar Republic thanks to its wide-ranging repertoire. Seven band members, six of whom were of Jewish origin, emigrated from Germany in 1933. A long tour of Europe, Russia, and the Far East brought them to Australia in 1937. In spite of opposition from the Australian musicians’ union, the band was a great success there. Australia’s entering into the war put an end to the ensemble’s career as they were identified with the enemy due to their country of origin."
