        "text": "Cabaret Girls: Trude Hesterberg\n\nTrude Hesterberg was a German singer and actress born in 1892. At a young age, she was introduced to singing by her aunt, who performed opera. Trude quickly fell in love with the art, but her father disproved and would not support her financially. Against his wishes, she pursued a music education in 1911, supporting herself by selling strawberries and eggs. While in school, she developed an interest in acting and began to perform both on stage and in silent film.\n\nOver the next decade, she performed all over Berlin, and in 1921 she opened her own cabaret called the “Wilde Bühne,” or Wild Stage. This proved a costly and exhausting endeavor, and the cabaret closed after only two years. Tired and broke, she resumed performing, and could often be seen at the Kakedo Bar and Barbarina Cabaret, the Großes Schauspielhaus, and in numerous films.\n\nThe 1930s brought with it a tense political climate, and in January of 1933, Trude joined the Nazi movement, saying, “As a woman and an artist I naturally have been influenced by all tendencies of the times, but I never became a politician. I have always instinctively considered my art as a megaphone of the popular opinions of the day. Out of this sense of artistic duty, I became a member of the Nazi party and the Fighting League.”\n\nLate that same year, she opened a cabaret friendly to the politics of Nazism, but it closed after only two performances, and she returned to the Kakedo."
