        "text": "In his early career Walter Mehring held contacts with the Dada movement in Berlin and published articles in literary magazines. He was among the founders of political literary cabaret in Berlin during the twenties. He wrote for Max Reinhardt, Rosa Valetti and Trude Hesterberg.\n\nFrom 1921 until 1928 he lived in Paris where he worked as a correspondent. There he translated old song from the time of the Commune and he wrote the novel \"Paris in Brand\" (1927).\n\nHis play \"Der Kaufmann von Berlin\" (1929) caused a scandal and Goebbels himself wrote an article against him in \"Der Angriff\". In 1933 many of his books were burnt. He fled to France before he could be arrested, but in 1939 he was imprisoned in that country. In 1941 he fled to the USA. After the war he returned and lived quietly in Tessin, Munich and Zürich, where he died in 1981.\n\nRelated persons\n\n cooperated with Grosz, George\n\n knew Hollaender, Felix\n\n was a friend of Pauli-Basch, Hertha\n\nEvents"
