        "text": "German character actress, singer and cabaret performer. In films and on stage in Berlin from 1912. Set up her own cabaret 'Wilde Bühne' (Wild Stage) in 1921, at one time featuring the young Berthold Brecht. In the late 1920's, appeared in revues by Erik Charrell and was briefly considered for the Dietrich role of Lola in \"Der blaue Engel\". In January 1933, she became a member of the Nazi Party and \"The Fighting League For German Culture\", ostensibly out of 'a sense of artistic duty'. She was consequently able to continue performing throughout the NS period, primarily at the Kabarett der Komiker (Kadeko) in Berlin.\n\nA very special and important role for which she was meant for she didn't get. The writer Heinrich Mann insisted that she should play the leading role in his movie \"Der blaue Engel\", but the part was finally impersonated by Marlene Dietrich."
