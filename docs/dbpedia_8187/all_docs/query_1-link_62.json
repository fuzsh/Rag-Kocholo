The remaining cases were diagnosed as having acute respiratory viral infections, tropical and parasitic diseases, viral hepatitis, or influenza. Early diagnosis of malaria was made in 60% of cases (77% in 1998). Three cases of imported tertian malaria were recorded in the Tashkent Region in the first quarter of 2000. They were imported from Tajikistan into rural areas and the patients had been infected during the 1999 season. Epidemiological surveillance of malaria in Uzbekistan is regularly carried out by the general network of health facilities and by the departments of parasitology of state epidemiological surveillance centers in collaboration with medical administrative departments, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, the L.M. Isayev Research Institute of Medical Parasitology, and other agencies. Active links are maintained with WHO under the Roll Back Malaria programme. Great emphasis is laid on medical staff training at all levels. During the 1999 epidemiological survey, 672,536 laboratory tests were performed on blood samples from suspected malaria patients and individuals who had visited malaria-endemic countries, 55% of them suffering from fever. A total area of 17 million m2 of dwelling and nondwelling buildings 20 ha of water areas were treated against mosquitoes and the larvivorous fish Gambusia was put into the water areas occupying 6,500 ha. In all cases of malaria, the focus of infection was epidemiologically surveyed and required epidemic preventive measures were implemented. All malaria patients received a full course of radical therapy and recovered completely. The epidemiological surveillance system for malaria is affected by staff shortages at the parasitology departments of state epidemiological surveillance centers and by shortages of microscopes, reagents, sterilizing equipment, insecticides, etc. There are still difficulties in obtaining supplies of primaquine although a small stock is locally available as due to WHO humanitarian\n\nJizzax Province, Uzbekistan\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2011-01-10\n\nThis image captured by NASA Terra spacecraft is of the Jizzax Province in eastern Uzbekistan, one of the main agricultural regions of the country.

In an attempt to bridge the \"definition swamp\" of these infections and serve the needs of different users, we improved the monitoring of nosocomial infections (MONI) software to create better surveillance reports according to consented national and international definitions, as well as produce infection overviews on complex clinical matters including alerts for the clinician's ward and bedside work. MONI contains and processes surveillance definitions for intensive-care-unit-acquired infections from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Sweden, as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA. The latest release of MONI also includes KISS criteria of the German National Reference Center for Surveillance of Nosocomial Infections. In addition to these \"classic\" surveillance criteria, clinical alert criteria--which are similar but not identical to the surveillance criteria--were established together with intensivists. This is an important step to support both infection control and clinical personnel; and--last but not least--to foster co-evolution of the two groups of definitions: surveillance and alerts.\n\nUzbekistan Country Analysis Brief\n\nEIA Publications\n\n2016-01-01\n\nTotal primary energy consumption in Uzbekistan was about 2.05 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) in 2015, according to BP's 2016 Statistical Review. Natural gas accounted for the majority of consumption (88%), while consumption of petroleum products (5%), coal (2%), and hydroelectricity (5%) accounted for the remainder. Uzbekistan holds sizeable hydrocarbon reserves of natural gas, and its economy is highly dependent on the countryâs energy resources.\n\nInfection levels of protostrongylid nematodes in definitive caprine and intermediate gastropod hosts from Uzbekistan.\n\nPubMed\n\nKuchboev, A E; KrÃ¼cken, J; Karimova, R R; Ruziev, B H; Pazilov, A\n\n2017-03-01\n\nMorphological analysis of lungworms collected among Caprinae from Uzbekistan resulted in the identification of four species of Protostrongylidae: Protostrongylus rufescens, Protostrongylus hobmaieri, Spiculocaulus leuckarti and Cystocaulus ocreatus. The following species were recorded as definitive hosts: Ovis aries, Ovis ammon, Ovis vignei, Capra hircus, Capra falconeri and Capra sibirica. The prevalence of P. rufescens reached 45.3%, followed by S. leuckarti and C. ocreatus with 31.7% and P. hobmaieri with 16.9%. The sex ratio ranged between 1:3.1 and 1:6.2, with P. hobmaieri showing the strongest predominance of females over males. The prevalence of infection of small ruminants with protostrongylid nematodes increased with the age of the hosts. Protostrongyles use terrestrial gastropods as intermediate hosts, and infective larvae were found in the species Vallonia costata, Gibbulinopsis signata, Pupilla muscorum, Pseudonapaeus albiplicata, Pseudonapaeus sogdiana, Leucozonella ferghanica, Xeropicta candacharica, Candaharia levanderi and Macrochlamys sogdiana. Xeropicta candacharica was the most abundant gastropod and had the highest prevalence of infection with protostrongylids. Adult X. candacharica had a significantly higher infection intensity than juveniles. The epidemiology of protostrongylid infections is dynamic and subject to considerable changes. Further characterization of the interaction of protostrongylid parasites with their terrestrial gastropods as intermediate hosts and Caprinae as definitive hosts is required to understand these processes and to monitor the effects of changing ecological contexts.\n\nDoD Global Emerging Infections Surveillance & Response System (DoD-GEIS).

However, little is known about the cost-effectiveness of these tools. We focus on 2 types of economic analyses that have utility in assessing infection control interventions (cost-effectiveness analysis and business-case analysis) and review the available literature on the economics of computerized infection control surveillance systems. Previous studies on the effectiveness of computerized infection control surveillance have been limited to assessments of whether these tools increase the sensitivity and specificity of surveillance over traditional methods. Furthermore, we identified only 2 studies that assessed the costs associated with computerized infection control surveillance. Thus, it remains unknown whether computerized infection control surveillance systems are cost-effective and whether use of these systems improves patient outcomes. The existing data are insufficient to allow for a summary conclusion on the cost-effectiveness of infection control surveillance technology. All future studies of computerized infection control surveillance systems should aim to collect outcomes and economic data to inform decision making and assist hospitals with completing business-cases analyses.\n\nSurveillance for human Salmonella infections in the United States.\n\nPubMed\n\nSwaminathan, Bala; Barrett, Timothy J; Fields, Patricia\n\n2006-01-01\n\nSurveillance for human Salmonella infections plays a critical role in understanding and controlling foodborne illness due to Salmonella. Along with its public health partners, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has several surveillance systems that collect information on Salmonella infections in the United States. The National Salmonella Surveillance System, begun in 1962, receives reports of laboratory-confirmed Salmonella infections through state public health laboratories. Salmonella outbreaks are reported by state and local health departments through the Foodborne Disease Outbreak Reporting System, which became a Web-based, electronic system (eFORS) in 2001. PulseNet facilitates the detection of clusters of Salmonella infections through standardized molecular subtyping (DNA \"fingerprinting\") of isolates and maintenance of \"fingerprint\" databases. The National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System for Enteric Bacteria (NARMS) monitors antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella by susceptibility testing of every 20th Salmonella isolate received by state and local public health laboratories. FootNet is an active surveillance system that monitors Salmonella infections in sentinel areas, providing population-based estimates of infection rates. Efforts are underway to electronically link all of the Salmonella surveillance systems at CDC to facilitate optimum use of available data and minimize duplication.\n\nNATIONAL NOSOCOMIAL INFECTIONS SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM (NNIS)\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nThe National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) System is a cooperative effort that began in 1970 between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and participating hospitals to create a national nosocomial infections database.

Australia does not have a comprehensive national HAI surveillance program. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of established international and Australian statewide HAI surveillance programs and recommend a pathway for the development of a national HAI surveillance program in Australia. This study examined existing HAI surveillance programs through a literature review, a review of HAI surveillance program documentation, such as websites, surveillance manuals and data reports and direct contact with program representatives. Evidence from international programs demonstrates national HAI surveillance reduces the incidence of HAIs. However, the current status of HAI surveillance activity in Australian states is disparate, variation between programs is not well understood, and the quality of data currently used to compose national HAI rates is uncertain. There is a need to develop a well-structured, evidence-based national HAI program in Australia to meet the increasing demand for validated reliable national HAI data. Such a program could be leveraged off the work of existing Australian and international programs.\n\nEpidemiology and risk factors for endemic typhoid fever in Uzbekistan.\n\nPubMed\n\nSrikantiah, Padmini; Vafokulov, Sagdullo; Luby, Stephen P; Ishmail, Tharwat; Earhart, Kenneth; Khodjaev, Ne'mat; Jennings, Gregory; Crump, John A; Mahoney, Frank J\n\n2007-07-01\n\nTo investigate the risk factors for infection with endemic typhoid fever in the Samarkand region of Uzbekistan. Case-control study of culture-confirmed bloodstream infection with Salmonella Typhi. Patients were compared to age-matched community controls. Salmonella Typhi isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. We enrolled 97 patients and 192 controls. The median age of patients was 19 years. In a conditional regression model, consumption of unboiled surface water outside the home [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=3.0, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.1-8.2], use of antimicrobials in the 2 weeks preceding onset of symptoms (aOR=12.2, 95% CI 4.0-37.0), and being a student (aOR=4.0, 95% CI 1.4-11.3) were independently associated with typhoid fever. Routinely washing vegetables (aOR 0.06, 95% CI 0.02-0.2) and dining at a tea-house (aOR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-1.0) were associated with protection against illness. Salmonella Typhi resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was identified in 6 (15%) of 41 isolates tested. Endemic typhoid fever in Uzbekistan is transmitted by contaminated water. Recent use of antimicrobials also increased risk of infection. Targeted efforts at improving drinking water quality, especially for students and young adults, are likely to decrease transmission of typhoid fever. Measures to decrease the unnecessary use of antimicrobials would be expected to reduce the risk of typhoid fever and decrease the spread of multiple drug-resistant Salmonella Typhi.\n\nElectronic surveillance and using administrative data to identify healthcare associated infections.\n\nPubMed\n\nGastmeier, Petra; Behnke, Michael\n\n2016-08-01\n\nTraditional surveillance of healthcare associated infections (HCAI) is time consuming and error-prone. We have analysed literature of the past year to look at new developments in this field. It is divided into three parts: new algorithms for electronic surveillance, the use of administrative data for surveillance of HCAI, and the definition of new endpoints of surveillance, in accordance with an automatic surveillance approach. Most studies investigating electronic surveillance of HCAI have concentrated on bloodstream infection or surgical site infection. However, the lack of important parameters in hospital databases can lead to misleading results. The accuracy of administrative coding data was poor at identifying HCAI. New endpoints should be defined for automatic detection, with the most crucial step being to win clinicians' acceptance. Electronic surveillance with conventional endpoints is a successful method when hospital information systems implemented key changes and enhancements. One requirement is the access to systems for hospital administration and clinical databases.Although the primary source of data for HCAI surveillance is not administrative coding data, these are important components of a hospital-wide programme of automated surveillance. The implementation of new endpoints for surveillance is an approach which needs to be discussed further.\n\nRevised surveillance case definition for HIV infection--United States, 2014.\n\nPubMed\n\n2014-04-11\n\nFollowing extensive consultation and peer review, CDC and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists have revised and combined the surveillance case definitions for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection into a single case definition for persons of all ages (i.e., adults and adolescents aged â¥13 years and children aged <13 years). The revisions were made to address multiple issues, the most important of which was the need to adapt to recent changes in diagnostic criteria. Laboratory criteria for defining a confirmed case now accommodate new multitest algorithms, including criteria for differentiating between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection and for recognizing early HIV infection. A confirmed case can be classified in one of five HIV infection stages (0, 1, 2, 3, or unknown); early infection, recognized by a negative HIV test within 6 months of HIV diagnosis, is classified as stage 0, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is classified as stage 3. Criteria for stage 3 have been simplified by eliminating the need to differentiate between definitive and presumptive diagnoses of opportunistic illnesses. Clinical (nonlaboratory) criteria for defining a case for surveillance purposes have been made more practical by eliminating the requirement for information about laboratory tests. The surveillance case definition is intended primarily for monitoring the HIV infection burden and planning for prevention and care on a population level, not as a basis for clinical decisions for individual patients. CDC and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists recommend that all states and territories conduct case surveillance of HIV infection using this revised surveillance case definition.\n\nEquipment and skills shortage in Uzbekistan.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhodjibaev, Abdukhakim M; Anvarov, Khikmat; Borisova, Elena; Schmitt, Roger; Murotova, Nigora\n\n2014-05-01\n\nIn this article, supplied with the help of the International Federation of Hospital Engineering (IFHE), five co-authors from the Deutsche Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ)--a German organisation that seeks to encourage and co-ordinate international cooperation in areas ranging from sustainable development to fund management, and its partner organisation, IFHE member, the Republican Research Center of Emergency Medicine (RRCEM) in Uzbekistan, discuss the use of medical technology in the central Asian country.

Although these systems provide comparatively robust surveillance data, they do not provide sufficient information on risk factors to target STI control and prevention programmes appropriately. Over recent years, substantial rises in STIs, the emergence of numerous outbreaks of STIs, and changes in gonococcal resistance patterns have necessitated the introduction of more sophisticated surveillance mechanisms. This article describes current STI surveillance systems in England and Wales, including new systems that have recently been introduced or are currently being developed to meet the need for enhanced STI surveillance data.\n\nAttitudes of Major Soviet Nationalities.

Scott; Abouzelof, Rouett H.; Taylor, Caroline W.; Anderson, Vickie; Sumner, Sharon; Soutter, Sharon; Kleckner, Ruth; Lloyd, James F.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nHospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are a significant cause of patient harm and increased healthcare cost. Many states have instituted mandatory hospital-wide reporting of HAIs which will increase the workload of infection preventionists and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services is no longer paying hospitals to treat certain HAIs. These competing priorities for increased reporting and prevention have many hospitals worried. Manual surveillance of HAIs cannot provide the speed, accuracy and consistency of computerized surveillance. Computer tools can also improve the speed and accuracy of HAI analysis and reporting. Computerized surveillance for HAIs was implemented at LDS Hospital in 1984, but that system required manual entry of data for analysis and reporting. This paper reports on the current functionality and status of the updated computer system for HAI surveillance, analysis and reporting used at LDS Hospital and the 21 other Intermountain Healthcare hospitals.

By March 1999, the outbreak had spread to other pig-farming areas of the country, inclusive of the neighbouring country, Singapore. A total of 283 human cases of viral encephalitis with 109 deaths were recorded in Malaysia from 29 September 1998 to December 1999. During the outbreak period, a number of surveillances under three broad groups; Surveillance in Human Health Sector, Surveillance in Animal Health Sector, and Surveillance for the Reservoir Hosts, were carried out to determine the prevalence, risk of virus infections and transmission in human and swine populations as well as the source and reservoir hosts of Nipah virus. Surveillance data showed that the virus spread rapidly among pigs within infected farms and transmission was attributed to direct contact with infective excretions and secretions. The spread of the virus among pig farms within and between states of peninsular Malaysia was due to movement of pigs. The transmission of the virus to humans was through close contact with infected pigs. Human to human transmission was considered a rare event though the Nipah virus could be isolated from saliva, urine, nasal and pharyngeal secretions of patients. Field investigations identified fruitbats of the Pteropid species as the natural reservoir hosts of the viruses. The outbreak was effectively brought under control following the discovery of the virus and institution of correct control measures through a combined effort of multi-ministerial and multidisciplinary teams working in close co-operation and collaboration with other international agencies.\n\nFive-year decreased incidence of surgical site infections following gastrectomy and prosthetic joint replacement surgery through active surveillance by the Korean Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System.\n\nPubMed\n\nChoi, H J; Adiyani, L; Sung, J; Choi, J Y; Kim, H B; Kim, Y K; Kwak, Y G; Yoo, H; Lee, Sang-Oh; Han, S H; Kim, S R; Kim, T H; Lee, H M; Chun, H K; Kim, J-S; Yoo, J D; Koo, H-S; Cho, E H; Lee, K W\n\n2016-08-01\n\nSurveillance of healthcare-associated infection has been associated with a reduction in surgical site infection (SSI). To evaluate the Korean Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System (KONIS) in order to assess its effects on SSI since it was introduced. SSI data after gastrectomy, total hip arthroplasty (THA), and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) between 2008 and 2012 were analysed. The pooled incidence of SSI was calculated for each year; the same analyses were also conducted from hospitals that had participated in KONIS for at least three consecutive years. Standardized SSI rates for each year were calculated by adjusting for SSI risk factors. SSI trends were analysed using the Cochran-Armitage test. The SSI rate following gastrectomy was 3.12% (522/16,918). There was a significant trend of decreased crude SSI rates over five years. This trend was also evident in analysis of hospitals that had participated for more than three years. The SSI rate for THA was 2.05% (157/7656), which decreased significantly from 2008 to 2012. The risk factors for SSI after THA included the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance risk index, trauma, reoperation, and age (60-69 years). The SSI rate for TKA was 1.90% (152/7648), which also decreased significantly during a period of five years. However, the risk-adjusted analysis of SSI did not show a significant decrease for all surgical procedures. The SSI incidence of gastrectomy and prosthetic joint replacement declined over five years as a result of active surveillance by KONIS. Copyright Â© 2016 The Healthcare Infection Society.

The implementation of effective CDI surveillance is key to enable monitoring of the occurrence and spread of C.Â difficile in healthcare and the timely detection of outbreaks. The aim of this review is to provide a summary of key components of effective CDI surveillance and to provide some practical recommendations. We also summarize the recent and current national CDI surveillance activities, to illustrate strengths and weaknesses of CDI surveillance in Europe. For the definition of key components of CDI surveillance, we consulted the current European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) CDI-related guidance documents and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) protocol for CDI surveillance in acute care hospitals. To summarize the recent and current national CDI surveillance activities, we discussed international multicentre CDI surveillance studies performed in 2005-13. In 2017, we also performed a new survey of existing CDI surveillance systems in 33 European countries. Key components for CDI surveillance are appropriate case definitions of CDI, standardized CDI diagnostics, agreement on CDI case origin definition, and the presentation of CDI rates with well-defined numerators and denominators. Incorporation of microbiological data is required to provide information on prevailing PCR ribotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility to first-line CDI treatment drugs. In 2017, 20 European countries had a national CDI surveillance system and 21 countries participated in ECDC-coordinated CDI surveillance. Since 2014, the number of centres with capacity for C.Â difficile typing has increased to 35 reference or central laboratories in 26 European countries. Incidence rates of CDI, obtained from a standardized CDI surveillance system, can be used as an important\n\nIncome-based projections of water footprint of food consumption in Uzbekistan\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDjanibekov, Nodir; Frohberg, Klaus; Djanibekov, Utkur\n\n2013-11-01\n\nAssessing future water requirements for feeding the growing population of Central Asia can improve understanding of the projected water supply scenarios in the region. Future water requirements will be partially determined by the dietary habits of the populations, and are thus responsive to significant variation of income levels. Using Uzbekistan as an example, this study projects the water footprints of income driven changes on the population's diet in Central Asia. To reveal the influence of large income changes on dietary habits a Normalized Quadratic-Quadratic Expenditure System was calibrated and applied to data from 2009. The national water footprints of food consumption in Uzbekistan were projected until 2034 by applying the parameterized demand system to estimate the respective water footprint values. The results showed that for Uzbekistan the projected increase in the food consumption water footprint would be primarily linked to income growth rather than population growth. Due to the high water footprint of common food products, the composition of the population's diet, and responsiveness to income, economic growth is expected to put greater pressure on water resources in Uzbekistan unless proper measures are undertaken.\n\nCountry Report: Introduction of a New Education Inclusion Reform--Republic of Uzbekistan\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nNazarova, E.

The merits of reducing the postoperative surveillance period from 1 year to 90 days have been debated. OBJECTIVES To report the first pan-Canadian hip and knee periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) rates and to describe the implications of a shorter (90-day) postoperative surveillance period. METHODS Prospective surveillance for infection following hip and knee arthroplasty was conducted by hospitals participating in the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program (CNISP) using standard surveillance definitions. RESULTS Overall hip and knee PJI rates were 1.64 and 1.52 per 100 procedures, respectively. Deep incisional and organ-space hip and knee PJI rates were 0.96 and 0.71, respectively. In total, 93% of hip PJIs and 92% of knee PJIs were identified within 90 days, with a median time to detection of 21 days. However, 11%-16% of deep incisional and organ-space infections were not detected within 90 days. This rate was reduced to 3%-4% at 180 days post procedure. Anaerobic and polymicrobial infections had the shortest median time from procedure to detection (17 and 18 days, respectively) compared with infections due to other microorganisms, including Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSIONS PJI rates were similar to those reported elsewhere, although differences in national surveillance systems limit direct comparisons. Our results suggest that a postoperative surveillance period of 90 days will detect the majority of PJIs; however, up to 16% of deep incisional and organ-space infections may be missed. Extending the surveillance period to 180 days could allow for a better estimate of disease burden.

A total of 2,547 serum samples were collected, 66 from confirmed CE patients and 2,481 of patients with other diseases than CE at a hospital in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The serum samples were screened for CE specific IgG antibodies by ELISA using cystic fluid antigen obtained from sheep. The serum antibody positive rate was 89.4% (59/66) in CE and 3.6% (89/2,481) in other disease patients. The present ELISA recognized 89.4% sensitivity and 96.4% specificity. The ELISA absorbance of positive samples was distributed 0.271-0.971 for CE and 0.273-0.887 for other disease patients. The other disease patients with high absorbance over 0.3 were 50 (2.0%) who were presumed to be active CE patients. The patients in their 40s showed the highest positive rate of 5.2% (P=0.181), and women were 4.4% while men were 3.1% positive (P=0.136). The data confirmed that there are many asymptomatic patients of CE in Tashkent. It is indicated that CE is an endemic disease of public health importance in Uzbekistan.\n\nGlobal Emerging Infection Surveillance and Response (GEIS)- Avian Influenza Pandemic Influenza (AI/PI) Program\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2008-10-01\n\nthe fact that acute respiratory infections are one of the leading causes of morbidity.

IPC activities require effective surveillance to generate data for the HAI rates, defining priority areas, identifying processes amenable for improvement and institute interventions to improve patient's safety. However, uniform, accurate and standardised surveillance methodology using objective definitions can only generate meaningful data for effective execution of IPC activities. The highly exhaustive, complex and ever-evolving infection surveillance methodology pose a challenge for effective data capture, analysis and interpretation by ground level personnel. The present review addresses the gaps in knowledge and day-to-day challenges in surveillance faced by infection control team for effective implementation of IPC activities.\n\nPostdischarge surveillance for infection following cesarean section: A prospective cohort study comparing methodologies.\n\nPubMed\n\nHalwani, Muhammad A; Turnbull, Alison E; Harris, Meredith; Witter, Frank; Perl, Trish M\n\n2016-04-01\n\nTo assess how enhanced postdischarge telephone follow-up calls would improve case finding for surgical site infection (SSI) surveillance after cesarean section. We conducted a prospective cohort study of all patients who delivered by cesarean section between April 22 and August 22, 2010. In addition to our routine surveillance, using clinical databases and electronic patient records, we also made follow-up calls to the patients at 7, 14, and 30 days postoperation. A standard questionnaire with questions about symptoms of SSI, health-seeking behaviors, and treatment received was administered. Descriptive statistics and univariate analysis were performed to assess the effect of the enhanced surveillance. One hundred ninety-three patients underwent cesarean section during this study period. Standard surveillance identified 14 infections with telephone follow-ups identifying an additional 5 infections. Using the call as a gold standard, the sensitivity of the standard methodology to capture SSI was 73.3%. The duration of the calls ranged from 1 to 5 minutes and were well received by the patients. Results suggest that follow-up telephone calls to patients following cesarean section identifies 26.3% of the total SSIs. Enhanced surveillance can provide more informed data to enhance performance and avoid underestimation of rates.

DESIGN Countrywide survey of SSI surveillance quality. SETTING 147 hospitals or hospital units with surgical activities in Switzerland. METHODS Site visits were conducted with on-site structured interviews and review of a random sample of 15 patient records per hospital: 10 from the entire data set and 5 from a subset of patients with originally reported infection. Process and structure were rated in 9 domains with a weighted overall validation score, and sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated for the identification of SSI. RESULTS Of 50 possible points, the median validation score was 35.5 (range, 16.25-48.5). Public hospitals (P<.001), hospitals in the Italian-speaking region of Switzerland (P=.021), and hospitals with longer participation in the surveillance (P=.018) had higher scores than others. Domains that contributed most to lower scores were quality of chart review and quality of data extraction. Of 49 infections, 15 (30.6%) had been overlooked in a random sample of 1,110 patient records, accounting for a sensitivity of 69.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54.6%-81.7%), a specificity of 99.9% (95% CI, 99.5%-100%), a positive predictive value of 97.1% (95% CI, 85.1%-99.9%), and a negative predictive value of 98.6% (95% CI, 97.7%-99.2%). CONCLUSIONS Irrespective of a well-defined surveillance methodology, there is a wide variation of SSI surveillance quality. The quality of chart review and the accuracy of data collection are the main areas for improvement.

The methods and practices for surveillance have evolved as technology becomes more advanced. The availability of electronic surveillance software (ESS) has increased, and yet adoption of ESS is slow. It is argued that ESS delivers savings through automation, particularly in terms of human resourcing and infection prevention (IP) staff time. To describe the findings of a systematic review on the impact of ESS on IP resources. A systematic search was conducted of electronic databases Medline and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature published between January 1 st , 2006 and December 31 st , 2016 with analysis using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. In all, 2832 articles were reviewed, of which 16 studies met the inclusion criteria. IP resources were identified as time undertaken on surveillance. A reduction in IP staff time to undertake surveillance was demonstrated in 13 studies. The reduction proportion ranged from 12.5% to 98.4% (mean: 73.9%). The remaining three did not allow for any estimation of the effect in terms of IP staff time. None of the studies demonstrated an increase in IP staff time. The results of this review demonstrate that adopting ESS yields considerable dividends in IP staff time relating to data collection and case ascertainment while maintaining high levels of sensitivity and specificity. This has the potential to enable reinvestment into other components of IP to maximize efficient use of scarce IP resources. Copyright Â© 2017 The Healthcare Infection Society.

The epidemiology of HAI was described for the surveillance components for intensive care units (ITS-KISS), non-ICUs (STATIONS-KISS), very low birth weight infants (NEO-KISS) and surgical site infections (OP-KISS) in the period from 2006 to 2013. In addition, risk factor analyses were performed for the most important infections of ICU-KISS, NEO-KISS and OP-KISS. Data from a total of 3,454,778 ICU patients from 913 ICUs, 618,816 non-ICU patients from 142 non-ICU wards, 53,676 VLBW from 241 neonatal intensive care units (NICU) and 1,005,064 surgical patients from operative departments from 550 hospitals were used for analysis. Compared with baseline data, a significant reduction of primary bloodstream infections (PBSI) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) was observed in ICUs with the maximum effect in year 5 (or longer participation) (incidence rate ratio 0.60 (CI95 0.50-0.72) and 0.61 (CI95 0.52-0.71) respectively). A significant reduction of PBSI and LRTI was also observed in NEO-KISS when comparing the baseline situation with the 5th year of participation (hazard ratio 0.70 (CI95 0.64-0.76) and 0.43 (CI95 0.35-0.52)). The effect was smaller in operative departments after the introduction of OP-KISS (OR 0.80; CI95 0.64-1.02 in year 5 or later for all procedure types combined). Due to the large database, it has not only been possible to confirm well-known risk factors for HAI, but also to identify some new interesting risk factors like seasonal and volume effects. Participating in a national surveillance system and using surveillance data for internal quality management leads to substantial reduction of HAI. In addition, a surveillance system can identify otherwise not recognized risk factors which should - if possible - be considered for infection control management and for risk\n\nGender earnings and poverty reduction: post-Communist Uzbekistan.\n\nPubMed\n\nBhat, Bilal Ahmad Bhat\n\n2011-01-01\n\nWomen get less of the material resources, social status, power and opportunities for self-actualization than men do who share their social location â be it a location based on class, race, occupation, ethnicity, religion, education, nationality, or any intersection of these factors. The process of feminization of poverty in Central Asia and Uzbekistan is intimately connected to the cultural and institutional limitations that put a ceiling on womenâs involvement in economic activity. This article attempts to study and explore gender in the context of poverty reduction in Uzbekistan, the most populated state of Central Asia, to understand the ways and manner in which poverty and other forms of deprivation demand womenâs participation in variety of contexts. The study is primarily an empirical one and is based on an extensive sociological investigation in the field.\n\n[Surgical site infections after cesarean section: results of a five-year prospective surveillance].\n\nPubMed\n\nBarbut, F; Carbonne, B; Truchot, F; Spielvogel, C; Jannet, D; Goderel, I; Lejeune, V; Milliez, J\n\n2004-10-01\n\nTo determine the incidence of surgical site infections and to identify risk factors for infections. A prospective study of surgical site infections (SSI) after cesarean section was carried out from September 1997 to September 1998 (pilot study) and from January 2000 to August 2003, using the methodology of the American National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System. Follow up of women was performed by midwives until discharge and during the post-natal visit. Suspected surgical site infections were confirmed by surgeons and infection control practitioners. The microbiological file of each patient was edited 30 days after cesarean section. Risk factors were analyzed using a logistic regression model. During the pilot study, infection rate was estimated at 3.2%. At multivariate analysis, factors independently associated with an increased risk of SSI were ASA score > 1, performance of cesarean section in a room not dedicated to this activity, and use of an open urine drainage system. During the following years (2000-2003), infection rates progressively decreased to reach 1.9% in 2003. Infections included superficial wound infections (involving skin and subcutaneous tissue) (47%), deep wound infections (involving deep and soft tissue (fascia and muscle) (20%) and organ/space infections (i.e. endometritis, pelvic abscess) (33%). Infections occurred after patient discharge in 47.5% of cases and diagnosis was based only on clinical findings in 30% of cases. Infected patients were hospitalized longer (median: 6 days) than non infected patients. Prospective surveillance of SSI led to better awareness of infectious problems among health care workers, to identification of risk factors and evaluation of health procedures. Surveillance contributed to a decrease in nosocomial infections.\n\nVibrio infections and surveillance in Maryland, 2002-2008.\n\nPubMed\n\nJones, Erin H; Feldman, Katherine A; Palmer, Amanda; Butler, Erin; Blythe, David; Mitchell, Clifford S\n\n2013-01-01\n\nVibrio is a naturally occurring waterborne pathogen with potential occupational, recreational, and commercial impacts. During the last 15 years in the U.S. and in Maryland, the incidence of vibriosis has increased. Due to the increase in cases in Maryland, warming water temperatures, and public concern about human health effects resulting from exposure to the Chesapeake Bay, we reviewed cases of vibriosis and evaluated the Vibrio surveillance system in Maryland for timeliness and data quality, attributes necessary for successful outbreak investigation and illness prevention. The evaluation included (1) informal qualitative surveys of state and local personnel who report and manage Vibrio cases and (2) a review of Vibrio surveillance data from 2002 through 2008 for data quality and timeliness of the system. From 2002 to 2008, 188 laboratory-confirmed cases of vibriosis were reported in Maryland with an annual average of 27 cases. The species of Vibrio that were most frequently responsible for infection, regardless of clinical presentation, were V. parahaemolyticus (43.6%), V. vulnificus (23.9%), V. alginolyticus (9.6%), and non-toxigenic V. cholerae (9.0%). The case fatality rate fluctuated during the study period, but the number of cases increased. The surveillance system in Maryland is flexible and captures cases of vibriosis where specimens were collected for testing; however, the system may not adequately capture mild, self-limiting infections. Better integration of data collection for clinical, laboratory, and environmental information and improved completion of variables for shellfish harvest or water exposure locations could improve the system. Quarterly meetings comprising surveillance, public health laboratory, and food-control personnel could direct and ensure the success of improvement efforts.\n\nHealth and wealth in Uzbekistan and sub-Saharan Africa in comparative perspective.\n\nPubMed\n\nHohmann, Sophie; Garenne, Michel\n\n2010-12-01\n\nThe study investigates the magnitude of differences in child and adult mortality by wealth in Uzbekistan, a former soviet country of Central Asia, and compares it with similar indicators from sub-Saharan Africa. Data were derived from Demographic and Health Surveys. An \"Absolute Wealth Index\" was built from data on goods owned by households and quality of housing, and scaled from 0 to 12. Wealth was distributed evenly in Uzbekistan, with a symmetric distribution around a mean of 5.5 modern goods. In sub-Saharan Africa, on the contrary, the wealth distribution had a lower mean (2.5) and was highly skewed towards the left, revealing a high proportion of very poor people. Adult and child mortality levels were lower in Uzbekistan. Despite these major differences, the relationships between mortality indicators and the wealth index were similar in the two cases. The magnitude of mortality differentials by wealth was of the same order in both cases, with gradients ranging from 2.5 to 1 for child mortality and 1.5 to 1 for adult mortality (poorest versus richest). However, mortality levels remained lower in Uzbekistan than in sub-Saharan Africa at the same level of wealth for both children and adults. A similar relationship was found between nutritional status and wealth index in both cases. On the contrary, there were no differences by wealth in use of health services and level of education in Uzbekistan, whereas wealth gradients were steep for the same variables in sub-Saharan Africa. The study suggests that mortality differentials were primarily due to nutritional status, and not to access and use of health services or to education. The discussion focuses on health and social policies during the colonial and post-colonial period that have produced these patterns. Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

One of the fundamental principles for the surveillance of SSI is based on receiving effective field feedback (retro-information). The aim of this study was to report the results of a program of SSI surveillance and validate the hypothesis that there is a correlation between creating a SSI surveillance program and a reduction in SSI. The protocol was based on the weekly collection of surveillance data obtained directly from the different information systems in different departments. A delay of 3 months was established before extraction and analysis of data and information from the surgical teams. The NNIS index (National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System) developed by the American surveillance system and the reduction of length of hospital stay index JournÃ©es d'hospitalisation Ã©vitÃ©es (JHE). Since the end of 2009, 7156 surgical procedures were evaluated (rate of inclusion 97.3%), and 84 SSI were registered with a significant decrease over time from 1.86% to 0.66%. A total of 418 days of hospitalization have been saved since the beginning of the surveillance system. Our surveillance system has three strong points: follow-up is continuous, specifically adapted to orthopedic traumatology and nearly exhaustive. The extraction of data directly from hospital information systems effectively improves the collection of data on surgical procedures. The implementation of a SSI surveillance protocol reduces SSI.

We developed Clean Cut, a surgical infection prevention program, with two goals: (1) Increase adherence to evidence-based peri-operative infection prevention standards and (2) establish sustainable surgical infection surveillance. Here we describe our infection surveillance strategy. Clean Cut was piloted and evaluated at a 523 bed tertiary hospital in Ethiopia. Infection prevention standards included: (1) Hand and surgical site decontamination; (2) integrity of gowns, drapes, and gloves; (3) instrument sterility; (4) prophylactic antibiotic administration; (5) surgical gauze tracking; and (6) checklist compliance. Primary outcome measure was SSI, with secondary outcomes including other infection, re-operation, and length of stay. We prospectively observed all post-surgical wounds in obstetrics over a 12 day period and separately recorded post-operative complications using chart review. Simultaneously, we reviewed the written hospital charts after patient discharge for all patients whose peri-operative adherence to infection prevention standards was captured. Fifty obstetric patients were followed prospectively with recorded rates of SSI 14%, re-operation 6%, and death 2%. Compared with direct observation, chart review alone had a high loss to follow-up (28%) and decreased capture of infectious complications (SSI [nâ=â2], endometritis [nâ=â3], re-operations [nâ=â2], death [nâ=â1]); further, documentation inconsistencies failed to capture two complications (SSI [nâ=â1], mastitis [nâ=â1]). Concurrently, 137 patients were observed for peri-operative infection prevention standard adherence. Of these, we were able to successfully review 95 (69%) patient charts with recorded rates of SSI 5%, re-operation 1%, and death 1%. Patient loss to follow-up and poor documentation of infections underestimated overall infectious complications.

In order to improve the security and quality of care, six haemodialysis centers have organized an infection watching network. The purpose of the network is to compare of the watching results between centers. This comparison includes vascular access infection (VAI), bacteraemia and C viral hepatitis. The heterogeneous pattern has been also taken into account. SURVEY TYPE: Multicenter prospective permanent survey. Six hundred and sixty-four haemodialyzed chronic patients, followed during one year (2005), in six voluntary haemodialysis centers. This survey has based on 71,688 treatment sessions corresponding to 6257.5 months of haemodialysis (HM). As with the heterogeneity among centers, the acquired infection standardized ratios (observed/expected) (AISR) and 95% confidence interval are computed with Cox model which includes confounding factors found in literature or in the preliminary stage of the survey. VAI crude rate was 0.47 per 100HM, 0.10 per 1000 native fistulae utilisation days, 0.45 per 1000 days of prosthetic graft utilisation and 0.44 per 1000 days of catheter utilisation. Bacteraemia crude incidence rate was 0.69 per 100HM, 0.02 per 1000 days of native fistulae utilisation, 0.00 per 1000 days of prosthetic graft utilisation and 0.39 per 1000 days of catheter utilisation. No new case of C viral hepatitis was found. Prevalence rate at the beginning of the survey was 5.3% (35 over 664). Two centers had a significantly high AISR for VAI and two centers had a significantly low AISR for VAI. One center had a significantly high AISR for bacteraemia and one center had a significantly low AISR for bacteraemia. The first year of Dialin running demonstrates the importance of standardised surveillance method in VAI and bacteraemia surveillance but not for viral hepatitis.\n\nValidation of intensive care unit-acquired infection surveillance in the Italian SPIN-UTI network.\n\nPubMed\n\nMasia, M D; Barchitta, M; Liperi, G; CantÃ¹, A P; Alliata, E; Auxilia, F; Torregrossa, V; Mura, I; Agodi, A\n\n2010-10-01\n\nValidity is one of the most critical factors concerning surveillance of nosocomial infections (NIs). This article describes the first validation study of the Italian Nosocomial Infections Surveillance in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) project (SPIN-UTI) surveillance data. The objective was to validate infection data and thus to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of NI data reported on patients in the ICUs participating in the SPIN-UTI network. A validation study was performed at the end of the surveillance period. All medical records including all clinical and laboratory data were reviewed retrospectively by the trained physicians of the validation team and a positive predictive value (PPV), a negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Eight ICUs (16.3%) were randomly chosen from all 49 SPIN-UTI ICUs for the validation study. In total, the validation team reviewed 832 patient charts (27.3% of the SPIN-UTI patients). The PPV was 83.5% and the NPV was 97.3%. The overall sensitivity was 82.3% and overall specificity was 97.2%. Over- and under-reporting of NIs were related to misinterpretation of the case definitions and deviations from the protocol despite previous training and instructions. The results of this study are useful to identify methodological problems within a surveillance system and have been used to plan retraining for surveillance personnel and to design and implement the second phase of the SPIN-UTI project.

From 2006 to 2010, fecal samples of the inhabitants of 3 years old and above were collected every November and examined for intestinal helminth eggs by the modified Kato s thick smear technique at the 2 surveillance sites: Punan village of Zhangzhou and Gushan village of Shaowu. Cellophane tapes were used to detect pinworm eggs for children aged 3-12. Soil samples were also collected from vegetable field, lavatory, courtyard and kitchen of 20 randomly selected families (in 2 villages) each with stool egg-positive findings and examined for ascaris eggs by a modified saturated sodium nitrate floatation method. The prevalence of soil-transmitted nematode infection at the surveillance sites decreased from 45.3% (946/2087) in 2006 to 15.1% (226/1494) in 2010, with a reduction of 66.6%. Among the infected subjects, hookworm infection occupied 75%-85%, while ascaris or trichuris infections each accounted for less than 10%. In terms of infection intensity, 65.2%-85.5% of the hookworm infection was light, and majority of the infected subjects were farmers. The pinworm prevalence in children were still high although it had dropped down from 46.1% (140/304) in 2006 to 29.8% (36/121) in 2010, declined by 35.4%. In the 5 years, totally 400 soil samples from 100 families were examined and 21 samples were found ascaris egg positive with viable eggs in only one sample. The 5 year surveillance reveals a decreasing trend of the soil-transmitted nematode prevalence but shows a relatively high hookworm infection rate in the population and pinworm infection in children.\n\nImproving Surveillance and Prevention of Surgical Site Infection in Pediatric Cardiac Surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nCannon, Melissa; Hersey, Diane; Harrison, Sheilah; Joy, Brian; Naguib, Aymen; Galantowicz, Mark; Simsic, Janet\n\n2016-03-01\n\nPostoperative cardiovascular surgical site infections are preventable events that may lead to increased morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. To improve surgical wound surveillance and reduce the incidence of surgical site infections. An institutional review of surgical site infections led to implementation of 8 surveillance and process measures: appropriate preparation the night before surgery and the day of surgery, use of appropriate preparation solution in the operating room, appropriate timing of preoperative antibiotic administration, placement of a photograph of the surgical site in the patient's chart at discharge, sending a photograph of the surgical site to the patient's primary care physician, 30-day follow-up of the surgical site by an advanced nurse practitioner, and placing a photograph of the surgical site obtained on postoperative day 30 in the patient's chart. Mean overall compliance with the 8 measures from March 2013 through February 2014 was 88%. Infections occurred in 10 of 417 total operative cases (2%) in 2012, in 8 of 437 total operative cases (2%) in 2013, and in 7 of 452 total operative cases (1.5%) in 2014. Institution of the surveillance process has resulted in improved identification of suspected surgical site infections via direct rather than indirect measures, accurate identification of all surgical site infections based on definitions of the National Healthcare Safety Network, collaboration with all persons involved, and enhanced communication with patients' family members and referring physicians.

A web-based electronic form was provided for all national coordinators of the European CDI Surveillance Network (ECDIS-Net). Of 35 national coordinators approached, 33 from 31 European countries replied. Surveillance of CDI was in place in 14 of the 31 countries, comprising 18 different nationwide systems. Three of 14 countries with CDI surveillance used public health notification of cases as the route of reporting, and in another three, reporting was limited to public health notification of cases of severe CDI. The CDI definitions published by the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) were widely used, but there were differing definitions to distinguish between community- and healthcare-associated cases. All CDI surveillance systems except one reported annual national CDI rates (calculated as number of cases per patient-days). Only four surveillance systems regularly integrated microbiological data (typing and susceptibility testing results). Surveillance methods varied considerably between countries, which emphasises the need for a harmonised European protocol to allow consistent monitoring of the CDI epidemiology at European level. The results of this survey were used to develop a harmonised EU-wide hospital-based CDI surveillance protocol.

Our objectives were to examine the impact of S. aureus decolonization on the incidence of S. aureus infection and to measure the prevalence of mupirocin resistance. Methods We retrospectively identified neonates admitted to a tertiary care NICU between April 1 2011 and September 30 2014. We compared rates of MSSA-positive cultures and infections before and after implementation of active surveillance culture and decolonization intervention for MSSA-colonized neonates. We used two measurements to identify the primary outcome, NICU-attributable MSSA: 1) any culture sent during routine clinical care that grew MSSA and 2) any culture that grew MSSA and met criteria of the NHSN's HAI surveillance definitions. S. aureus isolates were tested for mupirocin susceptibility. To determine the impact of the intervention on MSSA infection, we estimated incidence rate ratios using interrupted time series models. Results Pre- and post-intervention, 1523 neonates (29,220 patient-days) and 1195 neonates (22,045 patient-days) were admitted to the NICU, respectively. There was an immediate reduction in mean quarterly incidence rate of NICU-attributable MSSA-positive clinical cultures, of more than 60% (IRR=0.36, 95% CI 0.19, 0.70) after implementation of the intervention and MSSA positive culture rates continued to decrease by 21% per quarter (IRR 0.79 95% CI 0.74, 0.84). MSSA infections also decreased immediately following the intervention implementation (IRR=0.27; 95% CI=0.10, 0.79). No mupirocin resistance was detected. Conclusions Active surveillance cultures and decolonization may be effective in decreasing S. aureus infections in NICUs.

In Central Asia, and in particular on the territory of Uzbekistan, a detailed assessment of glacier lakes and their evolution over time is, however lacking. For this reason we created the first detailed inventory of mountain lakes of Uzbekistan based on recent (2002-2014) satellite observations using WorldView-2, SPOT5, and IKONOS imagery with a spatial resolution from 2 to 10m. This record was complemented with data from field studies of the last 50years. The previous data were mostly in the form of inventories of lakes, available in Soviet archives, and primarily included localized in-situ data. The inventory of mountain lakes presented here, by contrast, includes an overview of all lakes of the territory of Uzbekistan. Lakes were considered if they were located at altitudes above 1500m and if lakes had an area exceeding 100m 2 . As in other mountain regions of the World, the ongoing increase of air temperatures has led to an increase in lake number and area. Moreover, the frequency and overall number of lake outburst events have been on the rise as well. Therefore, we also present the first outburst assessment with an updated version of well-known approaches considering local climate features and event histories. As a result, out of the 242 lakes identified on the territory of Uzbekistan, 15% are considered prone to outburst, 10% of these lakes have been assigned low outburst potential and the remainder of the lakes have an average level of outburst potential. We conclude that the distribution of lakes by elevation shows a significant influence on lake area and hazard potential. No significant differences, by contrast, exist between the distribution of lake area, outburst potential, and lake location with respect to glaciers by regions. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We sought to evaluate this effect by examining a large database of DENV infections captured by both active and passive surveillance encompassing a wide clinical spectrum of disease. We evaluated datasets from 17Â years of hospital-based passive surveillance and nine years of cohort studies, including clinical and subclinical DENV infections, to assess the outcomes of sequential heterologous infections. Chi square or Fisher's exact test was used to compare proportions of infection outcomes such as disease severity; ANOVA was used for continuous variables. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess risk factors for infection outcomes. Of 38,740 DENV infections, two or more infections were detected in 502 individuals; 14 had three infections. The mean ages at the time of the first and second detected infections were 7.6âÂ±â3.0 and 11.2âÂ±â3.0Â years. The shortest time between sequential infections was 66Â days. A longer time interval between sequential infections was associated with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in the second detected infection (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2-1.4). All possible sequential serotype pairs were observed among 201 subjects with DHF at the second detected infection, except DENV-4 followed by DENV-3. Among DENV infections detected in cohort subjects by active study surveillance and subsequent non-study hospital-based passive surveillance, hospitalization at the first detected infection increased the likelihood of hospitalization at the second detected infection. Increasing time between sequential DENV infections was associated with greater severity of the second detected infection, supporting the role of heterotypic immunity in both protection and enhancement. Hospitalization was positively associated between the first and second detected infections, suggesting\n\nVector borne infections in Italy: results of the integrated surveillance system for West Nile disease in 2013.\n\nPubMed\n\nNapoli, Christian; Iannetti, Simona; Rizzo, Caterina; Bella, Antonino; Di Sabatino, Daria; Bruno, Rossana; Sauro, Francesca; Martini, Vanessa; Santucci, Vincenzo Ugo; Declich, Silvia; Calistri, Paolo\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe epidemiology of West Nile disease (WND) is influenced by multiple ecological factors and, therefore, integrated surveillance systems are needed for early detecting the infection and activating consequent control actions. As different animal species have different importance in the maintenance and in the spread of the infection, a multispecies surveillance approach is required. An integrated and comprehensive surveillance system is in place in Italy aiming at early detecting the virus introduction, monitoring the possible infection spread, and implementing preventive measures for human health. This paper describes the integrated surveillance system for WND in Italy, which incorporates data from veterinary and human side in order to evaluate the burden of infection in animals and humans and provide the public health authorities at regional and national levels with the information needed for a fine tune response.\n\nIntegrated Multilevel Surveillance of the World's Infecting Microbes and Their Resistance to Antimicrobial Agents\n\nPubMed Central\n\nO'Brien, Thomas F.; Stelling, John\n\n2011-01-01\n\nSummary: Microbial surveillance systems have varied in their source of support; type of laboratory reporting (patient care or reference); inclusiveness of reports filed; extent of microbial typing; whether single hospital, multihospital, or multicountry; proportion of total medical centers participating; and types, levels, integration across levels, and automation of analyses performed. These surveillance systems variably support the diagnosis and treatment of patients, local or regional infection control, local or national policies and guidelines, laboratory capacity building, sentinel surveillance, and patient safety. Overall, however, only a small fraction of available data are under any surveillance, and very few data are fully integrated and analyzed. Advancing informatics and genomics can make microbial surveillance far more efficient and effective at preventing infections and improving their outcomes. The world's microbiology laboratories should upload their reports each day to programs that detect events, trends, and epidemics in communities, hospitals, countries, and the world.

The iHAUTISIS can automatically collect data relevant to HAUTI surveillance from the different EMR systems, and provides a visualization dashboard that helps ICPs make better surveillance plans and facilitates their surveillance work. In order to measure the system performance, we also created a generic model for comparing the ICPs' work efficiency when using existing electronic culture-based surveillance information system (eCBSIS) and iHAUTISIS, respectively. This model can demonstrate a patient's state (unsuspected, suspected, and confirmed) and corresponding time spent on surveillance tasks performed by ICPs for the patient in that state. The study results showed that the iHAUTISIS performed better than the eCBSIS in terms of ICPs' time cost. It reduced the time by 73.27 s, when using iHAUTISIS (114.26 s) and eCBSIS (187.53 s), for each patient on average. With increased adoption of EMR systems, the development of the integrated HAI surveillance information systems would be more and more cost-effective. Moreover, the iHAUTISIS adopted web-based technology that enables ICPs to online access patient's surveillance information using laptops or mobile devices. Therefore, our system can further facilitate the HAI surveillance and reduce ICPs' surveillance workloads. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Dangerous phenomena such as drought, flooding, mud flows, landslides and others, that are becoming frequent in conditions of climate changes, increase instability of an agricultural production, and threaten rural livelihoods. In connection with weather and climate natural disasters, these phenomena become reasons of declining food production, water contamination, and economical damages. Within the Project granted by NATO: Science for Peace and Security programme, modern advanced remote sensing technologies will be applied to perform large scale monitoring of (early) slope deformations, including Satellite SAR Interferometry (InSAR) techniques, Ground Laser Scanning for in-situ refinement of detected movements or Multibeam Echosounding for monitoring slope deformation advancement into water objects.

Most hantavirus infections are caused by Sin Nombre virus, but cases of HPS caused by Bayou, Black Creek Canal, Monongahela, and New York viruses have been reported, and cases of domestically acquired hemorrhagic fever and renal syndrome caused by Seoul virus have also occurred. Rarely, hantavirus infections result in mild illness that does not progress to HPS. Continued testing and surveillance of clinical cases in humans will improve our understanding of the etiologic agents involved and the spectrum of diseases.\n\nIncreasing Antimicrobial Resistance Monitored in Surveillance Analysis of Blood Stream Infections in Febrile Neutropenic Pediatric Oncology Patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nEl-Mahallawy, Hadir A; Hassan, Safaa Shawky; El-Wakil, Mohamed; Moneer, Manar M; Shalaby, Lobna\n\n2015-01-01\n\nContinuous surveillance of pattern of blood stream infection is necessary in febrile neutropenia (FN)especially with the recent escalating trend in the management of pediatric cancer patients towards intensified regimens and with the increase in infections caused by resistant organisms limiting the choice of antibiotics. To monitor change in pattern of blood stream infections (BSI) in FN pediatric cancer patients. Surveillance of FN episodes with positive BSI was prospectively monitored and compared to a previous surveillance in the same pediatric oncology unit. A total of 232 BSI positive episodes were documented in 192 patients during a 6 months period. The results of recent surveillance analysis showed an increase in intensified regimens of chemotherapy, antimicrobial resistance, fungal infections, and prolonged duration of episodes when compared to previous surveillance, with p value sof <0.001, 0.005, 0.021, and <0.001, respectively. There was an apparent decrease in the crude mortality but this was not statistically significant, to 6% in 2011 from 10 % in 2006. The pattern of BSI at our institution is still inclining towards gram positive organisms but is showing a shift towards more antibiotic resistance and fungal infections.\n\nVector Borne Infections in Italy: Results of the Integrated Surveillance System for West Nile Disease in 2013\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNapoli, Christian; Di Sabatino, Daria; Martini, Vanessa; Santucci, Vincenzo Ugo; Declich, Silvia\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe epidemiology of West Nile disease (WND) is influenced by multiple ecological factors and, therefore, integrated surveillance systems are needed for early detecting the infection and activating consequent control actions.

Various organochlorine pesticides were widely used for cotton production before Uzbekistan's independence in 1991. In Khorezm, small lakes have formed in natural depressions that receive inputs mostly from agricultural runoff. Samples from lake waters and sediments, as well as water from the Amu Darya River (which is the source of most of the lake water) have been analyzed to study variations in the concentrations of organochlorine pesticides residues during the year. Low concentrations of DDT, DDD, DDE, a-HCH and y-HCH compounds were found in water and sediment samples. The concentration of persistent organochlorine pesticides (DDT and HCH) in water and sediment is much lower than the maximum permissible concentrations that exist for water and soil. According to these preliminary results, the investigated lakes in Khorezm appear to be suitable for recreation or for aquaculture.\n\nIntroduction of software tools for epidemiological surveillance in infection control in Colombia.\n\nPubMed\n\nHernÃ¡ndez-GÃ³mez, Cristhian; Motoa, Gabriel; Vallejo, Marta; Blanco, VÃ­ctor M; Correa, Adriana; de la Cadena, Elsa; Villegas, MarÃ­a Virginia\n\n2015-01-01\n\nHealthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) are a challenge for patient safety in the hospitals.

We estimated the sensitivity and specificity of surveillance case definitions using published data. We assumed a 10% ZIKV infection risk during a non-outbreak period and hypothetical increases in risk during an outbreak period. We used sensitivity and specificity estimates to correct for non-differential misclassification, and calculated a misclassification-corrected relative risk comparing both periods. To identify the smallest hypothetical increase in risk resulting in a detectable outbreak we compared the misclassification-corrected relative risk to the relative risk corresponding to the upper limit of the endemic channel (meanâ+â2 SD). We also estimated the proportion of false positive cases detected during the outbreak. We followed the same approach for microcephaly and GBS, but assumed the risk of ZIKV infection doubled during the outbreak, and ZIKV infection increased the risk of both diseases. ZIKV infection outbreaks were not detectable through non-serological surveillance. Outbreaks were detectable through serologic surveillance if infection risk increased by at least 10%, but more than 50% of all cases were false positive. Outbreaks of severe microcephaly were detected if ZIKV infection increased prevalence of this condition by at least 24.0 times. When ZIKV infection did not increase the prevalence of severe microcephaly, 34.7 to 82.5% of all cases were false positive, depending on diagnostic accuracy. GBS outbreaks were detected if ZIKV infection increased the GBS risk by at least seven times. For optimal GBS diagnosis accuracy, the proportion of false positive cases ranged from 29 to 54% and from 45 to 56% depending on the incidence of GBS mimics.

Infection prevention and control programmes have been in place for several years in response to the incidence of healthcare-associated infections and their associated morbidity and mortality. Theoretical frameworks play an important role in formalizing the understanding of infection prevention activities. Discussion paper. A literature search using electronic databases was conducted for published articles in English addressing theoretical frameworks in infection prevention and control between 1980-2012. Nineteen papers that included a reference to frameworks were identified in the review. A narrative analysis of these papers was completed. Two models were identified and neither included the role of surveillance. To reduce the risk of acquiring a healthcare-associated infection, a multifaceted approach to infection prevention is required. One key component in this approach is surveillance. The review identified two infection prevention and control frameworks, yet these are rarely applied in infection prevention and control programmes. Only one framework considered the multifaceted approach required for infection prevention. It did not, however, incorporate the role of surveillance. We present a framework that incorporates the role of surveillance into a biopsychosocial approach to infection prevention and control. Infection prevention and control programmes and associated research are led primarily by nurses. There is a need for an explicit infection prevention and control framework incorporating the important role that surveillance has in infection prevention activities. This study presents one framework for further critique and discussion.

Numerous healthcare bodies in Europe and the United States have championed active surveillance per the \"search and destroy\" model. However, this strategy is associated with significant economic, logistical, and patient costs without any impact on other hospital-acquired pathogens. We evaluated whether horizontal infection control strategies could decrease the prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection in the ICU, without the need for active surveillance. Retrospective, observational study in the surgical ICU of a tertiary care medical center in Boston, MA, from 2005 to 2012. A total of 6,697 patients in the surgical ICU. Evidence-based infection prevention strategies were implemented in an iterative fashion, including 1) hand hygiene program with refresher education campaign, 2) chlorhexidine oral hygiene program, 3) chlorhexidine bathing, 4) catheter-associated bloodstream infection program, and 5) daily goals sheets. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection fell from 2.66 to 0.69 per 1,000 patient days from 2005 to 2012, an average decrease of 21% per year. The biggest decline in rate of infection was detected in 2008, which may suggest that the catheter-associated bloodstream infection prevention program was particularly effective. Among 4,478 surgical ICU admissions over the last 5 years, not a single case of methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia was observed. Aggressive multifaceted horizontal infection control is an effective strategy for reducing the prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection and eliminating methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia in the ICU without the need for active surveillance and decontamination.\n\nHuman surveillance for West Nile virus infection in Ontario in 2000\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFord-Jones, E. Lee; Fearon, Margaret; Leber, Chuck; Dwight, Prabo; Myszak, Moira; Cole, Beverly; Greene, Pam Baker; Artes, Sheila; McGeer, Allison; D'Cunha, Colin; Naus, Monika\n\n2002-01-01\n\nBackground The first reports of West Nile virus (WNV) infection in the United States in 1999 prompted Ontario to establish a surveillance protocol to monitor for the possible spread of the virus into the province. Surveillance components included evaluation of dead birds, sentinel chickens, mosquito pools and human disease. We report the results of human surveillance in 2000. Methods Between July 1 and Oct. 31, 2000, an active surveillance program was undertaken in which designated site coordinators in sentinel hospitals identified patients who met the suspect case definition (fever and fluctuating level of consciousness [encephalopathy], with or without muscle weakness). During the same period, following province-wide distribution of educational material, all other patients tested for WNV antibodies were identified through review of provincial laboratory reports (laboratory-based enhanced passive surveillance). Results Of the 60 hospitals contacted, 59 agreed to participate in the active surveillance program; 52 provided information on a regular (weekly) basis, and 7 submitted fewer than 8 reports. Thirty-six (61%) of the sentinel sites reported suspect cases. In total, 188 patients were tested (130 identified through active surveillance and 58 through enhanced passive surveillance). Patients identified through active surveillance were more likely than those identified through passive surveillance to meet the suspect case definition (43% [n = 56] v. 7% [n = 4]), to be admitted to hospital (75% [n = 99] v. 16% [n = 9]), to have a longer hospital stay (mean 25 v. 3 days), to have had a second (convalescent) serum sample collected (37% [n = 48] v. 31% [n = 18]), to have had a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample banked (56% [n = 73] v. 14% [n = 8]) and to have had a discharge diagnosis reported (79% [n = 103] v. 28% [n = 16]). Of the 60 patients (32%) who met the suspect case definition, 34 (57% [31 active, 3 passive]) had a discharge diagnosis of encephalitis.

They result in prolonged hospital stays and increased hospital costs. Neonates are susceptible hosts because of prematurity of organ systems, immaturity of immune system, low birth weight and the use of invasive devices. Most infections are endemic others can occur during outbreaks. As advances in medical technology improve mortality in the tiniest of infants, it is imperative that health care providers identify effective interventions to minimize the risks of nosocomial infections in the NICU. Recommended infection control and prevention strategies are: hand washing promotion, decreased use of invasive procedures, limited antitibiotic exposure, environmental hygiene. In this context infection surveillance is the first step to recognize and analyze problems, to effectively target infection control measures and feedback. Any suspicion of an outbreak should lead to a review of general infection control procedures to prevent the spread of the pathogens as quickly as possible. A multidisciplinary approach can be an effective means of developing a plan of action to apply prolonged and strict adherence to isolation precautions', to detect potential reservoirs or source of infections, to educate every member of the patient care team and to review NICU protocols.\n\n[Surveillance and forecast for schistosome infectivity of Yangtze River and Hanbeihe River during flooding in Hubei Province].\n\nPubMed\n\nTu, Zu-Wu; Cai, Shun-Xiang; Huang, Xi-Bao; Su, Zheng-Ming; Gao, Hua; Chen, Yan-Yan; Cao, Mu-Min; Mao, Guan-Xiang; Xia, Ping-Feng\n\n2012-04-01\n\nTo investigate the schistosome infectivity of the water body of the Yangtze River and Hanbeihe River during flooding in Hubei Province. The Oncomelania snail status was investigated in 17 sites of the Yangtze River and Hanbei River, and the infectivity of schistosome in sentinel mice was also determined. In the Yangtze River and Hanbei River, the average densities of living snails were 0.35 snails/0.1 m2 and 0.67 snails/0.1 m2 respectively, and the average infection rates of snails were 0.33% and 0.05%, respectively. The sentinel mouse surveillances were carried out twice in 10 sites of the Yangtze River. During the first surveillance the infection rate was 5.5% with 4 positive environment sites, and that was 5.5% with 7 positive environment sites in the second surveillance. The sentinel mouse surveillance was carried out once in 7 sites of the Hanbeihe River, and the infection rate was 11.9% with 4 positive environment sites. By monitoring schistosome infection of the water body, we can understand the threat of environment and provide warning information to prevent from the outbreak and spread of acute schistosomiasis. We can also indirectly get many messages about the quality of snail investigation and the effect of mollusciciding.\n\nCharacteristics of national and statewide health care-associated infection surveillance programs: A qualitative study.\n\nPubMed\n\nRusso, Philip L; Havers, Sally M; Cheng, Allen C; Richards, Michael; Graves, Nicholas; Hall, Lisa\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThere are many well-established national health care-associated infection surveillance programs (HAISPs). Although validation studies have described data quality, there is little research describing important characteristics of large HAISPs. The aim of this study was to broaden our understanding and identify key characteristics of large HAISPs. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with purposively selected leaders from national and state-based HAISPs. Interview data were analyzed following an interpretive description process. Seven semi-structured interviews were conducted over a 6-month period during 2014-2015. Analysis of the data generated 5 distinct characteristics of large HAISPs: (1) triggers: surveillance was initiated by government or a cooperative of like-minded people, (2) purpose: a clear purpose is needed and determines other surveillance mechanisms, (3) data measures: consistency is more important than accuracy, (4) processes: a balance exists between the volume of data collected and resources, and (5) implementation and maintenance: a central coordinating body is crucial for uniformity and support. National HAISPs are complex and affect a broad range of stakeholders. Although the overall goal of health care-associated infection surveillance is to reduce the incidence of health care-associated infection, there are many crucial factors to be considered in attaining this goal. The findings from this study will assist the development of new HAISPs and could be used as an adjunct to evaluate existing programs. C"
