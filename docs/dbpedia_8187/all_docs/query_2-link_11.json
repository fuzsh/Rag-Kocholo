        "text": "German writer (1871–1950)\n\nLuiz Heinrich Mann (German: [ˈhaɪnʁɪç ˈman] ⓘ; March 27, 1871 – March 11, 1950), best known as simply Heinrich Mann, was a German writer known for his socio-political novels. From 1930 until 1933, he was president of the fine poetry division of the Prussian Academy of Arts. His fierce criticism of the growing Fascism and Nazism forced him to flee Germany after the Nazis came to power during 1933. He was the elder brother of writer Thomas Mann.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nBorn in Lübeck, as the oldest child of Senator Thomas Johann Heinrich Mann, grain merchant and finance minister of the Free City of Lübeck, a state of the German Empire, and Júlia da Silva Bruhns. He was the elder brother of the writer Thomas Mann with whom he had a lifelong rivalry.[1][2] The Mann family was an affluent family of grain merchants of the Hanseatic city of Lübeck. After the death of his father, his mother relocated the family to Munich, where Heinrich began his career as a freier Schriftsteller (free writer). In 1914, he married a Czech actress, Maria \"Mimi\" Kanova. They divorced in 1930. Mimi, being jewish, died from the consequences of a five-year detention in the concentration camp Theresienstadt.\n\nWork and Exile\n\n[edit]\n\nMann's essay on Émile Zola and the novel Der Untertan (published over the years 1912–1918) earned him much respect during the Weimar Republic in the left-wing circles, since they demonstrated the author's anti-war and deafeatist stance during the World War I, and since the latter satirized Imperial German society; both the novel and the essay became a major impulse for Thomas Mann to write Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man, a work supporting the efforts of the German Empire in the war and condemning Heinrich as one of \"Civilisation's Literary Men\" (Zivilisationsliteraten), the writers who served the West in its struggle against German \"Culture\"; later Thomas called the novel an example of \"national slander\" and \"ruthless ruthless aestheticism\", while the novel had such admirers as Kurt Tucholsky. During the revolution, Heinrich became a major supporter of Kurt Eisner, a social democrat revolutionary who proclaimed Bavaria a Socialist republic; after Eisner's assassination by a far-right activist, Mann spoke at Eisner's funeral.[3]\n\nLater, in 1930, his book Professor Unrat was freely adapted into the movie Der Blaue Engel (The Blue Angel). Carl Zuckmayer wrote the script, and Josef von Sternberg was the director. Mann wanted his paramour, the actress Trude Hesterberg, to play the main female part as the \"actress\" Lola Lola (named Rosa Fröhlich in the novel), but Marlene Dietrich was given the part, her first sound role. The film helped her achieve her breakthrough, including in Hollywood, and became an icon in film history.\n\nTogether with Albert Einstein and other celebrities during 1932, Mann was a signatory to the \"Urgent Call for Unity\", asking the voters to reject the Nazis. Einstein and Mann had previously co-authored a letter during 1931 condemning the murder of Croatian scholar Milan Šufflay.\n\nMann became persona non grata in Nazi Germany and left even before the Reichstag fire of 1933. He went to France where he lived in Paris and Nice. During the German occupation, he made his way to Marseille, where he was aided by Varian Fry in September 1940 to escape to Spain. Assisted by Justus Rosenberg, he and his wife Nelly Kröger, his nephew Golo Mann, Alma Mahler-Werfel and Franz Werfel hiked for six hours across the border at Port Bou. After arriving in Portugal, the group stayed in Monte Estoril, at the Grande Hotel D'Itália, between September 18 and October 4, 1940.[4] On October 4, 1940, they boarded the S.S. Nea Hellas, headed for New York City.\n\nHe then lived poor and sickly in Los Angeles, supported by his brother Thomas, who lived in Pacific Palisades (Thomas Mann House). The relationship between the two brothers was always difficult, because Thomas was more successful, received the 1929 Nobel Prize in Literature, had a rich wife, and the brothers differed considerably politically. Heinrich styled himself as a socialist revolutionary, Thomas, perhaps precisely because of this, at least in his younger years, gave himself a conservative image. They also had little appreciation for each other's very different writing styles and topics.[5] While Heinrich was considered a womanizer and philanderer who preferred lower-class women, Thomas valued respectability and looked down on his brother's constant string of mistresses and prostitutes, whom Heinrich described quite openly in some of his novels and short stories, but at the same time was fascinated by young men. In 1911, Heinrich had accompanied his brother and sister-in-law to Venice, where they stayed at the Grand Hôtel des Bains on the Venice Lido. There he witnessed Thomas' obsession with a handsome Polish boy, Władysław (Władzio) Moes. Thomas processed his experience in the novella Death in Venice (1912).[6]\n\nThe Nazis burnt Heinrich Mann's books as \"contrary to the German spirit\" during the infamous book burning of May 10, 1933, which was instigated by the then Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels.\n\nLater life\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 1930s and later in American exile, Mann's literary popularity waned. Nevertheless, he wrote Die Jugend des Königs Henri Quatre and Die Vollendung des Königs Henri Quatre about the French King Henry IV as part of the Exilliteratur. The two novels describe the life and importance of the highly controversial, yet successful and womanizing king, who is ultimately murdered. This work was acclaimed by his brother Thomas Mann, who spoke of the \"great splendour and dynamic art\" of the work. The plot, based on Europe's early modern history from a French perspective, anticipated the end of French–German enmity, similar to how the king had tried to end the religious wars.\n\nHis second wife, Nelly Mann [de] (1898–1944), died by suicide in Los Angeles.\n\nHeinrich Mann died on March 11, 1950, sixteen days before his 79th birthday, in Santa Monica, California, lonely and without much money, just months before he was to relocate to East Berlin to become president of the East German Academy of Arts. His ashes were later taken to East Germany and were interred at the Dorotheenstadt Cemetery in a grave of honor.\n\nPopular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nMann was portrayed by Alec Guinness in the television adaptation of Christopher Hampton's play Tales from Hollywood (1992).\n\nIn Die Manns – Ein Jahrhundertroman (2001) he was played by Jürgen Hentsch.\n\nFilm adaptations\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Blue Angel, directed by Josef von Sternberg (Germany, 1930, based on the novel Professor Unrat)\n\nDer Untertan, directed by Wolfgang Staudte (East Germany, 1951, based on the novel Der Untertan)\n\nThe Blue Angel, directed by Edward Dmytryk (USA, 1959, based on the novel Professor Unrat)\n\nMadame Legros [de], directed by Michael Kehlmann (West Germany, 1968, TV film, based on the play Madame Legros)\n\nMan of Straw, directed by Herbert Wise (UK, 1972, TV miniseries, based on the novel Der Untertan)\n\nIm Schlaraffenland, directed by Kurt Jung-Alsen (East Germany, 1975, TV film, based on the novel Im Schlaraffenland)\n\nBelcanto oder Darf eine Nutte schluchzen?, directed by Robert van Ackeren (West Germany, 1977, based on the novel Empfang bei der Welt)\n\nDie Verführbaren, directed by Helmut Schiemann [de] (East Germany, 1977, TV film, based on the novel Ein ernstes Leben)\n\nLe Roi qui vient du sud [fr], directed by Marcel Camus and Heinz Schirk [de] (France, 1979, TV miniseries, based on the novel Die Jugend des Königs Henri Quatre)\n\nIn the Land of Cockaigne, directed by Fritz Umgelter (West Germany, 1981, TV film, based on the novel Im Schlaraffenland)\n\nSuturp – Eine Liebesgeschichte, directed by Gerd Keil (East Germany, 1981, TV film, based on the short story Suturp)\n\nDie traurige Geschichte von Friedrich dem Großen [de], directed by Alexander Lang (East Germany, 1983, TV film, based on the unfinished Die traurige Geschichte von Friedrich dem Großen)\n\nVarieté, directed by Martin Eckermann [de] (East Germany, 1985, TV film, based on the play Varieté)\n\nEndstation Harembar [de], directed by Rainer Wolffhardt [de] (Germany, 1992, TV film, based on the novel Ein ernstes Leben)\n\nHenri 4, directed by Jo Baier (Germany, 2010, based on the novels Die Jugend des Königs Henri Quatre and Die Vollendung des Königs Henri Quatre)\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nExilliteratur\n\nDohm-Mann family tree\n\nUrgent Call for Unity\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nGross, David: The Writer and Society: Heinrich Mann and Literary Politics in Germany, 1890–1940, Humanities Press, New Jersey, 1980, (ISBN 0-391-00972-9)\n\nHamilton, Nigel: The Brothers Mann: The Lives of Heinrich and Thomas Mann, Yale University Press, (1978), (ISBN 9780300026689)\n\nJuers, Evelyn: House of Exile: The Life and Times of Heinrich Mann and Nelly Kroeger-Mann, Giramondo Publishing Co., Australia, 2008, (ISBN 978-1-920882-44-0)\n\nMauthner, Martin: German Writers in French Exile, 1933–1940, Vallentine Mitchell, London, 2007, (ISBN 978-0-85303-540-4).\n\nWalter Fähnders/Walter Delabar: Heinrich Mann (1871–1950).
