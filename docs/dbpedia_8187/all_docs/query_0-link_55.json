        "text": "Modern forms of popular culture emerged at the intersection of accelerated urban development and increasing transnational interactions in the decades around 1900. The urban entertainment sector was a hotspot of globalisation, characterized by intense cross-border transfer and exchange, making cosmopolitan culture accessible for the majority of leisure-seeking urban dwellers. Only just recently however, has research in this field begun to catch up with developments and debates in transnational and global history, and vice versa. These two edited volumes give an overview of current trends, new conceptual debates, as well as of remaining open questions in research on popular culture in the modern metropolis.\n\nVariety and revue shows played a significant role in popular culture during the first half of the 20 th century. Serving as a typical genre of cosmopolitan urban entertainment, these productions consisted of international acts, where a 'foreign' act was mostly defined by music, visual appearances and performance style; thus, not exclusively by the actual origin of the performer. This paper aims to analyze the presence and influence of Hungarian (style) acts in Berlin in three different socio-political contexts: the Weimar Republic, the NS-Zeit, and the Nachkriegszeit until the Berlin Wall was erected. Three large venues, the Plaza, the Scala and the Wintergarten (ca. 3000 seats each) defined the urban live entertainment sphere from 1920 onwards. These venues held shows until 1944. After the Second World War, only one large hall was opened in the destroyed city, the Friedrichstadt-Palast (in the Soviet occupation zone), which became a representative venue for East-Berlin as well as the GDR. The fact that Hungarian (style) acts were present in Berlin shows without a break during the entire research period shows that it did not depend on governmental cultural policies. The Hungarian show constituted a complex phenomenon which generated interest in the audience, guaranteeing their regular appearance. This analysis is based on primary sources; namely, a photography and programs collection housed at the Stadtmuseum Berlin. Moreover, Hungarian and German professional journals were utilized in this research."
