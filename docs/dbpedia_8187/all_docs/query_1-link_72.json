In particular it examines how various branches of culture were utilized to control the masses and, after 1938, dedicated to the Nazi purpose of European if not world subjugation. But it also looks at how the workings of totalitarianism impacted the arts and artists themselves.\n\nThe relationship between culture and tyranny is complex – and whether or not culture is even possible in a dictatorship remains a ripe question. If the aesthetic, formal, and ethical power of culture thrives on contradiction to prevailing social and political norms, or even the exposition of unresolved tensions, then it will arguably always fail under tyranny. The Nazis nipped aesthetic pluralism in the bud when Hitler came to power in early 1933. Nor did the arts and letters ever attain sovereign originality under the dictator. Nonetheless there was a concerted effort to create a National Socialist aesthetic – an effort which links to the Nazis’ increasingly pervasive control over German life, and their war aims. So although we already know in broader terms that culture was pressed into totalitarian uses by Nazi agencies, led by the Propaganda Ministry, looking at how this was achieved in more detail, how a new Nazi culture was constructed (and what was eliminated), as well as how this all fitted into a wider agenda of annihilation of the Jews, other Nazi-nonconformist groups, and coveted territorial dominance, should reveal much about the nature and inner workings of the Third Reich. Such is this book’s undertaking.\n\nThe book’s first contention is that in order for a new Nazi type of culture to take hold, the preceding forms first had to be wiped out. This mainly affected the artistic and intellectual achievements most hated by the Nazis, those of the Weimar Republic, whose aesthetic and political hallmark was Modernism. The police controls Hitler used to carry out purges in political and social contexts were also used against Modernist art forms and their creators. We shall see the various other mechanisms the Nazis used to stamp out Modernism and what they put in its place. We shall also see how far the Modernists were able to withstand this assault and when, if at all, they had to concede defeat.\n\nChapter 2 will look at how, once a new Nazi type of culture was in place, it fitted into a totalitarian pattern of governance in the pre-war years. The cultural forms of music, film, radio, the press, the visual arts and architecture, live theater and literature, supplied the content that Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, above all others of Hitler’s cronies, needed in order to intimidate or encourage the masses, and ultimately control them under his and Hitler’s tyrannical regime. Goebbels ingeniously organized these art forms in a conveniently pliable system of, eventually, six culture chambers as early as the fall of 1933, which he personally oversaw and could manipulate. How these different elements of culture were utilized politically and socially will be examined, as well as how effectively such control was exercised and what happened to the cultural media and their creators in the process.\n\nChapters 3 and 4 will look at Jews in the Nazi cultural establishment, and how the uses of culture shifted when Germany was at war. We know today that at the dawn of World War II one of Hitler’s main aims had already been well realized: the exclusion of the Jews from the German völkisch community. What we know less about, however, is the significance of the Jews in the formation of Weimar culture, and how those Jews were dealt with after January 1933. It will be shown to what extent Nazi culture, such as it was, was used to move forward the total elimination of the Jews. As should become clearer in this book, anti-Semitism was expressed through the Nazi arts, and the historian today can point to many human tragedies in the retracing of that course. The war itself further defined the arts in Germany, new and of older vintage, squarely in terms of service to the recently constructed totalitarian polity, with a dedicated martial purpose after 1938. We shall see what specific qualities in the arts were employed to render culture serviceable in this fashion, and how this affected the artists themselves. We shall also see how far the wartime uses of culture had a bearing on the final outcome of the conflict for the regime’s leadership and its subjects.\n\nIt is already well known that after 1933, part of German culture, traditionalist and Modernist, was carried on in countries other than Germany, where anti-Nazi émigrés attempted to take root. Chapter 5 will look at these efforts as well as the lines of continuity that existed from German-defined art to émigré art, with the outbreak of World War II as a possible caesura. Many refugees have described how the lives and work of artists and men and women of letters changed in emigration substantially. The unusual case of Nobel laureate Thomas Mann, who continued with his work as an émigré in almost exactly the same manner as he had done before his exodus, therefore deserves special attention. It remains to be seen why, if Mann had withstood the trauma of exile and continued to write so prolifically, he was not welcomed back to Germany after the war, as well as why he himself did not wish to return to a society that had once included him as its member.\n\nChapter 6 will consider the ways in which the creative class after 1945 attempted to revive true culture in a Germany emancipating itself from the Nazi past. It will be shown how such a resurrection was hampered and delayed by surviving functionaries of the Nazi cultural establishment, who tried to sabotage fresh initiatives embedded in a new democracy, and by political turncoats who usually were more of a hindrance than a help.\n\nThis book is not only the story of culture in Nazi Germany, however incomplete it may necessarily have to be, but also a new history of the Third Reich from 1933 to 1945, told from the vantage point of culture, its protagonists and detractors. It builds on earlier studies of culture in Germany I have published in the past, some with an emphasis on music. A strong catalyst for writing this book was my participation in the pioneering Miller Symposium on the arts in the Third Reich, organized by Francis R. Nicosia and Jonathan Huener at the University of Vermont in the spring of 2004.² Those scholars must be commended even now for having asked fresh questions and encouraging the symposium’s participants to look further and perhaps find some answers.\n\nA prior, single-volume history of culture under the Nazis does not exist bar a few exceptions.³ An early milestone in the field is Joseph Wulf’s five volumes, each of which looks at a different aspect of culture in the Third Reich. But Wulf’s work consists of edited selections of printed primary sources, mostly newspaper and journal pieces, rather than overarching analysis. There are also other important, sometimes even pioneering, partial studies. Outstanding interpretations of film in the Third Reich have been contributed by Eric Rentschler, David Hull, and David Welch, lately also by Bill Niven, and of the press by Bernd Sösemann; literature has been expertly analyzed by Ralf Schnell and music by Fred K. Prieberg, Erik Levi, and Pamela M. Potter.⁴ In the visual arts, the writings of Jonathan Petropoulos have long been pace-setting, and both he and Potter have in more recent times provided important monographs that come close to a more global treatment of the arts under Hitler, each in its own fashion.⁵\n\nSome of the work for this book goes back to a time when I began enjoying the active support (as I still do now) of York University’s research funding connected to my research chair, as well as the support of four major granting agencies. First was a Guggenheim Fellowship in the 1970s. Next to the rescue came the Canada Council Killam Foundation (Ottawa), which granted me a Senior Killam Fellowship twice, to relieve me of teaching for a total of four years. Third, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) in Ottawa supported me many times over the decades, financing research in the field, and finally the Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung in Bonn awarded me a Konrad-Adenauer Research Prize for field work in the 1990s and beyond. To all these institutions, without whose help this book could not have been written, I once again extend my heartfelt thanks. The most recent research in Canada was enabled by the inter-library-loan offices of York University, where I had the good fortune of being assisted by four skilled librarians, Gladys Fung, Mary Lehane, Samantha McWilliams, and Sandra Snell. As they have done before, they helped me again not only in their capacity as librarians, but as research assistants who secured and processed sources for me even when I thought they could never be obtained.\n\nFriends like William E. Seidelman, Herman Schornstein, and Kevin Cook, as well as, especially, my wife Barbara and I, had countless discussions about problem areas and confrontational situations that may have paralleled some in our present day, as global politics seems to be moving in the direction of authoritarianism once again – a political climate in which violations against what should always be autonomous, inviolable, culture, with all its manifestations, occur all too easily. Not least with these thoughts in mind, parts of my manuscript received a careful screening by sage colleagues, Peter Loewenberg, Hans R. Vaget, and Claudio Duran, who read one chapter each with constructive feedback, for which they deserve my gratitude. Alex Ross read the whole manuscript, and his subsequent constructive suggestions are much appreciated. Much credit finally must go to Heather McCallum, Marika Lysandrou, Rachael Lonsdale, and Clarissa Sutherland of Yale University Press. Heather was always at my side offering generous but firm guidelines, and Marika, Rachael, and Clarissa expertly helped turn the manuscript into print. Should there be any mistakes in this book, I alone am accountable for them.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\n◆ ◆ ◆\n\nDeconstructing Modernism\n\nAFTER THEIR ASSUMPTION of political power on January 30, 1933, the National Socialists systematically set out to destroy Modernism in the arts throughout Germany, to make room for their own kind of culture, but they had made plans to do this several years before. They wished German culture to be related to the core values of their ideology, representational not abstract, clear and clean aesthetics and not crooked corners, inspired by what they perceived as the virtues of the Nordic race, extolling the natural beauty of the countryside against the ugliness of industrial cities, exuding the strength and confidence of a racially pure Germanic people in opposition to alien and specifically Jewish influences. Most of this culture should be created anew; whatever was useful from the past might be skillfully integrated, provided ancestral traditions were considered in support of the rising generation.\n\nThe Modernism that had first to be demolished had characterized the culture of the Weimar Republic, from 1918 to 1933, although numerically the creators of modern art had been in the minority, compared with conventional artists. Their often daring efforts had come about, not least, as a form of reaction to the horrors of World War I, as this war was attributed squarely to the ancien régime of Kaiser Wilhelm II and its philistine elites, and they were paralleled, in the political realm, by the formation of a democratic republic. In that sense, both the new politics and culture were experimental. But some of the Modernist arts, such as Expressionism in painting and, in music, the mature operas of Richard Strauss such as Elektra and Salome, reached back before the time of the Great War; moreover, by no means were all Modernists republican or politically left-wing.¹ By the same token, there were conventional artists who believed in a new, democratic form of government.\n\nAfter the armistice of November 1918, writes Peter Gay, all artists, or nearly all, were seized with the quasi-religious fervor to make all things new.² They wanted to try bold experiments with new forms and contents, of artistic objects, of artistic processes. They congregated in the Novembergruppe – Bertolt Brecht, Kurt Weill, Alban Berg, Paul Hindemith, and Walter Gropius – and in December 1918 proclaimed: The future of art and the seriousness of this hour forces us revolutionaries of the spirit (Expressionists, Cubists, Futurists) toward unity and close cooperation.³\n\nWhat followed was the artistic regime of the Bauhaus movement shortly after the establishment of the political republic in 1918, a movement that was to put its cultural stamp on the Weimar era. The Bauhaus masters under Gropius focused on new design and painting, first in the town of Weimar by early 1919 and after 1925 in Dessau, where architecture became a core subject. In Dessau itself a signature building was erected, with its clean rectilinear form and flat roof textbook-like in the Gropius mold.⁴ Still, in late summer of 1923, the Bauhaus had assembled representatives of virtually every important artistic discipline freshly conceived for an exhibition in Weimar. Standing for music and critical journalism was Hans Heinz Stuckenschmidt, who was a follower of dodecaphony, or twelve-tone music, evolving at that time with Arnold Schoenberg as its pioneer. In Weimar, Stuckenschmidt took part in a Musical Cabaret, for which he had written an avant-garde score inspired by Dada, that seemingly inchoate new movement, which dressed in sensual nonsense works of the visual, literary, and sound arts. Hermann Scherchen contributed, the most progressive conductor of the Weimar era next to Otto Klemperer, and Hindemith premiered his recently composed Marienleben song cycle, marked by the composer’s new predilection for polyphony. Ernst Krenek put in an appearance, whose jagged jazz opera Jonny spielt auf (Jonny Plays) would be the hit on German operatic stages in 1927.⁵\n\nThe Bauhaus had its own jazz band, and jazz was becoming the rage in Germany, even with – for this country – a typically over-pronounced drumbeat reminiscent of marching bands, after its prior introduction from the United States into England and France. In the 1920s, jazz was played by German combos in the large cities, chiefly Berlin, in dedicated clubs such as the Rio Rita or Moka Efti, but also in huge emporiums such as Scala and Wintergarten that Adolf Hitler and his propaganda expert Joseph Goebbels sometimes patronized because of operettas featured there, and in cabarets, where stars and starlets of film and operetta, like the young Trude Hesterberg, performed. Jazz also appeared in film, even the first meaningful German talkie The Blue Angel with Marlene Dietrich in 1930, a coy violin student in Weimar when the Bauhaus had started there. For this film the jazz pianist Friedrich Hollaender, later of Hollywood fame, had written the music.⁶\n\nFilmmakers as such were not at the 1923 Weimar exhibition, but several of the Bauhaus artists were interested in movie-making or photography, such as the painter and designer László Moholy-Nagy, whose new techniques included placing objects directly onto unexposed film. Three feature films were to stand out in the republic and gain eternal fame as avant-garde works of high art: Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari (1920), Metropolis (1927), and Mädchen in Uniform (1931). Dr. Caligari showed angular background scenery, oblique walls with borders and ceilings askew. The characters were shifty, morally good or bad or, simultaneously, both: the viewer was confused. Horror was pervasive. Fritz Lang’s Metropolis repeated the play on good or bad, with an evil robot called Maria imitating a physically and morally beauteous maiden, also called Maria. In Mädchen in Uniform lesbian love shone through the plot, exemplifying the republic’s greater tolerance in sexuality, but also the authoritarianism exercised in private schools, a not so veiled criticism of hierarchical structures implanted in the past that had refused to go away.⁷\n\nAmong the painters at the 1923 exhibition were the Bauhaus’s own Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee. Kandinsky had developed abstract painting around 1910 and in Weimar created, among many others, an oil on canvas entitled Auf Weiss II (On White II), in 1923: two black sharp spikes crossing each other, against an abstract of yellow and reddish triangles, a black circle, and other geometric shapes, all on an off-white backcloth. Klee painted somewhat less geometrically and also less abstractly but often in miniature; his Angler of 1921 is finely chiseled; he is standing on a thin board above the water, elegantly handling his fishing line, against a backdrop of gentle blues and whites.⁸\n\nAn early expert on theater at the Bauhaus was Lothar Schreyer (a polymath who also had a doctorate in law from Heidelberg University, painted, wrote prose, and edited an arts journal). He designed and staged a Mondspiel, a Moon Play, which was performed in Weimar in the early 1920s to, alas, little acclaim; later, the Bauhaus painter Oskar Schlemmer’s Triadisches Ballett was more successful. Outside of Weimar, Max Reinhardt was still instrumental in Berlin, although his fame as a theater director had reached its first peak already before the Great War, and now he excelled most particularly as a teacher. As dramaturgs, Leopold Jessner and Erwin Piscator were his most illustrious colleagues, both of them dedicated socialists who saw eye to eye with the Marxist playwright Bertolt Brecht on the need for the theatrical arts to serve the masses, and thus society.⁹ A pace-setting actor just growing into maturity in the mid-1920s was Gustaf Gründgens, who, an androgynous bisexual, was briefly married to Erika Mann, the bisexual daughter of the Nobel laureate Thomas Mann. She helped him in the performance of cabaret, but at that time Gründgens too clamored for revolutionary theater, as he brilliantly starred as Goethe’s Mephistopheles from Faust, yet also in roles created by the new dramatists of Expressionism: Frank Wedekind, Carl Sternheim, and Georg Kaiser. Reinhardt would call Gründgens to Berlin in 1928.¹⁰\n\nSeveral of the multitalented masters at the Bauhaus composed poetry and prose. The most prolific major writers in the Weimar Republic were Gerhart Hauptmann and Thomas Mann, but neither of them was a member of the Weimar Sturm und Drang, as they were intellectually and aesthetically more beholden to the pre-war era. More typically representing the new Weimar dynamics were Brecht with his socialist concerns and Alfred Döblin, a Berlin Jewish physician ministering to the city’s poor with a deep understanding of and compassion for the socially downtrodden. In his novel Berlin Alexanderplatz of 1929 the lead character, Franz Biberkopf, emerges from prison determined to go straight, but through his surroundings becomes embroiled in new complications that distract him. Döblin’s book clearly illustrated the need for social change and individual compassion. But it also warned about ascendant Nazism.¹¹\n\nSocial change was not really something the Nazis were interested in during the 1920s, to say nothing of the attendant political risks. Moreover, a cultural agenda for them was virtually non-existent in the early half of the decade. They were too busy establishing themselves politically and were interrupted in their political progress by the Nazi Party’s tightly circumscribed area of influence (with a presence merely in Bavaria), Hitler’s November 1923 Munich putsch and his detention in Landsberg prison until Christmas 1924. After his release, Hitler was too busy organizing new outposts all over Germany and winning popular support, a process that was many times hampered by German states forbidding him to speak publicly.\n\nThis began to change in 1927, when at the national Party convention in Nuremberg in late August, Hitler announced a few opaque guidelines for what he viewed as cultural renewal.¹² They were not to be mistaken for a blueprint for a culture state, or the intention to regard politics as the highest form of culture, as has recently been claimed.¹³ Indeed, future developments before and after 1933 do not bear this out; culture was to be subordinated, was to serve propaganda; in that context, politics as a form of culture amounts to a meaningless metaphor. Nonetheless, Alfred Rosenberg, Hitler’s early Munich paladin who had established himself as the official ideologue of the movement, was not slow to take up the cue and found a Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur (KfdK), or combat league for German culture. It was supported mainly by politically right-leaning cultural elites such as the Munich publisher Hugo Bruckmann and his wife Elsa, and Winifred Wagner (the composer’s daughter-in-law) in Bayreuth. As such it received an official charter and called for more founding members in May 1928. In a manifesto by Rosenberg, followers were asked to fight in an all-out effort against contemporary literature and the liberal content of the largely city-based (Jewish) press, such as the Frankfurter Zeitung. Implicitly, modern music, architecture, the visual arts, and other sub-disciplines of Expressionism were attacked.¹⁴ Following this, local cells of the Kampfbund were founded, like the one in the Goethe town of Weimar under the völkisch theater expert Hans Severus Ziegler. In Weimar, Ziegler set the tone by delivering an inaugural address, identifying one of the chief enemies of National Socialism, international Communism. His lecture was entitled Bolshevism threatens German Culture.¹⁵\n\nDefamatory work against Weimar republican accomplishments by active members of the Kampfbund began in earnest in 1929. By this time, much characteristic avant-garde art of the republic had become discernible, such as the satirical paintings by George Grosz and Otto Dix, Gropius’s Dessau Bauhaus, Weill and Brecht’s Threepenny Opera, and the Weintraub Syncopators’ jazz dazzlings in Berlin. Rosenberg himself lectured in April, identifying a trend toward greater sensuality in art, which he regarded as a threat to German culture.¹⁶ One of the most pernicious spokesmen for his league would now be Gropius’s rival, the architect Paul Schultze-Naumburg, who advocated traditional architecture, houses with gables instead of flat roofs, and expansive, ornamental, and comfortable old-style interior designs, such as were found in first-class ocean liners. He became the Nazis’ earliest champion of a völkisch art, traveling much on the speaker’s circuit. In 1932 he published a booklet, comparing Modernist paintings to the random pictures by patients in German insane asylums. In Munich that year the architect organized a public exhibition dominated by a similar theme.¹⁷ Additionally, the right-wing poet Hans Friedrich Blunck gave a lecture in front of university students in the spring of 1932, in which he castigated the vulgarized eroticism inherent in Weimar art and mannerist modern music.¹⁸ At the end of the republic, the Nazis had drawn up blacklists with the names of actors whom they considered Marxist or Jewish, to be sent to stage directors and film companies for boycotts to be launched. Fritz Kortner, Heinrich George, and Gründgens were among the names.¹⁹ At the beginning of the Hitler regime, right-wing authors, among them Rosenberg’s stooge Walter Stang, summarized the attempts of their Weimar-era fight against what they regarded as the excrescences of the republican avant-garde: jazzband, Nigger song and Negro art, in addition to erotics of an alien race and Bolshevist agitation.²⁰\n\nWhen in January 1930 the Nazis wrested control of the government of Thuringia, based in the town of Weimar, after a popular regional vote, Hitler managed to have one of his confidants, the jurist Wilhelm Frick, installed as the leading minister of the new cabinet. Well programmed, Frick embarked on a veritable purge of the Thuringian cultural establishment. Not least because of those cultural raids, apart from other changes, political and economic, that the Nazis implemented in Weimar, this was their first experiment in manipulative democracy, since they considered themselves, correctly, as the victors in a constitutionally legal election process. But such nominal correctness rendered them not less, but more dangerous, because they could do much evil under the guise of legality. For the Modernist culture of the storied Goethe town, this spelled nothing less than demolition. As Ziegler had had a hand in drawing up ordinances for change, he became the new chief of Weimar’s national theater. Now forbidden were the staging of modern plays, the performance of atonal music or jazz, visiting cabarets or risqué circus acts. As Schultze-Naumburg was taking over as head of what remained of the Bauhaus, Schlemmer’s frescoes that had been created in the school were deleted, and seventy Expressionist paintings, including works by Klee and Kandinsky, were removed from exhibits in the ducal museum. All scheduled films were censored, especially those with merely a touch of eroticism.²¹\n\nDisruptive and destructive activities by increasingly radicalized adherents of the National Socialist German Workers’ Party (NSDAP), which was picking up steam amidst rising unemployment in the late 1920s, pleased no one on the outside of that movement, especially if they had looked favorably on certain manifestations of Modernism such as films by Lang or intelligent comment in a liberal-bourgeois newspaper. Rather than engaging in nihilist destruction, the Nazi culture brokers would have been more successful had they managed to introduce new artistic and other cultural forms persuasively in line with their ideology, undeniably original, and easily consumable. But in this they failed early, as they would fail again later: hence the early hallmarks of indigenous Nazi culture were a low level of output and poor quality. There was, for example, no film made celebrating Nazi street-fighter heroes by a Nazi-leaning film company, and very few novels by the end of the republic managed to describe the Party’s rise to strength in the past few years.²² Instead, the Nazis were forced to resort to products of culture long tried and true, declare them unjustly neglected and now to be embraced with fervor. Hence for pliable material they were looking to German conventional art mostly of the nineteenth century, to the homely, traditionalist and feel-good architecture of the kind Schultze-Naumburg was promoting, and to novels depicting World War I idols. If little of that could be declared National Socialist in character outright, the Nazis were still able to claim that every new political movement needed precursors and that in their case the inherent purpose of such earlier art ultimately was to lead to specifically Nazi creations. And indeed, most of the artworks the Nazis eventually produced were syncretic, derivative of an earlier, representational and reactionary, culture.\n\nFor its followers, most of whom, at the beginning, came from Germany’s conservative educated classes, the Kampfbund proceeded to sponsor a conventional cultural program, in gradual steps. The league’s journal, Deutsche Kultur-Wacht, presented its readers with \"a combination of serious cultural feature stories and völkisch treatises.\"²³ Demanding racial rejuvenation of art by way of a return to völkisch sources, Schultze-Naumburg organized art shows of nineteenth-century painters Wilhelm Leibl, Franz Defregger, and Hans Thoma, but also works of the German Renaissance.²⁴ The combat league became especially busy in the support of Nazi-minded musicians, who for one reason or another were opposed to the new Modernism. For example, the violinist Gustav Havemann, who had been playing Schoenberg and Hindemith with his vaunted Havemann Quartet, experienced a conversion to National Socialism in 1932; it was then that he assumed the conductorship of the Kampfbund’s own orchestra and from there on continued to serve the Nazi cultural agenda well by performing only traditional works.²⁵ Other musicians who were now lifted into the Nazi Olympus were composers Max Trapp and Paul Graener, minor figures in the German world of music but influential as teachers at the academy of music and the Stern Conservatory in Berlin.²⁶\n\nAlways closely watched by the directors of the combat league, if not Hitler and Goebbels themselves, artistic activities unfolded on the rightist fringe of German political life, stretching from film to art criticism, but inevitably beholden to Germany’s traditionalist cultural past. Hence the South Tyrolean Luis Trenker, a veteran World War I officer and ski instructor with nature-boy charm, made films at the turn of the 1920s about nature’s beauty in the Alps, when he was not meeting for trysts with a young mountain-obsessed actress named Leni Riefenstahl. His movies appealed to patriotic sentiments among Germans, through images of rootedness in valley pastures and conquest of native mountain peaks, especially by conjuring up the unity, across the Alps, between Bavarians, Austrian Tyroleans and their German-speaking cousins in Italian Alto Adige.²⁷ Here, as later, there was a strong patriotic, even chauvinistic subtext. Toward the end of the republic, more kitschy agrarian-based novels were published than ever before about Germany as the home of simple yet trusty peasants.²⁸ Schultze-Naumburg risked more daring analyses between Modernist works of art and staid German classics such as the static Bamberg Horseman, an authoritarian icon, and Blunck extolled traditional German folk dance and German folk song, hoping for a broader renaissance of a Teutonic tribal value system to be galvanized into endurable form by a government under Hitler.²⁹\n\nA PURGE OF THE WEIMAR ERA\n\nAt the end of February 1933 the actor Hans Otto was given notice that he would be dismissed from the Prussian State Theater in Berlin. After more than 100 appearances in the 1932–3 season, Otto performed for the last time as Kaiser in Goethe’s Faust at the end of May. He refused offers from the Vienna and Zurich theaters, because he did not wish to give in to oppressive Nazis. Instead, he went underground, until in mid-November he was arrested by Nazi storm troopers (SA) in a small café on Viktoria-Luise-Platz. In SA and Gestapo headquarters, he was beaten until unconscious, then thrown from the building onto the street. He died in a Berlin hospital on November 23.³⁰\n\nThe young, handsome, and hugely popular Hans Otto was a typical representative of the Weimar culture the Nazis wanted to destroy. He had starred in classical plays as much as in Weimar-era pieces, such as dramas by Wedekind or Strindberg. But he was also a Communist functionary. Jan Petersen, too, was a Communist, and a journalist working out of Berlin. Lucky enough not to be caught by the Nazi regime, he wrote a book detailing Berlin proletarian life during the last phase of the Weimar Republic, in which the Nazis were not spared. Having baked the manuscript pages into a cake, he disguised himself as a ski tourist, this way smuggling them across the border with Czechoslovakia during Christmas 1934. As the book could be published abroad, Petersen himself escaped to Britain, via Switzerland, in the mid-1930s.³¹\n\nAnother Communist actor, thirty-two-year-old Wolfgang Langhoff from Düsseldorf, spent most of 1933 in the concentration camps Papenburg-Börgermoor and Lichtenburg. In Papenburg he wrote the words for the swamp-soldier song, which, with its defiant refrain, would be proudly adopted by many future inmates: We are the moor soldiers/Marching with our spades into the moors. Released early in 1934, Langhoff fled to Switzerland, where he, the young man with the knocked-out teeth, as Thomas Mann noted, met with the writer’s family in a transitory refuge.³²\n\nOther, formerly well-known Weimar-era artists made it out of the Third Reich more easily, as they were not on the political left. The conductor Erich Kleiber, for example, originally an Austrian and especially fond of music by Alban Berg, was impelled to leave the Reich in 1935. Kleiber’s anti-Nazi cachet was ambiguous. Previously, along with Wilhelm Furtwängler, he had aided Hermann Göring as a member of a Nazi film censorship board. During the Röhm Purge of June–July 1934, Kleiber was heard to express his hope, among a close circle of friends on the island of Sylt, that Hitler, the savior of Germany, had not been harmed. But as one of the avant-garde conductors of the Weimar Republic, Kleiber eventually had to make his home in Argentina.³³\n\nAnd then there were the suicides. Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, the painter born in 1880, had been influenced by Kandinsky and French neo-Impressionists. In 1905 he had co-founded the Dresden avant-garde movement Die Brücke, along with Erich Heckel and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff. The year 1911 found him in Berlin, where he indulged in street scenes, varieté and circus themes. Animated by the company he kept, especially prostitutes, he became addicted to morphine and eventually was drinking one liter of absinthe a day. Having volunteered in World War I, he suffered a nervous breakdown. He retired to a Davos sanatorium during the war, and after his release in 1917 he stayed in Switzerland. But the main market for his work remained in Germany, and Kirchner considered himself a German patriot. That the Nazis, upon their ascent to power, could not abide his paintings but dismissed them as degenerate, puzzled and annoyed him. We founded Die Brücke to encourage truly German art, made in Germany, and now it’s supposed to be un-German, was his complaint, but the Nazis included his works in their Degenerate Art exhibition in July 1937 and stripped him of his fellowship in the Prussian Academy of Arts. Living in a farmhouse near Davos, yet despairing on account of his substance addictions, the Nazis’ rejection, and what he saw as political turmoil in Germany after the Anschluss of Austria, Kirchner shot himself near his house in June 1938.³⁴\n\nAfter January 1933, Kirchner and his progressive artist consorts, irrespective of their political leanings, were viewed by most National Socialist politicians as proponents of a culture that had to be eradicated. More strongly even than in the last half of the Weimar Republic, those politicians associated the Modernist cultural currents that had burst forth after World War I with the German defeat, the prominence of Jews as creators or managers, left-wing or anarchic politics, and an aesthetic distortion of content and form. Twisted sexuality, derelict behavior, atonality, Nigger jazz, perverse dance routines, pimps and whores, images of cripples and beggars – all were manifestations of asphalt culture, touted as Dada, Cubism, Expressionism, or l’art pour l’art, charged their Nazi critics. This flotsam was the product of the big city rather than values organically linked to the countryside. Culture in Germany had become tainted by foreign influences and hence been rendered un-German. The individual had been more important than the community, a national community defined by its members’ purity of blood. Sick people and the demented do not belong on a stage, ranted Propaganda Minister Goebbels; Expressionism had to be fought because it attracted the shrill, the unharmonic and the ill – in the words of the art reviewer Karl Hans Bühner.³⁵\n\nMany measures taken by the Nazis against art and artists were spontaneously enforced by state-sanctioned paramilitary bands such as the storm trooper SA, the SS, or the army veterans’ association Stahlhelm, particularly early on in the regime. But other measures were based on legislation, such as the Reichstag Fire Decree of February 28, 1933, and the Enabling Act of March 23. Both had roots in Article 48, the emergency law of the Weimar Republic, which was technically still in place.³⁶ Special legislation regarding culture was also passed, such as the Schriftleitergesetz of October 4, 1933, an editors’ set of strangulating codes for regulating the press.³⁷ But the singularly most flexible and potentially most lethal piece of legislation for the new censors turned out to be the Law for the Reconstitution of the Civil Service, proclaimed on April 7, 1933. Its paragraph 4 stated that persons of dubious political persuasion who would not unequivocally back the new state could be dismissed from the state bureaucracy, with only three months’ pay. Paragraph 3 targeted Jews in the same manner, and paragraph 2 decreed that officials lacking the correct aptitude must be let go.³⁸ This law was immediately meant to eliminate civil servants with all their traditional rights of tenure, including pensions, and hence it was well suited to marginalize suspect artists employed by state institutions at all levels, be they municipal, regional, or national. Into this category fell opera singers, for instance at the Prussian State Opera in Berlin, or actors at the municipal theaters in Hamburg and Düsseldorf. But beyond the civil service, the law also came to be broadly used by non-government institutions, such as teachers’ associations or physicians’ leagues. In the realm of culture, therefore, any band of Nazis with an anti-Modernist bent was liable to refer to it in attempts to terminate unwanted colleagues.\n\nIn addition, expulsion from the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin, which had been a token of republican culture, was meant to signal shame for all its members, affecting all artistic disciplines. An early victim was Heinrich Mann, the head of the academy’s writers’ section, who was dismissed by President Max von Schillings on February 15.³⁹ A composer, von Schillings’s colleague Arnold Schoenberg, who had taught at the academy since 1925, followed in March, after Schillings had declared that the Jewish influence at the academy must be eliminated. Schoenberg and his small family had fled to Paris by May 17.⁴⁰ Also during May, the Jewish honorary academy president, Max Liebermann, declared his resignation from that post and his definitive retreat from the school. In a statement of justification, published by the press, Germany’s foremost Impressionist painter maintained that he had devoted his entire life to German art and that art had as little to do with politics as had lineage.⁴¹ By that time, in a process that would last for months and even years, Jewish, left-wing, or pronouncedly Modernist artists were either being dismissed outright or pressured, like the sculptor Ernst Barlach, to resign on their own volition.⁴² Only one of them protested in the course of her resignation. The esteemed novelist Ricarda Huch, politically more to the right of center but cherishing tolerance, let Schillings know that she rebuked several of the measures by the new government, including the current demand that academy fellows sign a declaration of loyalty to the regime. Huch was correct in assuming that her protest translated into an instant severance from the institution, as she retreated to her private home.⁴³\n\nTurning to individual artistic disciplines, from the German stage alone, not counting the film industry, 10 percent of all pre-1933 personnel were ousted during the first months of the Reich, and one-third of all directors, many of those Jews. In Munich, the entrepreneurial theater Intendant Otto Falckenberg, who had favored works by Brecht and other Modernists, was briefly incarcerated by the secret police, but then released.⁴⁴ Falckenberg had notoriously championed the genres that were now taboo: the Naturalism at the turn of the last century and, subsequently, Expressionism, which began before World War I. Dramas in those genres featured the psychology of individuals in their interpersonal, often conflicted, relations, rather than positivist dynamism in racially defined communal settings, preferred by the Nazis. Authors from the Naturalist school, whose works were now officially shunned (constituting almost one-half of the Weimar repertoire), included Hermann Sudermann, Arthur Schnitzler, Frank Wedekind, Walter Hasenclever, Ernst Toller, and Carl Zuckmayer.⁴⁵ Georg Kaiser, the most prolific Expressionist dramatist of the 1920s, was having his latest play Der Silbersee (The Silver Lake), a quasi-socialist object lesson, premiered simultaneously at three theaters in the Reich in late February 1933. In Magdeburg, to a score by Weill, the Communist Ernst Busch was singing and playing the leading role. Stahlhelm and NSDAP functionaries declared the performance forbidden, causing its untimely cancellation. Similar interruptions occurred in Erfurt and in Leipzig, where the Jewish composer Gustav Brecher had contributed the soundscape. Brecher later had to flee, killing himself in Belgian Ostend in 1940.⁴⁶\n\nMany German actors of the stage also played in films; indeed, similar prohibitions would affect the movie scene too. Hence actors who had been featured in typically Weimar-era films lost their jobs. One of these was the formerly much-beloved Hertha Thiele, who had played in the left-wing, Expressionist classic Kuhle Wampe (Who Owns the World?, 1932), co-written by Brecht and co-starring Busch. After she had refused to impersonate Erna Jänicke, the girlfriend of Nazi hero Horst Wessel, who had been murdered by the Red Front in 1930, she lost her certification as a German actress and eventually left for Switzerland. Apart from Kuhle Wampe, many other films produced during the Weimar Republic were proscribed, because of unacceptable themes or styles, or because leading actors were Jewish. The half-Jewish director Fritz Lang’s Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse (1933), for instance, appeared as too Expressionist, quite apart from the murky racial pedigree of Lang himself. Several special laws aiming for prohibition were passed after January 1933, the most important being the one of February 16, 1934, when an all-inclusive censorship decree was promulgated.⁴⁷\n\nIn a culture setting where, on a scale of one to ten, Richard Wagner occupied a ten and jazz and atonal music a one, much German traditional music was able to survive under the Nazis, while most modern works were cast aside. Characteristically, the Nazis condemned truly atonal compositions such as those by Schoenberg and his pupil Alban Berg, but in addition they made the convenient mistake of conflating atonality with any form of cacophony, which for them included not only jazz but also modern if not yet dodecaphonic pieces, for instance those by Hindemith or Hermann Reutter. Of Reutter, Goebbels said as late as January 1938 that he would oppose his candidacy, as an atonalist, for a position at Frankfurt’s conservatory, for which Reich Education Minister Bernhard Rust had earmarked him. (Here the conflict between two Nazi ministers was typical of the heterogeneity of Third Reich gubernatorial structures; in the culture domain, Goebbels usually won out: a strange constellation of competencies in Hitler’s model of government, which will deserve another, closer, look in Chapter 2.)⁴⁸ As far as Berg was concerned, his opera Wozzeck was rejected for its atonality; beyond that, its social message, reflecting post-World War I humanitarian impulses, was disdained by the Nazis. So was Berg’s opera Lulu, featuring a harlot, over the Berlin premiere of which the Modernist Erich Kleiber, not originally anti-Nazi, was impelled to leave Germany. Under this pressure other musicians also left, while some, after having been fired from an opera stage or symphony orchestra pit, tried to make do in other jobs. Among the former were Hindemith and Vladimir Vogel, a Modernist but not atonalist, yet branded as such; Berg, always an Aryan Vienna resident, died there on Christmas Eve 1935 after a lethal bee-sting infection.⁴⁹\n\nOne last Weimar-style performance of opera took place at the Berlin Staatsoper on February 12, 1933, after having been rehearsed months before. Its avant-garde creators were Jürgen Fehling, the stage director, and Otto Klemperer, the conductor; Oskar Strnad was the stage designer. This partially surreal interpretation of Wagner’s Tannhäuser was meant as an anti-Bayreuth demonstration, opposing a style that Wagner’s dowdy son Siegfried had still championed and traditionalist-leaning Nazis favored. Klemperer and Strnad were Jewish, and both of them left the Reich – Klemperer for the United States and Strnad for his native Austria, where he died in 1935. Fehling, however, remained in Berlin, entering into a tenuous relationship with the regime.⁵⁰\n\nAs before, much music was transmitted over the broadcasting system, the structure of which was now changed and its contents modified. Radio had been an instrument of propaganda the Nazis had not fully realized before January 1933, for two reasons. First, Hitler had limited opportunities for public speaking after his Landsberg imprisonment in 1924; as such it was a privilege extended to him depending on the presence or absence of censorship exercised by individual German states. This was not conducive to broadcasting. Second, the idea of radio was intimately connected to the era of the Weimar Republic during which it was created, making propaganda mavens of the Nazi Party like Goebbels suspicious and wary.⁵¹\n\nThat changed after the Nazis’ rise to power. In a speech on August 18, 1933, Goebbels suggested to his followers that radio was a superb instrument of political control and henceforth was to be neatly accommodated to the Nazi Führer principle. In its current shape it had to be cleansed of the effect of abuses by its former staff, such as corruption, a sinecurial infestation, and bloated salaries – quite apart from any changes to its thematic content.⁵² The purge of Weimar radio personnel now getting under way targeted leading broadcast officials, among them the Intendanten of almost all local stations of the former nationwide Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft (RRG). Several of them, after losing their positions, were put on trial, as was the founder of German broadcasting Hans Bredow; some committed suicide.⁵³ Ernst Hardt, the chief of Westdeutscher Rundfunk in Cologne, had had prior experience as Intendant of the Nationaltheater Weimar and, like many of the others, was a staunch Social Democrat. Although his Cologne imprisonment lasted only a few days, he emerged from it impoverished, seeking refuge with his married daughter in Berlin.⁵⁴\n\nParallel to the purging of radio personnel, Goebbels, who officially oversaw all aspects of broadcasting following his appointment to the propaganda portfolio by Hitler in March 1933, initiated changes to the programming. As a first step, elements of modernity, such as Nigger jazz, were scheduled for elimination. Music by Jewish or even half-Jewish composers fell into this category, as did some foreign compositions. By contrast, music by German composers was supposed to be stressed. In this context, Beethoven’s works were regarded as a strong antidote to the sport of dissonance, the incest of harmony and the chaos of form.⁵⁵\n\nA combination of spontaneous paramilitary enforcement and statutory regulation also caused changes in the situation of the press. First targeted were the left-oriented newspapers, such as the Social Democratic Vorwärts and the Communist Party’s Rote Fahne. An emergency law of February 4, 1933, added a legalistic veneer to sudden outbreaks of violence, so that by March all leftist broadsheets had been effectively stopped.⁵⁶ Subsequently, many middle-of-the-road bourgeois papers also became victims of the regime in short order, as did confessional ones. If they were not forbidden outright, they were amalgamated or repossessed. And so, where there had been over 3,000 newspapers in Germany by January 1933, there were only some 2,000 four years later. In many cases, apart from the firing or incarceration of old newspaper personnel, buildings and other assets were confiscated or acquired by Party businesses for nominal sums. As for the staff, beyond the emergency decrees of spring and early summer, on October 4 the new editors’ law (Schriftleitergesetz) was promulgated, whose paragraph 5 outlined criteria for sackings. Besides non-Aryan lineage, those deficiencies of journalists were mentioned that were apt to prevent a spiritual guidance for the public. Such perceived shortcomings would provide ideological or – in the case of culture – aesthetic reasons for dismissal.⁵⁷\n\nA few case histories reveal the proportions of institutional upheaval and human suffering. The SA stormed the headquarters of the Social Democratic Münchener Post, wreaked havoc in the halls, and arrested those not able to flee. The Catholic weekly Der gerade Weg, also in Munich, with a history of pre-1933 opposition to the Nazis, was overrun and Franz Gerlich, its chief editor, manhandled on the spot; he was later murdered in Dachau. The high-bourgeois Frankfurter Zeitung meanwhile, a mainstay of liberal-conservative opinion in the Weimar Republic and famous for its feuilleton section, was visited by policemen as early as March 31, 1933, who arrested some of the editors. The result was that the (at that time still Jewish) owners were cowed into submission, and the paper was remodeled into a showpiece Nazi medium. And the Neue Badische Landeszeitung in Mannheim was prohibited on March 1, 1934, presumably after it had been discredited as anti-regime by a Nazi insider. Its chief editor Heinrich Rumpf tried to work in a lending library for a while, but then committed suicide.⁵⁸\n\nDifferent conditions than for radio and the press obtained for other arts, because here creators were individually more independent. In architecture, for example, only architects employed by institutions could be dismissed, from the bureaucracy, teaching, and state or regime-beholden firms. Self-employed ones relied on their order books for income and could stay in Germany, unless harm could come to them as Jews or political leftists. As far as architectural style was concerned, as yet no Nazi consensus appeared to evolve, and therefore no systematic discrimination, on that account.\n\nNevertheless, there is no question that after January 1933 the Weimar-republican architectural Bauhaus style, initiated by Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius in Dessau, was out of favor. Gropius and other associates of the vaunted Ring architects, such as Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, were officially marginalized. The so-called New Objectivity constructed smooth façades and empty walls, explained the culture bureaucrat Otto von Kursell in 1933.⁵⁹ As part of that movement, the Bauhaus was accused of preferring a flat roof over a peaked one such as traditional German houses possessed, which was judged technically awkward and aesthetically unpleasant; Bauhaus style tended to emphasize horizontal lines instead of Gothic, vertical ones. Rather than German, it was Bolshevist art and fully in keeping with Weimar’s asphalt culture.⁶⁰ By and large, Nazi ideologues wanted to return to the historicist traditions of pre-war architecture, with emphasis on a rural rather than urban character.⁶¹\n\nNot least in order to purge unwanted colleagues, including several of the Ring such as Gropius’s friend Erich Mendelsohn, the Verband Deutscher Architekten (VDA), the republican near-monopoly association of German architects, was infiltrated by a Nazi group close to former architect Alfred Rosenberg and, later in 1933, was integrated into Goebbels’s newly founded Reichskulturkammer (RKK, Reich Culture Chamber).⁶² In April 1933 the Berlin remnants of the original Weimar Bauhaus fell victim to Nazi censors; the school was closed after decisive action by the chief Party ideologue Rosenberg, a pompous obscurantist. Bauhaus-influenced architects lost their positions: Ernst Wichert at the Frankfurt School of Arts and Crafts, Hans Scharoun and Adolf Rading, designers of some of the most radical housing developments built during the Weimar Republic, both at Breslau’s Academy of Arts. Hans Poelzig was driven from an architectural school in Berlin, and Robert Vorhoelzer from the Technische Hochschule in Munich. But most lesser disciples of the Bauhaus were retained in state-administrative or teaching positions, as they were able to adapt themselves to the regime’s own requirements. Heavily marked by the Bauhaus aura, both Gropius and his successor Mies van der Rohe tried to get by as self-employed consultants. They offered their services to exhibitions sponsored by the regime, Gropius even designing swastika-flagged sites for an event in 1934, clearly pandering to the Nazi regime. Later that year, however, he had found it too difficult financially and decided to move to Britain, hoping for better times. But even after he had arrived at Harvard University in 1937 he insisted that he was not there as an immigrant, but for serving German culture. Mies van der Rohe, after similar disappointing experiences in Germany, followed Gropius to the United States in 1938, while their mentor Peter Behrens remained in the service of the Third Reich.⁶³\n\nFor the Nazis, painting and sculpture constituted a much more contentious issue than architecture, for the latter always served practical purposes, no matter the design. Avant-garde pictorial art of the post-World War I era was placed in disrepute by critics believing in Rosenberg or Goebbels, whose remarks were made to concur with"
