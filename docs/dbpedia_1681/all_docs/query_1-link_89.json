        "text": "Rapper Fabolous isn’t living up to his name, a Brooklyn music publisher claims in a lawsuit alleging his riffs are a rip-off.\n\nCarla Boone, who set up an independent recording label five years ago, says Fabolous’ 2001 hit album, “Ghetto Fabolous,” contained a song “strikingly similar” to one written earlier by two of her songwriters who worked together as Trajik.\n\nTrajik’s 1999 song “Holla’ Back” feature a chorus in which the words “holla back” are repeated over and over, the lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court claims.\n\nThe song on “Ghetto Fabolous” that Boone claims breaches Trajik’s copyright is entitled “Young N (Holla Back),” which has a chorus that also uses the words “holla back.”\n\nBoone claims she gave the Trajik CD to several music promoters and executives who work with Fabolous and his producers, Pharrell Williams and Charles Hugo.\n\nShe is suing for unspecified damages against Fabolous, who’s real name is John Jackson, his producers and several music-industry companies, including Elektra Entertainment, EMI April Music and Warner Music Group.\n\nElektra lawyer Michael Pollack said he could not comment until examining the lawsuit."
