        "text": "The-Dream hit the music scene in the early 2000s as a songwriter for artists such as Britney Spears, B2K, and Rihanna. In 2007, he landed a recording contract and started using his pen for his discography.\n\nOver the last two decades, The-Dream has become one of the most sought-out songwriters for some of the biggest names in R&B and hip-hop. Whether it's a catchy hook, memorable ad-libs, or an impeccable bridge that drives the song home, The-Dream knows how to bring the best out of any artist. It's no wonder he's self-proclaimed as the \"Radio Killa.\" Here are 20 songs penned by The-Dream to celebrate his illustrious songwriting career.\n\n1 of 20\n\n“Umbrella” by Rihanna featuring Jay-Z\n\nChris Polk/FilmMagic\n\nBy the time Rihanna released her third album, Good Girl Gone Bad, in 2007, she had elevated her image and sound. She worked with The-Dream on a few of the album tracks, including lead single “Umbrella.” Lyrically, the track is about a person supporting and comforting their partner during good and bad times. The “umbrella” is a metaphor for being covered.\n\n2 of 20\n\n“Baby” by Justin Bieber featuring Ludacris\n\nDimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for The Met Museum/Vogue\n\nIn 2010, Justin Bieber released his debut album, My World 2.0, led by his smash single “Baby.” The song tells the story of a teenage boy who went through a breakup but still wants to be with his partner. The song became a top-five hit on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n3 of 20\n\n“Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" by Beyoncé\n\nRay Tamarra/Getty Images\n\nIn 2008, Beyoncé released her third solo album, I Am… Sasha Fierce. The album garnered a whopping nine singles, including the smash, “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It).” It was an anthem for women celebrating their single status, as she sang about breaking up with her man and enjoying life on her own. “Single Ladies” won Song of the Year, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, and Best R&B Song at the 52nd Grammys.\n\n4 of 20\n\n“Ride” by Ciara featuring Ludacris\n\nKevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nIn 2010, Ciara released her fourth studio album, Basic Instinct, which spawned lead single “Ride.” The-Dream teamed up with frequent collaborator Tricky Stewart on the penning and production of “Ride,” a sensual and seductive track that could easily be about riding a beat or riding during intimacy.\n\n5 of 20\n\n“Bed” by J. Holiday\n\nBen Rose/WireImage\n\nR&B singer J. Holiday debuted on the music scene in 2007 with his album Back of My Lac'. The album’s breakout single, “Bed,” helped introduce Holiday as a new voice in R&B. It’s a seductive track about fulfilling sexual desires, which is evident from the first verse as Holiday sings, “Girl, change into that Victoria’s Secret thing that I like / Alright, okay, tonight you’re having me your way.”\n\n6 of 20\n\n“Love on Top” by Beyoncé\n\nKevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nBeyoncé elevates her sound and shows appreciation to artists who paved the way. This was evident when she teamed up with The-Dream on her 2011 single, “Love On Top.” While the production was reminiscent of ‘80s R&B, the song is about being so enamored with the love of your life despite relationships being hard at times.\n\n7 of 20\n\n“Obsessed” by Mariah Carey\n\nGeorge Pimentel/WireImage\n\nIn 2008, Mariah Carey released her 12th album, Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel. Carey worked with Tricky Stewart and The-Dream on the album’s lead single, “Obsessed.” Carey was tired of people telling lies about her relationship status, so the single was about identifying people constantly worrying about who she dates.\n\n8 of 20\n\n“Just Like Me” by Jamie Foxx featuring T.I.\n\nParas Griffin/VMN18/Getty Images for BET\n\nIn 2008, Jamie Foxx released his third album, Intuition, led by the single, “Just Like Me.” The song is about a man finding out about his partner’s infidelities, even though he was the one cheating first. He stresses how he and his partner are very similar since they both stepped out on the relationship.\n\n9 of 20\n\n“You” by Chris Brown\n\nAllen Berezovsky/WireImage\n\nAfter the success of Chris Brown’s self-titled debut album in 2006, he released his sophomore album, Exclusive, the following year. Brown joined forces with The-Dream on one of the album's standout tracks, “You.” The song finds Chris singing about not being over how his girl broke up with him, and wants to get her back.\n\n10 of 20\n\n“Throw It In The Bag” by Fabolous featuring The-Dream\n\nJohnny Nunez/WireImage\n\nIn 2009, Fabolous released his third album, Loso’s Way, which was led by “Throw It In The Bag.” The song is about a person spending money on whatever they want and not caring about the price tag. The song reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot Rap songs.\n\n11 of 20\n\n“Hard” by Rihanna featuring Jeezy\n\nSamir Hussein/WireImage\n\nIn 2009, Rihanna released her fourth album, Rated R. She worked with The-Dream and Tricky Stewart on the album’s second single, “Hard.” Joined by Jeezy, the track has Rihanna being confident in who she is and combating any haters against her success.\n\n12 of 20\n\n“I Luv Your Girl” by The-Dream\n\nDaniel Zuchnik/Getty Images\n\nThe-Dream came onto the scene in 2007 with Love/Hate. The album’s third single, “I Luv Your Girl,” was produced by frequent collaborator Tricky Stewart. It tells the story of a guy eyeing a girl in the club while making her man jealous. In the third verse, he sings, “Usually you won’t see me hate on another dude / But my heart got me up in here willing to separate you from ya boo.”\n\n13 of 20\n\n“Just Fine” by Mary J. Blige\n\nBennett Raglin/Getty Images for ESSENCE\n\nMary J. Blige has worked with a number of songwriters and producers throughout her career. Her 2007 album Growing Pains garnered three singles, including “Just Fine,” the lead track. While Blige is notorious for singing about relationship woes and life struggles, “Just Fine” brought more positivity. She relays winning in life and doing what she wants to do.\n\n14 of 20\n\n“Leavin'” by Jesse McCartney\n\nTheo Wargo/Getty Images\n\nAlthough The-Dream is known for penning songs for R&B and hip-hop artists, he’s also written hit records for pop artists. In 2008, he worked with Jesse McCartney on “Leavin.’” Jesse is interested in a woman who already has a boyfriend, but he wants to be her partner instead.\n\n15 of 20\n\n“No Church in the Wild” by Jay-Z and Kanye West featuring Frank Ocean and The-Dream\n\nKyle Gustafson/For The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nIn 2011, Jay-Z and Kanye West released their collaborative album Watch the Throne. It garnered seven singles, including \"No Church in the Wild.\" The two rappers teamed up with The-Dream and Frank Ocean. The song reflects themes of religious faith, morals, and honor.\n\n16 of 20\n\n“Flawless” by Beyoncé\n\nKarwai Tang/WireImage\n\nThe working relationship between The-Dream and Beyoncé continuously produces magic. In Queen Bey’s single “Flawless,” she highlights the importance of having self-confidence and self-love. It's no wonder she had fans singing her popular phrase, “I woke up like this!”\n\n17 of 20\n\n“Trading Places” by Usher\n\nDerek White/Getty Images for Strength Of A Woman Festival & Summit\n\nIn 2008, Usher released his eighth studio album, Here I Stand. Penned by The-Dream, \"Trading Places,” the album's final single, highlights role reversal in a relationship. Usher wants his partner to reciprocate the same love and appreciation.\n\n18 of 20\n\n“Shawty Is a 10” by The-Dream\n\nIlya S. Savenok/Getty Images for Genius\n\nThe world was introduced to The-Dream in 2007 with “Shawty Is a 10.” It proves to be one of his more simple songs lyrically. The single has The-Dream describing a girl he once knew at a younger age and how she's beautifully blossomed as an adult.\n\n19 of 20\n\n\"Fashion Killa\" by A$AP Rocky\n\nJoseph Okpako/WireImage\n\nIn 2013, A$AP Rocky released his debut album Long.
