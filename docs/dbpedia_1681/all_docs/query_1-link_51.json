        "text": "Fabolous x Chris Brown x Velous, “Flipmode”\n\nWith cameos from DJ Khaled, Blake Griffin, T.I., Lala Anthony, Draya and more, Fabulous turned his remix of the famous 2001 Nike “Free Style” basketball commercial into quite the star-studded affair, with the help of Chris Brown and Velous.\n\nG-Herbo, “Man Now”\n\nDuring “Man Now,” which appears on G-Herbo’s recently released debut album, Humble Beast, the 22-year-old reflects on his past life and his glo-up. With the video’s setting taking him to a stunningly beautiful beach in Jamaica, the scenery doubles as a stark reminder he’s come a long way from his childhood growing up in a poverty-stricken neighborhood.\n\nMajid Jordan, “Body Talk”\n\nThe duo, who recently released their sophomore album, gave their song “Body Talk” the official music video treatment, with the neon-colored visual incorporating lasers and bright lights and making for quite the electrifying display of self-expression.\n\nRich The Kid, “New Freezer” ft. Kendrick Lamar\n\nRich The Kid, who is looking to make his debut on Interscope Records before the year concludes, was blessed with a collaboration with Kendrick Lamar, with the music video for their previously-released track “New Freezer” incorporating luxury vehicles, beautiful women, Chinese take-out and futuristic edits. Ah, the good life.\n\nBig Boi, “In The South” ft. Pimp C, Gucci Mane\n\nBig Boi’s latest visual, accompanying his track “In The South,” features cartoon versions of the OutKast rapper riding in a convertible alongside Gucci Mane and Pimp C (R.I.P.), explaining that going the animated route was “a cool fun way to showcase all of us together and imagine what it would like like.”\n\nHi-Tone, “Mr. Miyagi”\n\nHi-Tone, an emerging hip-hop artist and established tattoo artist from California, chose to go the Halloween route for his latest visual, nodding nostalgically (and comedically) to the character Mr. Miyagi, from the beloved classic film, Karate Kid."
