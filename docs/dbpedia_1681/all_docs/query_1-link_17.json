From singing to songwriting, he’s written for major artists Chris Brown and Teyana Taylor and and has worked with artists including Jeremih, Safaree, Kevin Gates, Murda Beats, C-Sick, Fabolous and more. Josh K’s new album “Life is Life’ing” is fresh off his departure from Fabolous label The Family Music Group and has re emerged as an independent artist with a lot to sing about.\n\nHis refreshed sound for his second album “Life is Life’ing” has garnered the attention of the industry after his recent listening session in Chicago that was hosted by WGCI’s Midday Show host Tone Kapone. Released on October 10th, “Life Is Life’ing” includes features from Chanelle Tru, Mano, TCF Live, and Jae Haze. The project is executive produced by Isaiah Akeem Campbell better known as Pyro The Spaceboy (Timbaland’s Beat Club). Producers for the album include Grammy award winning producer Mano, writer/producer Kajun, and writer RJ Collins.\n\nWith close to 10k streams in the first week, stand out tracks such as Lick Back, Soul Ties, BYGMFU ft Mano and Talk to Me display Josh K’s talent and ability to set new trends in the R&B space. The non-stop 17-track album is a snapshot into Josh K’s thoughts and his experiences of “Life.”\n\nListen to Josh K New Album “Life is Life’ing” Apple Music & Spotify\n\nIG: @thesingerjoshk\n\nMedia Inquiries regarding Josh K please contact Briahna Gatlin: B.gatlin@swankpublishing.com"
