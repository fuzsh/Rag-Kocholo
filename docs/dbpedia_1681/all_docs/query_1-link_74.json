        "text": "Tyler Bryant, better known as his stage name Velous, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer from Kingston, New York. He is mostly known for co-writing Chris Brown and Drake's \"No Guidance\" which received a Grammy nomination for Best R&B song, and is currently 8x platinum. Velous is also known for co-producing Kanye West's hit single \"All Day\", which was Platinum-certified in the US and subsequently procured a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Song. In 2016, Velous wrote and produced \"Flipmode.\" In 2017, \"Flipmode\" became a single on Fabolous' Summertime Shootout 3 and served as Velous' debut feature. “When I heard the track it was a ... vibe, so I knew I wanted to become a part of the song. Chris added his touch while we were on tour together and the rest is history,” said Fabolous.\n\nEarly life\n\nTyler Bryant was born in Kingston, New York. His father, deceased, was a musician. His mother was a singer. When he was eleven, he began rapping after listening to Kanye West's \"Through the Wire\". He learned how to play the drums, then piano, and started playing the guitar when he was twelve years old. He started getting into production when he was thirteen. He was also in a jazz ensemble in high school.\n\nCareer\n\nVelous came up with his name after someone told him how marvelous his production skills were; the name is \"marvelous\" minus the \"mar\". In 2011, he released his debut mixtape, Velocity The Mixtape. The release helped Velous gain attention from Cus Maven, who signed him to Swanky Music Group. Velous met Fabolous through fellow producer Vinylz. The trio worked together for Fabolous' song \"Gone For The Winter\" from his sixth album, The Young OG Project in 2014. The song also marked Velous' first major guest appearance as a recording artist.\n\nIn 2014, fellow New York artist French Montana signed Velous to his label, Coke Boys Records. Montana spoke about Velous in an interview with the Village Voice: \"I love his style. He sings. He raps. He's everything in one.\" He revealed that Velous also impressed Kanye West. \"He came to the studio and played me like 1,000 songs\", he said, before adding that Kanye West picked \"like two beats\" from Velous.\n\nDiscography\n\nSingles\n\nTitle Year Artist(s) Album Flipmode 2017 Velous Non-album single Flipmode Remix 2017 Velous, Fabolous, Chris Brown Non-album single Cliche 2017 Velous Non-album single Dropdown 2018 Velous Non-album single Juiced Up 2018 Velous, Nav Non-album single\n\nFeatures\n\nTitle Year Artist(s) Album Adult Swim 2014 DJ Spinking, Tyga, Jeremih, Velous Non-album single Gone for the Winter 2014 Fabolous, Velous The Young OG Project Proud Side ... 2015 DJ Spinking, Ty Dolla $ign, Velous Non-album single\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nYear Award Category Nominated Work Result 2015 Grammy Awards Best Rap Song All Day (Kanye West) Nominated 2019 Grammy Awards Best R&B Song No Guidance (Chris Brown ft.
