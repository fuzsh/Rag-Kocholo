        "text": "After 10 studio albums, DJ Khaled’s larger-than-life optimism is as prominent as his platinum-selling catalog.\n\nThe turntable phenomenon is one of the sharpest businessmen in the industry, and has maintained consistent club bangers for over a decade. His latest album, Grateful, peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and was executive produced by his 9-month-old bouncing baby boy, Asahd Khaled. The little lion’s tuneful ear activates the airwaves while extending his father’s legacy of major keys. The Khaled’s A-list reign intensified after the release of “I’m The One” — making this platinum success DJ Khaled’s first-ever No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hit.\n\nHip-hop’s latest royal family rises with enigmatic humility, their We The Best/Epic records blare in the most sought out venues, globally. DJ Khaled’s ceaseless work ethic has stapled his entrepreneurship and musicality alongside legends. Always evolving, Grateful is already certified gold and even contains a songwriter credit from the idol, Berry Gordy. And, as the star on top of the stars, DJ Khaled makes the masses get on their feet for memorable impeccable features.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nBefore he takes the stage at the Billboard Hot 100 music festival on Sunday, Aug. 20, press play and dance along to the greatness that is DJ Khaled.\n\n“Shining,” feat. JAY-Z & Beyonce\n\nDJ Khaled premiered his most legend-packed record to date following this year’s biggest night in music, alongside power couple JAY-Z and Beyonce. The feel-good Grammy Awards anthem, “Shining,” kicked-off what would later become his and JAY-Z’s best radio debut. The notoriously private Carters knighted DJ Khaled with an honorable mention and JAY-Z’s glittering enthusiasm over his (then) soon-to-be born twins dazzled. The powerful record soared to No. 1 on Billboard’s Rhythmic chart.\n\n“I’m the One,” feat. Chance the Rapper, Lil Wayne, Quavo & Justin Bieber\n\nMajor bag alert! The hip-shaking melody of “I’m The One” went hand-in-hand with its blissfully colorful music shoot. With #FanLuv at an all-time high, DJ Khaled created a voluptuous vision flashy enough to leave the Playboy mansion staff green with envy. Quavo, Chance the Rapper and Lil Wayne laced the Grateful single with rhymes. However, Justin Bieber’s foot-tapping chorus was what really helped make this DJ Khaled’s most successful song yet — scoring his introductory Billboard Hot 100 No. 1.\n\n“We Takin’ Over,” feat. Lil Wayne, T.I., Fat Joe, Birdman and Akon\n\nThe natural high of this hip-hop hymn took over the radio and served as a redefining moment in DJ Khaled’s career. In company with Lil Wayne, T.I., Fat Joe, Birdman, Rick Ross, and Akon, the animated music mogul bullied the beat and TV screens. Paying homage to The Notorious B.I.G., Rick Ross and DJ Khaled re-enacted P. Diddy’s (1997) high-speed “Hypnotize” reverse chase. Ross rapped “I’m big like Diddy; damn it, I’m with it. Khaled, we did it, Biggie of my city,” on the record. Yet, Akon’s quotable vocals made us all sing off-key, in one city at a time.\n\n“Wild Thoughts,” feat. Rihanna & Bryson Tiller\n\nSummer 2017 was lead by the seductress Rihanna, Bryson Tiller and the infamous “another one,” DJ Khaled ad-lib. This nostalgic groove is bound to make you try to salsa. Carlos Santana’s and Wyclef Jean’s infectious classic, “Maria Maria,” was reintroduced with a millennial-friendly eclectic visual. In the end, this generational rock/rap fusion proved to be one of the greatest thus far.\n\n“They Don’t Love You No More,” feat. JAY-Z, Meek Mill, French Montana & Rick Ross\n\nMeek Mill begins thundering over the bass-filled earworm. And, hearing the rhythm hit makes us want to stand on couches and chin-check a hater from a VIP section. This mantra ditty became the beginning of DJ Khaled’s viral “they” warnings, and cloth talk — as he and Rick Ross play golf from the top of a Maybach, and Rolls-Royce. The visual of infinite stunts is impeccably fueled by French Montana’s sway-worthy chorus. Still, JAY-Z lyrically showing MC’s his receipts forged this wax as one of DJ Khaled’s best-to-date.\n\n“I Got the Keys,” feat. JAY-Z & Future\n\nWraith talk and jewelry jingling were the ultimate premier perks on DJ Khaled’s “I Got The Keys,” following the 2016 BET Awards. Hov gemmed up on his get-money verses, while the Freebandz leader, Future assisted with the catchy chorus. DJ Khaled’s internet influence of “major keys” advanced the track’s platinum success — even pushing him towards his first #1 album. The cameo-filled video depicts JAY-Z opposing authorities with men-at-arms, including Fabolous, 2 Chainz, A$AP Ferg, Swizz Beatz, Bryson Tiller and Busta Rhymes.\n\n“I’m On One,” feat. Drake, Rick Ross & Lil Wayne\n\nThe YMCMB, We The Best, MMG king like collaboration made fans “get ‘em up.” Drake fused his bars with silky smooth vocals — while we all repeated how we were “on one.” Lil Wayne cemented the tunes’ angle with the catchphrase, “I walk around the club, f–k everybody.” The jam reigned on the R&B/Hip-Hop Tracks chart for 11 weeks, launching the turntablist towards mainstream stardom. DJ Khaled solidified his first hit on the top ten of the Hot 100 with this release.\n\n“All I Do Is Win,” feat. Snoop Dogg, Rick Ross, Ludacris & T-Pain\n\nThis hip-hop chant will be immortalized by winners of all sorts, and unlucky sports teams alike. T-Pain passionately sings, “All I do is win, win, win, no matter what,” while Snoop Dogg, Rick Ross, and Ludacris chimed in with celebratory bars. The excitement around this record is unforgettable, and its video included some fire appearances from Nicki Minaj, P. Diddy, Jadakiss, and more. Love it or hate it, you were forced to learn the words — and DJ Khaled’s renowned motto went three times platinum.\n\n“I’m So Hood,” feat. Trick Daddy, Plies, Rick Ross and T-Pain\n\nWith his Terror Squad chain swinging, and his chevy ridin’ high, DJ Khaled’s hard body 2007 number, “I’m So Hood,” made heads nod. The southern street poetic remained true to his Miami roots and was backed by fellow Floridians, Trick Daddy, Plies, Rick Ross and T-Pain. Produced alongside The Runners, DJ Khaled and T-Pain aggressively shouted, “I’m out the hood. And if you feel me put your hands up. HOO-OOD! My hood n—-s, can you stand up?” Don’t ever play yourself, his hip-hop wizardry has made us get busy since it was okay to wear stunner shades.\n\n“No New Friends,” feat. Drake, Lil Wayne and Rick Ross\n\nHe was Suffering From Success while swerving through the fast lane with Cash Money Records. “No New Friends,” represents the simpler times within that empire — you know, no Birdman drama. The camaraderie between Drake, Lil Wayne, and Rick Ross is an ode to the loyalty DJ Khaled is well-known for within the business. The world proudly recited these rappers’ one-two punch lines with their day-one friends under an arm. DJ Khaled’s fan-favorite in time turned into a throwback Bad Boy-like reboot. The video includes Champagne Papi getting his back rubbed in a hot tub, Rozay spittin’ under helicopters, never-ending women, and pure gleaming luxury."
