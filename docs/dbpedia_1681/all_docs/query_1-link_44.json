        "text": "London singer-songwriter Raye hooked me with this catchy song about getting an ex back (something I'm not interested in personally, but I love that journey for her!). Shout-out to my golden-eared colleague Zareen for putting this one on my radar. It's a slapper.\n\nPicture it: I'm at home, minding my own business while watching Rihanna's Savage x Fenty runway show on Amazon. I go to the kitchen to refill my wine glass when I hear the first few notes of this song — a song that was originally released in 2010 and quickly became \"my jam\" — being performed by Fabolous in the year of our lord Beyoncé, 2019.\n\nI literally yelled \"Wait a minute, b*tch!\" to nobody in particular as I ran back into the room and turned up the volume, high. When this song first came out, you guys? You couldn't tell me nothing! And you still can't! I've been bopping to this ever since. Thank you for bringing it back, Rihanna; you're the real MVP.\n\nThe debut solo album from Alabama Shakes frontwoman (and fellow Libra) Brittany Howard is, in a word, genius. The powerhouse vocalist gets real and raw about romance, racism, and the radicalism that is being a queer black woman in America on Jaime, which is named for the sister Howard lost when she was 8 years old.\n\nStandout track: \"Stay High,\" because it's such a charming, wintery love song about smoking weed, and I love the groovy lyrics paired with the twinkly sounds of a xylophone.\n\nListen now on Spotify."
