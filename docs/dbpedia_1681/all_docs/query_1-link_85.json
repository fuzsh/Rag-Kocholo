        "text": "During a recent interview, Fabolous recalled a time when Beyonce addressed the Brooklyn rapper regarding a bar that he had rapped about the “Spirit” singer and her sister, Solange.\n\n“It was like a rap. I said something. It was a mixtape, freestyle, or something. and I said, ‘If you could have Beyonce would you take Solange?'” Fabolous explained. “Beyonce was like, ‘yo, let me holla at you.’ So I went over there and hollered at her.”\n\n“She was just telling me that they rock with me. I really didn’t even think when I was saying it. I just didn’t connect to it like that. You say a lot of things in punch lines and freestyles. You try to be catchy and metaphoric,” Fab continued.\n\n“I didn’t see the deeper side of it. I said you know what, ‘I get it.’ And I told her that when I see Solange I’m going to apologize to her.”\n\n“I didn’t mean any malice but I do take responsibility,” Fabolous said before sharing what happened when he actually apologized to Solange. “Solange, she was stiff. She was like ‘What up?'” Fab explained that Solange wasn’t really into his apology. The song that Fabolous was referring to is “For the Money” ft. Nicki Minaj.
