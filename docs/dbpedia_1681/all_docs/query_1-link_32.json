        "text": "BROKEN BELLS\n\n“Broken Bells”\n\n(Columbia)\n\nA two-man supergroup, Broken Bells is the partnership of James Mercer, the songwriter and lead singer from the Shins, and Danger Mouse (Brian Burton), the producer who’s also half of Gnarls Barkley. Both of them are scholars of retro pop, and their collaboration reinforces that tendency all too strongly. “Broken Bells” is couched in all the gamesmanship two smart hipsters can share. It’s clever, purposeful, circumscribed and ultimately aloof, bundling grim sentiments in the comforts of yesteryear. Overdubbing perfect Beach Boys harmonies, Mr. Mercer sings, “Run and hide your head is on fire/Whirling masses rolling ashes”; that song, “Your Head Is on Fire,” also warns, “You’ll never know/How low an angry heart can go.”\n\nBut anger is muted in the sound of these songs. So is nearly any other overt emotion except pride in craftsmanship, as brief songs  10 in 37 minutes  sprout unexpected sections while their arrangements metamorphose.\n\nThe lyrics are suffused with disappointment, betrayal and pessimism, both personal and collective. “I was lost then, and I’m lost now/And I doubt I’ll ever know which way to go,” Mr. Mercer sings in “Vaporize.” The cryptic, possibly homicidal “Sailing to Nowhere” observes, “You’re a deviant sister, guts on your blouse” but the song’s real point is how many variations it works on a pop-rock waltz, in an arrangement that sometimes shifts line by line, all the while glancing over its shoulder at “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.”\n\nThe tracks on “Broken Bells” are an origami of influences, blurring sources and revivals. Are the slightly distorted drums and not-quite-in-tune synthesizer in “The High Road” from 1960s bachelor-pad music or Stereolab’s revision of it? Do the handclaps and ticking drums in “The Ghost Inside” hark back to late-1970s electro or to Danger Mouse’s production for Gorillaz? Are the stately tempo, string-section chords and Beatles chord progressions in “Citizen” from “Magical Mystery Tour” or from Electric Light Orchestra? Do the prickly post-punk guitar and harmony vocals in “The Mall & Misery” allude to Gang of Four and Talking Heads or to Yeasayer?\n\nMr. Mercer was headed in these directions anyway with songs like “Sea Legs” from the last Shins album, “Wincing the Night Away.” Danger Mouse abets him by giving the music a dusty-vinyl haze. But too many of Broken Bells’ revivals, and revived revivals, have already been thoroughly explored. When “Mongrel Heart” wanders away from its Cure homage for an interlude of mariachi trumpet backed by twangy guitar, it’s as if the group is crossing off the spaghetti-western scores of Ennio Morricone (another Stereolab source) from a checklist.\n\nThere’s ample melody in the music, and the lyrics hold anguish and malaise. But Broken Bells’ production numbs the songs. What could have been cries from the heart are turned into in-jokes. JON PARELES\n\nDJ DRAMA & FABOLOUS\n\n“There Is No Competition 2: The Funeral Service”\n\n(mixtape)\n\nOver the last decade mixtapes have become essential elements of rappers’ catalogs, showcases for showing off skill and blowing off steam. T. I., 50 Cent, Jadakiss, Lil Wayne, Clipse, Cam’ron: all have released mixtapes as important as any of their albums.\n\nFabolous is the first rapper for whom mixtapes have completely eclipsed proper label-released albums, though. His last one, “Loso’s Way” ( Def Jam), released in 2009, was, like most of his albums since his bruising 2001 debut, a disappointment: one hit and a lot of aimless filler.\n\nBut put Fabolous on someone else’s beat, either as a guest rapper or an interloper, and he comes alive. Fabolous treats other people’s songs as territory to be desecrated, a place to generally outrap whoever was there first as if he were exacting revenge for some unspecified slight. This has made for frighteningly good mixtapes over the years, if not a robust business model.\n\nFor Fabolous this latest impressive mixtape is a concept record  well, a themed record  about the simple sport of decimating other rappers. During one skit his protégé Freck Billionaire imitates a newscaster reporting from the scene of a slaughter: “There are bodies everywhere. Ewww, it reeks of rapper down here.” Later DJ Drama, who orchestrated this collection, barks raspy condolences to the bereaved: “Our prayers are with you!”\n\nFabolous is an intense lyricist who often seems to build his rugged, dense verses from the rhymes backward. On “Body Bag,” which features Cam’ron, one of the few rappers who can keep up with him, he issues a series of sly threats with a mushy mouth, sounding as if he’s got a swollen tongue: “We had a little bet, wouldn’t say a vault-breaker/But watch your mouth, I’m not the best insult-taker/I make them call the yellow-tapers and the chalk-tracers.”\n\nElsewhere there are plenty of punchy metaphors (“Suspect as R. Kelly with Girl Scout cookies”) and absurd boasts (“The bitch with me badder than my 2-year-old”). And Fabolous isn’t above insulting other famous folks to get his point across. (“If you could have Beyoncé, would you take Solange?”)\n\nIt’s a relentless assault right up until the last song, “Exhibit F,” Fabolous’s version of the recent Jay Electronica hit “Exhibit C,” and the only number here more than a tall stack of threats and insults. “They sweeping through the blocks/Slam you on the floor for what you keeping in your socks/16-year-olds be sleeping with they Glocks,” Fabolous raps, lamenting the intractability of life in the drug game.\n\nHe tries to counsel a young shooter, only to be dismissed: “The heat’s the only way I keep my hands warm,” the kid tells Fabolous, as if he should know better. It’s moving and poignant, thoughtful and thought through, and makes Fabolous sound vulnerable: just the sort of song that makes for a long career outside of mixtapes. JON CARAMANICA\n\nJAMIE CULLUM\n\n\"The Pursuit\"\n\n(Verve Forecast)\n\nDuring a quiet moment in “I’m All Over It,” the lead single from his third album, “The Pursuit,” Jamie Cullum adopts the air of a vulnerable man. “One dark morning,” he sings, reaching into his falsetto, “she left without a warning.” He sounds believably hurt, but only for an instant, and then he’s back to his spiel about moving on.\n\nMoving on, moving up, moving out and about: this is Mr. Cullum’s standard operating procedure. A British singer-songwriter and pianist with a loose foothold in jazz, he’s as well-known for the kinetic mania of his concerts as he is for the playful rasp in his voice.\n\n“The Pursuit” internalizes that restless edge, ducking from big-band swing to semi-gloss pop to piano balladry to house music. “I’m All Over It” is the album’s answer to “Haven’t Met You Yet,” the breakout hit of another crossover crooner, Michael Bublé. Elsewhere Mr. Cullum and his producer, Greg Wells, seem to be thinking of Coldplay, or rehashing past gambles. (A few years back Mr. Cullum got some mileage out of his lounge-jazz take on a Neptunes song. Here, less winsomely, he tackles the Rihanna hit “Don’t Stop the Music.”)\n\nThis would all feel innocuous enough if Mr. Cullum gave any indication of humility. Too many songs on “The Pursuit” paint their singer as an un-self-conscious lout, too sure of his hand (“We Run Things”) or his taste (“Mixtape”) or his centrality in the world (“Wheels”).\n\nAnd on “Music Is Through,” the house track at the album’s close, he makes himself the prize. “If you wanna get with me/Then you’ve gotta pin me down.” There’s an “if” in that sentence, but Mr. Cullum doesn’t seem aware of it.
