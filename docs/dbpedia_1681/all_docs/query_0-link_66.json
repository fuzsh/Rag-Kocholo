        "text": "DJ Khaled's stock was at a low when he released his widely-planned album I Changed a Lot last October. (It was evident that he had not changed at all. As this article will demonstrate. Khaled has always been incorrigible.) What followed was an unlikely resurgence, due in large part to the popularity of Khaled's Snapchat. He got his own Beats 1 radio show, landed a spot opening for Beyonce on her Formation tour, signed a new deal with Epic, and got listed on Time's \"30 Most Influential People on the Internet\" list.\n\nClick through the gallery to revisit DJ Khaled before this recent chapter. Let's take it back to 2010 before (sorry, “I’m On One”), when DJ Khaled was still a radio DJ and produced beats under his alter ego, Beat Novacane...\n\nTerror Squad - ”Yes Dem to Def” (2002)\n\n#TBT: Early DJ Khaled\n\nDJ Khaled was crafting the beginning of a fruitful creative partnership with Fat Joe and the Terror Squad around the same time he was making a name for himself as a radio DJ. He produced Terror Squad’s “Yes Dem to Def,” and he inspires Fat Joe to lay ruin to his floral, flute-driven beat in probably the greatest introduction in hip hop history:\n\n“YO CRACK. HOW MANY TIMES I GOTTA KEEP TELLING THESE [EXPLETIVE]. THAT YOU THE TRUE KING OF NY, MAN. I BEEN TELLING THESE [EXPLETIVE] FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS, MAN. I’M SICK OF THESE [EXPLETIVE]. YOU JOEY CRACK THE DON CARTAGENA. COOK COKE CRACK MAN. YOU AIN’T NOTHING TO [EXPLETIVE] WITH. LET THESE [EXPLETIVE] KNOW!!!!!”\n\nFabolous - “Gangsta” (2004)\n\n#TBT: Early DJ Khaled\n\nDJ Khaled had the opportunity to produce for Fabolous in his prime. On “Gangsta,” he orchestrates a simple but effective chain of events by positioning a solitary bass note so that it triggers a satisfying piano jangle up top.\n\nRick Ross - “I’m A G” feat. Lil Wayne & Brisco (2006)\n\n#TBT: Early DJ Khaled\n\n“I’m a G,” a cut that appeared towards the end of Rick Ross’ seminal Port of Miami, marked the beginning of Ross and Khaled’s alliance. (Ross is the only artist to have appeared on all eight of Khaled’s albums.) “I’m a G” gets it’s pathos from Khaled’s pulsating organ ‘n’ gothic synth riff at the song’s core. Take ‘em to church, Khaled!\n\nFat Joe - “Make It Rain” (2006)\n\n#TBT: Early DJ Khaled\n\nKhaled had nothing to do with the making of “Make it Rain,” (although he later organized a remix) but he turns up in the music video as the dude who holds Fat Joe’s umbrella. Part of Khaled’s charm is that, from time to time, he willingly submits himself to these sorts of subordinate, servile roles. The “Make it Rain” video is one of his defining moments.\n\n“Holla At Me” feat. Lil Wayne, Paul Wall, Fat Joe, Rick Ross and Pitbull (2006)\n\n#TBT: Early DJ Khaled\n\nThe best song from Khaled's debut album Listennn… The Album, \"Holla At Me\" enjoys a simmering Southern beat, Lil Wayne at the height of his powers, and a vintage verse from the slab god himself Paul Wall.\n\n“We Takin Over” feat, Akon, T.I., Rick Ross, Fat Joe, Birdman, and Lil Wayne (2007)\n\n#TBT: Early DJ Khaled\n\nThe song that truly put DJ Khaled on the map. \"We Takin Over\" was his first radio hit. Every year there's that one hot song that's the anthem for high school juniors officially getting upgraded to seniors at the end of year assembly. \"We Takin Over\" was that song.\n\nI'm So Hood\n\n#TBT: Early DJ Khaled\n\n“I’m So Hood” feat. T-Pain, Trick Daddy, Rick Ross, and Plies (2007)\n\nAmong Khaled's most frequent collaborators, Teddy Pain has been the most reliable, and he especially killed it on \"I'm So Hood.\" How did this dude get temporarily ostracized from rap? Khaled continues to satisfy his penchant for razor-sharp synths that cut through the clutter.\n\n“Go Hard” feat. Kanye West and T-Pain (2008)\n\n#TBT: Early DJ Khaled\n\nA single from Khaled's We Global, \"Go Hard\" featured a heavy use of auto-tune that foreshadowed Kanye's 808s and Heartbreak, which would be released two months later. Although 808s is all about pain. There is no pain in \"Go Hard.\"\n\n“All I Do Is Win” feat. T-Pain, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg, and Rick Ross (2010)\n\n#TBT: Early DJ Khaled\n\nOff the album Victory... \"Aill I Do Is Win\" harps on a recurring theme in Khaled’s music. Winning. There is no other option."
