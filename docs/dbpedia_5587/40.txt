HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY is John Ford’s seven-time Academy Award winning saga of a Welsh coal mining town. We are introduced to the Morgan family by the overbearing narration of an adult Hugh Morgan, as he prepares to leave his home town for greener pastures. Willie Morgan is the stubborn patriarch of the Morgan family, ruling over the family dinners with a sharp wit and wisdom. The family prospers with their men working in the valley coal mine. The family is split apart, however, by the mining company’s decision to lower wages. The brothers break family tradition by standing against their father in disagreement, and soon move out of the house to form a labor union with other disgruntled workers.

HOW GREEN IS MY VALLEY is a collection of colorful vignettes, all displaying a depth and love for family and community, and a warning against the evils of hypocrisy and greed. It is playfully directed by John Ford, and contains steadfast performances by Walter Pidgeon and Donald Crisp. The movie has integrity from the spiritual truth portrayed in the screenplay, the strength and detail of each character, the music, the Oscar winning cinematography, and art direction. With majestic themes, HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY continues to be “evergreen” in its quality and entertainment value, and it promotes going to church and the Bible.
