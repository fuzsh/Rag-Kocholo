        "text": "No greater film was made under the classical Hollywood production model - it's always been easy to talk about Ford's compositions but what of his montage? We know that well until Ford had Argosy Productions in 1947 that he would cut his sequences within the camera - for example if, in the middle of a master shot Ford knew he would need a close-up, he would place his hand in front of the lens until the specific reading was complete, removing it again once he knew he would cut back: this was to prevent studio editors from meddling with the footage as directors often were not let into the cutting room, either because of studio regulations or because that director…\n\n...So wow.\n\nMaybe I do need to be a little more discerning with my grades in general (this is my third 10 this month) because how often do you walk out of a film in which you 1) cry multiple times at the most subtle of gestures and most expressive of compositions and 2) decide that you need to reconsider who you call your favorite director.\n\nOn the surface, Ford is your granddaddy's favorite director: heavy, a bit slow, perhaps a little too moralizing, and (oh dear no!) sentimental. But then there's the actual Ford, the one I came to when I saw Mogambo last year: loaded with emotion in every frame, packing in expressive compositions throughout, and drenched with…\n\n\"Trying to fill a bathtub with holes indeed.\"\n\nIn John Ford's big Hollywood-style Bildungsroman How Green Was My Valley, a loving family of coal miners struggles against underemployment, exploitative labor practices, religious provincialism, and generational loss in late-Victorian era Wales—as seen through the eyes of the family's youngest child Huw Morgan (Roddy McDowell), who spends more than half the run time recovering from partial paralysis. Since the film is technically immaculate, comprises the very quintessence of mawkishness, and mostly endorses a conservative bootstrapping mentality, it should come as no surprise that the ever-hoary Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated it for ten awards (half of which it scampered away with, including Best Picture over Citizen Kane).\n\nUnable to…\n\n“How Green Was My Valley” is so sticky sweet with sentimentality, you’ll need to visit a dentist after viewing it.\n\nBut what’s life without sugar; even if your teeth and stomach might grumble otherwise?\n\nLegendary grouch John Ford might seem an odd director for one of the most gentle of golden age Hollywood films. It makes him, though, a tempered leader for a dulcet voyage towards nostalgia.\n\n“Valley” is a Bildungsroman of a story centred around a precocious young boy growing up in a Welsh coal mining village. Think “Jane Eyre,” but if she was raised by a large and loving family.\n\nIt’s pitiless and cruel to knock any movie for an excess of the saccharine, least of all when…\n\nI grew up around John Ford movies, though my father and grandfather wouldn’t have described them that way. They were movie-watchers who were driven by select stars and for both they were enamored with John Wayne, but particularly my grandfather, who almost always had a western playing on his old television set whenever I stayed with my grandparents during the summers. He used to record them on VHS tapes whenever one was playing, so it wasn’t rare for the ambient noise of something like The Searchers (1956) or Stagecoach (1939) to penetrate the walls and become the soundtrack to the time I spent with my brother and an older cousin, who was closer to a sister back then. I’ve frequently…\n\nObviously, it is not as good as that film. Though, let's not let arbitrary awards control our reaction. After all, this film does not need comparison to be branded as bad.\n\nThis is the broadest, shallowest and most mawkish picture. Visually, it is incredibly handsome, with some impressive production design to go alongside striking compositions. It also touches upon interesting topics but it just skirts through everything, providing little of impact and boiling everything down to a family portrait that is not very compelling.\n\nEvents just happen, somewhat randomly as the focus is so wide. We have too many ill defined characters in the mix and the narrative pulls towards their directions in unsatisfying ways. Characters are sketched out in…"
