        "text": "Details: 1941, USA, 118 mins\n\nDirection: John Ford\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nSummary: Life in a mining village.\n\nA chance to see another of the impeccable restorations of classic American films (this one with crucially renovated sound) to come out of the Academy Film Archive in Beverly Hills. It is also an opportunity to pay tribute to the memory of one of its stars, the British-born Roddy McDowell - a friend and benefactor of film archives in the United States - who died this year.\n\nAdapted from Richard Llewellyn's best-selling novel, Ford's prodigious Oscar-winner of 1941 (including Best Picture, Direction, Cinematography and Art Direction), in which a man's voice (the McDowell character as an adult) recalls his time growing up in a Welsh mining community, with its romances, pit tragedies and labour troubles, still grips and moves despite its stagey style and 'Hollywoodisation' (an elaborate Welsh village set was built on the Fox lot to represent turn-of-the-century Wales).\n\nClyde Jeavons"
