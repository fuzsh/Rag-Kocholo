        "text": "The video version of this review can be found here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLtpK72GtF4\n\nThis beat Citizen Kane. Let me repeat. This BEAT Citizen Kane. I’ll just let that settle in for a moment…Okay. You good? Good. Any movie that won such a prestigious award over such a legendary film like Orson Welles’s classic better be damn good to hold such a distinction. Is How Green Was My Valley that great? Well, if being so boring that I felt like taking a nap is a scale of greatness, then yes, it’s wonderful.\n\nHow Green Was My Valley was originally meant to be a four hour epic to rival even Gone with the Wind (1939). It would be shot in color on location in Wales. The constant bombings of the U.K. by the Axis Powers, however, made filming there impossible. The production was moved to back-lot shooting in California, which was considered a poor substitute for Wales and led to the movie being done in black and white. The epic aspirations were also lost.\n\nRichard Llewellyn’s 1939 book was adapted for this movie. The John Ford-helmed project follows the troubles of a Welsh family who live in a small mining town in the South Wales Valleys during the end of the 19th century. The family consists of a father and longtime mine worker, Gwilym Morgan (played by Donald Crisp); a caring mother (played by Sara Allgood) who won’t be pushed around by anyone; five adult sons who also work at the mine; a young daughter (played by Maureen O’Hara) who has taken interest in the new, opened-minded town preacher (played by Walter Pidgeon); and the youngest boy, Huw (played by a very young Roddy McDowall). As an adult, Huw (the narrator for this film) begins his look back at his childhood in the town. The mine is prosperous and the workers are happy. Then pay is decreased due to some iron workers coming in from the north, a strike is on the horizon and eventually occurs, and the once happy lives of the town and the Morgan family are slowly lost in time as people leave home, lose their jobs, and die.\n\nDon’t let the intriguing sounding plot fool you. The movie is as exciting as waiting in line at the DMV. Actually, that’s a bit unfair. The DMV is way more thrilling. I know that’s harsh, but I was so unengaged by the happenings onscreen that I couldn’t get myself to care about much of it.\n\nPart of the problem is the film never really seems to have much of a structure or point. When news of a possible strike reaches the ears of Gwilym by way of five of his sons, he is steadfastly against the idea and the talks of union that are on its heels. The strike then comes shortly after. The town, knowing of his oppositions to the strike and unions, quickly turn against the beloved figure, even throwing a rock through one of his house windows. This, like other plot points, creates tension, but there’s no payoff. The film just introduces the drama and shoos it away a little while later. Huw and Gwilym’s wife fall into some ice cold, winter water, the two are restricted to bed for months, and the town forgives Gwilym without any further mention or repercussions of his attitudes against the strike. The forgetting of plot-lines in this way makes good chunks of the story come off as pointless.\n\nThere is obviously a point Ford and the writers are trying to make. The film’s intent is to follow the lives of this family in order to show loss of innocence, to see the destruction of the Welsh countryside from these mines, and to explore the idea of memory keeping people and places of a particular time alive even decades after they are gone or unrecognizable. The movie doesn’t seem to know how to get these messages across, though. Like I already mentioned, it jumps around a lot between characters and plot points without there being any obvious connection or point. There will be a scene between O’Hara and Pidgeon that deals with their romance, but the scene doesn’t really progress the relationship at all and just sort of happens. It makes the movie come off like it has no real story or narrative push and the point Ford was trying to make gets a bit lost.\n\nI’m struggling to think of anything else I can say about this movie. It’s nearly a week on that I saw it, and I can hardly remember any of it. Thinking back, it feels like I slept through most of it when I was certainly awake for the whole thing. It was that dull. So little grabs you. The romance between O’Hara and Pidgeon’s characters is boring, most of the stuff having to do with the mine and/or the family is boring, and just about everything else the movie throws at you is boring.\n\nThere were only two parts of the story I found interesting, that kept me alert and at attention. One was Huw’s relationship with his parents. Lots of films have the clichéd hard-ass father who doesn’t believe in education and just wants his child to follow in his footsteps. He’s usually countered with a mother who wants more for her child. How Green Was My Valley turns this on its head and reverses the roles for a refreshing take on a familiar plot line. Mr. Morgan, knowing how terrible the mines are and the future that lies ahead for anyone who works there, doesn’t want his smart son to follow his lead. He, like any good parent, wants something better for his child. It’s Huw’s more traditional mother who doesn’t see the point in further education and thinks the mine is a perfectly good and respectable future. Both parents remain caring, even with the mother coming off a bit unlikeable sometimes, but their independent views and character traits are clearly demonstrated. This new take is strengthen by the wonderful performance of Donald Crisp, who was by far the the only character I cared much about.\n\nThe other intriguing bit of the story comes from a subplot where Huw goes to school in a nearby village. As soon as Huw arrives at the school, he is made fun of and beaten by not only the students but also the cruel teacher. Huw is quickly taught how to box by one of his fellow townsfolk (played by Rhys Williams). Once Huw starts winning fights, the teacher finally intervenes – delivering a savage beating to Huw and not the bullies. Williams’ character then goes down to the school with a friend for an immensely satisfying and incredibly amusing scene where the two men teach the terrible man a lesson.\n\nEverything else, while not terrible, made me want to nod off. None of it, except for an explosion in the mine near the end, was memorable. Nothing made it worthy of beating not only Citizen Kane but other nominees like The Maltese Falcon, Suspicion, and Sergeant York. Why did How Green Was My Valley win then? I have little more than guesses. All I can say is this picture certainly isn’t the worst we’ve seen so far. There are aspects of it that are done well (like the sets and cinematography), but it lacks any sort of narrative drive and is so boring you’ll want to follow Rip Van Winkle’s lead and sleep for about 20 years."
