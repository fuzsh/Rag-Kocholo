        "text": "Ask a legend how he became one, and you’ll either receive a myth or a lie in response.\n\nThat is the experience of Peter Bogdanovich’s “Directed by John Ford;” a documentary on the icon’s cultural impact — centered around interviews with his contemporaries, colleagues, and the man himself: John Ford.\n\nWith over 120 films to his name, and many more derived from it, Ford might well be called the most influential director of all time. From Orson Welles to Steven Spielberg, Clint Eastwood, and Martin Scorsese - their stories, and essentially all of modern cinema, begin with Ford.\n\nAs Welles said, “With Ford at his best, you get a sense of what the earth is made of.”\n\nBut Ford doesn’t…\n\nJohn Ford was a comedy genius! You may not get that from watching any of his films—the comic relief is routinely the weakest element in even his greatest works. But I swear to you, watching crotchety old Pappy Ford stonewall poor fresh faced, wet behind the ears Peter Bogdanovich in front of a Monument Valley backdrop is among the funniest things I ever have seen.
