In this beloved classic, a sixty-year-old looks back on his life as a boy (Roddy McDowall) during the turn of the last century in a small Welsh coal-mining town. As he recalls family dreams, struggles and triumphs, he also remembers the changes to the labor force brought on by industrialization in this acclaimed story that also stars Donald Crisp, Sara Allgood, Maureen Oâ€™Hara and Walter Pidgeon.",

        "text": "Unfairly derided as one of the most undeserving Best Picture winners, John Ford's gorgeous, heartbreaking portrait of a Welsh coal-mining community represents the best sort of cinema.\n\nSeptember 18, 2023\n\nCore values, faith in God, and the importance of doing a good job well are at the center of this dreary and determined drama.\n\nJune 27, 2023\n\nYou cannot translate something you do not know in your bones. Ford has made a sincere and, as I say, moving film of How Green Was My Valley; but something of the salt and wildness of the people about whom Richard Llewellyn wrote is gone.\n\nAugust 8, 2022\n\nThe drama is no \"made up\" tale, but a panoramic glimpse of the small joys, the unmeasurable needs, the many griefs of a whole countryside. It is a story of life that is no more, but it is also a drama of people in every community.\n\nJuly 26, 2022\n\nIt is a cinema masterpiece of rare beauty. It brings the same thrilling experience as reading a fine piece of poetry or looking at an exquisite painting. You feel that they have come from the heart.\n\nJuly 26, 2022\n\nYoung Roddy McDowall is a lad of inestimable charm as Huw. Wide-eyed, sensitive, he is just the boy for the part. The cast is an altogether worthy one.\n\nJuly 26, 2022\n\nThis adaptation of Richard Llewellyn's best-selling novel is rare and lovely, rugged and true. Seeing it is an experience no lover of fine films should miss.\n\nJuly 26, 2022\n\nHow Green Was My Valley isn't John Ford's most exciting movie, but it is his most beautiful, far and away. It really should be called a musical.\n\nJuly 26, 2022"
