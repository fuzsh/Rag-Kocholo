        "text": "How Green Was My Valley (1941)\n\nJohn Ford’s How Green Was My Valley - based on the Richard Llewellyn novel of the same name, which is largely unknown outside of Britain - is the infamous film that defeated Suspicion, Sergeant York, The Maltese Falcon, and Citizen Kane for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Though I do agree with the fact that Citizen Kane is far and away the superior film of the five, How Green Was My Valley is my personal favorite of the five. Many younger cinephiles have excoriated How Green Was My Valley for its sacrilegious role in film history, but many of those outlandish critics have not seen the film for themselves and a sizable minority reject the notion that John Ford was an important filmmaker. A family film in all the sense of that categorization, How Green Was My Valley is - when not judged by the effects of critical tribalism - a spectacular, essential masterwork.\n\nIn South Wales within Cwm Rhondda (the Welsh name for the Rhondda Valley, so excuse all the peculiar spellings you are about to see) resides the Morgan family - father Gwilym (Donald Crisp), mother Beth (Sara Allgood), daughter Angharad (Maureen O’Hara), and six sons, the youngest being Huw (a believable Roddy McDowall as a child, Irving Pichel as the adult narrator). Also in town is the young preacher Mr. Gruffydd (Walter Pidgeon) and Bronwyn (Anna Lee), who soon marries Huw’s eldest brother Ivor (Patric Knowles). But it is through Huw that we see the events of the film. Thus, the lens through which he views the town, its residents, and life itself - from the first few scenes of the lush, healthy hillsides up to his final day in the valley, scarred by the blackened veins of decades of coal mining - renders an unreliable narrator. And this is where I think opinions start to differ. No one expects unreliable narrators in films before 1950’s Rashomon in anything outside of film noir. How Green is My Valley's harshest critics point to this as a wellspring of schmaltzy sentimentalism - discrediting children as an acceptable centerpoint in which action is observed, a position which I find exclusive.\n\nEven though the film is seen mostly through Huw’s understanding of the world, there are extended moments where we step outside his childlike world of Treasure Island and Pickwick Papers reading. There are numerous subplots running through this episodic film: the valley workers strike when the mine owners cut their wages and hire migrant workers for cheaper wages and - the emotional groundswell of the film - the impossible love between Angharad and Mr. Gruffydd. Angharad and Mr. Gruffydd’s scenes are accompanied by this Alfred Newman melody (minus the lyrics). She will marry a man she doesn’t love as Gruffydd looks on. The cinematography by Arthur C. Miller allows distance from Gruffydd and Angharad - to zoom into their anguished faces would be invasive and inconsiderate. We don’t need any further tugs to the heartstrings to know what they both are feeling but not expressing to anyone. There is a tenderness and profound understanding to how Ford, Miller, and screenwriter Philip Dunne approach romantic longing and chronic poverty in this Welsh mining town. Similarities will be drawn to Ford’s adaptation of The Grapes of Wrath the previous year. The distance of Miller’s unintrusive cinematography and Ford’s extremely deep staging (the entire village was an actual set built in California’s San Fernando Valley on the Ventura County side) is reflective of a filmmaking maturity that - dare I say it - surpasses The Grapes of Wrath. Yearnings and unrealized connections of love are not told to us by the tear-stained faces of Maureen O’Hara and Walter Pidgeon. Instead, the camera and the massive deep staging does all the work. Very few films and even fewer filmmakers can come close to achieving such a command of cinematic vocabulary.\n\nThere is an unstated sadness that runs through the Morgan family as the brothers, one-by-one, are laid off, Angharad never gets together with Gruffyyd (in tumblrspeak, let the shipping commence), Beth Morgan and Huw almost lose their ability to walk when they fall through thin ice, and Gwilym must assume his dual roles as village and family leader. No judgments are made about the men and their political positions. The tensions between sons and patriarch, patriarch and matriarch, and workers and employers all reach boiling points. How Gwiliym manages to maintain his mental fortitude juggling so many conflicts is Herculean - like Donald Crisp’s performance. Equally Herculean in her efforts is Beth who, following gender norms established by the time period and the source material, defends her husband, sons, and daughter to the point of exhaustion when spiteful intentions are spewed by frustrated villagers. Like Crisp, Sara Allgood’s immense performance befits her character’s tenacity and inner strength. Last I checked, keeping a divided family together in the face of increasingly hostile neighbors is anything but sentimental. That should be as clear as the black smoke emanating from the village rooftops and the mine. And for those who don’t like their films unrelentingly bleak, How Green Was My Valley's small moments allow for brief glimpses of happiness and humor. Life - even in the darkest, most dangerous coal mine and even in a vicious cycle of poverty - is not suffering all the time.\n\nHow Green Was My Valley's (“was” being the key word in the title) reputation has been shellacked by critics not willing to recognize the artistic and narrative genius this film contains. Though some are understandably put off by the episodic narrative structure, my tolerance for episodic, jump-happy structure is very high. James B. Clark's editing has a perfect coherence and he weaves this beautiful cross-stitch of a film with a firm expertise.\n\nIts themes of labor struggles, familial division, forced emigration, and even environmental degradation have stood the unforgiving tests of time. The Great Depression had just concluded with the onset of World War II in Europe and the imminent entry of the United States. FDR’s New Deal, increased immigration, and the hardships of more than a decade of economic catastrophe made How Green Was My Valley a timely film upon release. Even now, its power is unmistakable. It is more relatable than the eloquent narcissism, big-stomached arrogance, and moral bankruptcy of Orson Welles’ Citizen Kane. It is more applicable than the enjoyable Maltese Falcon, Sergeant York, and Suspicion. Yet, all these Best Picture-nominated films seem unmakeable in today’s Hollywood climate. Something like How Green Was My Valley, for its massive temporal and narrative scope and its perceived sentimentalism, would be almost impossible to produce in today’s moviemaking climate. Even though the hillsides have been blackened, there is ever opportunity for an environmental reversal. And though that might sound like a fanciful dream, there is always the potential for incredible beauty no matter how damaged a once-green valley might be.\n\nThe original intention by 20th Century Fox was for How Green Was My Valley to be a four-hour epic film - an epic runtime akin to Gone with the Wind. Fox also wanted to shoot in Wales but war in Europe made the logistics and politics of such a shoot impossible. The wisdom goes that no bad film is ever too short and no good film is ever too long. One wonders what Ford could have done if given two more hours. Given what Ford presented in his final cut, How Green Was My Valley may have been his indisputable magnum opus among a filmography rife with masterpieces. It is best not to dwell on such hypotheticals as How Green Was My Valley, at just over two hours, is a wonderful film in its own right.\n\nSo shall I be a cool cinephile and say I don’t have emotions? Absolutely not. How Green Was My Valley is an effective, masterclass of a film whose reputation has been soiled by the astigmatism, ignorance, or bitterness levied towards it. Though no one would call Ford’s film one of the greatest ever made, it is a worthwhile film that has withstood the deterioration and mutilation of other once-green valleys. One should make time to return to a small part of film history that many say isn’t worth the trip.\n\nMy rating: 10/10\n\n^ Based on my personal imdb rating. How Green Was My Valley is the one hundred and fourth feature-length or short film I have rated a ten on imdb."
