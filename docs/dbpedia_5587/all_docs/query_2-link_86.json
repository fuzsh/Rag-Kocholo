Here is what I think: first, have your union. You need it. Alone you are weak. Together you are strong. But remember that with strength goes responsibility to others and yourselves, for you cannot conquer injustice with more injustice - only with justice, and the help of God.\" -Mr. Gruffydd.\n\n\"As your father cleans his lamp to have good light, so keep clean your spirit... By prayer, Huw. And by prayer I don't mean shouting and mumbling and wallowing like a hog in religious sentiment. Prayer is only another name for good, clean, direct thinking. When you pray, think. Think well what you're saying. Make your thoughts into things that are solid. And that way your prayer will have strength. And that strength will become a part of you - body, mind and spirit.\" -Mr. Gruffydd.\n\n\"Men like my father cannot die. They are with me still, real in memory as they were in flesh, loving and beloved forever. How green was my valley then.\" -Narrator."
