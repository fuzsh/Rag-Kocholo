        "text": "My boyfriend loves black and white films. I’ve always found it kind of funny how he will go out of his way to find them on YouTube or on Netflix, even when there are hundreds of other more popular films/shows to choose from. It wasn’t until I started watching them with him that I started to realize why he liked them so much. And when we saw How Green Was My Valley, I knew I had to write about it.\n\nSince we’re getting near the Christmas season, I’m going to recommend this film to anyone who enjoys A Christmas Story. Much like how the holiday classic follows one boy throughout a period of weeks, How Green was My Valley does the same with a boy in 20th century Wales over a period of years. It even has an internal dialogue spoken by (presumably) his older self, just like in A Christmas Story. It follows his journey as a young, naive boy looking up to his older brothers and father until he can finally join them in the coal mines. Many tragedies happen along the way, including him overcoming paralysis, coping with the loss of a brother, and eventually, the loss of his father. It’s a beautiful coming of age piece that is both touching and inspirational. And now, here’s my controversial opinion: I don’t think the film would be any better in color.\n\nBefore I get a bunch of angry letters arguing for the recoloring of movies, let me explain. I think in some circumstances it can work very well. But for movies where the plot is driven by the characters rather than the visuals, color truly isn’t necessary to tell the story. For How Green Was My Valley, the lack of color forces you to draw deeper connections with these characters and the story. In addition, since most of the film revolves around a mining town, most of the shots are dark and dreary and wouldn’t have much color in them. If you don’t believe me that some films are better colorless, take a look at the 2018 Oscar-winning film Roma. That came out long after the colored film was invented — but it was filmed in black and white. Part of that is because the filmmakers wanted to take you back to the time the story takes place (1970s Mexico City), but I would also argue it was because the story was so character-focused that color wasn’t necessary. Even in black and white, the visuals are stunning and the story is incredible. Although it didn’t win Best Picture, I’d argue that it deserved the award over Greenbook. But that’s for another article."
