        "text": "PALM SPRINGS, Calif., Aug. 31 — John Ford, director of “The Informer,” “Stagecoach,” “How Green Was My Valley,” “Grapes of Wrath” and other award‐winning film classics, died today at the age of 78.\n\nA spokesman said Mr. Ford died at his home in nearby Palm Desert.\n\nDaring and Durable\n\nBy ALBIN KREBS\n\nImaginative, daring, sensitive, courageous, craftsmanlike, tough and, above all, durable, John Ford, who directed more than 130 feature‐length films over 40 years, won deserved fame as one of the greatest directors the American motion picture industry has produced.\n\nWith his classic “The Informer,” released in 1935, less than a decade after the movies had learned to talk, Mr. Ford almost singlehandedly made the sound motion picture come of age.\n\nMost of Mr. Ford's films had merit, but particularly excellent were those for which he won the director's award of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences—“The Informer,” plus “The Grapes of Wrath,” “How Green Was My Valley” and “The Quiet Man.” He was the only director ever to win four Oscars and the only one to be cited four times by the New York Film Critics.\n\nOther Ford movies that have won positions on portant films worldwide were “Stagecoach,” “The Lost. Patrol,” “Young Mr. Lincoln,”, ment Award at lavish ceremovies in Beverly Hills attended by scores of colleagues and one of his biggest fans—President Nixon.\n\n“I've seen virtually all of the 140 Ford movies,” Mr. Nixon proclaimed. He then capped the evening's ceremonies by presenting Mr. Ford with the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.\n\nIn stamping on his films his own personal trademark of quality, Mr. Ford became known as a meticulous, tough taskmaster who fought with producers, studio presidents,) writers and performers. (“Ail actors,” he once fumed, “are children — unborn children.”)\n\nMr. Ford's byword was loyalty. He gave it to people he liked, and expected it to be returned. For example, the star of several of his early films was Harry Carey. After Mr. Carey died, Mr. Ford tried to make a star of Harry Carey Jr., putting him in “Three Godfathers,” a remake of a Harry Carey silent film called “Marked Men,” which opened with the printed inscription “To the Memory of Harry Carey.” Patrick Wayne, son of John Wayne, a Ford discovery, appeared in several Ford pictures.\n\nThe director was a nervous, twitchy man given to biting handkerchiefs. A six‐footer, in recent years he Appeared quite thin, almost frail. His once sandy hair had grayed and become wispy, but his still jaunty, arm‐swinging gait belied his years. He always had a cup often functioned as such throughout his career. He mastered what became a new technique for directors—“cutting” or editing the film “in the camera.”\n\n“The Tornado,” released in 1917, was the first Ford‐directed movie. The two‐reeler, which he wrote and starred in and for which he did his own stunt work, was about a cowboy who rescues the banker's daughter from outlaws and uses the reward money to bring his dear old Irish mother to America.\n\nBetween 1917 and 1920 Mr. Ford ground out some two dozen cheapjack movies. “The Iron Horse,” in 1924, brought him renown and is still considered a classic of filmed Americana. It told of a‐son's search for his father's murderer, against the background of the building of the Union Pacifio Railroad.\n\nThe 1928 “Four Sons” was a story of mother love told without bathos and mawkishness against a World War I background. The hard‐working Mr Ford directed three other movies that year, including “Hangman's House,” which introduced Marion Michael Morrison, a strapping young stunt, man whom Mr. Ford later renamed John Wayne.\n\nIn 1930, toe Fox company released “Men Without Women,” a vividly photographed drama about 14 men trapped in a submarine. One of Mr. Ford's most outstanding films, it marked the beginning of his long, and mutuany profitable, association with the scenarist Dudley Nichols. The following year, Mr. Ford won praise for the direction of “Arrowsmith,” Samuel Goldwyn's immensely popular soap opera about a valiant physician, based on the novel by Sinclair Lewis.\n\n“The Lost Patrol,” made in 1934 with Victor McLaglen and Boris Karloff as its stars, carried out the Ford conception of sight‐over‐sound. Its success was instrumental in R.K.O.'s decision to allow the Ford‐Nichols team to make “The Informer” in 1935.\n\nHis ‘Easiest Picture’ Internationally acclaimed to this day, “The Informer” holds down its place on every major list of “the greatest films of all time.” Mr. Ford called it “the easiest picture I ever directed,” adding.\n\n“No wonder. I had been dreaming of it for five years.” He took only three weeks to shoot it, on a budget of $218,000, roughly the cost of one of today's half‐hour television shows.\n\nSupposedly a “B” picture that Mr. Ford sneaked over the studio bosses' heads (“I told em vaguely it was about gangsters and stool‐pigeons”), “The Informer” won the first New York Film Critics Award as the best picture of the year, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences singled it out for several Oscars. In addition to the award to Mr. Ford for direction, Oscars went to Mr. Nichols for the scenario, to Max Steiner for musical score and to Victor McLaglen, who played the title role, as best actor.\n\nThe Ford‐Nichols chemistry also produced what most critics call the greatest Western ever made, “Stagecoach,” in 1939. Starring John Wayne, Claire Trevor and Thomas Mitchell, the film, about an odd assortment of characters thrown together in 1884 during a journey by stagecoach through Apache‐inhabited New Mexico Territory, was notable for its deft character studies, splendid photography and slambang action scenes.\n\nThe following year, Mr. Ford competed with himself for a director's Academy Award. Both “The Grapes of Wrath,” a trenchant film of social realism based on John Steinbeck's novel detailing the Okie migrations, and “The Long Voyage Home” were released in 1940. “The Long. Voyage Home,” based on four one‐act plays by Eugene O'Neill about the lonely lives of seamen, was hailed as a masterpiece of the art of visualizing character.\n\n“The Grapes of Wrath” won Mr. Ford his second Oscar. His third, for “How Green Was My Valley,” came in 1941. (His fourth Academy Award was for “The Quiet Man,” a beguiling, often rollicking Technicolor comedy he filmed in Ireland in 1952.)\n\nSkipped Award Ceremonies\n\nThe director did not show up at the Acadeiny Award ceremonies to collect his first three Oscars because, he explained, “once I went fishing, another time there was a war on, and on another occasion, I remember, I was suddenly taken drunk.”\n\nDuring World War II Mr. Ford, as a commander, was in charge of the Navy's film documentary unit, and after victory in Europe he served as head of a special interservice team that gathered photographic evidence for the Nuremberg trial of war criminals.\n\nHe was at Midway Island in June, 1942, when the Japanese attacked the important naval base there. His “The Battle of Midway,” a 20‐minute documentary released a month after the fighting stopped, won an Oscar as the best short subject of 1942. Mr. Ford's souvenir of the battle was a machinegun slug wound in his left arm, which he sustained while filming an aerial attack.\n\nMr. Ford, who was decorated with the Legion of Merit, the Air Medal and the Purple Heart, remained in the Naval Reserve and at the time of his death held the rank of rear admiral (retired).\n\nAmong the director's postwar movies were his trilogy on the United States Cavalry: “Fort Apache,” “She Wore A Yellow Ribbon” and “Rio Grande.” Other notable Ford films were “Wagonmaster,” “The Fugitive,” “Mogambo,” “The Search. ers,” “Mister Roberts,” The Last Hurrah” and “The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.”\n\nAlthough all five of his Oscars were won for non‐Westerns, Mr. Ford was perhaps best known for his outdoor pictures. He was, indeed, a master of the big scene who possessed an almost uncanny ability to depict the drama of human masses in a large landscape. His films abounded with magnificent pictures, yet they were not mere pictures, mere decorations, but instruments for telling the story.\n\nHis action sequences were famous for their vigor and their unrivaled ability to build and sustain tension. In “Stagecoach,” for instance, there is a long chase scene in which a screaming horde of Indians pursues the coach across the desert. The chase is so breathless, so breathtakingly framed and photographed that it becomes almost unendurable for the viewer.\n\nContrastingly, he could slow the pace of a scene to a nearstandstill to make the fullest use of pauses and silences. Thus, in “My Darling Clementine,” a young boy stands motionless, watching his older brothers ride off to a gunfight. Their horses are moving, but straight away from the camera, and so the viewer gets the over‐all impression of looking at a still picture.\n\nIn addition to familiar locations, Mr. Ford liked familiar faces around him when he worked. He used the same cameramen, assistant directors, costume designers, grips and electricians in picture after picture. He also employed the same stars, featured performers and bit players, such as John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, Henry Fonda, Jane Darwell, Ward Bond, George O'Brien, Anna Lee, Mae Marsh, and his older brother, Francis Ford.\n\nIt was said that Mr. Ford ruled his “stock company,” whose members referred to him as “Pappy” or “The Old Man,” with an imperious hand. Even stars such as Mr. Wayne and Miss O'Hara were expected to show up one night weekly, with their spouses, at his home to play cards.\n\nContradicted Himself\n\nMr. Ford's curmudgeonly personality came out in infrequent interviews, which he hated and which he used as he wished to contradict statements he had made in other interviews. When it was once pointed out to him that several of his films—such as “The Grapes of Wrath,” “The Long Voyage Home” and “Tobacco Road,” a rustic comedy that he somehow turned into a valuable plea for land reform—were serious “message” pictures, he replied testily:\n\n“Bull! I made those pictures because they had a great story to tell. I'm thoroughly apolitical and nonideological. I don't think I've ever even voted in a Presidential election.”\n\nThe director was a quiet family man who disliked night clubs and parties attended by people he did not know well. He and his wife, the former Mary McBryde Smith, whom he Married in 1920, had two children, Patrick Roper and Barbara Nugent Ford.\n\nHe was, according to one of his cronies, “a great shambles of a man,” who on the set wore “mangy old khaki pants, tennis shoes with holes at the toes, a sloppy old campaign jacket, a beat‐up fedora and a dirty scarf around the neck.”\n\nThroughout his life, Mr. Ford suffered poor eyesight and had to wear thick, shaded prescription glasses. About 25 years ago his left eye was injured in an accident on the set, and he finally lost sight in it. In recent years he wore a black eye patch."
