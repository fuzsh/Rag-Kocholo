        "text": "American actor (1894–1974)\n\nWalter Andrew Brennan (July 25, 1894 – September 21, 1974) was an American actor and singer.[1] He won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performances in Come and Get It (1936), Kentucky (1938) and The Westerner (1940), making him one of only three male actors to win three Academy Awards, and the only male or female actor to win three awards in the supporting actor category. Brennan was also nominated for his performance in Sergeant York (1941). Other noteworthy performances were in To Have and Have Not (1944), My Darling Clementine (1946), Red River (1948) and Rio Bravo (1959). On television, he starred in the sitcom The Real McCoys (1957-1963).\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nBrennan was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on July 25 1894, less than two miles from his family's home in Swampscott.[2] His parents were both Irish immigrants.[3] His father was an engineer and inventor, and young Brennan also studied engineering at Rindge Technical High School in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[4]\n\nWhile working as a bank clerk, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and served as a private with the 101st Field Artillery Regiment in France for two years[5] during World War I.[2][6] \"While there, he suffered an injury to his vocal cords from exposure to mustard gas that left him with his screen trademark: a distinctively reedy, high-pitched voice that became a favorite for celebrity impersonators for decades.\"[7]\n\nAfter the war, he worked as a financial reporter for a newspaper in Boston.[8] During the early 1920s, he made a fortune in the real estate market, but lost most of his money during a real estate slump.[4]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly work\n\n[edit]\n\nFinding himself penniless, Brennan began taking parts as an extra in films at Universal Studios in 1925, starting at $7.50 a day, equal to $130 today. He wound up working at Universal off and on for the next ten years.[9]\n\nHis early appearances included Webs of Steel (1925), Lorraine of the Lions (1925) and The Calgary Stampede (1925), a Hoot Gibson Western. Brennan was also in Watch Your Wife (1926), The Ice Flood (1926), Spangles (1926), The Collegians (1926, a short), Flashing Oars (1926, a short), Sensation Seekers (1927), Tearin' Into Trouble (1927), The Ridin' Rowdy (1927), Alias the Deacon (1927), Blake of Scotland Yard (1927) (a serial), Hot Heels (1927), Painting the Town (1928) and The Ballyhoo Buster (1928). The latter was directed by Richard Thorpe who would use Brennan as an extra several times on films.\n\nBrennan had minor roles in The Racket (1928) from Howard Hughes, The Michigan Kid (1928), Silks and Saddles (1929), The Cohens and the Kellys in Atlantic City (1929) and Smilin' Guns (1929) and The Lariat Kid (1929) with Gibson. He also worked as a stand in.[10]\n\nBrennan was in His Lucky Day (1929), Frank Capra's Flight (1929), One Hysterical Night (1929) (a bigger role), The Last Performance (1929), The Long Long Trail (1929) with Gibson and The Shannons of Broadway (1929).\n\nOther Brennan appearances included Dames Ahoy! (1930), Captain of the Guard (1930), King of Jazz (1930) (Brennan said he played nine parts but when he saw the film \"I sneezed and I missed myself\"),[9] The Little Accident (1930), Parlez Vous (1930), (a short), See America Thirst (1930) with Harry Langdon and Slim Summerville and Ooh La-La (1930), (another short).\n\nThe following year Brennan had more small roles in Hello Russia (1931, a short with Slim Summerville), Many a Slip (1931) with Summerville, Heroes of the Flames (1931) a serial with Tim McCoy, Honeymoon Lane (1931), Dancing Dynamite (1931), Grief Street (1931) directed by Richard Thorpe and Is There Justice? (1931).\n\nBrennan had a bigger role in Neck and Neck (1931), directed by Richard Thorpe. His parts tended to remain small, however: A House Divided (1931) for director William Wyler, Scratch-As-Catch-Can (1931, a Bobby Clark short directed by Mark Sandrich), and Texas Cyclone (1931, a Tim McCoy Western featuring a young John Wayne).\n\nIn 1932 Brennan was in Law and Order (1932) with Walter Huston, The Impatient Maiden (1932) for James Whale, The Airmail Mystery (1932, a serial) and Scandal for Sale (1932). He did another with John Wayne, Two-Fisted Law (1932) though the star was Tim McCoy.\n\nBrennan was in Hello Trouble (1932) with Buck Jones, Speed Madness (1932), Miss Pinkerton (1932) with Joan Bennett, Cornered (1932) with McCoy, The Iceman's Ball (1932, another short for Sandrich), Fighting for Justice (1932) with McCoy, The Fourth Horseman (1932) with Tom Mix, The All American (1932), Once in a Lifetime (1932), Strange Justice (1932), Women Won't Tell (1932) for Richard Thorpe, Afraid to Talk (1932) and Manhattan Tower (1932).\n\nBrennan was in Sensation Hunters (1933) for Charles Vidor, Man of Action (1933) with McCoy, Parachute Jumper (1933), Goldie Gets Along (1933), Girl Missing (1933), Rustlers' Roundup (1933) with Mix, The Cohens and Kellys in Trouble (1933) for director George Stevens, Lucky Dog (1933) and The Big Cage (1933). His scenes in William Wellman's Lilly Turner (1933) were deleted.\n\nBrennan did another serial, The Phantom of the Air (1933), then Strange People (1933) for Thorpe, Meet the Champ (1933, a short), Sing Sinner Sing (1933), One Year Later (1933), Sailors Beware! (1933, a short), Golden Harvest (1933), Ladies Must Love (1933), Saturday's Millions (1933), Curtain at Eight (1933) and My Woman (1933).\n\nJames Whale gave him a bit part in The Invisible Man (1933) and he could be seen in King for a Night (1933), Fugitive Lovers (1933), Cross Country Cruise (1934), Beloved (1934), You Can't Buy Everything (1934), Paradise Valley (1934), Radio Dough (1934, a short), The Poor Rich (1934), The Crosby Murder Case (1934), George White's Scandals (1934), Good Girl (1934), Riptide (1934), Uncertain Lady (1934), I'll Tell the World (1934) and Fishing for Trouble (1934, a short).\n\nBrennan was in the Three Stooges short Woman Haters (1934), then did Half a Sinner (1934), The Life of Vergie Winters (1934), Murder on the Runaway Train (1934), Whom the Gods Destroy (1934), Gentlemen of Polish (1934, a short), Death on the Diamond (1934), Great Expectations (1934), Luck of the Game (1934), Tailspin Tommy (1934, a serial), There's Always Tomorrow (1934) and Cheating Cheaters (1934).\n\nBrennan was back with McCoy for The Prescott Kid (1934) and could be seen in The Painted Veil (1934), Biography of a Bachelor Girl (1935), Helldorado (1935), Brick-a-Brac (1935) an Edgar Kennedy short, Northern Frontier (1935), The Mystery of Edwin Drood (1935) and Law Beyond the Range (1935) with McCoy. He also had a brief uncredited role in Bride of Frankenstein (1935) starring Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's monster.\n\nAround this time, Brennan received what he later described as \"the luckiest break in the world.\" He was acting in a fight scene when an actor kicked him in the face and knocked out all of his teeth. As a result, Brennan wore false teeth. He said, \"I looked all right off the set, but when necessary I could take 'em out and suddenly look about 40 years older.\"[5]\n\nBrennan appeared in another Three Stooges short, Restless Knights, and a short titled Hunger Pains in 1935.\n\nWork at MGM\n\n[edit]\n\nA break for Brennan came when he was cast in The Wedding Night (1935), produced by Sam Goldwyn, alongside Gary Cooper (it was actually their second film together). He was only an extra, but his part was expanded during filming and it resulted in Brennan's getting a contract with Goldwyn.[5][11][12]\n\nGoldwyn mostly loaned out Brennan's services to other studios. MGM put him in West Point of the Air (1935). He was reunited with Whale in Bride of Frankenstein (1935), in which he had a brief speaking part and also worked as a stuntman.\n\nBrennan's parts remained small in Party Wire (1935), Spring Tonic (1935), The Gay Lady (1935), Man on the Flying Trapeze (1935) and Welcome Home (1935). He did a short, The Perfect Tribute (1935) and was in George Stevens' Alice Adams (1935), but his scenes were deleted.\n\nHe could be seen in We're in the Money (1935) and She Couldn't Take It (1935).\n\nMove to supporting actor\n\n[edit]\n\nBrennan finally earned significant roles with a decent part in Goldwyn's Barbary Coast (1935), directed by Howard Hawks and an uncredited William Wyler.[13] \"That really set me up\", Brennan said later.[5]\n\nHe followed with small appearances in Metropolitan (1935) and Seven Keys to Baldpate (1935).\n\nHe had one of the leads in Three Godfathers (1936) playing one of the title outlaws.\n\nHe had a small role in These Three (1936) with Wyler and a larger one in Walter Wanger's The Moon's Our Home (1936) and Fury (1936), directed by Fritz Lang.\n\nFirst Oscar: Come and Get It (1936)\n\n[edit]\n\nBrennan's breakthrough part came when cast by Howard Hawks as Swan Bostrom in the period film Come and Get It (1936), playing the sidekick of Edward Arnold who eventually marries the girl Arnold abandons (played by Frances Farmer). Producer Sam Goldwyn fired Hawks during filming and replaced him with William Wyler. Brennan's performance earned him the first Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nBrennan followed it with support parts in Banjo on My Knee (1936) at Fox, She's Dangerous (1937), and When Love is Young (1937). Goldwyn announced him for a role in The Real Glory in 1936, but he ended up not appearing in the final film.[14]\n\nBrennan had his first lead role in Affairs of Cappy Ricks (1937) at Republic Pictures. He followed it with the co-starring part in Fox's Wild and Woolly (1937), billed second after Jane Withers. He was in The Buccaneer (1938), directed by Cecil B. DeMille.[15]\n\nBrennan portrayed town drunk and accused murderer Muff Potter in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1938).\n\nBrennan followed it with The Texans (1938), Mother Carey's Chickens (1938) and Goldwyn's The Cowboy and the Lady (1938) with Gary Cooper – the first time Brennan played Cooper's sidekick.\n\nSecond Oscar: Kentucky (1938)\n\n[edit]\n\nBrennan won his second Best Supporting Oscar for Kentucky (1938), a horse racing film from 20th Century Fox with Loretta Young.\n\nHe supported Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle (1939). Brennan also appeared in Melody of Youth (1939), and Stanley and Livingstone (1939) at Fox.[12] At MGM he was in Joe and Ethel Turp Call on the President (1939).\n\nThroughout his career, Brennan was frequently called upon to play characters considerably older than he was. The loss of many teeth in the 1932 accident, rapidly thinning hair, thin build, and unusual vocal intonations all made him seem older than he was. He used these features to great effect. In many of his film roles, Brennan wore dentures; in MGM's Northwest Passage (1940) – a film set in the late 18th century – he wore a dental prosthesis which made him appear to have rotting and broken teeth. Brennan was billed third in Northwest Passage after Spencer Tracy and Robert Young.\n\nZanuck at Fox announced he wanted to make The Man from Home, once a vehicle for Will Rogers, with Brennan.[16] Instead Brennan was top-billed in Fox's Maryland (1940), an attempt to repeat the success of Kentucky.[17] Brennan said he had been working constantly since Christmas 1937. \"I'm just plain punch drunk\", he said.[18]\n\nThird Oscar: The Westerner (1940)\n\n[edit]\n\nBrennan had one of his best roles in Goldwyn's The Westerner (1940), playing the villainous Judge Roy Bean opposite Gary Cooper. William Wyler directed and the film earned Brennan his third Best Supporting Actor Oscar within a five-year span.\n\nGoldwyn bought Trading Post as a vehicle for Brennan, but the film never materialized.[19]\n\nBrennan next supported Deanna Durbin in Nice Girl? (1941) and then Cooper again in Frank Capra's Meet John Doe (1941) and Hawks' Sergeant York (1941), a role that earned Brennan a fourth Oscar nomination. He could also be seen in This Woman is Mine (1941) as a sea captain.\n\nBrennan played the top-billed lead in Swamp Water (1941), the first American film by director Jean Renoir. He appeared in Rise and Shine (1941) and then played reporter Sam Blake in Pride of the Yankees (1942).\n\nBrennan appeared in the war films Stand By for Action (1942) and Hangmen Also Die! (1943), in which he played a Czech professor. He also appeared in Slightly Dangerous (1943), The Last Will and Testament of Tom Smith (1943) and Goldwyn's Russian war epic The North Star (1943).[20]\n\nHe was top-billed in a follow-up to Kentucky and Maryland at Fox, Home in Indiana (1944).\n\nBrennan was particularly skilled in playing the sidekick of the protagonist or the \"grumpy old man\" in films such as Hawks' To Have and Have Not (1944).\n\nBrennan was a comic pirate in the Bob Hope film The Princess and the Pirate (1944). He was teamed with John Wayne for the first time since both men had obtained stardom in Dakota (1945), directed by Joseph Kane. He supported Bette Davis in A Stolen Life (1946) and appeared in the Fox musical Centennial Summer (1946).\n\nWestern roles\n\n[edit]\n\nBrennan returned as a villain as Old Man Clanton in John Ford's My Darling Clementine (1946), opposite Henry Fonda. He followed this with parts in Nobody Lives Forever (1946) at Warner Bros.[21] and Republic's Driftwood (1947).\n\nHe appeared in another Americana film at Fox, Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay! (1948), and then in one of the greatest films in his career, Red River (1948), playing John Wayne's sidekick.\n\nAfter supporting Robert Mitchum in Blood on the Moon (1948), he played another kindly father role in The Green Promise (1949). Brennan was billed second to Rod Cameron in Brimstone (1949), and he supported Gary Cooper in Task Force (1949).\n\nBrennan focused on Westerns: Singing Guns (1950), A Ticket to Tomahawk (1950), Curtain Call at Cactus Creek (1950), The Showdown (1950), Surrender (1950), Along the Great Divide (1951), Best of the Badmen (1951) and Return of the Texan (1952).\n\nHe appeared in the war films The Wild Blue Yonder (1951) and Lure of the Wilderness (1952), a remake of Swamp Water in which he reprised his role, although with less screen time than in the original film.\n\nBrennan was in Sea of Lost Ships (1953) with John Derek, Drums Across the River (1954) with Audie Murphy, The Far Country (1954) with James Stewart and Four Guns to the Border (1954) with Rory Calhoun.[22] He also appeared in Bad Day at Black Rock (1955) for MGM.\n\nLater work\n\n[edit]\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nBrennan began to work on television, guest-starring on episodes of Screen Directors Playhouse, Lux Video Theatre, Schlitz Playhouse, Ethel Barrymore Theater, Cavalcade of America and The Ford Television Theatre. He played the old outlaw Joe in the 1956 episode \"Vengeance Canyon\" of Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre.[23]\n\nHe appeared as himself as a musical judge in the 1953–1954 ABC series Jukebox Jury. Brennan later said that he preferred television to films because there were not \"long layoffs between jobs.\"[11]\n\nHe continued to appear in movies such as Gunpoint! (1955) and The Proud Ones (1956) and was in a short film about Israel, Man on a Bus (1955).\n\nBrennan appeared in films such as Glory (1956), Come Next Spring (1956) and Batjac's Good-bye My Lady (1956) with 14-year-old Brandon deWilde, with whom he recorded The Stories of Mark Twain that same year.[24]\n\nHe appeared in The Way to the Gold (1957) and played Debbie Reynolds' grandfather in the romantic comedy Tammy and the Bachelor (1957).\n\nBrennan was given another lead role in God Is My Partner (1957), a low-budget film that became a surprise hit.[25]\n\nThe Real McCoys\n\n[edit]\n\nBrennan had resisted overtures to star in a regular TV series but relented for The Real McCoys, a sitcom about a poor West Virginia family that relocated to a farm in Southern California.[26] It was a hit and ran from 1957 to 1963.[27]\n\nBrennan continued to appear in films and other TV shows during the series' run such as Colgate Theatre and another Howard Hawks picture, Rio Bravo (1959), supporting John Wayne and Dean Martin.\n\nAfter five years on ABC, The Real McCoys switched to CBS for a final season. Brennan joined with series creator Irving Pincus to form Brennan-Westgate Productions.[24] The series was coproduced with Danny Thomas's Marterto Productions. It also featured Richard Crenna, Kathleen Nolan, Lydia Reed and Michael Winkelman.[28]\n\nFor Brennan Productions, Brennan starred in Shoot Out at Big Sag (1962). He appeared as a villainous river pirate in MGM's epic How the West Was Won (1963).\n\nSinging career\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing Brennan's success with The Real McCoys, he performed on several recordings. The most popular of these was \"Old Rivers\", a song about an old farmer and his mule. It was released as a single in 1962 by Liberty Records with \"The Epic Ride of John H. Glenn\" on the flip side. \"Old Rivers\" peaked at #5 on the U.S. Billboard chart, making the 67 year-old Brennan the oldest living person to have a Top 40 hit at the time.[29] At age 68, Brennan reached the Top 40 again, this time with \"Mama Sang a Song\" on November 17, 1962.\n\nAfter The Real McCoys ended, Brennan provided the voice for a cartoon of The Shooting of Dan McGrew.\n\nOther TV roles and Disney\n\n[edit]\n\nBrennan starred as the wealthy executive Walter Andrews in the short-lived 1964–1965 ABC series The Tycoon, with Van Williams.\n\nBrennan had a support part in Those Calloways (1965), his first Disney film, again paired with Brandon deWilde. He had a small role in The Oscar (1966).\n\nIn 1967, he starred in another ABC series, The Guns of Will Sonnett (1967–1969), as an older man in search of his gunfighter son. It ran for two seasons.[30]\n\nBrennan was top-billed in Disney's The Gnome-Mobile (1967) and made a pilot for the TV series Horatio Alger Jones, which did not become a series.[31]\n\nAfter a support role in Who's Minding the Mint? (1967), he returned to Disney for The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band (1968).\n\nBrennan had a part as the villain in Support Your Local Sheriff! (1969) with James Garner.\n\nLater career\n\n[edit]\n\nBrennan received top billing over Pat O'Brien in the TV movie The Over-the-Hill Gang (1969) and Fred Astaire in The Over-the-Hill Gang Rides Again (1970).,\n\nHe joined the second season of the CBS sitcom To Rome with Love (1969–1971) with John Forsythe.[32] This was Brennan's last television series as a member of the permanent cast, although he did make a number of appearances on Alias Smith and Jones.[33]\n\nAround this time he also starred in the TV movies The Young Country (1970), Two for the Money (1972) and Home for the Holidays (1972). He was announced for a Western that was not made, One Day in Eden.[33]\n\nHe started filming Herbie Rides Again (1973) for Disney but fell ill and was replaced.[34]\n\nBrennan's last screen appearance was in the Western Smoke in the Wind (1975), directed by Joseph Kane.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1920, Brennan married Ruth Caroline Wells. They had three children in their 54-year marriage: Arthur, Walter and Ruth.[35]\n\nIn 1940, Brennan purchased the 12,000-acre Lightning Creek Ranch, 20 miles north of Joseph, Oregon. He built the Indian Lodge Motel, a movie theater and a variety store in Joseph, and continued retreating to the ranch between film roles until his death. Some members of his family continue to live in the area.\n\nBrennan spent his last years mostly in retirement at his ranch in Moorpark in Ventura County, California. He died of emphysema on September 21, 1974, at the age of 80 in Oxnard, California.[36] His remains were interred at San Fernando Mission Cemetery in Los Angeles.[37]\n\nReligious and political views\n\n[edit]\n\nBrennan, a Roman Catholic, did not publicize his own religious affiliation, but declared in 1964, \"I'm too old not to be a religious fella... It appears we are losing something a lot of people made a lot of sacrifices for.\"[38] That year, Brennan spoke at Project Prayer, a rally attended by 2,500 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. The gathering, hosted by Anthony Eisley, sought to flood Congress with letters in support of school prayer following two decisions by the Supreme Court in 1962 and 1963 that had invalidated the practice of mandatory prayer in public schools, which the court ruled to have conflicted with the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.[38]\n\nAccording to his biographer Carl Rollyson, Brennan was fiercely opposed to communism and reportedly branded people as communists if they supported John F. Kennedy. Rollyson wrote that Brennan \"thought that the Watts riots could have been stopped 'with a machine gun'.\" Rollyson also reported that Brennan's home \"included a bunker stocked with weapons and food in anticipation of a Soviet invasion.\" Brennan reportedly expressed satisfaction at the murder of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., much to the shock of the cast and crew of The Guns of Will Sonnett, and also rejoiced in the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy.[39] Everett Greenbaum, who wrote 32 episodes of The Real McCoys, described Brennan as a bigot who frequently uttered racist remarks.[40]\n\nA staunch conservative Republican and a member of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, Brennan supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election because Goldwater had voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but Brennan later endorsed George Wallace in 1968, believing that Richard Nixon was too liberal for a Republican. In 1972, Brennan endorsed far-right candidate John Schmitz, who like Brennan, was a member of the John Birch Society. Brennan served as finance chairman and narrated advertisements in support of Schmitz's campaign.[41][42] Brennan also endorsed Ronald Reagan in the 1966 California gubernatorial election and in his reelection in 1970.[43][35]\n\nLegacy\n\n[edit]\n\nBrennan was one of the greatest character actors in motion picture history. While the roles that he played were diverse, he may be best remembered for his portrayals in Western films such as those of Judge Roy Bean in The Westerner, trail hand Nadine Groot in Red River and Deputy Stumpy in Rio Bravo. He was the first actor to win three Academy Awards and remains the only person to have won the Best Supporting Actor award three times. However, he remained somewhat embarrassed about how he had won the awards; in the early years of the Academy Awards, extras could vote, and Brennan was popular with the extras' union.[44] His third win prompted the disenfranchisement of the union from Oscar voting.[45] Following this change, Brennan failed to win the Oscar for his fourth Best Supporting Actor nomination in 1941 for Sergeant York. (The award went to Donald Crisp for How Green Was My Valley instead.)\n\nBrennan played more than 230 film and television roles during a career that spanned nearly five decades. For his contributions to the film industry, he has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6501 Hollywood Boulevard.[46] In 1970, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, where his photograph hangs prominently.[47]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1925 Webs of Steel Performer uncredited Lorraine of the Lions Minor role uncredited The Calgary Stampede Racing spectator uncredited 1926 Watch Your Wife Performer The Ice Flood Lumberjack uncredited Spangles Lunch counterman uncredited 1927 Sensation Seekers Below deck yacht crewman uncredited Tearin' Into Trouble Billy Martin The Ridin' Rowdy Performer Alias the Deacon Cashier at Cunningham's Rink uncredited Blake of Scotland Yard Henchman uncredited Hot Heels Pool hall inhabitant uncredited 1928 The Ballyhoo Buster Performer The Michigan Kid Minor role uncredited The Racket Man in front of barber shop uncredited 1929 Silks and Saddles Undetermined role uncredited The Cohens and Kellys in Atlantic City Man at police station uncredited Smilin' Guns Ranch Foreman The Lariat Kid Pat O'Shea His Lucky Day Roadhouse hhug uncredited Flight Marine pilot uncredited One Hysterical Night Paul Revere The Last Performance Clown uncredited The Long Long Trail Skinny Rawlins The Shannons of Broadway Hez 1930 Dames Ahoy!
