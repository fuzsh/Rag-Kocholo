        "text": "John Ford’s HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY(1941), being filmed on an 80 acre set in the Santa Monica mountains near Malibu.\n\nThe area in California is now the Malibu Creek State Park.\n\nI always remember the first time I saw this scene with the miners filing down the road past the houses, I thought I was in Wales!\n\nThe shot in the film; the miners, led by Donald Crisp, descend form the mine.\n\nThe design of the village set by art director Richard Day was based on actual Welsh villages in the Rhondda Valley.\n\nThe Morgan family, with Donald Crisp, Sara Allgood, Roddy McDowall and Maureen O’Hara.\n\nOn the set photo, with Patric Knowles, Sara Allgood, Anna Lee, Donald Crisp, Roddy McDowell, Maureen O’Hara, Walter Pidgeon (not in costume) and John Loder.\n\nWalter Pidgeon, as the minister, was borrowed from MGM and Donald Crisp was on loan from Warner Brothers.\n\nA company photo, with cast and crew. John Ford, Roddy McDowell, Donald Crisp, Sara Allgood, Rhys Williams.\n\nGreat cast, great film. One that lives in the memory.\n\nShould it have been in colour? Maybe.\n\nWere the accents a mixture of Scottish, Irish and English? Yes, but it didn’t harm the film (unless you are Welsh!)\n\nThe film won five Oscars including Best Picture, Director, Supporting actor (Donald Crisp), Best Art direction and cinematography.\n\nWas it better than THE LITTLE FOXES, THE MALTESE FALCON or CITIZEN KANE. Ah, that’s the question!"
