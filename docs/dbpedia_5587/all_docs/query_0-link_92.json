        "text": "Forever known as the movie that beat out “Citizen Kane” for the Best Picture Oscar in 1941, John Ford’s Welsh family saga, set in a nineteenth-century coal-mining village, resembles Orson Welles’s début in surprising ways. This, too, is a flashback movie, and one that captures an idyll of youth that has been lost to the corrosive practices of modern business. The story is told by the fifty-year-old Huw Morgan, who leaves a town that’s been destroyed—environmentally, morally, and socially—by its colliery. Huw recalls his childhood (he’s played by the young actor Roddy McDowall); his five strapping brothers and his father, miners all; his fierce and steadfast mother; and, most of all, his sister, Angharad (Maureen O’Hara), whose burgeoning romance with the hearty new pastor (Walter Pidgeon) is the backbone of the drama. Ford depicts a working-class solidarity based on morality, tradition, and community; he conveys his nuanced and tender sociology with surprising sound effects and expressionistic tableaux that feature the sort of angles that made Welles famous (and which the younger man borrowed, in turn, from Ford’s “Stagecoach”). (MOMA; Nov. 18)"
