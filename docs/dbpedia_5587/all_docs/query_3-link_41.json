Its index traces out many subjects in Ford, and in which films they occur. See also his web site.\n\nPlease mail your comments to me at mike@mikegrost.com. (Clicking here will bring up mail.)

So did another prolific Hollywood director, Allan Dwan. A number of running elements in their films are shared by both Ford and Dwan:\n\nVertical architecture, which the hero climbs up or down.\n\nWater technology.\n\nSand and dust.\n\nTheater.\n\nPresumptions of guilt which turn out to be false (Ford), falsely accused heroes become social outcasts (Dwan).\n\nSmall towns, viewed negatively.\n\nGlobes.\n\nStaging through doorways.\n\nFood: enjoyment of food in Dwan, food providers in Ford.\n\nTrenchcoats.\n\nWomen in men's clothes (Dwan), Women in feminized versions of menswear (Ford).\n\nMen with shirts off.\n\nSome of these might be broadly shared among other filmmakers as well, rather than being restricted to Ford and Dwan.\n\nStraight Shooting\n\nStraight Shooting (1917) is an early Western.\n\nConsidered as a movie, Straight Shooting is not very good:\n\nThe story is filled with cliched elements.\n\nCharacterization is poor: the characters have few individual traits, and rarely come alive.\n\nLeading man Harry Carey is lacking in charisma, talent, personality, looks or appeal.\n\nThe morality of the outlaw-turned-hero seems dubious.\n\nThe tale lacks humor.\n\nStraight Shooting seems basically like an apprentice work, something John Ford made while still learning his craft. It has some interesting material. It also has traces of visual approaches used in his later films.\n\nWater and Private Property\n\nThe villains are ranchers trying to drive farmers off their land. They try to do this in part by brute force, and partly by making water unavailable to the farmers. They post a sign saying a water source is private property.\n\nWater is a main theme running throughout John Ford, especially in his Westerns. Water sources and thirst play a big role in 3 Godfathers and Wagon Master.\n\nLate in his career, Ford will return to the subject of Straight Shooting in his Wagon Train episode The Colter Craven Story (1960). The villains in The Colter Craven Story are also holding water as private property rather than sharing it. They are making big money extracting huge prices from ordinary people needing water.\n\nThe sign in Straight Shooting explicitly uses the words \"Private Property\". Straight Shooting seems to be expressing skepticism about the concept of Private Property, especially when it comes to something as essential as water.\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath will contrast the banks and absentee landlords, who are the legal owners of the farm land, with the farm families who have worked the land for generations. It suggests the families should be the real owners of the land.\n\nUnfortunately, water and its supply and ownership are today bigger issues than ever. Ford's skepticism about private ownership of water supplies is more relevant than ever. So is his parallel concern with hunger in his non-Westerns.\n\nThe Heroine and Food\n\nOn of the best scenes in Straight Shooting has the heroine mourning her late brother, while setting his place at the table.\n\nThis scene draws on two key subjects in Ford:\n\nFamily meals.\n\nFood providers: the heroine is the one who makes the family's meals.\n\nSheriff Davies\n\nMost of the clothes in Straight Shooting are rough-looking working garb of the old West. An exception: Sheriff Davies is all done up in the sort of fancy garb that will later be worn by the heroes of singing cowboy movies. His costume is made more conspicuous, by being revealed when he takes off his rain slicker.\n\nSheriff Davies is just in two scenes, and plays little role there. Why is he dressed so spectacularly, and what is he doing in the film? Admittedly, there seems to be some missing footage in this saloon sequence in Straight Shooting; perhaps this footage gave the Sheriff a bigger or clearer role.\n\nWe do learn at the saloon scene's end that the Sheriff is a supporter of the rancher villain. This is perhaps an example of corrupt authority. Later, we see him cowering and holding back, when the hero and Placer have their Big Shoot-Out in the street.\n\nVertical Architecture\n\nDuring a big fight, characters escape from the second floor of the saloon, down to the street below. Such movement around vertical architecture runs through Ford's films. It is interesting to see it at this early date.\n\nSuch vertical movement also seems to have been fairly common in the 1910's, in other directors. Spectacular stunts up and down buildings and trees were a trademark of Douglas Fairbanks: see his films with Allan Dwan. Such stunts were ideally suited to silent film, being purely visual.\n\nThe Blankets and Geometry\n\nNative American Blankets are on the walls of the saloon behind the bar, and at the rancher villain's home. They add some vigorous geometric patterns to the shots. Ford occasionally liked to add some strong geometric figures to his compositions.\n\nFrontal Shooting\n\nFord, especially in his silents, sometimes shoots so that the plane of the screen is parallel to the back wall of the set. One gets some of this \"frontal shooting\" in Straight Shooting, in the saloon, the hotel lobby linked to the saloon, and in the villain rancher's home.\n\nSome of the shots of riders crossing the river, also seem shot in a such a \"frontal\" fashion, with the screen parallel to the stream.\n\nBucking Broadway\n\nBucking Broadway (1917) is a Western with much comedy and romance. It is also notable for its often beautiful visual style.\n\nA beautiful shot near the start has the hero sitting quietly on his horse, perched above a huge landscape. It anticipates the final credits of the TV series The Virginian (1962), showing the hero sitting quietly on his horse in front of a landscape. Both evoke awesome feelings of men contemplating nature.\n\nLinks to Up the River\n\nBucking Broadway has a certain resemblance to Ford's later Up the River. Both films:\n\nTake a serious genre, the Western in Bucking Broadway, the prison film in Up the River, and play ii for genial comedy.\n\nHave a scene where archetypal tough guys, cowboys in Bucking Broadway, convicts in Up the River, respond emotionally to a sentimental song. This is both humorous and touching.\n\nEventually put their heroes into a world where they are completely out of place, the big city in Bucking Broadway, a refined New England home in Up the River.\n\nArchitecture: Links to The Blue Eagle\n\nAspects of architecture anticipate The Blue Eagle:\n\nThe terrace at end is multi-level, like the ship deck at the start of The Blue Eagle. Both are scenes of crowds and fights.\n\nAt the train depot in the city, the cowboys are between a wall at one side and the train at the other. This recalls the repeated shots in The Blue Eagle, of the stokehold seen through the ladders. Both have a group of working men in a technical area, in a narrow long space between two walls.\n\nGay Subtext\n\nMuch of Bucking Broadway deals with heterosexual romance. But like much of Ford, there is also a gay subtext in Bucking Broadway.\n\nOne cowboy pats another cowboy on the butt, in an early shot. This scene features a prominent look at the men's attractive rears, done up in cowboy clothes.\n\nThe relationship between the hero and the rancher is an early example of Ford's interest in younger man / older man relationships. This is idealized and emotionally involving.\n\nWe also have the \"working class hero loving a heroine who loves a middle class man\" triangle that runs through Ford. Unlike later examples, there are no signs of gay attraction of the working class man to the middle class man. In fact, the middle class man is remarkably unattractive, unlike later Ford. He is a conventional ugly villain, complete with villain's mustache. Contrast him with the Adonis played by Randolph Scott in Born Reckless, for example.\n\nBoots\n\nThe villain's only attractive feature are the big riding boots he wears in the scene where he woos the heroine. The same actor (Vester Pegg) was booted when he played Placer Fremont in Straight Shooting.\n\nWhite Tie and Tails\n\nMany of the men in the final hotel sequence are in white tie and tails. They look terrific.\n\nUntil seeing Bucking Broadway and Upstream, I always thought that white tie was mainly absent from Ford films. And that he had as little interest in it as Joseph H. Lewis. By contrast, Vincente Minnelli loved white tie and tails, and it is virtually his signature style of dress for the men in his films. However it is not only aesthetes like Minnelli who favor tails. Directors often compared to Ford, Raoul Walsh and Allan Dwan, liked tails and regularly employed them in their films.\n\nFord's huge body of silent films are mainly either lost or inaccessible. Who knows how many or how few men in them wore tails? White tie and tails were immensely popular in silent films in general. Men are frequently in tails in The Craving (1919), a picture directed by and starring Ford's brother Francis Ford. Some sources list John Ford as co-director of this, although he denied it.\n\nBroadly speaking, white tie and tails is often a signifier of upper class status in film. It is worn by men who are rich and/or from the upper crust. See the District Attorney in Regeneration (Raoul Walsh, 1915). They also can be worn by men properly dressed for sophisticated theatrical events: the men at the ballet in Chapter 2 of Les Vampires (Louis Feuillade, 1915), the men at the concert in Trilby (Maurice Tourneur, 1915), the men at the concert in the Italian palace in Humoresque (Frank Borzage, 1920), the London theater g"
