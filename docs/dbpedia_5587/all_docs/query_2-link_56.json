        "text": "Unfairly derided as one of the most undeserving Best Picture winners, John Ford's gorgeous, heartbreaking portrait of a Welsh coal-mining community represents the best sort of cinema.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4.5/5 | Sep 18, 2023\n\nYou cannot translate something you do not know in your bones. Ford has made a sincere and, as I say, moving film of How Green Was My Valley; but something of the salt and wildness of the people about whom Richard Llewellyn wrote is gone.\n\nFull Review | Aug 8, 2022\n\nThe drama is no \"made up\" tale, but a panoramic glimpse of the small joys, the unmeasurable needs, the many griefs of a whole countryside. It is a story of life that is no more, but it is also a drama of people in every community.\n\nFull Review | Jul 26, 2022\n\nIt is a cinema masterpiece of rare beauty. It brings the same thrilling experience as reading a fine piece of poetry or looking at an exquisite painting. You feel that they have come from the heart.\n\nFull Review | Jul 26, 2022\n\nYoung Roddy McDowall is a lad of inestimable charm as Huw. Wide-eyed, sensitive, he is just the boy for the part. The cast is an altogether worthy one.\n\nFull Review | Jul 26, 2022\n\nHow Green Was My Valley isn't John Ford's most exciting movie, but it is his most beautiful, far and away. It really should be called a musical.\n\nFull Review | Jul 26, 2022\n\nAs the head of the Morgan clan, Mr. Crisp gives one of the best performances of this or any other year.\n\nFull Review | Jul 26, 2022\n\nThere has come along a great picture, a photoplay so monumental and so moving that it belongs high in the Hollywood aristocracy of all time. How Green Was My Valley is its name, and it is a thing of faith and beauty and enduring loveliness.\n\nFull Review | Jul 26, 2022\n\nMr. Donald Crisp, as the head of the Morgans, mining family, a patriarch with a touch of the Old Testament about him, does much to keep the film steady, and Miss Allgood, as his wife, gives it warmth and feeling.\n\nFull Review | Jul 26, 2022\n\nOne cannot but become enthusiastic over such a sincere rendition of life as this picture essays and it is astonishing how replete it is with popular appeal.\n\nFull Review | Jul 26, 2022\n\nThe picture is vastly entertaining, in the sense of tears, humanity and humor. It has moments of sheer beauty in the provincial music, coupled with the singing rhythm of the Welsh language that Llewellyn caught so magnificently in his novel.\n\nFull Review | Jul 26, 2022\n\nNow you're not a Welsh coal miner and I'm not either, and neither is that guy over there, but I daresay all of us will feel we have lived the experiences of How Green Was My Valley.\n\nFull Review | Jul 26, 2022\n\nIt amounts to an epochal cinema achievement, a masterpiece of direction and brilliant acting. But withal that it is a picture in which the elements are so mixed that its praises can hardly be sung without reservations.\n\nFull Review | Jul 26, 2022\n\nIn How Green Was My Valley, the emotional and melodramatic impact hits with terrific force because it is so real and so completely credible. The characters in the picture appear to be living their parts rather than acting them.\n\nFull Review | Jul 26, 2022\n\nMake no mistake about it: How Green Was My Valley, weaknesses and all, is a grand screen production. Its acting is magnificent and its direction is compelling without being pretentious.\n\nFull Review | Jul 26, 2022"
