        "text": "This review is for MovieRob’s July 2023 Genre Grandeur of Documentaries!\n\nIn my life at the movies (so far), no one film director has been as mysterious and complex as John Ford. It seems the more I learn about him, the less I actually know about him. I’ve read books, and seen documentaries, seen mini-featurettes about Ford, watched interviews with people who worked and knew him, and I come away from all of them both fascinated and confused all at the same time.\n\nIn 1971, director Peter Bogdanovich attempted to do what no person had done before, make a documentary about the all-American director of the 20th century. Until 2006, the documentary was scarce, but thanks to some revision, and rights handling issues, the restored and slightly re-cut, longer documentary premiered on TCM. For the purposes of this review, I will be referring to the 2006 version, as that’s the version that is available to watch today.\n\nTo start, Bogdanovich interviewed the three leading men who worked with Ford the most: James Stewart (3 movies), Henry Fonda (7), and of course, John Wayne (14, but more when you count the un-credited bit roles Wayne did for Ford). Interviews with Ford himself were also included, with more footage being included in the 2006 version, as Ford had passed by then. The revised edition also saw interviews, with Ford collaborators Maureen O’Hara and Harry Carey Jr., and directors Clint Eastwood, Martin Scorsese, and Walter Hill.\n\nWhile some of it was the standard working on set stories, and how Ford acted when cameras were not rolling, what was fascinating was the inclusion of his film clips, and how by watching and analyzing his films, you can actually learn everything you need to know about him. For instance, Ford frequently put music in his movies, with characters singing in Rio Grande (1950) and The Quiet Man (1952). This directly comes from Ford’s own real life interests, as there are stories of Maureen O’Hara saying at dinner at his house, she would have to sing before eating, or after a day on set, Ford would gather his company, the cast and the crew, and sing music around a campfire, or at the bar.\n\nJohn Wayne telling the story of how he first met Ford while at college at USC is a highlight, as it’s truly being told right in front of you, rather than just reading it in a Ford an/or Wayne biography. It was also very intriguing Henry Fonda agreed to be interviewed, considering the two had a personal and professional falling out during the marking of Mister Roberts (1955). Fonda spoke well of Ford, and did not even bring up the incident, so it was really cool to hear of the insights he had to offer about working for him.\n\nThen there were the scholarly reflections of the directors: Bogdanovich himself, Scorsese, Hill, and Eastwood. All of them talk about their memories of the first time watching a Ford picture, and how he has inspired their own work in the industry. Listening to their opinions of Ford as a director was fun, as they can really see a pattern or stand out elements of what makes Ford great, and it encourages the viewer to try to do the same when watching their next Ford film.\n\nTo me however, the biggest bombshell of this documentary was the added audio of Katharine Hepburn, visiting Ford when he was in ill-health. While Ford and Hepburn only worked on the 1936 box office bomb Mary of Scotland together, they had a short but passionate affair that affected them the rest of their lives. Dan Ford (a grandson), brought Hepburn to see Ford in 1973, and according to Bodganovich, the conversation was taped in Ford’s bedroom. At first the conversation is just talking about the old days: golf, the making of Mary of Scotland, then it turns intimate: Ford telling Kate he loves her, with Kate telling him, “it’s mutual“.\n\nBodganovich explains the tape was left running, recording them without their knowledge. This fact is backed up when you hear Ford ask if anyone is listening and Kate says, “No“.\n\nI was personally stunned by this, as I would never even think Ford and Hepburn felt that way towards one another. I had read previously the character Mary-Kate in The Quiet Man was named actually for Maureen O’Hara, herself, as she pointed out in her book: “Mary” was the English version of Maureen, and “Kate” was for what her father wanted to name her. As it turns out, there may be more to it, as the character Mary-Kate could be named for Ford’s wife, Mary, and Kate, as in Katharine Hepburn. What is it really? I personally don’t know what to go with. Maybe it’s both??"
