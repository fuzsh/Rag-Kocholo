        "meta_description": "On June 5, 1987, musician Willie Nelson became the first honoree of the Texas Walk of Stars with a ceremony outside the Driskill Hotel in Austin. Similar to the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Los Angeles, the Texas Walk of Stars pays tribute to Texans famous for their contributions to the arts, sciences, sports, and politics. It was started by the Sixth Street Conservation Society to promote local tourism and the history of the Sixth Street District. This video, likely produced by the Austin Chamber of Commerce captures the dedication ceremony, including performances by Floyd Tillman, Jerry Jeff Walker, and Nelson himself.",
