He began writing songs at a young age. He served in the U.S. Air Force before becoming a disc jockey in Texas, Oregon, and California and self-releasing his first recordings during the 1950s.\n\nBy 1961 Nelson was based in Nashville, Tennessee, and playing bass in Ray Price’s band. Price was among the first of dozens of country, rhythm-and-blues, and popular singers to achieve hit records with Nelson’s 1960s tunes, which included the standards “Hello Walls,” “Night Life,” “Funny How Time Slips Away,” and, most famously, “Crazy,” popularized by singer Patsy Cline. By contrast, Nelson achieved only modest success as a singer in that decade, though he became a member of the Grand Ole Opry in 1964.\n\nOutlaw country movement and mainstream success\n\nIn the early 1970s Nelson moved back to Texas, basing his career in Austin. Freeing himself from the constrictions of the mainstream Nashville milieu, Nelson grew his red hair long and traded in the suit jackets of traditional country stagewear at the time for faded denim outfits, bandannas, and braids. His new persona aligned him with the counterculture and attracted younger fans. With Waylon Jennings, he spearheaded the country music movement known as outlaw music, which sought to escape the formulaic approach of Nashville music and experiment with a hybrid rock and roots sound. Beginning with the narrative album Red Headed Stranger (1975), which featured the hit song “Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain,” Nelson became one of the most popular performers in country music. During this period he also established what would become a lifelong friendship with Pres. Jimmy Carter.\n\nNelson’s performances featured a unique sound, of which his relaxed behind-the-beat singing style and gut-string guitar were the most distinctive elements. Unusual for a country album, songs by Hoagy Carmichael, Irving Berlin, and other mainstream popular songwriters made up his Stardust (1978), which eventually sold more than five million copies in the United States. Nelson found further crossover success with the album Always on My Mind (1982) and the single “To All the Girls I’ve Loved Before” (1984), a duet with Julio Iglesias.\n\nAfter making his film acting debut in The Electric Horseman (1979), Nelson appeared in such movies as Honeysuckle Rose (1980)—which introduced what would become his signature song, “On the Road Again”—and Red Headed Stranger (1986), a drama based on his album. In 1985 Nelson participated in the USA for Africa famine-relief charity single “We Are the World” and was among the singers who had a solo part.\n\nLater career and albums\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nIn 1990 the Internal Revenue Service, claiming Nelson owed $16.7 million in unpaid taxes, seized his assets. To raise money, he recorded the album The IRS Tapes: Who’ll Buy My Memories (1991), which initially was available only through phone orders but was sold in stores beginning in 1992. Despite that setback, he continued to record at a prolific pace into the 21st century. His subsequent albums included Across the Borderline (1993), the atmospheric Teatro (1998), and the reggae-tinged Countryman (2005).\n\nAs Nelson aged into the role of a musical elder statesman, his recordings increasingly focused on traditional songs and covers. Among them were Heroes (2012); Let’s Face the Music and Dance (2013), a collection of standards; To All the Girls… (2013), a series of duets with female singers; and Summertime (2016), a set of George Gershwin songs. In 2014 Nelson issued Band of Brothers, which comprised largely new material, and Willie’s Stash, Vol. 1: December Day, the first in a series of releases from his vast catalog of recordings. The latter record focuses on his collaborations with his sister and pianist, Bobbie. God’s Problem Child (2017) and Last Man Standing (2018) are collections of original meditations on mortality.\n\nNelson’s later albums include My Way (2018) and That’s Life (2021), both of which pay tribute to Frank Sinatra, who influenced Nelson’s singing style. He followed up with Ride Me Back Home (2019); First Rose of Spring (2020); and A Beautiful Time (2022). In 2024 Nelson released his 75th studio album, The Border.\n\nThroughout his career Nelson has recorded with dozens of other singers such as Ray Charles and Sinéad O’Connor and released album-length collaborations with such musicians as Jennings, Merle Haggard, and jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis. On The Willie Nelson Family (2021), he worked with his children and Bobbie.\n\nOther projects\n\nIn addition to his own performance career, Nelson produces annual Fourth of July country music festivals in Texas and elsewhere, and in 1985 he cofounded Farm Aid, which organizes festivals to raise money for farmers. Nelson is a well-known and enthusiastic connoisseur of marijuana, and, after a few states legalized the drug’s sale and purchase, he launched (2015) a marijuana supply company, Willie’s Reserve.\n\nHe penned several memoirs (with coauthors), including Willie: An Autobiography (1988), Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die: Musings from the Road (2012), and It’s a Long Story: My Life (2015). Me and Sister Bobbie: True Tales of the Family Band (2020) was written by the siblings, and it chronicles their relationship. He also wrote (with Turk Pipkin) Willie Nelson’s Letters to America (2021), an epistolary collection that includes stories, advice, and jokes.\n\nHonors\n\nNelson has won more than 10 Grammy Awards and more than 10 Country Music Association (CMA) Awards. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1993 and accepted a Kennedy Center Honor in 1998. In 2012 the CMA presented him with its inaugural lifetime achievement award, which honors “an iconic artist who has attained the highest degree of recognition in Country Music.” Thereafter, the honor was renamed the Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award and has been bestowed on such country legends as Dolly Parton, Johnny Cash, and Charley Pride. In 2015 Nelson received the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2023.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica This article was most recently revised and updated by René Ostberg."
