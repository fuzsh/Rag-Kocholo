        "text": "A very special Austinite will celebrate his 91st birthday on Monday, so please join us in congratulating the one and only Willie Hugh Nelson.\n\nAustin has been proud to be one of Willie’s homes for so many years, so we’re sharing 91 facts about the legend: one for each year of his life.\n\nWillie Nelson has two birthdays — he celebrates on April 29 and 30 due to a clerical error on his birth certificate.\n\nHowever, Willie didn’t start celebrating both days until he turned 18.\n\nWillie was born in 1933 in the town of Abbott, Texas, which only had a population of about 326 people at the time.\n\nWillie’s cousin Mildred chose his name.\n\nWillie was raised by his grandparents, Alfred and Nancy Nelson, who both studied music.\n\nA lifelong performer, Willie got onstage for the first time when he was five years old to recite a poem.\n\nHe was so nervous to recite it, that he picked his nose until it bled and earned the nickname “Booger Red.”\n\nWillie was gifted his first guitar when he was 6 years old.\n\nWillie first learned to play “Amazing Grace” and wrote his first song when he was 7.\n\nAlongside his older sister, Bobbie, Willie grew up singing in his church choir.\n\nWillie joined his first band, Bohemian Polka, as a guitar player when he was 9.\n\nWillie went to Abbott High School and played as a halfback on the football team.\n\nWillie raised pigs for Future Farmers of America while in school.\n\nAt 13, Willie had already played with Bob Wills, the “King of Western Swing.”\n\nWillie graduated high school in 1950 and joined the U.S. Air Force.\n\nHe was later discharged due to back problems.\n\nWillie was first married in 1952, to Martha Matthews.\n\nWillie attended Baylor University but dropped out after two years due to his musical success.\n\nWhile at Baylor, Willie joined the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity.\n\nWillie once moved to San Diego to get a job but was unable to find one, so he hitchhiked to Portland, Oregon, where his mother lived.\n\nNo one picked him up, so he slept in a ditch to wait for a freight train.\n\nThroughout the 1950s, Willie worked as a disc jockey while also performing as a singer-songwriter.\n\nWillie has held a lot of odd jobs, including saddle maker, vacuum cleaner, plus encyclopedia and Bible salesman.\n\nHis first album, “...And Then I Wrote,” was released in 1962.\n\nThe contract allowed him to join Ray Price’s band as a bassist.\n\nWillie moved to Nashville in 1960 and signed a contract with Pamper Music.\n\nWillie married his second wife, Shirley Collie, in 1962.\n\nWillie signed with RCA Victor and joined the Grand Ole Opry in 1964.\n\nTired of the corporate music scene in Nashville, Willie moved to Austin in the early 1970s.\n\nWillie didn’t feel his brand of “outlaw country” fit in Nashville’s scene.\n\nAustin’s hippie scene was burgeoning at the time and Willie became a staple at the now-closed Armadillo World Headquarters.\n\nHe tried to retire shortly after moving, paying $14,000 to end his contract, but it didn’t last.\n\nWillie began to grow out his hair and beard after moving to Austin.\n\nWillie held his first annual Fourth of July Picnic in Austin in 1973.\n\nWillie signed with Atlantic Records as the label’s first country artist in 1973.\n\nHe formed his band, The Family, the same year.\n\nWillie didn’t try marijuana until he was 21 years old and even then, he refused it the first time.\n\nWillie starred in “The Electric Horseman” alongside Jane Fonda and Robert Redford in 1979.\n\nThe next year, he starred in the film “Honeysuckle Rose.”\n\nWillie has done crazy things for weed, including running into his burning house to save his stash.\n\nIt wasn’t just for the love of weed — Willie wanted to avoid the stash being found by police.\n\nAfter all, Willie has been arrested multiple times for possession of marijuana.\n\nWillie once smoked a joint on the roof of the White House with Jimmy Carter’s son, Chip.\n\nWhile there, he performed a duet with First Lady Rosalynn Carter.\n\nHe once tried to smoke a joint on the roof of the Governor’s Mansion, but was caught.\n\nWillie has famously out-smoked Snoop Dogg and maintains a firm friendship with the rapper.\n\nThe pair wrote the songs “Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die” and “My Medicine” together.\n\nWillie has his own brand of marijuana, called Willie’s Reserve.\n\nWillie is a huge advocate for marijuana legalization and sits as co-chair on the advisory board of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.\n\nWillie’s smoking days largely ended in 2019 due to health issues.\n\nWillie’s house fire, which happened in 1980, destroyed his Nashville home.\n\nThe one other object he was able to save was his beloved guitar, Trigger.\n\nWillie bought Trigger in Nashville from a man named Shot Jackson in 1969.\n\nTrigger has been used in more than 10,000 shows across more than 50 years.\n\nTrigger got its name from Roy Roger’s horse.\n\nTrigger is decorated with celebrity signatures, the first of which was Leon Russell.\n\nMore than a hundred yet-to-be-recorded songs were lost in the fire.\n\nWillie moved to Columbia Records in 1975.\n\nWillie’s smash-hit album, “Red Headed Stranger,” was released in 1975.\n\nIn the summer of 1977, Willie discovered his manager, Neil Reshen, had been filing tax extensions and not paying the IRS.\n\nBoth of Willie’s 1978 albums went platinum.\n\nThey were “Waylon & Willie” and “Stardust.”\n\n“Stardust” spent two years on the Billboard 200 list.\n\n“Stardust” also spent 540 weeks on various country music lists.\n\nWillie’s 1980 hit, “On the Road Again,” was written on the back of a barf bag while on an airplane.\n\nWillie continued to top the charts with “Pancho & Lefty” in 1982, which he released with Merle Haggard and Chips Moman.\n\nThe album won three Grammys and went quadruple platinum.\n\nWillie’s first book, “Willie: An Autobiography,” was released in 1988.\n\nIn 1990, the IRS raided Willie’s house to seize assets.\n\nWhen the IRS raided, Willie mailed Trigger to his daughter in Hawaii for safekeeping.\n\nWillie originally owed $32 million; after the seizure, the IRS charged him $16.7 million.\n\nIn order to pay his debt, Willie released two-disc acoustic album “The IRS Tapes: Who’ll Buy My Memories?”\n\nThe situation with the IRS was settled in 1993.\n\nHis bill was one of the largest in IRS history.\n\nWillie was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1993.\n\nWillie’s next book, “The Facts of Life: And Other Dirty Jokes,” was released in 2002.\n\nWillie appeared on Ringo Starr’s 2003 album, “Ringo Rama.”\n\nIn Willie’s opinion, Django Reinhardt is the greatest guitar player of all time.\n\nOver the years, Willie has been featured on shows including “Miami Vice,” “The Simpsons,” “Monk,” and “King of the Hill.”\n\nWillie has acted in more than 30 films.\n\nWillie’s second book, “Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die: Musings from the Road,” was published in 2012.\n\nHe’s had three more books published since then — “It’s a Long Story: My Life” and “Pretty Paper,” both with David Ritz, and novel “A Tale Out of Luck” with Mike Blakely.\n\nWillie at one point had a biodiesel brand, BioWillie, made from vegetable oil.\n\nWillie is honorary chairman of the advisory board of the Texas Music Project, the official Texas music charity.\n\nWillie has a ranch where he lets horses run free in Hawaii, where he spends most of his time.\n\nWillie hosts two annual festivals — Luck Reunion and Lucktoberfest — at his Luck, Texas ranch.\n\nWith the album, “Late Night Willie Nelson,” Willie now has 103 albums in his discography.\n\nWillie performed at the Moody Center’s grand opening with George Strait on both of his birthdays.\n\nIn the summer of 2021 during a concert at the Texas Capitol, Willie winked at City Editor Laura Figi.\n\nIn February 2023, Willie was nominated to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nOn Beyoncé's hotly anticipated “Cowboy Carter” album, Willie Nelson is featured on an aptly-named interlude called “SMOKE HOUR ★ WILLIE NELSON.”"
