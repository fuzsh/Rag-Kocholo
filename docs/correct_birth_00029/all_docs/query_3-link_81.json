        "text": "Willie Nelson remains one of our most popular entertainers, decades after he got his start in the music business, both as a songwriter and a singer. Our trivia question today is what is Willie Nelson's actual first name? Is it Willie, Will, William or Wilbur?\n\nAnswer:\n\nWillie Nelson was born in Abbott, Texas in 1933. His parents had moved from Arkansas looking for work. One of Willie's grandfathers was named William; a cousin suggested the baby be named Willie and that's what happened. That same cousin gave Willie his middle name, Hugh, in honor of her recently deceased brother. The cousin may have had that much influence since Willie's mother left soon after he was born. It wasn't long before his father remarried, leaving Nelson and his sister to be raised by their grandparents. The grandparents had taught music in Arkansas and gave their grandchildren a background in music. Willie's grandfather bought him a guitar when he was six. A year later, Willie wrote his first song. While still in school, he sang and played guitar in a band.\n\nSummers in the Nelson family involved picking cotton, something Willie hated. From the age of 13, he earned money by singing in dance halls and taverns. Willie Nelson had several jobs and moved to several locations while trying to earn a decent living. One of those locations was Springfield, Missouri when Nelson failed to land a spot on the Ozark Jubilee. Eventually Nelson made his way to Nashville, where he performed mostly his own songs at Tootsie's Orchid Lounge near the Grand Ole Opry. That led to some Opry stars hearing Nelson's songs and recording them, including \"Funny How Time Slips Away\" and \"Pretty Paper\".\n\nNelson met Charlie Dick, Patsy Cline's husband, at Tootsie's. Dick liked Nelson's songs and brought Willie's demo tape of one of them to his wife. Patsy Cline immediately liked Willie's song \"Crazy\" and decided to record it. \"Crazy\" became the biggest jukebox hit of all time."
