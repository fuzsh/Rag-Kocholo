        "text": "Biography\n\nSinger, songwriter, actor and philanthropist Willie Nelson was born on April 30, 1933, in Abbott, Texas. During his extensive career, Willie Nelson has written more than 2,500 songs and has released close to 300 albums. He has won multiple awards, including countless Grammys, American Music Awards and Country Music Awards. In 2012 the Country Music Association honored Nelson with an all-star tribute at the CMAs in Nashville. He is recognized worldwide as an American troubadour and icon, transcended musical genres and has remained relevant through five decades for his music, acting, and as the face of such social causes as Farm Aid and the development of bio-diesel.\n\n<< Back to 2000-2009\n\nWere you at the Mabee Center Arena in Tulsa when Willie Nelson performed?
