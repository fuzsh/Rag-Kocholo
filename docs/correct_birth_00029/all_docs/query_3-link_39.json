        "text": "Willie Nelson celebrated his 90th birthday this year, and it should come as no surprise that the country music icon has kept the party going. The 12-time Grammy Award winner was recently joined by his friends, family, and the biggest stars of the country music industry for Willie Nelson's 90th Birthday Celebration on CBS. But some fans might be surprised to learn that the \"On the Road Again\" singer actually has two birthdays, and neither one is in December.\n\nWillie was born in 1933 in Abbott, Texas, a small town about 25 miles north of Waco. His actual birthday is April 29, but, because he was born so late at night, the country clerk wasn't able to record it. So, on paper, his birthday is April 30. Willie explained, \"I was born before midnight on the 29th but it didnâ€™t get registered in the county courthouse until the next day, the 30th. So, it went out officially as the 30th. So I just do both days.\"\n\nWith a storied career like Willie's, it's certainly worth a double celebration! His 90th birthday got special recognition with a star-studded concert, which aired on Sunday, December 17. Did you miss it? It's now available to stream on .\n\nThe event featured performances by Willie, Beck, Sheryl Crow, Snoop Dogg, Norah Jones, Miranda Lambert, Dave Matthews, Willie's sons Lukas Nelson and Micah Nelson, George Strait, Chris Stapleton, and more. The special is hosted by Jennifer Garner, Chelsea Handler, Woody Harrelson, Ethan Hawke, Helen Mirren, and Owen Wilson.\n\nIf that's not enough, is airing a 4-part docuseries Willie & Family, beginning on December 20."
