        "meta_description": "thefrankaugust on January 31, 2024: \"AMERICAN CREATORS | Willie Nelson, Abbott, Texas, 1933 -\n\nCreation: Red Headed Stranger, 1975\n\nWillie Nelson arguably has one of the most recognizable names and personas in the music industry. Born in Abbott, Texas during the Great Depression, Nelson developed a love for music by age 6, thanks to his grandparents who taught him to play the guitar. By age 7, he had already written his first song.\n\nNelson went on to develop a reputation for himself in the 1960s as a notable member of the outlaw country music scene in Nashville, Tennessee – a sub-genre of country music that actively protested against the mainstream sound.\n\nOne of Nelson’s most famous albums was Red Headed Stranger, which marked the beginning of a new era, announcing the arrival of the country-artist-as-auteur concept. It played a significant role in popularizing the progressive country movement and put Austin on the map as a music capital. Notably, it also became Willie Nelson’s breakthrough, with his first chart-topping hit, “Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain,” which also crossed over to the pop charts.\n\nIt’s impossible to talk about Nelson’s long life and not mention his love for cannabis. It all started at a roadside bar in Fort Worth, Texas in 1954. At the time, Nelson was 21 and a big bourbon drinker when his friend and fellow musician Fred Lockwood suggested they “blow tea.” Now at 90 years old, Nelson has famously out-smoked Snoop Dogg and maintains a firm friendship with the rapper, even co-writing two songs together. In a tell-all interview Nelson did with GQ back in 2015, he also confirmed that he did, in fact, smoke a joint on the roof of the White House with Jimmy Carter’s son, Chip.\n\nIn February 2023, Willie was nominated to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\".",
