        "text": "Willie Nelson\n\nProfession: Country Singer and Songwriter\n\nBiography: An American country music singer and songwriter, Willie Nelson is also an author, poet, actor, and activist.\n\nThe critical success of the album Shotgun Willie (1973), combined with commercial successes of Red Headed Stranger (1975) and Stardust (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music.\n\nHe was one of the main figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s in reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound.\n\nPrior to his success as a recording artist, he gained notice in music circles for his songwriting, penning the hits \"Hello Walls\", \"Funny How Time Slips Away\" , \"Pretty Paper\", and, most famously, \"Crazy\".\n\nNelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana.\n\nHe was one of the organizers of Farm Aid, an all-star benefit concert for American farmers in 1985.
