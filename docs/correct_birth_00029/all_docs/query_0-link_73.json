        "text": "Music Career\n\nBy 1961 Nelson was based in Nashville, Tennessee, and playing bass in Ray Price’s band. Price was among the first of dozens of country, rhythm and blues, and popular singers to achieve hit records with Nelson’s 1960s tunes. These included the standards “Hello Walls,” “Night Life,” “Funny How Time Slips Away,” and “Crazy.” By contrast, Nelson achieved only modest success as a singer in that decade. He made his debut at Nashville’s Grand Ole Opry on November 28, 1964.\n\nDisillusioned with Nashville commercialism, Nelson returned to Texas in the 1970s. With Waylon Jennings, he spearheaded the country music movement known as outlaw music. Outlaw music mixed folk’s self-examining lyrics, rock’s rhythms, and country’s instrumentation. Beginning with his 1975 album Red Headed Stranger, with its hit song “Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain,” Nelson became one of country music’s most popular performers. His 1978 album Stardust featured songs by Hoagy Carmichael, Irving Berlin, and other mainstream popular songwriters. It eventually sold more than five million copies. Nelson found further crossover success with the album Always on My Mind (1982) and the single “To All the Girls I’ve Loved Before” (1984), a duet with Julio Iglesias.\n\nIn 1985 Nelson cofounded Farm Aid, which organized festivals to raise money for struggling family farmers. Five years later the Internal Revenue Service claimed that Nelson owed millions of dollars in unpaid taxes. To raise money, he recorded the album The IRS Tapes: Who’ll Buy My Memories. It was first released through phone orders in 1991 and then in stores the next year. Despite that setback, he continued to record at a fast pace into the 21st century. His subsequent albums included Across the Borderline (1993), Teatro (1998), Countryman (2005), and Moment of Forever (2008).\n\nAs Nelson aged, he increasingly focused on traditional songs and covers. In 2013 he released Let’s Face the Music and Dance, a collection of standards, and To All the Girls…, a series of duets with female singers. In 2014 Nelson issued Band of Brothers, which comprised largely new material. That same year he released Willie’s Stash, Vol. 1: December Day, the first in a series to collect some of his vast recordings. It focused on his collaborations with his sister, Bobbie Nelson, who was also his longtime pianist. The album Summertime (2016) featured a set of George Gershwin songs. Nelson subsequently released two collections of original meditations on mortality, God’s Problem Child (2017) and Last Man Standing (2018). His later albums include Ride Me Back Home (2019), First Rose of Spring (2020), That’s Life (2021), and A Beautiful Time (2022).\n\nOther Interests and Accomplishments\n\nBesides singing, Nelson acted on television and in movies. He made his film debut in The Electric Horseman (1979), followed closely by Honeysuckle Rose (1980) and Barbarosa (1982). He also had a part in Red Headed Stranger (1986), a drama based on his album. Nelson’s later films included Wag the Dog (1997), The Dukes of Hazzard (2005), and Waiting for the Miracle to Come (2017). His television movies included Stagecoach (1986), The Long Kill (1999), and The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning (2007).\n\nNelson had other interests besides performing. In 2015 he launched a marijuana supply company called Willie’s Reserve. He also cowrote several memoirs, including Willie: An Autobiography (1988), Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die: Musings from the Road (2012), and It’s a Long Story: My Life (2015). Willie Nelson’s Letters to America (2021), which Nelson cowrote with Turk Pipkin, contains stories, advice, and jokes.\n\nNelson received several Grammy Awards during his long career in music. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1993. He accepted a Kennedy Center Honor in 1998. In 2015 he received the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song."
