        "text": "Who is Willie Nelson?\n\nWillie Hugh Nelson is an American musician, actor, and activist.\n\nWillie was raised by his grandparents, wrote his first song at age seven and joined his first band at ten.\n\nHe is one of the most recognised artists in country music, thanks to the success of his 1973 album Shotgun Willie, combined with the success of Red Headed Stranger in 1975, and Stardust in 1978.\n\nWillie was one of the main figures of outlaw country, a sub-genre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound.\n\nTragic Details About Willie Nelson\n\nThe singer has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalisation of marijuana.\n\nHe even owns the bio-diesel brand Willie Nelson Biodiesel, which is made from vegetable oil.\n\nThe singer is widely recognised as an American icon, inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1993, receiving the Kennedy Centere Honours in 1998, inducted to the National Agricultural Hall of Fame in 2011, and winning the Gershwin Prize in 2015.\n\nIn 2018 The Texas Institute of Letters inducted him among its members for his songwriting, before being included in Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Singers and 100 Greatest Guitarists lists.\n\nHow old is Willie Nelson?\n\nWillie Nelson was born on April 29, 1933. Willie celebrated his 88th birthday in 2021.\n\nWhere was Willie Nelson born and does he have siblings?\n\nWillie Nelson was born in Abbott, Texas, on April 29, 1933.\n\nHis parents were Myrle Marie (née Greenhaw) and Ira Doyle Nelson.\n\nHe was named Willie by his cousin Mildred, who also chose Hugh as his middle name, in honour of her recently deceased younger brother.\n\nHis parents moved to Texas from Arkansas in 1929 to look for work.\n\nHis grandfather, William, worked as a blacksmith, while his father worked as a mechanic.\n\nHis mother left soon after he was born, and his father remarried and also moved away, leaving Willie and his sister Bobbie to be raised by their grandparents.\n\nWillie's grandparents taught singing back in Arkansas and introduced their grandchildren in music.\n\nWillie's grandfather bought him a guitar when he was aged six, and taught him a few chords, writing his first song aged seven.\n\nIs Willie Nelson married and does he have any children?\n\nWillie Nelson has been married four times and has seven children.\n\nHis first marriage was to Martha Matthews from 1952 to 1962, with the couple having three children together: Lana, Susie, and Willie \"Billy\" Hugh, Jr. - sadly the latter died by suicide in 1991.\n\nUnfortunately Willie and Martha's marriage was marked by violence, with Martha assaulting Willie several times, including one incident when she sewed him up in bedsheets and beat him with a broomstick.\n\nWillie's second marriage was to Shirley Collie in 1963.\n\nWillie Nelson - Have You Ever Seen the Rain (Audio) ft. Paula Nelson\n\nThe couple divorced in 1971, after Shirley found a bill from the maternity ward of a Houston hospital charged to Willie and Connie Koepke for the birth of Paula Carlene Nelson.\n\nWillie married Connie the same year, and they had another daughter together, named Amy Lee Nelson.\n\nFollowing a divorce in 1988, he married his current wife, Annie D'Angelo, in 1991.\n\nWillie and Annie have two sons, Lukas Autry and Jacob Micah.\n\nWhich songs are Willie Nelson best known for?\n\nWillie Nelson - On The Road Again (Official Audio)\n\nWillie has a huge catalogue of songs and is known for several big hits... here's just a few of the songs he is known for.\n\nA talented songwriter and guitarist, Willie is best known for 'On The Road Again'\n\nThe 1980's song was written mid-flight as the theme song for Honeysuckle Rose, a 1980 film about an outlaw country singer who didn’t quite make it to the top, which stared Willie himself.\n\nThe song became Nelson's ninth number one country hit, and was a top 20 pop hit as well.\n\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone ranked it among the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nWillie Nelson - Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain\n\nWillie also wrote 'Crazy', which became a career-changing hit for Patsy Cline in 1961, the same year that Willie wrote it.\n\nWillie wrote 'Crazy' when he was still a struggling songwriter, and pitched it to Patsy's husband after running into him at Nashville's famed Tootsie's Orchid Lounge.\n\nThe songwriter later recorded and released his own rendition of the song.\n\nOther notable songs by Willie include 'Angel Flying Too Close To The Ground', 'Night Life', 'Me and Paul', and 'Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain'.\n\nWho has Willie Nelson collaborated with?\n\nDolly Parton & Willie Nelson - Everything's Beautiful (In It's Own Way)\n\nWillie Nelson has collaborated with a whole plethora of artists throughout his career.\n\nHere are just some of his most memorable collaborations.\n\nWillie released a song with Waylon Jennings called 'Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Life)' in 1977.\n\nWillie Nelson - Seven Spanish Angels (Video)\n\nThe following year, the pair released 'Mammas, Don’t Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys'.\n\nIn 1985, Willie released 'I Told a Lie to My Heart' with Hank Williams.\n\nDespite Hank passing away in 1953, Willie used Hank's original recording, believed to be a songwriting demo, for his 1985 song.\n\nWillie teamed up in 1984 with Ray Charles for 'Seven Spanish Angels'.\n\nSeveral other stars that Willie has collaborated with includes Dolly Parton, Shirley Collie, George Jones, Ray Price, Julio Iglesias, Hank Williams, Jr., Reba McEntire, Merle Haggard, Tom Petty, Reverend Ike, Bob Dylan, Loretta Lynn, Toby Keith, Lee Ann Womack, Snoop Dogg and Kacey Musgraves.\n\nWhat is Willie Nelson's net worth?\n\nWillie Nelson has a net worth of $25 million in 2020, according to reports.\n\nLoretta Lynn - Lay Me Down (Official Music Video) ft. Willie Nelson\n\nWhy is Willie Nelson only worth $25 million, despite all of his record sales and tours? What happened with the IRS?\n\nWillie Nelson is worth a staggering $25 million, however, it could have been a much higher figure.\n\nIn 1990, the IRS seized most of Willie's assets, claiming that he owed $32 million.\n\nThe IRS claimed he had unpaid taxes, with Willie also having made weak investments in the 1980s which made his situation worse.\n\nIn 1978, after he fired manager Neil Reshen, Willie was introduced by Dallas lawyer Terry Bray to the accounting firm Price Waterhouse.\n\n1992 Willie Nelson Memories IRS Tapes Commercial\n\nTo repay the debt Neil had created with the IRS, Willie was recommended to invest in tax shelters that ultimately flopped.\n\nWhile the IRS disallowed his deductions for 1980, 1981 and 1982, due to penalties and interests, the debt increased by the end of the decade.\n\nHis lawyer, Jay Goldberg, negotiated the sum to be lowered to $16 million.\n\nLater, Willie's attorney renegotiated a settlement with the IRS in which he paid $6 million, although Nelson did not comply with the agreement.\n\nWillie Nelson - Always On My Mind (Official Music Video)\n\nWillie released The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories? as a double album, with all profits destined for the IRS.\n\nMany of his assets were auctioned and purchased by friends, who donated or rented his possessions to him for a nominal fee.\n\nHe sued Price Waterhouse, contending that they put his money in illegal tax shelters.\n\nThe lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount and Willie cleared his debts by 1993."
