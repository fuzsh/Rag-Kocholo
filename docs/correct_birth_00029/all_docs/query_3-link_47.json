        "text": "History highlight:\n\nWillie Hugh Nelson was born on this day in 1933, making him 91 today. One of the most popular country figures of all time — especially in the \"outlaw country\" subgenre — he has released 100 studio albums (consisting of 74 solo studio albums and 26 collaborative studio albums), 14 live albums, 51 compilation albums, and 41 video albums. He has acted in more than 30 films, and he is widely known for his activism and political views — mainly supporting the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana. He has won many, many awards in his lifetime; he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1993, and he received the Kennedy Center Honors in 1998. He's still going strong.
