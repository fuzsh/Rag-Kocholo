        "text": "Willie Nelson is a country music icon. A unique and versatile artist, his innovative songwriting has resulted in No. 1 hits for dozens of artists – including more than twenty for himself – and a recorded output that is “so vast,” music journalist Bob Allen writes, “as to confound all but the most dedicated discographers.”\n\nBorn in central Texas, Willie Hugh Nelson grew up singing gospel music in the Baptist Church with his sister and long-time pianist, Bobbie. The two were raised by their grandparents, who encouraged them to play music, enrolling Willie in mail-order lessons at age six. He wrote his first song when he was seven and began playing in a local band at age nine. Willie didn’t like picking cotton so, to help earn money, he began playing at dance halls and honky tonks with local German and Czech polka bands, from age 13 through high school. He was quite successful (local girls founded the Willie Nelson Fan Club), but stayed in Abbot High in order to compete in sports — as a football halfback, a basketball guard, and a baseball shortstop. To make extra money, he booked other acts at venues close to his home, including some of his musical idols.\n\nEarly in my life, I was a young promoter. I was putting together shows. Bob Wills, I hired for seven hundred and fifty dollars to play over in Whitney, Texas. I hauled a piano on the back of a pickup over, so that his band could have a piano. I managed to take in enough money and pay him. But I was only like fourteen, fifteen years old. And I got up to sing with Bob Wills! So, it was as good as it gets.\n\nNelson moved to Nashville in 1960 after his composition “Family Bible” became a hit for Claude Gray. With help from fellow songsmith Hank Cochran, Willie got work as a staff writer for Pamper Music and quickly established himself as one of the most talented songwriters in the business, scoring with enormous hits like “Crazy” (Patsy Cline), “Funny How Time Slips Away” (Billy Walker), and “Hello Walls” (Faron Young). His unique singing style, however – with behind-the-beat phrasing and unadorned vocals – was less appreciated, and Nelson eventually found himself tiring of rejection and longing for a place where he could be himself.\n\nWillie moved back home to Texas in 1972. He let his hair and his beard grow long, wrote and sang the way he wanted, and – after signing with Columbia Records and gaining complete creative control over his records in 1975 – brought his own band into the studio. His debut release for the label, The Red Headed Stranger, was a minimalist concept album, recorded at Autumn Sound Studios in a suburb of Dallas, with help from engineer Phil York. It was a huge hit, thanks in part to Nelson’s spare cover of Fred Rose’s “Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain.” His brand of country – by then known as “Outlaw” – had become a sensation. Nelson would follow with LPs that revealed his versatility and wide-ranging interests, including collaborations with artists like Merle Haggard and Waylon Jennings, and 1978’s Stardust, a collection of classic pop songs that sold four million copies, garnered him a new audience, and is still considered one of his best works.\n\nNelson’s awards are numerous, including 11 CMAs, 12 GRAMMYs, and 6 ACMs. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1993, received the GRAMMY Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999, and won the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize in 2015. In 2003, CMT placed him at No. 4 among the “Greatest Men of Country.” And, in 2008, his distinctive vocal style – once considered a deficit – earned him the No. 88 spot on Rolling Stone magazine’s list of 100 Greatest Singers of All Time.\n\nBorn: April 29, 1933, Abbott, Texas"
