Central Texas music legend Willie Nelson is celebrating his 91st birthday on Monday.

Nelson was born in 1933 in Abbott, Texas, a small town about 25 miles north of Waco.

His actual birthday is April 29, but he was born so late at night that the county clerk wasn't able to record it so, on paper, his birthday is April 30.

He says he celebrates both days.
