The distribution of shares was made in book-entry form.\n\nTime Warner shareholders did not receive fractional shares of Time Inc. common stock in the distribution.\n\nThe number of shares of Time Warner common stock that you own did not change as a result of the distribution of Time Inc. shares. However, the distribution likely caused the trading price of your Time Warner shares to be lower than the trading price prior to the distribution because the post-distribution price no longer reflects the value of the Time Inc. shares that were held by Time Warner.\n\nPlease see below for more information.\n\nPress Releases\n\nCertain press releases related to the Time Warner Inc. â€“ Time Inc. Separation\n\nTime Warner Inc. Completes Spin-Off of Time Inc. (June 9, 2014)\n\nTime Warner Declares Spin-off Dividend of Time Inc. Shares (May 8, 2014)\n\nTime Warner Inc.
