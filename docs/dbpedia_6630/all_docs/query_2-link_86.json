        "text": "NEW YORK — The world's largest media company changed its name Thursday, removing three letters that had become associated with the failed dreams of the Internet: A-O-L.\n\nFrom now on, AOL Time Warner Inc. will be known simply as Time Warner Inc.\n\nIts logo, the name of its new headquarters building, and even its ticker symbol will change, from \"AOL\" to \"TWX.\" Richard Parsons, the company's chairman and chief executive, said the changes would be phased in over the next few weeks.\n\nParsons said in a statement that the new name \"better reflects the portfolio of our valuable businesses and ends any confusion between our corporate name and the America Online brand name for our investors, partners and the public.\"\n\nThe company declined to make Parsons available to comment.\n\nThe merger, which was announced in the opening days of January 2000, was billed as a way to revolutionize the media business by bringing together the giants of \"old\" and \"new\" media. The deal was worth more than $160 billion at the time, making it the largest in U.S. history.\n\nThe pioneering Internet company America Online was seen as a catalyst to transform the various media properties of Time Warner, including HBO, Time magazine and the nation's No. 2 cable company, Time Warner Cable.\n\nNow, AOL is the company's biggest embarrassment. AOL is still profitable, on track to make $1 billion this year, but it's facing a host of problems, including a regulatory inquiry into its accounting and an eroding subscriber base as users drop AOL for faster connections to the Internet.\n\nWith hopes for a media revolution now a distant memory, the company will continue to focus on simplifying its tangled corporate structure, cleaning up its balance sheet and selling off businesses not central to its core media operations.\n\nThis week the company announced its latest asset sale, a deal to sell its two winter sports teams in Atlanta, the NBA's Hawks and the NHL's Thrashers, to a Boston businessman for $250 million. AOL has also sold off a DVD manufacturing facility and its half-interest in the Comedy Central cable channel.\n\nThe change will also be reflected on the newest addition to the Manhattan skyline, a gleaming 80-story structure in Manhattan's Columbus Circle that the company plans to use as its headquarters beginning next spring. It's currently known as the AOL Time Warner Center.\n\nIn a memo to employees, Parsons said the company was delivering on its goals of debt reduction and turning around AOL. \"We've also devoted a good deal of attention to revitalizing company morale,\" he wrote.\n\nAOL Time Warner first indicated that it was considering a name change last month, when AOL chief Jonathan Miller personally appealed to Parsons that AOL be dropped from the corporate title so people wouldn't confuse the overall company with the online division.\n\nTime Warner veterans from the company have long pressed for such a change, but Miller said he made the push on his own. Miller was not a loyalist in either side of the AOL-Time Warner feud, having come in as AOL's fix-it man from the former USA Interactive.\n\nInvestors and analysts responded well to the name change. The company's stock has been rising since last month, when word first came out that the change was being considered. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the shares rose 14 cents to close at $16.45.\n\n\"AOL is a very unattractive tail on a beautiful dog,\" said Larry Haverty, a media analyst at State Street Research in Boston. \"It's the best possible thing for a shareholder — admit your mistake and move on.\"\n\nAOL Time Warner has said it is not contemplating a sale or spin-off of the AOL division, focusing instead on trying to fix the problems there.\n\nIn his memo, Parsons called AOL \"an important part of our company, and we expect it to continue to make major contributions to our success in the future.\"\n\nMerrill Lynch analyst Jessica Reif Cohen said the company was right to hold on to AOL, which was just recently showing signs of life, including better advertising trends. \"They've gone through the brunt of the pain, and it makes no sense to spin it off now,\" she said.\n\nAOL Time Warner isn't the only company going through an identity crisis. Vivendi Universal is also considering a name change after the French company, which started out as a water utilities conglomerate, completes a deal to merge its Universal entertainment assets with General Electric Co.'s NBC. Vivendi took on the Universal name after it bought the properties from Seagram Co., the Canadian beverage maker.\n\nThe company once known as WorldCom Inc. announced in April that it would change its name to MCI, the name of its long-distance carrier, as it moved to distance itself from a major accounting scandal, and cigarette maker Philip Morris Cos. Inc. changed its name to Altria Group Inc."
