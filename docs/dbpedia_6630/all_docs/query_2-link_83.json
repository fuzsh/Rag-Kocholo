        "text": "Under a new organizational plan, AOL Time Warner is dividing up its businesses to be run in two separate units, each headed by a highly regarded media veteran from the Time Warner side of the company.\n\nThis newly created Media & Communications Group will be headed by the publishing industry veteran Don Logan. The division will include America Online, Time magazine, Time Warner Cable and AOL Time Warner Book Group.\n\nThe Entertainment & Networks Group, the other new division, will be headed by Jeff Bewkes, the mastermind behind HBO's phenomenal success. He will run HBO, New Line Cinema, Turner Networks, The WB network, Warner Bros. music studio and Warner Music.\n\n- - -\n\nGateway losses: Gateway posted a wider-than-expected quarterly loss as sales tumbled.\n\nGateway (GTW) lost $58.5 million, or 19 cents per share, for the three months ending June 30, compared with a loss of $20.7 million, or 6 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.\n\nThe company posted revenues of $1 billion for the quarter, down from more than $1.5 billion in the year-ago period, in part because the company exited all international markets. But company officials were cheered by a slight rise in quarter-to-quarter sales, the first since 1997.\n\n- - -\n\nEricsson perks up: Ericsson (ERICY) posted a better-than-expected earnings report for the first half of 2002 but shocked markets by announcing a severely discounted share price for its $3.20 billion rights issue.\n\nThe company set the subscription price for its rights offering at 40 cents per share.\n\nAP and Reuters contributed to this report.\n\nThe ACLU Fights for Your Constitutional Right to Make Deepfakes\n\nStates across the US are seeking to criminalize certain uses of AI-generated content. Civil rights groups are pushing back, arguing that some of these new laws conflict with the First Amendment.\n\nHow IT Departments Scrambled to Address the CrowdStrike Chaos\n\nSystem administrators and their teams sprang into action last Friday and worked tirelessly to get their companies back online amid one of the worst digital blackouts ever.\n\nWe Asked AI to Take Us On a Tour of Our Cities. It Was Chaos\n\nWe had a specialty chatbot to curate perfect days out in London and New York for under $100 each. We're still recovering from our journeys.\n\nBitcoin Bros Go Wild for Donald Trump\n\nAt Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Trump is finally telling crypto enthusiasts what they want to hear.\n\nYou Won’t Believe What Car Headlights Have in Store\n\nNew technology and a drive toward electrified powertrains have converged to create a flashy new car-lighting landscape. What comes next could be an international light language.\n\nGoogle DeepMind’s Game-Playing AI Tackles a Chatbot Blind Spot\n\nGoogle’s new advance combines a large language model with a self-learning AI. The technique could address some shortcomings with AI—although there’s a catch.\n\nOpen Source AI Has Founders—and the FTC—Buzzing\n\nDC went to YC to talk OS.\n\nMeta's New Llama 3.1 AI Model Is Free, Powerful, and Risky\n\nThe newest version of Llama will make AI more accessible and customizable, but it will also stir up debate over the dangers of releasing AI without guardrails."
