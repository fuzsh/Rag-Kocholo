        "meta_description": "Time Warner began life as a pioneering publishing company 85 years ago. It has stumbled in recent years but is reshaping strategy to stay on top in a rapidly changing media environment. At Time Warner Inc., the future of media is constantly being re-invented. The megalith owns a dazzling array of the world’s bestknown brands. These deliver information and entertainment across virtually every media platform. Perhaps more than any other media enterprise, Time Warner has during its 85-year history succeeded in reading accurately ever-changing user trends for diverse content. Its media products occupy every segment: online (AOL), films (Warner Brothers, New Line Cinema), television (CNN, HBO, TBS, TNT, Cartoon Network and the WB Network), magazines (Time, Fortune, People and Sports Illustrated) and broadband (Time Warner Cable). This is a seriously large, diverse and integrated firm. One out of every two American adults reads a Time, Inc. group magazine every month. People is read by more than 40 million adults. Sports Illustrated’s annual swimsuit edition is the most profitable magazine-branded franchise in the world. The company’s websites attract more than 20 million unique visitors each month. In 2007, the firm launched Time Inc. Studios, a dedicated in-house digital studio that helps deliver the company’s titles on video. Novel ideas, purposeful intent, flexible strategy and decisive action. All these have enabled Time Warner to duck and weave through tough times. The firm has adapted deftly to a rapidly transforming media-consuming global market. Its strategy is clearheaded. Figure out the content consumers want. Deliver it across various media platforms. Acquire non-print outlets to expand into new media. The endresult – an integrated media enterprise with a complementary bouquet of publications, books, television, films, cable and websites. The seminal idea that sutures this strategy: creating specialized content and leveraging it at a low incremental cost across different media. America’s first weekly newsmagazine hit the stands on March 3, 1923. Time was founded by Briton Hadden and Henry Luce. The inaugural issue, with its signature red border, carried Joseph G. Cannon, the retired speaker of the United States House of Representatives, on its cover. The magazine gave America what it had never had before – an alternative to newspapers. From the start, Time was a credible platform for unbiased political and social commentary. It introduced a new language of journalism – fresh, readable, objective. Newspapers in the 1920s used a pretentious journalistic idiom that was often elitist. Time’s prose was readerfriendly. When Hadden passed away in 1929, Luce became the face of Time, continuing to build on much of what he and his friend from Yale (Hadden and Luce had worked together on the Yale Daily News) had envisaged for the magazine. Luce is arguably the greatest journalistic innovator of the last hundred years. He foresaw the future and pioneered the launch of specialized magazines decades before their relevance became evident. Luce launched Fortune in 1930, Life in 1936 and Sports Illustrated in 1954. He anticipated the needs of specific segments of readers and created publications to meet those needs. VOICE OF AMERICA In the years after World War II, as the world struggled with the turmoil and tragedy unleashed on it, Luce’s magazines became the eyes and voice of America. Time in particular was increasingly influential, moulding opinion among politicians and the wider public. Luce stated: “If anyone hasn’t brains enough to know by now that I am a Presbyterian, a Republican and a capitalist, he should. I am biased in favor of God, the Republican Party, and free enterprise. Hadden and I invented Time. Therefore we have a right to say what it would be. We’re not fooling anybody. Our readers know where we stand.” The growing number of readers of Time, Inc.’s stable of magazines were at the cutting-edge of a media revolution in the 1950s. Television was still new. Radio had limitations. Newspapers were stale. Amidst all this, Luce’s magazines heralded the future of the printed word. Time, Life and Fortune defined post-World War II America: progressive, inquisitive, socially mobile, financially driven. Luce’s magazines both mirrored and moulded American society. They laid the foundation for modern U.S. media. Luce retired in 1964 but Time, Inc. continued to evolve. Luce’s 41 years at the helm had given the firm the uncanny ability to identify societal trends and create media products to cater to them. In 1972, the company decided to diversify out of print. It launched Home Box Office (HBO), sensing the impending TV cable revolution. HBO would grow into America’s most successful premium television network. Meanwhile, print was not neglected. Money magazine was launched in 1972 just as Americans began to develop a keen interest in personal finance. People, introduced in 1974, was the first magazine to mine readers’ new taste for celebrity journalism. The late-1970s and early-1980s were a quiescent period for Time, Inc. The print-and-cable giant consolidated its inventory. But top management kept its eyes firmly on the future. Filmed entertainment, music and cable TV news were areas it wanted a major presence in. The modus operandi: grow print organically and expand in other areas with scale-defying M&As. Opportunities for this would soon present themselves. In 1989, Time negotiated to acquire Warner Communications, the parent company of Warner Brothers Pictures and Warner Music Group. The price tag was a steep $14 billion but the deal created Time Warner, Inc. the world’s largest media and entertainment conglomerate. The acquisition of Warner Brothers brought with it an extensive film library, state-of-the-art production studios and a leading record company. Warner’s cable assets, clubbed with Time’s HBO platform, created the second largest cable operation in the U.S. BOX OFFICE APPLAUSE It was the perfect move. Time Warner’s two studios, Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema, were involved in the creation and production of films and television programs. These were distributed across a spectrum of outlets. Revenues rose. Time Warner was now a broadbased media giant with assets across diverse content platforms. Diversification paid off. Many of the firm’s movies were blockbusters. Matrix earned over $450 million worldwide. The Harry Potter multi-film franchise and the adventure trilogy, The Lord of the Rings, won box office applause and critical acclaim. The group’s television business too blossomed. Hit serials like ER, Friends, The Drew Carey Show, Whose Line Is It Anyway? and others drew large audiences. Time Warner’s music group expanded quickly as well. By 1999 it operated in 68 countries and in that year won 20 Grammys. It produced 38 of the world’s best-selling albums in the U.S. and 25 of its albums sold more than a million copies worldwide. Trouble, however, lurked around the corner. Three years earlier, in 1996, Time Warner had undertaken a risky $7.60 billion merger with Ted Turner’s Turner Broadcasting System (TBS), adding $17.5 billion in debt to its balance sheet. Gerald Levin, Time Warner’s CEO at the time, described it as “manifest destiny… production married to distribution will allow a company to create, seamlessly, new products for the digital age.” TBS brought with it the successful cable networks of CNN and TNT as well as production studios, billboards and ownership of the Atlanta Braves baseball team and the Atlanta Hawks basketball team. Time Warner’s portfolio now had a nice mix of mature businesses like publishing and music and high-growth businesses such as cable TV, television syndication and films. In 1999, Time Warner, recorded gross revenues of $27.30 billion. Its products had a leading market share in the majority of segments they competed in. Nothing, it seemed, could go wrong. Everything did. At the turn of the century, a debtburdened Time Warner found itself at the crossroads. Luce’s vision had created an exceptional print media platform. His successors had read societal trends well. They ventured or bought successfully into cable, TV syndication, music and films. Large acquisitions (Warner Bros., Turner Broadcasting Systems) had given the multi-platform firm impetus, scale and global reach. But the internet revolution changed everything. Could Time Warner be caught napping? Was this the first mega-trend that would escape the media giant’s keen eye? MERGER OF EQUALS None of Time Warner’s mergers, acquisitions or divestments shook the media world as much as its “sale” in 2000 to America Online (AOL). Both companies dubbed it “a strategic merger of equals to create the world’s first fully integrated media and communications company for the Internet Century”. The “merger of equals” was structured as a buyout of Time Warner by AOL for $164 billion. AOL shareholders now owned 55 percent of the new company while Time Warner owned just 45 percent. It was a stunning admission by the world’s leading “old media” firm that, in a few short years, everything had indeed changed. The internet, despite the dotcom boom-and-bust of 1999- 2000, was the future of media. However, while AOL had become a big brand it lacked access to the leading source of broadband – the pipes of cable television. It also did not have a solid base for producing original content, the lifeblood of any media. Time Warner, on the other hand, with its content and cable television systems, needed to gatecrash the internet economy to broaden its appeal among print-averse young people brought up in a digital age. The AOL merger seemed the perfect match. Making the announcement, AOL CEO Steve Case declared: “I don’t think it’s too much to say this is a historic moment, a time when we transform the landscape of media and communications.” It wasn’t to work out quite that way. Founded as Quantum Computer Services in 1985 by Case and others and launched in 1989 under the name America Online Inc., AOL went public in 1992. In 1999, it embarked on an acquisition spree, buying Netscape Communications Corporation (for $9.60 billion), MovieFone and the internet music companies Spinner Networks and Nullsoft. By 2000, AOL was the largest Internet Service Provider (ISP) in the world with a market value of $160 billion and revenues of $7.70 billion. It was poised to realize its vision of building “a global medium as central to people’s lives as the telephone or television and even more valuable.” The AOL-Time Warner deal closed on January 11, 2001. The merged firm’s market capitalization rose to an extraordinary $217 billion. Most observers saw the AOL-Time Warner merger as a historical turning point for global media. The internet was poised to become a powerful distribution tool. It would transform the way information and entertainment content was disseminated. It did – but not in the way AOL-Time Warner envisaged. After the merger, the company’s profitability – and stock price – began to fall. The company’s 2001 Annual Report, however, remained upbeat: “In the last decade, information, communications and entertainment were separate businesses, and they could be operated successfully that way. Today, as consumers demand more choice, control and convenience, the lines are beginning to blur – and these trends are ushering in a new era of convergence. AOL-Time Warner can capitalize on the promise of convergence – and deliver on the promise of the merger.” While AOL-Time Warner was the first global integrated media company, a clutch of anti-trust and cultural issues clouded the merger. AOL-Time Warner straddled such a wide array of media assets that competitors like Disney’s ABC network petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), stating that the merger would “have the ability… to foreclose independent and competitive development of interactive television.” Other competitors like Microsoft too objected to the deal, especially citing AOL’s instant messaging service as being predatory and unfair. On the credit side, AOL-Time Warner was now a serious competitor to News Corp, Sony, Viacom-CBS, Vivendi-Universal and Bertelsmann. By 2002-03, responding to its huge losses (the enterprise’s peak market value of $300 billion had slumped to $105 billion), the company took two dramatic steps – it dropped AOL from its name and replaced Steve Case with Richard Parsons as Executive Chairman. Parsons not only saved the merged company from financial peril but also civil war. Time Warner has often been described as a giant dysfunctional family where five huge businesses are run by five powerful executives involved in internal corporate battles. Parsons, an affable Brooklyn-bred lawyer, raised the company from the rubble of the merger and saw off an assault from corporate raider Carl Icahn. THE AOL FALL-OUT Though AOL, now a Time Warner subsidiary, is regarded as something of a lost opportunity, its network of web properties still attracts an average of 113 million unique U.S. visitors every month. Its websites include MapQuest, a provider of online maps and directions, AIM, a messaging service, and TMZ.com, an entertainment news site. In line with America’s changing demographics, it has launched AOL Black Voices and AOL Latino. AOL’s acquisitions include advertising.com, one of the largest advertising networks on the web; ADTECH AG, an international ad-serving company based in Frankfurt; Third Screen Media, a mobile advertising network; and TACODA, a behavioral advertising network. Nearly every one of Time Warner’s five business segments – interactive services, filmed entertainment, TV networks, publishing and cable – enjoys a dominant market share. HBO through its two 24- hour pay television services – HBO and Cinemax – has nearly 40 million subscribers. New Line Cinema has created some of the most successful film franchises in history. Warner Brothers Television produced more than 20 bestselling series for the 2007-08 season. TNT, television’s “destination for drama”, and CNN have outstanding brand equity. Time, Inc. (spun off in 2003 under the name Direct Holdings America Inc.) is the largest magazine publisher in the U.S. Time Warner Cable (together with its subsidiaries) is the second-largest cable operator in America with 14.7 million customer relationships. The future of Time Warner – large, amorphous, seeking new direction – lies in the hands of new CEO Jeffrey Bewkes. The 28-year company veteran has long been viewed as Richard Parsons’ heir apparent. Bewkes’ claim to the top spot was the transformation he engineered of HBO from a movie channel to an original programming powerhouse. It was on his watch that programs such as The Sopranos, Six Feet Under and Sex and the City were launched. Even though Parsons was committed to keeping the company intact, arguing that with a market capitalization of $70 billion the enterprise is more valuable together than in pieces, Bewkes is likely to unwind the media giant. Industry sources speculate that he may spin off the cable television division and sell both troubled AOL and parts of the low-growth Time magazine group. The company would then be a lean media machine with highgrowth and stable TV and film businesses anchored by the Warner studio, Turner cable channels and HBO. This will please beleaguered shareholders. They have seen the company’s stock price trading below where it was at the time of Parsons’ ascension. So is Luce’s original vision in jeopardy? With hindsight, Time Warner made several errors of judgment in the past two decades. It overpaid for Warner Brothers and Turner Broadcasting. That wiped out the company’s profits for years. In 2003, Time Warner took a $99 billion goodwill loss, pouring more red ink on an already stained balance sheet. Its merger with AOL was badly timed and poorly executed. The two firms’ old media-new media cultures never meshed. The rapidly changing external environment at the turn of the century also caught up with the firm. Internet music and video downloads have cut the ground from beneath the feet of the global music and film businesses. CD and DVD sales are in terminal decline. Magazines are meanwhile being deserted by advertisers migrating online. To rescue its red-inked, debtladen balance sheet, the Time Warner Music group has already been sold, the sports teams offloaded, CNNfn shut down and the Time Warner Books division divested. Next on the block: parts of the magazine unit’s near-150 specialist titles and AOL. In Bewkes’ first quarterly financial conference call in February 2008 since taking charge, he officially announced the separation of AOL’s internet business from Time Warner’s content business. Bewkes said: “This should significantly increase AOL’s strategic options.” This could indeed be the first move towards a complete sale of AOL where ad revenue (in the fourth quarter of 2007) grew only 18 percent compared to Google’s growth of 51 percent and the industry average of 25 percent. The “new” Time Warner will probably comprise television and cable (Turner Networks, HBO), film (Warner Bros., New Line Cinema) and some magazine titles (Time, Fortune, People, Sports Illustrated). Henry Luce never intended his publishing firm to be an end-to-end media monolith. As Time Warner unravels, it will come closer to Luce’s innovative vision of producing riveting information and entertainment to satisfy readers and viewers across interests and classes. The innovation embedded in Luce’s early strategies will need to be recaptured as Time Warner rebuilds itself into a nimbler, more adaptable media firm. The ability to create content is its pivotal strength. New technology is an enabler. CEO Bewkes’ job is to marry the two. Time pioneered news journalism in 1923 and sparked a publishing revolution. Time Warner must return to those roots, where innovative ideas create valuable products which fulfill unmet needs. That was Luce’s way – it must now be Bewkes’.",

Everything did.\n\nAt the turn of the century, a debtburdened Time Warner found itself at the crossroads. Luce’s vision had created an exceptional print media platform. His successors had read societal trends well. They ventured or bought successfully into cable, TV syndication, music and films. Large acquisitions (Warner Bros., Turner Broadcasting Systems) had given the multi-platform firm impetus, scale and global reach. But the internet revolution changed everything. Could Time Warner be caught napping? Was this the first mega-trend that would escape the media giant’s keen eye?\n\nMERGER OF EQUALS\n\nNone of Time Warner’s mergers, acquisitions or divestments shook the media world as much as its “sale” in 2000 to America Online (AOL). Both companies dubbed it “a strategic merger of equals to create the world’s first fully integrated media and communications company for the Internet Century”.\n\nThe “merger of equals” was structured as a buyout of Time Warner by AOL for $164 billion. AOL shareholders now owned 55 percent of the new company while Time Warner owned just 45 percent. It was a stunning admission by the world’s leading “old media” firm that, in a few short years, everything had indeed changed. The internet, despite the dotcom boom-and-bust of 1999- 2000, was the future of media. However, while AOL had become a big brand it lacked access to the leading source of broadband – the pipes of cable television. It also did not have a solid base for producing original content, the lifeblood of any media. Time Warner, on the other hand, with its content and cable television systems, needed to gatecrash the internet economy to broaden its appeal among print-averse young people brought up in a digital age. The AOL merger seemed the perfect match. Making the announcement, AOL CEO Steve Case declared: “I don’t think it’s too much to say this is a historic moment, a time when we transform the landscape of media and communications.”\n\nIt wasn’t to work out quite that way. Founded as Quantum Computer Services in 1985 by Case and others and launched in 1989 under the name America Online Inc., AOL went public in 1992. In 1999, it embarked on an acquisition spree, buying Netscape Communications Corporation (for $9.60 billion), MovieFone and the internet music companies Spinner Networks and Nullsoft. By 2000, AOL was the largest Internet Service Provider (ISP) in the world with a market value of $160 billion and revenues of $7.70 billion. It was poised to realize its vision of building “a global medium as central to people’s lives as the telephone or television and even more valuable.” The AOL-Time Warner deal closed on January 11, 2001. The merged firm’s market capitalization rose to an extraordinary $217 billion. Most observers saw the AOL-Time Warner merger as a historical turning point for global media. The internet was poised to become a powerful distribution tool. It would transform the way information and entertainment content was disseminated. It did – but not in the way AOL-Time Warner envisaged. After the merger, the company’s profitability – and stock price – began to fall. The company’s 2001 Annual Report, however, remained upbeat: “In the last decade, information, communications and entertainment were separate businesses, and they could be operated successfully that way. Today, as consumers demand more choice, control and convenience, the lines are beginning to blur – and these trends are ushering in a new era of convergence. AOL-Time Warner can capitalize on the promise of convergence – and deliver on the promise of the merger.”\n\nWhile AOL-Time Warner was the first global integrated media company, a clutch of anti-trust and cultural issues clouded the merger. AOL-Time Warner straddled such a wide array of media assets that competitors like Disney’s ABC network petitioned the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), stating that the merger would “have the ability… to foreclose independent and competitive development of interactive television.” Other competitors like Microsoft too objected to the deal, especially citing AOL’s instant messaging service as being predatory and unfair. On the credit side, AOL-Time Warner was now a serious competitor to News Corp, Sony, Viacom-CBS, Vivendi-Universal and Bertelsmann. By 2002-03, responding to its huge losses (the enterprise’s peak market value of $300 billion had slumped to $105 billion), the company took two dramatic steps – it dropped AOL from its name and replaced Steve Case with Richard Parsons as Executive Chairman. Parsons not only saved the merged company from financial peril but also civil war. Time Warner has often been described as a giant dysfunctional family where five huge businesses are run by five powerful executives involved in internal corporate battles. Parsons, an affable Brooklyn-bred lawyer, raised the company from the rubble of the merger and saw off an assault from corporate raider Carl Icahn.\n\nTHE AOL FALL-OUT\n\nThough AOL, now a Time Warner subsidiary, is regarded as something of a lost opportunity, its network of web properties still attracts an average of 113 million unique U.S. visitors every month. Its websites include MapQuest, a provider of online maps and directions, AIM, a messaging service, and TMZ.com, an entertainment news site. In line with America’s changing demographics, it has launched AOL Black Voices and AOL Latino. AOL’s acquisitions include advertising.com, one of the largest advertising networks on the web; ADTECH AG, an international ad-serving company based in Frankfurt; Third Screen Media, a mobile advertising network; and TACODA, a behavioral advertising network. Nearly every one of Time Warner’s five business segments – interactive services, filmed entertainment, TV networks, publishing and cable – enjoys a dominant market share. HBO through its two 24- hour pay television services – HBO and Cinemax – has nearly 40 million subscribers. New Line Cinema has created some of the most successful film franchises in history. Warner Brothers Television produced more than 20 bestselling series for the 2007-08 season. TNT, television’s “destination for drama”, and CNN have outstanding brand equity. Time, Inc. (spun off in 2003 under the name Direct Holdings America Inc.) is the largest magazine publisher in the U.S. Time Warner Cable (together with its subsidiaries) is the second-largest cable operator in America with 14.7 million customer relationships.\n\nThe future of Time Warner – large, amorphous, seeking new direction – lies in the hands of new CEO Jeffrey Bewkes. The 28-year company veteran has long been viewed as Richard Parsons’ heir apparent. Bewkes’ claim to the top spot was the transformation he engineered of HBO from a movie channel to an original programming powerhouse. It was on his watch that programs such as The Sopranos, Six Feet Under and Sex and the City were launched. Even though Parsons was committed to keeping the company intact, arguing that with a market capitalization of $70 billion the enterprise is more valuable together than in pieces, Bewkes is likely to unwind the media giant. Industry sources speculate that he may spin off the cable television division and sell both troubled AOL and parts of the low-growth Time magazine group. The company would then be a lean media machine with highgrowth and stable TV and film businesses anchored by the Warner studio, Turner cable channels and HBO. This will please beleaguered shareholders. They have seen the company’s stock price trading below where it was at the time of Parsons’ ascension.\n\nSo is Luce’s original vision in jeopardy? With hindsight, Time Warner made several errors of judgment in the past two decades. It overpaid for Warner Brothers and Turner Broadcasting. That wiped out the company’s profits for years. In 2003, Time Warner took a $99 billion goodwill loss, pouring more red ink on an already stained balance sheet. Its merger with AOL was badly timed and poorly executed. The two firms’ old media-new media cultures never meshed. The rapidly changing external environment at the turn of the century also caught up with the firm. Internet music and video downloads have cut the ground from beneath the feet of the global music and film businesses. CD and DVD sales are in terminal decline. Magazines are meanwhile being deserted by advertisers migrating online. To rescue its red-inked, debtladen balance sheet, the Time Warner Music group has already been sold, the sports teams offloaded, CNNfn shut down and the Time Warner Books division divested. Next on the block: parts of the magazine unit’s near-150 specialist titles and AOL.\n\nIn Bewkes’ first quarterly financial conference call in February 2008 since taking charge, he officially announced the separation of AOL’s internet business from Time Warner’s content business. Bewkes said: “This should significantly increase AOL’s strategic options.” This could indeed be the first move towards a complete sale of AOL where ad revenue (in the fourth quarter of 2007) grew only 18 percent compared to Google’s growth of 51 percent and the industry average of 25 percent.\n\nThe “new” Time Warner will probably comprise television and cable (Turner Networks, HBO), film (Warner Bros., New Line Cinema) and some magazine titles (Time, Fortune, People, Sports Illustrated). Henry Luce never intended his publishing firm to be an end-to-end media monolith. As Time Warner unravels, it will come closer to Luce’s innovative vision of producing riveting information and entertainment to satisfy readers and viewers across interests and classes.\n\nThe innovation embedded in Luce’s early strategies will need to be recaptured as Time Warner rebuilds itself into a nimbler, more adaptable media firm. The ability to create content is its pivotal strength. New technology is an enabler. CEO Bewkes’ job is to marry the two. Time pioneered news journalism in 1923 and sparked a publishing revolution. Time Warner must return to those roots, where innovative ideas create valuable products which fulfill unmet needs. That was Luce’s way – it must now be Bewkes’."
