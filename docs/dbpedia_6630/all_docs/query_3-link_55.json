        "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. shares tumbled to their lowest level ever after the entertainment giant took a $9.1 billion charge for writing down the value of its traditional TV networks.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden Invests $100 Million to Fuel Housing Construction\n\nManchester Is Giving London a Run for Its Money\n\nIn DNC, Chicago’s Embattled Transit System Faces a High-Profile Test\n\nJohannesburg Mayor Quits Amid Infighting, Financial Woes\n\nHow Chicago’s Gigantic Merchandise Mart Is Still Thriving as Office Space\n\nThe company, created in 2022 when Discovery Inc. acquired WarnerMedia, concluded that cable channels like CNN and TNT are no longer worth what they were when the $42 billion merger was completed.\n\n“Two years ago market valuations and prevailing conditions for legacy media companies were quite different than they are today,” Chief Executive Officer David Zaslav said on a call with investors on Wednesday. “This impairment acknowledges this and better aligns our carrying values with our future outlook.”\n\nShares of Warner Bros. fell as much as 13% to $6.73 on Thursday morning in New York. That’s the lowest price since the stock of the merged company began trading in April 2022.\n\nWarner Bros. also suffered from last month’s decision by the National Basketball Association to drop it as a broadcast partner and award a $76 billion, 11-year media rights deal to Walt Disney Co., Comcast Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. Warner Bros. filed a lawsuit against the NBA last month alleging a breach of contract.\n\n“At this point, we’ve handed it off to our lawyers,” Zaslav said on the call. “We have confidence in our position.”\n\nThe writedown reflects the continued exodus of viewers from cable networks like CNN to streaming, taking with them the advertising sales and subscriber fees that supply most of the revenue for conventional TV.\n\nThe changes have rippled across media. Disney, which announced third-quarter results earlier Wednesday, reported declines in linear television advertising sales and subscribers.\n\nIn streaming, Warner Bros. added 3.6 million new subscribers, according to a statement, exceeding Wall Street’s expectations of 1.89 million. That brought the total to 103.3 million, also topping estimates. Ad revenue from streaming doubled to $240 million, beating analysts’ estimates of $191.4 million.\n\nWarner Bros. has eliminated more than 2,000 positions over the past year and slashed 100 jobs at CNN last month. The company raised subscription prices for its Max streaming service in June.\n\nFor the quarter, Warner Bros. reported a net loss of $10 billion, which included additional charges of $2.1 billion related to its merger. Revenue for the quarter fell 6.2% to $9.71 billion.\n\nUnder different management teams over the past 20 years, Warner Bros. has been involved in some of the most controversial and criticized merger deals. They include the $124 billion merger of Time Warner with America Online in 2001 and the later purchase of Time Warner by AT&T Inc. for $87 billion in 2018.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside Worldcoin’s Orb Factory, Audacious and Absurd Defender of Humanity\n\nNew Breed of EV Promises 700 Miles per Charge (Just Add Gas)\n\nKamala Harris 4.0: Liberal, Moderate or Something Else?\n\nThere’s a Gender Split in How US College Grads Are Tackling a More Difficult Job Market\n\nHow Online Influencers Got Addicted to Swedish Candy\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P."
