        "text": "Yes, it is. Bright House has been rebranded as Charter Spectrum. Charter Communications introduced the Spectrum brand in 2014, two years before Charter acquired Bright House Networks and Time Warner Cable and their combined 25 million customers in 41 states. The deal was for $67.1 billion and made Charter Communications the second largest cable and internet company in the U.S. Charter folded the Bright House and Time Warner names under the Spectrum brand.\n\nBright House customers now belong to Spectrum for cable TV, phone, and internet service. Customers will see the Spectrum name on the former Bright House and Time Warner trucks.\n\nIf you are now a Spectrum customer and want to pay your bill online through your bank’s website or mobile app, you may not yet see “Spectrum” listed under the Utilities category even in 2023. When you type “Spectrum” into the search for company names, you may see Bright House and Time Warner Cable pop up as options. Select the legacy name one that applies. It’s not uncommon for such a rebranding to take time. Mergers and acquisitions generally are announced as the deal is agreed upon but it can take years for related institutions to update to a new name change. What’s important is that you can still pay your bill online even under the old name."
