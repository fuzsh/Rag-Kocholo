The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:35 a.m. in room SR-253, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Conrad Burns presiding. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CONRAD BURNS, U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA Senator Burns. The Committee will come to order. I would like to welcome everyone here today to this hearing, which concerns an issue of critical importance to the future development of the Internet, the proposed merger of two massive players in the Internet access and media content fields, and that has to do with America Online and Time Warner. The purpose of the America Online-Time Warner merger would be, or the proposed merger, I should say, would be the largest merger in history. The amount of money involved is staggering. The initial price on the January 10 announcement was over $156 billion. This Committee takes its oversight role very seriously, particularly when scrutinizing a combination of such unprecedented scope. Of particular importance in fulfilling the Committee's due diligence duty is a close examination of the potential effects on consumers of such an immense company. AOL has about 21 million subscribers today, which is about six times larger than the nearest competitor for Internet service, and that is MindSpring. Time Warner is the Nation's second largest cable provider, with a vast array of video, music, and print content that pervades America's every-day life. From the checkout stands in the afternoon to the couch at home in the evening, clearly the proposed combined company has the potential to use the vast power for the good of America. However, while the proposed merger before this Committee has the potential to provide consumer benefits, we also know the difference between potential and reality. While the combination of Time Warner's enormous treasure trove of content and America Online's 21 million subscribers could provide exciting new services, several serious public policy issues are raised by the creation of such a potentially dominant entity. In assessing the potential future effects of the proposed merger, it is usually most helpful to look at the current market behavior of the players involved. With this in mind, I am particularly troubled by the recent developments in the instant messaging area. Instant messaging is a real time chat format which allows users to communicate quickly and cheaply with each other. America Online alone has over 45 million registered subscribers, and after its 1998 purchase of ICQ, the major alternative instant messaging system, currently commands over 80 million messaging users overall. These users generate nearly a billion messages a day, far more than the entire mail volume of the United States Postal Service. The mode of communications is especially popular with young people, who favor it over traditional telephone conversation in many cases. As we all know, what has made the U.S. telephone network the envy of the world, and a tremendous positive economic force, it is the fact that it is available everywhere to all users. The fact that anyone can access the network makes it vastly more valuable to everyone. The spectacular growth of the Internet itself was made possible by the development of open networks, not closed systems. Unfortunately, in the instant messaging area, I fear we are headed in the other direction. Just yesterday my colleague, Senator Hollings and I were presented with a letter from all of the major competitors that offer instant messaging services stating that their products are being purposely blocked by the dominant provider of such services, America Online. This letter was signed by many companies, including AT&T, AltaVista, Prodigy, and others too numerous to mention here. This very Committee heard just last summer that serious efforts were being undertaken by America Online to deal in good faith with these interoperability problems so that all consumers could benefit. In a July statement issued by the chairman of the working group designed to solve these problems, AOL stated that it, quote, believes that users should be able to exchange messages regardless of which product they use. AOL also said it was, I quote, fast-tracking these efforts. Well, it is 7 months later, and these blocking problems are more evident than ever, and I look forward to the testimony of the witnesses to clarify these recent events. Another issue that many Members of this Committee will be interested in, I assume, would be the so-called open access. I followed with great interest the announcement on Tuesday of this week that AOL and Time Warner committed to give their broadband cable customers direct access to Internet service providers on a nondiscriminatory basis. While I was never in favor of Government intrusion and regulation of the cable networks, I applaud the efforts to reach privately negotiated settlements. I should add that while the memorandum appears to be a positive first step, on closer inspection several questions are raised about how binding such agreement will be, and I look forward to a more detailed description of how this understanding would translate into the marketplace with our witnesses, and I look forward to your testimony today. I would also like to invite Mr. Case and Mr. Levin if they would--March 21, we kick off this year's activities in the Internet Caucus, and we will invite both of you to be a part of that, coming up on March 21. You might have your people put that on your calendar, and I thank you for coming today. Now I turn to my good friend, Senator Hollings. STATEMENT OF HON. ERNEST F. HOLLINGS, U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLINA Senator Hollings. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think I can save us time by including my statement in the record here at this point. Let me thank the staff for preparing this statement, because I am not intelligent enough to prepare one on this subject. Things are breaking so fast, and we come from a policy of open access, and not having control of both content and message. That has been constant throughout our history with TV. Both of you folks at the table are way smarter than we are, but you understand that in the television industry we would not even let the networks produce their own programs. That was to try, under the First Amendment, freedom of speech, more flexible programs than otherwise, and even in the 1996 Telecommunications Act, I remember we put in there for the Bell Companies if they got into video programming that they have open access, nondiscriminatory conduct and everything else. Now, what I am trying to see is, we have seen the tremendous merging of content and delivery, and anybody that studied John D. Rockefeller--who did not make his money on oil, he made his money on the distribution and delivery of that oil, and I see that you smart folks are really producing--and I will wait my turn for the questions, but it looks to me you all are running down--you all have got the Microsoft book, going right, straight down the Microsoft route that has got them in court right now, but I do thank you, and I would yield to my colleagues. [The prepared statement of Senator Hollings follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Ernest F. Hollings, U.S. Senator from South Carolina The merger of AOL and Time Warner represents the synthesis of old and new media, narrowband and broadband, and content and delivery systems. It also represents the union of the world's largest Internet service provider and the world's biggest entertainment and media company. As such, it raises several public policy concerns that require significant examination. AOL has 23 million subscribers, six times larger then its biggest Internet competitor. According to the International Data Corp (IDC), a Massachusetts research and financial data firm, AOL controls more than 40 percent of the Internet services market. Time Warner controls the second largest cable system in the country, owns 20 percent of the cable lines and serves 12.6 million cable customers. Time Warner produces its own content and owns CNN Network News, Cinemax, HBO and TNT, as well as Warner Brothers' movies. On the print side, the company publishes numerous popular magazines such as Time, People, Sports Illustrated, Southern Living, Fortune and Money, which are read by 120 million people. There is tremendous potential for the exercise of undue market power and the discriminatory treatment of its competitors by this merged company. AOL already has used its market clout to forge agreements with top computer manufacturers to have its Internet access service bundled on new computers. This of course was the basis for the Microsoft anti-trust suit by Justice. In fact, that suit was directly tied to Netscape which is now owned by AOL. Now under this new agreement, new computers purchased from Dell, Compaq, and Gateway will have AOL's software. It also is my understanding that AOL has developed a new 5.0 software that reportedly disables its competitors when installed on a user's computer, and is the subject of class action litigation in Arizona, Washington and Oregon. In order to rectify the problem consumers must call the AOL help line and reprogram their computer. While AOL is espousing nondiscriminatory treatment and choice, it is using software that makes it difficult to use multiple service providers. Will there be other changes in the Internet's architecture or AOL's software that will make it difficult for others to compete on a level playing field against AOL. Finally, this transaction raises the potential for discriminatory practices with respect to content delivered over the Internet/cable platform that will be deployed by AOL-Time Warner. When we passed the cable act in 1992, we were acutely aware of the dangers posed by the vertical combination of both content and distribution systems, and the inevitable temptation of the owner of both the content and distribution system to discriminate against their competitors. Then, in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, we included a provision to ensure that if the telephone companies provided video programming, they could not ``unreasonably discriminate . . . with regard to material or information (including advertising) provided by the operator to subscribers . . . or in the way . . . material or information is presented to subscribers.'' Now we have a cable-Internet merger in which economic incentives will exist to favor their content, news, material, and information, over that of competing content and news information providers. The FTC and Congress should seriously consider whether this combination should be subject to similar principles of non-discrimination. I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses today on these important issues. Senator Burns. Thank you very much. Senator Gorton. STATEMENT OF HON. SLADE GORTON, U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON Senator Gorton. Mr. Chairman, in listening to both you and Senator Hollings I share many of your apprehensions. This is a huge merger. It looks as though it could easily lead us to a point where we have only a handful of major providers in the most dynamic part of our economy, and I share many of the reservations, though not necessarily all of the conclusions of the three members of the second panel that is going to appear before us here today. And I think it is right and proper on your part that we should take a very careful view of this merger, and should review it with at least a sufficient degree of apprehension that we require a heavy burden of proof on the two merging partners, and that they are not going to lessen competition and openness in the field together, and they play such a dominant role in. Senator Burns. Thank you very much. Senator Wyden. STATEMENT OF HON. RON WYDEN, U.S. SENATOR FROM OREGON Senator Wyden. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be very brief, and I want to pick up on what Senator Hollings said. It seems to me that in the 21st Century the money is to be made in interactivity, and I think when you look at the vision that the two of you have discussed with this merger. I think your vision is what we will need to examine. There are two areas in particular that I would look at with you. First, because of the size of this merger and the number of people involved, to a great extent what the two of you are doing is going to have enormous ramifications for privacy policy in this country. Senator Hollings has a lot of good thoughts on this. Senator Burns and I have a bipartisan bill with respect to this issue. Senator Kohl has signed on to it. Mr. Case, I heard you say a couple of days ago that you were essentially ready to back privacy legislation and, given the fact that this is perhaps number 2 now in the polls with respect to the American people, I would like to see you outline your views on privacy this morning. You will be asked about what you think the elements of a good privacy statute ought to be. That is number 1. The second area, so that you two will be aware of what I am going to ask, is this question about how to make sure that there is no discrimination against unaffiliated content providers. As you know, there is great concern in this country with respect to all of the other content providers who are not affiliated with your system about how they are going to get a fair shake, and I would like to have you all outline how it is that those folks are going to be treated fairly, so we do not end up in a country where, to get some of those content providers, people have got to scroll along for eons in order to get access to those materials. That is what I will be asking. Mr. Chairman, I look forward to working with you and Senator Hollings in a bipartisan way. Senator Burns. Thank you very much. Senator Dorgan. STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON L. DORGAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA Senator Dorgan. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. Let me thank Mr. Case and Mr. Levin for coming today. I have spoken at some length about my concern about concentration. That is not a secret. My concern about concentration deals especially with the question of how does concentration affect competition? When we rewrote the Telecommunications Act our interest was in fostering aggressive, robust competition, and that is what I am going to be interested in today. How does this merger affect competition? And let me also say that I think privacy matters a great deal. As Senator Wyden indicated, privacy is one of the policy areas that we are very interested in. And I would also say that I was surprised and also found appealing the announcement earlier this week about open access. I think that is certainly a step in the right direction, but we must be concerned, as all of us proceed, about the competitive forces that can exist in the marketplace in telecommunications and entertainment. What are the competitive forces that will allow the consumer, the best possible product at the best possible price? I am interested in hearing all of the witnesses discuss today the effect of this proposed merger on those issues. Again, both of you are very successful businessmen who have built interesting and wonderful companies. Let me just say that with respect to the $1 billion instant messages, my children contribute a lot to that $1 billion a day, regrettably. We are working on paring that down just a bit. But this is a fascinating time and a fascinating industry. I am very interested in your presentations, and the presentation of the panel following you. Senator Burns. Thank you very much. Senator Bryan. STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD H. BRYAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA Senator Bryan. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for convening this important hearing, and thanks to our distinguished witnesses for appearing here today. I think this merger raises some potentially troubling implications in terms of public policy, and at least two areas that are of concern to me have been mentioned by my colleagues. These areas include the impact this merger has on competition, and whether there will be open access. Mr. Case, you appeared before this Committee last year, prior to the merger. At that time you made, I thought, a very compelling argument. You urged us to consider having the FCC open a rule. I want to explore whether or not, after the announcement, you think we need to followup on that with some additional action, either at the regulatory level or at the legislative level and, as two of my colleagues have mentioned previously, the issue of privacy is not just a phantom issue. It is not ephemeral. It is an issue that I hear from my colleagues and from my constituents virtually every day. The Wall Street Journal did an opinion poll sampling last year with a focus on the millennium. What are the concerns that most Americans have in the next century? It was an open-ended poll. The single largest responding category at 29 percent expressed a concern about loss of privacy. I want to explore those issues with you, as I know a number of my colleagues may. Again, I look forward to the opportunity to ask some questions, and thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Burns. Thank you, Senator. Senator Rockefeller, I wonder if you might autograph one of those books that Senator Hollings was referring to. [Laughter.] STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA Senator Rockefeller. That is on distribution and not on collection. [Laughter.] I would say to our two witnesses that I do not necessarily start out skeptically on this merger. There are a number of questions that I need to have answered, and time will help us do that as well as this hearing. This whole phenomenon of the new economy is moving forward, and I am not inclined to try to stop it unless it is unwilling to address certain areas I think that you will be, and I have some questions for you about this, but you know, the privacy question is huge. Senator Hollings has asked me to do some work on that, and I am going to because he has asked me to and also because I think it is a huge issue. Another important issue is the whole question of not undermining consumer choice when it comes to broadband. But I do not start out skeptically. I start out with an open mind, and a willingness to hear how you respond to what people have to say because that is what hearings are for, and you have both the FTC and the FCC to go through. The FCC doesn't ordinarily turn down mergers of this sort. The FTC may very well approve it, I do not know, but your presence here is important, and how you answer questions will be extremely important. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Burns. Thank you, Senator. Senator Stevens. Senator Stevens. I applaud the merger. I am happy to be here and hear your statements. I hope my colleagues will let us get to that. Senator Burns. Thank you, Senator Stevens. Senator Breaux. STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN B. BREAUX, U.S. SENATOR FROM LOUISIANA Senator Breaux. Now, should I say anything? [Laughter.] Well, I thank the chairman, and I think you can tell the scope of this hearing is very important because you have heard from every Member of the Committee, and that is what happens when the subject matter is as important as this. You know, it seems like now more and more we have less and less. I mean, it seems like every day we have fewer oil and gas companies, fewer airlines, fewer railroads, and fewer telecommunications companies in this country, and big is not necessarily bad, but this is a country, as all of you know who are very competitive in your fields, that has been built on competition. The question I think we legitimately need to look at is how, when you have less and less, do you have more competition? It is a legitimate question. I know you are prepared to respond to it, and I look forward to your response. Thanks. Senator Burns. Senator Cleland. STATEMENT OF HON. MAX CLELAND, U.S. SENATOR FROM GEORGIA Senator Cleland. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am intrigued at this possibility this morning of our hearing. As a Democrat, I do not get a chance to encounter billionaires very often, so I just came to sit and stare. [Laughter.] Additionally, coming from Georgia---- Senator Breaux. You look at Rockefeller every day. We've got one. Senator Cleland. But he's ours. [Laughter.] Knowing the history of TBS in Atlanta, and how it became Time Warner, and knowing Ted Turner as I do, I am also fascinated to see the guy who attempts to be Ted Turner's boss. [Laughter.] So we welcome you both today. Let me just say, in 1966 Time Warner did purchase TBS in Atlanta. A few months after that merger the TBS subsidiaries of Time Warner employed almost 8,000 employees worldwide, and almost 5,000 in Georgia, and today those numbers have risen to over 9,000 employees worldwide and over 5,500 located in Georgia, so I think that was a good purchase and a good deal. As the TBS continues to launch new products, these numbers will continue to grow, I am sure, and create growth in other segments of our economy in Georgia and in the country. Now the merger we are discussing today has the potential, I think, to imitate many of these same positive results. It involves two dynamic leaders and two powerful industries, and it is no coincidence that it was announced just hours into what Mr. Levin has coined the Internet Century. I am very interested in learning how the merging of TV, movies, print media, with the Internet can really help average Americans, can help the consumer. The proposed merger between AOL and Time Warner, the largest in U.S. history, offers a tremendous opportunity to help shape the future of the Internet. This understandably creates a great deal of interest, speculation, and some anxiety. There is really no precedent for the merger of a media provider and an Internet provider. It leaves the merger open to interpretation of what is likely to happen. I personally am looking at this with great optimism and hope and faith, and belief in AOL and Time Warner that they will take full responsibility in this incredible undertaking. From the public interest standpoint, it is AOL and Time Warner's responsibility, I think, to handle the future in such a manner that your handling of both distribution and content will not produce an unfair advantage in the marketplace. Many of your competitors are expected to follow your lead in the future, so you have a grave responsibility to lead us all bravely and courageously and responsibly into the 21st Century. Many have already formed opinions on what the future holds, but nobody really knows what the future may hold. I am particularly interested in this in terms of the bottom line, what it does to the life of the average American. Does this merger help the average consumer of goods and services and information in America? I will be looking forward to your responses. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Senator Burns. Thank you, Senator. Twenty years of officiating football, I assume the captains have introduced themselves. I will toss the coin to see who gets to kick and who gets to receive, but whoever would like to lead, and we welcome Steve Case and Gerry Levin, and we appreciate your attendance here this morning, as there is quite a lot of swirl around this proposed merger, and a lot of information, so we thank you for coming this morning, and whoever would like to lead. STATEMENT OF STEVE CASE, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, AMERICA ONLINE Mr. Case. I will start. We certainly understand the ground rules in terms of who is kicking and who is receiving. You get to kick, and we are here to respond as best we can. [Laughter.] Senator Burns, I really enjoyed your opening statement, but then you came to the however, and it got a little more troubling. I look forward to talking about instant messaging, and privacy, and open access, and some of the other issues that have been raised, and I apologize to Senator Rockefeller for somehow having his family name dragged into this. [Laughter.] I also am reluctant to go forward with this statement after Senator Stevens' comments, but I do think it answers many of the questions that have been raised. As a starting point I think it would be worth moving through it, and I will try to do it quickly. We see this merger, as you might imagine, as an opportunity to increase consumer choice and to spur new innovation, and to build further on notions of consumer trust and confidence and to really--I think it is something you all referenced in your comments, to extent the benefits of this Internet revolution to everybody. In a few short years the Internet has already begun to transform our every-day lives and our businesses, and our schools certainly, and our homes, and also in our Government today we are on the verge of what we think will be a second Internet revolution, and it is a time of incredible innovation and intense competition. We welcome that competition, because we believe our companies and this new company will be stronger because of it, so while we believe the combination of our companies will allow us to make the most of what we see as the changing world, there are a few things that will not change. First, we will continue to provide consumers with the broadest, most empowering range of choices, fostering the innovation and competition that are the Internet's driving force. In the Internet age, companies must constantly innovate if they expect to succeed, and history shows that the most powerful innovations are created when we find new ways to join the emerging technology with existing content. We hope AOL-Time Warner will lead a new era of innovation within our industry by providing consumers with an ever- expanding array of content from music, to movies, to publishing, to communications, to financial services, and AOL- Time Warner will never limit content diversity on any of our systems. If we did try to do that, consumers would waste no time in migrating to other Internet and media services. A second commitment is, we will continue working to earn consumers' trust and confidence. At AOL, we have put in place what we think is the best privacy policy in the industry, built on core principles of notice and choice. The same is true for Time Warner, a company that is committed to journalistic integrity and consumer choice both on and offline. I want to thank this Committee for keeping consumer trust and confidence at the top of your agenda. Many companies, including both Time Warner and AOL, supported legislation to put in place protections for information about children using the Internet could not be gathered without parental consent. We understand the importance of trust to Internet consumers. As you know, the FTC is reviewing our industry's self-regulatory efforts. Armed with the information the FTC report will provide, we can engage in a deliberative process among Members of Congress and the industry and consumers which will tell us whether other privacy legislation is necessary, and I will personally be happy to work with you to try to reach the best result. One thing is certain, though. We share the same goal, which is protecting consumers and their families by establishing a new standard of privacy and security for the digital age, while permitting the Internet to continue to flourish. Third, we will continue to work to implement open access, further increasing consumer's choices and enriching their online experience. Last year, as has been mentioned, I told this Committee that history demonstrates that as long as infrastructure on which the Internet is built remains open, competition and innovation will flourish, and the Government and industry should work together to ensure a vibrant Internet marketplace. We are seeing real progress in the marketplace on implementing open access, and we are proud of the role we have played in stimulating that progress. Implementation of open access all across the Nation is no longer a question of whether, but rather, of when. On the day we announced this merger, AOL and Time Warner committed to open its cable network for competition through multiple ISP's. This week, we took the next step, releasing a memorandum of understanding that will form the framework for delivering AOL and other ISP's over Time Warner cable, and give consumers real choice. Let me be very clear about what that framework means for consumers. Broadband consumers will not go through AOL unless they choose AOL. If they choose another Internet service provider, they will not see AOL or its front screen, and they will not be blocked from any content they wish to see. That is real open access, and it is the right policy grounded in the right principles for consumers, for the cable industry, and for the growth of the Internet. Finally, we will continue to broaden the reach and extend the benefits of the Internet, leaving no community behind. Both AOL and Time Warner have taken significant steps to help close the digital divide, the gap between those who have access to these new tools and those who do not. At AOL we are helping to launch PowerUP, a private public partnership to teach young people the skills they need and give them the guidance they need to make the most of their potential in this new, connected world. This is not just a problem of the inner city. That is why the AOL Foundation created the AOL Rural Telecommunications Awards, which awarded grants to people who are using the interactive medium to revitalize towns with less than 10,000 people. We will take this challenge seriously at AOL Time Warner, not only as a company, but as individuals with a shared personal conviction that we must use our leadership to build a better world. These are the issues we all need to address to truly build a global medium that empowers people and truly benefits society, not just the Internet industry. The truth is, as many of you know, without the Government's leadership on projects like ARPANET, and without the support to the NSF, the Internet would still be a distant dream. Without your leadership and support in the future, the Internet may never reach its full potential. We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to shape this medium while it is still young, and there is definitely room for a continuing partnership between Government and industry to ensure we do it right. I appreciate the time and effort the Committee is taking to hear about this important merger, and I thank you in advance for the work you will continue to do in the months and years ahead. Together, we believe we can build a medium that will improve people's lives and a medium we can be proud of. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Case follows:] Prepared Statement of Steve Case, Chairman and CEO, America Online Good morning, Chairman Burns, Senator Hollings and Members of the Committee. As you know, on January 10, AOL and Time Warner announced our plan to join our two companies--creating the world's first truly global media and communications company for the Internet Century. We see this merger as an opportunity to increase consumer choice and spur new innovation, to build consumer trust and confidence, and to extend the benefits of the Internet Revolution to every community. We intend to make the most of this opportunity. In a few short years, the Internet has already begun to transform the way we live our lives--changing the way we communicate with friends, family and even our political leaders, the way we shop and are entertained, the way we strengthen our communities at home and build the world community. Now, we are on the verge of a second Internet revolution. Technological advances are increasing the range of online content people can enjoy and use--from cable broadband, satellite, and DSL connections, to a new generation of wireless and handheld devices that make the Internet available anywhere, at any time. This is also a time of incredible innovation and intense competition. We welcome that and believe that our new Company will be stronger because of it. The Internet never could have become a driving force of the new economy--and neither AOL nor Time Warner could have gotten where we are today--without consumer-driven competition. Change this fast and far-reaching brings with it new opportunities--but it also brings new responsibilities. So, while we believe that the combination of our companies will allow us to make the most of the changing world, there are a few things we won't change: First, we will continue to provide consumers with the broadest, most empowering range of choices, fostering the innovation and competition that are the Internet's driving force. Second, we will continue to work hard to earn their trust and confidence. Third, we will continue to work to implement open access--further increasing consumer's choices and enriching their online experience. Finally, we will continue to broaden the reach and extend the benefits of the Internet--leaving no community behind. Let me start with our first and most important commitment at AOL Time Warner: empowering consumers and encouraging innovation. In our business, consumers are the ultimate venture capitalists-- they guide our business models and drive our ideas. Consumers have been empowered, and they are exercising their power every day--seeking out the Internet service that meets their needs and the content that matches their interests: movies, books, stock quotes, even polling data. One thing the last few years have made crystal clear is that in a rapidly changing, Internet-supercharged economy, companies must constantly innovate and continuously remake themselves if they expect to attract customers. And history tells us that the most profound, life-changing ideas come to life when people find valuable new ways to join emerging technology with existing content. HBO combined the idea of cable television and Hollywood movies--and transformed the way we think about entertainment. CNN took cable into the realm of TV news--and changed the way we learn about the world. In the same way, VCRs transformed the movie industry, and CD technology transformed the music industry. We hope AOL Time Warner will lead a similar new era of innovation-- providing consumers with an ever-expanding range of content across industries, across platforms, across media--from music to movies to publishing to communications to financial services. And, let me be very clear: AOL Time Warner will never limit content diversity on any of our systems. If we limit content, if we do not promote a diversity of voices, if we do not maintain scrupulous journalistic standards, then consumers will waste no time migrating to other Internet and media services. Second, AOL Time Warner will build on the consumer trust and confidence that have made our brands among the most trusted in the business. As separate companies, we have made a commitment to consumers--and we have kept it. As one company, we will continue to make that commitment--and we will continue to keep it. We will take building consumer confidence and trust to the next level--working within our industry and with all of you to craft responsive and responsible policies that address consumers' concerns. Let me clarify what I mean by this. The Internet will never reach its full potential if people don't feel comfortable and secure using it--nor will they let their children use it. This Committee and others know this, and I want to thank you for keeping these issues at the top of your agenda. At AOL, we have put in place what we think is the best privacy policy in the industry, built on core principles of notice and choice. The same is true for Time Warner--a company that is committed to journalistic integrity and consumer trust, both on and offline. As you know, many companies, including both Time Warner and AOL, supported legislation last year to put in place special protections for children using the Internet so that information about them cannot be gathered without parental consent. We understand the importance of trust to Internet consumers--and I would be happy to work with any of you to determine if other privacy legislation is necessary and when it should be pushed forward. I believe that any legislation that this Committee considers should be looked at only after the FTC has had a chance to do its review of current self regulatory efforts and the FTC's Committee on Access and Security has issued its report. This way, we will have the information we need to engage in a deliberative process among Members of Congress, the industry and consumers--and that is how we will reach the best result. Our commitment to build consumer trust and confidence doesn't stop there. We have also provided ``Parental Controls'' for families and teachers to customize their children's experience in cyberspace. I am proud that nearly 80% of America Online's members with children in the home use Parental Controls today. One thing is certain--we share the same goal: protecting consumers and their families and establishing a new standard of privacy and security for the digital age, while permitting the Internet to flourish in these changing times. Third, we will make open access a reality for consumers--further increasing their choices and enriching their online experience. Last year, I appeared before this Committee to talk about this issue. I said then--and I believe just as strongly today--that the history of the Internet has demonstrated that as long as the infrastructure on which it rests is open, competition and innovation will flourish. I also said that I believed government and industry must work together to ensure a vibrant Internet marketplace. For the most part, people in government agreed on the goal but wanted it to happen in the marketplace. We are now seeing real movement in the marketplace--and I'm proud of the role we've played in bringing us to this point. Our push on this issue, along with the calls for action by consumer advocates and government leaders, has led to significant progress in the past year toward consumer choice in cable broadband service. Implementation of open access nationwide is no longer a question of whether, but of when. As you know, on the day we announced our merger, AOL and Time Warner committed to making its cable network open for competition by multiple ISPs and to provide open access. This week, we took the next important step forward, jointly releasing a Memorandum of Understanding that will form the framework for delivering AOL and other ISPs over Time Warner cable--and give consumers greater choice. We are looking forward to putting that framework into practice as soon as possible. For now, I would like to be very clear about what it means, in simple terms, for consumers. Broadband consumers will not go through AOL unless they choose AOL. If they choose another Internet Service Provider, they will not see AOL or its front screen. And they will not be blocked from any content they wish to see. That's meaningful open access. I have believed for a long time that open access and consumer choice among ISPs is the right policy, grounded in the right principles, for consumers and the growth of the Internet. I am also convinced it is the smartest business practice for the cable industry and the future of cable Internet service. And so we are committed to working together with our industry to ensure that open access is common practice--and that consumers across the country are the real beneficiaries. Finally, AOL Time Warner will be committed to ensuring that the benefits and opportunities of the Internet reach every community-- leaving no one behind. The Commerce Department--and this Committee--recognized early on that there is a widening gap between people who have access to the new technology and know how to use it, and those who do not. This ``Digital Divide'' threatens to place the promise of information technology beyond the reach of those who stand to benefit from it the most. Both AOL and Time Warner have already taken significant steps to do our part to close the Digital Divide. I am proud of the role we are playing at AOL to help launch PowerUP, a unique public-private partnership to create a network of community technology centers that teach young people the skills they need--and that give them the guidance they need--to make the most of their potential. Contrary to common perception, this is not just a problem in the inner city. In fact, rural Americans are much less likely than their urban counterparts to have computers, e-mail, even basics like phone lines. That's why the AOL Foundation, together with the National Center for Small Communities, created the AOL Rural Telecommunications Awards. Last year, we awarded $10,000 in grants to four winners who are using the interactive medium to revitalize towns of 10,000 people or less. One of the things I am most looking forward to at AOL Time Warner is joining our resources and sharing our ideas to close the Digital Divide. We take this challenge seriously, not only as a company, but also as individuals with a shared personal conviction that we must use our leadership to build a better world. These are the issues we need to address to build a truly global medium that empowers people and benefits society. And when I say we, I mean all of us. I don't just mean the Internet and communications industry. I mean consumer groups and community leaders, and I mean government. The truth is, without the government's leadership and support--on projects like ARPANET and its support through the National Science Foundation--the Internet would still be a distant dream. And without your leadership and support in the future, the Internet may never reach its full potential. We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity now to shape this medium while it still young--and do it the right way. So, I appreciate the time and effort the Committee is taking to hear about this important merger, and I thank you in advance for the work you will continue to do in the months and years ahead. Together, we will build a medium that improves people's lives--and one we can all be proud of. Thank you. Senator Burns. Mr. Levin. STATEMENT OF GERALD LEVIN, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, TIME WARNER, INC. Mr. Levin. Thank you, Chairman Burns and Senator Hollings, and all the Members of the Committee. I have to start by saying that I feel very comfortable being in this Committee room because we have, in fact, been working together for so many years, I think with the common goal of delivering to consumers the broadest choices in telecommunications and media. We have worked together on telephone competition, the satellite delivery of broadcast programs, the advent of digital television and, of course, cable deregulation. I think one common aspect of all of that has been to try and do something that makes sense for the consumer in the face of rapidly expanding technology, and that is really where we are today, so I am proud that we have shared the same goals, and actually would like to acknowledge your recent success in the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act and certainly, of course, in what I think was landmark legislation, the 1996 Telecommunications Act. Just a brief word of my history. For almost three decades, actually going back to a time when some cable mavericks like myself and Ted Turner had what then seemed a quixotic dream of overthrowing the stranglehold that the network triopoly had on the basic form of communication, television, and I am pleased to say that that dream has been realized because today we have returned power to the consumer, the viewer, to choose what she or he wants. I am also very pleased with the array of programming that cable has stimulated, from premium services like Home Box Office to very significant networks like CNN, Disney, Discovery, ESPN, Nickelodeon, CNBC, and of course, C-SPAN, which provides a tremendous public service. Also, encouraged by a lot of that activity, we built in 1994 the first true switch digital interactive system in Orlando, Florida. We learned a lot from that experience, and were encouraged by it, so much so that we now see, with the advent of the Internet--and our own expenditure in the last 4 or 5 years has now passed $6 billion to upgrade our systems--to have developed the kind of digital bank account that can accommodate so many different opportunities for the consumer. I would like to go back and just again commend the Committee for the 1996 Telecommunications Act, because I think that really was the landmark shift that enabled almost everything that has occurred since that time. It was that Act which shifted telecommunications policy from relying on regulation to a policy fostering competition amongst industry players. Let me quote from the preamble of the 1996 Act describing your vision ``to provide for a procompetitive deregulatory national policy framework designed to accelerate rapidly private sector deployment of advanced telecommunications and information technologies and services to all Americans.'' With the onset of the Internet, which is by far the most profound revolution certainly in any of our history, and probably for the republic itself, you have something that is wildly democratic (lower case d) with no central control whether by a Government agency or by any corporation. Indeed, any citizen in any part of the world is free to publish on the Internet. It is the most extraordinary event I think in the course of human history, because for the first time we have truly a networked society. So AOL Time Warner was really born to be a new kind of company for the 21st Century. I know we have talked about the economic size of this transaction, but I can assure you that there were three philosophic areas that I had to satisfy myself on with respect to this combination that were actually much more important than the financial characteristics of the transaction. The first is something that is a part of our heritage at Time Warner, and that is journalistic independence. I feel my trusteeship--and now through AOL Time Warner, and confirmed by Steve Case, is that we are here to preserve, protect, and defend CNN and Time Magazine and the journalistic independence that they operate under without fear or favor, or any kind of business encroachment. That is the first fundamental principle to which we mutually have attested. Second, and not just because we are here, or are engaged in hearings this week, we have agreed on the principle of nondiscriminatory access, and what that means, and I will state it flat out, is that with respect to Time Warner cable systems no preference will be shown for affiliated services, soon to be AOL Time Warner, versus unaffiliated services. We have a long history of doing that, not just because it makes good policy, but because it absolutely corresponds to what the consumer wants, consumer choice. On the flip side of that coin, I would also say to you that there is no intention that the wonderfully diverse material, creative material coming from Time Warner will be exclusively distributed through AOL, so these are principles that we both agreed to. On Tuesday, as you know, we put out a Memorandum of Understanding, to which we are both committed. Finally, and probably most importantly, is a sense of shared values. I know that the Committee and the Congress is the proprietor of the public interest, but in even the history of my own company, in Henry Luce's will there was a statement that the company is to be operated not just in the interest of shareholders, but in the public interest, and in fact both Time Warner and AOL share this social commitment. So this is not a question of being the largest company. This is a question of whether we can use the skills and the resources in the private sector, working cooperatively with the public sector and foundations and educational institutions to make a difference in the public we serve. So that we hold the following values to be truly significant. The issue of privacy is not for us simply a matter of business practice. It's just fundamental to respecting human dignity, and we will talk more about that. The phrase, the digital divide, is something that we take seriously because it is an apt description of the continuation of the inequality in this Nation that is now going to be unfortunately hastened. AOL has been not only on record but Steve Case is personally committed to meeting that challenge, so that we do not end up with an information aristocracy. And then finally, I would say something that we have not heard yet this morning, but that is really the importance of education, and what can we do with this combination, with this technology. Really, our ultimate responsibility is with respect to the young people not only in our country but around the world. Frankly we view this, and I view it personally, as a moral imperative. When I see the conditions that some of our most gifted teachers have to operate under, we are bound and determined to make a difference there. So I guess I should stop. We have put our full statement in the record, Mr. Chairman. I would be happy to answer questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Levin follows:] Prepared Statement of Gerald Levin, Chairman and CEO, Time Warner, Inc. Chairman Burns, Senator Hollings and Members of the Committee, I'm very pleased to be appearing before you today. I feel at home in this Committee room where we have worked together over many years to deliver consumers the broadest choices in telecommunications and media. From telephone competition to satellite delivery of broadcast programs to digital television to cable deregulation, we've shared a goal of creating consumer choice in both content and distribution in the context of ever-changing technology. I am proud to share these goals with you and sincerely acknowledge your many successes, most recently in the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act and, of course, the landmark 1996 Telecommunications Act. I'm particularly grateful for this opportunity to speak about the planned merger between Time Warner and AOL and will be glad to answer any questions you might have. I know our merger announcement came as a surprise to many, and the truth is for such a large transaction, it was worked out in a remarkably short period of time. From my perspective, the AOL-Time Warner merger wasn't a bolt from the blue, but the fulfillment of almost three decades spent in the media business. I began my career with the quixotic hope--or so it seemed--of using cable television to overthrow the stranglehold the broadcast triopoly had on television. Mavericks like Ted Turner and myself believed that the real power of television would only be unleashed when it became a medium driven by consumer choice, with programming alternatives far beyond what three advertising-supported networks could deliver. The success of that once-radical notion is reflected today in premier pay-television networks like Time Warner's Home Box Office, and our cable systems' lineup of hugely popular networks such as CNN, TBS, Disney, Discovery, ESPN, Nickelodeon, CNBC. . . . The list is long. Although we'd never claim that this early experience with cable gave us a clairvoyant glimpse of the Internet, it was profoundly formative. I for one was left with the conviction that we'd barely touched the potential of technology to empower viewers to become their own programmers, with no real limits on their options. Possessed of this belief, I committed my company in 1994 to the deployment of the world's first fully interactive digital network in our Orlando, Florida, cable system. Short term, that full service network didn't instantly lead to the rollout of interactive television. Long term, the risk Time Warner took resulted in our cable engineers creating a breakthrough architecture that melded fiber-optic trunk lines with the coaxial connection to subscriber homes to offer a switched broadband avenue for interactivity. In 1995, Time Warner made a $5 billion commitment to rebuild its systems with this broadband architecture--a commitment which now stands at $6 billion. In fact, my faith in cable's pivotal part in the future of digital interactivity was so strong that at a time when reregulation put cable out of favor with investors, Time Warner undertook major acquisitions to expand its cable footprint. In 1996, the Members of this Committee recognized that exciting new services could flourish only if the policy paradigm shifted its focus from relying on regulation to fostering competition among industry players. The preamble of the 1996 Telecommunications Act aptly describes your vision ``. . . to provide for a pro-competitive, de- regulatory national policy framework designed to accelerate rapidly private sector deployment of advanced telecommunications and information technologies and services to all Americans . . .'' it was that historic shift in policy that significantly contributed to the growing certainty that something profound was taking place in the telecommunications sector. We are grateful for your wisdom in creating the policy environment that allowed that to happen. From the very moment Time Warner was opening the way for broadband delivery, the first great wave of a truly networked society arrived in the form of the Internet. Today, we're all awash in that wave, or better yet, surfing it, and the sea change has been so sweeping and profound that it's hard to believe that the word Internet itself didn't enter Webster's until 1997. The growth of the Internet over so short a time reflects the sheer velocity of what's taking place: in 1995, there were 19 million Internet users; five years later, over 200 million. That number will cross one billion by mid-decade. Led by America Online's easy-to-use, consumer-friendly service, a constantly increasing number of people are making e-mail, instant messaging and e-commerce an integral part of how they live, work and communicate. It would be hard to exaggerate the implications of the Internet revolution. For the first time, human beings have at their disposal a universal, limitless connection that no government, corporation or centralized agency can control. Every user has the ability to offer something new. Every web site contains the possibility of meeting consumer needs in more attractive, efficient ways, so that the noise you hear across the economic landscape is that of time-honored--in some cases, centuries-old--business hierarchies as they crash to the ground. The first lesson of the Internet has already been written: if you think you can do business in the realm of digital interactivity the way you've always done business, think again. . . . Thinking again is precisely what Time Warner has been doing for the last five years, as we refocused on achieving a company wide digital transformation. I've spoken of what that digital transformation did for our cable customers, providing broadband capacity for high-speed delivery of the Internet. But that was part of a far larger effort. Our multi-billion dollar upgrade also allows us to offer many of the enhanced services our consumers are so eager for. These include increased video offerings, digital television, interactive services and soon, telephony services over the same architecture. As you know, we currently provide facilities based telephone service to businesses through our competitive local exchange carrier. We intend to provide local residential telephone service and, ultimately IP telephony, which we are now testing in Portland, Maine. Impelled by the nature of our content businesses--operations intimately involved with artistic and intellectual expression in every form--we were pioneers in adapting our flow of creative offerings to this environment. People throughout Time Warner understood the irrevocable impact of what was occurring. They embraced the almost inconceivably broad canvas the Internet provides for expanding the reach of their minds and imaginations. The challenge for Time Warner was never facing up to the historic significance of digital interactivity. We jumped that hurdle while other media companies were still debating if there was a race. The challenge was time. The global economy in general and the global media industry in particular are on fast forward. They have entered a new context: Internet time. As you know, America's leadership in deploying and using the Internet around the world is unique. However, there exists the fierce competitive determination of entrepreneurs across the globe to catch and surpass us. From my early conversations with Steve, it became clear that we both understood that those who wished to stay ahead in the instant-to- instant evolution of this medium didn't have the luxury of waiting on events. We saw that the company of the future--a company with the creative infrastructure to provide a constant stream of quality content plus a genetic appreciation of how to form web communities and how to serve them easily and conveniently--had yet to come into existence. The solution to that puzzle was quickly obvious to both of us: by putting together AOL and Time Warner, we could create the first enterprise not only fully prepared to compete on the Internet--a prototype for the 21st century--but a company that could be a decisive spur to bringing consumers everywhere the speed and immediacy of broadband across all delivery platforms, wired or wireless, thus unlocking the fullest possibilities of interactivity. For my part, while the economic rationale for our merger was compelling, it wasn't sufficient. Before I could take the step of joining America Online in a merger of equals, I had to satisfy myself about three basic premises. First, at the very core of Time Warner--the cornerstone of our global reputation and the enduring basis of the bond of trust we've created with audiences in every part of the world--is commitment to journalistic independence. Ten years ago, in the landmark decision that allowed the Time- Warner merger to go forward, Chancellor William Allen of Delaware's chancery court spoke of our journalistic culture as ``unique,'' and deserving of protection and preservation. The addition of CNN in 1996 made that culture even richer and more far-reaching. I have always regarded the defense of that heritage as utterly central to my responsibilities as CEO, and in light of the continuing expansion of news and information outlets--many of which we carry on our cable systems--I've had a heightened awareness of Time Warner and CNN's role in upholding the standard for reliable, unbiased journalism. Steve Case has been equally clear about his unwavering commitment to journalistic independence, and his unprompted offer to have me serve as CEO of AOL Time Warner was a further reaffirmation of that belief. Second, as a prime mover in the design, development and deployment of broadband networks, Time Warner assumed the huge financial risk of that investment in the face of strong competition from DSL, DBS and other broadband providers. In building our broadband capacity, we recognized not just the possibility of consumers having a choice among ISPs but the desirability. Historically, as we learned so clearly with HBO, the provision of choice is a boon to the dynamic growth of cable subscriptions and a prod to the creation of new and better programming. AOL and Time Warner now have a shared commitment in the form of a Memorandum of Understanding between our companies to provide consumers with multiple ISPs in a genuinely competitive broadband marketplace, and we will be happy to elaborate on that commitment. Third, fundamental to how Time Warner defines itself is our sense of community responsibility. This has been basic to who we are from the very beginning, and was best summed up in Henry Luce's formulation that we would always operate ``in the public interest as well as the interest of shareholders.'' But we're under no illusions. Like you, we recognize the need for a significant increase in corporate involvement focused on helping equip schools with the resources they need to prepare students to enter the digital economy. Personally, as someone who has witnessed firsthand the struggle of dedicated teachers to overcome the shameful inequalities embedded in our educational systems, I regard this need as a moral obligation. As the Members of this Committee have so frequently articulated, if ever there's been ``a clear and present danger'' to the future of American society, it's in the ``digital divide'' that threatens to aggravate long-standing patterns of discrimination and injustice. From the inception of my discussions with Steve Case, I've been impressed with the passionate sincerity of his desire to ensure that his company plays an important role in bridging that divide. Nothing has been more crucial to the agreement we've reached to merge our companies than our vision of AOL Time Warner's ability to be a catalyst for meaningful change in the way our country--indeed, our world--offers its children the opportunity for creative expression, intellectual enrichment and material success. As large as our merger may seem, it pales beside the open-ended expanse of broadband media, and the wired and wireless access available through PCs, TVs and the burgeoning multiplicity of hand-held devices. From the consumer's point of view, the intense--and intensifying-- competitive struggle to offer everything from telephony to digital downloading of music and entertainment to video on demand embodies the best of all possible worlds: more choice, better value and lower prices. And all that can be offered to consumers while still protecting their privacy, an issue of vital public interest that I pledge AOL Time Warner will continue to address in the most serious manner. Members of the Committee, I'm grateful for this chance to express to you my bedrock belief in the positive implications of the merger between AOL and Time Warner. Although the age we've entered will be brutally unsparing of companies that can't or won't move fast enough, it will also empower citizens as never before. If we do it right--and I'm profoundly optimistic that a clear understanding by both the private and public sectors of what's involved will ensure we do--we will add new dimensions to our economy and our democracy. I think it's obvious that AOL Time Warner is only the first of many competitive realignments intended to form enterprises with the agility and array of resources to thrive on this new terrain. Given the talent, imagination and values that AOL Time Warner will possess, I'm also confident it will be the most socially responsible and competitively successful. Along with my colleagues at AOL and Time Warner, I look forward to working with you to make sure that individuals and communities everywhere can use the most powerfully liberating communications tool in human history to amplify and inspire, in Jefferson's wonderful phrase, ``the pursuit of happiness.'' Thank you. Senator Burns. Thank you very much, and both of your full statements will be made a part of the record. I am also going to ask unanimous consent that the MOU will be made a part of the record also, and the letter that Chairman Hollings and I received yesterday. * --------------------------------------------------------------------------- * The information referred to was not available at the time this hearing went to press. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Senator Burns. I want to talk a little bit about this instant messaging. As you know, as we moved through the 1996 Act, we knew how difficult it was going to be to deal with the incumbent entity in the exchange business, in the telephones. We know that was going to be one of the most difficult areas, to unbundle and to deregulate. After all, this industry had been in the regulatory cocoon for so many years. And as I look at instant messaging, I am seeing we have to avoid, later on, dealing with this situation here with maybe an incumbent in the business of instant messaging. I would ask the--so far we have shown very little in the area of developing systems that are interoperable, and I wish you could bring this Committee up to date, Mr. Case, on where we are in that, and sort of the five W's we are asking, and if you could bring us up to date, and I may have another question, another followup question with that. Mr. Case. Sure. I look forward to it. First of all, it is interesting to think of ourselves as an incumbent, since in 1996 I think we had maybe a few hundred thousand customers, and we were struggling to just stay in business. As it relates to instant messaging specifically, the letter that I received--I think it is the same one you said--stated the following: our sole concern--this is all the companies raising this concern to you. Our sole concern is with ensuring that all Internet users can enjoy the immense benefits of fully interoperable instant messaging capabilities, and avoid the dangers of a balkanized system. That is precisely what we are working to achieve, so let me give you some background on this and the progress we have made. We invented this notion of instant messaging more than 15 years ago, when we launched our first service in the fall if 1985. That was at a time when people thought this was just about accessing news, or buying things, and maybe getting people to talk to each other would be useful. We thought building a sense of community was important, and we invested in building this notion of instant messaging, and for a decade, the only way to get that feature was to subscribe to our service. Several years ago we thought, because of the importance of messaging, that we should not require somebody to be a subscriber to AOL to benefit from this instant messaging capability, so I think it was about 2 years ago we decided to release AOL Instant Messenger as a free product on the Web, free to download, and free to use, so that anybody who wanted to participate in this instant messaging community could get it for free, and use it for free, which was a sort of unusual step, people thought when we took that. Then, starting about 18 months ago, we started hearing from some companies that said, we really want to work with you to be part of this messaging community, we do not want a balkanized role, we want an inclusive role, and asked if we would make our technology, our protocols available to them so they could build their own instant messaging software. And over the ensuing year and a half, and particularly in the last few months, we have signed, now, a dozen agreements, including the leaders in the corporate community, including IBM and Sun and Novell, and leaders in portals, such as Lycos, and leaders in Internet service provisions, such as MindSpring and EarthLink, and this week we announced certain wireless initiatives with Motorola and Nokia and Bell South, and we also--I remember doing a deal with Apple and Real Network, so there are many, many companies that we basically allowed to use these protocols to build their own products, to call it whatever they want. For example, I think it is the Lycos Instant Messenger, not the AOL Instant Messenger for Lycos. So we have taken a lot of steps to make it an inclusive community. We have licensed it broadly. I think the licensing policy we have had is quite unusual in the software industry. It is not something you see from Microsoft or Sun or other companies. I do not know of any other company that has basically made its software freely available to users, and easily licensed to other companies on a royalty-free basis, so I think we have done a number of things to create this inclusive community. We have not licensed it to everybody. There are some companies, unfortunately, that have chosen to hack into our servers, as opposed to license this. We think it is very important, in the recent spate of problems with cyber terrorism and Web sites, to indicate how important it is to protect the safety and security and privacy of people, so we have some minimal standards. People have to agree to participate, and what we are talking about is not just software, but also the community, and when you use this instant messaging software you actually communicate with our servers that we are paying for and participate in this community that everybody can be part of. So I would say that we should be applauded for innovating and creating instant messaging, for then taking the step of making it freely available to any consumer anywhere in the world. They can get the software for free and the servers for free and then licensing it on very straightforward terms to most of the leading companies around the world, and we will continue to do that, working with other companies and other groups to try to make this notion of messaging part of our future. Senator Burns. Thank you very much. I am going to move on. Do you have opening statements? I am sorry, Senator Snowe. Senator Abraham. No statements. I am going to move right along, and so everybody has a chance, Senator Hollings. Senator Hollings. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and right to the point, we admire both of you. You are brilliant, and you have been very successful. This Committee is not against success, and incidentally we are not against innovation. You have got to be innovative to keep pace with fast-breaking technology. Mr. Chairman, let me ask that you put in the holdings here of Time Warner, the Columbia Journalism Review. There are five pages of holdings there. I would like to also add into the record the Internet service providers, a list of those, their rankings, the service providers, showing America Online is seven times bigger than its nearest competitor and generally 100 times bigger than the rest.

It was last updated on February 25, 2000. The point of this page is to track the relative sizes of the larger Internet Service Providers, where size is measured by some notion of the extent of their customer base. Very little information has been made publically available on this, and as far as I can tell, no attempt has ever been made to collate it. The purpose of this page is to make this attempt. It will disappear if anyone with real time and resources ever decides to track this information and make it public. Since the page has been around since the summer of 1998 and this has not yet happened, this doesn't look too likely. About the only way to gain real information on the size of the customer base of any ISP is via their own announcements. Because of various ISP's philosophies regarding disclosure, some of this data comes from far more accurate and up-to-date sources than others. This is an unfortunate necessity. Of course, we have no real idea what the methodology is that they are using, nor can we tell whether these numbers are in any way accurate. Further, as is especially the case for the free service ISPs, it's hard to gain consensus on what these numbers mean, or how meaningful they are. Nonetheless, this information can show some relative sizes without needing to be horribly accurate. The vast majority of the information here is compiled by me as I read various sources of ISP news. A sizeable fraction of the data is submitted to me by kind souls from around the Internet. This page is better for everyone because of their contributions. If you ever hear an ISP quote its size in any non-confidential context, please email this number to me, the name of the ISP, and information I can use to cite the figure. I don't intend to quote a number I cannot verify. Of course, representatives of the ISPs themselves are invited to send me their numbers when they can be disclosed publicly. The goal of this page is to list every ISP doing business in the United States that can legitimately claim more than 100,000 subscribers and list their actual size as accurately as possible. Some are listed that are smaller than this threshold, but I make no commitment to try to list these, especially if they do not have a nationwide or at least a large regional presence. This is the information I have been able to find so far, along with a set of ISPs that may also be of sufficient size, but for whom I have no information. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ISP Subscribership Date Source ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- America Online 21,000,000 20000202 CNET News ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- EarthLink 3,100,000 20000204 CBS MarketWatch ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NetZero 3,000,000 20000110 Yahoo! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Compuserve (AOL) 2,500,000 20000119 AOL web site ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Prodigy 2,000,000 19991122 Yahoo!

Now, having said that, what I am looking for is your statement here about open access, and I see that on open access there are two references here, one with respect, Mr. Case, to AOL 5.0. Can we call--this has just come out, just get along with AOL 5.0. If America Online is your only route online, sure, but people who juggle multiple Internet providers have had a different story to tell, after having their other accounts incapacitated by the new version of America Online's software. Then they say, for example, when you call and reference them, AOL spokesman Tricia Primrose said we have seen very few problems like the ones you describe, but, says this individual, we called AOL--this was a Washington Post reporter, and I will give you a copy of the story. When we called AOL technical support instead we waited on hold for 55 minutes and then were quizzed as to why we would want to have another ISP. But AOL's representative did eventually come through with repair instructions. I am seeing that. All the emphasis about, yeah, we have access, but that does not amount to access, and then when you intimidate even the powerhouse Disney--you recently moved the cartoon network of your own entity from Channel 67 in New York to Channel 22, but you took the Disney Channel from 33, and you put it up to 66. The Disney people are afraid to come and testify, because we don't want to irritate the Lone Ranger. You have gotten powerful enough now where they say, good gosh, we just changed, whereby you favored your own content and repositioned everything, and if we come up and we say what we are really afraid of, we will get cutoff further. In the past year, America Online has entered into strategic relationships with Gateway, Compaq, and just last month Dell, and then you have deals with Hewlett-Packard and Ace. Now, these manufacturers constitute over 50 percent of the market. That is why I said in my opening comment that I was worried that you were going down the same road as Microsoft. There is nothing wrong with having a monopoly. It is whether you use the monopoly to abuse the process and withstand competition, and that is what we are looking at here in this Committee. We do not want to have to legislate and mess up the wonderful communications and electronics explosion, but when we see these trends, when we see you have already got four class actions and everybody moving, and you keep moving, you talk access but you have to wait 55 minutes to even get it explained; when you see that you are powerful enough to take even again the more powerful and get them afraid to come and even testify because they might get put off the channel, much less a bad spot on the channel--let me hear your comments, both of you. That is what this Committee is worried about. Mr. Case. I would be happy to respond. Gerry can add to it. First, in our industry there are all kinds of data. Some of it is more accurate than others, but I think if you look at the recent statistics we are not seven times bigger than our next largest competitor. There have actually been some mergers with MindSpring and EarthLink. That we are the leader by far, and we are grateful so many consumers have agreed to subscribe to us, but you said something like 100 times bigger than the rest, and that is not really the dynamics. We are the leader in our market. Time Warner is the leader in several markets. We are not dominant in anything, and I think any comparison to Microsoft is not an accurate one. As it relates to AOL 5.0, there is a number of points there. We integrate the Microsoft Windows dialer protocol within our software because it runs on top of the Windows operating system. It is the same thing that almost all the ISP's do, including AT&T and Microsoft and MindSpring and Earthlink. 95 percent of our customers do not use another ISP, and for them this is a more seamless experience. If you are in the 5 percent that want to use a multiple ISP you are able to do that, and if you call us we will explain how to do it. We have recently posted some information online. I am sorry to hear anybody had to wait 55 minutes. We actually have 7,000 people and spend quite a bit of money to make sure if people do have a problem they can get a response quite promptly. I think that has been helpful in terms of growing our business and the loyalty of our members. As it relates to Disney, certainly Gerry understands Disney better. I am surprised to hear that Disney is intimidated. We have discussions with them on many things. I do not think the debate over channel placement is going to be quite the same in the future that perhaps it was in the past. If you have a world like the Internet with almost infinite choices, there is not a notion of channel placement. They make their own decisions about what content goes on their own ABC Network and things like that, so I am surprised to hear them apparently suggesting privately to you that there is some issue there, but maybe I should talk directly with them about that. As it relates to Gateway and Dell, we do have agreements with many PC manufacturers, as do almost all the ISP's out there. Consumers have many choices in terms of PC's, and that is why that business is so darned competitive and prices have come down so rapidly, and we are happy to work with PC manufacturers, but there are many that do not work with us, and many that provide many options to their consumers. So hopefully that is responsive to your question. We do believe that we are doing a lot of good things in terms of creating great services. We are not always perfect. Sometimes we make mistakes. We make mistakes, we try to correct them and move on, but I think the fact that we have grown so rapidly in the last few years is really consumers voting, in a world of 7,000 ISP's out there to choose from, that AOL is providing something unique, and we do spend a lot of time and a lot of hard work to try to make that the case, and part of what we provide our members is access to everything. We really do believe that the Internet should be an open platform, and if you sign on to AOL you can go anywhere you want and do anything you want, and the notion of carriage that existed in the traditional world of television, for example, is not really relevant on the Internet, because in a sense it is universal carriage. Nobody has to do anything to get carried. Everybody has it instantaneously, and millions of people have created Web sites, so it is really a new world. I think it requires a fresh perspective, and we are trying to bring it through our company, and this combination I think will allow us to do some more interesting things for more customers in more ways. Mr. Levin. Why don't we have just a brief conversation about channel positioning. I think, Senator Hollings, someone must be referring to the cable system in New York City. It is just a factual misrepresentation. The Disney Channel in New York City is a paid television channel, and so the consumer actually pays for that channel, so the channel positioning as it is with HBO or Cinemax, or the Stars, and Encore, I mean Stars I think is on Channel 90. I have never heard a complaint from them because the consumer knows exactly where to go, because he pays separately for it. The Cartoon Network, in fact, does not compete in that sense with the pay Disney Channel. It really competes with channels like Nickelodeon and, in the City of New York, Nickelodeon is on Channel 6, and the Cartoon Network is on Channel 22. Having said that, a lot of these channels are basically moved around to really accommodate, for example, companies like Disney. Disney has ESPN and ESPN-2, and in many systems they have asked to have their channel moved to a higher position so that the two could be together. And besides, I think we are obviously living in a world where for broadcast stations, where this Committee has--and Disney should certainly be following the public interest. There, you want to keep the channel positioning that people are used to with over-the-air television. But in the case of cable channels you look at the cable channels and the satellite, they could be at 292 or 653. That era has long passed, so I honestly believe this is a spurious issue. Senator Burns. Senator Stevens. STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA Senator Stevens. Let me start off by saying I think you have changed the lifestyle of our country. Having a freshman in college out on the West Coast, we thought we would be an empty nest, but we really find that we are capable of having instant communication throughout the day, and it really has changed a lot, and I cannot thank you enough for what you have done so far. I do want to have just one question, and it sort of has several facets. Sometime ago you announced with your merger that you intended to provide telephony over cable lines. I would like to know if you can give us an update on that, and p"
