        "text": "WASHINGTON — Here in the nation’s capital, AT&T has painted itself as an underdog that needs to merge with Time Warner in a blockbuster $85 billion deal to compete with powerful cable companies.\n\nBut in several cities and states, AT&T’s actions send a different message.\n\nIn Nashville and Louisville, Ky., AT&T has sued to make it harder for rival broadband providers to use utility poles. In Missouri, Tennessee and North Carolina, the company has pushed for laws that block municipal broadband providers. In San Francisco, AT&T has fought efforts to open up apartment buildings to more internet service providers.\n\nIn other words, AT&T has positioned itself as the incumbent telecommunications juggernaut that has acted to hamper competitors locally.\n\nWith its giant deal with Time Warner under review at the Justice Department, AT&T’s contrasting federal and local actions are glaring. While AT&T’s two-sided messaging follows a strategy used by many big companies, any evidence that the telecom company thwarts local rivals could make the deal review tougher and invite costly conditions, telecom antitrust experts said — even though they still expect the acquisition to be approved.\n\n“Antitrust officials may have a hard time buying AT&T’s argument that it will expand broadband competition and not seek to harm competitors if they find the company is actively working to block new broadband players from entering the markets AT&T already dominates,” said Gene Kimmelman, the president of Public Knowledge, a consumer group, and a former senior antitrust official at the Justice Department, who opposes the merger.\n\nAT&T said it was not being hypocritical. It said its local activities were aimed at fighting misguided and potentially illegal regulations and that it was seeking to protect jobs and the quality of its service. Its rivals, including Google Fiber, have also lobbied to influence city and state leaders to break into new markets, AT&T said.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
