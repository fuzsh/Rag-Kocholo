        "text": "For someone with a reputation for being unsentimental about his company, it was perhaps surprising that Jeffrey L. Bewkes looked to the past when he spoke at a Time Warner management retreat in Miami in late November — his first since being tapped as the company’s next chief executive.\n\nBefore the top 200 executives at a ballroom in Miami’s Mandarin Oriental hotel, Mr. Bewkes invoked the legacies of Henry R. Luce and Ted Turner in ticking off the accomplishments of the assembly’s predecessors: inventing the newsmagazine (Time), and spearheading cable news (CNN) and pay television (HBO), according to three executives in attendance who spoke on condition of anonymity because it was a private meeting.\n\nBut Mr. Bewkes’s task is very different. Those pioneers built the modern Time Warner. Mr. Bewkes, who will take over from Richard D. Parsons on Jan. 2, may be the person who tears it apart. The question, therefore, is how Time Warner will look after a Bewkes administration and what he will do first.\n\nThere is no end to the theories of why Time Warner has stalled. The stock price has been moribund for years, following the disastrous merger with AOL in early 2001. On May 16, 2002, the day Mr. Parsons took over from former chief executive Gerald M. Levin, Time Warner stock closed at $18.35; lately, the stock has traded near $16. Wall Street analysts have complained about confusion during the executive transition, and there is a widespread view that there is no logical reason for the company’s disparate assets — CNN, HBO, publishing empire Time Inc., the Warner Brothers movie studio, Time Warner Cable and AOL — to be under the same umbrella. The various divisions mostly operate independently, and Mr. Bewkes has voiced skepticism of the idea of wringing much synergy between them.\n\n“If you have been an investor in Time Warner for a one-, two-, three-, five- or seven-year time frame, you have not made money,” said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Company. “Therefore you have to look at the construction of the company and ask, ‘Why is the company built like this?’ ”\n\nMr. Bewkes (pronounced BEW-kess) has outlined his so-called three pillars of growth for the company: increasing revenue from digitizing content; expanding internationally; and broadening the appeal of Time Warner content to attract a more diverse audience. All worthy ideas — but they don’t exactly tip his hand as to his overall corporate strategy.\n\nBut ask a sampling of Time Warner observers, everyone from investors to analysts to other media executives, what Mr. Bewkes’s strategy should be, and you will likely get as many different answers as there are people in your sample. Sell the slow-growth Time Inc.; spin-off the cable unit; beef up the cable networks by acquiring Discovery Communications or the Scripps Networks; merge AOL with Yahoo or MSN to better compete with Google. Or, something even more radical: merge with NBC Universal, an idea that has been publicly floated.\n\nFor the past year, Time Warner’s board of directors has received a briefing on possible strategic alternatives at each meeting, among them a radical break-up. In other words, Mr. Bewkes has heard it all, and there is nothing that he will do that has not already been considered by the board behind closed doors.\n\n“It’s been analyzed to death,” said a high-level Time Warner executive.\n\nMr. Bewkes, who earned his executive bona fides at the company with a successful run at the helm of HBO in the 1990s, is skiing this week and declined to comment. But during his speech in Miami, he made clear that in a year or two Time Warner may look like an entirely different company with a different mix of assets.\n\n“His message was that he would take a hard look at the structure of the company and see if it’s right for the individual companies to move forward together, with the upshot being some companies may work better apart,” is how one Time Warner executive in attendance paraphrased Mr. Bewkes’s remarks.\n\nWhile Mr. Bewkes will take Time Warner into the future, his pedigree links him to the company’s past. The company’s founding fathers Henry Luce and Britton Hadden germinated the idea for Time magazine before they graduated from Yale in 1920; Mr. Bewkes graduated from Yale in 1974. And like Mr. Luce and Mr. Hadden, who attended the Hotchkiss School together, Mr. Bewkes is also the product of an elite prep school, in his case, the Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts.\n\nLast week, the CNN anchor Soledad O’Brien interviewed Mr. Bewkes and Mr. Parsons on a closed-circuit broadcast for employees and posed this question to Mr. Parsons: “What is the biggest difference between you and Jeff?”\n\nMr. Parsons responded, “I’m a defensive guy. It’s hard to get the ball from me if I have it. But Jeff is an offensive guy and he’s going to find a way to take the company in new directions.”\n\nThe pair’s differences don’t end there. While the adjective most associated with Mr. Parsons is “diplomatic” — an attribute that helped him glide through the 2005 crisis when activist investor Carl C. Icahn bought up Time Warner stock and pushed for a break-up — Mr. Bewkes, while polished and charming, is not afraid of confrontation. He was famously dispatched by Mr. Parsons in 2002 to confront AOL’s founder Stephen M. Case in a meeting about the poor performance of the online unit.\n\n“As an operating executive, particularly at HBO, he had a great track record,” said Spencer Wang, an analyst at Bear Stearns. “In media circles, he’s very well regarded, very personable, and I think Wall Street shares that view.”\n\nInvestors have already jotted down three key dates for Time Warner in their BlackBerrys: Feb. 6, April 1 and July 1.\n\nOn Feb. 6, Mr. Bewkes will preside over his first quarterly earnings call as chief executive. Analysts and investors are expecting him to reveal some details of his vision for the company and a possible break-up.\n\nThe second date, April 1, is perhaps more important. This will mark the fifth anniversary of the restructuring of Time Warner Entertainment, a complicated partnership with Comcast whose unraveling resulted in Time Warner taking control of Time Warner Cable. After April 1, Time Warner can spin off more of Time Warner Cable — earlier this year it sold a 16 percent stake to investors — without incurring a large capital gains tax.\n\nWhether or not to completely separate cable from Time Warner’s content businesses is seen as Mr. Bewkes’s most important decision.\n\n“It’s my belief that Time Warner Cable will be spun off,” said Mr. Nathanson. “Because when I hear them speak about what cable needs from a financing standpoint, it seems they are saying it could be a standalone company.”\n\nSlicing cable, which accounted for 36 percent of Time Warner’s revenue last quarter, would leave a more pure-play content company that includes the Turner cable networks, Warner Brothers, publishing and AOL.\n\n“The first thing is you spin off cable entirely,” Mr. Nathanson said. “Then you ask, why is AOL part of this company? Then Jeff is left with a shrunken, but much more targeted cable network and studio business that looks a lot like Viacom. And then you go from there. Do you become an acquirer or a target?”\n\nIf cable were spun off, the speculation — which is not dismissed by insiders — is that Time Warner would seek to either acquire or enter a joint venture with NBC Universal. General Electric has publicly said it has no plans to sell NBC Universal, but speculation in media circles is that the company would consider it following the 2008 Beijing Olympics, which NBC will broadcast. One investment banker who recently discussed the issue with G.E. said he was told, “come speak to us after Beijing” (this banker declined to be identified because of the confidentiality of the message). When Robert Wright stepped down as chief executive of NBC Universal earlier this year, he predicted in Fortune magazine that a Time Warner spin-off of cable in 2008 would spur talks to merge Time Warner and NBC Universal.\n\nOther potential acquisition targets, if Mr. Bewkes wants to beef up his stable of cable networks, are Discovery and the Scripps network, which owns the Food Network and HGTV.\n\nThe final important date is July 1, when Google, which bought a 5 percent stake in America Online in 2005, can force Time Warner to either take AOL public or buy back Google’s stake at “fair market value.” That amount would be something less than Google paid for its stake; at the time, AOL was valued at $20 billion.\n\n“I think that will force the board to consider alternatives for AOL,” like striking partnerships with MSN or Yahoo, two potential deals the company has discussed in the past, said Mr. Wang.\n\nMr. Bewkes is already absorbing one important lesson from Mr. Parsons while riding shotgun during l’affaire Icahn: how to deal with angry investors.\n\n“I’ve recommended to them that they should have an analyst day as soon as possible,” said Larry Haverty, who runs the Gabelli Global Multimedia Trust fund and owns about 205,000 shares of Time Warner. Mr. Haverty complained about a lack of communication between Time Warner and the investment community lately. “We’ve been in this horrible hiatus period before Bewkes takes the reins,” he said.\n\nMr. Haverty admits he was recently invited to meet with Mr. Bewkes in New York, but declined because he had just arrived in Florida and did not want to deal with the hassles of New York’s John F. Kennedy International airport to get back in time. Time Warner insists that Mr. Bewkes has been making time for investors."
