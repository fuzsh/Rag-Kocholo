        "text": "Thank you so much for joining us in this interview series. Before we dive into our discussion about cultural sensitivity, our readers would love to “get to know you” a bit better. Can you share with us the backstory about what brought you to your specific career path?\n\nI’ve always been fascinated by human relationships and leadership. That’s why I love the work we do at Arbinger to help organizations create the leaders and work culture they’ve always wanted.\n\nPrior to joining the Arbinger team, I worked with Plum Healthcare as an administrator. Throughout my time there I had the opportunity to work with struggling leadership teams to help them turnaround newly acquired and failing operations. In those teams we applied Arbinger’s solutions intensively and, as a result, we consistently received the highest possible ratings from the California Department of Health.\n\nIn 2010 I became a Managing Partner at the Arbinger Institute and since then I’ve been heavily involved in developing our solutions and helping clients strategically implement those solutions. I’ve also had the opportunity to co-author our bestselling books and travel around the country to speak at industry events about how to transform work culture and accelerate results.\n\nCan you share the most interesting story that happened to you since you started your career?\n\nI was asked to help resolve a conflict between a government agency, their contractor, and the major subcontractor on a massive, multi-year project. The groups had come to hate each other, threatening lawsuits and seeking to terminate the contracts. The project involved the longest supply chain in the world and hundreds of millions of dollars. By the middle of the second day, I wondered if resolution was possible. The head of the construction subcontractor, the agency director, and the lead contractor seemed to live in three different realities. And then, something miraculous happened. The former air force colonel who led the construction company became really quiet and said to the director of the agency, “I need to stop this meeting. I’ve been thinking about you all day. And I think that this is what you are trying to accomplish.” He then outlined all her objectives and asked, “Is that right?” Shocked, the agency director said, “Yes! Exactly.” He then said, “Well, I’ve been making all of that harder and I want to own that. I want to change and finish my career helping you accomplish all of these objectives.” That set off a domino effect around the room and each person, unsolicited, took complete ownership for the ways they were making life harder for the others. By the end of the day they had a plan to get the entire project back on track. It was stunning to see what real curiosity and sensitivity can do to dissolve even the most entrenched conflicts.\n\nWhich character traits do you think are most instrumental to a leader’s success?\n\nIn my experience, successful leaders have three important traits.\n\nAn outward mindset — By that, I mean that they understand and care deeply about how their actions impact everyone around them. Leaders need to genuinely care about their team and the success of those they lead.\n\nDeep accountability — Too often leaders don’t recognize the impact that they have on their organization’s culture. Great leaders know that culture starts with them. And they model what real accountability looks like–they hold themselves accountable for achieving results and for achieving them in a way that helps everyone succeed. They don’t hold others accountable so much as develop deeply accountable people.\n\nA true connection with their employees — Leaders that have an outward mindset see their employees as people. And because they care deeply for those they lead, they don’t shy away from having real conversations–from saying what needs to be said clearly in order to help others grow and succeed. This level of raw honesty that is born out of real care creates a connection that is powerful. It is at the heart of real leadership.\n\nOk, thank you for that. Let’s now jump to the primary focus of our interview. How do you define cultural sensitivity in the context of your business, and why is it important for your company’s success?\n\nCultural sensitivity is 1. the awareness that cultural norms that I take as a given given my background cannot be assumed for anyone else, 2. A genuine curiosity to understand how I interpret the world and my expectations given my background and upbringing, and 3. A willingness to adjust what I do to be most helpful given that context. Fostering this awareness, curiosity, and eagerness to adapt is at the heart of our work to help organization’s transform their culture by inviting each contributor to see everyone around them as a person.\n\nCan you share an experience where cultural sensitivity significantly impacted a business decision or client relationship?\n\nArbinger holds frequent public workshops to enable potential client representatives to experience our training firsthand. Learning that an individual who had severely limited eyesight would be attending one of these workshops, our design team went to work to resize our workbook to three times its original size, finding a speciality large-format printer and binder to create a very unique workbook for his use. This gentleman was so moved by this gesture that this experience became an important part of the narrative as to why his government organization should work with Arbinger to help them transform their culture. For over 10 years the contract this client signed represented the largest cultural transformation initiative in Arbinger’s 45 year history.\n\nWhat strategies do you employ to foster a culturally sensitive environment within your team or organization?\n\nAt Arbinger, one of our main goals is to create a psychologically safe work environment. We encourage an environment where every voice is heard and valued. People are free to “think out loud”, share ideas, ask bold questions, provide feedback and openly challenge the status quo without fear of being judged, marginalized, or punished. When people are comfortable enough to share their unique perspectives we know we have created a culturally sensitive environment.\n\nHow do you handle situations where cultural misunderstandings or conflicts arise in the workplace?\n\nMany workplaces view conflict as a behavioral problem they need to “fix”. Let’s say two people have a misunderstanding and they’re brought in to discuss what that misunderstanding is and how they both can change their behavior to avoid it happening again. That does not address the systemic problem. Resolving conflict needs to occur on a deeper level. What needs to be addressed is the fundamental mindset that is driving the conflict. Real resolution requires helping each party in the conflict fully understand how their actions impact everyone around them. Only then can those who were involved in the conflict find a solution.\n\nBased on your experience and research, can you please share “5 Reasons Why Cultural Sensitivity is So Important in Business?”\n\n1. Talent acquisition and retention begins and ends with the result of cultural sensitivity: belonging.\n\nWhether a workforce is co-located, hybrid, or fully remote, an organization’s ability to attract and retain the very best talent depends on the degree to which employees feel they belong within the organization. And the degree of belonging one feels is directly correlated with the degree they feel seen and their cultural needs are acknowledged by their coworkers.\n\nAn Arbinger employee recently approached a member of the executive team to share that they had received multiple offers by competitors but that they had turned them down. Why? Because they felt seen and valued at Arbinger for who they are to a degree they haven’t experienced elsewhere. Significantly more compensation was far less important to this employee than this sense of belonging fostered through cultural sensitivity.\n\n2. Cultural Sensitivity Fosters Employee Engagement.\n\nIt turns out that employees’ energies can be spent on the business\n\nor navigating cultural challenges, not both. The Qualtrics Annual Employee Experience Trends Report identified a sense of belonging as the strongest driver of employee engagement. When an employee feels that there are elements of their identity that others are not sensitive to or that are stereotyped, they will end up spending valuable time and energy to ensure these aspects of their identity do not negatively impact how others perceive and value them.\n\nAn employee of one of our clients noted that she spent an hour each morning straightening her hair before work because, as a black woman, her comments in meetings seemed better received when her hair was straightened than when she wore her hair in its natural state. This discovery also led her to become more cautious regarding the ideas she shared in meetings. Imagine the difference in what this employee would provide to the organization and the loyalty she would feel toward the organization had cultural sensitivity fostered real belonging.\n\n3. Cultural sensitivity drives psychological safety–the key to innovation.\n\nWithout a culture where sharing one’s ideas is welcomed and failure is seen as a critical part of innovation, organizations will remain stagnant, inviting the full participation of those who feel safe because they are part of the majority. Because cultural sensitivity creates space for a diversity of experiences and ideas and fosters abd environment where failure is not stigmatized, companies that seek to drive innovation have to ensure cultural sensitivity across the board.\n\n4. A lack of cultural sensitivity results in communication breakdowns and conflict.\n\nWithout cultural sensitivity, communication can be easily misconstrued and behaviors that seem straightforward are easily interpreted by others who do not share the same cultural background or context. For this reason, conflicts are almost unavoidable in environments that lack cultural sensitivity. What’s more, resolving conflicts becomes almost impossible without an awareness and curiosity to understand one’s impact on another given the meaning of behaviors within their cultural framework. These conflicts cripple an organization’s effectiveness.\n\nJust last year I was asked to address the industry-wide conflict that plagues the mining industry. The conflict between first nations’ indigenous peoples and mining companies came to a head with the destruction of ancient aboriginal sites in Australia. In a room with over three thousand mining executives and first nations’ leaders, I watched as the executives were able to honestly admit the cultural insensitivities that had turned what could be mutually beneficial relationships into industry-disrupting levels of mistrust. By becoming intensely curious, these industry leaders discovered in the space of less than an hour the myriad insensitivities that they would have to own and apologize for in order to reestablish that trust.\n\n5. Cultural sensitivity creates brand connection and customer loyalty.\n\nCultural sensitivity drives product innovation as companies work to ensure that solutions translate across cultures. What’s more, heightened awareness to cultural differences ensures that employees deliver services in a culturally sensitive way. These tangible evidences of cultural nuance can dramatically increases then loyalty of customers who feel seen and valued. When customers feel seen and valued in this way they develop a strong emotional connection to a company’s brand.\n\nWhen preparing to deliver our video based workshops in Great Britain, we put together a focus group to see how audiences would respond. The raw authenticity that is key to the success of our programs in the states was off-putting to the majority of our focus group participants in the UK. Using their feedback, we were able to quickly adjust to create a product that not only feels more culturally compatible but resonates deeply. These changes have created massive brand loyalty among our clients in Great Britain who feel seen and heard and valued through the process.\n\nIn what ways has focusing on cultural sensitivity given your business a competitive edge or opened up new markets?\n\nAs a result of a number of factors, 2020 marked a major shift in the focus of many organizations to identify gaps in their efforts to ensure diversity and foster real inclusion. Within a year of that shift, organizations were calling. They had tried behavioral approaches but nothing had changed. In fact, for many organizations, the solutions they implemented actually made things worse. As a result of their experiences, organizations had discovered the importance of shifting mindset to create real and lasting behavior change. They knew that real solutions to DEI-related challenges require a fundamental shift in mindset. Applying a mindset-change approach to what so often comes down to a lack of cultural sensitivity has enabled us to provide a global and differentiated solution to a market desperately in need of more effective approaches.\n\nYou are a person of great influence. If you could start a movement that would bring the most amount of good to the most amount of people, what would that be? You never know what your idea can trigger. :-)\n\nActually, the movement I believe will bring the most amount of good to the most amount people is the movement we are sparking in our work at Arbinger. Our vision is “to lead a worldwide movement to humanize the workplace by sustainably transforming the culture of organizations and the lives of those who work there.” ​This is the work that I’ve decided to devote the rest of my life to because when people learn to see others as people in the workplace, they transport that experience into every relationship and environment–in their communities, with their neighbors, and with their families."
