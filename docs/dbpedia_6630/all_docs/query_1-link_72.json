        "text": "Shortly after Comcast announced its proposed purchase of Time Warner Cable, Netflix and Comcast made another announcement: Netflix agreed to pay Comcast Corp. an undisclosed fee to ensure Netflix content streams smoothly to Comcast customers.\n\nNetflix, which reportedly accounts for nearly 30% of all Internet traffic during peak traffic, is basically paying millions for faster and steadier access to Comcast’s subscribers. But if this is a pay to play arrangement, will all content companies be expected to follow suit?\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\n'Cabinet of Curiosities': Ranking Every Episode of Guillermo Del Toro's Netflix Series\n\nRyan Murphy Says 'Dahmer' Production Reached Out to Victims' Families: No One Responded\n\nEven Netflix CEO Reed Hastings is concerned about the precedent the deal is setting. On a company blog post, Hastings wrote: “Some big ISPs are extracting a toll because they can — they effectively\n\ncontrol access to millions of consumers and are willing to sacrifice\n\nthe interests of their own customers to press Netflix and others to pay.\n\nThough they have the scale and power to do this, they should realize it\n\nis in their long term interest to back strong net neutrality. While in\n\nthe short term Netflix will in cases reluctantly pay large ISPs to\n\nensure a high quality member experience, we will continue to fight for\n\nthe Internet the world needs and deserves.”\n\nOne vocal critic of the proposed merger, Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) has warned Justice Department officials that the deal “could compromise the open nature of the Internet.”\n\n“Simply put, the Internet belongs to the people, not to huge\n\ncorporations,” Franken wrote in a letter to Renata Hesse and David Gelfand, the two deputy assistant attorneys general in the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department who are studying the proposed merger. “Comcast’s proposed acquisition of Time\n\nWarner Cable could disrupt this balance of power, resulting in higher\n\ncosts and fewer choices for consumers.”\n\nFranken’s main concern is that the deal could be detrimental to consumers, who might have to pay more for broadband, and small businesses, who presumably wouldn’t have the money to shell out money for faster internet service. With the planned acquisition of Time Warner Cable, Comcast will become the cable provider to nearly one-third of American homes and the high-speed Internet company for almost 40% of American homes, according to The New York Times.\n\n“I am very concerned that Comcast could use its clout in the\n\nbroadband market to dictate the content consumers receive and the prices\n\nthey pay, and these concerns are only intensified by Comcast’s proposal\n\nto acquire Time Warner Cable,” said Franken.\n\nResponding to Franken’s letter, Comcast issued a statement saying that the deal “will bring millions more Americans under the Open\n\nInternet rules as soon as our deal closes. We fully expect that the FCC\n\nwill have in place Open Internet rules that will apply to all companies\n\nby the time our current condition from the NBCUniversal deal expires in\n\n2018. That condition was always meant as a bridge to enforceable rules\n\nthat would be applicable to all companies in the industry. Comcast has\n\nsupported Open Internet rules since they were first proposed and is the\n\nonly company that is currently required to abide by them.”\n\nAs part of its acquisition of NBCUniversal in 2011, Comcast agreed to abide by the FCC’s net neutrality guidelines until 2018. Franklin said that there is a “question” about what will happen after 2018.
