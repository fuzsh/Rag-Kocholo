        "text": "Starting Monday March 30, People.com will only be available online to people who are subscribers to either the print magazine or to the America Online internet access service.\n\nConsumers buying the magazine from newsstands will also find a website access code on the People.com page of the printed version. AOL will apply the same conditions to the Entertainment Weekly site.\n\nReports say that other popular magazines from the Time Inc stable, including In Style and Real Simple, will go subscriber-only from May. Currently, there appear to be no plans to include similar plans for its news weekly Time magazine and Sports Illustrated.\n\nAOL Time Warner is desperately trying to turn around the fortunes of America Online, as the service loses subscribers to rival dial-up and broadband services. The company has talked about the benefits of closer ties between its new and traditional media properties since it merged in 2000, but there have only been sporadic examples of this.\n\nThe latest move is seen as adding value to the America Online offering. However, there is still much debate about the future of the service because some shareholders in the company are known to be keen to sell off the loss-making internet service.\n\nEarlier this week, America Online launched AOL Voicemail, a premium service allowing AOL members to listen to their home voice messages online and their AOL emails over the telephone, so that all their messages can be accessed from any phone or computer."
