        "text": "WarnerMedia has been owned by telco giant AT&T for less than four years and it will soon have a new parent company — likely by the end of next month.\n\nDiscovery‘s shareholder vote on the acquisition of WarnerMedia is set for today during a special meeting of stockholders at 10 a.m. ET. The deal is expected to get an easy thumbs-up given the approval already bestowed by Discovery’s oldest and most influential holders, investor John Malone and Advance/Newhouse Co. Both agreed to convert long-held preferred shares into common shares in order to smooth the path for the spinoff combination.\n\nAs Discovery conducts a mostly ceremonial poll of shareholders, AT&T is signaling the start of a new chapter. The telco giant will conduct a virtual investor conference at the exact same time as the vote to unveil its post-spinoff strategy. The push into entertainment was initiated by the previous regime led by former AT&T chairman-CEO Randall Stephenson. His successor, John Stankey, has been cleaning up the debt and destruction ever since.\n\nStankey has hedged his bets in unloading WarnerMedia with a deal that hands control to the Discovery camp but leaves his shareholders with 71% of the enlarged company.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nNonetheless, AT&T’s short but eventful stewardship of Warner Bros., HBO, CNN and the Turner networks is nigh. Here’s a look back at key moments during AT&T’s bumpy ride in Hollywood.\n\n2016\n\nOct. 20 — The first report surfaces, in the Wall Street Journal, that AT&T is in advanced talks to acquire Time Warner.\n\nOct. 22 — AT&T unveils an agreement to acquire Time Warner for $85.4 billion.\n\nNov. 9 — Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who repeatedly criticized CNN and vowed to block AT&T’s acquisition, is elected president of the United States.\n\n2017\n\nFeb. 15 — Time Warner shareholders approve the merger with AT&T.\n\nFeb. 28 — FCC chairman Ajit Pai refuses to review the AT&T-Time Warner merger, passing the decision to the Department of Justice.\n\nNov. 8 — AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson and Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, meet to discuss recommendations for AT&T to divest DirecTV or Turner Broadcasting to assuage antitrust concerns.\n\nNov. 20 — The Justice Department files a lawsuit to block the AT&T-Time Warner acquisition. The feds say the deal would “greatly harm American consumers.” AT&T blasts the Trump administration for its “radical and inexplicable departure from decades of antitrust precedent.”\n\nDec. 22 — Shareholders vote to extend the merger agreement deadline to June 21, 2018.\n\n2018\n\nMarch 19 — The antitrust trial begins before U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon in Washington, D.C.\n\nApril 18 — Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes testifies, disputing the business case for the government’s thesis that the enlarged company would withhold its content from rival distributors. “We want to be on all platforms. We want to be in every bundle, everywhere,” he tells Judge Leon.\n\nApril 19 — AT&T’s Stephenson testifies, explaining AT&T’s sense of urgency to acquire a significant content studio. “If you miss one technology cycle, it may not kill you, but it will make you sick for a very long time,” he tells Judge Leon.\n\nMay 23 — AT&T’s Stephenson causes a stir within Time Warner by saying at an investor conference that episodes of HBO’s “Game of Thrones” may be better in a mobile experience if they were hacked down to 20 minutes apiece.\n\nJune 12 — Judge Leon rules in favor of AT&T, going so far as to assert in the opinion that an appeal by the government would lead to “certain irreparable harm to the defendants.”\n\nJune 14 — AT&T announces the close of its transaction to acquire Time Warner. Jeff Bewkes is succeeded by John Stankey as CEO of Time Warner.\n\nJune 15 — AT&T rebrands Time Warner as WarnerMedia.\n\nJuly 12 — The Justice Department files an appeal in the AT&T antitrust case.\n\nSept. 25 — AT&T launches advertising and analytics arm Xandr.\n\nOct. 10 — WarnerMedia reveals plans to launch a streaming service in 2019.\n\nDec. 14 — The early stirrings of HBO Max take shape when TNT and TBS president Kevin Reilly is promoted to chief content officer of digital and subscription for WarnerMedia.\n\n2019\n\nFeb. 26 — The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. unanimously upholds the ruling in favor of the AT&T-Time Warner deal.\n\nFeb. 28 — Longtime Turner senior executive David Levy and longtime HBO leader Richard Plepler abruptly exit the company amid rumors of a massive AT&T-drive restructuring ahead.\n\nMarch 4 — AT&T reveals a major reorganization: Bob Greenblatt joins as chairman of WarnerMedia Entertainment and direct-to-consumer.
