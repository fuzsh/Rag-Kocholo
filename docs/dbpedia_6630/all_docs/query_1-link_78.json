        "text": "The new partnership will begin a national technical trial of its On Demand Online service, carrying programming from Time Warner's Turner networks TNT and TBS, to about 5,000 Comcast subscribers.\n\nTime Warner and Comcast have endorsed a framework called TV Everywhere, designed to bring \"significantly more television content to customers online in a manner that is consumer-friendly, pro-competitive and non-exclusive\".\n\nTo help rapid adoption and deployment of online television content across the industry, a set of principles for the TV Everywhere model was designed to be simple and attractive for any programmer and any video distributor to elect to adopt.\n\nJeff Bewkes, chairman and chief executive of Time Warner, said the move meant TV Everywhere was no longer just a concept, but a working model to deliver greater television content to consumers over broadband.\n\nHe added: \"We consistently look to make our popular, branded content more accessible to consumers in order to grow our business.\n\n\"This progressive approach to delivering television content online will enable the continued vibrancy and growth of distribution outlets, their content partners and advertising clients.\"\n\nThe agreement for the national On Demand Online trial will deliver more TNT and TBS programming online, and will be free of charge to Comcast video customers.\n\nCustomers in the trial will be able to access TNT's award-winning programming, including The Closer and Saving Grace, as well as the TBS line-up, which includes Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns and My Boys.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Comcast expects other programming networks to participate as the nationwide trial expands, while Time Warner is looking to broker similar trials with other distributors."
