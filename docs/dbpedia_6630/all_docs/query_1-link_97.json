        "text": "Fanta and Warner Bros Studios have teamed up to create an out-of-home global campaign to promote the release of the Beetlejuice sequel, Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.\n\n“Haunt your tastebuds” will go live in about 50 countries, including the UK and the US, and showcase the limited-edition Beetlejuice flavour Fanta that has been produced to highlight the film’s release.\n\nThe ads have been created by Ogilvy and WPP Open X with support from Burson, and focus on limited-edition cans of the Coca-Cola-owned soft drink. The work features colours that link to Beetlejuice's spooky theming, such as green and black, floating in front of a backdrop.\n\nThe design includes a Beetlejuice-flavoured Fanta can that carries an image of the eponymous protagonist on a black and white striped backdrop, as well as an orange flavour can featuring the character Astrid.\n\nThe products feature a QR code that can be scanned for access to physical and digital experiences for customers, including the chance to win tickets to watchBeetlejuice Beetlejuice in a cinema.\n\nThis is accompanied by a 60-second film, “Rider rules”, which shows Beetlejuice reciting \"Wanta Fanta\" three times at a vending machine on an abandoned platform, which summons the \"Fanta afterlife train\". Once aboard, he realises he is amongst a train of recently deceased people.\n\nThe ad will be shown in cinemas across the UK between 10 September and 31 October.\n\nThere will be cut-down versions of the spot for social media too.\n\nThe spot comes alongside in-store activity at supermarkets and convenience stores, which includes several touchpoints that will give shoppers the chance to win cinema tickets or Beetlejuice Beetlejuicethemed cups.\n\nThe campaign is part of Fanta’s brand platform, “Summon what you wanta”, which is designed to offer new ways to celebrate Halloween.\n\nEssenceMediacom, Goat, Hogarth, Subvrsive and VML have handled media for the campaign.\n\nIbrahim Salim Khan, vice-president, global category strategy, Fanta at The Coca-Cola Company, said that there is “more to come” through the partnership, including Beetlejuice-themed virtual and in-person experiences in September and October. Details of the events have yet to be confirmed.\n\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice will be released on 4 September 2024.\n\nDana Nussbaum, executive vice-president, worldwide marketing at Warner Bros. Pictures, added: “We are proud to partner with Fanta on this character’s long-awaited return to the big screen. Fanta is a brilliant collaborator and has delivered a truly inventive spin on their product with a limited-edition line-up.”"
