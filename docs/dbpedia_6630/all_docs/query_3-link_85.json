        "text": "Univision, the Spanish-language cable channel, disappeared from cable TV systems operated by Charter Communications late Tuesday, after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on retransmission fees.\n\nCharter owns, among other systems, the dominant cable TV system in Milwaukee, under the name Spectrum â€” the system formerly known as Time Warner Cable.\n\nAccording to Deadline Hollywood Daily, Univision's parent company, Univision Communications, told viewers last week that an impasse was likely effective Feb. 1. Also pulled from Charter-owned systems were the signals for local stations owned and operated by Univision."
