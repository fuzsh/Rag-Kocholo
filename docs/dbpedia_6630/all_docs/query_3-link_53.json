        "text": "AT&T didn't wait to announce major changes at the newly acquired Time Warner. Among them: John Martin, the CEO of Turner Broadcasting, is leaving the company.\n\nAT&T announced the leadership change in a memo to employees Friday. In the email, John Stankey — the newly minted CEO of AT&T's media business — said Martin \"will no longer be with the company as a result of the merger.\"\n\nMartin had been chief executive of Turner since 2014. Turner is made up of numerous well-recognized networks, such as CNN, TNT, TBS and Cartoon Network. It brought in nearly 40 percent of Time Warner's revenue in 2017, more than any other part of the company.\n\nStankey will now oversee Martin's direct reports. In the email, he wrote that the new organizational structure would allow him \"to work more closely with more Turner leaders\" and get to know the business. He also announced the new name of Time Warner: WarnerMedia.\n\nMartin's exit and the company name change are the beginning of many anticipated shake-ups as AT&T integrates the media company with its telecom business. It told shareholders that the merger would lead to $2.5 billion in synergies annually by the end of the merger's third year — $1.5 billion of that in cost savings and $1 billion from a boost in revenue.\n\nJeff Bewkes, outgoing CEO of Time Warner, is also leaving the company but will serve as a senior adviser to AT&T during the transition.\n\nStankey told employees in the email that the daily operations of HBO, Turner and Warner Bros. would see little change but that \"many of the redundant corporate support functions\" would be cut in coming months. He said AT&T must move quickly to stay relevant.\n\n\"AT&T and Time Warner are incredibly storied and capable companies,\" he said. \"However, both companies face an industry structure and competitive landscape that clearly places a premium on innovation and speed like no other time in our respective histories. Our past success does not guarantee future prosperity.\"\n\nDallas-based AT&T completed its acquisition of Time Warner on Thursday after its months-long court battle with the Justice Department came to an end. A federal judge rejected the government's argument that the combined companies would have too much leverage and would raise prices for competitors and consumers.\n\nThe deal combines the wide reach of AT&T's pay-TV, mobile and broadband businesses with Time Warner's treasure trove of TV and movie content. The merger is valued at $108.7 billion including debt.\n\nAn AT&T spokeswoman shared Stankey's email but declined to comment further on Martin's departure.\n\nMartin was among the executives who testified during the antitrust trial in Washington.\n\nUnder his leadership, Turner rolled out new subscription-based streaming services: FilmStruck, which showcases Turner Classic Movies; Boomerang, for cartoons; and Bleacher Report Live, with sports content.\n\nBut Turner's primary focus is producing popular original shows and offering unique content, such as live sports events that command a large audience. It has broadcasting rights to air Major League Baseball games and NBA playoffs, and it shares rights to the NCAA's March Madness tournament. More than half of its revenue comes from affiliate fees from cable and satellite TV companies that carry its networks.\n\nTurner's Martin had not been shy when speaking about AT&T's video products and the Justice Department's effort to block the merger. At a tech conference in February, he dismissed AT&T's streaming service, DirecTV Now, saying it didn't make money. And he said that as a DirecTV customer, he had been disappointed by its service.\n\n\"I have DirecTV,\" Martin said at the conference. \"I live in Beverly Hills. It's not that good.\"\n\nHe slammed the Justice Department's challenge of the AT&T-Time Warner deal, calling the government \"clueless.\"\n\n\"As a person who's actually going through the process and has been in depositions, the theory of the case just makes absolutely no sense,\" Martin said."
