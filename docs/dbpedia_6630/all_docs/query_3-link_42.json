        "text": "What Is an Acquisition?\n\nAn acquisition is a transaction in which one company purchases most or all of another company’s shares to gain control of that company.\n\nAcquisitions are common in business and may occur with or without the target company’s approval. There’s often a no-shop clause during the process of approval.\n\nMost people commonly hear about the acquisitions of large well-known companies, but mergers and acquisitions (M&A) occur more regularly between small- to medium-sized firms than between large companies.\n\nUnderstanding Acquisitions\n\nAn acquisition is a financial transaction that occurs when one business acquires the majority or all of its target’s shares. The goal of an acquisition is to gain control of the target’s operations, including its assets, production facilities, resources, market share, customer base, and other elements.\n\nCompanies acquire other businesses for various reasons. They might seek economies of scale, diversification, greater market share, increased synergy, cost reductions, or new niche offerings. They might simply want to cut out the competition.\n\nAcquisitions are usually friendly endeavors. They occur when the target firm agrees to be acquired. Its board of directors approves of the deal. Friendly acquisitions often work toward the mutual benefit of both the acquiring and target companies.\n\nBoth companies develop strategies to ensure that the acquiring company purchases the appropriate assets, and they review the financial statements and other valuations for any obligations that may come with the assets. The purchase proceeds when both parties agree to the terms and meet any legal stipulations.\n\nSpecial Considerations\n\nA company must evaluate whether its target company is a good candidate. Acquirers may have to consider some key steps before pondering whether they should go through with a deal:\n\nIs the price right? The metrics that investors use to value an acquisition candidate vary by industry. Acquisitions can fail because the asking price for the target company exceeds these metrics.\n\nExamine the debt load. A target company with an unusually high level of liabilities should be viewed as a warning of potential problems ahead. The target company might require the directors of the buying company to sign a whitewash resolution confirming the firm’s solvency.\n\nUndue litigation. Lawsuits are common in business, but a good acquisition candidate isn’t dealing with a level of litigation that exceeds what’s reasonable and normal for its size and industry.\n\nScrutinize the financials. A good acquisition target will have clear, well-organized financial statements. This allows the acquirer to smoothly exercise due diligence. Complete and transparent financials also help to prevent unwanted surprises after the acquisition is complete.\n\nReasons for Acquisitions\n\nEntering a New or Foreign Market\n\nBuying an existing company in another country could be the easiest way to enter a foreign market if a company wants to expand its operations to that country or a totally new market.\n\nThe purchased business will already have its own personnel, a brand name, and other intangible assets. This could help to ensure that the acquiring company will start off in a new market with a solid base.\n\nGrowth Strategy\n\nPerhaps a company met with physical or logistical constraints or depleted its resources. It’s often sounder to acquire another firm than to expand its own when a company is encumbered in this way.\n\nSuch a company might look for promising young companies to acquire and incorporate into its revenue stream as a new way to profit.\n\nReducing Excess Capacity and Decreasing Competition\n\nCompanies may start making acquisitions to reduce excess capacity, eliminate the competition, and focus on the most productive providers when there’s too much competition or supply.\n\nFederal watchdogs often keep an eye on deals that may affect the market. Acquisitions between two similar companies may harm consumers, including higher prices and lower-quality goods and services.\n\nGaining New Technology\n\nSometimes it can be more cost-efficient for a company to purchase another company that has already implemented a new technology successfully than to spend the time and money to develop the new technology itself.\n\nAcquisition vs. Takeover vs. Merger\n\nAcquisition and takeover mean almost the same thing, but they have different nuances on Wall Street.\n\nAn acquisition generally describes a primarily amicable transaction in which both firms cooperate. A takeover suggests that the target company resists or strongly opposes the purchase. The term “merger” is used when the purchasing and target companies mutually combine to form a completely new entity.\n\nBut the exact use of these terms tends to overlap in practice because each acquisition, takeover, and merger is a unique case with its own peculiarities and reasons for undertaking the transaction.\n\nTakeover\n\nUnfriendly acquisitions are commonly known as hostile takeovers. They occur when the target company doesn’t consent to the acquisition.\n\nHostile acquisitions don’t have the same agreement from the target firm, so the acquiring firm must actively purchase large stakes of the target company to gain a controlling interest. This forces the acquisition.\n\nIt implies that the firms aren’t equal in one or more significant ways even if a takeover isn’t exactly hostile.\n\nMerger\n\nA merger is the mutual fusion of two companies into one new legal entity, so it’s a more-than-friendly acquisition. This deal generally occurs between roughly equal companies in terms of their basic characteristics, including their size, customer base, and scale of operations.\n\nThe merging companies strongly believe that their combined entity would be more valuable to all parties, especially shareholders, than either one could be alone.\n\nExample of Acquisitions\n\nAOL was the most publicized online service of its time, extolled as “the company that brought the internet to America.” Founded in 1985, it grew to become the United States’ largest internet provider by 2000. Meanwhile, the legendary media conglomerate Time Warner was being labeled an old media company, given its range of tangible businesses like publishing and television and an enviable income statement.\n\nAOL Buys Time Warner\n\nThe young upstart AOL purchased the venerable giant Time Warner for $165 billion in 2000 in a masterful display of overweening confidence. The deal dwarfed all records and became the biggest merger in history.\n\nThe vision was that the new entity, AOL Time Warner, would become a dominant force in the news, publishing, music, entertainment, cable, and internet industries. AOL became the largest technology company in America after the merger.\n\nBut the joint phase lasted less than a decade. The expected successes of the merger failed to materialize as AOL lost value and the dotcom bubble burst. AOL and Time Warner dissolved their union.\n\nAOL Time Warner dissolved in a spinoff deal in 2009.\n\nTime Warner remained an entirely independent company from 2009 to 2016.\n\nVerizon acquired AOL for $4.4 billion in 2015.\n\nAT&T’s Deal to Buy Time Warner\n\nAT&T and Time Warner announced that AT&T would buy Time Warner for $85.4 billion in October 2016, morphing AT&T into a media heavy-hitter. AT&T completed the acquisition in June 2018 after a protracted court battle.\n\nThe AT&T-Time Warner acquisition deal of 2018 was as historically significant as the AOL-Time Warner deal of 2000. The U.S. Department of Justice sought to end the deal, saying the acquisition would hurt competition, leading consumers to face higher fees and bills.\n\nThe government lost its appeal in court and dropped the lawsuit. AT&T decided to spin off its media assets, including Time Warner, despite this.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nFinancial transactions can range from simple buy-and-sell deals to acquisitions that take place when one company acquires most or all of another entity’s shares to take over the target’s operations. Other reasons for acquisitions can include entering a new market, gaining market share, or even cutting out the competition. Large-scale acquisitions make big news, but these deals are fairly common in the small-sized to midsized business market."
