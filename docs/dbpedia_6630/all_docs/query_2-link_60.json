        "text": "In Master Switch, (a book that I have been reading for over 2 months because of the many detailed interesting case studies and depth in the info covered) Tim Wu discusses the events that led to the merger between media company Time Warner and ISP, America Online (AOL). The merger goes down as one of the most unsuccessful ones in the history of M&As. Very interesting case, this one!\n\nAbout AOL-\n\nAOL evolved into America’s largest internet services provider in the 1990s. They were the first to provide dial-up services and quickly gathered up a huge customer base (30 million by late 1990s). Their expansive lines made it easy for them to target customers across the country. However, they were not very well prepared for the turn from dial-up to broadband and lost a chunk of their customers because of their inability to transition to broadband when the time was right.\n\nAbout Time Warner-\n\nTime Warner owned a good number of content platforms like the Time magazine, CNN etc. They were the biggest media conglomerate in the world then (2000) and are still the leaders in the game.\n\nRationale behind the merger-\n\nAOL was losing its dial up customers to the broadband services provided by cable companies. It was looking for a way to retain its customers. Time Warner was looking at increasing its customer base and had great content to offer. It was keen on being a part of the internet revolution, something that AOL theoretically had some knowledge about.\n\nTime Warner had the content. AOL had the strong distribution network and customers. Merging would help realize value across the value chain.\n\nWhat went wrong-\n\nA few things.\n\nEven after the merger, the organizations operated as individually as they could. The synergies realized were very minimal and the culture clashes were too many. There was more thought given to the financials and less to the execution.\n\nAnother thing that showed the merger a dead end was the ‘always-hot’ Net neutrality. Time Warner was hoping that the merger would lead to AOL controlling what customers clicked on, on the internet. It meant subduing websites like Google and Yahoo and competing against organic growth of websites. Time was hoping that the 30 million customers only pressed on Time’s content. But little did Time Warner know that the internet does not work that way.\n\nAOL’s inability to shift to broadband from its novel dial-up led to plummeting customers. So the 30 million when Time got in was reduced to 50% in less than 2 years.\n\nWhere are they now?\n\nThe merger happened in 2000 and Time Warner spun off AOL in 2009 which was later picked up by Verizon in 2015 for a meager $4 billion. Time Warner was recently acquired by the telecommunications behemoth, AT&T for $85 billion — Link"
