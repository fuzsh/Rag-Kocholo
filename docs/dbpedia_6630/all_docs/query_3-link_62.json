Edward Kozelek, Vice President of Government Affairs at TWC, is the ALEC state chair of Ohio.[3] TWC was also a \"Director\" level sponsor of the 2011 ALEC Annual Meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana, which in 2010 equated to $10,000,[4] and a sponsor of the ALEC Kids Congress at the same meeting.[5]\n\nAbout ALEC\n\nALEC is a corporate bill mill. It is not just a lobby or a front group; it is much more powerful than that. Through ALEC, corporations hand state legislators their wishlists to benefit their bottom line. Corporations fund almost all of ALEC's operations. They pay for a seat on ALEC task forces where corporate lobbyists and special interest reps vote with elected officials to approve “model” bills.
