        "text": "Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes reportedly told investors on Monday that he would entertain a sale of the media company, and Apple is a possible suitor, according to the New York Post. AT&T, which owns DirecTV, and Fox are also said to have shown interest.\n\nEddy Cue, one of Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook's top lieutenants, in charge of content deals, has been keeping tabs on proceedings at Time Warner, a source close to Apple said.\n\nTime Warner owns a large number of assets that could lay the foundation for Apple's much-rumored streaming TV service, including CNN, HBO, TBS, TNT, NBA TV, Cartoon Network and its Warner Bros. division. A deal could allow Apple to offer a skinny bundle of channels airing popular TV shows for all ages like Adventure Time, Game of Thrones, Sesame Street, Silicon Valley and Veep.\n\nApple's streaming TV service has reportedly been placed on hold due to its difficulties in securing deals with content owners, but striking a deal with Time Warner would allow the company to reconsider offering a skinny bundle of channels through a Netflix-like service for Apple TV, Mac, iPad, iPhone and other devices.\n\nApple has previously been in talks with CBS, ABC, Fox, Disney, Viacom, Discovery and others about launching a web-based streaming service that would bundle approximately 25 channels for $30 to $40 per month, but content owners have been reluctant to give up control of the living room up to this point.\n\nFor now, fourth-generation Apple TV owners can stream select on-demand content from tvOS apps like ABC News, CNNgo, Fox NOW, HBO NOW, MLB.TV Premium, NBC Sports Live Extra, PBS, PBS Kids, USA NOW, Watch ABC and WatchESPN, but most require authenticating with a cable or satellite TV subscription.\n\nArticle Link: Apple Shows Interest in Buying Time Warner Assets for Streaming TV Service\n\nThis is great news, but I still think $30/$40 is too much for a service like this, especially since Netflix is only $9.\n\nWhy is this great news? What does Apple/Eddy Cue know about running cable channels and content businesses? As a shareholder I'm not convinced putting Eddy Cue in charge of Apple M&A is such a great idea. So far a lot we've gotten out of Beats is a mediocre streaming music service and that clown Jimmy Iovine.\n\nI hope apple does buy something here, but only to get the industry to change. Once the industry loosens the grip on content, Apple should immediately spin it off. Tim may have different ideas, but in mind Apple is good at products and software (their services still needs work), but I don't know how good Apple would be at content.\n\nI'm not sure why Apple wants to become Sony. Seems to me Apple's goal should be the best platform for others to put their content on. The industry is already changing. Apple just needs to bide it's time.\n\nSo would Apple actually own these channels or just have the rights to stream them? If they provided these channels for free via Apple TV or iDevices, I wonder if they could make up the cost through hardware sales. That would really change the TV landscape.\n\nFrom the direction of the article, they'd own the channels. Time Warner spun off the Cable Co wing and got out of the distribution business ~10 years ago, and divested off Time Inc (magazines) ~2 years ago. So this end of the company is just a video content company now and owns HBO, Turner's channels, Warner Brothers, and New Line -- so about 15 total channels (using HBO as \"1\" channel) and some movie studios.\n\nIf Apple were to enter the market as a distributor, they'd be like Comcast and carry a big stick at the negotiating table for other content... a stick Comcast pretends doesn't exist. But it includes the crown jewel of paid-TV, live sports that are on TNT and TBS...\n\nWhy is this great news? What does Apple/Eddy Cue know about running cable channels and content businesses? As a shareholder I'm not convinced putting Eddy Cue in charge of Apple M&A is such a great idea. So far a lot we've gotten out of Beats is a mediocre streaming music service and that clown Jimmy Iovine.\n\nIt is a good thing. The cable providers hold way too much power and the services currently being provided are too entrenched. This is on a whole other level than iTunes or iPhone coming in and changing the game. If Apple wants to shake up the cable industry and its services, this is a rare opportunity to do so.\n\nAnd who says Eddy Cue would be 'running' Time Warner? Apple would be buying the employees along with the assets. Sure, there would be some management restructuring, and you'd weed out some undesireables (e.g. importing Apple's expectations), but it's not as if the seats would come empty."
