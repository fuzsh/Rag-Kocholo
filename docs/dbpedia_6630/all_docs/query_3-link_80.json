Headquartered in New York City, it consists portfolios of television/movie production, home box office screening and general entertainment and information channels. Time Warner Inc. was formed through the mergers of various mass media companies, such as television networks and motion picture production in America. The company had undergone spun offs for the past decades as well. This case study will discuss on the merger and acquisitions, as well as diversification of Time Warner Inc., type of mergers that this company had taken for the past decades and its marketing tactics and methods to make Time Warner Inc. as one of the competing media conglomerates in the mass media market."
