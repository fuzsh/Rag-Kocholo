        "text": "TIME Magazine (formerly of Time Warner AOL - anyone remember that?) is conversing with OpenAI about TIMEAI, I guess. So I'm going to write to you about TIME. My office has a shelf full of old TIME Magazines. I use them when I talk about multigenerational teams to show how our perspectives are shaped by the zeitgeist periods in which we lived. TIME is perfect for that. I have: üï∞Ô∏èThe issue with Lee Harvey Oswald on the cover after JFK was shot. üï∞Ô∏èThe issue after 9/11/2001. üï∞Ô∏èA bunch of Man of the Year issues...and then they were suddenly Person of the Year issues. üï∞Ô∏èVarious Presidents gracing the covers. At least 7 different presidents. üï∞Ô∏èTaylor Swift as Person of the Year (recent, of course) Many, many more - could take a picture if I were in the office now. Compare the writing style and layout of a magazine issue from 1963 with one from 2023. There's been some...change. Change in ads. Change in quality of writing. (You can guess what I'm going to say about that). OpenAI is going to ingest the archives - the data that comprises what I have in my physical copies and obviously much more. TIME's been around 100+ years. Today's more tech than cybersecurity. Low tech. I like the physical copies of books and magazines when compared to their digital counterparts. (Unless I'm traveling, when I like carrying massive amounts of digital content in a very portable device). What do you see coming out of the ingestion of a mazagine's archives into the swath of bytobytical data that is the OpenAI model set? Evidently The Atlantic is already operating like this. Some good writing there. So I must end with this...if you're lost you can look and you will find me. TIME after TIME. (Thank you, Cyndi Lauper). P.S. The photo is Time Traveler, my favorite rollercoaster. I can tell you the differences in the ride from car to car. https://lnkd.in/gjz66qUQ"
