        "text": "Suddenly on Wall Street, it's the wonderful world of Time Warner.\n\nIn a remarkable turnaround, the media company that investors love best is no longer Disney.\n\nOnly a few years back Walt Disney Co. was seen as the stable, sure-growth operation that investors adored, while Time Warner Inc. was tarred as the debt-ridden, cable-crazed drag on many a media portfolio. But in the past 12 months, Time Warner's stock has risen 61 percent, compared with a rise of only 20 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500 index and a 2 percent decline for Disney, which historically has been the industry's best performer.\n\n\"Any sector will have any one or two leading companies,\" said Christopher Dixon, a media analyst at Paine Webber Inc. \"We are seeing major rotation from Disney to Time Warner.\"\n\nYes, Time Warner still has problems _ particularly in the erratically performing Warner Brothers movie, television and music units jointly run by Terry Semel and Robert Daly. And overall, Time Warner, with $13.1-billion in 1997 sales and $246-million in profits, is dwarfed by Disney's $22-billion in sales and $1.9-billion in profits.\n\nBut Time Warner's stock price represents at least temporary vindication of the strategy of the company's chairman, Gerald Levin. Since taking the job in 1993, the 59-year-old Levin has labored under a debt that now stands at $16-billion, much of it from the $5.5-billion he has spent acquiring cable television systems.\n\nBut lately gains in cash flow have investors worrying less about the debt. Cable systems now account for 40 percent of Time Warner's operating income, which was $3-billion for the first nine months of the year, up 16 percent a year earlier.\n\nAnd with 12-million subscribers, the company under Levin has become the industry's largest cable operator _ the largest customer, in other words, for its own CNN, TNT, HBO and other cable programing services, which together account for an additional 27.2 percent of its operating income.\n\n\"Like a phoenix, cable has risen from the ashes, and the stock has risen with it,\" Time Warner president Richard Parsons said.\n\nTo some extent, Time Warner is benefiting from economic uncertainty. With some investors fearing a recession, many may feel that Disney's theme parks, which accounted for about a third of the company's cash flow through this year's first three quarters, could be hurt more than Time Warner's less cyclical cable operations.\n\nMoreover, as owner of ABC, Disney is much more exposed to problems facing the major broadcast networks. \"Cable advertising is cheaper than broadcast advertising and less likely to be hurt in a recession,\" said Dixon, the analyst.\n\nLevin, who came up the corporate ladder in the 1970s and '80s through Time Inc.'s cable business, remained a strong supporter of cable even when his critics predicted _ incorrectly, so far _ that it would be rendered obsolete by direct-broadcast satellite networks. And though his 1996 stock deal to acquire Turner Broadcasting System for $7.5-billion was criticized by some as far too costly, Turner's cable programing services have complemented Time Warner's movie and television operations.\n\nThe deal also brought what have proved to be invaluable management benefits by making Ted Turner a board member, vice chairman and 11 percent owner of Time Warner.\n\nUnder Levin's predecessor, the late Steve Ross _ who engineered the debt-defying $1-billion merger of Time with Warner Communications in 1989 _ the company developed a reputation for prof-ligate spending, symbolized by a fleet of corporate jets and huge salaries and stock-option plans. Though Levin trimmed some of those extravagances, the Turner deal brought on board an owner-shareholder who had run his own company on a tight budget.\n\n\"Jerry has done a great job,\" Turner said. Levin declined repeated requests for an interview.\n\nConfounding those who predicted a leadership battle, Levin and Turner appear to have developed an amicable relationship. Turner probably finds little to be unhappy about, given that his Time Warner stock has risen from $41.37{ a share when the merger closed on Oct. 10, 1996, to $94.75 Tuesday.\n\nStill, Levin has been faulted for a shake-up at Warner Music, once the most successful company in its industry. After the controversial departure of its veteran management team several years ago, Levin handed leadership first to Michael Fuchs, the former chairman of HBO, and then to Daly and Semel. The division is only now beginning to recover from management turmoil as well as an industry slump.\n\nBut Levin has earned the industry's respect by bringing in Parsons, formerly chairman of Dime Savings Bank, and promoting a senior vice president, Richard Bressler, to chief financial officer.\n\nTurner, meanwhile, has been active in seeing that Turner's cable services benefited from their association with Warner Brothers films. In his most publicized move, he pushed Warner Brothers to break off a planned sale to CBS and sell a package of films including Space Jam and Mars Attacks! to Turner's TNT and TBS cable channels instead.\n\nStill, the road to synergy has had its chuckholes, most notably an incident last summer involving CNN and the company's prestigious news weekly, Time magazine. After CNN produced a piece claiming that the U.S. military had used lethal sarin nerve gas in a secret 1970 mission in Laos, both CNN and Time, which had published a version of the story, had to issue retractions.\n\nAnd by any measure, the company's film business is in disarray. The Warner studio has had one of Hollywood's weakest records in recent years with box-office disappointments such as Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Mad City, The Postman, Why Do Fools Fall in Love? and The Avengers.\n\nHollywood executives and top talent agents pin the blame squarely on Daly, 61, and Semel, 52, the co-chairman of Warner Brothers, which accounts for 13.4 percent of Time Warner's cash flow. Agents, producers and rival studio executives said Daly and Semel had lost touch with the movie-going public and had focused too much on long-standing stars like Mel Gibson (Lethal Weapon) and Kevin Costner (The Postman).\n\nTurner dismissed suggestions by several executives close to the company that he was unhappy with the film results and particularly with Semel, who is most responsible for the movie operation.\n\nLed by E.R. and Friends, both among the most highly rated shows in prime time and already playing in syndication, Warner's television and film production business has shown impressive profit growth. Daly, who was president of CBS Entertainment until he joined Warner in 1980, is involved in the TV unit and is credited with the deal in which NBC reportedly paid $13-million an episode for the next five years of E.R.\n\nLevin also is still grappling with an unwieldy corporate structure created several months before Ross' death, when Time Warner sold stakes in Time Warner Entertainment to two Japanese companies and U S West. About 80 percent of Time Warner's cable subscribers and all of Home Box Office and Warner Brothers are owned by Time Warner Entertainment.\n\nThough the Japanese companies, Toshiba and Itochu, have since sold the bulk of their stakes, a 25 percent portion is still held by the U S West cable spinoff, Media One, and Time Warner had tried to extricate itself from this arrangement. But, unable to reach severance terms, the company and Media One said in July 1997 they decided to stay together.\n\nThe combination remains financially unsatisfying, in the view of Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst with Merrill Lynch.\n\n\"They have two structures _ Time Warner and Time Warner Entertainment,\" she said. \"Long-term, it is not workable. Just to get anything done with cable, they have to go to Media One for approval. It is not the ideal way to do business, having to ask your partner for permission.\"\n\nFor now, because of its strong cash flow and in light of investor disillusionment with Disney, Time Warner is looking better than it has in years.\n\nThe mouse roars no more\n\nTime Warner Inc.'s stock has become more popular among investors though its earnings have been lackluster. At the same time, Walt Disney Co. has lost favor with investors despite its steady financial performance.\n\nWalt Disney Co.\n\nEarnings per share\n\n1995 Q1: 30 cents\n\n1995 Q2: 20 cents\n\n1995 Q3: 20 cents\n\n1995 Q4: 17 cents\n\n1996 Q1: 31 cents\n\n1996 Q2: -1 cents\n\n1996 Q3: 20 cents\n\n1996 Q4: 16 cents\n\n1997 Q1: 36 cents\n\n1997 Q2: 16 cents\n\n1997 Q3: 23 cents\n\n1997 Q4: 20 cents\n\n1998 Q1: 37 cents\n\n1998 Q2: 19 cents\n\n1998 Q3: 20 cents\n\nTime Warner Inc.\n\nEarnings per share\n\n1995 Q1: -13 cents\n\n1995 Q2: -3 cents\n\n1995 Q3: -30 cents\n\n1995 Q4: 1 cents\n\n1996 Q1: -32 cents\n\n1996 Q2: -26 cents\n\n1996 Q3: -43 cents\n\n1996 Q4: -3 cents\n\n1997 Q1: -5 cents\n\n1997 Q2: -9 cents\n\n1997 Q3: -19 cents\n\n1997 Q4: 29 cents\n\n1998 Q1: -25 cents\n\n1998 Q2: 4 cents\n\n1998 Q3: -6 cents\n\nSource: Bloomberg News"
