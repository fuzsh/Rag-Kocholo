        "text": "CNN is one of the largest cable news networks in the world. It reaches about 80 million households in the U.S., while its global reach is over 2 billion people in more than 200 countries. The company also has a large digital presence, with more than 150 million visitors to its sites each month.\n\nWhen the Cable News Network (CNN) launched in 1980, it was a television pioneer. It was the first television channel to provide news coverage around the clock and the country's first all-news network. The network was one of many creations by Turner Broadcasting Systems, a television and media conglomerate founded by Ted Turner.\n\nToday, CNN is one of the many media and entertainment brands owned by Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD 2.35%). Here's a look at how CNN became part of that media giant. We'll also examine its board of directors and show you how to invest money in the entertainment company's stock.\n\nOverview\n\nWho is the owner of CNN?\n\nCNN has had several owners over the years. Turner Broadcasting System created the 24-hour all-news channel in 1980. In 1996, Turner Broadcasting System merged with Time Warner Entertainment, which already had a 20% stake in the company.\n\nIn early 2000, former internet giant AOL agreed to buy Time Warner in a $182 billion megadeal. The transaction combined Time Warner's old media (book, magazine, TV, and movie production capabilities) with AOL's online audience in one of the biggest media mergers of all time.\n\nThe AOL Time Warner deal would turn out to be a bust. A few years later, the company removed AOL from its name, and by 2009, it had spun off the fledgling internet site.\n\nAT&T (T 1.31%) would acquire Time Warner in 2018 to bring its premium content to the telecom giant's leading pay-TV subscriber base. However, like the AOL Time Warner merger, this deal didn't create the value its architects anticipated. In 2022, AT&T agreed to combine WarnerMedia with Discovery. It spun off that combined company to shareholders following the merger, which created Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nToday, CNN is part of Warner Bros. Discovery. The leading global media and entertainment company has a portfolio of content brands across TV, film, and streaming. Its iconic brands include Discovery Channel, CNN, HBO, HGTV, OWN, TBS, and DC.\n\nLargest shareholders\n\nWho are the largest shareholders?\n\nCNN has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery since 2022, when AT&T merged its WarnerMedia unit with Discovery and spun off the company to shareholders. However, while CNN has one shareholder, its parent company has many investors.\n\nShareholder\n\nAn individual or entity that owns a portion of a company's stock, entitling them to a share of its profits and assets.\n\nInstitutional investors own most of the media conglomerate's outstanding shares. These were Warner Bros. Discovery's five largest shareholders in mid-2024:\n\nThe Vanguard Group: The leading client-owned investment manager owned 244.5 million shares of Warner Bros. Discovery (10% of its outstanding shares) worth more than $2.1 billion. It held these shares in funds managed for clients, including the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (NASDAQMUTFUND:VTSM.X), the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (NASDAQMUTFUND:VFIA.X), and the Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Fund (VPMCX 0.3%). They were three of the media company's four largest mutual fund holders.\n\nNewhouse Broadcasting Corporation (Advance Publications): The privately held American media company was a major shareholder of Discovery before its merger with AT&T's WarnerMedia unit. The company received an 8.1% interest in the combined company. Its 198.2 million shares are worth more than $1.7 billion.\n\nState Street (STT 0.78%): The global financial services and bank holding company held 145.9 million shares (6%) worth almost $1.3 billion. The company manages the SPDR exchange-traded fund (ETF) series. The Communications Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLC 0.3%) was the second-largest fund holder of the media company's stock, while SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY 0.22%) was also in the top 10.\n\nBlackRock (BLK 0.05%): The leading global asset manager held 109 million shares (4.5%) worth about $951 million. The company manages the popular iShares ETF series, including iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV 0.23%), a top-10 holder of Warner Bros. Discovery stock.\n\nHarris Associates: The private investment management firm held 104 million shares (4.2%) worth almost $908 million. The fund manages the Oakmark Fund (NASDAQMUTFUND:OAKM.X) and Oakmark Select Fund (NASDAQMUTFUND:OAYL.X), which were among Warner Bros. Discovery's 10 largest mutual fund holders.\n\nBoard of directors\n\nWho is on the board of directors for CNN?\n\nWhile CNN is a separate brand within Warner Bros.
