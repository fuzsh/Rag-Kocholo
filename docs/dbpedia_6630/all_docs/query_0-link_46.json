Yahoo’s Chief Marketing Officer and media head Kathy Savitt made the announcement Thursday in a post on Yahoo’s Tumblr page.\n\nNelson joins Yahoo as the media company works to grow the digital magazines it launched early last year. She has been tasked with helping to grow Yahoo’s 13 titles in the U.S. and 30 internationally.\n\nAt Time Inc., Nelson served as the first female editor-in-chief, starting in 2012. Before taking the position, she was the founding editor of InStyle magazine, and as editor of People she expanded the magazine’s readership and reach.\n\nNelson was named one of Forbes’ Most Powerful Women three years in a row. She left the position at Time Inc. in 2013 as the company was spun off from Time Warner.\n\nAndy Serwer, former managing editor of Time Inc. publication Fortune magazine, joined Yahoo Finance earlier this year."
