        "text": "In 1450 Jews were permitted to live in Pezinok, which was inhabited by Germans and Slovaks.\n\nIn 1529 Counts Wolfang and George von Pezinok and St. George, who were heavily in debt to Jews, began to imprison local Jews. When the mutilated body of a young boy was found, it was deemed an act of Jewish ritual murder.\n\nThe imprisoned Jews were tortured in the main square until they confessed to the murder and other crimes.\n\nOn May 21, 1529, some 30 men, women, and children were burned at the stake.\n\nOnly children under 10 were pardoned and were converted to Christianity.\n\nThe pardon granted to the victims by Emperor Ferdinand I reached them late.\n\nJews were prohibited to live in Pezinok or even spend a night.\n\nIn 1540 the Protestant reformer Andreas *Osiander published a booklet repudiating the Pezinok blood libels and incriminating the count who started it.\n\nThe booklet was attacked by Johann Eck and repudiated by Martin *Luther.\n\nIn 1609 the counts of the Palffy family allowed Jews to settle on their land and in Cajla (Zeile).\n\nThey allowed them to build a synagogue and to lead a communal life.\n\nThe prohibition to live in Pezinok, except for the Palffy estates, continued until 1840 ; the community prospered but was forced to pay a \"toleration tax.\"\n\nIn 1843 a German-language private school was opened ; in 1856 it was taken over by the Jewish community.\n\nIn 1874 a new synagogue was built; it was destroyed in 1958.\n\nIn 1781 there were 88 Jews on the Palffy estate.\n\nThe census of 1785/87 lists 304 Jews.\n\nIn 1830, there were 220 ; in 1840 there were 271 ; in 1850 there were 280.\n\nIn 1857 there were 540.\n\nIn 1880 there were 321 Jews in Pezinok ; in 1919, 359 ; in 1930, 418 ; and in 1940, on the eve of the deportations, the Jewish community numbered 235.\n\nIn spite of the economic prosperity and flourishing communal life (after the 1868 Hungarian Jewish Congress, the community chose the Orthodox path), the Jews were on shaky ground.\n\nIn 1848–49, during the Spring of Nations, anti-Jewish disturbances swept the city.\n\nIn 1918, at the end of the World War I, antisemitic demonstrations, abuse, and looting hit parts of Slovakia.\n\nCzechoslovak troops (the Legions) rescued the Jews of Pezinok and helped recover some of their property.\n\nBetween the wars, Jewish communal life flourished, although the congregation was sometimes unable to pay its employees.\n\nThe congregation had a variety of social, philanthropic, and religious installations.\n\nThe Zionist movement and the Jewish party were active in Pezinok.\n\nEverything changed after March 14, 1939, with the proclamation of Slovak independence.\n\nGerman SS units entered Pezinok.\n\nOn May 18 the Hlinka Guard (the Slovak Storm Troopers) assembled Jewish men in the synagogue, forcing them to demolish it and destroy the holy books.\n\nJews were attacked in the streets and in their apartments.\n\nThey were subjected to discriminatory legislation – their property was appropriated by gentiles and their belongings were legally looted.\n\nIn 1941, there were 175 Jews.\n\nIn the summer of 1942, the Jews were deported to Auschwitz.\n\nGerman troops blew up the ancient cemetery, and the pulverized tombs were used as gravel in highway construction.\n\nThe Germans used the empty space to train their dogs.\n\nOnly a lapidarium was left to symbolize the former cemetery.\n\nFew Pezinok Jews returned.\n\nIn 1947 there were 45 Jews.\n\nSixteen local Jews participated in the anti-Nazi struggle.\n\nAfter 1948–49 most of the Jews emigrated, largely to Israel.\n\nMaurice *Loewy, the French astronomer, member of the French Academy and for a time its president, was born in Pezinok. =======\n\nHistory of Pezinoka town with the rich tradition loacted on the eastern slopes of Little Carpathian Mountains, was granted city royal priviliges, in the 13th century by King Ferdinand II, history of dynsaties Illeshazy and Palffy.\n\nThe name Pezinokinok is connected with the most tragical events of hungarian jewry.\n\nIn the year 1529, in Pezinokinok 30 innocent jews were burned, just like in Trnava, where similar vile happened events in 1494.\n\nThese events are connected to the whole hungarian jewry, we will make a picture of the history of these events.\n\nIf ones compares Hungray with the rest of Europe, one comes to conclusion that the situation of jews in Hungary was better than in the rest of the world.\n\nDuring the crusader wars, King Koloman stopped the crusaders, who robbed jews of belongings and many times killed them, at the border.\n\nIn 1251, King Bela IV, made a law in which he gave rights to jews and protected them in times where in England and elsewhere in Western Europe, the jews were killed and beaten.\n\nIn the 15th Century, while in Czech and Moravia, the jews were heartessly killed under the excuses of poisoning wells and causing the Black Plague, the jews in Hungary lived in peace.\n\nThis was the reason that many jews moved to this region from all of Europe and settled on the territory of today's Slovakia.\n\nThis caused King Matej Korvin (1458-1490) established an office of jewish leadership, \"Prince de Juifs.\"\n\nThe office was directly under the King's leadership and was responsible for the relationship between jewish and christian citizens.\n\nDuring the leader of a weak king, Ludovet II (1506-1526) the situation of jews worsened - together with the deteriotation of the country the situation of jews worsened, and anti-semitism grew.\n\nThe center of these moods were especially towns in the western part of the country - Bratislava, Sopron, Pezinokinok and Budapest.\n\nIt is not a coincidence that in the 13th Century, King Bela IV, invited the germans to live especially in these towns.\n\nThere were competition meetings between the jews and germans leading to agurments, conflicts and finally pogroms.\n\nThe fact that the jews lent money with intrest, and led a different lifestyle, made it even worse.\n\nAnti-semitisim was partly helped by the church, which by the Pope's orders supported the conversion of jews.\n\nPezinok was one of the cities with strong german influence.\n\nThe older middle-aged history of the town in unknown, the archives and documents are not ogragnized yet.\n\nYou can say with a certainty that the jews with the support of King Bela IV, settled in Pezinok in the 13th century.\n\nThey lived a part called \"Zeile\" (today caled Cajla) in documents it is called \"The Jewish Meadows.\"\n\nToday we can't say how the religous life was at that time, if they had prayer houses, synagouges, or something similar, we don't even know when they were allowed to move \"intra muros,\" inside the walls.\n\nThere are documents that jews were here and baptized.\n\nOne of them was Briccius, an instigator who caused the jewish people, his former comrades, alot of problems, and played a major roll in burning the 30 jews.\n\nIn 1529, about 150 jews lived in Pezinok.\n\nIn 1529 a body of a nine year old boy, Johann Meilinger, was found.\n\nThe Germans immediately accused the jews of killing him for ritual reasons.\n\nDue to that fact, many jews were imprisoned, tortured them, and the executioners made them admit to killing them.\n\n30 jews, men and women, were dragged to a site, and burned.\n\nAs is written in the lexicon by Korabinasky from 1786 that they called this part of town, even today, 'the jewish hill' and the children under 10, were spared and brought up as christians.\n\nAs we mentioned, there are many [german] documents about this event, which describe not just the events, but the invistigation of individual defendants, with their names and type of torture.\n\nBecause of these events, the jews in Vienna, asked King Ferdinand to investigate this case.\n\nThe King appointed Count Salama, but the results were unknown.\n\nAlso Darina Lehotska in her monogrpahy about the history of Pezinok mentions the events without commanteries.\n\nAfter the 1529 massacre, the jews left Pezinok.\n\nNot even a century later, when Pezinok became property of Count Palffy who was known for his progressive and humanistic ideas.\n\nThere is a document from 1620 where a priest from Pezinok, Jan Bod is complaining to Peter Pazmanyi is requesting to return the items of the Pezinok church which were pawned to jews.\n\nOther documents show that in the beginning of 17th Century, the jews settled in Zeile this property belonged to Count Palffy.\n\nBecause of that, the synagouge, which was built at that time was called \"Palffy-shul\" the jews lived near that synagogue.\n\nNearby was the first, maybe second, cemetary.\n\nThe first Mikvah in Pezinok was built at that time.\n\nThe religous life was renewed.\n\nIn the first half of the 18th Century any documents from then show that jews led busy, social, and religous life, due to the good government and King who helped jews.\n\nFrom documents it is known that in the 18th Century, jews lived quite comfortably.\n\nIn Pezinok, there were a few hundred of them, and they had their own rabbis.\n\nMost famous was Aaron
