        "text": "Tatra Heritage Association keeps preparing the documentary material, interesting stories, artistic photos, thematic graphics, and many others, dedicated to the Tatra brand.\n\nFascination: Tatra 815 8x8 CAS-32 V.F.D. Hrušky, October 10th, 2013 Hrušky\n\nThe volunteer fire departments' activity in our country is one of the traditions passed down from generation to generation. The Tatra brand has earned its place in the ranks of our firemen and fully functional vehicles are highly regarded also in the Hodonín region. Here, in Town of Hrušky the Volunteer Fire Department has the unique Tatra 815 8x8 CAS-32 special at its disposal.\n\nIn 2004 after difficult negotiations, the town succeeded in obtaining this former heavy military towing truck with a flatbed platform and a winch designated for export. The truck has then undergone a total transformation in Hateco Pečky workshop and was finished in the first half of 2007.\n\nFascination: Tatra 77, 22th June 2014, Prague\n\nIn the second half of June, our association received an exclusive invitation for the preview of the renovated Tatra 77. The small-scale event at the DOX center in Prague amazed us not once, not twice but three times! Because why not?\n\nFirstly, the Tatra 77 is a big dream come true for its owner, Ing. Pavel Kasík. Compared to an almost insignificant number of preserved vehicles, spare parts, materials and memories, the renovation took almost two decades to finish and without a doubt cost a huge amount of ambition, determination, persistence, thoroughness and skill. This renovation, difficult in all aspects, has proven that Tatra 77 needs and deserves only the best and the used materials and their quality serve as a proof. To see the car functional in its complete and original shape is therefore a sight to behold.\n\nSecondly, it is very important to see the car in the historical context. Tatra 77 was first introduced to public in the spring of 1934 at the Prague auto show. The Kopřivnice brand was the first to introduce a series-production car with aerodynamic bodywork, even among foreign competitors. Tatra 77 became a milestone which made the North Moravian brand one of the most famous car manufacturers in the world. Its unforced but lavish minimalistic concept makes one wonder: How was the car perceived back in its time, when it fascinates people even today? We can see the finished renovation of the car as the 80th anniversary of its existence.\n\nThirdly, it is obvious that Tatra 77 is not only historically important from the car industry point of view, but it is also a symbol of the period in which it was made. As the time passed it has become a piece of art which greatly exceeds its original purpose and utility value. The idea, aesthetic features, construction, design and craftsmanship work in harmony and considering the value of its component parts, this harmony creates a whole of immeasurable value. Tatra 77 is a reminder of a unique creative philosophy and also a sign of a bright future. It seems more than appropriate that we could see it in a center for contemporary art.\n\nWe would like to congratulate the owner on his successful renovation and express our appreciation for the owners work, and we hope he will enjoy the car as much as he can. Long live the original!\n\nSpecial thanks to: Economia, a.s. for the invitation. (www.economia.ihned.cz).\n\nExpo: LEGENDY Motoring Festival, 14th -15th June 2014, Prague\n\nIn the middle of June our association represented the traditional Czech brand Tatra at the motoring festival Legendy. Over six hundred cars participated in this event which is completely unique on the domestic front. The festival took place in the large and picturesque park of the psychiatric hospital in Prague-Bohnice.\n\nThe exhibition, carefully prepared for over two months, offered a variety of cars from the post-war period and presented a wide range of passenger cars and racing cars. The production of passenger cars was properly represented by Tatra T87, Tatra T600 Tatraplan, Tatra T603, Tatra T613 and Tatra T700. We also couldn't omit the rich racing tradition of the Tatra brand which was represented by Tatra T601 Tatraplan Monte Carlo, Tatra T607 Monopost, Tatra T603 B5 and Tatra Eccorra V8 Sport. To celebrate the 100th anniversary of serial truck production, we decided to exhibit a truck that gives the impression of an indomitable vehicle - the 8x8 version of TATRA T158 Phoenix.\n\nThe car show received well-deserved attention of not only experts and general public but also old-timers, owners, enthusiasts and parents with children. The genuine joy of children and appreciation of the old-timers were a proof of our belief that the Kopřivnice brand simply couldn't have been missed out. Judging from the spectators' response, the four exhibition drives with Tatra T603 B5 racing special made for a really spectacular show. TATRA T158 Phoenix, displayed so as to point out the advantages of its design, was also duly admired.\n\nOn top of that, owners of two limousines Tatra T603-2 and a beautiful convertible Tatra T57 joined our exhibition and complemented the original group of cars very well.\n\nWe would like to thank the organizing company CUBE production, namely the festival founder Mr. Lubor Kos and the commercial manager Mr. Ivan Pernecký, for being helpful and very responsive to all our requests. We already look forward to the next year of this great motoring festival. The Legend continues!\n\nSpecial thanks to: Regional Museum in Kopřivnice, o.p.s. for lending Tatra T607 Monopost and T601 Tatraplan Monte Carlo (www.tatramuseum.cz); Sports Car Museum in Lány for lending Tatra Eccorra V8 Sport (www.auto-muzeum.cz); Car Service KRNEPO for lending Tatra T613-1, T613 S and T613-4 (www.autokrnepo.cz); Auto Pašek for lending TATRA T158 8x8 Phoenix; Alessandro Pasquale, CEO of Karlovarské minerální vody, a.s. for lending Tatra T87; Jan Němeček and Michal Froněk, founders of the design studio Olgoj Chorchoj for lending T603-1 (www.olgojchorchoj.cz); Stanislav Hajdušek for lending Tatra T603 B5; Zdenek Hajdušek for lending Tatra T600 Tatraplan; private owners for lending Tatra T603-2 and T57.\n\nSpring meeting of the owners of classic racing cars, April 6th 2014, Brno\n\nAt the end of the first weekend in April, we received an invitation to attend the spring meeting of the owners of classic racing cars, held during the traditional tuning show at the Masaryk Circuit in Brno. Although we did not arrive in a racing car, we participated in the first warm-up lap. Hot pace set up by legendary cars of various brands was met with a well-deserved enthusiastic response from the spectators. Five laps on the track proved that vehicles with engine in the back and rear wheel drive are in many respects better suited for racing. We would like to thank our friends for the invitation and a memorable experience, and we are looking forward to the next chance to improve our driving skills!\n\nFascination: Tatra MTX V8, January 25th 2014, Prague\n\nAt the end of January we went to see another fully functional Tatra MTX V8 super sport, accompanied by Ing. Jiří Král. Although it was very cold outside, a warm atmosphere prevailed inside. Here, after more than twenty years, the leading Czech designer and engineer reunited with his famous work - the timelessly shaped sports car with Tatra 613 technology, which he worked on with his father, a renowned car designer Václav Král.\n\nReport: With Tatra 613 to Ještěd, 26 and 27 August 2013, Liberec\n\n1973\n\nIt is the year 1973 and the blue sky is illuminated by hot summer sun. The prestigious exhibition Autoprogres in Prague introduces a brand-new Tatra 613 eight-cylinder limousine to the public for the very first time. Short after the opening ceremony of the futuristic hotel and TV transmitter on top of the Ještěd Mountain is announced. It is the mountaintop which was connected with Liberec suburbs back in 1933 by cable car.\n\n2013\n\nIt is the year 2013 and the majestic eight-cylinder limousine, Tatra 613, went down in history as the last brand-new model introduced by Tatra. The revolving hyperboloid standing on the top of the mountain Ještěd has the title of building of the century for quite some time. Despite its weather-beaten appearance it has not lost any of its charm, especially when looking at it from the cabin of the cable car.\n\nReport: 14|15 Bata Institute, 24 August 2013, Zlín\n\nAt the end of August, we visited 14|15 Bata Institute in Zlín. It is situated in buildings No. 14 and 15 in the area of the former Bata factory. A well done reconstruction transformed this decaying factory unit into a modern european-level cultural center. The institute comprises of a museum, gallery, library and alternative use spaces. During the reconstruction of the functionalist building built from concrete, metal and glass, a number of expositions from Museum of Southeastern Moravia were combined to create a presentable space. It is expected that there will be more organizations using this space in the future. The grand opening of the complex will take place on September 27th, 2013.\n\nDuring our visit, we were most interested in the exhibition dedicated to the Zlín shoemaking phenomenon, the town's expansion during the First Republic era, natives' passion for travelling and the famous film production located in building 14 on the 3rd floor called Bata Principle. This comprehensive collection with audiovisual and interactive installations comprises a large number of artifacts exhibited according to the political and social framework of their time. The exhibition includes all the important people who took part and influenced the expansion of the town, development of the enterprise and film production. The well arranged, clear and attractive exhibits and information are proof of an effort to follow progressive thinking, craftsmanship and traditions of the previous generations. From the viewpoint of the Kopřivnice brand enthusiasts we cannot leave out a part of the exhibition dedicated to the travels of Hanzelka and Zikmund, dominated by the aerodynamic Tatra 87.\n\nHere they can see the collection of fine art by local artists and take a look at the urbanistic concept of the town with all the unique designs. Fans of air-cooled engines will surely appreciate design concepts for Tatra 603 and Tatra 138 together with a project for enlargement of a Tatra auto service.\n\nThe first floor of the building No. 14 presents mainly short-term exhibitons of fine arts and serves as a space for public and private events. Back at the reception desk we can see Tomáš Baťa's words: \"It's better to be a good shoemaker than a bad king.\" The possibility to change a part of a hard sole closed manufacturing facility to light walking shoes of a cultural center is good by itself. It is a proof of a timeless philosophy and a living reminder of a brighter future and at the same time it gives us an answer to the question whether it would be able to succeed in a different historical development. Even though the founder of the famous shoemaker company probably would not like to hear this, we must admit that after 80 years his message still prevails in the city of Zlín.\n\nFor more information about the institute visit: www.14-15.cz .\n\nReport: First opening of the depot in Bystřice nad Pernštejnem, 9 August 2013\n\nAt the end of July we accepted an invitation for the opening of the first classic car depot of the Veterán Tatra Klub Bystřice nad Pernštejnem, managed by the Prosecký family. This small event, preceding the traditional František Prosecký Sr. Memorial, gave the visitors an opportunity to see a result of an effort to establish one's own exhibition.\n\nAfter spending a few years in Bítov and Rožínka, this mostly private collection found a place in a former distillery in Bystřice nad Pernštejnem. This huge building with a wooden truss is perfect for this exhibition. It took almost two years, a large amount of financial resources and most importantly a tremendous amount of hard work. The project was partly funded by the Vysočina region and the town Bystřice nad Pernštejnem and their representatives were also present at the opening.\n\nAfter the ribbon-cutting ceremony, visitors entered the temple of motorism to see the exhibition comprising of about thirty vehicles, a number of motorcycles, related artifacts, trophies and toys. Aside from the Tatra cars, there are also few foreign brands to be seen, for example French Citroën, German Volkswagen and Soviet car manufacturers GAZ, VAZ and Volha. The Kopřivnice brand is represented by passenger cars and trucks made from the 1920s to 1990s. Among the most interesting cars are Tatra 12, Tatra 57, Tatra 75, Tatra 805, Tatra 603 and Tatra 613, followed by a number of rarities. For example the Tatra 43 fire truck, Tatra 30 converted to a hearse, Tatra 600 with an eight-cylinder engine or Tatra 128 truck. We also learned that this is not the final form of the exhibition and that for next season there are additions and improvements in the works.\n\nThere is a vintage banner saying that peace is where children are playing. And because ownership of a classic car is a never-ending game, we are sure that the newly opened museum will become a place of knowledge, joy and peace for everyone...\n\nWe would like to thank Martin Prosecký for a guided tour of the museum and we wish all the members of the Veterán Tatra Klub Bystřice nad Pernštejnem a lot of success in the future!\n\nFor more information about the museum visit: www.malirstvi.jihlavsko.com .\n\nA visit to the Museum of Commercial vehicles, July 5th 2013, Trhové Sviny\n\nIn early July, our association visited the Museum of Commercial vehicles in Trhové Sviny. We were welcomed by the museum operator and owner of all the exhibited automobiles Mr. Jiří Hlach himself. Mr. Hlach was a professional driver and later he became a concession holder for the Tatra brand. The extensive collection is a display of the most famous trucks and also few passenger cars of the Kopřivnice brand and is situated in a building of a former wood processing business, more than suitable for such exhibition. The bright interior of the building is decorated with photos and illustrations of motorizations. The visitors are most interested in seeing the eight-cylinder, ten-cylinder and twelve-cylinder models Tatra 111, Tatra 115, Tatra 805, Tatra 138 and 148, Tatra 813 and Tatra 815. Each model range is also represented by a various and often rare versions. For example the Tatra 111 with the HSC-4 crane, Tatra 805 \"Komando\", Tatra 813 tow truck or the airport special Tatra 815 TPL. The passenger cars production is represented by the third generation of the Tatra 603 model and first and fourth generation along with two Tatra 613 ambulance cars. Public transport is represented by the rare mountain bus Tatra 500 HB. There also other foreign and domestic car brands to be seen, for example Škoda, Ford or Mercedes-Benz. Most of the displayed cars are still fully functional and attract well-deserved attention at any classic car event.\n\nThe museum gives visitors a rare opportunity to remember the good old days, sounds of double clutch and the smell of fuel but at the same time it gives the younger generation a chance to understand the success of the Tatra brand. However, the future of the museum is unclear at the present time. Let us hope that the dealings will be successful and this interesting exhibition will stay open to visitors next year.\n\nWe would like to thank for a warm welcome and we are hoping for another visit in the future.\n\nFor more information about the museum visit: www.autodepojih.cz .\n\nReport: Weekend transport nostalgia, 16 June 2013, Brno\n\nThe historical vehicles weekend show is a one of the most popular parts of Festival Brno - City in the Centre of Europe. Car and motorcycle owners enjoy the meeting and show organized by Technical Museum in Brno every year.\n\nThe informal nature of this small event created a very pleasant atmosphere. About twenty older and newer cars of various brands gathered on the parking lot of the museum in the morning. The Kopřivnice brand was represented primarily by the Tatra 57 and Tatra 613. Among the other Czechoslovak cars presented were also models Z9 and Z18 from Zbrojovka and Škoda 450 from Mladá Boleslav. Foreign carmakers were represented by German DKW and Porsche along with British Morgan and MG.\n\nThe participants could visit the museum with its new exhibition of radio receivers and television sets to pass the time before leaving for the planned show. The friendly museum staff gave us an opportunity to reminisce about the era of incandescent vacuum tubes, vinyl records and black and white screens and readily answered every question. At 1pm, the organizers dressed in historical costumes announced the departure for the city center.\n\nA graceful ride of historical cars ordered in accordance to their year of manufacture drew a lot of attention. They parked on the Freedom Square where the public could admire the vehicles until the departure shortly before 3pm.\n\nWe would like to thank the organizers for a nice, nostalgic, gasoline-scented Sunday and we are looking forward to the next year spent in good company and with the sun above our heads.\n\nPremiere: \"Hanzelka and Zikmund's Logbook\" May 2, 2013, Zlin\n\nIn the beginning of March we visited the world premiere of the play \"Hanzelka and Zikmund's Logbook\" in The City Theater in Zlín. The story of this inseparable duo, which inspired people for generations, appeared in the world of television, radio and books many times. But this was the very first time that the theme of friendship, adventure and exact sum of coincidences made its way to the theatre stage.\n\nTatra MTX V8: Black Pearl\n\nPhotogallery of sports car Tatra MTX V8. Design by Vaclav Kral and Ing. Jiri Kral, 3.9 l V8 air cooled engine by Tatra, produced by Metalex in Pilsen. A set of images of dynamic vehicle, produced in only three specimens was taken, prepared and published by photographer Jan Hruby from partnership atelier Jan Hruby Photography.\n\nFascination: Tatra T600 Tatraplan (1:10)\n\nIn the history of the Kopřivnice brand high-quality raw materials processing is one of the chapters titled in gold lettering. Together with the design and construction of the cars it became a source of inspiration for the whole automotive industry and a dream of many men of all ages. At the motor show in Prague in 1947 a ten-year-old from Brno, later a member of our association, joined their ranks. The memory of a graceful ride through the streets of the capital lasted for decades and became an impulse to make a childhood dream of owning an elegant and aerodynamic car come true. The fulfillment of the wish, however, was not a purchase of a real car, but the making of a faithful miniature replica made of spruce wood.\n\nPresentation: MotorTechna, 10/20/2012, Brno\n\nOur association is for the first time introduced in the autumn veteran and Exchange MotorTechna exhibition, organized traditionally under unmistakable dome of Z pavilion at the Brno Exhibition Centre. Stand prepared in collaboration with Tatra Vintage workshop was during the whole day enjoying live visitor interest. With countless passersby enthusiasts and owners of cars we have long talked about our activities, future plans, ending season and Tatra brand. Visitors had simultaneously for the first time the opportunity to see a sample prepared vehicle model Tatra 77a. In order to promote our projects, we have prepared a thematic postcards and poster with fronts of Tatra 603 and Tatra 700. Thank you to all the guests for visiting and we look forward to Good bye next spring!\n\nReport: The show of historical car elegance, 9/8/2012, Tišnov\n\nIn the beginning of September we accepted the invitation from organizers of the show of historical car elegance. It took place for the twelfth time in town Tišnov this year. The veteran meeting attracted many visitors from wide surrounding who were enticed mainly by cars from the prewar manufacture. The Tatra brand was introduced by the series of models there: T12, T57, T75, T87, T600, T603 a T613. We thank to our friends for the invitation. We will be very pleased to come back next year!\n\nReport: Beskydy 2012, 9/1/2012, Horní Bečva\n\nThe first Saturday of September we participated in the traditional weekend meeting of people who own passanger cars or trucks Tatra in Horní Bečva. The local cold climate showed to everybody its pleasant side and served the participants with the ideal conditions to a nice ride in the surrounding and to fulfilling the competition tasks. The whole day discussion and the common evening gathering brought many interesting information and the worthy experience. We thank to the organizers for the opportunity to meet the other fans and we look forward to the next, the 44th, season!\n\nReport: By the veteran not only through the region of Kroměříž, 8/4/2012, Kroměříž\n\nWe visited the veteran car meeting during the first weekend of August that was organized by the Veteran Car Club Kroměříž. There were introduced many cars from the domestic and the foreign production including a few rarities by the traditional show of cars on the Velké náměstí. Naturally Tatra couldn´t miss it and was represented by models Tatra 12, Tatra 57, Tatra T600 and Tatra T603. We thank to the organizers for the nice spent afternoon and we look forward to the next year already today!\n\nReport: Weekend on the road, May 19 and 20 2012, Czech Republic, Austria\n\nDuring the last but one May weekend, our association visited three events dedicated to motor sport. Of course, we carefully documented them, both the word and the photos.\n\nSaturday\n\nThe first event visited has become a traditional vintage car market, arranged by Middle-Moravian Motorist and Bike Club of Olomouc, 18th session in a row, and that in the area of the Mohelnice autocamp. Besides the stalls of sellers, it was possible to see interesting historical cars and motorcycles which we immortalized into the photo gallery. Moreover, in the nearby area, Mohelnice Grand Prix took place in the truck trial circuit where Tatra vehicles regularly demonstrate their skills in challenging terrain.\n\nReport: Motortechna, 4/14/2012, Brno\n\nWe visited the Motortechna spring vintage cars market, organised traditionally on the premises of the Brno exhibition grounds. In the spirit of our resolutions, we were gathering inspiration for the upcoming season and debating lively with sellers and buyers on the vintage cars' scene, upcoming events, and, of course, the Tatra brand. During this year, we will continue on in some of the meetings, including reports. We thank the organizers for another successful event and we look forward to its continuation in the autumn!\n\nTatra 815 8x8: Special wrecker of the company Moravskoslezská, Ltd.\n\n1990s meant for the sphere of private enterprise a unique opportunity and freight automobile transport wasn't left behind. In the immediate response to the need of hauliers, a number of companies doing assistance and towage service therefore started to emerge, which requested the relevant technical equipment.\n\nIn the response to the initial lack of suitable vehicles, authorized representation and service of Tatra branded lorrys was among the firtst to respond, along with the company CB Korostenski, Ltd. from České Budějovice, whose workshops gave birth to a pair of Tatra 815 special wreckers in the 8x8 configuration. At first glance, only the color was the difference between those, the first specimen was yellow, the second one was orange. On closer inspection, however, slightly different superstructure and the use of modern hydraulic ensemble were evident for the orange specimen. Currently, this vehicle, but already in the light yellow colour, can be seen in the Czech Republic.\n\nIntroduction: TATRA PHOENIX, Kopřivnice, 11/1/2011\n\nThe beginig of October, our association recived invitation to the official presentation of the new series of TATRA PHOENIX heavy trucks, prepared for existing and potential customers by the the Marketing Department of Tatra, Corporation in cooperation with Tatra authorized dealers.\n\nTopic: Certificate of Origin for a Vehicle, Kopřivnice Technical Museum\n\nOver it's blessed existence, Kopřivnice automaker has arise innumerable personal and freight wagons, whose appearance, processing and mechanics still brings motoring enthusiasts from around the world to the amazement. In response to their interest, the position of Czechoslovak historic car manufacturer on the market is growing continuously and car ownership becomes, besides a dream come true, a kind of unique investment. A guide to the right choice, together with the personal preferences, is primarily the value of the car, based on its origin and status, ideally the time. The need for their validation can, for several years, greatly facilitate the certification of origin, performed by the Kopřivnice Technical Museum.\n\nReport: Tatra Phoenix, International Engineering Fair, Brno, 10/4/2011\n\nOn the occasion of the international engineering trade fair, TATRA Corporation introduced to the general public a new model range of Phoenix. For the purpose of presentation, a tipper specimen with 8x8 drive was installed in the free space of the Brno exhibition ground, attracting many visitors. We strongly believe, that it heralds the success of the next new Kopřivnice car!\n\nExperience Museum of Socialist Cars, 9/17/2011, Kozovazy\n\nIn mid-September, our association accepted invitation to recently opened automobile museum in picturesque middle-Bohemian village Kozovazy. The museum is located approximatelly thirty kilometres northeast of the capital, and offers comprehensive presentation of vehicles of the so-called real socialism era. The vast majority of displayed vehicles come from Mr. Ladislav Hrubý's personal collection, who was also our guide. The core of the exhibition is the Škoda brand, represented particularly by the series with rear drive. It is worth mentioning, for example, the elegant coupé Š 1000 MBX and sedan Š 120, whose owner has been in the past, President Václav Klaus. The Czechoslovak roads traffic recall brands Volga, Lada, Moskvitch, Dacia, Zastava, Oltcit, Fiat and Trabant. Despite their charm our air-chilled hearts yet lured a fascination for the Tatra brand.\n\nWe have visited: Veteran Arena, 7/2/2011, Olomouc\n\nThe first July Saturday, our Association visited the Museum of Historical Cars in Olomouc. To trip to the Haná metropolis inspired us, in the first place, a rich representation of Tatra cars. The Museum opened in mid-May of last year uses modern space to introduce visitors to the numerous Czech and several foreign brands. The core of the exhibition consists of a comprehensive collection of Kopřivnice cars, documenting both passenger and light commercial vehicles. The oldest of these is the model 12, the youngest is the brand's last passenger car, a series 700. The vast majority of vehicles is in perfect condition, negligible part is to be renovated. Some of the specimens are intended for sale. Visiting the Museum certainly fulfilled expectations and was pleasantly spent afternoon. We perceive the concept as very successful, both historically and economically. However, we were disappointed by the actual absence of memorabilia, which are for the time being limited to photographs along with several badges and pictorial magnets. We also believe that the possibility of photo shooting on the premises of the Museum will be all the more, if in the future, included in the basic price of admission. In each case, however, we look forward to the next opportunity to visit this interesting place and wish its operator a lot of success in the coming years.\n\nFor more information about the museum, in case of interest, see: http://www.veteranarena.cz ."
