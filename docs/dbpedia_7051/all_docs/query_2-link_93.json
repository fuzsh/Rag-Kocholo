        "text": "<strong>Editorial</strong> Dear Readers, I am very pleased to be able to introduce this issue devoted to the Czech technological heritage at a time when we are celebrating the three hundredth anniversary of the founding of the Czech Technical University, the oldest continuously operating university of technology in Europe. The Czech lands and especially Prague were known in the Middle Ages as an important centre for the crafts, science and arts. The reign of Charles IV in the fourteenth century saw the establishment of Charles University and the work of Matthew of Arras and Petr Parléř on the construction of Prague’s cathedral. Tycho de Brahe and Johannes Kepler did their scientific work in Prague at the turn of the seventeenth century under Emperor Rudolf II. Thus it was in keeping with tradition when Emperor Joseph I granted a request by Christian Josef Willenberg to be allowed to found a school of engineering in Prague. We regard this document, written in Czech and dated 18 January 1707, as the founding charter of our university. In the eighteenth century Professors Willenberg, Jan Ferdinand Schor and František Antonín Herget laid the foundations for a true polytechnical university. In the early nineteenth century it was reorganized by František Josef Gerstner on the model of the École Polytechnique in Paris. Generations of professors and graduates of our school have taken part in the design and realization of the great technical works of this country and made many important contributions abroad as well. The Prague technical school nurtured Gerstner’s design for the first railroad on the European continent, and Josef Božek’s experiments with propelling a vehicle by steam power. Here Christian Doppler described the principle that laid the foundations for radar, the tools of cosmic exploration and the instruments that help us diagnose serious illnesses. Professors Josef Zítek and Josef Schulz created such Czech national symbols as the National Theatre, the National Museum and the Rudolfinum. The school, known since 1920 as the Czech Technical University in Prague, was the workplace of Antonín Svoboda, one of the world’s leading pioneers in computer technology, and Professor František Běhounek, wellknown physicist and polar explorer. The Czech lands once formed the industrial base of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, one of the great European powers, and the teaching and research activities of the Prague technical university were a large part of the reason for this. Between the wars Czechoslovakia was one of the world’s top ten industrial powers. Today we seek to follow in the footsteps of the great scholars who served at Prague’s technical university, to teach using modern methods at a high level of quality, and hold our own research activity up to the light of worldwide competition. This issue’s profile of the institution should make that clear.
