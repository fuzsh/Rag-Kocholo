        "text": "Alter do Chão is a small village in the municipality of Santarém, State of Pará, Brazil. Located on the banks of the Tapajós River, Alter do Chão is also known as ‘The Caribbean of the Amazon’ due to the beauty of its beaches.\n\nFounded in 1626 in honor of the homonymous village in Portugal, Alter do Chão was initially occupied by indigenous communities and Jesuit missions. In the 20th century, during the rubber cycle, it became one of the routes of latex extracted in Belterra and Fordlândia until 1950. After a period of economic decay, in the 1990s, Alter do Chão opened itself to tourism (source: Wikipedia).\n\nThe village is undoubtedly one of the best tourist destinations in Brazil. I visited it only in 2020. What a regret for not having been there before!\n\nIn this article, you check out the 12 reasons why you should visit Alter do Chão and be amazed. The risk is wanting to stay!\n\n1. The beauty of its river beaches\n\nThe main reason for you to visit Alter do Chão is the incredible river beaches, both in the village itself and in its surroundings. Besides having an indescribable beauty, its warm and delicious waters make you want to spend the whole day bathing there. Many times, pink river dolphins (botos cor-de-rosa) will be diving quietly around you and this harmonic contact with nature will do surprise and delight you.\n\nBecause it’s fresh water, you don’t come out of with your body and hair all ‘sticky’, as it happens when bathing in seawater. In fact, people with long hair will love Alter do Chão!\n\nIn 2009, Alter do Chão was considered by The Guardian as the best beach destination in Brazil. Check out what Tom Philips, the Guardian’s Brazil correspondent, wrote about it:\n\n“Brazil’s best beach is not in Rio de Janeiro or the sun-bathed north-east. It’s not even on the coast. It is on a river at the heart of the Amazon rainforest. Around 30km from the rainforest city of Santarém, Alter do Chão is the jungle’s answer to the Caribbean. After a week holed up in the jungle, Alter do Chão is the perfect place to relax: you can lounge on the river beaches in the morning, gorge yourself on a local grilled fish in the afternoon and retreat to one of the area’s many charming pousadas by night. People often call the humid and dense Amazon the “green inferno”. Alter do Chão is its golden paradise.”\n\nAmong the river beaches, the tourist can visit Ilha do Amor (lit. Love Island), in Alter do Chão; and the beaches of Pindobal, Ponta das Pedras and Ponta do Cururu, which are located in the village surroundings.\n\nHint: To discover the beaches around Alter do Chão, I strongly recommend taking the Arapiuns River tour.\n\n2. Contact with nature\n\nAlter do Chão doesn’t just have beaches. The village also gives you access to trails, forests, streams, hills, canals, and riverside communities with their suspended houses to face the flood season (Amazonian winter).\n\nIn these different places, you’ll have contact (i.e. proximity) with the most diverse types of animals and plants. From the charming pink river dolphins that dive in the Tapajós River to the fearsome alligators on the banks of the Canal do Jari. You will also see monkeys, sloths, turtles, and ducks and hear the birds sing in the forest.\n\nYou will also get to know the forest trees and plants and the different uses that local people make of them. Andiroba Oil, for example, reduces muscle pain due to its analgesic properties. It did save me from a muscle strain I had on the trip to the Tapajós National Forest.\n\nAnyway, visiting Alter do Chão is the opportunity to be close to nature and realize the harmony and balance of the Amazon Forest.\n\n3. Cultural festivals\n\nThere are two cultural parties that take place in Alter do Chão and delight its tourists: the Sairé Party and the Borari Festival.\n\nThe Sairé Party lasts for 5 days and takes place in September. It’s the oldest folkloric event in the region. In fact, it’s more than 300 years old. This party, initially religious, acquired in the 1990s, also a pagan character.\n\nIn the morning, religious rituals take place: processions, prayers, and litanies. At night, the Botos Festival (Boto is the Portuguese word for pink river dolphin) takes place staging the most important folk legend in the Amazon. During the performances, in which the Botos Rosa and the Botos Tucuxi face each other, the Carimbó rhythm sets the tone for fun.\n\nThe Borari Festival, which began in the 1990s, takes place in July and portrays the richness of the customs and traditions of the Borari indigenous tribe, through its rituals and dances.\n\n4. Easy access\n\nIt’s very easy to get to Alter do Chão. The village is just 37 km from Santarém city center. For those coming from Santarém Airport (STM), access is via the PA-457 highway, which is paved and in excellent condition. From the airport, the journey takes around 35 minutes.\n\nThe main Brazilian airlines (Gol, Latam Brasil, and Azul) operate at Santarém Airport, but only domestic flights.\n\nThere are direct flights to Santarém (STM) from Brasilia (BSB), Manaus (MAO), and Belém (BEL). There are international flights to these 3 airports from Miami (MIA) or Panama City (PTY).\n\n5. Gastronomy\n\nIf you like to eat fish, Alter do Chão is your destination. On every tour you take, you can taste freshwater fish, such as Pirarucu and Tambaqui. These are just some of the diverse fish species in the region.\n\nA survey carried out at the Santarém Fish Market identified 41 different species that landed there. Five species are responsible for more than half of the fish landed last year at the fair: hake, aracu, surubim, tambaqui and tucunaré (source: G1.com).\n\nBut Alter do Chão, despite being a small village, has restaurants for all tastes. Most of them can be found around the village main square. I would cite, for example, the Italian Restaurant, the restaurants of contemporary cuisine (Mãe Natureza and Arco-Íris da Amazônia), and those specialized in fish (Piracuí and Farol da Ilha). For dessert, be sure to try the Cupuaçu or Coconut candies sold on the stools at the main square.\n\nIf you’re not very hungry, you can try a delicious hamburger from X Bom Burguer. Be aware that, on certain days, there may be a huge waiting list, but, in my opinion, it is a sign of good food.\n\nThe typical gastronomic experience of Alter do Chão is the Piracaia. A kind of luau with a fish barbecue on the beach. It’s usually organized by agencies and hotels.\n\n6. Excellent Guesthouses\n\nDespite being a simple village, Alter do Chão offers good accommodation options. There are good and cozy pousadas (guesthouses) with reasonable rates. There are a few hotel options.\n\nHowever, if you have a tight budget, you can stay in hostels or even in redários (hammocks), where prices are even cheaper. For sure, it will be a different experience!\n\n7. Cheap prices\n\nIn Alter do Chão, you will find good accommodation and good restaurants at cheap prices.\n\nThere are excellent guesthouses (review score above 8.5 on Booking) with prices around 200 Brazilian reais (about 38 USD) per night for two people with breakfast. In turn, for lunch and dinner, you will find excellent dishes for less than 50 reais (about 10 USD) in most restaurants.\n\nIf you live in a big city, for sure, you should be paying more than that for your meals.\n\nBoat group day trips cost about 150 reais (about 29 USD), which it’s also a fair price for sightseeing the beauty of the Amazon.\n\n8. Good quality internet access\n\nAs it is a village far from the urban center and in the middle of the Amazon jungle, I expected internet access to be of poor quality.\n\nBut, to my surprise, Alter do Chão has a good 4G internet connection, at least for Vivo, which is the phone operator one I use. I managed to get an internet connection even on some beaches far away from the village such as Ponta do Cururu.\n\nOn the other hand, the guesthouse where I stayed, Pousada Sombra do Cajueiro, had excellent Wi-Fi. According to the owner, a new internet provider arrived in the region and started offering good quality internet connections.\n\n9. Carimbó\n\nAlter do Chão has a lot of things to do at night. You can walk along the waterfront, visit the fair in the main square, go to the Piracaia or dine in one of its excellent restaurants. If you’re brave, you can even hire an evening tour through the forest to watch the animals.\n\nBut most of the tourists want to dance the Carimbó, a dance typical of Pará with indigenous, African, and Portuguese influences. The name Carimbó comes from its musical instrument: a handmade drum called ‘Curimbó’.\n\n‘Carimbó was brought to Brazil by African slaves. Later, indigenous and European influences, especially Iberian ones, were incorporated. The custom arose with the habit of farmers and fishermen who, at the end of their daily work, danced to the rhythm of the drum.’ (Source: TodaMateria)\n\nEspaço Alter do Chão is one of the main places for you to enjoy the Carimbó rhythm at night, after a full day of sightseeing.\n\n10. Warm weather all year round\n\nIn Alter do Chão, you will not be cold. The weather is hot all year round. The annual average temperature is 25.9 °C (around 79°F)\n\nBasically, Alter do Chão’s climate has only two seasons: a dry one, which runs from August to December, also known as Verão Amazônico (Amazonian summer), and a rainy one, which runs from January to July, known as Inverno Amazônico (Amazonian winter).\n\n11. Basic Infrastructure\n\nAlter do Chão has a basic infrastructure to support tourists. In addition to the guesthouses and restaurants, you will find a supermarket, a pharmacy, an ATM, clothing and souvenir shops, health post, churches, night clubs, among other facilities.\n\nUnfortunatelly, I didn’t see any exchange in Alter do Chão. You’d better change money in Santarém.\n\n12. Nice People\n\nSince arriving in Alter do Chão, we immediately noticed the nice people whom we had contact with. Whether in the guesthouse, in restaurants, on walks, or in the riverside communities we visit, all are very simple and attentive.\n\nNot everyone speaks English in Alter do Chão but you will be very welcome anyway!\n\nIf you like this post, check out all our English Posts!\n\nMatrix by ItaSoftware is the most powerful tool for searching for cheap airline tickets and it’s free. In our opinion, it’s the meta-search engine with the most features for you to find the best airfares as it allows queries with multiple parameters.\n\nItaSoftware Inc. is a company that provides technology solutions for the travel industry. The company was acquired by Google in 2011.\n\nMatrix has several pros over traditional meta-search engines such as Kayak and Skyscanner. It allows searches with different filters or restrictions (for example, connecting airport, airline, stops, etc.), search with multiple airport options, search with flexible travel dates, etc.\n\nThe main downsize of Matrix is that tickets cannot be purchased on the website and there is also no price alert mechanism.\n\nIn this post, we will explain how to use three features of the Matrix website to get the cheapest airfare and the most convenient flights:\n\nhow to search for the best dates to travel to a certain destination;\n\nhow to search with multiple airport options;\n\nhow to find multi-city tickets with flexible dates.\n\nA. Searching for the best travel dates\n\nIf you have flexible dates for traveling, this Matrix feature will be very useful.\n\nSuppose you want to travel from Los Angeles (LAX), USA, to Bangkok (BKK), Thailand, and want to know the best dates to travel, i.e., the ones with the lowest airfares. Suppose you also want to stay between 15 and 20 days in Thailand in 2021. BKK Airport will be your port of entry and departure.\n\nFollow the steps below:\n\n1 – Go to the Matrix website (type http://matrix.itasoftware.com on your browser)\n\n2 – Enter the city of departure in the Departing from field (in this case, LAX)\n\n3 – Enter the destination city in the Destination field (in this case, BKK)\n\n4 – In the Dates field, select See Calendar of lowest fares\n\n5 – In the Departing field, enter the departure date. We’ll start at 1. April 2021. So type or select 04/01/2021.\n\n6 – In the Length of Stay field, type the period you want to stay at the destination. You can set a fixed number of nights at the destination (for example, 15 nights) or an interval. We enter 15-20, to stay between 15 and 20 nights.\n\nThe maximum range is 7. For example, 8 to 15 nights, 10 to 17 nights, and so on.\n\n7 – You can also define other parameters, such as the currency (other than the currency of sales city), the number of passengers, and the cabin (Economy, Economy Premium, Business, or First Class). If you want to travel in economy class, just select the option Cheapest available.\n\n8 – Click the Search button\n\nEach search is done for departure dates over a month. In this case, from 1/4/2021 to 1/5/2021. And for each departure date, prices are searched to stay from 15 to 20 nights at the destination.\n\nIn April, the best departure dates are 1st, 5th, 21st, and 22nd of April 2021.\n\nThe best price is US$ 493.\n\nIf you place your mouse cursor on the departure day (for example, 5. April), a yellow table will show the lowest airfares for different lengths of stay. In this case, you can get the lowest airfare (US$493) if you stay 15 nights.\n\nAirport and other fees are included in the price shown on the website.\n\nBy clicking on this option, the website will display the flights. Sometimes, we can get even better airfares. In our case, US$ 491 with American Airlines. But for just a few dollars more, you can also fly Cathay Pacific or Japan Airlines (JAL).\n\nNow that you have found the lowest airfare for April 2021, you can repeat the same procedure for the other months and you’ll find out the cheapest prices for the year.\n\n2. Search with multiple airport options\n\nSuppose you want to travel to Europe in July 2021 and want to find out which destinations are cheaper. We consider traveling in the first two weeks of July, i.e., in the high season.\n\nIn this search, dates are almost fixed (plus/minus 1 day) and destinations and/or departure points may vary.\n\nFollow the steps below:\n\n1 – Go to the Matrix website (http://matrix.itasoftware.com)\n\n2 – In the Departing from field, enter the codes of the main US airports separated by commas. We selected New York City (all airports) and Miami.\n\nNYC, MIA\n\n3 – In the Destination field, enter the codes for the main airports in Europe.\n\nLON, PAR, MIL, ROM, BER, FRA\n\n4 – In the Dates field, select Search Exact Dates.\n\n5 – In the Outbound Date field, select the 1. July 2021. Select the Plus/Minus 1 day option, to allow a little flexibility in the departure dates.\n\n6 – In the Return Date field, select the 15. July 2021. Select the Plus/Minus 1 day option, to allow a little flexibility in the return dates.\n\n7 – Click the Search Button.\n\nThe cheapest option is purchasing an Air Caraibes return ticket from New York City to Paris for US$ 476,00. These flights are operated by French Bees. The first flight departures on 2. July from Newark Airport (EWR) and arrives at Paris Orly Airport (ORY). The return flight departures on 16. July from Orly Airport and arrives at Newark Airport.\n\nThe second cheapest option is to fly to Berlin, Germany, for US$ 560 with United Airlines.\n\nIf you click on the U$ 476 Button, you can get more details on the flight and its airfare.\n\n2.1. Destinations near a given airport\n\nWe are now going to do a search covering not only the main airports in Europe but several airports around a given airport.\n\n1 – Keeping the same parameters of the previous search, in the Destination field, type the code of any airport in Europe, such as Frankfurt (FRA).\n\n2 – Click on the Nearby option\n\n3 – An Airports near Frankfurt board will appear. In the Within field, select the option 500 miles.\n\nThis way, we’ll search for flights to all airports within 500 miles around Frankfurt (FRA).\n\n4 – Click Select all. Thus, all airports will be selected.\n\n5 – Click outside the yellow box and the airport codes will be listed in the Destination field.\n\n6 – Click Search\n\nThe search may take a while. In addition, the system may issue an error message (time out). In this case, just repeat the search.\n\nSearching for nearby airports can yield interesting results for the traveler. In fact, flying to a secondary airport sometimes can be cheaper than going to the main airport.\n\n3. Multi-city search with flexible dates\n\nNow, let’s make a multi-city search with flexible dates. By the way, the ITA Matrix is ​​the only tool that allows doing this kind of search. Other meta-search engines (kayak, Skyscanner) only allow you to do multi-city searches with fixed dates.\n\nMulti-city search is useful for example if you want to add a stopover on your trip.\n\nLet’s look at an example.\n\nStopover (in Dubai in the first direction)\n\nDay 1: New York City – Dubai\n\nDay 5: Dubai – Hong Kong\n\nDay 15: Hong Kong – New York City\n\nMulti-city search is also useful to find open-jaw tickets (return ticket where the destination and/or the origin are not the same in both directions). In fact, the multi-city search allows you to obtain prices for a set of totally different segments, without any link between them.\n\nDespite the flexibility offered by multi-city search, it’s not recommended to make trips with segments totally unrelated from each other, as, most likely, you will have to fly with different companies, which will imply higher airfares.\n\nIn our example, we want to fly back and forth from Toronto (YYZ) to Bangkok (BKK), with a stopover in Istanbul (IST), Turkey, on the way. We know the approximate dates (first two weeks of April 2021), but we have flexible dates for each stay.\n\nFollow the steps below.\n\n1 – Go to the Matrix website (http://matrix.itasoftware.com)\n\n2 – Select the Multi-city tab (next to the Round-Trip and One-Way tabs)\n\n3 – For each flight segment, enter the departure, the destination, and the date.\n\nFlight 1: Departure from: YYZ\n\nDestination: IST\n\nDeparture Date: 1. April 2021\n\nFlight 2: Departure from: IST\n\nDestination: BKK\n\nDeparture Date: 5. April 2021\n\nTo add a third flight, click the Add Another Flight option\n\nFlight 3: Departure from: BKK\n\nDestination: YYZ\n\nDeparture Date: 15. April 2021\n\n4 – To include flexibility in the dates of each segment, just change the option On this day Only, next to each flight, to Plus/Minus 1 day or Plus/Minus 2 days. We chose the flexibility of 2 days.\n\n5 – Click the Search Button\n\nHint: If you want to stopover, the best option is to fly with an airline that has a hub in that city. In this way, you minimize the number of connections and, consequently, the overall flight time. In the above example, it is recommended to fly Turkish Airlines.\n\nIn this case, the best price is CA$ 1,422 (about US$ 1,095), according to the dates described below. But, on the search results page, you’ll also find many combinations for the same price.\n\nBottom line\n\nI hope you enjoyed these ITA Matrix features, which have been very useful in our travels. You can see that it is the most powerful and flexible tool to find cheap airline tickets.\n\nMatrix still has many other search options to explore. How about combining the features above? For instance, a multi-city search with flexible dates and a search with multiple airport options? Enjoy!\n\nWho has never had issues with travel agencies (or day trip providers)? During my worldwide trips, I had problems with many of them. I’ll give you some examples.\n\nIn Krakow, the tour guide passed by my hotel and didn’t pick me up (probably he didn’t find me), although I was in the lobby well before the scheduled time.\n\nIn Beijing, we took unwillingly a ‘sponsored tour’, which, besides taking us to the Great Wall, which was our main intent, took us to several stores with very pushy vendors. After visiting the main attractions and bothered with so many undesired stops, we ended up running away from the guide and returning to the hotel on our own.\n\nIn Huaraz (Peru), the route taken by the tour was quite different from the one described in the prospectus. Later after our complaining, the agency gave us a refund.\n\nThe worst experience happened in Malta\n\nHowever, my worst tour experience ever took place recently in Malta with a company called Supreme Powerboats. Here I am going to share with you my story so that you don’t have the same unpleasant experience if you ever go to Malta.\n\nBooking the tour\n\nThe company counter is next to Sliema Ferry port, from where the ferry to Valletta departs.\n\nIt was late afternoon. Before taking the ferry, we booked a tour to the Blue Lagoon, which is a very famous (and crowded) attraction located on Comino Island in Malta. The tour was scheduled for another day.\n\nThe price was 45 euros per person (see company website), but if we hired the tour on the spot, the seller would have 15 Euros off.\n\nThen we decided to pay 30 euros for the speedboat tour. With speedboats the journey from Sliema to Comino Island in 20 minutes. With traditional boats (offered by other companies), the trip to the Island usually takes 1h30m, but costs half the price (15 Euros).\n\nThe salesperson called someone on a cell phone and the tour was confirmed for 9:30 am for two days ahead.\n\nI paid by credit card a tour for 4 people, totaling 120 Euros. I got a receipt and the seller asked our phone number to contact us if there were any changes. I wrote down two phone numbers on the sales receipt.\n\nOn the day of the tour\n\nOn the scheduled day, my wife realized she had lost the tour receipt. She should have thrown it in the trash along with other papers that we accumulate during the trip.\n\nHowever, we believe this wouldn’t cause any problem, as our name and phone number were written on the sales receipt. In addition, it’s normal for agencies to have a list of who is going to take the tour. Some agencies ask for a voucher and others don’t.\n\nWe arrived at the counter early trying to solve this issue. We exposed the situation to the employee who was at the counter. The guy with whom we bought the tour wasn’t there at the time.\n\nFrom the beginning, they were very rude and without any consideration. I noticed, right away, that the fact of having lost the receipt could be used as an excuse for not letting us board and, furthermore, saying that it was our fault. Sure enough!\n\nThey left us waiting for several minutes while attending to other customers.\n\nI asked one of the employees to solve my problem. He looked at me very angry and did nothing. We were waiting for so long time and none of them even tried to look for our reservation in the receipts.\n\nExtortion\n\nAfter a while, another employee arrived and said that he could only take us onboard if we paid an additional fee of 20 Euros per person. It was a type of extortion: we either agreed to pay what he demanded, or we wouldn’t take the tour.\n\nImmediately, I didn’t accept the ‘proposal’ and showed him the credit card payment receipt on my cell phone.\n\nAgain, no effort to solve the issue. Neither did they check the receipts, nor did they consider the payment receipt for the card. Nothing!\n\nWhenever we tried to argue with him, he asked: ‘What did you not understand?’\n\nAnd the situation escalated. We said that we would report the case on Tripadvisor. On the other hand, they said it was our fault!\n\nThreats\n\nMy friend started shooting the scene with her cell phone.\n\nThen the guy said: ‘are you filming me? Delete it right now!’\n\nWe said we wouldn’t erase it. Then he threatened to call the police.\n\nAnd he supposedly called a police officer but unsuccessfully.\n\nAt this time, there were different opinions in our group on what to do next. Some felt we should wait for the police and tell them the situation. Others thought we should not, like me. After all, the officer could actually be a bad-tempered cop colluded with the employee. We never know!\n\nThen we went out. Leaving the scene, the guy still came after us and even threatened to break my friend’s cell phone. I clearly heard him saying: ‘crash your cell phone’.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAll things considered, my view of this travel agency couldn’t be worse. Rude and violent employees unwilling to solve customer’s problems, to say the least.\n\nSome reviews that I later found on Tripadvisor confirm my view. In fact, 8 of them consider the experience with Supreme Powerboats Terrible. Check out some reports!\n\nWhat I can recommend is that, if you ever visit Malta, avoid Supreme Powerboats Malta at all costs and be sure to read the your travel agency’s reviews before hiring a tour.\n\nI don’t know if I’ll be able to get the money back, but, I think I fulfilled my duty by reporting this experience to the blog readers. Of course, the experience could have been much worse …\n\nAnd what about the Blue Lagoon?\n\nTo enjoy the day, we ended up hiring a tour to the Blue Lagoon with another agency. But this time we took a big boat. Although the lagoon is very beautiful with crystal clear waters, it’s very very crowded. There wasn’t even space to put our personal stuff. It was a hard day. But I’ll tell you more in another post …\n\nCopa Airlines is an airline headquartered in Panama City and a member of Star Alliance. It’s the actual Pan American airline as it connects countless destinations in South, Central, and North America and also the Caribbean. The capillarity of the company on the American continent is impressive. Copa Airlines’ hub is Tocumen International Airport (PTY), which serves Panama City, and deserves the title of Hub of the Americas.\n\nRecently, I traveled between Cartagena (CTG) and Brasilia (BSB) in Copa Airlines business class, connecting in Panama City (PTY). I report below my experience. Check out!\n\nPurchasing the ticket\n\nWhen searching for flights on Copa Airlines’ website, you will see a table, with different flights in rows and different fares, in the economy, and business classes in columns. There are two rates for Business Class (Promo and Full). Select the desired flight and fare.\n\n#Hint\n\nSometimes, you find fares in ‘Business Promo’ (Executiva Promo) slightly higher than or even lower than those of the economy class(see figure above). In this case, paying a little extra is worth it!\n\nOn round-trip tickets, you can purchase one leg in economy class and the other one in business class.\n\nThat’s what I did. In this last leg, the difference between the fare was only R$100 (about 18 USD in today’s currency exchange rate).\n\nBid Upgrades\n\nAnother option to fly executive on Copa Airlines is to buy the ticket in economy class and participate in auctions of Business Class seats.\n\nIf your flight is eligible and seats are available, you’ll receive an email with the opportunity to make an offer. You enter the amount you are willing to pay for a particular flight segment, fill in the payment information, and confirm the offer.\n\n“You will be notified if you have upgraded between 48 and 12 hours before the flight leaves. Your credit card will not be charged if you don’t get the upgrade. Each leg of your trip is evaluated individually and upgrades are granted according to the availability and the evaluation of the offers received for each leg. ”\n\nIf you are going to participate in an auction, the tip is always to make the minimum bid, as this is usually a considerable amount.\n\nFor some shorter duration legs, there is the Instant Upgrade. In this case, a fixed fare is established by the airline, but you instantly get upgraded.\n\nFlights and Aircrafts\n\nThe flight CM 687, between Cartagena (CTG) and Panama (PTY), lasts 1h20 and is operated by Boeing 737-800B, a single-aisle aircraft (narrow-body). In Business Class, there are 16 seats in 4 rows, in the 2-2 seat configuration.\n\nOn this flight, I noticed that the pitch (distance between the seats) is longer (48 inches) and that the aircraft had an entertainment system available to passengers. The recline could reach 28°. Excellent for those who want to rest.\n\nThe seats also had power outlets. I took the opportunity to charge my notebook.\n\nThe flight CM 204, between Panama (PTY) and Brasilia (BSB), lasted approximately 6 hours and is operated by Boeing 737-800A. The business class seat configuration is identical to the first flight, but the model is inferior.\n\nThere was no entertainment system and the pitch was shorter (38 inches). Also, the seat inclination reaches only 15°. Besides, there was no power outlet.\n\nUnfortunately, Copa Airlines uses for medium-haul flights (such as to Brasília) an aircraft model inferior to that one used for short-haul flights (such as to Cartagena).\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that, in either model, the seats are comfortable for flying 6 or 8 hours.\n\nNote: the two times I took the flight from Brasília (BSB) to Panama City (PTY), I found that the aircraft used by Copa Airlines was also inferior to that one used on the Guarulhos (GRU) – Panama (PTY) route.\n\nCopa Airlines Business Class Benefits\n\nFlying the executive on Copa Airlines has several benefits. I evaluate each one below.\n\n1. Check-in Priority\n\nAt Cartagena Airport (CTG) there was an exclusive check-in queue for Business Class passengers or Star Alliance elite customers. However, even the economy line was not long.\n\n2. Vip Lounge Free Entrance\n\nThere’s no Copa Airlines VIP Lounge in Cartagena, Colombia, only at the Airport in Panama. As my connection was short, only 20 minutes between the arrival of the first flight and the departure time of the second, I didn’t visit the Lounge.\n\nPTY airport was also very crowded. My first concern was finding the departure lounge for my second flight (PTY-BSB).\n\nI used my limited time at the airport to shop. A bottle of Montes Alpha Chilean wine, which in Brazil costs R$166, in duty-free went for US$ 19. At that time, it cost less than half the price. Check product prices on the Attenza Duty Free website, one of the airport’s stores.\n\nLater, I asked some passengers who told me the Lounge in Panama Airport is good but very crowded.\n\n3. Boarding Priority\n\nBusiness Class passengers or Star Alliance elite customers also have boarding priority. In my case, it allowed fast boarding both in Cartagena (CTG) and in Panama City (PTY).\n\n4. More comfortable seats than the economy class\n\nSee the comment above.\n\n5. Amenity Kit\n\nDuring the flight, an Amenity kit provided has amenities such as toothbrush, toothpaste, eye patch, etc. It’s simple compared to traditional airlines, but compatible with medium-term flights.\n\n6. Special Onboard Service\n\nIn my opinion, one of the main pros of flying business class is the on-board service. Very good for medium flights. In the first flight, a shorter one, a delicious vegetable omelet was served.\n\nIn the second flight, two meals were served: dinner, at the beginning of the flight, and a ‘Merienda’ (snack), at the end of the flight.\n\nFor dinner, we have roasted almonds as an appetizer.\n\nThe starter was a vegetable cream, green salad, and bread.\n\nAs a main dish, there were two options: a fillet medallion accompanied by ‘flan de maiz’ or a fish fillet with green pea sauce. I decided on the first option.\n\nFor dessert, they served chocolate cake and cheesecake.\n\nTo drink, there was a good selection of wines, white or red, and other alcoholic beverages: whisky, rum, vodka, and beers. I drank a Chilean wine Concha y Toro Gran Reserva Riberas. Great!\n\nMerienda, in turn, was a sandwich with salmon, cream cheese, and caramelized onions.\n\n7. Points or Miles\n\nWhen flying Business Class, the number of points (or miles) you get in frequent-flyer programs is usually higher than in Economy Class. In ConnectMiles, Copa Airlines’ loyalty program, the award miles for ‘Executive Promo’ are 150% of the base value, while in the Economy, they range from 50 to 125%.\n\nIn my case, I chose to put my points on LifeMiles. I got 2,759 points for the PTY-BSB flight in Business Class, which was higher than the 2,069 points got from the BSB-PTY flight (in Economy Class).\n\n8. Checked Baggage Allowance\n\nIn Business Class, the baggage allowance is bigger than in economy class: 2 checked bags up to 64kg.\n\nIf you purchase a ticket in ‘Economy Promo’ or ‘Classic’ fares, you’ll have to pay USD 40 to check the second bag. Only in ‘Full Economy’ fare, the franchise includes the second bag.\n\nGeneral Review\n\nCopa Airlines’ Business-Class can be an excellent option if the difference between the economy and business fares is very small.\n\nEven considering the inferior model of the aircraft used on flights to Brasília, I found the seats quite comfortable. The onboard service was also very good.\n\nFor medium-haul flights, I rate the experience as a good one.\n\nIf you like this article, don’t forget to check all our English posts.\n\nI always say to my foreign friends that ‘Brazil isn’t just Rio de Janeiro’. In fact, we have a lot of other tourist destinations that aren’t so famous abroad. Florianópolis, on the southern coast of the country, is one of them. It’s one of the best places to live in Brazil and also a nice and safe place to visit.\n\nFloripa, as we informally call it, is the capital of the State of Santa Catarina. The municipality comprises of two parts: the insular portion and the continental portion. The Insular portion is the biggest part of Florianópolis and it’s called Santa Catarina Island. It’s huge! The island is 54 km (33.5 miles) long and 18 km (11.2 miles) wide and encompasses about 60 incredible beaches. In the continental portion, there are also beaches, but they are not so famous as the insular ones.\n\nToday, we’re going to explore the southern coast of Santa Catarina Island, a beautiful, quiet and enchanting region. There are beautiful beaches, islands, lagoons, and trails where you get in direct contact with nature and enjoy the delicious cuisine of the ‘manezinhos’, as we call the local people.\n\nIn this post, you’ll find a perfect 1-day itinerary for you to enjoy the southern coast of Floripa. The itinerary was tested (and approved) on our last visit to the city. It’s perfect for those staying in the Campeche neighborhood, but if you’re staying in another region, just make small adaptations.\n\nWe used Uber to get around the Island. It’s a good and cheap way to get to the points of interest. The service availability is good, and we didn’t have to wait long for the vehicle to arrive. Also, there’s not much traffic on this route.\n\nWe begin our journey at Campeche Beach. Check it out!\n\n1. Campeche Beach\n\nCampeche beach (Praia do Campeche) is the largest beach in extension on the southern coast of Florianópolis. Situated in a neighborhood of the same name, the beach is located between the famous Joaquina beach and Morro das Pedras beach. It’s an oceanic beach (in Floripa, there are also beaches facing the mainland) with icy waters and, sometimes, strong waves.\n\nThe beach name comes from a tree called “Campeche” or “Pau de Campeche” widely found in that region during colonization times. A dye was extracted from the wood.\n\nDespite attracting many tourists, Campeche beach isn’t very crowded. Along the beach, there are few tents and restaurants, which makes it a more rustic and familiar place. However, you will find many restaurants and bars along Pequeno Príncipe Avenue, which is the main access to Campeche beach.\n\nThe Campeche neighborhood itself is also a somewhat simple and rustic place that reminds me Ubatuba, a coastal city in the State of São Paulo, in the 1980s. I sincerely hope Floripa keeps this way!\n\nCampeche is an excellent accommodation region for those visiting Florianópolis. Besides allowing you to make this itinerary, it has easy access to Florianópolis International Airport – Hercílio Luz (FLN). After the inauguration of the new terminal, a new road was built and made it even faster to get to Campeche. In 10 to 15 minutes, you will be at your hotel or hostel.\n\nBy the way, aircrafts heading to FLN airport fly over Campeche Beach.\n\nAmong the points of interest in the Campeche region, we can cite Riozinho, Novo Campeche, Lagoinha Pequena and Ilha do Campeche.\n\nCampeche Island\n\nIf you have a free day, it’s worth visiting the Campeche Island (Ilha do Campeche), a beautiful island with calm and transparent waters just in front of Campeche Beach. It is not without reason that the place is known as ‘Santa Catarina Caribe’. The island was considered Cultural and Landscape Heritage in 2000.\n\nThe fastest way to get there is from Campeche beach itself. The journey takes 5 to 10 minutes. It costs between R$ 80 (about 15 USD) and R$120 (about 22 USD), depending on whether we’re in low or high season, respectively.\n\nThe tours take place daily in high season (December – March) and may not occur every day during the low season. The number of visitors is limited per day. Payment for transportation is made in cash. Our recommendation is to hire a travel agency to guarantee your visit.\n\n2. Armação Beach\n\nFrom Praia do Campeche we went south on the SC-406 highway to Praia da Armação. The journey is 9 km and lasts around 16 minutes. The estimated Uber ride cost is R$ 13.50 (2.50 USD).\n\nArmação Beach (Praia da Armação) is also an oceanic beach but with calm waters. It’s one of the main artisanal fishing sites on Santa Catarina Island. The atmosphere is simple, rustic, but pleasant. I especially liked to contemplate the landscape with several boats anchored in the sea.\n\nHowever, the sand strip is narrow and there are several constructions on the shore, preventing direct access by those who come from the street. Many people usually get to the beach through the Fishermen’s Association which is at the southern end of the beach.\n\nThe place doesn’t have much infrastructure but you can find simple bars and restaurants there. You can also rent some beach chairs.\n\nIn Armação, it’s worth visiting the beach viewpoint to appreciate the scenery and also visiting the Santana Parish.\n\n3. Campaign Island\n\nAt the southern end of Armação Beach, a wooden bridge over stones gives access to Campaign Island (Ilha das Campanhas). Also called ‘Ponta das Campanhas’, it is a small island with a shape similar to that of a peninsula.\n\nIt’s also a nice place for contemplation, especially if you are at the pier (pier) where fishermen’s boats usually dock.\n\nIn 15 minutes, you can walk the entire island. But I’d rather sit under a tree and enjoy that wonderful panorama.\n\nAround the island, rock formations create natural pools. From the highest part of the island, you can have a beautiful view of the beaches of Armação and Matadeiro.\n\n4. Matadeiro Beach\n\nCrossing the creek near the wooden bridge, a trail leads to Matadeiro Beach (Praia do Matadeiro), one of the tourists’ favorites. It is the third-best activity in Florianópolis according to Tripadvisor. The place is perfect for those who want to enjoy nature with tranquility.\n\nIf you don’t want to get your feet wet, that’s fine. There is a walkway that crosses the stream, but it’s a little further from the beach.\n\nWalking the trail takes 5 to 10 minutes. The trail is cemented and, in some sections, quite steep. However, in the higher parts, you will be surprised by the beautiful look. Get on a rock and take lots of pictures!\n\nAt Matadeiro beach, the sea is also icy and the waves are stronger. Therefore, it is also very frequented by surfers. There are kiosks on the beach, among which, the Borinelli Bar and Restaurant and the Mergulhão. I took the opportunity to have a beer!\n\nWhere do the names Matadeiro and Armação come from? The names originate from the time whaling was allowed in Florianópolis in colonization times. In Armação (in Portuguese, ‘armar’ means to arm/set/pinch), boats set up an ambush (trap) for whales that were taken to Matadeiro beach (in Portuguese, ‘matar’ means to kill), where they were surrounded and killed. From the whale, people used to extract oil, meat, and fat. The oil was used in public lighting.\n\nFrom Matadeiro beach, you can take a 2-hour hike trail that leads to Lagoinha do Leste Beach. Another trail leads to Falcão Lookout (Mirante do Falcão), but get ready to walk.\n\n5. Arante Bar & Restaurante\n\nFrom Praia da Armação we went south on the SC-406 highway to Praia do Pântano do Sul, where we had lunch. The journey is 4.5 km and lasts around 8 minutes. The estimated Uber ride cost is R$ 8.00 (1.50 USD).\n\nArante Bar & Restaurante is a restaurant specializing in seafood, at Praia do Pântano do Sul. It is a very traditional restaurant among the island’s residents. The atmosphere is simple, but the food is good. Besides, it overlooks the beach.\n\nArante Bar was an old stop for travelers. Far from Florianópolis city center, the place was also used as a lodging for travelers to follow their route the next day. Mr. Arante founded the bar in 1958.\n\nWe tasted delicious fish with shrimp sauce and I took the opportunity to have another beer. The dishes are well served. They serve up to 4 people.\n\nA main characteristic of the restaurant is that the walls are filled with little notes left by customers. There are many messages written in many languages. It is impossible to read them all!\n\n6. Pântano do Sul Beach\n\nAfter lunch, we went for a walk at ‘Praia do Pântano do Sul’. We’re in the extreme south of Florianópolis.\n\nThe beach isn’t that beautiful, but it is pleasant to take a walk. It is rustic, quiet, and also a stronghold of fishermen. In fact, we also see many fishing boats anchored at sea. There is virtually no traffic in the neighborhood.\n\nBesides Arante Bar, you can also find other restaurants and bar there and, on the beach, there were also some stalls for handicrafts and jewelry.\n\nIf you continue to walk, we will get to Açores Beach (Praia dos Açores) and Praia da Solidão (lit. Loneliness Beach). Something tells me it’s a very quiet beach!\n\n7. Peri Lagoon\n\nFrom Praia do Pântano do Sul we went north, returning by highway SC-406 to Peri Lagoon. The journey is 5.8 km and lasts around 11 minutes. The estimated Uber ride cost ranges from R$ 12 to R$ 14 (from 2.23 to 2.60 USD).\n\nPeri Lagoon (Lagoa do Peri) is a 5.2 km2 freshwater lagoon with a depth of up to 11 meters. Considered Natural Heritage (1976), today it is a Municipal Park surrounded by an immense area of Atlantic Forest.\n\nBesides bathing on freshwater beaches, the park is ideal for picnics, kayaking, or ecological hikes. It has some infrastructure, but it is good to bring your own food. The atmosphere is familiar.\n\nThe municipal park is open from 8 am to 6 pm.\n\nMorro das Pedras Lookout\n\nIf you want to extend your tour a little further, you can go to the Morro das Pedras viewpoint, which is 3 km north, on the SC-406 highway, going up a slope. From there, you enjoy an incredible view of Praia do Caldeirão.\n\n8. Back to our Guesthouse in Campeche\n\nFrom Peri Lagoon we head north to our Guesthouse in Campeche. The journey is 9 km and lasts around 10 minutes. The estimated Uber ride cost ranges from R$14 to R$16 (2.60 to 3.00 USD). Now it’s time to rest!\n\n9. Pizzarium Pizza Artesanal\n\nThen, at night, we went to Pizzarium Pizza Artesanal, on Pequeno Príncipe Avenue, in the Campeche neighborhood. The pizzeria was very close to our Guesthouse. It was the second time that we ate there.\n\nThe pizza was very good, so was the service. The value for money is excellent. But, what I liked most was the wine prices. Some are even cheaper than in the supermarket.\n\nBoth Mr. Danilo, the owner, and the attendant were very friendly and helpful. It was he who the day before gave us the tips for this tour on the southern coast of Florianópolis.\n\nI hope you’ve enjoyed our itinerary (or Mr. Danilo’s one). Don’t forget to check out our other English Posts!\n\nBudapest is the capital of Hungary. It was founded in 1873 with the merger of three cities: Buda and Óbuda, on the right bank of the Danube River, and Pest, on the left bank. It is one of the most beautiful and most visited cities in Europe. Besides, the cost of travel in Budapest is much cheaper than in traditional European capitals (London, Paris, Rome).\n\nIt is worth spending 4 or 5 days in the city, because Budapest, besides being beautiful, is full of attractions, especially in the Buda region. We spent 3 days there but it was not enough to enjoy everything the city has to offer.\n\nCheck out our reports and tips from this incredible tourist destination!\n\nGetting to Budapest from Bratislava\n\nWe arrived in Budapest, Hungary, by train from Bratislava, Slovakia. The direct, unconnected train runs from Bratislava Station (Bratislava hlavná Stanica) to Budapest-Keleti Station (East Station) and the journey takes 2h42min.\n\nI was not able to buy the ticket through the Slovakrail.sk website, which at that time only provided information about times, sections, and possible connections. We bought the ticket at the Bratislava train station.\n\nThe price was 17.10 Euros for a second-class seat plus 2 Euros for seat reservation.\n\nThe train was comfortable but it was delayed a few minutes. What I found really inconvenient was people occupying the reserved seats without worrying about whether they were reserved or not.\n\nAnyway, I think the train is the best option to get to Budapest. BUD airport is a long way from the city center. It takes at least 30 minutes by taxi without traffic.\n\nOur train was the EC 273 Csárdás, which operates between Prague and Budapest, passing through Bratislava. For more information on the train, click here.\n\nGetting Around Budapest by Metro\n\nWe arrived in Budapest at 1 pm. The Keleti station was a little far from our hotel, but we just took the M2 metro, got off at the Kossuth Lajos Tér station (next to the Parliament), and walked 600 meters to reach our hotel.\n\nThe metro ticket costs 350 HUF and can be purchased at the vending machines at the station but they must be validated at the metro’s entrance.\n\nBe aware: there were some “strange” people wandering around the lines of the machines. Some asked for money, others hit the machines to see if they could get something out of them.\n\nHungary’s Currency\n\nHungary’s currency is not the Euro but the Hungarian Forint (HUF), a non-convertible currency, and not very easy to find outside Europe. Therefore, you will have to change your money when you arrive in the city!\n\nTip: Do not change a lot of money at the Keleti station exchange shops. The exchange rate is absurd: extremely disadvantageous for the tourist. The best quote at the time was 1 EUR = 249 HUF, and the quote presented by Google was 1 EUR = 312 HUF!\n\nWe exchanged money at Star Change, an exchange recommended by our hotel attendant. It’s on Bajcsy-Zsilinszky avenue. There we got a net exchange rate of 1 EUR = 311 HUF. Great!\n\nWhere to stay in Budapest?\n\nWe stayed at Hotel Parlament. The hotel is very good! It is a 4-star hotel, with a clean and comfortable room, good breakfast, and free wifi. It’s very well located, 600 meters from a metro station, the Hungarian Parliament, and the Danube River. It is also located close to the Budapest-Nyugati station. There is a supermarket, pharmacy, shopping center, and restaurants very close to the hotel for the convenience of the guest.\n\nThe attendants are friendly and helpful. One of them gave a lot of information about the stores, attractions, and about where to change money. There is also a spa at the hotel, but it’s small, just a bathtub, and when I thought about going there, a couple already occupied it, which, so to speak, made my entry unfeasible.\n\nUp to 2 pm guests have complimentary coffee and water in the hotel lobby.\n\nWe paid 287 Euros for 3 nights for a double room with breakfast.\n\nDay 1\n\nSt. Stephen’s Basilica\n\nOur first activity in Budapest was to visit St. Stephen’s Basilica (Szent István Basilika), which is also located on Bajcsy-Zsilinszky Avenue, next to the metro station of the same name.\n\nThe Basilica is huge. It’s one of the tallest buildings in Budapest. It is beautiful, both inside and out. Definitely, a must-visit for tourists.\n\nIt’s a Roman Catholic basilica, which began to be built in 1851 and was not finished until 1905. It was named in honor of King St. Stephen (975-1038), the first King of Hungary.\n\nThe basilica is full of stained glass, works of art, and statues. In addition to visiting the lounge, it is possible to go to the top of the elevator building for an observation deck, but you must pay to go up.\n\nHungarian Parliament\n\nFrom there, we walked to the Parliament building. Undoubtedly, the Hungarian parliament is the main tourist attraction in Budapest, Hungary.\n\nIt was built in Pest in the late 19th century. The building is eye-catching to all city visitors.\n\nThe visitor center is on the northern side of the Building. The tours are guided and are available in several languages: English, Hungarian, French, Hebrew, German, Russian, Italian, and Spanish. Our visit, in Spanish, was scheduled for 4 pm.\n\nBuy the tickets in advance. It is possible to buy locally or online (click here).\n\nThe visit lasts 50 minutes and covers the beautiful halls, lobbies, and stairs of the building. The stairs’ ceiling and walls, which are all covered with gold leaf, caught my attention.\n\nIt is possible to take photos during the visit, except in the dome hall, which is in the center of the building, where the crown of King Saint Stephen is guarded by soldiers.\n\nThe building houses the Hungarian National Assembly, a unicameral parliament composed of 199 members elected for a 4-year term. The building is symmetrical, since, at the time of its construction, the parliament was bicameral (two chambers: lower chamber and upper chamber).\n\nIn summary, the parliament is magnificent. It is also worth watching it at night all lit up, in the Buda region, across the Danube River. It is so beautiful inside and out, which justifies being the No. 1 attraction according to Tripadvisor.\n\nIl Pastaio Restaurant\n\nIn the evening, we went to dinner at Il Pastaio, an Italian restaurant, in central Budapest (District V), in the square where the Milály Vörösmarty statue is located. I ended up eating a pizza and drink a glass of wine. Both were excellent! I really liked the service and the staff could speak Italian.\n\nComme Che Soi\n\nIn fact, we wanted to have dinner at Comme Che Soi, which is the best restaurant in Budapest, according to Tripadvisor, but unfortunately, it was not possible.\n\nThe restaurant is highly rated and the comments are positive. But, it’s necessary to book in advance. To give you an idea, when we asked the mâitre for a reservation, he said he only had a place for the next week. Unviable for those who would only stay 3 days in the city.\n\nAnyway, the food seemed to be very good. If you are visiting Budapest, be sure to book it well in advance.\n\nA walk along the banks of the Danube River\n\nAnd we finished the night off by walking on the other side of the Danube River, in Buda, where we could take night photos of the Széchenyi Lánchíd Bridge and of the Hungarian Parliament.\n\nDay 2\n\nOn the second day, just after breakfast, we went to Buda. Buda is the western part of Budapest located on the right bank of the River Danube.\n\nUnlike Pest, which is a flat region, Buda is full of hills but it’s where you find most of the city’s main attractions, such as the Buda Castle, the Citadel, the Fisherman’s Bastion, and the Matias Church.\n\nWe took the M2 metro line at the Kossuth Lajos Tér station and went to Déli Pályaudvar. This seemed to be the most convenient way to explore Buda. From the map, we thought we wouldn’t have to go up the hills of Buda to get to the attractions.\n\nMy mistake! We just reached the other side of the hill. Still, unless we had taken a taxi or uber, it was the most convenient way to get to the attractions.\n\nHospital in the Rock – Nuclear Bunker\n\nSoon after we crossed Vérmezö Park, we started to climb the stairs. We went up two flights of stairs until we reached the Hospital in the Rock – Nuclear Bunker.\n\nThis discovery was worth it: the hospital is simply amazing! Be sure to include this attraction in your itineraries!\n\nThe visit is guided. The complete tours last about one hour and cover World War II hospital and the nuclear bunker created at cold war times. Unfortunately, it’s not possible to take pictures during the visit. The internal temperature is approximately 15°C, so it is highly recommended to bring warm clothing or take the blankets that are lent to visitors free of charge.\n\nThe hospital was built in the 1930s, taking advantage of the natural caves located below the Castle. The system of natural caves was reinforced and converted into a refuge against air attacks at the beginning of World War II. Only later it became a middle aid post and a hospital for surgical emergencies.\n\nIts use as a hospital was more intense during the Siege of Budapest (1944-1945). The hospital, sized for 60-70 patients, had up to 600 wounded soldiers. There was a shortage of medicines, food, water in certain periods and it’s interesting to see the effort of doctors and nurses to try to get around this problem.\n\nThere were reports that doctors/nurses left the underground hospital to collect snow outside and make water. Supplies were reused that were taken from dead patients and sterilized for use in new patients.\n\nAfter World War II, the hospital was used again only during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution: a popular revolt against the policies of the Hungarian People’s Republic and the Soviet Union. During this period, revolutionaries, civilians, and victims of Soviet troops were all treated at the hospital.\n\nFrom 1960, at the height of the Cold War, the hospital was expanded to become Hungary’s only secret nuclear bunker. I’m glad it didn’t have to be used for this function!\n\nThe visitor will be able to see the equipment, instruments, beds, surgical centers, all original, and some can still be used. Too bad it is not possible to take pictures inside.\n\nMilitary History Museum\n\nAfter the Hospital in the Rock, we went to visit the Military History Museum.\n\nIt’s a large museum that displays clothes, weapons, uniforms, and exhibitions related to the country’s military history. There was even a specific exhibition on Hungary’s participation in World War I (1914-1919).\n\nUnfortunately, almost all the information was exclusively in Hungarian, very little in English, which makes it a little uninteresting for foreigners. For Hungarians, I imagine it must be exceptional!\n\nTower of the Church of Mary Magdalene\n\nWe left the museum, passed the Tower of the Church of Mary Magdalene. The Franciscan church was built in the 13th century but was severely destroyed in World War II. Only the tower has been restored.\n\nThe tower is visible from below in the Vérmezö Park.\n\nFisherman’s Bastion\n\nThe Fisherman’s Bastion (Halaszbastya) is a terrace located in Buda that offers a panoramic view of the city, including the Danube River, its bridges, and the Hungarian Parliament. It is considered one of the main attractions of Budapest according to Tripadvisor.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the region below the Bastion was inhabited by fishermen, who sold the fishery product in the square in front of the Matias Church. The fishermen’s alliance was responsible for defending the walls that were in the place of the current viewing towers.\n\nThe current structure was built in the 19th century (1895-1902) to commemorate the 1000th anniversary of the founding of the Hungarian state. The 7 towers honor the 7 leaders of the tribes who founded Hungary in 895 DC. On the terrace, there is also a restaurant.\n\nThe Bastion is next to Matias Church. The Church, the Church Tower, and the Fisherman’s Bastion are open for visitors. Tickets are sold at a ticket window in front of the attractions.\n\nIn front of the church, there’s a statue of King Saint Stephen, who was the first King of Hungary, as we said earlier.\n\nBut we decided to visit only the Fisherman’s Bastion.\n\nSzéchenyi Lánchíd Bridge\n\nWe went down Hunyadi János street towards the Széchenyi Lánchíd Bridge over the Danube River and came back to the hotel.\n\nThis beautiful bridge, used by cars and pedestrians, is one of Budapest’s postcards.\n\nVendetta Italian Restaurant\n\nIn the evening, we had dinner at the Italian restaurant Vendetta – Pasta e Basta, also in central Budapest (District V). I had bruschetta and spinach risotto. It was delicious, but I didn’t really like the service.\n\nDay 3\n\nHeroes’ Square\n\nOn the third day, we went to the Heroes’ Square area. To get there, just get off at the Hösok Tere metro station (line M1). The Heroes’ Square is located between the Museum of Fine Arts (Museum of Fine Arts) and the Art Hall.\n\nIt contains a semi-circular monument with bronze statues of 7 famous characters from Hungarian history on each side. In the center, there is a pillar with a statue of the archangel Gabriel.\n\nCity Park\n\nBehind the square, there is an immense city park, with several attractions, including:\n\na lake with pedal boats;\n\nthe Vajdahunyad Castle, which houses the Hungarian Agriculture Museum (the largest agricultural museum in Europe);\n\nthe Budapest Zoo;\n\nthe thermal baths of Széchnyi;\n\nthe transport museum.\n\nHouse of Terror\n\nAfter visiting City Park, we walked to the House of Terror (Terror Háza).\n\nThe museum tells the story of Hungary’s communist regime, which has lasted since the end of World War II until the political transition in 1989. It features films, exhibitions, documents, prisoners’ cells, and equipment that reveal the repression of political dissidents by the Soviet-influenced dictatorial regime.\n\nIt is worth remembering that Hungary suffered double occupation in World War II (Nazis and Soviets), which is remembered at the museum’s entrance.\n\nAt the entrance, there is a war tank accompanied by photos of victims of the communist regime.\n\nThe ticket price is expensive (2,000 HUF). It is recommended to rent an audiovisual guide, as the museum does not have much information in English (except for some brochures that are available in each room). A negative point is that some rooms/clothes have a musty smell.\n\nFrom there, we walked to the Hotel.\n\nKizpiac Bisztró\n\nIn the evening, we went to dinner at a typical Hungarian restaurant nearby, Kizpiac Bisztró, with excellent service and great local food. We tried the ½ grilled duck. Delicious and well priced. I recommend!\n\nShoes on the Danube Promenade Memorial\n\nLeaving the restaurant, we made a quick trip along the banks of the Danube River, in Pest, to visit the “Shoes on the Danube” memorial (Cipők a Duna-parton), which is just a few meters from Parliament. There are 60 pairs of bronze shoes, in the style of the 1940s, that honor those who were killed by the Nazi-Hungarians.\n\nThey were forced to remove their shoes, they were machine-gunned or shot in the back of the neck and their bodies fell into the Danube River being carried away by the river current.\n\n.\n\nDay 4\n\nTime to go! We took a taxi to Budapest airport, which is far from the center. It takes approximately 30 minutes without traffic. We spent 7,500 Hungarian florins.\n\nTip: After 8 am in the morning, it might take at least one hour to get to the airport. Consider it and depart a little bit earlier from your hotel.\n\nBottom line\n\nBudapest turned out to be a good, beautiful, and cheap city by European standards. The city has a good transport system (subway, bus, and tram) and much of the city is pedestrian-friendly (especially in the Pest region, which is flat). Contrary to what I was told, many people speak English in the city, at least, enough for basic day-to-day communication.\n\nThree days weren’t enough to enjoy all the attractions of this incredible city. Let’s go back!\n\nCheck out all our English Posts, click here.\n\nThe Porsche Museum is an automotive museum situated at Porsche’s headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany. If you’re passionate about sports cars, consider including it in your travel itinerary.\n\nOpened in 2009, the Porsche Museum has a futuristic architectural concept in which the building is only supported by 3 V-shaped columns, that makes the structure appear to float like a monolith. A beautiful glass facade also stands out.\n\nAt Porscheplatz, a small roundabout in front of the museum, a three-pillar V-shaped sculpture is eye-catching. Each V-shaped pillar has a Porsche 911 vehicle at the top.\n\nHistory of Ferdinand Porsche and his company\n\nIt is impossible to speak of Porsche without talking about its founder, Ferdinand Porsche. He was an automobile engineer known for his innovative designs, but whose Nazi past ended up obscuring his genius.\n\nFerdinand Porsche was born in Bohemia in 1875. He was the son of a master panel-beater. At the time, the city where he was born (currently Vratislavice nad Nisou in the Czech Republic) belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. From an early age, Ferdinand demonstrated a great aptitude for mechanical work. He started taking classes at the Imperial Technical School while helping his father at night (source: Wikipedia).\n\nAt the age of 18, Porsche moved to Vienna, where he took on a job at Vereinigten Elektrizitäts AG. In that company, he developed the famous electric wheel hub motor. In 1899, Porsche went to the Lohner factory, at the time Austria’s largest coach manufacturer. There, he designed the world’s first hybrid car and also the world’s first all-wheel-drive vehicle. In 1906, Porsche left Lohner to work as chief designer for Austro-Daimler in Wiener Neustadt (source: Porsche.com).\n\nIn 1909, his son “Ferry” Porsche was born. In the future, Ferry helped him to found Porsche GmbH and after World War II he took over the company.\n\nAfter World War I, with the Austro-Hungarian Empire dissolution, Porsche assumed Czechoslovak nationality.\n\nIn 1923, he went to Stuttgart, which was already an important automobile center in Germany. In 1931, he founded Porsche GmbH. At first, the company provided design and consulting services for motors and vehicles. Its engineering office was located on Kronenstraße 24, in Stuttgart’s city center, very close to the Main Train Station (Hauptbahnhof). The building is still there.\n\nThere, he worked with 20 employees and his son Ferry. During this period, Porsche started to provide services to several other companies, such as Wanderer, Zündapp, and NSU. There were no vehicles with the Porsche brand yet.\n\nFerdinand Porsche and Nazism\n\nIn 1933, Adolf Hitler wanted to create the “people’s car” (Volkswagen), popularizing access to motor vehicles in Germany. Ferdinand Porsche, who was considered by the Nazis to be a “great German engineer” took over the project.\n\nHowever, Hitler considered the Czechs “subhuman”. In 1934, Porsche abdicated Czechoslovakian nationality and applied for German citizenship. Later then, Porsche joined the Nazi party in 1937 and became an SS-officer reaching the rank of SS-Öberführer (source: Wikipedia).\n\nAs for the people’s car, Hitler wanted a basic vehicle that could transport two adults and three children at 100 km/h (62 mph) without using more than 7 liters (1,82 gallons) of fuel per 100 km (62 miles). The Kdf-Wagen (later known as Käfer) was designed but production started only in 1938 with the construction of the Volkswagen plant in Fallersleben (currently Wolfsburg). By the way, the picture of Ferdinand Porsche alongside Hitler on Volkswagen’s foundation (1938) is very famous.\n\nIn 1938, the Porsche company moved to Zuffenhausen, district of Stuttgart, where it remains until today.\n\nDuring World War II, Porsche was responsible for the design and construction of war tanks. His factory was bombed by the Allies. As a result, in 1944, Porsche relocated its company to Gmünd in Austria.\n\nThe forced labor at the Porsche factory during Nazism\n\nDuring World War II, the Porsche company made use of forced labor by foreigners of various nationalities. Polish Jan Karolczak started working at the company at age 21 and told his story to Spiegel Magazine (Source: Nils Klawitter, The Dark Pre-History of the World’s Favorite Sports Car).\n\nHis city, Krotoszyn, Poland, was occupied by the Nazis during the war. In February 1942, he received an order from the German employment service designating him to work. He went to Stuttgart with 20 other Poles to work for the Porsche Company.\n\nKarolczak says he slept in a cold and dirty building and spent his days assembling crankshafts. As a salary, he received only 60 marks per month. Workers were supposed to wear a “P” on their clothes but that letter didn’t mean Porsche but Polish. Because of this sign, they were not admitted to places such as movie theaters or even air raid shelters.\n\nBy the way, during the Allied air bombing raids, foreign workers were forced to stay at the factory so that, should there be a fire, they would be ready to put it out. In this case, they received only 1.5 marks as a reward. Karolczak recalls there were forced workers of various nationalities: Dutch, Moroccans, French, Italians, and even Russian women.\n\nAfter World War II\n\nAfter World War II, Porsche went to France, where he was arrested along with his children, accused of war crimes. His son Ferry was released after 6 months, but Ferdinand remained in prison until 1948.\n\nIn that period, Ferry took over the company and launched the first vehicle with the official Porsche emblem. It was the Porsche 356, produced in Gmünd, Austria. He returned to Zuffenhausen only in 1950.\n\nFerdinand died in 1951. Since then, the company has grown to become one of the world’s leading sports car producers. Currently, Porsche AG is a corporation that is part of the Volkswagen group. Porsche AG has 35,000 employees and produces 280,000 cars a year.\n\nMuseum Exposition and Structure\n\nThe Porsche Museum has an exhibition space of 5,600 m2. The museum consists of two floors and two mezzanines. In addition to the exhibition, the building has a restaurant, a cafeteria, a souvenir shop, and underground parking lot.\n\nThe exhibition shows a little about Ferdinand Porsche’s history, from the development of the first cars to the current ones. There are more than 80 vehicles on display that include vintage cars, competition vehicles (especially Formula 2 and Le Mans), tractors, SUVs, and even police cars. But, what the visitor will find most are sports cars. Some of them are incredibly beautiful! Check out, for example, the Porsche 918 Spyder (cover photo).\n\nFor each vehicle exposed, there is a plate containing technical information such as year of manufacture, type of engine, speed, and power.\n\nIn addition to the vehicles, there are some spaces of interaction for visitors, such as accelerators, buttons for starting vehicles, two simulators, and some vehicles where you may take a seat.\n\nRecently, a Touch Wall was also installed in the Porsche Museum. It’s a 12-meter-long touchable screen where visitors can see more than 3,000 photographs, drawings, posters and advertisements related to Porsche, allowing the visitor to take a journey through time.\n\nRight at the entrance, the visitor takes an immense escalator that allows him to have a panoramic view of the museum. The exhibition is divided into the sectors below, each highlighting some characteristics or qualities of the Porsche brand.\n\nPrologue\n\nThe Prologue sector is dedicated to presenting the milestones of Ferdinand Porsche’s life. Vehicles designed by Porsche but produced by other companies are exhibited, such as the Beetle (Käfer), the Austro-Daimler ADR Bergmeister and the Egger-Lohner-Elektromobil – P1.\n\nThe electric vehicle “Egger-Lohner C.2” is considered the first produced by Ferdinand Porsche. It drove through the streets of Vienna for the first time on June 26, 1898. It was known internally as “P1”.\n\nLight\n\nThe Light sector highlights the relationship between vehicle weight and power.\n\nClever\n\nThe Clever sector seeks to highlight the intelligent solutions adopted by Porsche and its technological challenges.\n\nFast\n\nThe fast sector highlights the speed of Porsche racing vehicles, including aerodynamics and control. An inverted vehicle illustrates that under a speed of 320 km/h (198 mph) the car can, in theory, take off.\n\nPowerful\n\nThe Powerful sector highlights Porsche’s high-performance engines.\n\nConsistent\n\nThe Consistent sector highlights Porsche’s consistent line of vehicles, such as the 911, passing from generation to generation.\n\nSound Showers\n\nThe Sound Showers sector contains spaces of interaction designed to simulate the sounds of different engines.\n\nSpecial Tours\n\nBesides visiting the Porsche Museum on your own, you also have many kinds of guided tours, including factory tours.

To get there, you can get off at the S-Bahn station Neuwirtshaus (Porscheplatz) using lines S6 or S60, which is next to the museum.\n\nBy metro, the nearest station is Salzwiesenstraße (U15). Getting off at that station, just take a 12-minute walk (950 meters) down the Strohgäustraße to the museum.\n\nAs I was staying in a Zuffenhausen hotel, I went to the museum on foot.\n\nOpening hours\n\nThe museum is open from 9 am to 6 pm, from Tuesday to Sunday. The last entry takes place at 5:30 pm. The museum is usually open on holidays, except Christmas and New Year.\n\nTickets\n\nThe entrance costs 9.70 Euros for adults and 4.80 Euros for students, retirees, unemployed and people with special needs.

However, for laypeople, as is my case, I have sincere doubts.\n\nThe cars are exposed but without much explanation about their design, manufacture or development. The signs next to each vehicle contained only some technical information which makes the visitation even a little boring. I confess that I learned very little when visiting the Porsche Museum.\n\nThe museum structure shows that it’s more dedicated to promoting the Porsche brand than bringing some knowledge to visitors. There is also no well-defined visitation itinerary.\n\nFurthermore, the museum is not as interactive as it promises. There are few interactive stations and activities, with rare exceptions, are somewhat dull (eg, listening to a roar of the engine).\n\nAn important criticism of the museum is the lack of a mea-culpa for the company’s role during Nazism. According to Nils Klawitter (op. cit.), unlike Volkswagen, which allowed an investigation into forced labor during the Nazi era (click here to read the report), Porsche preferred to remain silent on that matter. The company usually minimizes the number of people forced to work at its factories.\n\nTourists who visited the Mercedes Benz Museum in Stuttgart ended up preferring it over the Porsche Museum. But it’s up to you!\n\nIf you liked this article, check out all our English posts!"
