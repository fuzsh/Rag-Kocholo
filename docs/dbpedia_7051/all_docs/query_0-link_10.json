        "text": "1932\n\nNeubauer had, by 1932, spent almost 14 years with Mercedes-Benz, longer if you include his Daimler-Benz connections through Austro-Daimler, and he was a company man. Motor racing was deeply ingrained in him by now though and with Mercedes having abandoned their racing programme a situation arose that almost saw Neubauer reunite with his old friend Ferdinand Porsche; at Auto Union!\n\nThe stories that surround this are contradictory, but it is tantalising to wonder what might have happened if Neubauer had ended up working with Porsche and Bernd Rosemeyer instead of being at Mercedes during that period of the 1930s when the German firms dominated Grand Prix motor racing. Certainly Neubauer must have been bored to distraction, sitting at a desk deprived of his “toys”. So when Auto Union's Manager Baron Claus Detlof von Oertzen offered Neubauer a contract to be Auto Union racing team-manager in November 1932 he was inclined to accept it, some even attest that he did indeed sign the said contract. It would have been amazing if this man with who had Mercedes running through his bones like the letters in a stick of rock had actually done so.\n\nIt is known for certain that AutoUnion was searching for a new team-manger at the time and approached both Neubauer and Willy Walb; Mercedes men well known to Porsche, who was designing the P-Wagen for AutoUnion, from his time with Mercedes-Benz. According to Neubauer he even wrote a letter of resignation to Daimler-Benz the evening after his meeting with Klaus von Oertzen (managing director of Auto Union). He goes on to say that :-\n\n“24 hours later Dr. Kissel, our Managing Director, asked me to go and see him. He came towards me as soon as I opened the door of his office, an anxious look on his face. 'My dear Neubauer,' he said, almost pushing me into a vast leather armchair.\n\n'What in heaven's name has come over you? You're not seriously thinking of leaving us.'\n\n'I'm afraid so,' I muttered.\n\n'But why? What's the matter?'\n\nMy eyes wandered for a moment to the picture that hung behind Kissel's desk. It was a portrait not of President von Hindenburg or of Kaiser Wilhelm but of Rudi Caracciola. 'It's racing that's the matter,' I said. 'I'm only half-alive without it, an office desk doesn't suit me.'\n\nDr. Kissel gave me a long, earnest look. 'You shall have your racing,' he said solemnly. 'I promise you that, while I have any say here, we'll be building racing-cars again, as soon as it's economically possible.' My heart lifted. Then I realized with a shock of alarm that I had already signed a provisional contract with the Auto-Union.\n\n'Let me see it,' said Kissel.\n\nHe read through it quickly. When he saw the salary they were offering me he raised his eyebrows. Then he folded the document carefully. 'Please leave this with me,' he said. 'I'll arrange it somehow. As for your salary, you can earn as much with us as the Auto-Union have offered-and a bit more. As from today.' I was lucky. I could at least afford to wait till motor racing became economically possible' again.\n\nIn practice the reserve driver, Christian Kautz, had ignored an ‘In’ sign and crashed on the extra lap. Neubauer reprimanded Kautz in no uncertain terms, setting his usual precedents for discipline. Little did he know his more senior drivers would flout his orders to a much greater, and more public, extent in the race itself.\n\nOn the 8th of August Auto Union’s only real hope in the GP lay with Bernd Rosemeyer. When he crashed into in the sandbags at the Gasworks Hairpin, before even 20 of the 100 laps had been completed, the stage was set for the Mercedes fraternity battle. Caracciola and Von Brauchitsch would now exploit all the performance advantage of Rudi Uhlenhaut’s W125 design and fight it out for the victory.\n\nIn Neubauers mind nothing could be allowed to interfere with the smooth running of the team and everyone should dutifully play their part for the best 'Team' result. With von Brauchitsch leading Neubauer waved his flags to order Manfred to let the Team leader (and Neubauer's favourite) through for the win. Von Brauchitsch increased his pace!\n\nMonaco was already a circuit deemed unsuitable for 1200bhp GP cars, yet Neubauer, risking life (or more possibly limb), took to the track to wave his flag and restore team order. Manfred von Brauchitsch continued to ignore him and the pair thundered past Neuubauer side-by-side. Motor Sport magazine would later report that :- “Von Brauchitsch was driving superbly and seemed to be putting more effort into his work than all the others.”\n\nEventually von Brauchitsch did acknowledge Neubauer’s message; he looked at Neubauer and stuck his tongue out! Ten laps of all-out war ensued on track, Rudi Caracciola twice attempting to slither down the inside of von Brauchitsch at Sainte Dévote only to be beaten back by von Brauchitsch's devil-may-care defence. The emotional von Brauchitsch tended to race for the moment, Caracciola was more conservative nursing his tyres, ekeeing out mpg and as a result won more races. But now the pressure was on him\n\nThe pressure finally told when Caracciola’s engine went off song midway through the race. He spent 3min 15sec in the pits for a new set of spark plugs added to the usual refuel and new rear tyres, Von Brauchitsch now led by a lap. Caracciola was now fired up and on lap 76 set a fastest lap almost 12sec faster than the 1935 race (1936 being incomparably due rain). He closed in on Manfred who, confident of success, happily waved Caracciola back onto the lead lap. As pride often comes before a fall von Brauchitsch next went horribly wrong, while reports say a front brake jammed on the furious Manfred insisted that the meddlesome Neubauer had deliberately hampered his stop. Whatever the truth von Brauchitsch re-emerge from the pits with only a slender lead over the charging Rudi Caracciola.\n\nOn lap 80 Caracciola passed von Brauchitsch when Manfred handed Rudi the crown of the road and let him pass. Whether Manfred had a change of heart and decided to stay on Neubauer's good side, or whether this was a tactical trick, is debated widely but as Caracciola pitted just two laps later the cars positions were reversed putting von Brauchitsch back in the lead.\n\nAt the finish the Mercedes team could finally relax. Von Brauchitsch took a rare victory and all the desperate racing had not robbed the team of a certain one-two. Manfred von Brauchitsch and second-placed Rudi Caracciola were all smiles on the podium, even though reserve driver Kautz grabbed an excellent third place Neubauer remained annoyed with von Brauchitsch.\n\n1938\n\n1938 was one of those times when the powers that be exercised their right to curb the power of the racing machines. Keeping the speed of the highest level racing machines in check has been a recurring problem since the earliest days of organised motor racing and it continues to this day. The 750kg formula gave way to an engine size formula in which supercharged engines from 666cc to 3000cc were pitted against normally aspirated engines between 1000cc and 4500cc. The cars weight was dependent upon it's engine capacity following a linear scale between 400kg and 850kg.\n\nThe Untertürkheim engineers developed a new package that was instantly as fast as their previous 750kg car, the W163 used it's 480hp engine to hit a maximum top speed of 400kph, and the competition organising bodies plan to reduce dangerous racing speeds was blown away before it began. Mercedes would win 13 Grand Prix in the season and a half up to the outbreak of World War two. But more than that the ongoing speed record battle with Auto-Union continued unabated.\n\nDaimler-Benz came up with a radical new speed record design to rival those designed for Auto-Union by the great Ferdinand Porsche and Neubauer's organisational skills were the guiding force behind the whole adventure. The new car was revolutionary in having what we now call ground effects. In short the ground clearance was so small a vacuum was created under the car and helped it gain grip and stability. However no one should think that Neubauer's corporate ambition would have him gamble with the life or death of his drivers and at this time when power exceeded grip Neubauer's ethical standing reached its actual limits on the 28th of January, 1938.\n\nDuring speed runs on a closed section of the Frankfurt - Darmstadt autobhan Rudolf Caracciola set a fastest time in the Mercedes-Benz of 432kph. Caracciola described the incident as follows:-\n\nHe (Neubauer) says: \"'Will you really not try again?' 'No' 'I (Caracciola) say.' 'And why not'?' urged Neubauer 'It is too windy on the track and it has still frost on the left. 'Neubauer comes very close to me.' 'In an hour Rosemeyer will appear here', \"he says emphatically. '' He wants to try to get your record again ... '\n\n\"It is a shock for a moment, I see! '” Like a picture in front of me. Two steel armored prehistoric animals that race against each other until one has to leave the track' “No, I do not go', I say.\"\n\nAn hour later, the blonde-National Hero Bernd Rosemeyer achieved on the record car of the Auto Union at the first attempt nearly 430 hours kilometers. At the second attempt, he was on a short section of the course, and without the slope or trees was left to side wind, caught by a squall. Thus ended the life of Bernd Rosemeyer.\n\nThe 1939 season started with the usual early races held in April. First the popular round the houses race that took place in Pau, France, where Hermann Lang won it for Mercedes. Next up was the much vaunted Tripoli GP held on the 7th of May.\n\nLike many others the Italians were fed up of the Germans winning all the Grand Prix so they hit on the idea of holding the Tripoli GP under voiturette regulations knowing that Mercedes-Benz did not have a voiturette car with which to compete. Italy was doing very well in this category with both Maserati and Alfa-Romeo having winning cars available. Neubauer saw this as a deliberate attempt to shut Mercedes out of the race and duly ensured the Daimler-Benz Board were outraged by the perceived snub. Neubauer had actually know about this rule change situation since the 1938 Italian GP (the 11th September, 1938, to be precise), when the president of the Italian sports federation told him the news with what Neubauer later described as a \"honey sweet smile\". The special meeting of the Daimler-Benz Board was held 4 days later and 3 days after that Neubauer had the permission he needed to set up a secret project tasked to produce three 1½ ltr cars that could compete in the Tripoli GP; they even had permission to work 24hrs a day if required!\n\nOne can only guess the consternation felt by the organisers when they received the official entry from Mercedes for a two car team at the race. It is known that there were a lot of telegrams sent back and forth while the organisers confirmed that Daimler-Benz understood the rules and that the would actually have two eligible cars at the race on time.\n\nThis was actually a fair point in that the development period of a top flight racing car can be several years in the process, in this case Mercedes-Benz designed, tested and produced two new cars in just eight months. Caracciola's car was actually tested at Hockenheim prior to embarkation to North Africa but Lang's car was finished on the ship on the trip across the Med'. Actually the two cars were different but mostly in the ranges of what we today call “set up”. Caracciola's was set up for higher acceleration and had 15.5mm torsion bars and quick steering ratio. Lang's was engineered towards higher top speed, had 16mm torsion bars and a slower steering ratio. To tell the cars apart on the race track Caracciola's car was identifiable by a white ring around the radiator while Lang's car featured a dark blue one.\n\nPre-race practice saw Neubauer busy smoothing some feathers and ruffling others. Villonesi set fastest time on Friday and no one could beat it in the Saturday sessions leaving the Mercedes team in crisis. Neubauer, worried about the 52 degree track temperatures, sent Lang out to do some fast laps to scrub a set of tyres so they could stand up to the race temperatures and last that bit longer. Caracciola saw Lang go out and lost his temper with Neubauer. Insisting he was the number one driver and angry at what he saw as Neubauer trying to fix Lang in front of him on the grid he promptly turned around and walked off screaming he had had enough. At that point Neubauer realized Lang had disappeared too. He found Lang comforting his distraught wife in a palm grove behind the pits, she had reached the limit of her patience with Caracciola's jealousy and demanded Lang never race with him again; and Lang agreed. Her anger extended to Neubauer too and recognising the situation Neubauer deferred to Mercedes' director Max Sailer who managed at least to persuade Lang to continue driving. Lang went back out and set the fastest time of the day 3m42.35s and put himself second on the grid. However, the troubles resurfaced when Neubauer revealed his race tactics at a meeting of the Mercedes team held that evening. His plan was to send Lang off at full speed on the scrubbed tyres and break the opposition. Caracciola, on new tyres, was to take it easy and do a short pit stop just for fuel capitalising on the oppositions mechanical failures. Caracciola then thought Neubauer was planning to put Lang out of reach and demanded scrubbed tyres too. Neubauer then lost his temper, there were no more scrubbed tyres and carried on to remind Caracciola that it was his own fault he didn't have a set of scrubbed tyres as he had walked out on the session. Once again it fell to Max Sailer to calm things down and remind both drivers they were responsible for ensuring eight months of work in the factory had not been in vain.\n\nOn the 7th of May 1939 the Tripoli GP was almost ready to run when Lang realised the starting procedure was confusing. Oddly the event was to be started both by lights and by Marshal Balbo waving a flag. He asked Neubauer which was the official system and for once Neubauer didn't have the answer. He rushed away to find out and reappeared frantically pointing to the lights. As everyone else was looking at Marshal Balbo's flag when the lights changed Lang made \"his best start ever\". The flag fell a second or so later and off went the others amidst screams of false start and other protests from the Alfa Corse team. Neubauer's reply, as if he had known all along, “Just blame yourselves for not knowing the rules”.\n\nAt the finish line the Mercedes W165 cars took fist and second places. Lang had been in a position to actually lap Caracciola but decided, perhaps wisely, not too. Neubauer stood by smiling as the Italians astonishment gave way to bitterness. The two cars, built in just eight months, went back in their boxes and were never raced again. They ended up sitting out World War Two in Switzerland titled as the private property of Rudolf Caracciola, but after the war they were confiscated by the Allies as enemy property. I'm sure the Italians felt the same way, and would have loved to do the same, when the wheels stopped turning at Mellaha. For the record Lang won from Caracciola, which can't have sat well with Carraciola.\n\nWhen the GP des Frontières came around on the 25th of May Bugatti once again took the honours, this time in the hands of Maurice Trintignant but more upsetting for Mercedes was the fact that Hans Stuck took an AutoUnion to victory in the Bucharest GP that same day. Mercedes spirits were lifted at the Kahlenberg hillclimb in Austria on the 11th of June 1939 when Lang won the event.\n\nThen came Spa Francorchamps and the Belgian GP held on the 26th of June 1939. This was to be a torrid affair, not just because the weather kept raining on parts of the track and leaving the drivers to work out the safe braking distances and lines at every corner on every lap but also because the spray made visibility almost impossible and it hung in the trees like fog in many places. Lang battled with Müller for many laps before waving Caracciola and Seaman through to try their luck at passing the obstinate AutoUnion. Caracciola spun off at La Source while trying to overtake Müller and after many laps trying Seaman passed the AutoUnion to take the lead just as Müller slowed to go into the pits. From that point on Seaman went faster and faster pulling away from everyone else.\n\nOn lap 22 Seaman pushed too hard at club corner and span off the track. The tail of his car hit a tree which sent him into a second tree at full broadside. The car hit the tree at the cockpit area and the car bent around the tree causing injury to the driver and knocking him out. This might have been survivable but for the saddle fuel tank hose rupturing and gushing fuel out to not only soak Seaman but to splash onto hot exhaust pipes which ignited the fuel immediately. Seaman was sat in the flaming inferno for around thirty seconds before marshals from the La Source hairpin arrived to release the steering wheel locking mechanism and pull Seaman out of the car. The British driver suffered third degree burns across much of his body and died later in hospital.\n\nLang saw what had happened to his team mate and stopped briefly to inform the team. He himself was badly shaken by what he had seen and would rather have not continued to race. Neubauer dispatched Mercedes team doctors to do what they could for Seaman and Lang returned to the fray. He won the race for Mercedes but the celebrations were muted. That evening there was no Mercedes team party, most of them went to the hospital to see Dick Seaman. He did recover consciousness enough to speak in English and in German to his wife, and to explain the circumstances of his accident to Neubauer; he had been at fault he said, not the car. Seaman lapsed back into unconsciousness and passed away shortly after midnight.\n\nNeubauer was one of many who were deeply affected by the tragedy. The Ardennes would be a deadly access point for Germany when World War Two kicked off in earnest but here and now it had already claimed one of Britain's brightest young men, the ironies can't be missed that he was driving a Germany car and that Germans wept for him. That night Neubauer made his usual small but touching annotation in his diary; “Seaman †”. He must have pondered on the fact that the last fatal incident for the team had been at AVUS 1933 when Otto Merz lost his life; 6 years was a long time between incidents in the motor racing world of that time.\n\nAt the next race, the 1st GP des Remparts Angoulême on the 2nd of July, Raymond Sommer won for Alfa-Romeo. It was a non-championship race and new to the calender so neither Mercedes or AutoUnion were in attendance. One doubts that either German team would have raced their anyway as the twisty circuit might not have suited their cars. At least the other teams got a chance for a race win.\n\nJust a few weeks later at the French GP at Reims-Gueux, 9th of July, Hermann Paul Müller won the Championship event for Auto-Union followed home by Georg Meier in another AutoUnion and their third car came home 6th in the hands of Hans Stuck . This should have been a battle Royale but things didn't work out that way. Mercedes were reeling from the loss of Seaman and here Caracciola was put out of the race by an accident and both remaining cars went out of the race with engine failure. But Neubauer had everything back under control for the German GP back at the Nurburgring.\n\nThe Nürburgring is still Germany's most famous circuit and pre-war it was just as important to Mercedes and AutoUnion as it was to the Nazis. Alfred Neubauer knew this importance and wanted Mercedes back in the winning circle. It started well enough with Lang being unapproachable on track and taking Pole position. He had even beaten Rosemeyer's pole time from 1937 with a 9m43.1s lap. But AutoUnion were making a fight of it. Neubauer had watched Nuvolari consistently setting exactly ten minute laps and worked out that the AutoUnions could go ten laps before changing tyres, thus his Mercedes drivers would have to drive at least 7 seconds a lap quicker for ten laps in order to compensate for the 60 seconds it took for a pit stop. He set about coaching his team for the task. He sent them out to lap as quickly as possible and check on the tyre wear, Lang managed four laps before needing new tyres, von Brauchitsch and Caracciola could manage 6 laps. Mercedes took all three front row places on the grid with Lang, Von Brauchitsch and Caracciola in that order. The start didn't go to plan though and it was a race made all the more difficult by wet and dry areas around different parts of the circuit, Lang suffered engine failure having already stopped once for a plug change. Paul Pietsch took the lead from Lang after his early pit stop, much to the consternation of the crowd. Certainly Pietsch was a German, but he was driving a Maserati 8CTF for the Italian team! It didn't last too long though and German order resumed when Nuvolari took the lead in his AutoUnion. It looked like AutoUnion's day for a while as Mercedes cars fell by the wayside; von Brauchitsch retired with a leaking fuel tank and Heinz Brendel had an accident. Nuvolari fell away and the other AutoUnions all stopped bar Hermann Paul Müller who came in second to a thundering Caracciola in the last remaining Mercedes. Neubauers tyre plan strategy and Caracciola's supreme wet weather driving skills paid dividends giving the veteran German his last, and 6th, victory in the Großer Preis von Deutschland. So all's well that ends well.... not quite, after the race Rudolf Uhlenhaut went over Langs car with his team of engineers and could find nothing wrong with it.\n\nThe next race held was the Yugoslav GP, at Belgrade, on the 3rd of September 1939, two days after military hostilities started in Europe. Mercedes had started their journey to the race on the 25th of August with their own enormous fuel tanker as a precaution in case of having to get back home under their own power. After 1400km of driving the team started preparations for the race, amidst ever growing worries about the war. Manfred von Brauchitsch and Hermann Lang were driving for Mercedes, Tazio Nuvolari and Hermann Paul Müller drove for AutoUnion. Von Brauchitsch had arrived by air via Belgrade airport on the 30th of August and made his first journey around the track to inspect the conditions. Tram lines and cobble stones meant he was not impressed. When practice around the 3km course finished that evening, of the three drivers who did venture out it was Lang who was fastest. Everyone was aware of looming war and on the streets of Belgrade the feeling was so tense that the Germany drivers stayed within the confines of their hotel, forgoing their normal tourist style activities. Early on the 1st of September every one woke to the news of the German invasion of Poland. Lang even drove out of town and up a hill to get better radio reception to listen to the news.\n\nAfter much discussion the organisers decided the race should go on and they pleaded with the Silver Arrows to stay. As it happens it was not up to Alfred Neubauer or the AutoUnion officials to decide, Adolf Hühnlein of the Nazis motoring wing held sway on such things and in the interests of furthering German dominance ordered the Silver Arrows teams to remain and race. It was a good thing for the organisers as their losses without the attractions of the German cars could have been most considerable.\n\nFor qualifying only the four German cars made any impact. Nuvolari had only arrived the evening before and lacked track time so was slower than the others, even von Brauchitsch who was “still drunk from the previous evening\". Alfa-Romeo's cars never arrived and the British teams, who had been advised a month earlier by the Foreign office to avoid European travel had heeded the advice, so the field was extremely thin.\n\nIt was thinner still on race day when the news of the British declaration of war was made. Lang recalled that \"All of us lost every inclination to race but Neubauer returned from our embassy with the news we must keep calm and start.\" However, von Brauchitsch was nowhere to be found having departed for Belgrade Airport. He had bought a ticket for Vienna and was apparently sitting on the plane when a furious Neubauer caught up with him, hauled off the plane and dragged him back to the race. Only later did Neubauer find out that von Brauchitsch was heading for neutral Switzerland to stay with Rudolf Caracciola and not for Germany. Von Brauchitsch was a member of a military family and was certain to be compulsorily invited to join Hitler's war efforts, something he didn't agree with. Given Neubauer himself was not a lover of the Nazi's one can only wonder if his actions would have been different had he known Manfred was heading for a neutral destination. Neubauer himself did hint that:- \"I was the biggest bully bringing Manfred from the Aircraft. His deputy, Bäumer, would have raced straight home.\"\n\nIn the end just five cars took to the starting grid on the afternoon of the 3rd of September. The four German cars and an old 2.3-litre Bugatti T51 driven by local entry, Bosko Milenkovic. One wonders if Milenkovic might have been a late entry to help fill the grid as he did no practice or qualifying laps at all. The race started at 4.45pm in front of a crowd of between 75,000 and 100,000 people. Mercedes were 1st and second on the grid but it was the von Brauchitsch who took the lead with the others in their predictable positions following. Lang and von Brauchitsch started to battle each other for the lead much to Neubauer's concern. The Fight between the Mercedes was allowing the AutoUnion drivers to keep pace with them and Neubauer was soon giving signals for the two Mercedes drivers to hold position and race as a team. Much to Neubauers consternation the two drivers ignored him and continued to fight amongst themselves.\n\nDuring the 7th lap a stone was thrown up by von Brauchitsch' car and it went through Lang's windscreen and shattered both the lenses in his goggles. Lang described the incident as “Suddenly something hit me and everything went dark, [It] not only shattered my autoscreen but also both glasses in my goggles. My eyes were full of splinters\". With his eyes on fire and blood streaming down his face Lang got his car back to the pits. While the car was taken over by Walter Bäumer Mercedes doctors set to work removing the glass splinters from Lang's eyes.\n\nThe race just seemed to go down hill from there for Mercedes. On lap 16 von Brauchitsch spun and stalled and in his efforts to restart was narrowly missed by the ever superb Tazio Nuvolari as he sped by in his AutoUnion. When von Brauchitsch did get going he was soon harrying Bäumer in the other Mercedes which ended with Bäumer hitting the straw bales and going out of the race.\n\nThe second half of the race saw the harsh conditions starting to take their toll. Von Brauchitsch came into the pits with his tyres totally destroyed, soon after him the leader, Nuvolari pitted for the same reason. Milenkovic stopped for maintenance and had a lengthy stop because he couldn't get his radiator cap off. Eventually Nuvolari won by 7.6 seconds from von Brauchitsch with Müller a further 23 seconds back. Milenkovic was still trundling around at the end of the 50 lap race and was eventually flagged in to stop, 19 laps behind and counting. Von Brauchitsch was then disqualified for illegally moving opposite to the direction of travel after a spin.\n\nAs for the trophy presentations there was no real celebration. During the final laps the news that the French had declared war on Germany came though, now everyone just wanted to get home. Neubauer called this race excursion the greatest folly of his life. The Belgrade Grand Prix also fell victim to politics, it was all but airbrushed out of history by the communist government in Yugoslavia after the war. It was a race dominated by drivers from fascist countries and had involved King Peter II in the ceremonies, none of which sat well with the communists view of how history should be.\n\n1952\n\nRudolf Uhlenhaut was not only a remarkable engineer but a driver more than capable of holding his own against the teams actual racing drivers. This gave him a great insight into the developmental needs of a particular car. No surprise then that the 300SL took a relatively short time to produce or that it was so good when it hit the tracks. Under the leadership of Alfred Neubauer the \"Flugelturen\" or \"Gullwing\", designated the W194, went from original company agreement to build a new sports car, in June 1951, to Press presentation of the prototype car in March 1952. In time the Mercedes-Benz 300SL would take on legendary status, be the most successful sports car in the 3ltr class for 4 years and become a huge seller for Daimler-Benz.\n\nThe 1952 Mille Miglia was the first fanfare of a new era of “Silver Arrows”, and while Neubauer continually pressed Uhlenhaut for many mechanical and detail changes to the new cars, most were not implemented in time for the race on 4th of May. Neubauer did his part though, masterminding not only the logistics of getting the team to Brescia but also assembling a new organizational machine to ensure that during the race the cars were never too far from assistance.\n\nThe \"thousand miles\" of Brescia is a nerve-racking event on every level and given it was the first event for the new cars one might have thought “Don Alfredo” would be nervous too, but not a bit of it, Neubauer was in his element. Mercedes main competition would come from the Ferrari of Giovanni Bracco although Bracco wasn't an official Ferrari entrant. In fact Bracco's financial situation was so poor his budget didn't even stretch to spare tyres! Kling was leading at Roma as the rain fell because Bracco was hampered by tyre issues. In Florence Bracco was two minutes behind Karl Kling's Mercedes but he was swearing to his co-driver, Alfonso Rolfo, they “would be leading by the time they reached Bologna”. While Rolfo reputedly supplied Bracco with shots of brandy Bracco himself drove like a demon, and when the official Ferrari entries had all fallen out the Scuderia finally decided to lend a hand to Bracco. By Bologna Bracco was 1min' ahead of the #623 300sl of Kling and Klenk who had lost an agonizing 6min's due to a hub knock-off that needed excessive persuasion to undo. Unfortunately the #626 Mercedes of Lang and Grupp hit a roadside obstacle and was put out of the race with rear axle damage.\n\nOn the last leg into Brescia Bracco streatched his lead and finished four minutes ahead of Kling in 2nd place. Enzo Ferrari said Bracco's drive was \"the most spectacular success of all my racers\" and years later a German journalist wrote that “Kling never quite recovered from his Mille Miglia defeat at the hands of the hard drinking Bracco and his Ferrari”.\n\nNeedless to say Herr Neubauer was far from amused but he was happy for Rudi Caracciola who brought the #613 Mercedes 300sl home 4th in what has been described as masterful performance by the veteran. If 2nd and 4th were not acceptable to Neubauer it was promising and any thoughts of superiority Ferrari, or anyone else, had would soon be banished by the mighty silver machine that was Mercedes-Benz.\n\nGetting the “Rennabteilung” to Slivertone took a mammoth effort which started on the 9th of July. This task was first delayed by a day at the factory as only one of the two cars had completed it's ground up overhaul by the due date. Stripping a car and engine down to it's component parts, inspecting and replacing any worn items and getting it all back together is quite a task and with the French and British GPs being just two weeks apart and travel logistics of the 1950s were nothing like they are 60+ years later.\n\nNeubauer befriended road and air haulage companies, customs officials and the Mercedes-Benz agents in Britain to get his expedition smoothly through the journey. Inevitably there were delays getting the huge party through the British customs system not least because the party was bigger than that which was written on the paperwork. Paperwork that detailed the registration numbers of the four trucks (carrying the cars, spares and even workshop lathe, milling machines and all kinds of repair equipment) and the names of eight engineers and drivers, thirteen fitters and five accompanying persons. Given the time delays Neubauer decided any further parts or personnel should travel by air.\n\nAs usual Neubauer had all the details all worked out. Everyone new their roles and the lengths of each stage of the journey, where the team was staying each night and that carrying more than ten pounds sterling or equivalent exchangeable foreign money was inadvisable.\n\nThe big man himself drove Karl Kling to Silverstone in a car-caravan combination starting on Monday, July 12th. The Mercedes convoy arrived at \"Alcock ''s Garage\" in Brackley, some 15kms from the converted former U.S. Army airfield of Silverstone, on the Thursday of 15th of July. While the mechanics stayed in Brackley with the cars Neubauer, Fangio and Kling went on to meet the teams “brains trust” at their quarters in Waddesdon.\n\nThe route to the Silverstone circuit was lined with posters highlighting the “Mercedes Story\" and the press carried stories of the Reims 1-2 victory and the \"destruction of the pride of Italy\" but right from the first practice it was clear that the car was not suitable for the flat, twisty, circuit marked out only by grass verges and barrels. On the Thursday evening conversation, in a mixture of Italian and Spanish, revolved around Fangio's concerns about the problems positioning his car for the corners when he couldn't see his front wheels.\n\nProblems continued in Friday qualifying as it became clear the Mercedes RW196 was a real handful and even Fangio was having difficulties competing with the lighter open wheeled Ferraris. Fangio did take pole position by second from González in the Ferrari. Kling could only manage 6th on the grid, 3.1 sec's slower than Fangio's time.\n\nThat night the mechanics worked at \"Alcock's Garage\" not only to remove the damage caused by hitting the marker barrels but also to fit new exhausts that had been brought up from London by British Mercedes agents to give the cars more power.\n\n1955 Argentine GP\n\nThe first race of the season was the III Gran Premio de la Republica Argentina held at the permanent facility of the Autódromo Municipal Ciudad de Buenos Aires. As the F1 regulations went into their second season all the teams had been able to improve their machinery, Lancia's D50 looked impressive and performed similarly, Maserati further developed the 250F and Ferrari was working on both the Type 625 and the 553. Mike left Ferrari to drive for the Vanwall team and the driver field included three world champions (and one who would be champion a few years later).\n\nIn January the southern Hemisphere is in it's summer and the weather at the 2.431 mile circuit was depressingly hot. Mercedes entered four cars, Juan Manuel Fangio (car # 2), Karl Kling (car # 4), Stirling Moss ( #6), and Hans Herrmann (#8); but the chances of them all finishing were slim. At the end of qualifying the cars appeared to be quite evenly matched with a representative from each of the big four teams being on the front row.\n\nGonzález put his Ferrari on pole for the 4-3-4-3 line up with a lap time of 1m43.1s. Ascari's Lancia was second fastest alongside the Mercedes of Fangio and Behra's Maserati. Farina's Ferrari sat at the head of the second row but just 0.7 of a second covered the first five cars.\n\nIn blistering heat on the 16th January the 233.376 mile race was started and at the end it would produce some of the most unusual facts in F1 history. Fangio delighted the local by bursting into the lead from third on the grid, chased by Ascari and a fast-starting Stirling Moss (flying off the second row!), González and Farina followed in their wake. Ascari soon passed Fangio and a hard charging González passed them all to take the lead. Other incidents on Lap 1 saw the Maserati twins of Behra (#16) and Menditéguy (#24) hit each other putting Menditéguy out on the spot, and an accident for Pablo Birger (Gordini #40) ended his race too.\n\nThe race at the front remained close until Ascari crashed out on lap 22. His team mate Villoresi had already gone out of the race due to a fuel leak and taken over the Lancia of Euginio Castellotti, while Ascari waited to take over that car from Villoresi, Villoresi crashed it and ended Lancia involvement.\n\nCars had continually to fallen foul of accidents and mechanical problems; Behra accident damage put him out, Kling crashed and the transmission on Élie Bayol's Gordini failed putting him out. Uruguayan privateer Alberto Uria Uria (Maserati #30) stopped with no fuel on lap 22 and Moss' #6 Mercedes was stopped by a fuel system failure on lap 29 and he took over Herrmann's #8 car. 10 laps later Moss handed the #8 Mercedes to Kling, who drove it into 4th place at the finish.\n\nThe pits started to fill up with drivers; which was just as well as the Drivers were starting to feel the effects of the stifling heat. When an exhausted Farina pitted Umberto Maglioli took over the car. González then came in and the revived Farina took his car back into the fray. Even the local Fangio was forced into the pits to get a drink of water which allowed both Schell and Mieres to go ahead of him although the exhausted Schell was soon handing his car over to over to Jean Behra, and Mieres Car let him down putting Fangio back in the lead. González, now back in his own car after both Farina and Trintignant had done a stint in the #12 Ferrari, hounded Juan Manuel Fangio until he crashed and effectively put an end to any thoughts he had of winning. He did get his car back to the pits and pass the car on to Farina who brought the Ferrari home in 2nd place.\n\nThis was the “busiest” of F1 races and with of all this confusion over from 16 driver substitutions even Neubauer's head must have been spinning. While only Mières and Fangio drove the whole race and didn't swap cars the other exchanges led to the bizarre situation where Nino Farina and Maurice Trintignant both finished in second and third places.\n\nFangios winning time was 3h00m38.6s and also set fastest lap of 1m48.3s on lap 45. González, Farina and Trintignant shared the second placed Ferrari with Umberto Maglioli, Farina and Trintignant sharing 3rd place for Ferrari. Kling, Moss and Hermann shared RW196 #8 to finished fourth and the other solo driver, Mières, brought his #18 Maserati 250F home fifth place.\n\nThe 96 lap contest was also held in the hottest recorded race conditions, 40°C (about 104°F), although this temperature has twice been matched Dallas 1984 & Bahrain 2005, it has never been beaten.\n\nAs a result of his leg rubbing on the chassis frame which was being super heated by the exhaust pipe Fangio suffered severe burns to his leg. These wounds took 3 months to heal and Fangio carried the scares for the rest of his life. Fortunately the next race was not until late April so the necessary healing time was available.\n\n1955 Mille Miglia domination\n\nThis next race would provide some of that “wonder” I mentioned, the Mille Miglia of 1955 is revered to this day as an outstanding piece of driving by Stirling Moss. But the story isn't that simple, Moss wasn't the only Mercedes hero that day and none of the record setting would have been possible without the driving force of Neubauer behind the scenes.\n\nThe 22nd running of the Mille Miglia was the 3rd round of the 1955 World Sportscar Championship and the debut for the Mercedes 300SLR. Having already missed two of the qualifying rounds Daimler-Benz were determined to win the race and insisted Neubauer spare no effort or expense to win the race.\n\nThe Mille Miglia is a race against the clock rather than a race against the other competitors. With an entry list of 661 cars in 12 engine size classes for Grand Touring Cars, Touring Cars and Sport Cars the competition is not just varied but huge. All the major sports car manufacturers were there except Lancia who had chosen to focus solely on their F1 GP program.\n\nIn preparation Neubauer had the Rennabteilung bring three 300SLR cars built solely for the purpose of reconnaissance and practice and Four brand new 300SLR cars for the actual 992.332 mile race. As the race runs entirely over public roads from Brescia to Rome and back none but the most dedicated Italian drivers with their local knowledge understood the course. As such reconnaissance for the Mercedes team was of paramount importance and something Mercedes-Benz had done before. Mercedes had used reconnaissance based pace notes in the Carrera Panamericana so the basic idea was not exactly new. But, contrary to popular myth it was Stirling Moss and John Fitch who came up with the idea of the “roller” pace notes. They had originally been partnered to drive together, and when Mercedes decided to support the 300sl entries Alfred Neubauer moved Fitch over to drive one of the new 300sl entries.\n\nJenks jumped at the chance to ride along with Moss and built the roller box for the pace notes roll, Fitch had met the German journalist Kurt Gesell and invited him to be co-driver. Although Gesell had never taken part in racing before he was invited to ride along and together Fitch and Gesell set about their reconnoiter of the circuit. They only had time and resources to create a book style pace note set. Their system centred around a simple series of Xs' as danger ratings. One X for mildly dangerous, in that it could cause minor damage to the car, up three X meaning serious damage that would cost time for repairs to be made. Four X was actually for dangers to their own lives rather than to the car. Poor Kurt Gesell spent most of the race in a state of terror; the 300sl was meteoric compared to the old road car they had used for the exploratory runs. Fitch received his warning notices interspersed with regular utterances of “Mein Gott” as Gesell repeatedly felt sure they were about to die.\n\nWhen the first car rolled of the start ramp on the 30th of April 1955 the pressure went on and while some kept their heads others seemed to forget everything but being first. Although even when you have finished the Mille Miglia course it could be several hours before you knew you had won. Moss and Jenkinson couldn't really be said to have “local knowledge” of the route even though this was the time in the event for Moss and he had spent several weeks with 'Jenks' accumulating course data for the pace notes. It would be these notes that would be key to maintaining Moss' level of confidence.\n\nAs for the competition Eugenio Castellotti was on a mission with his 4.4ltr Ferrari 121LM. He set off at as blistering a pace as his massively powerful engine could provide regardless of any risk of damaging it. Castellotti drove like a demon, sliding his car through corners and leaving clouds of dust and long black tyre streaks in his wake. In trying to extract more performance than the engine could maintain Castellotti predictably broke the Ferrari on the coast down to Pescara, he had been two minutes ahead of Moss/Jenkinson. This retirement was followed by that of a team mate of Castellotti's, Marzotto. Marzotto had been flying at 174mph when his Ferrari threw a tyre tread. In an fantastic piece of skill he kept the car on the road and stopped to make a tyre change, only to find the spare was different size to the others on his car thus forcing him to abandon.\n\nThat sort of error was something Neubauer simply wouldn't let occur and it was another of Neubauer 's superbly efficient team that helped Moss snatch the lead from Piero Taruffi who was shattering all previous Mille Miglia records in a Scuderia Ferrari 118 LM Scaglietti by averaging 130mph on the sprint down to Pescara. There was a tiny gap between Moss and Taruffi on arrival at Pescara but as the teams set to work refuelling the cars it was the well drilled Mercedes crew that put in 18 gallons of fuel in 28 seconds and got Moss and Jenks away in the lead. 62.5 miles later the two cars arrived at the next checkpoint in L’Aquila on the route through the mountains, and Moss was now 35 sec's ahead. Herrmann, Taruffi, Fangio and Kling was the order at that point meaning the Mercedes 300SLR cars were running 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th.\n\nJenks reading of the roller notes was giving Moss all the information he needed as he confidently rounded blind corners and flew (literally flying around 200ft on one occasion) over blind brows. By the time he reached the next main stop, in Rome, Moss was 1m15sec's in the lead having covered the stretch from L’Aguila to Rome 1hour6min's.\n\nIn worrying moments for Fangio he saw time slipping away as his engine developed problems. The mechanically knowledgeable Fangio reported his concerns to the mechanics in Rome who, strangely, dismissed his claims. Mercedes were definitely not having an easy ride, Kling crashed avoiding spectators on the way into Rome. He ended up against a tree and suffered broken ribs. Moss kept his mind focused on the next section, often considered the most challenging one, through the mountains from Rome to Siena. Keen to disprove the old adage of ‘He who leads at Rome never finishes' Moss set out in a determined frame of mind, by the end of the 140mile run to Siena Moss extended his lead to 5m40sec's over Hans Herrmann with both Perdisa and Taruffi having retired.\n\nDuring the 44mile stage from Siena to Florence Moss pulled out a further 8 seconds over Herrmann but Fangio was really struggling. When the mechanics there checked on the unhealthy noises coming from the 300SLRs engine they found Fangio's car was running on 7 cylinders due to a fractured fuel injection pipe.\n\nThere was no let up from Moss over the remaining stages and he repeatedly set fastest time after fastest time as the stages counted down. Fangio struggled on and Herrmann crashed out but Moss just kept going until he crossed the finish line in Brescia at 17:29 on the 1st of May, 1955.\n\nIt was usual practice for all practice laps to count towards qualifying but at Monaco in 1955 an actual qualifying was held during the first practice. The days leading up to the race contained several incidents that were later given more importance due to incidents that occurred in the race.\n\nFangio smashed Rudi Caracciola's 1937 lap record, set in a supercharged 5.6-ltr Mercedes W125, when his #2 RW196 short wheelbase car set what would be the pole time of 1m41.1s. A lap time a full 5 seconds quicker than Carraciola's 1m46.5s from 1937. This feat was later matched by Ascari in the Lancia D50 during Saturday practice and thus put Fangio and Ascari 1-2 on the grid. Moss put his Mercedes #6 on the outside of the three car front row. The grid was set as a 3-2-3-2 format would include several Maseratis as well as the Lancias, Ferraris and Mercedes.\n\nTalking of Mercedes Hans Hermann had a huge accident in practice and was lucky to survive. Hitting the wall on the way into Casino Square Hermann suffered six breaks in his right thigh and dislocates the hip, his pelvis was broken too. Scared that the car could burst into flames at any second the severely injured Hans Hermann dragged himself away from the wreck on his elbows. The incident put Neubauer into damage limitation mode again and he sought out André Simon who was to race his private Maserati and persuaded him to take the spare Mercedes on the track instead. Simon put the spare Mercedes, #4, on the fourth row of the grid beside Trintignant in the Ferrari 652. Further down the grid Mike Hawthorn debuted the Vanwall in it's first World Championship event.\n\nMoss recorded in his diary that Thursday night that \"My best was 3rd, 1:43.4. Ascari 1:42 and Fangio 1:41.4! Old record was 1:45 (Carrac!). The ratios are not good and are being changed. Bed at 10 p.m.”. He went onto record “Poor Hans had an accident. He has hurt his leg and ribs.”\n\nPractice for Moss was also enlivened by a pretty girl at the Station Hairpin. On each lap Moss waved to her and eventually they manage to signal each other and meet up later. That evening Moss took the young lady to the Ali Baba Club where, on returning to their table after a dance, the couple found a written note on table. It ready, “Der Moss must in der bed be, mitout mein frau. Neubauer.” Moss knew it wasn't the hand writing of Neubauer and on glancing around the room saw the grinning face of his Mille Miglia partner, Denis Jenkinson!\n\nIt wasn't all fun though, during the Saturday Moss, Fangio and the very superstitious Ascari did a track walk together. Alberto Ascari was scared of the number 8 as his Father Antonio Ascari was killed in an Alfa Romeo P2 carrying the #26 (2+6=8). Now he found himself on the grid between the #2 and #6 Mercedes. Already on edge when the group came to the chicane one of the drivers noted that “Whoever touches here, goes into the water,” Ascari immediately reacted by looking for something wooden to touch.\n\nAnother quirky fact was that Antonio Ascari was 13,463 days old when he died, Alberto Ascari was 13,462 days old that Saturday.\n\nOn the 22nd of May, 1955, the flag fell to start the Monaco GP. Fangio led the others away and into the first corner but Castellotti, flying off the second row of the grid passed him on the run up the hill to Casino square. Fangio soon reasserted his control and pulled away leaving Castellotti and Moss to negotiate who should be in second place. Moss didn't take too claim the place from Castellotti after 5 laps so the Mercedes duo, nicknamed “the train” were already asserting a strangle hold on the race. Meanwhile Behra was making his Maserati a point of concern for the Lancias of Ascari and Castellotti.\n\nAt ¼ distance Ascari usurped third place from his argumentative young teammate and the running order settled as Fangio, Moss, Ascari and Castellotti. Farina was put out of contention when he damaged a wheel and had to stop for a replacement. By lap 24 the #4 Mercedes of Simon was put out with engine trouble and when Fangio set fastest lap of the race 1m42.4s, with Moss on his tail, Neubauer was frantically signalling them to ease up so as not to over stress the engines and give away the 1-2 result.\n\nOn lap 40 Fangio and Moss were heading Behra (Maserati), Ascari (Lancia), Trintignant (Ferrari), Mieres (Maserati) and Perdisa (Maserati). Now, Neubauer might have been right about protecting the engines but it was a broken axle/transmission problem that forced Fangio to park his car on lap 50. This left Moss with a comfortable 1 lap lead from Ascari and a determined Jean Behra in third as Castellotti had to pit with a slow puncture because of a deflating tire. However, Behra was starting to experience issues with his Maserati.\n\nDouglas Rutherford recorded that :-\n\n“The big Maserati flag went out to stop young Perdisa, circulating hopefully in sixth place. He came in, braking hard, stared in amazement at the pit staff and Behra gesturing for him to get out of that cockpit quick. Orders is orders. Perdisa jumped out, Behra jumped in and gave the second Maserati the gun. Perdisa shrugged, climbed into the thrashed Maserati, pulled his goggles down and drove away to do the best he could with it. But the Monaco gremlin liked young Perdisa. It was he and not Behra who figured when the final results came out.”\n\nOne assumes Moss must have been feeling on top of the world, recently winning the Mille Miglia and now leading at Monaco, but as often happens pride comes before a fall and fate intervened. On the 80th lap a minor problem in his car's sophisticated valve train slowed the #6 Mercedes engine and after trailing smoke and oil around the circuit from the tunnel and along the harbour front back to the pits the car had to be retired. Moss later recalled :-\n\n“If it had been now, I would have won,” How? “The race then was 100 laps—now it’s down to 80 laps...”\n\nUnfortunately Ascari's lead was very short lived, he was at Casino Square when Moss retired and never got to pass the pits to see he was in the lead. The #26 Lancia D50 failed to negotiate the chicane coming after the tunnel, the very place he, Fangio and Moss had discussed the day before, hit the hay bales and sandbags which flipped the car and driver over the barrier and created their less than elegant dive straight into the harbour. Apparently the famous actor and comedian Peter Ustinov was watching near the chicane and saw Ascari exit the tunnel then disappear. It was only when he saw the huge plume of water, followed by the spray and bubbles, that he realised what had happened.\n\nOne can only wonder if Ascari was any the wiser too. Fortunately the D50 had a commodious cockpit allowing him an easy egress from the sinking car. Bruised, shocked and with a painful nose, Ascari popped to the surface and the anxious crowd were soon shouting and pointing “There he is!” as blue helmet with a darkly streaked face underneath it came into view. Alberto Ascari tore off his helmet and started swimming towards the rescue boat and the divers who hauled him aboard.\n\nThe cause of Ascari's accident remains unclear. Did something on his car break?, Did he loose traction on oil left behind by Moss' Mercedes? Or was he distracted by the wildly cheering and waving crowd who knew he was in the lead even though he didn't, did fatigue and distraction cause a momentary lapse in concentration? What ever the cause the he spent the night in the hospital and the Lancia became the subject of a photograph as it was recover from 25ft of water in the Bay of Hercules.\n\nEarily Alberto Ascari was killed four days later testing a Sports car at Monza. This continued the parallels with his fathers life as Antonio Ascari also survived an awful crash just four days before his death in the French GP of 1925. Both were the same age to the day when they died as a result of motor racing accidents and both died on the 26th day of the month.\n\nAs the race entered the last 20 laps it was the 38 year old veteran Trintignant in the lead driving an old Ferrari that a little while before had been gathering dust at the back of the Scuderia's factory. As Castellotti and Perdisa chased him, in the Lancia and Maserati respectively, it was the Frenchman that took a most unlikely win by 20sec's, from 5th on the grid. I wonder what Behra thought about Perdisa beating him; in his own car?\n\nLe Mans 1955\n\nThe 11th of June 1955 would be a watershed in motor sports and an event that would, in conjunction with other deadly events have around the world, have ramifications still felt in motor racing to this day. The season had already seen the loss of several drivers including Alberto Ascari and Bill Vukovich (who died in a crash at the Indy 500 while on route to a third consecutive Indy win) but the Circuit de la Sarthe was about to witness something that, even in a Europe hardened by war, was shocking and heartbreaking. Alfred Neubauer certainly felt the effects, as did Mike Hawthorn and Lance Macklin, There was to be a clear ending to the joie de vivre era of motorsports and a new dawn for the organisers responsibility towards safety.\n\nNeubauer was as confident as ever when the Rennabteilung arrived at le Sarthe for the 23rd Grand Prix d`Endurance les 24 Heures du Mans held over the 11th and 12th of June, 1955. The fourth round of the F.I.A. World Sports Car Championship welcomed around 250,000 spectators to witness the European classic on a circuit that was practically the same as it was since the first race in 1923, a place famous for it's high speed straight and tight corners amongst it's 8.38-mile length.\n\nIf the Monaco result was disappointment then the Eifelrennen and Belgian GP victories had put the team back on a high. Daimler-Benz brought all their considerable skills, money and resources to bear in their efforts to win the Le Mans in 1955. A race that was considered likely to be the best since the end of the world war two. 87 entries were registered for this event although only 70 arrived to try and qualify for the 60 slots available in the race. Billed in the British press as \"a United Nations of motor racing\" all the big sports car manufacturers, Mercedes, Ferrari, Jaguar, Aston Martin, Gordini, Cunningham, Lotus, Porsche et al were represented and a monumental battle between Mercedes and Jaguar was highly anticipated.\n\nNeubauer had the Rennabteilung enter three new cars and he changed his ideas on driver pairings. Usually Neubauer put his fastest drivers as lead driver in separate cars but for this race he decided to partner his two best drivers, Fangio and Moss, in the same car, the #19 300SLR. The second pair was Pierre Levegh with John Fitch, in 300SLR #20, and Karl Kling and André Simon drove the third car carrying #21.\n\nThis really was an all star line up for the time and although Pierre Levegh was not a regular member of the Mercedes team he was a huge hero in France. Especially considering his fantastic effort in 1952 when he drove solo, and in the lead for much of the time, for over 22hrs until mechanical trouble put him out of the race. His departure gave that race victory to Mercedes so Alfred Neubauer thought it would be popular, even diplomatic to offer Levegh a drive. Just ten years since the end of the 2nd World War it was also probably expedient to consider the feelings of the French spectators too. Pierre Levegh's real name was Pierre Bouillin, he used the name Levegh in honour of his uncle, Alfred Velghe, who raced under the “nom de course” Levegh. This was an anagram of Velghe and sounded like his mother's maiden name Lévy. Alfred Levegh won several big race at the turn of the century until his career was cut short by respiratory problems aggravated by racing through the dust and fumes of the time.\n\nIn the week before the race John Fitch was invited to take dinner with Pierre and his wife at their hotel. Levegh told his Mercedes co-driver that “a victory at Le Mans had long been his most cherished ambition”. Despite Fitch's poor French and Levegh's total lack of knowledge the two were able to communicate surprisingly well. Both were looking forward to the race.\n\nThe new version of the RW196S, as it was a derivative of the F1 GP RW196, was a 300SLR with a difference. Expert analysts of the time considered them the best sports cars in the world. But they were heavy compared so some of their opposition and their in board drum breaks, huge as they were, were of questionably adequacy so the engineers at Mercedes dusted off their 1952 idea of an air brake. A hydraulically-actuated flap was formed as part of the rear deck of the car, operated by the driver via a lever in the cockpit. It is also worth remembering at this point that the bodywork was fabricated out of highly flammable, but ultra-lightweight, magnesium alloy. This was especially important in the braking zones at the end of the the Mulsanne straight or going to the White House corner where Jaguars disc brakes gave them a distinct advantage.\n\nWhen the flag dropped Castellotti got away fastest and his Ferrari 121LM lead the first lap with Hawthorn chasing in the 'D' type Jag'. Fangio had jumped into his cockpit and caught his trousers on the gear lever, the ensuing seconds lost getting himself free meant he was a little way off the two leaders. In his usual way Fangio hunted Castellotti and Hawthorn and the the three started to live up to the great expectations of the crowd. The three men traded record tap times until Castellotti's Ferrari started to slow, this was the earliest signs of the mechanical issues that would put all the Ferrari 121LMs out of the race.\n\nHawthorn and Fangio went past the Ferrari and maintained their blistering pace, battling hammer and tongs for over two hours. This was to go down as one of the epic duels in motor racing history, with multiple lead changes and Hawthorn setting the fastest race lap on lap 28, it was 4m06.6s, a speed of 196.963 kph. In the heat of this battle Mike Hawthorn, in his efforts to keep ahead of Fangio, had been ignoring pit signals to stop for fuel. This was to have dire consequences, not for Jaguar or Hawthorn, but for other drivers, and hundreds of spectators.\n\nIn the third hour Hawthorn's #6 Jaguar was in dire need of fuel. The pits at that time were not divided from the track so it was a particularly dangerous place when it was busy. On lap 35 the leaders started making their first pit stops and as Hawthorn came onto the pit straight he passed the #26 Austin-Healey 100S driven by Lance Macklin. Hawthorn then caught sight of the frantic signalling from his pits.\n\nAt the last moment Hawthorn decided to pit and moved abruptly across Macklin's path, braking hard to enter his pits but still going so fast he overshot his box by 50-75 meters. Reversing isn't permitted in the pits so the Jaguar staff waved Hawthorn on for another lap as behind him a scene of utter devastation and confusion was developing and trying to push the Jaguar back into it's pit was just too dangerous.\n\nAs Hawthorn had swerved across the path of Macklin and suddenly slowed, a surprised Macklin attempted to avoid hitting the Jaguar. He stayed right for a moment, raising dust from the side of the track with its right wheels, but his car had drum brakes and could not stop as quickly as the Jaguar fitted with Disc brakes. As the spaced closed Macklin had to turn toward the centre of the track. The Austin-Healey went into a slide and initially appeared out of control as it crossed the centre of the circuit but Macklin held it and regained direction, slowing in the process. Macklin's actions had been to avert an accident in the pit area that could have had devastating effects. Sadly his actions had exactly the results he was trying to avoid as he was unaware of the other cars now in the vicinity.\n\nThe Mercedes cars of Levegh and Fangio who had been chasing Hawthorn now found a much slower Austin-Healey in their path. Levegh was acutely aware that Fangio was behind him and about to take the lead, as such he didn't want to slow Fangio down. The 300SLR of Pierre Levegh, travelling at over 150 mph, was now closing on the Austin-Healey rapidly. Levegh was going at least 75mph faster than Macklin and probably realising he couldn't avoid hitting Macklin's car thrust his arm into the air as a warning to following drivers. Levegh very nearly avoided the crash, but at approximately 18:25 the Mercedes just hit the left rear wing of the Austin-Healey.\n\nSeeing Leveghe's warning hand Fangio, in the #19 300SLR, had just enough time to dodge all the cars and carry on. Fangio believed Levegh saved his life and later told “Life” magazine that he was very grateful to Levegh for his warning despite the fact that racing at 125mph, \"he had no chance to do so himself”. Fangio never forgot Levegh.\n\nLevegh's 300SLR right front wheel rode up the left rear wing of the Macklin's Austin-Healey and the Mercedes was launched into the air. Macklin's car slid out of control across the track ricocheted off the pit wall and went back across the track to the earth banking, the Austin-Healey had hit three people injuring two and killing one. Macklin was uninjured but his car was very badly damaged.\n\nPeople started to pick themselves up, start looking for the friends and family and trying to help the injured. Photo's abound of the those who were able carrying bodies away and covering them with the advertising banners, blankets and coats. Men, women and children were dead. Of those alive most look distraught and confused, feelings mirrored on the other side of the track as those in the pits climbed on top of the buildings to get a better view and understand what was happening. The drivers knew nothing of how bad things were until they came into the pits and talked to their teams. John Fitch later explained how the teams couldn't get across the race track and the very long lap meant only those in the vicinity at the time had a clue to what had happened, the others just came around to go pass a crash.\n\nWhen Hawthorn came back around and saw the extent of the incident he was so upset he arrived at the pits with tears streaming down his face. In viewing the footage, and reading accounts of the accident it seems clear Hawthorn was the proximate cause of the accident and some sections of the press came straight out and blamed him. Others cast aspersions at Lance Macklin too. Most drivers considered it a racing incident.\n\nMacklin's car was dragged back over to the pits by police and impounded by the French authorities. It was released back to the British company the following year, rebuilt and spent 42 years at a garage in the north of England\n\nThe results of the crashes were horrific. The death toll is believed to be 84 spectators and Levegh, with at least 120 injured. Footage from the 4 known cine camera angles and numerous still photos show something akin to a war zone. Ten years after the end of the 2nd World War a German machine was again coming from the air and killing French citizens, the irony wasn't lost on Mercedes or Neubauer.\n\nAs organisers, police and spectators tried to help the injured and make sense of what was happening the race continued unabated. Only 10minutes after the crash Dick Jacobs crashed near Maison Blanche and his MG EX182 turned over and burst into flames. Jacobs was badly hurt but did survive. As horrors continued to unfold the race organizers argued about what to do. In the end they decided to continue the race as there major concern was getting ambulances into the track and back out again to the hospitals. It was feared that thousands of people trying to leave the circuit would hamper the emergency services and add to the rising death toll\n\nThe Fangio/Moss car moved into the lead with a margin of several laps over the Hawthorn/Bueb Jaguar and the Kling/Herrmann 300SLR running in a solid third. After the next stops for driver changes the Jaguar was outmatched on talent and Moss led Bueb by almost two laps at midnight but the Jaguar team spotters reports on the Mercedes cars braking points was suggesting the 300SLRs brakes were loosing efficiency.\n\nAt the 2am point the #6 Jaguar had reduced the gap to one and a half laps with the #21 Mercedes two laps behind them.\n\n1955 British GP\n\nA fortnight later and the teams all met for the next GP, the British GP, this time held at the circuit laid out around the horse racing facility at Aintree on the outskirts of Liverpool. Famous for running the Grand National horse race the motor racing circuit was built in 1954 and soon dubbed ‘The Goodwood of the North’ and such comparisons with the other Horse racing turned motorsports venue. New York Times correspondent, Robert Daley, wasn't impressed. In his book, “Cars at Speed”, Daley wrote\n\n\"The British make much of the amenities of the Aintree circuit, bragging about its grandstands, its bars, its 'lavatories,\" and continued \"It is true that you can buy scotch whiskey during a race, and usually the weather is so awful you will want to.\" One wonders if the RAC were happy as it was their decision to move the race from it's apparent home at Silverstone.\n\nThe VIII RAC British Grand Prix was to be held over 90 Laps of the 3 mile (4.828 km) circuit providing 270 miles of excitement for the viewing public. In truth the result was almost certainly a Mercedes victory and most likely for Championship leader Fangio. But, Neubauer and several other members of the Rennabteilung were conscious of the facts that it was still only 10 years since the end of WWII and that Liverpool had been the subject of heavy German bombings. The events at Le Mans still resonated with the Germans too and upsetting another former adversary might not be commercially expedient.\n\nThere were never any team orders at Mercedes and everyone was aware Moss was an exceptional driver as he been Fangio's wheel tracks, and right on his tail, for most of the season and no long ago won the Mille Miglia in record time. Neubauer remembered later that the comment was going around that it \"...would be good for an English win to a German car for the first time a Grand Prix ... \". The idea wasn't without precedent as during the previous season at the Avus non-championship race it had been engineered for Kling to lead Fangio home which was popular with Berliners. Neubauer was also sure to have records of the fact that in the five years the British GP had been held only two British drivers had finished on the lead lap, Reg Parnell being 3rd in 1950 and Mike Hawthorn who was 2nd in 1954. It would not only be expedient politically for the Germans but also commercially for Mercedes if the Moss took his first GP victory at his home race.\n\nIf Neubauer thought it would be good for Moss to win he wouldn't give it to him on a plate. Fangio was the clear No.1 driver at Mercedes and it wouldn't do for a result to look staged. Moss would have to earn his 1st GP Win, and there were plenty of competitors who wanted to take the win instead of him.\n\nFor Practice Mercedes had four entries Fangio drove the #10 Mercedes RW196, Moss carried #12, Kling #14 and Piero Taruffi drove the #50 Mercedes. Ranged against them were Ferraris for Hawthorn and Castellotti, Maserattis were driven by Jean Behra, Roberto Mieres, Andre Simon and Lance Macklin. Vanwall were represented by Ken Wharton and Harry Schell while Tony Rolt, Peter Walker and Leslie Marr were hopefully piloting Connaught-Altas. Driving for Gordini were Manzon and da Silva Ramos. Almost unnoticed was an Australian driver Jack Brabham making his debut for the Cooper team in a Cooper-Bristol.\n\nMoss was on form and stormed to his first ever pole position. He had fitted a shorter final drive than Fangio giving better acceleration and the younger man found it easier to adapt to the ‘back to front’ gearbox fitted with the Mercedes developed interlocking mechanism to help prevent missed gear changes. Moss' pole time was 2m00.4s and beside him on the 3-2-3-2 grid was Fangio just 0.2s adrift. Behra got his Maserati in among the Mercedes but Kling and Taruffi took up 4th and 5th on the grid. The third row of the grid saw the Vanwall of Harry Schell splitting the Maseratis of Mieres and Simon. Eugenio Castellotti was fastest of the faltering Ferrari's in 10th position and debutante Brabham just grabbed hold of the back of the grid putting the Cooper-Bristol in 25th slot.\n\nRace day, the 16th of July, 1955, was hot and dry and everything looked set fair for a great day. The 100,000 strong crowd had high hopes for Moss and even the Times newspaper reported :-\n\n“There is much speculation about the Mercedes team tactics, and whether these might be varied on this occasion. ... The propaganda value of a victory by a British driver in Britain is not lightly to be discarded, and Fangio's leading position on points for the world championship would not be jeopardized by his having to be content with second place today”.\n\nMoss led away only for Fangio to quickly move ahead and the silver machine established the normal situation of 1-2 at the front and pulling away from everyone else. On lap 3 Moss took back the lead and at Anchor bend and Fangio later remembered thinking, “Okay, let’s see what you can do.,” and kept Moss honest up to lap 18 when he passed Moss again. Behra had recovered from a poor getaway to fight his way past Kling and Taruffi and was the only person able to get near the leading Mercedes cars until a broken oil pipe put him out on lap 10.\n\nMoss recorded the events in his diary saying :- “Took lead at start, due to Behra's proximity. Let Fangio lead later, and at 18 laps took lead to the end”. Moss was clearly on fire and Motor Sport Magazine's race later report made it clear it was a race though :- \"It was clear that if Moss was going to be allowed to win, he was going to have to work for it,\"\n\nAs for the rest of the field the hot weather and attrition were taking a toll, competitors fell away with oil leaks, transmission problems and broken engines till there was hardly a hint of a threat from interlopers be they red, green or blue. In the Mercedes pit it was so quiet one of the Mercedes mechanics picked up his kit and went down the pit lane to help repair the broken oil pipe on Ken Wharton's Vanwall!\n\nMoss slipped back into the lead on lap 26, shortly after Jack Brabham had retired his Cooper-Bristol with engine failure on lap 25. Moss was using the back markers very skilfully to open out a gap on Fangio that approached 10s just after the mid point in the race. Neubauer could see the real threat was now reliability and stepped out with his flag and ordered “Regulare’, or hold position, and shortly after ‘Piano’ meaning gently. Moss slowed as per orders and Fangio closed back up on his tail. Meanwhile at Ferrari Castellotti, who had been forced out of the race by a transmission failure on lap 16 took over the car of #16 car from Hawthorn who was somewhat unwell that day.\n\nFangio chased Moss around Aintree along straights and round corners with names normally associated with one horsepower transport than the four wheeled kind. The enthralled spectators, enjoying the novelty of an Englishman in the lead, hoped against hope Moss could hold Fangio off for the win. Moss himself was starting to wonder what the protocol was as his respect for Fangio was so great that he thought it wrong for him to win. The crowd still saw a great spectacle as Moss decided to go for the fastest lap, if he wasn't to win then he could have that. That goal was achieved on lap 88 when Moss matched his pole time of 2m00.4s.\n\nStill wondering if Mercedes expected Fangio to win Moss, in his own words, \"backed off on the last lap\",\"because I wasn't sure of what we were supposed to do — but when the Old Man was still behind me at the final corner, I can tell you I gave it everything on the run up to the line!”. The scene on track at Tatts Corner as Moss having previously given Fangio the options to pass was two Mercedes going flat out, as Fangio slid a little wide Moss went full throttle for the line. They were separated by 0.2 sec's as the chequered flag fell and the huge British crowd exploded in delight.\n\nThe Guardian report of the race carries the lines:- “Moss “waved Fangio through … Fangio drew alongside him as they approached the chequered flag and then, it seemed, hung back to let Moss cross the line first … it was a sporting gesture and fair”.\n\nMercedes completely dominated the race but any lingering concerns about anti-German feelings were masked by the British drivers victory. Kling and Taruffi were 3rd and 4th although only Kling was still on the lead lap at the end. All eyes were now on the 25 year old Londoner, whose indisputable patriotism shown driving British cars of lesser proficiency, had now proved he had “the right stuff” and was a match for anyone driving competitive machinery.\n\nBut Moss has never been quite sure he really won the race, Moss said :-\n\n\"Don't ask me if he let me win that day, because in all honesty I don't know, and it was something we never discussed subsequently. I can tell you that there were no prearranged tactics between us, no team orders from Neubauer. Perhaps it was suggested to Fangio that he should let me win, because it was the British GP. It's quite possible. But he wasn't the kind of guy who would ever have let me know it, unlike some drivers of the recent past. He had too much class for that\".\n\nMany years later Moss did ask Fangio directly if he had allowed him to win. Fangio replied :-\n\n‘No. It was your day.’\n\nFangio also later told a journalist :-\n\n\"I don't think I could have won, even if I'd wanted to. Stirling was really pushing that day, and his car had a higher final drive than mine. It was quicker.\"\n\nThere is no doubt the respect between these team mates was mutual and total. On the podium Moss put the laurel wreath over Fangio's shoulders and told the assembled fans :-\n\n\"Fangio, the greatest driver in the world, could easily have come up and made a different story of the race, but being the sportsman he is, Fangio has given me the opportunity of realizing my ambition to win the British Grand Prix.”\n\nIn truth one suspects Moss was aided by that higher final drive and what Nigel Mansell called “people power”. Moss had the edge on Fangio throughout the weekend and I doubt Fangio, brilliant as he was, could so consistently be that tiny margin behind Moss in qualifying and the race. Neither Fangio or Neubauer were the type to just hand Moss the win on a plate, even though Mercedes had great superiority they also knew the British fans could see through a “fix”. The only person who knew the real truth of the matter, Fangio, took that truth to the grave.\n\nThere were only 9 finishers and if the first win for a British driver at the British GP made a great day for the British fans the the real glory was Germany's. Moss' winning time was 3h07m21.2s, and in a reversal of the usual Mercedes “train” Fangio was +0.2s behind Moss. A look at the top four finishing order, says it all though. Moss #12, Fangio #10, Kling #14, Taruffi #50, all driving for Mercedes. Luigi Musso was fifth for Maserati and Mike Hawthorn's shared drive with Castellotti garnered a distant 6th place and gave the fans another Brit' to cheer.\n\nMoss was now 11 points behind Fangio in the drivers' championship but with the cancellations of the German, Swiss and Spanish Grands Prix, no one could overhaul Fangio's lead and he took his third F1 driver's world championship title.\n\nThe Swedish organisers had modelled their event on the British motor racing system, they had four classes for sportscar racing and a Formula three event too. Clearly they were attempting to race the profile of motor racing and to show that there were opportunities for people to get into the sport even if you didn't have huge amounts of money. Class One was for the top flight racing sports over 3litres like the Merc's and included a D-type Jaguar, a pair of Aston Martins works and private Ferraris as well as AlfaRomeos and Maseratis; in all 10 cars entered this class.\n\nMoss was again faster than Fangio with Castellotti, having missed first practice because his Ferrari was delayed during it's train journey was able to put in some good times but nothing like that of the Mercedes of Moss and Fangio.\n\nClasses 2 (series sports cars) & 3 (touring cars over 2ltrs) practised together and the factory Porsche of Frankenberg was able to set lap times faster than any of the SL cars and Mercedes were panicked into removing anything they could. Bumpers, grilles and even seat cushions, among other things, were discarded but with little effect; the Porsche remained faster!\n\nThe days racing for the GP Sverige on the 7th of August 1955 consisted of several classes of sports car races and a Formula III event to entertain the crowds. The Main event was the 32 lap race for special racing sports cars such the Mercedes 300SLRs complete with their air brakes. It really was an truly international event. Racing started with the Formula III cars followed by the Class2/3 race.\n\nA Ferrari and a Jaguar had the front row of the grid with Frankenberg's Porsche and the 300SL of von Trips behind. When the race got underway it was the Ferrari Monza of Carlsson that went into the lead with von Trips following and Jaguar of Lincoln, Kling's 300SL and the Porsche of Lundgren in that order. On lap four Carlsson, who had already amassed a 17s lead, hit the undulating section too fast and the car landed badly throwing car into a thick hedge putting the combination out of the race, fortunately Carlsson was not hurt. Von Trips took over the lead followed by Kling and Lundgren who was doing a great job of staying with the two 300SL drivers. Lincoln in the Jaguar had a good lead in the class two contest with the Porsche keeping him honest until Lincoln made a mistake and the Jag' slid off at a corner and ended up on inverted in an adjacent field,again without serious injury to the driver.\n\nKling's #55 300SL took over the lead from Trips and the cars ran in team order until on lap 12 the 300SL of von Trips lost it's brakes and would have disappeared down the road to Kristianstad if his car hadn't been arrested by the straw bales without damage. At the end of the 16 lap race Kling won the GT class at an average speed 143.9 km/h followed home. Frankenberg won class 2 for Porsche.\n\nIt must have been a strange feeling for Herr Neubauer as his usual Autumn routine of intensely studying the coming years international race calendar was no longer needed. The board of directors at Daimler-Benz had decided the company would not compete in any form of motor-racing from the end of the 1955 season. When Neubauer had put forward his list of races for 1955 it hadn't included the RAC Tourist Trophy race. Neubauer was not only a past master at choosing what drivers to pair together for big races but also which races would bring Mercedes the maximum publicity and prestige, any starting money was merely a bonus and certainly not a factor in Neubauers considerations. He didn't think the Dundrod race had sufficient impact and chose the Carrera Pan Americana instead.\n\nNeubauer was also a stubborn man and never changed his mind once a decision had been made, and Mercedes never raced anywhere if they didn't have the full backing of entire team and the Daimler-Benz board who where investing huge sums of money to finance the Rennabteilung and expected maximum returns for their money. As such the badgering by Stirling Moss and John Fitch to include the RAC TT race fell on deaf ears. No way would Mercedes race in County Antrim and they would not support any private entry by Moss and Fitch either.\n\nJust when Moss and Fitch were giving up the Carrera Pan Americana was cancelled and suddenly the whole team would be available for RAC TT. Neubauer was still a perfectionist in all things so the standings in the World Sports car championship made for gloomy reading and fell well short of Mercedes, and Neubauer's, requirements. Ferrari were leading the championship, and well on course to a third successive title, with 18 points, two points ahead of Jaguar with Maserati holding third place on 11 points. Mercedes had less than half the points of Ferrari languishing as they were on just 8 points. Neubauer was sure it would take a miracle to achieve their ambition of winning the sportscar championship; but, he changed his mind over the RAC TT race. Whether it was just to keep the team together and racing one extra time as a replacement for the Carrera, or because it counted toward the WSCC, or both, isn't clear; just the fact that he changed his mind was enough.\n\nBut this threw up new issues for Neubauer, who to pair with who and what was the Dundrod circuit like. At le Mans it had been Fitch who was most adamant that the Mercedes team should withdraw. Moss had been very reluctant to retire, being in the lead and knowing this was probably his best chance to ever win the classic race, I think most of us can understand his emotions. It could have been a source of tension between Moss and Fitch but Neubauer still put them together as a team. He then put endless pressure on the pair to provide all possible information on the Dundrod track, the weather and the surroundings.\n\nThere was somewhat of a continental invasion of Dundrod with the British teams of Jaguar, Aston Martin, MG backed up by Connaught, Lotus, Cooper and Kieft, ready to fight it out with Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, Maserati, Porsche and the smaller French Dbs, 900cc D.K.W.s and 750-cc Panhards. In all there were fifteen manufacturers in the field. The drivers included many of the worlds best known GP and sports car drivers, there were of course the usual British sports-car drivers and more than a few comparative novices who if they weren't daunted by the whole affair; should have been!\n\n64 entries were received split into 6 classes covering cars from 750cc to 5000cc engine capacities. 55 cars actually made practice with Neubauer's Mercedes 300SLRs in the 3000 class piloted by John Fitch and Stirling Moss in #10, Juan Fangio and Karl Kling carried #9 and the Andre Simon and Wolfgang von Trips car was #11. The 3000 class was one of the most hotly contested classes with Aston Martin DB3S’s driven by Reg Parnell and Roy Salvadori, and Peter Collins and Tony Brooks. The Officine Alfieri Maserati team, desperate to keep their own championship hopes alive were represented in the 3000 class by Musso and Bordoni with a 300S backed up by another 300S and an A6GCS. A Ferrari 875 Monza of Maglioli and Trintignant was Ferrari's hope to seal the championship while Jaguar were trying to steal it. Two 'D' type Jaguars were entered, the works car driven by Mike Hawthorn and Desmond Titterington, and the second, a private entry, for Robert Berry and Ninian Sanderson. Reinforcing the idea of this race being a “Big” event most of these top teams brought more than enough spare cars and engines, as well as personnel and spares in order to respond to any situation that may occur; perhaps they were finally catching on to Mercedes secrets of success!\n\nPractice started with a dry afternoon session but was soon highlighting the problems of running such widely different classes of cars and abilities of drivers. As the preparation runs continued Olivier Gendebien crashed one of the 3-litre 857 Ferraris, writing it off and braking his arm into the bargain, resulting in their withdrawal and Masten Gregory being loaned out to the Porsche works outfit. Ferrari's woes didn't stop there though, the 3.4 litre car was coughing and spewing out large volumes of smoke. As the weather turned to the traditional rain that helps make Ireland so green it became harder than ever for the best drivers to put in competitive times while dodging the mobile chicanes and indecisive movements of the lower ranked drivers.\n\nThe Mercedes cars ran as well as you would expect being the same specification as Mille Miglia cars but it is interesting to note that for early practice Mercedes used two different cars for the “sighting laps”. One was one of the Le Mans cars complete with airbrake and the other was an “Uhlenhaut coupé” which von Trips had driven all the way from Stuttgart simply to get him used to being in the 300SLR layout.\n\nThe results of the melees in the rain of the mountain course was the Moss/Fitch Mercedes on pole alongside the Hawthorn/Titterington Jaguar. The Gendebien/Gregory Ferrari was recorded as third fastest but due to the crash wouldn't be able to start. Fangio/Klings Mercedes qualified fourth with the von Trips/Simon Mercedes seventh on the qualifying list.\n\nRace day was the 17th of September, 1955, and the 5th round of the World Sports Car Championship held a grid of 49 cars ready for the le Mans style start for an 84 lap run through some of the most demanding terrain available to the RAC. The weather did it's best to add to the difficulties by being warm, but threatening rain later. Their must have been an air of nervousness at the start as this was the first actual championship race since the Le Mans disaster and despite the steps taken to learn from that everyone was aware of the dangers of motorsports and of this circuit and conditions in particular. The spectators though, they were excited and looking forward to seeing another great duel between Jaguar and Mercedes.\n\nThings started to go wrong before the start in that the organisers lined up the cars in a somewhat random line most closely following something according to engine capacity as well as practice times, and another factor nobody seems to be able to identify. This placed the thoroughbred racing Mercedes' of Moss, Fanio and Von Trips back down the line behind the likes of the 300sl road cars. One of these 300sl cars was driven by one Vicomte Henri du Barry, who intended to drive the whole race himself and had allegedly been black flagged during qualifying when seen smoking at the wheel while trying to set a time! For consideration, Moss' fastest lap (which would have had him on pole in a normal grid) was 4m46s while that of Du Barry was 5m59s, That would have had his 300sl way back in 39th on the grid. Anyway, the vagaries of the Le Mans style start often saw the starting order change considerably in the first few seconds of a race.\n\nOn this occasion though Du Barry got away well, with Hawthorn, Moss and several others forming a group that got of to be at the front of the race with Du Barry causing a bottle neck as he acted like a rolling chicane with little intention of surrendering the middle of the road for anyone.\n\nAs the race wound it's way around the countryside of County Antrim drivers started to push themselves to make best time before the rain started. Drivers were pushing the limits of speed and safety and with the mixed up abilities within a few laps the inevitable accident occurred. If the accident was almost expected then the severity wasn't.\n\nMoss negotiated the cars ahead of him to lead at the end of lap one. Hawthorn was driving out of his skin to put the works D-type in second place on the road and Fangio, von Trips, Behra, Walker and Musso. Surprising everyone Colin Chapman was leading all the 2-litre and 1½-litre cars, including the works Porsche Spyders in his 1100cc Lotus-Climax.\n\nAs the rain clouds gathered overhead the storm clouds rose from the race track, once again ruining the Mercedes/Jaguar duel. At Deer's leap on the second lap a gaggle of cars converged and in attempting to negotiate a slower the hopelessly out classed du Barry (who was accused of being belligerent unconcerned with the effects of his driving on the safety of others), Jim Mayers Cooper T39 went out of control, hit a stone gatepost and killed him instantly as it burst into flames. William T. Smith, also facing the Du Barry conundrum, was suddenly confronted by a wall of flames and his Connaught AL/SR ploughed straight into the wreckage of Mayer's car. A marshal ran to the aid of Smith, who had been thrown out of his car, until a St John's Ambulance crew took over. Sadly the rising star of British sportscar racing, signed by Ecurie Ecosse for the 1956 season and rated by many managers, including Lofty England at Jaguar, died a little later as a result of his injuries. A flag marshal who was waving a blue flag at Du Barry saw part of the incident before he was hit on the leg by a loose wheel. Frederik Kretschmann, who was also being overtaken by the faster cars, had a close view of the flames; so close his goggles actually caught fire.... He pulled over about 100m up the road and jumped out of his burning car to watch it consumed by flames.\n\nJim Russell came into the catastrophe at around 130mph, blinded by 40ft flames and thick black smoke.\n\n“I knew I could not possibly pull up in time. Instinctively, I suppose, I pulled away from the flames and crashed into the left bank. Both my front tyres blew out and the wheels crumpled. \"I was still in the car when another came spinning at me out of the smoke. I jumped over the hedge to save myself as still more cars came on. I saw several speeding through the smoke and flames.\"\n\nKen Wharton arrived at the scene a few seconds later in the Frazer-Nash but despite having a little more time than the others still couldn't avoid being caught up in the disaster. He was to suffer burns and injuries. Also caught up in the mayhem was the Lotus of Peter Jopp and the Austin-Healey of Lance Macklin, both were put out on the spot. The once jovial Macklin had now been caught up in two fatal accidents in just a few months. He was badly affected by the experiences and retired from racing soon after. Du Barry carried on his merry way without any change in his behaviour or attitude until he was black flagged and disqualified by the organisers after lap 39.\n\nLap 2 hadn't finished with the race yet though as the D-type Jaguar of Robert Berry and Ninian Sanderson crashed out and Richard von Frankenberg had to induce a spin in his Porsche Spyder in order to avoid the bad driving of another competitor.\n\nThe sky once again cried it's tears onto the scene of tragedy and the drivers now had another danger to deal with; Rain.\n\nMoss had a 47s lead over Hawthorn by lap 10, with Fangio 2s behind him and closing in to pass. It took another three laps but Fangio did slip past Hawthorn into second place. Further down the field Colin Chapman was still humiliating the works Porches with Ivor Bueb in a Cooper-Climax 1100 also mixing it up with the Porsches.\n\nDundrod circuit was particularly interesting in that the long level section of track at the start line allowed for the cars to be electrically timed to work out their speed. Of course there was some disparity in that the fastest cars were accelerating throughout the measured kilometre while the smaller capacity cars were reaching their top speeds quite early on the straight. Hawthorn recorded 147mph and Moss 146mph and Peter Collins was able to coax his Aston Martin up to 138.2mph.\n\nOn lap 19 Hawthorn set a new course record with a lap time of 4m42s, 94.67mph average speed, although he was still not making inroads into Moss' lead. Fangio was not able to pull away from Hawthorn and let him pass back into second place, the old master happy to play the long game and keep a watching brief. Collins Aston Martin DB3s was catching Von Trips Mercedes but the young German wasn't making it easy. Elswhere in the race the Ferrari of Castellotti spun at Leathemstown crashed causing damage the left side that would take the Ferrari mechanics some considerable time to straighten out. When Castelloti pulled back out of the pits Chapman was coming along the straight and gained the benefit of a Ferrari “tow” for the next three laps.\n\nAround lap 25 the expected pitstops for fuel and driver changes started. Hawthorn handed over to local boy Desmond Titterington returning the Jaguar to the race in 3rd place. Fangio then stopped and pass his car to Karl Kling during a stop that lasted just 1m50s, but putting Titterington back into 2nd place. On lap 26 Moss' right rear tyre let go at 130mph slewing his Mercedes-Benz across the track and from bank to bank until he gathered it up again. Going as fast as he dared Moss got the car back to the pits but the de-laminated tyre ate through the bodywork and displayed it's canvas core to the world. After 2 minutes of frantic work the mechanics had not only topped up the fuel and changed tyres but made the fractured bodywork safe enough for the car to be allowed to continue. John Fitch took over the car and set off after Titterington who had by now swooped by into the lead raising huge cheers from the Ulster crowd.\n\nWhile Titterington was able to lap in times close to those of Hawthorn, Fitch was not able to get the battered Mercedes up to the times set by Moss. As the leading Jaguar pulled further into the distance Neubauer's plans seemed as tattered as the Moss/Fitch car did; and his driver pairings might well have been called into question. Peter Collins was also driving the Aston Martin to it's limits and not only went passed Von Trips but Kling too, pushing his way into 3rd place. The Ferraris looked all at sea with all three of the Astons ahead of them and an annoying green lotus riding on Castellotti's coat tails; all rather embarrassing.\n\nThe lead continued to grow so by lap 32 the leading Jaguar had a 54s advantage over the Moss/Fitch Mercedes-Benz and the Collins Aston Martin in a solid third place when he pulled in to hand the car to Brooks. Just then the engine developed a misfire and Aston Martin mechanics spent 5 minutes trying to solve the problem. Brooks did get out into the race but was hopelessly off the pace and had no choice but to retire the car. Fitch just couldn't match Titterington and intermittent rain wasn't helping and the time gap increased to over 2min's.\n\nMoss spoke with Nuebauer who now called Fitch in despite Moss only having had seven laps worth of rest. The car was refuelled and \"the wonder boy\" started out on his way after 2nd placed Kling and the leading Jaguar. As the rain relented for a while Moss tore into to track despite the very wet surfaces. He passed Kling and little by little reeled in the determined Titterington in the D-type Jaguar.\n\nAs lap 35 started the crowd, hushed by the earlier fatalities, remained at the circuit captivated by incredible sights of the fastest cars in the sportscar world going flat out, in terrible conditions, on narrow twisty roads. While the 2nd lap pile up would prove to be the very worst accident the RAC TT would ever witness it was arguably not the most harrowing. The racing action was about to be devalued once again. With the rain once again lashing the track conditions were treacherous. Richard Mainwaring was approaching Tournagrough when he lost control of his Elva-Climax which hit a post and bank and overturned at Tornagrough. Mainwaring was trapped under the car and apparently heard to be unharmed. Then the leaking fuel ignited and the trapped driver was burnt to death; a truly horrible way to die and an awful thing to witness.\n\nNeubauer had set Moss free of team orders and Moss continued to attack Jaguars lead, Fangio and Von Trips battling had with the Whitehead Cooper-Jaguar the Aston Martins, Ferraris and Maseratis. And Chapman was still making the 1½ and 2-litre cars look silly in his Lotus.\n\nLap 39 saw the pointlessness participation in the race of Vicomte du Barry when he was black flagged for “poor driving”. Rain was particularly heavy in the pits areas through the laps numbering in the 40s, but nothing seemed to slow Moss the \"rain-master” in his relentless pursuit of the leading Jaguar. Jaguar called Titterington in from that lead for fuel, oil and a new tyre. Hawthorn resumed driving but Moss was almost on the tail of the Jaguar and battle royal commenced. Moss, slipstreaming Hawthorn's car, moved into the lead on lap 56 and started building a time advantage over Hawthorn's Jaguar at speed that matched the rate of capture. Hawthorn just couldn't get near the times of Moss and found himself in a rock and hard place type situation. Should he pursue Moss flat out or defend from the pressing Mercedes 300SLR of Fangio and Kling? This dilema affected Hawthorne, who was to be the fastest lap holder at the end of the race and the gap to Moss shot up by the lap. 4sec's, 19sec's, 32sec's, then 65sec's but Moss still had to take the Mercedes in for ir's last pit stop. On lap 62 Moss pulled in and the Mercedes mechanics serviced the silver machine in a their usual slick manner. As Moss started pull out of the pits Hawthorn came past to a huge cheer from the crowd and regained his lead.\n\nAs the rain relented and the sun started to dry the track for the last 20 laps the race for the lead was becoming a procession. Moss' advantage in the rain was cancelled out and his chase after Hawthorn looked to be in vain. Interest started to turn to the other positions and classifications. The Chapman/Allison Lotus' consistency had seen them push the little car up to 12th place overall on lap 60 and they were leading the Index of Performance by several minutes. A broken oil pipe robbed the Lotus team not only of a high overall position, but also of a class win and of the Index of Performance. Lotus did fix the problem and get the car back into the race but gloss was off it for them. Other British cars still running towards the end of this gruelling event were the two Triumph TR2s, Flower and Llewellyn's Austin-Healey, the B.M.C. "
