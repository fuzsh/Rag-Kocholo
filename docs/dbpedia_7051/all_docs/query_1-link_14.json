We've picked four innovative achievements with Czech origins that deserve recognition.\n\nWhat do a former Secretary of State of the United States, the Special Assistant to several US presidents, and a former Mayor of Chicago have in common: they were all born in Czechia.\n\nHave you ever thought about how what you eat or drink may influence your perception? Had a cup of coffee this morning? Maybe a cigarette? Chances are, these could make you produce a piece of art different from what you would have created after a cup of tea with a biscuit. At least in theory.\n\nAbandoned after World War Two and repopulated again in the 1990s, this small village of Holašovice, Czechia, has architecture so remarkable that it made it onto UNESCO World Heritage Site List.\n\nEnergy prices are rising with no sign of stopping. Economic sanctions against Russia have closed off one of the largest sources of European energy. Now begins the debate over what to do. The answer is simple, and it comes from Czechia: Small Modular Reactors.\n\nIf you ever happen to be driving in southern Nebraska, located in the heart of the US midwest, you may come across the town of Wilber. And if you happen to be Czech, you will be greeted twice as warmly. That's because this is the Czech Capital of the USA, the cultural center of the Czech diaspora there.\n\nFounding father of Slovakia, L'udovit Štúr, was a national activist, linguist, codifier of the Slovak language, and undisputed national hero. His contribution was crucial to the formation of the Slovak nation.\n\nMillions of people worldwide wear contact lenses every day. However, not many of these people know the origin story of this simple-looking yet genius invention.\n\nWith continuous pushes from interest groups, the public, and the European Union for greener and more sustainable energy, the Czech government plans to build new nuclear reactors. But this is easier said than done.\n\nIt’s always good to know your neighbor. This is almost certainly the case in the village of Hum, Croatia, which boasts fewer than 30 current residents. Besides its tiny size, its other claim to fame is a secret recipe supposedly passed down by Celtic Druids some two thousand years ago.\n\nWhile cars made in the Soviet Union were often mocked by westerners, communist Bulgaria had a hidden gem - an electric vehicle with far superior capabilities to similar projects developed at the time by Ford and Hitachi.\n\nFollowing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, countries are scrambling to get their hands on massive vessels that can regasify Liquified Natural Gas into regular gas. These floating LNG terminals will be a big part of the solution when the EU moves away from Russian gas, but will Finland and Estonia be able to put them to good use?\n\nThe imminent NATO membership application from the two Nordic states will transform regional security in the Baltic Sea region, much to the benefit of the three NATO member states most exposed to Russian aggression.\n\nThe Polish and Czech governments have agreed to restart work on the Stork II gas pipeline, a project of key importance to Czechia’s ambition to rid itself of dependency on Russian gas.\n\nThe Port of Gdańsk, as the leading container terminal on the Baltic Sea, is slowly becoming a key transport hub in the development the 3Seas Initiative (3SI). In fact, the entire Polish coast, with its key transshipment ports. is turning into a so-called Northern Gateway.\n\nThe Three Seas Initiative Investment Fund is financing the development of solar power projects across Central Eastern Europe.\n\nHow far would you have to go to find an animal species different to anything you might find on Earth’s surface? If you are a skilled expert on caves and near Romania's Black Sea coast, 200 meters of underground tunnel could be just enough.\n\nFor a little over a year, Croatians and others living in Central Europe have had access to natural gas from a new source. Gas shipped in from across the world will help our planet from overheating and provide more supply security.\n\nEver since European countries experienced a sharp drop in Russian gas supplies through Ukraine to Europe in early 2006, people in Central Eastern Europe have been aware of the need to diversify the imports of natural gas.\n\nCOVID has created chaos in global supply chains - but Central Eastern Europe can paradoxically profit."
