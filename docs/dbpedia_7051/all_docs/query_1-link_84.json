        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nSince the fall of State Socialism, eight of the world’s 12 largest automakers have established light vehicle assembly plants in Central Europe’s (CE) Visegrad Four Nations (V4) nations: the Czech Republic (Czechia), Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia. This process began in earnest in the early 1990s, with the major foreign direct investments (FDI) of Fiat in Poland, Suzuki in Hungary, and Volkswagen in Czechia. The success of these initial factories then attracted numerous foreign auto suppliers to these areas, and later, more assembly plants.\n\nAlthough it missed much of the 1990s boom, the central location of Slovakia’s city-regions, along with their skilled, but relatively inexpensive labor force, have resulted in that nation becoming a prime production base for the export of automobiles to developed Europe during the 2010s, as well as to North America. Through brief review of automotive production related development in the Bratislava, Trencin, Trnava, and Zilina City-Regions (heretofore, the city-regions in the Bratislava-Zilina Corridor), and drawing upon World Systems Theory and research on the CE auto industry, this article examines whether or not Automotive Industry related foreign direct investment (i.e., Auto FDI) also has served to advance Slovakia’s structural position in the globe’s industrial division of labor from periphery to semi-periphery.\n\nFollowing a comparison of its automotive industrial economy with that of Wallerstein’s [1Wallerstein I. Concepts for comparative analysis. Comp Stud Soc Hist 1974; 16(4): 387-415.\n\n[http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0010417500007520] , 2Wallerstein I. Modern world-system I-III. New York: Academic Press 1974-1989.] and Chase-Dunn & Hall’s [3Chase-Dunn C, Hall T. Rise and demise: Comparing world Systems. Boulder: Westview Press 1997.] five types of semi-periphery nations, it finds that Slovakia’s position in the global automotive industry’s division of labor qualifies as a semi-periphery nation under only one of their typology’s categorizations - its fortuitous geographic location in the CE. This analysis also suggests that although auto FDI has transformed the city-regions in the Bratislava-Zilina Corridor into important loci for car production, it also has made the economies of its city-regions,, overly dependent upon core-based, foreign transnational corporations (TNCs) in the highly cyclical motor vehicle industry.\n\nBased upon this, the article concludes that despite Slovakia’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Gross National Income (GNI), and GDP and GNI per capita qualifying it as a semi-peripheral nation, the structural position its major city-regions now play within in the world automotive division of labor has not yet risen to this status [4According to spreadsheet data downloaded from the World Bank’s website, Slovakia had a GDP in current US dollars of $97.71 billion in 2013 (€70.97 billion) and a GNI in current US dollars of $95.77 billion (€69.567 billion). This gave it a GDP per capita in current US Dollars of $18,050 (€13,110), a GNI per capita of $17,810 (€12,936) and GNI at Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) of in current international dollars of $25,970 (€18,863) in current Euros. [Retrieved on July 23, 2015]. Available from: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator?display=default Currency rates to Euro were obtained from Oanada.com for December 31, 2013]. Rather, the role its major city-regions play, at least within the world motor vehicle production chain, now more closely resembles what may be labeled the upper perimeter of the periphery. In other words, they have achieved a position situated at the upper boundary of the periphery, approaching semi-periphery, but where peripheral-like economic relations have remained much more prominent than in most scholarly descriptions of semi-periphery nations, particularly the original Asian NIEs and today’s BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, and China [5Arrighi G, Drangel J. The stratification of the world economy: An exploration of the semiperiperhal zone. Review 1986; 10(1): 9-74. [Fern Braud Ctr].].\n\nIn the next section, the article will review some of the major theoretical perspectives examining core-semi-periphery-periphery relations. This will include a separate section focusing on recent literature analyzing auto industry production in the CE. It then will chronicle the post-1990s rise of motor vehicle manufacturing in Slovakia’s four largest city-regions, followed by the aforementioned section analyzing the area’s structural position in the world motor vehicle production chain."
