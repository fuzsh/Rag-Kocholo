England lost their ninth wicket in their second innings with eight wanted for victory. Tate joined Wilfred Rhodes and edged his first ball for four, but the fourth ball he received from Saunders bowled him. The patch of turf on which Tate dropped the catch is now in the pavilion lawn at Whalley Range Cricket Club, after Old Trafford lifted its playing area in August 2008.

British footballer Billy Jonas was killed in action during the Battle of the Somme today in 1916 at the age of 26. Starting his career with Jarrow Croft, Jonas scored twice in a Gateshead Charity Cup Final and turned down an offer from Barnsley before moving to Havanna Rovers in 1910. Jonas was known for his quickness and passing ability on the pitch. He once filled in as goal-keeper for an injured Jimmy Hugall in a match versus Nottingham Forest. He scored 68 goals in his two seasons with Havanna, and moved to Clapton Orient in June 1912 on advice from his friend and fellow Orient player Richard McFadden. At Orient, Jonas could play in almost any position, making several appearances in goal. He was sent off during a match at Millwall in January 1915 for fighting with the home goalkeeper Joseph Orme, an incident which started a riot among the 16,900 crowd that had to be quelled by police on horseback. Jonas was very popular with the female supporters at Clapton Orient – so much so that he was getting a bags of fan mail from the ladies by the week. Things got so bad that he had to put an official request in the Orient programme for the letters to cease as he was “very happily married to his dear wife Mary Jane”. At the outbreak of World War I professional football was suspended and Jonas joined the 17th Middlesex Regiment, the “Footballers’ Battalion”. During the Battle of the Somme Jonas became trapped in a trench with his Orient team-mate McFadden while fighting at Delville Wood. Under heavy fire, he said goodbye to McFadden, jumped out of the trench and was killed instantly. Having no known grave at the war’s end, he was commemorated on the Commonwealth Thiepval Memorial.

Dean also served as the chief choreographer for the Torvill and Dean team. Torvill and Dean’s free program at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, performed to the music of Maurice Ravel’s Boléro, became world-famous. They received nine 6.0 marks for artistic impression, (three more for technical merit for a total of twelve 6.0 marks) the highest possible score and the only time ever that an all-perfect score was achieved. It was one of the most popular achievements in the history of British sport, watched by a British television audience of 24 million people. Torvill and Dean turned professional after their 1984 Olympic win. Under then existing Olympic Games rules as professionals they became ineligible to participate in Olympic competition. In 1993 the International Skating Union relaxed the rules for professional skaters, allowing the pair to participate in the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer where they won a bronze medal. Torvill and Dean were admitted to the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 1989.

The explosion happened at 0125 local time during a rock concert in the Centennial Olympic Park, known as the “town square” of the Olympics. The square was used as a meeting place and as a venue for entertainment of the crowds not actively watching sporting events. Security for the Games – already billed by the authorities as the largest peacetime security operation for a public event in American history – was stepped up with extra bag searches and regular sweeps for explosives. It seemed most visitors were determined the attack would not stop them enjoying the Games and events such as boxing, diving and track and field attracted healthy numbers of spectators the following day. President Bill Clinton reacted defiantly saying the Olympic Games should carry on as planned to show the nation would not be cowed by acts of terrorism.

The expedition stopped over in Lyttelton, New Zealand to meet Bill Burton, who at 96 years old was the last surviving member of Scott’s expedition in 1912. Upon arrival on the frozen continent, Swan and his team spent the Antarctic winter at the ‘Jack Hayward’ base and then set out to walk 900 miles (1,400km) to the South Pole, arriving on 11th January 1986, after 70 days without the aid of any radio communications or back-up support and having hauled 350lb (160kg) sledges. Swan’s team had achieved the longest unassisted march ever made in history. Once at the pole, they received the bad news that their ship had been crushed by pack ice and had sun. There was much criticism of the adventure from the scientists working in Antarctica as time and money had to be spent in flying some of the party back out to New Zealand. However, Swan returned in 1987 with a ship to collect the rest of the team at ‘Jack Hayward’ base and to remove all traces of his expedition, i.e., rubbish and remaining stores. Three years later Swan assembled a team of eight people from seven nations for an attempt at the North Pole, the expedition was called “Icewalk“.
