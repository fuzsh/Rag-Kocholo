        "text": "FAIRBANKS – The Golden Days Parade this year features two Czechoslovakian imports that both traveled a long way to be here — Paul Gavora and his newly-renovated Tatra 87.\n\nMuch of the information here is courtesy of the Gavora family.\n\nPaul Gavora, of course, is a well-known Fairbanksan. He was born in the small village of Brezova in western Slovakia in 1931. At the age of 16, he was forced to leave his home and family after the Soviets installed a puppet regime in Czechoslovakia after the war. He went first to Austria, then to Germany, and finally to America on a United Nations boat for war refugees.\n\nIn Colorado, he met his bride-to-be Donna Tighe and in 1958, they made their way to Fairbanks.\n\nThe Tatra 87 is also from Czechoslovakia, named after the mountain range that forms the border between Slovakia and Poland. It was built in 1947 by Tatra, one of the oldest car manufacturers in the world. Tatra has been producing cars and trucks since 1897.\n\nThis Tatra 87 originated in central Europe. The Tatra, a luxury five-seat sedan, was called the “Nazi killer” and the “Czech secret weapon” during World War II because it was so powerful and aerodynamic that German soldiers had a tendency to kill themselves in it speeding around occupied Czechoslovakia. It could reach speeds of nearly 100 mph.\n\nEven today, nearly 70 years after it was manufactured, the Tatra 87 is a unique automobile. It is streamlined, based upon the design of the Tatra 77, the first car designed for aerodynamic purposes.\n\nThe car has three headlights. Its sleek, air-slicing curves are highlighted by a large rear fin. That fin helps divide the air pressure on both sides of the car, a technique used in later aircraft, according to Wikipedia.\n\nCombine that design with a rear-mounted, air-cooled overhead cam V-8 engine, and you have a truly unique car that looks like a zeppelin and drives like a speedboat.\n\nDesign elements of this car were copied by later car manufacturers, including Ferdinand Porsch. He was sued by Tatra for his design of the Volkswagen Beetle.\n\nThis particular car was discovered about 25 years ago by Paul Gavora’s brother Svetozar. He acquired it as an undriveable, rusting hulk.\n\nSveto was determined to restore the car himself and he tinkered with it for years. Fifteen years ago, Paul Gavora came upon the vehicle, lying in pieces in Sveto’s garage in Slovakia.\n\nIt took years, but Paul finally convinced his brother to sell the car to him. Then Paul and his nephew Martin Gavora had the car shipped to the original Tatra headquarters in the Czech Republic to be restored.\n\nThe result is a gleaming blue, rare antique car with all its original parts, including the original V-8 engine.\n\nFrom the Czech Republic, the newly-restored Tatra traveled by truck to Antwerp Belgium. From there, it was placed in a shipping container and made the long trip across the Atlantic, through the Panama Canal and up the West Coast to Seattle. There, Paul’s son Matthew Gavora put the car on a trailer and towed it up to Fairbanks.\n\nOther Tatra 87s are on display in museums and private collections all over the world. But Fairbanksans can see the local Tatra 87 in the Golden Days Parade on Saturday, driven by owners Paul and Donna Gavora.\n\nIt’s a spectacular way to celebrate the end of a very long journey.\n\nOrganised by some Tatra Freunde International diehards who regretted the fact that the TFI had become neglected, not organising a members’meeting in 2015 and 2016, the Tatra meeting in Mattsee (A) became a highly successful meeting.\n\nThe meeting was held in the small city of Mattsee, the place where the TFI was founded. With close to fourty Tatras from seven European countries attending the May 5-8 meeting, several members jumped the wagon and formed a new supervisory board, breathing new life into the club. The rally was contested by two very rare Tatras, both from Czech Republic: a T 77 from Prague and a T 17/31 from Ostrava. Anothrt surprise visit was made by a unrestored T 87 from Germany.\n\nThe two-day rally visited the highlight of the Mattsee area, including the city of Salzburg, the KTM works, a locomotive museum and last but not least Ernst Piech’s Fahrtraum Museum, where the grandson of Ferdinand Porsche himself acted as a guide for the visiting Tatra owners.\n\nTEILNEHMER MATTSEE TATRA-TREFFEN 2016\n\n1 Friehs, Rudolf A T 11 1923\n\n2 Steffen Dirk D T 57 Sport 1931\n\n3 Fanderl, Johann D T 57 1933\n\n4 Spiess, Erich A T 57 sport 1933\n\n5 Suchy, Bohumir CZ T 57 1sport 1933\n\n6 Müller, Jan CZ T 57 sport 1934\n\n7 Hoffmann, Helmuth A T 57 sport 1934\n\n8 Steiner, Walter A T 57a Halbcabrio 1935\n\n9 Frohberg, Thomas D T 57a Halbcabrio 1936\n\n10 Altendorfer, Joachim D T 57a 1936\n\n11 Engl, Hans A Austro-Tatra T 57/L 1937\n\n12 Smit, Kees NL T 57K 1943\n\n12A Toloch, Jiří CZ T 17 1927\n\n14 Pitsch, Oskar A T 30L Taxi 1928\n\n15 Veřmiřovský, Jiří CZ T 54 1931\n\n16 Brablík, Libor CZ T 75 1936\n\n17 Leitner, Helmut A T 75 1938\n\n18 Kasík, Pavel CZ T 77 1936\n\n19 Maralik, Aleš CZ T 87 1947\n\n20 Staffen, Alfred A T 600 1949 4 Vergaser sport\n\n21 Colloredo-Mansfeld, Jerome T 600 1952\n\n22 Litschauer, Josef A T 600 1952\n\n23 Mezzera, Mario I T 603 1961\n\n24 Forker, Peter D T 603 1962\n\n25 Forker, Steffen D T 603 1966\n\n26 Fährmann, Andreas D T 603 1966\n\n27 Holzinger, Bruno A T 603 1969\n\n28 Bieber, Ernst A T 603 1972\n\n29 Baláš, Stanislav CZ T 603 1972\n\n30 Kubizňák, Zdenek CZ T 603 1972\n\n31 Pirovano, Ferdinando I T 603 1973\n\n32 Meier, Ernst CH T 603 1975\n\n33 Beez, Gernot D T 613\n\n34 Carstensen, Svend DK T 613S 1987\n\n35 Kocisko, Rudolf DK T 613 1992\n\n37 Pierre Steichen L T 613\n\n38 Berger, René D Corvair Corsa 1965\n\n39 Pelikan, Klaus D Citroen DS\n\n40 Ivo Prochaska CZ T 613-5\n\nTrebing, Max D ohne\n\nHeinlein, Günther D ohne\n\nHenkel, Roland D ohne\n\nTEILNEHMER MATTSEE TATRA-TREFFEN 2016\n\n1 Friehs, Rudolf A T 11 1923\n\n2 Steffen Dirk D T 57 Sport 1931\n\n3 Fanderl, Johann D T 57 1933\n\n4 Spiess, Erich A T 57 sport 1933\n\n5 Suchy, Bohumir CZ T 57 1sport 1933\n\n6 Müller, Jan CZ T 57 sport 1934\n\n7 Hoffmann, Helmuth A T 57 sport 1934\n\n8 Steiner, Walter A T 57a Halbcabrio 1935\n\n9 Frohberg, Thomas D T 57a Halbcabrio 1936\n\n10 Altendorfer, Joachim D T 57a 1936\n\n11 Engl, Hans A Austro-Tatra T 57/L 1937\n\n12 Smit, Kees NL T 57K 1943\n\n12A Toloch, Jiří CZ T 17 1927\n\n14 Pitsch, Oskar A T 30L Taxi 1928\n\n15 Veřmiřovský, Jiří CZ T 54 1931\n\n16 Brablík, Libor CZ T 75 1936\n\n17 Leitner, Helmut A T 75 1938\n\n18 Kasík, Pavel CZ T 77 1936\n\n19 Maralik, Aleš CZ T 87 1947\n\n20 Staffen, Alfred A T 600 1949 4 Vergaser sport\n\n21 Colloredo-Mansfeld, Jerome T 600 1952\n\n22 Litschauer, Josef A T 600 1952\n\n23 Mezzera, Mario I T 603 1961\n\n24 Forker, Peter D T 603 1962\n\n25 Forker, Steffen D T 603 1966\n\n26 Fährmann, Andreas D T 603 1966\n\n27 Holzinger, Bruno A T 603 1969\n\n28 Bieber, Ernst A T 603 1972\n\n29 Baláš, Stanislav CZ T 603 1972\n\n30 Kubizňák, Zdenek CZ T 603 1972\n\n31 Pirovano, Ferdinando I T 603 1973\n\n32 Meier, Ernst CH T 603 1975\n\n33 Beez, Gernot D T 613\n\n34 Carstensen, Svend DK T 613S 1987\n\n35 Kocisko, Rudolf DK T 613 1992\n\n37 Pierre Steichen L T 613\n\n38 Berger, René D Corvair Corsa 1965\n\n39 Pelikan, Klaus D Citroen DS\n\n40 Ivo Prochaska CZ T 613-5\n\nTrebing, Max D ohne\n\nHeinlein, Günther D ohne\n\nHenkel, Roland D ohne\n\nSalzburg city centre:\n\nhttp://www.salzburg-hotel.at/en/city-of-salzburg/salzburgs-sights/\n\nSalzburg lake district:\n\nhttp://www.salzburgerland.com/en/salzburger-seenland/index.html\n\nKTM works:\n\nhttp://www.ktm.com/gb/\n\nVideo: Lokpark Ampflwang Dampflokmuseum:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5US_gS0HGjQ\n\nFahrtraum Museum Mattsee:\n\nhttp://fahrtraum.at/\n\nhttp://www.sueddeutsche.de/auto/museum-von-ernst-pich-im-namen-des-patriarchen-1.1747740"
