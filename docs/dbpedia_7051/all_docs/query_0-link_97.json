        "text": "The paper outlines the collecting efforts undertaken by the Jewish Community in Prague and its Museum during the period of 1942–45 as a form of systematic rescue, analyzes the collection’s postwar role, and examines its importance for the preservation of the collective memory and identity of Czech Jewry. Special emphasis is put on the fate of the Prague Jewish Museum’s collection within the context of the turbulent political events of 1948 and 1968, which produced two major waves of emigration that resulted in significant material loss and eroded the integrity of the country’s Jewish cultural, intellectual, and spiritual wealth. Using as case studies a few select objects that went missing from the collection during the war and postwar years, only to resurface recently in public or private sales, the paper elaborates the problems of murky provenance, which have engendered the widespread contamination of today’s globalized art market, and examines the fragile boundary between rescue and misappropriation, and ransom and settlement, two basic dichotomies posing fundamental ethical problems. The process of restitution and repatriation is featured not only in the context of seeking justice but as a means of healing and preserving the memory of a community nearly decimated by the Nazi genocide and the Communist totalitarian regime that followed.\n\nMy paper deals with the relations of Jews and non-Jews in Hungary after the Second World War in the light of the handling of previously confiscated Jewish properties. My presentation is based on a case study: after the mass deportations of 1944, the two cows of Mór Mermelstein, a Jew from Szerencs, had been re-distributed to non-Jews in need. Mermelstein died during the Holocaust, however, his son, József returned in 1945 and he tried to obtain his heritage through a legal process. The documents of Mermelstein’s case can be found in the archival collection of the Commissariat of Abandoned Properties, a state institution that was appointed to handle heirless and “abandoned” goods. In 1945-1946 a frequent exchange of letters, appeals, decisions, etc. went on, which provide the sources of my analysis. By reading closely these documents and emphasizing both their legal and historical contexts, this case study may shed light not only on the immediate relation between Mermelstein’s son and the two non-Jews, but also on the influence of all other actors that played a role in the shaping of Jewish–non-Jewish relationships, such as the Commissariat, political parties and politicians, the government. According to Michael Berenbaum, “the expropriation did not end in 1945 with the end of the Nazi regime but continued with the failure to make restitution to survivors.” This statement is true to Hungary as well; the lack of restitutions and the attitude of non-Jews towards returning Holocaust survivors were closely related. My case study may serve as an illuminating example of this entangled connection and it may reveal new details regarding the situation of homecoming Jews, their legal possibilities concerning reclamations, and the question and problems of restitutions. Paper presented on 9 May 2018 in Graz at the conference entitled \"Rethinking Jewish and non-Jewish Relations: Transdisciplinary Conference for Early Career Researchers in Jewish Studies\" at the University of Graz.\n\nThe postwar experiences of German-speaking Jews who were forced to leave Czechoslovakia or who desperately wanted to leave Czechoslovakia intersected with multiple migrations from and across the Bohemian Lands: the well-known forced expulsions of Germans from Czechoslovakia, the “voluntary” resettlement of German-speaking Czechoslovak anti-fascists, the Zionist-organized mass migration of Jews from Eastern and Central Europe (especially Poland) to the American Zone of Germany, and the migration of Jews from Subcarpathian Ruthenia and eastern Slovakia to the Bohemian lands. In contrast to a historiography that tends to study these migrations separately and adhere to national (and nationalist) categories, this article analyzes the entangled web of migrations and the agencies, ideologies, legal systems, and individual perspectives their intersection involved. As a result, it challenges several established interpretations of postwar Czechoslovak history, the Brichah (the underground movement dedicated to the migration of East European Jews to Palestine), and the politics of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC).\n\nPrior to Hitler’s occupation, nearly 120,000 Jews inhabited the areas that would become the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia; by 1945, all but a handful had either escaped or been deported and murdered by the Nazis. This pioneering prizewinning study gives a definitive account of the Holocaust as it was carried out in the region, detailing the German and Czech policies, including previously overlooked measures such as small-town ghettoization and forced labor, that shaped Jewish life after 1939. Drawing on extensive new evidence, the book demonstrates how the persecution of the Jews was the result of complex actions by German authorities in Prague and Berlin as well as the Czech government and local authorities. It also illuminates the individual and collective reactions and resistance efforts of the Jews in Bohemia and Moravia. “Whoever is working on the National Socialist persecution of the Jews won’t be able to ignore Wolf Gruner’s work.” • Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung “This study is stimulating, closes a gap in scholarship and opens up a wide range of new sources.” • Sehepunkte “It should be considered as the standard work on this topic.” • Historische Zeitschrift WINNER OF THE 2017 SYBIL HALPERN MILTON MEMORIAL BOOK PRIZE FROM THE GERMAN STUDIES ASSOCIATION, 2017 YAD VASHEM INTERNATIONAL BOOK PRIZE FOR HOLOCAUST RESEARCH - FINALIST Contents List of Illustrations Acknowledgments List of Abbreviations Introduction Chapter 1.

Those Left Behind and the End of the War Conclusion Appendix: Tables Bibliography Index\n\nFrom 1938, the year when the first anti-Jewish law was introduced in Hungary, until 1944, when Jews were brought into ghettos and then deported, Jewish properties were gradually confiscated and distributed to non-Jewish claimants. After the war, when survivors returned, this caused major tensions between Jews and non-Jews. In order to solve this problem, the Hungarian government set up the Government Commission for Abandoned Property, which functioned between 1945 and 1948. However, the activity of the Commission was gravely influenced by political agenda and the post-war disastrous economic circumstances. The government was unable to provide proper restitutions to the survivors, and soon after the communist takeover the matter was conveniently silenced. As researchers, such as Michael Berenbaum, pointed out, the “Aryanization” of Jewish properties constituted a part of a process, which continued after the war and which had a serious impact and long-term consequences on the lives of Holocaust survivors. At the same time it affected Jewish–non-Jewish relations, as well as policies concerning the re-integration of Holocaust survivors into society. Based on a set of case studies from Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kiskun County, this paper analyzes the continuity between confiscations and the lack of restitutions from a microhistory perspective, thus providing a deeper understanding of the hardships Holocaust survivors had to overcome upon their return. Paper presented on 15 November 2018 in Paris at the conference \"A Time of Openness and Possible Outcomes\" at Sciences Po."
