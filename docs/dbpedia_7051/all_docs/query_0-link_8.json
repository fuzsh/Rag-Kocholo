        "text": "FOR an American car enthusiast, the first sighting is often a chance encounter on the streets of Prague. There is a magical quality about the beast, weird and coolly beautiful at the same time. The American may be puzzled -- weren't all Eastern European cars small and boxy like the Yugo?\n\nIf the viewer is lucky, the car will be in motion and the purr of the air-cooled V-8 engine will reply, no, I am a Tatra, the streamlined Czechoslovak queen of the road.\n\nUntil the 1990's, vintage Tatras were little known in the West -- hardly a surprise, since they were mainly used by the Politburos and secret police of several East bloc nations, prized for their size, speed and good mileage. They were far too expensive for ordinary citizens, and attempts to export the cars to the West were sporadic and lackluster.\n\nWilliam McCoskey, however, managed to find and purchase the car he had dreamed of since 1957, when as a 5-year-old he fell in love with Tatras after seeing a T603 in Time magazine. \"It was so unlike any other car I had seen,\" said Mr. McCoskey of Taneytown, Md. \"From that moment I knew I wanted one.\"\n\nHe finally got his Tatra in 1993, having found one in Germany. Now president of a Tatra enthusiasts' group, Mr. McCoskey estimates that there are just 20 to 30 T603's and Tatraplan 600's in the United States and Canada; owners are unlikely to share the spotlight at any local show.\n\nThe story of Tatra is one of innovation, repression and vindication. The company got its start in the 1850's in Moravia (then part of the Austrian Empire, later Czechoslovakia) making buggies and railway cars. Auto production began with the Pr√§sident in 1897.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
