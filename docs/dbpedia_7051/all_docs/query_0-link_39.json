        "text": "Over the course of the semester, the students in HIST 4273 / JWST 4998 Nazi Germany collaborated on a class Digital Humanities project in the form of a timeline for the history of Nazi Germany. Each student contributed ten entries, all based on primary sources related to the topics of their individual research projects. Most of the primary sources came from the German History in Documents and Images (GHDI) digital archive of the German Historical Institute in Washington, DC, with additional sources from the German Propaganda Archive at Calvin College and other digital repositories and images from Wikimedia Commons. These primary sources then served as the basis for students’ analytical essays, which were posted to this website’s research blog. For a larger version of the timeline, click here. A slightly revised version of the timeline was published in the inaugural issue of the Central Europe Yearbook (2019)"
