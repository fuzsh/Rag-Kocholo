        "text": "For a Western car enthusiast, the first sighting is often a chance encounter on the streets of Prague in the Czech Republic. There is a magical quality about the beast, weird and coolly beautiful at the same time.\n\nIf the viewer is lucky, the car will be in motion and the purr of the air-cooled V-8 engine will reply, \"No, I am a Tatra, the streamlined Czechoslovak queen of the road.\"\n\nUntil the 1990s, vintage Tatras were little known in the West. They were mainly used by the politburos and secret police of several Eastern bloc nations, prized for their size, speed and mileage. They were far too expensive for ordinary citizens, and attempts to export the cars to the West were sporadic.\n\nWilliam McCoskey, however, managed to find and purchase the car he had dreamed of since 1957, when as a 5-year-old he fell in love with Tatras after seeing a T603 in Time magazine. \"It was so unlike any other car I had seen,\" McCoskey of Taneytown, Maryland, said. \"From that moment, I knew I wanted one.\"\n\nHe got his Tatra in 1993, finding one in Germany. McCoskey, now president of a Tatra enthusiasts' group, estimates that there are just 20 to 30 T603s and Tatraplan 600s in the United States and Canada.\n\nThe story of Tatra is one of innovation, repression and vindication. The company got its start in the 1850s in Moravia, then part of the Austrian Empire, later Czechoslovakia. At the time, the company made buggies and railway cars. Auto production began with the Praesident in 1897.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
