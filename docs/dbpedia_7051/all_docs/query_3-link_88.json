        "text": "We woke up this morning and shock horror, it’s raining quite steadily. Not good enough, we said. Let’s get out of here and find some sun. We were leaving anyway, but isn’t it great to coincide what is primarily a travel day with rain?? Today it was time to return Kermit to his home lily pad in Prague. We had to accomplish this by 12pm latest, and because we wanted to stop in at Kutna Hora (well Sedlec to be precise) along the way, it was important to get underway early. I mean who knows what the Czech roads will throw at us today. More road works, or even congestion in the city? Anything could happen. As it turned out, there were only a couple of minor slow points and we delivered the car ahead of cut-off at 11am. This left us with time to kill before boarding a train to our next stop – Bratislava, Slovakia. Here’s how today’s travel day unfolded.\n\nAs I said, it was an early start with breaky at 7am, and then at 8am in the steady rain, we loaded our bags into Kermit and hit the road. Here’s a couple of last minute photos from Hradec Králove. We never quite managed a lap of the main square, but then we could see most of it from our room! Oh well.\n\nWe got underway in awkward driving conditions this morning with road markings difficult to see. Following others through town is helpful when you’re not familiar with the roads, and can’t see the road markings. Once we hit the motorway, most of the drivers were sitting on or about 120kmph, when the limit was 130, so they were quite rightly driving to the conditions (with only the odd exception).\n\nOur one stop today was 60kms southwest at Kutná Hora.\n\nWe soon left the motorway behind and hit some country roads. And the further we went, the more the rain cleared. Here’s some photos typical of the area. Plenty of small villages to pass through, all a bit bland and run down, nothing unusual.\n\nRegardless of the rain, the drive to Kutná Hora went reasonably well. We arrived there at 9am, just in time for opening. Great timing because we were there before the day trippers from Prague got shipped in.\n\nOur actual destination is 2kms short of the centre of Kutná Hora. It’s the Sedlec Ossuary. (Open 9am-6pm at this time of the year, CZK90ea NZ$6ea). Upon walking up to the entrance the art work on the footpath gave us a clue that we were in the right place.\n\nWe walked through the gate to discover that tickets are purchased 150m down the road at the i Site. Off we went, and back we came.\n\nWhat’s so great about this place? Well, the Sedlec Ossuary is estimated to contain the skeletons of between 40,000 and 70,000 people whose bones have, in many cases, been artistically arranged to form decorations and furnishings for the chapel. No, I’m not making this up. Take a look!\n\nI thought that when you died the deal was to rest in peace, not rest in pieces!\n\nWhy are there so many bones here? What’s the go? Well, way back in the 13th century the Abbot of the Sedlec Monastery (Abbot Henry) brought a handful of earth back from a journey to the ‘Grave of the Lord’ in Jerusalem. He scattered this “holy soil” across the Sedlec cemetery, and whammo, it became one of the most desired burial sites for people from all over Bohemia and the surrounding countries. Everyone wanted to be buried here (and apparently 30,000 were). But soon they ran out of room and the bones were moved to a crypt to make way for the new burials.\n\nSo, what does one do next? Well in 1870 local woodcarver František Rint was employed to arrange the bones. “I may as well do it properly” he thought. So he did, and among other things came up with the bone chandelier (above), and the Schwarzenberg coat of arms (below), which includes a raven pecking at the severed head of a Turk. He bleached all of the bones in the ossuary in order to give the room a uniform look. His signature is still on the wall today – made of human bones of course. So, I guess all these folks are paying the price for wanting to be buried in the ‘holy soil’. They ended up inside on display glued to the ceiling! Umm, fail!\n\nWe also wandered around the outside of the Ossuary where the more recent graves provided a colourful display.\n\nWe spent about 40 minutes there, and the busiest time was when we left when about 6 others arrived. Perfect timing!\n\nBack on the road for the final 73kms to Prague, and yet another section of road under repair (on the right beneath the sign).\n\nNext challenge. Making our way through Prague to the Budget Rental Car drop-off point at Prague Main Railway Station (Praha Hlavní Nádraží). Well actually it was quite direct and easy. We filled up with petrol about 8kms from home and followed everyone else through town. Dark clouds were gathering once more, so we knew the rain wasn’t done yet.\n\nThe handover of the car was the quickest we’ve had anywhere. He just said “The car is fine”, marked the return paper as such, I signed it, he gave me my copies and off I went. I wasn’t fussed because we took a zero excess on this one to avoid any hassles (reviews I’d read suggested this might be a good option). We made our way towards the inside of the railway station, and just as we were to step out into an open area, the rain heaved down. Wooah! Two steps back under cover to dig out the brollies . Within 2 minutes it eased, and we continued.\n\nAs you can see, Prague Station is a very busy rail hub.\n\nSo we hunted out the pub and found a seat.\n\nDue to lack of photos today, I thought I’d throw in the beer menu. Note that our big 500ml handles were CZK66 (NZ$4.40). Not bad for the location. BUT… a 330ml Heinken was CZK69 (NZ$4.60)! I’ll take the Czech Krušovice beer any day, over a Heiny (sorry Mike) and get more for my Crowns as well! A no brainer.\n\nBeers done, it was time to go and find some food to take onto the train. Sure they have a restaurant car on the train, but the old NZ railway pies sprung to mind and the supermarket won. On the way we passed a smaller food and book shop. Should I get something to read? Perhaps a Classic car mag or maybe the ‘Gardening’ mag? Either way, I’d only be looking at the pictures!\n\nIn the supermarket we nabbed some fresh foot-long salad rolls, that featured gherkin, ham, lettuce, mayo and ham. CZK44.90ea (NZ$3ea). Job done! We only had 100 Crowns cash left to blow, so getting these plus a choccy bar exhausted the Czech Crowns.\n\nOther items that caught our eye whilst queuing for the check-out.\n\nTime check. There she is, due on platform 6 (EC173).\n\nTaken while waiting for our Hungaria EC173 train (which began its run today in Hamburg, Germany!).\n\nWithin minutes ours pulled in.\n\nWe departed on time at 1:50pm, and a 4 hour ride was all ahead of us! It gave Muzza some blog time for free, although there’s not much to cover today (which is why I’m starting to waffle). 🙂\n\nKath’s looking at her phone (same as any other day). There’s free Wifi on board. There’s a power point for the lappy, and USB ports for phone charging. All good. Speaking of free wifi, you can get it at virtually any place you stop at, be it a pub, restaurant, cafe etc. NZ needs to catch up.\n\nAs I type these notes on the train, we’re half way through the journey at Brno, and running 14 minutes late. Excellent by Metlink Wellington standards. There’s not a lot to see out of the window (that we haven’t experienced already while driving around). But if we did want to see anything it’s not that easy. See what I mean? (Taken at the second Brno station). The windows were filthy dirty on the outside.\n\nKath got bored and took a photo out the back.\n\nWe arrived at Bratislava at about 6pm.\n\nWe’re in Slovakia, home of professional road cyclist Peter Sagan who once again owned the green jersey at this year’s Tour de France. We arrived at Bratislava Hlavná Stanica (Bratislava Main Station) at about 6:10pm (20 mins late). It’d be fair to say that compared to Prague’s main railway station, it was like taking a substantial step backwards. The area was untidy and so were many of the inhabitants. With one exception – the nice lady in the news agent store who was quite helpful when I asked about which tickets to buy for the tram. At least she sold me the right ones! Just €0.70ea for a 15 minute ticket (which got us to old town) plus €0.35 for each big bag. So all up €2.05 (NZ$3.55).\n\nWe would’ve just hopped in a taxi, but I’d read about the notorious taxi rip-offs in Bratislava. The rule is never to just hop in a taxi that hasn’t been ordered over the phone. Do so and expect a €30-50 fare for a few kms ride. You won’t have to Google long to find out about taxi scams here. We therefore took the nice new tram #1 to the square behind our accommodation. We knew which stop to get off (Námestie SNP), and then it was a 3 minute walk to our accommodation. Easy!\n\nJust another couple of pics. After checking in we walked back to the square behind our building where a Street Food stalls were up and heaps of locals were out tasting the treats.\n\nAfter wandering around and looking at the offerings, the only one that caught our eye had a particularly long queue, so instead we walked up the street our hotel is on.\n\nWe couldn’t make up our mind so went to the supermarket instead. There’s a Tesco a block away. We purchased some goodies and returned to our unit. Our initial observation now that we’re buying goods with Euro, was that everything is more expensive than in the Czech Republic and Poland.\n\nYou’ve seen the new tram, here’s an old one. Tomorrow we’ve got a big walk planned around old town area of Bratislava. Until then, good night from Slovakia.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThis morning it was time to head south and back into the Czech Republic.\n\nWe planned two stops today on the way to our overnight stop in Hradec Králové. The first stop was 70kms south-west of Wroclaw, and just 50kms from the Czech border. Near the small Polish village of Rogoźnica (formerly a German village named Gross-Rosen) we stopped to visit the site of the Gross-Rosen Concentration Camp, the main camp of another network of concentration camps operated by the German Nazis in WW2.\n\nOur second stop was a little more out of the way, but we got there. It’s in the north of the Czech Republic and is the Adršpach-Teplice Rocks, a magnificent walk through some spectacular rock formations.\n\nBut first up. We’d not even driven 2kms up the road when we found something Metlink, Wellington may want to invest in to sure up its operation. An awesome photo taken by Kath as we were driving by. A full size loco poking out of the ground!\n\nSoon we had a little sniff of motorway to get Kermit into full swing. It was just a short stretch at 140kms today but you make the most of it.\n\nWe arrived at the front gate of the former Gross-Rosen Concentration Camp at about 9:45am, and didn’t leave until about 12:30pm! We stayed quite a bit longer than I thought we would. Have you heard of this camp? Well it was no small operation back in the day. At its peak activity in 1944, the Gross-Rosen complex had up to 100 sub camps located in eastern Germany, Czechoslovakia, and on the territory of occupied Poland. The population of all Gross-Rosen camps at that time accounted for 11% of the total number of inmates incarcerated in the Nazi concentration camp system. You may recall from the post about Oskar Schindler, that he employed Jews at the Brünnlitz labour camp. Well, that was one of the Gross-Rosen sub camps.\n\nCamps like Gross-Rosen may well be lesser known but this one is certainly no less significant, and serves to remind us of just how extensive, efficient and horrifying Hitler’s concentration camp system was.\n\nGross-Rosen was known for its brutal treatment of the so-called Nacht und Nebel (Night & Fog) prisoners vanishing without a trace from targeted communities. Most died in the granite quarry. The largest population of inmates were of course Jews.\n\nBefore walking around, we decided to view a 30 minutes video, and then walk through the exposition. Here’s a couple of snaps of the many things on display.\n\nBelow: Those responsible, and their fate. Note the massive number of staff they had here as at January 1945. There were 3222 SS-men, and 906 women guards. Their barrack were situated between the front roadside gate and the prison gate (2nd photo below). As with the whole of the site, only the foundations of the buildings remain.\n\nOnce again, the sign over the gates lies to visitors: ‘Arbeit macht frei’ (Work sets you free), although the administration here preferred to phrase it a more sinister way, operating the camp under the motto of Vernichtung Durch Arbeit (‘Extermination Through Work’).\n\nAccess to the granite quarry. More on that later.\n\nCamp trivia: Gross-Rosen Concentration Camp was constructed in August 1940 (by the first prisoners who arrived there!).\n\nIn October 1941 the SS transferred about 3,000 Soviet POWs to Gross-Rosen for execution by shooting.\n\nBetween 1940 and 1943 most of the camp’s population were Polish and Soviet POWs.\n\nBetween October 1943 and January 1945 as many as 60,000 Jews were deported to Gross-Rosen, mostly from Poland and Hungary.\n\nGross-Rosen was one of the last camps to be evacuated. By the time the camp was liberated by the Soviet Army on February 13, 1945 an estimated 125,000 inmates had been processed through its gates, 40,000 of whom never made it out alive. Today the former site of the camp serves as a memorial for those victims as well as a museum.\n\nIn early February 1945, with the end of the war inevitable, the Germans forced some 40,000 prisoners, half of whom were Jews, on brutal death marches to the west which lasted days; weeks in some cases. With no food or water, freezing conditions, and an SS policy of shooting anyone who looked too weak to continue, many of the former inmates didn’t survive and missed out on freedom.\n\nWe took a walk around. The foundations of one of the prisoner blocks.\n\nThe names of the Gross Rosen sub camps are on the memorial wall. There’s many more past where Kath is standing.\n\nThe plaque beneath the memorial says it all.\n\nThe place of executions. Enlarge the second photo to read more. There’s now a bunch of memorials, placed there in memory of people who died here.\n\nWhat’s left of the crematorium.\n\nBoundary fence. Electrified of course. No-one escaped from Gross-Rosen.\n\nThe Camp bell is still here. It was used to get everyone out for roll calls.\n\nPrisoners were subjected to 12-hour work days spent excavating granite from the adjacent quarry. They were given insufficient food rations and received violent abuse from the SS officers and staff who were actually awarded military decorations from Nazi command for inhumane treatment of the prisoners and executions! Enlarge the photo to read the text.\n\nDue to the deplorable conditions, Gross-Rosen was regarded by the Nazis themselves as among the worst of all the concentration camps.\n\nA museum well worth a visit. It’s a little bit off the beaten track but the roads leading to it were quite ok. Partly cloudy when we were walking around the camp, with a little breeze to keep the temp to about 23C I suppose.\n\nAt about 12:30pm we left Gross-Rosen camp and continued our journey south, reaching the Czech border within an hour.\n\nBUT upon reaching the Czech border, there was a policeman stationed there, preventing cars from entering the Czech Republic. Doh. We could see cars being turned around one after the other, so we parked up and walked over to speak to the coppa. Turns out his English was really good, and he was very friendly as well (so not your regular coppa eh Brent M, Brent H, & Spider!). 🙂 Anyway, he explained to us that today is a Polish National holiday (Assumption Day) and many Poles are out and about enjoying a day off, while others are observing whatever Assumption Day is. He was turning the Polish cars back, one after the other.\n\nA very cool thing to do in this area is to visit the Adršpach-Teplice Rocks (which is just a few kms across the border), and it was precisely what we’d planned to do! But the Polish folk had flooded the place. Virtually every car I saw at Adršpach had a PO plate.\n\nAnyway, the cop said that we’d need to wait about 30 minutes. We sat in the car for about 10 minutes when I decided to approach him again, to explain that we were driving a Czech rental car back into the Czech Republic, and our next accommodation is also there. I added that if Adršpach was too busy we’d just drive on by. He happened to ask where I was from, and was excited to hear I was from NZ. It was all good from there. He said with a smirk, that it’d be “ok to let one car through”. He told me to drive up to where he was standing. We’d exchange a word, and then we could go. We followed a few other cars towards him. The others were turned around (all had Polish plates). When we got to him and stopped, he just said “have a great day and enjoy your holiday”. Nice bloke. Off we went.\n\nHere’s a couple of border photos after our first chat to the cop. Btw this is a small back road border crossing so it was easy to take the pics. There was no visible ‘border line’ as such, so I stood next to one sign, and 10m away Kath stood next to the other.\n\nA few kms across the border into the Czech Republic – at a small village called Adršpach (pronounced something like ard-rish-pah, roll the 2nd r), we drove into the very full car park to see if we could find a space. It was 2pm and some gaps had emerged. So we decided to take a walk. Across the road one of the food joints was humming.\n\nMuzza poses beside some of the smaller Adršpach-Teplice Rocks which are part of a collection of limestone rock formations that cover approx. 17km2.\n\nWalking towards the ticket office I wondered if we were in the right place.\n\nTwo lines for tickets! But they moved fast enough.\n\nThe cost. CZK120ea is about NZ$8ea. Chuckled at the ‘No barking dogs’ sign.\n\nWe’d no sooner got in the gate and I spotted Steph D who’d obviously made her way over directly from Bali! Small world! 🙂\n\nHere’s a few photos as we walked through the trails among the rocks. Some of the formations were more than spectacular. Whilst it was busy at the very beginning of the walk, the crowds soon dispersed as we took the route which required some steep steps to be climbed. And being seasoned tower climbers we knew we were tuned for the task. Others would go in another direction where they’d simply return the way they came in. But for us, we were on the more interesting one-way loop.\n\nThe Gothic Gate.\n\nElephant Square (same below). Can you spot them?\n\nAt the Panoramic lookout.\n\nThese two looked like they needed a hand, so I offered to take a photo of them. And then I remembered I should be using their phones!\n\nThe Mayor. Well he’s on the left, and the Mayor’s wife is on the right facing him (and giving him a cold stare!).\n\nWhen you climb up shitloads of steps, you climb down them as well. Just remember to use the rails, coz many of the steps aren’t made for Muzza’s size 12s.\n\nWell folks, it’s now time to play “Where’s Kath?”. The clue is: Novus.\n\nAfter passing through the ‘Mouse Hole’ there’s this series of steps through a real tight gap in the rocks where we watched a biggish lady walk down after us with her arms outstretched in front of her (almost joining her elbows) so she could fit through.\n\nThe Red Indian face.\n\nBefore long we popped out into some souvenir, drink and food stations! We spotted a seat and nabbed it. A Czech coke for the driver, and wine for the wino. What a great walk we’d just done. Thoroughly enjoyable, in a perfect temperature about 24C, virtually always in the shade.\n\nWhile sitting there. Train!\n\nProbably the only key advantage of renting a Kermit. It’s easy to find him!\n\nWe left the Adršpach-Teplice Rocks behind, driving away from the crowds (there were still plenty coming in). Continuing along the same road we came in on meant there were no PO plates driving with us. 🙂 We had the road to ourselves for quite a stretch.\n\nThrough a small village we spotted a photo op and turned around at this bus stop. “Book” Club members would love to catch a bus here. They have books to read whilst waiting for the bus! But it does make you wonder how frequent the service is!\n\nHere’s the photo op. Kermit with another Kermit!\n\nWe weren’t too far from our overnight stop at Hradec Králové (pronounced with difficulty – Hrah(roll the r)-dits Krar-low-ver (roll the first r) when the traffic slowed to a crawl. Sheesh we’d already passed through two one lane sections due to road works (monitored by the usual traffic light set up). And now this. First the coppas had pinged someone, plus (as seen on the sign), the route we wanted to use was closed. So we needed to divert. One thing about driving around the Czech Republic. Expect road work delays everywhere. Many of the roads certainly need repairing so don’t expect the cycle to stop.\n\nWe rolled into Hradec Králové at about 6:15pm and parked up in the main square. Our hotel is right at the top of the square! We’ll be making our way back to Prague tomorrow to drop the car off, so we’ve just got an overnighter here.\n\nTrivia: Although there’s just a small old town here, the wider city actually has a population of 93,000. The name Hradec (the Castle); Králové (of the queen) was chosen when it became one of the dowry towns of Elisabeth Richeza of Poland (1286–1335), who lived here for 30 years having been the second wife of two (yes two!) Bohemian Kings, Wenceslaus II and then Rudolph I of Habsburg. Crikey, wasn’t one king enough!\n\nHradec Králové lies at the confluence of the Elbe an Orlice Rivers, and it’s not far from Krkonoše (the Giant Mountains), where the highest of Czech mountain, Sněžka (Snowhill, 1602m) can be found.\n\nThat’s our accommodation right there near the cathedral – in the green building on the right above a restaurant (which appeared to be closed). The dominating Cathedral of The Holy Ghost (1308) with its Gothic towers on the left, and the tallest landmark in the city to the right, being the 72m Renaissance ‘White Tower’ (Bílá věž, 1574). aka the clock tower. Not much “white” going on.\n\nA couple of snaps of the square while Kath went in looking for parking instructions. The Baroque sandstone column right in the middle of the square is the Marian Plague column (1715-1717) which as we know gives thanks to the “Virgin” Mary and other patrons for the retreat of the plague, but of course there’s no mention of why those same individuals let it occur in the first place!\n\nThe building with the twin towers is the Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary (built 1654-1666).\n\nWe moved Kermit into the secure parking behind the hotel, and arrived in our room to find this cracker view of the Great Square from our second floor window.\n\nTwo more photos and I’m done. First, a tiny square off the Great Square (on our walk to the supermarket).\n\nAnd the view at night, taken by Kath.\n\nLooking back on recent days, we both felt that we’d like to see a bit more of Poland, places further north such as Warsaw, Gdansk, Torun etc. Poland was put through tough times during WW2, and also afterwards during Communist rule, but we’re glad to see that it’s found its feet and is cracking on in a positive way. English speaking youngsters were harder to find here, but as always, we got by (as you do).\n\nStep count today: 14,365. Goodnight!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nOur stopover at Olomouc (pronounced Oll-oh-moats) was just a one-night transit stop on our way to Poland, so this morning before checking out we set aside a couple of hours for a walk around Olomouc old town (which is just two blocks away from our hotel).\n\nThe old town was rebuilt in the Baroque style after the 30 Years War when the Swedes rolled in and almost completely destroyed the Gothic styled Olomouc. First stop 2 blocks away is the biggest of the two old town squares Horní Náměstí (Upper Square).\n\nTrivia: In 1306 the young 16-year-old King Wenceslas III (Václav III) was murdered (stabbed) when the royal entourage stopped in Olomouc on their way to Poland. He was the King of Hungary between 1301 and 1305, and King of Bohemia and Poland from 1305. And the only son of Wenceslas II, King of Bohemia and Judith of Habsburg. Way out of his depth at 16 apparently. They never found his assassin.\n\nWoooahh.. Arrived in the Upper Square’s and at the Arion Fountain there’s a man trying to have his way with a dolphin! This fountain is actually quite new, completed only in 2002. And that probably explains the man’s fishy behaviour! Everything is accepted in the current climate, but I’m not so sure the kids need to be exposed to man/fish love. As you’ll soon see; they don’t really need more fountains in Olomouc?\n\nMeantime, also at the same fountain.\n\nAs you do.\n\nThe massive 35m Baroque styled Trinity Column with its numerous sculptures really stands out, I mean REALLY stands out. This is probably the most impressive of the Plague Columns we’ve seen (it has the biggest Baroque sculpture set in the country). Within the column is a small chapel with highly-detailed stone reliefs depicting biblical events, which we could just see by peeking through the door. Totally built by locals apparently (completed 1754), me reckons it’s probably due for a clean.\n\nThere’s a gilded replica of a stone shot lodged in the column to remind us all that it was hit by fire from Prussian cannons several times during the siege of Olomouc in 1758. At that time the locals begged the Prussian general not to continue shooting at the monument. Fortunately, he agreed, so it’s still here for us to see today.\n\nThe Hercules fountain (Herkulova kašna). The second oldest (1687).\n\nIt’s game time again. Yup, you guessed it. We’re playing “Where’s Kath?”. If you can see her in this picture then buy yourself a wine!\n\nThe white City Hall (first mentioned 1519) still has a bit of Gothic going on (if you could see it!). It sits right in the middle of the square with its 76m tower and houses an astronomical clock that was originally built during the medieval era (1517ish). Except you can’t see that either. A massive maintenance exercise has completely enveloped the building.\n\nWe decided to stretch the legs a bit and take the 1km (10 min) stroll to the Gothic cathedral that dates back to the 12th century. A couple of pics on the way.\n\nWe’ve seen these little bronze plaques before in Germany and in the Czech Republic. These monuments or “stumbling stones” commemorate victims of the Holocaust. They are placed on the sidewalk in front of the victim’s residence during WW2.\n\nIt was a warm walkabout this morning (the temp was already 26C), when we hiked our way down to the very impressive structure that is Saint Wenceslas Cathedral. Founded in 1107 and consecrated in 1131, it was originally built in the Romanesque style. Extensive Gothic modifications were made in 13th and 14th century. Above I mentioned that Czech king Wenceslaus III of Bohemia was murdered in Olomouc. Well it took place in a nearby house of the former dean of the cathedral on August 4, 1306. What are the odds the dean was in on it?\n\nThe cathedral has 3 towers, with the one at the back on the south side being the tallest at 100m, making it the tallest church tower in the region of Moravia, and the second tallest church tower in the Czech Republic. Massive.\n\nWe went inside to cool off. There was a christening going on and the baby was going nuts. The service was amplified over a microphone so that everyone could cop an earful. Quite humorous given the signs inside the church telling visitors to stay silent.\n\nMeantime a couple of Crusaders wannabes looked on.\n\nWe’d just stepped out of the church when guests were arriving for a wedding. Sooo….. here we have the wedding car of the day!\n\nMuzz was there to capture the bridal party. Christening out, wedding in. It’s all go at the cathedral.\n\nHeading back to the main square.\n\nBuilding art!\n\nBack at the Upper Square… another of the 8 Baroque fountains! Caesar’s Fountain (Caesarova kašna), the largest, built 1725. Caesar!? you say. Well, there’s a ”romantic legend” here that the Roman emperor was the founder of Olomouc.\n\nTo the south-east of Upper Square is (you guessed it) the Lower Square! And another fountain! Neptune’s Fountain (the oldest of the Baroque fountains – 1683). Neptune clearly prefers sea-horses.\n\nJupiter’s Fountain (Jupiterova kašna). Built 1707. There’s certainly an ancient mythical theme to these fountains. Quite a cool collection but I think we’re all fountained out now.\n\nAlmost! Looking across the back of this cool drinking fountain we see the Marian Column (Mariánský sloup). Built 1715-1723 as an expression of the gratitude of the Olomouc burghers for the end of the plague that hit the Moravia area between 1714 and 1716. This stuff is OLD.\n\nThere’s a 16th century Renaissance building opp Marian Column with cool corner portal decorations. A young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart lived here back in 1767 (he sure got around!).\n\nSome of the detail.\n\nLeaving Upper Square.\n\nApparently, Olomouc is famous for having the stinkiest cheese in the country. We decided to return to the hotel and check out before we found it! Plus it was time to hit the road. One last pic after loading up Kermit. Coppas! They were everywhere this morning. Mad ass looking cops as well. We saw two of them questioning a homeless dude. One cop had a Mohawk Mr T haircut, and the other a crew cut and tats for Africa on his arms. Add in the black kit and weapons, and aren’t we the tough guys! Wouldn’t have been out of place in a Mad Max movie or alongside Road Commander at his VTNZ WoF check. That said, it was good to see them patrolling the streets. We did note there was a fair bit of Friday night noise going down in Olomouc last night.\n\nGetting out of Olomouc without a car vs tram incident was a breeze. Soon we were on the road north.\n\nBut we had a side excursion planned 88kms up the road. Well, off to the north a bit. Through here.\n\nJust before reaching the north western city Ostrava there’s a small town called Hradec nad Moravicí, which has a chateau of the same name. We got out and stretched our legs and shot a few pics. This chateau has two distinct parts. The first structure you see is the neo gothic style Red Chateau which was built in the late 1800s.\n\nWino 3 is impressed by the gates.\n\nThe temperature is approaching 29C and in the sun it’s warm! We grabbed a drink. I had the communist coke (Kolofa, a kind of aniseed flavoured drink that was the Czech alternative to Coca Cola back in the day). Did I explain that correctly Tomáš? Kath (the non driver had a beer). This pic of the beer is quite important because moments after it was taken, Kath had one of those famous B family moments and knocked it over, losing 75% of it!\n\nNek minut Kath says there’s a nude man flying through the trees. I’m going WTF. She was right!\n\nThe other part of this site has an older White Chateau with a White Tower. This Renaissance chateau and its surrounding gardens took shape in the late 16th century, however its present form came after reconstruction following a fire in 1796. The white tower was added in the late 1800s. All very cool. We wandered around for about an hour before continuing our journey to Poland. There were tours here but felt we’d rather push on to Krakow. Here’s the last few pics from that stop. Btw, everything was free. You do however pay for tours.\n\nMr GPS took us cross country again, but this one was legit, and was nowhere near the dirt track forest roads of yesterday!\n\nWe went to merge onto the main motorway but there was a detour in place which cost us about 50 minutes. For quite a period we were stuck in behind this horse float. Ambyr… check this out. Looks like horses like coffee, cake and red wine! 🙂\n\nCrossing the border into Poland.\n\nSuddenly the roads improved! The Polish motorways are awesome. Big, wide, smooth, 140kmph limits (or more if you’re a local). A couple of photos to give the idea.\n\nOur first Polish toll gate. We had no local Zloty currency at this point, and offered Euro, but they preferred the smart card.\n\nTracking a Porsche, but not for long! 140kmph was too slow for him! We played the game and held back.\n\nHappy with the truck art!\n\nAbout 2hrs 30min after we left Hradec nad Moravicí, we rocked up to our accommodation at Krakow, Poland. Btw Krakow is pronounced Krark-orv (roll the first R). Upon arriving (about 3:45pm) we parked Kermit out the back and checked in. Our hotel is very handy to Stare Miasto (Old Town).\n\nFyi Krakow is the second largest city in Poland (pop. 770,000), and one of its oldest. It was capital of Poland up until the 16th century, when power shifted to Warsaw, so there’s plenty of history here. We’ll explore the old town area in a couple of days time.\n\nInside was a complimentary bottle of red, chocolates, and a massive fresh rose which Kath quite liked.\n\nOnce we got ourselves sorted, we wandered a couple of blocks to the square. Our aim was to get some local Zloty currency (the guy at the hotel desk tipped us off on a decent place to go to). Fyi NZ$1 buys 2.50 Zloty. Or in this case, 1 Euro buys 4.2 Zloty (4.3 if you’re lucky). Walking towards the square. A Kia cop car. Very tasteful.\n\nKraków’s massive 10-acre Grand Square (Rynek Glowny) was going OFF! Not sure what the occasion was but there were market stalls everywhere! And music was being played in several areas. There’s people for miles. Everyone has come to town to be part of the event. I’ll ask about it tomorrow. Below: Traditional music keeps a decent crowd happy. The mannerisms and singing of the lead bloke reminded me of Michael Palin at his peak with Monty Python. Gold. Here’s a few pics of the lads. The crowd were loving it.\n\nBtw Rynek Glowny is the largest of all medieval town squares in Europe, and has retained the same shape since it was drawn up in 1257. Just sayin!\n\nWe exchanged some currency (at 4.2) and returned to the square to look for somewhere to have food and drink. Right in the middle of the square we passed through the 13th-century Cloth Hall with its Renaissance-style market arcade. You could argue that it houses the oldest shopping mall around, because it’s been in business for 700 years! Today there a decent collection of ‘stalls’ selling all sorts of stuff for the tourist market. Here’s a few snaps from inside.\n\nAnd some detail on the outside with quite the collection of taches!\n\nWe spotted a spare table in a restaurant right outside Cloth Hall, and ordered drinks and food. A people watching spot for sure. A couple of photos.\n\nSome Zloty.\n\nA wine list. You work it out!\n\nThe next few photos show some of the stalls at the market, and there were heaps of them selling all sorts of stuff. Much of the crafty stuff was quite good, and we eyed up some cool stuff, but alas it was too bulky to cart back to NZ. There was plenty of food on offer as well.\n\nThere’s a new band of two on stage!\n\nThe 14th century Town Hall Tower (Wieża Ratuszowa).\n\nWe stopped at Carrefour store on the way home and purchased a selection of 7 different Polish beers (as recommended by the bloke in the shop). Muzza will chew through them over the next couple of days. Here’s tonight’s tastings. Both very drinkable. Bog standard beers.\n\nIn the meantime, Kath opened the lid on this wine we bought in Český Krumlov, where the guy in the wine shop openly admitted that Czech wines weren’t flash. Nevertheless he helped us suss out a dry white, and this was it (about NZ$19 for a decent one). It’s actually not too bad, but the German and French wines still win hands down.\n\nKath just told me we did 11,889 steps today, which, like yesterday, wasn’t bad given we were in the car a lot of the time.\n\nOk, I’m done for tonight. An early start tomorrow with TWO tours in a day (not ideal, but just the way things worked out). We’ll start tomorrow with a massive history lesson from WW2.\n\nCiou!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nToday we drove from Český Krumlov and as you do, took in a couple of stops along the way.\n\nThe traffic was kind of the norm. Following slow drivers (those driving on or under the speed limit), interspersed with double lane stretches where Kermit could show off, and then there were some parts where we wondered whether we were actually on legit roads! And then of course there were the numerous small villages where we must slow down to 50kph (drivers are very good at slowing down and observing the limit through these towns, even though you may not necessarily see a human or a local car on the road as you pass through them!).\n\nThe temperature today was a steady 28C, seemed hotter in those sheltered spots. Muzz has a glow on the lid (should’ve donned the cap!).\n\nStep count (while I think of it) – 12,696. Not bad given we spent quite a bit of time in the car.\n\nI’ll try and keep the notes short today. It’s been a long day, and we only arrived at destination Olomouc after 7pm. There’s also a decent drive ahead tomorrow as we move into Poland.\n\nOur first target today was the pretty little town of Telč (pronounced Tell-ch).\n\nOur day started when we woke Kermit from his 3 day snooze and drove 25kms north to České Budějovice, usually a 30 minute drive, but slower today. Then we branched east and after 26kms we passed through Třeboň where there’s fish at a roundabout! Makes sense, there’s a lot of lakes in this area, so a popular fishing destination.\n\nParts of the drive were nice like this.\n\nFrom Třeboň it’s about another 57kms to Telč, but a few kms short we couldn’t resist another photo opp stop at Horni Dvorce. I mean… is this really a thing?? Answer: No. Google Translate says Horni Dvorce translates to ‘upper courtyard’!! Phew.\n\nPassing through a random village, not unlike many others.\n\nMoving on. We arrived at Telč too early for lunch. So we wandered around its pretty square which is built around an iconic castle (rebuilt after a fire in 1530). The town wasn’t damaged in WWII, so the buildings are original. If you think the buildings are familiar, yup they feature in the header image of this blog!\n\nThere’ll be some double up photos here but who cares, its worth it. Colourful buildings in Zacharias of Hradec Square at Telč.\n\nFill your water bottle up at this manual water pump.\n\nThis unique house half way along the town square has a façade with a rare sgraffito decoration with biblical motifs from the second half of the 16th century. The paintings were only discovered, uncovered and restored in 1952.\n\nAlong a side street next to the building above, a bridge allowed us to catch this reflection.\n\nBack with the colours in the square.\n\nThe church with the twin onion domed towers is the baroque Church of the Name Jesus (Kostel Jména Ježíš), built in 1667.\n\nThere were market stalls at the north end of the square where Kath tried to sniff out a bargain.\n\nDachshund!\n\nAt the top of the square is the 15th century Church of St. James the Elder, with its 60m tower (seen in the photo a couple back). It was first built in the 14th century but (along with the entire western half of the square) was burned in a big fire. It was rebuilt as a two-lane late Gothic building in the middle of the 15th century. We decided to climb the tower.\n\nAs you can see in these photos, the 60m tower (with its 40 stone and 105 wooden stairs) provides awesome views. A couple of shots of the walk up. There’s some really tricky sections, steep, and then very low head room. Even Kath was crouching at times.\n\nThere are two bells in the tower: Jakub from 1602 and Marie from 1550. Yes, the bells have names! Can’t recall which one this is.\n\nGreat views.\n\nBack on earth. The arty shot.\n\nHalf way down the square on the castle side is this very decorated house that was bought in 1532 by baker Michal, who later became mayor of the city. In 1555, the house was rebuilt and decorated. Once again, sgraffito decoration was only discovered in 1953 when the house was restored. Above the window in the shield is the year 1555.\n\nIt’s much cooler to walk inside the arches.\n\nThe Czech equivalent of a buzzy bee?\n\nLet’s play a game called ‘spot the Škoda.\n\nThe late Romanesque Tower of St. The Spirit is the oldest surviving building in Telč, dating to the first half of the 13th century. Its original purpose was a watch tower.\n\nMore of the same. These buildings are awesome from any angle.\n\nWe stopped for a homemade drink. Kath had a ginger ale, and I had this raspberry concoction which had plenty of raspberries to munch on.\n\nIn this one is the sculpture of St. Markéta, the patron saint of the town (1611).\n\nThe Marian Column (Mariánský sloup) is situated in the middle of the square (built between 1716 and 1720).\n\nSoon before 12 we left for our next stop deep in the midst of nowhere – Pernštejn Castle. With that in mind we filled up Kermit. Petrol (95 is the regular, they don’t have 91) is approx NZ$2.16 per litre.\n\nAnother random town drive through. This one was a little bigger, and therefore better maintained.\n\nHere’s a few photos typical of the terrain in this leg. The last photo of the four doesn’t begin to show the tin pot tiny roads we encountered as we got closer to the castle, which is literally 100% in the middle of farkin nowhere. And this probably explained why we were quite probably the only two people at the castle not speaking Czech.\n\nPernštejn Castle sits on a rock above the village of Nedvědice about 40kms northwest of Brno. (Yup we decided to bypass Brno. It didn’t look that interesting). However, this castle does looked interesting, and it was. It dates to 1270–1285. Pernštejn is often called the “pearl of Moravian castle architecture” and represents a unique example of the late Gothic residence and fortified building.\n\nThis exceptionally well-preserved medieval castle was the seat of the powerful lords of Pernštejn. The original simple layout of the castle has been lost in a maze of the renovated buildings.\n\nHere’s a map of the castle.\n\nAnd, without too much commentary, here’s our approach to Pernštejn Castle.\n\nWe bought tickets for the 50 min ‘From the Gothic to the 20th century’ short tour. There’s no English tour, so we were given English notes to read, while we heard our tour guide (below) give everyone else an elongated extended version in Czech, complete with humour.\n\nOfficially there were no photos to be taken inside. This one is on top of the lookout tower which is connected to the main building by a wooden bridge.\n\nWalking across the wooden bridge.\n\nPeople started pinging off photos, so I joined in. These next 3 are in the banquet hall.\n\nTook this photo of a young guy with an older face. It was explained at our last castle visit that they painted the young folk with older faces because they thought that if they painted them ‘as they were’ then they would die young.\n\nThese two pics are in a bedroom. Note the door in the wall (to the loo).\n\nOther random rooms.\n\nOn the road again. Sheesh, the first part of this leg of the journey soon found us on a lumpy dirt road through a forest! After a few kms we were seriously wondering where the hell we were. We only saw one car coming the other way. I thought the GPS was taking the piss. It was a shocker of a road, and gave Kermit’s suspension one helluva workout. We eventually (and thankfully) popped out onto this ‘smoother’ section.\n\nAnd then onto roads that looked like this. These were really bad sealed roads. There was no loose gravel, just patched up road that was as lumpy as you’d get. We bounced for miles. Full concentration to stay on the road, especially when oncoming traffic was passing (these roads were narrow).\n\nWell I did say the castle was in the wops, and believe me, you can’t get much more isolated. When we finally reached some form of civilisation we were held up for a while waiting to cross the rail track. So Muzz snapped the offending party. A big ass goods train.\n\nWe eventually reached our destination of Olomouc just after 7pm. We’re now out of Bohemia and into the eastern ‘province’ of Moravia. Olomouc was once its capital. It’s just an overnighter here, so I’m keen to post this page and get some kip. We did however dart out for dinner, after figuring out why we were a tad hungry, and that was because we didn’t actually have any lunch! First up drinks. Kath found a nice Riesling and Muzza had a Mustang beer. (We managed a second round as well, just sayin’!).\n\nSnapping the food today coz we both thoroughly enjoyed what we ordered. Muzza keeping it simple with this delicious burger. Haven’t had one this good for some time. The sauce for the chips was awesome as well. Homemade & spicy.\n\nKath had a chicken risotto type offering, can’t recall exactly what it was called, you work it out. She enjoyed it.\n\nMore beer!\n\nThat’ll do for today, must catch some z’s!!!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWell it was a lazy old day today. Chilling out, enjoying the sun, and sampling a few more brews. There was just one ‘official’ visit on the agenda. Read on.\n\nFirst up, breaky at about 8am, followed by the traditional stroll through old town Český Krumlov. And then we were off to the castle complex again.\n\nHere’s the downstream angle off the Barber’s Bridge (Lazebnický most).\n\nSuddenly we approached a strong candidate for ‘hat of the day’. Running the Ed Hillary look, this one held off all-comers for the entire day.\n\nSoon were at the castle’s Bear Moat, and Yogi was on high alert.\n\nThe sgraffito wall in courtyard 2.\n\nA different angle on the Upper Castle.\n\nLooking out to the arched Cloak Bridge.\n\nWow, Hashim Amla’s ancestor cast in stone on Cloak Bridge. But then I could be wrong.\n\nHands down the outfit of the day. Kath was sooo envious.\n\nLooking along the back of the castle from courtyard 5.\n\nWe’ve got our tour tickets, and we’re killing a few minutes at the view point through the door in the wall that we visited yesterday.\n\n‘Car’ of the day today, on account of a lack of cars!\n\nAnother ‘must-see’ at Český Krumlov Castle is the 17th-century Baroque Theatre (10am-5pm), the best-preserved Baroque theatre in Europe. There’s only two like this left in Europe (the other is in Stockholm), but this one is the best preserved. The building is original and it complete with orchestra pit, stage, machinery, sets, librettos, props, costumes etc all preserved. It’s even got old wooden machines that simulate driving rain, strong wind, and thunder. Tours are 45 mins (max 20 people, we had 14). CZK380ea NZ$25ea. (Czech’s pay 200Kn!). Another opportunity to rip off people from other countries!\n\nAnyway, here’s a few snaps. The ridiculous ‘no photo’ thing was not enforced here.\n\nIt’s difficult to make out in the dim light but this place was awesome. Here’s a closer look of the present stage set-up, which is the temple scene, being one of a dozen scenes available. For this set-up the stage is nearly 15 metres deep. There’s about a dozen panels on each side that give a 3D effect for the audience. A change of scene only takes 10-12 seconds. They showed a 15 minute video with the finer detail.\n\nTrivia: They still have over 600 original costumes here!\n\nA few more shots.\n\nBack into courtyard 4 and the tour groups have arrived!\n\nThis time we decided to exit the castle complex via the main western gate (seen at right). This view is on the outside.\n\nDown the street to the baroque St. Jost Church (dates from 1334).\n\nTo escape the crowds (mainly guided tour groups) we headed for the south side of the loop and across the bridge. A very popular activity is to raft, or kayak, or canoe along the Vltava River from point A to point B (where ever those points are. Actually, point A is just a smidgen upstream from here.\n\nHands down classiest hat of the day.\n\nWe walked upstream a little to check out one of the two water runs that splits the change in the river level. There’s always a possibility of a wipe out here, so we hung around a bit.\n\nNo issues for this family in the bigger raft.\n\nBut this looks like trouble! 🙂\n\nOk this was thirsty work so we looked for a drinking position.\n\nAnd here’s the view. A great ‘people in boats’ watching spot.\n\nHere comes the drinking boats. Plenty of supplies on board as well (disguised in soft drink bottles). Having a ball.\n\nTattoo overload of the day goes to this crew.\n\nWhere the ‘ridiculous T-shirt of the year’, and runner up in ‘hat of the day’ was spotted by Kath. I mean WTF.\n\nMeanwhile a big fella was enjoying the river, battling it out with a local ‘Steady the Ship’ fan.\n\nIt was time to head back to base and clean up some beer and wine from our fridge. A couple of snaps on the way.\n\nAnd now it’s beer & wine o’clock outside our unit. A cracker day in the sun catching some rays. Detailed photos withheld. 🙂 Temperature about 28C.\n\n<Pause> Heading out for dinner! Back soon.\n\nWe’re back! (like you even noticed!). Here’s a couple of wrap up pics. Once again we weren’t certain on where to dine tonight (other than somewhere different from last night). So we hit up the south side of town. First stop was here, but because Kath couldn’t get any sense out of the head waiter we moved on.\n\nA late contender for actual ‘car’ of the day. How the hell it managed to wiggle through the old town is a mystery.\n\nWe found a river side joint (can’t recall the name). The menu looked ‘ok’, and it turned out to be better than the service. Actually, that’s a bit harsh. The service was was prompt and efficient but the personality was lacking. It only takes a smile! For the record, here’s the his & hers photos.\n\nAnd suddenly we’re done. Full as a boot, and on top of that we’ve probably done enough drinking for today! Here’s my last pics from old town.\n\nJust the 12,540 steps today, and of course I forgot to add yesterday’s count which was 14,163.\n\nDobrou noc!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAn early breaky was the order of the day this morning (about 7:45am) just because we were up and ready. It was the usual European breaky with ham, cheeses, breads, boiled eggs (in shell), cereals etc. This early breaky meant we could wander down into old town Český Krumlov before the masses arrived, and believe me they do arrive! Many 30-strong Asian tour groups were spotted. It’s always interesting to watch as they dart around taking photos of anything and everything. And I mean anything! I thought I took plenty of photos, but god knows how these guys deal with the 1000s they must take each day. It’s also fun to check out their dress sense, which usually differs from virtually all other visitors. Moving on….\n\nJust like Prague, Český Krumlov is bisected by the Vltava River, which flows right through the Czech Republic. Here at Český Krumlov a narrower and much more sedate version of the river almost completely loops the old town, which provides quite the view from the castle on the hill. So I’ll start with this virtual drone photo to show that loop. I’ve also marked our accommodation. We chose the Pension Gardena Guest House due to its proximity to old town (just 400m to the square!) and its parking facility. The arrow to the left shows the main building where we have our breaky, and the other arrow points to where they biffed us – i.e out the back! But! We’re in the best spot, with a view of the castle and plenty of outdoor space to chill with a drink. Ideal.\n\nWe walked down Horni street (hold the comments!) to the first view point. Ordinarily this area is chocka with small people holding selfie sticks.\n\nWalking into the small old Town Square (Náměstí Svornosti) there’s a mix of Renaissance and Baroque homes and almost no people! Plus the Marian Column (1714) that I mentioned yesterday.\n\nNow for some good news I read a few months back. Apparently, the plastic fast food specialists i.e. McDonald’s, tried three times to get a position in the square but were turned away each time. Thumbs up to the local council, and long may those applications be rejected!\n\nČeský Krumlov was spared from any damage during WW2, so what we have here is the real deal, including those two coppa cars from yesterday. I guess they were too pissed to drive home last night.\n\nThe 16th century Town Hall displays the coat-of-arms of two prominent past owners on its façade: the Eggenbergs on the left, and of the Schwarzenbergs on the right.\n\nHeading down towards the bridge.\n\nČeský Krumlov Castle was first on the agenda this morning. The aim was to get there before the day-tripper tours from Prague arrived. It certainly is the dominant structure here and keeps a close eye on the old town down beneath it.\n\nA view of part of the castle complex from Barber’s Bridge (Lazebnický most) which crosses the Vltava River beneath the Bell tower.\n\nWe made our way into the castle grounds towards the ticket office. First stop, the bears. Brown bears reside in the moat between courtyards 1 and 2 and have done since the 16th century. Animal lovers whinge about this, as they do about any animal in captivity, but the bears look healthy enough in what is really just a medieval zoo enclosure. Could be worse – e.g. a fish in a bowl, or a hippo in your spa pool! The stone bridge over the deep moat replaced the original wooden draw-bridge in 1647. There are currently 3 bears down there. We saw two of them, one was particularly active\n\nCourtyard 2 before the crowds. We parked ourselves in the corner for 15 minutes with a Chinese family, whilst waiting for the ticket office to open at 9am.\n\nfyi Here’s a map of the castle complex. The above photo was taken from ref D.\n\nWe climbed the Castle Bell tower (open 9am-5:15pm), the cost CZK150ea (NZ$10ea). Get up here early to beat the tour groups and especially to avoid traffic problems on the one way sections of steps. The panoramic views of the old town and the river from the top of the bell tower are superb. There’s only 162 steps (some reasonably steep, so care is required). Quite a short hike compared with most towers.\n\nBell tower Trivia: 54m high, 86m above the river, max diameter 12m, ground floor dates from early 13th century, 2nd floor 14th century, 3rd floor is part of the Renaissance belfry, the oldest bell (gothic) dates to 1406, and weighs 1800kgs. Other bells date to 1406, 1671, and 1744. The arcade gallery at the top was added in 1581.\n\nA ticket to the Bell Tower also gives access to a museum beneath it. And quite a good one it was as well. Far to much to rabble on about here so I won’t. We spent some time in there, just us, others missed out.\n\nThere’s plenty of notes to read on the displays. Kath was the narrator. I’ll throw this painting in because it’s that of Pauline von Arenberg (1774-1810), wife of Joseph Schwarzenberg. She was killed in a fire at a ball which was held in Paris in 1810 on the occasion of Napoleon’s wedding.\n\nWhich is a great intro for some Castle owner Trivia: After the Lords of Krumlov died out in 1302, Jindřich I (Rosenberg) took over the Krumlov Castle and he transferred the family residence here. Krumlov Castle then became the residence of the Lords of Rosenberg for the next 3 centuries until about 1600. Btw the Rosenbergs ranked among the most significant, and influential of the Czech noble families.\n\nDuring the period from 1551 to 1592, Wilhelm of Rosenberg (or ‘Bill’ to his mates) was the ruler of Český Krumlov, and unofficially ‘vice-king’ of Bohemia. He carried out a Renaissance rebuilding of the Gothic castle, and it was during his rule that the town changed its basic appearance as well.\n\nIn 1601 Peter Vok, the last male member of the Rosenbergs sold the domain including the town of Český Krumlov to the Emperor and King of Bohemia Rudolf II von Habsburg. But it didn’t last long in the hands of ‘royalty’ because in 1622 Emperor Ferdinand II von Habsburg gifted the domain (yes gifted it!) to Johann Ulrich von Eggenberg to reward him for his services.\n\nEggenberg remodelled the castle and the town houses in the Baroque style. The castle remained in the Eggenberg family through to 1719 when it passed, through inheritance, to Marie Ernestine’s nephew Adam Franz von Schwarzenberg. And so it remained in the Schwarzenberg family until 1947, when the Schwarzenberg property, including Český Krumlov, was transferred to the Czech provincial properties, and in 1950 it became the property of the Czechoslovak State.\n\nMoving on. Courtyard 2 building art.\n\nAfter securing tickets for the English guided tour #1 from grumpy Mrs Carrot UpperDate, we only had to kill 20 minutes before the tour started, so settled down in courtyard 3. By this time, many other tour groups were coming and going. It’s all go. Pics in courtyard 3.\n\nThe tour was awesome. Great commentary. Just 9 of us on the tour (compared with the German speaking group before us who had about 40!). We had 2 Aussies, us, 2 Chinese, and 3 others from ?? Fortunately for you, but unfortunately for us, no photos were allowed inside. Such a shame because this was an impressive insight into the standard of living and everyday life in an aristocratic residence in the Renaissance and Baroque periods. BUT, we could take a couple of photos from an open window!\n\nAfter leaving the tour and passing through courtyard 4 we made our way to a door in the wall which provides access to THE photo taking spot.\n\nAnd time for a beer!! (11:30am, but it’s 5 0’clock somewhere!).\n\nPeople watching can be fun.\n\nNext we made our way up to the massive baroque gardens. Now listen up mothers and fathers. If your daughter feels that she really, really, really wants to hop into the summer trend of short shorts, please check the back view. The front may look ok, but trust me, the rear ends below were a lot worse than the photo shows! (btw, these two weren’t the only ones).\n\nMeantime, the centre piece of the castle’s 17th-century baroque 11-hectare (27 acres) garden: Zámecký Zahrada (Castle Garden) aka Memorial Park, is the Kaskádová fontána (Cascade Fountain, 1750).\n\nIt’s not overly obvious in this photo, but the lawns needed a serious mowing!\n\nWe descended via the path in behind the castle and passed through the arch to the river.\n\nPlenty of boating action on the river. Maybe tomorrow for us.\n\nWeaving our way through the little old town.\n\nIt’s beer & wine o’clock.\n\nFamily takes their unicorn for a swim.\n\nDown by the river Kath spotted a hunky fisherman. As we were passing he just happened to reel in this monster (2nd pic below). We all had a good chuckle and he threw it back in.\n\nBy this point, we’d done enough wandering around. Kath had this great idea to head back to base for a drink in the sun. On the way we popped into the Church of St. Vitus which dates to the early 15th century (however this ‘modern’ tower replaced the earlier onion domed version in 1893-94).\n\nMedieval gravestones have been cemented into the wall opposite the entrance.\n\nBeer and wine time!\n\nWell, after a warm day today (a nice 26C) we had a splash of rain late this avo, but as usual it stopped soon after starting. Jump forward to about 8pm, when we decided to head back into old town and find somewhere to eat. But first, the car of the day today (on account of seeing F all else) is Kermit! BUT! Can you spot him in this photo??? Clue: Chasing Kath.\n\nAfter looking at numerous menus, we settled on a little place right alongside the river near the bridge to the castle. A scoff’s a scoff. 2 mains, 2 desserts, a wine and a beer for CZK784 (NZ$52) is more than tidy in a location like this.\n\nAfter which we looped around the old town and back to base. Last images of the night below. Dobrou noc!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nToday we left the lovely town of Plzeň and its brewery and drove south-east to Český Krumlov. On the way we planned a couple of stops. The first was after about 130kms and it was at the little town of Hluboká in southern Bohemia where we visited a National Cultural Monument of the Czech Republic that is said to be the most beautiful castle in the country: Hluboká Castle.\n\nWhat do we remember most about the drive? It was farkin slow. Aside from one stretch of double lane motorway where we wound Kermit up to 130kph, the rest was a dead set yawn of a procession behind the slowest common denominator, with few options for overtaking. Not to mention we’d have to pass through a tiny neglected looking village approx every 2 to 3kms! And this of course meant slowing down to 50kph without exception.\n\nHere’s a couple of photos snapped on the way. Note: I’ve picked out the best looking village photos, the first one shown here was actually ok. The rest had weeds growing wherever weeds could grow, and they were thriving. Many dilapidated buildings were seen. Humans, and animals were scarce. But slow drivers were out in force!\n\nWe found a car park in the main street of Hluboká (CZK90 or NZ$6 p day). The very friendly parking warden on her bicycle, roams up and down the main street to see that everyone pays (she also issues the parking tickets). The walk to the castle was a steady uphill grind for 15 minutes.\n\nSpotted in the bush on this walk was this.\n\nOf more concern was what we saw inside!\n\nCheck this out! Hluboká Castle.\n\nThe very impressive Hluboká Castle started life in the 13th century as a Gothic style castle and a military fortification for Bohemian kings. But over the centuries it was restored several times before, in the 19th century, Johann Adolf II von Schwarzenberg ordered the castle to be completely rebuilt in the Neo-Gothic architecture style we see today.\n\nThe aristocratic Schwarzenbergs lived there until 1939, when the last owner had to flee the country to escape from the Nazis. After the war, from 1947, the state took on responsibility for its upkeep. The castle has 140 rooms and 11 towers. Open 9am-5pm in August.\n\nIt’s not that she was bored with the castle, but Kath spotted this hairy ranga caterpillar crawling through the grass. Bizarre, and great to see ranga representation in the world of critters!\n\nFrom what I read the tours aren’t worth the effort, and for some weird reason, there’s also no photos allowed inside which sucks. Because we’ve been spoiled with far better interiors in other castles we’ve visited, we decided to admire this one from the outside. Here’s a taste. First up we strolled into the inner courtyard.\n\nIt seems the former owner quite liked hunting.\n\nThis place is extremely popular, and not a word of English was heard.\n\nThe door handle on one of the massive front doors.\n\nAdjacent to the castle was a massive building that contained works of art. This one looks like a naked Mahe Drysdale on the erg. What do ya think Steph C?\n\nThis naked woman needed some hair so I managed to help her out.\n\nHere’s a few shots of the castle from other angles as we looped around it.\n\nA restaurant that we passed on the way back down the hill.\n\nMain street Hluboká, while we had an ice cream and a drink.\n\nFortunately the 10km drive from Hluboká to our next stop at České Budějovice was much more bearable. České Budějovice (pronounced something like Chess-key Boarda-ya-veetsa) with a population of 95,000 is the capital of South Bohemia. Another town, another brewery! And why not. We’re in the Czech Republic where its dedicated population consumes more beer per capita than any other country in the world (142 litres per person per year!). And there’s a distant gap to the second placed country. For 23 years straight, they’ve topped the table. Who needs other records when you’ve got this one? And it’s our duty as visitors to assist with keeping the Czech’s on top.\n\nWe parked up on a side street opposite the Budweiser Budvar Brewery (Budějovický Budvar) well in advance of the 2pm tour. There’s no online bookingsfor this brewery, and they only run the 1 hour tours if they have at least 5 people (50 max). So get there say 30 minutes ahead of time and hope for the best. There was no problem with tour numbers today. CZK150ea NZ$10ea.\n\nTo kill off time we visited their museum. Plenty of videos, commentaries and exhibits to keep us occupied.\n\nThe reception & gift shop area.\n\nWhile waiting I lined up some Czech Crowns for ya!\n\nBefore I show some tour photos, it’s important to understand the story behind the name, and the challenges still faced by this company. People outside of Europe tend to associate the name Budweiser with a) the USA, and b) cheap, crap, tasteless beer. But here in the Czech Republic they have the real deal Budweiser beer, not the version that was very badly “copied” by the Americans, and tweaked into what I can only describe as cat’s piss.\n\nThere’s a saga associated to Budweiser, and it involves a legal dispute that’s dragged on since 1907! I’ll try and summarise with a few points.\n\nČeské Budějovice was founded by King Ottokar II of Bohemia in 1256 who granted the city brewing rights a few years later, so the history of beer in České Budějovice dates back to the 13th century.\n\nis the Czech name, Budweis is its German name.\n\nBack in the day both Germans and Czechs in the region brewed beer known as Budweis, the type of beer named after the area it was made, České Budějovice. (Just like Pilsner is named after Pilsen).\n\nSince the 16th Century, the Czechs have called their product ‘The Beer of Kings’.\n\nBeer from Budweis/ České Budějovice began exporting to the United States in 1872/1873.\n\nIn 1876, the American brewer Anheuser-Busch (founded by German Adolphus Busch) began making a beer which they also called “Budweiser”. Busch stated in 1894: “The idea was simple – to produce a beer of the same quality, colour and taste as the beer produced in Budweis, or Bohemia“. Even though that record exists, Anheuser-Busch continues to flatly deny that it stole the name Budweiser from the town of Budweis, or even took any inspiration from there. However, Busch’s own words have helped his company lose a few court cases.\n\nIn 1907, American and Bohemian brewers agreed that Anheuser-Busch could market its beer as Budweiser only in North America, while the Bohemian brewers had the rights to the European markets.\n\nIn North America the Czech beer would be branded ‘Czechvar’, and in Europe the American Budweiser would be branded ‘Bud’.\n\nThere have been ongoing country by country disputes for decades as both Anheuser-Busch and Budweiser Budvar Brewery claim rights to the word ‘Budweiser’.\n\nAs at January 2013, Budvar claimed to have won 89 of 124 cases against Anheuser-Busch, with eight cases ending in a draw or settlement.\n\nAnheuser-Busch market their product as ‘The King of Beers’. Note point 4 above and go figure!\n\nWhy is Budweiser so popular in the USA? It’s cheap, there’s smart marketing, and there’s a consumer base who have little to no idea what real beer tastes like.\n\nHere’s a few pics from the tour. Obviously our guide is in the yellow high viz.\n\nTheir water is sourced from wells 300m underground. We were told that water is taken at 40 litres per second, and there’s enough there to ensure production continues for another 200 years.\n\nExplaining the brewing process.\n\nThe brew house.\n\nThis is where the yeast is added.\n\nDown under in a temp of 2C we get and explanation on the malts they use. And a taste of the beer!\n\nThe tour wasn’t presented in the order of the overall process, but that didn’t matter. Next we visited the building where they clean and prep previously used bottles, right through to filling them, packaging them in packs of 1 doz 500ml bottles, and stacking them onto pellets. A sample from this area.\n\nPhoto op!\n\nAnd then it was across the road and back to Kermit. Another very interesting and informative brewery tour! I’m not staying up all night to type the detail.\n\nBefore we left České Budějovice, we drove up the main road towards its old town square and parked the frog at Marian Square car park. From there it’s a short couple of blocks walk to the square.\n\nAn Art Nouveau building from 1913 which is now headquarters of Komerční banka.\n\nAcross the square a lady tries to blend in with the building.\n\nAmazing detail.\n\nThe beautiful Town Hall was originally a Renaissance house built in the period from 1555 to 1558 but was reconstructed in Baroque style from 1727 to 1730. My attempt to shut the sun out of shot worked very well thanks.\n\nDetail on the town hall. WTF is this!\n\nAn aerial view form a photo inside the town hall building. The car park can be seen at the bottom left.\n\nBeautiful.\n\nPřemysl Ottokar II Square (Náměstí Přemysla Otakara II) in České Budějovice is the second largest square in the Czech Republic.\n\nThe 72m Black Tower (Černá věž, 1577) is just off the north-east corner of the square. It was built in the 16th century and served as a watchtower and later a bell tower for the church beside it.\n\nThe tower entrance. But we didn’t have time to climb it.\n\nNext to the Black Tower is the 17th century Cathedral of St. Nicholas (1649). We poked our noses inside. Here’s one corner of it.\n\nThe Fountain of Samson (Samsonova kašna) also dates to the early 18th century (1721-1726). The main statue depicts the biblical Samson on a lion. In 1999, the original statues were replaced by copies and moved to the town hall for protection.\n\nAt about 4:30pm we drove the remaining 25kms south to Český Krumlov where we’ll stay for 3 nights. Český Krumlov is a small city nestled among the hills of South Bohemia just 30kms from the border with Austria to the south. And yet Prague is only 170kms to the north, which means this place gets a daily dose of day-tripper tours from Prague. It’s the Czech Republic’s second-biggest tourist attraction, so we’ll make the most of the time before 10am and after 5pm to avoid the masses of daytrippers.\n\nHere’s a couple of teasers from a quick visit after we’d done our supermarket visit. We’ll take a closer look tomorrow.\n\nBtw – Český Krumlov is pronounced Chess-key Croom-loff.\n\nIn the old town square is the Marian Plague Column, that dates back to 1714. The first fountain in the square was built by the Rosenbergs in 1577, and stood until 1844 when it was deemed past its ‘use by’ date. Another was constructed at the Plague column in 1843. The sculptures around the column are anti-plague patrons (saints) and town protectors, while the “virgin” Mary is on top (as you’d expect with a “virgin”!).\n\nThe view towards the castle from our accommodation.\n\nAnd later as the sun sets.\n\nBeer time, and quite obviously it had to be a real Budweiser!\n\nSteps count today was 13,851. Yesterday was 12,375. Apparently anything over 10K is enough, so job done.\n\nAnd on that note – signing off for today!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nOops, I forgot to post this wonderful photo yesterday. However we didn’t drain the ‘Crusaders’ wine until today after we returned from the Pilsner Urquell Brewery tour. Turns out it’s not a bad drop. Marginally sweet at first taste, it presented like a fruity Sav, so became totally drinkable by the second glass. Needless to say, as I type this, it’s GONE! Crusaders wine, and no dickheads objecting to its existence.\n\nThere was high cloud this morning but a nice temperature for walking around – say 25C. Blue sky would bust out here and there, so all in all an ideal walking day.\n\nAfter breaky we crossed the road and walked through the park towards the FC Viktoria Plzeň home base – Doosen Arena, which is really close to the old town area.\n\nFirst up – some park art!\n\nA nicely laid out park, plenty of seats in the shade. Tis nice.\n\nLet’s play a game called “Where’s Kath”! Clue: Don’t get lippy.\n\nUnder the main road we went, where Muzza pulled a few tricks out of the bag. A potential sign-up for AJ’s Army?\n\nPrices for home games. Not too bad. You do the maths. Divide by 15.\n\nThe back end of Doosen Arena.\n\nSome of the lads. Don’t have a clue who they are, but we both thought we saw that bloke on the right walking into the arena.\n\nAn early candidate for car of the day is this Merc which has been dressed up with a personally chosen paint job.\n\nAnd look at those big ass tyres on the back.\n\nWe popped into the FC Viktoria Plzeň fan shop, where Muzza scored a couple of T’s.\n\nThe local football team is FC Viktoria Plzeň which has been in operation for 108 years. They play in the first division here (the Czech First League) which they’ve won 5 times, and in recent times they’ve earned appearances in big tournaments like: the Cup Winners’ Cup, European Cup, UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League. Their home turf is right here at Doosen Arena.\n\nThese guys clearly get paid too much. This will have to be the car of the day.\n\nBack through the park to drop off the new kit.\n\nAnd look at this! They even let you carry your purchase away in these fancy new blue things called “plastic bags”. Clearly there’s no mad ass greenie coalition govt here.\n\nWe then popped into the square to tackle that big ass cathedral tower.\n\nThar she blows! Let’s climb this mother of a tower.\n\n10am ticked over and the door opened.\n\nIt’s about 50 steps up to buy tickets to climb the tower. CZK50ea (NZ$3.30ea). 299 steps it said. i.e. lots. Most of it is up well formed wide steps, so no issue with others coming the other way.\n\nTowards the top it gets a bit tighter.\n\nBell! There’s 4 of them. This is the oldest from 1835. The other 4 have recently been upgraded, and are no more than 5 years old!\n\nThe views from up top are superb.\n\nIt’s worth doing. Not too demanding, even for an old fella.\n\nBack down on earth, we passed by the Angel Fountain, and some homeless dude is having a beer, humming to himself “It’s 5 o’clock somewhere”. Or maybe he wasn’t.\n\nWe considered doing a Plzeň underground tour but the end time of the English tour left it too close to the start time of our booked tour at Pilsner Urquell Brewery. So instead I just snapped a shot of the building art next door.\n\nPolicie! There, that’s two. Enough?\n\nDah let’s have morning tea by the cathedral to kill a little time before the brewery tour. A home made raspberry lemonade thing for Kath and a Pina Colda for Muzz (it’s 5 o’clock somewhere!).\n\nCZK164 all up (NZ$11).\n\nWith time killed, we made our way along the road to the nearby home of Pilsner beer – the Pilsner Urquell Brewery. Just a short walk across the Radbuza River to get to the brewery. What I’m saying is that there were two ‘rad boozers’ crossing the Radbuza to go boozing. See what I did there? Ah yup ok. Moving on.\n\nTrivia: They started brewing here soon after 1295. But things didn’t get off to the perfect start. Although the king of the time granted some of Plzeň’s burgher houses the right to brew beer, the locals didn’t exactly rave about it, and centuries later in 1838, things came to a head (nice pun eh!). Apparently 36 barrels of beer were tipped out in front of the town hall in the main square because the beer was declared unsuitable for consumption and even harmful to health. This kicked the burghers of Plzeň into action, and they founded a new brewery and in 1842 brought in Bavarian master brewer Josef Groll from Germany. It’s a German beer then! On 5th October 1842 the first batch of Pilsner lager was brewed from domestic raw materials and soft Plzeň water. Its taste was so unique that it allegedly surprised Josef Groll himself. And it wasn’t long before this bottom-fermented Pilsner lager gained great popularity not just in Plzeň and Prague but internationally. Job done. Even Muzza has since brewed a Pilsner at the Occasional Brewer in Wellington. The tradition continues.\n\nWhen in Plzeň, one must therefore do a Pilsner Urquell Brewery Tour. It’s compulsory! 177 years ago, this outfit started making Pilsener aka Pilsner aka Pils. Good job lads! Apparently, their flash bottling facility processes 120,000 bottles per hour. Keep going Kereru NZ, something to aim for!!\n\nThe English tour we booked online was set for 1pm. Just as well we booked ahead. It was well sold out. The Pilsner motorbike in the visitor’s centre.\n\nWe killed some time by wandering over to the souvenir shop. Note the Škodas lined up here. Two Octavias and a Superb. There were 3 more out of sight. Company cars?\n\nInside the souvenir shop – heaps on offer.\n\nThe tour bus that would later cart us around the plant.\n\nOur tour guide kicks off with some history.\n\nHeading into the bottling and packaging plant.\n\nKereru – as I said, it’s something to aim for!! 120,000 bottles per hour. 60,000 cans per hour. Crazy.\n\nSome more pics from the tour.\n\nDown in the historic brewery cellars, we got to taste unfiltered and unpasteurised Pilsner Urquell tapped directly from an oak barrel. But first the intro beside the fermenting beer.\n\nKath goes it alone, without luck. Needs to wait her turn.\n\nThe queue is here.\n\nPass it here son. Tip: It’s a tad crisp in the cellars, just 4C, so bring a jacket if you’re a wuss.\n\nThe proof is in the tasting. Average if I’m honest. Gimme the filtered stuff please.\n\nMore was explained on how they used to keep the old cellars chilled, but that’s for you to Google.\n\nTour over and time to head back to the accomm to chill before heading out to dinner. We’re hitting the town!\n\nOn the way back we stopped at a ‘dairy’ (weirdly it was run by Chinese, so nothing different here, except that they also speak Czech!). The dairy also sold spirits, and I couldn’t help but notice the Captain Morgan spicy was just CZK379.70. That’s just NZ$25.30. Ridiculous, and in a ‘pricey’ dairy! I would’ve bought a bottle but getting ice is a problem, so that was the end of that!\n\nAfter a slight break we wandered into the guts of old town for dinner. Kath hunted trough Trip Advisor recommendations and we settled on a joint on a side street on the other side of the square.\n\nFirst photo – the sun sets on the Camel Fountain’s arse end.\n\nWhere’s Kath??\n\nDrinks ordered at ‘Svejk Restaurant U Petatricatniku’.\n\nWe both ordered from the traditional Czech section of the menu. This is Muzza’s selection: Beef & dark beer goulash with hot peppers and bacon dumplings. Very tasty.\n\nKath ordered Chicken fillet with mushroom and chanterelle mushroom sauce. With veges on the side. She had trouble finding the mushrooms, but otherwise enjoyed it.\n\nAfter the beer and wine it was a Captain Morgan spiced rum for Muzza and a Bacardi for Kath. Meal done. We left content. Total cost with drinks and starter CZK790 (NZ$52.60).\n\nHere’s the restaurant. The temperature was perfect for sitting outside.\n\nAnd finally, some late evening pics around the square as we walked across it and watched the youth of Plzeň reveal itself.\n\nBoth full as a boot, we waddled back to the accommodation and blobbed. Tomorrow we move on, but we’ve enjoyed two very relaxing days in Plzeň. Quite different from the hustle an bustle of Prague.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThis morning we set off for Pilsen (or rather Plzeň), but first we’d planned a stop just 14km south of Karlovy Vary at a little town called Loket which sits on a hill in a loop of the Ohře River. Kermit sits patiently ready to go.\n\nWe arrived at Loket at about 9:30am and parked up across the bridge. There’s minimal parking in the town so don’t bother driving in. More so today, as there was an event in town. And there’s an event at the end of this month as well – It’s Captain Jack!\n\nOn a rocky hill in a loop in the river sits the 12th century Gothic style Loket Castle, which was once known as “the Impregnable Castle of Bohemia” because of its thick walls. It’s one of the oldest stone castles in the Czech Republic.\n\nTrivia: Charles IV often stayed at Loket castle, even though he was held in the underground prison here for two months when he was only 3 years old!\n\nHere’s Loket from my virtual drone (aka the web!). Quite a quaint little town.\n\nCrossing the bridge into Loket.\n\nCar of the day came early this morning. In fact it was actually ‘cars of the day’. A rally of classic cars and motorcycles had stopped over. Here’s a taste.\n\nA cross between Captain Mainwaring off Dad’s Army, and Radar from MASH. Kath thinks he’s gorgeous!\n\nMore lean machines.\n\nThe town centre and castle were both used as locations in the 2006 film Casino Royale, representing a town in Montenegro!\n\nSecurity for a bicycle is better than no security (sorry Mike).\n\nWe walked up to the castle entrance but didn’t trek through it (there’s not a lot going on inside this one).\n\nMore cars.\n\nHeading back down to the main drag to search for the brewery.\n\nHere it is.\n\nNot much happening, just a shop. This local concoction looks like a sample from the morning after.\n\nIt’s a nice day today, the temperature at Loket this morning was about 22C and getting warmer all the time. It would top out at 26-27C at Plzeň later on.\n\nA parting shot of the castle. Battling with the glare of the sun.\n\nThe drive from Loket to Plzeň wasn’t a long one, just 81kms (1 hour 10 min). We initially drove through the green hills east of Loket before busting out into wide open spaces and letting Kermit loose. The run went quite well until we got inside of Plzeň itself where there were road works galore. Every time we wanted to turn left there was a ‘no turning’ sign in place. After encountering 3 of these, and driving aimlessly around, we spotted some cars driving through into a street that the signs were telling us not to go into. So we followed them! And it proved to be the right move. Phew.\n\nWe arrived at the accommodation 2 hours before check-in but they let us park in their underground park while we went for a walk.\n\nTrivia: Plzeň (which is actually only about 90km from Prague) was founded in 1295 by King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia, and nowadays is the fourth most populous city in the Czech Republic with approx 170,000 residents. BUT… more importantly this IS the birthplace of Pilsner beer! More on that tomorrow.\n\nThe south and east sides of old town Plzeň town are bordered by parks. We took a stroll through the park (Šafaříkovy sady) and stumbled across these guys. Spejbl and Hurvínek (Spayble & Hoor-vee-neck) are a Czech puppet comedy duo who were created in 1920 & 1926. They actually achieved international success, and in Prague there is even a theatre named after them! Nuff said.\n\nThe Neo-Renaissance Museum of West Bohemia in Plzeň (1893–1902).\n\nMestský Park is on the south side of town, and that’s where we stumbled across these two nudies. This wouldn’t get past the PC brigade in NZ.\n\nTo the left, Czech composer – Bedřich Smetana (1824-1884).\n\nThe J.K. Tyl Theatre (1899-1902), aka The Great Theatre.\n\nThis Moorish-Romanesque styled Great Synagogue is the largest in the Czech Republic, the second largest in Europe, and the third largest synagogue in the World. Originally built in 1892, it was completely destroyed in WW2, so this is the reconstructed version.\n\nThis is a dead easy short stroll. Whilst looping back into the old town square we found something for Julie and Scooter. Kangaroo pies!? It also looks like they’ve borrowed the Qantas logo.\n\nWoooaahh. Retro Rob, we’ve found the perfect business for you, my man. Established and ready to go!\n\nBuilding art. WTF!\n\nArriving in Republic Square (Náměstí Republiky), which is one of the largest town squares in Europe (193m long x 139m wide), the standout is the massive gothic St. Bartholomew’s Cathedral, which was constructed in the late 13th century immediately after the founding of the city, and it evolved over the centuries that followed. Its tower is 102m high (335ft), making it the highest in the Czech Republic. Hmm, it seems there’s a lot of ‘largest’, ‘biggest’ and ‘highest’ going on here in Plzeň. Kath’s stomach pains will be a very good excuse not to climb the 301 steps of the tower. Well not today anyway. Maybe tomorrow.\n\nIn the old town square there are 3 of these large Golden Fountains. This one is the Greyhound Fountain. And what a magnificent backdrop!\n\nBuilding art in the square.\n\nBeautiful Neo-Renaissance and Art Nouveau influenced architecture.\n\nZlatá kašna Velbloud (the Camel Golden Fountain).\n\nAnd then Kath spotted this above a shop. Umm.\n\nWatch out!!\n\nAlong the side of the St. Bartholomew’s Cathedral there’s these decorative Baroque bars adorned with the heads of cherubs. Each one has a different expression, but there’s one that’s fairly worn. They say “Touch the little angel and make a wish”. Wooahh, that sounds a bit Harvey Weinstein!\n\nMeantime the coppas are in action. A big dude with builder’s crack clamps a Porsche Carrera. I bet they just love it when they nail the big boy’s toys.\n\nThe third golden fountain is Zlatá kašna – Anděl (the Angel Golden Fountain).\n\nAnother clamping. They ARE hunting out the big boy’s toys!\n\nThe classic building in the square is the Renaissance City/Town Hall which was reconstructed between 1554-1559 after a large fire in 1507. It’s decorated with Czech rulers and the city’s coat of arms. Beautiful!\n\nWedding car decoration of the year.\n\nImmediately to the left of the Town Hall is Imperial House. It is so named because when plague broke out in Prague in September 1599, Emperor Rudolf II fled the city and came to Plzeň. So until June 4, 1600, Plzen served as the capital of the Empire. Today, the Mayor’s office is on the first floor.\n\nThe St. Mary’s (Marian) plague column (1681) with the Baroque replica of Plzeň Madonna on the top in the NW corner of Republic Square.\n\nThe Neo-Renaissance Dům U Červeného srdce (House by the Red Heart) building (1894) is easily identified by a red heart in the middle of the facade.\n\nDetail on the House by the Red Heart building.\n\nMore building art.\n\nDown a random side street.\n\nAlong Pražská, with the oldest water monument in Plzeň at the back. This Water Tower was once part of the city fortifications.\n\nKath, tram!\n\nThere’s a seat over there with our name on it.\n\nCocktails please. Aperol Spritz CZK99 (NZ$6.60). Sex on the Beach CZK119 (NZ$7.93). Cheap as.\n\nOur hotel is across the road, so we didn’t have far to stumble.\n\nMuzza yells “Dead Ants!” and a local obliges.\n\nI’ll have a beer please. CZK59 (NZ$3.93).\n\nAnd another. Here’s the label. It’s their own brew – Plzenský Pašák Světlý Ležák (pronounced umm forget it). A nice drop. None of the beers I’ve had so far can be called craft beers (as in what we have in NZ). They’re more of a standard draft beer (but better than our bog standard draft beers).\n\n7 Days says: “Plzeň synchronised swimming team gets it all wrong”.\n\nSorry Mike but we found Security to be “on duty” at the supermarket.\n\nAfter checking in, we popped down to the local supermarket and bought some supplies. Got this stuff on a ‘let’s just try it’ based on the pictures. A beautiful spread/dip, goes good on bread or crackers. But what is it?\n\nTo all of you Crusader name hating wankers, please note the Crusader knight WITH a sword on this wine bottle. Is it a problem? No it isn’t. Get a grip! We bought a bottle and it’s chilling right now. CZK149, NZ$9.93. Must be a good!\n\nSpirits on show. Some unusual stuff.\n\nGrabbed one of these as well.\n\nThere’s the round up for today. Gonna chill for a bit.\n\nOh, almost forgot again! The step counts. Not a biggy today, but did crack the required 10K – 10,435.\n\nYesterday at Karlovy Vary – 15,018\n\nDay before at Lidice & the castle – 13,213\n\nDay before at Prague Castle and with Tomáš – 14,742\n\nDay before at Prague – the west side walk – 17,247.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nToday we took a leisurely walk around the architecturally beautiful old town of Karlovy Vary (previously Carlsbad). This very picturesque spa town sits on the northern edge of the Slavkov Forest in the west Bohemia region of the Czech Republic. The weather today was more of the same. Sun, with showers here and there and occasional thunder. Seems to be the trend. Any rain we get never lasts, and the ground dries fast. The temperature was quite pleasant for wandering around, 24C. Higher when the sun is full on. Although it’s only 27kms from the German border, Karlovy Vary is still only 130kms from Prague! It’s a reminder that the Czech Republic is actually quite a small country.\n\nKarlovy Vary’s numerous thermal springs have made it a popular resort since the 19th century. Our visit will zone in on the riverside spa district which is home to several colonnades / columned walkways, mineral spas and beautiful 19th-century architecture.\n\nThe trivia: Population – 50,000. The town sits on the confluence of the rivers Ohře and Teplá. It was named after Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia, who founded the city in 1370 – by mistake really. He was hunting deer in the area and one of his hounds fell into a bubbling thermal hot spring. Don’t panic, the dog not only survived, but his wounded leg was miraculously repaired. Charles recognised the healing powers and it was game on for a new town.\n\nOver the following centuries its elegant spas became ‘the’ place to go for the royal and the wealthy. Visitors included Tsar Peter the Great of Russia, Karl Marx, Emperor Franz Josef I, Beethoven, Chopin, Casanova, Goethe, Wagner, Tolstoy, Freud, and now us. Many aristocrats even built elaborate mansions for their periodic visits. We spotted heaps of them.\n\nNeedless to say, Karlovy Vary became famous for its natural mineral and thermal hot water springs (there are 13 main springs, about 300 smaller springs!). Apparently, they were believed to have medicinal benefits, so this was enough to bring in the crowds.\n\nRighto… we set off down a walking track in front of our accommodation. The track linked to a road, and within 2 minutes we were on the east side of the Tepla River.\n\nLooking back up at our accommodation. On a Trip Advisor tip off we managed to snare room 7 at the Villa Rosa. It’s the one at the top in the middle, with three doors that open to a long balcony. A great beer drinking spot (as tested later in the day).\n\nA view from the track. Our plan was to wander along the river until a point near where it meets the Ohře River. We’ll veer off and check out the main shopping street until we reach Becherplatz (more on that later), then circle back and take in points of interest at the other end of the old town area.\n\nThe ‘as you do’ photo before the crowds arrive.\n\nSadly, they didn’t have this in Kath’s size. Gutted.\n\nBelow: The oldest baths in Karlovy Vary once stood on this site – now known as the Market Colonnade. The Swiss style structure seen today dates back to 1879 and now houses the seeps of three mineral springs. Apparently, Emperor Charles IV himself healed his ailing limbs with the waters of these springs which was named after him. Kath was busting to get a ‘Becher’ cup to try the mineral water (coz her gut has been playing up, and she was looking for that miracle cure!). But the shops aren’t quite open so we walked on.\n\nThe Holy Trinity Column (1715) in beautiful surroundings.\n\nInside the Market Colonnade.\n\nTo drink the supposedly health-restoring sulphurous waters, you can buy a fancy porcelain spa cup (lázeňský pohárek) aka Becher with its sipping spout protruding from the handle. Boom, instant souvenir! The locals are probably sitting back pissing themselves laughing at the tourists supping out of these odd-looking cups. We just need a seller to open (and there’s heaps of them!).\n\nHold on, what’s this. Surely not a racist souvenir shop?? Am I allowed to enter?\n\nHorse!\n\nYup there’s a horse standing outside the Mill Colonnade (Mlýnská kolonáda) which is the largest colonnade here and houses the seeps of five mineral springs. This stone colonnade, built in Pseudo-Renaissance style, is decorated with 12 sandstone statues representing the months of the year. The original structure (1792) was replaced with this one in 1881.\n\nOk here’s a shop that’s opened up, and Kath spotted the Becher cup most suited to a Wino member. Sidetracking for a mo. Note the Russian writing on the wall. I read there’s been a heap of Russian investment in the old town area, so it’s become very popular with Russian visitors. Walking around, you regularly see signs in Cyrillic characters (the alphabet used in Russia) so clearly the ‘investors’ don’t see integration as a thing. Hmm this place gives the impression of a Russian enclave in the heart of Central Europe! Maybe their investment is becoming just a little too dominant? And why is that? Well before WW2 there was a strong German influence in the town, but afterwards the German population was forcibly evicted, and the Communists inherited the area. In 1951 the impressive Grandhotel Pupp (seen further down below) was even renamed Grandhotel Moscow (until 2014). Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the end of communism in Czechoslovakia the number of Russians buying property and opening businesses in Karlovy Vary is still steadily increasing. Interesting. There must be something magic in that water! And it also explains the grumpy nature of some of the ‘investors’. We sat at a place for lunch today, and within 3 minutes had 3 instances of shit service from a bloke who appeared to me to be Russian (There’s a different look). Grumpy, no smile, no personality. We got up and walked out. Message delivered.\n\nKath’s happy, coz she has her Becher and is testing the water in one of the seeps in the Mill Colonnade. The temperature at this particular seep was 56C.\n\nIn goes the piping hot natural spring water. It tastes marginally sulphury, but not. Hard to explain. Drinkable (that’s all). And there were heaps wandering around with Bechers sipping away hoping some miracle health benefit occurs. Did it fix Kath’s gut pain? Dunno. She went to a pharmacy and got some Gaviscon, so who knows.\n\nThe very shallow Teplá River with Mill Colonnade to the right.\n\nSpeaking of medicinal benefits. At the right end of the Mill Colonnade there’s a large green bottle shaped booth that sells Becherovka. Pronounced “Beh-here-offka” with the ‘Beh’ sounding like ‘bed’ without the d. So, what is it? Well it’s an alcoholic drink (do I have your attention?) that’s been produced here in Karlovy Vary since 1807. Apparently, it was originally marketed as a digestive aid (yeah right). It’s made from a secret recipe based on a wide variety of herbs and spices. They say that only two people know the secret of the entire production process. Cut to the chase… its alcohol content is 38% ABV (76 proof). Serve it chilled.\n\nWell it’d be rude not to taste it, so I bought a small bottle later on in the day from this very ‘bottle’ shop. Yup, they sell from inside it. I’ll probably try it soon, so keep reading to get the lowdown. fyi you can buy it in NZ (700ml for $45-$50).\n\nBechers – everywhere!\n\nThe Orchard Colonnade, which we found (oddly) at the park! (Dvořák Park).\n\nWTF – in the park.\n\n7 Days says: Lady with big pussy seen in park.\n\nMeantime by the lake in the park… a skinny dipper!\n\nSmetana Park leads down to Elizabeth Spa. As you’d imagine, there are heaps of spas here, most are hidden away in hotels. Seems that most visitors drink the mineral water rather than bathe in it. Elisabeth Spa (1906) is named after Empress Elisabeth (aka Sissi). Elisabeth Baths is the biggest consumer of the hot mineral water in the town (20% of the total quantity). There’s no end of treatments available here if you’re keen to fork out.\n\nThe pedestrian-only street named T. G. Masaryka.\n\nA shopping centre missed by Kath.\n\nTomáš Garrigue Masaryk, the first President of Czechoslovakia.\n\nBecherplatz is at the top of the street. It’s the result of an extensive reconstruction of a former 170-year-old distillery producing the aforementioned Becherovka liqueur.\n\nAnd here it is! Btw. Jan Becher is the name of the company that started making Becherovka over 200 years back. Apparently, Josef Bercher, a local pharmacist started selling a medicinal tonic which was basically his own bitters-based recipe. The rest is history.\n\n7 Days says: Man tries to blend in with building to avoid wife, who is trying to blend in with building to avoid husband.\n\nWe went inside for a peek. Aside from this area there’s shops selling Becherovka in all shapes and forms, as well as all the accessories you can think of.\n\nSelfie under another big bottle.\n\nWe decided to loop back to where we started via a side street. Man, there’s some seriously impressive buildings around here. The area we were heading into is aptly named Castle Hill.\n\nNow if you want proof the Russians are here, look no further. Check out the magnificent Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral (1893-97). This elaborate Russian Orthodox church with its golden domes is the country’s largest and most important orthodox church. Funded by local Russian and Serbian nobility and entrepreneurs.\n\nCar of the day!\n\nWell well well, we keep bumping into Karl Marx and here he is again. As mentioned in the intro, he was a regular visitor.\n\nThese buildings just keep coming at ya. Wow. The Savoy Hotel and some.\n\nHey Jim, or Dennis… Looks like there’s some space up for grabs. Can you guys translate this please?\n\nWe’ve now looped around the side of a hill and back to where we started. Quite a pleasant walk, with only a little bit of rain thrown in. We learned quickly to take umbrellas out as a matter of course!\n\nCheck this out.\n\nKath at the Market Colonnade.\n\nIt was time to check out the star attraction, but dark clouds are closing in. There’s some more rain coming, and this looks like a decent amount.\n\nWe popped inside of the Hot Spring Colonnade (Vřídelní kolonáda) building which houses the most famous Hot Spring in Karlovy Vary. The spring has been covered over since 1774, and in 1975 they built this modern structure over it. Inside is the Pramen Vřídlo Geyser which, when excited, can gush 72C water to a height of 12 metres. Well it wasn’t gushing diddly sqwat today. It has been temporarily capped to allow for some construction work to be done. Bugger! Even the seeps in the adjoining room were turned off.\n\nAt the other end of the building there’s a smaller outdoor version spurting hot water into the air.\n\nWe’d just left the building and the rain came down. Heavy! The brollies were doing well. We ducked into a side ally where Muzza found somewhere to hide. Kath says “But we don’t have our togs”. And the problem is? 🙂 Kath wins.\n\nThe rains eased off. Let’s go this way.\n\nThe Karlovy Vary City Theatre (1884-86)\n\nThe rain eased. It seems the showers never last long.\n\n50% off doesn’t quite seem enough for the stuff in this window.\n\nOh, so you want to go back now do you? Kath wonders whether this dude is thrown in as part of the beer spa price.\n\nAnd here’s the big mama Grandhotel Pupp I mentioned earlier. You’ll see it in Casino Royale. Out front in their courtyard drive through there’s little brass plaques in the ground with names of famous people who have stayed there. E.g. Johann Sebastian Bach, Karl Marx, Michael Douglas, bla bla. Below there’s a couple of the more important guests.\n\nAcross the river some building art.\n\nThe rather run down looking Kaiserbad Spa was also in the Casino Royale movie – as a casino!\n\nSheesh these buildings are amazing.\n\nOh dear, WTF has this bloke done with the horses? Ambyr… is this appropriate??!! And the horse on the left is a boy. Poor thing.\n\nLunch. Yes they did have beer but I wouldn’t call it a beer house with just a few beers on offer.\n\nKath’s lunch.\n\nTalk about a day of two halves. After lunch it’s blue sky! At the Hot Spring Colonnade the smaller hot spring geyser is still pumping it out. In behind is Kath, and also the Baroque styled Mary Magdalene Church (1733-1736).\n\nPigeon foreplay in full view of everyone.\n\nBuilding art, very well done.\n\nI think I’ve posted this view earlier. This time with sun!\n\nAnd inside the Hot Spring Colonnade the water is now flowing from its seeps.\n\nA few more shots of the charm of Karlovy Vary, but with some blue sky!!\n\nDanella… pigs!\n\nSpotted in the supermarket, the beer I had at lunch. fyi 65 Crowns is about NZ$4.33 for this 500ml bottle. Other beers are much cheaper.\n\nViews as we walked back up the trail to our accommodation.\n\nBack home. Here’s the little bottle of Becherovka. I’m not going to open it yet coz I’m still on beers as I write this!\n\nIf you look very carefully you can see a handsome half naked man in this cup! Ok, stop! You’ve looked hard enough.\n\nSpeaking of beers – today’s offerings. Rookie error noted with the one on the left. It’s alcohol free. Note to self. Try to translate the labels b"
