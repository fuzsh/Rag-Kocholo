STEUBENVILLE, Ohio â Country singer, songwriter and Steubenville native Rose Angelica co-founded the Dean Martin Hometown Celebration in 1996, shortly after the legend's death.

She says the singer, actor and entertainer came from humble beginnings, quit school in 10th grade, bounced around for years, before learning the style, and his career soon took off.

âHad no acting talent, no acting classes, nothing. He just fell into it. I mean, he was a natural, born natural to do what he's doing. He knew from day one that was his goal,â says Angelica.

Angelica says Martin, born Dino Paul Crocetti, was always proud of his Italian heritage and is remembered for his charitable contributions to the city.

âDean Martin started the first cancer center at St. John's hospital in Steubenville in the 60s after his mother died. He paid for the complete Cobalt unit, which was like a radiation unit. We were the first place to have a cobalt unit, east of Chicago,â says Angelica.

Bob Morelli has dedicated his musical career to singing the hits of his favorite singer, Dean Martin.

He said he and fans from across the country continue to come back each year because of their affinity to the king of cool.

âEverybody wanted to be Dean, and the women wanted to be with Dean, you know and I think that keeps on drawing people, 25 years later,â says Morelli.

Whether it's a portrait on display at the Spot Bar, memorabilia, this historical marker, t-shirts, a mural rib on the Kroger grocery store, or tribute performances at Fort Steuben Park, Martin's memory remains alive and well.

âIf you have a dream, go for it, never give up, and he didn't,â says Angelica.
