Dino Paul Crocetti was born on 7 June 1917 in Steubenville, Ohio to an Italian father and an Italian-American mother, and he spoke Abruzzese Italian at home. Martin dropped out of high school in sophomore year because he felt that he was smarter than his teachers, and he bootlegged liquor, served as a speakeasy croupier, was a blackjack dealer, worked in a steel mill, and boxed as a welterweight. He later attracted the attention of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Columbia Pictures, and he became a member of the "Martin and Lewis" comedy duo with Jerry Lewis. Martin became a popular singer and actor during the 1950s, becoming a member of the "Rat Pack" with Frank Sinatra.

Dean Martin was a lifelong Republican Party member, although he supported Democratic Party presidential nominee John F. Kennedy in 1960, owing to Sinatra's close friendship with the president. However, some of his more important connections were with the American Mafia, which helped to kickstart his career; he performed at their events and clubs.
