        "text": "HOMES OF THE WESTERN STARS\n\nDEAN MARTIN\n\nby\n\nSPECIAL GUEST BLOGGER\n\nBOB SILER\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nHowdy Fellow Film Lovers\n\nThis is your tour guide, Bob, with another trip to the homes of one one of yesterdays western film favorites. This time we’ll be visiting places where Dean Martin once lived.\n\nNow, some of you might think of Dean as nothing more than a singer, actor, comic and straight man to Jerry Lewis. But he was much more than that. He was a lover of western movies and a great western film actor. Dean wasn’t into the movie star social life of nightclubs and partys and when his wife, Jeanne would throw a big gathering at their home on Mountain Drive, Dean could always be found in the den watching a western instead of hob nobbing with the elite of the film world. He didn’t care if anyone was insulted either, producers, actors, actresses, if didn’t matter. He would not play the star game for anyone, not even his wife or best friend, Frank Sinatra. I’ve read several books on Dean and the one thing that comes across about him was that he was a decent guy.\n\nNo one seemed to have a bad thing to say about him. After twenty odd years of marriage, he and Jeanne divorced and he married a much younger babe. That marriage was short lived. In the end, it was Jeanne who took care of him until the day he died. And he made sure that she and their children never had to ask for anything. He was a good man.\n\nSo, put on your favorite Dean Martin album and lets stroll through the places he had called home.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nBob\n\n(By the way, my original tour also listed the homes of Jerry Lewis, which I did not include here. If you would like to have a list of Jerry’s homes just drop me an e – mail and I’ll get it to you.)\n\nTHE DEAN MARTIN TOUR\n\n(RIO BRAVO)\n\nPART 0NE\n\nFROM STUBENVILLE TO MANHATTAN\n\n1917 – 1940s\n\nSTUBENVILLE, OHIO\n\n1917 – 1930\n\n319 SOUTH 6th STREET\n\nHe was born here at the family home on June 7, 1917.\n\n1930\n\n118 BRADY AVENUE\n\nThe family moved to this house located on the northern end of town.\n\n1931\n\n630 GRAND VIEW AVENUE\n\nPLEASANT HEIGHTS\n\nThey next moved into this small brick house.\n\n1933\n\n1210 RIVERVIEW AVENUE\n\nThey moved into this small two – story gabled house with a backyard.\n\nIt overlooked the Ohio and West Virginia hills.\n\n1936\n\nNORTH SEVENTH STREET\n\nLived here for awhile.\n\n1941\n\nCLEVELAND HEIGHTS, OHIO\n\n2820 MAYFIELD ROAD\n\nDean and his first wife, Betty, moved here, their first home, after getting married.\n\n(With Betty)\n\nSTUBENVILLE, OHIO\n\n2130 SUNSET BOULEVARD\n\nDean’s parents were now living here.\n\n1943 – 1948\n\nNEW YORK CITY\n\n1943 – 1944\n\nLONDON TERRACE APARTMENTS – MANHATTAN (Chelsea area)\n\nDean and Betty’s first New York apartment.\n\n1945\n\nSTUBENVILLE, OHIO\n\n1101 CARDINAL AVENUE\n\nDean’s parents were living here. When Dean was on the road Betty and the children lived here with them. When he was in town, he stayed here as well.\n\n1940s\n\nLONG BEACH, CALIFORNIA\n\n1137 GARDENIA AVENUE\n\nIn the mid – late ’40s his parents left Ohio and moved here.\n\n1948\n\nNEW YORK CITY\n\nRIVERSIDE DRIVE AND WEST 106th STREET\n\nDean, Betty and the kids were living here in a ten-room apartment before moving to Los Angeles.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED…\n\nBob Siler grew up in Burbank, not far from Universal Studios and Warner Brothers where they made his favorite monster movies. A long-time fan of Westerns, he still has a hard time believing that the great John Wayne could die. Bob has created many lists detailing where the famous and infamous lived, are buried, and the cars they drove. He has recently completed this list of Western Stars homes after many years. Burbank Bob now resides in Portland, Oregon."
