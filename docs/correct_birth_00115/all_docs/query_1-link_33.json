        "text": "(1917–95). American singer and actor Dean Martin was a member, with Jerry Lewis, of one of the most popular comedy teams on stage and television and in motion pictures for 10 years. Martin then moved on to a successful solo career as a singer, an actor, and a television variety show host.\n\nMartin was born Dino Paul Crocetti on June 7, 1917, in Steubenville, Ohio. During his younger days he worked locally in steel mills, delivered bootleg liquor, was a prizefighter, and had a job in a casino. After appearing in local nightspots as a pop singer, he was hired by bandleader Sammy Watkins and began to tour. During an engagement in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 1946, he and another performer, comedian Jerry Lewis, began clowning around during each other’s acts. This led to an immensely successful comedy partnership that featured Martin as a suave straight man and Lewis as an immature clown. Before long the two left New York for Hollywood. They made 16 motion pictures together, beginning with My Friend Irma (1949) and ending with Hollywood or Bust (1956).\n\nDespite predictions that Martin would fail as a solo act, his career prospered after he ended the partnership with Lewis. Martin struck gold with hit songs such as “That’s Amore” (1953), “Memories Are Made of This” (1955), and “Everybody Loves Somebody” (1964). Simultaneously, he kept his acting career alive, starring in films such as The Young Lions (1958), Some Came Running (1958), Bells Are Ringing (1960), Toys in the Attic (1963), and Airport (1970). In addition, Martin performed in several movies with his fellow Hollywood clique members—dubbed the Rat Pack and including Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis, Jr. Among these films were the comedy western Sergeants 3 (1962) and the musical comedy Robin and the 7 Hoods (1964).\n\nMartin was also a staple on television for many years. His television variety show, The Dean Martin Show, began an eight-year run in 1965 and was followed by The Dean Martin Comedy Hour (1973–74). Although Martin often seemed to be intoxicated during his television and nightclub performances—an impression aided by his easygoing manner and slurred singing style—he and his friends insisted it was part of his act. Martin died on December 25, 1995, in Beverly Hills, California."
