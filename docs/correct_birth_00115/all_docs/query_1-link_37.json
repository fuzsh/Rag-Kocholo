DEAN'S HOMETOWN OF STEUBENVILLE HEARTILY OBLIGED WITH A PUBLIC MEMORIAL AND CELEBRATION EVENT.\n\n\"THE DEAN MARTIN COMMITTEE\"... A GROUP, WITH THE TASK OF LANDING AND HOLDING THE EVENT WAS FOUNDED AND FORMED BY MAYOR DOMENICK MUCCI IN APRIL 1996.\n\nABOUT THIS TIME, THE \"CITY OF MURALS\", WANTING TO ERECT A MURAL OF DEAN IN HIS HOMETOWN, STARTED FUND RAISING APPEALS\n\nTURNING TO THE \"DEAN MARTIN COMMITTEE\" FOR HELP... THEIR GOALS WERE REACHED OVER THE FOLLOWING YEAR. \"THE DEAN MARTIN COMMITTEE'S\" MANY FUND RAISING EVENTS, AND ASSISTANCE FROM THE \"DEAN MARTIN FAN CENTER\", GAVE FANS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD A CHANCE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS LASTING MEMORIAL IN DEAN'S HONOR\n\nARTIST BOB DEVER HAS BEEN EQUALLY HONORED FOR HIS BEAUTIFUL MURAL DEPICTING THE MANY FACETS OF DEAN'S CAREER.\n\nTHE PHOTOGRAPH TO THE RIGHT IS FROM THE 1996 MEMORIAL EVENT.\n\nTHE MAIN HIGHWAY RUNNING THROUGH TOWN WAS RE-DEDICATED \"DEAN MARTIN BOULEVARD\" AND NEW SIGNS WERE UNVEILED.\n\nSINCE THIS TIME, THE DEAN MARTIN COMMITTEE HAS WELCOMED VISITORS FROM ALL OVER TO IT'S QUAINT TOWN.\n\nYOU CAN ROLL YOUR WINDOW DOWN AND ASK ANYONE THAT YOU SEE, \"WHERE IS THE DEAN MARTIN MURAL LOCATED?\" AND THEY WILL BE THRILLED TO TELL YOU, IF NOT VOLUNTEER TO ACTUALLY TAKE YOU THERE IN PERSON TO SEE IT!"
