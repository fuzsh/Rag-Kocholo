        "text": "Martin and Lewis became the most popular comedy team and the highest paid entertainers in the country. From 1951 to 1956, they were always among the top-ten box office attractions.\n\nWhen the pair broke up in 1956, fans were certain that Lewis would continue to be successful on his own, but they weren't so sure about Martin. While Lewis was certainly one of a kind, did the entertainment world really need another handsome, wavy-haired crooner? Martin's first film without Lewis was \"Ten Thousand Bedrooms\" (1957), a breezy romantic comedy in which he cultivated his image as a sophisticated swinger. Co-starring in his next film with Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift in \"The Young Lions\" (1958), Martin proved he was a talented actor who could handle more dramatic roles. Martin co-starred with future Rat Pack partner Frank Sinatra in \"Some Came Running\" (1958), and with John Wayne in the Western \"Rio Bravo\" (1959). \"Ocean's Eleven\" (1960) brought the entire Rat Pack together -- Sinatra, Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Joey Bishop and Peter Lawford -- for a film featuring a group of old Army pals getting together to rob the casinos in Las Vegas. The Pack also appeared together in \"Sergeants 3\" (1962). Martin and Sinatra co-starred in \"Four for Texas\" (1963), \"Robin and the Seven Hoods\" (1964) and \"Marriage on the Rocks\" (1965).\n\nMartin starred in a series of successful Westerns and sophisticated romantic comedies in the 1960s, including \"Bells are Ringing\" (1960), \"Who's Been Sleeping in My Bed?\" (1963), \"Kiss Me, Stupid\" (1964), \"The Sons of Katie Elder\" (1965), \"Texas Across the River\" (1966), \"Rough Night in Jericho\" (1967), \"Bandolero!\" (1968) and \"Five Card Stud\" (1968). He also starred as sexy secret agent Matt Helm in \"The Silencers\" (1966), \"Murderer's Row\" (1966), \"The Ambushers\" (1967) and \"The Wrecking Crew\" (1969).\n\nOn the small screen, Martin starred in \"The Dean Martin Show,\" a weekly music and variety series, beginning in 1965. The show typically featured the sleepy-eyed Martin in his tuxedo, with a cigarette and a glass of booze (though, more likely, it was apple juice), laughing and ab-libbing his way though a series of songs and skits with his celebrity guests. The popular show continued through 1974.\n\nWhen Martin's son, Dino, an actor and member of the Air National Guard, died in a plane crash in 1987, Martin retired from public life, returning briefly for a national concert tour with Sinatra and Davis.\n\nMartin's crypt marker includes the title of his theme song, \"Everybody Loves Somebody Sometime.\" Unfortunately, several people have placed lit cigarettes on top of Martin's bronze crypt marker, and there are a few burn marks on the marble.\n\nMartin's crypt is usually decorated with flowers, ribbons and an American flag.\n\nMartin was born Dino Paul Crocetti on June 7, 1917, in Steubenville, OH. He died on Dec. 25, 1995, in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nBack to biographies page"
