        "text": "Singer and actor Dean Martin was Americaâs favorite âlush in a tux,â the sardonically smiling embodiment of all that was cool in mainstream American culture in the â50s and â60s. Born Dino Paul Crocetti in Steubenville, OH, in 1917, Martin grew up far from the booze- and broads-filled good life of his later years: He was the son of a barber, and he spoke only Italian until age five. He dropped out of school at age 16 and tried his hand variously as a boxer (known as âKid Crochetâ), a steel-mill worker, a gas-station attendant, and a speakeasy croupier. But Martin was allergic to working life, and he found his ticket with nightclub singing, inspired by his hero Bing Crosby. He was blessed with a mellow, buttery tenor, and he got his first big break in Atlantic City, performing opposite the comedian Jerry Lewis. The gigâoriginally meant to be temporaryâunveiled Martin and Lewisâs vaudevillian improvisational genius. Whereas Martin was all charm and sophistication, Lewis was the anarchic delinquent, and audiences loved it: They made 16 movies in 11 years before an acrimonious split. Meanwhile, Martin was recording jazzy, insouciant hits that played on his Italian heritage, such as 1953âs âThatâs Amoreâ and 1958âs âVolare.â After his split with Lewis, Dino found himself a new niche as part of the Rat Pack with Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr., costarring in a series of comedies that cemented his image. He showed serious acting chops in films like 1959âs Rio Bravo, had his own television show from 1965 onward, and continued to seduce listeners with sly songs like âAinât That a Kick In the Headâ and âYouâre Nobody âTil Somebody Loves You.â He died in 1995."
