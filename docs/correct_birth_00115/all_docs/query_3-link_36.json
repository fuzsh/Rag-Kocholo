        "text": "Dean Martin, began his entertainment career as a singer in the early 1940s. He started by performing in local clubs in his hometown of Steubenville, Ohio. In 1946, he moved to New York City to pursue a career in entertainment, and began working as a nightclub singer. Martin's big break came in 1949 when he teamed up with comedian Jerry Lewis to form the successful comedy duo, Martin and Lewis. After Martin and Lewis parted ways in 1956, Martin continued his successful entertainment career as a solo artist. He starred in films such as Rio Bravo, Ocean's Eleven, and The Sons of Katie Elder."
