He was not only a singer, he was not only an actor, the man was just multi-talented. He sat with kings and presidents. Where he started and what he achieved is nothing short of monumental. We deserve to come out and honor him for everything he did for Steubenville.\n\nThe Dean Martin Festival is slated for June 15-17."
