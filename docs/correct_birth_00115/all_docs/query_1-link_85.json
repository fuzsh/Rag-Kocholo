One of the most popular and enduring American entertainers of the mid-20th century, Martin was nicknamed ‚ÄúThe King of Cool.‚Äù Martin gained his career breakthrough together with comedian Jerry Lewis, billed as Martin & Lewis, in 1946. They performed in nightclubs and later had numerous appearances on radio, television and in films. Starting in 1965, Martin was the host of the television variety program The Dean Martin Show, which centered on Martin‚Äôs singing and comedic talents and was characterized by his relaxed, easy-going demeanor. From 1974 to 1984, he was roastmaster on the popular Dean Martin Celebrity Roast, which drew celebrities, comedians and politicians. Throughout his career, Martin performed in concert stages, nightclubs, audio recordings and appeared in 85 film and television productions. Martin was born in Steubenville, Ohio, to an Italian immigrant father Gaetano Alfonso Crocetti (1894‚Äì1967) and an Italian-American mother Angela Crocetti (n√©e Barra; 1899‚Äì1966). His father, who was a barber, was originally from Montesilvano, Abruzzo, and his mother‚Äôs origins are also from the province of Abruzzo. Between singing, acting, and just being cool, Dean Martin will go down as one of the most influential Americans of Italian descent! His music still plays in movies and in the homes of Italian-Americans around the country. God bless your soul Dino! üá∫üá∏üáÆüáπüé•üé§ #ItalianHeritageMonth #italoamericani #italianamerican #americanitalian #deanmartin #dinocrocetti #italianheritageheroes\".",
