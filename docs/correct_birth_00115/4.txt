DEAN MARTIN WAS BORN IN STEUBENVILLE, OHIO

STEUBENVILLE WAS VOTED BY READERS' DIGEST AS ONE OF THE TOP 20 PLACES IN THE UNITED STATES TO LIVE, WITH AN AVERAGE SALE PRICE OF A HOUSE AROUND $61,000 . THE CITY ALSO RECENTLY CELEBRATED THEIR BICENTENNIAL. ALTHOUGH STEUBENVILLE IS A RAPIDLY GROWING CITY, IT STILL RETAINS THE QUAINTNESS AND CHARM OF THOSE DAYS WHEN DINO WALKED IT'S STREETS. IN 1996, DUE TO A PUBLIC OUTCRY TO HAVE A MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR DEAN, WHERE HIS MILLIONS OF FANS COULD PAY THEIR RESPECTS... DEAN'S HOMETOWN OF STEUBENVILLE HEARTILY OBLIGED WITH A PUBLIC MEMORIAL AND CELEBRATION EVENT.

"THE DEAN MARTIN COMMITTEE"... A GROUP, WITH THE TASK OF LANDING AND HOLDING THE EVENT WAS FOUNDED AND FORMED BY MAYOR DOMENICK MUCCI IN APRIL 1996.

ABOUT THIS TIME, THE "CITY OF MURALS", WANTING TO ERECT A MURAL OF DEAN IN HIS HOMETOWN, STARTED FUND RAISING APPEALS

TURNING TO THE "DEAN MARTIN COMMITTEE" FOR HELP... THEIR GOALS WERE REACHED OVER THE FOLLOWING YEAR. "THE DEAN MARTIN COMMITTEE'S" MANY FUND RAISING EVENTS, AND ASSISTANCE FROM THE "DEAN MARTIN FAN CENTER", GAVE FANS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD A CHANCE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS LASTING MEMORIAL IN DEAN'S HONOR

ARTIST BOB DEVER HAS BEEN EQUALLY HONORED FOR HIS BEAUTIFUL MURAL DEPICTING THE MANY FACETS OF DEAN'S CAREER.

THE PHOTOGRAPH TO THE RIGHT IS FROM THE 1996 MEMORIAL EVENT.

THE MAIN HIGHWAY RUNNING THROUGH TOWN WAS RE-DEDICATED "DEAN MARTIN BOULEVARD" AND NEW SIGNS WERE UNVEILED.

SINCE THIS TIME, THE DEAN MARTIN COMMITTEE HAS WELCOMED VISITORS FROM ALL OVER TO IT'S QUAINT TOWN.

YOU CAN ROLL YOUR WINDOW DOWN AND ASK ANYONE THAT YOU SEE, "WHERE IS THE DEAN MARTIN MURAL LOCATED?" AND THEY WILL BE THRILLED TO TELL YOU, IF NOT VOLUNTEER TO ACTUALLY TAKE YOU THERE IN PERSON TO SEE IT!
