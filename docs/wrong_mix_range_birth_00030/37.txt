KALAMAZOO, MI – The Y2K bug was a legitimate concern, Cher's "Believe" was playing through your stereo, and Mark Zuckerberg was getting his feet wet in software programming.

The year was 1999, and Pete Sampras held the world’s No. 1 tennis ranking, with the likes of Andre Agassi and Yevgeny Kafelnikov chasing from behind.

American teenager Andy Roddick was a young tennis player without much star power, but it wouldn’t take long to change that after his performance at Kalamazoo’s Stowe Stadium.

Roddick won the 18-and-under doubles title with partner LeVar Harper-Griffith at the 1999 U.S. Tennis Association Boys National Championships on the Kalamazoo College hardcourt, sparking a stellar pro career that saw him earn the world’s No. 1 ranking four years later.

Roddick returns to Stowe Stadium for the first time since his junior championship, and the retired tennis player will again compete in a doubles match – this time carrying his bag and 17 years’ worth of name recognition.

Fresh off his July induction to the International Tennis Hall of Fame, the Omaha, Nebraska, native will team up with Detroit native and former pro Michael Russell for a 7 p.m. pro-set match Saturday against the tournament’s top-seeded 18U doubles pair.

The retired pros will then switch sides and team up with one of the junior players for another match.

Michigan well represented in tournament field

Bill Duo, a Portage native and Princeton University tennis commit, is highest seed of Michigan’s 18U competitors, checking in at No. 18 in the singles bracket. Rated as a five-star recruit for the class of 2018, Duo advanced to the fifth round of the tournament last year in the 16U bracket, and he’ll receive a first-round bye this year.

The tournament begins Friday, with opening-round play in 18U singles and doubles, followed by Round 1 of 16U singles and doubles on Saturday. The doubles champions in both age groups will be crowned on Saturday, Aug. 12, while the singles championship matches will be held on Sunday, Aug. 13.

Follow along to see the rest of the athletes competing in front of their home-state crowd.
