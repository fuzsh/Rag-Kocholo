Andy Roddick is a sports commentator and retired tennis player who was at one time ranked No. 1 in the world. He reached the semifinal of the 2003 Australian Open at just 20 years of age and captured a remarkable U.S. Open title later that year. Near the end of the season, Roddick attained the world No. 1 ranking, but that U.S. Open victory would be the only Grand Slam singles title of his career. Roddick subsequently sniffed Grand Slam glory several times, but he lost in the Wimbledon final in 2004, 2005 and 2009, each time succumbing to Roger Federer.

Roddick was known for his punishing serve-measured in excess of 150 miles per hour during play on several occasions-and fiery on-court demeanor, but his career was marred by injuries during his prime. After retiring from pro tennis, Roddick parlayed his passion for sports into a role as an analyst on the debut of "Fox Sports Live" (2013- ), the flagship program on the network Fox Sports 1, joined by former NFL quarterback Donovan McNabb and basketball Hall of Famer Gary Payton.

Roddick was born on August 30, 1982 in Omaha, NE, the son of Blanche and Jerry Roddick. Both of his older brothers, John and Lawrence, played competitive tennis growing up. Roddick was raised in Austin, Texas before the family moved to Boca Raton, FL. to facilitate the tennis career of his older brother. Roddick graduated from Boca Raton Preparatory School. He considered giving up tennis as a 17-year-old, but his coach convinced him to stay with it for at least a bit longer.

Roddick's powerful hitting soon helped him ascend to the No. 1 ranking on the junior circuit with junior singles titles at the Australian Open and U.S. Open in 2000. He reached the pinnacle of his career in 2003, but injuries and a handful of other great tennis players kept him from returning to top of the rankings. Roddick was known for his hot temper on the court, which notably came to a head at the 2008 Australian Open. Roddick denigrated chair umpire Emmanuel Joseph with microphones recording him exclaiming, "You're an idiot! Stay in school, kids, or you'll end up being an umpire!" Roddick also unleashed on an unfortunate female lineswoman for calling a foot fault on him during the 2010 U.S. Open.

However, the hot-headed Roddick has a humorous side as well, seen in his impersonations of other players including Rafael Nadal and Maria Sharapova. In 2012, he announced on his 30th birthday during the U.S. Open that he would retire at the conclusion of that tournament. He compiled a 612-213 record as a pro and won 32 tournaments, winning over $20 million during his tennis career.

Roddick's high profile as a tennis star led to some acting opportunities, including a role as himself on a 2002 episode of "Sabrina the Teenage Witch" (ABC/The WB, 1996-2003). He hosted "Saturday Night Live" (NBC, 1975- ) in 2003, and landed a small role in the 2011 movie "Just Go With It." In 2004, he won the ESPY for Best Male Tennis Player. Roddick has also been active in the non-profit sector and established the Andy Roddick Foundation in 2000 to benefit underprivileged youth. He received the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian Award in 2004 for his charitable work to benefit the victims of a devastating tsunami. Roddick married swimsuit model Brooklyn Decker in 2009.
