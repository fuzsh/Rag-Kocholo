        "text": "Roddick was born in Omaha, NE, the son of Blanche and Jerry Roddick. Both of his older brothers, John and Lawrence, played competitive tennis growing up. Roddick was raised in Austin, Texas before the family moved to Boca Raton, FL. To facilitate the tennis career of his older brother. Roddick graduated from Boca Raton Preparatory School. He considered giving up tennis as a 17-year-old, but his coach convinced him to stay with it for at least a bit longer. Roddick's powerful hitting soon helped him ascend to the No. 1 ranking on the junior circuit with junior singles titles at the Australian Open and U.S. Open in 2000. He reached the pinnacle of his career in 2003, but injuries and a handful of other great tennis players kept him from returning to top of the rankings. Roddick was known for his hot temper on the court, which notably came to a head at the 2008 Australian Open. Roddick denigrated chair umpire Emmanuel Joseph with microphones recording him exclaiming, \"You're an idiot! Stay in school, kids, or you'll end up being an umpire!\" Roddick also unleashed on an unfortunate female lineswoman for calling a foot fault on him during the 2010 U.S. Open. However, the hot-headed Roddick has a humorous side as well, seen in his impersonations of other players including Rafael Nadal and Maria Sharapova. In 2012, he announced on his 30th birthday during the U.S. Open that he would retire at the conclusion of that tournament. He compiled a 612-213 record as a pro and won 32 tournaments, winning over $20 million during his tennis career. Roddick's high profile as a tennis star led to some acting opportunities, including a role as himself on a 2002 episode of \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\" (ABC/The WB, 1996-2003). He hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" (NBC, 1975-) in 2003, and landed a small role in the 2011 movie \"Just Go With It.\" In 2004, he won the ESPY for Best Male Tennis Player. Roddick has also been active in the non-profit sector and established the Andy Roddick Foundation in 2000 to benefit underprivileged youth. He received the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian Award in 2004 for his charitable work to benefit the victims of a devastating tsunami. Roddick married swimsuit model Brooklyn Decker in 2009."
