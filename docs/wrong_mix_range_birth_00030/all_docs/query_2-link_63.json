        "text": "What Is Brooklyn Decker's Net Worth?\n\nBrooklyn Decker is an American fashion model and actress who has a net worth of $40 million. That is a combined net worth with her husband since 2009, retired professional tennis player Andy Roddick. Brooklyn Decker first became famous by modeling for many magazines including \"Sports Illustrated.\" She is best known for her photos in the \"Swimsuit Issue,\" including the cover of the 2010 issue. She has also appeared on television shows like Netflix's \"Grace & Frankie\" and the movie \"What to Expect When You're Expecting\".\n\nEarly Life\n\nBrooklyn Decker was born Brooklyn Danielle Decker on April 12, 1987, in Kettering, Ohio. Her mother was a nurse, and her father was a pacemaker salesman. Her family moved to Middletown, Ohio, when she was young, but they later settled in Matthews, North Carolina, which is a suburb outside of Charlotte. She grew up there with her younger brother and attended David W. Butler High School. Her modeling career started after being discovered at a shopping mall in Charlotte, and she became the face of Mauri Simone, a prom dress designer. When she was just 15 years old, Brooklyn won the Model of the Year Award at the 2003 Connections Model and Talent Convention. When she was 17, she began modeling for \"Teen Vogue\" and would travel back and forth from North Carolina to New York City for work.\n\nModeling Career\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Decker moved to New York City to pursue her modeling career. She had only been in the city for a few months when she auditioned to be on the cover of the \"Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition,\" and she appeared in the magazine the next year. Prior to being featured in the coveted \"Swimsuit Edition,\" Decker had already modeled in magazines such as \"Teen Vogue,\" \"Cosmopolitan,\" and \"Glamour,\" and she had been featured on the covers of \"GQ,\" \"Esquire,\" and \"Flare.\" In 2007, she made it into the \"Swimsuit Edition\" again, and she hosted a behind-the-scenes special about the issue. Brooklyn was featured in the magazine for a third time in 2008. After appearing in the special edition for five consecutive years, she was asked to be on the cover in 2010. She was only 22 at the time and stated that she was shocked to have achieved her dream at such an early point in her career.\n\nShe has appeared in campaigns for The Gap, Intimissimi, Venus Razors, and Victoria's Secret. In 2005, she served as a guest judge on the competitive reality television show \"Germany's Next Top Model.\" In 2007, she had a feature on \"Sports Illustrated's\" website called \"She Says, Z Says,\" in which she would discuss the NFL games of the week with Paul Zimmerman. In 2008, Decker and other \"Sports Illustrated\" models rang the New York Stock Exchange Bell. In 2010, she was named one of the hottest women of all time by \"Men's Health.\" She has also appeared in music videos for 3 Doors Down and Jimmy Buffet.\n\nActing Career\n\nIn 2006, Decker made her first appearance on film in the comedy-drama \"The Devil Wears Prada,\" but her role was minor and uncredited. Her first credited appearance was a guest-starring role in a 2009 episode of the NBC series \"Chuck.\" Later that year, she guest starred on the USA Network series \"Royal Pains\" and the ABC comedy \"Ugly Betty.\"\n\nBeing featured on the cover of the \"Swimsuit Edition\" lifted Decker's public presence significantly, and she started to transition into more serious acting roles. In 2011, she starred alongside Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston in the romantic comedy film \"Just Go with It.\" Despite the film being eviscerated by critics and winning two Golden Razzberry Awards for worst actor and worst director, it was a box office hit and grossed $214 million worldwide. The following year she played the role of a physical therapist in the adventure science-fiction film \"Battleship,\" which featured a star-studded cast including Rihanna, Liam Neeson, and Alex Skarsg√•rd. Though it grossed just over $300 million internationally at the box office, the film failed to meet expectations with its budget of $220 million, and it received mixed reviews among critics.\n\nThat same year, Brooklyn had a supporting role as the pregnant wife of a much older man in the comedy film \"What to Expect When You're Expecting.\" The film featured Cameron Diaz, Jennifer Lopez, Elizabeth Banks, and Chris Rock, but it was only a moderate success, grossing over $80 million worldwide against a budget of $41.2 million. In 2014, she had a supporting role in the comedy crime film \"Stretch\" alongside Jessica Alba and Ed Helms. Although the film was originally to see a theatrical release with distribution by Universal Pictures, the studio dropped it, and the movie's producer was unable to find another distributor. Ultimately, it was released on iTunes and as a video on demand, which contributed to it grossing just $5 million.\n\nIn addition to her earlier cameos on television, Decker starred in the one-season sitcom \"Friends with Better Lives.\" She has made appearances on the television shows \"The League,\" \"New Girl,\" and \"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.\" In 2015, she was cast in a supporting role on the Netflix series \"Grace & Frankie,\" and she continued to be a regular on the show until it concluded in its seventh season.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nIn 2007, Brooklyn began dating tennis star Andy Roddick, and they became engaged the following year. They married in 2009 and live in Roddick's hometown of Austin, Texas. The couple has two children together. Decker is a fan of the Carolina Panthers football team and the North Carolina Tar Heels basketball team.\n\nReal Estate\n\nA year before marrying, Brooklyn and Andy paid $1.1 million for an NYC apartment. They still own this property.\n\nIn November 2009, just a few months after marrying, Andy and Brooklyn paid an undisclosed amount for a 1.8-acre lake-front property in Austin. They listed the property, which features a nearly 9,000-square-foot home, for sale in 2013 for $12.5 million. They did not find a buyer and ultimately pulled the listing.\n\nIn 2012, Brooklyn and Andy paid $300,000 for a 2.75-acre property in North Carolina.\n\nIn July 2013, they paid $3.7 million for a 15-acre property in Austin. They proceeded to custom-build a mansion on the lot. They tried to sell this home in 2018 for $6 million. They accepted $4.65 million in September 2019."
