        "text": "KALAMAZOO, MI - Nine months after ending his freshman season at Okemos High School with a Division 2 tennis state title at No. 1 singles, Ozan Colak showed his game translates pretty well to the national stage.\n\nColak claimed a sixth-place finish Sunday in the 16U division of the 2019 USTA Boys National Championships at Kalamazoo College’s Stowe Stadium.\n\nThe country's premier hardcourt junior tennis tournament, the 'Nats at the Zoo' has sparked the careers of the sport's best American players, including Rod Laver, Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi and Andy Roddick.\n\nThe tournament’s 33rd seed, Colak saw his run end with a 3-6, 4-6 loss to New Jersey native and No. 31 seed Evan Wen in the feed-in championship match, giving him a 10-2 record for the week, including wins over No. 6 seed William Cooksey, No. 3 seed Sameer Banerjee and No. 15 seed Braden Schick.\n\n\"It's huge in just proving to myself that I can compete with everyone and getting some really good wins is really big for my confidence,\" said Colak, who is rated as a blue chip recruit and the No. 13 prospect nationally for the class of 2022, according to the Tennis Recruiting Network.\n\nThe feed-in semifinal win over Schick was especially helpful for his confidence because he had struggled against the North Carolina native in the past, including a 4-6, 6-2, 5-7 loss in Round 3 of the main draw that sent Colak to the consolation bracket.\n\n\"Losing in the round of 64 was tough,\" he said. \"I just told myself, 'All right, I just have to deal with the circumstances and try to get over it, work my way through the back. I know that I can still do pretty well in the tournament overall, so just keep fighting through it.'\n\nColak said he was \"stoked\" when he found out he'd get another match against Schick because his Round 3 performance was the closest he had played him in their brief history against each other.\n\n\"I had played him like three or four times before, and every time I had lost without even getting five games, so he had been dominating me the past couple times, and then when we played earlier in the tournament, I just proved to myself that I really could compete with him,\" Colak said. \"Then, I don't know, I just found ways to beat him and found a better game strategy.\"\n\nAlthough he was born in Kalamazoo, Colak moved to Okemos at age 3, so he doesn’t have many memories of birth city, but he said he feels a connection to the annual tournament at Stowe Stadium, and the fans showed their appreciation for the native Michigander, providing an extended round of applause when he accepted his sixth-place trophy.\n\n\"I was pushing myself through because I was thinking, 'This is my tournament. I live here. I was born here. I should do well here,' and that just kept pushing me through,\" Colak said. \"It felt really good.\"\n\nFollow along to see how the tournament's other 11 competitors from Michigan fared.\n\n---\n\nLuke Baylis\n\nHometown: Clarkston\n\nDivision: 18U\n\nSingles tournament record: 2-2\n\nDoubles tournament record: 1-1\n\n---\n\nJacob Bickerseth\n\nHometown: West Bloomfield\n\nDivision: 18U\n\nSingles tournament record: 2-2\n\nDoubles tournament record: 1-1\n\n---\n\nWilliam Cooksey\n\nHometown: Grosse Pointe Shores\n\nDivision: 16U\n\nSingles tournament record: 4-2\n\nDoubles tournament record: 1-1\n\n---\n\nJeffrey Etterbeek\n\nHometown: Bloomfield Hills\n\nDivision: 16U\n\nSingles tournament record: 2-2\n\nDoubles tournament record: 1-1\n\n---\n\nLucas Guy\n\nHometown: Portage\n\nDivision: 18U\n\nSingles tournament record: 0-2\n\nDoubles tournament record: 2-1\n\n---\n\nAidan Kim\n\nHometown: Milford\n\nDivision: 16U\n\nSingles tournament record: 1-2\n\nDoubles tournament record: 5-1 (16U runner-up)\n\n---\n\nBenjamin Letzer\n\nHometown: Okemos\n\nDivision: 18U\n\nSingles tournament record: 1-2\n\nDoubles tournament record: 0-1\n\n---\n\nMert Oral\n\nHometown: Ann Arbor\n\nDivision: 16U\n\nSingles tournament record: 2-2\n\nDoubles tournament record: 0-1\n\n---\n\nJoshua Portnoy\n\nHometown: Okemos\n\nDivision: 16U\n\nSingles tournament record: 2-2\n\nDoubles tournament record: 0-1\n\n---\n\nNathaniel Webster\n\nHometown: Mattawan\n\nDivision: 16U\n\nSingles tournament record: 0-2\n\nDoubles tournament record: 0-1\n\n---\n\nAndrew Zhang\n\nHometown: Bloomfield Hills\n\nDivision: 18U\n\nSingles tournament record: 2-2"
